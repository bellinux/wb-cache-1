40|$|The {{atrioventricular}} (AV) valves of {{the heart}} develop from undifferentiated mesenchymal endocardial cushions, which later mature into stratified valves with diversified extracellular matrix (ECM). Because the mature valves express genes associated with osteogenesis and exhibit disease-associated calcification, we hypothesized the existence of shared regulatory pathways active in developing AV valves and in bone progenitor cells. To define gene regulatory programs of valvulogenesis relative to osteoblast progenitors, we undertook Affymetrix gene expression profiling analysis of murine embryonic day (E) 12. 5 AV endocardial cushions compared with E 17. 5 AV valves (mitral and tricuspid) and with preosteoblast MC 3 T 3 -E 1 (subclone 4) cells. Overall, MC 3 T 3 cells were significantly more similar to E 17. 5 valves than to E 12. 5 cushions, supporting the hypothesis that valve maturation involves the expression of many genes also expressed in osteoblasts. Several transcription factors characteristic of mesenchymal and osteoblast precursor cells, including Twist 1, are predominant in E 12. 5 <b>cushion.</b> <b>Valve</b> maturation is characterized by differential regulation of matrix metalloproteinases and their inhibitors as well as complex collagen gene expression. Among the most highly enriched genes during valvulogenesis {{were members of the}} small leucine-rich proteoglycan (SLRP) family including Asporin, a known negative regulator of osteoblast differentiation and mineralization. Together, these data support shared gene expression profiles of the developing valves and osteoblast bone precursor cells in normal valve development and homeostasis with potential functions in calcific valve disease...|$|E

40|$|Congenital heart defects {{remain the}} most common birth defect in humans, {{occurring}} in over 1 % of live births. The high prevalence of cardiac malformations can be partially attributed to limited knowledge regarding the embryonic roots of the disease. A variety of congenital heart defects are thought to arise from combinations of genetic and epigenetic factors. In an effort to better understand this dynamic relationship, our study explores the structure and function of the developing heart and valves and examines hemodynamic factors influencing valvulogenesis. In order to study cardiac mechanics, we employed novel high-speed confocal microscopy and four-dimensional visualization techniques. A dynamic four-dimensional dataset describing heart and valve development along with blood flow patterns throughout cardiac morphogenesis is presented. Utilizing newly developed tools, we propose a novel pumping mechanism in the valveless embryonic heart tube via elastic wave propagation and reflection. We show that this form of pumping leads to oscillatory shear stresses in the developing atrio-ventricular canal, a phenomenon that had not previously been documented. An in vivo method to modulate trans-valvular oscillatory flows is described and used to test our hypothesis that oscillatory shear stress across the primitive <b>valve</b> <b>cushions</b> stimulates heart <b>valve</b> leaflet formation. Our results suggest hemodynamic forces contribute to valvulogenesis and enhance our understanding of normal and abnormal heart valve development...|$|R

The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between Brn- 3 a and Brn- 3 b and Hsp 27 expression in the developing rodent heart. Brn- 3 a and Brn- 3 b were detected from embryonic days 9. 5 – 10. 5 (E 9. 5 –E 10. 5) in the mouse heart, with significant increases seen later during development. Two isoforms (long and short) of each protein were detected during embryogenesis and postnatally. Brn- 3 a messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein were localized by E 13. 0 to the atrio-ventricular (AV) <b>valve</b> <b>cushions</b> and leaflets, outflow tract (OFT), epicardium and cardiac ganglia. By E 14. 5, Brn- 3 a was also localised to the septa and compact ventricular myocardium. An increase in expression of the long Brn- 3 a(l) isoform between E 17 and adult coincided with a decrease in expression of Brn- 3 b(l) and a marked increase in expression of Hsp 27. Hearts from Brn- 3 a−/− mice displayed a partially penetrant phenotype marked by thickening of the endocardial <b>cushions</b> and AV <b>valve</b> leaflets and hypoplastic ventricular myocardium. Loss of Brn- 3 a was correlated with a compensatory increase in Brn- 3 b and GATA 3 mRNA but no change in Hsp 27 mRNA. Reporter assays in isolated cardiomyocytes demonstrated that both Brn- 3 a and Brn- 3 b activate the hsp 27 promoter via a consensus Brn- 3 -binding site. Therefore, Brn- 3 POU factors may play an important role in the development and maintenance of critical cell types and structures within the heart, in part via developmental regulation of myocardial Hsp 27 expression.

40|$|Epithelial–mesenchymal {{transformation}} {{is a critical}} developmental process reiterated in multiple organs throughout embryogenesis. Formation of endocardial <b>cushions,</b> primordia of <b>valves</b> and septa, {{is a classic example}} of epithelial–mesenchymal transformation. Several gene mutations are known to affect cardiac valve formation. Sox 9 is activated when endocardial endothelial cells undergo mesenchymal transformation and migrate into an extracellular matrix, called cardiac jelly, to form endocardial cushions. In Sox 9 -null mutants, endocardial cushions are markedly hypoplastic. In these mutants, Nfatc 1 is ectopically expressed and no longer restricted to endothelial cells. Further, Sox 9 -deficient endocardial mesenchymal cells fail to express ErbB 3, which is required for endocardial cushion cell differentiation and proliferation. Our results reveal a succession of molecular steps in the pathway of endocardial cushion development. We propose that loss of Sox 9 inhibits epithelial–mesenchymal transformation after delamination and initial migration, but before definitive mesenchymal transformation...|$|R
40|$|One {{essential}} downstream {{signaling pathway}} of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), such as vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) and the Tie 2 receptor, is the phosphoinositide- 3 kinase (PI 3 K) -phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1 (PDK 1) -Akt/protein kinase B (PKB) cascade that plays {{a critical role}} in development and tumorigenesis. However, the role of PDK 1 in cardiovascular development remains unknown. Here, we deleted PDK 1 specifically in endothelial cells in mice. These mice displayed hemorrhage and hydropericardium and died at approximately embryonic day 11. 5 (E 11. 5). Histological analysis revealed defective vascular remodeling and development and disrupted integrity between the endothelium and trabeculae/myocardium in the heart. The atrioventricular canal (AVC) <b>cushion</b> and <b>valves</b> failed to form, indicating a defect in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), together with increased endothelial apoptosis. Consistently, ex vivo AVC explant culture showed impeded mesenchymal outgrowth. Snail protein was reduced and was absent from the nucleus in AVC cells. Delivery of the Snail S 6 A mutant to the AVC explant effectively rescued EMT defects. Furthermore, adenoviral Akt delivery rescued EMT defects in AVC explant culture, and deletion of PTEN delayed embryonic lethality of PDK 1 endothelial deletion mice by 1 day and rendered normal development of the AVC cushion in the PDK 1 -deficient heart.

40|$|Twist 1, a basic helix-loop-helix {{transcription}} factor, {{is expressed}} in mesenchymal precursor populations during embryogenesis and in metastatic cancer cells. In the developing heart, Twist 1 is highly expressed in endocardial <b>cushion</b> (ECC) <b>valve</b> mesenchymal cells and is down regulated during valve differentiation and remodeling. Previous studies demonstrated that Twist 1 promotes cell proliferation, migration, and expression of primitive extracellular matrix (ECM) molecules in ECC mesenchymal cells. Furthermore, Twist 1 expression is induced in human pediatric and adult diseased heart valves. However, the Twist 1 downstream target genes that mediate increased cell proliferation and migration during early heart valve development remain largely unknown. Candidate gene and global gene profiling approaches were used to identify transcriptional targets of Twist 1 during heart valve development. Candidate target genes were analyzed for evolutionarily conserved regions (ECRs) containing E-box consensus sequences that are potential Twist 1 binding sites. ECRs containing conserved E-box sequences were identified for Twist 1 responsive genes Tbx 20, Cdh 11, Sema 3 C, Rab 39 b, and Gadd 45 a. Twist 1 binding to these sequences in vivo was determined by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays, and binding was detected in ECCs but not late stage remodeling valves.

40|$|RATIONALE: Since their {{discovery}} almost 20 years ago, microRNAs {{have been}} shown to perform essential roles during tissue development and disease. Although roles for microRNAs in the myocardium during embryo development and cardiac disease have been demonstrated, very little is know about their role in the endocardium or during cardiac valve formation. OBJECTIVE: To study the role of microRNAs in cardiac valve formation. METHODS AND RESULTS: We show that zebrafish dicer mutant embryos, lacking mature miRNAs, form excessive endocardial cushions. By screening miRNAs expressed in the heart, we found that miR- 23 is both necessary and sufficient for restricting the number of endocardial cells that differentiate into endocardial cushion cells. In addition, in mouse endothelial cells, miR- 23 inhibited a transforming growth factor-beta-induced endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition. By in silico screening of expression data with predicted miR- 23 target sites combined with in vivo testing, we identified hyaluronic acid synthase 2 (Has 2), Icat, and Tmem 2 as novel direct targets of miR- 23. Finally, we demonstrate that the upregulation of Has 2, an extracellular remodeling enzyme required for endocardial <b>cushion</b> and <b>valve</b> formation, is responsible for the excessive endocardial cushion cell differentiation in dicer mutants. CONCLUSIONS: MiR- 23 in the embryonic heart is required to restrict endocardial cushion formation by inhibiting Has 2 expression and extracellular hyaluronic acid production.

40|$|Congenital heart defects (CHDs) {{occur in}} 5 % of births. While gene {{mutations}} {{have been identified}} in CHD patients, not much is known about coordinated signaling mechanisms during heart morphogenesis. Endocardial cushions of the atrioventricular canal and outflow tract contribute to the formation of valves and septa in the heart. Epithelial cell to mesenchymal cell transition (EMT) is a key process in cardiac cushions before this tissue undergoes remodeling into valves and septa. Defining complex signaling networks directing cardiac cushion epithelial to mesenchymal transition is essential for understanding the etiology of CHDs. We identified the MAP 3 Kinases, MEKK 3 and MEKK 4, as signaling components present during cardiovascular development. MEKK 3 is detected in myocardium and endocardium surrounding the cardiac cushions of the atrioventricular canal during heart morphogenesis, while MEKK 4 is found in the myocardium, endocardium, and cushion mesenchyme. Functional assays were employed to examine how MEKK 3 and MEKK 4 kinase activity contributes to endocardial EMT. Addition of dominant negative (dn) -MEKK 3 or dn-MEKK 4 to endocardial cushion explants, cultures that recapitulate in vivo EMT, causes a significant decrease in mesenchyme formation as compared to controls. Ventricular explant cultures, where the endocardial cells do not normally undergo EMT, provided with constitutively active (ca) MEKK 3 activates mesenchyme production. ca-MEKK 4 is not sufficient to cause EMT in ventricular endocardium. Furthermore, ca-MEKK 3 expression in ventricular explants leads to increased secreted TGFβ 2, which mediates mesenchyme formation. Blockade of TGFβ 2 in ventricular explant cultures provided with ca-MEKK 3 ablates the activation of EMT. In addition to in vitro studies, we show that mice expressing kinase inactive MEKK 4 have myxomatous valves characterized by increased proliferation and changes in extracellular matrix molecules such as hyaluronan. We next investigated whether signal transduction is affected in <b>cushions</b> and <b>valves</b> of the MEKK 4 kinase inactive mice. Abnormal TGFβ signaling is observed in MEKK 4 mutant hearts, which is also seen with Marfan's sydrome. Remarkably, activated MEKK 3 is maintained in cardiac cushions of these mice after EMT indicating compensation by MEKK 3 for loss of MEKK 4 catalytic activity. Our observations define MEKK 3 and MEKK 4 expression during cardiovascular development and suggest that MEKK 3 and MEKK 4 have diverse functions during development of heart valves...|$|R
40|$|MicroRNAs {{regulate}} {{endocardial cushion}} differentiation To investigate more specifically {{the function of}} miRNAs in both the myocardium and endocardium, I generated MZdicer mutant lines carrying either a cmlc 2 :GFP (myocardium) or a kdr-l:GFP (endothelial cells, endocardium) transgene. We performed detailed protein and mRNA expression analysis {{and found that the}} endocardium was most affected by a loss of miRNAs. Endocardial <b>cushion</b> (EC/ <b>valve)</b> specific markers like hyaluronic acid synthase 2 (has 2) and the cell surface protein Alcama/Dm-grasp, were ectopically expressed in endocardial cells lining the chambers of MZdicer mutant hearts indicating an expansion of the EC primordium. We subsequently identified miR- 23 to be functionally responsible for restricting valve formation in the embryo. MiR- 23 knockdown resulted in a similar EC expansion and reintroducing miR- 23 rescued the MZdicer endocardial phenotype. We could detect miR- 23 expression in the ECs from 53 hpf, 20 hours after the onset of cardiac cushion differentiation. Interestingly, when we overexpressed miR- 23 in mouse embryonic endothelial cells (MEECs), we could inhibit a TGF-β induced EMT response. We next searched for miR- 23 target genes. We selected a group of candidate genes that were specifically expressed in mouse embryonic hearts at E 10. 5 and contain a putative miR- 23 3 ’UTR target sequence (www. targetscan. org). We subsequently selected candidate genes that were shown to be up-regulated during EMT in MEECs and identified functional interactions with miR- 23 using zebrafish 3 ’UTR sequences. This study identified three novel miR- 23 targets; has 2, transmembrane protein 2 (tmem 2) and β-catenin interacting protein 1 (ctnnbip 1 /icat). Having established that miR- 23 regulates these genes and EC formation in the embryo, we finally showed that extracellular HA production is directly responsible for the excessive endocardial cushion cell differentiation in dicermutants. HA can bind the CD 44 receptor and thereby stimulate the PI 3 K pathway, which results in increased Has 2 expression. In addition, the HA/CD 44 /ErbB 2 interaction induces β-catenin activation, which results in the induction of Has 2 expression. Therefore based on my studies we have proposed that excessive HA production in the cardiac jelly due to a loss of miR- 23 function, inducesan auto regulatory loop in normally non-responsive cells which start to express has 2 resulting in more HA secretion. With this study we were the first to report a role for miRNAs during cardiac valve development...|$|R
40|$|ObjectiveBicuspid aortic valve, {{the most}} common {{congenital}} cardiac malformation, is caused by fusion of <b>valve</b> <b>cushions</b> {{at the onset of}} valvulogenesis. Although its exact pathogenesis is still unclear, a genetic basis is appearing more and more likely. Search for a potential candidate gene by reviewing semilunar valve morphogenesis led us to the ubiquitin fusion degradation 1 –like gene (UFD 1 L), which is highly expressed in the cardiac outflow tract during embryogenesis. MethodsAortic valves were collected during surgery from 39 patients with bicuspid aortic valve (mean age 56. 8 ± 18. 1 years) and from 38 patients with tricuspid aortic valve (mean age 61. 7 ± 16. 1 years). Fluorescence in situ hybridization was performed for detection of microdeletion, quantitative reverse transcriptase–polymerase chain reaction to measure gene expression, and Western blotting to analyze the amount of UFD 1 L gene product. ResultsNo microdeletion was found in either group in the critical region of chromosome 22 containing the UFD 1 L gene. UFD 1 L gene expression, however, was significantly reduced in bicuspid aortic valve samples (median 787 -fold) relative to tricuspid aortic valve samples (median 10, 887 -fold, P =. 001). The amount of UFD 1 L gene product was also significantly diminished in bicuspid aortic valve samples (3. 9 ± 2. 6 vs 8. 4 ± 4. 8 optical density units, P <. 05).

Methods: Normal human hearts at between 5 and 19 weeks of development were studied with immunohistochemistry, three-dimensional reconstructions, and gross inspection. Scanning electron microscopy was used to study human and rat hearts. Results: In embryonic hearts a prominent horseshoe-shaped myocardial ridge runs from the anterior wall through the apex to the posterior wall of the left ventricle. In the atrioventricular region this ridge is continuous with atrial myocardium and covered with cushion tissue. The anterior and posterior parts of the trabecular ridge enlarge and loosen their connections with the atrial myocardium. Their lateral sides gradually delaminate from the left ventricular wall, and the continuity between the two parts is incorporated in the apical trabecular network. In this way the anterior and posterior parts of the ridge transform into the anterolateral and the posteromedial papillary muscles, respectively. Simultaneously, the <b>cushions</b> remodel into <b>valve</b> leaflets and chordae. Only the chordal part of the cushions remains attached to the developing papillary muscles. Conclusions: Disturbed delamination of the anterior or posterior part of the trabecular ridge from the ventricular wall, combined with underdevelopment of chordae, {{seems to be the}} cause of asymmetric mitral valves. Parachute valves, however, develop when the connection between the posterior and anterior part of the ridge condenses to form one single papillary muscle. Thus parachute valves and parachute-like asymmetric mitral valves originate in different ways. (J Thorac Cardiovasc Surg 1998; 116 : 36 - 46...|$|R
40|$|Â Â Â For typical vapor {{compression}} processes, {{lubricant oil}} is very essential for lubricating and sealing the sliding parts and the lubricant also takes part in <b>cushioning</b> cylinder <b>valves.</b> However lubricants may {{migrate to the}} evaporator to alter the heat transfer characteristics. This is can be made clear from the viscosity and surface tension of lubricant since the viscosity of lubricant oil is about two to three orders {{higher than that of}} refrigerant whereas the corresponding surface tension of lubricant is approximately one order higher. Typically, the presence of lubricant may deteriorate heat transfer performance, yet this phenomenon becomes more severe when the lubricant mass fraction is higher. However, some previous literatures had clearly showed that the presence of lubricant oil may favor the heat transfer performance at a low lubricant fraction and the heat transfer performance may peak at a specific oil concentration. In this study, the authors aim at clarifying this phenomenon subject to pool boiling condition. Various parameters affecting the heat transfer coefficient, such as viscosity, surface tension, critical solution temperature and other thermodynamic and transport properties will be examined. Â Â Â During pool boiling process, the lubricant accumulates on the surface since the refrigerant is preferential to evaporate. Hence, excess lubricant enrichment on the surface results in a thin lubricant excess layer and a thermal boundary layer, which influence the heat transfer performance, either enhancement or degradation. The excess layer may bring about a liquid-solid surface energy reduction which increases site density and reduces the bubble departure diameter, causing enhancement and degradation in heat transfer performance, respectively. However, the effect of the bubble departure diameter normally surpasses the influence of site density. This may be the crucial reason that gives rise to an occurrence of the plateau of heat transfer coefficient and followed by an apparent decline of heat transfer coefficient with a further increase of lubricant concentration. Â Â Â Moreover, with the preferential evaporation of the refrigerant, a surface tension gradient is formed, which induces the Marangoni effect through which refrigerant/lubricant mixtures is supplied toward the contact line. From the phase equilibrium diagram, the maximum of the Marangoni number may occur at the low lubricant concentration with a maximum temperature difference. Hence, the presence of Marangoni effect may also be the favor the heat transfer accordingly. Also, a small fraction of lubricant will increase a larger viscosity that provide a thicker thermal boundary layer which may activate more site density, and enhances the heat transfer performance. Furthermore, miscibility may also play a crucial factor that affects the pool boiling heat transfer performance. The fluid with a smaller difference between the bulk fluid temperature and critical solution temperature may yield a better heat transfer performance by drawing superheated liquid onto the bubble sides. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of the atrioventricular (AV) canal and the cardiac valves is tightly linked and a critically regulated process. Anomalies in components of the involved pathways can lead to congenital valve malformations, {{a leading cause of}} morbidity and mortality in neonates. Myocardial Bmp as well as endocardial Notch and Wnt signaling have been identified as critical factors for the induction of EMT during the formation of the endocardial <b>cushions</b> and cardiac <b>valves.</b> Of these, canonical Wnt signaling positively regulates endocardial proliferation and EMT but negatively regulates endocardial differentiation. Further, elevated Wnt signaling leads to the ectopic expression of myocardial Bmp ligands suggesting a high level of integration of the involved pathways and crosstalk amongst the different cardiac tissues. Here we have identified a novel role for Id 4 as a mediator between Bmp and Wnt signaling. Id 4 belongs to the Id family of proteins and is known to be involved in bone and nervous system development. We found that in zebrafish, id 4 is expressed in the endocardium of the AV canal at embryonic stages and throughout the atrial chamber in addition to AV canal, in adults. Using transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs) we established an id 4 mutant allele. Our analysis shows that id 4 mutant larvae are susceptible to retrograde blood flow, and show aberrant expression of developmental valvular markers. These include expanded expression domains of markers like bmp 4, cspg 2 a and Alcam. In contrast, valve maturation as assessed by the expression of spp 1 is considerably reduced in id 4 mutants. Using conditional transgenic systems, along with elegant in vivo imaging of transgenic reporter lines, we further found that id 4 is a transcriptional target of Bmp signaling, and it is capable of dose dependently restricting Wnt signaling in the endocardium of the Atrioventricular Canal. Taken together, our data identifies Id 4 as a novel player in Atrioventricular Canal and valve development. We show that Id 4 function is important in valve development acting downstream of Bmp signaling by restricting endocardial Wnt to allow valve maturation...|$|R
40|$|A {{complex set}} of {{developmental}} events transform early primordia within endocardial cushions into the atrioventricular (AV) valves and septa of the mature heart. Endocardial cushions are composed of an inner endocardial layer, and outer myocardial layer, and an acellular extracellular matrix rich layer separating these two layers. A subset of endocardial cells within cushions transform into mesenchymal cells that migrate into the extracellular matrix and differentiate into mature valve and septum tissue. This cell transformation process coupled with asymmetrical cell proliferation within endocardial cushions remodels simple early endocardial <b>cushions</b> into elongated <b>valves.</b> Investigation into molecular mechanisms involved in valve and septum morphogenesis centered on a family of growth factors, called Wnts, due to previous reports showing involvement of this growth factor family in similar developmental processes. Expression analysis of Wnt growth factors, Wnt receptors, and soluble Wnt inhibitors was performed in search of Wnt signaling components with restricted expression in AV endocardial cushions. Initial RT-PCR analysis demonstrated expression of several Wnts (Wnt- 5 a, Wnt- 6, Wnt- 9 a, Wnt- 10 a and Wnt- 11), Wnt receptors (Fz- 1, Fz- 3, Fz- 4, and Fz- 6) and the soluble Wnt antagonist Frzb in early endocardial cushions. Spatial and temporal expression analysis revealed restricted endocardial cushion expression of Wnt- 9 a and Frzb. Wnt- 9 a is expressed in the endocardial cell layer while Frzb is expressed in the endocardium and transformed mesenchyme of AV endocardial cushions. Overexpression of Wnt- 9 a in endocardial cushions increases cell proliferation resulting in enlarged hypercellular endocardial cushions. Overexpression of a truncated mutant form of Wnt- 9 a, which acts in a dominant negative manner, increases programmed cell death in endocardial cushions. Overexpression of Wnt- 9 a also induces β-catenin responsive transcription in AV canals consistent with Wnt- 9 a signaling in a canonical Wnt/β-catenin pathway. Wnt- 9 a induced increases in cell proliferation are inhibited by overexpression of Frzb. Spatial expression patterns suggest that Frzb delineates a zone of Wnt- 9 a induced cell proliferation near the endocardial cell layer to promote endocardial cushion outgrowth and remodeling into mature valve leaflets...|$|R
40|$|Over {{the past}} decade, Australia’s {{migration}} program has evolved. It has {{transformed from a}} program to source labour into a tool which supplements our skill base and imports knowledge. It has become less permanent but more responsive; less centrally set and more demand driven. At {{the heart of this}} transformation is the growth of temporary skilled migration. Approximately 190, 000 temporary migrants now live and work in Australia as primary and secondary 457 visa holders. To put this in perspective, the total number of 457 visa holders currently in Australia is now roughly equal to the annual intake under our permanent migration program, but {{only a fraction of the}} total number of the 1. 2 million temporary migrants residing in Australia at any one time. The 457 visa program is a purpose-built labour market policy tool and part of a new era of people movement management. A growing portion of the permanent program comprises employer-sponsored migrants. Of these permanent migrants, more than 70 per cent of those sponsored already reside in Australia on temporary 457 work visas. This is the newest policy advancement, a two-step migration process, allowing demand to drive the flow of skills into our labour force. The growth of temporary skilled migration means we now have two “migration programs” to address skills shortages that are tied together and inextricably linked: the 457 program and the permanent skilled migration program. Temporary skilled migration has become an automatic relief <b>valve,</b> <b>cushioning</b> the relationship between labour market needs and the time lag inherent to centrally planned permanent migration. Surges in skilled labour requirements or dips in economic activity see numbers of temporary skilled workers ebb and flow. The program helps to maintain Australia’s international competitiveness and is critical to our aspirations to become a regional hub.  Temporary skilled migration has received extensive media coverage and political attention in the almost two decades since the 457 visa was first introduced. Interest in the program reflects the inherent tension in providing a flexible and responsive tool to assist business in accessing the skilled labour they require to satisfy Australia’s labour and economic needs, and enhance our international competitiveness, while also protecting Australian workers, their jobs, training and conditions. In particular there have been periodic reports of exploitation of overseas workers and rorting of aspects of the program by employers.  ...|$|R
40|$|Congenital heart defects (CHDs) are {{the leading}} cause of infant death due to birth defects in the United States. Conotruncal defects (CTDs) are the most severe and the largest group of CHDs. Candidate gene, {{genome-wide}} gene-based analyses with meta-analyses, and pathway level-analyses of CTDs were performed, using rare and common variants, to identify novel inherited genes underlying disease occurrence. Genome-wide analyses and a meta-analysis were also performed to identify maternal genes associated with CTDs. Enrichment of genes with meta-analysis p 3 ̆c 10 - 3 and p 3 ̆c 0. 05 was also evaluated. Both case-parent trios and case-control analyses were conducted using data from multiple cohorts. Although no gene was significantly associated with CTDs at the genome-wide level, several genes with evidence suggestive of association and several significantly enriched gene clusters were identified. Meta-analysis of inherited effects using data from trios identified 11 genes with evidence suggestive of an association (p 3 ̆c 10 - 3), including the Wilms tumor gene, POU 6 F 2 (p= 9. 82 x 10 - 5), and MBNL 1 (p= 1. 50 x 10 - 4), which is expressed in endocardial <b>cushions</b> and heart <b>valves.</b> In addition, meta-analysis of inherited effects using case-control data identified 29 genes, including: NEXN (p= 1. 85 x 10 - 4), which regulates cardiac differentiation; the angiogenesis regulator, PRKD 2 (p= 3. 12 x 10 - 4); and DACT 3 (p= 3. 18 x 10 - 4), which regulates Wnt signaling. Enrichment analysis of genes with meta-analysis p 3 ̆c 0. 05 in the trio-based analyses of inherited genes identified two significantly enriched clusters, one of which included members of the solute carrier family of proteins (Enrichment Score, ES= 1. 78) involved in zinc transmembrane transport. Similarly, six significantly enriched clusters were identified from case-control meta-analysis of inherited genes. The top three clusters included genes that encode cadherins and gamma protocadherins (ES= 8. 83, 8. 74, 1. 89), which are important for cell-cell adhesion, migration and cardiac differentiation. In the maternal genetic effect meta-analysis based on two case/mother-control/father comparisons, the germ cell-specific gene, GGN, was borderline significant (p= 7. 10 x 10 - 6). GGN is critical for the spermatogenesis and is also involved {{in the development of the}} oocyte and preimplantation embryo. Additionally, 33 genes with suggestive evidence of association were identified, including three known CHD-related genes (SUMO 1, p= 1. 06 x 10 - 4; PLXND 1, p= 3. 38 x 10 - 4; TBX 20, p= 8. 58 x 10 - 4), and the oocyte-specific gene, H 1 FOO (p= 7. 92 x 10 - 4). Enrichment analysis of 34 genes with p 3 ̆c 10 - 3 from case-control meta-analysis of maternal effects identified one significantly enriched cluster of three protease inhibitor genes (ES= 2. 11). Similarly, for meta-analysis genes with p 3 ̆c 0. 05, two significantly enriched clusters were identified, including a cluster of three hyaluronidase genes (ES= 1. 30) that are expressed in the ovaries and may be required for embryonic development (i. e. HYAL 2). In summary, these analyses identified, several novel inherited and maternal genes with suggestive evidence of association with CTDs. The identification of enriched gene clusters among our top associations provides important clues regarding the pathogenesis of CTDs. ...|$|R
