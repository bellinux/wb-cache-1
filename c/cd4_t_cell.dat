25|$|In November {{researchers}} {{reported on the}} use of VRX496, a gene-based immunotherapy for the treatment of HIV that uses a lentiviral vector to deliver an antisense gene against the HIV envelope. In a phase I clinical trial, five subjects with chronic HIV infection who had failed to respond to at least two antiretroviral regimens were treated. A single intravenous infusion of autologous CD4 T cells genetically modified with VRX496 was well tolerated. All patients had stable or decreased viral load; four of the five patients had stable or increased <b>CD4</b> <b>T</b> <b>cell</b> counts. All five patients had stable or increased immune response to HIV antigens and other pathogens. This was the first evaluation of a lentiviral vector administered in a US human clinical trial.|$|E
25|$|At {{this point}} chronic {{inflammation}} ensues, and functional CD4+ T cell levels begin to decrease, eventually {{to a point}} where the CD4+ T cell population is too small to recognize the full range of antigens that could potentially be detected. The depletion of CD4 T cells and the development of chronic inflammation are signature processes in HIV pathogenesis that propel progression to acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). <b>CD4</b> <b>T</b> <b>cell</b> depleted to the cell count of less than 200cell/μL in blood during AIDS allows various pathogens to escape T cell recognition, thus allowing opportunistic infections that would normally elicit a helper T cell response to bypass the immune system. While these complete bypass situations only occur when the helper T cell response is absolutely necessary for infection clearance, most infections increase in severity and/or duration because the immune system's helper T cells provide less efficient immune response.|$|E

25|$|THαβ {{helper cells}} provide the host {{immunity}} against viruses. Their differentiation is triggered by IFN α/β or IL-10. Their key effector cytokine is IL-10. Their main effector cells are NK cells {{as well as}} CD8 <b>T</b> <b>cells,</b> IgG B <b>cells,</b> and IL-10 <b>CD4</b> <b>T</b> <b>cells.</b> The key THαβ transcription factors are STAT1 and STAT3 as well as IRFs.

5000|$|Infections most {{commonly}} associated with IRIS include Mycobacterium tuberculosis and cryptococcal meningitis. Persons living with AIDS are more at risk for IRIS if they are starting [...] for the first time, or if they have recently been treated for an opportunistic infection (OI). It is generally advised that when patients have low initial <b>CD4</b> <b>T</b> <b>cell</b> count and opportunistic infection {{at the time of}} their HIV diagnosis, they receive treatment to control the opportunistic infections before HAART is initiated approximately two weeks later. This is true for most OIs, except for OIs involving the central nervous system.|$|E
5000|$|Aside from {{dendritic}} cells, additional cell {{populations were}} identified, that {{are able to}} induce antigen-specific T cell tolerance. These are mainly the members of lymph node stromal cells (LNSCs). LNSCs are generally divided into several sub-populations based on the expression of gp38 (PDPN) and CD31 surface markers. Among those, only fibroblastic reticular cells and lymph node stromal cells were shown {{to play a role in}} the peripheral tolerance. Both of those populations are able to induce CD8 T cell tolerance by presentation of the endogenous antigens on MHCI molecules [...] and even the <b>CD4</b> <b>T</b> <b>cell</b> tolerance by the presentation of the peptide-MHCII complexes, which they acquired from the DCs.|$|E
25|$|Th1 {{helper cells}} are the host {{immunity}} effectors against intracellular bacteria and protozoa. They are triggered by IL-12, IL-2 and their effector cytokine is IFN-γ. The main effector cells of Th1 immunity are macrophages {{as well as}} CD8 <b>T</b> <b>cells,</b> IgG B <b>cells,</b> and IFN-γ <b>CD4</b> <b>T</b> <b>cells.</b> The key Th1 transcription factors are STAT4 and T-bet. IFN-γ secreted by <b>CD4</b> <b>T</b> <b>cells</b> can activate macrophages to phagocytose and digest intracellular bacteria and protozoa. In addition, IFN-γ can activate iNOS to produce NOx free radicals to directly kill intracellular bacteria and protozoa. Th1 overactivation against autoantigens will cause Type 4 delayed-type hypersensitivity. Tuberculin reaction or Type 1 diabetes belong to this category of autoimmunity.|$|R

50|$|A {{study found}} an {{association}} between the discovery of meaning and a lower rate of AIDS-related mortality. This was the first study in which the findings appear to not be mediated by health behaviors or other potential confounds. The study looked at HIV-seropositive men who had recently witnessed {{the death of a}} close friend from AIDS-related death. When confronted with the stress of such a death those men, who were able to find meaning in the loss, were subject to less rapid declines in <b>CD4</b> <b>T</b> <b>cell</b> levels. Furthermore, the subjects who went through cognitive processing in response to the bereavement were more likely to find meaning in the death of the close friend. Thus in experiencing a stressful life event if one is able to engage successfully in finding meaning there is a potential link to positive immunological benefits and health outcomes.|$|E

5000|$|In animal studies, Schizonepeta tenuifolia {{extracts}} in {{high doses}} exhibit immunomodulation of the inflammatory response by regulating cytokine release, specifically {{the release of}} Th1 and Th2 cytokines from <b>T</b> <b>cells</b> {{as well as the}} unprimed <b>CD4</b> <b>T</b> <b>cells</b> from differentiating into Th1 and Th2 cells.

50|$|MHC tetramers {{are used}} in studies of {{pathogen}} immunity and vaccine development, in evaluation of antitumor responses, in allergy monitoring and desensitization studies, and in autoimmunity. They provide an ideal means to characterize the T cells that respond to a vaccine, {{and they have been}} used to test T cell responses in many vaccine systems, including influenza, yellow fever, tuberculosis, HIV/SIV and a large number of cancer vaccine trials, including melanoma and chronic myeloid leukemia. Class II tetramers have been used for analysis of a variety of human <b>CD4</b> <b>T</b> <b>cell</b> responses to pathogens, including influenza A, Borrelia, Epstein-Barr virus, CMV, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, human T-lymphotropic virus 1, hepatitis C, anthrax, severe acute respiratory syndrome virus, human papillomavirus, and HIV.Tetramer variants have been developed that, either radiolabelled or coupled to a toxin such as saporin, can be injected into live mice to modulate or even deplete specific T cell populations.Peptide-MHC tetramers have also been used therapeutically. For instance, cytomegalovirus-specific T cells have been enriched to high levels of purity using magnetic bead-based enrichment for use as a therapy for stem cell transplant patients.|$|E
50|$|Recent studies {{employed}} an ex vivo human lymphoid aggregate culture (HLAC) system {{formed with}} fresh human tonsil or spleen tissue to model molecular and cellular events in human tissues during in vivo HIV infection. These {{studies found that}} >95% of CD4 T cells die because of abortive HIV infection. These dying cells are resting and thus are nonpermissive for productive HIV infection. Full viral replication {{was limited to the}} ∼5% of activated CD4 T cells present in these tissues; these cells die by apoptosis. Abortive HIV infection occurs due to slowing of reverse transcription promoting cytosolic DNA accumulation. This viral DNA is sensed by gamma-interferon-inducible protein 16 (IFI16), which produces an innate immune response against the virus by activating caspase 1 in IFI16 inflammasomes and inducing pyroptosis, a highly inflammatory form of programmed cell death. These findings cast CD4 T-cell death during HIV infection in a different light. Rather than the virus playing a major role, it is the host response to viral DNA produced during abortive infection that triggers CD4 T-cell death. Further, these findings identify novel drug targets that may be exploited to both block <b>CD4</b> <b>T</b> <b>cell</b> demise and the chronic inflammatory response generated during pyroptosis.|$|E
50|$|CD4 {{testing is}} a normal {{practice}} in the clinical laboratory, and is accomplished {{through the use of}} flow cytometry. Flow cytometry is a standard technique used in virtually every hospital and research institution around the world. While flow cytometry techniques are straightforward, they are not necessarily simple, particularly when applied to clinical practice. A great deal of automated technology is employed to gather measurements, analyze data, and produce reports. Consequently, the cost of performing these tests is relatively high. CD4 testing is generally performed by a flow cytometer. In this process, a small tube of blood cells is treated with a reagent which is specific to the CD4 lymphocyte (a type of white blood cell).The reagents used for identification are called monoclonal antibodies (MABs). These antibodies can specifically attach to a certain type of cell. In this case, the antibody will attach to a <b>CD4</b> <b>T</b> <b>cell.</b> Certain molecules (called fluorochromes) areattached to the antibody to aid in the identification process. When a laser beam is fired at the cells, those cells with the attached molecules emit a signal identifying themselves. This signal is called fluorescence and can easily be measured with sensitive detectors. If hundreds or thousands of cells are forced past the laser very quickly, an accurate count can be obtained of all cells that are present. CD4 cells are measured in this manner. CD is an acronym for “cluster of differentiation,” and that simply means that this molecule can be classified into a well-defined group of cells. In this case, it is cluster of differentiation 4, or a CD4 helper T-lymphocyte cell.|$|E
50|$|In the macrophage, {{the primary}} signal for {{activation}} is IFN-γ from Th1 type <b>CD4</b> <b>T</b> <b>cells.</b> The secondary signal is CD40L on the <b>T</b> <b>cell,</b> which binds CD40 on the macrophage cell surface. As a result, the macrophage expresses more CD40 and TNF receptors on its surface, which helps increase {{the level of}} activation. The activated macrophage can then destroy phagocytosed bacteria and produce more cytokines.|$|R
50|$|The {{disease is}} an unusual {{expression}} of <b>CD4</b> <b>T</b> <b>cells,</b> {{a part of the}} immune system. These <b>T</b> <b>cells</b> are skin-associated, meaning that they biochemically and biologically are most related to the skin, in a dynamic manner. Mycosis fungoides is {{the most common type of}} cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL), but there are many other types of CTCL that have nothing to do with mycosis fungoides and these disorders are treated differently.|$|R
5000|$|An April 2007 online paper, in Vaccine, {{showed a}} similar <b>T</b> <b>cell</b> {{response}} potentiation, {{this time with}} 60 subjects being administered Novartis' Agrippal influenza vaccine (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT00354263, Immutep code name P001). This study, initiated in 2005 and completed in mid-2006, compared the influenza vaccine with the vaccine plus IMP321 at doses up to 100μg. For subjects that received IMP321 there were higher levels of Th1-type <b>CD4</b> <b>T</b> <b>cells</b> in PBMC.|$|R
5000|$|The {{most famous}} Berlin patient is Timothy Ray Brown. He is {{originally}} from Seattle, Washington. He {{was diagnosed with}} HIV in 1995 and began antiretroviral therapy. In 2006, Timothy was diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). His physician, Dr. Gero Hütter, at Charité Hospital in Berlin, arranged for him to receive a hematopoietic stem cell transplant from a donor with the [...] "delta 32" [...] mutation on the CCR5 receptor. This mutation, found at relatively high frequencies in Northern Europeans (16%), results in a mutated CCR5 protein. The majority of HIV cannot enter a human cell without a functional CCR5 gene. An exception to {{this is a small}} minority of viruses that use alternate receptors, such as CXCR4 or CCR2. Those individuals who are homozygous for the CCR5 mutation are resistant to HIV and rarely progress to AIDS. Timothy received two stem cell transplants from one donor homozygous for the delta32 mutation: one in 2007 and one in 2008. Timothy stopped taking his antiretroviral medication on the day of his first transplant. Three months after the first stem cell transplant, levels of HIV rapidly plummeted to undetectable levels while his <b>CD4</b> <b>T</b> <b>cell</b> count increased. In addition, blood and tissue samples from areas of the body where HIV is known to hide were tested. The results were published in the New England Journal of Medicine. Today, Timothy still remains off antiretroviral therapy and is considered cured, though some debate exists whether there is no trace of the virus in his body (a [...] "sterilizing" [...] cure) or whether he simply no longer needs treatment (a [...] "functional" [...] cure).|$|E
50|$|In a {{mouse model}} of {{intracellular}} infection, L. monocytogenes induced PD-L1 protein expression in <b>T</b> <b>cells,</b> NK cells, and macrophages. PD-L1 blockade (using blocking antibodies) resulted in increased mortality for infected mice. Blockade reduced TNFα and nitric oxide production by macrophages, reduced granzyme B production by NK cells, and decreased proliferation of L. monocytogenes antigen-specific CD8 <b>T</b> <b>cells</b> (but not <b>CD4</b> <b>T</b> <b>cells).</b> This {{evidence suggests that}} PD-L1 acts as a positive costimulatory molecule in intracellular infection.|$|R
2500|$|It {{has been}} {{proposed}} that during the non-symptomatic phase of HIV infection, the virus has a relatively low affinity towards <b>T</b> <b>cells</b> (and has a higher affinity for macrophages), resulting in a slow kill rate of CD4+ <b>T</b> <b>cells</b> by the immune system [...] This is initially compensated for via the production of new helper <b>T</b> <b>cells</b> from the thymus (originally from the bone marrow). Once the virus becomes lymphotropic (or T-tropic) however, it begins to infect CD4+ <b>T</b> <b>cells</b> far more efficiently (likely due {{to a change in}} the co-receptors it binds to during infection), and the immune system is overwhelmed. Of note, recent studies suggest that only ~5% of the lymphoid-derived <b>CD4</b> <b>T</b> <b>cells</b> targeted by HIV are permissive and become productively infected with the virus. More than 95% of the <b>CD4</b> <b>T</b> <b>cells</b> that die are resting and are unable to support productive infection. These cells undergo abortive infection with HIV. Cell death is triggered when the host cell detects HIV foreign DNA intermediates and initiates a suicidal death pathway in an attempt to protect the host, leading to caspase-1 activation in inflammasomes, thus causing pyroptosis (a highly inflammatory form of programmed cell death).|$|R
5000|$|... p21 mediates the {{resistance}} of hematopoietic cells to an infection with HIV by complexing with the HIV integrase and thereby aborting chromosomal integration of the provirus. HIV infected individuals who naturally suppress viral replication have elevated levels of p21 and its associated mRNA. p21 expression affects at least two stages in the HIV life cycle inside <b>CD4</b> <b>T</b> <b>cells,</b> significantly limiting production of new viruses.|$|R
2500|$|Th2 {{helper cells}} are the host {{immunity}} effectors against extracellular [...] parasites including helminths. They are triggered by IL-4 and IL-12, and their effector cytokines are IL-4, IL-5, IL-9, IL-10 and IL-13. The main effector cells are eosinophils, basophils, and mast cells {{as well as}} B <b>cells,</b> and IL-4/IL-5 <b>CD4</b> <b>T</b> <b>cells.</b> The key Th2 transcription factors are STAT6 and GATA3. IL-4 is the positive feedback cytokine for Th2 cells differentiation. Besides, IL-4 stimulates B-cells to produce IgE antibodies, which in turn stimulate mast cells to release histamine, serotonin, and leukotriene to cause broncho-constriction, intestinal peristalsis, gastric fluid acidification to expel helminths. IL-5 from <b>CD4</b> <b>T</b> <b>cells</b> will activate eosinophils to attack helminths. IL-10 suppresses Th1 cells differentiation and function of dendritic cells. [...] Th2 overactivation against autoantigen will cause Type1 IgE-mediated allergy and hypersensitivity. Allergic rhinitis, atopic dermatitis, and asthma belong to this category of autoimmunity. [...] In addition to expressing different cytokines, Th2 cells also differ from Th1 cells in their cell surface glycans (oligosaccharides), which makes them less susceptible to some inducers of cell death.|$|R
50|$|There are {{two main}} ways that a virus is thought to enter the brain via hematogenous spread. The first is by infecting an immune cell, which then carries the virus to the nervous tissue. Viral {{examples}} of this include the JC virus which infects B cells and HIV which infects <b>CD4</b> <b>T</b> <b>cells</b> and macrophages to infiltrate the brain. The second is by crossing the blood capillaries as a free virus or in leukocytes.|$|R
