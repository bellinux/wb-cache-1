60|$|Since, therefore, {{the rate}} of wages which results from {{competition}} distributes the whole wages-fund among the whole laboring population, if law or opinion succeeds in fixing wages above this rate, some laborers are kept out of employment; and as {{it is not the}} intention of the philanthropists that these should starve, they must be provided for by a forced increase of the wages-fund—by a <b>compulsory</b> <b>saving.</b> It is nothing to fix a minimum of wages unless there be a provision that work, or wages at least, be found for all who apply for it. This, accordingly, is always part of the scheme, and is consistent with the ideas of more people than would approve of either a legal or a moral minimum of wages. Popular sentiment looks upon it as the duty of the rich, or of the state, to find employment for all the poor. If the moral influence of opinion does not induce the rich to spare from their consumption enough to set all the poor at work at “reasonable wages,” {{it is supposed to be}} incumbent on the state to lay on taxes for the purpose, either by local rates or votes of public money. The proportion between labor and the wages-fund would thus be modified to the advantage of the laborers, not by restriction of population, but by an increase of capital.|$|E

The literature argues that <b>compulsory</b> <b>savings</b> can be used in order to overcome this problem.

We explore how this might serve as a justification for a compulsory public pension system.

Beyond that point, increases in contribution rates simply result in increasingly regressive (implicit) taxation. Similar results are found for pay-as-you-go pensions. On the basis of our model we argue that the introduction of a funded pension component may help the German pension system to cope with demographic change more efficiently.

The definitive publisher-authenticated version Twentieth Century British History (1999) 10 (3) : 255 - 281 is available online at: [URL] article considers the evolution of John Maynard Keynes's wartime plan for <b>compulsory</b> <b>saving</b> in 1939 - 40, {{and the ways in}} which this was influenced by Keynes's desire to solicit the support of the Labour movement for the scheme. It is argued that he saw such support as the prerequisite of the plan's acceptance, and not only actively courted Labour and trade union leaders, but was willing to substantially amend his ideas in a 'socialist' direction in order to make them, as he hoped, 'outrageously attractive' to the Labour Party. Keynes's campaign to woo Labour, and the movement's broadly hostile reaction to the plan, are examined accordingly. It is argued that Labour's rejection of the scheme was largely the result of its genuine preference for physical controls on consumption, as opposed to the strategy of overall demand management favoured by Keynes; although other factors, such as the perceived likely political unpopularity of <b>compulsory</b> <b>saving,</b> played a part. It is finally suggested that, before the accession of the Chuchill coalition, which enabled a partial enactment of the scheme, the political conditions for the plan's acceptance did not exist...|$|E

In fact we prove that the analytical conditions that determine the choice between different plans are the same in the constrained and unconstrained case. ...|$|E

40|$|Many {{nations are}} seeking to reform their welfare states so that costs to the {{government}} can be reduced {{and the quality of}} outcomes improved. As a potential way to achieve these aims, there has been a surge of interest in the Singaporean model which features <b>compulsory</b> <b>savings</b> accounts and transparent pricing of health services. It has achieved some of the best health-care outcomes in the world at a cost that is the lowest amongst high income countries. In this paper we show how tax cuts can be designed to help establish <b>compulsory</b> <b>savings</b> accounts so that a publicly funded welfare system can be changed into one that relies more heavily on private funding in a politically feasible way. To our knowledge, showing how both a tax and welfare reform can be jointly designed to enable this transition to occur has not been done before. Our policy reform creates institutions that have features in common with Singaporean ones, especially for health-care. However there are also key differences. We present a new unified approach to the funding of health, retirement and risk-cover (for events like unemployment) through the establishment of a set of <b>compulsory</b> <b>savings</b> accounts. A case study of New Zealand is used as an illustration.

30|$|From {{the early}} days of independence, Singapore has adopted pro-business {{policies}} to attract foreign investments and nurture local entrepreneurship. Among these policies are low attractive corporate tax rates and tax breaks for new local and foreign corporations. As a small nation with no natural resources, Singapore saw it important that its citizens do not develop dependency on the nation to provide for their basic personal needs. Hence, a system of <b>compulsory</b> <b>saving</b> was implemented across the workforce, and saving was promoted in schools. With saving schemes, home ownership was made possible and this was further encouraged through subsidies from the government. Alongside with compulsory savings was a system of low taxes for individual income. Today, Singapore still maintains the lowest corporate and individual income tax rates in the world. Savings and home ownership are one of the highest in the world.|$|E
40|$|Estimating {{saving and}} {{fertility}} simultaneously by the VAR method, {{we find that}} social security cover has {{a positive effect on}} household saving, and a negative effect on fertility. In Germany, as in other countries where the hypothesis was tested, social security is thus good for growth. A possible explanation for this unconventional finding is that <b>compulsory</b> <b>saving</b> in the form of pension contributions tends to displace intra-family transfers, rather than asset formation. However, the negative effect of social security on fertility tends to erode the system’s own contributory base, because it reduces the number of future contributors. That {{is one of the reasons}} why, in Germany as elsewhere, pay-as-you-go pension systems tend to be financially unstable. To some extent, this is counteracted by child-related benefits, which tend to encourage fertility, but the effect appears to be weak. ...|$|E

40|$|On April 1, 1986, the Singapore {{government}} announced that resident investors or Central Provident Fund (CPF) members could use their compulsory savings in the CPF {{to invest in}} approved equity stocks, unit trusts, and gold. This policy was implemented on May 1, 1986. However, the list of 70 approved trustee stocks in which CPF members may invest their funds was not released until May 3, 1986. This paper studies {{the economic impact of}} the event of releasing the list of 70 approved trustee stocks on the returns of both the approved and the non-approved stocks. Two possible impact are suggested, namely the information effect and the liquidity constraint effect. A multivariate regression model as well as a traditional event study time series model are used to test for the presence of the two effects. We test for both the partial information release on April 1, and also the full information release on May 3. The results show that significant information effect was not present. However, there is evidence that liquidity constraint did exist before May 1, 1986. The paper draws two implications which may be useful to policymakers. Firstly, the releasing of information in stages can effectively reduce informational impact on the stock market. Secondly, the existence of a liquidity constraint implies that <b>compulsory</b> <b>saving</b> schemes may cause investors, the savers, to hold more riskfree assets than they really desire...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{investigate}} pension preferences {{and the effect}} of individual freedom of choice on risk taking in the context of pension arrangements based on a representative survey of about 1000 Dutch citizens. The attitude towards pension schemes and portfolio choices is explained by individual characteristics. Our main conclusions are the following. Risk aversion is domain dependent and highest in the pension domain. The vast majority of respondents is in favour of <b>compulsory</b> <b>saving</b> for retirement and favours a defined benefit pension system. If offered a combined defined benefit/defined contribution system, the majority of the respondents {{would like to have a}} guaranteed pension income of 70 % or more of their net labour income. Self-assessed risk tolerance and financial expertise are important explanatory variables of pension system attitude. Respondents are on average conservative in their investment policy. If given investor autonomy, they are willing to change the composition of their retirement savings portfolio in response to their personal financial situation, general economic conditions, and expectations of financial markets. Respondents may be inconsistent in their preferences. Especially respondents who have chosen a relatively safe portfolio (less stock, more bonds) appear to prefer the retirement income streams of the median investment portfolio to their own portfolio choice. Finally, the average respondent considers himself financially unsophisticated, but is not very eager to take control of retirement savings investment when offered the possibility to increase expertise. ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{estimates}} the demand curves faced individually by each pension fund management firm that serves <b>compulsory</b> <b>saving</b> for old age in Chile, in 1993 - 2002. These firms –Administradoras de Fondos de Pensiones, AFP- sell their services by retail methods, contacting each client separately. The service {{is also a}} subscription service, so demand refers both to the inflow of new subscribers and the outflow of separations. The paper presents two specifications with different degrees of aggregation: a panel where for each firm the rival firms are aggregated together, and a more detailed panel for a specific AFP where rival firms are disaggregated. The specific firm is chosen {{to be a large}} AFP whose participants have the highest taxable earnings and may be more informed. In the first panel, the finding for 1993 - 97 is that the effective elasticity of demand faced by each firm is less tan 1. 0 (in absolute value). In the panel for relatively more informed participants, the effective elasticity in 1993 - 97 was slightly larger tan one, implying an optimal margin of 70 % above marginal cost. For the period that starts in December 1997, after important regulatory changes, the effective elasticity for the panel for relatively more informed participants fell to 0. 10 and in the other panel remained below 1. 0. Together, these results show that in Chile competition between pension funds has occurred without competition in prices throughout 1993 - 2002, and that competition in prices weakened further after 1998.
