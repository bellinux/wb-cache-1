5|$|COPD {{is a type}} of obstructive {{lung disease}} in which chronic incompletely {{reversible}} poor airflow (airflow limitation) and inability to breathe out fully (air trapping) exist. The poor airflow is the result of breakdown of lung tissue (known as emphysema) and small airways disease (known as obstructive bronchiolitis). The relative <b>contributions</b> <b>of</b> these two factors vary between people. Severe destruction of small airways can lead to the formation of large air pockets—known as bullae—that replace lung tissue. This form of disease is called bullous emphysema.|$|E

40|$|Background : Research {{has shown}} that the {{prevalence}} of unmarried cohabitation has increased in most Latin American countries and that childbearing within consensual union, traditionally confined to low-income groups, is becoming socially acceptable among highly educated women. Objective : We focus on the increasing importance of childbearing within consensual union for overall fertility. We measure the relative <b>contribution</b> <b>of</b> births within marriage and births within consensual union to period fertility as a component of population change for 13 Latin American countries from 1980 to 2010. Methods : We use census data and the own-children method to estimate the <b>contribution</b> <b>of</b> marriage and consensual union to age-specific fertility rates, to cumulative fertility, and to the TFR. Results : In most Latin American countries the <b>contribution</b> <b>of</b> marriage to age-specific fertility rates has decreased over time, whereas the <b>contribution</b> <b>of</b> consensual union has increased steadily. In Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Costa Rica, and Mexico the <b>contribution</b> <b>of</b> marriage to the TFR is still larger than the <b>contribution</b> <b>of</b> consensual union. In Ecuador and Uruguay they have become roughly similar. In Brazil, Colombia, Cuba, Panama, Peru, and Venezuela the <b>contribution</b> <b>of</b> consensual union to the TFR is larger than that of marriage. Conclusions : In Latin America, fertility, as a component of population change, is less and less related to marriage and increasingly linked to consensual union instead. Comments : We found that not only the <b>contribution</b> <b>of</b> births within consensual union, but also the <b>contribution</b> <b>of</b> out-of-union births to overall fertility has been increasing over time. This is a finding worth investigating further...|$|R
