2500|$|This United States Supreme Court case {{occurred}} when an American Indian {{shot and killed}} a non-Indian. [...] The {{question of whether or}} not the United States Supreme Court had jurisdiction over this issue arose. [...] In an effort to argue against the Supreme <b>Court</b> <b>having</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> over the proceedings, the defendant filed a petition seeking a writ of certiorari. [...] This request for judicial review, upon writ of error, was denied. [...] The court held that a conviction for murder, punishable with death, was no less a conviction for a capital crime by reason even taking into account the fact that the jury qualified the punishment. [...] The American Indian defendant was sentenced to life in prison.|$|E
50|$|In {{criminal}} matters a district <b>court</b> <b>has</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> over all offences except treason, murder and rape, and a regional <b>court</b> <b>has</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> over all offences except treason. A district court can impose {{a fine of}} not more than R120,000 or a prison sentence of not more than three years, while a regional court can impose a fine of not more than R600,000 or a prison sentence of not more than 15 years, except that for certain offences a regional court can also impose a life sentence. In civil matters a district <b>court</b> <b>has</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> where {{the value of the}} claim is R200,000 or less, while a regional <b>court</b> <b>has</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> where the value of the claim is between R200,000 and R400,000.

2500|$|However, {{there is}} a more limited meaning to the term. In most provinces, the [...] "Provincial Court" [...] is the term used to refer to a {{specific}} court created by the Province which is the main criminal <b>court,</b> <b>having</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> over most criminal offences except for the most serious ones. The Provincial Court of a particular province may also have a limited civil jurisdiction, over small claims and some family law matters. The exact scope of the jurisdiction of a Provincial Court will depend on the laws enacted by the particular province. [...] Provincial Courts in this sense are courts of limited statutory jurisdiction, sometimes referred to as [...] "inferior courts". As courts of limited jurisdiction, their decisions are potentially subject to judicial review by the superior courts via the prerogative writs, but in most cases there are now well-established statutory rights of appeal instead.|$|E
6000|$|The {{second book}} is very curious. In it Dante endeavors to {{demonstrate}} the divine right of the Roman Empire to universal sovereignty. One of his arguments is, that Christ consented to be born under the reign of Augustus; another, that he assented to the imperial jurisdiction in allowing himself to be crucified under a decree {{of one of its}} courts. The atonement could not have been accomplished unless Christ suffered under sentence of a <b>court</b> <b>having</b> <b>jurisdiction,</b> for otherwise his condemnation would have been an injustice and not a penalty. Moreover, since all mankind was typified in the person of Christ, the court must have been one having jurisdiction over all mankind; and since he was delivered to Pilate, an officer of Tiberius, it must follow that the jurisdiction of Tiberius was universal. He draws an argument also from the wager of battle to prove that the Roman Empire was divinely permitted, at least, if not instituted. For since it is admitted that God gives the victory, and since the Romans always won it, therefore it was God's will that the Romans should attain universal empire. In the third book he endeavors to prove that the emperor holds by divine right, and not by permission of the pope. He assigns supremacy to the pope in spirituals, and to the emperor in temporals. This was a delicate subject, and though the king of Saxony (a Catholic) says that Dante did not overstep the limits of orthodoxy, it was on account of this part of the book that it was condemned as heretical.[61] ...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} {{three areas}} in which there have been important developments concerning the automatic stay of the U. S. Bankruptcy law, provided by 11 U. S. C. § 362. The {{first part of the}} thesis addresses and analyses the question whether state <b>courts</b> <b>have</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> to determine their own jurisdiction when the automatic stay is at issue. The consensus, however, now seems to favor the traditional and correct view, that while bankruptcy <b>courts</b> alone <b>have</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> to lift or modify the stay, state <b>courts,</b> <b>have</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> to determine whether the stay does or does not cut off its jurisdiction to reach the merits of a case. The second topic is whether a state <b>court</b> <b>has</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> to impose sanctions for an alleged violation of the stay. The analysis, with the help of case laws will show that even if a state court or another federal <b>court</b> <b>has</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> to determine whether the stay applies, only the bankruptcy court where the case is pending <b>has</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> to impose sanctions for violating the stay. The third part of the thesis explains and analyses issues concerning repossession of property by a creditor before the filing of a bankruptcy petition...|$|R
