5|$|Arsenal made an {{indifferent}} {{start to}} their league campaign with four consecutive draws {{from their first}} five matches. After defeat to Aston Villa in December 1998, the team embarked on a 19 match unbeaten run to steadily <b>climb</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> league table. A 6-1 win against Middlesbrough in April 1999 moved Arsenal {{to the top of}} the table for the first time in the season and victory against Tottenham Hotspur put the team three points clear as main challenger United drew with Liverpool. Both Arsenal and Manchester United went into the final two games of the league season on the same number of points, but the latter's defeat to Leeds United all but ended their chances of retaining the title.|$|E
5|$|Choding Khang is the hermitage {{located just}} behind the Great Assembly Hall (on the hill slope of Sera Utse). This is where Je Tsongkhapa meditated. The hermitage is {{accessed}} through a track where painted rock carvings of Tsongkhapa, Jamchen and Dharma Raja (the protector) are seen flanking the stepped approaches, along the route. A new building has been constructed {{in place of the}} old hermitage, which was destroyed during the Revolution. Below the hermitage are the Upper Tantric College (Gyuto) and Lower Tantric College (Gyu-me) of Lhasa). A further <b>climb</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> hill leads to caves where Tsongkhapa meditated.|$|E

5|$|To have {{a chance}} of winning a competition, two {{consistently}} good jumps must be made. If an athlete finds themselves in an uncompetitive position after the first round, their challenge in the second round is to make up ground via the attrition of other athletes, their own distance and style points, and wind/gate compensation. For an athlete who had a poor jump in round one, it is possible for them to <b>climb</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> order in round two with an excellent jump, and if other competitors fall by the wayside. Conversely, a high-scoring athlete may lose their advantage from round one if their second jump is not up to par.|$|E
5|$|Arsenal {{ended the}} {{previous}} season as runners-up to Manchester United in the Premier League. The club made an indifferent {{start to the}} campaign as reigning league champions and failed to progress past the group stages of the UEFA Champions League. After defeat to Aston Villa in December 1998, Arsenal embarked on a 19 match unbeaten run (21 in all competitions) to <b>climb</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> league table. The run in all competitions ended against Manchester United in a FA Cup semi-final replay. In April Arsenal moved {{to the top of}} the Premier League after beating Middlesbrough 6–1, albeit having played a match more than Manchester United. A 3–1 away win against Tottenham Hotspur put Arsenal three points clear as United lost to Liverpool on the same night. Going into the final two matches of the season, both clubs were on the same points, but Arsenal's defeat to Leeds United all but ended their chances of retaining the title.|$|E
5|$|For {{the main}} event, the CMLL ring crew quickly erected a 15-foot tall steel cage {{around the ring}} as the {{participants}} were introduced. The match {{started out with a}} 10-minute period where no one would be allowed to leave the cage, forcing the two Infernales squads to fight each other. When the 10 minutes were up Tarzan Boy was quick to <b>climb</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> cage and over the top, escaping while everyone else was fighting. Moments later he was joined by teammate Rey Bucanero. Mephisto was the first to escape the cage for his team, leaving four men in the ring. Moments later both Último Guerrero and Averno climbed out of the cage. This left El Satánico to fight Máscara Mágica where the only way to win was to pin their opponent or force them to submit. In the end, the veteran Satánico forced his masked opponent to submit to win the match and the Los Infernales name. Afterwards Máscara Mágica removed his mask per the Lucha de Apuestas stipulations and revealed his birth name, Antonio Gómez Medina, formerly known as Talismán Jr.|$|E

5|$|In {{the fifth}} match Matt Hardy faced Edge, who was {{accompanied}} by Lita, inside a Steel Cage. As the bell rang, Hardy tried to throw Edge face-first into the cage wall but didn't succeed. Back and forth action took place until Hardy got the advantage over Edge. Lita began to <b>climb</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> outside of the cage, but Hardy hit the cage, making Lita fall off. As Lita distracted Hardy, Edge started to crawl out. Hardy noticed this, grabbed Edge, and threw him into a corner. Lita interfered, which led to Hardy delivering a Twist of Fate to Lita. Edge executed a Spear on Hardy for a near-fall. After knocking Edge off the turnbuckle, Hardy delivered a leg drop {{off the top of}} the cage before pinning Edge for the win.|$|E
5|$|There {{were two}} {{other reasons for}} the Syrian withdrawal. The 3rd Battalion from the Palmach's Yiftach Brigade had been sent by boat during the {{previous}} night across the sea to Ein Gev, planning to assault and capture Kafr Harib. It was, noticed and shelled by the Syrians, {{but one of the}} companies managed to <b>climb</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> Golan. It carried out a smaller raid at dawn, bombing water carriers and threatening the Syrian 1st Brigade's line of communications. The second reason was that they were running out of ammunition: Husni al-Za'im had been promised replenishment, and attacked Degania short of ammunition. Za'im ordered a withdrawal when his troops ran out of ammunition. The replenishment was instead sent to the 2nd Brigade further north. The Israelis were not aware of this, and attributed the Syrian withdrawal to surprise at the Israeli artillery fire.|$|E

25|$|Insulated glazing forms a {{very compact}} {{multi-layer}} sandwich {{of air and}} glass, which {{eliminates the need for}} storm windows. Screens may also be left installed year-round with insulated glazing, and can be installed in a manner that permits installation and removal from inside the building, eliminating the requirement to <b>climb</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> exterior of the house to service the windows. It is possible to retrofit insulated glazing into traditional double-hung frames, though this would require significant modification to the wood frame due to the increased thickness of the IG assembly.|$|E
25|$|Simeon {{wanted to}} run away from society, so he acted. In order {{to get away from the}} {{ever-increasing}} number of people who came to him for prayers and advice, leaving him little if any time for his private austerities, Simeon discovered a pillar which had survived among ruins in Telanissa (modern-day Taladah in Syria), and formed a small platform at the top. He determined to live out his life on this platform. For sustenance small boys from the nearby village would <b>climb</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> pillar and pass him parcels of flat bread and goats' milk. He may also have pulled up food in buckets via a pulley.|$|E

25|$|The Quaid Post {{was located}} at an {{altitude}} of 22,153 feet. It was extremely difficult to attack, as it was surrounded by 457 m high ice walls. It had an inclination of 80° to 85° on three sides, and a little less on the fourth side. It was very difficult for the attackers to <b>climb</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> peak without getting noticed by the Pakistani soldiers stationed at the top. The scarcity of oxygen made walking long distances difficult, as the troops had to halt every few meters to regain their breath. There were also frequent blizzards, and taking advantage of poor visibility at night was difficult due to the wind chill factor. The minimum temperatures in the area were as low as -50°C at that time.|$|E
25|$|The {{tower was}} {{designed}} and supervised by Nasreddin Murat-Khan, an architect and engineer hailing from Daghistan. The structural design was performed by Nasreddin Murat-Khan (a qualified engineer himself), assisted by Engineer Abdur Rehman Khan Niazi, who was working as Structural Design Engineer for Illeri N. Murat-Khan & Associates. Approved by the President, the design was built by Mian Abdul Khaliq and Company. The foundation stone was laid on 23 March 1960. Construction took eight years, and was completed on 21 October 1968 at an estimated cost of Rs 7,058,000. The money was collected by imposing an additional tax on cinema and horse racing tickets at the demand of Akhtar Hussain, governor of West Pakistan. Today, the minaret provides a panoramic view to visitors who can't <b>climb</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> stairs or access the top, {{by means of an}} elevator. The parks around the monument include marble fountains and an artificial lake.|$|E
25|$|The Islanders {{continued}} their <b>climb</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> standings in 1975–76, earning 101 points and the fifth-best {{record in the}} league. It was the first 100-point season in Islanders history, in only their fourth year of existence. Rookie center Trottier finished the season scoring 95 points and winning the Calder Trophy; his points and assists (63) totals set a new league record for most in each category by a rookie. It {{would be the first}} of four consecutive 100-point seasons, including the first two division titles in franchise history. Despite the emergence of young star players and regular season success between 1976 and 1979 the Islanders suffered a series of playoff disappointments. In 1976 and 1977, the Islanders were knocked out in the semi-finals by eventual Stanley Cup champions, the Montreal Canadiens. The Canadiens posted a 24–3 record in the playoffs during those two years with all three losses coming from the Islanders.|$|E
