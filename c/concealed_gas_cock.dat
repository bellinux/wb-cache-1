50|$|By mid-1878 Bartlett {{introduced}} several devices {{which enabled}} lamplighting via electricity which he produced from an office at 950 Broadway. There were three inventions which each {{related to the}} other. One was an electric <b>gas</b> <b>cock</b> and lighter, which was controlled {{by the hand and}} which could be adjusted upon any gas fixture. The second was an automatic <b>gas</b> <b>cock</b> and lighter used in street lights and buildings. The third was an electric signal. As an experiment the lamps around Madison Square were fitted with automatic lighters. Each could be lighted or extinguished in a short time by placing a finger on the button of a battery at the office at 950 Broadway. Also the battery could be connected to a clock and the lights extinguished in just a moment.|$|R
50|$|Before <b>gassing,</b> <b>cock</b> {{the marker}} by pulling back the cocking handle (located {{near the front}} of the marker {{on the left side of}} the receiver). This pulls back the front and rear bolts and allows access to chamber while also {{ensuring}} that the valve is not being depressed by the rear bolt when the propellant supply is screwed in, which would result in a leak. A click should be heard. Release the cocking handle.|$|R
50|$|The Action T4 organisers, Viktor Brack and Karl Brandt, {{ordered that}} the {{execution}} of the sick had to be carried out by medical doctors because Hitler's memorandum of authorisation of 1 September 1939 only referred to doctors. The operation of the gas tap was thus the responsibility of doctors in the death centres. However, {{during the course of the}} euthanasia programme, the <b>gas</b> <b>cocks</b> were occasionally operated by others in the absence of the doctors or for other reasons. Also, many doctors used pseudonyms rather than their real names in the documents.|$|R
5|$|The Nikkatsu Company {{made three}} popular Sun Tribe films in 1956, a genre {{based on a}} {{contemporary}} youth subculture whose interests revolved around beach life, jazz music and their progressive attitudes towards sex. The films met with moral public outcries and a fourth production was shut down {{at the behest of}} Eirin (The Motion Picture Code of Ethics Committee). However, the genre later experienced a resurgence which included The Warped Ones. The film marked director Koreyoshi Kurahara's first collaboration with screenwriter Nobuo Yamada. They reused many elements of Kurahara's earlier Sun Tribe film The Time of Youth (1959), including abortion, a near fatality via an opened <b>gas</b> <b>cock</b> and a criminal act near water, an explosion beside a stream in the former and the rape on the beach in the latter.|$|R
5000|$|On 6 December, 2 {{men were}} {{detained}} by Euromaidan self-defense units in Kiev, who were carrying <b>concealed</b> <b>gas</b> pistols. The men {{were described as}} appearing as fitting the typical titushky profile. The same day MP of her party Batkivshchyna Andriy Kozhemiakin claimed to have information on preparations for faking jailed former Ukrainian Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko's abduction from Central Clinical Hospital No. 5 in Kharkiv to discredit the opposition. On 8 December Batkivshchyna claimed to have information regarding [...] "authorities plans to provoke clashes in Kiev with the involvement of about a thousand young people with a sports background {{in order to find}} a reason to announce a state of emergency; this may happen as soon as today".|$|R
50|$|A {{trespasser}} that Dr. Minimizer captured for sneaking {{into his}} laboratory and for almost escaping with the {{ideas for the}} Minimizer Ray without permission. He has green skin and half of his face is <b>concealed</b> by a <b>gas</b> mask. His attacks are Virus Splat and Super Sneeze. He can be unlocked by winning all the races on the 6th round.|$|R
5000|$|The Court's {{ruling in}} this case rests {{on the fact that}} the search at issue {{in this case}} took place at the {{international}} border. [...] "The Government's interest in preventing the entry of unwanted persons and effects is at its zenith at the international border." [...] In light of the Government's interest in protecting its sovereignty and territorial integrity, [...] "searches made at the border... are reasonable simply by virtue of the fact that they occur at the border." [...] Indeed, the statute authorizing the search in this case derived ultimately from a statute first passed in 1789. Smugglers frequently attempt to penetrate the border â€” in the five and a half years preceding the decision in this case, 18,788 drug seizures had occurred at the ports of entry in southern California. This meant that people and drugs <b>concealed</b> in <b>gas</b> tanks were discovered at the ports of San Ysidro or Otay Mesa on average once every ten days.|$|R
50|$|Batman rescues {{the true}} Robin {{when he tells}} Him that Molly is Dead, but the Riddler manages to escape to the Moldavian Pavilion, where a {{gathering}} will honor the famous Mammoth of Moldavia, which is stuffed with used, yet priceless Moldavian postage stamps. The Riddler plans to steal the mammoth, and so he drenches the pavilion with nitrous oxide, dresses in a green and pink tuxedo costume and elephant mask which <b>conceals</b> his <b>gas</b> mask, and entertains the guests with a few jokes until everyone has fallen unconscious from laughter. The Riddler and the Mole Hill mob blast a hole through the floor and make ready to steal the priceless pachyderm when Batman and Robin leap out from inside the elephant and subdue the mob; whilst The Riddler runs for the man hole and leaps into it. Batman leaps after him, and Riddler shoots at him, misses, and hits a tank of noxious oxide causing it to explode, but not before Batman takes cover. The Riddler's body was never recovered, so it was assumable he would live to plague Gotham City another day, but not if Batman and Robin can help it.|$|R
5000|$|Dodds has prophetic dreams {{which come}} to him as cryptic, {{ambiguous}} visions of crimes. Originally of unexplained origin, these dreams were later ascribed to encounter between Dodds and the entity known as Dream via retcon. The visions haunt Wes, who uses his keen intellect and amateur detective skills to properly interpret them. He is also a talented chemist and inventor, creating the sand-like substance and the Silicoid Gun ultimately responsible for transforming Sandy the Golden Boy into a Silicon-based life-form. In {{the early years of}} his career, Wesley Dodds possesses the strength level of a man who engages in regular exercise, and was a fine hand-to-hand combatant. As he grows older, his strength level diminishes in relative proportion to his age. As hobbies, Wes enjoys reading, writing, poetry, origami and philosophy. Through an unknown process, Wes passes his power of prophetic visions on to his former ward, Sanderson Hawkins upon the moment of his own death. Wesley Dodds' costume consists of a basic green business suit, fedora, a World War I era gas mask, a gas gun, and a wire gun. The gas mask protects Dodds from the effects of the gas emitted from his gas gun. The gas gun, a handheld device fitted with cartridges containing concentrated sleeping gas, is Wesley Dodds' only known weapon. Pressing the trigger on the gun releases a cloud of green dust rendering all within the Sandman's immediate vicinity unconscious. An upgraded canister dispenser for the gun is provided for him by his close friend and confidante, Lee Travis. Wes is also known to <b>conceal</b> smaller knockout <b>gas</b> capsules in a hollow heel on his shoe. These prove ideal when placed in situations where his gas gun is not readily available. He also makes use of a specially designed [...] "wirepoon" [...] gun, which fires a length of thin, steel cable.|$|R
