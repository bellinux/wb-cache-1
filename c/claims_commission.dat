5|$|The Treaties of 1823 and 1826, {{although}} fraudulent {{at their}} roots, {{were allowed to}} stand.

5|$|The Menominee sued in the U.S. Court of Claims {{to recover}} {{compensation}} {{for the loss of}} their hunting and fishing rights. The Court of Claims first clarified that the Menominee Termination Act did not abolish the tribe or its membership, but merely ended federal supervision of the tribe. Since the Menominee was still a tribe, although not one under federal trusteeship, the tribe had a right to assert a claim arising out of the Wolf River Treaty in accordance with the Indian <b>Claims</b> <b>Commission</b> Act and the Tucker Act.|$|E
5|$|In 1927, the California {{legislature}} {{passed a}} statute authorizing the California Attorney General to bring claims {{on behalf of}} the tribes in the Court of Claims. The next year, Congress passed a statute granting that court jurisdiction for such claims. California Attorney General Earl Warren (future Chief Justice) finally argued the case in 1941. The court found liability but indicated it would not award pre-judgment interest, and the Supreme Court declined to grant certiorari. Warren negotiated a $5M settlement. After the passage of the Indian <b>Claims</b> <b>Commission</b> Act, the same group of tribes struggled to bring a single action for recovery under the broader claims allowed under the ICCA, which settled for $29M.|$|E

25|$|In the 1951 case, the Indian <b>Claims</b> <b>Commission</b> {{acknowledged}} {{there might}} have been discrimination by the tribe against certain mixed-blood descendants such as Barada; however, the court dismissed the case {{on the grounds that the}} Indian <b>Claims</b> <b>Commission</b> did not have jurisdiction over a group claim of individual members; rather, its responsibilities were to adjudicate claims of tribes against the government. The federal government has continued to defer to the federally recognized tribes' sovereignty to determine their own rules for membership and eligibility for voting and benefits.|$|E

40|$|After getting Constantinople {{back the}} emperor Michael VIII Palaeologus created {{powerful}} navy {{to ensure the}} defense of the Empire. Development of the navy made the recruitment necessary. The first Byzantine crews were formed with Gasmuli (descendants of cross marriages between the Byzantines and the Latin’s). The Byzantine navy was very successful in battles with Venetians, who suffered from the Greek pirates attacks. The last quarter of the XIII century was the time for the rise of the Greek sea robbery. The main data about Byzantine piracy can be found in The Venetian <b>Claim</b> <b>Commission</b> of 1278. There are detailed reports about pirates attacks in the Aegean Sea in this document. The Venetian <b>Claim</b> <b>Commission</b> of 1278 contains the Greek and non-Greek names of pirates. Perhaps some pirates were of Italian descent. The main pirates centers were Rhodes, Monemvasia, Anaea...|$|R
25|$|The FCSC was {{established}} in 1954 (Reorganization Plan No. 1 (5 U.S.C.

In all, more than 660,000 claims have been adjudicated, with awards totaling in the billions of dollars.|$|E

25|$|Prior to 1946, Native American {{land claims}} were {{explicitly}} barred from Claims Courts by statute. The Indian <b>Claims</b> <b>Commission</b> Act of 1946 (ICCA) created forum of Indian land claims before the Indian <b>Claims</b> <b>Commission</b> (subsequently merged into the United States Court of Claims, {{and then the}} United States Court of Federal Claims). However, the ICCA created a four-year statute of limitations. Moreover, the ICC and its successors may award only money damages, and cannot—for example—title land. Finally, the ICCA is the exclusive forum to pursue claims against the federal government.|$|E

50|$|The {{origins of}} Kingsland {{are linked to}} the European {{settlement}} of Auckland. In 1835, Thomas Mitchell, a Sydney trader, purchased land from Āpihai Te Kawau, rangatira (chief) of the local Māori tribe, Ngati Whatua, for £160, in a transaction which the Lands <b>Claim</b> <b>Commission</b> later disallowed. In 1841, Te Kawau gifted 3000 acre to the colonial government and Auckland began to take shape as a city.|$|R
25|$|The two tribes {{share many}} {{cultural}} characteristics.

25|$|In the 1940s, {{more than}} 100 {{descendants}} of freedmen from the Wallace Roll, Kern-Clifton Roll, and the Dawes Rolls formed the Cherokee Freedmen's Association. The organization filed a petition with the Indian <b>Claims</b> <b>Commission</b> in 1951 over their exclusion from citizenship, but the petition was denied in 1961. The Indian <b>Claims</b> <b>Commission</b> stated that their claims to tribal citizenship were individual {{in nature and}} outside the U.S. government's jurisdiction. The Cherokee Freedmen's Association was faced with two issues regarding their case. On one hand, the Dawes Rolls, a federally mandated tally, was accepted as defining who were legally and politically Cherokee {{and most of the}} CFA members were not of Dawes Rolls descent. On the other, the courts saw their claims as a tribal matter and outside of their jurisdiction. Appeals stretched to 1971, but all were denied with only few legal victories to show for their twenty-year effort.|$|E

25|$|The {{articles}} of a February 1853 Treaty of Claims between Great Britain and the United States included {{the claims of}} slave-owners who had suffered financially through the British liberation of slaves in the Enterprise, Hermosa, and Creole incidents.

25|$|The {{incident}} heightened fears among settlers of {{an armed}} Māori insurrection.

In 1844 a land <b>claims</b> <b>commission</b> investigation determined that the Wairau Valley had not been legally sold. The government was to pay compensation to the Rangitane iwi, determined to be the original owners.|$|E
25|$|The unique {{conditions}} attendant to {{the creation}} of the state led the Federal government to sometimes regard West Virginia as differing from the other border states in the post-war and Reconstruction Era. The terms of surrender granted to the Confederate army at Appomattox applied to the soldiers of the 11 Confederate states and West Virginia only. Returning Confederate soldiers from the other border states were required to obtain special permits from the War Department. Similarly, the Southern <b>Claims</b> <b>Commission</b> was originally designed to apply only to the 11 Confederate states and West Virginia, though claims from other states were sometimes honored.|$|E
