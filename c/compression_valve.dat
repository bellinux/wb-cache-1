5000|$|Also {{known as}} a [...] "two-tube" [...] shock absorber, this device {{consists}} of two nested cylindrical tubes, an inner tube that is called the [...] "working tube" [...] or the [...] "pressure tube", and an outer tube called the [...] "reserve tube". At {{the bottom of the}} device on the inside is a <b>compression</b> <b>valve</b> or base valve. When the piston is forced up or down by bumps in the road, hydraulic fluid moves between different chambers via small holes or [...] "orifices" [...] in the piston and via the valve, converting the [...] "shock" [...] energy into heat which must then be dissipated.|$|E
5000|$|The {{next phase}} in shock {{absorber}} evolution was {{the development of}} a shock absorber that could sense and respond to not just situational changes from [...] "bumpy" [...] to [...] "smooth" [...] but to individual bumps in the road in a near instantaneous reaction. This was achieved through a change {{in the design of the}} <b>compression</b> <b>valve,</b> and has been termed [...] "acceleration sensitive damping" [...] or [...] "ASD". Not only does this result in a complete disappearance of the [...] "comfort vs. control" [...] tradeoff, it also reduced pitch during vehicle braking and roll during turns. However, ASD shocks are usually only available as aftermarket changes to a vehicle and are only available from a limited number of manufacturers.|$|E

5000|$|Compression {{testing is}} a crude form of leak-down testing which also {{includes}} effects due to <b>compression</b> ratio, <b>valve</b> timing, cranking speed, and other factors.

5000|$|The {{principal}} design {{alternative to}} the twin-tube form has been the mono-tube shock absorber which was considered a revolutionary advancement when it appeared in the 1950s. As its name implies, the mono-tube shock, {{which is also a}} gas-pressurized shock and also comes in a coilover format, consists of only one tube, the pressure tube, though it has two pistons. These pistons are called the working piston and the dividing or floating piston, and they move in relative synchrony inside the pressure tube in response to changes in road smoothness. The two pistons also completely separate the shock's fluid and gas components. The mono-tube shock absorber is consistently a much longer overall design than the twin-tubes, making it difficult to mount in passenger cars designed for twin-tube shocks. However, unlike the twin-tubes, the mono-tube shock can be mounted either way— it does not have any directionality. [...] It also does not have a <b>compression</b> <b>valve,</b> whose role has been taken up by the dividing piston, and although it contains nitrogen gas, the gas in a mono-tube shock is under high pressure (260-360 p.s.i. or so) which can actually help it to support some of the vehicle's weight, something which no other shock absorber is designed to do.|$|E
40|$|The {{relevance}} of the research {{is due to the}} necessity to create pneumatic rock drills with low air consumption. The article analyzes the reasons for low efficiency of percussive machines. The authors state that applying a single distribution body in the percussive mechanism does not allow carrying out a low-energy operating cycle of the mechanism. Using the studied device as an example, it is substantiated that applying a <b>compression</b> <b>valve</b> with two distribution bodies separately operating the working chambers makes it possible to significantly reduce the airflow. The authors describe the construction of a core drill percussive mechanism and the operation of a <b>compression</b> <b>valve.</b> It is shown that in the new percussive mechanism working chambers are cut off the circuit by the time when exhaust windows are opened by the piston and air is not supplied into the cylinder up to 20 % of the cycle time. The air flow rate of the new mechanism was 3. 8 m 3 /min. In comparison with the drill PK- 75, the overall noise level of the new machine is lower by 8 - 10 dB, while the percussive mechanism efficiency is 2. 3 times higher...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Low venous tone (LVT) {{occurs when}} the veins in the lower limbs can no longer {{sufficiently}} pump enough blood back to the heart. Symptoms may include dull aching and cramping, itching or tingling in the calves, swelling redness or any colour changes as well as thickening of the skin in the lower limbs (Comerota, 2009). The most common indication of LVT is dilated veins known as varicose veins(Glovicski et al., 2011). LVT is a disorder found more commonly in females. Conventional treatment for LVT includes vein ligation or stripping, elastic <b>compression,</b> <b>valve</b> reconstruction and sclerotherapy venous bypass(Van den Bos et al., 2009). Amongst other treatment, exercise has also proven to be effective as it increases circulation, by increasing blood returning to the heart (Behrens and Michlovitz, 2006). A variety of herbal supplements have been proven {{to be safe and}} effective in the treatment of LVT. A combination complementary medication of red leaf extract, butcher’s broom extract, horse chestnut extract and vitamin B 6 has been formulated as an over-thecounter product in South Africa, to treat LVT without any anticipated adverse effects (Venavine-Nativa, 2014). Red vine leaf extract has also been proven to be useful in the treatment of LVT. Previous studies on the red vine leaf extract have shown that it is an effective and safe source of treatment (Kaluset al., 2004). Studies done on horse chestnut extract have stated that the extract increases venous tone and decreases capillary permeability, and butcher’s broom extract has been proven to be effective in the treatment of LVT (Lim and Davies, 2009). There are currently no studies done on the combination of red vine leaf extract, butcher’s broom extract, horse chestnut extract and vitamin B 6 on symptoms associated with LVT. The aim {{of this study is to}} determine the efficacy of a combination complementary medication of red vine leaf extract (360 mg), horse chestnut extract (60 mg), butcher’s broom extract (35 mg) and pyridoxine (vitamin B 6) (3. 2 mg) in the treatment of symptoms associated with LVT, using a venous clinical severity score questionnaire (VCSS).

50|$|Further {{development}} in the thermal blast technique {{was made by the}} introduction of a valve between the expansion and compression volumes. When interrupting low currents the valve opens under the effect of the overpressure generated in the compression volume. The blow-out of the arc is made as in a puffer circuit breaker thanks to the compression of the gas obtained by the piston action. In the case of high currents interruption, the arc energy produces a high overpressure in the expansion volume, which leads to the closure of the valve and thus isolating the expansion volume from the compression volume. The overpressure necessary for breaking is obtained by the optimal use of the thermal effect and of the nozzle clogging effect produced whenever the cross-section of the arc significantly reduces the exhaust of gas in the nozzle. In order to avoid excessive energy consumption by gas <b>compression,</b> a <b>valve</b> is fitted on the piston in order to limit the overpressure in the compression to a value necessary for the interruption of low short circuit currents.|$|R

This engine has been fully described in NACA-TR- 250. Tests were made at an engine speed of 1, 400 R. P. M. for compression ratios ranging from 4. 0 to 7. 6. The air-fuel ratios were on the rich side of the chemically correct mixture and were approximately those giving maximum power. When using plain domestic gasoline, detonation was controlled to a constant, predetermined amount (audible), such as would be permissible for continuous operation, by (a) throttling the carburetor, (b) maintaining full throttle but greatly retarding the ignition, and (c) varying {{the timing of the}} inlet valve to reduce the effective compression ratio.

40|$|Abstract: Compression {{pressure}} of individual cylinder and valve timing have big influence on combustion pressure, indicated {{mean effective pressure}} (IMEP), emission, vibration, combustion noise and many other combustion parameters. Therefore, uniformity of <b>compression</b> pressure and <b>valve</b> timing became one of most important engine design and production standard. Conventional method to evaluate compression pressure uniformity is to measure each cylinder pressure by mechanical pressure gage during cranking. This conventional method causes inaccuracy of cylinder pressure measurement because of different cranking speed results from battery status and also causes high manhour and cost. To check valve timing, related FEAD parts should be disassembled and timing mark should be checked manually. This study describes and suggests new methodology to measure compression pressure by analysis of start motor current and to check valve timing by cylinder pressure with high accuracy.

Characteristics of {{synthetic}} valve oil include, but are not necessarily limited to, greater compatibility with other related oils without chemical reactions (some types of mineral based oils or their additives were known to react with each other, forming thick solids - this required disassembly and complete cleaning of the valves to restore operation), slow evaporation or total lack of evaporation resulting in fewer oilings required, and less dissipation on contact with moisture inside the valve. Some synthetics have the additional advantage {{that they do not}} act as thinners for mineral based slide greases (previously, mineral based valve oil inserted into a valve by way of a tuning slide could carry some slide grease with it, fouling the valve).

50|$|The stem {{serves as}} a {{connector}} from the actuator {{to the inside of}} the valve and transmits this actuation force.

40|$|ObjectiveLeaflet {{prolapse}} {{resulting from}} acute chordal rupture is one presentation of fibroelastic deficiency that {{is associated with}} minimal leaflet changes in the prolapsing segment. Minimizing resection and preserving leaflet tissue may be an optimal surgical strategy. We examined the importance of the leaflet preservation concept by comparing resective and nonresective surgical procedures in practice today. MethodsEight porcine mitral valves were evaluated in an in vitro heart simulator before surgical manipulation. Mitral regurgitation was created in these valves by transecting the posterior marginal chordae resulting in severe P 2 prolapse. After confirmation of mitral regurgiation via regurgitant flow measurement (mL/beat), regurgitation was corrected by three repairs: neochordoplasty with polytetrafluoroethylene sutures (Gore-Tex; W. L. Gore & Associates, Inc, Flagstaff, Ariz), triangular resection, and quadrangular resection with annular <b>compression.</b> Postrepair <b>valve</b> hemodynamics were quantified under pulsatile conditions of 120 mm Hg peak transmitral pressure and 5 L/min cardiac output at 70 beats/min. Furthermore, hemodynamic, geometric, and echocardiographic indices were measured. ResultsTransecting the marginal chordae resulted in severe P 2 prolapse and significant mitral regurgiation (19. 3 ± 4. 3 mL/beat). Regurgitant volume was significantly reduced after any of the three surgical approaches (quadrangular, 4. 38 ± 1. 6 mL/beat; triangular, 2. 56 ± 1. 0 mL/beat; neochordal, 2. 86 ± 1. 24 mL/beat). In comparison with the baseline normal valves, leaflet coaptation length and posterior leaflet mobility were significantly reduced in the quadrangular resection group, whereas they were partially restored in the triangular resection and fully preserved in the neochordoplasty group. ConclusionsAlthough the three repair procedures are hemodynamically comparable, valve function and leaflet kinematics were significantly better after a nonresection or limited resective correction of leaflet prolapse in this experimental model of acute chordal rupture with otherwise normal leaflet geometry...|$|R
