5|$|The easiest {{species to}} confuse with the Carolina wren is Bewick's wren, which differs in being smaller {{but with a}} longer tail, grayer-brown above and whiter below. The Carolina and white-browed wrens differ from the house wren in being larger, with a decidedly longer bill and hind toe; their <b>culmen</b> has a notch behind the tip.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the black}} catbird is {{unlikely}} to be mistaken for any other mimid species, there are several other black birds — including the melodious blackbird, the bronzed cowbird and the giant cowbird — that occur within the same range and might conceivably cause confusion. All are birds of more open habitats. The melodious blackbird is larger and longer tailed; it has dark eyes and a stocky bill with an evenly curved <b>culmen.</b> The bronzed cowbird is thicker necked than is the catbird and has a bronzy, rather than purplish or greenish gloss to its plumage; its eye is bright red rather than dark red. The giant cowbird is considerably larger, and is relatively longer tailed and thicker necked than is the catbird.|$|E
5|$|The {{breeding}} male has a {{short and}} narrow black bib {{and a broad}} chestnut eye stripe that {{does not meet the}} mantle. The male has a grey crown and nape and a rufous lower back and rump. The female has a darker and greyer crown and cheek than the female house sparrow and the shoulder is darker chestnut. The female Dead Sea sparrow of the subspecies Passer moabiticus yattii is also similar to the female Sind sparrow, but has yellow tinges on the underparts and sometimes on parts of the head. The bill is black on the breeding male and pale brown on the non-breeding male and female. With a <b>culmen</b> length of , the Sind sparrow is slightly smaller-billed than the house sparrow.|$|E

5000|$|Wisconsinites {{experimented with}} over-snow {{vehicles}} before 1900, experimenting with bicycles equipped with runners and gripping fins; steam-propelled sleighs; and (later) Model T Fords converted with rear tractor treads and skis in front. A patent (554.482) for the Sled-Propeller design, without a model, was submitted on Sept. 5, 1895 by inventors William J. <b>Culman</b> and William B. Follis of Brule, Wisconsin. In the first races held near Three Lakes in 1926, 104 of these [...] "snowbuggies" [...] started. Carl Eliason of Sayner developed {{the prototype of}} the modern snowmobile in the 1920s when he mounted a two-cylinder motorcycle engine on a long sled, steered it with skis under the front, and propelled it with single, endless track. Eliason made 40 snowmobiles, patented in 1927. Upon receiving an order for 200 from Finland, he sold his patent to the FWD Company of Clintonville. They made 300 for military use, then transferred the patent to a Canadian subsidiary.|$|R
40|$|Measurements are {{presented}} of the thermomechanical coefficient of normal liquid He- 3 confined in a porous plug pre-plated with four monoloyers of He- 4. These non-magnetic monolayers displace the magnetic solid-like He- 3 monolayers that are {{adjacent to the}} pore surfaces when the plug is filled with pure He- 3. In the low temperature limit (T < 10 mK) the coefficient can be described by dP/dT ~ s/ 6 v, where dP is the pressure difference across the plug generated by the temperature difference dT and s and v are the molar entropy and volume. This low temperature limit corresponds to the condition d << l_q, where d is the pore diameter and l_q is the bulk liquid He- 3 quasiparticle mean free path; that is, the quasiparticles are predominantly boundary scattered in the pores. The measured coefficient is half that calculated by Edwards, <b>Culman</b> and He. When compared with this new experimental result for the He- 4 plated porous plug, the earlier result for pure liquid He- 3 is strikingly larger (by up to 30 x at 2 mK). This enhancement {{is reminiscent of the}} giant thermopowers measured in Kondo and other dilute magnetic alloys. It is speculated that the enhanced thermomechanical coefficient for pure liquid He- 3 is due to magnetic scattering of the He- 3 quasiparticles by the two magnetic solid-like He- 3 monolayers adjacent to the pore surfaces.

5|$|Adult non-breeding plumage is {{brownish}} {{with a dark}} {{neck and}} head marked with dark grey-brown. The eyes are surrounded with white, and the eyelids are pale. The bill is mostly pale grey, with a dark <b>culmen</b> and tip, but in early spring the tip may turn whitish. The underparts, lower face, chin, and throat are also whitish. The foreneck is whitish, usually forming wedge-shaped notch in dark neck-sides, and may sometimes reveal a shadowy trace of the neck ring or a pale collar. It has dark brownish grey upperparts with an unclear pattern of squares on the shoulders and some wing coverts spotted with white, which are usually concealed while swimming. The male and the female have similar appearances, although they exhibit sexual dimorphism in their physical dimensions with the male larger and significantly heavier than the female.|$|E
5|$|The King Island emu and the {{mainland}} emu show few morphological differences {{other than their}} significant difference in size. Mathews stated that the legs and bill were shorter than those of {{the mainland}} emu, yet the toes were nearly of equal length, and therefore proportionally longer. The tarsus of the King Island emu was also three times longer than the <b>culmen,</b> whereas it was four times longer in the mainland emu. Additional traits that supposedly distinguish this bird from the mainland emu have previously been suggested to be the distal foramen of the tarsometatarsus, and the contour of the cranium. However, the distal foramen is known to be variable in the mainland emu showing particular diversity between juvenile and adult forms and is therefore taxonomically insignificant. The same is true of the contour of the cranium, which is more dome-shaped in the King Island emu, a feature that is also seen in juvenile mainland emus.|$|E
25|$|The {{shape or}} {{color of the}} <b>culmen</b> can also help with the {{identification}} of birds in the field. For example, the <b>culmen</b> of the parrot crossbill is strongly decurved, while that of the very similar red crossbill is more moderately curved. The <b>culmen</b> of a juvenile common loon is all dark, while that of the very similarly plumaged juvenile yellow-billed loon is pale towards the tip.|$|E
25|$|After {{the autumn}} moult {{the tips of}} the new {{feathers}} have a buff fringe that adds a brown cast to the coloured plumage. The ends of the feathers wear away over the winter so that by the spring breeding season the underlying brighter colours are displayed. The eyes have dark brown irises and the legs are grey-brown. In winter the bill is a pale grey and slightly darker along the upper ridge or <b>culmen,</b> but in spring the bill becomes bluish-grey with a small black tip.|$|E
25|$|The duck is a {{distinctive}} small, mottled, predominantly brown pintail. It is smaller and stockier than the remaining mainland subspecies (A. g. spinicauda), with more uniform and darker plumage. It has a reddish crown, light brown cheeks and throat, dark grey underwings and a pointed tail. The back, breast and flanks are scalloped with buff; the underparts are buffy white, mottled with brown. The bill is yellow {{with a blue}} and black line on the <b>culmen</b> and tip, and the feet are greenish-grey. The downy chick is dark brown with yellowish buff markings.|$|E
25|$|Head {{and neck}} markers are very visible, {{and may be}} used in species where the legs are not {{normally}} visible (such as ducks and geese). Nasal discs and nasal saddles can be attached to the <b>culmen</b> with a pin looped through the nostrils in birds with perforate nostrils. They should not be used if they obstruct breathing. They should not be used on birds that live in icy climates, as accumulation of ice on a nasal saddle can plug the nostrils. Neck collars made of expandable, non-heat-conducting plastic are very useful for larger birds such as geese.|$|E
25|$|This glossy all-black crow has a {{heavy black}} bill with an arching <b>culmen</b> (upper {{edge of the}} mandible) and has a fine tip. The {{feathers}} have a purple gloss throughout. The tail of the Indian jungle crow is rounded and the legs and feet are stout. The Himalayan japonensis (in this sense including western intermedius and eastern tibetosinensis) has a slightly wedge-shaped tail and a voice is a guttural and grating graak (intermedius) or a hoarse kyarrh (tibetosinensis). The calls of the Indian jungle crow are not unlike that of the house crow but are harsher. In Sri Lanka, the house crow lacks the light grey neck but the neck is slimmer than in the jungle crow. The sexes are indistinguishable.|$|E
25|$|Suero married Enderquina Gutiérrez, {{daughter}} of Gutierre Rodríguez {{and an important}} member of the Castilian aristocracy. On 30 December 1110 she received a grant from Queen Urraca and was styled comitissa (countess). Since women were not granted that title independently but used it only in the case that their husbands were counts, by this time Enderquina must have been married to Suero. On 27 June 1114 the couple made a gift of land at Torre de Babia to a certain vassal of theirs, Pelayo Fróilaz, for his loyal service. It {{is the first of}} series of donations between 1114 and 1129 that the couple made displaying their magnificent landed wealth. On 9 February 1116 Suero is cited in one charter as ruling the city and towers of León, the old imperiale <b>culmen</b> (imperial summit). It is probable that he also ruled the surrounding country. He certainly owned property in León, and he may have previously been its count in 1114. He is described as legionensium comes (count of the Leonese), possibly a mere title with no attendant jurisdiction. Over the next fifteen years he appears governing briefly at Gordón, Astorga, Cordove, and, in 1131, in Laciana and Paredes.|$|E

500|$|The bee-eaters are {{generally}} similar in appearance, {{although they are}} normally divided into three genera. Nyctyornis comprises two large species with long throat feathers, the blue-bearded bee-eater and the red-bearded bee-eater, {{both of which have}} rounded wings, a ridged <b>culmen,</b> feathered nostrils and a relatively sluggish lifestyle. The purple-bearded bee-eater is the sole member of Meropogon, which is intermediate between Nyctyornis and the typical bee-eaters, having rounded wings and a [...] "beard", but a smooth <b>culmen</b> and no nostril feathers. All the remaining species are normally retained in the single genus Merops. There are close relationships within this genus, for example the red-throated bee-eater and the white-fronted bee-eater form a superspecies, but formerly suggested genera, such as Aerops, Melittophagus, Bombylonax and Dicrocercus, have not been generally accepted for several decades since a 1969 paper united them in the current arrangement.|$|E

Though many artists have speculated, it is unknown how the pigeon held its crest in life as Meek's notes did not cover this subject. John Gerrard Keulemans (who produced the illustration accompanying Rothschild's original description), depicted the crest as being flat based on Meek's specimens; other artists have presented it as spread and scraggly {{like that of the}} crowned pigeons. It has been suggested that the crests of the museum specimens were flattened during preparation.|$|E

A presumed adult male (NHMUK 1889.5.30.15) in the Paris museum has a light ash-grey head and back of the neck (lighter on the hind-neck), with a long crest the same colour with white shafts. Its back and tail are ash-brown, its wings darker with a greyish wash, and its uppertail covert feathers and rump have a rufous wash. Its primary coverts are white with brown tips, although the bases (instead of the tips) are brown in other specimens. The superciliary stripe, lore, and most of the specimen's underside is white, with a pale rufous wash on the flanks and undertail coverts. The extent of light rufous on the underside varies by specimen. The beak and legs are lemon-yellow, with yellow-brown claws. It has a bare, triangular area of skin around the eye, which may have been yellow in life. Though the species' iris was described as bluish-brown, it has been depicted as brown, yellow or orange.|$|E
500|$|The white plumage {{and pink}} facial skin of adult American white ibises are distinctive. Adults have black wingtips {{that are usually}} only visible in flight.

500|$|The Rodrigues rail was a flightless rail {{with bright}} grey plumage, perhaps flecked with white. Its beak and legs were red, {{and it had}} a red, naked area (or wattle) around its eyes. Its exact size is unknown, but it was {{about the size of a}} chicken, and {{somewhat}} smaller than the related red rail. Subfossil remains exhibit a large variation in size, which may reflect sexual dimorphism. The cranium of the Rodrigues rail was slightly elongate, convex in every direction, and was [...] long and [...] wide. The cranium had a narrow, long frontal region, [...] at its least width. The beak varied greatly in size and shape; some specimens had short and almost straight beaks, and others had much longer beaks (up to one third longer) that were prominently curved. It is unknown whether this was related to the overall size of an individual bird or to sexual dimorphism. The <b>culmen</b> of the beak was almost straight above the nostril, and the nasal bone was slightly longer than the cranium.

500|$|The common {{starling}} is [...] long, with a wingspan of [...] and {{a weight}} of [...] Among standard measurements, the wing chord is , the tail is , the <b>culmen</b> is [...] and the tarsus is [...] The plumage is iridescent black, glossed purple or green, and spangled with white, especially in winter. The underparts of adult male common starlings are less spotted {{than those of}} adult females {{at a given time}} of year. The throat feathers of males are long and loose and are used in display while those of females are smaller and more pointed. The legs are stout and pinkish- or greyish-red. The bill is narrow and conical with a sharp tip; in the winter it is brownish-black but in summer, females have lemon yellow beaks while males have yellow bills with blue-grey bases. Moulting occurs once a year- in late summer after the breeding season has finished; the fresh feathers are prominently tipped white (breast feathers) or buff (wing and back feathers), which gives the bird a speckled appearance. The reduction in the spotting in the breeding season is achieved through the white feather tips largely wearing off. Juveniles are grey-brown and by their first winter resemble adults though often retaining some brown juvenile feathering, especially on the head. They can usually be sexed by the colour of the irises, rich brown in males, mouse-brown or grey in females. Estimating the contrast between an iris and the central always-dark pupil is 97% accurate in determining sex, rising to 98% if the length of the throat feathers is also considered. The common starling is mid-sized by both starling standards and passerine standards. It is readily distinguished from other mid-sized passerines, such as thrushes, icterids or small corvids, by its relatively short tail, sharp, blade-like bill, round-bellied shape and strong, sizeable (and rufous-coloured) legs. In flight, its strongly pointed wings and dark colouration are distinctive, while on the ground its strange, somewhat waddling gait is also characteristic. The colouring and build usually distinguish this bird from other starlings, although the closely related spotless starling may be physically distinguished by the lack of iridescent spots in adult breeding plumage.|$|E
