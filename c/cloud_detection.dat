40|$|This paper {{describes}} the {{validation of the}} International Satellite Cloud Climatology project (ISCCP) <b>cloud</b> <b>detections</b> by verifying {{the accuracy of the}} infrared clear-sky radiances. Comparison of retrieved surface temperatures to other measurements shows that bias errors are less than 2 K and random errors are about 2 K for sea surface (monthly means at 280 -km scales) and that bias errors are less than 2 K and random errors are about 4 K for land surfaces (3 hourly at 280 -km scales). Bias errors over a few persistently cloudy locations are sometimes -(2 - 4) K and over winter sea ice may be about + 2 K. Surface reflectances are confirmed to be within 3 % of other measurements and models for ocean, except for sun glint geometries, and to be within 3 %- 5 % for land surfaces. Sufficiently accurate validation data are not avilable for visible reflectances of sea ice and snow-covered land, but some tests of specific cases suggest that errors are approximately 10 %. These errors in clear-sky radiances suggest uncertainties in the ISCCP <b>cloud</b> <b>detections</b> of about 10 % with a small (3 %- 6 %) negative bias over land. Some specific regions exhibit both larger rms uncertainties and somewhat larger biases in cloud amount approaching 10 %. ISCCP <b>cloud</b> <b>detections</b> are more in error over the polar regions than anywhere else.

Our {{analysis of the}} <b>cloud</b> <b>detection</b> shows that {{the differences between the}} satellite and in situ measurements mainly arise from three factors. First, averaging CALIPSO Level l data along track before <b>cloud</b> <b>detection</b> increases the estimate of high-and low-level cloud fractions. Second, the vertical averaging of Level 1 data before <b>cloud</b> <b>detection</b> tends to artificially increase the cloud vertical extent. Third, the differences in classification of fully attenuated pixels among the CALIPSO climatologies lead to differences in the low-level Arctic cloud fractions. In another section, we compare the cloudy pixels detected by colocated in situ and satellite observations to study the cloud phase determination. At midlatitudes, retrievals of homogeneous high ice clouds by CALIPSO data sets are very robust (more than 94. 6 % of agreement with in situ). In the Arctic, where the cloud phase vertical variability is larger within a 480 m pixel, all climatologies show disagreements with the in situ measurements and CALIPSO-General Circulation Models-Oriented Cloud Product (GOCCP) report significant undefined-phase clouds, which likely correspond to mixed-phase clouds. In all CALIPSO products, the phase determination is dominated by the cloud top phase.
