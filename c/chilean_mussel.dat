50|$|The <b>Chilean</b> <b>mussel</b> {{is part of}} the world-wide Mytilus edulis {{complex of}} mussels, and its taxonomic {{relationship}} to other, Northern and Southern Hemisphere smooth-shelled blue mussels has been unclear. Genetic studies of nuclear markers suggested that the <b>Chilean</b> <b>mussel</b> has features of both the Mediterranean mussel (Mytilus galloprovincialis) and the North Atlantic Mytilus edulis, but since it is still closer to the former, it was suggested to be considered either as M. galloprovincialis or as a subspecies of it, Mytilus galloprovincialis chilensis. Others however have recognized mussels of diverse origins in South America. Borsa et al. (2012) found that most populations in the south of the continent indeed represent a native Southern Hemisphere lineage of M. edulis, named Mytilus edulis platensis. Populations in central Chile show some introgression from Southern Hemisphere M. galloprovincialis, and apparently introduced occurrences of true Northern Hemisphere M. galloprovincialis are also present at some harbour localities.|$|E

40|$|Saxitoxin (STX), a {{principal}} phycotoxin contributing to paralytic shellfish poisoning, is largely produced by marine microalgae {{of the genus}} Alexandrium. This toxin affects {{a wide range of}} species, inducing massive deaths in fish and other marine species. However, marine bivalves can resist and accumulate paralytic shellfish poisons. Despite numerous studies on the impact of STX in marine bivalves, knowledge regarding STX recognition at molecular level by benthic species remains scarce. Therefore, the aim {{of this study was to}} identify novel genes that interact with STX in the <b>Chilean</b> <b>mussel</b> Mytilus chilensis. For this, RNA-seq and RT-qPCR approaches were used to evaluate the transcriptomic response of M. chilensis to a purified STX as well as in vivo Alexandrium catenella exposure. Approximately 800 million reads were assembled, generating 138, 883 contigs that were blasted against the UniProt Mollusca database. Pattern Recognition Receptors (PRRs) involved in mussel immunity, such as Toll-like receptors, tumor necrosis factor receptors, and scavenger-like receptors were found to be strongly upregulated at 8 and 16 h post-STX injection. These results suggest an involvement of PRRs in the response to STX, as well as identifying potential, novel STX-interacting receptors in this <b>Chilean</b> <b>mussel.</b> This study is the first transcriptomic overview of the STX-response in the edible species M. chilensis. However, the most significant contribution of this work is the identification of immune receptors and pathways potentially involved in the recognition and defense against STX's toxicity and its impact of harmful algae blooms on wild and cultivated mussel populations...|$|E

40|$|Diarrhetic {{shellfish}} poisoning (DSP) is a gastrointestinal disease {{caused by}} lipid soluble polyether toxins produced by dinoflagellates and accumulated in shellfish. Diarrhetic shellfish poisoning is a worldwide threat {{to public health}} and the shellfish industry. To date, only four lipid soluble polyethers have been known as diarrhetic shellfish toxins. Among them, Okadaic acid (OA), Dinophysistoxin 1 (DTX- 1, 35 -methyl OA), Dinophysistoxin 2 (DTX- 2, OA isomers) and Dinophysistoxin 3 (DTX- 3, 7 -O-acyl- 35 -methyl OA), all of which have free carboxilic groups. To perform quantitative analysis of DSP toxins in shellfish samples is a requirement, because DSP toxins are endemic in the Chilean mollusks of the southern regions, and although human symptoms of DSP appear relatively mild in comparison with the Paralytic Shellfish Poisoning (PSP), the necessity of monitoring the chronic effects of continued uptake of low doses of DSP toxins more closely is imperative, since DSP toxins have been described as potent tumor promoters. This paper shows the synthesis pathway of a chromophore, 1 -pyrenyldiazomethane (PDAM), a fluorescent labeling reagent for determination of carboxilic acids, using High Performance Liquid Chromatography with fluorescence on-line detection. This procedure was developed {{in order to have a}} quantitative method for DSP toxins analysis that would be useful for health public services and private shellfish industries. The features of this labeling reagent are compared against ADAM and used for quantitative analysis of DSP toxins in <b>Chilean</b> <b>mussels</b> and cultured dinoflagellates samples...|$|R
40|$|Gaining new {{knowledge}} of the native distributions of species (phylogeography) {{is more and more}} difficult in a world affected by anthropogenic disturbance, in particular by species translocations. Increasingly, molecular markers are required to support de-cisions about the taxonomy of native vs. introduced species, and the existence of their hybrids, to answer phylogeographic questions. In many fields, including aquaculture, traceability and food security, taxonomic and phylogeographic knowledge is key to the successful management and conservation of biodiversity. The Pacific coast of Chile {{is one of the last}} regions without a clear and agreed understanding of the taxonomy and systematics of smooth- shelled blue mussels of the genus Mytilus. A panel of 49 bi- allelic single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) was genotyped in 338 Mytilus individu-als collected from nine Chilean and five reference populations. All analyses confirmed the hypothesis that the native <b>Chilean</b> blue <b>mussel</b> is genetically distinct from the ref-erence species M. edulis, M. galloprovincialis and M. trossulus. These results support the hypothesis of a unique evolutionary history of the native <b>Chilean</b> blue <b>mussel</b> on the Pacific coast of South America. It is therefore concluded that the native blue mussel from Chile should be recognized as M. chilensis Hupé 1854. We confirmed a recent Mediterranean origin of introduced M. galloprovincialis on the coast of Chile. This knowledge advances the understanding of global phylogeography of blue mussels and their bioinvasions and harmonizes taxonomy in the context of aquaculture production, seafood traceability, labelling and trade.

40|$|For {{the first}} time in a marine bivalve species, {{geographic}} intraspecific variation in sperm morphology in the <b>Chilean</b> <b>mussel,</b> Perumytilus purpuratus, is reported. Samples were obtained in December 2010 from the rocky intertidal at three locations: Antofagasta (23844001. 0800 S, 70826026. 1100 W), Valparaı´so (32857023. 0700 S, 71833001. 8600 W), and Valdivia (39 50044. 2600 S, 73 25051. 9900 W). Scanning electron microscopy was used to describe sperm traits, and genetic data were obtained by sequencing a 16 S mtDNA 427 -bp fragment. The results showed geographic intraspecific variation with two statistically significant patterns of genetically differentiated sperm morphologies. One genetic clade was found for Antofagasta and Valparaı ´so, displaying a unique sperm morphotype with a short acrosome accounting for 26 % of the head length, and the other from Valdivia, with a larger acrosome occupying 47 % of the head length. These results will lead to new research to distinguish among alternative hypotheses: the presence of cryptic species, incipient speciation, or a polymorphism in sperm traits of P. purpuratus.

This pilot study (n = 46) was designed to determine mercury concentrations in fish products for national consumption (Chilean jack mackerel, hake, <b>Chilean</b> <b>mussel,</b> tuna) and for export (salmon, Patagonian toothfish, swordfish, southern hake), and to estimate the exposure of the general population. The fish products were collected from markets in Talcahuano, Puerto Montt and Santiago. Samples were analyzed at the National Environmental Center by cold vapor atomic absorption spectrophotometry. Mercury levels in swordfish and one canned tuna sample exceeded levels prescribed by national and international standards. The remaining two export products (Patagonian toothfish, also known as Chilean sea bass, and salmon) complied with international limits, which are more demanding than Chilean regulations. Theoretical estimates of mercury intake varied from 0. 08 to 3. 8 mu g kg(- 1) bw day(- 1) for high fish consumers, exceeding the provisional tolerable intake for tuna, Chilean seabass, Chilean jack mackerel and swordfish.

40|$|The sperm {{ultrastructure}} {{has been}} used to solve several systematic and phylogenetic problems in marine invertebrates. The sperm ultrastructure of the <b>Chilean</b> <b>mussel</b> Mytilus chilensis and Mytilus galloprovincialis corresponds to the ect-aquasperm type. Sperm from both taxa measured 55 - 60 &# 956;m between head (acrosome + nucleus), midpiece (only 5 mitochondria) and the flagellum which in its end piece has a smaller diameter tail. The differences between both taxa are clearly shown, {{in the structure of the}} acrosome and nucleus. Therefore, according to our results and those reported in the literature, we indicate that Chilean native mussel sperm is different from other species of the Mytilus complex (M. trossulus, M. galloprovincialis and M. edulis). These differences in sperm ultrastructure found in M. chilensis, are another trait that can be used to validate the taxonomic status of the species. Differences in sperm morphology are related with reproductive isolation, and probably will be useful to understand future data on speciation. Finally, we discussed the finding that Mytilus galloprovincialis sperm from Chile have an acrosome notoriously smaller than those reported for specimens from Europe and Africa, though they have a great similarity with specimens from Japan, as reported in the literature...|$|E

Fourier coe⁄cients showed a highly signi¢cant morphological variation between the populations studied. Canonical variates analysis showed a visual association of the First canonical with convexity of ventral edge and umbo shape, while the second axis was associated with shell elongation. Previously described genetic patterns were marginally congruent with our morphometric pattern, though geographic distance had a stronger e¡ect on morphology.

This findings indicate that its long-lived planktotrophic larvae provides this species with considerable dispersal ability throughout its range which is favoured by the ocean currents along the chilean coast. In terms of management of the M. chilensis fishery, the results provide no evidence for discrete stocks, {{with the possible exception of}} the Punta Arenas population.

40|$|Artículo de publicación ISI. Mussels {{are one of}} {{the most}} {{cultivated}} and commercialized bivalves worldwide and in southern Chile its culture represent an important economic activity. The species identification within the Mytilus genera, by morphological features, is unreliable, so we used a polymorphism RFLP in the gene encoding the polyphenolic adhesive protein as a species-specific genetic marker to describe Mytilus species diversity in southern Chile, and evaluate possible applications in traceability, food quality and safety. Using Me 15 - 16 marker most mussels were M. chilensis, finding no other pure individuals; however, putative hybrids of M. chilensis x M. trossulus and M. chilensis x M. galloprovincialis were detected. There was no evidence of M. edulis. The presence of the M. trossulus allele, faraway from its distribution area, demands further analysis with different genetic markers to allow a better understanding of its origin.

We investigated neutral and adaptive genetic variation in Mytilus from six locations in southern Chile with 1240 SNPs obtained with RAD-seq. Differentiation among locations with 891 neutral SNPs was low (F-ST = 0. 005). Higher differentiation was obtained with a panel of 58 putative outlier SNPs (F-ST = 0. 114) indicating the potential for local adaptation. This panel identified clusters of genetically related individuals and demonstrated {{that much of the}} differentiation (similar to 92 %) could be attributed to the three major regions and environments: extreme conditions in Patagonia, inner bay influenced by aquaculture (Reloncavi), and outer bay (Chiloe Island). Patagonia samples were most distinct, but additional analysis carried out excluding this collection also revealed adaptive divergence between inner and outer bay samples. The four locations within Reloncavi area were most similar with all panels of markers, likely due to similar environments, high gene flow by aquaculture practices, and low geographical distance. Our results and the SNP markers developed will be a powerful tool supporting management and programs of this harvested species. CONICYT 	 FONDECYT 	 113030...|$|E
40|$|Aquaculture is {{the fastest}} growing animal food {{producing}} sector in the world, providing {{almost half of the}} fish consumed worldwide. However, to meet the future large-scale protein demand associated with world population growth, a sustainable increase in production is required. Genetics and genomics techniques have immense potential for enhancing aquaculture production through selective breeding programs, including the incorporation of marker-assisted selection (MAS). These advances are dependent on applying knowledge of the genetic basis of traits of economic importance (i. e. their heritability and genetic architecture) and the availability of genomic resources, particularly DNA markers, genome linkage maps and genotyping techniques. The overall aim of this Master of Philosophy thesis is to investigate the genetic basis of traits of importance to aquaculture, and to develop and characterise genetic markers for potential use in selective breeding. This will be targeted at two aquacultural species of economic importance: the Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) and the <b>Chilean</b> <b>mussel</b> (Mytilus chilensis). Since these species are at a very different stage of development of genomic research, with salmon selective breeding and genomics more advanced, species-specific aims were proposed as follows: 1. Atlantic salmon: The objective {{of this study was to}} assess the possibility of using gene-specific markers in selective breeding programs by discovering new single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in a gene known to regulate growth in mammals and perform a large-scale SNP association study. Novel SNP markers were identified on a gene paralogue (myostatin- 1 b) that negatively regulates skeletal muscle development and growth. The SNPs were tested for association with growth and fillet related traits measured in a commercial population of 4, 800 Atlantic salmon at harvest. 2. Chilean mussel: The overall aim was to assess the possibility of selective breeding for growth-related traits by assessing their heritability, and by discovering and characterising the inheritance of genetic markers in mussel families. To achieve this, the heritability of mussel weight and shell length at different ages was estimated. In addition, a powerful new method for SNP discovery and genotyping - restriction-site associated DNA (RAD) sequencing - was used to identify markers across the mussel genome, with the specific aims of (i) creating a novel genomic resource, (ii) studying aspects of the genomic architecture, and (iii) examining the inheritance of the markers from parents to offspring, given the unusual inheritance patterns of other marker types described in the bivalve genetics literature. In the Atlantic salmon population, three novel SNPs were identified on the myostatin- 1 b gene. One of the SNPs, which was located within the 5 ’ flanking region (g. 1086 C>T), showed a significant association with several harvest weight traits (PT associated with an increase in 30 to 50 g in weight depending on the trait. In the <b>Chilean</b> <b>mussel</b> families, the heritability estimate of body weight was low to moderate (0. 11 - 0. 28) and of shell length was not significantly different from zero. These results suggest that selective breeding for body weight is feasible, although environmental factors significantly influence the phenotypic outcome of both the growth-related traits analysed. The analysis of the mussel genome using RAD sequencing with the SbfI enzyme allowed the discovery of 4, 537 putative SNPs. Interestingly, a high SNP frequency was detected in the sequenced mussel genome - one of the highest across metazoans - with an average of 1 SNP per 30 base pairs (bp). In addition, significant distortions from expected Mendelian inheritance ratios were observed in the majority (approximately 70...|$|E
40|$|IIn 2012, world mollusk {{production}} in aquaculture reached {{a volume of}} 15, 171, 000 tons, representing 23 % of total aquaculture production and positioning mollusks as {{the second most important}} category of aquaculture products (fishes are the first). Clams and oysters are the mollusk species with the highest production levels, followed in descending order by mussels, scallops and abalones. In view of the increasing importance attached to genetic information on aquaculture, which can help with good maintenance and thus the sustainability of production, the present work offers a review of the state of knowledge on genetic and genomic information about mollusks produced in aquaculture. The analysis was applied to mollusks which are of importance for aquaculture, with emphasis on the 5 species with the highest production levels. According to FAO, these are: Japanese clam Ruditapes philippinarum; Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas; <b>Chilean</b> <b>mussel</b> Mytilus chilensis; Blood clam Anadara granosa and Chinese clam Sinonovacula constricta. To date, the genomes of 5 species of mollusks have been sequenced, only one of which, Crassostrea gigas, coincides with the species with the greatest {{production in}} aquaculture. Another important species whose genome has been sequenced is Mytilus galloprovincialis, which is the second most important mussel in aquaculture production, after M. chilensis. Few genetic improvement programs have been reported in comparison with the number reported in fish species. The most commonly investigated species are oysters, with at least 5 genetic improvement programs reported, followed by abalones with 2 programs and mussels with one. The results of this work will establish the current situation with respect to the genetics of mollusks which are of importance for aquaculture production, in order to assist future decisions to ensure the sustainability of these resources...|$|E
