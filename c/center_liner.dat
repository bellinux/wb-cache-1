40|$|A {{recently}} developed piezo-electric composite film is evaluated for its usefulness in application in acoustic liners. Researchers at the NASA Langley Research <b>Center</b> <b>Liner</b> Technology Facility developed experiments {{to measure the}} electrical response of the material to acoustic excitation and the vibrational response of the material to electrical excitation. The robustness of the piezo-electric film was also assessed. The material's electrical response to acoustic excitation {{is found to be}} comparable to a commercial microphone in the range of frequencies from 500 to 3000 Hz. However, the vibrational response to electrical excitation in the frequency range of interest is an order of magnitude less than may be necessary for application to acoustic liners. Nevertheless, experimental results indicate that the potential exists for the material to produce a measurable change in the impedance spectrum of a liner. Work continues to improve the authority of the piezo-electric film...|$|E
40|$|The present {{investigation}} {{is a continuation}} of a previous joint project between the Florida State University and the NASA Langley Research <b>Center</b> <b>Liner</b> Physics Team. In the previous project, a study of acoustic liners, in two dimensions, inside a normal incidence impedance tube was carried out. The study consisted of two parts. The NASA team was responsible for the experimental part of the project. This involved performing measurements in an impedance tube with a large aspect ratio slit resonator. The FSU team was responsible for the computation part of the project. This involved performing direct numerical simulation (DNS) of the NASA experiment in two dimensions using CAA methodology. It was agreed that upon completion of numerical simulation, the computed values of the liner impedance were to be sent to NASA for validation with experimental results. On following this procedure good agreements were found between numerical results and experimental measurements over a wide range of frequencies and sound-pressure-level. Broadband incident sound waves were also simulated numerically and measured experimentally. Overall, good agreements were also found...|$|E
40|$|The need to {{minimize}} fan noise radiation from commercial aircraft engine nacelles continues {{to provide an}} impetus for developing new acoustic liner concepts. If the full value of such concepts is to be attained, an understanding of grazing flow effects is crucial. Because of this need for improved understanding of grazing flow effects, the NASA Langley Research <b>Center</b> <b>Liner</b> Physics Group has invested a large effort {{over the past decade}} into the development of a 2 -D finite element method that characterizes wave propagation through a lined duct. The original test section in the Langley Grazing Incidence Tube was used to acquire data needed for implementation of this finite element method. This test section employed a stepper motor-driven axial-traversing bar, embedded in the wall opposite the test liner, to position a flush-mounted microphone at pre-selected locations. Complex acoustic pressure data acquired with this traversing microphone were used to educe the acoustic impedance of test liners using this 2 -D finite element method and a local optimization technique. Results acquired in this facility have been extensively reported, and were compared with corresponding results from various U. S. aeroacoustics laboratories in the late 1990 â€™s. Impedance data comparisons acquired from this multi-laboratory study suggested that it would be valuable to incorporate more realistic 3 -D aeroacoustic effects into the impedance eduction methodology. This paper provides a description of modifications that have been implemented to facilitate studies of 3 -D effects. The two key features of the modifie...|$|E
40|$|Noise in a {{fluid system}} can be treated with a prototypical liner-style suppressor, an {{expansion}} chamber which includes an internal annulus of syntactic foam. A syntactic foam liner consists of host material with hollow microspheres which collapse under pressure to add compliance to the suppressor. The liner effectively increases the transmission loss of the suppressor, or ratio between inlet and outlet acoustic energy. Currently, liner-style suppressors are not commercially available. This study investigates the integration of solid liner material within suppressor shells while also analyzing the effect of flow-smoothing diffusors on the transmission loss of the suppressor. The diffusors function to <b>center</b> the <b>liner</b> within the device, while reducing the potential for turbulence-induced self-noise. The diffusor may also impact the longevity of the liner, by reducing mechanical erosion. The {{results of the study}} provide additional insight to the commercial viability of the liner-style suppressor. M. S...|$|R
40|$|Accurate {{modeling}} {{tools are}} needed to design new engine liners capable of reducing aircraft noise. The {{purpose of this study}} is to determine if a commercially-available finite element package, COMSOL Multiphysics, can be used to accurately model a range of different acoustic engine liner designs, and in the process, collect and document a benchmark dataset that can be used in both current and future code evaluation activities. To achieve these goals, a variety of liner samples, ranging from conventional perforate-over-honeycomb to extended-reaction designs, were installed in one wall of the grazing flow impedance tube at the NASA Langley Research <b>Center.</b> The <b>liners</b> were exposed to high sound pressure levels and grazing flow, and the effect of the liner on the sound field in the flow duct was measured. These measurements were then compared with predictions. While this report only includes comparisons for a subset of the configurations, the full database of all measurements and predictions is available in electronic format upon request. The results demonstrate that both conventional perforate-over-honeycomb and extended-reaction liners can be accurately modeled using COMSOL. Therefore, this modeling tool can be used with confidence to supplement the current suite of acoustic propagation codes, and ultimately develop new acoustic engine liners designed to reduce aircraft noise...|$|R
40|$|This report {{documents}} {{the results of}} an acoustic liner test performed using a Gen 1 HSR mixer/ejector model installed on the Jet Exit Rig in the Nozzle Acoustic Test Rig in the Aeroacoustic Propulsion Laboratory or NASA Glenn Research <b>Center.</b> Acoustic <b>liner</b> effectiveness and single-component thrust performance results are discussed. Results from 26 different types of single-degree-of-freedom and bulk material liners are compared with each other and against a hardwall baseline. Design parameters involving all aspects of the facesheet, the backing cavity, and the type of bulk material were varied in order to study the effects of these design features on the acoustic impedance, acoustic effectiveness and on nozzle thrust performance. Overall, the bulk absorber liners are more effective at reducing the jet noise than the single-degree-of-freedom liners. Many of the design parameters had little effect on acoustic effectiveness, such as facesheeet hole diameter and honeycomb cell size. A relatively large variation in the impedance of the bulk absorber in a bulk liner is required to {{have a significant impact on}} the noise reduction. The thrust results exhibit a number of consistent trends, supporting the validity of this new addition to the facility. In general, the thrust results indicate that thrust performance benefits from increased facesheet thickness and decreased facesheet porosity...|$|R

The base interior of the BMW was redone with new leather and color options, while retaining the electronics and telematics of the original BMW.

40|$|The {{research}} has simulated the forces experienced {{at the center}} bowl from a longitudinal train dynamic for cylindrical type bogie center bearings. Results show all but the lightest longitudinal train dynamics generate impact loads at the center bowl for empty wagons. Bolster pitching during such events gives rise to point contact loads being experienced by the materials of the center bowl and top center potentially failing plastic liners and damaging metallic liners. Vertical rim friction forces during impact against the rim wall are {{a significant factor in}} generating point loads on the center bowl plate surface. The shear loads from rim friction are likely to be the primary factor in causing broken rim failures in plastic bowl <b>liners.</b> Increasing the <b>center</b> bearing diameter was shown to increase contact loads against the rim wall without significantly lowering the peak vertical point loads between the top <b>center</b> and bowl <b>liner...</b>|$|R
40|$|An {{artificial}} hip joint consists of several main components. The components are femoral stem, femoral head, acetabular liner and acetabular shell. As its {{function as a}} bearing, an acetabular liner is designed to reduce friction and receive the high stress. The liner is made from Ultra High Molecular Weight Polyethylene (UHMWPE) material. It is reported that the UHMWPE liner bearing is occasionally fails inside the patientâ€™s body. This paper reports the effect of loading on the liner and predicts the liner ability in receiving the load. A finite element simulation is employed in modeling the contact system. The maximum load received by the {{artificial hip}} joint during human activities is used as input in the artificial hip joint models. The result shows that the acetabular liner receives the high stress distribution and the highest stress {{is located on the}} <b>center</b> of the <b>liner.</b> The maximum stress on the acetabular liner does not exceed the yield criteria of the UHMWPE material. It is concluded that the UHMWPE material is relatively able to carry the various loading. However, the failure of the acetabular liner can be caused by the unexpected conditions when the patient stumbles or falls down...|$|R
