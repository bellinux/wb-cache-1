5|$|Located at 800 Southeast 10thAvenue, the {{building}} occupies the west {{half of the}} block between Southeast Belmont and Southeast Morrison streets. The southwest corner entry features a stylized Egyptian temple of <b>cast</b> <b>stone.</b> Italianate Renaissance influence {{is seen in the}} ground floor's large arched windows and tall narrow windows on the second. The west facade is lined with banks of large windows that helped illuminate and cool the work areas. Other important exterior features include a large garage door along Belmont Street, and a paved parking lot and water-tower pedestal on the Morrison Street side.|$|E
25|$|Both {{buildings}} used {{a structural}} system of steel framing and reinforced concrete. Brick {{is on the}} outside, faced in <b>cast</b> <b>stone.</b> The Knickerbocker, at 72 Hudson, was four stories tall to the Arnink's three; both were three bays wide and flat-roofed. Due to different materials in the composite for the <b>cast</b> <b>stone,</b> the Knickerbocker had a more distinctly golden color, like sandstone, while the Arnink was granite gray.|$|E
25|$|The mosque is {{a square}} structure, {{approximately}} 30–32m on each side, including the walls.

25|$|They {{were among}} the {{earliest}} structures in Albany built specifically {{in response to the}} increasing use of the automobile at that time. Their neo-Gothic <b>cast</b> <b>stone</b> facades are an unusual choice of style and material for that time. They may have been inspired by the nearby Delaware and Hudson Railroad office building, a contemporary catalyst for the redevelopment of downtown that is today the system administration building for the State University of New York.|$|E
25|$|The new {{building}} drew lots of praise, and local merchants and businessmen were inspired to emulate {{it in their}} own. Henry Arnink, a local dealer of Ford Model T's, had expanded his business to include repair and rental services by that time. He bought the existing three-story structure at 74 Hudson and renovated and expanded it. Local architect J. Walter Montross oversaw the project, designing a <b>cast</b> <b>stone</b> Gothic exterior {{that may have been}} intended to echo the nearby D Building.|$|E
25|$|In 1948, Mesrobian {{designed}} the Calvert Manor, a twenty-two unit apartment building located at 1925-1927 North Calvert Street in Arlington, Virginia. It was {{designed in the}} Moderne style and the building itself was {{laid out in a}} symmetrical design. Though Mesrobian was the architect behind the apartment, he held its ownership. After his death in 1975, the entitlement to the property was passed on to his children. The three-story garden apartment building is constructed of concrete block with red brick facing, highlighted by light-colored <b>cast</b> <b>stone,</b> cement brick details, and vertical bands of glass block. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places on 15 December 1997. The Calvert Manor also was awarded the Arlington County Preservation Design Award in 2002.|$|E

25|$|A {{full-length}} portrait {{sculpture of}} Junípero Serra {{is on the}} property of the mission. The <b>cast</b> <b>stone</b> sculpture, by Arthur Putnam, was completed in 1909, cast between 1916–1917 and installed in 1918 when the mission was remodeled. Funding for the piece came from D.J. McQuarry and it cost $500 to cast. It is approximately H. 6ft. 6 in. The sculpture depicts Serra wearing a monk's robe belted at the waist with a knotted rope and a rosary around his neck. He looks down, with his head bowed and eyes downward. The sculpture is on a concrete base. It is {{one of a series of}} allegorical figures commissioned by the estate of E. W. Scripps to depict California history. In 1993 it was examined by the Smithsonian Institution's Save Outdoor Sculpture! program. The program determined that the sculpture was well maintained.|$|E
25|$|Both Gardner Hall (1930), {{originally}} {{named the}} Fowler Memorial Administration Building after Charles J. Fowler, {{and the original}} Floyd W. Nease Library (1953), now the Bower-Grimshaw Center for Institutional Advancement, were designed by Wesley Angell. Gardner Hall was designed in the Classical or Colonial Revival mode. Gardner is brick, three stories on a high granite basement, and capped by a parapet balustraded in the center. Corners are articulated with brick quoins. The fenestration is symmetric with double sash windows at regular intervals, trimmed in white, topped with flared brick lintels and a white keystone. It also features a two-story balustraded Doric portico of fluted <b>cast</b> <b>stone</b> columns. The portico is the backdrop for commencement ceremonies. The main entrance, {{at the end of}} wide stairs, is pilastered and topped with a bracketed entablature, which frames an arched glass opening. The side elevations have projecting stair towers, which indicate the site of a central hall running the length of the building. Originally rectangular in form, the 1953 addition of the then-Nease Library in the rear gave it a T-configuration.|$|E
25|$|Rideau Hall's 0.36km2 (88 acre) {{property}} {{is surrounded by}} a 2,500 m (7,700ft) long Victorian cast iron and <b>cast</b> <b>stone</b> fence put up in 1928 and contains uniquely Canadian landscapes designed in the natural style, including broad lawns, groves of trees, and meandering roads and pathways. The entire site is divided into five distinct areas: the wooded entrance park (trees, groundcover, daffodils, and lawn), the open parkland (meadow), the sugar bush, the ornamental gardens, and the farm (out-buildings and open area). The last once included a herd of cattle and fields used to grow hay, but today the only remaining agricultural ventures are the working vegetable and herb gardens that have been present on the site since the time of the McKay family. From these fields, plants, fruits, and edible flowers are used in the palace kitchens, and a greenhouse and flower garden provide flowers for the hall and other government buildings in Ottawa. Further, during the early spring months, the maples throughout the property are tapped for syrup making. In total, more than 10,000 trees grow on the grounds. Additionally, there is a one kilometer long honorary segment of the Trans Canada Trail on the property.|$|E

25|$|A {{souvenir}} brochure {{produced for}} the opening night contained details of all companies and contractors involved in building and fitting out the Astoria. Edward Albert Stone was the architect, Griggs & Son Ltd of Westminster were the main building contractors, Major C.H. Bell acted as consultant engineer and local firm H. Lasenby Bros. were contracted to demolish and clear the site. The main concrete structure of the building was supplied by British Reinforced Concrete Engineering Co. Ltd of Stafford. The <b>cast</b> <b>stone</b> façade was produced by the Patent Impervious Stone and Construction Co Ltd of Leyton. Another London firm, Dawnay & Sons Ltd, provided the steelwork, but the brickwork was produced locally by the Sussex Brick Co. Ltd of Horsham. Tiling company Ramsdens of Westminster {{were responsible for the}} terrazzo floors and wall decoration, and the plasterwork was by H.E. Gaze Ltd of London. Two other London firms, the Carrier Engineering Co. Ltd and Berkeley Electrical Engineering Co. Ltd, respectively supplied ventilation and heating equipment and installed the electric systems and lighting. Furnishings were by W.W. Turner & Co. Ltd of Birmingham, and Henri & Laverdet Ltd (the firm of Marc-Henri Levy and Gaston Laverdet) were the interior designers. The John Compton Organ Co. of Acton installed the organ. Several other national and local firms supplied other products and services, from projectors to ticket machines.|$|E
25|$|The central bay of {{the south}} facade of the Hartington City Hall and Auditorium is highly {{effective}} Prairie School architecture (the nearly hidden north facade is similar). The bulk of the wall surface is simple running bond brickwork, forming a uniform ground for the interplay of horizontal and vertical lines. The stone coping at the roofline forms the highest horizontal line. Not far below is a horizontal band of triple corbelling that surrounds the building. This effect is created by projecting three courses of brick out farther than the wall below (as in a corbel), repeating it with three more courses of brick, and then repeating it again for the entire rest of the wall up to the copestone. Steele adds depth and interest to this band by varying the projection {{of each of the}} three brick courses by facade so that corners highlight one or another course (see photo below). This effective horizontal band is similar to but more sophisticated than what Steele used near the top of his noted First Congregational Church (Sioux City, 1916–1918). Additional horizontal lines derive from the original three bands of windows (particularly prior to more recent window alterations). These consistent horizontal lines are dramatically emphasized by the strong counterpoint of the six vertical piers. Yet even these vertical pilasters have horizontal elements in their capitals, consisting of three horizontal bands of projecting brick string courses (which echo the triple corbelling above) and the contrasting capitals of <b>cast</b> <b>stone</b> on top. Across the set of six vertical piers or pilasters along the auditorium, these elements create additional horizontal lines.|$|E

Romanesque features included the s, while a prominent Art Deco feature was [...] "the figure of Moses and the Tablets of Law, emphasizing {{the corner of the}} roof parapet." [...] The doorway and balcony at the east end of the building had [...] "a distinctly Moorish flavor, featuring symbolic ornament: the Star of David, the Menorah, and the Lion of Judah." [...] The names of major figures from the Tanakh (Hebrew Bible) were inscribed on the Garfield Place facade, and the Biblical verses [...] "SHOW ME THY WAYS O LORD TEACH ME THY PATHS GUIDE ME" [...] (...) on the Eighth Avenue facade. The building was also decorated with bas-reliefs of Jonah being swallowed by a great fish and Babylonian charioteers. It housed a 125-seat chapel, a large ballroom, social halls, class rooms for the religious school, meeting rooms, administrative offices, a library, handball courts, a gymnasium, and a swimming pool.|$|E
500|$|Shemanski Fountain was {{designed}} by Carl L. Linde in 1925, and is located behind the Arlene Schnitzer Concert Hall between Main Street and Salmon Street in Shemanski Park, part of the South Park Blocks of downtown Portland, Oregon. It was gifted to Portland by Joseph Shemanski (1869–1951), a Polish immigrant who became a successful businessman after founding Eastern Outfitting Co., to [...] "express in small measure gratitude" [...] for what the city offered to him. The fountain is triangular and cast from Oregon sandstone. The Italianesque trefoil supports two drinking platforms with three basins each, with one platform intended for use by dogs. Inara Verzemnieks of The Oregonian described the fountain's lower water basins as [...] "cute little bowl-sized pools at the base" [...] {{for the purpose of}} serving pets [...] "who did not have a place to cool off". Thayne Logan, a designer who worked for Linde, said that Shemanski [...] "wanted something for the little animals". Logan also said that the fountain's original design called for granite, but it was constructed of <b>cast</b> <b>stone</b> because of that material's popularity at the time. According to the Regional Arts & Culture Council, the fountain is [...] high and has a diameter of [...] An inscription around the top of the fountain reads: [...] "To the People of / The City of Portland / By Joseph Shemanski". Other inscriptions include [...] "O. Barrett SC '27 Cal. Br. Foundry, L.A" [...] and a signed Founder's mark. The bottom of the fountain is decorated with busts of females. It is maintained by the Portland Water Bureau with assistance from the Regional Arts & Culture Council.|$|E
