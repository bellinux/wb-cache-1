The other, we are almost ashamed to say, was the venerable Uncle Venner, in a clean shirt, and a broadcloth coat, more respectable than his ordinary wear, inasmuch as it was neatly patched on each elbow, and might be called an entire garment, except for a slight inequality in the length of its skirts.

In fact, it was sometimes observable that Clifford half wilfully hid from himself the consciousness of being stricken in years, and cherished visions of an earthly future still before him; visions, however, too indistinctly drawn to be followed by disappointment--though, doubtless, by depression--when any casual incident or recollection made him sensible of the withered leaf.|$|E

40|$|G. W. LEIBNIZ AND THE DE INSULA UTOPICA. The {{theory of}} the best of all {{possible}} worlds excludes the possibility of an ideal community from Leibniz’s philosophical horizon. A world without evil, like the one invented by utopians, is incomplete and therefore inferior to the present world. For this reason, the utopian model cannot be taken as an archetype to imitate. Nor can it be used as a criterion for measuring, by means of a comparative evaluation of the imaginary and the concrete community, the imperfection of the real <b>consociations</b> (as, on the other hand, Plato, More, Campanella and Bacon had assumed). Furthermore, utopia spreads unfounded hopes of a well-being which is achieved without efforts. According to the Leipzig philosopher, however, every improvement of human conditions can be achieved only by gathering the yield of the civilising action of the past generations and by coordinating, through a dense network of academies, the efforts of scientists of different nationalities. In 1688 Leibniz reflected on these issues, writing a short fragment (never published), in which he comments on the brief profile (imagined by him) of an ideal community, criticizing the utopian sirens and recalling man to a concrete commitment in history...|$|R

50|$|Dana {{was born}} in Cambridge, Massachusetts, 11 May 1735; died in New Haven, Connecticut, 18 August 1812. He was a nephew of Richard, and {{descendant}} through Caleb, second son of Daniel, who was the youngest son of Richard Dana, he was graduated from Harvard University in 1753, and remained in the college as a resident graduate for several years, studying theology and general literature. In October 1758, he was ordained and made pastor of the Congregational church in Wallingford, Connecticut, succeeding the Rev. Samuel Whittlesey. After he had accepted this call, the <b>consociation</b> prohibited his ordination; but the church and society, together with Mr. Dana, persisted in their action. Subsequently the <b>consociation</b> pronounced a sentence of non-communion against them, and declared the ministers and delegates of the ordaining council to be “disorderly persons, and not fit to sit. in any of our ecclesiastical councils until they shall clear up their conduct {{to the satisfaction of}} the <b>consociation</b> of New Haven county.” The controversy was essentially between the Old and New Light parties. Mr. Dana was regarded as a partisan of the liberal school of Boston, and the ministers forming the <b>consociation</b> of New Haven were little disposed to have one of their prominent churches committed to the care of a pastor whom they considered as having departed so far from their own standard of Christian doctrine. Mr. Dana and the ordaining clergy then formed an association by themselves, which continued until about 1772, when the controversy was terminated by pacific overtures made by the ministers then constituting the <b>consociation.</b> It is evident that the ordination was a departure from the Saybrook Platform, because the ordaining council was not limited to the <b>consociation.</b> It was tantamount to an assertion of independence of the church, in disregard of the platform. The members of the council were regarded as inclining to Arminianism. However, the prejudice against Mr. Dana gradually disappeared, and he made himself very popular by the decided stand that he took in favor of the American cause in the events that led to the American Revolution. His patriotic sermons, delivered in New Haven while the legislature was in session, were effective in winning many to his support. In 1789 he became pastor of the first church in New Haven, and was installed on 29 April. Here he came into controversy with Jonathan Edwards and Samuel Austin; but, for the most part, his ministry was peaceful, though not eminently successful. He was succeeded in this pastorate by the Rev. Moses Stuart in 1805, but his relation was severed only by an ecclesiastical council. This procedure deeply wounded Dr. Dana, and thereafter he worshiped in the college chapel, although subsequent to Mr. Stuart's departure he again appeared in his old church and officiated as moderator at the installation of Dr. N. W. Taylor in April, 1812. The University of Edinburgh conferred on him the degree of D. D. in 1768. He published, besides memorial and other sermons, “Examination of Edwards on the Will,” anonymous (Boston, 1770), and “An Examination of the Same Continued” (New Haven, 1773).|$|E

On the other hand, self-guided ideologization is over average in the case of incumbents with university degrees, high political interest and those give more weight to “personal conviction” than to public opinion, party positions or other board members when they make their political decisions.

The Dalmatian Pine woods are limited in their horizontal distribution to the noth-western part of Biokovo showing a decidedly relict character. The <b>consociations</b> are mostly developed in the districts: Borovac, Borovik, Bukovac, Pakline and Nevistina stijena (see the geographic map nearly). As to the vertical distribution there is a higher zone lying in the height of 1100 — 1500 m above the sea level to which the woods on Borovac, Borovik and Bukovac are belonging (see profil I), and a lower zone with a height of about 500 — 900 m above the sea level the woods of which are distributed in Pakline and Nevistina stijena (see profil II). The woods of the higher zone are situated between the submediterranean area and the maritime beechwood area (in the stony ground vegetation area i. e. Seslerio-Juniperetum sibiricae), while the woods of the lower zone are located thoroughly inside the area of the submediterranean climax wood Seslerio-Ostryetum carpinifoliae. In regard to the phytocoenological appertainence there is stated on the basis of a greater number of phytocoenological records, that we may consider the woods of the higher zone as a separate subassotiation of a typical community of stony ground vegetation areas, with which their are very relative; therefore the name Seslerio-Juniperetum sibiricae pinetosum dalmaticae Domac is used for them, because even the stony ground vegetation areas are treated here for the first time under the name Seslerio-Juniperetum sibiricae (Horvat) Domac (see table I). Besides the Dalmatian Pine the most characteristic plants of these communities are Juniperus sibirica and Sesleria robusta (S. nitida). The structure and the composition of these woods are shown in details on the table II. For the woods of the lower zone it has been shown that they represent in accordance with the earlier expressed concept of Horvatic (1958 : 83) only a facies of the submediterranean climax — wood Seslerio- Ostryetum carpinifoliae and are therefore comprehended under the term Seslerio-Ostryetum pinosum dalmaticae Horvatic.

Participants do exercise some agency in choosing and shaping how they collaborate, but several areas of external influences also bear on the shape of particular collaborations. ^ This conceptual model points researchers toward a flexible, data-driven framework, to account for the complexity of collaboration and acts of co-authoring. The model has potential for use in all fields of knowledge creation, should collaboration researchers repeat the protocols of the study and map collaborative events using spheres of influences (or <b>consociations)</b> and identifying where those influences converge to answer an exigency, resulting in a unique mode and outcome of the collaboration. ^ Armed with knowledge of a disciplinary view of collaboration and the conceptual model posited, researchers in rhetoric and composition, as well as in the humanities and science, may push forward in a search for new ways of extending knowledge through collaboration and co-authoring, as well as creating clearer rewards and necessary supports for those who engage in co-authoring for professional development and teaching in the Academy. ...|$|R

Many features associated with <b>consociation</b> have been present in the colonial and the postcolonial constitutions, such as separate communal representation, group rights, asymmetrical autonomy, power sharing, separate educational systems, and entrenchment of rights to culture and land. Norms regarding indigenous peoples' rights have been invoked, as well, adding an extra twist to the integration-consociation polarity.

The soils compared all formed on the same landscape (high river terrace), in the same parent material (outwash), with the same organisms (trees followed by prairie) over the same amount of time (about 11, 000 years). Soil profiles were described and soil horizons were analyzed for bulk density, soil texture, pH, soil organic carbon (SOC), inorganic carbon, and mineralogy. The sola sampled are typically loams or clay loams in the upper part of the profiles and gravelly sandy loams in the lower part. Several trends in the soil properties and morphologies were observed that co-vary with the MAP and MAT climate gradients. The SOC in the upper solum decreases from NW to SE while SOC in lower solum increases from NW to SE. The clay amount and mean particle size of the fine earth fraction are correlated. The southernmost location’s sola had fewer coarse fragments, but about 5 % more clay in the B horizons. Bulk density increases with depth, but no trend across the three locations was observed. No trend in pH could be determined due to the legacy of land management. Soil survey map accuracy was found to be poor with only seven sola from the 25 sites matching the dominant soil series in their respective <b>consociations.</b> Depth to carbonate minerals increases approximately 10 cm every 50 km from NNW to SSE. The mass per area of carbonates leached to the depth of effervescence ranges from approximately 1600 Mg/ha in the NW to 5100 Mg/ha in the SE. Data collected and analyzed in this project support the hypothesis that the loamy soil textures observed in the upper solum are primarily due to geological processes such as a waning flow event following a high flow event during the Late Wisconsinan. However, with primary carbonate minerals comprising around 25 % of the outwash’s mass, leaching of carbonates from the upper solum could also be a significant pedological process that helped alter texture...|$|R

40|$|The thesis {{considers}} ethno-territorial {{conflicts in}} which there are two conflict groups with corresponding ‘reference states’. ‘Reference states’ are internationally recognised states with co-nationals in the aforementioned disputed territory. The literature on ethno-national conflict regulation largely neglects the potential constructive role of ‘reference states’. In particular, Arend Lijphart’s work on consociational democracy focuses on elite accommodation within the conflict zone, but views other agents as ‘external’ to the dispute. Unlike most of the current ethnic conflict literature, the thesis will use a theoretical approach to derive the features of a settlement, not distil traits from purely empirical research. An informal model is employed assuming that that a military option is not open to reference states and that disengagement from the co-nationals is costly. The actions of the reference state are simplified to four options: remaining at the same level of conflict, escalating the dispute, attempting cooperation, or disengaging from the dispute. The features derived for the resulting transnational <b>consociation</b> settlement are: durable reference state/conational links, bipartisanship within reference states, intergovernmentalism between reference states, and consociational democracy internal to the disputed territory. The thesis then focuses on the post-conflict power-sharing settlements in Bosnia- Hercegovina and in Northern Ireland to investigate the features of transnational <b>consociation</b> in these two cases. The settlement after the Belfast Agreement exhibits the traits of transnational <b>consociation,</b> with a strong intergovernmental Dublin- London axis acting as reliable long-term guarantors of the settlement. By contrast, there is little intergovernmentalism between Zagreb and Belgrade regarding the settlement in Bosnia-Hercegovina. The post-conflict institutions are held together by international agencies that do not have as durable a link to the conflict zone as the ‘reference states’. Therefore, a durable transnational <b>consociation</b> with the ‘reference states’ as guarantors is more likely in Northern Ireland than in Bosnia-Hercegovina.
