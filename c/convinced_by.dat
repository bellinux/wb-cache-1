Although initially unwilling, Tiku was reportedly <b>convinced</b> <b>by</b> civilians who reminded him that his mother– {{who had died in}} the siege– needed to be buried. After three days of peaceful intermingling, on the night of 30 October the Dutch forces took over the fortress, appropriated all weapons, and captured Tiku. He and his soldiers were forced to go to Tondon.|$|E

Judge Cross established a fifty-year lease of Gladstone Park for this event after he was <b>convinced</b> <b>by</b> Oregon City author Eva Emery Dye that doing so would be a boon to the city and its people. Beginning on July 24–26, 1894, the newly formed Willamette Valley Chautauqua Association held an annual summer assembly that offered performances, lectures, and concerts. This event would reoccur annually, until Gladstone's Chautauqua Park grew to be the third-largest permanent Chautauqua assembly park in the United States.|$|E

50|$|All too often, in Adamson's view, {{people go}} through their lives without living or seeking any belief. This, for him, is the supreme {{attractiveness}} of Blaise Pascal, whose philosophy is of a unique kind: grounded in the vagaries of human nature; not essentially seeking to <b>convince</b> <b>by</b> mathematics; and foreshadowing Søren Kierkegaard and 20th-century existentialism in its appeal to human experience.|$|R
40|$|Using Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) {{for solving}} nonlinear, {{multimodal}} and non-di#erentiable optimization problems has {{gained increasing attention}} in recent years. Based on the social behavior and interaction of swarms like bird flocks, the method of Particle Swarm Optimization was introduced in 1995.

Using the pseudonym Christiane Latte for her tracks Ab 18 and Blondes Gift she performed as sassy as many of her male colleagues.The ironic dig at the male-dominated rap-branche was made with intent.|$|R

He doth not say, [...] "by the light of Christ in their consciences," [...] Mark that: Now I knowing, that a man may be convinced, and yet not by the Spirit of Christ (for he may be without that) but by nature itself (1Cor 11:14). I do admonish every soul if they love themselves, to beg of God for Jesus Christ his sake, that he would not only let them be <b>convince</b> <b>by</b> these poor, low, empty, beggarly things (their consciences) in respect of the Spirit of Christ, but that he would <b>convince</b> them <b>by</b> that Spirit of his effectually, which is not only able to show their lost state because of sins against the law, but also, to lead them to the right Saviour, and plant them into him, which all other things are not able to do.

5|$|The {{series was}} created by Japanese manga artist Kazuhiko Katō under the pen name Monkey Punch. His {{inspiration}} for the series was the fictional French gentleman thief Arsène Lupin, created by Maurice Leblanc. Before creating the series he read 15 of Leblanc's stories. The aim of the Lupin III series was to produce a comedy adventure series that reflected the traits of Leblanc's character. Originally the intention {{was to keep the}} blood ties between the two fictional characters secret, however he was <b>convinced</b> <b>by</b> others not to do so.|$|E
5|$|Theophilos, in turn, was {{hesitant}} {{to believe the}} accusations, and was eventually <b>convinced</b> <b>by</b> the protovestiarios (chamberlain) Leo Chamodrakon and the synkellos John the Grammarian of his general's innocence.

John was indeed able to see Manuel in private and offered him the Emperor's pardon, which Manuel seemed to accept, although for the time being, Manuel remained publicly loyal to his Abbasid allegiance.|$|E
5|$|Adamant {{was based}} at the Nore, {{operating}} in the North Sea and blockading the Dutch fleet at the Texel with Admiral Adam Duncan's fleet. In May 1797 mutiny broke out among the ships at the Nore, following on from one at Spithead earlier in the year. Of the two-decker ships of the fleet, only the crews of Duncan's flagship , and Hotham's crew aboard Adamant remained loyal. With only two ships available to blockade the Dutch, Duncan and Hotham took their ships out to sea, remaining in sight of the Dutch coast and for several weeks implied by false signals and manoeuvres, {{that the rest of}} the fleet was just over the horizon. <b>Convinced</b> <b>by</b> the impersonation that the blockade was still in force, the Dutch remained in port. Duncan and Hotham were later reinforced by the Russian squadron based at Harwich, and then by ships deserting the mutiny one by one.|$|E

5|$|After the October Tour, U2 decamped to {{a rented}} cottage in Howth, where they lived, wrote new songs, and rehearsed for their third album, War. Significant musical {{breakthroughs}} were {{achieved by the}} Edge in August 1982 during a two-week period of independent songwriting, while the other band members vacationed and Bono honeymooned with his wife Ali. From September to November, the group recorded War at Windmill Lane Studios. Lillywhite, who had a policy of not working with an artist more than twice, was <b>convinced</b> <b>by</b> the group to return as their producer for a third time. The recording sessions featured contributions from violinist Steve Wickham and the female singers of Kid Creole and the Coconuts. For the first time, Mullen agreed to play drums to a click track to keep time. After completing the album, U2 undertook a short tour of Western Europe in December.|$|E
5|$|After the {{conclusion}} of the battle for the Donets, as the spring rasputitsa (mud) season came to an end in 1943, both the German and Soviet commands considered their plans for future operations. The Soviet premier Joseph Stalin and some senior Soviet officers wanted to seize the initiative first and attack the German forces inside the Soviet Union, but they were <b>convinced</b> <b>by</b> a number of key commanders, including the Deputy Supreme Commander Georgiy Zhukov, to assume a defensive posture instead. This would allow the German side to weaken themselves in attacking prepared positions, after which the Soviet forces would be able to respond with a counter-offensive.|$|E
5|$|After {{the fall}} of his stronghold in Kediri, Trunajaya managed to escape to the {{mountains}} of eastern Java. VOC and the king's forces chased Trunajaya, who, isolated and deprived of food, surrendered to the VOC {{at the end of}} 1679. Initially, he was treated with respect as a captive of the VOC commander. However, during a ceremonial visit to the royal residence in Payak, East Java, on 2 January 1680, he was personally stabbed by Amangkurat, and the king's courtiers finished him off. The king defended this killing of a VOC prisoner by saying that Trunajaya had tried to kill him. The VOC was not <b>convinced</b> <b>by</b> this explanation, but it chose not to call the king into account. A romanticised account of Trunajaya's death appears in the 18th-century Central Javanese babads.|$|E

5|$|At {{the time}} of commissioning, Douglas Henshall and Daniel Craig were {{considered}} for the parts of Brown and Blair respectively, though David Morrissey and Michael Sheen were eventually announced as the leads in March 2003. Morrissey gained two stone for his role and had his hair permed and dyed. He researched Brown's background by travelling to Kirkcaldy—where Brown grew up—and reviewing numerous biographies and information about the Treasury. In comparison to his preparation for the BBC thriller State of Play, Morrissey discovered that no politicians wanted {{to help him with}} his research, so he turned to journalists Jon Snow and Simon Hoggart. Director Stephen Frears was unfamiliar with his previous work and had to be <b>convinced</b> <b>by</b> other production staff to cast him.|$|E
5|$|Broccoli and Hunt {{eventually}} chose Lazenby {{after seeing}} {{him in a}} Fry's Chocolate Cream advertisement. Lazenby dressed the part by sporting several sartorial Bond elements such as a Rolex Submariner wristwatch and a Savile Row suit (ordered for, but uncollected, by Connery), and going to Connery's barber at the Dorchester Hotel. Broccoli noticed Lazenby as a Bond-type man based on his physique and character elements, and offered him an audition. The position was consolidated when Lazenby accidentally punched a professional wrestler, who was acting as stunt coordinator, in the face, impressing Broccoli with his ability to display aggression. Lazenby was offered a contract for seven films; however, he was <b>convinced</b> <b>by</b> his agent Ronan O'Rahilly that the secret agent would be archaic in the liberated 1970s, {{and as a result}} he left the series after the release of On Her Majesty's Secret Service in 1969.|$|E
