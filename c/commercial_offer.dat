40|$|In {{this study}} we propose a method for the {{automatic}} extraction of Visual Attributes from images.

To increase the performance of the visual attributes extraction, the results provided by the previous step have been refined with an a priori prob-ability which models the occurrence of each visual attribute with a specific product type, opportunely estimated on the dataset. ...|$|R

5000|$|Madoka Wakamatsu is {{the stage}} name of Chisato Kurebayashi (Kurebayashi Chisato). Madoka is Fullmoon's rival {{in the music}} industry, who {{at the same time}} befriends 12-year-old Mitsuki. While talented, she is {{constantly}} upstaged by Fullmoon because she initially lacks the heart Mitsuki gives her songs. In addition, she is insecure because she had plastic surgery to make herself beautiful as a celebrity and was disowned by her family as a result. Madoka has a small pig called Gu-chan (ぐっちゃん), who worships her. Although she sometimes takes out her anger on Gu-chan, she is genuinely fond of him. In the manga, Madoka is shown as having pride as well as ambition: she refuses to cheat to win over Fullmoon, even once resigning a <b>commercial</b> <b>offer</b> to Fullmoon when she realizes that Fullmoon would have won if Madoka hadn't inadvertently stolen her lyrics. In the anime, Madoka is not above using underhanded tactics to best Fullmoon and does so several times, although she eventually changes her ways--particularly after learning some humility the hard way. In both versions, Madoka cares very much about Mitsuki/Fullmoon {{by the end of the}} story. At the end of the anime, Madoka brings Mitsuki flowers following her surgery, and at the end of the manga, Madoka cries when thinking about Fullmoon having cancer: [...] "Why? Why does it have to be her?" [...] (chapter 29).|$|E
