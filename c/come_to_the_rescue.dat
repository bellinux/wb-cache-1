5|$|The men at Boulogne {{formed the}} core for what Napoleon would later call La Grande Armée. At the start, this French army had about 200,000 men {{organized}} into seven corps, which were large field units that contained 36 to 40 cannon each and {{were capable of}} independent action until other corps could <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>rescue.</b> A single corps (properly situated in a strong defensive position) could survive {{at least a day}} without support, giving the Grande Armée countless strategic and tactical options on every campaign.|$|E
5|$|Paskevich, who {{observed}} the artillery duel from Fort 55, {{became convinced that}} his Polish counterpart would not <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>rescue</b> of Fort 56. Initially hesitant, he finally ordered Russian infantry to attack Fort 56 around 10:00. The attack {{was carried out by}} 13 infantry battalions (ca. 6,900 men) from columns commanded by General Lüders and Martinov. The forces of Lüders stormed the obstacles and crossed the stockade, but Polish defenders met them with rifle volleys from within the fort, and the attack was repelled. Lüders quickly ordered his second line (2,300 men) to advance as well. The new forces were twice pushed back into the moat by the commander of the northern wing, Maj. Franciszek Biernacki, but in the end the Polish defenders were overpowered and had to withdraw further into the fort. The Russians followed, but their battalions lost cohesion, which allowed the numerically inferior force under Biernacki to hold out inside the fort and cover the flank of the central wing.|$|E
25|$|The {{expedition}} {{had only}} survived through {{the strength and}} endurance of the Zanzibari porters and askaris, {{as well as the}} tendency of a loyal core of them, epitomised by Hamadi bin Malum, to <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>rescue</b> when mutiny, treachery, robbery or some other disaster threatened.|$|E

25|$|The peasants {{are fairly}} well off, as {{the soil is}} rich, the {{abundant}} water-supply free, and the taxation comparatively light. It was always interesting to meet them taking their live stock into market. Flocks of sheep with tiny lambs, black and white, pattered along the dusty road; here a goat followed its master like a dog, trotting behind the diminutive ass which the farmer bestrode; or boys, clad in the whity-brown native cloth, shouted incessantly at donkeys almost invisible under enormous loads of forage, or carried fowls and ducks in bunches head downwards, a sight that always made me long to <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>rescue</b> of the luckless birds.|$|E
25|$|Gardiner further hypothesises {{that the}} ship that was hit by the Titanic was the one seen by the Californian firing {{distress}} rockets, and that this explains the perceived inaction of the Californian (which traditionally is seen as failing to <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>rescue</b> of the Titanic after sighting its distress rockets). Gardiner's hypothesis is that the Californian, another IMM ship, was not expecting rockets but a rendezvous. The ice {{on the deck of}} the Titanic is explained by Gardiner as ice from the rigging of both the Titanic and the mystery ship she hit. As for the true Titanic, Gardiner alleges that she spent 25 years in service as the Olympic and was scrapped in 1935.|$|E

25|$|Towards {{the end of}} the novel, Dolores Umbridge – the school's {{politically}} appointed headmistress – captures Harry and interrogates {{him about}} Dumbledore's whereabouts. She sends for Snape, demanding that he provide the magical truth serum Veritaserum in order to force Harry to reveal any information he may be hiding. Snape claims that his supplies of the serum have been exhausted after Umbridge used the drug to force information about Dumbledore's Army from Cho Chang. It is later revealed that Snape had in fact supplied Umbridge with fake Veritaserum on the prior attempt. Snape then carries Harry's cryptic warning about Sirius' capture to the other Order members, allowing them to <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>rescue</b> in the Department of Mysteries. Harry still holds Snape partly responsible for Sirius' death, believing Snape's goading spurred Sirius into joining the battle.|$|E
25|$|The stormy sea created big {{problems}} for the torpedo boats when their propellers were lifted {{too close to the}} surface. This reduced their efficiency and what worsened the situation {{was the fact that the}} S2s bearings were worn out, which caused a lot of vibrations in the ship and threatened to open up a leak where the shaft went through the hull. Both of the torpedo boats began taking in water in the high seas. This was mainly due to the construction of the superstructure. The coal was also slowly running out since the crew had to feed more into the boilers than usual due to the high seas. The flotilla leader Klas Horn sent out a distress call on behalf of the torpedo boats. The rescue ship Protector, which was located in Vaasa, received the distress call through the Finnish headquarters in Helsinki, and the message was also received by the Swedish rescue vessel Helios. Both promised that they would <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>rescue.</b>|$|E
25|$|The protagonists {{make their}} way to Firsthome and the Court, but are treated there with {{relative}} indifference. They pick up a new friend, Roofshadow, and go northwest. They are captured by a group of evil cats called the Clawguard, and taken to Vastnir, an enormous mound far to the north, where the evil cat-god Grizraz Hearteater enslaves cats to take over the world, swollen in size and sitting upon a mound of dead and dying creatures. Tailchaser needs to alert the outside world and especially the court about his evil doings. Soon, Roofshadow creates a hole from above ground, and Tailchaser manages to escape, and races to Ratleaf Forest, where he asks a clan of squirrels to alert them for him in repayment for a debt contracted with their lord's brother. He feels guilty with Pouncequick, Eatbugs, and Roofshadow trapped in Vastnir because of him. He returns to the dreadful mound, where Quiverclaw and Prince Fencewalker, whom he had met at the court, <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>rescue.</b> Lord Hearteater creates the Fikos, a dog-like monster of terrible power, out of the mound of dying creatures he had been sitting on. Tailchaser takes advantage of the chaos to rescue Pouncequick, Eatbugs, and Roofshadow. They go through the havoc of Vastnir, and lose Eatbugs, the mad cat, on the way. Roofshadow and Pouncequick escape while Tailchaser goes back to find Eatbugs. He goes into a crevice and sees Eatbugs in a near-deathlike state, and feels dazed and confused. Upon Tailchaser's uttering a prayer to Lord Tangaloor Firefoot, Hearteater's brother, Eatbugs awakens, revealing himself to actually be Firefoot incognito. Tailchaser runs out of Vastnir at Firefoot's urging, and meets his friends, while Firefoot goes to deal with Hearteater, resulting in the destruction of Vastnir.|$|E

500|$|Though {{historians have}} {{generally}} shown understanding for Harclay's actions, it is nevertheless common {{to refer to}} the event as [...] "Harclay's treason". In the words of Maurice Keen: [...] "To make a truce, or to indeed to give safe-conducts or make any agreement with the king's enemies without proper grant of powers, again constituted lèse majesté and can be found defined as such in other military cases". Harclay had received such powers in February 1322, but he was considered to have overstepped his prerogative by the 1323 treaty. It is also possible that Edward held a grudge against Harclay for the latter's failure to <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>rescue</b> at Byland, and that this was behind the king's later, severe reaction. There is, however, no evidence that Harclay received the royal letter in time to arrive at the battlefield any earlier than he did.|$|E
500|$|The Beatles asked {{producer}} Martin to <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>rescue,</b> so {{he borrowed}} two four-track recorders from EMI, and long-time Beatles' engineer Geoff Emerick {{was given the}} task of building and setting up a studio with portable equipment. After Allen Klein {{was brought in to}} be the Beatles' manager in 1969, he closed Apple Electronics and Mardas left the company. It was later estimated that Mardas' ideas and projects had cost the Beatles at least £300,000 (£4.5 million in 2015 pounds). Starr once approved of one of Mardas’ ideas: [...] "He [...] had an idea to stop people taping our records off the radio – you’d have to have a decoder to get the signal, and then we thought we could sell the time and put commercials on instead. We brought EMI and Capitol in from America to look at it, but they weren’t interested at all".|$|E

500|$|... "Trapped Under Ice" [...] {{is about}} a person who wakes from a cryonic state. Realizing there is nowhere to go, and no-one will <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>rescue,</b> the person helplessly awaits {{impending}} doom. The song is built on a fast-picked galloping riff, reminiscent of the album's opener. It {{was inspired by a}} track Hammett's former band Exodus had demoed called [...] "Impaler", which was later released on that band's 2004 album Tempo of the Damned. [...] "Escape" [...] was originally titled [...] "The Hammer" [...] and was intended to be released as a single due to its lighter riffs and conventional song structure. The intro features a counterpoint bass melody and a chugging guitar riff that resolves into a standard down-stroked riff. Authors Mick Wall and Malcolm Dome felt the song was influenced by the album-oriented rock of 1970s bands such as Journey and Foreigner, but fans perceived it as an attempt for airplay at rock radio. Metallica performed [...] "Escape" [...] live only once, at the 2012 Orion Music+ More festival, while performing Ride the Lightning in its entirety.|$|E
500|$|Before the {{formation}} of the Third Coalition, Napoleon had assembled an invasion force, the Armée d'Angleterre, around six camps at Boulogne in Northern France.

The men at Boulogne formed the core for what Napoleon later called La Grande Armée.

500|$|The wind, tide and sea made it {{impossible}} for the Liverpool lifeboat to link up with the waiting tug for another tow, so the men were forced to start rowing home. [...] About twenty minutes later, as the boat reached the safer waters of the channel, the master elected to raise the foresail to help steady the vessel. [...] People in the lifeboat were still congratulating themselves on their lucky escape, when Captain Martin noticed a huge wave [...] "like a high wall" [...] approaching. He instructed everyone to hold on, fearing that someone might be washed overboard. [...] However rather than breaking over the boat, the wave lifted it and flipped it over. The boat was not self-righting, so the remaining survivors were left clinging desperately to the upturned boat. Rattlers master witnessed the incident, signaled to the New Brighton lifeboat, Willie and Arthur, which promptly turned around to <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>rescue.</b> The men who were on the capsized boat directed the New Brighton lifeboat to first assist three others who were in more danger clinging to bits of wood in the sea. After picking up the survivors and one casualty, the New Brighton lifeboat was taken in tow by Rattler, which brought her back to New Brighton. [...] Six of Ellen Southards crew, the captain and his wife, as well as the pilot and three lifeboat men from Mersey Docks drowned or died of exposure (12 fatalities in total).|$|E
