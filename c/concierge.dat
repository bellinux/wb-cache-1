5|$|For {{many years}} it was {{believed}} that Alkan met his death when a bookcase toppled over and fell on him as he reached for a volume of the Talmud from a high shelf.

He had possibly fainted, bringing it down on himself while grabbing out for support. He was reportedly carried to his bedroom and died later that evening. The story of the bookcase may have its roots in a legend told of Aryeh Leib ben Asher, rabbi of Metz, the town from which Alkan's family originated.|$|E
