500|$|In chapter seven, Cochrane {{approaches}} {{issues relating}} to animals and the environment. He first argues {{for the importance of}} this kind of analysis, before saying that, under the interest-based rights approach, non-conscious entities (including species, ecosystems and plants) cannot be understood to have rights; he then defends the necessity of consciousness for the possession of interests. Cochrane considers, but rejects, the land ethic of Aldo Leopold as a basis for the moral status of the environment, but instead defends the environment on welfare grounds. Though he rejects the notion that wild animals might own the land on which they live, Cochrane concludes that we have strict environmental obligations due to the rights and interests of sentient animals. Concerning endangered species, Cochrane rejects the notion of [...] "superkilling" [...] (that a special wrong is involved in wiping out a species) and the idea of [...] "compensatory justice" [...] (that more is owed to members of endangered species as a form of compensation). Instead, Cochrane argues that unconscious species may have <b>contingent</b> <b>value,</b> and members of rare conscious species may have a stronger right to life due to the interests of humans who will want to see them and the interests of other animals in their ecosystems Cochrane then argues that animals possess a concrete right not to be killed in order to preserve a favoured ecosystem, whether because of overpopulation of the species or because species are nonnative. However, control by contraception is argued to be acceptable.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the {{temporal}} stability of dichotomous choice (DC) <b>contingent</b> <b>values</b> and models and the implication of time related aspects for benefits transfer as a viable valuation method. From a practical point of view, time {{plays an important role}} in benefits transfer. Results are used from studies often carried out years ago and the obvious question is to what extent the estimated values and models stand the test of time. In the case of value function transfer, this implies testing the robustness of the estimated coefficient estimates over time. The novelty of the temporal stability work presented here is that two identical DC contingent valuation (CV) studies of the health risks associated with bathing water quality were carried out before and during extreme weather conditions causing the closure of bathing locations for public health reasons. Differences in <b>contingent</b> <b>values</b> and models before and during the extreme event are tested. The extreme event causes the seasonal good in question to become temporarily scarcer and marginal WTP is therefore expected to be higher during the extreme event than before, but not that underlying preferences have changed. Hence, basically two things are tested: the effect of time on stated preferences for a seasonal good and the effect of the extreme event on these preferences. WTP values before and during the event appear to be robust, also when accounting for substitution effects. The results before and during the extreme event remain transferable when accounting for theoretically expected factors in a simple multivariate transfer model. However, when introducing additional and contextual 'ad hoc' factors in the model, the estimated models and their random components become significantly different and hence not transferable, suggesting that unobserved preferences may not have been randomly distributed across the two surveys after all. © 2006 Elsevier B.

5000|$|After {{looking at}} agriculture, Cochrane {{considers}} {{the relationship between}} animals and genetic engineering. The question of whether an animal has a right not to be genetically engineered, he suggests, makes no sense, as live animals are not engineered, and embryos have no interests, so cannot have rights. Instead, Cochrane considers whether animals have a right {{not to have been}} engineered, arguing {{that it is not the}} case that they always do, and that if [...] "genetic engineering gives the animals lives with opportunities for well-being that are similar to or better than ordinary members of their species, then it is ordinarily permissible." [...] Cochrane then addresses four reasons to oppose this claim; first, the notion that genetic engineering instrumentalizes animals, second, the idea that genetic engineering is repugnant, third, that genetic engineering reveals a flaw in character (see virtue ethics) and fourth, that genetic engineering denies the dignity of animals. Cochrane finds none of these arguments reason to abandon the principle. Cochrane considers whether animals may ever have a right not to have been engineered. He argues that animals have a right not to be engineered such that they have lives not worth living. He then rejects some reasons for believing that animals have a right not to be engineered with diseases or disabilities, but concludes that they do, as engineered animals have an interest [...] "in having been engineered with sufficient opportunities for well-being", an interest which is strong enough to ground a concrete right. However, Cochrane argues that he is not advocating perfectionism, as he is concerned not with equal capacities between members of a species, but equal opportunities for well-being. Finally, Cochrane considers the possibility of engineering nonsentient, non-conscious livestock, arguing that, ordinarily, there is no wrong in engineering nonconscious entities.Chapter six addresses the use of animals in entertainment. Cochrane does not oppose the practice of pet-keeping, and accepts that humans do have an interest in being able to keep pets, but that this interest is not so strong that it can be satisfied at any cost. He argues that pet-keeping should be regulated far more than it is, perhaps through the need for a license, the granting of which would be dependent on individuals proving their ability to care for the animal's well-being. Cochrane is open to euthanizing pets, but only in cases when medical care could not give them a chance at further good experiences. In these cases, providing medical care would be necessary (pet insurance could be a requirement for a license). Neutering pets is argued to be neither a violation of their rights nor a requirement, but anyone who does not have their pets neutered would be required to ensure the wellbeing of any offspring. The same requirements as were established in the chapter on genetic engineering are applied to animal breeding, and Cochrane accepts that this may lead to the extinction of certain breeds. Concerning zoos and circuses, Cochrane argues that animals do not possess a right not to be kept or displayed, but they do possess a right not to be made to suffer. This imposes limitations on the kinds of animals which can be kept (for instance, large animals could not realistically be kept by traveling circuses), the conditions in which they are kept, and the nature of their performances. Hunting, cockfighting, dogfighting, bear baiting and bullfighting are condemned, as is, after some consideration, fishing. Cochrane is potentially open to greyhound and horse racing, or equestrianism generally, but says that [...] "the way that these sports are currently organized and practiced does involve the routine suffering and death of animals and ought to be condemned as such." [...] Such practices include suffering caused during training and racing, and the killing of animals past their peak or who do not display the requisite skills. Before concluding the chapter, Cochrane considers, but rejects, three possible objections to any use of animals in entertainment: first, by appeal to a concept of dignity, which use of the animals undermines; second, an appeal to disrespect, whether or not harm is caused; and third, that the use of animals in entertainment implies ownership, and animals have a right not to be considered property.In chapter seven, Cochrane approaches issues relating to animals and the environment. He first argues for the importance of this kind of analysis, before saying that, under the interest-based rights approach, non-conscious entities (including species, ecosystems and plants) cannot be understood to have rights; he then defends the necessity of consciousness for the possession of interests. Cochrane considers, but rejects, the land ethic of Aldo Leopold as a basis for the moral status of the environment, but instead defends the environment on welfare grounds.

In a meta-analysis of 26 international stated preference studies, a Bayesian model is estimated regressing <b>contingent</b> <b>values</b> for mortality risk reductions, originating from three different risk contexts, on the characteristics of the risk reduction itself and additional variables characterizing the underlying studies. A willingness to pay (WTP) premium for mortality risk reductions in the air pollution and general mortality risk context relative to improving road safety is observed. Evaluated at the mean, road safety VSL estimates should be multiplied by a factor 1. 8 before being applicable in the air pollution context. Moreover, in an illustrative BT exercise we find limited overlap in the set of context specific predictive VSL distributions.

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we argue that}} the burgeoning {{empirical}} debate over scope sensitivity within contingent valuation studies is fundamentally incomplete in {{that the effect of}} study design upon observed scope has largely been ignored. In particular we highlight the frequently overlooked fact that in many common study designs the choice set initially offered (or 'visible') to respondents is changed in a stepwise disclosure manner as they progress through a valuation exercise. Conversely, other designs give advance disclosure regarding {{the full extent of the}} final visible choice set prior to any choices or values being elicited. Although this issue has been raised within this journal by several commentators (e. g. Kahneman and Knetsch, 1992; Smith, 1992) it has not been formally tested. We present laboratory and field tests of the impact upon <b>contingent</b> <b>values</b> of varying the visible choice set through stepwise and advanced disclosure modes using exclusive choices throughout (i. e., providing a situation in which procedural variance is not expected). These dimensions of design are interacted with changes in the order in which nested goods are presented (bottom-up versus top-down). We find that when a stepwise disclosure procedure is adopted the observed scope sensitivity is substantially and significantly affected by the order in which goods are presented but such procedural invariance is not observed within advanced disclosure designs. Conjectures regarding the origin and implication of such findings are presented...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{develops}} a spectral expansion {{approach to the}} valuation of contingent claims when the underlying state variable follows a one-dimensional diffusion with the infinitesimal variance a 2 (x), drift b(x) and instantaneous discount (killing) rate r(x). The Spectral Theorem for self-adjoint operators in Hilbert space yields the spectral decomposition of the <b>contingent</b> claim <b>value</b> function. Based on the Sturm–Liouville (SL) theory, we classify Feller’s natural boundaries into two further subcategories: non-oscillatory and oscillatory/non-oscillatory with cutoff Λ ≥ 0 (this classification {{is based on the}} oscillation of solutions of the associated SL equation) and establish additional assumptions (satisfied in nearly all financial applications) that allow us to completely characterize the qualitative nature of the spectrum from the behavior of a, b and r near the boundaries, classify all diffusions satisfying these assumptions into the three spectral categories, and present simplified forms of the spectral expansion for each category. To obtain explicit expressions, we observe that the Liouville transformation reduces the SL equation to the one-dimensional Schrödinger equation with a potential function constructed from a, b and r. If analytical solutions are available for the Schrödinger equation, inverting the Liouville transformation yields analytical solutions for the original SL equation, and the spectral representation for the diffusion process can be constructed explicitly.

This study investigates the validity of <b>contingent</b> <b>values</b> in this context by reference to measures of attitude and of individuals' perceived motivation using a set of nested environmental goods (various levels of water quality improvement). Endorsement of the new ecological paradigm is found to be a good predictor of the perceived importance of certain motives for WTP (deriving from existence, anthropocentric intrinsic and bequest values), and of WTP for environmental improvement itself to the extent that these motives are perceived as important. The importance of these motives dominates that of others, such as those linked to private or social use value, and is positively associated with WTP, as is the extent of perceived personal responsibility. Moreover, all these relationships with WTP are reflected in an enhanced sensitivity of WTP to the scope of the good provided. However, WTP values are unaffected by {{the extent to which the}} individual feels under some general moral obligation to contribute to good causes. The findings support the internal validity of the WTP values elicited and suggest that the importance of motives deriving from certain nonuse values are more significant determinants of WTP than others, at least for the resource studied here...|$|R
