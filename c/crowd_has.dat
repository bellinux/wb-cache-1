The game begins badly for the McKinley side, and when Tina is injured during a play, captain Finn Hudson (Cory Monteith) takes control of the situation. He has club member Puck (Mark Salling) convince the former football players to return, and convinces cheerleaders Santana (Naya Rivera), Brittany (Heather Morris) and his ex-girlfriend Quinn (Dianna Agron) to quit the cheer squad and perform at the halftime show.

The Prince, though shaken, is not {{particularly}} surprised at this development. For the remainder of the day, he calmly fulfills his social obligations to guests and members of the public. The following morning he takes the first train to Petersburg and goes to Rogozhin's house, but he is told by servants that there is no one there. After several hours of fruitless searching, he returns to the hotel he was staying at when he last encountered Rogozhin in Petersburg. Rogozhin appears and asks him {{to come back to the}} house.

500|$|Roger Moore of the Orlando Sentinel {{gave the}} film {{one out of}} five stars saying, [...] "It's all bunk and has been for years. These are all no-win scenarios. Whatever moral lessons were {{presented}} in the earliest Saw films seem to have been dispensed with as the movies grow more and more gruesome, with filmmakers caught up in 'What would it look like if somebody's jaw was ripped out, or their skin was glued to a car seat?' Pandering to the 'Cool, let's see that again' <b>crowd</b> <b>has</b> made Lionsgate rich but done nothing for this unendurable endurance contest of this long-enduring film franchise". [...] Mike Hale of The New York Times called the film the most [...] "straightforward" [...] of the series and the [...] "most consistently (though not inventively) violent".

500|$|During his journey, {{while waiting}} for a Mississippi steamboat, Uncle Tom first meets little Eva, who with her father is also taking the boat south.

He of all the <b>crowd</b> <b>has</b> the courage to jump in and rescue the little girl. Eva's father to reward Tom for his bravery, buys him from Legree, and once more Tom {{knows what it is}} to be treated kindly. He lives happily as little Eva's special bodyguard until the little one is seized with a sudden sickness and dies. She had become greatly attached to Uncle Tom, and the last act of her life was to present him with a little locket containing her picture. Once more Uncle Tom is sold and again falls into the hands of Simon Legree. He is taken to Legree's plantation in Mississippi, where he is overworked and ill-treated to the point of death. Just before he dies he presses to his lips the locket with the picture of his beloved little girl and in a vision sees her in the clouds holding out her arms to him that he, too, may enter with her the pearly gates, inside of which all souls are equal, and all free. The comedy of the story is furnished by little Eva's Aunt Ophelia, a queer old lawyer named Marx, and his stubborn donkey, to say nothing of Topsy, a wicked little colored girl, who Aunt Ophelia tries hard to convert." ...|$|E

After being banned from the venue for disorderly behavior, they changed the name to the Replacements. In an unpublished memoir, Mars later explained the band's choice of name: [...] "Like maybe the main act doesn't show, and instead the <b>crowd</b> <b>has</b> to settle for an earful of us dirtbags....It seemed to sit just right with us, accurately describing our collective 'secondary' social esteem".|$|E

They fling their afflicted bodies at him, demanding miracle cures and divine secrets. After sneaking out the back, Brian is then finally captured and scheduled to be crucified. Meanwhile, yet another huge <b>crowd</b> <b>has</b> assembled outside the palace. Pontius Pilate (together with the visiting Biggus Dickus) tries to quell the feeling of revolution by granting them the choice of one person to be pardoned. The crowd, however, shouts out names containing the letter [...] "r", mocking Pilate's rhotacistic speech impediment.

2500|$|Paolo Albiani, a plebeian, {{tells his}} ally Pietro {{that in the}} {{forthcoming}} election of the Doge, his choice for the plebeian candidate is Simon Boccanegra. Boccanegra arrives and is persuaded to stand when Paolo hints that if Boccanegra becomes Doge, the aristocratic Jacopo Fiesco will surely allow him to wed his daughter Maria. When Boccanegra has gone, Paolo gossips about Boccanegra's love affair with Maria Fiesco – Boccanegra and Maria have had a child, and the furious Fiesco has locked his daughter away in his palace. Pietro rallies a crowd of citizens to support Boccanegra. After the <b>crowd</b> <b>has</b> dispersed, Fiesco {{comes out of his}} palace, stricken with grief; Maria has just died (Il lacerato spirito – [...] "The tortured soul of a sad father"). He swears vengeance on Boccanegra for destroying his family. When he meets Boccanegra he does not inform him of Maria's death. Boccanegra offers reconciliation and Fiesco promises clemency only if Boccanegra lets him have his granddaughter. Boccanegra explains he cannot because the child, put in the care of a nurse, has vanished. He enters the palace and finds the body of his beloved just before crowds pour in, hailing him as the new Doge.|$|E
2500|$|In {{spite of}} the disinterest in the Open Cup, some signs have {{indicated}} an upswing in the tournament importance and popularity. [...] Some cite the competitions' long history as {{a critical factor in}} driving interest. The 2009 final, which featured storied MLS club D.C. United, saw a crowd of 17,239 attend the Open Cup final at RFK Stadium, making it the second largest Open Cup crowd in the 2000s and fifth largest overall. The reasoning behind the large <b>crowd</b> <b>has</b> been attributed to the fact that D.C. United's management marketed the Open Cup as a tournament for the team to add an additional trophy to their collection and earn a preliminary berth in the CONCACAF Champions League. For the Seattle Sounders, the club played in and hosted the 2010 edition of the final, in front of a crowd of 31,311. It was the largest attendance for an Open Cup final thus far, outpacing the second largest crowd by slightly under 10,000. [...] Such a crowd was considered {{to be the result of}} the Sounders' large fan base and desire to defend their 2009 Open Cup title. [...] This trend of large crowds has continued, with all six finals since and including the 2009 final in the top nine overall in terms of attendance, including another record-breaking crowd in 2011, also in Seattle.|$|E
