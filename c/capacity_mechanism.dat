40|$|A {{variety of}} <b>capacity</b> <b>mechanisms</b> has been {{implemented}} across the European Union (EU) {{with the aim}} to safeguard the {{security of electricity supply}} by providing financial incentives for investment in generation capacity. A lack of coordination regarding the introduction and design of <b>capacity</b> <b>mechanisms</b> may result in market and competition distortions in the internal electricity market (IEM). The research has aimed to investigate how <b>capacity</b> <b>mechanisms</b> can be harmonized a EU-level on the condition that the impact of <b>capacity</b> <b>mechanisms</b> on the IEM is limited. The harmonization of three different elements related to <b>capacity</b> <b>mechanisms</b> was investigated in this study: harmonization of generation adequacy assessments, harmonization of cross-border participation in <b>capacity</b> <b>mechanisms</b> by the implementation of an EU framework on cross-border participation and the harmonization of key design features of <b>capacity</b> <b>mechanisms</b> by the development of a reference model. First, based on an analysis of EC regulation and modeling studies, conditions with respect to the introduction and design of <b>capacity</b> <b>mechanisms</b> were identified in order to ensure a limited impact on the IEM. Second, the feasibility of the harmonization of <b>capacity</b> <b>mechanisms</b> was assessed by identifying the rationale for harmonization from an IEM point of view, by identifying the support for harmonization and by identifying barriers to harmonization. The assessment of the feasibility of the harmonization of <b>capacity</b> <b>mechanisms</b> has resulted in the identification of feasible pathways for harmonization. Results of this study show that the harmonization of generation adequacy assessment is highly feasible as result of a strong rationale for harmonization together with high expert and stakeholder support and low barriers. Also the harmonization of cross-border participation is considered to be highly feasible. A strong rationale for an EU framework on cross-border participation exists due to the various risks that are associated with cross-border participation. Experts and stakeholders also support an EU framework on cross-border participation. A strong regional regulatory body will be required to reduce the risk that national governments will favor domestic security of supply over regional cooperation. With respect to the harmonization of key design feature of <b>capacity</b> <b>mechanisms</b> both the rationale and support by experts and stakeholders are weak. Moreover, significant barriers exist for the harmonization of key design features as different designs of <b>capacity</b> <b>mechanisms</b> are required by Member States {{as a result of the}} different needs regarding security of supply...|$|R

40|$|The {{push for}} clean energy {{has caused a}} rapid growth of {{renewables}} in the electricity supply mix of the EU. Although one would assume {{that the impact of}} these technologies is entirely positive, recent research and experience indicate that there is reason for concern namely regarding the security of supply. In this context, the concern is how renewable energy sources (RES) affect the business case of conventional power generation.  In response to this concern, <b>capacity</b> <b>mechanisms</b> are being considered or have already been implemented by various member states of the EU. However, in a highly interconnected electricity system, such as the one in Europe, {{there appears to be a}} risk that the uncoordinated implementation of <b>capacity</b> <b>mechanisms</b> may cause unintended cross-border effects. This research explored the performance of various <b>capacity</b> <b>mechanisms</b> in an electricity system with a strong growth in the portfolio share of variable renewable energy sources (RES). The cross-border effects of implementing various <b>capacity</b> <b>mechanisms</b> in an interconnected power system were also analyzed.  In this research, two <b>capacity</b> <b>mechanisms,</b> namely a strategic reserve and a capacity market, were modeled as extensions to the EMLab-Generation agent-based model. Furthermore, two variations of a capacity market were analyzed. The first was a yearly capacity market design and the second was a forward capacity market with long term contracts. A survey of experts on the US capacity markets supplemented the modeling work with practical insights.

40|$|In {{response}} to plans in France and the UK {{to implement a}} <b>capacity</b> <b>mechanism</b> and the recent implementation of a small strategic reserve in Germany, we {{address the question of}} the cross-border effects of national implementation of a <b>capacity</b> <b>mechanism</b> in Europe’s interconnected markets. We model some of the effects that may arise when different countries implement different types of capacity mechanisms. We draw conclusions with respect to generation adequacy policy in Europe. Capacity markets appear to be more effective than strategic reserve in attracting investment and securing supply in the long run, but may discourage investment in neighboring countries. A strategic reserve is easier to implement and does not have this negative externality, but its dynamic effectiveness is less certain and its effect may leak away across the border. The negative externality of a <b>capacity</b> <b>mechanism</b> may put pressure on neighboring countries to also implement a <b>capacity</b> <b>mechanism.</b> However, the proliferation of different types of capacity mechanisms – every category of <b>capacity</b> <b>mechanism</b> can be implemented in a myriad of different ways – creates a significant risk trade between countries will be increasingly distorted. Considering also the regulatory uncertainty that is brought about by this process and the risk of regulatory failure with implementing the more sophisticated capacity mechanisms such as capacity markets and reliability options, the positive effect on investment is not a given.

40|$|International audienceThis article {{analyses}} how a <b>capacity</b> <b>mechanism</b> {{can address}} {{security of supply}} objectives in a power market undergoing an energy transition that combines energy efficiency efforts to stabilise demand and a rapid increase {{in the proportion of}} renewables. To analyse this situation, power markets are simulated over the long term with a System Dynamics model integrating new investment and closure decisions. This last trait is relevant to studying investment in power generation in mature markets undergoing policy shocks. The energy-only market design with a price cap, with and without a <b>capacity</b> <b>mechanism,</b> is compared to scarcity pricing in two investment behaviour scenarios with and without risk aversion. The results show that the three market designs lead to different levels of risk for peaking unit investment and results thus differ according to which risk aversion hypothesis is adopted. Assuming a risk-neutral investor, the results indicate that compared to an energy-only market with a price cap at 3 000 €/MWh, an energy-only market with scarcity pricing and the market design with a <b>capacity</b> <b>mechanism</b> are two efficient options to reach similar levels of load loss.

To date, however, the debate on <b>capacity</b> <b>mechanisms</b> has largely been restricted to national contexts. Against this background, we discuss the feasibility and potential benefits of coordinated cross-border strategic reserves to safeguard electricity supply and aid the energy transition in Germany and neighboring countries at large. Setting aside strategic reserve capacity which is deployed only in the event of extreme supply shortages could improve the security of electricity supply without distorting the EU's internal electricity market. In addition, overall costs may decrease when reserve procurement and activation are coordinated among countries, particularly if combined with flow-based market coupling...|$|R
40|$|The thesis at hand {{includes}} three distinct essays that analyze economic {{issues related to}} liberalized electricity markets. In the first essay, the effects of <b>capacity</b> <b>mechanisms</b> on the market structure in electricity markets are investigated. We consider a model with dominant firms and a competitive fringe and analyze the impact of price caps and <b>capacity</b> <b>mechanisms</b> on investments and market concentration. Whereas in static models lower price caps reduce the potential to exercise market power, we show that in our two stage model with endogenous investments, lower price caps result {{in an increase in}} market concentration, a higher frequency of capacity withholding and larger profits for the dominant firms. The second essay analyzes cross-border effects of <b>capacity</b> <b>mechanisms.</b> We consider a model with two connected countries that only differ in their <b>capacity</b> <b>mechanisms,</b> namely strategic reserves or capacity payments. In both countries, competitive firms invest in generation capacity before selling electricity on the spot market. We show that different <b>capacity</b> <b>mechanisms</b> lead to redistribution effects such that the country with strategic reserves is worse off, meaning the consumer costs are higher in this country. The third essay deals with the value of wind power and, more specifically, with the impact of the spatial dependence of wind power on its market value. We create a stochastic simulation model for electricity spot prices that captures the full spatial dependence structure of wind power by using copulas. We then calibrate the model with German data. We show that the specific location of a turbine, i. e., its spatial dependence with respect to the aggregated wind power in the market, is extremely important in determining its value.

40|$|Abstract—We propose an ISO {{model for}} {{coordinating}} trans-mission expansion planning with competitive generation capacity planning in electricity markets. The {{purpose of the}} model is a holistic simulation of generation and transmission capacity expansion in the market environment. The solution represents an iterative process for simulating the interactions among GENCOs, TRANSCOs, and the ISO, which might be terminated by the ISO based on a pre-specified stopping criterion. The proposed model adopts a joint energy and transmission auction market and a <b>capacity</b> <b>mechanism.</b> The joint auction market enables competi-tion to occur among generation and transmission resources. The <b>capacity</b> <b>mechanism</b> offers incentives for market participant in-vestments that reflect the locational values of additional capacity. Transmission capacity expansion decisions are made by merchant transmission lines that recover their capacity investments through transmission marginal pricing and capacity payments. Trans-mission network security {{is reflected in the}} proposed competitive resource planning model.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{an analysis of}} recently enacted Russian renewable energy policy based on <b>capacity</b> <b>mechanism.</b> Considering its novelty and poor coverage by academic literature, {{the aim of the}} thesis is to analyze <b>capacity</b> <b>mechanism</b> influence on investors’ decision-making process. The current research introduces a number of approaches to investment analysis. Firstly, classical financial model was built with Microsoft Excel® and crisp efficiency indicators such as net present value were determined. Secondly, sensitivity analysis was performed to understand different factors influence on project profitability. Thirdly, Datar-Mathews method was applied that by means of Monte Carlo simulation realized with Matlab Simulink®, disclosed all possible outcomes of investment project and enabled real option thinking. Fourthly, previous analysis was duplicated by fuzzy pay-off method with Microsoft Excel®. Finally, decision-making process under <b>capacity</b> <b>mechanism</b> was illustrated with decision tree. Capacity remuneration paid within 15 years is calculated individually for each RE project as variable annuity that guarantees a particular return on investment adjusted on changes in national interest rates. Analysis results indicate that <b>capacity</b> <b>mechanism</b> creates a real option to invest in renewable energy project by ensuring project profitability regardless of market conditions if project-internal factors are managed properly. The latter includes keeping capital expenditures within set limits, production performance higher than 75 % of target indicators, and fulfilling localization requirement, implying producing equipment and services within the country. Occurrence of real option shapes decision-making process in the following way. Initially, investor should define appropriate location for a planned power plant where high production performance can be achieved, and lock in this location in case of competition. After, investor should wait until capital cost limit and localization requirement can be met, after that decision to invest can be made without any risk to project profitability. With respect to technology kind, investment into solar PV power plant is more attractive than into wind or small hydro power, since it has higher weighted net present value and lower standard deviation. However, it does not change decision-making strategy that remains the same for each technology type. Fuzzy pay-method proved its ability to disclose the same patterns of information as Monte Carlo simulation. Being effective in investment analysis under uncertainty and easy in use, it can be recommended as sufficient analytical tool to investors and researchers. Apart from described results, this thesis contributes to the academic literature by detailed description of capacity price calculation for renewable energy that was not available in English before. With respect to methodology novelty, such advanced approaches as Datar-Mathews method and fuzzy pay-off method are applied on the top of investment profitability model that incorporates capacity remuneration calculation as well. Comparison of effects of two different RE supporting schemes, namely Russian <b>capacity</b> <b>mechanism</b> and feed-in premium, contributes to policy comparative studies and exhibits useful inferences for researchers and policymakers. Limitations of this research are simplification of assumptions to country-average level that restricts our ability to analyze renewable energy investment region wise and existing limitation of the studying policy to the wholesale power market that leaves retail markets and remote areas without our attention, taking away medium and small investment into renewable energy from the research focus. Elimination of these limitations would allow creating the full picture of Russian renewable energy investment profile...|$|E

This article reviews the use of last resort capacity mechanisms in two other energy-only markets, Australia and New Zealand. The Australian National Electricity Market has infrequent price spikes up to A$ 12, 500 (Â£ 7800) /MWh. Option contracts have supported significant investment in peak capacity. The system operator also has an ability to contract reserve up to 9 months before projected shortfalls. Reserve has been contracted on two occasions but never dispatched. The New Zealand electricity market includes a reserve energy scheme which allows the system operator to contract and dispatch reserve capacity. One plant has been contracted under the scheme. The plant is currently offered into the market at NZ$ 5000 (Â£ 2300) /MWh. In both markets there have been concerns that reserve schemes could reduce the frequency of high prices and damage price signals for peak investment.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an analysis of}} different market designs under uncertainty about the future growth rate of demand. Markets for electricity generation appear {{to be prone to}} an investment cycle due to their capital-intensiveness and the long lead time of new generation facilities. We tested the stability of different <b>capacity</b> <b>mechanisms</b> in the presence of uncertainty regarding the demand growth rate with a stochastic dynamic model. Investment decisions were assumed to maximize profit, based on an assumed growth rate of demand that was equal to the rolling average of the previous five years. All <b>capacity</b> <b>mechanisms</b> proved effective in reducing the tendency towards an investment cycle, but to different degrees. Interestingly, an oligopoly that is able to raise average prices by 10 % would also be able to substantially reduce price volatility and decrease the risk of shortages by increasing the reserve margin. Benefits of such a strategy for the generating companies could be that it would deter new market entrants and stave off the political attention that shortages and price spikes would bring about. However, the benefits to consumers are compromised by the lack of economic efficiency and distributional effects of an oligopoly, while the stability of such an oligopolistic strategy can be questioned. The most attractive solution is a system of reliability contracts, which can be used to stabilize both investment and prices, while reducing market power and providing more efficient operational incentives to generating companies. ...|$|R

40|$|Uncertainty about demand {{levels and}} {{revenues}} on electricity markets introduces a risk for investors in generation technologies. These investments are coined by high fixed cost and face an increased dependency on scarce, or even uncertain high prices. Risk-averse behavior of investors {{might lead to}} suboptimal decision making and undermines generation adequacy. The interaction of market design and risk aversion is rarely treated in electricity market models. <b>Capacity</b> <b>mechanisms</b> are only poorly, or even not considered in modeling approaches focusing on risk aversion. Our contribution addresses two problems. First, we propose a methodology to assess risk-aversion and <b>capacity</b> <b>mechanisms</b> in a stochastic market equilibrium model. The equilibrium model comprises investment decisions and hourly dispatch. Generators, each investing in a grouped technology, are represented as risk-averse agents. The Conditional Value-at-Risk is used to represent risk aversion. An additional agent represents the aggregated consumers. Second, we propose an algorithm inspired by the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers to compute a Nash Equilibrium by iteratively adapting prices and the agents’ decisions. We benchmark our approach with a state-of-the-art solver relying on the Mixed Complementarity Problem reformulation. Our case study shows that for models with increasing numbers of scenarios and time steps integrating risk-averse conventional generators and renewable resources, our proposed approach is preferable.
