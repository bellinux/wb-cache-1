These equations are interpreted as quasi-local energy, linear momentum, and angular momentum <b>conservation</b> <b>equations.</b> In the asymptotic region of asymptotically flat spacetimes, it is shown that these quasi-local <b>conservation</b> <b>equations</b> reduce to the <b>conservation</b> <b>equations</b> of Bondi energy, linear momentum, and angular momentum, respectively. When restricted to the quasi-local horizon of a generic spacetime, which is defined without referring to the infinity, the quasi-local <b>conservation</b> <b>equations</b> coincide with the <b>conservation</b> <b>equations</b> on the stretched horizon studied by Price and Thorne. All of these quasi-local quantities are expressed as invariant two-surface integrals, and geometrical interpretations {{in terms of the}} area of a given two-surface and a pair of null vector fields orthogonal to that surface are given.

(2) To develop fundamental models for flow structure transitions based on stability theory and fluid particle interaction rates. This report details the derivation of the mass, momentum and energy <b>conservation</b> <b>equations</b> for a distribution of spherical, chemically non-reacting fluid particles of variable size and velocity.

2500|$|Conservation of momentum: In fluid dynamics, the {{mathematical}} formulation of this principle {{can be considered}} an application of Newton's Second Law. Momentum within a flow is only changed by the work performed on the system by external forces, which may include both surface forces, such as viscous (frictional) forces, and body forces, such as weight. [...] The momentum conservation principle may be expressed as either a vector equation or separated into a set of three scalar equations (x,y,z components). In its most complete form, the momentum conservation equations are known as the Navier-Stokes equations. [...] The Navier-Stokes equations have no known analytical solution and are solved in modern aerodynamics using computational techniques. Because of the computational cost of solving these complex equations, simplified expressions of momentum conservation may be appropriate for specific applications. The Euler equations are a set of momentum conservation equations which neglect viscous forces and {{may be used in}} cases where the effect of viscous forces is expected to be small.
