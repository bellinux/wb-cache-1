40|$|The author {{discuss a}} new {{conceptual}} framework for the convexification of discrete optimization problems, and a general technique for obtaining approximations to the convex hull of the feasible set. The concepts come from disjunctive programming and the key tool is {{a description of the}} convex hull of a union of polyhedra in terms of a higher dimensional polyhedron. Although this description was known for several years, only recently was it shown by Jeroslow and Lowe to yield improved representations of discrete optimization problems. The author expresses the feasible set of a discrete optimization problem as the intersection (conjunction) of unions of polyhedra, and define an operation that takes one such expression into another, equivalent one, with fewer conjuncts. He then introduces a <b>class</b> <b>of</b> <b>relaxations</b> based on replacing each conjunct (union of polyhedra) by its convex hull. The strength <b>of</b> the <b>relaxations</b> increases as the number of conjuncts decreases, and the <b>class</b> <b>of</b> <b>relaxations</b> forms a hierarchy that spans the spectrum between the common linear programming relaxation, and the convex hull of the feasible set itself. Instances where this approach presents advantages include critical path problems in disjunctive graphs, network synthesis problems, certain fixed charge network flow problems, etc. The approach on the first of these problems is illustrated, which is a model for machine sequencin...|$|R

In order to capture a broad range of matching scenarios, we provide a <b>class</b> <b>of</b> <b>relaxations</b> <b>of</b> the QAP under elastic net constraints. This allows us to regulate the sparsity/complexity trade-off which is inherent to most instances of the matching problem, thus enabling us to study the application of the acceleration method over a family of problems of varying difficulty. The validity of the approach is assessed by considering three different matching scenarios; namely, rigid and non-rigid three-dimensional shape matching, and image matching for Structure from Motion. As demonstrated on both real and synthetic data, our approach leads to an increase in performance of up to one order of magnitude when compared to the standard methods. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The main {{drawbacks}} of sequential pattern mining {{have been}} {{its lack of}} focus on user expectations and {{the high number of}} discovered patterns. However, the solution commonly accepted – the use of constraints – approximates the mining process to a verification of what are the frequent patterns among the specified ones, instead of the discovery of unknown and unexpected patterns. In this paper, we propose a new methodology to mine sequential patterns, keeping the focus on user expectations, without compromising the discovery of unknown patterns. Our methodology is based on the use <b>of</b> constraint <b>relaxations,</b> and it consists on using them to filter accepted patterns during the mining process. We propose a hierarchy <b>of</b> <b>relaxations,</b> applied to constraints expressed as context-free languages, classifying the existing relaxations (legal, valid and naïve, previously proposed), and proposing several new <b>classes</b> <b>of</b> <b>relaxations.</b> The new <b>classes</b> range from the approx and non-accepted, to the composition of different types <b>of</b> <b>relaxations,</b> like the approx-legal or the nonprefix-valid relaxations.

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{presents}} a new MRF optimization algorithm, which {{is derived from}} Linear Programming and manages to go beyond current state-of-the-art techniques (such as those based on graph-cuts or belief propagation). It does so by relying on a much tighter <b>class</b> <b>of</b> LP-relaxations, called cycle-relaxations. With the help <b>of</b> this <b>class</b> <b>of</b> <b>relaxations,</b> our algorithm tries {{to deal with a}} difficulty lying at the heart of MRF optimization: the existence of inconsistent cycles. To this end, it uses an operation called cycle-repairing. The goal of that operation is to fix any inconsistent cycles that may appear during optimization, instead of simply ignoring them as usually done up to now. The more the repaired cycles, the tighter the underlying LP relaxation becomes. As a result of this procedure, our algorithm is capable of providing almost optimal solutions even for very general MRFs with arbitrary potentials. Experimental results verify its effectiveness on difficult MRF problems, as well as its better performance compared to the state of the art...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. “Privacy ” and “utility ” {{are words}} that {{frequently}} {{appear in the}} literature on statistical privacy. But what do these words really mean? In recent years, many problems with intuitive notions of privacy and utility have been uncovered. Thus more formal notions of privacy and utility, which are amenable to mathematical analysis, are needed. In this paper we present our initial work on an axiomatization of privacy and utility. We present two privacy axioms which describe how privacy is affected by both post-processing data and by randomly selecting a privacy mechanism. We present three axioms for utility measures which also describe how measured utility is affected by post-processing. Our analysis of these axioms yields new insights into the construction of privacy definitions and utility measures. In particular, we characterize the <b>class</b> <b>of</b> <b>relaxations</b> <b>of</b> differential privacy that can be obtained by changing constraints on probabilities; we show that the resulting constraints must be formed from concave functions. We also present several <b>classes</b> <b>of</b> utility metrics satisfying our axioms and explicitly show that measures of utility borrowed from statistics can lead to utility paradoxes when applied to statistical privacy. Finally, we show that the outputs of differentially private algorithms are best interpreted in terms of graphs or likelihood functions rather than query answers or synthetic data. ...|$|R

40|$|Privacy is an {{increasingly}} important aspect of data publishing. Reasoning about privacy, however, is fraught with pitfalls. One {{of the most significant}} is the auxiliary information (also called external knowledge, background knowledge, or side information) that an adversary gleans from other channels such as the web, public records, or domain knowledge. This paper explores how one can reason about privacy in the face of rich, realistic sources of auxiliary information. Specifically, we investigate the effectiveness of current anonymization schemes in preserving privacy when multiple organizations independently release anonymized data about overlapping populations. 1. We investigate composition attacks, in which an adversary uses independent anonymized releases to breach privacy. We explain why recently proposed models of limited auxiliary information fail to capture composition attacks. Our experiments demonstrate that even a simple instance of a composition attack can breach privacy in practice, for a large <b>class</b> <b>of</b> currently proposed techniques. The class includes k-anonymity and several recent variants. 2. On a more positive note, certain randomization-based notions of privacy (such as differential privacy) provably resist composition attacks and, in fact, the use of arbitrary side information. This resistance enables “stand-alone ” design of anonymization schemes, without the need for explicitly keeping track of other releases. We provide a precise formulation of this property, and prove that an important <b>class</b> <b>of</b> <b>relaxations</b> <b>of</b> differential privacy also satisfy the property. This significantly enlarges the <b>class</b> <b>of</b> protocols known to enable modular design. 1...|$|R
