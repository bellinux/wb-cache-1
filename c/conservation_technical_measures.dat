40|$|Despite {{its efforts}} and {{obligations}} under the Kyoto Protocol, the EU has not succeeded in even making {{a dent in the}} rapidly rising trend of worldwide carbon dioxide emissions. If anything, the trend has accelerated in recent years. In his Th Lecture given to the German Economic Association in October 2007, the author criticizes the attempt to slow down global warming by means of unilaterally curtailing the demand for fossil fuels and develops an intertemporal supply side approach to the economics of global warming. He advances the hypothesis that the ineffectiveness of demand policies results from anticipation effects {{on the part of the}} owners of fossil fuel resources. In addition to the threat of potential ousting by domestic rivals, the threat of falling energy prices (against a modified Hotelling trend) due to greening public policies and increasing participation in world wide emissions trading systems gives resource ownersthe incentive to speedup extraction. Feasible policy measures that do not encounter such problematic anticipation effects include the rapid creation of a complete worldwide monopsony for fossil fuels that can dictate quantities rather than having to rely on price signals. Moreover, source taxes on the financial returns of resource owners will provideadditional <b>conservation</b> motives; <b>technical</b> <b>measures</b> including afforestation andsequestration may also be a way to reduce the speed of global warming...|$|R
40|$|The {{principal}} {{inshore fishery}} {{in the southwest}} Irish Sea is currently for whelk Buccinum undatum, which expanded in the 1990 s and yielded almost 10, 000 Â t in 2003. The fleet exploiting it consisted largely of old boats many of which previously {{used a variety of}} gears but which cannot any longer compete with more modern towing craft. Whelk is the only target species for the majority. The fishery is in open access and is not regulated and the paper examines the consequences of this for the fishers, particularly the problems associated with maintaining a way of life traditionally associated with remuneration by share rather than wage. Lack of regulation, it is argued, encourages a short term, opportunistic harvesting regime, which is not conducive to maintain a biologically sustainable fishery.

40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} the Cod Recovery Plan that was {{implemented}} in the Irish Sea in 2004. The plan was constructed within the Common Fisheries Policy, and applied to several European cod stocks that was fished unsustainably. It involved a system of measures including drastic reduction in TACs, closed spawning area, <b>technical</b> <b>conservation</b> <b>measures</b> and effort restriction {{in the form of}} “Days at Sea. ” This was not new to the fisheries in this area since the three former measures had been applied from 2000 as ICES gave warnings about the poor state of this particular stock. The implementation process has been characterised by conflicts, horse-trading and lack of evaluation. For many in the industry the measures have been draconian, others will claim they should have been tougher. Many differing but entangled factors and interests are involved and together {{with a high degree of}} complexity and unclear objectives the lack of legitimacy may be undermining the plan. This work sets out to evaluate the implementation process of the Cod Recovery Pla...|$|R

40|$|In {{spite of}} {{increasing}} evidence of complex population structure and varying rates ofexchange of commercially exploited marine ﬁsh stocks between different management areas,the stock assessment methods currently used by ICES to advise on {{total allowable catches}} (TACs) and <b>technical</b> <b>conservation</b> <b>measures</b> still take only limited account of seasonal mi-grations and movements. As an example, plaice, Pleuronectes platessa L., is currently man-aged as a single stock in the North Sea. However a combined experimental approach usingconventional tagging data, {{and the release of}} hundreds of plaice tagged with electronic datastorage tags, have allowed the identiﬁcation of population substructure and the characterisa-tion of annual migration routes and spawning areas. More recently, otolith microchemistryhas been used to determine the contribution of larvae from different spawning areas to dif-ferent nursery grounds, and the input from the nursery grounds to the adult population sub-units. Here a biologically-based population movement simulation model is presented whichutilizes data from each of these sources. The effects of a range of area and seasonal closureswere tested in terms of reduction in overall ﬁshing mortality. Results from this study illus-trate the value of high-quality biological data to improve current advice on biologically andtechnically interacting ﬁsh stocks and ﬁsheries...|$|R

40|$|Watershed can be {{regarded}} as a hydrological system that has a function in transforming rainwater as an input into outputs such as flow and sediment. The transformation of inputs into outputs has specific forms and properties. The transformation involves many processes, including processes occurred {{on the surface of the}} land, river basins, in soil and aquifer. This study aimed to apply the SWAT model in Ciliwung Hulu Watershed, asses the effect of average rainfall on 3 days, 5 days, 7 days and 10 days of the hydrological characteristics in Ciliwung Hulu Watershed. The correlation coefficient (r) between rainfall and discharge was positive, it indicated that there was an unidirectional relationship between rainfall and discharge in the upstream, midstream and downstream of the watershed. The upper limit ratio of discharge had a downward trend from upstream to downstream, while the lower limit ratio of discharge had an upward trend from upstream to downstream. It showed that the discharge peak in Ciliwung Hulu Watershed from upstream to downstream had a downward trend while the baseflow from upstream to downstream had an upward trend. It showed that the upstream of Ciliwung Hulu Watershed had the highest ratio of discharge peak and baseflow so it needs the soil and water <b>conservations</b> and <b>technical</b> civil <b>measures.</b> The discussion concluded that the SWAT model could be well applied in Ciliwung Hulu Watershed, the most affecting average rainfall on the hydrological characteristics was the average rainfall of 10 days.

40|$|It has {{analyzed}} different <b>technical</b> <b>measures</b> {{that could}} be adopted in the NAFO 3 M cod case to reduce the catches of cod below the Minimum Landing Size (MLS) and increase the Maximum Sustainable Yield (MSY). There {{is not so much}} information about <b>technical</b> <b>measures</b> in the NAFO cod fisheries. This analysis was mainly based on the Norwegian cod fisheries information. The adoption of the some studied <b>technical</b> <b>measures</b> seems to have a biological support because they would allow catching bigger fish minimizing the immature cod catches (length below the MLS) and the redfish by-catches in the NAFO 3 M cod fishery. It was also studied the impact on Fmsy of some of these <b>technical</b> <b>measures.</b> These <b>technical</b> <b>measures</b> would increase slightly the current MSY but with a large increase in the fishing effort. The increase in the equilibrium yield with the selectivity change seems not to be very efficient. In NAFO, it should be studied the possibility of implementing <b>technical</b> <b>measures</b> to prevent the large catches of small immature individuals observed in 2013. These devices would prevent catches of individuals with length below MLS to avoid discards and will improve the exploitation pattern.

We find that <b>technical</b> <b>measures</b> in agriculture often jointly enhance import demand and hinder export supply with {{the net effect of}} promoting the propensity to trade.
