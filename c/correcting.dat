40|$|A {{systematic}} {{sequence of}} prompt and probe trials {{was used to}} teach picture names to three severely retarded children. On prompt trials the experimenter presented a picture and said the picture name {{for the child to}} imitate; on probe trials the experimenter did not name the picture. A procedure whereby <b>correct</b> responses to prompts and probes were nondifferentially reinforced was compared with procedures whereby <b>correct</b> responses to prompts and probes were differentially reinforced according to separate and independent schedules of primary reinforcement. In Phase 1, <b>correct</b> responses to prompts and probes were reinforced nondifferentially on a fixed ratio (FR) 6 or 8 schedule; in Phase 2, <b>correct</b> responses to prompts were reinforced on the FR schedule and <b>correct</b> responses to probes were reinforced on an FR schedule of the same value; in Phase 3, <b>correct</b> responses to prompts were reinforced on the FR schedule and <b>correct</b> responses to probes were reinforced on a continuous reinforcement (CRF; every <b>correct</b> response reinforced) schedule; in Phase 4, <b>correct</b> responses to prompts were reinforced on a CRF schedule and <b>correct</b> responses to probes were reinforced on the FR schedule; in Phase 5, a reversal to the conditions of Phase 3 was conducted. For all three children, the FR schedule for <b>correct</b> responses to prompts combined with the CRF schedule for <b>correct</b> responses to probes (Phases 3 and 5) generated the highest number of <b>correct</b> responses to probes, the highest accuracy (<b>correct</b> responses relative to <b>correct</b> responses plus errors) on probe trials, and the highest rate of learning to name pictures...|$|R

At the same time he was privately speculating intensively about transmutation of species, and taking on other projects. He finished writing out his journal around the end of September, but then had the work of <b>correcting</b> proofs.|$|E

Also, we use the obtained results to get the error estimates for the <b>corrected</b> Euler Simpson formula, the <b>corrected</b> dual Euler Simpson formula and the <b>corrected</b> Euler Maclaurin formula.

5|$|The {{subsequent}} investigation {{concluded that}} the crash was attributable primarily to three factors: Holland's personality and behavior, USAF leaders' delayed or inadequate reactions to earlier incidents involving Holland, and {{the sequence of events}} during the aircraft's final flight. The crash is now used in military and civilian aviation environments as a case study in teaching crew resource management. It is also often used by the U.S. Armed Forces during aviation safety training {{as an example of the}} importance of compliance with safety regulations and <b>correcting</b> the behavior of anyone who violates safety procedures.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{accident}} investigation found that procedures and policies were supposedly {{already in place}} to prevent such a crash from occurring again, {{the fact that this}} crash occurred showed that in at least one instance, the existing safety policies and their enforcement had been grievously inadequate. To re-emphasize the importance of adherence to existing safety policies and <b>correcting</b> the actions of anyone violating them at any time, the USAF quickly distributed the findings of {{the accident}} investigation throughout the service. These measures failed to prevent – sixteen years later – the occurrence in almost identical circumstances of another accident, when a C-17 transport aircraft crashed shortly after taking off from Elmendorf Air Force Base, Alaska, on an aerial-display practice flight.|$|E
5|$|As a leader, Patton {{was known}} to be highly critical, <b>correcting</b> {{subordinates}} mercilessly for the slightest infractions, but also being quick to praise their accomplishments. Although he garnered a reputation as a general who was both impatient and impulsive and had little tolerance for officers who had failed to succeed, he fired only one general during World War II, Orlando Ward, and only after two warnings, whereas Bradley sacked several generals during the war. Patton reportedly had the utmost respect for the men serving in his command, particularly the wounded. Many of his directives showed special trouble to care for the enlisted men under his command, and he was well known for arranging extra supplies for battlefield soldiers, including blankets and extra socks, galoshes, and other items normally in short supply at the front.|$|E

In our study, the performance and number of <b>correct</b> answers was found to be negatively correlated for legitimate users. In other words, questions with more <b>correct</b> answers were answered less correctly by legitimate users. Interestingly, while increasing the “number of <b>correct</b> answers” negatively affects accuracy score of legitimate users, there is no significant effect on accuracy score of adversaries.|$|R

5|$|Augmentation {{involves}} the supplemental release of natural enemies {{that occur in}} a particular area, boosting the naturally occurring populations there. In inoculative release, small numbers of the control agents are released at intervals {{to allow them to}} reproduce, in the hope of setting up longer-term control, and thus keeping the pest down to a low level, constituting prevention rather than cure. In inundative release, in contrast, large numbers are released in the hope of rapidly reducing a damaging pest population, <b>correcting</b> a problem that has already arisen. Augmentation can be effective, but is not guaranteed to work, and depends on the precise details of the interactions between each pest and control agent.|$|E
5|$|Charles was {{the only}} son of King Charles X Gustav of Sweden and Hedwig Eleonora of Holstein-Gottorp. His father {{died when he was}} five years old, so Charles was educated by his {{governors}} until his coronation at the age of seventeen. Soon after, he was forced out on military expeditions to secure the recently acquired dominions from Danish troops in the Scanian War. Having successfully fought off the Danes, he returned to Stockholm and engaged in <b>correcting</b> the country's neglected political, financial and economic situation, managing to sustain peace during the remaining 20 years of his reign. Changes in finance, commerce, national maritime and land armaments, judicial procedure, church government and education emerged during this period. Charles XI was succeeded by his only son Charles XII, who made use of the well-trained army in battles throughout Europe.|$|E

A hurricane sweeps through the town, ultimately destroying the house but allowing the children to flee before the structure falls apart.

5|$|Priestley also {{defended the}} rights of Dissenters against the attacks of William Blackstone, an eminent legal theorist, whose Commentaries on the Laws of England (1765–69) had become the {{standard}} legal guide.

Furious, Priestley lashed out with his Remarks on Dr. Blackstone's Commentaries (1769), <b>correcting</b> Blackstone's interpretation of the law, his grammar (a highly politicised subject at the time), and history. Blackstone, chastened, altered subsequent editions of his Commentaries: he rephrased the offending passages and removed the sections claiming that Dissenters could not be loyal subjects, but he retained his description of Dissent as a crime.|$|E

One such case involved the request by knights to receive graces and be nominated to the title of Gran Croce di Grazia (literally: great cross by grace). This title implied that a graced knight could replace a knight of the Great Cross upon the latter's death. This procedure was not well reputed among elder knights who spent their lifetime {{at the service of}} the Order, and resulted in many of them retiring to return to their homelands and leave their inheritances to their respective families, against the rules of the Order.

5|$|The {{equilibrium}} {{that results}} from the relationship between forward and spot exchange rates {{within the context of}} covered interest rate parity is responsible for eliminating or <b>correcting</b> for market inefficiencies that would create potential for arbitrage profits. As such, arbitrage opportunities are fleeting. In order for this equilibrium to hold under differences in interest rates between two countries, the forward exchange rate must generally differ from the spot exchange rate, such that a no-arbitrage condition is sustained. Therefore, the forward rate is said to contain a premium or discount, reflecting the interest rate differential between two countries. The following equations demonstrate how the forward premium or discount is calculated.|$|E
