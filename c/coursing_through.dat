The canyon's main aquifers were too deep to be of use to ancient Chacoans: only several smaller and shallower sources supported the small springs that sustained them. Today, aside from occasional storm runoff <b>coursing</b> <b>through</b> arroyos, substantial surface water—springs, pools, wells—is virtually nonexistent.|$|E

Rolling Stone described this imagery as [...] "evil little men dwell in a dark dungeon with meat <b>coursing</b> <b>through</b> pipes in the wall" [...] and called it a [...] "groundbreaking", [...] "epic" [...] clip. Billboard voted it [...] "Best Video by a New Artist".|$|E
500|$|Seacole {{was proud}} of both her Jamaican and Scottish ancestry and called herself a Creole, a term that was {{commonly}} used in a racially neutral sense or {{to refer to the}} children of white settlers with indigenous women. In her autobiography, The Wonderful Adventures of Mrs. Seacole, she records her bloodline thus: [...] "I am a Creole, and have good Scots blood <b>coursing</b> <b>through</b> my veins. My father was a soldier of an old Scottish family." [...] Legally, she was classified as a mulatto, a multiracial person with limited political rights; Robinson speculates that she may technically have been a quadroon. Seacole emphasises her personal vigour in her autobiography, distancing herself from the contemporary stereotype of the [...] "lazy Creole", She {{was proud of}} her black ancestry, writing, [...] "I have a few shades of deeper brown upon my skin which shows me related – and I am proud of the relationship – to those poor mortals whom you once held enslaved, and whose bodies America still owns." ...|$|E

500|$|The musical {{retained}} Lee's [...] "central theme – a theme <b>coursing</b> <b>through</b> much 20th-century American literature: {{the conflict}} between Old World immigrants and their New World offspring". [...] Hammerstein and Fields shifted {{the focus of the}} story, however, from the elder Wang, who is central to Lee's novel, to his son Ta. [...] They also removed the darker elements of Lee's work, including Helen Chao's suicide after her desperate fling with Ta, added the festive nightclub subplot and emphasized the romantic elements of the story. [...] According to David Lewis in his book about the musical, [...] "Mr. Hammerstein and his colleagues were evidently in no mood to write a musical drama or even to invest their comedic approach with dramatic counterpoint of the sort that Jud Fry had given Oklahoma!... took the safest commercial route by following the eldest son's search for love – the most popular theme at the time with Broadway audiences." [...] Lewis notes that Chao's role, though diminished in the musical, nevertheless gives it some of its darkest moments, and she serves much the same purpose as Jud Fry: [...] to be, in Hammerstein's words, [...] "the bass fiddle that gives body to the orchestration of the story". [...] Though the new story was less artistically adventurous than the earlier Rodgers and Hammerstein hits, it was innovative, even daring in its treatment of Asian-Americans, [...] "an ethnic group that had long been harshly caricatured and marginalized in our mainstream pop culture." ...|$|E
500|$|Texas Monthly editor, Joe Nick Patoski {{believed}} [...] "Techno Cumbia" [...] {{contained the}} [...] "most popular rhythm [...] <b>coursing</b> <b>through</b> the Latin music world". Patoski further {{wrote that the}} track [...] "honored" [...] it by [...] "updating it with vocal samples, second line drumming from New Orleans, and horn charts inspired by soca from the Caribbean." [...] This was echoed by word for word from author Deborah Paredez on her book on Selena's fandom. Patoski further wrote that the remix version [...] "may have been laced with such exotica as a reggae toastmaster talking over a teeth-rattling bass line", and called it a [...] "electronic mishmash", and a [...] "pan-Caribbean attack that included soca and Hi Life from the Trinidad". Written in the key of G minor, the beat is set in common time and moves at a moderate 91 beats per minute. The remix version on Dreaming of You has a key signature set in C minor and moves at a moderate 90 bpms. The remix employs a piano, güira, tambourine, French horn and drums. Lyrically, Selena calls on people to dance her new style the [...] "techno cumbia" [...] dance and [...] "humorously" [...] calls out people who can't dance cumbia. Italian essayists Gaetano Prampolini and Annamaria Pinazzi described the lyrics of [...] "Techno Cumbia" [...] that [...] "summons everyone to the dance floor". Patoski found it to resemble the [...] "nonsensical novelty" [...] song by Shirley Ellis' 1964 single [...] "The Name Game".|$|E
500|$|Joe Nick Patoski, {{an author}} and {{contributor}} to The New York Times, felt that [...] "Fotos y Recuerdos" [...] used the same melody as the Pretenders' new wave sound. He also noticed that Pérez's guitar-lead emulated {{the style of the}} Pretenders James Honeyman-Scott. John LaFollette of The Monitor called [...] "Fotos y Recuerdos" [...] a celebration of multiculturalism which helped [...] " [...] her bank account" [...] using a [...] "marketing strategy" [...] that he called [...] "as American as apple pie." [...] The rock and house music track features a synth-driven violin, ostinatish-percussion, and a steel drum under a cumbia beat. Perone found the song to have [...] "small hints" [...] of music found in Jamaica, Cuba, and Trinidad and Tobago. Patoski believed [...] "Techno Cumbia" [...] contained the [...] "most popular rhythm [...] <b>coursing</b> <b>through</b> the Latin music world." [...] Patoski noted that the track [...] "honored" [...] it by [...] "updating it with vocal samples, second line drumming from New Orleans, and horn charts inspired by soca from the Caribbean." [...] It included the singer rapping under a cumbia beat, the [...] "first successful example" [...] of a cumbia rap prototype. [...] "Bidi Bidi Bom Bom", which also draws on music from the Caribbean, uses [...] "richer" [...] scoring, less-driven synthesizers, and treble-heavy arrangements than the first four songs on Amor Prohibido. Infused with cumbia and reggae, its [...] title suggests the sound of a heart palpitating when a person longs to be the protagonist's object of affection. [...] "Bidi Bidi Bom Bom" [...] is musically similar to [...] "El Chico del Apartamento 512"; Perone called them recurring themes where the protagonist is [...] "attracted to a young man". The song's hook is more accessible to listeners with limited Spanish than that of [...] "Bidi Bidi Bom Bom". The [...] "sunny teen anthem" [...] track [...] "El Chico del Apartamento 512", the protagonist is hit on by several men whom she has no interest in, except for the song's [...] "boy in apartment 512". She finds enough courage to knock on his door to find it answered by a woman who asks if she is searching for her brother. Perone found its lyrics to be [...] "lighthearted" [...] and a relief from the tracks featuring heartbreak and despair.|$|E
