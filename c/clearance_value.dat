In addition, effects of external load, radius clearance values, and material parameter on the mechanics performance were investigated. The {{results show that the}} value of external load has a direct pronounced effect on the contact characteristics of journal bearing. There is a significant positive correlation between contact pressure and external load, radius <b>clearance</b> <b>value,</b> and the Young's modulus of material. However, there is an evident negative correlation between contact radius of journal bearing and radius <b>clearance</b> <b>value,</b> and the Young's modulus of material. The smaller radius <b>clearance</b> <b>value</b> of journal bearing is, the more centralized contact region will be, so the corresponding contact pressure will be higher. From the perspective of reducing friction and wear, we need select the materials which have high strength and good toughness. Not only might this can improve the wear resistance, it also effectively decreases the contact pressure. In this case, we can prolong the service life of roller cone drill bits journal bearing...|$|E

40|$|Twenty-seven {{patients}} with advanced stage refractory ovarian cancer were studied {{to determine if}} chronic stable cisplatin-related renal dysfunction was present. Medical histories were examined to determine the types of therapy previously received {{as well as the}} total previous platinum doses received that ranged from 200 to 2, 100 mg/m 2. Standard assessments of renal function were made prior to administering current chemotherapy or immunotherapy to the patient, which included 24 -hour creatinine clearance, serum creatinine, and blood urea nitrogen (BUN). For {{patients with}} a 24 -hour creatinine clearance of less than 60 mL/minute, serum creatinine was highly variable (range: 0. 9 to 2. 0 mg/dL) and was not related to the degree of diminution in the 24 -hour creatinine <b>clearance</b> <b>value.</b> Conversely, for patients with a serum creatinine of less than 1. 5, the 24 -hour creatinine clearance values varied by almost three-fold, ranging between 46 and 120 mL/minute. Two patients with serum creatinines of less than 1 had creatinine clearances of less than 50 mL per minute. Similarly, BUN measurements did not correlate with 24 -hour creatinine clearance values, and the 24 -hour creatinine <b>clearance</b> <b>value</b> was not related to the total cumulative platinum dose. We conclude that patients who receive substantive doses of cisplatin may experience chronic stable cisplatin-related renal dysfunction and that serum creatinine cannot be relied on to assess the degree of renal compromise. In such patients, we recommended that the 24 -hour creatinine <b>clearance</b> <b>value</b> should be used when medical management is influenced by renal function...|$|E
40|$|An {{alternative}} approach is introduced {{in determining the}} in vitro intrinsic clearance of slowly metabolized compounds. The long-term sandwich rat hepatocyte culture was exploited, allowing for sufficient substrate depletion to obtain a reliable clearance estimation; in its physiology, it resembles the in vivo liver, thus allowing in vivo extrapolation of the in vitro <b>clearance</b> <b>value.</b> Substrate depletion of tolbutamide {{and the formation of}} its metabolites hydroxytolbutamide and carboxytolbutamide were measured in the medium and sandwich layer. Depletion data from the medium were fitted to a mathematical model incorporating system-dependent parameters (diffusion, protein binding, and partitioning) to calculate the hepatocytes' intrinsic clearance. Based on the decrease of the parent compound in the medium, a specific intrinsic <b>clearance</b> <b>value,</b> i. e., clearance per unit of volume of hepatocytes, of 0. 085 min - 1 was fitted. This value was in accordance with in vivo and in vitro values from the literature. The model was verified with substrate depletion data from the sandwich layer. Data on metabolite formation showed an incomplete mass balance. A radiochemical experiment revealed the presence of three additional metabolites. These metabolites were analyzed by liquid chromatography-mass spectometry. One was identified as p-tolysulfonylurea. The structure of the other two needs to be elucidated. After the addition of these compounds to the metabolic pattern, the mass balance was completed. The in vitro <b>clearance</b> <b>value</b> was incorporated in a physiologically based pharmacokinetic literature model of tolbutamide that accurately describes the plasma concentration. The approach used in this study successfully predicts the intrinsic clearance of tolbutamide. In addition, the sandwich rat hepatocyte culture also proves to be useful in the identification of metabolic pathways...|$|E

The clearance was calculated by means of either the simplified second exponential method or the 120 -min single blood sample; Chantler's correction was used in order to correct for having neglected the first exponential. There was a progressive increase in clearance from the first weeks of life (mean value around 1 month: 55 ml/min/ 1. 73 m 2), with a plateau at around 18 months. Between 2 and 17 years of age, the <b>clearance</b> <b>values</b> remained constant, with a mean value of 114 ml/min/ 1. 73 m 2 (SD: 24 ml/min); this is similar to the level described for inulin clearance.

Phenobarbital significantly increased total hepatic blood flow from 179 ± 15 to 239 ± 27 ml/min. Liver weight was increased to a similar degree (34 %) in phenobarbital-treated animals as compared to control monkeys. The clearance of both antipyrine and d-propranolol was increased and the half-life decreased significantly by phenobarbital. Analysis of the data by a perfusion-limited pharmacokinetic model showed that the changes in antipyrine clearance were due almost entirely to enzyme induction. On the other hand, with d-propranolol, the increase in liver blood flow contributed {{as much to the}} enhanced clearance as did the stimulation of drug metabolism. The mechanism by which phenobarbital produces the frequently observed increase in drug clearance, therefore, depends upon the initial <b>clearance</b> <b>value</b> of the drug.

TPMT is genetically {{polymorphic}} and {{is associated}} with large interindividual variations in thiopurine drug toxicity and therapeutic efficacy. During routine genotyping of patients with Crohn's disease, one novel missense mutation, 365 A>C (TPMT* 19, Lys(122) Thr), and a recently described missense mutation, 488 G>A (TPMT* 16, Arg(163) His), were identified in a Caucasian and a Moroccan patient, respectively. Using a heterologous yeast expression system, kinetic parameters (K(m) and V(max)) of the two variants with respect to 6 -thioguanine S-methylation were determined and compared with those obtained with the wild-type enzyme. The Lys(122) Thr exchange did not significantly decrease the intrinsic <b>clearance</b> <b>value</b> (V(max) /K(m)) of the variant enzyme. In contrast, the Arg(163) His substitution significantly decreased the intrinsic <b>clearance</b> <b>value</b> by three-fold. The Arg(163) {{is located in a}} highly conserved region of the human TPMT protein and, as such, the Arg(163) His substitution is expected to result in a marked reduction of enzyme activity, as confirmed by the in vitro data. Phenotyping by measurement of red blood cell TPMT activity indicated that the patient heterozygous for the Lys(122) Thr mutation had normal TPMT activity, whereas the patient heterozygous for the Arg(163) His mutation was an intermediate methylator, which demonstrated a positive correlation between TPMT phenotyping and the in vitro data. The identification of a novel non-functional allele of the TPMT gene improves our knowledge of the genetic basis of interindividual variability in TPMT activity. These data further enhance the efficiency of genotyping methods to predict patients at risk of an inadequate response to thiopurine therapy...|$|E

This manuscript presents our earlier research during the I-Match project where a haptic peg-in-hole test was used in order to compare between healthy volunteers' performance and those with neurological impairment. Subjects all performed a series of haptic virtual peg-in-hole tasks with varying degrees of difficulty determined by the hole diameter. Haptic instrument, Phantom Desktop 1. 5, allowed for recording of biomechanical data which is used to present some variant features between the two subject groups. This paper analyses the placement time, maximum peg transfer velocity, collision forces recorded during peg placement and also insertion accuracy. The first three parameters showed statistically {{significant differences between the two}} groups while the last, insertion accuracy, showed insignificant differences (p = 0. 152).

By dividing the injected activity by the distributional volume, the initial plasma concentrations (A 0, 30 %, A 0, 25 % and A 0, 20 %) were calculated. Using these A 0 values and the available single sample, ASI clearances were calculated by using the classical slope-intercept method. The working hypothesis of this approach was as follows. In the absence of significant errors, the three ASI <b>clearance</b> <b>values</b> should be close to that of the SBS method. This hypothesis has been tested using both simulated and patients' data. RESULTS: The results of the simulated study showed that an error in the injected dose produced variable differences between SBS and ASI clearances depending on the <b>clearance</b> <b>values.</b> The effect of an error on the plasma sample also varied as a function of the <b>clearance</b> <b>values.</b> The analysis of patient data revealed that the ASI approach allowed the identification of patients in whom the classical slope-intercept method suggested the presence of a possible error. CONCLUSION: A post-test quality control procedure for the SBS GFR measurement is presented. When the SBS clearance shows a difference with the ASI method (> 10 ml·min per 1. 73 m), the presence of an error is highly probable. A smaller difference, however, does not exclude erroneous data. © 2006 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
