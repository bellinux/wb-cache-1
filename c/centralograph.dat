25|$|LM Ericsson {{bought the}} rights to the <b>Centralograph</b> from Gábor Kornél Tolnai and {{accordingly}} they acquired the patent rights from him. The procedure for granting patents, requirements placed on the patentee, and the extent of the exclusive rights vary widely between countries according to national laws and international agreements. A patent is a set of exclusive rights granted by a sovereign state to an inventor or their assignee for a limited period of time, in exchange for the public disclosure of the invention. An invention is a solution to a specific technological problem, and may be a product or a process. Patents are a form of intellectual property. Intellectual property (IP) is a legal concept for creations of the mind for which exclusive rights are recognized.|$|E
25|$|In 1931 L.M. Ericsson {{introduced}} the Bakelite phone, and acquired the patent rights to Tolnai's <b>Centralograph</b> machine-status-recorder. When Ericsson’s Bakelite telephone was first distributed world-wide in 1931 {{it was called}} the Swedish type of telephone and set the standard for how a modern plastic telephone should look. The distinctive Ericsson styles soon became subdued by the increasing use of moulded thermoplastic phones. Ericsson's innovative bakelite telephone, which was launched in 1931, was primarily known for its trend-setting (early adopter) design, but it also contained an important technical innovation called anti-side tone coupling. The line of telephones, the Ericsson DBH 1001 telephone, was the Bakelite phone, officially also called DBH 1001, m33, N1020 or DE 702, was a Swedish standard telephone bakelite produced in over thirty years between 1931 and 1962.|$|E

2500|$|The <b>Centralograph</b> {{was used}} for {{production}} monitoring and registration of {{the running of the}} spinning machines in workshop and offices. The <b>Centralograph</b> is a recording instrument equipped with a number of printing units which record data on a moving chart. The record appears in the form of dashes and numerical digits in a series of columns. The printing units have electromagnet coil which are actuated by external impulses. The chart and the ink ribbon are driven either by a synchronous motor or by an impulse motor. Synchronous motors are commonly used in analog electric clocks, timers and other devices where correct time is required.|$|E
