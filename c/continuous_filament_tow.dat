40|$|The {{filament}} winding {{process is a}} manufacturing technique in which a resin-impregnated <b>continuous</b> <b>filament</b> (or tape) <b>tow</b> is wound over a rotating mandrel. The synchronized movement of both the mandrel and the delivery head accomplishes the precise positioning of the fibres on the mandrel surface, leading to the desired geometric pattern. The ability to control the process variables may allow improvements in the process optimization {{and the quality of}} the wound parts. Over the last two decades, only a limited number of process models have been developed specifically for the {{filament winding}} process [1 - 4]. The majority of the approaches model the physical phenomena taking place at the layer/laminate level in a similar way. In particular, the consolidation pressure model due to initial fibre tension, the resin radial velocity model and the resin cure model are very similar. Thus, the main differences appear in the modelling strategy for the fibre motion, the fibre bed compaction, the thermo-chemical effects and the stress-strain constitutive relation. Moreover, the assembly of the various models, the iterative calculus sequence and th...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of the microwave filament processing project is to develop microwave techniques to manufacture <b>continuous</b> ceramic oxide <b>filaments.</b> Microwave processing uses the volumetric absorption of microwave power in oxide <b>filament</b> <b>tows</b> to drive off process solvents, to burn out organic binders, and to sinter the dried fibers to produce flexible, high-strength ceramic filaments. The technical goal is to advance filament processing technology by microwave heating more rapidly with less energy and {{at a lower cost}} than conventional processing, but with the same quality as conventional processing. The manufacturing goal is to collaborate with the 3 M Company, a US manufacturer of ceramic oxide filaments, to evaluate the technology using a prototype filament system and to transfer the microwave technology to the 3 M Company. <b>Continuous</b> ceramic <b>filaments</b> are a principal component in many advanced high temperature materials like continuous fiber ceramic composites (CFCC) and woven ceramic textiles. The use of <b>continuous</b> ceramic <b>filaments</b> in CFCC radiant burners, gas turbines, waste incineration, and hot gas filters in U.

40|$|The {{strength}} retention {{after exposure}} to elevated tem-perature in air of <b>continuous</b> <b>filament</b> and staple spun PPTA sewing thread and the precursor yarns was determined.
