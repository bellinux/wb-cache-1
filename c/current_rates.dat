Based on statistics, Romblon is the second biggest provincial marble producer of the country next to Bulacan. Romblon marble is of very high quality and comes in shades of white, green, pink, red and black. The Mines and Geosciences Bureau has estimated that Romblon is endowed with about 150 million metric tons of marble. At <b>current</b> <b>rates</b> of extraction, the supply may last for three more centuries. Tablas Island is also believed to have vast reserves of marble.|$|E
5|$|Logging, {{along with}} {{cultivation}} practices has devastated tree cover, causing severe environmental degradation in the country. Over 80percent of Sarawak's rainforest has been cleared. Floods in East Malaysia have been worsened {{by the loss}} of trees, and over 60percent of the Peninsular's forest have been cleared. With <b>current</b> <b>rates</b> of deforestation, the forests are predicted to be extinct by 2020. Deforestation is a major problem for animals, fungi and plants, as the forest is cut to make room for plantations. Most remaining forest is found inside national parks. Habitat destruction has proved a threat for marine life. Illegal fishing is another major threat, with fishing methods such as dynamite fishing and poisoning depleting marine ecosystems. Leatherback turtle numbers have dropped 98percent since the 1950s. Hunting has also been an issue for some animals, with overconsumption and the use of animal parts for profit endangering many animals, from marine life to tigers. Marine life is also detrimentally affected by uncontrolled tourism.|$|E

5|$|The <b>current</b> <b>rates</b> were {{introduced}} in 2007. Previously, base tuition was only ₱300 per unit (since 1989). Library and miscellaneous fees were also increased in 2007, from ₱400 (US$9) per student to ₱1,100 (US$25) and ₱2,000 (US$46), respectively. New fees, such as internet and energy fees, {{were introduced}}. The USC sees the over 300 percent increase in tuition {{as the reason for}} the low enrollment rate and high student loan levels, which totaled some ₱14 million (US$326,000) in 2007. Additionally, it criticizes the STFAP for allegedly being ineffective. Upon its introduction in 1989, only 16 percent of students received discounts. The number fell to 12 percent in 2007.|$|E
5|$|Humans play a {{key role}} in the biosphere, with the large human {{population}} dominating many of Earth's ecosystems. This has resulted in a widespread, ongoing mass extinction of other species during the present geological epoch, now known as the Holocene extinction. The large-scale loss of species caused by human influence since the 1950s has been called a biotic crisis, with an estimated 10% of the total species lost as of 2007. At <b>current</b> <b>rates,</b> about 30% of species are at risk of extinction in the next hundred years. The Holocene extinction event is the result of habitat destruction, the widespread distribution of invasive species, hunting, and climate change. In the present day, human activity has had a significant impact on the surface of the planet. More than a third of the land surface has been modified by human actions, and humans use about 20% of global primary production. The concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has increased by close to 30% since the start of the Industrial Revolution.|$|E

40|$|This paper, through {{simulating}} an {{open economy}} model of China, investigates whether the <b>current</b> <b>rate</b> of saving in China is excessive. The model incorporates the major {{factors that influence}} optimal saving, namely demographic change, the catch-up of total factor productivity in China {{to the level of}} high-income OECD countries, and an endogenous world rate of interest. The paper finds that the rate of time preference that would imply the <b>current</b> <b>rate</b> of saving is optimal is very low; in fact, it is negative. Thus, to justify China's <b>current</b> <b>rate</b> of saving, the social planner would have to put a higher weight on the economic welfare of future generations relative to the current generation, indeed up to 19 times the weight. This suggests that the <b>current</b> <b>rate</b> of saving in China is excessive. Saving, China, living standards...|$|R

25|$|The {{government}} {{introduced a}} series of structural reforms in recent years. The most promising reforms {{have been in the}} liberalization of the telecommunications sector.

Morocco also has liberalized rules for oil and gas exploration and has granted concessions for many public services in major cities. The tender process in Morocco is becoming increasingly transparent.

25|$|Since the 1992 {{launch of}} TOPEX/Poseidon, {{altimetric}} satellites have been recording {{the change in}} sea level. <b>Current</b> <b>rates</b> of sea level rise from satellite altimetry have been estimated {{in the range of}} 2.9–3.4 ± 0.4–0.6mm per year for 1993–2010. This exceeds those from tide gauges. It is unclear whether this represents an accelerated increase over the last decades, variability due to the sparse sampling of the tide gauges, true differences between satellites and tide gauges, or problems with satellite calibration. In 2015, a small calibration errors of the first altimetric satellite – Topex/Poseidon - was identified. It had caused a slight overestimation of the 1992-2005 sea levels, which masked the ongoing sea level rise acceleration.|$|E

25|$|The oil sales losses Iran is {{experiencing}} {{are likely to}} produce over $50 billion in hard currency revenue losses in a one-year period at current oil prices. The IMF estimated Iran’s hard currency reserves to be $106 billion as {{of the end of}} 2011, and some economists say that figure may have fallen to about $80 billion as of November 2012. Analysts at one outside group, the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies, believe Iran’s hard currency reserves might be exhausted entirely by July 2014 at <b>current</b> <b>rates</b> of depletion. Compounding the loss of oil sales by volume is that many of its oil transactions reportedly are now conducted on a barter basis—or in exchange for gold, which is hard currency but harder to use than cash is. In addition, the 6 February 2013, imposition of sanctions on Iran’s ability to repatriate hard currency could cause the depletion rate to increase.|$|E
25|$|Fiscal {{efficiency}} is separate from economic efficiency. Economic analysis of recycling {{does not include}} what economists call externalities, which are unpriced costs and benefits that accrue to individuals outside of private transactions. Examples include: decreased air pollution and greenhouse gases from incineration, reduced hazardous waste leaching from landfills, reduced energy consumption, and reduced waste and resource consumption, {{which leads to a}} reduction in environmentally damaging mining and timber activity. About 4,000 minerals are known, of these only a few hundred minerals in the world are relatively common. Known reserves of phosphorus will be exhausted within the next 100 years at <b>current</b> <b>rates</b> of usage. Without mechanisms such as taxes or subsidies to internalize externalities, businesses may ignore them despite the costs imposed on society. To make such nonfiscal benefits economically relevant, advocates have pushed for legislative action to increase the demand for recycled materials. The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has concluded in favor of recycling, saying that recycling efforts reduced the country's carbon emissions by a net 49 million metric tonnes in 2005. In the United Kingdom, the Waste and Resources Action Programme stated that Great Britain's recycling efforts reduce CO2 emissions by 10–15 million tonnes a year. Recycling is more efficient in densely populated areas, as there are economies of scale involved.|$|E
