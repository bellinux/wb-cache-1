25|$|Microdispensing {{was used}} to create micropatterns on {{polystyrene}} <b>culture</b> <b>dishes</b> by dispensing droplets of adhesive laminin and non-adhesive bovine serum albumin (BSA) solutions. The microdispenser is a piezoelectric element attached to a push-bar {{on top of a}} channel etched in silicon, which has one inlet at each end and a nozzle in the middle. The piezoelectric element expands when voltage is applied, causing liquid to be dispensed through the nozzle. The microdispenser is moved using a computer-controlled x-y table. The micropattern resolution depends on many factors: dispensed liquid viscosity, drop pitch (the distance between the centre of two adjacent droplets in a line or array), and the substrate. With increasing viscosity the lines become thinner, but if the liquid viscosity is too high the liquid cannot be expelled. Heating the solution creates more uniform protein lines. Although some droplet overlap is necessary to create continuous lines, uneven evaporation may cause uneven protein concentration along the lines; this can be prevented through smoother evaporation by modifying the dispensed solution properties.|$|E

Girls should be careful about their personal things, like underwear, which should not be seen by their brothers, after washing clothes they should hang them to dry in a separate place. Females cannot slap her brother, comb his hair, scratch his back and touch his face.|$|E
50|$|To prepare MEFs, {{pregnant}} female mice are needed. After Sacrificing the mouse, researcher should incise the stomach of female mouse and then detach the embryo from the placenta in a biohazard hood. Then {{the liver and}} head should be taken out. Finally digest the remains by enzymes to obtain single isolated cells and culture the cells in a tissue <b>culture</b> <b>dishes.</b> MEF cells can be culuted in vitro in DMEM medium with 10% FBS. To transmit MEFs, researches should use trypsin to digest the cells (making them detach from the surface) and transmit 1/5 cells digested into a new dish.|$|E
50|$|Cells {{in vitro}} can be {{suspended}} in a fluid, made {{to adhere to}} a culture dish, or remain part {{of a piece of}} tissue that has been removed from the animal. These environments typically don't have to compensate for motion of the tissue due to the heartbeat or breathing of an animal. In the case of cells in suspension, the pipette is completely replaced with a microchip with holes that can create gigaseals and measure the electrical activity. Clogging is also less problematic for cells or tissue in <b>culture</b> <b>dishes</b> because the cells and pipette can be seen through a microscope which helps the technician avoid everything but the cell of interest.|$|E

50|$|Another {{technique}} automates {{the positioning}} of patch clamping cells in cultures. It uses a nanopipette on a precise, piezo-actuated stage to scan a surface within a <b>culture</b> <b>dish.</b> As it scans, it maintains a constant electrical capacitance between {{the tip of}} the pipette and the surface or cells beneath it by moving it up and down. (As it moves close to a cell, the capacitance increases, so the actuator moves the pipette away, and vice versa.) This give a precise topographical mapping of the surface within the <b>culture</b> <b>dish.</b> After the cells have been mapped, the computer moves the pipette over to a selected cell and lowers it to form a gigaseal with it.|$|R
50|$|Cells can {{be grown}} either in {{suspension}} or adherent cultures. Some cells naturally live in suspension, without being attached to a surface, such as cells {{that exist in the}} bloodstream. There are also cell lines that have been modified to be able to survive in suspension cultures so they {{can be grown}} to a higher density than adherent conditions would allow. Adherent cells require a surface, such as tissue culture plastic or microcarrier, which may be coated with extracellular matrix (such as collagen and laminin) components to increase adhesion properties and provide other signals needed for growth and differentiation. Most cells derived from solid tissues are adherent. Another type of adherent culture is organotypic culture, which involves growing cells in a three-dimensional (3-D) environment as opposed to two-dimensional <b>culture</b> <b>dishes.</b> This 3D culture system is biochemically and physiologically more similar to in vivo tissue, but is technically challenging to maintain because of many factors (e.g. diffusion).|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Although rare, {{microbial}} contamination of <b>culture</b> <b>dishes</b> occasionally occurs in our IVF/ICSI programme. Despite stringent culture {{conditions and the}} use of medium containing penicillin and streptomycin, an increasing number of infections was observed once they were routinely recorded. In this study, 95 cases of contami-nated <b>culture</b> <b>dishes</b> were examined, in an attempt to identify possible causes. METHODS: Relevant data of the IVF/ ICSI treatment cycles and the micro-organisms isolated from the infected <b>culture</b> <b>dishes</b> were evaluated retrospec-tively. RESULTS: Infections were observed only in IVF <b>culture</b> <b>dishes</b> and never after applying intra-cytoplasmic sperm injection. Identification of the contaminating micro-organisms showed that infections were mainly caused by Escherichia coli (n 5 56; 58. 9 %) and Candida species (n 5 24; 25. 3 %). Of the E. coli strains isolated, 41 (73. 2 %) appeared to be resistant to both antibiotics used in the culture medium and 13 (23. 2 %) appeared to resist either penicillin or streptomycin. Of all bacterial strains isolated, the resistances were 61. 4 % to both and 30 % to one of the antibiotics used. CONCLUSIONS: Applying the ICSI procedure prevents colonization of the <b>culture</b> <b>dishes</b> by micro-organisms. Infections in IVF <b>culture</b> <b>dishes</b> are mainly caused by bacterial strains insensitive to the antibiotics used or due to yeast colonization by Candida species which frequently reside in the vagina...|$|E
30|$|There {{are many}} types of 3 D stem cell culture systems, which can include plate or <b>culture</b> <b>dish,</b> spinner flask, {{rotating}} wall vessel (RWV), and perfusion bioreactor system among others. The plate or <b>culture</b> <b>dish</b> is {{the most widely used}} system because it is low-cost and easy to use. However, some major disadvantages of this system include low seeding efficiency, an inherent limit on growth inside of the dish and a vastly different environment when compared with an in vivo setting. When compared with the <b>culture</b> <b>dish</b> system, the spinner flask and rotating wall vessel offer improvements with respect to the quality and efficiency of cell culture, as they promote the convection of the culture medium by stirring. The RWV is composed of two horizontal concentric cylinders, and the gas inside the column can be freely exchanged through a semi-permeable membrane. The perfusion bioreactor system has become more popular in stem cell engineering projects. The perfusion bioreactor system maintains a balanced environment by constantly refreshing the culture solution thus reducing the likelihood of contamination. Despite the advances in stem cell 3 D culture systems, investigators continue to identify new methods to culture cells more efficiently.|$|R

30|$|The {{contact angle}} {{which is the}} angle on the contact {{interface}} between the liquid and solid is a popular index for expressing surface wettability of general materials such as metals, glasses, and resins [22].

Furthermore, {{in the case of}} cellular tissues, the wet condition of tissues must be maintained, because drying on the surface causes cell damage. To keep the wet condition, a captive-bubble based contact-angle measurement was developed [14], however, this measurement is difficult to apply to cell <b>culture</b> <b>dish</b> systems in vitro because the entire <b>culture</b> <b>dish</b> must be immersed into a liquid pool.|$|R

40|$|The {{extracellular}} matrix (ECM) of articular cartilage has several functions that {{are unique to}} joints. Although a technique for transplanting cultured chondrocytes has already been introduced, {{it is difficult to}} collect intact ECM when using enzymes to harvest samples. Temperature-responsive <b>culture</b> <b>dishes</b> have already been clinically applied in the fields of myocardial and corneal transplantation. Earlier studies have shown that a sheet of cultured cells with intact ECM and adhesive factors can be harvested using such <b>culture</b> <b>dishes,</b> which allow the surface properties of the dish to be reversibly altered by changing the temperature. Human chondrocytes were subjected to enzymatic digestion and then were seeded in temperature-responsive <b>culture</b> <b>dishes.</b> A sheet of chondrocytes was harvested by only reducing the temperature after the cultured cells reached confluency. A real-time PCR analysis of the chondrocyte sheets confirmed that type II collagen, aggrecan, and fibronectin were present. These results suggested that, although chondrocytes undergo dedifferentiation in a monolayer culture, multilayer chondrocyte sheets grown in a similar environment to that of three-dimensional culture may be able to maintain a normal phenotype. A histological examination suggested that multilayer chondrocyte sheets could thus prevent the loss of proteoglycans because the area covered by the sheets was well stained by safranin-O. The present experiments suggested that temperature-responsive <b>culture</b> <b>dishes</b> are useful for obtaining cultured chondrocytes, which may then be clinically employed as a substitute for periosteal patches because such sheets can be applied without a scaffold...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background We {{previously}} reported that periplakin (PPL) is downregulated in human esophageal cancer tissues {{compared to the}} adjacent non-cancer epithelium. Thus PPL could be a useful marker for detection of early esophageal cancer and evaluation of tumor progression, but largely remains unknown in this field. To investigate PPL involvement in carcinogenesis, tumor progression, cellular movement or attachment activity, siRNAs against PPL were transfected into pharyngeal squamous cancer cell lines and their effects on cellular behaviours were examined. Results PPL knockdown appeared to decrease tumor cell growth together with G 2 /M phase accumulation in cells attached to a <b>culture</b> <b>dish.</b> However, the extent of cell growth suppression, evaluated {{by the number of}} cells attached to the <b>culture</b> <b>dish,</b> was too distinctive to be explained only by cell cycle delay. Importantly, PPL knockdown suppressed cellular movement and attachment to the <b>culture</b> <b>dish</b> accompanied by decreased pAktSer 473 phosphorylation. Additionally, LY 294002, a PI 3 K inhibitor that dephosphorylates pAktSer 473, significantly suppressed D 562 cell migration. Thus PPL potentially engages in cellular movement al least partly via the PI 3 K/Akt axis. Conclusions PPL knockdown is related to reduced cellular movement and attachment activity in association with PI 3 K/Akt axis suppression, rather than malignant progression in pharyngeal cancer cells. </p...|$|R
40|$|The western {{highlands}} of Cameroon are {{an area where}} the population density and growth rates are the highest in the country. In this region, the main activity is agriculture, and rivers are the main source of safe drinking water. Lacks of arable land and especially against very complex land tenure, farmers are increasingly exploiting the hills (9 - 30 % slope) for the production of vegetable crops, mainly potatoes. The methods of preparation of soil found there are ridging {{in the direction of the}} slope and the <b>culture</b> <b>dish.</b> These practices promote erosion by runoff, generally compromises the multiple functions of agriculture, and in particular the environmental function (soil degradation, pollution and silting up of rivers) and the production function (incomes). In order to ensure soil stability and maintain good water quality of rivers, we put it up a new way of preparing the ground: the tied ridging. To quantify the effectiveness of the latter, we conducted tests of erosion by runoff with Wischmeierâs plots on the most exploited slopes, namely 11 % and 29 %. The run-off water and sediments were collected per plot and per block after every rain. The first analyses show that there is a significant difference between the <b>culture</b> <b>dish</b> or ridging along the slope and tied ridging. The major constraint of this practice lies in the increase of about 17 % of the labor.
