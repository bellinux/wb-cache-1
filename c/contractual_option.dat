40|$|In {{the wake}} of the sub-prime crisis of 2008, the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority issued the Solvency II directive, aiming at {{replacing}} the obsolete Solvency I framework by 2016. Among the quantitative requirements of Solvency II, a measure for an insurance firms solvency risk, the solvency risk capital, is found. It aims at establishing the amount of equity the company needs to hold to be able to meet its insurance obligations with a probability of 0. 995 over the coming year. The SCR of a company is essentially built up by the SCR induced by a set of quantifiable risks. Among these, risks originating from the take up rate of <b>contractual</b> <b>options,</b> lapse risks, are included. In this thesis, the <b>contractual</b> <b>options</b> of a life insurer have been identified and risk factors aiming at capturing the risks arising are suggested. It has been concluded that a risk factor estimating the size of mass transfer events captures the risk arising through the resulting rescaling of the balance sheet. Further, a risk factor modeling the deviation of the Company's assumption for the yearly transfer rate is introduced to capture the risks induced by the characteristics of traditional life insurance and unit-linked insurance contracts upon transfer. The risk factors are modeled in a manner to introduce co-dependence with equity returns as well as interest rates of various durations and the model parameters are estimated using statistical methods for Norwegian transfer-frequency data obtained from Finans Norge. The univariate and multivariate properties of the models are investigated in a scenario setting and it is concluded the the suggested models provide predominantly plausible results for the mass-lapse risk factors. However, the performance of the models for the risk factors aiming at capturing deviations in the transfer assumptions are questionable, why two means of increasing its validity have been proposed...|$|R

40|$|Consider {{companies}} {{who rely on}} revenue generating equipment that fails from time to time. Assume that a company owns one unit of equipment, whose maintenance and repair services are outsourced to a qualified service provider. We assume that the company (the principal) outsources the maintenance and repair services using performance based contracts. Such contractual relationships fall into economics' principal-agent framework. The owners of the revenue generating units {{are referred to as}} principals, and the service provider as the agent. We address the following questions: What are the optimal contracting strategies for a principal and an agent? Can the agent benefit from pooling the service demands from multiple principals? This dissertation contains two main bodies of work contained in chapters 2 - 7 and chapters 8 - 13 respectively. In {{the first part of this}} dissertation (chapters 2 - 7) we examine the <b>contractual</b> <b>options</b> between a single principal and a single agent. The <b>contractual</b> <b>options</b> of a principal and an agent are modeled as a Markov process with an undetermined time horizon. For a risk neutral principal we identify the conditions under which a principal contracts with a risk-neutral, risk-averse, or risk-seeking agent and derive the principal's optimal offer and the agent's service capacity response. In essence, we provide an extensive formulating analysis of principal-agent contracts given any exogenous parameter values. That is, we derive mathematical formulas for the optimal contract offers and the agent's optimal service capacity. It turns out that a small number of formulas cover a large spectrum of principal-agent conditions. In the second part of this dissertation (chapters 8 - 13), in a counter distinction to the vast literature in economics on principal-agent contractual interplay and its predominant concern with the principal, here we focus on the agent. In the case of performance based service contracts it is known that the principal extracts all the economic surplus and the agent breaks even. But this is not the case for an agent of good standing contracting with multiple principals. We show that an agent who contracts a collection of principals with interdependent failure characteristics does better than break-even - such an agent realizes a profit rate that is convexly increasing in the number of principals. The corresponding cooperative game assessing each principal's contribution to the agent's profit is convex and its easily computable Louderback's value seems always to be in its core. In chapter 14 we present the outline of a future study that compares several different options of contract structure faced by the principal and the agent, because the optimal contracting strategies for the principal and the agent may not necessarily be the same under different contract structures. We discuss briefly the agent's and the principal's behavior under different forms of performance based contract, which serves as a starting point for future extensions of this dissertation. To summarize, this dissertation provides practical mathematical results and important managerial insights into the principal-agent contract in equipment repair services industry...|$|R

40|$|Payments for Ecosystem Services (PES) {{have been}} {{promoted}} worldwide {{as a means}} to incentivise biodiversity, forest conservation and sustainable forest management. Mexico has {{been at the forefront of}} PES implementation since 2003, and the country has now more than 2. 6 million hectares under a variety of PES contracts. In this article, we perform a choice experiment with a group of 82 community forest owners who are receiving a payment for providing biodiversity-related ecosystem services in the state of Chiapas. Considering possible future evolutions in contract design, we explore individuals preferences over contract characteristics including who is involved in deciding the parcels to be included in the contract, the type of technical intermediary, the level of payment and the type of incentive (either in individual cash payments or in collective investments). Our results show a reluctance to decide collectively on issues related to forest conservation, as well as on dedicating a share of payments to collective projects. We find strong individual preferences for payments in cash, even when the amount of monetary compensation is lower than in the existing PES contract, and we show that most participants value positively the help received by external service providers in PES implementation. An analysis of preference heterogeneity suggests that community leaders play a key role in moderating individual preferences and enhancing participation structured around working groups. We thus argue that the willingness to accept a PES program is greatly dependent on local governance factors. As such, exploring ways for PES <b>contractual</b> <b>options</b> to match the diversity of local conditions and individual preferences – allowing a modular allocation of PES into cash or investment on an individual or collective basis- could further stimulate participation in Mexico's PES programme.

40|$|Reliability {{optimization}} can {{be applied}} in both conventional and non-conventional generating system planning. This thesis is concerned with generation adequacy optimization, with emphases on applications to wind energy penetration planning and interruptible load utilization. New models, indices and techniques for generation adequacy optimization including wind turbines and interruptible load utilization have been developed in this research work. A sequential Monte Carlo simulation technique for wind power modeling and reliability assessment of a generating system {{was developed in the}} research associated with optimum wind energy penetration planning. An auto-regressive and moving average (ARMA) time series model is used to simulate the hourly wind speeds. Two new risk-based capacity benefit indicators designated as the Load Carrying Capability Benefit Ratio (LCCBR) and the Equivalent Capacity Ratio (ECR) are introduced. These two indices are used to indicate capacity benefit and credit associated with a windenergy conversion system. A bisection technique to assess them was further developed. The problem of determining the optimum site-matching windturbine parameters was studied with the LCCBR and ECR as the optimization objective functions. Sensitivity studies were conducted to show the effect of wind energy penetration level on generation capacity benefit. A procedure for optimum penetration planning was formed, which extends the methods developed for conventional generation adequacy optimization. A basic framework and techniques to conduct interruptible load analysis using sequential Monte Carlo simulation were created in the research associated with interruptible load utilization. A new index designated as the Avoidable Additional Generating Capacity (AAGC) is introduced. Bisection search techniques were developed to effectively determine the Incremental Load Carrying Capability (ILCC) and AAGC. Case studies on suitable <b>contractual</b> <b>options</b> for interruptible load customers under given conditions are also presented in this thesis.

40|$|Virtually all the {{analysis}} of predatory lending in the home loan market {{has been based on}} a dual-market paradigm. Sub-prime borrowers, usually less-sophisticated, lower-income, and disproportionately minority, are preyed upon. Other borrowers are not preyed upon, or if they are, it doesn't matter. The dual-market paradigm has conditioned the remedies proposed for predatory lending. Since sub-prime borrowers can't take care of themselves in the marketplace, government needs to help them by curtailing <b>contractual</b> <b>options,</b> setting price limits, mandating counseling, and the like. These "remedies" impose heavy costs on the system and remove options from the borrowers they are supposed to help. This paper presents a single-market paradigm of market failure. It argues that market failure is pervasive, and presents some new data that support this view. The core reason for market failure is that effective shopping for a mortgage is extraordinarily difficult for even sophisticated borrowers. The effective remedy is to make mortgage shopping unnecessary. Eliminating the causes of market failure would eliminate predatory lending. Mortgage shopping is a highly-skilled professional service that should be purchasable in the market. I call the professionals providing this service "Upfront Mortgage Brokers" (UMBs), to distinguish them from conventional mortgage brokers who contribute to the problem. UMBs act as agents of the borrower in shopping for a mortgage, are paid a negotiated fee for their services, and disclose and pass through the prices they receive from lenders. In contrast, conventional mortgage brokers are independent contractors who mark up the prices they receive from lenders, which they do not disclose. The global remedy to predatory lending is to require by law that all mortgage brokers operate as UMBs. Then borrowers would shop for mortgage brokers, not for mortgages, and need concern themselves only with price, quality and referrals [...] the same factors they look at when hiring a house painter or an electrician. Predatory lending would then disappear. A voluntary association of UMBs, initiated by the writer, already exists. These UMBs are listed on my web site (www. mtgprofessor. com), through which they receive clients. While they comprise a tiny segment of the market, that segment works as competitive markets should. These brokers pass through the competitive wholesale prices they receive from lenders, while borrowers shop the brokers based on price and reputation. ...|$|R

40|$|In {{response}} to the 2008 runs on deposit-like assets, namely repo and money market funds, the Fed created new liquidity facilities for nonbanking institutions and the Treasury guaranteed certain money market fund balances. These extraordinary actions, while justified by officials as necessary to preserve the financial system, did rescue nonbanks by exposing the public to unprecedented risks. Since 2008, despite legislation and regulation, deposit-like assets are still vulnerable to runs. The fallback policy to contain such runs is still ad hoc lending by the Fed.

40|$|The paper aims at {{examining}} {{the hypothesis that}} the trust-oriented rules in the institutional environment and the specific internal antecedents of trust enlarge the range of stability of hybrid governance structures. Expanding on a previous analytical framework (Martino, 2007; Fritz et al., 2008), the study focuses on the contracting basis of hybrids and the centrality of trust to the existence of hybrids structures (Hofstede, 2006). Mènard and Valceschini (2005) show that the emergence hybrids characterizes the change of Agri-Food sector. Trust is a complex concept addressed under different analytical views. Scholars seem to often interpret trust in terms of rules for social interaction. Thus, under a transaction cost perspective, the trust issue can also be conceived in terms {{of the relationship between the}} institutional environment and governance structures, emphasizing the fact that trust-oriented rules tend to modify the parameters of the basic economic calculus (Williamson, 1993). Deakin et al. (2001) have pointed out that compliance with terms of contracts is central to trust, but also that contract adherence is tempered by flexibility beyond and outside the contract. On the other hand, the institutional forces constraints and channel <b>contractual</b> behaviour opening <b>options</b> for cooperative behaviour. Our analysis recognizes that trust-oriented rules can be identified in the institutional environment and that trust could emerge as a consequence of the influences of specific factors acting within given governance structures as antecedents of trust. We namely identify as sources of trust three basic factors acting as antecedents to trust within a hybrid structure: information exchange; control; risk aversion. These antecedents are thought of as exogenous variables determining the emergence of trust, which in turn is conceived here as an endogenous variable (Fritz et al., 2008). The analytical extent of our conjecture is intended to contribute to the understanding of the variety of the organizational forms in the AgriFood System (Saccomandi, 1998). The study also includes a case study designed to provide an example of the analytical framework proposed. The paper is organized as follows. In the paragraph 2 the objective of the study is presented with a brief discussion of the method adopted. In the paragraph 3 are illustrated the conceptual premises of the study: the diffusion of the hybrid structure in the Agri-Food chains and the concept of trust. Then the roles of the institutional environment and of the trust conditional to governance structure (Fritz et al., 2008) are examined. The thesis of the study is then proposed and it is introduced a tentative classification of the outcomes of the interaction between the institutional environment and the factors of the conditional trust. In the paragraph 4 it is presented the brief case study which concern a retailer involved in a system of relationship both at national and local level, entailing long term supply contracts. In the last paragraph are presented the final remarks of the study and the limits. Potential future research could address research questions related to the influence of the institutional environment rules, while a more extensive data collection is requested in order to test the prediction proposed. ...|$|R
40|$|Farmers’ Willingness to Grow Switchgrass as a Cellulosic Bioenergy Crop: A Stated Choice Approach Agriculture’s role as {{a source}} of {{feedstocks}} in a potential lignocellulosic-based biofuel industry is a critical economic issue. Several studies have assessed the technical feasibility of producing bioenergy crops on agricultural lands. However, few of these studies have assessed farmers’ willingness to produce or supply bioenergy crops or crop residues. Biomass markets for bioenergy crops do not exist, and developing these markets may take several years. Therefore, an important, yet unaddressed question is under what contractual or pricing arrangements farmers will grow biomass for bioenergy in these nascent markets. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to examine farmers’ willingness to produce switchgrass under alternative contractual, pricing, and harvesting arrangements. Contracts are likely to be the preferred method to bring together producers and processors of biomass for bioenergy. Contract design may vary across farmers and crop type, and may include attributes specific to annual crops, contract length, quantity or acreage requirements, quality specifications, payment dates, and other important features. A stated choice survey was administered in three, six-county areas of Kansas by Kansas State University and the USDA, National Agricultural Statistics Service from November 2010 to January 2011 to assess farmers’ willingness to produce cellulosic biomass under different contractual arrangements. This paper focuses on the switchgrass stated choice experiment from the survey. The stated choice experiment asked farmers to rank their preferred contractual arrangement from two contract options and one “do not adopt” <b>option.</b> <b>Contractual</b> attributes included percentage net returns above the next best alternative (e. g. CRP or hay production), contract length, a custom harvest option, insurance availability, and a seed-cost share option. Respondents then ranked their preferred contract option. The survey also collected data on farm characteristics, bioenergy crop preferences, socio-economic demographics, risk preferences, and marketing behavior. The survey used a stratified sample of farmers who farm more than 260 acres and grow corn. A total of 460 surveys were administered with a 65 percent completion rate. The underlying theoretical model uses the random utility model (RUM) approach to assess farmers’ willingness to grow switchgrass for bioenergy and determine the contractual attributes most likely to increase the likelihood of adoption. This framework allows us to define the “price,” or farmers’ mean willingness to accept, for harvested biomass sold to an intermediate processor. The estimated choice models follow the approach of Boxall and Adamowicz (2002) to capture heterogeneity across farmers and geographic regions due to management differences, conservation practices, and risk preferences. Using the percentage net return above CRP or hay production allows prices to float to levels that will entice farmers to adopt switchgrass. This will help determine a market price for bioenergy crops based on current market and production conditions without specifying an exact monetary value for the biomass. In addition, the survey results will facilitate contract designs between biorefineries and farmers while informing policymakers and the biofuel industry about farmers’ willingness to supply biomass for bioenergy production.

For VC-backed portfolio companies, volatility shocks correlate with faster and more frequent reinvestment. The level of volatility at the time of investment has no relation with future performance, consistent with competitive markets. Overall, my results imply that the option-like features of VC investments are first-order determinants of risk in VC. ^ The second paper, 2 ̆ 2 Intangible Capital and the Investment-q Relation, 2 ̆ 2 shows that the neoclassical theory of investment, which has mainly been tested with physical investment, also helps explain intangible investment. At the firm level, Tobin 2 ̆ 7 s q explains physical and intangible investment roughly equally well, and it explains total investment even better. Compared with physical capital, intangible capital adjusts more slowly to changes in investment opportunities. The classic q theory performs better in firms and years with more intangible capital: Total and even physical investment are better explained by Tobin 2 ̆ 7 s q and are less sensitive to cash flow. At the macro level, Tobin 2 ̆ 7 s q explains intangible investment many times better than physical investment. We propose a simple, new Tobin 2 ̆ 7 s q proxy that accounts for intangible capital, and we show that it is a superior proxy for both physical and intangible investment opportunities. ...|$|E
