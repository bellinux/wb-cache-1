40|$|The {{emergence}} of the <b>computer</b> <b>has</b> <b>revolutionized</b> communications, allowing quick dissemination of information to large numbers of people. Information transmitted electronically is often safeguarded through a widely available method known as encryption, which renders the information unintelligible to anyone without the ability to decrypt the message. Law enforcement agencies argue that unregulated encryption hinders their ability to prevent crime by providing criminals with a method of communication that cannot be accessed by police departments and government agencies. Proponents of encryption argue that privacy, security, and constitutional concerns outweigh law enforcement 2 ̆ 7 s fears, guaranteeing {{the ability to communicate}} confidentially. In 1994, the government adopted a new encryption standard that arguably alleviated the risks underlying confidential communications. This Note will argue that although voluntary, this action was a failed attempt at controlling encryption, and that as a result, the federal government will propose a mandatory encryption scheme.

Deriving information from these copious amounts of data and disseminating it. This problem is being exacerbated by technical software systems, which use proprietary and binary data formats that severely inhibit the flow of data and information both across departments and the larger organization. Generally this had led to data duplication and data redundancy. The Gemcom Enterprise Mining System (GEMS) makes use of industry standard, secure and open databases for all its data objects. It manages multiple users accessing the same bits and bytes in the database, preventing data duplication and redundancy. Developed in the Microsoft BackOffice ® environment, GEMS is also able to leverage the enormous amount of tools available in this environment, whether it’s for e-mail notification, reporting or data capture.

The ease of “block and copy” drafting of contracts and similar instruments, and the often corresponding decrease of close attention paid to any particular agreement in the drafting stage, increases the potential for misunderstanding among the parties to those agreements when the time comes for them to perform. When litigation results, the threshold issues for the parties, their counsel, and the court are often the same: What are the complete terms of the parties 2 ̆ 7 agreement? What was the parties 2 ̆ 7 intent in entering into the agreement? And, how can we prove (or challenge) said terms and intent?
