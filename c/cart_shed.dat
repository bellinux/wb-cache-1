25|$|The Cistercian convent {{buildings}} {{comprised the}} abbey, the actual convent and outbuildings, erected between 1300 and 1330. There were an abbey, a priorate, a granary, a threshing barn, a <b>cart</b> <b>shed,</b> a stable, a bakehouse, a mill, nuns' homes and a janitor's house, the latter {{along the northern}} wall of the abbey.|$|E
25|$|The {{buildings}} {{to the east}} of the hall, across a north-south track, are the original farmstead buildings dating from around 1800. These include stabls and a <b>cart</b> <b>shed</b> arranged around a fold yard. The horses and carts on display are typical of North Eastern farms of the era, Fells or Dales ponies and Cleveland Bay horses, and two wheeled long carts for hilly terrain (as opposed to four wheel carts).|$|E
25|$|The Balgray lands were at {{one time}} {{a part of the}} Hessilhead estate, and were in the 16th century were owned by the Montgomeries. John Stevenson and John Muir were {{connected}} with these lands in the early 18th century. Only a cottage and barn survive from what was a larger group of farm buildings, recorded on OS maps, most of which survived until the mid 20th century. The 1797 (dated on the lintel) barn, category B listed, would have been thatched or slated originally, with a lime harl that has entirely disintegrated. An arched opening, now blocked up, suggests that originally this building was used as a <b>cart</b> <b>shed.</b> Ventilation slits survive on all sides.|$|E
40|$|A {{record of}} four barns was {{prepared}} {{prior to their}} conversion to accommodation. Three of the barns were constructed in the mid-late 19 th century and two were designed as cowhouses with lofts over. They formed an extension of an existing farm and were associated with a diversification into the rearing of cattle. In the late 19 th century they were altered and a new combination barn with a layloft/threshing floor over <b>cart</b> <b>sheds</b> and a stable was constructed. All were altered in the later 20 th century when the <b>cart</b> <b>sheds</b> were converted to a dairy...|$|R
50|$|The estate {{buildings}} {{include the}} joiners' shop and smithy, the Midden Yard (with its saw mill and <b>cart</b> <b>sheds),</b> and the Stable Yard (with its stables and tack room, carriages and vintage bicycles and vintage cars). In {{the house are}} the laundry, bakehouse, kitchen and scullery.|$|R

The farmstead comprised a number of Grade II listed buildings and other nonlisted structures: The Farmhouse, The Oasts, The Loose Boxes, The Toll Cottage, The Granary & <b>Cart</b> <b>Sheds,</b> The Cowsheds and Stables, and The Bar...|$|R
25|$|This farm steading, {{previously}} {{known as}} Over Dunlophill Montgomerie, has a U-shaped plan {{and has been}} little modernised since the 19th century, leaving evidence for earlier phases plainly visible. The farm buildings comprise a two-storeyed farmhouse flanked to the south by stables, a harness room and a forge and to the north by a byre and a dairy. A barn and a <b>cart</b> <b>shed</b> are in a detached range to the rear (to the east) of the main block and a small watermill is to the north, adjacent to the dairy. The farm steading is built of whinstone rubble and has slate roofs. It was visited by the RCAHMS in 1993. In the surrounding fields can be seen the earthworks of a rig, some of which is slightly reverse-S in plan. The farm buildings are notable, if not exceptional, for the numerous date stones and marriage stone incorporated into {{various parts of the}} buildings.|$|E
25|$|A typical dovecot or doocot {{is located}} {{above the door}} of the <b>cart</b> <b>shed</b> building. The doocot is a typical feature of country estates, as the right to build one was {{strictly}} limited to the major landowners initially, and only later were small freeholders permitted to build them; at a more recent date tenants could sometimes gain permission from their landlord to build doocots to provide food or to add a picturesque feature to their properties. (Peters 2003). In the Middle Ages doocots or pigeon-houses were a badge of manorial privilege and distinctive, often very ornate buildings were constructed (Buxbaum 1987). The Kittochside doocot is a simple and practical design, however the problem of the pigeons feeding off the farm crops still had to be balanced against the benefits of the all year round meat supply that the doocot provided. A lean-to gig shed, (gig: a light, two-wheeled sprung cart pulled by one horse) was built {{at the north end of}} the stable in the early 19th century.|$|E
500|$|At {{the eastern}} side of the castle's {{courtyard}} were the remnants of the St. Stanislaus Church, next to which was located a tomb of M. Potocki. Next to the Kovpak Tower stood an Eastern Orthodox church where Prince Koriatovych was buried. In the courtyard along the southern walls between Kovpak and Tenchynska Towers were a granary and <b>cart</b> <b>shed.</b> Across from these, near the northern walls and Lanckorońska Tower, was the residence of the starosta. Next to the Tenchynska Tower stood the [...] "Rurmush" [...] which served as a water storage tank for the castle. At the southern walls closer to the White Tower (between Tenchynska and White Towers) were a kitchen and a bakery. Adjacent to the White Tower at the southern walls between White and Day Towers stood the starosta's headquarters. Located against the western walls were the chelyadna, or serfs' quarters, which housed up to 70 serfs who served the castle. Located outside of the northern walls were the castle stables, which could house up to 30 horses. In the 16th century the castle had a garrison of around 300 soldiers, who lived in the town.|$|E
25|$|The Exhibition Building was {{designed}} by Page\Park Architects and constructed in 1998-2001 on newly purchased land. It is designed to reflect its links {{with the world of}} agricultural and nature, with large sliding entrance doors giving access to a wood-clad barn-like building. The other outer walls appear to be 'white-washed' and the lower portion of almost the whole of one side appears to be open to the ground outside, echoing the design of typical barns, <b>cart</b> <b>sheds,</b> etc.|$|R
50|$|The {{areas to}} the north and west of the Argyle Tower are largely {{occupied}} by military buildings erected after the castle became a major garrison in the early 18th century. Adjacent to Mills Mount are the 18th-century <b>cart</b> <b>sheds,</b> now tea rooms. The Governor's House to the south was built in 1742 as accommodation for the Governor, Storekeeper, and Master Gunner, and was used until the post of Governor became vacant in the later 19th century; it was then used by nurses of the castle hospital. Today, it functions as an officers' mess, and as the office of the Governor since the restoration of the post in 1936.|$|R
50|$|The {{plantation}} {{again was}} put up for sale in February 1874, at which time 50-60 acres were under sugarcane. Improvements comprised: a furnished 10-roomed house (the front section of which was of cypress pine); 3 men's cottages; stables, <b>cart</b> <b>sheds,</b> stockyards, etc.; a wharf; stone store; and a large underground tank furnishing a permanent supply of water. There {{was no mention of}} a sugar mill or salt works, and agricultural reports in The Queenslander of 1876 suggest that Macleay Island cane was crushed on the mainland at this period. The plantation did not sell in 1874, and appears to have been let run down subsequently.|$|R
60|$|He {{found the}} place he seemed in need of at Hickleybrow, near Urshot, in Kent. It was a little queer {{isolated}} place, in a dell surrounded by old pine woods that were black and forbidding at night. A humped shoulder of down cut it off from the sunset, and a gaunt well with a shattered penthouse dwarfed the dwelling. The little house was creeperless, several windows were broken, and the <b>cart</b> <b>shed</b> had a black shadow at midday. It was {{a mile and a}} half from the end house of the village, and its loneliness was very doubtfully relieved by an ambiguous family of echoes.|$|E

5|$|In 1932, the two <b>cart</b> <b>sheds</b> {{on either}} side of the lane leading into the farm were removed. That year, Councillor T. R. Parker {{purchased}} a plot of land on the site from King's College. Manor Farm continued as a working farm until the following year, when the local council began to sell off much of the land surrounding the buildings for housing developments. Councillor Parker presented his land to the Ruislip Village Trust as the site of a future public hall, and the Trust passed it to the urban district council in 1964 stipulating that that would be the sole use. The council obliged and the Winston Churchill Hall was built in 1965.|$|R
50|$|High House is the {{collective}} {{name for a}} group of historic buildings in Purfleet, Thurrock, Essex, which was used as a farm for hundreds of years, with a Grade II listed house and barn, but with the addition of one of the best dovecotes (dove houses) in Southern England, which is a Scheduled Ancient Monument and notable for its nest box array. This property includes the house, coachman's cottage, chaise house, stable, granary, barn, workshop, <b>cart</b> <b>sheds,</b> dovecote, and inner and outer walled gardens. Known by many names in its past, the farm has been called Le Vineyards, because grape vines were grown on one of its south facing slopes. Its current name {{comes from the fact that}} it is a house 'High' on the hill, which commanded great views over the River Thames.|$|R
50|$|The Exhibition Building was {{designed}} by Page\Park Architects and constructed in 1998-2001 on newly purchased land. It is designed to reflect its links {{with the world of}} agricultural and nature, with large sliding entrance doors giving access to a wood-clad barn-like building. The other outer walls appear to be 'white-washed' and the lower portion of almost the whole of one side appears to be open to the ground outside, echoing the design of typical barns, <b>cart</b> <b>sheds,</b> etc. The three main themes to the museum are land, tools and people. Many of the artifacts and equipment originally came from the existing museum at Ingliston, others came from an operational traditional working farm, as well as items which were donated and some which were specific acquisitions. The displays illustrate how people lived and worked the land in the past, and how this helped shape the countryside which we see today. The museum also includes items which highlight the folklore aspects of the farming way of life, including a 'cup marked' stone, a collection of charms and many other display items.|$|R
50|$|Burns did {{not begin}} farming work until 11 June 1788. Ellisland had no {{farmhouse}} or farm buildings and Patrick Miller provided Burns with £300 to build one, construct the byre, <b>cart</b> <b>shed,</b> etc. and to stock the farm and enclose the fields.|$|E
50|$|In Great Britain {{the farm}} {{building}} {{was called a}} <b>cart</b> <b>shed.</b> These typically were open fronted, single story buildings, with the roof supported by regularly spaced pillars.They often face away from the farmyard and may be found close to the stables and roadways, giving {{direct access to the}} fields.|$|E
5000|$|The farm {{contains}} several listed {{buildings and}} structures. The Great Barn is listed Grade II*. The farmhouse, <b>cart</b> <b>shed,</b> and the loose boxes north {{west of the}} barn are all listed Grade II. The [...] "K6" [...] model red telephone box on the farm is also Grade II listed.|$|E
5000|$|The {{design of}} the farm {{buildings}} {{are based on the}} design in Poundley’s Cottage Architecture which was published in 1857. Poundley was the architect for the Naylor Estates and worked from Black Hall in Kerry. [...] The intention was to build a smaller version of the Victorian Model or Industraial Farms of the mid- 19th century. Poundley would have been working on the much larger farm complex which he had designed for John Naylor at Leighton Hall near Welshpool. Poundley published layout has been modified and scaled down at Upper Pengelli. The long spinal building with a central ventilator, that was for cattle stalls was shortened and pigsties and sheepfolds were parallel with, rather than at right angles to the spinal building. As in the plan the hay barn with its ventilated brick windows and the stabling is at right angles. There was also a root store for feeding the cattle and a raised seed store. The sheep fold later was adapted to be used as <b>cart</b> <b>sheds.</b> The farm would have been highly mechanised with a drive shaft, possibly powered by a steam engine, that runs down the spinal building.|$|R
5000|$|A stray {{reference}} to Beaver Valley in 1694 {{refers to the}} lands bordering Beaver Run as “mill lands,” and surveyors laying out Beaver Valley Road in 1712 passed by “the mill that Chandler is building.” Until well into the 19th century, Beaver Run and its tributaries supported small mills - generally managed by their owners and from one to three workers that produced a range of products, from lumber, to tin, to flax, to paper. By {{the third quarter of}} the 19th century the Valley had become a thriving community of several hundred people organized around two schools, the mills, and the characteristic family farms of 40 to 120 acres. Many of the mills and dams in Beaver Valley were damaged or destroyed {{as the result of the}} flood of 1843.The landscape of Beaver Valley in the Woodlawn Wildlife Refuge has more than a trace of these early European beginnings, some dating back to 1683. Stone and wood-framed 18th and 19th century dwellings and outbuildings - barns, corn cribs, <b>cart</b> <b>sheds,</b> and springhouses - dot the landscape, a unique manifestation of the regional rural heritage. Located less than 2 miles from the famous Brandywine Battlefield, the Delaware County Planning Commission has noted that the area has [...] "high potential" [...] for archaeological resources given that it has remained undeveloped since the Township's founding before 1683.|$|R
6000|$|And the vicarage {{was truly}} very {{interesting}} and amusing. To these Londoners accustomed {{to live in a}} state of compression, elbows practically touching, in a tall, narrow fore-and-aft stucco house, all window and staircase, in a despondent Brompton square, there was an effect of maundering freedom about the place, of enlargement almost to the pitch of adventure and sunlight to the pitch of intoxication. The house itself was long and low, as if a London house holidaying in the country had flung itself asprawl; it had two disconnected and roomy staircases, and when it had exhausted itself completely as a house, it turned to the right and began again as rambling, empty stables, coach house, <b>cart</b> <b>sheds,</b> men's bedrooms up ladders, and outhouses of the most various kinds. On one hand was a neglected orchard, {{in the front of the}} house was a bald, worried-looking lawn area capable of simultaneous tennis and croquet, and at the other side a copious and confused vegetable and flower garden full of roses, honesty, hollyhocks, and suchlike herbaceous biennials and perennials, lapsed at last into shrubbery, where a sickle-shaped, weedy lagoon of uncertain aims, which had evidently, as a rustic bridge and a weeping willow confessed, aspired to be an [...] "ornamental water," [...] declined at last to ducks. And there was access to the church, and the key of the church tower, and one went across the corner of the lawn, and by a little iron gate into the churchyard to decipher inscriptions, as if the tombs of all Buryhamstreet were no more than a part of the accommodation relinquished by the vicar's household.|$|R
50|$|The Cistercian convent {{buildings}} {{comprised the}} abbey, the actual convent and outbuildings, erected between 1300 and 1330.

50|$|The huts were {{disguised}} {{in different}} ways: one {{to look like}} a <b>cart</b> <b>shed</b> with barn (J), two to look like cottages (H&I), the fourth to look like stables (K), the fifth disguised as a glasshouse (M) block, and the sixth, Hut G, as a cricket pavilion complete with a false clock tower.|$|E
50|$|The open shed {{dates from}} the eighteenth century. It was {{originally}} built at Charlwood, Surrey. It served as a <b>cart</b> <b>shed</b> and also a saw shed. The shed was dismantled in 1999, the work being partly funded by the British Airports Authority. When it was reconstructed at the Museum in 2000, the horse whim from West Kingsdown, Kent, was installed.|$|E
5000|$|Louis Lassen (1865 - March 20, 1935 New Haven, Connecticut) was a [...] "blacksmith {{by trade}} and preacher by vocation" [...] and immigrated to New Haven from Denmark in 1886. He became a food peddler, selling butter and eggs from a wooden cart. Lassen {{purchased}} a home at 45 Elliot Street and stored his <b>cart</b> in a <b>shed</b> in the backyard. In 1895, Lassen began adding lunch items to his cart. According to the 1899 New Haven directory, Lassen was a butter dealer and included his home address.|$|R
60|$|I {{followed}} {{him through the}} house into the stable-yard, where I observed the driver washing the <b>cart</b> in a <b>shed.</b> He must have heard {{the explosion of the}} pistol. He could not choose but hear it: the thing was shaped like a little blunderbuss, charged to the mouth, and made a report like a piece of field artillery. He had heard, he had paid no attention; and now, as we came forth by the back-door, he raised for a moment a pale and tell-tale face that was as direct as a confession. The rascal had expected to see Fenn come forth alone; he was waiting to be called on for that part of sexton, which I had already allotted to him in fancy.|$|R
25|$|The farm is {{equipped}} with three tractors which would have all seen service during the war - a Case, a Fordson N and a 1924 Fordson F. The farm also features horse drawn traps, reflecting the effect wartime rationing of petrol would have had on car use. The farming equipment in the <b>cart</b> and machinery <b>sheds</b> reflects the transition of the time from horse drawn to tractor pulled implements, with some older equipment put back into use due to the war, {{as well as a}} large Foster thresher, vital for cereal crop, and built specifically for the war effort, sold at the Newcastle Show. Although the wartime focus was on crops, the farm also features breeds of sheep, cattle, pigs and poultry that would have been typical for the time. The farm also has a portable steam engine, not in use, but presented as having been left out for collection as part of a wartime scrap metal drive.|$|R
50|$|The {{buildings}} {{to the east}} of the hall, across a north-south track, are the original farmstead buildings dating from around 1800. These include stabls and a <b>cart</b> <b>shed</b> arranged around a fold yard. The horses and carts on display are typical of North Eastern farms of the era, Fells or Dales ponies and Cleveland Bay horses, and two wheeled long carts for hilly terrain (as opposed to four wheel carts).|$|E
50|$|The {{course was}} {{completed}} in September 1940. The property consisted of approximately 229 acres with an 18-hole course, a driving range and a putting green. Several cobblestone benches that were installed when the course was built are still present at some tees. New structures, including a replacement clubhouse, a golf <b>cart</b> <b>shed,</b> and maintenance buildings, {{were built in the}} 1970s and are not historically significant. Holes 1 and 10 are {{at the site of the}} former Miller Field.|$|E
5000|$|The {{house was}} granted listed {{building}} status but the conversion {{to a hospital}} meant many of the original features of the house were removed or replaced, including a large oval staircase which was replaced by concrete steps, and the national listed building status was revoked. However the house, along with the stables, dairy cottage, <b>cart</b> <b>shed,</b> lodge houses, gate piers and associated wing walls were all still locally listed as of 2011. The complex was left empty in 1996 and began to decay.|$|E
60|$|As I {{was leaving}} the Irishman's roof after the rain, bending my steps again to the pond, my haste to catch pickerel, wading in retired meadows, in sloughs and bog-holes, in forlorn and savage places, {{appeared}} for an instant trivial to me who {{had been sent to}} school and college; but as I ran down the hill toward the reddening west, with the rainbow over my shoulder, and some faint tinkling sounds borne to my ear through the cleansed air, from I know not what quarter, my Good Genius seemed to say--Go fish and hunt far and wide day by day--farther and wider--and rest thee by many brooks and hearth-sides without misgiving. Remember thy Creator in the days of thy youth. Rise free from care before the dawn, and seek adventures. Let the noon find thee by other lakes, and the night overtake thee everywhere at home. There are no larger fields than these, no worthier games than may here be played. Grow wild according to thy nature, like these sedges and brakes, which will never become English bay. Let the thunder rumble; what if it threaten ruin to farmers' crops? That is not its errand to thee. Take shelter under the cloud, while they flee to <b>carts</b> and <b>sheds.</b> Let not to get a living be thy trade, but thy sport. Enjoy the land, but own it not. Through want of enterprise and faith men are where they are, buying and selling, and spending their lives like serfs.|$|R
50|$|A 1910 description, {{which was}} part of a {{national}} survey to establish a new property tax, states that the Mill House was in good repair, with two living rooms, kitchen, dairy, and three bedrooms. Outside there was a coal house, an outside privy, a stable (with two stalls), chaff house, <b>cart</b> <b>shed,</b> bake house, engine shed (wood,iron), and a mill powered by steam and wind in good repair. The whole property was assessed at a market value of £480 of which buildings accounted for £420.|$|E
50|$|In January 1890, Leonard advertised {{the whole}} of his Dragon Street {{property}} for sale. At this time it comprised a half acre of land on which were erected a brick dwelling house of 4 rooms downstairs and 2 rooms upstairs, with kitchen, large produce shed and horse and <b>cart</b> <b>shed,</b> and a new brick store with a good 3-roomed dry store at the rear. The new store was stocked with drapery, groceries, boots and shoes, and Leonard advertised as the National Stores, Dragon Street.|$|E
