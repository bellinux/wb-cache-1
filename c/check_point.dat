40|$|Memory <b>check</b> <b>pointing</b> is {{a pivotal}} {{technique}} in systems reliability, with applications ranging from crash recovery to replay debugging. Unfortunately, many traditional memory <b>check</b> <b>pointing</b> use-cases require high-frequency checkpoints, something for which existing application-level solutions are not well-suited. The {{problem is that}} they incur either substantial run-time performance overhead, or poor memory usage guarantees. As a result, their application in practice is hampered. This paper presents Lightweight Memory <b>Check</b> <b>pointing</b> (LMC), a new user-level memory <b>check</b> <b>pointing</b> technique that combines low performance overhead with strong memory usage guarantees for high <b>check</b> <b>pointing</b> frequencies. To this end, LMC relies on compiler-based instrumentation to shadow the entire memory address space of the running program and incrementally checkpoint modified memory bytes in a LMC-maintained shadow state. Our evaluation on popular server applications demonstrates the viability of our approach in practice, confirming that LMC imposes low performance overhead with strictly bounded memory usage at runtime...|$|R
40|$|Abstract- This paper {{deals with}} the {{overview}} of decentralized <b>check</b> <b>pointing</b> using QOS in MOG. <b>Check</b> <b>pointing</b> is more crucial in MOG systems than in their conventional wired counter parts due to host mobility. Dynamically, less reliable wireless links frequent disconnections and variation in mobile systems. The algorithms and protocols than we can take an adaptive protocol to reduce the overhead and leasing mechanism is for storage but have a problem that can overcome by synchronous snapshot algorithm {{is that we have}} rollback/recovery algorithm but have low communication, and storage overhead. The mutable checkpoints should be minimized. If we talk about a large scale super computing system with coordinated <b>check</b> <b>pointing</b> and rollback recovery. We have work fraction is relatively low correlated failures must be taken in to account. We can also see an NP-Complete problem, so these all problems can overcome by using an algorithm said to be as Reliability Driven (ReD). With ReD an MH simply sends its <b>check</b> <b>pointed</b> data to one selected neighboring MH, and also serves as a stable point of storage for <b>check</b> <b>pointed</b> data received from a single approved neighboring MH. Here ReD works to maximize the probability of <b>check</b> <b>pointed</b> data recovery during job execution. So we are going to implement one of them as NP-Complete problem can be solved by this we can see in future as Overview of Decentralized <b>Check</b> <b>pointing</b> Using QOS in MOG...|$|R

After finding her, she informs Mulder and Scully that the aliens are here to destroy all life on Earth and that she is a successful alien-human hybrid. The Smoking Man (William B.

40|$|In this paper, we have {{presented}} an efficient non-blocking coordinated <b>check</b> <b>pointing</b> algorithm for distributed systems. It produces a consistent set of checkpoints, without the overhead of taking temporary checkpoints; the algorithm also {{makes sure that}} only few processes {{are required to take}} checkpoints in its any execution; it uses very few control messages and the participating processes are interrupted fewer number of times when compared to some noted related works. The two most important criteria are non-blocking and minimum number of checkpoints. Cao-Singhal showed in their algorithm {{that it is impossible to}} design minimum process non-blocking algorithm but it is not desirable in mobile environment that underlying computation will be blocked whenever a <b>check</b> <b>pointing</b> algorithm invoked. If the <b>check</b> <b>pointing</b> scheme is blocking then the performance of the system will be highly affected by the frequent initiation of <b>check</b> <b>pointing</b> algorithm.

So, the proposed scheme concentrate to minimize this overhead by combining coordinated <b>check</b> <b>pointing</b> with minimum blocking time...|$|R

40|$|It {{is known}} that <b>check</b> <b>pointing</b> and {{rollback}} recovery are widely used techniques that allow a distributed computing to progress {{in spite of a}} failure. There are two fundamental approaches for <b>check</b> <b>pointing</b> and recovery. One is asynchronous approach, process take their checkpoints independently. So, taking checkpoints is very simple but due to absence of a recent consistent global checkpoint which may cause a rollback of computation. Synchronous <b>check</b> <b>pointing</b> approach assumes that a single process other than the application process invokes the <b>check</b> <b>pointing</b> algorithm periodically to determine a consistent global checkpoint. Various flavors of these two techniques, their mechanisms, advantages and drawbacks have been discussed in detail. Besides an exhaustive study of the implementation issues are also included.

40|$|Abstract. In this paper, we have {{proposed}} a simple and efficient approach for <b>check</b> <b>pointing</b> and recovery in cluster computing environment. The recovery scheme deals with both orphan and lost intra and inter cluster messages. This <b>check</b> <b>pointing</b> scheme ensures that after the system recovers from failures, all processes in different clusters can restart from their respective recent checkpoints; thus avoiding any domino effect. That is, the recent <b>check</b> <b>points</b> always form a consistent recovery line of the cluster federation. The main features of our work are: it uses selective message logging which enables the initiator process in each cluster to log the minimum number of messages, the recovery scheme is domino effect free and is executed simultaneously by all clusters in the cluster federation, it considers concurrent failures, message complexities in each cluster for both <b>check</b> <b>pointing</b> and recovery schemes are just O(n), where n {{is the number of}} processes in a cluster. These features make our algorithm superior to the existing works. ...|$|R
