5|$|Due to {{the poor}} {{response}} to the demand for the surrender of weapons, the deadline was extended several times until a date of 8 July was fixed. On 17 May, court-martials were established to try those that were arrested in possession of weapons, and those found guilty were immediately executed by firing squad. The precedent for this brutal repressive measure against Serbs had already been established by the Germans. It was <b>clear</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> outset that the NDH weapons laws were not being enforced as strictly against Croats as they were against Serbs. Securing the border between eastern Herzegovina and Montenegro was considered a high priority due to concerns that the Montenegrin Federalist Party had revived Montenegrin claims to parts of the NDH that had been promised to the Kingdom of Montenegro in the 1915 Treaty of London.|$|E
5|$|It was <b>clear</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> {{beginning}} of the CryoSat programme that an extensive series of measurements would be needed, both to understand interaction of the radar waves with {{the surface of the}} ice caps and to relate the measured freeboard of floating sea ice with its thickness. This latter, in particular, would have to take account of snow loading. For sea ice, which moves as it is blown by the wind, it was also necessary to develop techniques which could give consistent results when measured from platforms travelling at different speed (scientists on the surface, helicopter-towed sounders, aircraft-borne radars and CryoSat itself). A number of campaigns were performed under a programme called CRYOVEX which aimed to address each of the identified areas of uncertainty. These campaigns continued through the development of the original CryoSat and were planned to continue after its launch.|$|E

5|$|It was <b>clear</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> onset that Stephen's {{reign in}} Serbia would be short-lived. The Ottoman sultan Mehmed the Conqueror {{considered}} Stephen's enthronement an unwarranted violation {{of his own}} rights, for the Ottomans too considered Serbia their vassal state. Mehmed promptly launched an attack on Smederevo in June, {{and there was no}} serious consideration of trying to defend it. King Thomas rushed to his son's aid, trying to divert the Turks by laying siege to their fortress of Hodidjed, in the middle of Bosnia. Aware that Smederevo could not withstand Mehmed's attack, Stephen surrendered the fortress on 20 June. The Ottoman proceeded to annex the rest of the Serbian state to their empire within a year.|$|E
5|$|The safety {{car pulled}} off the track {{at the end of}} lap twenty-three and the race resumed with Vettel leading from Alonso and Hamilton. Vettel began to {{gradually}} pull <b>clear</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> rest of the field. On the twenty-fourth lap while battling with Senna for twenty-first place, Trulli collided with Senna after attempting a passing manoeuvre around the inside; Trulli's front wing was knocked off. Trulli drove to his garage for repairs. Button, who was in fifth, started to place Massa under pressure on the same lap. Kobayashi passed Yamamoto on lap twenty-six but ran wide and fell down the order, while Trulli rejoined the race. Di Grassi lost control of his car at turn fourteen after trying to pass Yamamoto on lap twenty-seven; he made light contact with the wall which caused him to retire.|$|E
5|$|The toll {{collected}} by Hrvatske autoceste along the A3 motorway from January to August 2009 {{was reported to}} comprise the largest proportion of the total toll revenue {{collected by}} the company for the period: 889.8 millionkuna (approximately 121.9 millioneuro). Even though this figure is not further decomposed into the individual sections of motorway, it is <b>clear</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> traffic volume data analysis that the largest portion of the toll revenue is collected on the sections between Zagreb and Slavonski Brod, and especially on those sections closest to the Ivanja Reka interchange.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{the fact}} that the {{selection}} of a volatile hassium compound (hassium tetroxide) for gas-phase chemical studies was <b>clear</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> beginning, the chemical characterization of hassium was considered a difficult task for a long time. Although hassium isotopes were first synthesized in 1984, it was not until 1996 that a hassium isotope long-lived enough to allow chemical studies to be performed was synthesized. Unfortunately, this hassium isotope, 269Hs, was then synthesized indirectly from the decay of 277Cn; not only are indirect synthesis methods not favourable for chemical studies, but also the reaction that produced the isotope 277Cn had a low yield (its cross-section was only 1 pb), and thus did not provide enough hassium atoms for a chemical investigation. The direct synthesis of 269Hs and 270Hs in the reaction 248Cm(26Mg,xn)274âˆ’xHs (x = 4 or 5) appeared more promising, as the cross-section for this reaction was somewhat larger, at 7 pb. This yield was still around ten times lower than that for the reaction used for the chemical characterization of bohrium. New techniques for irradiation, separation, and detection had to be introduced before hassium could be successfully characterized chemically as a typical member of group 8 in early 2001.|$|E
5|$|Each {{side has}} {{two sets of}} street stairs, with the {{full-time}} entrance at Grand Avenue and Broadway on the west end. There are two additional staircases by the crossovers; however, these are closed at night. HEET access {{at both ends of}} the mezzanine allow people to exit fare control without having to walk down to the middle of the mezzanine. Originally, there were two fare control areas at each end, which is <b>clear</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> presence of two closed staircases at the Manhattan-bound side. The mezzanine narrows to about two-thirds of its width on the southern side of the mezzanine directly to the opposite of the closed staircases. The narrowing of the mezzanine did not allow for staircases on the Queens-bound side in this location like on the Manhattan-bound side. Chain-link fence is used to separate the area inside and outside fare control. In total, this side of the station has four staircases in addition to the two closed ones mentioned, while the other side has five staircases.|$|E
5|$|In early 346 BC, Philip let it {{be known}} that he {{intended}} to march south with the Thessalians, though not where or why. The Phocians thus made plans to defend Thermopylae, and requested assistance from the Spartans and the Athenians, probably around the 14th of February. The Spartans dispatched Archidamos III with 1000 hoplites, and the Athenians ordered everyone eligible for military service under the age of 40 to be sent to the Phocians' aid. However, between the Phocians' appeal and the end of the month, all plans were upset by the return of Phalaikos to power in Phocis; the Athenians and the Spartans were subsequently told that they would not be permitted to defend Thermopylae. It is not <b>clear</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> ancient sources why Phalaikos was returned to power, nor why he adopted this dramatic change of policy. Cawkwell suggests, based on remarks of Aeschines that the Phocian army restored Phalaikos because they had not been properly paid, and further that Phalaikos, realizing that the army could not be paid and that the Phocians could no longer hope to win the war, decided to try to negotiate a peace settlement with Philip.|$|E

5|$|Michael Schumacher {{began to}} pull <b>clear</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> {{rest of the field}} and set {{consecutive}} fastest laps. Barrichello began to hold up the McLaren drivers to allow his teammate to extend his lead. Further down the field, Trulli passed Ralf Schumacher to take seventh position on lap two. Heidfeld was overtaken by Alesi for 14th on the same lap. On the following lap, Ralf Schumacher retook seventh position from Trulli. Heidfeld lost a further position to Fisichella on lap four. Ralf Schumacher started to challenge Frentzen for sixth position on the fifth lap. At the front of the pack, Michael Schumacher was in control, extending his lead over Barrichello to five seconds by lap ten. Button took tenth position from Irvine on lap twelve, while Heidfeld collided with Alesi, sending his teammate into a spin who rejoined in 18th. Button moved into ninth place when he passed Salo on lap 13. Zonta, who was running 17th, suffered brake problems on lap 17 and collided with the tyre barriers which caused him to retire from the Grand Prix.|$|E
5|$|The {{circumstances}} surrounding the advance to power in 1269 of the next ruler, Traidenis, are not <b>clear.</b> <b>From</b> <b>the</b> outset his relationships with Galiciaâ€“Volhynia were tense and eventually resulted in the 1274â€“1276 war. Traidenis was successful in battle, and his control over Black Ruthenia was strengthened. Traidenis, known for his strong anti-German attitude, was also successful in fighting with the Livonian Order. In 1270 he won the Battle of Karuse, fought on ice near Saaremaa. However, in 1272 the Order retaliated, attacking Semigalia and building DÃ¼naburg (Daugavpils) Castle in 1273 on lands nominally controlled by Traidenis. Several years later, in 1281, Traidenis conquered Jersika Castle in the present-day PreiÄ¼i District, {{and was able to}} exchange it for the DÃ¼naburg Castle. DÃ¼naburg remained a Lithuanian outpost until 1313. In 1279 the Order attacked Lithuanian lands, reaching as far as KernavÄ—, but on their way back they suffered a major defeat in the Battle of Aizkraukle. The Order's master, Ernst von Rassburg, died in the battle, and the conquered Semigallians rebelled. The Semigallians were now willing to acknowledge Lithuania's superiority and asked Traidenis for assistance. However, Traidenis died soon afterwards, and the rebellion was not successful.|$|E
5|$|The system {{originated}} {{from one of}} several powerful tropical waves that moved off {{the west coast of}} Africa {{in the second half of}} August. When the wave came off the African coast, it already had cyclonic rotation, although it was fairly disorganized. As the wave moved westward into open waters, it developed rapidly. Late on August 21, it formed a low-level circulation and was declared Tropical Depression Nine. The system quickly matured and was upgraded to Tropical Storm Humberto early on August 22. Beginning on a west-northwest track, it was <b>clear</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> outset that Humberto would not affect land, due to a weakness in the subtropical ridge to the north which would eventually turn the storm northward. Favorable outflow and distinct banding pattern quickly formed in a very conducive environment, with warm sea surface temperatures and low wind shear. Humberto intensified into a high-end tropical storm on the afternoon and evening of August 22. Early on August 23, the storm was upgraded to Hurricane Humberto.|$|E
