40|$|<b>Browning</b> of <b>mushroom</b> {{tends to}} occur during hot air drying due to Poly Phenol Oxidase (PPO), while {{glutathione}} {{is known for}} its ability to inhibit the activity of PPO and browning. In this study, the efficacy of glutathione in inhibiting <b>browning</b> on <b>mushroom</b> slices was estimated. <b>Browning</b> of <b>mushroom</b> slices treated with glutathione was monitored during hot air drying. PPO activity in mushroom was inhibited by 98. 2 with 0. 08 % glutathione. Compared with the control, mushroom slices treated with glutathione showed no browning during hot air drying. These results indicate that application of glutathione is a promising method of Anti-browning of mushroom by glutathione during hot air drying...|$|R
