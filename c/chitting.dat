50|$|Henry <b>Chitting</b> (1580 - 7 January 1638) was a long-serving {{officer of}} arms at the College of Arms in London.|$|E
50|$|<b>Chitting</b> first {{married a}} widow whom he outlived and about whom little is known. Some time after 1612 he married Ann, the {{daughter}} of William Bennet. She died on 8 May 1630 {{at the age of}} 27. The two had three children. After her death, he then married Susan, daughter of John Darnall of Hertingfordbury, Hertfordshire, who survived him. <b>Chitting</b> was admitted to Gray's Inn on 4 August 1633, and this was presumably a result of his links with the Bacon family. He died on 7 January 1638 and was buried at Islington. For the occasion, fifty copies of his funeral sermon were printed.|$|E
50|$|His heraldic {{career was}} started {{thanks to his}} family's ties to Sir Nicholas Bacon. On 18 July 1618, <b>Chitting</b> was {{appointed}} Chester Herald of Arms in Ordinary after purchasing the position from his predecessor. In this capacity he visited Berkshire and Gloucestershire in 1623 for William Camden, Clarenceux King of Arms.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Chitting</b> is {{a method}} of {{preparing}} potatoes or other tubers for planting. The seed potatoes are placed in a tray (often in egg cartons) in a light and cool place and given a little water. All but {{three or four of}} the [...] "eyes" [...] (sprouting parts) of the potato are removed, leaving the strongest growths only. After the sprouts are about 1 in long, the seed potatoes are planted in the ground.|$|E
50|$|Kōwhai can {{be grown}} from seed or tip {{cuttings}} in spring and autumn. The dark or bright yellow seeds germinate best after <b>chitting</b> and being soaked in water for several hours. They can also benefit from a several minute submersion in boiling water to soften the hard shell and then being kept in the same water, taken off boil, for several hours to soak up the water. Young kōwhai are quite frost tender, so cuttings or seedlings should be planted in their second year when they are 30 cm or higher.|$|E
40|$|Using three cultivars, <b>chitting</b> tomato {{seed and}} priming tomato seed with P. E. G. {{was found to}} have no effect on the early {{relative}} growth rate of the seedlings, when compared with untreated seed. However, because chitted seeds emerged earlier than primed seeds, which in turn emerged earlier than untreated seed, at any one time, the plants from chitted seed were larger than those from primed seed, and both were found to be larger than those from untreated seed. The seed treatments along with a high quality transplant treatment were compared in a field study to determine plant weight and fruit yield at four plant densities (62, 500, 160, 000, 200, 000 and 591, 716 plants per hectare). Castlong was found to give heavier total fruit yields than either VF 145 -B 7879 or Fireball. This is attributed to the higher proportion of fruit total plant weight that this variety develops. Castlong also produced a higher proportion of ripe total fruit at all harvests, this is considered to be due to this cultivar's early maturity combined with its excellent field storage characteristics. Transplanted plants in all cases yielded heavier and matured earlier than any of the three seed treatments. The yields and maturity characteristics were not significantly different from any of the three seed treatments. Increasing the plant density from 62, 500 plants per hectare to 591, 716 plants per hectare increased fruit number and yield per unit area and also tended to increase the proportion of the fruit that was ripe. The number of fruit per plant decreased as plant density increased...|$|E

40|$|Human chitotriosidase (<b>Chit),</b> a chitinolytic enzyme, is {{a member}} of the {{chitinase}} family. In human plasma, <b>Chit</b> activity has been proposed as a biochemical marker of macrophage activation in several lysosomal diseases. Recently we found that <b>Chit</b> activity is higher in patients affected by Plasmodium falciparum malaria infection, suggesting that <b>Chit</b> may reflect induction of an immunological response. To assess this hypothesis, we evaluated the <b>CHIT</b> 1 mRNA levels in human monocytes/macrophages (HMMs) following treatment with interferon-gamma (IFN&# 978;), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF&# 945;), and lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Stimulation of macrophages with INF-&# 978;, TNF-&# 945;, and LPS resulted in an increase in <b>Chit</b> activity as well as the levels of <b>CHIT</b> 1 mRNA as measured by quantitative real-time PCR. The data presented in this article show that <b>Chit</b> plays a role in the response to the activation of INF-&# 978;-, TNF-&# 945;-, and LPS-driven macrophages, suggesting that the production of <b>Chit</b> by macrophages could have biological relevance in the immune-response...|$|R

40|$|Chitotriosidase (<b>Chit</b> 1) is {{an enzyme}} {{associated}} with various diseases, including Gaucher disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, Alzheimer disease and cystic fibrosis.

In contrast, <b>Chit</b> 1 tagged with Protein A at the N-terminus and V 5 -His at the C-terminus, was expressed in the periplasmic space of E. coli as a soluble protein and successfully purified. We evaluated the chitinolytic properties of the recombinant enzyme using 4 -nitrophenyl N,N'-diacetyl-β-D-chitobioside [4 NP-chitobioside, 4 NP-(GlcNAc) 2] and found that its activity was comparable to CHO cells-expressed <b>Chit</b> 1 -V 5 -His. Optimal conditions for the E. coli-produced <b>Chit</b> 1 were pH ~ 5. 0 at 50 °C. <b>Chit</b> 1 was stable after 1 h incubation at pH 5. 0 ~ 11. 0 on ice and its chitinolytic activity was lost at pH 2. 0, although the affinity to chitin remained unchanged. <b>Chit</b> 1 efficiently cleaved crystalline and colloidal chitin substrates as well as oligomers of N-acetyl-D-glucosamine (GlcNAc) releasing primarily (GlcNAc) 2 fragments at pH 5. 0.
