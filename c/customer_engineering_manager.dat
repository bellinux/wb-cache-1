The rapid progress of events brought anges which affected the accuracy of the information in this booklet e it necessary that the booklet be withdrawn from release at that me. It is now believed that the need for this booklet on electronics has passed but rather than destroy the existing copies, it was considered advisable to offer the <b>Customer</b> <b>Engineering</b> <b>Manager</b> an opportunity to request a quantity of existing booklets as long as the supply is available. A number of minor revisions could be made, however, the major points of correction are as follows: 1. To eliminate any inaccurate statements in Chapter VII on the Electronic Time System, pages 55 and 56 have been removed...|$|E

40|$|M. Ing. The {{aim of this}} {{research}} project {{is to determine the}} importance of leadership from <b>engineering</b> <b>managers</b> working in consulting engineering firms. This is achieved by discussing important factors relating to the development of leadership skills in these managers. These important factors are the expertise of <b>engineering</b> <b>managers</b> in practice, leadership from <b>engineering</b> <b>managers,</b> with the required leadership theories and styles, and other factors that contribute to leadership development in <b>engineering</b> <b>managers.</b> The findings were that the use of appropriate leadership styles for the different designated levels of team members is essential. The author of the research project suggested leadership styles from different leadership theories that might be used in managing and leading team members at different designated levels. The appropriateness and adequacy of the suggested leadership styles was tested by developing questionnaires which were to be completed by team members at designated levels. The use of questionnaires led to the reduced amount of leadership styles preferred by team members at their designated levels. The <b>engineering</b> <b>manager</b> who uses the preferred leadership styles by team members tends to achieve goals aligned with the organisation’s vision and mission statement. The alignment of goals with the company’s mission statement and vision leads to a successful organisation. This would also lead to the team members being eager to accomplish their assignments, as well as gaining credibility and achieving organisational goals effectively and efficiently, together with the <b>engineering</b> <b>manager...</b>|$|R

5000|$|There are {{a number}} of {{societies}} and organizations dedicated to the field of engineering management. One of the largest societies is a division of IEEE, the Engineering Management Society, which regularly publishes a trade magazine. Another prominent professional organization in the field is the American Society for Engineering Management (ASEM), which was founded in 1979 by a group of 20 <b>engineering</b> <b>managers</b> from industry. [...] ASEM currently certifies <b>engineering</b> <b>managers</b> (two levels) via the Associate <b>Engineering</b> <b>Manager</b> (AEM) or Professional <b>Engineering</b> <b>Manager</b> (PEM) certification exam. The Master of Engineering Management Programs Consortium is a newly formed consortium of prominent universities intended to raise the value and visibility of the MEM degree. [...] Also, engineering management university programs have the possibility of being accredited by ABET, ATMAE, or ASEM. In Canada, the Canadian Society for Engineering Management (CSEM) is a constituent society of the Engineering Institute of Canada (EIC), Canada's oldest learned engineering society.|$|R

To mitigate these effects, a Hierarchical Decision Model (HDM) was utilized for this study to rank <b>Engineering</b> <b>Manager</b> Candidates. The HDM utilized pairwise comparison surveys, expert data from three different Industry groups, desirability curves, candidate profiles and constant sum method for data processing. Data was processed for each Industry expert group separately and as a combined expert group. The ranking results reflected the influence of Industry expert groups and identified inconsistencies in the data created by the expert data...|$|R
