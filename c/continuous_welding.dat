50|$|The South Australian {{engineers}} {{followed the}} later {{practice of the}} Goldfields Water Supply in adopting <b>continuous</b> <b>welding</b> of the pipes. This was soon vindicated when floods hit Port Augusta and Whyalla, causing damage to roads, bridges and the pipeline. At one place, where the water had swept across the road and piled timber up against the pipeline a length of pipe 80 m. between concrete blocks had been bowed outward by over a metre, but had not broken. In another place an 80 m. length of pipe had been completely undermined, and the pipe had sagged about a metre, being dragged down by a large concrete block, weighing about three tonnes, which was left suspended. Close to the block the pipe had buckled, and twisted through 180 degrees without fracture. Two breaks had occurred in the pipeline during the flood, both at places where it was carried over creeks on concrete road bridges. These bridges had been undermined and swept away, carrying the pipe with them. Repairs were made {{as soon as the}} flood subsided, and the supply to Whyalla was restored within ten days.|$|E

40|$|The {{combination}} of dissimilar materials like brass {{and stainless steel}} is often needed in watch movements due to tribologic aspects. For mass production in automotive applications, a joining technique for alloyed copper with alloyed steel is needed. Laser beam micro welding offers an alternative to conventional joining techniques like press fit or soldering. Depending on the joining geometry, two different welding techniques are investigated: seam and spot welding. High strength and reproducibility are the main objective of joining dissimilar metals. Cracks and spillings {{are affected by the}} metallic continuity and should be avoided. Lap- and T-joints can be produced by the SHADOW-Welding technique. The length of the <b>continuous</b> <b>welding</b> seams are up to 15. 7 mm at a feed rate of up to 60 m/min with a pulsed laser source. The weld width attained ranges from 50 to 250 µm and a weld depth from 20 to 150 µm. This low energy joining process with minimized heat input results in low distortion of the parts joined. Applying spot welding, the pulse forming capability is needed especially for highly reflective metals like copper. The welded joints have a higher strength than the basic material...|$|E

In recent years, a tendency can be observed to switch, for NDT of the welds, from Radiography to Automated Ultrasonic Testing (AUT).

Since welding is done with high-alloyed welding consumables, resulting in the weld structure to be anisotropic and coarse grained, ultrasonic techniques using angled longitudinal waves should be used.

Laser beam micro welding offers an alternative to conventional joining techniques like press fit or soldering. The laser beam micro welding of stainless steel (X 5 CrNi 1810) to copper (CuNi 3 SiMg) and brass (CuZn 37) with a fiber-guided pulsed Nd:YAG laser is investigated.

40|$|Cold-formed steel hollow flange {{sections}} are structurally efficient {{compared to}} the conventional open channel sections. They can be of different forms including hollow flange I- and channel sections, which are generally fabricated by first cold-forming a single sheet to form the desired shape and then connecting their flange and web elements by <b>continuous</b> <b>welding.</b> Instead of welding, intermittently screw/rivet fastened or spot welded connection can also be used. A detailed investigation is currently under way on the structural performance characteristics of such intermittently screw/rivet fastened steel hollow flange sections. This paper presents the details of an experimental study performed to investigate the behaviour of built-up cold-formed steel hollow flange sections in compression, where more than 45 stub columns were tested. Both hollow flange I- and channel sections built-up using either single steel sheet or three steel elements were tested. Tests also included built-up hollow flange channel sections with stiffened web elements. Test results including the failure loads, load versus axial deformation plots and failure characteristics are presented in this paper. Test failure loads are compared with the predictions based on both effective width and direct strength methods to verify their adequacy in predicting the section compression capacity of built-up hollow flange sections. This paper has shown that although hollow flange I-sections made of three elements with a 100 mm fastener spacing can perform similar to continuously welded sections, hollow flange channel sections undergo premature failures even with a 50 mm fastener spacing, and the reasons are discussed...|$|E
40|$|The Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) {{is one of}} the {{general-purpose}} detectors to {{be provided}} for the LHC project at CERN. The design field of the CMS superconducting magnet is 4 T, the magnetic length is 12. 5 m and the free bore is 6 m. In order to withstand the electro-mechanical forces during the operation of the CMS magnet, the superconducting cable embedded in a 99. 998 % pure aluminum matrix is reinforced with two sections of aluminum alloy EN AW- 6082 assembled by continuous Electron Beam Welding (EBW). A dedicated production line has been designed by Techmeta, a leading company in the field of EBW. The production line has a total length of 70 m. Non-stop welding of each of the 20 lengths of 2. 5 km, required to build the coil, will last 22 hours. EBW is the most critical process involved in the production line. The main advantage of the EBW process is to minimize the Heat Affected Zone; this is particularly important for avoiding damage to the superconducting cable located only 4. 7 mm from the welded joints. Two welding guns of 20 kW each operate in parallel in a vacuum chamber fitted with dynamic airlocks. After welding, the conductor is continuously machined on the four faces and on each corner to obtain the required dimensions and surface finish. Special emphasis has been put on quality monitoring. All significant production parameters are recorded during operation and relevant samples are taken from each length for destructive testing purposes. In addition, a continuous phased array ultrasonic checking device is located immediately after the welding unit for the <b>continuous</b> <b>welding</b> quality control, along with a dimension laser measurement unit following the machining. 8 Refs.
