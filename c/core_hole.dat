40|$|International audienceThe {{interest}} of molecular double <b>core</b> <b>holes</b> was predicted in 1986 by Cederbaum et al who showed that their spectroscopy {{can be more}} informative {{than that of the}} single <b>core</b> <b>holes,</b> especially when the holes are located at different sites in the molecule (Cederbaum et al J. Chem. Phys. 85 (1986) 6513). Their experimental study in single photon formation had to await 2009 - 2010 with progress in synchrotron sources and development of efficient multi-electron coincidence experiments based on a magnetic bottle time of flight spectrometer. At the same time the advent of X-rays Free Electron Lasers opened the possibilty to create them in a two-photon process, and motivated new theoretical studies of their properties. We will illustrate here with a few examples, the progress done recently in the field, including formation of double <b>core</b> <b>holes</b> by double <b>core</b> photoionization, their spectroscopy and decay paths, and the related process of simultaneous core ionization and core excitation...|$|R

Non-resonant excitation occurs when the incoming radiation promotes a core electron to the continuum. When a <b>core</b> <b>hole</b> is created in this way, {{it is possible for}} it to be refilled through one of several different decay paths. Because the <b>core</b> <b>hole</b> is refilled from the sample’s high-energy free states, the decay and emission processes must be treated as separate dipole transitions. This is in contrast with RIXS, where the events are coupled, and must be treated as a single scattering process.|$|E

50|$|The {{fundamental}} phenomenon underlying XANES is {{the absorption}} of an x-ray photon by condensed matter {{with the formation of}} many body excited states characterized by a <b>core</b> <b>hole</b> in a selected atomic core level. (see the first Figure). In the single particle theory approximation, the system is separated into one electron in the core levels of the selected atomic species of the system and N-1 passive electrons. In this approximation the final state is described by a <b>core</b> <b>hole</b> in the atomic core level and an excited photoelectron. The final state has a very short life time because of the short life-time of the <b>core</b> <b>hole</b> and the short mean free path of the excited photoelectron with kinetic energy in the range around 20-50 eV. The <b>core</b> <b>hole</b> is filled either via an Auger process or by capture of an electron from another shell followed by emission of a fluorescent photon. The difference between NEXAFS and traditional photoemission experiments is that in photoemission, the initial photoelectron itself is measured, while in NEXAFS the fluorescent photon or Auger electron or an inelastically scattered photoelectron may also be measured. The distinction sounds trivial but is actually significant: in photoemission the final state of the emitted electron captured in the detector must be an extended, free-electron state. By contrast in NEXAFS the final state of the photoelectron may be a bound state such as an exciton since the photoelectron itself need not be detected. The effect of measuring fluorescent photons, Auger electrons, and directly emitted electrons is to sum over all possible final states of the photoelectrons, meaning that what NEXAFS measures is the total joint density of states of the initial core level with all final states, consistent with conservation rules. The distinction is critical because in spectroscopy final states are more susceptible to many-body effects than initial states, meaning that NEXAFS spectra are more easily calculable than photoemission spectra. Due to the summation over final states, various sum rules are helpful in the interpretation of NEXAFS spectra. When the x-ray photon energy resonantly connects a core level with a narrow final state in a solid, such as an exciton, readily identifiable characteristic peaks will appear in the spectrum. These narrow characteristic spectral peaks give the NEXAFS technique a lot of its analytical power as illustrated by the B 1s π* exciton shown in the second Figure.|$|E
40|$|Concrete {{pavements}} {{located in}} cold climates have been experiencing premature joint deterioration. Entrapment of {{moisture in the}} joints saturates the surrounding concrete, rendering it susceptible to freeze-thaw damage. To identify and to isolate the variables that might be causing this localized deterioration, concrete cores were obtained from deteriorated and non-deteriorated sections of US 35, SR 38 and SR 3 located near Indianapolis, Indiana and I- 94 (located near Michigan City, Indiana). The visual evaluation of {{the condition of the}} pavement revealed that the drainage of the joints contributes significantly to their performance. Specifically, all deteriorated joint <b>core</b> <b>holes</b> drained poorly when compared to well performing joint <b>core</b> <b>holes</b> or mid panel joint <b>core</b> <b>holes.</b> Hardened air void parameters were determined following the procedure described in ASTM C 457 and results for cores from deteriorated and non-deteriorated regions of the pavements were compared.

The holes were located from 25 ft to 115 ft from the building perimeter.

Geologic analysis and investigation of the trends of surfaces interpolated from contacts in the <b>core</b> <b>holes</b> using commercially available software helped infer minor faulting in the strata beneath the building.
