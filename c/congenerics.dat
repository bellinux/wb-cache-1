40|$|Behavioural ecology is {{rife with}} {{examples}} {{of the way in}} which prey animals make decisions to alter when, where and how they forage or reproduce in response to variation in predation risk. Given that animals cannot have perfectly accurate information regarding the relative costs and benefits of each decision made, the process of decision making is fraught with uncertainty, particularly given that different sources of information will have different levels of risk associated with them. The consequence of ignoring accurate predator information is potentially death; therefore animals should have evolved the ability to incorporate multiple sources of information, extract important components from each source and respond accordingly. In this study, the anemonefish, Amphiprion percula, responded with antipredator behaviour to damage-released chemical cues from conspecifics and <b>congenerics.</b> However, the visual cues provided by the presence or absence of conspecifics and <b>congenerics</b> dramatically influenced the way in which individuals responded to chemical indicators of risk.

40|$|This study {{developed}} niche {{models for}} the native ranges of Oreochromis andersonii, O. mortimeri, and O. mossambicus, and assessed how much of their range is climatically suitable {{for the establishment of}} O. niloticus, and then reviewed the conservation implications for indigenous <b>congenerics</b> as a result of overlap with O. niloticus based on documented congeneric interactions. The predicted potential geographical range of O. niloticus reveals a broad climatic suitability over most of southern Africa and overlaps with all the endemic <b>congenerics.</b> This is of major conservation concern because six of the eight river systems predicted to be suitable for O. niloticus have already been invaded and now support established populations. Oreochromis niloticus has been implicated in reducing the abundance of indigenous species through competitive exclusion and hybridisation.

40|$|Recent {{works have}} found the {{presence}} of native congeners to have a small effect on the naturalization rates of introduced plants, some suggesting a negative interaction (as proposed by Charles Darwin in The Origin of Species), and others a positive association. We assessed this question for a new biogeographic region, and discuss {{some of the problems}} associated with data base analyses of this type. Location Islands of the Mediterranean basin. Presence or absence of congeners was assessed for all naturalized alien plants species at regional, local and habitat scales. Using general linear models, we attempted to explain the abundance of the species (as measured by the number of islands where recorded) from their congeneric status, and assessed whether the patterns could be alternatively accounted for by a range of biological, geographical and anthropogenic factors. A simulation model was also used to investigate the impact of a simple bias on a comparable but hypothetical data set. Data base analyses addressing Darwin's hypothesis are prone to bias from a number of sources. Interaction between invaders and <b>congenerics</b> may be overestimated, as they often do not co-occur in the same habitats. Furthermore, intercorrelations between naturalization success and associated factors such as introduction frequency, which are also not independent from relatedness with the native flora, may generate an apparent influence of <b>congenerics</b> without implying a biological interaction. We detected no true influence from related natives on the successful establishment of alien species of the Mediterranean. Rarely-introduced species tended to fare better in the presence of congeners, but it appears that this effect was generated because species introduced accidentally into highly invasible agricultural and ruderal habitats have many relatives in the region, due to common evolutionary origins. Relatedness to the native flora has no more than a marginal influence on the invasion success of alien plants in the Mediterranean, although apparent trends can easily be generated through artefacts of the data base...|$|E

40|$|Island {{differentiation}} {{and relationships}} with <b>congenerics</b> were investigated in the endemic Canary Island bat Plecotus teneriffae, based onB 1 kb of mtDNA from the 16 S rRNA and cytochrome b genes. P. teneriffae had closer affinities with P. austriacus than with P. auritus. Levels of differentiation between Canary Islands were quite high relative to Pipis-trelle-like bats, consistent with philopatric behaviour in the Plecotus genus. Cladogenesis within P. teneriffae {{appears to have}} occurred after {{the emergence of the}} islands of El Hierro and La Palma during the Pleistocene. An intraspecific network shows that haplotypes from the younger islands of La Palma and El Hierro are connected to the Tenerife haplotype by a similarly large number of mutational steps. This suggests that they were both colonised at a similar time from the much older island of Tenerife. The other Plecotine bat species, Barbastellus barbastellus shows close affinities with B. barbastellus from mainland Spain, with levels of mtDNA divergence being comparable with intraspecific variation within other mammal species...|$|E
40|$|Background: Mass mortalities {{of marine}} mammals due to {{infectious}} agents are increasingly reported. However, {{in contrast to}} previous die-offs, which were indiscriminate with respect to sex and age, here we report a land-based mass mortality of Subantarctic fur seals with apparent exclusivity to adult males. An infectious agent with a male-predilection is the most plausible explanation for this die-off. Although pathogens with gender-biased transmission and pathologies are unusual, rodents are known sources of male-biased infectious agents and the invasive Mus musculus house mouse, occurs in seal rookeries. Methodology / Principal Findings: Molecular screening for male-biased pathogens in this potential rodent reservoir host revealed the absence of Cardiovirus and Leptospirosis genomes in heart and kidney samples, respectively, but identified a novel Streptococcus species with 30 % prevalence in mouse kidneys.

40|$|Abstract Guidelines for {{visitors}} to sub-Antarctic Marion Island recommend 15 and 100 m minimum approach distances for breeding Northern (Macronectes halli) and Southern (Macronectes giganteus) Giant Petrels, respectively. Using artificial eggs containing FM trans-mitters, we measured the heart rate responses of incu-bating Northern Giant Petrels to pedestrian approaches. The mean resting heart rate was 80 beats per minute. Heart rates increased upon the detection of a person approximately 40 m away, and continued to increase during the approach to 5 m. Maximum increases over resting heart rate in response to natural disturbances and human approach were 97 and 204 %, respectively. Northern Giant Petrels appear at least as sensitive to human disturbance as their <b>congenerics.</b> While low-key disturbance is unlikely to affect this solitary breeder as severely as it would the colonial Southern Giant Petrel, improved protection from disturbance could be achieved by restricting human passage through breeding colonies of Northern Giant Petrels to defined paths...|$|E
40|$|Green—brown colour {{polymorphism}} {{is common}} in the genus Acrida (Rowell 1971), and in the Australian species A. conica green and brown morphs occur sympatrically. Nymphs show significant associations between morph and sex, more female grasshoppers being green. This association occurs less frequently in adults (Garlinge et al. 1991). Acrida conica can also change colour at a moult depending on stimuli in its microhabitat (M. C. Calver, unpublished data), as can some <b>congenerics</b> (Rowell 1971). Here, we test the hypothesis of Garlinge et al (1991) that the sex—morph association is caused by microhabitat selection by the sexes. if this were so, females would select green grass whose microenvironment would cause them to moult into the green morph, while males would choose brown backgrounds, ultimately leading to brown grasshoppers.

40|$|The {{ecological}} {{importance of}} islet endemics {{are in the}} front line of conservation efforts and thus the good knowledge of their biology is required. Podarcis levendis is a lacertid lizard, endemic to two rocky islets in the Cretan Sea, Greece, that was raised to specific level in 2008 and since then no data on its biology are available. Here we present the first ecological information on the species, focusing on population density, tail autotomy and feeding preferences. We recorded regenerated and damaged tails in the field and estimated population density with the transect method. We also dissected museum specimens and analyzed their stomach content. Regenerated tails were common and reached a considerable 71 %. The latter finding could be attributed to the intense intraspecific competition due to high population density but also to the seasonal predation pressure by migratory birds.

However, the species of Daemonorops are highly variable and homoplasious in their morphological characters. Indian Daemonorops has six species, of which five distributed in Andaman group of islands and one in Indo-China.

40|$|The biogeographic and phylogenetic {{relationships}} of {{six of the}} eight Australian genera of freshwater shrimp from the family Atyidae were investigated using mitochondrial 16 S rDNA and cytochrome oxidase I sequences. Previous studies {{on two of the}} epigean genera (Caridina, Paratya) indicate that Australian species have strong links to <b>congenerics</b> from outside, with Australian members of Paratya being monophyletic and Caridina polyphyletic. The present study found that the endemic Australian epigean genus Australatya forms a strong clade with Pacific 'Atya-like' genera (Atyoida, Atyopsis), and that the endemic Australian epigean genus Caridinides falls within a clade containing Caridina species from the Australian 'indistincta' group. The two hypogean genera included in this study (Parisia, Pycnisia) form a strong clade in all analyses, implying an Australian subterranean speciation. The possibility of a relationship between Parisia/Pycnisia and an Australian Caridina species may have implications for the monophyly of the highly disjunct genus Parisia (Australia, Madagascar, Philippines).

We tested for convergence in nest morphology and composition of birds breeding in two ecologically different locations in Canada: Churchill in northern Manitoba and Elgin in southeastern Ontario. We examined nests from four families of passerine birds (Turdidae: Turdus, Parulidae: Dendroica, Emberizidae: Passerculus and Fringillidae: Carduelis) where closely related populations or species breed in both locations. Nests of American Robins, Yellow Warblers, and Carduelis finches had heavier nest masses, and tended to have thicker nestwalls, in northern Manitoba compared with conspecifics or <b>congenerics</b> breeding in southeastern Ontario. Together, all species showed evidence for wider internal and external nest-cup diameters in northern Manitoba, while individual species showed varying patterns for internal nest-cup and external nest depths. American Robins, Yellow Warblers, and Carduelis finches in northern Manitoba achieved heavier nest masses in different ways. American Robins increased all materials in similar proportions, and Yellow Warblers and Common Redpolls used greater amounts of select materials. While changes in nest composition vary uniquely for each species, the pattern of larger nests in northern Manitoba compared to southeastern Ontario in three of our four phylogenetically-independent comparisons suggests that birds are adapting to similar selectiv...|$|E

We explored whether improved food acquisition, through {{social learning}}, is a potential advantage of mixed-species troop formation by allowing a pair of naive observers to watch a pair of trained demonstrators complete a novel foraging task. The aims {{of the study were}} (a) to determine if individuals succeeded at the task more quickly after having observed demonstrators, (b) to investigate whether speed of acquisition differed after observation of conspecific demonstrators as opposed to congeneric demonstrators, and (c) to compare performance between species. The number of trials taken by observers to succeed on the task was compared with that taken by naive demonstrators to succeed on the task initially. Individuals succeeded on the task more quickly if they had had the opportunity to watch demonstrators perform the task, regardless of whether the demonstrator was a conspecific or congeneric. There was no difference in performance between species. It is concluded that, for both species, the learning of a new foraging technique is facilitated by the presence of both conspecifics and <b>congenerics</b> and that the likely mechanism for this facilitation is a combination of stimulus enhancement and response facilitation.

We used a multi-species transplant experiment to investigate the potential effects of a warmer climate on insect community composition and structure. Eight native Australian plant species were transplanted into sites approximately 2. 5 °C (mean annual temperature) warmer than their native range. Subsequent insect colonisation was monitored for 12 months. We compared the insect communities on transplanted host plants at the warmer sites with control plants transplanted within the species' native range. Comparisons of the insect communities were also made among transplanted plants at warmer sites and congeneric plant species native to the warmer transplant area. We found that the morphospecies composition of the colonising Coleoptera and Hemiptera communities differed markedly between transplants at the control compared to the warmer sites. Community structure, as described by the distribution of feeding guilds, was also found to be different between the controls and transplants when the entire Coleoptera and Hemiptera community, including non-herbivore feeding guilds, was considered. However, {{the structure of the}} herbivorous insect community showed a higher level of consistency between plants at control and warm sites. There were marked differences in community composition and feeding guild structure, for both herbivores and non-herbivores, between transplants and <b>congenerics</b> at the warm sites.
