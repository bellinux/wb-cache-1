40|$|AbstractWorking {{conditions}} of <b>casing</b> <b>pipes</b> in drilling rigs can significantly influence the initiation {{and development of}} damage in the material, and therefore also the safe service of the entire system. In this work, an integrity assessment of a steel pipe with initial defect (machined surface crack) is presented. The position of this defect is on the external surface; unlike transport pipes, where internal surface is often endangered due to the contact with the fluid, <b>casing</b> <b>pipes</b> are often exposed to damages at the external surface. Analyzed crack is in axial direction, bearing in mind {{that this type of}} defect most significantly decreases the load carrying capacity of the cylindrical pressurized components. A pipe segment exposed to internal pressure is analyzed experimentally and numerically, using the finite element method. The experimental setup included the tracking of crack mouth opening displacement (CMOD) values, as well as J integral, which is determined by application of direct measurement. Criteria for pipe failure are determined on finite element models of the pipe; fracture initiation and plastic collapse are considered as failure mechanisms. The size of the crack is varied in the finite element models; several 3 D models with different crack sizes (length and depth) are evaluated. Dependence of maximum internal pressure on the defect size is obtained. 2 D plane strain models are also examined, with an aim to determine the applicability limits of this simplified approach. Based on the obtained results, integrity assessment criteria for the analyzed geometries are discussed...|$|E

30|$|The {{ultrasonic}} {{pulse echo}} method {{is one of}} the primary methods for detection of important parameters outside the well casings (Ellis and Singer 2007). The radial measurement technique of this method reduces the effect of the microannulus (Guo et al. 2009) outside the <b>casing</b> <b>pipe</b> and is much less sensitive to tool centralization (Tubman et al. 1984). However, the method has some inherent measurement problems. Numerous studies have tried to eliminate several of these problems. Albert et al. (1988) analyzed the ability of cement bond logs (CBL), ratio bond tool (RBT), and pulse echo tool (PET) logs to detect channels in the casing circumference using a physical model. Pialucha and Cawley (1994) studied the relationship of impedances, layer thickness, and wavelength of the ultrasonic waves employed. Yao et al. (2002, 2005) carried out a quantitative inversion of the wave impedance and the thickness of the media outside the <b>casing</b> <b>pipe</b> with a composite reflection coefficient.

Yuhuan et al. (2014) analyzed the effect of microannulus size on sonic wave propagation. The studies described above revealed the existence of a complex multi-peak-search problem in thickness determination. The above methods overcome this problem by transformations of the objective function. However, the accuracy of the determination methods depends on accurate parameter estimation (e.g., the thickness of the <b>casing</b> <b>pipe).</b> In practice, it is difficult to measure or estimate these parameters accurately.|$|R

These difficulties are particularly acute in two geological regions: One is the deep hot downhole area ({approx} 1700 m depth at temperatures of {approx} 320 C) that contains hyper saline water with high concentrations of CO{sub 2 } (> 40, 000 ppm) in conjunction with {approx} 100 ppm H{sub 2 }S at a mild acid of pH {approx} 5. 0; {{the other is the}} upper well region between the well's surface and {approx} 1000 m depth at temperatures up to 200 C. The specific environment of the latter region is characterized by highly concentrated H{sub 2 }SO{sub 4 } (pH < 1. 5) brine containing at least 5000 ppm CO{sub 2 }. When these conventional cements are emplaced in these harsh environments, their major shortcoming is their susceptibility to reactions with hot CO{sub 2 } and H{sub 2 }SO 4, thereby causing their deterioration brought about by CO{sub 2 }-catalyzed carbonation and acid-initiated erosion. Such degradation not only reduced rapidly the strength of cements, lowering the mechanical support of <b>casing</b> <b>pipes,</b> but also increased the extent of permeability of the brine through the cement layer, promoting the rate of the pipe's corrosion. Severely carbonated and acid eroded cements often impaired the integrity of a well in less than one year; in the worst cases, casings have collapsed within three months, leading to the need for costly and time-consuming repairs or redrilling operations. These were the reasons why the geothermal well drilling and cementing industries were concerned about using conventional well cements, and further their deterioration was a major impediment in expediting the development of geothermal energy resources...|$|E

40|$|The fault {{detection}} and diagnosis of oil field pipes {{are very important}} to the petroleum companies, as if known, the fault of steel products can be detected based on the eddy current technique. The depth of a defect on an oil field pipe will determine the change in amplitude and phase of the detected signal. However, this signal is also affected by electromagnetic parameters {{in the vicinity of the}} fault. It is impossible, therefore, to accurately interpret the severity of the fault from a detected signal, without the knowledge of electromagnetic parameters. A system which can automatically measure electromagnetic parameters of oil field pipes has been developed, so that the correct interpretation of a pipe defect can be provided. An electronic emulator was built for differentiating the permeability of pipes accurately. The electronic emulator takes the signal from the transmission circuit, and converts it to the compensation signal with a certain amplitude and phase shift according to presettings. The combined received signal and compensation signal are conditioned and compared with the transmitted signal to give the expanded phase shift signal at the output. To stand the rigorous working condition in the underground pipes, the system is made capable of working at high temperature. Also taken into account is the variation of the internal diameter and the wall thickness of <b>casing</b> <b>pipes,</b> which affect the measurement of electromagnetic parameters.

A phased arc array transmitter, which is a novel transducer that differs from monopole and dipole transducers, is presented in this study. To simulate the acoustic field generated by a phased arc array in a fluid-filled cased borehole with different channelings, a 3 D finite-difference time-domain method is adopted. The acoustic field generated by a traditional monopole source is also simulated and compared with the field generated by the phased arc array transmitter. Numerical simulation results show that the phased arc array radiates energy directionally in a narrow angular range in the borehole, thereby compressing the acoustic energy into a narrow range in the <b>casing</b> <b>pipe,</b> the cement, and the formation.

30|$|The liquid layer {{outside a}} well casing {{develops}} from flaws along the cement–casing interface, {{which have been}} identified as leakage pathways in wellbores. The thickness of the liquid layer is one of the important parameters for determining cement bond quality. However, it is difficult to accurately determine the thickness of the liquid layer outside a well <b>casing</b> <b>pipe</b> with the traditional ultrasonic pulse echo method. To address this problem, we propose a novel inversion method for determining the thickness of the liquid layer between the casing and the cement sheath. According to test specimens, multi-layered structures are modeled to determine the overall reflected wave at the mud–casing interface. An improved particle swarm optimization algorithm is used to simultaneously inverse the thicknesses of the liquid layer, the casing, and the annular space between the casing and formation. Using synthetic data, this algorithm is more robust and stable when compared with standard particle swarm optimization inversion procedures. In addition, the influences of noise in the reflected wave and deviations of medium parameters on the inversion results of the liquid layer thickness are discussed. Finally, the method was used to determine the thicknesses of the liquid layer in test specimens. Numerical and experimental results demonstrate that the improved particle swarm optimization algorithm provides an effective approach to accurately determine the thickness of the liquid layer outside a well <b>casing</b> <b>pipe.</b>|$|R
