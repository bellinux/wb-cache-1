This project evaluated {{energy conservation}} projects related to compressors, boilers, and reducing heating and cooling loads, through monitoring at six industrial facilities and in on-campus facilities;As predicted by theory, lowering the exit pressure from the air compressor resulted in lower power consumption for positive displacement compressors. For the screw compressor studied, the isentropic compression model does a good job of predicting the savings due to a decreased compressor exit pressure. For the evaluated reciprocating compressor, the isentropic compression model overpredicted the savings unless the model was modified to account for the effects of clearance;Literature predicts that lowering the compressor inlet air temperature will decrease the power consumption. Contrary to what is in the literature, data and theoretical analysis show that it is not power consumption that decreased by lowering the intake temperature, but the compressor run time. Due to the fact that it is the run time, and not the power consumption that is decreased, energy will be saved by using outside air for <b>compressor</b> <b>intakes</b> only if the compressor cycles;Theory states that as the combustion efficiency increases, the fuel usage of a boiler will decrease. Due to measurement uncertainty, the calculated energy savings can be exceeded by its uncertainty. As long as a boiler is operating within suggested ranges, efforts should be made to decrease the steam generation rate. This project also provides data showing that contrary to common practice, it may not be appropriate to approximate boiler efficiency using combustion efficiency;This project evaluated a system designed to reduce cooling loads, and one designed to reduce heating loads. Due to poor design, these systems did not save as much energy as expected.

40|$|Pressure wave {{compressor}} {{is one of}} {{the efficient}} compressors that can supercharge internal combustion engines.

For a certain type of compressor, the value of the supercharging pressure varies with the value of exhaust gas pressure and with the driving speed of the compressor. Currently, the pressure wave compressor is driven by the crankshaft. However, this solution limits the efficiency of the compressor because the driving speed depends only on the speed of the engine and not on its load.

40|$|The {{evaporative}} {{gas turbine}} (EvGT), {{also known as}} the humid air turbine (HAT) cycle, is a novel advanced gas turbine cycle that has attracted considerable interest for the last decade. This high-efficiency cycle shows the potential to be competitive with Diesel engines or combined cycles in small and intermediate scale plants for power production and/or cogeneration. A 0. 6 MW natural gas-fired EvGT pilot plant has been constructed by a Swedish national research group in cooperation between universities and industry. The plant is located at the Lund Institute of Technology, Lund, Sweden. The pilot plant uses a humidification tower with metallic packing in which heated water from the flue gas economizer is brought into direct counter current contact with the pressurized air from the compressor This gives an efficient heat recovery and thereby a thermodynamically sound cycle. As the hot sections in high-temperature gas turbines are sensitive to particles and alkali compounds, water quality issues need to be carefully considered. As such, apart from evaluating the thermodynamic and part-load performance characteristics of the plant, and verifying the operation of the high-pressure humidifier, much attention is focused on the water chemistry issues associated with the recovery and reuse of condensate water from the flue gas. A water treatment system has been designed and integrated into the pilot plant. This paper presents the first water quality results from the plant. The experimental results show that the condensate contains low levels of alkali and calcium, around 2 mg/l Sigma(K,Na,Ca), probably originating from the unfiltered <b>compressor</b> <b>intake,</b> About 14 mg/l NO 2 - +NO 3 - comes from condensate absorption of flue gas NOx.

40|$|Many {{aircraft}} employ ducts with centerline curvature {{or changing}} cross-sectional shape {{to join the}} engine with inlet and exhaust components. S-ducts convey air to the engine <b>compressor</b> from the <b>intake</b> and often decelerate the flow to achieve an acceptable Mach number at the engine compressor by increasing the cross-sectional area downstream. Circular-to-rectangular transition ducts are used on aircraft with rectangular exhaust nozzles to connect the engine and nozzle. To achieve maximum engine performance, the ducts should minimize flow total pressure loss and total pressure distortion at the duct exit. Changes in the curvature of the duct centerline or the duct cross-sectional shape give rise to streamline curvature which causes cross stream pressure gradients. Secondary flows {{can be caused by}} deflection of the transverse vorticity component of the boundary layer. This vortex tilting results in counter-rotating vortices. Additionally, the adverse streamwise pressure gradient caused by increasing cross-sectional area can lead to flow separation. Vortex pairs have been observed in the exit planes of both duct types. These vortices are due to secondary flows induced by pressure gradients resulting from streamline curvature. Regions of low total pressure are produced when the vortices convect boundary layer fluid into the main flow. The {{purpose of the present study}} is to predict the measured flow field in a diffusing S-duct and a circular-to-rectangular transition duct with a full Navier-Stokes computer program, PARC 3 D, and to compare the numerical predictions with new detailed experimental measurements. The work was undertaken to extend previous studies and to provide additional CFD validation data needed to help model flows with strong secondary flow and boundary layer separation. The S-duct computation extends the study of Smith et al, and Harloff et al, which concluded that the computation might be improved by using a finer grid and more advanced turbulence models. The present study compares results for both the Baldwin-Lomas and k-epsilon turbulence models and is conducted with a refined grid. For the transition duct, two inlet conditions were considered, the first with straight flow and the second with swirling flow. The first case permits examination of the effects of the geometric transition on the flow field, while the second case includes the rotational flow effect characteristic of a gas turbine engine...|$|R
40|$|One {{dimensional}} wave-action engine {{models have}} become an essential tool within engine development including stages of component selection, understanding system interactions and control strategy development. Simple turbocharger models {{are seen as a}} weak link in the accuracy of these simulation tools and advanced models have been proposed to account for phenomena including heat transfer. In order to run within a full engine code, these models are necessarily simple in structure yet are required to describe a highly complex 3 D problem. This paper aims to assess the validity of one of the key assumptions in simple heat transfer models, namely, that the heat transfer between the <b>compressor</b> casing and <b>intake</b> air occurs only after the compression process. Initially a sensitivity study was conducted on a simple lumped capacity thermal model or a turbocharger. A new partition parameter was introduced alpha, which divides the internal wetted area of the compressor housing into pre and post compression. The sensitivity of heat fluxes to alpha was quantified with respect to the sensitivity to turbine inlet temperature (TIT). At low speeds, the TIT was the dominant effect on compressor efficiency whereas at high speed alpha had a similar influence to TIT. However, modelling of the conduction within the compressor housing using an additional thermal resistance caused changes in heat flows of less than 10 %. Three dimensional CFD analysis was undertaken using a number of cases approximating different values of alpha. It was seen that when considering a case similar to alpha= 0, significant temperature could build up in the impeller area of the compressor housing, indicating the importance of the pre-compression heat path. The 3 D simulation was used to estimate a realistic value for alpha which was suggested to be between 0. 15 and 0. 3. Using a value of this magnitude in the lumped capacitance model showed that at low speed there would be less than 1 % point effect on apparent efficiency which would be negligible compared to the 8 % point seen as a result of TIT. In contrast, at high speeds, the impact of alpha was similar to that of TIT, both leading to approximately 1 % point apparent efficiency error...|$|R
40|$|Water Droplet Erosion (WDE) is a {{mechanical}} degradation {{which is of}} great concern to power generation and aerospace industries, where water droplets interact with high-speed moving components. It is observed on multiple components of airplanes when flying in the rain, on steam turbine blades, and gas turbine compressor blades which {{is the focus of}} this study. Compressor blades in gas turbines suffer from WDE due to the recently implemented technology Inlet Fog Cooling. It is utilized to boost gas turbine efficiency in high ambient temperatures via the spraying of micro-sized water droplets into the intake air. Evaporation of water droplets cools the intake charge and increases the air density. The main drawback of inlet cooling is that part of the water droplets are carried into the <b>compressor</b> by <b>intake</b> air flow, which is called overspray. Repetitive impact between rotating blades and water droplets leads to WDE damage, which is a major problem. This study attempted to improve WDE resistance of compressor blades made of Ti 6 Al 4 V. Two different approaches were considered: Studying WDE of TiAl alloy as a potential erosion resistant material for turbine blades and Surface engineering of Ti 6 Al 4 V via gas nitriding and HVOF spraying of WC-Co. To investigate WDE in this work, erosion experiments were carried out using the state-of-art WDE rig available at Thermodynamics of Materials Group (TMG), Concordia University. It enables control of erosion conditions such as impact velocity, impact angle, droplet size, and droplet impingement number. In the first stage of this study, WDE of nearly fully lamellar TiAl alloy was directly compared to Ti 6 Al 4 V at relatively wide ranges of impact speed (i. e. 275 m/s, 300 m/s, 325 m/s and 350 m/s) and droplet size (i. e. 464 µm and 603 µm). TiAl demonstrated superior erosion performance (i. e. longer incubation period and slower material loss) compared with Ti 6 Al 4 V at all tested conditions. Herein, the relation of impact velocity and maximum erosion rates for TiAl and Ti 6 Al 4 V alloys was established and the damage threshold speeds of TiAl were determined. Afterwards, the erosion behaviour of TiAl was related to its mechanical properties and irregular microstructure. Lastly, in-depth investigation was carried out to reveal erosion damage mechanism of TiAl at different stages including incubation, material loss initiation, maximum erosion rate, and advanced stages. In the second stage of this study, the influence of gas nitriding on water droplet erosion behaviour of Ti 6 Al 4 V was investigated. Ti 6 Al 4 V coupons were nitrided at two different temperatures (i. e. 900 and 1050 °C) for 5 and 10 hours and the nitrided coupons were characterized. Their erosion behaviour in comparison with as-received and annealed Ti 6 Al 4 V was examined at two impact speeds (i. e. 300 m/s and 350 m/s). Mechanical properties, erosion performance and damage mechanism of treated Ti 6 Al 4 V were significantly influenced by the nitriding temperature. Exploring the potential of HVOF spray WC-Co coating to combat WDE was the last part of this study. Erosion performance of two WC-Co coatings was examined at 250 m/s, 300 m/s and 350 m/s impact speeds in comparison with Ti 6 Al 4 V. The as-sprayed coating did not show notable WDE protection; however, removing its top layers and smoothing its surface notably improved the erosion performance...|$|R
