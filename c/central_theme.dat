5|$|A Momentary Lapse of Reason was {{recorded}} primarily on Gilmour's converted houseboat, Astoria. Its production {{was marked by}} an ongoing legal dispute with Waters as to who owned the rights to Pink Floyd's name, an issue resolved several months after the album was released. Unlike many of Pink Floyd's studio albums, A Momentary Lapse of Reason has no <b>central</b> <b>theme</b> and is instead a collection of songs written by Gilmour, sometimes with outside songwriters.|$|E

5|$|A <b>central</b> <b>theme</b> of President Obama's {{inaugural address}} {{was a call}} to restore responsibility—both in terms of {{accountability}} in Washington and the responsibility of ordinary people to get involved. Obama's address did not have memorable sound bite phrases. Instead, he used traditional references to connect his new administration with the nation's history in a speech that was understated deliberately, according to rhetoric expert James Mackin.|$|E
5|$|A {{significant}} portion of Bengali devotional music features Kāli as its <b>central</b> <b>theme</b> and is known as Shyama Sangeet ("Music of the Night").

5|$|Each {{show is a}} {{synthesis}} of circus styles from around the world, with its own <b>central</b> <b>theme</b> and storyline. Shows employ continuous live music, with performers rather than stagehands changing the props. After financial successes and failures in the late 1980s, Nouvelle Expérience was created – with the direction of Franco Dragone – which not only made Cirque du Soleil profitable by 1990, but allowed it to create new shows.|$|E

5|$|Hoffman {{notes that}} A Free Ride {{contains}} many fundamental constituents {{which are the}} characteristics of an archetypal pornographic film. He identifies these basic constituents as a carefully planned but not complicated state of affairs to provide introductory motivation, visual stimuli to sexually excite the women, a theme that is generally rare in reality, a straightforward and very quick seduction, and the sex acts as the film's <b>central</b> <b>theme.</b>|$|E
5|$|A <b>central</b> <b>theme</b> {{throughout}} Symeon's {{teachings and}} writings {{is that all}} Christians should aspire to have actual direct experience of God in deep contemplation, or theoria. Regarding his own mystical experiences, he presented them not as unique to himself, but as the norm for all Christians. He taught that the experience came after purification through prayer, repentance, and asceticism. He especially called on his monks {{to take on the}} traditional charismatic and prophetic role in the Church.|$|E
5|$|Although the story's <b>central</b> <b>theme</b> is loneliness, it uses {{shoes and}} rain as motifs, along with Man'yōshū poetry and the Japanese garden {{in which it}} is set. Although rain is {{typically}} seen as sad and gloomy, in The Garden of Words it makes the world more vivid and protects the two main characters from the reality of their lives and the limitations imposed by society. Shinkai also noted a parallel between love and rain—that neither can be controlled or stopped.|$|E

Here, the marriage of Aravan and Mohini, Krishna's female form, and her widowhood and mourning, after Aravan's sacrifice, forms the <b>central</b> <b>theme</b> of an 18-day annual festival either side of the night of the full moon in the Tamil month of Cittirai (April–May). The day of the full moon is the central day of the festival, when Aravan's sacrifice is ritually re-enacted.|$|E
5|$|Julianna Helt {{from the}} Pittsburgh Post-Gazette found that time travel forms a <b>central</b> <b>theme</b> as Miranda {{constantly}} wonders how time travel could be possible. In When You Reach Me, Marcus helps Miranda {{realize that the}} three old ladies from A Wrinkle in Time lied to Meg by promising they would return five minutes before they left. Marcus explains:"So the garden is where they appear when they get {{home at the end}} of the book. Remember? They land in the broccoli. So if they had gotten home five minutes before they left, like those ladies promised they would, then they would have seen themselves get back. Before they did".|$|E
5|$|Le Guin's {{interest}} in Taoism influenced {{much of her}} science fiction work. According to Douglas Barbour, the fiction of the Hainish Universe (the setting for several of Le Guin's works) contain a theme of balance between light and darkness, a <b>central</b> <b>theme</b> of Taoism. She was also influenced by her early {{interest in}} mythology, and her exposure to cultural diversity as a child. Her protagonists are frequently interested in the cultures they are investigating, and are motivated to preserve them rather than conquer them. Authors who influenced Le Guin include Victor Hugo, Leo Tolstoy, Virginia Woolf, Italo Calvino, and Lao Tzu.|$|E

5|$|Sir Charles Lyell (1797–1875) {{was also}} from Angus and his Principles of Geology built on Hutton's ideas. Lyell's theory of uniformitarianism and his {{interpretation}} of geologic change as the steady accumulation of minute changes over enormously long spans of time was a <b>central</b> <b>theme</b> in the Principles, and a powerful influence on the young Charles Darwin. (Robert FitzRoy, captain of HMS Beagle, loaned Darwin a copy of Volume 1 of the first edition just before they {{set out on the}} 'Voyage of the Beagle'.) Lyell is buried in Westminster Abbey.|$|E
5|$|The episode {{takes place}} in the year 4126 on the Ood-Sphere, the titular planet of the episode.

When they find a group of unprocessed Ood, they become horrified at the alterations performed and resolve to free the Ood. The episode was well-received for its <b>central</b> <b>theme</b> of slavery.|$|E

5|$|The novel's <b>central</b> <b>theme</b> {{involves}} {{the examination of}} the human desire to detect patterns or meaning and the risks of finding patterns in meaningless data. Other themes include methods of interpretation of history, cultural familiarity with brand names, and tensions between art and commercialization. The September 11, 2001 attacks are used as a motif representing the transition to the new century. Critics identify influences in Pattern Recognition from Thomas Pynchon's postmodern detective story The Crying of Lot 49.|$|E
5|$|The {{video was}} {{uploaded}} to MTV's website on August 9, 2004. The video reached number five on the AOL Music Top Video chart in September 2004, with 740,176 streams.

She also lauded {{the director of the}} video, Dave Meyers, for his ability to use Clarkson's evolution as an element to overshadow the distracting clips from The Princess Diaries: Royal Engagement despite noticing that the use of visual metaphors in the music video was overwrought.|$|E
5|$|Though {{the writing}} of vachana poems went into decline after {{the passing of the}} Basavanna era in the late 12th century, latter day vachanakaras such as Tontada Siddhesavara (or Siddhalinga Yati), a noted Shaiva saint and guru of King Virupaksha RayaII, started a revival. He wrote Shatsthala Jnanamrita (1540), a {{collection}} of 700 poems. In 1560, Virakta Tontadarya made the life of Tontada Siddhesavara the <b>central</b> <b>theme</b> in his writing Siddhesvara Purana. Virakta Tontadarya, Gummalapura Siddhalinga, Swatantra Siddhalingeshwara (1560) and Ghanalingideva (1560) are some well-known vachana poets who tried to recreate the glory days of the early poets, though the socio-political expediency did not exist.|$|E
