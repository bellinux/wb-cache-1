40|$|Access to Continuing Education {{is largely}} {{confined}} to a small section of the adult population. <b>Clientele</b> <b>analysis</b> of Continuing Education institutions throughout the world have shown participants in Continuing Education to be consistently similar {{in terms of their}} social and demographic characteristics. Most participants are already advantaged in terms of their life-style - a narrow 'creme de la creme' sector of the population. Few Continuing Education institutions have set out to cater for the educational needs of all persons in an area - including the disadvantaged. This thesis presents the findings of a clientele survey of the Hawkes Bay Community College. From the beginning, College administrators were committed to catering for all groups within the Hawkes Bay population. This study analyses the characteristics of all persons attending College programmes in September 1978 and assesses their representativeness of the region's population. In brief, it describes the social and demographic characteristics of persons for whom the College provided access to Continuing Education. A self-administering questionnaire was completed by 1849 College clients and the results were compiled using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences on a Burroughs 6700. Questionnaire items covered the respondent's age, sex, ethnicity, marital status, place of residence, occupation, income, present and past education. Analysis of the participants in terms of these factors shows that the College has succeeded in attracting a number of persons from groups which have previously been under-represented in Continuing Education. Increased rates of participation are found among members of ethnic minorities, persons with low-status occupations and persons with low levels of educational attainment and consumption. Within the College itself, the Community Education department attracts a more heterogeneous clientele than the Vocational Education department. Much of the latter group's homogeneity stems from its youthful age structure. Most prominent among non participants at the College are older men, older members of ethnic minorities, semi - and unskilled workers and residents of small towns and rural areas. Although the College has been successful in attracting numbers of people from groups not usually involved in Continuing Education, these groups are still under-represented at the College on a proportional basis. The College clientele is still dominated overall by groups who have always had high participation rates in Continuing Education. The Hawkes Bay Community College has, however, been successful in making headway towards opening up access to Continuing Education for all groups, including the disadvantaged...|$|E

40|$|This article {{deals with}} the results {{obtained}} from 1995 to 1997 by an innovative occupational rehabilitation model for individuals with repetitive strain injury/work related musculoskeletal disorder (RSI/WRMD), developed by the Campinas Occupational Rehabilitation Center under the Brazilian National Institute for Social Security. The study had two objectives: 1) to reconstruct the program as a precondition for evaluation and 2) to evaluate the model's effectiveness in reestablishing the autonomy of individuals with RSI/WRMD. The methodology involved document analysis in order to reconstruct the program's background in terms of problem identification, organizational participation, awareness-raising, staff characteristics and responsibilities, and profile of the <b>clientele.</b> An <b>analysis</b> of 221 patient files {{provided the basis for}} constructing an evaluative instrument consisting of different dimensions, variables, and indicators, which was applied to a sample of 47 patient histories prior and subsequent to rehabilitative intervention. High effectiveness was observed in the model, with variations in the different target dimensions...|$|R
40|$|This is {{the author}} {{accepted}} manuscript. The final version is available from Tourism Economics via [URL] many other small-island tourism destinations, Madeira faces considerable challenges due to its limited resources and mature markets, including decreasing daily expenditures, a dependency on repeat tourists and decreasing length of stay. Product diversification is frequently recommended as a strategic response and rural tourism as a candidate product. The efficacy of rural tourism as a strategy for increasing destination-wide tourism receipts remains, however, largely unproven. The {{purpose of this study}} is to examine the determinants of the daily expenditure of tourists staying in the rural interior of Madeira, based on quantile regression analysis. The results suggest that such tourists are rather passive, wishing mainly to rest and relax. As such, their daily expenditures are not appreciably greater than those of coastal tourists who comprise the mainstay of Madeira?s <b>clientele.</b> Quantile <b>analysis</b> nevertheless provides some useful insights for developing strategies to increase their spending, including family groups and first-time tourists. authorsversionPeer reviewe...|$|R

Given the {{historical}} foundation of residency within social work {{it is important}} for social workers to reconsider how residency may be a benefit to community development practice. This qualitative study explores community developers who intentionally moved into the communities in which they work. The study seeks to find these community developer???s motivations for moving into their community as well as the perceived the benefits for their <b>clientele.</b> Content <b>analysis</b> using latent and manifest coding was used. The respondents were 10 self-identified community developers and intentional residents. Three themes emerged: 1) Resident community developers felt an increased awareness of the strengths and challenges within their respective communities; 2) Resident community developers were motivated by a spiritual belief or a moral imperative; 3) Resident community developers struggled to balance their concerns of safety with their moral obligation to social justice. Implications for social work practice and policy are discussed. Social Wor...|$|R
40|$|The {{research}} {{established a}} baseline {{data of the}} instructor-related problems of junior teacher education students to call {{the attention of the}} administration to study and design plan on how to address the issues. Descriptive survey method through researcher-made instrument was applied. Total enumeration of subjects was observed. The problems were favoritism, not teaching, giving exam/quiz beyond what he has taught, more on self-study than actual teaching, absenteeism and tardiness, poor knowledge on the subject, majority of the time is reporting, giving many activities in place of teaching the lesson, no clear records of grade, projects outside the scope of the subject, and collecting money in place of a project/grade. Problems vary from subject to subject although some subjects appear to have more problems than the others. Likewise, some problems were unique to certain course and specialization The result implies that instructor-related problems exist which require attention and solution. And certain subjects that seemed to have many problems need immediate attention to prevent recurrence. As a whole, the result implies that indeed there were instructor-related problems to be solved to uplift the quality of education being served to its <b>clientele.</b> Hence, independent <b>analysis</b> of the identified problems should be conducted considering real root cause to avoid superficial solutions.

40|$|Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) This thesis {{investigates the}} {{changing}} nature of dividend policy, by undertaking analyses of the company, country, and time-level determinants that affect companies’ decisions to pay, initiate, and omit dividends, and the amount of dividends that are paid. The research contributes to existing literature by examining the combination of theories of dividend policy, including dividend smoothing theory, agency costs theory, signaling theory, catering theory, and tax <b>clientele</b> theory. The <b>analysis</b> is undertaken using a panel data of 66, 831 company-year observations drawn from thirty-one countries, over the period 1990 to 2010. In all stages of model estimation, a baseline model that incorporates central company characteristics, and augmented models that include additional variables that proxy for alternative theories, are specified and tested. A logit regression model is employed to examine the factors that affect companies’ decisions to pay, initiate, and omit dividends. The large and profitable companies that generate excess free cash flows, and whose shareholders are tax advantaged when receiving cash dividends are more likely to initiate and pay dividends. However, the companies with more growth options and more liquid shares are less likely to initiate and pay dividends. Mixed results are found in terms of the impact of debt on dividend payment and initiation decisions. For the majority of countries, companies’ decisions to omit dividends are only affected by profitability, available investment opportunities, and size. The impact of the Global Financial Crisis on the decision to omit dividends is persistent and robust, indicating that companies are highly likely to omit dividends if they face financial difficulties. The multi-country analysis, which is drawn from twenty-two countries over the period 1991 to 2008, reveals that companies operating under civil law regimes are more likely to initiate and pay dividends. Moreover, companies in developed markets are more likely to initiate and pay dividends compared with those in emerging markets. Of note, the degree of investor protection offered and the maturity of financial markets {{play a significant role in}} mitigating the severity of agency problems. Panel data regression analysis is undertaken to examine the company, country, and time-level determinants on the amount of dividends paid. The majority of dividends are typically paid by large, profitable companies with excess free cash flows. Conversely, companies with more available investment opportunities and more liquid shares tend to pay fewer dividends. Mixed results are found regarding the impact of debt levels on the amount of dividends paid. The results provide evidence that the presence of investor protection and the maturity of financial markets weaken the relationship between managerial ownership and the dividend payout ratio, suggesting that the degree of investor protection offered and the maturity of financial markets are a substitution mechanism for dividend payout in mitigating the severity of agency problems. Further, the joint impacts of the determinants on the amount of dividends paid are significantly different between developed and emerging markets. Specifically, companies in developed markets follow a smoother dividend policy and their payout ratios are less dependent on profitability relative to those in emerging markets. Additionally, for companies in emerging markets, there is a strong negative relationship between corporate debt levels and the dividend payout ratio. On the whole, the key factors in determining the decisions to pay or not to pay dividends and the amount of dividends paid are homogeneous across countries, namely profitability, investment opportunities, company size, capital structure, liquidity, and free cash flows. Most importantly, strong evidence is found for the dividend smoothing hypothesis, the free cash flow hypothesis of agency costs theory, the tax clientele theory, and the dividend substitution theory in explaining the decisions to pay, initiate, and omit dividends and the amount of dividends paid. However, the evidence casts doubt on dividend signaling theory and agency costs theory to the extent that they are proxied by the managerial ownership variable...|$|R
