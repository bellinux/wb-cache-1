40|$|The {{objective}} of this dissertation was to study the use of reactive extrusion for the chemical modifications of starch and cellulose. A carboxymethyl derivative of starch and carboxymethyl and acetate derivatives of cellulose were prepared using reactive extrusion. ^ <b>Carboxymethyl</b> <b>starch</b> with rapid swelling properties in water was prepared using reactive extrusion. This was achieved by controlling the gelatinization and {{through the use of}} NaOH by controlling the water/ethanol ratio. The effects of NaOH, H 2 O, temperature, ethanol, sodium mono chloro acetate, sodium tripolyphosphate, citric acid, epichlorohydrin and extruder screw configuration on the degree of substitution of <b>carboxymethyl</b> <b>starch</b> were studied. ^ The physical, chemical and morphological properties of sodium starch glycolate (cross-linked <b>carboxymethyl</b> <b>starch)</b> prepared using reactive extrusion were characterized and compared with those of VIVASTAR®P. The liquid (water and 0. 1 N HCl) uptakes by sodium starch glycolate prepared using reactive extrusion were lower than those by VIVASTAR®P. This may have been because of gelatinization of starch and insufficient cross-linking in sodium starch glycolate prepared using reactive extrusion. Carboxymethyl starches with high degrees of substitutions also were prepared using reactive extrusion. The effects of SMCA:starch ratio, aqueous ethanol:(starch+SMCA) and the extruder screw configuration on the degree of substitution and reaction efficiency were studied. ^ Further, the use of reactive extrusion for the chemical modification of a non-thermoplastic material like cellulose was demonstrated. The effects of water:ethanol ratio and amounts of NaOH used, on the degree of substitution, degree of crystallinity, cellulose-II crystalline fraction, saline uptake, saline absorption and surface morphology were studied. X-ray diffraction analysis revealed that carboxymethyl cellulose prepared using 100 % H 2 O had higher degree of crystallinty and cellulose-II crystalline fraction. Saline uptake by this carboxymethyl cellulose was comparable with that of sodium polyacrylate. ^ Acetate derivatives of cellulose also were prepared by a solvent-less reactive extrusion process with the use of iodine catalyst.

The reaction {{was carried out}} in an isopropanol-water mixture at 407 C for 3 h. The reaction parameters under investigation included water fraction in the reaction medium, the ratio of sodium hy-droxide to anhydroglucose unit (AGU) and the ratio of sodium monochloroacetate (SMCA) to AGU. The dependent responses were degree of substitution (DS) of CMS and the reaction efficiency (RE) of the carboxymethylation. <b>Carboxymethyl</b> cassava <b>starches</b> with DS in the range of 0. 01 to 0. 86 were prepared.

Response surface plots suggested that the optimal levels of sodium hydroxide and water con-tent to achieve CMS with high DS were at the intermediate values. Similar effects of sodium hydroxide and water content were also observed on the RE while SMCA content had a negative effect; increasing SMCA content resulted in lower RE.

40|$|The {{subject of}} the study was {{investigation}} of influence of substituent type on the properties of starch derivates in diluted solutions. Three samples were prepared: two anionic (<b>carboxymethyl</b> <b>starch,</b> CMS) and one cationic starch (KS). Starch derivates were synthesized in two steps. The first step was preparation of alkali starch by the addition of sodium-hydroxide to the starch dispersed in ethanol or water. In the second step, the required amount of sodium monocloracetate or 3 -chloro- 2 -hydroxypropyl-threemethylamonium chloride was added to the obtained alkali starch in order to prepare CMS or KS, respectively. The degree of substitution of <b>carboxymethyl</b> <b>starch</b> was determined by back titration method, and the degree of substitution of cationic starch was determined by potentiometric titration. The degrees of substitution of prepared samples were: 0. 50 (assigned as CMS- 0. 50) and 0. 70 (assigned as CMS- 0. 70) for <b>carboxymethyl</b> <b>starch</b> and 0. 30 (assigned as KS- 0. 30) for cationic starch. The properties of starch derivatives in dilute solutions were investigated by the methods of static and dynamic light scattering. Aqueous solutions of sodium chloride of different concentrations were used as solvent. The values of the mass average molar mass, MW, radius of gyration, Rg, and second virial coefficient, A 2, were determined for all samples together with hydrodynamic radius, Rh. Molar masses of the samples were: 5. 06 × 106, 15. 4 × 106 and 19. 2 × 106 g/mol for CMS- 0. 50, CMS- 0. 70 and KS- 0. 30, respectively. The samples, CMS- 0. 70 and KS- 0. 30 had similar molar mass and hydrodynamic radius, but radius of gyration of KS- 0. 30 was smaller then radius of gyration of CMS- 0. 70 at all sodium chloride concentrations. Consequently, ρ value for KS- 0. 30 was smaller then for CMS- 0. 70, as a result of more compact architecture of KS- 0. 30 then of CMS- 0. 70. Kratky graph confirmed this result. For all samples, radius of gyration and hydrodynamic radius decreased with increasing of sodium chloride concentration, but decrease of the radius was greater for CMS- 0. 50 then for other two samples due to its significantly lower molar mass. On the other hand, change of both radius of gyration and hydrodynamic radius of CMS- 0. 70 and of KS- 0. 30 with increasing sodium chloride concentration were similar. It can be concluded that the decrease of both Rg and Rh with increasing sodium chloride concentration in water depends far more on molar mass than on degree of substitution...|$|E

Influence of the molar ratio of SCA to the glucopyranose units (SCA/GU), reaction time, temperature {{and the amount of}} sodium hydroxide on the degree of substitution (DS) and the reaction efficiency (RE) was studied. An optimal concentration of 30 % of NaOH, for a reaction time of 1 h at 50 °C and molar ratio (SCA/GU) equal to 1. 0, yielded an optimal DS of 0. 55 and a RE of 55 %. SEM micrographs revealed that the carboxymethylation assigned the structural arrangement of CMPGS and caused the granular disintegration. Wide angle diffraction X-ray (XRD) showed that the crystallinity of starch was obviously varied after carboxymethylation. New bands in FTIR spectra at 1417 and 1603 cm− 1 indicated the presence of carboxymethyl groups. The solubility and viscosity of CMPGS increased with an increase in the degree of modification. In order to investigate the influence of DS on physical and drug release properties, CMPGS obtained with DS in the range of 0. 12 – 0. 55 was evaluated as tablet excipient for sustained drug release. Dissolution tests performed in phosphate buffer (pH 6. 8), with Ibuprofen as drug model (25 % loading) showed that CMPGS seems suitable to be used as sustained release excipient since the drug release was driven over a period up to 8 h.

The pellets contain glucose in combination with an osmotically active ingredient and are coated with an ethylcellulose dispersion, which forms an insoluble semipermeable membrane and ensures delayed release. The release of glucose was assessed using dissolution and high-performance liquid chromatography. Dissolution profiles indicated the possibility of achieving the requested lag time {{using a combination of}} adequate compositions and coating concentrations. Lag times of 60, 240 and 360 min were achieved. The sample containing <b>carboxymethyl</b> <b>starch</b> was found to be most suitable for the intent of this work...|$|E

Degree of substitution of prepared samples ranged from 0. 40 to 1. 10. The samples were investigated by static and dynamic light scattering and viscosity of diluted solution in 0. 10 M NaCl as solvent at 25 C. The values of molar mass, MW, radius of gyration, Rg, hydrodynamic radius, Rh, and limited viscosity number, [η] were determined. It {{was found that}} the samples are similar to each other regardless of the type of starch and the degree of substitution. Fractal dimension, df, was equal to 2. 380 (Rg - MW) and 2. 406 (Rη - MW), while parameter was 1. 195. The values of fractal dimension and parameter are characteristic values for the behavior of branched clusters in thermodynamically good solvents...|$|E
40|$|Our {{research}} has focused on the main design features and release performances of time-dependent colon-specific (TDCS) delivery tablets, which relies on the relative constancy that is observed in the small intestinal transit time of dosage forms. But inflammatory bowel disease&# 65288;IBD&# 65289;can affect the transit time, and usually results in watery stool. Compared to the TDCS and wax-matrix TDCS tablet, a promising time-dependent colon-specific delivery system was investigated. In our study, a suppository-base-matrix coated tablet was evaluated. Water soluble suppository-base helps the expansion of tablet, facilitates uniform film dissolution and achives high osmotic pressure. Combining the expansion of <b>carboxymethyl</b> <b>starch</b> sodium (CMS-Na) and the moisture absorption of NaCl, the coated TDCS tablet obtained a burst and targeted drug delivery system. A very good correlation between in vitro drug release and in vivo outcome was observed. This TDCS coated tablet provides a promising strategy to control drug release to the desired lower gastrointestinal region...|$|E
40|$|Xylan {{the major}} portion of the {{hemicellulose}} of plant cell walls are heterogeneous polysaccharides. Xylanases are enzymes obtained from different species of microorganisms that degrade the xylosidic linkages of xylans backbone producing xylose with other monoresidues. In this study, xylanase producing strains were isolated from intestine of a herbivorous insect at Rajshahi University Campus. The strains were isolated on xylan agar media and screened by & 946; -xylanolysis method. Zymogram analysis was confirmed the xylanolytic activity. The strains was identified to be Aeromonas sp. and xylanase enzyme was detected in the culture supernatant of the strain. Xylanase enzyme was purified from culture supernatant of Aeromonas sp. by ammonium sulfate precipitation, gel filtration on Sephadex G- 100 followed by ion exchange chromotography on DEAE-cellulose. In DEAE cellulose column chromatography, three protein peaks F- 1 a, F- 1 b and F- 1 c were appeared. Among these peaks, only F- 1 b showed xylanase activity {{and the degree of}} purification attained 64. 54 fold. The purified enzyme gave single band on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis indicating its homogeneity. The enzyme gave maximum activity against xylan as substrate at pH 7. 0 and temperature at 55 ° C. The Km value of xylanase was found to be 0. 91 % using the oat spelt xylan as substrate. The xylanase hydrolyzed strongly oat spelt xylan and birch wood xylan but didnot hydrolyze cellulose, <b>carboxymethyl</b> cellulose and <b>starch.</b> Xylose was detected as the hydrolysis products of oat spelt xylan by the xylanase...|$|R
40|$|Sheng-Mai-San is a multi-component {{traditional}} Chinese herbal preparation. Due to {{the fact}} granulated additives, such as <b>starch,</b> <b>carboxymethyl</b> cellulose, lactose and raw herbal powder may alter {{the content of the}} bioactive markers in the herbal products, a developed ultra-high performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS) method was used to measure the herbal biomarkers of ginsenoside Rb 1, Rb 2, Rc, Rd, Re, Rg 1, Rh 1, compound K, ophiopogonin D and schizandrin from the Sheng-Mai-San herbal formulation. Besides, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to observe the morphology of the herbal granular powders. Light microscopy with Congo red and iodine-KI reagent staining was used to identify the cellulose fiber and cornstarch added to pharmaceutical herbal products. The swelling power (SP), water solubility index (WSI), and crude fiber analysis were used to determine the contents of cellulose fiber and cornstarch in pharmaceutical herbal products. In this study, we developed a novel skill to assess the quantification of appended cornstarch in pharmaceutical herbal products using Aperio ImageScope software. Compared with the traditional cornstarch analysis, our analysis method is a rapid, simple and conversion process which could be applied to detect the percentage of added cornstarch in unknown powder products. The various range of the herbal content for the five pharmaceutical manufacturers varied by up to several hundreds-fold. The physical examination reveals that the morphology of the herbal pharmaceutical products is rough and irregular with sharp layers. This study provides a reference standard operating procedure guide for the quality control of the Chinese herbal pharmaceutical products of Sheng-Mai-San...|$|R
40|$|Native rhizobia {{are ideal}} for use as {{commercial}} legume inoculants. The characteristics of the carrier used to store the inoculants are important for the survival and symbiotic potential of the rhizobia. The objective {{of this study was}} to investigate the effects of peat (PEAT), perlite sugarcane bagasse (PSB), <b>carboxymethyl</b> cellulose plus <b>starch</b> (CMCS), and yeast extract mannitol supplemented with mannitol (YEMM) on the survival, nodulation potential and N 2 fixation capacity of the native strains Sinorhizobium mexicanum ITTG R 7 T and Rhizobium calliandrae LBP 2 - 1 T and of the reference strain Rhizobium etli CFN 42 T. A factorial design (4 × 3) with four repetitions was used to determine the symbiotic potential of the rhizobial strains. The survival of the strains was higher for PEAT (46 % for strain LBP 2 - 1 T, 167 % for strain CFN 42 T and 219 % for strain ITTG R 7 T) than for the other carriers after 240 days, except for CFN 42 T kept on CMCS (225 %). All the strains kept on the different carriers effectively nodulated common bean, with the lowest number of nodules found (5 nodules) when CFN 42 T was kept on CMCS and with the highest number of nodules found (28 nodules) when ITTG R 7 T was kept on PSB. The nitrogenase activity was the highest for ITTG R 7 T kept on PEAT (4911 &# 956;mol C 2 H 4 per fresh weight nodule h&# 8722; 1); however, no activity was found when the strains were kept on YEMM. Thus, the survival and symbiotic potential of the rhizobia depended on the carrier used to store them...|$|R
