5|$|By {{the early}} part of the 1960s, however, the Nashville sound had become {{perceived}} as too watered-down by many more traditionalist performers and fans, resulting in a number of local scenes like the Bakersfield sound. A few performers retained popularity, however, such as the long-standing cultural icon Johnny Cash. The Bakersfield sound began in the mid to late 1950s when performers like Wynn Stewart and Buck Owens began using elements of Western swing and rock, such as the breakbeat, in their music. In the 1960s performers like Merle Haggard popularized the sound. In the early 1970s, Haggard was also part of outlaw <b>country,</b> alongside singer-songwriters such as Willie Nelson and Waylon Jennings. Outlaw <b>country</b> was rock-oriented and lyrically focused on the criminal antics of the performers, in contrast to the clean-cut <b>country</b> singers of the Nashville sound. By the middle of the 1980s, the <b>country</b> music charts were dominated by pop singers, alongside a nascent revival of honky-tonk-style <b>country</b> with the rise of performers like Dwight Yoakam. The 1980s also saw the development of alternative <b>country</b> performers like Uncle Tupelo, who were opposed to the more pop-oriented style of mainstream <b>country.</b> At the beginning of the 2000s, rock-oriented <b>country</b> acts remained among the best-selling performers in the United States, especially Garth Brooks.|$|E

5|$|<b>Country</b> {{music is}} {{primarily}} a fusion of African American blues and spirituals with Appalachian folk music, adapted for pop audiences and popularized beginning in the 1920s. The origins of <b>country</b> are in rural Southern folk music, which was primarily Irish and British, with African and continental European musics. Anglo-Celtic tunes, dance music, and balladry were the earliest predecessors of modern <b>country,</b> then known as hillbilly music. Early hillbilly also borrowed elements of the blues and drew upon more aspects of 19th-century pop songs as hillbilly music evolved into a commercial genre eventually known as <b>country</b> and western and then simply <b>country.</b> The earliest <b>country</b> instrumentation revolved around the European-derived fiddle and the African-derived banjo, with the guitar later added. String instruments like the ukulele and steel guitar became commonplace due to the popularity of Hawaiian musical groups in the early 20th century.|$|E
