25|$|A ghost or {{floating}} <b>chainring</b> is {{an additional}} <b>chainring</b> in the drive train between the driving <b>chainring</b> and sprocket. The top of the chain moves it forward {{at the same speed}} that the bottom of the chain moves it backwards, giving the appearance that it is floating in the chain.|$|E
25|$|Some chainrings can be {{outfitted}} with a chain guard — a plastic or metal ring slightly larger in diameter than the <b>chainring.</b> Its purpose is mostly to help prevent the chain from touching or catching clothing. Chain guard is usually mounted on the outboard side of the <b>chainring</b> or, in case of multi-sprocket <b>chainring,</b> on the outboard side of the largest <b>chainring.</b> Single-sprocket chainrings may have chain guards on both inboard and outboard sides, helping keeping the chain on the chainring; this is common on multi-speed juvenile bicycles.|$|E
25|$|Chainrings {{designed}} for use with multi-chainring crank arms may have ramps or pins to aid in shifting. The middle <b>chainring,</b> {{in the case of}} a triple crankset, usually has the most shaping to aid in shifting up and down. The smallest <b>chainring</b> usually has the least, if any shaping.|$|E
25|$|Note that if {{a normal}} right-side-drive {{crankset}} is installed backwards to create a left-side-drive bicycle, the threaded pedal holes {{at the end of}} the crank arms would be reversed. In this configuration, precession may loosen the pedals over time, causing the pedals to become detached and/or damaging the pedal threading in the crank arms. A front crankset designed for tandem use is a commercially available option, since this has a <b>chainring</b> for the timing chain on the left side, though choice of <b>chainring</b> sizes may be limited.|$|E
25|$|By convention, {{the largest}} <b>chainring</b> is {{outboard}} and the smallest is inboard. Chainrings vary {{in size from}} as few as 20 teeth {{to as many as}} 60 and potentially more.|$|E
25|$|Derailleur type {{mechanisms}} {{of a typical}} mid-range product (of the sort used by serious amateurs) achieve between 88% and 99% mechanical efficiency at 100W. In derailleur mechanisms the highest efficiency is achieved by the larger sprockets. Efficiency generally decreases with smaller sprocket and <b>chainring</b> sizes.|$|E
25|$|Bicycles {{that are}} going to be used in abusive applications, such as freeride and BMX, will often {{incorporate}} a very heavy-duty chain guard that is designed to protect the chainrings from physical damage caused by impact with fixed objects; also called 'bashguards', these commonly replace a third (large) <b>chainring.</b>|$|E
25|$|Less {{common is}} the use of a double or triple <b>chainring</b> in {{conjunction}} with an internally geared hub, extending the gear range without having to fit multiple sprockets to the hub. However, this does require a chain tensioner of some sort, negating some of the advantages of hub gears.|$|E
25|$|Front/rear gear {{measurement}} uses two numbers (e.g. 53/19) {{where the}} first is the number of teeth in the front <b>chainring</b> and the second is the number of teeth in the rear sprocket. Without doing some arithmetic, it is not immediately obvious that 53/19 and 39/14 represent effectively the same gear ratio.|$|E
25|$|In the 2010 Giro d'Italia, and David Millar {{used them}} in his 2011 victory in the final TT of the 2011 Giro. Several Pro-Tour teams were using o.symmetric and Q-Rings {{elliptical}} chainrings for road racing and time trialing. In the 2013 Tour, Chris Froome drew attention with his oval <b>chainring,</b> manufactured by Osymetric.|$|E
25|$|There {{are three}} chainrings with {{half-step}} {{differences between the}} larger two and multi-range differences between the smaller two, e.g. chainrings 24-42-46 and cogset 12-14-16-18-21-24-28-32-36. This general arrangement is suitable for touring with most gear changes being made using the rear derailleur and occasional fine tuning using the two large chainrings. The small <b>chainring</b> (granny gear) is a bailout for handling steeper hills, but it requires some anticipation {{in order to use}} it effectively.|$|E
25|$|The {{combination}} of 3 chainrings and an 8-sprocket cogset does {{not result in}} 24 usable gear ratios. Instead it provides 3 overlapping ranges of 7, 8, and 7 gear ratios. The outer ranges only have 7 ratios rather than 8 because the extreme combinations (largest <b>chainring</b> to largest rear sprocket, smallest <b>chainring</b> to smallest rear sprocket) result in a very diagonal chain alignment which is inefficient and causes excessive chain wear. Due to the overlap, there will usually be some duplicates or near-duplicates, so that there might only be 16 or 18 distinct gear ratios. It may not be feasible to use these distinct ratios in strict low-high sequence anyway due to the complicated shifting patterns involved (e.g. simultaneous double or triple shift on the rear derailleur and a single shift on the front derailleur). In the worst case there could be only 10 distinct gear ratios, if the percentage step between chainrings {{is the same as}} the percentage step between sprockets. However, if the most popular ratio is duplicated then it may be feasible to extend the life of the gear set by using different versions of this popular ratio.|$|E
25|$|With a {{chain drive}} transmission, a <b>chainring</b> {{attached}} to a crank drives the chain, which in turn rotates the rear wheel via the rear sprocket(s) (cassette or freewheel). There are four gearing options: two-speed hub gear integrated with chain ring, up to 3 chain rings, up to 11 sprockets, hub gear built into rear wheel (3-speed to 14-speed). The most common options are either a rear hub or multiple chain rings combined with multiple sprockets (other combinations of options are possible but less common).|$|E
25|$|This {{configuration}} {{consists of}} a left crank arm with a spider and <b>chainring,</b> and a right crank arm without a spider, the opposite of a normal configuration. If used with a screw-on freewheel, a special hub with a left hand thread for a special freewheel must be used , which is also threaded left hand and ratchets {{the opposite direction of}} a normal freewheel. If the freewheel and hub were threaded with right hand threads, the torque applied by pedaling would loosen and unthread the freewheel from the hub.|$|E
25|$|This {{style is}} {{commonly}} found on racing bicycles with two chainrings. The relative {{step on the}} chainrings (say 35%) is typically around {{three or four times}} the relative step on the cogset (say 8% or 10%), e.g. chainrings 39-53 and close-range cogsets 12-13-14-15-16-17-19-21 or 12-13-15-17-19-21-23-25. This arrangement provides much more scope for adjusting the gear ratio to maintain a constant pedalling speed, but any change of <b>chainring</b> must be accompanied by a simultaneous change of 3 or 4 sprockets on the cogset if the goal is to switch to the next higher or lower gear ratio.|$|E
25|$|Internal gearing is {{so called}} {{because all the}} gears {{involved}} are hidden within a wheel hub. Hub gears work using internal planetary, or epicyclic, gearing which alters {{the speed of the}} hub casing and wheel relative to the speed of the drive sprocket. They have just a single <b>chainring</b> and a single rear sprocket, almost always with a straight chain path between the two. Hub gears are available with between 2 and 14 speeds; weight and price tend to increase with the number of gears. All the advertised speeds are available as distinct gear ratios controlled by a single shifter (except for some early 5-speed models which used two shifters). Hub gearing is often used for bicycles intended for city-riding and commuting.|$|E
25|$|In {{the context}} of road cycling, compact {{drivetrain}} typically refers to double cranksets with a smaller (usually 110mm) bolt circle diameter than the standard 130mm or Campagnolo's 135mm. As of 2006, {{all of the major}} component manufacturers such as Shimano and Campagnolo offer compact cranks in their midrange and high-end product lines. The compact crankset provides a compromise between the standard road double crankset (with 39/52 or 39/53 tooth chainrings) and the road triple (with 30/42/52 or 30/39/53 tooth chainrings). The compact crankset has two chainrings and typical ratios are 34/48, 34/50 and 36/50. This provides nearly the same lower gear ratios as a triple but without the need for a third <b>chainring,</b> a triple front derailleur and a long cage rear derailleur. Both Shimano and Campagnolo recommend and sell front derailleurs specifically designed for compact cranksets, claiming better shifting.|$|E
25|$|Since cyclists' {{legs are}} most {{efficient}} over {{a narrow range}} of pedaling speeds, or cadence, a variable gear ratio helps a cyclist to maintain an optimum pedalling speed while covering varied terrain. Some, mainly utility, bicycles use hub gears with between 3 and 14 ratios, but most use the generally more efficient dérailleur system, by which the chain is moved between different cogs called chainrings and sprockets in order to select a ratio. A dérailleur system normally has two dérailleurs, or mechs, one at the front to select the <b>chainring</b> and another at the back to select the sprocket. Most bikes {{have two or three}} chainrings, and from 5 to 11 sprockets on the back, with the number of theoretical gears calculated by multiplying front by back. In reality, many gears overlap or require the chain to run diagonally, so the number of usable gears is fewer.|$|E
25|$|In practice, this {{relationship}} {{can be observed}} in bicycles: Bicycles are typically composed of two road wheels, front and rear gears (referred to as sprockets) meshing with a circular chain, and a derailleur mechanism if the bicycle's transmission system allows multiple gear ratios to be used (i.e. multi-speed bicycle), all of which attached to the frame. A cyclist, the person who rides the bicycle, provides the input power by turning pedals, thereby cranking the front sprocket (commonly referred to as <b>chainring).</b> The input power provided by the cyclist is equal to the product of cadence (i.e. the number of pedal revolutions per minute) and the torque on spindle of the bicycle's crankset. The bicycle's drivetrain transmits the input power to the road wheel, which in turn conveys the received power to the road as the output power of the bicycle. Depending on the gear ratio of the bicycle, a (torque, rpm)input pair is converted to a (torque, rpm)output pair. By using a larger rear gear, or by switching to a lower gear in multi-speed bicycles, angular speed of the road wheels is decreased while the torque is increased, product of which (i.e. power) does not change.|$|E
500|$|It was {{revealed}} after the stage that Cavendish's sudden movement had {{been caused by}} his chain falling off the big <b>chainring.</b> The loss of power caused him to swerve right and Viviani was unable to avoid him. Viviani suffered cuts and abrasions from the crash, though he avoided any broken bones {{and was able to}} complete the stage. [...] were keen to investigate the incident, as Tom Boonen had suffered a similar problem in the Tour of Qatar.|$|E
500|$|Thomas {{said after}} the race that his victory {{demonstrated}} that he could compete with the top stage racers in the world. He said that Henao's presence had been crucial to his victory and that, before the stage, he had chosen a 54-tooth <b>chainring</b> to help him chase back on if he was dropped on the final climb. He {{also said that he}} owed Gallopin [...] "a few beers" [...] for his assistance in chasing back to the leading groups on the final stage. Gallopin, meanwhile said that he had been happy to contribute to the chase of the second group on the final stage in order to have both a man in the leading group and in the chasing group. He added that he was also glad to help Thomas as the two men were friends and exchanged text messages whenever Thomas's Wales played Gallopin's France at rugby.|$|E
2500|$|Placing thin spacers {{between the}} <b>chainring</b> and its stack bolts {{to move it}} inboard (if the <b>chainring</b> is {{on the inside of}} the crank spider) or {{outboard}} (if the ring is on the outside of the spider) ...|$|E
2500|$|A planetary-gear {{crankset}} {{offers two}} different gear ratios {{with just one}} <b>chainring.</b> This can {{have at least two}} advantages: shifting while not pedaling and fewer chances for the chain to come off the <b>chainring.</b> [...] The Mountain Drive & Speed-Drive by Schlumpf Innovations and the Hammerschmidt are examples.|$|E
2500|$|Some cranksets {{used for}} freeride and {{downhill}} mountain biking have a chainguide installed. A chainguide is a metal or plastic housing {{that keeps the}} chain on the chainrings over rough terrain and during technical riding. Most chainguides are designed for only one front <b>chainring,</b> {{but there are a}} few dual-ring chainguides available such as the E13 DRS and MRP LRP. [...] Chainguides include a channel on the top of the <b>chainring</b> to keep the chain in line (for models designed for one front <b>chainring)</b> and a roller or sprocket on the bottom to help keep the chain engaged with the <b>chainring.</b> These are almost always used in conjunction with bashguards. Exceptions including the E.thirteen LG-1 and the MRP G2 (and now the G2 SL) do exist which use integrated skid plates, removing impact forces from the crank's spider and transferring them to the frame.|$|E
2500|$|Choosing {{a bottom}} bracket with two lockrings, which gives fine {{adjustment}} of <b>chainring</b> position ...|$|E
2500|$|Obtaining {{a bottom}} bracket with a {{different}} spindle length, to move the <b>chainring</b> inboard or outboard ...|$|E
2500|$|On older styles, the spider—the multi-armed {{piece that}} connects the <b>chainring</b> to the bottom bracket axle—was a {{separate}} piece from the crank arm. The most common modern cranks have an integrated spider on the drive-side crank arm. [...] However, Middleburn, TA, and Surly currently produce cranks with separate detachable spiders, enabling {{a wide variety of}} <b>chainring</b> patterns to be used with the same cranks.|$|E
2500|$|Placing thin spacers {{under the}} bottom bracket's {{right-hand}} cup (Sturmey-Archer make a suitable 1/16" [...] spacer) {{to move the}} <b>chainring</b> outboard ...|$|E
2500|$|Maintaining a {{fixed gear}} is {{relatively}} easy because it has fewer parts than a geared bicycle. [...] The sprocket should be checked regularly {{to make sure there}} is no damage to any teeth and that no object is grinding it as it turns with the rear wheel. [...] The <b>chainring</b> should be checked similarly for any damage. [...] There is an advantage to selecting a number of <b>chainring</b> teeth that is not a round multiple of the number of sprocket teeth (e.g. 3) because this avoids coincidence of the same <b>chainring</b> and sprocket teeth, and tyre contact patch, on each of the rider's power strokes. [...] For riders who perform brakeless skid-stops, it is best to select prime-numbered chainrings (e.g. 41, 43 or 47 teeth) to guarantee that rear tyre wear is spread evenly.|$|E
2500|$|Metres of {{development}} = Circumference of drive wheel in metres [...] ({{number of teeth}} in front <b>chainring</b> / number of teeth in rear sprocket).|$|E
2500|$|Gear inches = Diameter of {{drive wheel}} in inches [...] ({{number of teeth}} in front <b>chainring</b> / number of teeth in rear sprocket). Normally rounded to nearest whole number.|$|E
2500|$|Gain ratio = (Radius of {{drive wheel}} / length of pedal crank) [...] ({{number of teeth}} in front <b>chainring</b> / number of teeth in rear sprocket). Measure radius and length in same units.|$|E
2500|$|Front/rear {{measurement}} only {{considers the}} sizes of a <b>chainring</b> and a rear sprocket. Gear inches and metres of development also take {{the size of the}} rear wheel into account. [...] Gain ratio goes further and also takes the length of a pedal crankarm into account.|$|E
2500|$|Smarting {{from his}} {{disappointment}} at the World Championships, Bettini won Züri-Metzgete convincingly, with a 40-km solo {{attack in the}} rain that was almost derailed by his chain dropping off his <b>chainring</b> after his first acceleration. [...] Proving {{that he is a}} better climber than ever before, he won the climbers classic Giro di Lombardia in a three-way sprint with Gilberto Simoni and Fränk Schleck.|$|E
2500|$|One {{standard}} {{option for the}} Brompton folding bicycle {{is to use a}} 3-speed hub gear (roughly a 30% difference between gear ratios) in combination with a 2-speed deraileur gear (roughly a 15% difference) to give 6 distinct gear ratios; {{this is an example of}} half-step gearing. [...] Some Brompton suppliers offer a 2-speed <b>chainring</b> 'Mountain Drive' as well, which results in 12 distinct gear ratios with a range exceeding 5:1; in this case, the change from 6th to 7th gear involves changing all three sets of gears simultaneously.|$|E
2500|$|The {{following}} table {{provides some}} {{comparison of the}} various methods of measuring gears (the particular numbers are for bicycles with 170mm cranks, 700C wheels, and 25mm tyres). Speeds for several cadences in revolutions per minute are also given. [...] On each row the relative values for gear inches, metres of development, gain ratio, and speed {{are more or less}} correct, while the front/rear values are the nearest approximation which can be made using typical <b>chainring</b> and cogset sizes. Note that bicycles intended for racing may have a lowest gear of around 45 gear inches (or 35 if fitted with a compact crankset).|$|E
