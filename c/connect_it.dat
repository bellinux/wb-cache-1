5|$|On Tuesday 7 August, {{following}} a Monday bank holiday, prostitute Martha Tabram was murdered at about 2:30am. Her {{body was found}} at George Yard Buildings, George Yard, Whitechapel. She had been stabbed 39times with a short blade. On the basis of statements from a fellow prostitute, and PC Thomas Barrett who was patrolling nearby, Inspector Reid put soldiers at the Tower of London and Wellington Barracks on an identification parade, but without positive results. The police did not connect the murder with Smith's, but they did <b>connect</b> <b>it</b> with the later murders. Most experts today do not <b>connect</b> <b>it</b> with the other killings, as Tabram was stabbed whereas the later victims were slashed, but a connection cannot be ruled out.|$|E
5|$|The station {{opened on}} July 18, 2009. Trains serve the station 20 {{hours a day}} on most days; the headway between trains is 6 minutes during peak periods, with less {{frequent}} service at other times.

5|$|A {{light rail}} {{station in the}} Mount Baker area was first {{proposed}} in 1995 and approved the following year. Construction began in late 2005 and the station was opened for regular service on July 18, 2009. Trains serve the station 20 hours a day on most days; the headway between trains is 6 minutes during peak periods, with less frequent service at other times. Mount Baker station is also served by five King County Metro bus routes that <b>connect</b> <b>it</b> to Downtown, Capitol Hill, Rainier Beach, the Central District, and the University District.|$|E

5|$|In February 2011, Kentucky and Indiana {{announced}} that the two states, along with the City of Jeffersonville, would allocate $22 million in funding to complete the Big Four Bridge project, creating a pedestrian and bicycle path to link Louisville and Jeffersonville. Indiana would spend up to $8 million and the City of Jeffersonville would provide $2 million in matching dollars to pay for construction of a ramp to the Big Four Bridge. Kentucky pledged $12 million to replace the deck on the bridge and <b>connect</b> <b>it</b> to the spiral ramp that was completed in Waterfront Park.|$|E
5|$|On June 18, 1998, {{a severe}} storm damaged the estate. Heavy rains caused the {{drainage}} system to fail and {{a cascade of}} water surged over the retaining wall. This caused a mudslide, damaging the estate's foundation. Furthermore, the large oak tree {{at the center of}} the courtyard fell down on top of the house. The next year, another storm collapsed a tunnel underneath the studio wing. A 1999 grant from Save America's Treasures helped defray costs to re-roof Taliesin III, to stabilize its foundation, and to <b>connect</b> <b>it</b> to a local sewage treatment plant.|$|E
5|$|Tabram {{was killed}} on 7 August 1888; she had {{suffered}} 39 stab wounds. The savagery of the murder, the lack of obvious motive, and {{the closeness of the}} location (George Yard, Whitechapel) and date to those of the later Ripper murders led police to link them. The attack differs from the canonical murders in that Tabram was stabbed rather than slashed at the throat and abdomen, and many experts do not <b>connect</b> <b>it</b> with the later murders because of the difference in the wound pattern.|$|E

5|$|To {{develop a}} better feel of how Voodoo was practised, Saltzman and Broccoli escorted Hamilton, Mankiewicz and {{production}} designer Syd Cain to scout New Orleans further {{and then the}} islands of the West Indies. Haiti was an important destination of the tour and not only did Fleming <b>connect</b> <b>it</b> with the religion, there were many practitioners available to witness. Despite viewing actual demonstrations, due to political unrest {{in the country at}} the time, it was decided not to film in Haiti.|$|E
5|$|The Rainier Beach {{area was}} first {{proposed}} for light rail service in 1995, and {{included in the}} final plan for Central Link approved in 1999. Construction on Rainier Beach station began in 2006, and regular train service began on July 18, 2009. Trains serve the station 20 hours a day on most days; the headway between trains is 6 minutes during peak periods, with less frequent service at other times.

The station also has six art installations that were funded by a systemwide art program.|$|E
5|$|The film {{opened in}} Italy in August 17, 1963 {{under the title}} I tre volti della paura which {{translates}} to The Three Faces of Fear. Black Sabbath grossed 103.5 million Italian lira on its initial theatrical release in Italy. American International Pictures released the English version of Black Sabbath in May 6, 1964 as a double bill with Bava's The Girl Who Knew Too Much then titled The Evil Eye. The English title of Black Sabbath was chosen to <b>connect</b> <b>it</b> with Bava's previous film Black Sunday. The film opened in France on 17 November 1965 under the title Les trois visages de la peur.|$|E

5|$|The newer building, {{constructed}} in 1752 {{under the guidance}} of architects William Hiorne and his brother David, consists of five bays, with a large bay at the side, constructed around 1800 to <b>connect</b> <b>it</b> to the older building. There is a central portico, with a flat roof supported by four ionic columns, added in 1926. The tripartite windows of the ground floor contrast with the French windows of the first floor, which are fronted by cast iron balconies. The attic floor has small 4 x 2 pane windows. The rear of the house consists of four bays, with a large central window on the first floor and a central door, surrounded with ashlar cornicing. Both sections of the house are {{constructed in}} red Flemish bond brick, which, until 1926, was covered with render.|$|E
5|$|The use {{of water}} to {{extinguish}} the fire was also frustrated. In principle, water was available from a system of elm pipes which supplied 30,000 houses via a high water tower at Cornhill, filled from the river at high tide, and also via a reservoir of Hertfordshire spring water in Islington. It was often possible to open a pipe near a burning building and <b>connect</b> <b>it</b> to a hose to play on a fire or fill buckets. Further, Pudding Lane {{was close to the}} river. Theoretically, all the lanes from the river up to the bakery and adjoining buildings should have been manned with double rows of firefighters passing full buckets up to the fire and empty buckets back down to the river.|$|E
5|$|Tukwila International Boulevard station {{opened on}} July 18, 2009, {{on the first}} day of Central Link service, and was the line's {{terminus}} until SeaTac/Airport station opened in December 2009. Construction of the station was approved in 1996, but did not begin until 2005 due to routing disputes and planning issues. Trains serve the station twenty hours a day on most days; the headway between trains is six minutes during peak periods, with less frequent service at other times. Tukwila International Boulevard station is also served by King County Metro buses, including two RapidRide limited-stop bus rapid transit routes, that <b>connect</b> <b>it</b> to Downtown Seattle, West Seattle, and areas in southern King County.|$|E

5|$|Following this, in 1972, the {{legislature}} {{added a new}} SR117, which extended this part of SR75 southwest to the Mexican border near Border Field State Park, to the state highway system, and a southerly extension of SR125 to the border at Otay Mesa to the state highway and Freeway and Expressway systems. Two years later, planning began {{for the construction of}} the Otay Mesa crossing and the construction of SR75 to <b>connect</b> <b>it</b> to I-5 and I-805. Later, the Comprehensive Planning Organization (CPO), the local association of municipal governments, recommended using $4million of federal funding for the construction of SR75. The CPO later endorsed expediting construction of the freeway before completion of the border crossing, so that the freeway would primarily serve border traffic, thus preventing land speculation in Otay Mesa. While Mexican authorities wanted the crossing constructed in 1975, the CPO indicated that the funding for SR75 would not be available until at least 1980, or even 1985. Following this, Representative Lionel Van Deerlin attempted to accelerate the construction of the crossing, even though there was no funding for the highway.|$|E
5|$|Further {{down the}} hill, along the Military Road, is a two-story house, known as The Stewards House or as Killakee House (not to be {{confused}} with the now-demolished Killakee House that served as the residence of the Massy family who owned the adjacent Killakee Estate). It was built around 1765 by the Conolly family as a hunting lodge. Over the years, it has served as a dower house and as a residence for the agent who managed the Killakee Estate. To the rear is a belfry; this was once a common feature of large farmhouses and was used to call the workers for meals. The Hell Fire Club held meetings here for a time following the fire that damaged Mount Pelier lodge. The house has a reputation for being haunted, particularly by a large black cat. Stories regarding the origin of this spectre either <b>connect</b> <b>it</b> with the account of the priest who exorcised a cat at the Hell Fire Club or with a cat that was doused in whiskey and set alight by members of the Hell Fire Club before escaping across the mountains with its fur aflame.|$|E
5|$|The US23 bypass of Fenton opened as {{a freeway}} west of {{downtown}} in 1958. The former route of US23 along Shiawassee Avenue and LeRoy Street in Fenton was redesignated {{as a business}} loop at this time, and the state assumed control of Silver Lake Road to <b>connect</b> <b>it</b> back to the freeway northwest of town. Three years later, the US23 freeway was extended southward from the Livingston–Genesee county line; at that time, the freeway connections were reconfigured and Bus. US23 was shifted to use Owen Road between a new freeway interchange {{and the rest of}} the business loop at Shiawassee Avenue. In the middle of the 1970s, city officials redeveloped downtown and closed two blocks of LeRoy Street in 1975. After this closure, the business loop was split into two sections, and only the northern one was retained as a signed state highway. The southern segment was retained as an unsigned state highway until both segments were turned over to local control in 2006.|$|E
