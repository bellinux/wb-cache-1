40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2016 - 06 Printed {{electronics}} is {{an emerging}} {{area of study}} {{at the forefront of}} additive manufacturing technology. Additively manufactured electronic devices have many novel application areas, including three-dimensional microbatteries, electrically small antennas, spanning electrodes and printed circuit boards. Conductive features, the backbone of all electronic devices, are typically printed with colloidal solutions of silver nanoparticles. Of the well-studied metallic nanoparticle systems, silver exhibits the highest conductivity and is commonly used in commercially available <b>conductive</b> <b>inks.</b> These inks are typically capped with polymeric ligands that interfere with ink rheology and require high processing temperatures to achieve the desired electrical conductivity. For this reason, there is an impetus to develop <b>conductive</b> <b>inks</b> that can be processed at low temperatures in order to minimize processing costs and improve substrate compatibility. This work explores four methods of synthesizing silver nanoparticle based <b>conductive</b> <b>inks,</b> including polymeric ligand, ligand free, small molecule, and conductive ligand synthesis techniques...|$|R

40|$|A novel process {{utilizing}} specialized {{continuous inkjet}} (CIJ) printing technology and innovative <b>conductive</b> <b>inks</b> to fabricate three-dimensional electronic products is {{introduced in the}} current investigation. The major advantage of the CIJ process is that it not only provides a fast and cost-effective method for applying electronic components, but it also allows the printing of conductive traces in three-dimensional space. The greatest challenge for inkjet printing of electrical circuits is the formulation of the <b>conductive</b> <b>inks,</b> which define not only the convenience of the materials being deposited, but also the final comprehensive properties and the major expense. Several <b>conductive</b> <b>inks</b> were investigated and compared mainly based on their electric conductance and mechanical adherence to a substrate. Two different particle-free solution <b>conductive</b> <b>inks</b> were specifically researched for low cost, deposition convenience and improved properties. A novel aqueous solution of silver nitrate with a corresponding adhesion promoter is introduced for the first time. It {{has been found that}} the traces produced by the process have excellent adherence and have an electrical resistivity of only 2. 9 times that of bulk silver. Low temperature curing plus further annealing of a specified metallo-organic decomposition (MOD) ink produces close-packed silver crystal substructures. The electrical conductance of the final conductive trace was close to that of bulk silver, and wearability was significantly improved from ductile deformation. These two particle-free solution inks are expected to find a number of applications in various industries. Fundamental concepts in formulating and post-processing of inkjet printing are fully discussed. The two primary problems faced by inkjet printed components are low deposited thickness and porosity. An interlayer oxide film was found to be necessary to bond the precious metal layer with the glass substrate. Porosity can be significantly reduced through high temperature annealing, which not only increases electrical conductance, but also mechanical strength. Special curing methods are proposed to consolidate the printed conductors and avoid overheating of temperature sensitive substrates...|$|R
