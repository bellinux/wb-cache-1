40|$|Abstract. For a {{class of}} {{integral}} operators it is shown that if the integral kernel of one operator majorates the kernel of the other one then certain forms of eigenvalue estimates are inherited. The operators must be related to a positivity preserving semi-group and, respectively, a positively dominated semi-group. It follows, in particular, that any, suciently regular, eigenvalue estimate for the Schrodinger operator is <b>carried</b> <b>over</b> <b>automatically</b> to the magnetic Schrodinger operator, regardless of the method of obtaining the estimate. 1. There are two natural notions of positivity for operators acting in L 2 (X) where X is a space with a -nite measure. On the one hand, it is the positivity in the operator sense: K is non-negative if (Ku;u) 0 for any u in the domain D(K) of the operator K. Another notion of positivity {{is related to the}} lattice structure of the L...|$|R
40|$|The miRBase is the {{official}} miRNA repository which keeps the annotation updated on newly discovered miRNAs: it is also used as a reference {{for the design of}} miRNA profiling platforms. Nomenclature ambi-guities generated by loosely updated platforms and design errors lead to incompatibilities among plat-forms, even from the same vendor. Published miRNA lists are thus generated with different profiling plat-forms that refer to diverse and not updated annota-tions. This greatly compromises searches, compar-isons and analyses that rely on miRNA names only without taking into account the mature sequences, which is particularly critic when such analyses are <b>carried</b> <b>over</b> <b>automatically.</b> In this paper we introduce miRiadne, a web tool to harmonize miRNA nomen-clature, which takes into account the original miR-Base versions from 10 up to 21, and annotations of 25 common profiling platforms from nine brands that we manually curated. miRiadne uses the miRNA ma-ture sequence to link miRBase versions and/or plat-forms to prevent nomenclature ambiguities. miRi-adne was designed to simplify and support biol-ogists and bioinformaticians in re-annotating their own miRNA lists and/or data sets. As Ariadne helped Theseus in escaping the mythological maze, miRi-adne will help the miRNA researcher in escaping the nomenclature maze. miRiadne is freely accessible from th...|$|R
5000|$|The {{privileges}} of borough status {{are that the}} council chairperson is called [...] "mayor" [...] and up to one quarter of councillors can be called [...] "alderman", and the council can award freedom of the borough. The Municipal Corporations (Ireland) Act 1840 extinguished all the boroughs in Ireland except for ten. In what would in 1921 become Northern Ireland, there were two remaining municipal boroughs in 1840: Belfast (made a city in 1888) and Derry (officially Londonderry, and a city since 1604). Five towns with abolished corporations remained parliamentary boroughs until 1885 (Armagh, Carrickfergus, Coleraine, Dungannon, and Enniskillen) as did three (Downpatrick, Lisburn, and Newry) where any corporation was defunct by 1801. Several of the urban districts in Northern Ireland created under the Local Government (Ireland) Act 1898 later received charters granting borough status. The Local Government Act (Northern Ireland) 1972 replaced the multi-tier local government system with 26 unitary districts whose councils could retain the charter of a borough within the district; other districts later received borough charters in their own right. The 2015 local government reforms replaced the 26 districts with 11 larger districts. The [...] "statutory transition committee" [...] handling each council merger {{had the right to}} request transfer of borough status as in 1972, and unionist-majority councils did so, while nationalist-majority councils chose not to apply. There were complications where places had city status; therefore Belfast, Derry and Lisburn's borough charters <b>carried</b> <b>over</b> <b>automatically,</b> without the need for the council to pass a resolution. Although Newry received city status in 2002, Newry and Mourne District Council did not receive borough status. In 2015 its successor Newry, Mourne and Down District Council voted not to request borough status, the required two-thirds majority failing after opposition from Sinn Féin.|$|R

40|$|Task {{demands that}} {{influence}} scanning behaviour in one task can cause that behaviour to persist {{to a second}} unrelated task (<b>carry</b> <b>over).</b> This can also affect performance on a second task (e. g., hazard perception ratings), and {{has been attributed to}} a process of attentional bias that is modulated by top-down influences (Thompson & Crundall, 2011). In a series of experiments we explored how these top-down influences impact upon <b>carry</b> <b>over.</b> In all experiments, participants searched letters that were presented horizontally, vertically, or in a random array. They were then presented with a driving scene and rated the hazardousness of the scene. <b>Carry</b> <b>over</b> of eye-movements from the letter search to the scene was observed in all experiments. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that this <b>carry</b> <b>over</b> effect influenced hazard perception accuracy. The magnitude of <b>carry</b> <b>over</b> was correlated with task switching abilities, attentional conflicting, and attentional orienting (Experiment 1), and was affected by predictability of the primary task (Experiment 2). Furthermore, direct current stimulation of the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and parietal areas affected the magnitude of the effect (Experiment 3). These results indicate that <b>carry</b> <b>over</b> is modulated by the specific ability to orient attention and disengage from this orientation. Over orienting leads to increased <b>carry</b> <b>over</b> and insufficient task switching is detrimental to task performance. As a result the current experiments provide evidence that the <b>carry</b> <b>over</b> effect is strongly influenced by attentional processes, namely orienting, inhibition, and task switching...|$|R
