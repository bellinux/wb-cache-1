5|$|The stadium's {{interior}} comprises {{a continuous}} oval bowl, with three tiers of seating at the sides, and two tiers at each end. Entry by patrons is gained by <b>contactless</b> <b>smart</b> <b>card</b> rather than traditional manned turnstiles. The system can admit up to 1,200 people per minute through all entrances. A service tunnel under the stadium provides access for emergency vehicles and the visiting team's coach {{to enter the}} stadium directly. Once inside the stadium patrons have access to six themed restaurants, two of which have views of the pitch, and there are 70 executive boxes above the second tier of seating in the north, west and east stands. The stadium is equip with stand-by generators {{should there be a}} electrical mains failure. These are capable of keeping the stadium electrics running as well as the floodlights at 800 lux, the minimum level stipulated by FIFA to continue to broadcast live football.|$|E

5|$|There {{are over}} two dozen public transit {{agencies}} in the Bay Area with overlapping service areas that utilize different modes, with designated connection points between the various operators. Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART), a heavy rail/metro system, operates in four counties and connects San Francisco and Oakland via an underwater tube. Other commuter rail systems link San Francisco with the Peninsula and San Jose (Caltrain), San Jose with the Tri-Valley Area and San Joaquin county (ACE), and Sonoma with Marin county (SMART). In addition, Amtrak provides frequent commuter service between and San Jose and the East Bay with Sacramento, and long distance service {{to other parts of}} the United States. Muni Metro operates a hybrid streetcar/subway system within the city of San Francisco, and VTA operates a light rail system in Santa Clara county. These rail systems are supplemented by numerous bus agencies and transbay ferries such as Golden Gate Ferry and the San Francisco Bay Water Transit Authority. Most of these agencies accept the Clipper Card, a reloadable <b>contactless</b> <b>smart</b> <b>card,</b> as a universal electronic payment system.|$|E
5|$|A Standard Ticket <b>contactless</b> <b>smart</b> <b>card</b> {{for single}} or return {{journeys}} {{may also be}} purchased at the GTM for the payment of MRT and/or LRT fares. A S$0.10 deposit will be levied on top of the fare to be paid. The deposit will be automatically refunded through an offset of the fare to be paid for the third journey on the same ticket while an additional discount of S$0.10 will be given for the sixth journey on the same ticket. No refund of the deposit is provided if the card is used for fewer than 3 journeys. The ticket can be used for the purchase of single or return journeys to and from pre-selected stations up to a maximum of six journeys over 30 days. Fares for the Standard Ticket are always higher than those charged for the stored-valued CEPAS (EZ-Link and NETS FlashPay) cards for the same distance traveled. The ticket is retained by the user after each journey and {{does not need to be}} returned to any GTM or Passenger Service Centre. Identical to the usage of CEPAS cards, the ticket is tapped onto the faregate reader upon entry and exit.|$|E

25|$|The {{system does}} not make much use of fare zones aside from {{downtown}} zones in Minneapolis and St. Paul, where rides only cost $0.50. Fare transfer cards valid for 2.5 hours are available upon payment of fare. Only the Northstar commuter rail line charges fares based on distance. A number of discounted multiple-use transit pass options are available. In early 2007, the system introduced a <b>contactless</b> <b>smart</b> <b>card</b> (the Go-To card) for paying fares.|$|E
25|$|Most—but not all—public {{transport}} {{requires the}} purchase of a ticket to generate revenue for the operators. Tickets may be bought either in advance, or {{at the time of the}} journey, or the carrier may allow both methods. Passengers may be issued with a paper ticket, a metal or plastic token, or a magnetic or electronic card (smart card, <b>contactless</b> <b>smart</b> <b>card).</b> Sometimes a ticket has to be validated, e.g. a paper ticket has to be stamped, or an electronic ticket has to be checked in.|$|E
40|$|<b>Contactless</b> <b>smart</b> <b>cards</b> {{are used}} to {{securely}} store data and to authorize the execution of sensitive operations. Their contactless interface represents a mixed blessing, allowing fast operations but also exposing such devices to potential attacks. Relay attacks {{are among the most}} powerful attacks applicable against <b>contactless</b> <b>smart</b> <b>cards,</b> allowing a <b>contactless</b> reader to interact with a physically far away card establishing a communication channel between them. In this paper we prove {{that it is possible to}} conduct such an attack on a geographical scale, basically without any constraints on the reader and card positions and reaching a relay distance of several kilometers, probably the first example in the literature for <b>contactless</b> <b>smart</b> <b>cards,</b> using cheap and off-the-shelf hardware and software tools.

25|$|The {{policies}} of the Land Transport Authority are meant to {{encourage the use of}} public transport in Singapore. The key aims are to provide an incentive to reside away from the Central district, as well as to reduce air pollution. Singapore has a Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) and Light Rail Transit (LRT) rail system consisting of five lines. There is also a system of bus routes throughout the island, most of which have air conditioning units installed due to Singapore's tropical climate. A <b>contactless</b> <b>smart</b> <b>card</b> called the EZ-Link card is used to pay bus and MRT fares.|$|E
25|$|STIB sees {{itself as}} a {{provider}} of mobility rather than just public transport, and has a 49% share in the Cambio carsharing franchise. The Brussels conurbation— 19 municipalities plus adjoining commuter belt— is also served by a fairly dense network of main-line trains. The MOBIB <b>contactless</b> <b>smart</b> <b>card</b> {{can be used on}} buses, trams, the metro and for mainline railway season tickets, and is gradually being extended to other modes, although it is not yet accepted by De Lijn or TEC. A simple tariff system permits unlimited changes with a one-hour period for €2.50 when bought from the driver, €2.10 from a ticket machine. Real-time arrival indicators have been installed at many tram stops.|$|E
25|$|The Oyster card is a <b>contactless</b> <b>smart</b> <b>card</b> system {{introduced}} for {{the public}} in 2003, {{which can be used}} to pay individual fares (pay as you go) or to carry various Travelcards and other passes. It is used by holding the card close to the yellow card reader. Card readers are found on ticket gates where otherwise a paper ticket could be fed through, allowing the gate to open and the passenger to walk through, and on stand-alone Oyster validators, which do not operate a barrier. Since 2010, Oyster Pay as you go has been available on all National Rail services within London. Oyster Pay as you go has a set of daily maximum charges that are the same as buying the nearest equivalent Day Travelcard.|$|E

25|$|BMRCL {{began selling}} tokens through {{automatic}} ticket vending machines (ATVMs) on 4 December 2012 at the MG Road, Indiranagar and Baiyyappanahalli stations. The service {{will eventually be}} expanded to all metro stations. The touchscreen enabled ATVMs are available in 3 languages – English, Kannada and Hindi. Commuters can purchase a single journey token by selecting the destination station or the amount in the ATVM. They can also add value or add trips to the <b>contactless</b> <b>smart</b> <b>card.</b> Commuters can purchase up to 8 tickets {{at a time and}} can get the receipt print for card recharge. ATVMs accept coins of 5 and 10 denominations and 10, 20, 50, 100, 500 denominations of currency notes. However, the ATVM cannot differentiate between 1 and 2 coins.|$|E
25|$|The EZ-Link card is a <b>contactless</b> <b>smart</b> <b>card,</b> {{initially}} {{based on}} Sony's FeliCa smartcard technology. The cards are mainly {{used for the}} payment of transportation fares, but may {{also be used for}} payment at selected retail outlets. Established in 2002, the technology was promoted as the means for speedier and more convenient transactions and as well as being an efficient method of reducing fare evasion, although there have been some cases of overcharging users. As a benchmark, fares range from S$0.70 to S$3.20 for adults, S$0.70 to S$1.35 for senior citizens, and S$0.40 to S$0.50 for student EZ-Link cards. Patrons using an EZ-Link card receive a discount for their journey, including a discount if they use a connecting bus after their MRT ride.|$|E

[...] The original LRT-1 was built as a no-frills means of public transport and lacks some features and comforts, but the new LRT-2 has been built with additional standards and criteria in mind like barrier-free access. Security guards at each station conduct inspections and provide assistance. A reusable plastic magnetic ticketing system has replaced the previous token-based system in 2001, and the Flash Pass introduced as a step towards a more integrated transportation system. In 2015, the plastic magnetic tickets were replaced with the Beep, a <b>contactless</b> <b>smart</b> <b>card,</b> was introduced to provide a common ticketing to 3 rail lines and some bus lines.|$|E
