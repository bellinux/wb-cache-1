Replacement of DBs with water after the main meal in obese and overweight healthy and type 2 diabetic women who were regular users of DBs may cause greater weight reduction during 24 weeks and also in the longer period of an 18 month weight management program. In addition, replacement of DBs with water offers clinical benefits to improve insulin resistance. Generally, better improvements in energy and carbohydrate metabolism may occur when water rather than DBs is consumed over a weight loss program...|$|R
