50|$|A bassinet, bassinette, or cradle is a bed {{specifically}} for babies {{from birth to}} about four months. Bassinets are generally designed to work with fixed legs or casters, while cradles are generally {{designed to provide a}} rocking or gliding motion. Bassinets and cradles are distinguished from Moses baskets and <b>carry</b> <b>cots,</b> which are designed to be carried and sit directly on the floor or furniture. After four months, babies are often transferred to a crib (North American usage) or cot (UK usage). In the United States, however, the bedside sleeper is the prevalent option, since they are generally bigger, recommended up to 6 months, and often used up to a year.|$|E
40|$|On {{the morning}} of September 11 th, 2001 the United States and the Western world entered a new era – one in which {{indiscriminate}} terrorist acts of all kinds must be expected. Many, if not most, of the expected consequences of the new era will be reflected in supply chain management challenges: relations with suppliers and customers, transportation difficulties and revised inventory management strategies. This article looks at the twin corporate challenges of preparing for new terrorist attacks, and of operating under heightened security resulting in less reliable lead times and less certain demand scenarios. In addition it looks at how companies should organize to meet those challenges efficiently and the new role that public-private partnerships are likely to play. To prepare for terrorist attacks, firms should revise their inventory management posture and keep strategic inventory on hand. This {{does not mean that}} they should abandon just-in-time principles since JIT brought about better quality, higher accountability and better productivity, in addition to reduction in inventory <b>carrying</b> <b>cots.</b> Instead, firms should manage the strategic inventory in a JIT fashion. Similarly, firms should not abandon offshor...|$|R
500|$|Thirty-fiveyears {{after the}} Alamo fell, a {{reporter}} identified Louis [...] "Moses" [...] Rose {{as the only}} man to have [...] "deserted" [...] the Texian forces at the Alamo. According to the reporter's version of Rose's account, when Travis realized that the Mexican army would likely prevail, he drew {{a line in the}} sand and asked those willing to die for the cause to cross the line. At Bowie's request Crockett and several others <b>carried</b> the <b>cot</b> over the line, leaving Rose alone on the other side. After its publication, several other eyewitnesses confirmed the account, but as Rose was deceased the story can only be authenticated by the word of the reporter, who admitted to embellishing other articles, [...] "and thus many historians refuse to believe it." ...|$|R
50|$|The Couzinet 33 Biarritz, a {{four-seater}} passenger plane, {{made its}} first flight on 25 November 1931. From March 6 to April 5, 1932, it completed the first air link from France to New Caledonia piloted by Charles de Verneilh Puyraseau, Max Dévé second pilot and radio operator, and Emile Munch mechanic. The crew were unharmed by its rough landing at Tontouta Nouméa but it was dismantled and shipped back to France by sea. The Biarritz, repaired and equipped with more powerful engines, went on to perform in Europe, including a flight <b>carrying</b> Pierre <b>Cot,</b> the French air minister, between Moscow and Paris, {{as well as to}} make several flights in Africa, including to the Cape Verde Islands. Returning from North Africa, it crashed at Blaisy-Bas in the Côte-dOr on 30 October 1933.|$|R
5000|$|Standard travel cot: This is {{the usual}} type of travel cot with {{collapsible}} frame and removable mattress. It usually has a rectangular shape, but different styles are now being developed. This {{can be used as}} a travel cot and a playpen and is suitable for babies from birth until 6.5 kg (approximately 3 years old). Though a Standard travel cot is usually quite cumbersome to <b>carry,</b> Lightweight travel <b>cots</b> have now been designed ideal for camping, hiking or taking on airplanes when weight is at a premium.|$|R
40|$|Eleven cobalt-tolerant mutants {{were found}} {{to belong to a}} single {{complementation}} group, cot 2. In addition to cobalt, the cot 2 mutants {{were found to}} tolerate increased levels of the divalent cations Zn 2 +, Mn 2 +, and Ni 2 + as well. All of the cot 2 mutants exhibited a wiener-shaped cellular morphology that was exacerbated by the carbon and nitrogen source but was unaffected by metals. The rate of glucose-dependent transport of cobalt into cells was reduced in strains that carry mutations in the COT 2 gene. COT 2 is not essential for growth. Strains that <b>carry</b> a <b>COT</b> 2 allele conferring complete loss of function are viable and exhibit phenotypes similar to those of spontaneous cot 2 mutations. The sequence of the COT 2 gene shows that it is identical to GRR 1, which encodes a protein required for glucose repression. The glucose dependence of the transport defect implies that cot 2 mutations affect the link between glucose metabolism and divalent cation active transport...|$|R

[...] It states they looked the very ghosts of men, [...] So heavily had hunger told on them, [...] And the {{fatigues}} and toils of the retreat. [...] Several were landed dead, and many died [...] As they were borne along. At Portsmouth, too, [...] Sir David Baird, still helpless from his wound, [...] Was <b>carried</b> in a <b>cot,</b> sheet-pale and thin, [...] And Sir John Hope, lank as a skeleton.-- [...] Thereto is added, with authority, [...] That a new expedition soon will fit, [...] And start again for Spain.|$|R
5000|$|Bowie and Travis began {{sending out}} {{couriers}} with pleas for provisions and assistance. Travis sent Juan Seguin on Bowie's horse, to recruit reinforcements on February 25, and 32 additional men arrived. On February 26, David Crockett reported that Bowie, though suffering from his affliction, continued to crawl {{from his bed}} around noon every day and presented himself to the Alamo's inhabitants, which much boosted the morale of his comrades.Thirty-five years after the Alamo fell, a reporter identified Louis [...] "Moses" [...] Rose as the only man to have [...] "deserted" [...] the Texian forces at the Alamo.

5000|$|That evening, James Allen {{became the}} last courier {{to leave the}} Alamo, {{carrying}} messages from Travis {{and several of the}} other men. [...] Legend holds that at some point on March 5, Travis gathered his men and explained that an attack was likely imminent, and that the Mexican Army would likely prevail. He supposedly drew {{a line in the sand}} and asked those willing to die for the Texian cause to cross and stand alongside him. A bedridden Bowie requested that Crockett and several others <b>carry</b> his <b>cot</b> over the line, leaving only one man, Louis [...] "Moses" [...] Rose on the other side. Explaining that he was not yet ready to die, Rose escaped that evening. This episode was first mentioned in a newspaper article written thirty-five years after the Alamo fell by a reporter who said his parents heard the story directly from Rose.

60|$|While {{waiting for}} the arrival of the reinforcements, Captain Crosbie went on board the Cerf. The wounded had all been <b>carried</b> below, where <b>cots</b> had been slung for them. After their wounds were dressed, he went round saying a few words to each, enquiring into the nature of their injuries. No attempt had been made to remedy the {{confusion}} on deck, except that the bodies of those that could be moved had been laid side by side. That of Mr. Playford and the others who had been crushed by the falling masts still lay beneath them, as the four men left on board were unable to do anything to extricate them until help arrived. The captain then went on board the prize.|$|R

6000|$|Such fame as {{it brought}} did not yield heavy {{financial}} return. Its author continued {{to win a}} more or less precarious livelihood doing miscellaneous work, until March, 1866, when he was employed by the Sacramento Union to contribute a series of letters from the Sandwich Islands. They were notable letters, widely read and freely copied, and the sojourn there was a generally fortunate one. It was during his stay in the islands that the survivors of the wrecked vessel, the Hornet, came in, after long privation at sea. Clemens was sick at the time, but Anson Burlingame, who was in Honolulu, on the way to China, had him <b>carried</b> in a <b>cot</b> to the hospital, where he could interview the surviving sailors and take down their story. It proved a great [...] "beat" [...] for the Union, and added considerably to its author's prestige. On his return to San Francisco he contributed an article on the Hornet disaster to Harper's Magazine, and looked forward to its publication as a beginning of a real career. But, alas! when it appeared the printer and the proof-reader had somehow converted [...] "Mark Twain" [...] into [...] "Mark Swain," [...] and his dreams perished.|$|R
5000|$|Wanted posters {{appeared}} {{all over}} the country with a price on Stern’s head. Stern wandered from safe house to safe house in Tel Aviv, <b>carrying</b> a collapsible <b>cot</b> in a suitcase. When he ran out of hiding places he slept in apartment house stairwells. Eventually he moved into a Tel Aviv apartment rented by Moshe and Tova Svorai, who were members of Lehi. Moshe Svorai was caught by British detectives who raided another apartment, where two Lehi members were shot dead, and Svorai and one other wounded were hospitalized. Stern’s Lehi “contact”, Hisia Shapiro, thought she might have been followed one morning and stopped bringing messages. On 12 February 1942 she came with one last message, from the Haganah, offering to house Stern {{for the duration of the}} war if he would give up his fight against the British. Stern gave Shapiro a letter in reply declining the safe haven and suggesting cooperation between Lehi and the Haganah in fighting the British. A couple of hours later British detectives arrived to search the apartment and discovered Stern hiding there. It was the mother of one of the [...] "Lehi" [...] members who inadvertently led the police to Stern's hiding place in Tel Aviv. Two neighbors were brought to attest to the propriety of the search. After they had left, Tova Svorai was also taken away so that Stern was alone with three armed policemen. Then, in circumstances that remain disputed today, Stern was shot dead.|$|R
