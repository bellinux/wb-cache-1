50|$|The Dartford warbler {{was first}} {{described}} by the Welsh naturalist Thomas Pennant from two specimens that were shot in April 1773 on Bexley Heath near Dartford in Kent. The species was assigned the binomial name of Motacilla undata by the Dutch naturalist Pieter Boddaert in 1783 based on a <b>coloured</b> <b>plate</b> in Edmé-Louis Daubenton's Planches enluminées d'histoire naturelle.|$|E
50|$|Charles Goodspeed, in Angling in America (1939), {{his history}} of American angling, credits Halford's Floating Flies and How to Dress Them as having a {{significant}} influence on {{the introduction of the}} dry-fly method into America. In 1890 Halford exchanged a series of letters on the subject of dry-fly fishing with American angler, Theodore Gordon, to include a complete set of Halford's favourite dry flies. In 1892, Favorite Flies and Their Histories, by Mary Orvis Mabury devoted a <b>coloured</b> <b>plate</b> to a selection of Halford's dry flies, along with their method of use.|$|E
50|$|In {{the same}} year, 1935, the League {{commenced}} publication of Gould League Notes, {{a magazine that}} appeared annually until 1967, following the general pattern set by the earlier Supplements to the Gazette. A copy was sent to every public school in the state, as well as every private school with a Gould League branch. The first issue ran to 24 pages, {{the next three to}} 40, and from 1939 there were always more than 50. From the beginning the pages were brightened by a <b>coloured</b> <b>plate,</b> supplied (with descriptive notes) by Neville Cayley for many years, and then by a succession of distinguished artists. Starting with 1938, League Notes featured extensive accounts of the most recent Bird Camp.|$|E

5000|$|The {{laughing}} kookaburra {{was first}} described and illustrated (in black and white) by the French naturalist and explorer Pierre Sonnerat in his Voyage à la nouvelle Guinée {{which was published}} in 1776. He claimed to have seen the bird in New Guinea. In fact Sonnerat never visited New Guinea and the laughing kookaburra does not occur there. He probably obtained a preserved specimen from one of the naturalists who accompanied Captain James Cook to the east coast of Australia. Edme-Louis Daubenton and François-Nicolas Martinet included a <b>coloured</b> <b>plate</b> of the laughing kookaburra based on Sonnerat's specimen in their Planches enluminées d'histoire naturelle. The plate has the legend in French [...] "Martin-pecheur, de la Nouvelle Guinée" [...] (Kingfisher from New Guinea).|$|E
50|$|In 1783 the French naturalist Johann Hermann {{provided}} a formal {{description of the}} species based the <b>coloured</b> <b>plate</b> by Daubenton and Martinet. He gave it the scientific name Alcedo novæ Guineæ. The current genus Dacelo was introduced in 1815 by the English zoologist William Elford Leach, and is an anagram of Alcedo, the Latin word for a kingfisher. The specific name novaeguineae combines the Latin novus for new with Guinea, based on the erroneous belief that the specimen had originated from New Guinea. For many years {{it was believed that}} the earliest description was by the Dutch naturalist Pieter Boddaert and his scientific name Dacelo gigas was used in the scientific literature but in 1926 the Australian ornithologist Gregory Mathews showed that a description by Hermann had been published earlier in the same year, 1783, and thus had precedence.|$|E
50|$|The initial {{step towards}} the “beautiful forms” in {{cultivation}} {{at the time}} was taken by the Curator of Kew. He raised the hybrid “Streptocarpus x Kewensis” by crossing S. rexii and S. dunii. However, he had previously also raised S. parviflorus x S. rexii. A <b>coloured</b> <b>plate</b> of the progeny was published in 1886. In 1887, another Kew-raised hybrid flowered. It was a hybrid of S. parviflorus and S. dunnii, and received the name of S. x Watsoni, after Mr Watson who raised the seed. In 1887, two hybrids (S. x Kewensis and S. x Watsoni) were crossed with each other and their parents in all combinations. A host of progeny resulted with marked differences in colour, size, form and flower, and many were “decidedly attractive”. A selection of these were obtained by Heal, who crossed them {{with each other and with}} the red-flowered S. dunii. Many of these are now known as “Veitch’s Original Hybrids”. Breeding continued using these hybrids.|$|E
