5|$|Edmund Emil Kemper III (born December 18, 1948) is an American {{serial killer}} who {{abducted}} and murdered several {{women in the}} early 1970s and murdered his paternal grandparents and his mother. He regularly engaged in necrophilia and claimed to have <b>consumed</b> <b>the</b> flesh {{of at least one}} of his victims, but later retracted this confession.|$|E
5|$|Heading for {{the east}} coast of the United States soon after the start of the new year, 1946, Wisconsin transited the Panama Canal from 11–13 January and reached Hampton Roads, Virginia on 18 January. Following a cruise south to Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, the {{battleship}} entered the Norfolk Naval Shipyard for overhaul. After repairs and alterations that <b>consumed</b> <b>the</b> summer months, Wisconsin sailed for South American waters.|$|E
5|$|Refined {{sugar is}} made from raw sugar that has {{undergone}} a refining process to remove the molasses. Raw sugar is sucrose which is extracted from sugarcane or sugar beet. While raw sugar can be <b>consumed,</b> <b>the</b> refining process removes unwanted tastes and results in refined sugar or white sugar.|$|E

The Cambodian civil war led to the Cambodian Genocide, one of the bloodiest in history.|$|E
5|$|Although it {{is still}} {{commonly}} parboiled before preparation, evidence suggests that even this procedure may not make Gyromitra esculenta entirely safe for consumption. When <b>consumed,</b> <b>the</b> principal active agent, gyromitrin, is hydrolyzed into the toxic compound monomethylhydrazine (MMH). The toxin affects the liver, central nervous system, and sometimes the kidneys. Symptoms of poisoning involve vomiting and diarrhea several hours after consumption, followed by dizziness, lethargy and headache. Severe cases may lead to delirium, coma and death after five to seven days.|$|E
5|$|Antlion larvae {{are capable}} of {{capturing}} and killing a variety of insects and other arthropods, and can even subdue small spiders. The projections in the jaws of the larva are hollow and through this, the larva sucks the fluids out of its victim. After the contents are <b>consumed,</b> <b>the</b> dry carcass is flicked out of the pit. The larva readies the pit once again by throwing out collapsed material from the center, steepening the pit walls to the angle of repose.|$|E

5|$|City at the End of Time is a 2008 {{science fiction}} novel by American writer Greg Bear. It was {{published}} in August 2008 by Del Rey in the United States, and Gollancz in the United Kingdom. The story follows three drifters in present-day Seattle who are tormented by strange dreams of the Kalpa, a city one hundred trillion years in the future. The Kalpa is attempting {{to ward off the}} Typhon, an inexplicable entity that has <b>consumed</b> <b>the</b> rest of the ancient universe and broken down the laws of physics.|$|E
5|$|During the September term, a {{jury was}} finally selected, {{and the trial}} <b>consumed</b> <b>the</b> rest of the term. Much of the same {{evidence}} was presented, and the second jury also voted for a guilty verdict. The date for Desha's execution was set for July 14, 1826. Harry O. Brown, {{the judge in the}} case, had been temporarily appointed by Governor Desha to fill a vacancy. He set aside the verdict, ruling that the prosecution had failed to prove that the murder occurred in Fleming County, as charged in the indictment. The prosecution unsuccessfully argued that because a change of venue had already been granted, the place of the murder was immaterial.|$|E
5|$|The Army Corps of Engineers {{commenced}} work on The Dalles Dam in 1952 {{and completed}} it five years later. On March 10, 1957, hundreds of observers looked on as a rising Lake Celilo rapidly silenced the falls, submerged fishing platforms, and <b>consumed</b> <b>the</b> village of Celilo, ending an age-old existence {{for those who}} lived there. A small Native American community exists today at nearby Celilo Village, on a bluff overlooking the former location of the falls.|$|E

5|$|The {{infantry}} of the Jin {{were armed}} with fire lances. The fire lance was a spear, with {{a tube of}} gunpowder attached to it. The mixture contained, besides the gunpowder ingredients of sulfur, charcoal, and saltpeter, ground porcelain and iron filings. The flame that shot from the lance reached a distance of three meters. The heated tinder that ignited the weapon was stored in a small iron box toted by the Jurchen soldiers in battle. Once the gunpowder was <b>consumed,</b> <b>the</b> fire lance could be wielded like a normal spear, or replenished by a new tube filled with gunpowder.|$|E
5|$|The plumage of {{both sexes}} in both species are almost identical, with the only {{difference}} being iris colour in the lesser melampitta, the male having a red iris and the female a brown one. The plumage of juvenile lesser melampittas {{is the same as}} adults except they are brown on the lower body. Several researchers have noted that the plumage of juvenile greater melampittas resembles that of the hooded pitohui. Hooded pitohuis are unusual for birds in having a toxin, homobatrachotoxin, in their feathers and skin which can cause convulsions and death if <b>consumed.</b> <b>The</b> resemblance is probably an example of Batesian mimicry as the greater melampitta is not itself poisonous.|$|E
5|$|There {{have been}} a few {{instances}} of general population poisoning as the result of long-term exposure to cadmium in contaminated food and water, and research into an estrogen mimicry that may induce breast cancer is ongoing. In the decades leading up to World War II, mining operations contaminated the Jinzū River in Japan with cadmium and traces of other toxic metals. As a consequence, cadmium accumulated in the rice crops along the riverbanks downstream of the mines. Some members of the local agricultural communities <b>consumed</b> <b>the</b> contaminated rice and developed itai-itai disease and renal abnormalities, including proteinuria and glucosuria.|$|E

5|$|A single {{spotted hyena}} can eat at least 14.5kg of meat per meal. Although spotted hyenas act aggressively {{toward each other}} when feeding, they {{compete with each other}} mostly through speed of eating, rather than by {{fighting}} as lions do. When feeding on an intact carcass, spotted hyenas will first consume the meat around the loins and anal region, then open the abdominal cavity and pull out the soft organs. Once the stomach, its wall and contents are <b>consumed,</b> <b>the</b> hyenas will eat the lungs and abdominal and leg muscles. Once the muscles have been eaten, the carcass is disassembled and the hyenas carry off pieces to eat in peace. Spotted hyenas are adept at eating their prey in water: they have been observed to dive under floating carcasses to take bites, then resurface to swallow. A single hyena can take less than two minutes in eating a gazelle fawn, while a group of 35 hyenas can completely consume an adult zebra in 36 minutes. Spotted hyenas do not require much water, and typically only spend 30 seconds drinking.|$|E
5|$|Amanita regalis is poisonous. A case of {{poisoning}} {{was reported}} from Finland, where three individuals {{believed they had}} <b>consumed</b> <b>the</b> edible parasol mushroom Macrolepiota procera. The symptoms of poisoning, which began 1–2hours after ingestion of the mushrooms, were gastrointestinal—nausea and heavy vomiting. Two had central nervous system manifestations and cholinergic symptoms, including hallucinations, confusion, or loss of consciousness as well as profuse salivation and sweating. All three individuals recovered within 4–24hours without any damage to liver, kidneys or the central nervous system. As this incident demonstrates, cooking the mushrooms does not completely neutralize the toxic components of Amanita regalis. Chemical analysis has shown that this species contains ibotenic acid and muscimol, the same toxic constituents as Amanita muscaria.|$|E

50|$|According {{to local}} mythology, Agni deva, the Hindu god of fire, had been {{suffering}} from a severe stomach ailment. As a remedy, Lord Brahma advised him to <b>consume</b> <b>the</b> herb-rich Khandava Forest. The forest was home to serpent-king Takshaka, {{a close friend of}} Lord Indra. Whenever Agni tried to <b>consume</b> <b>the</b> forest, Lord Indra’s thundershowers dutifully extinguished the fire.|$|R
5|$|Armed {{with an air}} gun, Huseby {{threatened}} a cabin attendant and told the captain to proceed as planned to Fornebu. He claimed (falsely) to have placed explosives on board. His demands were to make a political statement and talk to Prime Minister Kåre Willoch and Minister of Justice Mona Røkke. The plane landed at 15:30 at Fornebu and was surrounded by the police. After one hour, Huseby released 70 hostages in exchange for having the aircraft being {{moved closer to the}} terminal building. Thirty minutes later, Huseby released the remaining passengers. He drank throughout the incident, and at 17:30, after he <b>consumed</b> <b>the</b> plane's beer supply, he surrendered his weapon in exchange for more beer. The plane was immediately stormed and Huseby arrested.|$|E
5|$|Desha's {{trial began}} January 17, 1825, in Cynthiana. William K. Wall, Commonwealth's Attorney for Harrison County, was the prosecutor, {{assisted}} by Fleming County Commonwealth's Attorney (and future Congressman) John Chambers and Martin P. Marshall. Rowan, {{who had just}} been elected to the U.S. Senate, was Desha's primary defense counsel, assisted by the governor's Secretary of State (and later U.S. Senator) William T. Barry, former Congressman William Brown, T. P. Taul, and James Crawford. It took two days to empanel a jury. Witness testimony <b>consumed</b> <b>the</b> next week, and Governor Desha attended each day of the trial. The closing statements of Rowan and Barry, both known as outstanding orators, took several days, and Chambers spoke last.|$|E

One cleric goes to investigate, and finds the crack has grown wider, but then is soon {{consumed}} by it. Amy remembers this cleric, but none of the others do, as he had been erased from time. The crack continues to grow, and soon the other clerics are similarly <b>consumed.</b> <b>The</b> Doctor directs Amy to keep her eyes closed and work her way to the secondary control room, hoping that the Angels will not recognise that her eyes are shut. Amy falters and trips, but as the Angels move in, River is able to teleport her to the secondary control room, rescuing her.|$|E
