40|$|<b>Cardiac</b> <b>glycosides,</b> {{also known}} as {{cardiotonic}} steroids, are a group of natural products that share a steroid-like structure with an unsaturated lactone ring {{and the ability to}} induce cardiotonic effects mediated by a selective inhibition of the Na(+) /K(+) -ATPase. <b>Cardiac</b> <b>glycosides</b> have been used for many years in the treatment of cardiac congestion and some types of cardiac arrhythmias. Recent data suggest that <b>cardiac</b> <b>glycosides</b> may also be useful in the treatment of cancer. These compounds typically inhibit cancer cell proliferation at nanomolar concentrations, and recent high-throughput screenings of drug libraries have therefore identified <b>cardiac</b> <b>glycosides</b> as potent inhibitors of cancer cell growth. <b>Cardiac</b> <b>glycosides</b> can also block tumor growth in rodent models, which further supports the idea that they have potential for cancer therapy.

25|$|On Oahu, a white morph of {{the monarch}} has emerged. This {{is because of}} the introduction, in 1965 and 1966, of two bulbul species, Pycnonotus cafer and Pycnonotus jocosus. They are now the most common {{insectivore}} birds, and probably the only ones preying on insects as large as the monarch. Monarchs in Hawaii are known to have low <b>cardiac</b> <b>glycoside</b> levels, but the birds may also be tolerant of the chemical. The two species hunt the larvae and some pupae from the branches and undersides of leaves in milkweed bushes. The bulbuls also eat resting and ovipositing adults, but rarely flying ones. Because of its color, the white morph has a higher survival rate than the orange one. This is either because of apostatic selection (i.e. the birds have learned the orange monarchs can be eaten), because of camouflage (the white morph matches the white pubescence of milkweed or the patches of light shining through foliage), or because the white morph does not fit the bird's search image of a typical monarch, so is thus avoided.|$|E

40|$|It is now {{generally}} agreed that Na+−K+adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase), a transport enzyme derived from the sarcolemmal sodium pump, is the primary site at which digitalis exerts its effects on the myocardial cell. Inhibition of the ability of this ion transport enzyme to catalyze Na+efflux from the cell in exchange for K+leads to both the therapeutic and toxic effects of the <b>cardiac</b> <b>glycosides.</b> The mechanism by which digitalis inhibits the sodium pump {{has been established in}} studies of Na+−K+ATPase which shpw that the ability of <b>cardiac</b> <b>glycosides</b> to inhibit adenosine triphosphate (ATP) -supported transport of Na+is reduced in the presence of elevated levels of K+.
