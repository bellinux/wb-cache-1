30|$|Statements {{of purpose}} (SoPs), {{also known as}} {{personal}} statements, are self-narrative essays required by the graduate application processes of most universities in the West. The SoP {{is arguably the most}} significant piece of writing during the transition between undergraduate and graduate studies since it is often the only discursive space among the required graduate application documents that is fully controlled by the applicant. Nevertheless, the SoP remarkably differs from other academic genres mainly produced by undergraduate writers: it tends to be a fairly short, personal and open-ended text with <b>considerable</b> <b>disciplinary</b> variations (Chiu, 2015, 2016; Samraj & Monk, 2008). Even within the same discipline, different graduate programs may vary in criteria for evaluating submitted SoPs. Such program-specific information is often opaque, which, combined with the fact that authentic samples of successful SoPs are not readily accessible to prospective SoP writers, makes the SoP a “semi-occluded” genre (Samraj & Monk, 2008; Swales, 1996). Consequently, many graduate applicants consider SoP writing as an exceedingly daunting task and this challenge has been further intensified by the lack of institutional support for SoP writing at many universities (Dubb, 2011).|$|E

An analysis of language of publication, patterns of co-authorship and mode of publication in the publishing records of 157 former fellows from a highly selective EU-supported post-doctoral program in economics, social and political science, history and law, indicates <b>considerable</b> <b>disciplinary</b> variation (e. g. ‘English-only’ co-authoring in economics; substantial multilingual publishing in the other disciplines). On the basis of semi-structured interviews with fellows publishing in from two to four languages, policy forces influencing language choice are identified and three patterns of multilingual publishing linked to projected and actual career trajectories are described. The study provides evidence of the impact of national and EU-level policies and practices on publishing choices during the doctoral and post-doctoral phases, while highlighting the role of disciplinary identity and related social practices. It also underlines the need to assume a critical perspective on the equation often drawn between English-language publishing and ‘internationality’...|$|E

40|$|The {{academic}} homepage {{is now a}} ubiquitous {{genre of}} scholarly life, but despite considerable interest in issues of identity and the ways individuals self-consciously manage the impression they give of themselves, it {{has been slow to}} attract the attention of ESP researchers. This may be because of the institutional control exercised by employing universities over this genre which tends to marginalize its subjects. The personal homepages of academics, however, offer <b>considerable</b> insights into <b>disciplinary</b> communities and the construction of a public identity in the context of corporate branding. In this paper, I explore 100 academic homepages in two contrasting fields, subdivided by rank and gender, to identify the extent of this marginalization and the space remaining to academics. Through an analysis of what is said and how it is presented, as text, design and hyperlinks, I show how individuals are positioned by corporate discourses yet manage to carve a sense of self to assert professional credibility. The analysis shows something of how language interacts with other semiotic resources in this environment and how seniority, gender and disciplinary membership cross-cut institutional representations of academics as employees. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd. postprin...|$|R
40|$|Because of an {{overwhelming}} interest in translation in recent years, Translation Studies has attracted <b>considerable</b> attention. Its <b>disciplinary</b> {{expansion in the}} 1990 s has greatly increased its visibility. Yet its identity is still somewhat obscure, if not confusing. Translation Studies has borrowed theoretical paradigms and research methodologies from other disciplines, thus generating hybrid formations of transdisciplinarity. Thus it tends to focus on investigating the cross-cultural and interdisciplinary process of recognition, construction, confrontation, and transformation, which involves meaning, interpretation, signification, and representation. With dimensions of cultural and social attitudes, discourses, and myriad forms of power brought into Translation Studies to address the complex nature of translation practice, the subject has inevitably acquired an interdisciplinary identity. In an increasingly globalized world, academic research in China has long extricated itself from its past state of isolation. China has seen an unprecedented boom in Translation Studies thanks to its intercultural interaction with the outside world, brought about by massive translation practice, and Chinese translation scholars manifest an eagerness {{to learn from the}} West and also to play an active role in promoting the development of the discipline. Translation Studies purports to probe into the implications of translation strategies and resulting discourses, including conditions of signification and politics of appropriation...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} a corpus-based analysis {{of variation in}} the distribution and function of modals and {{their role in the}} expression of “stance ” in a corpus of 600 research articles (RAs) across twelve disciplines. Stance is an expression of attitudes, judgments, or assessments towards the truth of propositions (Biber et al., 1999), and part of the important function of claiming and confirming membership of discourse communities and therefore in constructing identity. Three functional categories of modals perform a valuable role in the construction of stance: Possibility/Ability, Obligation/Necessity, and Prediction (Biber et al., 1999). However, very little research seems to have investigated variation across disciplines or their use in the RA. The corpus was analysed using WordSmith Tools (Scott, 2004), followed by manual checking of the function of every occurrence. Inter- and intra-rater agreement was also checked. Many statistically significant disciplinary differences were found, along with numerous marked differences with individual modals. Further examination of the corpus revealed <b>considerable</b> <b>disciplinary</b> variation in the patterns and verbs associated with the target modals, and a number of sub-functions of the topics covered by the modals. Conclusions are that modals perform {{an important role in the}} construction of stance...|$|E

40|$|This is {{a report}} on the second on our series of {{seminars}} on the contexts and consequences of use of new information and communication technologies for children and young people, with a particular focus on the implications of technological change of formal and informal education. The fi rst seminar scoped key theoretical frameworks, focusing on questions of age and development, on social approaches to technological change, and to diverse notions of learning. The report, titled ‘Theorising the benefi ts of new technology for youth: Controversies of learning and development’ can be freely downloaded from [URL] esrcseries/home/index. php. Seminar 2 concerned questions of space. As John Coleman explained in introducing the seminar, fi rst we were interested in learning environments, seeking to understand how changing spatio-technical arrangements are affecting the learning environment in the classroom, school, home and community. The traditional notion of group learning in a classroom seems to be under question, while maximising the benefi ts from fl exible new technologies still requires serious consideration. While educationalists are rethinking formal learning environments, young people themselves are using new technologies for informal learning in a far wider array of social settings, public and private, shared and individual. Alan Prout gave the fi rst paper on ‘Changing childhood in a globalizing world’. His focus was on the intricate and shifting relations between spatial and temporal constraints on learning, drawing on the ‘Beyond Current Horizons project, conducted with Nick Lee, funded by the DCSF and based at Futurelab. Taking a Deleuzian approach, he argued against a purely social constructivist account of childhood, pointing to the materialities of both school spaces and learning technologies as potentially enabling but more often constraining educational opportunities. These constraints include a strong time ordering such that children’s lives are divided into time for preparation and time for performance, this occupying much of the week and, particularly, structuring ‘free time’ at home. <b>Considerable</b> <b>disciplinary</b> resources of both parents and teachers are occupied in ensuring the effectiveness of this time ordering. While new technologies might potentially disrupt this order, or introduce alternative forms of fl exibility, Prout argued that more often they are pressed into service so as to continue and extend the regulated and disciplined use of time and space for pupils. The second paper, by Gill Valentine, focused in on ‘Home-school links: the implications of ICT for sites of learning and spaces of childhood’. She critically examined the optimistic policies linking ICT and learning in educational policy for the coming decade, identifying potential diffi culties: one such is the different styles of learning associated with home and school, differences that may enable children to learn well in different settings and which, arguably, are undermined by technologies that blur home-school boundaries. While the hope is that experimental and pleasurable styles of learning will extend from home to school, the concern is that the reverse will happen, with disaffection or boredom associated with formal learning undermining prospects for informal learning. There are, to be sure, some good examples of school experimenting with new and creative ICT-mediated homeschool links, but there are some significant barriers impeding such policies also. Valentine particularly outlined the infl uence of traditional forms of socioeconomic stratifi cation, resulting in middle class children gaining more from the introduction of ICT into learning, especially at home, than less privileged children. How then, she asked, shall we re-imagine the school of the future? These re-imaginings were given concrete form in the third paper, by Steve Moss, in his talk ‘Future spaces: future learning’. Reporting on plans for the Building Schools for the Future programme, he charted the challenges for teachers and educationalists in imagining learning spaces in a future that does not yet exist. Over and again, he argued, it is our failures of imagination that lead us to reproduce the familiar, to the detriment of more radical visions of how things could be different. This pessimistic observation is in confl ict, he went on to argue, with the valid imperative to consult and engage with pupils and teachers when re-envisioning future schools. One must engage, clearly, yet this risks repeating conservative visions. For example, Steve Moss observes that in designing new school structures in recent years, the exterior as presented to the community is often more radical than that traditional set of classrooms reproduced within the walls. Some examples, however, maximise the potential of ICTs in redesigning classrooms also – changing spatial arrangements among pupils and between pupils and teachers both by altering the formal/ informal learning spaces and the virtual/physical spaces for learning. Each paper gave rise to a lively discussion from our diverse and expert audience, and some of the discussion is captured {{in the body of the}} report. Inevitably more questions were raised than answers provided, but the questions are important ones, and merit our serious attention if ICTs are to benefi t children’s learning in the years to come...|$|E
40|$|Reflecting {{changes in}} the nature of governance, some have {{questioned}} whether Public Administration is now an historical anachronism. While a legitimate debate exists between sceptics and optimists, this special issue demonstrates grounds for optimism by indicating the continuing diversity and adaptability of the field of Public Administration. In this introduction, we first sketch the variety of intellectual traditions which comprise the field of modern Public Administration. We then consider institutional challenges facing the subject given <b>considerable</b> pressures towards <b>disciplinary</b> fragmentation, and ideological challenges arising from a new distrust of public provision in the UK. Despite these challenges, Public Administration continues to provide a framework to analyse the practice of government and governance, governing institutions and traditions, and their wider sociological context. It can also directly inform policy reform - even if this endeavour can have its own pitfalls and pratfalls for the 'engaged' academic. We further suggest that, rather than lacking theoretical rigour, new approaches are developing that recognise the structural and political nature of the determinants of public administration. Finally, we highlight the richness of modern comparative work in Public Administration. Researchers can usefully look beyond the Atlantic relationship for theoretical enhancement and also consider more seriously the recursive and complex nature of international pressures on public administration...|$|R
