5000|$|JCB HMEE The NZ Army has six High Mobility Engineer Excavators (HMEEs) (also {{known as}} the <b>Combat</b> Engineer <b>Tractor),</b> which were {{delivered}} in January 2011.|$|R

50|$|The Terrier {{vehicle is}} an air-transportable {{armoured}} combat engineer {{vehicle for the}} Royal Engineers. It is being developed as a replacement vehicle for the FV180 <b>Combat</b> Engineer <b>Tractor</b> used by the British Army.|$|R
50|$|Later {{projects}} {{included the}} Heavy Dummy Axle (HDA); the Eager Beaver Air Portable Fork Lift Truck (APFLT) from roughly 1969-1973, the Bar Mine Layer; the Light Mobile Digger (LMD) trench digging machine, and the manufacture and {{assembly of the}} FV180 <b>Combat</b> Engineer <b>Tractor</b> from 1978 to 1983, although ROF Leeds was also heavily involved in production of this vehicle.|$|R
50|$|Lighter {{and less}} multi-functional than the CEVs or AEVs {{described}} above, these vehicles {{are designed to}} conduct earth-moving work on the battlefield. These vehicles have greater high speed mobility than traditional heavy equipment and are protected against the effects of blast and fragmentation. Good examples are the American M9 ACE and the UK FV180 <b>Combat</b> Engineer <b>Tractor.</b>|$|R
5000|$|FV4203 AVRE {{vehicles}} were {{almost identical to}} the Chieftain ARV, also based on the AEV (Winch), but added a dozer blade/bucket, deployable bridge, {{and the ability to}} launch a roadway. [...] The project was cancelled in favour of completing normal engineering operations with the lightly armoured <b>Combat</b> Engineer <b>Tractor</b> (CET) while retaining the Centurion AVRE in frontline service.|$|R
50|$|The FV180 <b>Combat</b> Engineer <b>Tractor</b> or C.E.T. is an amphibious {{specialist}} {{armoured vehicle}} of the British Army {{and has been}} in general service since 1976. A tracked, lightly armoured vehicle, with amphibious capability, the CET is used by Royal Engineers in ground preparation for bridge construction and towing activities in the front line of battle, such as digging vehicle fighting pits, constructing earthen barriers, repairing roads, recovery of disabled vehicles from water and other obstacles, preparing riverbanks for vehicle crossings and clearing obstacles.|$|R
50|$|In June 2012 Battlefront, The East England Military Museum, {{moved to}} hangars at Old Buckenham Airfield. Their base at the {{airfield}} contains over 5,000 exhibits, currently not on display to the public. In October 2012 {{it was announced}} that the airfield and museum would collaborate on a new show called Military Revival Promotional videos were released, showing a Citroen Van being destroyed by a FV180 <b>Combat</b> Engineer <b>Tractor</b> and a lawn mower being flattened by an unexploded World War II German bomb.|$|R
50|$|A {{clam shell}} front bucket and side mounted {{excavator}} arm {{will allow the}} vehicle to perform earth moving and obstable removing tasks. It will have mine protection and can be operated by remote control from up to 1000 m in dangerous environments such as mine clearance. In normal operations {{it will have a}} crew of two. It will have enhanced modular armour and will be faster at up to 70 km per hour and more mobile than the FV180 <b>Combat</b> Engineer <b>Tractor,</b> and will have 360 degree day and night vision systems.|$|R
50|$|In the {{amphibious assault}} on Tarawa in late 1943 the LVTs were first used for amphibious assault {{in order to}} {{negotiate}} the barrier reef and arrive to the most heavily defended beaches the Americans ever met in the Pacific. This {{was also the first}} usage of the LVT-2 Water Buffalo in <b>combat.</b> 2nd Amphibian <b>Tractor</b> Battalion LVTs took part in the first, second and third waves of landings, and carried the continuous supply of ammunition, reinforcements, and ferrying back of the injured. Of 125 vehicles used (50 new LVT-2 and 75 LVT-1), only 35 remained operational {{by the end of the}} first day. Still, a number managed to successfully ferry men and supplies across the coral reef and through the shallows to the beach.|$|R
