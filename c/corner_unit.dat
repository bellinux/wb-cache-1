Daugherty's brothers, Leonard, Emmitt, and Laford, worked for the shop, with Leonard serving as a manager overseeing deliveries and purchases. Their sons, along with Daugherty's sons, all worked at the store and remained working there until its closing in 1985. All employees were trained to be familiar with the store's merchandise, including demonstrating Singer sewing machines. Employees also provided repair services, both in-store and in the homes of customers. Many employees lived in the upstairs apartments, and Daugherty lived in the <b>corner</b> <b>unit</b> and oversaw the company until his death in 1985.|$|E
50|$|Typical of TVR {{there was}} to be a change of name during {{the early stages of the}} {{production}} run. Originally it began life as the TuscanR (A natural follow on from the infamous Tuscan Racers (TVR Tuscan Challenge) that the cars were to replace) but as TVR launched the T350 road car it was deemed that the racers should be referred going forward as T400R. At this same time a few cosmetic changes were made to the shell, most notably the design of the rear light clustre changed from a single top <b>corner</b> <b>unit</b> per side to a set of smaller, individual, circular lights down each side.|$|E

The original 1923 plan for the building provided three units on each floor with additional maids’ rooms on the roof, but in 1924, the building’s upper spaces were constructed to provide the grand duplex for Nast. Connected by a staircase to the rooftop entertaining salons, the <b>corner</b> <b>unit</b> at the top floor was redesigned to be private family quarters. The whole unit was decorated in the French manner by Elsie de Wolfe. Completed in 1925, Conde Nast’s duplex penthouse was used for many lavish parties, which were made famous as much by guest lists as by the entertainment.|$|E

50|$|The two-story {{structure}} was built with retail {{space on the}} ground floor and offices and (in the case of the south bay), apartments on the second. The ground floor has large display windows which are modern replacements; originally, the corner bays were divided into two storefronts, separated by a sidewalk door leading to the second floor. Above the windows, the <b>corner</b> <b>unit</b> retains its original Luxfer prism windows, while the middle bay's have been replaced with panes of regular glass. A wide band of decorated terra cotta separates the two floors. Upstairs windows are paired one-over-one sashes, with lintels made of brick with terra cotta blocks. A terra cotta cornice projects from the façade. The ground floor of the south unit has been modified with tall windows between heavy wooden pilasters. A wooden molding joins the corner units' terra cotta molding, which together with a row of ashlar on the cornice gives continuity to the new and old portions of the building.|$|E
40|$|The {{synthesis}} {{of a series}} of shape-persistent macrocycles (SPMs) (1 - 4 and 6) comprising different numbers and/or spatial arrangement of meta-substituted tetrafluorobenzene and benzene subunits interlinked with diacetylenes is described. To increase their solubility, all five SPMs were functionalized by four peripheral hexyl chains. These SPMs were assembled from common diacetylene building blocks by a modular synthetic strategy based on palladium and/or copper catalyzed versions of acetylene coupling reactions (oxidative acetylene coupling and Cadiot-Chodkiewicz coupling). The aggregation properties in chloroform of SPMs 1 - 6 were investigated by concentration-and temperature-dependent H- 1 -NMR investigations and by vapour pressure osmometry studies. Aggregation constants and thermodynamic data of the process were obtained by least-squares fitting of the NMR data and by van`t Hoff analysis respectively. Aggregation was only observed for SPMs 2 - 6 comprising electron deficient tetrafluorobenzene <b>corner</b> <b>units.</b> While dimerization was the major aggregation process for SPMs 3 - 6, the formation of larger aggregates in solution was only observed for SPM 2. The formation of aggregates is in all cases enthalpically driven. As the largest and the smallest enthalpic contribution and entropic loss in the series of aggregating SPMs were found for the two SPMs 3 and 4, each comprising two fluorinated <b>corner</b> <b>units,</b> the spatial arrangement of these subunits within the macrocycle seems to be at least equally important as the ratio of tetrafluorobenzene and benzene moieties. Interestingly, micro-scaled hexagonal rods were formed from SPM 3 upon heating in toluene, presumably consisting of mixtures of oligomers arising from covalently interlinked macrocycles...|$|R

5000|$|The Snowboard Shelf - The {{contestant}}s {{must take}} four snowboards {{and build a}} shelf out of them. Each contestant is given at random one of five different shelf designs, which they must follow. Angela's shelves are assembled with threaded rods, Cory's shelves are ceiling mounted, Simon's shelves are a <b>corner</b> <b>unit</b> that is supported with threaded rods {{on one side and}} a board on the other, Deen's a [...] "pagoda-style" [...] unit, and Matt's design is a more conventional shelf supported by wood and dado joints on both sides. Cory is initially frustrated with the fact that his shelves run perpendicular to how the ceiling joists are run. He uses one snowboard as strapping, but hanging the other three snowboards causes him to get frustrated and fail. Angela fails after trying to notch the room's baseboards with a chainsaw near an electrical outlet in order to make room for the lowest shelf, though her shelf is also not attached to the wall. Deen, after staring at a [...] "dry fit" [...] for some time and not noticing that one shelf bows as a result, manages to fix his error and finish his shelf without Doug's assistance. As for Matt, he uses his snowboards upside down for his shelves, which promptly earns him a fail when his shelves start to bow under a weight test. Simon had arguably the most complicated design, but he manages, with Joey's assistance, to guide it to a pass.|$|E
40|$|A simple {{model for}} {{two-dimensional}} photonic crystal devices consists of finite number of possibly different circular cylinders centered on lattice points of a square or triangular lattice {{and surrounded by}} a homogeneous or layered background medium. The Dirichlet-to-Neumann (DtN) map method is a special method for analyzing the scattering of an incident wave by such a structure. It is more efficient than existing numerical or semi-analytic methods, such as the finite {{element method and the}} multipole method, since it takes advantage of the underlying lattice structure and the simple geometry of the unit cells. The DtN map of a unit cell is a relation between a wave field component and its normal derivative on the cell boundary, and {{it can be used to}} avoid further computation inside the unit cell. In this paper, an improved DtN map method is developed by constructing special DtN maps for boundary and <b>corner</b> <b>unit</b> cells using the method of fictitious sources. c...|$|E
40|$|In a {{two-dimensional}} (2 D) photonic crystal (PhC) composed of circular cylinders (dielectric rods or air holes) on a square or triangular lattice, various PhC devices {{can be created}} by removing or modifying some cylinders. Most existing numerical methods for PhC devices give rise to large sparse or smaller but dense linear systems, {{all of which are}} expensive to solve if the device is large. In a previous work (Z. Hu et al., Optics Express, 16, 17383 - 17399, 2008), an efficient Dirichlet-to-Neumann (DtN) map method was developed for general 2 D PhC devices with an infinite background PhC {{to take full advantage of}} the underlying lattice structure. The DtN map of a unit cell is an operator that maps the wave field to its normal derivative on the cell boundary and it allows one to avoid computing the wave field in the interior of the unit cell. In this paper, we extend the DtN map method to PhC devices with a finite background PhC. Since there is no bandgap effect to confine the light in a finite PhC, a different technique for truncating the domain is needed. We enclose the finite structure with a layer of empty boundary and <b>corner</b> <b>unit</b> cells, and approximate the DtN maps of these cells based on expanding the scattered wave in outgoing plane waves. Our method gives rise to a relatively small and sparse linear systems that are particularly easy to solve. 1...|$|E

40|$|The {{three-dimensional}} {{structures of}} noncoding RNA molecules reveal recurring architectural motifs {{that have been}} exploited {{for the design of}} artificial RNA nanomaterials. Programmed assembly of RNA nanoobjects from autonomously folding tetraloop–receptor complexes as well as junction motifs has been achieved previously through sequence-directed hybridization of complex sets of long oligonucleotides. Due to size and complexity, structural characterization of artificial RNA nanoobjects has been limited to low-resolution microscopy studies. Here we present the design, construction, and crystal structure determination at 2. 2  Å of the smallest yet square-shaped nanoobject made entirely of double-stranded RNA. The RNA square is comprised of 100 residues and self-assembles from four copies each of two oligonucleotides of 10 and 15 bases length. Despite the high symmetry on the level of secondary structure, the three-dimensional architecture of the square is asymmetric, with all four corners adopting distinct folding patterns. We demonstrate the programmed self-assembly of RNA squares from complex mixtures of <b>corner</b> <b>units</b> and establish a concept to exploit the RNA square as a combinatorial nanoscale platform...|$|R
