The relationship between the oil and water distributions is complex: if the gas storage were to be rebuilt, it must impact the injection volume and gas recovery therefrom and was not conducive to the smooth and efficient operation of the underground gas storage.

However, previous devices need complicated systems {{and do not have}} enough performance. This study proposes a simple tactile sensor that can measure the friction coefficient between a tire and road surface. The sensor is composed of a cantilever called "whisker" that is fixed to a base. The base is an elastic plate, and two strain gauges are attached to its surface. The whisker is passed through the hole opened to the tread of a tire and the sensor is attached to its inner surface. The whisker is covered by a domed rubber; the tip surface is used as the <b>contact</b> <b>part.</b> When the tire slips on a road and the <b>contact</b> <b>part</b> comes in <b>contact</b> with the surface, the vertical load and frictional force are applied to the <b>contact</b> <b>part.</b> Then, whisker is compressed and bended, so that the base is deformed elastically. The induced strains at the base from such deformation are measured by the abovementioned strain gauges. The study proposes the method determining the value of the vertical load and frictional force that acting on the tire from the measured strains and fabricates the prototype tactile sensor to confirm its availability. © 2012 The Japan Society of Mechanical Engineers...|$|R

Fluid flows of high-pressure and high-temperature in the tubes cause oscillating motions between tubes and supports. This is called as FIV (flow induced vibration), which causes fretting wear in <b>contact</b> <b>parts</b> of tube-support. The fretting wear of tube-support can threaten the safety of nuclear power plant. Therefore, a research about the fretting wear characteristics of tube-support is required. This work is focused on fretting wear transitions from mild wear to severe wear of tube-support materials by various loads and relative displacements. The transition is defined {{on the basis of}} the changes in wear amount. To investigate the transition, the fretting wear tester was contrived to prevent the reduction of relative displacement between tube and support by increasing the load. The tube and support materials were Inconel 690 and 409 SS, respectively. The results show that the transition of tube-support wear is caused by the changes of the dominant wear mechanism depending on the applied load and the relative displacement...|$|E

This study used a planar whole body torque-driven computer simulation model of the ground <b>contact</b> <b>parts</b> of all three phases of the triple jump to investigate the effect of strength and approach velocity on optimal performance. The strength and approach velocity of the simulation model were each increased by up to 30 % in 10 % increments from baseline data collected from a national standard triple jumper. Increasing strength always resulted in an increased overall jump distance. Increasing approach velocity also typically resulted in an increased overall jump distance {{but there was a}} point past which increasing approach velocity without increasing strength did not lead to an increase in overall jump distance. Increasing both strength and approach velocity by 10 %, 20 %, and 30 % led to roughly equivalent increases in overall jump distances. Distances ranged from 14. 05 m with baseline strength and approach velocity, up to 18. 49 m with 30 % increases in both. Optimal phase ratios were either hop-dominated or balanced, and typically became more balanced when the strength of the model was increased by a greater percentage than its approach velocity. The range of triple jump distances that resulted from the optimisation process suggests that strength and approach velocity are of great importance for triple jump performance...|$|E

The control of this phenomenon is of major importance in determining the lifetime of fan's disc. When two <b>contact</b> <b>parts</b> are subjected to a load of fretting fatigue, {{there is a strong}} stress gradient from the surface. In these cases, local approaches based on the level of stress at the most critical point, are not appropriate. Non-local approaches have been developed empirically, which are based on critical distance and the stress gradient in the immediate vicinity of the critical point. A second difficulty is the multiaxial nature and non-proportional loading. Fatigue-fretting loading has three main components, the fatigue loading (cyclic), the normal force (usually assumed to be constant) and fretting loading (cyclic but also at a frequency which may differ from that of fatigue). The third point concerns the mechanisms. The stress gradients are seen as beneficial in the sense that a crack initiated at the most critical point can stop due to the presence of the gradient, without leading to the breakdown. To quantify the effect of the gradient, tests on specimens with different gradient were carried out on a fatigue testing contact bench developed at the University of Brasilia. Mechanisms of damage were studied using post-mortem analysis and optical microscopy. The simulation of the fretting fatigue life was done using different approaches.

40|$|The {{reflection}} of ultrasound {{can be used}} to determine oil film thickness in elastohydrodynamic lubricated (EHL) contacts if the opposing surfaces are fully separated by the liquid layer. The proportion of the wave amplitude reflected depends on the stiffness of the liquid layer, which is a function of its bulk modulus and thickness. However, in many practical applications, boundary or mixed film lubrication is a common occurrence as the nominal thickness of the separating film is of a similar order to the height of the surface asperities. The reflection is then dependent on both the liquid contact and solid <b>contact</b> <b>parts</b> and the total interfacial stiffness is the controlling parameter. In this paper an investigation was carried to study the {{reflection of}} ultrasonic waves from the lubricated contact between a sliding steel ball and a flat steel disc when substantial solid contact occurs. To interpret the ultrasonic reflection results, a mixed regime model for a circular point contact was established. The liquid film stiffness was calculated by using a predicted film thickness and a bulk modulus estimated from published rheological models of lubricants under high pressure. Solid contact stiffness was predicted using a statistical rough surface contact model. Under all operating conditions, the prediction of fluid stiffness was found to be much greater than the solid contact stiffness. The total stiffness predicted by the model showed good agreement with experimental measurements for kinematic cases. The model was used to separate the stiffness contributions from the asperity contact part and lubricant layer part from the experimental data. For contact pressures ranging from 0. 42 to 0. 84 GPa and sliding speed from zero to 2 m=s, the film thickness was found to vary from 0. 01 to 0. 8 lm, and the proportion of the load supported by asperity contact varied from 50...|$|E
