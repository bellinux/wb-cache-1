40|$|The {{digestive}} tract of the <b>common</b> <b>woodlouse,</b> Tracheoniscus rathkei Brandt (Isopoda: Oniscoidea), contains digestive enzymes active against α- 1, 4 -glucans, {{which are the}} chief storage polysaccharides of vascular plants, algae, fungi, and animals, and β- 1, 3 -glucans, which are present in algae and fungi. Digestive tract extracts also exhibit significant activity toward xylan and carboxymethyl-cellulose but negligible activity toward microcrystalline cellulose, substrates representative of the major structural polysaccharides of vascular plants. Low activity was detected toward pectin, and no activity was detected toward chitin. Activity toward xylan {{is due in part}} to microbial enzymes acquired from the leaf litter which was the isopod's normal food. Although ingested microbial xylanases are stable and active in the gut fluid, they do not make a quantitatively significant contribution to the isopod's ability to assimilate the hemicellulosic component of its diet. However, the assimilation of carbon from labeled plant fiber is enhanced in isopods which have acquired a cellulase by ingestion of leaf litter amended with a commercial preparation of the cellulase complex from the fungus, Penicillium funiculosum. This result demonstrates the potential contribution of acquired enzymes to the digestion of plant fiber in terrestrial detritivores. We urge caution, however, in assigning an important digestive function to ingested enzymes on the basis of evidence that only indicates that such enzymes are present in the gut fluid without additional evidence that their presence results in an enhancement of digestive efficiency...|$|E

40|$|The <b>common</b> garden <b>woodlouse</b> (Porcellio scaber) {{is known}} to {{alternate}} turns (correcting behaviour), but the function of this behaviour is only poorly understood. We investigated Hughes' (1967) hypothesis that this behaviour enables woodlice to escape efficiently from unfavourable environmental conditions by considering the effect of contact with a predator, a potentially unfavourable environmental condition {{that has not been}} nvestigated previously. In experiments, woodlice alternated turns more frequently after contact with a known predator of woodlice (Dysdera crocata) than after contact with cotton wool or a nonpredatory arthropod (housefly, Musca domestica). ...|$|R
40|$|Studies of {{the effects}} of endocrine-disrupting {{compounds}} (EDCs) on invertebrates are still largely underrepresented. This work aims to fill this gap by assessing the effects of bisphenol A (BPA) and vinclozolin (Vz) on the terrestrial isopod Porcellio scaber (<b>common</b> rough <b>woodlouse).</b> Male adult and sexually undifferentiated juvenile woodlice were exposed to the toxicants. Effects on molting regime and growth were investigated independently for males and female woodlice after sexual differentiation. Both chemicals elicited developmental toxicity to P. scaber by causing overall decreased growth. Nevertheless, BPA induced molting, whereas Vz delayed it. Although the LC 50 values for juvenile and adult survival were fairly similar, juvenile woodlice showed an increased chronic sensitivity to both chemicals, and female woodlice were most the sensitive to BPA. We recommend the use of adults, juveniles, female, and male woodlice, as well as a large range of toxicant concentrations, to provide valuable information regarding differential dose responses, effects, and threshold values for EDCs...|$|R

25|$|Predators of Glomeris marginata are {{reported}} to include the starling, the <b>common</b> toad, the <b>woodlouse</b> spider, and hedgehogs. As well as rolling up into a ball for protection, G. marginata produces noxious chemicals to ward off potential predators, as many millipedes do. One to eight drops of a viscid fluid are secreted, containing quinazolinone alkaloids, dissolved in a watery protein matrix. These chemicals act as antifeedants and toxins to spiders, insects and vertebrates, and the fluid is sticky enough to entrap the legs of ants. Having completely discharged these chemical defences, it {{can take up to}} four months for the millipede to replenish their supplies.|$|R
40|$|Zoologists {{distinguish}} individual animals using marking techniques. Generally they {{test the}} potential influence of marking on survival only; the influence on behaviour is usually neglected. We evaluated {{the influence of}} two external marking techniques (nail polish and queen-bee marker) on the behaviour of <b>common</b> pill <b>woodlouse,</b> Armadillidium vulgare. The behaviour was examined from two points of view: (1) activity during 24 hours and (2) specific expressions of behaviour (exploring, feeding, resting and hiding) over a 24 hour period. We compared behaviour among woodlice marked with nail polish and queen-bee marker with the unmarked control group during a nine-day experiment. Although {{we did not find}} any influence of marking on survival, there was an evident influence on behaviour in most cases. Generally, in the groups of marked individuals of A. vulgare there were large differences observed against the control group in the overall activity. Activity of marked individuals was significantly reduced and they preferred hiding. The influence of polish and marker on the overall frequencies of behavioural categories was evident, mainly in feeding, resting and hiding. The influence on the frequency of exploring was significant in the polish marked group only...|$|R
40|$|According to the temperature-size rule (TSR), ectotherms {{developing}} {{under cold}} conditions experience slower growth as juveniles but reach a larger size at maturity. Whether temperature alone causes {{this phenomenon is}} unknown, but oxygen limitation {{can play a role}} in the temperature-size relationship. Oxygen may become limited under warm conditions when the resulting higher metabolism creates a greater demand for oxygen, especially in larger individuals. We examined the independent effects of oxygen concentration (10 % and 22 % O 2) and temperature (15 °C and 22 °C) on duration of ontogenic development, which takes place within the maternal brood pouch (marsupium), and juvenile growth in the terrestrial isopod <b>common</b> rough <b>woodlouse</b> (Porcellio scaber). Individuals inside the marsupium undergo the change from the aqueous to the gaseous environment. Under hypoxia, woodlice hatched from the marsupium sooner, but their subsequent growth was not affected by the level of oxygen. Marsupial development and juvenile growth were almost three times slower at low temperature, and marsupial development was longer in larger females but only in the cold treatment. These results show that temperature and oxygen are important ecological factors affecting developmental time and that the strength of the effect likely depends on the availability of oxygen in the environment...|$|R
