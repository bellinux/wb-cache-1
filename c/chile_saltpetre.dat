50|$|Another {{name for}} {{potassium}} nitrate, saltpetre {{has been a}} common ingredient of salted meat since the Middle Ages, but its use has been mostly discontinued due to inconsistent results compared to more modern nitrate and nitrite compounds. Even so, saltpetre is still used in some food applications, such as charcuterie. It {{should not be confused}} with <b>Chile</b> <b>saltpetre</b> or Peru saltpetre, which is sodium nitrate.|$|E
50|$|Nitratine or nitratite, {{also known}} as cubic niter (UK: nitre), soda niter or Chile {{saltpeter}} (UK: <b>Chile</b> <b>saltpetre),</b> is a mineral, the naturally occurring form of sodium nitrate, NaNO3. Chemically it is the sodium analogue of saltpeter. Nitratine crystallizes in the trigonal system, but rarely occurs as well formed crystals. It is isostructural with calcite. It is quite soft and light with a Mohs hardness of 1.5 to 2 and a specific gravity of 2.24 to 2.29. Its refractive indices are nω=1.587 and nε=1.336.|$|E
30|$|Perchlorate is {{identified}} as an environmental contaminant and found in drinking, ground, and surface waters, with its origins being both anthropogenic and natural. In its natural origin, perchlorate was found to originate from atmospheric deposition, possibly from chloride aerosol being exposed to an electrical discharge {{in the presence of}} ozone [1]. In <b>Chile</b> <b>saltpetre</b> [2], perchlorate is found as a natural impurity, and it is also of anthropogenic origin due to its use as solid propellant for rockets, missiles, fireworks, pyrotechnics, flares, matches, ordnance, and explosives [3]. Perchlorate is of toxicological interest because it impairs normal thyroid function by interfering with iodine uptake by the thyroid gland and the production of important thyroid hormones [4, 5]. Iodine-containing hormones are essential for early childhood development [6]. Hypothyroidism, a disorder of the endocrine system in which the thyroid gland does not produce enough thyroid hormone, in early stages of pregnancy bears the risk for impaired physical and mental development of the human foetus [7].|$|E
50|$|Between 1830 and 1850 Chilean silver mining grew at an {{unprecedented}} pace which transformed mining {{into one of}} the country's principal sources of wealth. The rush caused rapid demographic, infrastructural, and economic expansion in the semi-arid Norte Chico mountains where the silver deposits lay. A number of Chileans made large fortunes in the rush and made investments {{in other areas of the}} economy of Chile. By the 1850s the rush was in decline and lucrative silver mining definitely ended in the 1870s. At the same time mining activity in <b>Chile</b> reoriented to <b>saltpetre</b> operations.|$|R
50|$|The {{opening of}} Panama Canal in 1914 caused a severe drop in traffic along Chilean ports due to {{shifts in the}} {{maritime}} trade routes. In addition to this international trade collapsed and state income was reduced to half of its previous value {{after the start of}} the World War I in 1914. The Haber process, first applied on an industrial scale in 1913 and later used as part of Germany's war effort due to its lack of access to Chilean <b>saltpetre,</b> ended <b>Chile's</b> monopoly on nitrate and led to an economic decline in <b>Chile.</b> While <b>saltpetre</b> mining gradually waned in importance copper mining rose, exporting raw materials to a level unprecedented in the history of Chile. By 1929 copper exports had reached the same values as saltpetre exports, and in 1937 the value of copper exports largely surpassed that of saltpetre. In the 1920-1937 period both industries had combined a 70-83% share of the value of Chilean exports.|$|R
40|$|The {{penetration}} oj unknown Central European {{country into}} the South-American markets had - despite the uneasy beginnings - shown remarkable dynamics. In the twenties the Czechoslovak export had rather experimental character and {{as late as}} the year 1927 when the efforts oj its consolidation could be recognized. The external relations between South America and Czechoslovakia were the most intensive after the big economic depression, when in addition to the expanding net oj Embassies other institutions and authorities begun to rise to support the Czechoslovak export.
