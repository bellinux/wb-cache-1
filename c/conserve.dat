5|$|After landing, Young and Duke began {{powering}} {{down some of}} the LM's systems to <b>conserve</b> battery power.

The landing delay caused by the malfunction in the Command/Service Module's main engine necessitated significant modifications to the mission schedule. Apollo 16 would spend one less day in lunar orbit after surface exploration had been completed to afford the crew contingency time to compensate for any further problems and to <b>conserve</b> expendables.

Overall, 13 water molecules {{were found to be}} <b>conserved</b> in at least 45 structures, including two water positions which were found to be <b>conserved</b> in all structures. Of the 13 <b>conserved</b> water molecules, 6 are located at the Ω-loop, forming a dense cluster with hydrogen bonds to residues at the Ω-loop {{as well as to the}} rest of the protein. This layer of <b>conserved</b> water molecules is packed between the Ω-loop and the rest of the protein and acts as structural glue, which could reduce the flexibility of the Ω-loop. A correlation between <b>conserved</b> water molecules and <b>conserved</b> protein residues could in general not be detected, with the exception of the <b>conserved</b> water molecules at the Ω-loop. Furthermore, the evolutionary relationship between the three families, derived from the number of <b>conserved</b> water molecules, is similar to the relationship derived from phylogenetic analysis...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Many <b>conserved</b> {{secondary}} structures {{have been}} identified within <b>conserved</b> elements in the human genome, but {{only a small fraction}} of them are known to be functional RNAs. The evolutionary variations of these <b>conserved</b> secondary structures in human populations and their biological functions have not been fully studied. Results We searched for polymorphisms within <b>conserved</b> secondary structures and identified a number of SNPs within these elements even though they are highly <b>conserved</b> among species. The density of SNPs in <b>conserved</b> secondary structures is about 65 % of that of their flanking, non-conserved, sequences. Classification of sites as stems or as loops/bulges revealed that the density of SNPs in stems is about 62 % of that found in loops/bulges. Analysis of derived allele frequency data indicates that sites in stems are under stronger evolutionary constraint than sites in loops/bulges. Intergenic <b>conserved</b> secondary structures tend to associate with transcription factor-encoding genes with genetic distance being the measure of regulator-gene associations. A substantial fraction of intergenic <b>conserved</b> secondary structures overlap characterized binding sites for multiple transcription factors. Conclusion Strong purifying selection implies that secondary structures are probably important carriers of biological functions for <b>conserved</b> sequences. The overlap between intergenic <b>conserved</b> secondary structures and transcription factor binding sites further suggests that intergenic <b>conserved</b> secondary structures have essential roles in directing gene expression in transcriptional regulation networks. </p...|$|R

5|$|Lemurs {{have low}} basal {{metabolic}} rates (BMR), which helps them to <b>conserve</b> energy {{during the dry}} season, when water and food are scarce. They can optimize their energy use by lowering their metabolic rate to 20% below the values predicted for mammals of similar body mass. The red-tailed sportive lemur (Lepilemur ruficaudatus), for instance, reportedly {{has one of the}} lowest metabolic rates among mammals. Its low metabolic rate may be linked to its generally folivorous diet and relatively small body mass. Lemurs exhibit behavioral adaptations to complement this trait, including sunning behaviors, hunched sitting, group huddling, and nest sharing, in order to reduce heat loss and <b>conserve</b> energy. Dwarf lemurs and mouse lemurs exhibit seasonal cycles of dormancy to <b>conserve</b> energy. Before dry season, they will accumulate fat in white adipose tissue located {{at the base of the}} tail and hind legs, doubling their weight. At the end of the dry season, their body mass may fall to half of what it was prior to the dry season. Lemurs that do not experience states of dormancy are also able to shut down aspects of their metabolism for energy conservation.|$|E
5|$|Other lemurs {{that do not}} exhibit {{dormancy}} <b>conserve</b> {{energy by}} selecting thermoregulated microhabitats (such as tree holes), sharing nests, and reducing exposed body surfaces, such as by hunched sitting and group huddling.
