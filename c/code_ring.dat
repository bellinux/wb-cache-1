40|$|The {{biological}} {{distinction between}} the base positions in the codon, the chemical types of bases (purine and pyrimidine) and their hydrogen bond number {{have been the most}} relevant codon properties used in the genetic code analysis. Now, these properties have allowed us to build a Genetic <b>Code</b> <b>ring</b> isomorphic to the ring (Z 64, +,*) of the integer module 64. On the Z 64 -algebra of the set of 64 ^N codon sequences of length N, gene mutations are described by means of endomorphisms F: (Z 64) ^N->(Z 64) ^N. Endomorphisms and automorphisms helped us describe the gene mutation pathways. For instance, 77. 7 % mutations in 749 HIV protease gene sequences correspond to unique diagonal endomorphisms of the wild type strain HXB 2. In particular, most of the reported mutations that confer drug resistance to the HIV protease gene correspond to diagonal automorphisms of the wild type. What is more, in the human beta-globin gene a similar situation appears where most of the single codon mutations correspond to automorphisms. Hence, in the analyses of molecular evolution process on the DNA sequence set of length N, the Z 64 -algebra will help us explain the quantitative relationships between genes.

40|$|Context. Bubble N 107 was {{discovered}} in the infrared emission of dust in the Galactic Plane observed by the Spitzer Space Telescope (GLIMPSE survey: l ~ 51. 0 deg, b ~ 0. 1 deg). The bubble represents an example of shell-like structures found all over the Milky Way Galaxy. Aims. We aim to analyse the atomic and molecular components of N 107, {{as well as its}} radio continuum emission. With the help of numerical simulations, we aim to estimate the bubble age and other parameters which cannot be derived directly from observations. Methods. From the observations of the HI (I-GALFA) and 13 CO (GRS) lines we derive the bubble's kinematical distance and masses of the atomic and molecular components. With the algorithm DENDROFIND, we decompose molecular material into individual clumps. From the continuum observations at 1420 MHz (VGPS) and 327 MHz (WSRT), we derive the radio flux density and the spectral index. With the numerical <b>code</b> <b>ring,</b> we simulate the evolution of stellar-blown bubbles similar to N 107. Results. The total HI mass associated with N 107 is 5. 4 E 3 Msun. The total mass of the molecular component (a mixture of cold gasses of H 2, CO, He and heavier elements) is 1. 3 E 5 Msun, from which 4. 0 E 4 Msun is found along the bubble border. We identified 49 molecular clumps distributed along the bubble border, with the slope of the clump mass function of - 1. 1. The spectral index of - 0. 30 of a strong radio source located apparently within the bubble indicates nonthermal emission, hence part of the flux likely originates in a supernova remnant, not yet catalogued. The numerical simulations suggest N 107 is likely less than 2. 25 Myr old. Since first supernovae explode only after 3 Myr or later, no supernova remnant should be present within the bubble. It may be explained if there is a supernova remnant in the direction towards the bubble, however not associated with it. Comment: 15 pages, 11 figure...|$|E

Museum samples were extracted in a separate room using a fume hood with UV-light exposure prior to 147 the extraction. Seven microsatellite loci; Lox 1, Lox 2 and Lox 8 (Piertney et al. 1998), Ppi 2 (Martínez et 148 al. 1999), Pocc 6 (Bensch et al. 1997), Pdo 5 (Griffith et al. 1999) and Pk 12 (GenBank accession no. 149 AF 041466) were amplified using the procedure detailed in Barrientos et al. (2009 b). Microsatellites 150 were run on ABI 3730 and scored with GeneMapper v. 3. 7 (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). 151 Part of the mitochondrial control region was amplified using primers TrfinchL 20 and 152 passeriformesH 830 which amplify most of 153 domains I and II of the control region. The museum samples were amplified {{in two or three}} fragments using primers TrfinchL 20 and TrfinchH 465, TrfinchL 410 and PasseriformesH 830, TrfinchL 20 and 155 TrfinchH 262, TrfinchL 208 and TrfinchH 465, TrfinchL 410 and TrfinchH 649 or TrfinchL 585 and 156 PasseriformesH 830. PCR was performed in 10 μl volumes 157 containing about 50 ng of template DNA (1 - 5 μl), 0. 5 μM of each primer (0. 5 μl each), 0. 2 mM of each 158 dNTP (1 μl), 1 μL of 10 x PCR buffer (2. 0 mM MgCl 2) and 0. 06 μl of DNA-polymerase (Biotools, 5 U/ 159 μl). The PCR protocol was 94 ºC for 2 min followed by 37 cycles of 94 ºC for 30 s, 50 ºC for 45 s and 160 72 ºC for 30 s with a final extension in 72 ºC for 5 min. The Egyptian samples required a secondary PCR 161 using 1 μL of the primary PCR product as template. Sequencing of the PCR-products was performed 162 with BigDye v. 3. 1 using primers TrfinchH 262, TrfinchH 465, TrfinchL 410, TrfinchL 585 or 163 PasseriformesH 830. Half of the museum samples were sequenced twice to check for consistency of the 164 sequences. Sequencing reactions were run on an ABI 3730. All sequences are available in GenBank 165 (accession numbers JX 452830 -JX 453004 and JX 453005 -JX 453016).

40|$|The {{main focus}} {{in this thesis}} is linear <b>codes</b> over <b>rings.</b> In the first part, we look at linear <b>codes</b> over Galois <b>rings,</b> and using the {{homogeneous}} weight, we improve upon Wilson's results about the prime power that divides the coefficients of the homogeneous weight enumerators of these codes. We also prove that our results are best possible. Our results about homogeneous weight enumerators of linear <b>codes</b> over Galois <b>rings</b> generalize the results that we have for the Lee weight enumerators of linear <b>codes</b> over the <b>ring</b> of integers modulo 4. We also consider other weight enumerators, in particular the complete weight enumerators of linear codes and we obtain MacWilliams-like identities for these weight enumerators considering different rings. These MacWilliams-like identities lead to MacWilliams identities for the Hamming weight enumerators of linear <b>codes</b> over <b>rings.</b> We also give a counter-example {{to show that we}} cannot have MacWilliams-like identities for the Euclidean weight enumerators of linear <b>codes</b> over the <b>ring</b> of integers modulo 4.

We first give an application of the distance preserving Gray maps to obtain good ternary codes, and then we give an inductive algebraic construction of a distance preserving Gray map from Galois rings with the homogeneous distance to the field of prime size with the Hamming distance as well as a combinatorial construction. By using the Gray maps, we obtain some results about the weight enumerators of linear <b>codes</b> over the <b>ring</b> of dual numbers. In the last part of this work, we consider the permutation invariance of binary codes and the connection with linearity over certain rings.
