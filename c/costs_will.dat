5|$|WSDOT is {{studying}} several different proposed {{changes to the}} SR224 / SR225 intersection to improve traffic flow. Several proposals have been introduced to alleviate the situation, including replacing the stop sign at the intersection with a traffic light, reconfiguring the intersection and the off ramp from I-82, and implementing several options featuring roundabouts. WSDOT favors the roundabout options and estimates <b>costs</b> <b>will</b> range between $2 and $7.4million to construct.|$|E

5|$|Dementia, and {{specifically}} Alzheimer's disease, may {{be among the}} most costly diseases for society in Europe and the United States, while their costs in other countries such as Argentina, and South Korea, are also high and rising. These <b>costs</b> <b>will</b> probably increase with the ageing of society, becoming an important social problem. AD-associated costs include direct medical costs such as nursing home care, direct nonmedical costs such as in-home day care, and indirect costs such as lost productivity of both patient and caregiver. Numbers vary between studies but dementia costs worldwide have been calculated around $160billion, while costs of Alzheimer's disease in the United States may be $100billion each year.|$|E

As 999 BR standard steam locomotives were built in the years up to 1960 the builders consider this is the 1000th locomotive build to be commenced to a British Railways standard design.

Airbus says that it can pursue demand for 4,000 aircraft and says there is an open market for 2,600 jets not already addressed by backlogs with operators already using A330s.

25|$|Balinese Hindu {{dead are}} {{generally}} buried inside the container {{for a period}} of time, which may exceed one month or more, so that the cremation ceremony (Ngaben) can occur on an auspicious day in the Balinese-Javanese Calendar system ("Saka"). Additionally, if the departed was a court servant, member of the court or minor noble, the cremation can be postponed up to several years to coincide with the cremation of their Prince. Balinese funerals are very expensive and the body may be interred until the family can afford it or until there is a group funeral planned by the village or family when <b>costs</b> <b>will</b> be less. The purpose of burying the corpse is for the decay process to consume the fluids of the corpse, which allows for an easier, more rapid and more complete cremation.|$|E

The <b>costs</b> <b>will</b> then be distributed among the over 30 companies who were responsible in polluting the canal, in addition to government entities such as the City of New York and the United States Navy. Some of these companies, such as Brooklyn Union Gas, either no longer exist, have relocated, or have been renamed. If these defunct companies have been incorporated into another company, the property owners and the parent companies were expected to take responsibility, {{in addition to these}} companies that created or moved the pollutants around. The EPA Superfund Gowanus report has identified the major PRPs as National Grid (which later acquired Brooklyn Union Gas' successor KeySpan) and New York City.|$|E

500|$|The {{study also}} include hybrid {{electric}} {{vehicles in the}} comparison, and analyzed several scenarios {{to determine how the}} comparative net savings will change over the next 10 to 20 years, assuming that battery <b>costs</b> <b>will</b> decrease while gasoline prices increase, and also assuming higher fuel efficiency of conventional cars, among other scenarios. Under the future scenarios considered, the study found that BEVs will be significantly less expensive than conventional cars ( [...] to [...] cheaper), while PHEVs, will be more expensive than BEVs in almost all comparison scenarios, and only less expensive than conventional cars in a scenario with very low battery costs and high gasoline prices. The reason for the different savings among PEVs is because BEVs are simpler to build and do not use liquid fuel, while PHEVs have more complicated powertrains and still have gasoline-powered engines. The following table summarizes the results of four of the seven scenarios analyzed by the study.|$|E
500|$|The {{notion that}} {{transport}} costs and trade barriers hinder {{the expansion of}} the market is age-old. Nurkse emphasised that tariff duties, exchange controls, import quotas and other non-tariff barriers to trade are major obstacles to promoting international cooperation in exporting and importing. More specifically, due to high transport costs between nations, producers do not have an incentive to export their commodities. As a result, the amount of capital accumulation remains small. To address this problem, the United Nations produced a report in 1951 with solutions for underdeveloped countries. They suggested that they can expand their markets by forming customs unions with neighbouring countries. Also, they can adopt the system of preferential taxation or even abolish customs duties altogether. The logic was that once customs duties are removed, transport <b>costs</b> <b>will</b> fall. Consequently, prices will fall and thus the demand will rise. However, Nurkse, as an export pessimist, did not agree with this view. Export pessimism is a trade theory which is governed by the idea of [...] "inward looking growth" [...] as opposed to [...] "outward looking growth".
