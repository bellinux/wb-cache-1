25|$|Melchizedek first <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> {{attention}} in June 1990, {{a few months}} after Mark Pedley was paroled from a 1986 conviction. Inquiries were received concerning bank names: Banco de Asia, Guardian Savings & Guaranty and Express Bank among others. Investigations that these entities had bank charters from the DOM and obtained through an entity named Consortium Finance Corporation headquartered in Lake Tahoe, California. Further investigation disclosed a principal alternately named John Hayden and Branch Vinedresser. Shortly thereafter the FBI took Branch Vinedresser into custody and revealed that he was Mark Pedley, who then was charged with violations of his parole.|$|E
25|$|A {{collaboration}} {{is like a}} good conversation, Nicola <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> studio {{a couple of times}} and I went to hers; we initially chatted about her music, the forthcoming album and how this related to her vision for the shoes. I went away and started designing my response to this. After our first meeting I was excited by her ideas and collaborating with people who have a strong vision is really fantastic. Nicola considers everything she does really carefully and has a totally clear view of what she wants to achieve. While the shoes are just a small part of this, I knew it would be interesting and fun to work together.|$|E
25|$|In his 1997 {{submission}} to the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, General Malan described the CCB as follows:"15.1 Let me now {{deal with the}} matter of the CCB. The CCB-organisation as a component of Special Forces was approved in principle by me. Special Forces was an integral and supportive part of the South African Defence Force. The role envisaged for the CCB was the infiltration and penetration of the enemy, the gathering of information and the disruption of the enemy. The CCB was approved as an organisation consisting of ten divisions, or as expressed in military jargon, regions. Eight of these divisions or regions were intended to refer to geographical areas. The area of one of these regions, Region Six, referred to the Republic of South Africa. The fact that the organisation in Region Six was activated, <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> knowledge {{for the first time in}} November 1989. The CCB provided the South African Defence Force with good covert capabilities.|$|E

25|$|Gomez, a {{longtime}} journalist, recalls having met and interviewed Duke {{in the mid-1970s}} when Duke was a state senate candidate:He {{was still in his}} mid-20s and very non-descript. Tall and slimly built, he had a very prominent nose, flat cheek bones, a slightly receding chin and straight dark brown hair. The interview turned out to be quite innocuous, and I hadn't thought about it again until Duke <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> legislative desk, and we shook hands. Who was this guy? Tall and well-built with a perfect nose, a model's cheek bones, prominent chin, blue eyes and freshly coiffed blond hair, he looked like a movie star. He obviously didn't remember from the radio encounter, and I was content to leave it at that.Consistent with Gomez's observation, Duke in the latter 1980s reportedly had his nose thinned and chin augmented. Following his election to the Louisiana House of Representatives, he shaved his mustache.|$|E

[...] Carter decided that an episode based around former war criminals who had received [...] "clemency so [...] could use their science" [...] would be [...] "interesting".|$|E

They honeymooned in Le Grau-du-Roi, where he contracted anthrax, and he planned his next collection of short stories, Men Without Women, {{which was published in}} October 1927, and included his boxing story [...] "Fifty Grand".

500|$|... "Miracle Man" [...] was {{the first}} episode of The X-Files written by Howard Gordon {{without the aid of}} his {{long-term}} collaborator Alex Gansa. The pair had worked on several other series before The X-Files, and had also contributed the episodes [...] "Conduit", [...] "Ghost in the Machine", [...] "Fallen Angel" [...] and [...] "Lazarus" [...] to the series so far. Series creator Chris Carter recalls being asked to collaborate on the episode, saying [...] "Howard <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> house, and said, 'Help me out,' so we went to my living room and put up this bulletin board and {{in a matter of hours}} we came up with this story". Originally the script had called for more overt religious imagery, though censors at Fox objected to depictions of faith healer Samuel being beaten to death whilst in a cruciform pose, leading to scenes being cut.|$|E

[...] On September 27, 2010, Obama released a statement commenting on his religious views saying [...] "I'm a Christian by choice. My family didn't – frankly, they weren't folks who went to church every week. And my mother {{was one of the}} most spiritual people I knew, but she didn't raise me in the church.

500|$|Bharathiraja wanted Chithra Lakshmanan, {{who was an}} {{assistant}} director with K.

When Kamal asked for , Lakshmanan suggested that Bharathiraja offer the role to Sivakumar since the production unit could not afford Kamal's request; however, Bharathiraja saw Kamal as the ideal choice and agreed to pay him [...] For his character, the actor grew his curly hair long and wore lungis and khadi high-buttoned shirts. In 2017, Kamal recalled, [...] "Years ago, a man sporting a soiled dhoti and shirt <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> office to narrate a script. Had I turned the offer down {{on the basis of his}} dirty clothes, I wouldn’t have been here talking to you. After listening to the script, I realised that he was such a genius and the movie was the cult classic , and he was none other than ace Bharathiraja sir". Bharathiraja also recalled that he showed a [...] "handsome Kamal Haasan in an ugly way" [...] as he wanted to prove that characters need not always be attractive, and to break this stereotype in the film industry.|$|E
500|$|Rhodes {{gave him}} 48 hours {{to decide whether}} he wanted to join the new band that would [...] "rival the Pistols". Within 24 hours, Strummer agreed. Simonon later remarked, [...] "Once we had Joe on board it all started to come together." [...] Strummer {{introduced}} the band to his old school friend Pablo LaBritain, who sat in on drums during Strummer's first few rehearsals with the group. LaBritain's stint with the band {{did not last long}} (he subsequently joined 999), and Terry Chimes—whom Jones later referred to as [...] "one of the best drummers" [...] in their circle—became the band's regular drummer. In Westway to the World, Jones also says, [...] "I don't think Terry was officially hired or anything. He had just been playing with us." [...] Chimes did not take to Strummer at first: [...] "He was like twenty-two or twenty-three or something that seemed 'old' to me then. And he had these retro clothes and this croaky voice". Simonon came up with the band's name after they had briefly dubbed themselves the Weak Heartdrops and the Psychotic Negatives. He later explained the name's origin: [...] "It really <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> head when I started reading the newspapers and a word that kept recurring was the word 'clash', so I thought 'the Clash, what about that,' to the others.

500|$|Frank Proffitt, the Appalachian {{musician}} whose {{version of}} [...] "Tom Dooley" [...] the Trio rearranged, watched their {{performance of his}} song on a television show and wrote in reaction, [...] "They clowned and hipswung. Then they came out with 'This time tomorrow, reckon where I’ll be/If it hadn't a' been for Grayson/I'd a been in Tennessee.' I began to feel sorty sick. Like I’d lost a loved one. Tears <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> eyes. I went out and bawled on the ridge." [...] Proffitt had learned the song from {{his father and his}} grandmother, who had known Tom Dula and Laura Foster, the killer and the victim in the actual 1866 murder related in the song. Both Proffitt and fellow North Carolina musician Doc Watson sang the older version of the tune, which had [...] "a lively mocking tempo... that retained some of the ghastliness and moral squalor of an actual murder," [...] according to folk historian Robert Cantwell, who also notes that the Kingston Trio's version of the song left out several verses from the traditional lyric. The slower, harmonized Trio version of the Dooley song and other traditional numbers struck Proffitt as a betrayal of [...] "the strange mysterious workings which has made Tom Dooly [...] live..." [...] As recently as 2006, folk traditionalist and influential banjo master Billy Faier remarked: [...] "I hear and see very little respect for the folk genre" [...] in their music and described the Trio's repertoire as [...] "a mishmash of twisted arrangements that not only obscure the true beauty of the folk songs from which they derive, but give them a meaning they never had." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{deciding}} Game 7 of the 2015 Finals {{was scheduled}} to be played at 7:00 PM on April 30, 2015 at the WFCU Centre in Windsor, Ontario. The Express shootaround was set to take place before that of the Rainmen. The road team was supposed to arrive for warm-ups at approximately 1:00 PM, but entered the stadium approximately two hours earlier. Express assistant coach Gerry Brumpton recounted, [...] "They snuck in here before they even had the light on. We were here in the dark, I opened up the curtain and I looked in and there they were. They were still here working out. So they had been here for a while." [...] The Express told their opponents to leave the arena, but they refused, with one Rainmen player dunking a basketball instead. Windsor's Bill Jones then attempted to take a ball from Halifax center Liam McMorrow, but the player [...] "flinched," [...] pretending to throw a punch. According to Rainmen player Forrest Fisher, Jones tackled McMorrow to the ground and Express guard Tony Bennett followed up by hitting McMorrow with a chair. Referring to the Rainmen, Jones said, [...] "A couple of them kicked me and tried to take swings at me. And my players were there and they <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> rescue {{to be able to get}} me up." [...] Soon the violence escalated, with staff members and players from both teams involved. At around 10:40 AM, Windsor police received a phone call [...] "that between 15 to 20 men were involved in an altercation." [...] By the time they arrived at the WFCU Centre, however, the fighting was over and the Rainmen players had already reached their team bus.|$|E
500|$|... "She Wolf" [...] {{was written}} by Shakira, John Hill, and Sam Endicott. Shakira and Hill also served as the {{producers}} of the song. In an interview with Rolling Stone, Shakira said that the idea for [...] "She Wolf" [...] came to her [...] "very mysteriously", revealing [...] "I was in the studio {{in a bad mood}} that day, then I got inspired and went to a corner and I wrote the lyrics and the melody in 10 minutes. The image of the she wolf just <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> head, and when I least expected it I was howling and panting". Endicott, musician and lead singer of American post-punk band The Bravery, explained how he and Hill began working with Shakira, saying she [...] "contacted him (Hill), asking if he had any stuff. We never had her in mind. We just made the thing independently of her, and then she liked it a lot, and she sang over it. She used some of the melodies we put in there and then wrote these crazy lyrics about being a werewolf. And that's how it happened". [...] "She Wolf" [...] was described by Slant Magazine as a [...] "sleek, hi-NRG/Italo throwback that's drenched in disco strings". Mikael Wood from Spin identified the song's genre as synthpop. Shakira also howls and pants at various times during the song. It is written in B minor key and is a moderate dance groove with a tempo of 120 beats per minute. Shakira's vocal range on the song spans from B3 to D5. One of the lines of the song, in which Shakira sings [...] "I'm starting to feel just a little abused, like a coffee machine in an office", is often cited {{as an example of the}} unusual lyrics present in Shakira's songs.|$|E
