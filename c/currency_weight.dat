The official announcement of the new exchange rate regime in July 2005 with the introduction of a secret currency basket was followed by a smooth appreciation against the US dollar (USD).

40|$|The present paper updates the question: what {{precisely}} is {{the exchange}} rate regime that China has put into place since 2005, when it announced a {{move away from the}} US dollar peg? Is it a basket anchor with the possibility of cumulatable daily appreciations, as was announced at the time? We apply to this question a new approach of estimating countries' de facto exchange rate regimes, a synthesis of two techniques. One is a technique that has been used in the past to estimate implicit de facto <b>currency</b> <b>weights</b> when the hypothesis is a basket peg with little flexibility. The second is a technique used to estimate the de facto degree of exchange rate flexibility when the hypothesis is an anchor to the US dollar or some other single major currency. Because the RMB and many other currencies today purportedly follow variants of band-basket-crawl, {{it is important to have}} available a technique that can cover both dimensions, inferring weights and inferring flexibility. The synthesis adds a variable representing 'exchange market pressure' to the currency basket equation, whereby the degree of flexibility is estimated at the same time as the <b>currency</b> <b>weights.</b> This approach reveals that by mid- 2007, the RMB basket had switched a substantial part of the US dollar's weight onto the euro. The implication is that the appreciation of the RMB against the US dollar during this period was due to the appreciation of the euro against the dollar, not to any upward trend in the RMB relative to its basket.

40|$|This paper {{develops}} {{a basis for}} exchange rate policy coordination for three countries, China, Japan, and Korea.

40|$|In July 2005 the Chinese {{government}} announced a {{switch to a}} new exchange rate regime. The new exchange rate regime is set with reference to a basket of currency. But the numerical <b>weights</b> of each <b>currency</b> in the basket are unannounced. Under economic and political pressures, China adjusted his exchange rate regime, which {{is no longer a}} peg to the US dollar. Subsequently, with the appreciation of the Chinese Yuan, China allowed a movement of the exchange rate up to 3 % within any given day. Perhaps, the new exchange rate policy has an impact on the imports and exports, even other countries' exchange rate policy, the international imbalance and financial market. We argue that China is not really conducting the basket of currency policy after the reform. The Chinese government released the composition of basket currencies and the determinant of <b>currency</b> <b>weights.</b> But the exact weights are still unknown. The methodology and results of this paper are easily summarized. First of all, we use the technique introduced by Frankel and Wei (1994) to estimate the <b>currency</b> <b>weights.</b> We find that the Euro and Japanese Yen are insignificant in the basket in terms of numeraire currency, the Swiss Franc and Special Drawing Rights. The results from Ordinary Linear Square show that China's exchange rate regime remains a peg to the US dollar tightly, because the weight of the US dollar is in exceed of 0. 9. Then, following the regression results, we do F-test, rolling and recursive regression for the basket currencies. Moreover, we use Kalman Filter and Smooth method to test the significance of coefficient of each currency. We find that there is a slight decline of the coefficient, but it has no economic influence. Furthermore, we use Structural Break and Outlier method to test the significance of the coefficient of the currencies. The results show that the US dollar peg is still strong. That's to say, although China is conducting the new exchange rate regime gradually, the exchange rate policy is not a perfect peg to a basket of currency...|$|R

40|$|Exchange rate {{rigidity}} {{is often}} cited {{as one of the}} primary causes of Asia's crisis. However, measured by real effective exchange rates (inflation-adjusted and tradeweighted exchange rates) using consumer prices or wholesale prices, no serious overvaluation is detected in the worst-hit economies during the pre-crisis period. Most of the Asian developing economies permitted their currencies to deviate from the strict dollar peg in the medium to long run in order to offset inflation gaps and movements of major currencies. Counterfactual simulations over the pre-crisis period show that, to stabilize competitiveness, proper adjustments for inflation by individual economies are more important than the choice of <b>currency</b> <b>weights.</b> Adoption of a common currency basket in the region does not add much stability. Pragmatic exchange rate policy rules distinguishing normal and crisis periods are suggested. To stabilize competitiveness during the normal period, no radical reform of the existing system is needed in developing Asia...|$|R

40|$|Recent {{empirical}} {{studies show that}} the Chinese currency renminbi is either becoming or has become a dominant reference currency in East Asia. This paper reviews the evidence with daily exchange rate data from seven East Asian economies namely, Indonesia, Korea, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Taiwan. We consider the likely problems and pitfalls associated with the application of Frankel-Wei regressions to determine the weights of the US dollar and the renminbi in the implicit currency baskets. We show empirically the estimation of <b>currency</b> <b>weights</b> using non-orthogonalised renminbi movements could suffer from imprecision and/or inconsistency. To circumvent the simultaneity bias problem present in most of these regressions, we use country-specific VAR models to take into explicit account the mutual interaction of the exchange rates variables. Impulse response analysis reveals that the US dollar still retains its dominant regional influence but the role of the renminbi in East Asian exchange rate determination has increased after the global financial crisis...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we have {{constructed}} a theoretical {{model in which}} Asian firms maximize their profit, competing with Japanese and US firms in their markets. The duopoly model is used to determine export prices and volumes {{in response to the}} exchange rate fluctuations vis-…-vis the Japanese yen and the US dollar. Then, the optimal basket weight to minimize the fluctuation of the growth rate of trade balance is derived. These are the novel features of our model. The export price equation and export volume equation are estimated for several Asian countries for the sample period of 1981 to 1996. Results are generally reasonable. The optimal <b>currency</b> <b>weights</b> for the yen and the US dollars are derived and compared with actual weights that had been adopted before the currency crisis of 1997. For all the countries in the sample, it is shown that the optimal weight of the yen is significantly higher than the actual weight. ...|$|R
40|$|We {{study how}} the {{financial}} {{conditions in the}} Center Economies [the U. S., Japan, and the Euro area] impact other countries over the period 1986 through 2015. Our methodology relies upon a two-step approach. We focus on five possible linkages between the center economies (CEs) and the non-Center economics, or peripheral economies (PHs), and investigate the strength of these linkages. For {{each of the five}} linkages, we first regress a financial variable of the PHs on financial variables of the CEs while controlling for global factors. Next, we examine the determinants of sensitivity to the CEs as a function of country-specific macroeconomic conditions and policies, including the exchange rate regime, <b>currency</b> <b>weights,</b> monetary, trade and financial linkages with the CEs, the levels of institutional development, and international reserves. Extending our previous work (Aizenman et al., 2016), we devote special attention to the impact of <b>currency</b> <b>weights</b> in the implicit currency basket, balance sheet exposure, and currency composition of external debt. We find that for both policy interest rates and the real exchange rate (REER), the link with the CEs has been pervasive for developing and emerging market economies in the last two decades, although the movements of policy interest rates are found to be more sensitive to global financial shocks {{around the time of the}} emerging markets 2 ̆ 7 crises in the late 1990 s and early 2000 s, and since 2008. When we estimate the determinants of the extent of connectivity, we find evidence that the <b>weights</b> of major <b>currencies,</b> external debt, and currency compositions of debt are significant factors. More specifically, having a higher weight on the dollar (or the euro) makes the response of a financial variable such as the REER and exchange market pressure in the PHs more sensitive to a change in key variables in the U. S. (or the euro area) such as policy interest rates and the REER. While having more exposure to external debt would have similar impacts on the financial linkages between the CEs and the PHs, the currency composition of international debt securities does matter.

40|$|Pegging in {{a coordinated}} {{way to a}} {{regional}} basket currency {{is considered by many}} as optimal for east-Asian countries. By contrast, according to existing empirical studies, these countries have most often relied on non-cooperative United States dollar or G 3 pegs. We show {{for the first time that}} by the late 1990 s, with some reversals, a majority of east-Asian countries had already moved, de facto, away from the dollar peg and started targeting a basket, including east-Asian currencies (an “Asian Currency Unit”). Common-shock or market-based interpretations of such moves are ruled out since we document that, with few exceptions, countries in the region have in reality stuck to fixed exchange rates. We obtain such results using a Markov-switching estimation benchmarked against Bai-Perron structural break tests for the synthesis model of Frankel and Wei (2007), which augments the inference about <b>currency</b> <b>weights</b> in a basket with the weight on exchange-market pressure. In order to measure the latter, the forward positions of central banks in the foreign exchange market are taken into account. asian currency unit; east asian currencies; exchange rate regimes...|$|R

However, results are mixed, in that in some periods, the yen weight seems to be higher in some countries, and in some other periods, the Asian currencies seem to have gone back to the dollar peg. This paper seeks the determinants of the yen <b>weight</b> in Asian <b>currencies.</b> It is found that the yen weight tends to increase when the yen depreciates and when the domestic interest rates rise. The yen weight tends to decrease when the US interest rate rises. Asymmetry is observed among coefficients of variables between the lower and higher yen periods. In addition, the yen weight is less susceptible to the overall position of the US dollar vis-a-vis major currencies.

The central government moved to undercut aristocrats and landowners to gain direct administrative control over the peasantry, who comprised {{the overwhelming majority of}} the population and labor force. This allowed ambitious projects, such as connecting walls along the northern border eventually developed into the Great Wall of China. These projects involved three hundred thousand peasants and convicts. The Qin introduced a range of reforms such as standardized <b>currency,</b> <b>weights,</b> measures, and a uniform system of writing, which aimed to unify the state and promote commerce. Additionally, its military used the most recent weaponry, transportation, and tactics, though the government was heavy-handedly bureaucratic. Han dynasty Confucians portrayed the dynasty as a monolithic tyranny, but this view has been rejected by modern scholars. There was indeed an attempt to restrict criticism and purge traces of old dynasties, but not the alleged burning of books and burying of scholars. Recently excavated Qin texts show a more pragmatic and eclectic approach in contrast with descriptions in traditional texts. Qin administration has been judged to be no harsher than was prevalent at the time.
