40|$|In {{response}} to demand in market place, discrete manufacturing firms need to adopt batch type manufacturing for incorporating continuous and rapid changes in manufacturing to gain edge over competitors. In addition, {{there is an}} increasing trend toward achieving higher level of integration between design and manufacturing functions in industries to make batch manufacturing more efficient and productive. In batch shop production environment, the cost of manufacturing is inversely proportional to batch size and the batch size determines the productivity. In real time environment, the batch size of the components is often small leading to frequent changeovers, larger machine idleness and so lesser productivity. To alleviate these problems, “Cellular Manufacturing Systems” (CMS) can be implemented to accommodate small <b>batches</b> <b>without</b> loosing much of production run time.

In order to process a different mail type than the previous one, agents must undergo a change-over during which it remains inactive. We propose a threshold based algorithm in order to maximise the overall efficiency (the average amount of mail collected). We show that memory, i. e. the possibility for agents to develop preferences for certain cities, not only leads to emergent cooperation between agents, but also to a significant increase in efficiency (above the theoretical upper limit for any memoryless algorithm), and we systematically investigate the influence of the various model parameters. Finally, we demonstrate the flexibility of the algorithm to changes in circumstances, and its excellent scalability. 1...|$|R

40|$|In a {{video-on-demand}} (VOD) environment, batching {{of requests}} is often applied {{to reduce the}} I/O demand and increase the availability of VOD services. This scheme, however, unfairly forces first comers to wait for subscribers arriving late at the batch. Some of these victims may become impatient and decide to renege. To address this issue, we introduce a chaining technique which allows a client station being served to forward its video data to other client stations, which requested the same video, at a slightly later time. The forwarding of data is done using the same store-and-forward mechanism of the multicast facility used in batching. With this new feature, requests arriving at a chain can be served immediately; yet {{they are allowed to}} share a single video stream. Thus, chaining enjoys the benefit of <b>batching</b> <b>without</b> its side effect of causing long access latencies.
