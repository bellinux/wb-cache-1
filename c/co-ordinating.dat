5|$|Chamberlain had disliked what he {{considered}} to be an overly sentimental attitude of both Baldwin and MacDonald on Cabinet appointments and reshuffles. Although he had worked closely with the President of the Board of Trade, Walter Runciman over the tariff issue, Chamberlain dismissed him from his post, offering Runciman the token position of Lord Privy Seal, which an angry Runciman declined. Runciman, a member of the Liberal National Party, was thought by Chamberlain to be lazy. Soon after taking office, Chamberlain instructed his ministers to prepare two-year policy programmes.

40|$|Development {{of a novel}} {{two-dimensional}} estuarine {{hydrodynamic model}} in cylindrical <b>co-ordinates</b> is presented herein. The full non-linear Navier-Stokes equations are written in cylindrical <b>co-ordinates</b> with {{the advantage of the}} <b>co-ordinate</b> system fitting the estuary 2 ̆ 7 s shape. Thus the bending of the coastline can be more accurately described. Also, this way a fine mesh is obtained in the coastal area, while a coarse mesh is defined away from the coast provided that the position of the pole is appropriately chosen. The new model aims at improving the resolution of study areas and getting results without increasing computational costs. Validation of the cylindrical <b>co-ordinates</b> numerical model is done by comparison with robust industry-standard models, tidal basin measurements and analytical solution. Three test cases are proposed for comparison with other numerical models: horizontal bed with constant value of the scale factors in the radial direction, horizontal bed with one variation of the scale factors in the radial direction, horizontal bed with two variations of the scale factors in the radial direction. Variation of the scale factors in the radial direction is done with an exponential function. Comparisons with results of the two numerical models show very good agreement. Comparison with tidal basin data is done in three cases: cylindrical <b>co-ordinates</b> (the rectangular geometry is generated from cylindrical <b>co-ordinates),</b> uniform Cartesian <b>co-ordinates,</b> and non-uniform Cartesian <b>co-ordinates.</b> Results showed that agreement was achieved in all cases. Finally, agreement between analytical solution and results of the numerical model shows the potential of the cylindrical <b>co-ordinates</b> numerical model for estuarine hydrodynamic modelling. In terms of computational savings, the model proved to be four times faster than the Cartesian <b>co-ordinates</b> numerical model ran at the finest resolution in the cylindrical <b>co-ordinates</b> numerical model. Compared to the general orthogonal curvilinear <b>co-ordinates</b> model, the new model is three times slower since this is a preliminary development of the cylindrical <b>co-ordinates</b> model and further improvement is required...|$|R

5|$|Conscription for the Army, {{but not for}} {{civilian}} industry, had been brought in {{during the first half}} of 1916. Towards the end of Asquith’s Government in 1916 a Manpower Distribution Board had been set up under Neville’s brother Austen, but it had no executive powers. After Edwin Montagu had refused the new position of Director of National Service, as he thought the task of building up a new ministry was beyond him, Chamberlain, who was already nationally known, was proposed for the job by his brother Austen. In December 1916, the new Prime Minister David Lloyd George offered him the job, with responsibility for <b>co-ordinating</b> conscription and ensuring that essential war industries were able to function with sufficient workforces. Though reluctant to leave his post in Birmingham, Chamberlain accepted and resigned as Lord Mayor.|$|E

40|$|Abstract]: This project investigates and {{evaluates the}} use of the conformal, affine and {{projective}} transformation methods to derive parameters to convert three existing <b>co-ordinate</b> systems found within the Australian Capital Territory into the Geodetic Datum of Australia 1994 map projection Map Grid Australia. These existing <b>co-ordinate</b> systems are known as City <b>Co-ordinates</b> (CC), Preliminary Grid <b>Co-ordinates</b> (PGC) and Adjusted Grid <b>Co-ordinates</b> (AGC) and are located in separated zones through the ACT. Three styles of transformation have been used {{in each of the three}} <b>co-ordinate</b> zones and analysis has been made into which method is most suited when a conversion from a 2 D orthogonal <b>co-ordinate</b> system into another is required. Comparisons have also been made when using GPS observations and territory published values to derive parameters in converting values within each test area. Effects of extrapolation have been investigated to determine the magnitude of error when parameters are used outside the region used to derive them. The error from the effects of extrapolation, have also been contrasted against acceptable limits defined from class and order of known published values. Spatial information is at the forefront of industry and government and with the ever increasing quantity of available data to the spatial user, quality data is desirable and <b>co-ordinate</b> transformation offers a method to data users for the merging of data and <b>co-ordinate</b> system conversion within data sets...|$|R
