5|$|Volunteers: Volunteers form a {{major part}} of hospice care in the United States and may provide a variety of {{physical}} or emotional comforts to patients and family, including providing housework, health care, spiritual counseling and <b>companionship.</b> Hospice volunteers also provide administrative assistance to hospices.|$|E
5|$|Heyer {{frequently}} {{highlights the}} heroine's many masculine qualities, {{which include a}} fierce independence and a disregard for social mores. Modern literary critics have noted {{that the relationship between}} the protagonists is modelled on those of the latter 20th century, offering <b>companionship</b> and allowing both parties to retain a level of independence. The heroine's unwillingness to conform attracts the hero, rather than repels him.|$|E

5000|$|Foreign troops {{during the}} late Roman period were known as the foederati ("allies") in Latin, and during the Byzantine period were known as the Phoideratoi (Gr. Φοιδεράτοι) in Greek. From this point, foreign troops (mainly mercenaries) were known as the Hetairoi (Gr. Ἑταιρείαι, [...] "Companionships") and most {{frequently}} employed in the Imperial Guard. This force was in turn divided into the Great <b>Companionships</b> (Μεγάλη Εταιρεία), the Middle <b>Companionships</b> (Μέση Εταιρεία), and the Minor <b>Companionships</b> (Μικρά Εταιρεία), commanded by their respective Hetaireiarches - [...] "Companionship lords". These may have been divided upon a religious basis separating the Christian subjects, Christian foreigners, and non-Christians, respectively.|$|R
5|$|In 1898, Bresslau met {{her future}} husband, Albert Schweitzer at a wedding. Shortly thereafter, they {{developed}} a relationship that included separation, independence, and non-exclusive behaviors. This allowed both to develop their lives while enjoying each other's <b>companionship,</b> conversation, and virtues. The one thing that united the pair was their shared ideology: {{to take care of}} others.|$|E
5|$|In some {{interpretations of}} the novella, the male {{characters}} represent patriarchal society, with Hyde signifying its moral corruption. Other interpretations suggest {{that the lack of}} female <b>companionship</b> for the male characters indicates their latent homosexuality and that Hyde is engaged in homosexual activity. These interpretations are harder to apply to the play because of Sullivan's addition of female characters and heterosexual relationships.|$|E
5|$|Albert and his elder brother, Ernest, {{spent their}} youth {{in a close}} <b>companionship</b> marred by their parents' {{turbulent}} marriage and eventual separation and divorce. After their mother was exiled from court in 1824, she married her lover, Alexander von Hanstein, Count of Polzig and Beiersdorf. She presumably never saw her children again, and died of cancer {{at the age of}} 30 in 1831. The following year, their father married his own niece, his sons' cousin Princess Antoinette Marie of Württemberg; their marriage was not close, however, and Antoinette Marie had little—if any—impact on her stepchildren's lives.|$|E

5|$|Candide and Cacambo {{eventually}} reach Suriname, {{where they}} split up: Cacambo travels to Buenos Aires to retrieve Lady Cunégonde, while Candide prepares {{to travel to}} Europe to await the two. Candide's remaining sheep are stolen, and Candide is fined heavily by a Dutch magistrate for petulance over the theft. Before leaving Suriname, Candide feels in need of <b>companionship,</b> so he interviews a number of local {{men who have been}} through various ill-fortunes and settles on a man named Martin.|$|E
5|$|Enterprise soon {{arrives at}} Tarquin's planet. He welcomes Archer and Hoshi and soon agrees {{to work on}} reading the weapon fragment, but only if Sato agrees to remain with him. They agree, and Enterprise departs to {{investigate}} the second sphere. Tarquin and Sato discuss many subjects and initially the alien seems trustworthy. However she also discovers {{that he had been}} watching her telepathically for some time and that she is not the first person to be brought here to provide <b>companionship</b> for him.|$|E
5|$|Foxes {{and human}} beings lived close {{together}} in ancient Japan; this <b>companionship</b> gave rise to legends about the creatures. Kitsune have become closely associated with Inari, a Shinto kami or spirit, and serve as its messengers. This role has reinforced the fox's supernatural significance. The more tails a kitsune has—they may {{have as many as}} nine—the older, wiser, and more powerful it is. Because of their potential power and influence, some people make offerings to them as to a deity.|$|E
50|$|Today, {{connotations of}} fraternities vary {{according}} to context including <b>companionships</b> and brotherhoods dedicated to the religious, intellectual, academic, physical or social pursuits of its members. Additionally, in modern times, it sometimes connotes a secret society especially regarding freemasonry, odd fellows, various academic and student societies.|$|R
5000|$|LIPA {{does not}} issue its own degrees, {{so rather than}} issuing Honorary Degrees like other British universities, it awards [...] "Companionships".

50|$|Many car {{clubs have}} been set up to {{facilitate}} social interactions and <b>companionships</b> amongst those who take pride in owning, maintaining, driving and showing their cars.

5|$|It is a {{versatile}} hunting dog, used {{for its ability}} to locate and retrieve game in harsh and adverse terrain and conditions. It is not specialised to any one type of terrain, and tends to score well in field trials. The Blue Picardy {{is considered to be a}} quiet breed, but requires a great deal of exercise as it has a high level of stamina. It loves to play, and is a responsive and obedient breed which thrives on human <b>companionship.</b> It is especially good with children.|$|E
5|$|Like many working dogs, the Australian Cattle Dog {{has high}} energy levels, an active mind, and {{a level of}} independence. The breed ranks 10th in Stanley Coren's The Intelligence of Dogs, rated {{as one of the}} most {{intelligent}} dogs ranked by obedience command trainability. The Cattle Dog needs plenty of exercise, <b>companionship</b> and a job to do, so a non-working dog might participate in dog sports, learning tricks, or other activities that engage its body and mind.|$|E
5|$|Nevertheless, within just a year, in 429 BC, the Athenians {{not only}} forgave Pericles but also re-elected him as strategos. He was {{reinstated}} {{in command of}} the Athenian army and led all its military operations during 429 BC, having once again under his control the levers of power. In that year, however, Pericles witnessed the death of both his legitimate sons from his first wife, Paralus and Xanthippus, in the epidemic. His morale undermined, he burst into tears and not even Aspasia's <b>companionship</b> could console him. He himself died of the plague in the autumn of 429 BC.|$|E
6000|$|I do {{here and}} now, and for ever, renounce {{the world with}} all [...] its sinful pleasures, <b>companionships,</b> treasures, and [...] objects, and declare my full {{determination}} boldly to show [...] myself a soldier of Jesus Christ in all places and [...] companies, no matter what I may have to suffer, do, or lose, [...] by so doing.|$|R
60|$|Poverty and {{distress}} bring about strange <b>companionships.</b> When Aspel {{first arrived in}} London he would have scouted the idea of his having anything whatever to do with such a man as Abel Bones, {{but he had not}} proceeded far in his downward course when that disreputable character became, if not a companion, at least an acquaintance.|$|R
50|$|Missions are {{organized}} in two parallel structures. The {{first is the}} organization of the missionaries. There are two or more missionaries who serve as assistants to the president (not {{to be confused with the}} counselors in the mission presidency). The assistants carry out the direction of the mission president in {{the organization of the}} mission, the assigning of <b>companionships</b> and proselyting areas, and oversee the welfare and training of the missionaries. The missionaries are divided into zones, each led by one or more missionaries assigned as zone leaders. The zones may be geographically large or small depending on the mission. The number of missionaries in a zone also varies widely. The zones are divided into districts, each being led by a missionary assigned as a district leader. A district usually has two to four missionary <b>companionships.</b> The zone leaders and district leaders train the missionaries, see after their welfare, conduct interviews, proselyte together, and share successes. In general, only single male missionaries serve as assistants, zone leaders, and district leaders, except in non-proselyting missions which only contain single female missionaries or missionary couples.|$|R
5|$|Sadie Harris is {{a fictional}} {{character}} from the American television medical drama Grey's Anatomy, which airs on the American Broadcasting Company (ABC) in the United States. The character {{was created by}} series producer Shonda Rhimes and portrayed by actress Melissa George. Introduced as a surgical intern who has an old <b>companionship</b> with the series' protagonist Meredith Grey (Ellen Pompeo), she eventually forms a friendship with Lexie Grey (Chyler Leigh), and departs after it is revealed she cheated {{her way into the}} surgical program.|$|E
5|$|The {{cognitive}} ability {{of children with}} AS often allows them to articulate social norms in a laboratory context, where {{they may be able}} to show a theoretical understanding of other people's emotions; however, they typically have difficulty acting on this knowledge in fluid, real-life situations. People with AS may analyze and distill their observations of social interaction into rigid behavioral guidelines, and apply these rules in awkward ways, such as forced eye contact, resulting in a demeanor that appears rigid or socially naive. Childhood desire for <b>companionship</b> can become numbed through a history of failed social encounters.|$|E
5|$|The {{domestic}} cat (Felis silvestris catus or Felis catus) is a small, typically furry, carnivorous mammal. They {{are often}} called house cats when kept as indoor pets or simply cats {{when there is}} no need to distinguish them from other felids and felines. Cats are often valued by humans for <b>companionship</b> and for their ability to hunt vermin. There are more than 70 cat breeds, though different associations proclaim different numbers according to their standards.|$|E
50|$|In 2006, MTV {{developed}} the reality television series The Hills as the spin-off of Laguna Beach: The Real Orange County. It originally chronicled {{the lives of}} Lauren Conrad, who appeared on its predecessor, her housemate Heidi Montag, and friends Audrina Patridge and Whitney Port. In 2007, Jenner began dating Conrad, {{which led to the}} deterioration with his friendship with Pratt. After Conrad established <b>companionships</b> with Jenner and Frankie Delgado, Pratt severed ties with both men.|$|R
60|$|Friars Pardon stood {{faithful}} to its tradition. At the appointed time was born, not that third in their party to whom Sophie {{meant to be}} so kind, but a godling; in beauty, it was manifest, excelling Eros, as in wisdom Confucius; an enhancer of delights, a renewer of <b>companionships</b> and an interpreter of Destiny. This last George did not realise till he met Lady Conant striding through Dutton Shaw {{a few days after}} the event.|$|R
60|$|It is {{said that}} {{adversity}} makes strange bed-fellows. It is not less true that strong drink makes strange companions. Gunter's shipmates having had more than enough of him on the sea were only too glad to get clear of him when on land. He therefore found himself obliged {{to look out for}} new <b>companionships,</b> for it is certain that man yearns after sympathy of some sort, and is not, under ordinary circumstances, content to be alone.|$|R
5|$|The {{university}} also houses {{an independent}} nonprofit organization, Community Impact, which strives to serve disadvantaged {{people in the}} Harlem, Washington Heights, and Morningside Heights communities. From its earliest inception as a single service initiative formed in 1981 by Columbia University undergraduates, Community Impact has grown into Columbia University's largest student service organization. CI provides food, clothing, shelter, education, job training, and <b>companionship</b> for residents in its surrounding communities. CI consists of a dedicated corps of about 950 Columbia University student volunteers participating in 25 community service programs, which serve more than 8,000 people each year.|$|E
5|$|Within {{a year of}} Albert Wise's death, Martha Wise, {{though not}} {{considered}} a particularly good or attractive catch, found new male <b>companionship</b> {{in the form of}} Walter Johns, who worked as a farmhand on property adjacent to her farm. The relationship was frowned upon by Wise's family, and both Wise's mother, Sophie Hasel, and her aunt, Lily Gienke, made no secret of their desire for Wise to end the relationship. By the end of 1924, Wise had acquiesced, and the relationship ended. Johns moved to Cleveland and the couple lost contact.|$|E
5|$|Although {{she enjoyed}} {{motherhood}} and assumed {{primary responsibility for}} rearing the children, Stanton found herself unsatisfied and even depressed {{by the lack of}} intellectual <b>companionship</b> and stimulation in Seneca Falls. Throughout this period of removal from the woman’s movement, Stanton kept in touch with Susan B. Anthony, and writing Anthony’s speeches became one of Stanton’s primary modes of involvement in the movement from afar. Additionally, Stanton often wrote Anthony letters about the difficulties of balancing domestic and public life, especially in a prejudiced society. As another antidote to the boredom and loneliness, Stanton became increasingly involved in the community and, by 1848, had established ties to similarly minded women in the area. By this time, she was firmly committed to the nascent women's rights movement and was ready to engage in organized activism.|$|E
25|$|Yet {{the temptations}} {{of the city and}} corrupting <b>companionships</b> could easily lead a {{perfectly}} diligent servant into the path of crime. A mounting anxiety grew between eighteenth-century Londoners regarding the danger posed by servants seeking employment in order to steal or open the house at night to their accomplices. According to Defoe, living in fear and suspicion of your servants, as feeling unsafe outdoors at night, means to live in an hostile country, a depiction unworthy of his idea of a flourishing England.|$|R
50|$|In {{a similar}} way the player’s actions and {{alignment}} with the light or dark side affects their teammates (both a teammate’s alignment and who teams with the player in the first place), gender is also a factor {{when it comes to}} <b>companionships</b> and gameplay in general. In addition the appearance (due to choices) also affects your teammates. For example, choosing a female character teams the player with Mical the Disciple, while being male teams the player with Brianna the Handmaiden.|$|R
