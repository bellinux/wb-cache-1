5|$|Several of the Comet's {{avionics}} {{systems were}} new to civil aviation. One such feature was irreversible powered flight controls, which increased the pilot's ease {{of control and}} the safety of the aircraft by preventing aerodynamic forces from changing the directed positions and placement of the aircraft's <b>control</b> <b>surfaces.</b> Additionally, a large number of the <b>control</b> <b>surfaces,</b> such as the elevators, were equipped with a complex gearing system as a safeguard against accidentally over-stressing the surfaces or airframe at higher speed ranges.|$|E
5|$|Communications usually {{consisted}} of FuG X, the later FuG 10 (Funkgerät), navigational direction finder PeilG V direction finder (PeilG - Peilgerät) and the FuG 25 IFF and FuBI 1 blind-landing devices. The crew communicated by EiV intercom. A primitive autopilot device, the Siemens K4Ü, was installed and could maintain bearing using the rudder's <b>control</b> <b>surfaces.</b>|$|E
5|$|The <b>control</b> <b>surfaces</b> {{operated}} {{in much the}} same way as other aircraft, with the exception of the innovative automatic pull-out system. Releasing the bomb initiated the pull-out, or automatic recovery and climb, upon the deflection of the dive brakes. The pilot could override the system by exerting significant force on the control column and taking manual control.|$|E
2500|$|Changing {{the setting}} of a trim tab adjusts the neutral or resting {{position}} of a <b>control</b> <b>surface</b> (such as an elevator or rudder). As the desired position of a <b>control</b> <b>surface</b> changes (corresponding mainly to different speeds), an adjustable trim tab will allow the operator to reduce the manual force required to maintain that position—to zero, if used correctly. [...] Thus the trim tab acts as a servo tab. [...] Because the center of pressure of the trim tab is further away from the axis of rotation of the <b>control</b> <b>surface</b> than the center of pressure of the <b>control</b> <b>surface,</b> the movement generated by the tab can match the movement generated by the <b>control</b> <b>surface.</b> The position of the <b>control</b> <b>surface</b> on its axis will change until the torque from the <b>control</b> <b>surface</b> and the trim surface balance each other.|$|R
40|$|A {{simulation}} {{framework is}} developed {{for assessing the}} effect of <b>control</b> <b>surface</b> inertial loads on hypersonic vehicle response. The framework {{is based on a}} partitioned, time-marching approach in which the fuselage and <b>control</b> <b>surface</b> equations of motion are in-tegrated independently and forces/motion at the interface are exchanged between the two systems at pre-determined time intervals. This approach is advantageous in that it does not require direct coupling of the fuselage and <b>control</b> <b>surface</b> models, and therefore allows for the models to be of dissimilar form. Equations of motion for both the fuselage and <b>control</b> <b>surface</b> are presented and a formulation for coupling the two systems is outlined which includes iterations within each aeroelastic time step. The methodology is applied to a representative hypersonic vehicle elevator <b>control</b> <b>surface</b> model which includes aerother-moelastic effects and is attached to a single degree of freedom oscillator representing the fuselage. Results show that <b>control</b> <b>surface</b> inertial effects lead to a departure of the in-stantaneous <b>control</b> <b>surface</b> lift force by up to a factor of eight with respect to the static value. Investigation of the system response under a commanded change in <b>control</b> <b>surface</b> deflection angle shows that <b>control</b> <b>surface</b> inertia results in departure of the instantaneou...|$|R
40|$|Dr. Lagerstrom's {{development}} of the conical flow theory to apply to upwash and sidewash problems (see reference 1) {{has been applied to}} the case of a deflected roll <b>control</b> <b>surface.</b> The upwash behind, and in the plane of, the deflected <b>control</b> <b>surface</b> at 0, 1, 4, and 9 chord lengths behind the wing is calculated. The whole upwash-sidewaeh field, an infinite distance downstream of the <b>control</b> <b>surface,</b> (in the Trefftz plane), is also calculated. It is shown that a rolling moment is induced on any aerodynamic surface - vertical, horizontal, or oblique - that lies {{in the wake of the}} deflected <b>control</b> <b>surface.</b> This induced rolling moment is in the reverse direction of that prescribed by the deflection of the roll <b>control</b> <b>surface.</b> One simple case is cited where the magnitude of the induced rolling moment is larger than that produced directly by the roll <b>control</b> <b>surface,</b> thus causing a reversal of the roll direction. An induced yawing moment may also be encountered if a vertical aerodynamic surface, not symmetrical with respect to the plane of the wing, is present in the wake of the deflected <b>control</b> <b>surface...</b>|$|R
5|$|At {{the time}} it was known that the drag at {{supersonic}} speeds was strongly related to the span of the wing. This led to the use of very short-span, very thin rectangular wings such as those seen on the <b>control</b> <b>surfaces</b> of many missiles, or in aircraft like the Lockheed F-104 Starfighter or the Avro 730 that the team studied. The team outlined a baseline configuration that looked like an enlarged Avro 730.|$|E

The tephra and hot ash damaged the fabric <b>control</b> <b>surfaces,</b> the engines, the Plexiglas windscreens and the gun turrets of the 340th's B-25 Mitchell medium bombers. Estimates ranged from 78 to 88 aircraft destroyed.|$|E
5|$|Pilot {{control was}} entirely through a single side-mounted control stick. Pitch and roll were {{controlled}} through conventional fore-aft and side-to-side motions, while yaw {{could be controlled}} by twisting the stick. No mechanical linkages were used, the stick instead controlled the flow of high pressure air around the craft, which either directly attached to various <b>control</b> <b>surfaces,</b> or indirectly through local cable linkages to replace controls that were intended to be cable-actuated (like throttle controls on the engines).|$|E

5|$|The 767 is {{equipped}} with three redundant hydraulic systems for operation of <b>control</b> <b>surfaces,</b> landing gear, and utility actuation systems. Each engine powers a separate hydraulic system, and the third system uses electric pumps. A ram air turbine provides power for basic controls {{in the event of}} an emergency. An early form of fly-by-wire is employed for spoiler operation, utilizing electric signaling instead of traditional control cables. The fly-by-wire system reduces weight and allows independent operation of individual spoilers.|$|E
5|$|The F-22 Raptor is a {{fifth-generation}} fighter that {{is considered}} fourth generation in stealth aircraft technology by the USAF. It is the first operational aircraft to combine supercruise, supermaneuverability, stealth, and sensor fusion in a single weapons platform. The Raptor has clipped delta wings with a reverse sweep on the rear, four empennage surfaces, and a retractable tricycle landing gear. Flight <b>control</b> <b>surfaces</b> include leading-edge flaps, flaperons, ailerons, rudders on the canted vertical stabilizers, and all-moving horizontal tails; these surfaces also serve as speed brakes.|$|E
5|$|The He 111 was a {{twin-engine}} {{version of}} the Blitz, preserving the elliptical inverted gull wing, small rounded <b>control</b> <b>surfaces</b> and BMW engines, so that the new design was often called the Doppel-Blitz ("Double Lightning"). When the Dornier Do 17 displaced the He 70, Heinkel needed a twin-engine design to match its competitors. Heinkel spent 200,000 man hours designing the He 111. The fuselage length was extended to just over 17.4m/57ft (from 11.7m/38ft 4½in) and wingspan to 22.6m/74ft (from 14.6m/48ft).|$|E
40|$|A sonic {{control device}} {{that reduces the}} effects of shock waves {{generated}} by an aircraft traveling at supersonic speeds. The control device includes a <b>control</b> <b>surface</b> located {{at or near the}} nose section of the aircraft. The position of the <b>control</b> <b>surface</b> can be moved between a retracted position and an extended position. When in a deflected position, the <b>control</b> <b>surface</b> increases the air pressure at the nose section. The increase in air pressure at the nose section decreases both the pressure amplitude and the slope of the overall shock wave as the wave travels toward the ground. Additionally, the deflection of the <b>control</b> <b>surface</b> may induce a downward directed pressure increase which creates less of a drag penalty than a truly blunt nose. When shock control is not desired, the <b>control</b> <b>surface</b> is moved back to the retracted position to reduce the drag on the plane. The moving control device allows a supersonic aircraft to efficiently travel above both land and water...|$|R
40|$|AbstractWith control using {{redundant}} multiple <b>control</b> <b>surface</b> {{arrangement and}} large-deflection drag rudders, a combat flying wing {{has a higher}} probability for <b>control</b> <b>surface</b> failures. Therefore, its flight control system {{must be able to}} reconfigure after such failures. Considering three types of typical <b>control</b> <b>surface</b> failures (lock-in-place (LIP), loss-of-effectiveness (LOE) and float), flight control reconfiguration characteristic and capability of such aircraft types are analyzed. Because of the <b>control</b> <b>surface</b> redundancy, the aircraft using the dynamic inversion flight control law already has a control allocation block. In this paper, its flight control configuration during the above failures is achieved by modifying this block. It is shown that such a reconfigurable flight control design is valid, through numerical simulations of flight attitude control task. Results indicate that, in the circumstances of <b>control</b> <b>surface</b> failures with limited degree and the degradation of the flying quality level, a combat flying wing adopting this flight control reconfiguration approach based on control allocation could guarantee its flight safety and perform some flight combat missions...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{demonstrates}} a technique for locating the optimal <b>control</b> <b>surface</b> layout of an aeroservoelastic Common Research Model wingbox, {{in the context}} of maneuver load alleviation and active utter suppression. The combinatorial actuator layout design is solved using ideas borrowed from topology optimization, where the effectiveness of a given <b>control</b> <b>surface</b> is tied to a layout design variable, which varies from zero (the actuator is removed) to one (the actuator is retained). These layout design variables are optimized concurrently with a large number of structural wingbox sizing variables and <b>control</b> <b>surface</b> actuation variables, in order to minimize the sum of structural weight and actuator weight. Results are presented that demonstrate interdependencies between structural sizing patterns and optimal <b>control</b> <b>surface</b> layouts, for both static and dynamic aeroelastic physics...|$|R

After working through their post-sleep activities, Altman, Johnson and McArthur performed a check-out of the flight <b>control</b> <b>surfaces,</b> performed a reaction control system hot-fire, and went through communications checks with managers on the ground. The {{rest of the crew}} worked to stow away items that were used during the mission. The crew held a deorbit preparations briefing with the ground teams, and Altman and Johnson worked with the simulator on board to run through a series of landing simulations.|$|E

The flaps were extended to between 15° and 20°, the standard setting for take-off. The propeller blades of No. 4 engine on the far right side of the aircraftwere reversedminus 8°, while the blades of Nos. 1, 2 and 3 engines were at 34° positive pitch (also standard for take-off).|$|E
5|$|Depleted uranium is {{also used}} as a {{shielding}} material in some containers used to store and transport radioactive materials. While the metal itself is radioactive, its high density makes it more effective than lead in halting radiation from strong sources such as radium. Other uses of depleted uranium include counterweights for aircraft <b>control</b> <b>surfaces,</b> as ballast for missile re-entry vehicles and as a shielding material. Due to its high density, this material is found in inertial guidance systems and in gyroscopic compasses. Depleted uranium is preferred over similarly dense metals due to its ability to be easily machined and cast {{as well as its}} relatively low cost. The main risk of exposure to depleted uranium is chemical poisoning by uranium oxide rather than radioactivity (uranium being only a weak alpha emitter).|$|E

5|$|Similar to the An-124, the An-70 design makes {{extensive}} use of titanium and composites to keep weight to a minimum and increase damage resistance. Approximately 25 percent of the airframe is made of carbon-fibre composites, which are primarily used on <b>control</b> <b>surfaces</b> and the tail assembly, while aluminium and steel alloys are used {{for the rest of}} the structure. The An-70 has a designed life of 45,000hours over 15,000flights. The prototypes had a fly-by-wire flight-control system that comprised three digital channels and six analog channels; it was expected that production aircraft would have a four-channel digital fly-by-wire system. Aircraft and system information are mainly relayed to the pilot and co-pilot via six large multi-function CRT displays, with secondary electro-mechanical instruments and head-up displays; a flight engineer position is also present on the prototypes.|$|E
5|$|The 747 has {{redundant}} structures {{along with}} four redundant hydraulic systems and four main landing gears with four wheels each, which {{provide a good}} spread of support {{on the ground and}} safety in case of tire blow-outs. The main gear are redundant so that landing can be performed on two opposing landing gears if the others do not function properly. In addition, the 747 has split <b>control</b> <b>surfaces</b> and was designed with sophisticated triple-slotted flaps that minimize landing speeds and allow the 747 to use standard-length runways. For transportation of spare engines, 747s can accommodate a non-functioning fifth-pod engine under the port wing of the aircraft between the inner functioning engine and the fuselage.|$|E
5|$|The {{project was}} {{designed}} {{with a new}} methodology called fault tree analysis, which allowed {{the effects of a}} failure of a single part to be studied to determine its impact on other systems. To address concerns about safety and flyability, the 747's design included structural redundancy, redundant hydraulic systems, quadruple main landing gear and dual <b>control</b> <b>surfaces.</b> Additionally, some of the most advanced high-lift devices used in the industry were included in the new design, to allow it to operate from existing airports. These included slats running almost {{the entire length of the}} wing, as well as complex three-part slotted flaps along the trailing edge of the wing. The wing's complex three-part flaps increase wing area by 21 percent and lift by 90 percent when fully deployed compared to their non-deployed configuration.|$|E

5|$|As {{the debate}} over Zeus raged, the Nike team was making rapid {{progress}} developing the actual system. Test firings of the original A models of the missile began in 1959 at White Sands Missile Range. The first attempt on 26 August 1959 was of a live booster stage and dummy sustainer, but the booster broke up shortly before booster/sustainer separation. A similar test on 14 October was a success, followed by the first two-stage attempt on 16 December. The first complete test of both stages with active guidance and thrust vectoring was successfully carried out on 3 February 1960. Data collected from these tests led to changes to the design to improve speed during the ascent. The first test of the Zeus B took place in May 1961. A number of Zeus missiles broke up during early test flights due to excessive heating of the <b>control</b> <b>surfaces,</b> and numerous changes were worked into the system to address this.|$|E
5|$|During {{test flights}} of the Su-27Ms, {{which began in}} 1988, {{engineers}} discovered that pilots failed to maintain active control of the aircraft at high angles of attack due to the ineffectiveness of flight <b>control</b> <b>surfaces</b> at low speeds. The decision was therefore made to install thrust-vectoring engines to the eleventh Su-27 (factory code T10M-11), which had been built by the Komsomolsk-on-Amur Aircraft Production Association in the country's Far East and was {{being used as a}} radar test bed. Following the airframe's completion in early 1995, the aircraft was delivered to the design bureau's experimental plant near Moscow, where engineers started installing the nozzles to the aircraft. Although Sukhoi had intended the Lyulka-Saturn AL-37FU to power the aircraft, the engine had not yet been flight cleared. Therefore the aircraft was temporarily fitted with the less-powerful AL-31FP engine, which was essentially an AL-31F engine that had the AL-100 vectoring nozzles of the AL-37FU. The aircraft was rolled out in May. Two months later, the temporary engines were replaced with AL-37FUs; its nozzles could only deflect 15 degrees up or down in the pitch axis, and can deflect together or differentially.|$|E
5|$|The A-10 was envisioned to {{fly from}} forward air bases and semi-prepared runways with {{high risk of}} foreign object damage to the engines. The unusual {{location}} of the General Electric TF34-GE-100 turbofan engines decreases ingestion risk, and allows the engines to run while the aircraft is serviced and rearmed by ground crews, reducing turn-around time. The wings are also mounted closer to the ground, simplifying servicing and rearming operations. The heavy engines require strong supports: four bolts connect the engine pylons to the airframe. The engines' high 6:1 bypass ratio contributes to a relatively small infrared signature, and their position directs exhaust over the tailplanes further shielding it from detection by infrared homing surface-to-air missiles. The engines and exhausts are angled upward by nine degrees to cancel out the nose-down pitching moment that would otherwise generate from being mounted above the aircraft's center of gravity and avoids the need to trim the <b>control</b> <b>surfaces</b> to prevent pitching.|$|E
40|$|The error due to wing bending {{introduced}} into single-camera photogrammetric computations {{used for the}} determination of wing twist or <b>control</b> <b>surface</b> angular deformation is described.
