5000|$|Psidium cattleyanum, {{commonly}} known as <b>Cattley</b> <b>guava,</b> strawberry guava or cherry guava, is a small tree (2-6 m tall) in the Myrtaceae (myrtle) family. The species is named in honour of English horticulturist William Cattley. Its genus name Psidium comes from the Latin psidion, or [...] "armlet." [...] The red-fruited variety, P. cattleyanum var. cattleyanum, is {{commonly known}} as purple guava, red <b>cattley</b> <b>guava,</b> red strawberry guava and red cherry guava. The yellow-fruited variety, P. cattleyanum var. littorale is variously known as yellow <b>cattley</b> <b>guava,</b> yellow strawberry guava, yellow cherry guava, lemon guava and in Hawaii as waiawī. Although P. cattleyanum has select economic uses, it is considered the most invasive plant in Hawaii.|$|E
50|$|<b>Cattley</b> <b>guava</b> is {{sporadically}} naturalised {{in coastal}} areas of Queensland and northern New South Wales. It is also naturalised on Lord Howe Island, Norfolk Island and Christmas Island (Navie 2004; Queensland Herbarium 2008).

50|$|Scopuloides magnicystidiata is {{a species}} of crust fungus in the family Meruliaceae. This white rot species was {{described}} as new to science in 2003 by mycologists Robert Lee Gilbertson and Karen Nakasone. The type specimen was discovered growing on <b>Cattley</b> <b>guava</b> (Psidium cattleianum) in the South Hilo district of Hawaii. It has also been recorded in the Kalopa State Recreation Area growing on ironwood, and also on guava in Waipio Valley. The fungus is named for its prominent cystidia, which can be seen with a hand lens. A defining macroscopic characteristic is the translucent look of the fruit body when fresh, and its horny, brittle texture when dried.|$|E
40|$|The use of {{resistant}} rootstocks {{could be}} a promising method to control nematode Meloidogyne enterolobii in commercial plantations of guava. The present study aimed to evaluate the success of grafting guava as a scion on accessions of <b>cattley</b> <b>guava</b> as rootstocks resistant to M. enterolobii. The treatments consisted of the rootstocks <b>cattley</b> <b>guava</b> plants (three accessions of Psidium cattleyanum) and common guava (control). In the apical wedge grafting method, scion of Paluma cultivated variety was used. The experiment was arranged in a randomized block design with four treatments and five replicates, and eight plants per plot. The saplings produced as described before were planted in the field where the initial growth of the different combinations were evaluated. Graft success was observed for the control (common guava) and for accessions 115 and 117 of <b>cattley</b> <b>guava</b> plants, with success rates of 63, 32 and 29 %, respectively. In the field, the <b>cattley</b> <b>guava</b> used as rootstocks hampered Paluma canopy development and caused death of plants. Incompatibility of P. cattleyanum as rootstocks for P. guajava Paluma was confirmed one year after cultivation in field. </p...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Psidium cattleianum Sabine is {{a species}} from the Myrtaceae family {{that serves as}} an option for the native fruits cultivation, besides being {{considered}} a source {{of resistance to the}} Meloidogyne enterolobii nematode. Although <b>cattley</b> <b>guava</b> trees from this species produce flower buds in young branches, there are no reports of response to fructification pruning or phenological synchronism with the guava tree. The objective of this paper was the comparative evaluation of the genotype response of strawberry guava trees and guava cultivars to fructification pruning, thus, describing the phenology of both species under the same cultivation conditions. The experiment was conducted under an entirely randomized outline, in 7 x 2 factorial scheme, being evaluated seven genotypes (three from strawberry guava and four from guava trees), and with pruning performed in two seasons (May 2012 and March 2013), with three repetitions. Fructification pruning was executed by a lopping on all mature branches, from the last growth flow in the woody branch region. Were evaluated budding characteristics and fruit harvesting, as well as number of days from pruning to the observation of the phenological event. <b>Cattley</b> <b>guava</b> tree pruning stimulated fructification of all three genotypes after pruning done on May and two genotypes after the March’s pruning. There has been a sync between the guava cultivars’ flowering and both strawberry guava trees genotypes, when those were pruned on May...|$|E
40|$|Seven {{species of}} fruit were {{selected}} to study their suitability as hosts to Ceratitis capitata (Wiedemann). Suitability was determined by evaluating field infestation rates of different host-fruit and by studying the performance of C. capitata reared on these hosts. We sampled old regional cultivars of hot pepper (Capsicum annuum), loquat (Eriobotrya japonica), <b>cattley</b> <b>guava</b> (Psidium littorale), sweet orange (Citrus sinensis) and mandarin (Citrus reticulata); and two introduced fruit plants, feijoa (Feijoa sellowiana cultivar Sellwiana) and peach (Prunus persica cultivar Robidoux). Of the latter, except for mandarin, fruit contained larvae that pupated and yielded viable adults. In the case of mandarins, larvae were detected but none was able to pupate. The percentage of infested fruit was similar among peach, feijoa, sweet orange and hot pepper and, {{significantly higher than the}} other hosts (> 60 %). The highest mean number of pupae and adults per fruit was observed in peach (18. 30 and 17. 17, respectively) and the lowest in loquat (4. 62 and 3. 68, respectively). Host-fruit significantly influenced pupal weight, with heavier pupae (0. 0124 g) observed in sweet orange. The shortest pupal development time (9. 31 days) was observed in hot pepper, whereas the longest (11. 99 days) was in feijoa. Adult emergence rates were generally high (> 80 %), except for sweet orange. Results showed the most suitable host-fruit for C. capitata was peach, followed by <b>cattley</b> <b>guava</b> and feijoa; although loquat and sweet orange were shown to be the less suitable hosts they seem to have an important role as alternative hosts between January and June, allowing the continuous development of C. capitata throughout the year...|$|E
40|$|<b>Cattley</b> <b>guava</b> (Psidium cattleyanum Sabine) is {{a native}} fruit of Brazil that is popular both as a sweet food and for its reputed {{therapeutic}} properties. We examined whether it could damage DNA using the alkaline single-cell gel electrophoresis (comet assay) and the micronucleus test in leukocytes and in bone marrow cells of mice. P. cattleyanum leaf extract was tested at concentrations of 1000, 1500 and 2000 mg/kg. N-nitroso-N-ethylurea {{was used as a}} positive control. Peripheral blood leukocytes were collected 4 and 24 h after the treatments for the comet assay, and bone marrow cells were collected after 24 and 48 h for the micronucleus test. Unlike N-nitroso-N-ethylurea, P. cattleyanum extract failed to induce a significant increase in cell DNA damage, in micronucleated cell frequency, and in bone marrow toxicity. The lack of mutagenicity and cytotoxicity with high doses of this plant extract means that it can be safely used in traditional medicine...|$|E
40|$|This {{article was}} {{published}} in Journal of the Korean Society for Applied Biological Chemistry [© 2013 Springer Link] and the definite version is available at: [URL] The article website is at: [URL] phenolic contents of different fractions of the Psidium cattleianum leaf extract and their antioxidant capacity against several free radicals were examined. Protective effect of the ethyl acetate fraction (EAF) on H 2 O 2 -induced DNA damage in HepG 2 cells were also evaluated, and the phytochemical profile of EAF was analyzed using tandem mass spectrometry. EAF derived from the 80 % methanol extract of the leaf contained a remarkable amount of polyphenol and showed high levels of DPPH and alkyl radical scavenging activity, promoted cell viability, and protected against H 2 O 2 -induced DNA damage in HepG 2 cells. Phytochemical analysis revealed that the major components in the EAF included quercetin monoglycoside, phloridizin, quercetin 3 -diglycoside, quercetin- 3 -glucuronide, 2, 6 -dihydroxy- 3, 5 -dimethyl- 4 -glucopyranosylbenzophenone, phenolic acid, guaijaverin, and naringin. The present study suggests possible synergistic or competitive antioxidant action of the major compounds of <b>cattley</b> <b>guava</b> leaf on H 2 O 2 -induced DNA damage in HepG 2 cells. These {{results indicate that the}} ethyl acetate fraction of the guava leaf {{could be used as a}} potential source of natural antioxidants, and these findings will facilitate the utilization of guava leaf as a source of functional food.

40|$|Quarenta e sete acessos de Psidium spp. foram avaliados em casa de vegetação quanto à resistência a M. enterolobii, visando ao desenvolvimento de porta-enxertos e cultivares resistentes. Cinco a sete mudas de cada acesso foram produzidas por propagação vegetativa ou a partir de sementes e, no estádio de quatro pares de folhas, foram submetidas à inoculação com 500 ovos desse nematoide. Cento e trinta e cinco dias após, extraiu-se metade do sistema radicular das plantas (cortado ao longo de seu eixo longitudinal) para extração de ovos. As mudas foram replantadas com as raízes restantes e mantidas vivas em casa de vegetação. As contagens de ovos foram feitas em três alíquotas de 1 mL/planta, e multiplicadas por dois para obtenção da população final (Pf). As Pf's de todas as alíquotas foram submetidas a ANOVA, a qual indicou diferenças significativas (p Forty-seven accessions of Psidium spp. were {{evaluated}} under greenhouse conditions for resistance to M. enterolobii, {{as part of}} an effort to develop resistant rootstocks and cultivars. For each accession, five to seven plants were produced from stem cuttings or from true seeds and, at the stage of four pairs of leaves, they were inoculated with 500 nematode eggs. One hundred and thirty-five days later, the plants were removed from the pots and half of root system was processed for extraction of eggs. The plants were replanted with the remaining roots. The egg counts, obtained from three 1 mL aliquots per plant, were multiplied by two to obtain the final nematode population (Pf). The Pf values of all aliquots were submitted to ANOVA, which revealed significant differences among accessions and among plants of the same accession. The plants were classified as resistant or susceptible based on the reproduction factor (RF = Pf/ 500). All plants of <b>cattley</b> <b>guava</b> (P. cattleyanum) (accessions 115 and 116) were resistant (RF < 1) to M. enterolobii, while other Psidium spp. presented some plants with RF below or just above 1.

40|$|Madeira Island {{is a prime}} {{location}} {{for the production of}} some exotic and tropical fruits, such as <b>Cattley</b> <b>guava</b> (Psidium cattleianum Sabine), rose apple (Syzygium jambos L.) and Surinam cherry (Eugenia uniflora L.). They all have distinct antioxidant characteristics that are still scarcely studied. The extracts of these fruits were evaluated regarding their total phenolic compounds (TPC) and total flavonoids content. The TPC assay relies on the transfer of electrons from phenolic compounds to phosphomolybdic/phosphotungstic acid complexes in alkaline medium. These are determined spectrophotometrically at 765 nm. The content of total flavonoids was also measured, spectrophotometrically, by using the aluminium chloride colorimetric assay. TPC results are given in gallic acid equivalents (GAE) per 100 g and the results of total flavonoids in epicatechin equivalents (ECE) per 100 g. Phenolic compounds are considered to be antioxidants, scavengers of free radicals, metal chelators, antimutagens, and signalling agents and flavonoids act on several different synergistic pathways as both antioxidant and anti-inflammatory. Therefore, the consumption of fruits with high content on these compounds is important. The following order was found for TPC content in the analysed fruits: Rose apple (36. 1 mg GAE/ 100 g) < Surinam cherry (57. 9 mg GAE/ 100 g) < Cattle guava (109 mg GAE/ 100 g). Regarding flavonoids content the following order was found: Surinam cherry (37. 2 mg ECE / 100 g) < Cattle guava (72. 4 mg ECE / 100 g) < Rose apple (168. 9 mg ECE / 100 g). Cattle guava presented about 3 times more phenolics than rose apple, but rose apple contained about 4. 5 times more flavonoids than Surinam cherry. Some properties like antioxidant activity of Madeira island fruits remain uncharacterized, therefore these studies are very important to provide information to the population about the health benefits of their consumption.
