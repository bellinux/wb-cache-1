50|$|In 1865, {{he founded}} with John H. Boalt an assay office and {{consulting}} firm in Austin, Nevada. There, after a failure involving construction of a lead smelter, {{he turned his attention}} to processing silver ores. The silver ores of the Reese River district were treated by preliminary <b>chloridizing</b> <b>roasting</b> and then pan amalgamation with the aid of chemicals. After experimentation, Stetefeldt introduced a new type of furnace in Reno, Nevada. The Stetefeldt furnace was a metallurgical milestone. After the introduction of this furnace, most of his career revolved it. The invention made him widely known in mining districts. It was extensively used in the western United States for the roasting of silver ores preparatory to the extraction of the metal by either amalgamation or lixiviation.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. This study {{aimed to}} obtain {{volatile}} copper from a high-copper pyrite cinder by optimizing the <b>chloridizing</b> <b>roasting</b> process using response surface methodology (RSM). The effect of key parameters, i. e., dosage of CaCl 2 addition, roasting time and roasting temperature, on the copper volatile ratio was investigated and a quadratic model was {{suggested by the}} methodology to correlate the variables to this volatile ratio. The {{results indicated that the}} model was in good agreement with the experimental data at a correlation coefficient (R 2) of 0. 9782, and the most influential parameter on efficiency was identified as the dosage of CaCl 2 addition. The optimum conditions for <b>chloridizing</b> <b>roasting</b> from the high copper pyrite cinder were identified as a dosage of CaCl 2 addition of 4. 8 wt%, a roasting time of 19. 28 min and a roasting temperature of 1151. 51 °C; under such conditions, a copper volatile ratio of 97. 82 % was achieved. The pellets obtained by this process are characterized by a high content of hematite, and the main impurity element contents are consistent with the requirements for iron concentrate, which is suitable for use in ironmaking...|$|E
40|$|Experiments were {{performed}} to evaluate the technical feasibility of selectively separating selected rare earth halides (bromides and chlorides) using a volatilization and condensation technique. Initially, optimum <b>chloridizing</b> and bromidizing <b>roast</b> parameters were secured in studies performed on reagent grade rare earth oxide samples and subsequently confirmed in tests performed on mineral ore and concentrate samples. The volatilization and condensation experiments {{were performed}} by placing the subject rare earth halide samples in an argon-purged multiple-zone tube furnace wherein the temperature profile was controlled to establish separate vaporization and condensation regions. Following each experiment, condensate and solid residue samples were analyzed to determine their respective rare earth element contents. The analytical results indicate potential exists for separating the more volatile halide species from those with relatively low vapor pressures; separation of species with intermediate vapor pressures was inconclusive. In most experiments, the rare earth halide vaporization efficiencies were severely limited by the extremely hygroscopic nature of the rare earth halides coupled with their high affinities for oxygen. At elevated temperatures, the hydrates react with halides to produce rare earth oxyhalides and oxides, which are not volatile at the temperatures (up to 1400 °C) considered in this research...|$|R
40|$|Soil from an abandoned/disused {{fertilizer}} plant polluted with pyrite ash containing heavy metal(loid) s (As, Cu, Pb, and Zn) {{was treated}} {{by means of}} physical and chemical washing. We first performed an exhaustive characterization of the soil-pollutant interaction, which allowed us to determine the chemical nature (complex oxyhydroxides), potential mobility and bioavailability of the pollutants (very low), {{as well as the}} grain size fractions of preferential accumulation (silt-clay fraction comprises more than 60 % of the material and revealed contents well above 2. 000  ppm of Cu, Zn and Pb). Soil/ash samples were subjected to a number of chemical washing trials, including leaching with 2  M HCl, 2  M NaOH and acidic process water (pH around 0). The fraction below 63  µm was mechanically separated and exposed to additional leaching tests e. g. <b>chloridizing</b> <b>roasting</b> with NaCl plus water leaching. Of all the tested procedures, the latter proved the most effective, particularly with regard to Cu and Zn recovery (recoveries up to 40 % and 34 %, respectively). The information gathered offers an insight into the modes and rates at which metals can be leached from pyrite ashes after <b>chloridizing</b> <b>roasting</b> as a prelude to more extensive soil washing feasibility studies focused on potential metal recovery...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In recent years, {{photovoltaic}} {{industry has}} developed rapidly[1]. Facing {{the situation of}} traditional energy resources exhaustion and continuing oil price rise, solar energy as a renewable clean energy {{has been the focus}} of world attention. In all kinds of solar battery, polysilicon solar cell is the most important. However, the high cost of polysilicon, which accounts for 50 % of the total cost, hinders the development of photovoltaic industry. In this paper, for the purpose of reducing cost of polysilicon production, metallurgy methods, for example, <b>chloridizing</b> <b>roasting</b> has been applied for purification. A feasible technological route for polysilicon purifying was developed...|$|E
