Seven different blends of Thevetia peruviana and Jatropha curcas seed oil {{were used for}} this research. The seeds were obtained locally and oven dried until a constant weight was obtained, Thevetia peruviana seeds had 3. 91 % moisture content while Jatropha curcas seeds had 2. 93 % moisture content. The oils were thereafter extracted. Thevetia peruviana seeds {{were found to have}} 58. 5 % oil content while Jatropha curcas seeds had 54. 6 % oil content. The Chemo-physical tests of the oils indicated that the density of the oils were the same (908. 7 kg/m 3), and the flash point of Thevetia peruviana seed oil was 168 o C while that of Jatropha curcas seed oil was 122 o C; the viscosity at 100 o C for both oils fell within the range of 7. 2 - 7. 9 cSt for 400 pale oil 400 p, which is of petroleum origin. The viscosity index values for both oils were very high, hence very stable. Jatropha curcas oil had a viscosity index of 214 and Thevetia peruviana oil had 202. The grease was produced by cooking a calculated quantity of base oil and lithium stearate in a pot at 200 o C with continuous stirring for 30 minutes, the reaction was allowed to cool to 85 o C before sodium thiosulphate and <b>calcium</b> <b>sulphonate</b> additives were added to the reactor; further milling was maintained to yield a homogeneous product (lithium stearate grease) which were taken for analysis. Five classes of grease were produced from each oil blend; all the grease samples produced...|$|E

However, these {{techniques are}} also a valuable tool for assessing the anti-corrosive efficiency of protective coatings. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the performance of different coatings for their use in metallic heritage conservation using polarization resistance (Rp) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). Carbon steel samples were prepared to simulate the surface composition and morphology of historic steel artefacts, and coated by a conservator-restorer following the common practices in conservation treatments. Three commercial organic coatings have been studied: a microcrystalline wax (RenaissanceTM) and a methyl acrylate/ethyl methacrylate copolymer resin (ParaloidTM B- 72) dissolved in acetone –both them commonly used in conservation and restoration treatments– and a ethylene copolymer wax emulsion in water (PoligenTM ES- 91009), that has not been used so far for this purposes. Four commercial corrosion inhibitor additives were added to the ParaloidTM B- 72 resin and PoligenTM ES- 91009 wax. The additives were commercial preparations with the following known active components: a blend of triazoles (M 435), an ammonium salt of tricarboxylic acid (M 370), a <b>calcium</b> <b>sulphonate</b> (M 109), and a bis-oxazoline (Alkaterge-TTM). Rp and EIS results showed that the best protection of the steel specimens was afforded by PoligenTM ES- 91009 when applied in thick layers. None of the additives have shown a clear improvement of the protection properties of the coatings, and one of them impaired the barrier effect of the coating.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to {{summarize}} the research carried out {{that led to the}} development of measurement techniques which measure the water content of lubricating grease. A simple and effective grease mixing method for preparing grease samples was developed and tested for repeatability. <b>Calcium</b> <b>sulphonate</b> complex (CaS-X) grease was used in all experiments. The water content of these samples were also tested with time and temperature as added variables to study if and how much water will evaporate from the samples. Additionally, two measurement techniques were investigated: optical attenuation in the visible and near-infrared (NIR) region and with a dielectric measurement method. The optical attenuation investigation found that the attenuation ratio of two wavelengths of light appear to approximate the water content of grease samples with an acceptable coefficient of determination. Additionally, aged and oxidized grease were measured as well and were not found to affect the measurement results. The dielectric method uses the temperature dependence on the dielectric properties of water-contaminated grease to approximate the water content of the grease samples. An additional parameter of incomplete fill/coverage of the sensor has been investigated as a prestudy. Both methods were found to provide measurements of water content in the prepared grease samples (ranging from 0. 22 % to 5. 5 % added water). The dielectric measurement is likely going to be better for applications requiring the possibility of measuring a larger bulk of the grease within the bearing. It shows promise for providing an accurate and robust system for monitoring grease condition as well as the amount of grease contained. The optical measurement will likely provide additional information; however, it will only measure small point samples within the bearing instead of the larger bulk. This could be of use though, because the sensors could be small (in the several millimeter scale) and could measure where water damage is determined to be most important to detect at...|$|E

40|$|AIM: To {{establish}} the staining characteristics of certain {{ion exchange resins}} in histological material, {{with a view to}} enabling confident differential identification. METHODS: Various histological staining procedures were applied to selected pathological material and prepared agar blocks containing the cation exchange resin <b>calcium</b> polystyrene <b>sulphonate</b> and the anion exchange resin cholestyramine. RESULTS: <b>Calcium</b> polystyrene <b>sulphonate</b> uniquely stained strongly by a direct Schiff's reagent procedure without any preoxidation and by the Ziehl-Neelsen method. Cholestyramine was negative by the former method but stained strongly with a standard Congo red technique. CONCLUSIONS: These staining results are consistent with the known structure and properties of polystyrene sulphonate and cholestyramine resins. Polystyrene sulphonate resins have the virtually pathognomonic feature of direct Schiff positivity, while morphology, location, and strong non-birefringent Congo red positivity facilitate the identification of cholestyramine. It is possible that the intrinsic staining characteristics of cholestyramine may be lost once it has bound to its target...|$|R
