A mathematical model and a program, written in MATLAB code were used for calculating the {{efficiency of}} a {{flat plate solar collector}} for a domestic solar water heating system considering weather conditions of a city in Myanmar. This calculation includes three aspects. Firstly, the maximum solar energy availability for the flat plate solar <b>collector</b> <b>tilted</b> at the optimum angle was estimated.

Thirdly, the overall heat loss coefficient of the flat plate solar collector was calculated using a method of iteration. Through these calculations, the collector efficiency was obtained as a function of volume concentration and size of the nanoparticle. The results showed increasing in collector efficiency by increasing the volume concentration up to 2 % while the effect of nanoparticle size on the efficiency was marginal. The use of the CuO-water nanofluid as a working fluid could improve the efficiency of flat plate solar collector up to 5 % compared with water as a working fluid under the same ambient, radiant and operating conditions...|$|R

Larger cross sections for transporting the air are necessary. This results in rather complicated fluid distributions within the products. In this paper we combine simulation and experimental techniques providing {{a high level of}} detail. Highly resolved three dimensional fluid dynamic simulations contain all the relevant heat transfer mechanisms in a plate SAHC: Heat conduction, convection patterns and radiation are modelled in the two air gaps. In all solid materials of the collector only heat conduction has to be accounted for. For the exchange of heat between the two air zones the heat transfer through the absorber is modelled. Nevertheless careful simplification is needed to be able to concentrate on the important details. Furthermore we shed light on numerical instabilities observed in the air gap between absorber and glass in the simulated example. A consistent numerical description is given, concluding, that Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) is an appropriate tool for design and optimisation of SAHC concepts. The effects of <b>collector</b> <b>tilting,</b> insulation level and heat transfer surface increase have been assessed as a prove of applicability.

40|$|AbstractTranspired Solar Collectors (TSCs) are an {{increasingly}} popular technology, with over 12, 500 m 2 of TSCs integrated with buildings across Wales and England {{by the end}} of 2013. But in order for TSCs to achieve the desired low economic and embodied energy payback periods, their design, manufacture, installation and commissioning needs to be seamlessly integrated with that of the building as a whole. To facilitate the selection and integration of a TSC in the earliest stages of building design, a new feasibility tool for Transpired Solar Collectors has been developed.

40|$|The {{presented}} {{low temperature}} solar thermal electric generation system mainly consists of compound parabolic concentrators (CPC) and the Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) working with HCFC- 123. A novel design is proposed to reduce heat transfer irreversibility between conduction oil and HCFC- 123 {{in the heat}} exchangers while maintaining the stability of electricity output. Mathematical formulations are developed to study the heat transfer and energy conversion processes and the numerical simulation is carried out based on distributed parameters. Annual performances of the proposed system in different areas of Canberra, Singapore, Bombay, Lhasa, Sacramento and Berlin are simulated. The influences of the <b>collector</b> <b>tilt</b> angle adjustment, {{the connection between the}} heat exchangers and the CPC collectors, and the ORC evaporation temperature on the system performance are investigated. The results indicate that the three factors {{have a major impact on}} the annual electricity output and should be the key points of optimization. And the optimized system shows that: (1) The annual received direct irradiance can be significantly increased by two or three times optimal adjustments even when the CPC concentration ratio is smaller than 3. 0. (2) Compared with the traditional single-stage collectors, two-stage collectors connected with the heat exchangers by two thermal oil cycles can improve the collector efficiency by 8. 1 - 20. 9 % in the simultaneous processes of heat collection and power generation. (3) On the use of the market available collectors the optimal ORC evaporation temperatures in most of the simulated areas are around 120 Â Â°C.

40|$|Monthly averages {{of daily}} global {{radiation}} incident upon a tilted southfacing surface were computed from the available values of global, direct or {{diffuse solar radiation}} incident upon a horizontal surface for Limón, Fabio Baudrit, Palmar Sur and Santa Rosa. Also there were computed monthly averages hourly values of global radiation for tilt angles of 10 and 30 degrees, with experimental data in Heredia over the period from Abril to June of 1991. In order to obtain the maximum output from a solar energy system, it is found by using different models, that the <b>collector</b> optimum <b>tilt</b> angle {{has to be in}} the range 5 - 30 degrees, for September, October, November, December, January and February, and 0 degrees for the other months of the year; with higher angles in January and December. Also it is found, by using experimental data in Heredia, that 0 degrees is the optimum hourly tilt angle for April, May and June. The curves in this paper will be useful for large scale installations of solar collectors or photovoltaic panels in terrain with variable slopes in the geographic regions of the Central Valley (represented by Fabio Baudrit), North Pacific (represented by Santa Rosa), South Pacific (represented by Palmar Sur) and the Atlantic (represented by Limón) ...|$|R
40|$|Two Simplex {{computer}} library packages for multivariate optimization {{have been tested}} on an hour-by-hour simulation of a solar water heating system. The two packages are: MINUITS written at CERN (Geneva), and the E 04 CCF routine {{which is part of}} the UK Numerical Algorithms Group Library. Technical and economic optima have been derived for three of the following variables simultaneously: <b>collector</b> area, <b>tilt,</b> azimuth, and store volume. The two packages give the same results. The meteorological data used were one (composite) year for Hamburg (Germany) and 1964 for Kew (UK). The Hamburg data were also condensed to form a year consisting of 60 averaged days. The optima derived with the 60 -day year were very close to those obtained with the 365 -day year. The Simplex method, which is a direct search method, is known to be very robust. It is particularly suited to hour-by-hour simulations of solar heating systems since the function being minimized is not monotonically decreasing towards the minimum in sufficient significant figures. For this reason, optimization methods which use derivatives are not appropriate unless the system performance is first expressed as a differentiable function. Because the Simplex method can be used directly on hour-by-hour simulations, it is extremely flexible and can be applied to a simulation of any system...|$|R
40|$|This study aims {{to analyze}} the {{performance}} of the water heater using solar collector flat plate type. Efficiency performance of solar collectors in the process of heating the water also becomes the main focus in this study. This study was conducted with two experiments consisting of a flat plate solar collector with horizontal and flat plate solar <b>collector</b> with <b>tilt</b> angle 22 o. Experiments carried out with 8 hours of testing within 6 days. Water was circulated into the collector pipe using a pump capacity of 125 Watts. From the research it is known that the amount of electrical energy required by pump for 6 days with 8 -hour time trial experiment, was about 21. 6 MJ. The rate of flow of the fluid in the collector pipe is 2 x 10 - 5 m 3 /s. The plate solar collector with a slope of 22 o reached the highest average temperature in the third experiment, which was about 64. 7 ° C; however, the lowest average temperature was found in the horizontal collector (0 o) at the third experiment, which was about 47. 5 ° C. It was found that the highest efficiency obtained at the collector plate with 22 o tilt angle was equal to 76 % while the lowest efficiency was obtained at a horizontal collector with an efficiency of 53. 6 %.   Keywords: solar collectors, flat plate, water heate...|$|R
