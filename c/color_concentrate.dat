40|$|Mixing is a {{critical}} function in most extrusion operations. One {{of the most difficult}} mixing tasks is backmixing. An extrusion operation where good backmixing is very important is when a low percentage <b>color</b> <b>concentrate,</b> CC, is added to a virgin polymer. In this case, the initial distance between the CC pellets may be 100 mm or greater. If the final striation thickness needs to be reduced to the micron level, the reduction of the striation thickness needs to be at least five orders of magnitude – this is quite a tough task! This paper will analyze how the velocity profiles, axial mixing, and residence time distribution are related. It will be shown why simple conveying screws have poor axial mixing capability. New mixer geometries that are specifically designed to improve backmixing will be discussed. Results from extrusion experiments will be presented...|$|E

The minimum value k such that there exists a k-coloring of G is called the chromatic number of G. Dierent choices of the mapping f and of the image set of f, give rise to dierent concepts of coloring of graphs. For example, if the image set of f is the set U r of unit length arcs of a circumference of length r, an r-circular coloring is a mapping from V (G) to U r such that f(x) f(y) =; for xy 2 E(G).

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} a novel binarization algorithm for color document images. Conventional thresholding methods {{do not produce}} satisfactory binarization results for documents with close or mixed foreground colors and background colors. Initially, statistical image features are extracted from the luminance dis-tribution. Then, a decision-tree based binarization method is pro-posed, which selects various color features to binarize color docu-ment images. First, if the document image <b>colors</b> are <b>concentrated</b> within a limited range, saturation is employed. Second, if the image foreground colors are significant, luminance is adopted. Third, if the image background <b>colors</b> are <b>concentrated</b> within a limited range, luminance is also applied. Fourth, if {{the total number of}} pixels with low luminance (less than 60) is limited, saturation is applied; else both luminance and saturation are employed. Our experiments include 519 color images, most of which are uniform invoice and name-card document images. The proposed binariza-tion method generates better results than other available methods in shape and connected-component measurements. Also, the bina-rization method obtains higher recognition accuracy in a commer-cial OCR system than other comparable methods.

40|$|This {{performance}} project {{focused on}} English viola literature {{written in the}} first half of the twentieth century. During this time, numerous English composers were influenced by Lionel Tertis' unprecedented approach to the viola as a virtuosic and solo instrument. In addition to being an inspiration to composers of whom he was not in direct contact, Tertis' innovative vision for the viola led to numerous collaborations with prominent English composers of his generation. Ralph Vaughan Williams, Arnold Bax, York Bowen, Frank Bridge, Benjamin Britten, and Rebecca Clarke -his own protégé - composed some of the most important works for viola thus directly shaping the impression of the instrument as we know it today. Tertis' artistry as a performing violist was unmatched at the beginning of the twentieth century. He had a unique approach to the instrument which focused on concept of sound, tone <b>color,</b> <b>concentrated</b> listening, continuous vibrato, discreet portamento, and expressive interpretation. His convincing musical and technical ideas led him to write a treatise about how to achieve a beautiful tone. His passion for teaching and concern for the viola's posterity greatly enhanced the development of the viola. Tertis transcribed, edited, and premiered many works during his career. The music that Lionel Tertis influenced can be seen as a microcosm for a musical resurgence in England during the first half of the twentieth-century. The catalyst for this was artistic influences in the form of nationalism, folk music, romanticism, modernism, and impressionism, among others. Before this, England was widely referred to as ''the land without music" but in a very real sense,. Lionel Tertis was one of the pioneers who, through his artistry of the viola, led the way to the renaissance of music in England in the twentieth century...|$|R

Cooper who joined in 1958 as a chemist from Firestone Tire and Rubber Company. Both men acquired equal shares of The Caldwell Company making them President and Vice President of the company. [...] On September 2, 1959 the first manufacturing plant was opened on Home Ave. in Akron, OH. This {{was the beginning of}} The Caldwell Co. manufacturing its own products. With the change in business operations, The Caldwell Co. quickly changed their name to Americhem Inc. The newly named company began regularly producing their own products in 1960. With funding from issuance of bonds, Americhem was able to develop a number of new commercial products. By the end of 1964, Americhem was manufacturing <b>color</b> <b>concentrates</b> for ABS, many of which were used for the RV industry. In July 1965, Americhem Headquarters was moved to a new building in Cuyahoga Falls, Ohio. There was also an expansion with manufacturing in 1969 when a new plant was purchased in Medina, OH. Also in 1969, Americhem designed and manufactured the first masterbatches for vinyl siding. This marked the company’s first step into the building products industry. Americhem then {{became a member of the}} Vinyl Siding Institute and helped invent tests along with standards for weathering and durability that are still used today. Americhem was one of the first companies to use IBM System/3 computers and ACS Color Matching computers that were installed in 1972. Then in 1973, they opened their first out of state plant located in Elgin, Illinois. This plant eventually became the new location of the Medina, OH plant. The 1973 oil crisis devastated the automotive industry, which in turn severely affected sales at Americhem. During this time, Americhem gained business in the packaging and construction industries, which led to an upturn in profits. In 1974, partial owner Harvey Cooper retired, leaving ownership of Americhem Inc. to Richard Juve who became majority owner. [...] In 1978, Americhem reached a milestone when opening their first research department. The new laboratory led to the production of Americhem’s first <b>color</b> <b>concentrates</b> for synthetic fibers in response to the new developments of nylon and polyester dispersion technology. In 1987, Americhem received “Best Technical Paper” for the presentation “Weathering Metamerism: A Photochemical Process” and again in 1988 for “Refractive Index: A Key to Understanding Color Difference.” Around the same time, Americhem purchased Colourfast Plastics Ltd. in England to expand their international presence. Then, in order to be strategically located in the heart of the textile industry, Americhem opened a plant in Concord, North Carolina in 1989. Americhem opened a new plant on Steels Corners Road in Cuyahoga Falls, OH in 1998” In 2001, Americhem introduced a polyester solution dye product line for automotive interiors which still continues to be an excellent market that the company excels in. A plant was opened in 2002 located in the carpet capital of the world, Dalton, Georgia. Americhem continued to expand internationally with the establishment of the Luxembourg sales office in 2003, the Mexico City sales office in 2004, and the Suzhou, China plant that opened in 2006 and was expanded in 2014. [...] In the early 2000s, Americhem introduced the first variegated wood grain products for composite deck board applications in 2005, an outdoor color line for polyester fibers, and a low heat build-up technology for dark construction colors in 2006.In 2007, a new company logo and brand were introduced to the market.

Unlike white people, people of color were socially and legally barred from taking advantage of federal government policy encouraging suburban flight. For example, the early construction of freeways coupled with practices such as redlining and racially restrictive covenants, physically prevented people of color from participating in the mass migration to the suburbs, leaving them in - what would become - hollowed and blighted city cores. Because income and race are deeply embedded in understanding the formation of suburbs and shrinking cities, any interventions responding to the shrinking city phenomenon will almost invariably confront issues of social and environmental justice. It is not the case in Europe, where suburbanization has been less extreme, and drivers of shrinking cities are also more closely linked to aging demographics, and deindustrialization.|$|R
