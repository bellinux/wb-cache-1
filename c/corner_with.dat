5|$|During {{the late}} 18th century, plans {{were made to}} replace the old toll gate at Hyde Park <b>Corner</b> <b>with</b> a grander entrance, {{following}} the gentrification of the area surrounding it. The first design was put forward by Robert Adam in 1778 as a grand archway, followed by John Soane's 1796 proposal {{to build a new}} palace adjacent to the corner in Green Park.|$|E

5|$|After {{allegations}} that the design contractor had inflated costs for the tunnel {{in order to avoid}} sharing the job with an outside tunneling contractor, the long tunnel concept was revived in April 2006. The allegations led to calls for an outside cost estimate to determine more realistic tunnel costs. On May 15, 2006, Virginia Transportation Secretary Pierce R. Homer announced the creation of an advisory panel headed by the American Society of Civil Engineers. The panel had about two months to evaluate options for completing the line through Tysons <b>Corner,</b> <b>with</b> the results presented to the state on July 27, 2006 and published on July 31, 2006.|$|E
5|$|Häkkinen {{started the}} race {{alongside}} Michael Schumacher {{on the front}} row of the grid. Michael Schumacher attempted to defend his lead off the line by moving into Häkkinen's path, but Häkkinen passed Michael Schumacher heading into the first <b>corner,</b> <b>with</b> Coulthard withstanding Williams driver Ralf Schumacher attempts to pass him to maintain third position. Michael Schumacher managed to close the gap to his title rival by lap 31 and passed Häkkinen during the second round of pit stops. This allowed him to maintain a 1.9-second gap between himself and Häkkinen {{towards the end of the}} race to secure his eighth victory of the season.|$|E
5|$|Keselowski {{retained}} his {{pole position}} lead {{into the first}} <b>corner,</b> <b>with</b> Bowyer behind him. One lap later, Stewart passed Keselowski to become the new race leader; Montoya passed Keselowski for the second position on the next lap. By lap eight, Stewart had a lead of over one second. After starting the race in twelfth, Kurt Busch moved up to ninth position by lap nine. Paul Menard, who started in eighth, fell to eleventh position by lap twelve. After losing two positions early, Bowyer moved back up into third position by passing Keselowski. By the nineteenth lap, Johnson had moved up eight positions to seventeenth, and Harvick had moved up seven positions to twentieth.|$|E

5|$|State Route 149 (SR 149) {{is a short}} {{state highway}} that helps to connect Oroville and Chico through rural Butte County. Connecting State Route 70 at Wicks <b>Corner</b> <b>with</b> State Route 99 east of Durham, it forms part of the primary northsouth highway through the eastern Sacramento Valley, a Focus Route of the Interregional Road System. SR 149 was {{formerly}} part of the Oroville-Chico Highway; {{the majority of the}} latter was merged into other routes. In the mid-1970s, the highway was reallocated onto a newer two-lane alignment. A project to widen the two-lane road to a four-lane expressway was completed in late 2008, removing the bottleneck from the Oroville-Chico highway.|$|E
5|$|The club's {{original}} crest was a quartered diamond-shaped crest {{topped by}} the Crown of Aragon and the bat of King James, {{and surrounded by}} two branches, one of a laurel tree {{and the other a}} palm. In 1910, the club held a competition among its members to design a new crest. The winner was Carles Comamala, who at the time played for the club. Comamala's suggestion became the crest that the club wears today, with some minor variations. The crest consists of the St George Cross in the upper-left <b>corner</b> <b>with</b> the Catalan flag beside it, and the team colours at the bottom.|$|E

5|$|Willet Street is a {{northbound}} {{one-way street}} comprising three blocks, {{stretching from the}} southeastern corner of the park at the intersection with Madison Avenue to the northeastern <b>corner</b> <b>with</b> State Street. All of Willett Street is in the historic district, including approximately 33 buildings. The street is entirely residential except for the First Presbyterian Church, built in 1883 on the <b>corner</b> <b>with</b> State Street. Willett Street has many different styles including Queen Anne, Spanish Revival, Classical revival, Georgian, Romanesque, Italianate, and brownstones. Two larger apartment buildings, built in 1909 and 1927, break up the otherwise continuous row of older townhouses. One of those apartment buildings is the Willett, formerly the Wareham, a five-story building built in 1909 that spans 84–92 Willett Street. This building sits on a former site of the New York State Normal College, predecessor to the University at Albany, which burned in 1906. The oldest building on Willett to maintain its original facade, 22 Willett, was built in 1872. Nearby 28 Willett Street was the home of Martin Glynn, an owner {{and publisher of the}} Albany Times Union, a state comptroller, and the governor of New York from 1913 to 1914. Glynn was the first Catholic New York governor and the only longtime Albany resident to reach that position.|$|E
5|$|Coventry Street {{has been}} a centre for {{high-volume}} food outlets. The first J. Lyons and Co. Corner House was built on Coventry Street in 1907, on the west <b>corner</b> <b>with</b> Rupert Street. It {{was one of the}} first buildings in London to have a white-glazed terracotta exterior. In 1920, the former premises of Lamberts at Nos.10–12 were demolished in order to accommodate an extension that could accommodate up to 3,000 diners. Scott's Restaurant first operated in Coventry Street. Originally opening as an oyster warehouse in 1872 at No.18 as part of the London Pavilion, it moved to No.19 in 1891, expanding as a full restaurant. The restaurant moved to Mount Street in Mayfair in 1967. In 1887, the Leicester, a public house, opened at the corner of Coventry Street and Wardour Street. It closed in 1927 so the neighbouring department store could expand.|$|E

5|$|During {{the second}} leg, on Friday, 2 May, at the seventh {{kilometre}} of the 18th stage, Corte–Taverna, Toivonen's Lancia {{went off the}} side of the road at a tight left <b>corner</b> <b>with</b> no guardrail. The car plunged down a ravine and crashed on its roof. The aluminium fuel tank underneath the driver's seat was ruptured by the trees and exploded. The fuel tank was not protected by a skid plate, an item used mainly on gravel rallies, which was not fitted for the all-asphalt Tour de Corse. The explosion happened within seconds of the crash, and Toivonen and his co-driver, Sergio Cresto would not have time to get out had they still been alive. The fire caused by the explosion was so intense that the Delta S4, built of fast-burning kevlar-reinforced plastic composite, was unidentifiable as a car afterwards. Both Toivonen and Cresto died in their seats. Toivonen left behind wife Erja (married in 1982) and two young children, son Markus and daughter Arla, while Cresto was single with no children.|$|E
5|$|Early in {{the race}} John Downie crashed into a pub in Ballasalla, but the car did not sustain {{extensive}} damage {{and he was able}} to continue the race. At Keppel Gate on the Mountain Road, Frederick Bennett, who had been unable to take part in the practice sessions and therefore did not know the course very well, approached a <b>corner</b> <b>with</b> too much speed in his Cadillac and crashed, ripping off two of the wheels. Bennett managed to stay in the vehicle and avoided serious injury. Another driver to go off the track was J. Hadley in his Wolseley, who also carried too much speed into a corner, leading him to drive off through a hedge and into a field. The Thornycroft driven by Tom Thornycroft had been following closely behind, and the two cars collided during the incident, damaging one of the Thornycroft's rear wheels. Napier in his Arrol-Johnston made the quickest circuit of the first lap in one hour, 32 minutes and 36 seconds.|$|E
5|$|Galatasaray's Ergün Penbe {{stepped up}} {{to take the first}} spot kick and scored. He placed the ball inside the near {{right-hand}} corner, just past Seaman, who dived to his left. Davor Šuker was the first man up to take Arsenal's penalty kick. His effort proved to be unsuccessful, as the ball hit the left-hand post and bounced off the goal. Şükür became the next player to take Galatasaray's spot kick. He scored as he lobbed the ball in the right-hand <b>corner.</b> <b>With</b> Galatasaray leading 2–0, Arsenal's next penalty taker was Parlour. He placed the ball on the spot and successfully scored by burying the ball to Taffarel's right to make it 2–1. Ümit Davala calmly placed the goal, near the centre of the goal to make it 3–1 to Galatasaray. Arsenal's only hope now was Vieira, but the midfielder missed and hit the crossbar instead. Popescu then stepped up, and netted with a powerful shot, as Galatasaray won the penalty shoot-out 4–1.|$|E

5|$|Johnson {{retained}} his {{pole position}} lead {{into the first}} <b>corner,</b> <b>with</b> Speed behind him. Two laps later, Harvick had moved into fourth position; Jamie McMurray, who began the race in eleventh, had moved up four positions to seventh place. By lap six, Ambrose began to reduce the lead of Johnson, and Martin got loose on the same lap but regained control of his car. On lap nine, Stewart passed Martin for fourth. One lap later, Ambrose passed Johnson to become the new race leader. On lap 13, Johnson retook the lead off Ambrose. After having made three positions early, Harvick moved up into second position by passing Ambrose. On lap 16, Ambrose's car suffered a flat tire and came into the pit road.|$|E
5|$|Lewis Hamilton {{made it a}} clean {{sweep of}} fastest times in {{practice}} on Saturday morning, setting a time of 1:30.904, again less than {{a tenth of a}} second ahead of Rosberg. The session started in wet conditions following a rain shower thirty minutes before it commenced. It was interrupted with 22 minutes to go, after Marcus Ericsson crashed heavily at the exit of Stowe <b>corner.</b> <b>With</b> the car cleared from the track, lengthy repair work at the barriers followed, leaving just five minutes of running when practice was restarted. The drivers then set their fastest times of the session. Again, it were the Red Bull drivers closest to the Mercedes, with Ricciardo ahead of Verstappen in third, both about half a second off Hamilton's time. Ericsson was sent to hospital for tests following his accident and received a five-place grid penalty since his gearbox had to be changed. Vettel received the same penalty after his gearbox failed {{towards the end of the}} third practice session.|$|E
5|$|Mooney was {{recalled}} {{from his}} loan at Alfreton {{as a result}} of the one-match suspension Olejnik received for his red card. Winfield scored a 73rd-minute header from a Summerfield corner as York beat their relegation rivals Cheltenham 1–0 at home. York moved six points of the relegation zone after drawing 0–0 away to Oxford. Winfield was sent off in the first half of York's 1–0 home win over relegation-threatened Hartlepool, Summerfield scoring the winning goal during the second half with a deflected 30-yard shot. York ensured their safety from relegation after beating Morecambe 2–1 at home, moving 11 points clear of the relegation zone in 18th-place. Morecambe took the lead through Paul Mullin before Zubar converted Summerfield's <b>corner</b> <b>with</b> a far post header, and Penn scored the winning goal with a long-range strike into the top left-hand corner.|$|E
