5000|$|The {{length of}} an indoor cricket pitch {{is the same}} as a {{conventional}} cricket pitch, and has 3 stumps at each end, but there the similarities end. The pitch is marked in line with the stumps at each end, and is 1.83 metres in width at the batting end and 2.47 metres at the bowling end, with the stumps in the centre, and the middle stumps are 20 metres apart. The popping crease is in front of, and parallel with, the wicket lines at both ends. At the bowler's end, the pitch is specified as the line extending between the return creases and will be called the bowler's crease or the front foot line. The return creases of the pitch at the bowler's end is marked by a lines at right angles to the bowling crease to the line of the wickets. The return <b>creases</b> are <b>marked</b> 1.22 metres from the middle stump on the line of the wicket.

40|$|Objective: Sharp {{division}} of the A 1 pulley is a time-honored technique {{for the treatment of}} flexor tendon entrapment; however, this procedure is not without complications. The anatomy of the A 1 pulley system has been carefully investigated. Knowledge of superficial anatomic landmarks can assist with demarcating the distal edge of the A 1 pulley and prevent damage to the critical A 2 pulley. Methods: Nine fresh cadaveric hands were dissected with the aid of loupe magnification. On the basis of known anatomic landmarks of the proximal portion of the cruciate (C 0) pulley, percutaneous placement of a 25 -gauge needle 5 mm proximal to the palmar digital <b>crease</b> <b>marked</b> the distal extent of the trigger finger release. Sharp {{division of}} the A 1 pulley was performed with a scalpel until the needle was encountered, thus completing the release. Results: A complete release of the pulley was achieved in all specimens with preservation of the A 2 pulley. No digital nerve or artery injuries were noted with open inspection of the flexor sheath. Conclusion: Percutaneous marking of the distal extent of the A 1 pulley is a safe and reliable method that not only ensures complete release of the A 1 pulley but also preserves the A 2 pulley. The placement of a small gauge needle adds no morbidity to this minimally invasive technique...|$|R

40|$|In 1997, Jack Edmonds {{posed as}} an open problem the {{computational}} complexity of deciding whether a given m x n map-rectangular paper with {{horizontal and vertical}} <b>creases,</b> each <b>marked</b> mountain or valley-has a flat folded state. This problem has remained open since then, even for the 2 x n case. This thesis presents several theoretical contributions to this problem. Most significantly, it presents an O(n⁹) time algorithm for deciding the flat foldability of a 2 x n map. To achieve this result, this thesis makes a sequence of reductions which ultimately lead to a new general hidden tree problem, where {{the goal is to}} construct a "valid" tree on a given polynomial set of candidate vertices, given oracles to navigate hypothetical partially constructed trees. To complete the algorithm, it is shown that the hidden tree problem can be solved in polynomial time using dynamic programming. Additionally, several faster algorithms are given for special cases of 2 x n map folding. This thesis goes on to extend this algorithm to optimization variants of the problem. In particular, by certain metrics it finds the simplest flat folded state achievable by a given 2 x n map in polynomial time. This thesis also provides results for the general m x n map folding problem. It presents a set of nontrivial necessary conditions for an m x n map to be flat foldable, that are checkable in polynomial. Additionally, this thesis presents a fixed parameter tractable algorithm for the m x n map folding problem, where the parameter is the entropy in the partial order induced by the mountain valley pattern on the cells of the map. by Thomas D.

40|$|In {{the current}} cosmological paradigm, an {{initially}} flat three-dimensional manifold that pervades space (the `dark-matter sheet') folds up to build concentrations of mass (galaxies), and a cosmic web between them. Galaxies are nodes, {{connected by a}} network of filaments and walls. The folding is in six-dimensional (3 D position, plus 3 D velocity) phase space. The positions of <b>creases,</b> or caustics, <b>mark</b> the edges of structures. Here, I introduce an origami approximation to cosmological structure formation, in which the dark-matter sheet {{is not allowed to}} stretch. But it still produces an idealized cosmic web, with nodes, filaments, walls and voids. In 2 D, nodes form in `polygonal collapse' (a twist-fold in origami), necessarily generating filaments simultaneously. In 3 D, nodes form in `polyhedral collapse,' simultaneously generating filaments and walls. The masses, spatial arrangement, and angular momenta of nodes and filaments are related in the model. I describe some `tetrahedral collapse', or tetrahedral twist-fold, models.

2500|$|Law 7: The creases. This law {{sets out}} the {{dimensions}} and {{locations of the}} creases. The bowling crease, which is the line the stumps {{are in the middle}} of, is drawn {{at each end of the}} pitch so that the three stumps at that end of the pitch fall on it (and consequently it is perpendicular to the imaginary line joining the centres of both middle stumps). Each bowling crease should be [...] in length, centred on the middle stump at each end, and each bowling crease terminates at one of the return creases. The popping crease, which determines whether a batsman is in his ground or not, and which is used in determining front-foot no balls (see Law 21), is drawn at each end of the pitch in front of each of the two sets of stumps. The popping crease must be [...] in front of and parallel to the bowling crease.

40|$|It {{is known}} already from 1970 ´s that laser beam is {{suitable}} for processing paper materials. In this thesis, term paper materials mean all wood-fibre based materials, like dried pulp, copy paper, newspaper, cardboard, corrugated board, tissue paper etc. Accordingly, laser processing in this thesis means all laser treatments resulting material removal, like cutting, partial cutting, <b>marking,</b> <b>creasing,</b> perforation etc. {{that can be used}} to process paper materials. Laser technology provides many advantages for processing of paper materials: non-contact method, freedom of processing geometry, reliable technology for non-stop production etc. Especially packaging industry is very promising area for laser processing applications. However, there are only few industrial laser processing applications worldwide even in beginning of 2010 ´s. One reason for small-scale use of lasers in paper material manufacturing is that there is a shortage of published research and scientific articles. Another problem, restraining the use of laser for processing of paper materials, is colouration of paper material i. e. the yellowish and/or greyish colour of cut edge appearing during cutting or after cutting. These are the main reasons for selecting the topic of this thesis to concern characterization of interaction of laser beam and paper materials. This study was carried out in Laboratory of Laser Processing at Lappeenranta University of Technology (Finland). Laser equipment used in this study was TRUMPF TLF 2700 carbon dioxide laser that produces a beam with wavelength of 10. 6 μm with power range of 190 - 2500 W (laser power on work piece). Study of laser beam and paper material interaction was carried out by treating dried kraft pulp (grammage of 67 g m- 2) with different laser power levels, focal plane postion settings and interaction times. Interaction between laser beam and dried kraft pulp was detected with different monitoring devices, i. e. spectrometer, pyrometer and active illumination imaging system. This way it was possible to create an input and output parameter diagram and to study the effects of input and output parameters in this thesis. When interaction phenomena are understood also process development can be carried out and even new innovations developed. Fulfilling the lack of information on interaction phenomena can assist in the way of lasers for wider use of technology in paper making and converting industry. It was concluded in this thesis that interaction of laser beam and paper material has two mechanisms that are dependent on focal plane position range. Assumed interaction mechanism B appears in range of average focal plane position of 3. 4 mm and 2. 4 mm and assumed interaction mechanism A in range of average focal plane position of 0. 4 mm and - 0. 6 mm both in used experimental set up. Focal plane position 1. 4 mm represents midzone of these two mechanisms. Holes during laser beam and paper material interaction are formed gradually: first small hole is formed to interaction area in the centre of laser beam cross-section and after that, as function of interaction time, hole expands, until interaction between laser beam and dried kraft pulp is ended. By the image analysis it can be seen that in beginning of laser beam and dried kraft pulp material interaction small holes off very good quality are formed. It is obvious that black colour and heat affected zone appear as function of interaction time. This reveals that there still are different interaction phases within interaction mechanisms A and B. These interaction phases appear as function of time and also as function of peak intensity of laser beam. Limit peak intensity is the value that divides interaction mechanism A and B from one-phase interaction into dual-phase interaction. So all peak intensity values under limit peak intensity belong to MAOM (interaction mechanism A one-phase mode) or to MBOM (interaction mechanism B onephase mode) and values over that belong to MADM (interaction mechanism A dual-phase mode) or to MBDM (interaction mechanism B dual-phase mode). Decomposition process of cellulose is evolution of hydrocarbons when temperature is between 380 - 500 °C. This means that long cellulose molecule is split into smaller volatile hydrocarbons in this temperature range. As temperature increases, decomposition process of cellulose molecule changes. In range of 700 - 900 °C, cellulose molecule is mainly decomposed into H 2 gas; this is why this range is called evolution of hydrogen. Interaction in this range starts (as in range of MAOM and MBOM), when a small good quality hole is formed. This is due to “direct evaporation” of pulp via decomposition process of evolution of hydrogen. And this can be seen can be seen in spectrometer as high intensity peak of yellow light (in range of 588 - 589 nm) which refers to temperature of ~ 1750 ºC. Pyrometer does not detect this high intensity peak since it is not able to detect physical phase change from solid kraft pulp to gaseous compounds. As interaction time between laser beam and dried kraft pulp continues, hypothesis is that three auto ignition processes occurs. Auto ignition of substance is the lowest temperature in which it will spontaneously ignite in a normal atmosphere without an external source of ignition, such as a flame or spark. Three auto ignition processes appears in range of MADM and MBDM, namely: 1. temperature of auto ignition of hydrogen atom (H 2) is 500 ºC, 2. temperature of auto ignition of carbon monoxide molecule (CO) is 609 ºC and 3. temperature of auto ignition of carbon atom (C) is 700 ºC. These three auto ignition processes leads to formation of plasma plume which has strong emission of radiation in range of visible light. Formation of this plasma plume can be seen as increase of intensity in wavelength range of ~ 475 - 652 nm. Pyrometer shows maximum temperature just after this ignition. This plasma plume is assumed to scatter laser beam so that it interacts with larger area of dried kraft pulp than what is actual area of beam cross-section. This assumed scattering reduces also peak intensity. So result shows that assumably scattered light with low peak intensity is interacting with large area of hole edges and due to low peak intensity this interaction happens in low temperature. So interaction between laser beam and dried kraft pulp turns from evolution of hydrogen to evolution of hydrocarbons. This leads to black colour of hole edges...|$|R
