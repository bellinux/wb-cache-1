The agent also could make deliberate and subtle changes in his keying, to alert his side that he had been turned. While Morse is obsolete, voices are very recognizable and resistant to substitution. Even text communication can have patterns of grammar or word choice, known to the agent and his original service, that can hide a warning of capture.|$|E
50|$|Interoperable {{emergency}} {{communication is}} integral to initial response, public health, community safety, national security and economic stability. Of all the problems experienced during disaster events, {{one of the most}} serious, is poor communication due to lack of appropriate and efficient means to collect, process and timely transmit important information. In some cases, radio communication systems are incompatible and inoperable not just within a jurisdiction but within departments or agencies in the same community. Non-operability occurs due to use of outdated equipment, limited availability of radio frequencies, isolated or independent planning, lack of coordination, and cooperation, between agencies, community priorities competing for resources, funding and ownership, and <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>communications</b> systems. Recognizing and understanding this need, Project 25 (P25) was initiated collaboratively by public safety agencies and manufacturers to address the issue with emergency communication systems. P25 is a collaborative project to ensure that two-way radios are interoperable. The goal of P25 is to enable public safety responders {{to communicate with each other}} and, thus, achieve enhanced coordination, timely response, and efficient and effective use of communications equipment.|$|E

40|$|Although many skew-handling {{algorithms}} {{have been}} proposed for simple join operations, they remain generally inecient {{in the case of}} theta-join {{and in the case of}} multi-join. A new method for self-balancing equi-join operations on shared-nothing (SN) machines is proposed here. It offers deterministic and near-perfect load balancing through exible <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>communications</b> in intra-transaction parallelism. The new algorithm mixes a balanced data-distribution strategy with pure hash-join. Its predictably low join-product- and attribute-value skews make it suitable for repeated use in multi-join operations. Its tradeoff between balancing overhead and speedup is analyzed in the BSP (Bulk-synchronous parallel) computing model. The scalable model predicts a negligible join product skew and a near-linear speed-up in any combination of selectivity, skew and number of processors. This prediction is confirmed by a series of tests...|$|E
40|$|A {{system and}} method are {{disclosed}} that separate control functionality from the management functionality for conducting electronic transactions. The control functions are {{performed by a}} third party resulting in a low overhead since significant overhead is incurred {{in response to an}} anomalous event, thus facilitating high throughput electronic transactions when anomalous events are infrequent. Further, the third party does not need to have access to confidential information since it only controls by observing, validating and certifying the observed communications in a specified manner to prevent confidential information from leaving the context of the transaction. Management of the transactions based on consideration of substantive information is provided by the participants. A preferred system of the invention comprises a validation authority, a logical boundary at which validation authority undertakes <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>communications,</b> and validation rules specifying parameters for observation and the nature of comparisons...|$|E

40|$|This study {{examines}} the characteristics {{and nature of}} rumor via mobile communication in contemporary China. By focusing on six concrete case studies with 50 + in-depth interviews, this study observes that mobile phone-mediated rumor {{has evolved into a}} special form of popular resistance at the grassroots level. The low-cost and user-friendly mobile device lowers the average protest threshold, creating an unprecedented op-portunity for people, especially those without complicated communication skills, to organize, coordinate, or participate in resistance. The mutual visibility of meta-communication through mobile network greatly increases both credibility of information and sense of security for participation. Additionally, the synchronous mobile communication accumulates rumor dis-course into resistance in a very short time. As a new kind of contentious politics, rumor dissemination via mobile phones show the opposition to government censorship and <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>communications,</b> and most im-portant, the resistance against the use of the accusation of “rumor” by authorities to stifle any different voices...|$|E

Following my training as a social psychologist, I spent a number of years in the Army and was exposed at that time to the opportunity to study indoctrination methods used by the Chinese and North Koreans during the Korean conflict and on the mainland of China. This research resulted in the realization that a great deal of education is, in fact, socialization and indoctrination and that one must understand the dynamics of these processes in order to fully grasp the possible outcomes of an educational effort (Schein, 1961 a, 1968).
