5|$|Marvel vs. Capcom: Clash of Super Heroes was {{originally}} {{developed for the}} CP System II arcade system board. A direct Dreamcast port was revealed by the Computer Entertainment Software Association at the 1998 Tokyo Game Show. The Dreamcast version added the new game mode, Cross Fever, which permitted four-player gameplay. The game later received a PlayStation port. However, the console's RAM limitations required the developer to remove certain features, most notably the game's tag team element; thus, most game modes were restricted to two-character battles, instead of four. This reduced the player's secondary character to an assist role, similar to guest characters. To overcome the limitations, the PlayStation version had to implement a new gameplay mode called <b>Cross</b> <b>Over.</b> <b>Cross</b> <b>Over</b> Mode allows tag team play by forcing the players to fight with identical teams. For example, if Player 1 chooses Spider-Man and Player 2 chooses Ryu, then Ryu and Spider-Man would automatically be selected as Player 1 and Player 2's secondary characters, respectively. The game also added an art gallery, where players could view game art and ending animations. Many frames of animation were also omitted {{as a result of}} insufficient RAM, particularly in larger character sprites.|$|E

5|$|The Dreamcast {{version of}} Marvel vs. Capcom: Clash of Super Heroes {{includes}} five game modes: Arcade, Versus, Training, Survival, and Cross Fever.

The player can practice moves and combos in Training Mode, where they can also adjust certain settings, such as AI difficulty, and the number of bars available in the Hyper Combo Gauge. In Survival Mode, the player fights through waves of enemies with a time limit; in addition, the player's life gauge is carried over through each round. Cross Fever Mode allows four players to simultaneously compete in a two-on-two match. In place of Cross Fever, the PlayStation version features an exclusive mode called <b>Cross</b> <b>Over.</b> <b>Cross</b> <b>Over</b> is the only mode in the PlayStation port that permits tag team gameplay, which was removed due to the console's limited RAM capacity.|$|E
5|$|The arcade, Sega Saturn, and PlayStation {{versions}} of Marvel Super Heroes vs. Street Fighter share Arcade Mode and Versus Mode.

Upon defeating Apocalypse, the player must win against the final boss character, Cyber-Akuma. The PlayStation version includes three exclusive game modes: Training, Hero Battle, and <b>Cross</b> <b>Over.</b> Hero Battle is an endurance mode which pits the player against the characters {{that they did not}} select.
