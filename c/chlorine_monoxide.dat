2500|$|The Rowland–Molina {{hypothesis}} was strongly disputed {{by representatives of}} the aerosol and halocarbon industries. The Chair of the Board of DuPont {{was quoted as saying}} that ozone depletion theory is [...] "a science fiction tale … a load of rubbish … utter nonsense". Robert Abplanalp, the President of Precision Valve Corporation (and inventor of the first practical aerosol spray can valve), wrote to the Chancellor of UC Irvine to complain about Rowland's public statements. Nevertheless, within three years most of the basic assumptions made by Rowland and Molina were confirmed by laboratory measurements and by direct observation in the stratosphere. The concentrations of the source gases (CFCs and related compounds) and the chlorine reservoir species (HCl and [...] ) were measured throughout the stratosphere, and demonstrated that CFCs were indeed the major source of stratospheric chlorine, and that nearly all of the CFCs emitted would eventually reach the stratosphere. Even more convincing was the measurement, by James G. Anderson and collaborators, of <b>chlorine</b> <b>monoxide</b> (ClO) in the stratosphere. ClO is produced by the reaction of Cl with ozone—its observation thus demonstrated that Cl radicals not only were present in the stratosphere but also were actually involved in destroying ozone. McElroy and Wofsy extended the work of Rowland and Molina by showing that bromine atoms were even more effective catalysts for ozone loss than chlorine atoms and argued that the brominated organic compounds known as halons, widely used in fire extinguishers, were a potentially large source of stratospheric bromine. In 1976 the United States National Academy of Sciences released a report concluding that the ozone depletion {{hypothesis was}} strongly supported by the scientific evidence. [...] In response the United States, Canada and Norway banned the use of CFCs in aerosol spray cans in 1978. Early estimates were that, if CFC production continued at 1977 levels, the total atmospheric ozone would after a century or so reach a steady state, 15 to 18 percent below normal levels.

Hazardous waste permits will continue to be required for other waste management activities conducted at these facilities (such as storage and corrective action).

40|$|The {{technique}} of variable-angle, electron energy-loss spectroscopy {{has been used}} to study the electronic spectroscopy of the diketene molecule. The experiment was performed using incident electron beam energies of 25 eV and 50 eV, and at scattering angles between 10 ° and 90 °. The energy-loss region from 2 eV to 11 eV was examined. One spin-forbidden transition has been observed at 4. 36 eV and three others that are spin-allowed have been located at 5. 89 eV, 6. 88 eV and 7. 84 eV. Based on the intensity variation of these transitions with impact energy and scattering angle, and through analogy with simpler molecules, the first three transitions are tentatively assigned to an n → π* transition, a π - σ* (3 s) Rydberg transition and a π → π* transition. Thermal decomposition of chlorodifluoromethane, chloroform, dichloromethane and chloromethane under flash-vacuum pyrolysis conditions (900 - 1100 °C) was investigated by the {{technique of}} electron energy-loss spectroscopy, using the impact energy of 50 eV and a scattering angle of 10 °. The pyrolytic reaction follows a hydrogen-chloride α-elimination pathway. The difluoromethylene radical was produced from chlorodifluoromethane pyrolysis at 900 °C and identified by its X^ 1 A_ 1 → A^ 1 B_ 1 band at 5. 04 eV. Finally, a number of exploratory studies have been performed. The thermal decomposition of diketene was studied under flash vacuum pressures (1 - 10 mTorr) and temperatures ranging from 500 °C to 1000 °C. The complete decomposition of the diketene molecule into two ketene molecules was achieved at 900 °C. The pyrolysis of trifluoromethyl iodide molecule at 1000 °C produced an electron energy-loss spectrum with several iodine-atom, sharp peaks and only a small shoulder at 8. 37 eV as a possible trifluoromethyl radical feature. The electron energy-loss spectrum of trichlorobromomethane at 900 °C mainly showed features from bromine atom, chlorine molecule and tetrachloroethylene. Hexachloroacetone decomposed partially at 900 °C, but showed well-defined features from <b>chlorine,</b> carbon <b>monoxide</b> and tetrachloroethylene molecules. Bromodichloromethane molecule was investigated at 1000 °C and produced a congested, electron energy-loss spectrum with bromine-atom, hydrogen-bromide, hydrogen-chloride and tetrachloroethylene features. ...|$|R

30|$|Despite {{overwhelming}} evidence from both toxicological and medical research, even recently published papers often {{begin with the}} following statement: “Owing to its poor water solubility, one {{of the hallmarks of}} phosgene toxicity is an unpredictable asymptomatic latent phase before the development of noncardiogenic pulmonary edema”. Notably, the “latent” or, more appropriately phrased, clinically “occult” period of phosgene poisoning is the largely asymptomatic interval between exposure and the onset of edema by conventional methods. This definition is a fallacy since the incipient anatomic and pathophysiologic lung injury occurs with exposure and steadily progresses until sufficiently severe to become phenotypically detectable. Its occurrence follows a typical reciprocal inhaled concentration x time relationship. At exposure intensities within the range of 300 – 500  ppm × min, pulmonary edema occurs few hours post-exposure, followed by lethality ≈ 12 – 24  h later. At much higher exposure intensities, this period may becomes markedly shorter [35, 36]. Delayed mortality was also observed in experimental models of phosgene examined 80  years ago [24]; however, it was absent in more recent studies [37, 38]. Accounting {{for the fact that the}} more recent industrial production of phosgene is by catalytic reaction of the high-purity gases anhydrous <b>chlorine</b> and carbon <b>monoxide,</b> the presence of irritant impurities causing airway injury can be ruled out. The largest-scale human exposures to chlorine occurred during World War I, when the gas was used as a chemical weapon.

During previous campaigns, TELIS shared a balloon gondola with MIPAS-B and mini-DOAS. The primary scientific goal of these campaigns has been to monitor the time-dependent chemistry of chlorine and bromine, and to achieve the closure of chemical families inside the polar vortex.

The quality of the retrieval products is analyzed in a quantitative manner including: error characterization, internal comparisons of the two different channels, and external comparisons with coincident spaceborne observations. The errors due to the instrument parameters and pressure dominate in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere, while the errors at higher altitudes are mainly due to the spectroscopic parameters and the radiometric calibration.

The University of Bremen and the Forschungszentrum Karlsruhe will {{carry out the}} project jointly with support by the Universidad de los Andes in Mérida, Venezuela, for the tropical station. The University of Bremen {{is responsible for the}} maintenance and the operation of the high and mid-latitude stations. The high latitude station in Ny-Ålesund, Spitsbergen is equipped with three radiometers to measure ozone, water vapour and <b>chlorine</b> <b>monoxide.</b> At the mid-latitude station in Bremen, Germany, an ozone radiometer, also providing total columns of water vapour is operational since end of 2000 and presently in the validation phase. This latter instrument will be operated continuously during the time SCIAMACHY is in orbit. The Forschungszentrum Karlsruhe will install a well tested radiometer permitting to measure ozone, <b>chlorine</b> <b>monoxide,</b> nitrous oxide, nitric acid (HNO 3), and tropospheric water vapour columns at the high altitude equatorial site in Mérida, Venezuela. The University of Bremen will contribute a second frontend to observe stratospheric water vapour...|$|E
