Although the Obama inaugural events achieved an average U.S.television viewership of 37.8million across both broadcast networks and cable channels, viewership for the events was lower than the U.S.television viewership for the 1981 Reagan inaugural festivities, which averaged 41.8million across the ABC, <b>CBS</b> <b>and</b> <b>NBC</b> broadcast networks alone.|$|E
5|$|Despite its severe {{financial}} straits, by 1953, DuMont {{appeared to}} be {{on its way to}} establishing itself as the third national network. DuMont programs aired live on 16 stations, but it could count on only seven primary stations – its three owned-and-operated stations ("O"), plus WGN-TV in Chicago, KTTV (channel 11) in Los Angeles, KFEL-TV (channel 2, now KWGN-TV) in Denver and WTVN-TV (channel 6, now WSYX) in Columbus, Ohio. In contrast, ABC had a full complement of five O, augmented by nine primary affiliates. ABC also had a radio network (it was descended from NBC's Blue Network) from which to draw talent, affiliate loyalty and a profit stream to subsidize television operations. However, ABC had only 14 primary stations, while <b>CBS</b> <b>and</b> <b>NBC</b> had over 40 each. By 1951, ABC was badly overextended and on the verge of bankruptcy. That year, the company announced a merger with United Paramount Theaters (the former theater division of Paramount Pictures, which was spun off {{as a result of the}} United States v. Paramount Pictures, Inc. antitrust decision), but it was not until 1953 that the FCC approved the merger.|$|E
5|$|On September 6 Sporting News named McGary to its preseason first All-American team as {{the best}} overall player in the Big Ten Conference, ranking Robinson fifth overall and Irvin and Walton the second- and third-best conference {{newcomers}} respectively.

Sports Illustrated ranked Walton the ninth-best freshman overall and second-best in the Big Ten, behind Noah Vonleh. The Blue Ribbon College Basketball Yearbook named McGary a preseason second-team All-American. Lindy's Sports selected Robinson {{as the best}} NBA prospect in the Big Ten, the second-best small forward {{in the country and}} named him to the preseason All-Big Ten team with Aaron Craft, Keith Appling, Gary Harris and Adreian Payne. The magazine chose Stauskas and McGary for its second team, naming McGary as the nation's second-best power forward and Stuaskas as the nation's tenth-best shooting guard and the Big Ten's best shooter. Athlon Sports selected McGary for its preseason All-American second team, McGary for the preseason All-Big Ten first team and Robinson for the preseason All-Big Ten second team. <b>CBS</b> <b>and</b> <b>NBC</b> Sports selected McGary as a second-team All-American. Although McGary joined McDermott, Smart, Wiggins and Julius Randle on USA Todays preseason All-American first team in its Sports 2013–14 College Basketball Preview Magazine, the paper's sports staff later named him to their second team. Dick Vitale selected McGary and Aaron Craft for his All-Solid Gold preseason first team.|$|E

25|$|In 2014, {{production}} of the Thursday Night Football games {{was taken over by}} CBS Sports under a one-year deal. As part of the deal, CBS would carry nine Thursday night games (which were simulcast on NFL Network) and lend its primary broadcast team, consisting of Jim Nantz and Phil Simms, to cover the remaining Thursday telecasts airing exclusively on NFL Network. In addition, NFL Network extended the length of the Thursday telecasts to Week 16 of the season, and added a new Saturday doubleheader split between CBS and NFL Network. On January 18, 2015, CBS and NFL Network extended the same arrangement for a second season. On February 1, 2016, the NFL announced that <b>CBS</b> <b>and</b> <b>NBC</b> would split the broadcast television portion of the Thursday Night Football schedule for the 2016 and 2017 seasons, with each network broadcasting 5 games per year in simulcast with NFL Network.

40|$|Adult {{stem cells}} are finding {{increased}} therapeutic potential not least in tissue regeneration protocols. The cell sources being proposed for such protocols include embryonic, umbilical cord blood (<b>CB)</b> <b>and</b> adult bone marrow (BM). Although embryonic sources are controversial, <b>CB</b> <b>and</b> marrow are available immediately. The appropriate cells of use in these sources {{are considered to be}} extremely rare and a characterisation of the starting cell source is important for the development of adult stem cell protocols and ex vivo expansion. Umbilical <b>CB</b> <b>and</b> BM mononuclear cells were labelled for the antigens CD 34, CD 133, CD 117, CD 164, Thy- 1 or CD 38, and additional intracellular CD 34 antigen. Three dimensional flow-cytometric analyses were carried out together with dual laser confocal microscope analysis for antigen profile expression. Variable levels of immaturity were detected on <b>CB</b> <b>and</b> BM populations using internal and external CD 34 antigen. For <b>CB</b> <b>and</b> BM cells, internal CD 34 (intCD 34 +) could be detected on co-expressing CD 133 + cells before expression of external CD 34 antigen (extCD 34 +). CD 38 co-expression analysis also showed that a small but distinct group of cells expressing low CD 38 and no external CD 34 antigen could be detected. Additional phenotyping of these cells using CD 117, Thy- 1, CD 164 and CD 133 demonstrated variable primitive status detectable within the external CD 34 - population. Newly harvested primary <b>CB</b> <b>and</b> BM populations were shown to contain not only cellular populations of known standard sequential maturity but also populations of more extreme rarity. The presence of cells which lacked extracellular CD 34 antigen, in both <b>CB</b> <b>and</b> BM, but which possessed CD 133, has important implications for purification of human stem cells in clinical applications...|$|R
50|$|On April 7, 1983, Major League Baseball, ABC, <b>and</b> <b>NBC</b> {{agreed to}} {{terms of a}} six-year {{television}} package worth $1.2 billion.

25|$|Amid this {{instability}} in ownership, WLWI found the going rather difficult. It was also dogged by a weaker network affiliation; ABC {{would not be}} {{on an equal footing}} with <b>CBS</b> <b>and</b> <b>NBC</b> in the ratings until the 1970s. WLWI spent most of its first 17 years of operation languishing as a third place also-ran behind NBC affiliate WFBM-TV (channel 6, now ABC affiliate WRTV) and then-CBS affiliate WISH-TV (channel 8, now a CW affiliate). In some cases, it even fell to fourth place in the local ratings behind then-independent station WTTV.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, {{all three}} of the major {{television}} networks signed contracts to televise games, thus ensuring the combined league's stability. CBS agreed to broadcast all games where an NFC team was on the road, NBC agreed to broadcast all games where an AFC team was on the road, and ABC agreed to broadcast Monday Night Football, making the NFL the first league to have a regular series of national telecasts in prime time. The NFL would likely {{not have been able to}} retain both <b>CBS</b> <b>and</b> <b>NBC</b> had it not done the AFC-NFC setup.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, ABC {{completed}} its transition to color; the decade {{as a whole}} would mark {{a turning point for}} ABC, as it began to pass <b>CBS</b> <b>and</b> <b>NBC</b> in the ratings to become the first place network. It also began to use behavioral and demographic data to better determine what types of sponsors to sell advertising slots to and provide programming that would appeal towards certain audiences. ABC's gains in audience share were greatly helped by the fact that several smaller markets had grown large enough to allow full-time affiliations from all three networks.|$|E

40|$|The {{effect of}} intraduodenally {{administered}} cattle bile (<b>CB)</b> <b>and</b> Na-taurodeoxycholate (TDC) on basal pancreatic secretion and plasma levels of secretin, pancreatic polypeptide (PP), and gastrin were investigated on two separate days in 10 fasting volunteers. Doses of 2 - 6 g <b>CB</b> <b>and</b> 20 & 600 mg TDC were given intraduodenally at 65 -min intervals. Volume, bicarbonate, lipase, trypsin, amylase, and bilirubin were measured in 10 -min fractions of duodenal juice, and GI peptides determined by radioimmunoassay. <b>CB</b> <b>and</b> TDC enhanced significantly and dose-dependently volume, bicarbonate and enzyme secretion, and plasma secretin and PP levels. In contrast, plasma gastrin showed only a marginal increase. We {{conclude that the}} hydrokinetic effect of intraduodenal <b>CB</b> <b>and</b> TDC is at least partially mediated by secretin. Gastrin could be ruled out as a mediator of the ecbolic effect, whereas other GI peptides, primarily CCK, and/or neural mechanisms must be considered possible mediators.

25|$|However, {{before the}} 1950s, San Francisco was also {{considered}} a West Coast flagship {{market for the}} networks, {{with much of the}} <b>CBS</b> <b>and</b> <b>NBC</b> network's West Coast news programming originating from that city. This is seen the calls of CBS's KCBS (AM) being based in their original city of San Francisco instead of Los Angeles (the use of KCBS-TV in Los Angeles only dates back to 1984), while KNBR (which was subsequently sold to another party by NBC in 1987) was formerly known as KNBC before the network moved those calls to KRCA-TV in Los Angeles in 1962.|$|E
