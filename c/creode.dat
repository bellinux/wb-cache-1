5000|$|<b>Creode</b> or chreod is a neologistic {{portmanteau}} term {{coined by}} the English 20th century biologist C.H. Waddington {{to represent the}} developmental pathway followed by a cell as it grows to form part of a specialized organ. [...] Combining the Greek roots for [...] "necessary" [...] and [...] "path," [...] the term {{was inspired by the}} property of regulation. [...] When development is disturbed by external forces, the embryo attempts to regulate its growth and differentiation by returning to its normal developmental trajectory.|$|E
5000|$|Biological {{robustness}} or canalisation {{comes about}} when developmental pathways {{are shaped by}} evolution. Waddington introduced the epigenetic landscape, {{in which the state}} of an organism rolls [...] "downhill" [...] during development. In this metaphor, a canalised trait is illustrated as a valley (which he called a <b>creode)</b> enclosed by high ridges, safely guiding the phenotype to its [...] "fate". Waddington claimed that canals form in the epigenetic landscape during evolution, and that this heuristic is useful for understanding the unique qualities of biological robustness.|$|E
5000|$|While Waddington does {{assert that}} the process of {{development}} is genetically driven, he makes no attempt to explain how this works and even offers evidence to the contrary. [...] He observes, for instance, that genes ordinarily determine peripheral traits, such as eye color, rather than [...] "focal" [...] traits, such as the structure of the eye itself. Moreover, when genetic mutation influences basic structures, the result tends to be the complete transformation of a structure into another rather than piecemeal change, which Waddington illustrates with the developmental ball rolling out of one <b>creode</b> into another. [...] Thus his account gives the impression that genes influence development, perhaps altering the course of a region of cells, without determining the endpoints toward which the embryo develops.|$|E
5000|$|This {{interpretation}} is further reinforced by Waddington's {{discussion of the}} organization of the gene pool, where he points out that [...] "the epigenetic process occurring during the development of the organism might be so buffered or canalized that the optimum end-result is produced irrespective of the genes which the individual contains." [...] The more deeply <b>creodes</b> are carved into the epigenetic landscape, the weaker the influence of genes over development. He also argues that deep <b>creodes</b> will resist not only genetic but environmental pressures to change course. This phenomenon, which he calls [...] "stabilizing selection," [...] puts genes and environment on a par in secondary importance compared to the epigenetic system.|$|R
5000|$|Waddington {{refers to}} the network of <b>creodes</b> carved into the {{hillside}} as an [...] "epigenetic landscape," [...] meaning {{the formation of the}} body depends on not only its genetic makeup but the different ways genes are expressed in different regions of the embryo. [...] He expands his metaphor by describing the underside of the epigenetic landscape. Here we see that the [...] "landscape" [...] is really more like a giant sheet that would blow away except that a series of tension-bearing cables holds it down. The pegs that connect the cables to the ground are the genes. The cables themselves are the epigenetic factors that influence gene expression in various regions of the embryo. The depth and direction of the channels is thus determined by a combination of genetic makeup and the epigenetic feedback loops by which genes are regulated.|$|R
5000|$|Waddington {{used the}} term along with homeorhesis, which {{describes}} a system that returns to a steady trajectory, in contrast to homeostasis, which describes a system which returns to a steady state. Waddington explains development with the metaphor of a ball rolling down a hillside, where the hill's contours channel the ball in a particular direction. In {{the case of a}} pathway or <b>creode</b> which is deeply carved in the hillside, external disturbance is unlikely to prevent normal development. He notes that creodes tend to have steeper sides earlier in development, when external disturbance rarely suffices to alter the developmental trajectory. Small differences in placement atop the hill can lead to dramatically different results by the time the ball reaches the bottom. This represents the tendency of neighboring regions of the early embryo to develop into different organs with radically different structures. Since intermediate structures rarely exist between organs, each ball that rolls down the hill is [...] "canalised" [...] to a region distinct from other regions, just as an eye, for instance, is distinct from an ear.|$|E
40|$|Language as an {{identifiable}} cognitive behavior 'mist be studied {{in relation to}} identity and memory, all of whose structures undergo progressive changes as the child develops. The organization {{of the development of}} the organism depends upon relatively ordered structures of growth, following foreseeable pathways or creodes. The processes occurring within each <b>creode,</b> however, are susceptible to certain environmental modifications. Current research indicates that the acquisition of language parallels the development of identity and renders it meaningful [...] Research has shown that the style of reasoning used by a child is very much related to the language used and that a close relationship exists between the structure of a term and the developmental stages of seriation. cognitive operations never exist in isolation; the acquisition of one enhances or potentiates the acquisition of another. Research has shown that the development of the memory schema lies within the developmental confines of identity and language. It is only under the circumstances of the changed and changing schema that memory becomes not more accurate but more in concert with the other same-level cognitions and modalities of thinking. The observation of qualitative differences of behavior at different chronological levels establishes memory as possessing the structure(s) through which identity is assimilated and language accommodated. Memory, and its manifestation via increasingly accurate reproduction of the original stimulus, is an integrative and integrated factor in cognitive growth. (KM) 4...|$|E
