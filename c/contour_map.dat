5|$|A {{conservative}} {{force that}} acts on a closed system has an associated mechanical work that allows energy to convert only between kinetic or potential forms. This means {{that for a}} closed system, the net mechanical energy is conserved whenever a conservative force acts on the system. The force, therefore, is related directly to the difference in potential energy between two different locations in space, and can {{be considered to be}} an artifact of the potential field {{in the same way that}} the direction and amount of a flow of water can be considered to be an artifact of the <b>contour</b> <b>map</b> of the elevation of an area.|$|E

They analyzed the bio-mechanics of how stresses and strains would be distributed along the claws and into the limbs, using X-ray imaging to create a three-dimensional <b>contour</b> <b>map</b> of a forelimb claw from Velociraptor. For comparison, they analyzed the construction of a claw from a modern predatory bird, the eagle owl. They found that, based on the way that stress was conducted along the claw, they were ideal for climbing. The scientists found that the sharpened tip of the claw was a puncturing and gripping instrument, while the curved and expanded claw base helped transfer stress loads evenly.|$|E

40|$|<b>Contour</b> <b>mapping</b> is {{a crucial}} part of many {{wireless}} sensor network applications. Many efforts have been made to avoid collecting data from all the sensors in the network and producing maps at the sink, which is proven to be inefficient. The existing approaches (often aggregation based), however, suffer from heavy transmission traffic and incur large computational overheads on each sensor node. We propose Iso-Map, an energy-efficient protocol for <b>contour</b> <b>mapping,</b> which builds <b>contour</b> <b>maps</b> based solely on the reports collected from intelligently selected "isoline nodes" in wireless sensor networks. Iso-Map achieves high-quality <b>contour</b> <b>mapping</b> while significantly reducing the generated traffic from O(n > to O(root n >, where n is the total number of sensor nodes in the field. The pernode computation overhead is also restrained as a constant. We conduct comprehensive trace-driven simulations to verify this protocol, and demonstrate that Iso-Map outperforms the previous approaches {{in the sense that it}} produces <b>contour</b> <b>maps</b> of high fidelity with significantly reduced energy cost...|$|R

40|$|<b>Contour</b> <b>mapping</b> is an {{energy-efficient}} {{method for}} geographic correlated value monitoring in Wireless Sensor Networks(WSNs), it suppresses reporting nodes by selecting nodes {{that are on}} a contour line. A sensor network is often densely deployed in applications such as temperature or humidity monitoring.

In this paper, we propose a novel scheme called DABC (data aggregation based on Bezier curves) to implementing <b>contour</b> <b>mapping</b> in WSNs. In DABC algorithm, sensor nodes that play as sources to report to the sink are intelligently selected through method based on Bezier curve.

25|$|Barometric {{pressure}} and the pressure tendency (the change of pressure over time) {{have been used in}} weather forecasting since the late 19th century. When used in combination with wind observations, reasonably accurate short-term forecasts can be made. Simultaneous barometric readings from across a network of weather stations allow maps of air pressure to be produced, which were the first form of the modern weather map when created in the 19th century. Isobars, lines of equal pressure, when drawn on such a map, give a <b>contour</b> <b>map</b> showing areas of high and low pressure. Localized high atmospheric pressure acts as a barrier to approaching weather systems, diverting their course. Atmospheric lift caused by low-level wind convergence into the surface brings clouds and sometimes precipitation. The larger the change in pressure, especially if more than 3.5hPa (0.1 inHg), the greater the change in weather that can be expected. If the pressure drop is rapid, a low pressure system is approaching, and there is a greater chance of rain. Rapid pressure rises, such as {{in the wake of a}} cold front, are associated with improving weather conditions, such as clearing skies.|$|E
2500|$|Since {{multiple}} distinct gait parameters have {{a significant}} impact on the energetic cost of walking, each of these parameters have to be considered when examining the primary goal of metabolic cost optimization. [...] The visualization of such an optimization for walking speed, cadence, and step length can be expressed in the form of a <b>contour</b> <b>map,</b> in which parameter combinations that lie on the same contour line share the same cost of transport (cal/kg/m). [...] The green, red, and blue, dotted lines represent values where cadence, walking speed, and step length are constrained, respectively. [...] These lines can be formed by finding the tangent points that lines representative of several constant parameter values form with the constant COT contours. [...] For example, the optimal COT's for constrained walking speeds (red) can be found by drawing vertical lines and noting where they form a tangent with a contour, as seen with point B in the diagram. [...] A series of these intersections can then form the curve for optimal COT under constrained walking speed. [...] These constrained optimization values not only reflect the naturally selected preferred gait parameters that are observed by fixing a single parameter at different values, but also form part of a predictive map that allows for the identification of the cost of transport for a multivariate system.|$|E
60|$|I {{awoke to}} the sound of the wind {{whistling}} through the open lattice, and looking down on the ruffled blue waters of the moat I saw a great white swan at his morning toilet, his feathers dazzling in the sun.

Following the example of the swan, I plunged into the tin tub the orderly had placed beside my bed and went down to porridge in a glow.
