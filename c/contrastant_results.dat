Many different drugs have been used in order to control symptoms and different antineoplastic agents were experimentated to reduce the often large neoplastic lesions. Recently the description of the existence of estrogen receptors in carcinoid tumor tissue arose great enthusiasm on the possibility of using the antiestrogen tamoxifen as a direct antitumor agent. Few experiences appeared in the international literature and <b>contrastant</b> <b>results</b> were reported. In this paper we describe one case of long term treatment with tamoxifen for a metastatic carcinoid tumor. The patient experienced the regression of carcinoid syndrome symptoms with tamoxifen therapy. Unfortunately after one year symptoms reappeared in spite of tamoxifen therapy. We conclude that tamoxifen is at the moment the best therapy in patient affected by carcinoid tumor {{associated with}} carcinoid syndrome. Data on other drugs as the oral analogues of Somatostatin or Calcitonin need to be confirmed by additional studies...|$|E
