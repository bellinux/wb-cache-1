5|$|A cheap, {{cost-effective}} {{and practical}} alternative in poorer <b>countries</b> <b>is</b> visual inspection with acetic acid (VIA). Instituting and sustaining cytology-based programs {{in these regions}} can be difficult, due {{to the need for}} trained personnel, equipment and facilities and difficulties in follow-up. With VIA, results and treatment can be available on the same day. As a screening test, VIA is comparable to cervical cytology in accurately identifying precancerous lesions.|$|E
5|$|After the war {{the gun was}} {{supplied}} to many countries around the globe, including former Warsaw Pact allies, such as Poland. As of the early 2000s it remains in service in Afghanistan, Albania, China, Cuba, Hungary, Iraq, Mozambique, Syria, Vietnam and other countries. The gun was employed in the Arab-Israeli Conflict and also in some conflicts in former republics of Soviet Union. The long operational history of D-1 howitzers in the national armies of numerous <b>countries</b> <b>is</b> an additional testimony to its qualities.|$|E
5|$|Although not as {{significant}} as deforestation and hunting, some lemurs, such as crowned lemurs and other species that have successfully been kept in captivity, are occasionally kept as exotic pets by Malagasy people. Bamboo lemurs are also kept as pets, although they only survive {{for up to two}} months. Live capture for the exotic pet trade in wealthier <b>countries</b> <b>is</b> not normally considered a threat due to strict regulations controlling their export.|$|E

5|$|Because R. norvegicus {{and related}} species {{are seen as}} pests, their {{intentional}} import into foreign <b>countries</b> <b>is</b> often regulated. For example, the importation of foreign rodents is prohibited in Australia, and so various coat types, colors, and varieties have been bred separately from foreign lines, or are just not obtainable within that country (for example, hairless and dumbo-eared fancy rats do not exist in Australia). In other areas, like the Canadian province of Alberta, which is considered rat-free, the ownership of domestic fancy rats outside of schools, laboratories, and zoos is illegal.|$|E
5|$|Common {{onions are}} {{normally}} available in three colour varieties. Yellow or brown onions (called red in some European countries), are full-flavoured {{and are the}} onions of choice for everyday use. Yellow onions turn a rich, dark brown when caramelised and give French onion soup its sweet flavour. The red onion (called purple in some European <b>countries)</b> <b>is</b> {{a good choice for}} fresh use when its colour livens up the dish; it is also used in grilling. White onions are the traditional onions used in classic Mexican cuisine; they have a golden colour when cooked and a particularly sweet flavour when sautéed.|$|E

These benefits are achieved by {{reducing the number of}} unplanned pregnancies that subsequently result in unsafe abortions and by preventing pregnancies in those at high risk.|$|E

5|$|Daylight saving time (abbreviated DST), {{commonly}} referred to as daylight savings time in speech, and known as summer time in some <b>countries,</b> <b>is</b> the practice of advancing clocks during summer months so that evening daylight lasts longer, while sacrificing normal sunrise times.

5|$|During the Great Turkish War (1683–1698), Slavonia was regained but western Bosnia, {{which had}} been part of Croatia before the Ottoman conquest, {{remained}} outside Croatian control. The present-day border between the two <b>countries</b> <b>is</b> a remnant of this outcome. Dalmatia, {{the southern part of the}} border, was similarly defined by the Fifth and the Seventh Ottoman–Venetian Wars.|$|E
5|$|Instead of {{destroying}} confiscated ivory, a government {{could choose to}} sell it, and put the funds to use in one of several ways. Several of the countries involved in the ivory trade, especially those {{on the supply side}} in Africa, are also some of the nations which struggle the most with poverty. Destroying ivory in those <b>countries</b> <b>is</b> thus often a controversial decision for internal stakeholders as well as external commentators, as the funds gained by selling the material could be used {{to improve the quality of}} life for human citizens.|$|E

5|$|International {{regulations}} for the maritime industry are promulgated by {{agencies of the}} United Nations, particularly the International Maritime Organization and International Labour Organization.
