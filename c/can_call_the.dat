5|$|In November 1994, Walford {{resident}} Robbie Jackson (Dean Gaffney) {{takes in}} a dog he assumes to be a stray, naming him Wellard. The dog's owner, Mr Hammond, locates him and demands him back, but Wellard later returns to Albert Square {{of his own}} accord. Robbie realises he has been mistreated and has run away. Mr Hammond admits to neglecting Wellard, and allows Robbie to keep him. Wellard fathers puppies with Grant Mitchell (Ross Kemp); however, the puppies are stillborn. When Robbie begins {{a relationship with a}} woman allergic to dogs, she gives him the ultimatum of choosing between her and Wellard: Robbie chooses Wellard. Several years later, when Robbie is due to leave Walford to live in India, Wellard is run over, delaying Robbie's departure. He is cared for by Robbie's sister Sonia (Natalie Cassidy), who gives him to her friend Gus (Mohammed George) after Robbie's departure. When Gus is involved in a minibus crash, Wellard is able to save his owner by leading him to a spot from where he <b>can</b> <b>call</b> <b>the</b> emergency services.|$|E

She {{attempts}} to tell Ryan that he is Lily's father, but is interrupted by Pat, who thinks Stacey is trying to seduce him and slaps her. Phil smashes through the door using a crowbar that was left in the room. He starts taking cash and drinking alcohol, and interrupts Peggy before she <b>can</b> <b>call</b> <b>the</b> police about Stacey. They argue, with Phil accusing Peggy of loving the pub more than she loves him and throwing a match to the alcohol-soaked floor to start a fire. It spreads quickly, causing an explosion. The customers flee the pub, Syed Masood (Marc Elliott) is knocked to the ground and trampled in the process but is rescued by his father Masood Ahmed (Nitin Ganatra) and brother Tamwar (Himesh Patel).|$|E
5|$|Mitzeee pleads {{guilty to}} {{stabbing}} Mercedes, as she doesn't {{remember what happened}} since Mercedes had knocked her unconscious. As a result, Riley and Mitzeee's relationship {{comes to an end}} and Riley and Mercedes get back together. Mitzeee is sentenced to seven years in prison for her actions, however when she notices Mercedes smiling at her as she is being sentenced, she realises her own innocence. Myra discovers that Mercedes had framed Mitzeee although doesn't tell anyone. Mitzeee goes insane in prison knowing that she is innocent and is transferred to a psychiatric unit. Mitzeee escapes from the psychiatric hospital where she confronts Mercedes and threatens her with a knife although leaves before Mercedes <b>can</b> <b>call</b> <b>the</b> police. Carl returns and attempts to persuade Riley not to marry Mercedes. Mercedes hears a conversation between Riley and Carl in which Riley admits that he does not love Mercedes and that he recently had sex with Mitzeee. Angered, Mercedes kidnaps Bobby in an attempt to punish Riley and lies to the police that Mitzeee has kidnapped him. Mercedes pays Phoebe Jackson (Mandip Gill) {{to be part of the}} scam and look after Bobby in a secret flat. Mercedes sends a letter to Riley asking for £500,000 ransom money in exchange for Bobby. When dropping off the ransom money, Riley sees Mercedes and realises that she is behind the kidnap. Phoebe exposes Mercedes and tells Riley the truth. Mercedes takes Bobby to the rooftop of a building, threatening to throw herself and Bobby off. Mercedes eventually gives Bobby to Riley and she agrees to leave with the ransom money. They return to the McQueen household where Mercedes' involvement in the kidnap is revealed by Phoebe. Myra then exposes Mercedes for having stabbed herself and framed Mitzeee, and calls the police. Moments later, Riley is shot dead by Simon Walker (Neil Newbon). In prison, Mercedes shows further signs of mental illness, denying to herself that Riley has died. Mercedes is later taken to a psychiatric hospital. Doctor Browning pleads innocent in his trial. When Myra visits Mercedes, Mercedes appears distressed and asks Myra to help her. Myra contacts lawyer Jim McGinn (Dan Tetsell). At the trial, Jim suggests Riley was abusive towards Mercedes and stabbed her and forced her to frame Mitzeee. He also suggests that Lynsey knew of this so Riley killed her. Mercedes backs up the claims and tells the courtroom that Riley had threatened to kill her so she kidnapped Bobby to protect him from Riley. The jury give a not guilty verdict for both charges of perverting the course of justice and Mercedes is released. Myra tells Mercedes she can not come home as she needs to learn her lesson and instead tells her to move into Jacqui's old flat that has recently been flooded.|$|E

In the scene where Brian spies on Meg for the Teen People article, Stewie quickly warns Brian that [...] "not all dogs go to heaven", cutting to a quick scene with the Disney character Goofy from the Mickey Mouse shorts in hell with Satan claiming Goofy was part of the plotting of 9/11. Goofy justified his part in the attacks by pointing out the United States' support for Israel. Goofy is then thrown to the pit of fire, using his famous laugh. In one scene Stewie refers to Meg as [...] "one of those crazy chicks, who hooks up with an even crazier guy," [...] with a photograph of Jenny McCarthy and Jim Carrey then being shown. The song [...] "The Ballad of Billy the Kid" [...] by singer and performer Billy Joel is used in depicting Peter's flashbacks about being a cowboy. Meg mentions meeting Wesley Snipes in the episode, and mentions his movie Passenger 57. The ending of the episode includes {{a reference to}} The Simpsons, in which Meg makes an unfunny joke, with Peter announcing he is not amused, responding by sarcastically stating [...] "Always end on a strong joke." [...] The start of the closing credits that follow the statement is styled to match those used in The Simpsons credits.|$|E

500|$|The novel's first 100 pages {{deal with}} the bridge's {{construction}} and the remaining 200 revolve around the Austro-Hungarian period. Andrić himself characterized The Bridge on the Drina as a chronicle rather than a novel. In the introduction to his English-language translation, Edwards also declined to classify it as a novel, for [...] "its scope is too vast, its characters too numerous, its period of action too long." [...] Literary scholar Annabel Patterson writes: [...] "There is no hero or heroine to hold it together, nor even a family or dynasty. In place of these there is the bridge, whose birth we attend, whose stability we come to count on." [...] Patterson hesitates to characterize The Bridge on the Drina as a historical novel {{because most of the}} events described in it actually occurred as opposed to having been fictionalized. She notes that other scholars have classified it as a [...] "non-fiction novel", a term she considers superfluous. [...] "If we wish for simplicity," [...] she writes, [...] "we <b>can</b> <b>call</b> <b>The</b> Bridge on the Drina a novel to distinguish it from Andrić's collections of short stories. But if we wish for precision, The Bridge on the Drina can best be classified as {{a collection of short stories}} of peasant life held together by a bridge." [...] The book deviates from other texts that have been described as chronicles in that the narrator observes events itinerantly and retrospectively. The style of storytelling Andrić employs is often likened to a transcendent historical monologue. Literary scholar Guido Snel believes that such a stylistic interpretation neglects the novel's dialogic properties and its ability to act as a back-and-forth between the narrator and reader, drawing a connection between the past described in the novel and the reader's present. This has caused Serb scholars to uphold Andrić's narrative authority, Snel writes, and Muslim scholars to challenge and reject it.|$|E

2500|$|The theory {{underlying}} Interlingua posits {{an international}} vocabulary, {{a large number}} of words and affixes that are present {{in a wide range of}} languages. This already existing international vocabulary was shaped by social forces, science and technology, to [...] "all corners of the world". The goal of the International Auxiliary Language Association was to accept into Interlingua every widely international word in whatever languages it occurred. They conducted studies to identify [...] "the most generally international vocabulary possible", while still maintaining the unity of the language. This scientific approach of generating a language from selected source languages (called control languages) resulted in a vocabulary and grammar that we <b>can</b> <b>call</b> <b>the</b> highest common factor of each major European language.|$|E
2500|$|Although {{they began}} their career as [...] "a group of art school, experimental, post punk rockers," [...] the band's quick rise to stardom, {{polished}} good looks, and {{embrace of the}} teen press, almost guaranteed disfavour from music critics. During the 1980s, Duran Duran were considered the quintessential manufactured, throw-away pop group. However, according to the Sunday Herald, [...] "To describe them, as some have, as the first boy band, misrepresents their appeal. Their weapons were never just their looks, but self-penned songs." [...] As Moby said of the band in his website diary in 2003: [...] "...they were cursed by what we <b>can</b> <b>call</b> <b>the</b> 'Bee Gees' curse, which is: 'write amazing songs, sell tons of records, and consequently incur the wrath or disinterest of the rock obsessed critical establishment.'"

Elinor suspects Mary Gerrard as the topic of the anonymous letter, the lodgekeeper's daughter, whom their aunt likes and supports. Neither guesses who wrote the letter, which is burned. They visit their aunt at Hunterbury. Roddy sees Mary Gerrard {{for the first time in}} a decade. Mrs Welman is partially paralyzed after a stroke and dislikes living that way. She tells both her physician Peter Lord and her niece how much she dislikes living without full health, wishing the doctor might end her pain, which he refuses to do. Roddy falls in love with Mary; this provokes Elinor to end their engagement. After a second stroke, Mrs Welman asks Elinor to make provision for Mary. Elinor assumes there is a will her aunt wants modified. Mrs Welman dies before Elinor <b>can</b> <b>call</b> <b>the</b> attorney. There is no will.
