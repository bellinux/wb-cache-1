500|$|Howe's {{failure to}} press the attack {{and the reasons for}} it have been disputed. He may have wished to avoid the {{casualties}} that his army suffered when attacking the continentals under similar circumstances at the Battle of Bunker Hill. He may also have been giving Washington an opportunity to conclude that his position was hopeless and surrender, in the European gentleman-officer tradition. Howe told Parliament in 1779 that his essential duty was to avoid excessive British casualties for insufficient purpose, and capturing Brooklyn Heights would likely not have meant capturing the entire American army. [...] "The loss of 1,000, or perhaps 1,500 British troops, in carrying those lines, would have been but ill repaid by double that number of the enemy, <b>could</b> <b>it</b> <b>have</b> been supposed they would have suffered in that proportion." ...|$|E

[...] While she {{appreciated}} the [...] "realism and authenticity that Grey's is known for", she found the episode was [...] "almost too much" [...] as it was [...] "extremely gory and difficult to watch, initially because of the grisly wounds" [...] but later because of the [...] "heavy and emotional things that transpired". She thought Pompeo gave one of her best performances when her character learned that her sister was dead. Digital Spy Ben Lee found Leigh's and Dane's performances [...] "phenomenal" [...] and added that he had probably never seen a better performance from Dane. He described the moment the two actors shared as [...] "truly poignant". To him, Lexie's death felt like a finale, which was thus too early. As for {{what was happening in}} Seattle Grace, he thought it was [...] "a bit pointless" [...] and [...] "uninteresting" [...] except Altman's departure, which he deemed [...] "the most significant moment at the hospital". Entertainment Weekly Tanner Stransky commented of Lexie's death: [...] "It was an intense death. I mean, how awful was it to watch one of Grey’s longest-running characters pass away so quickly -- and rather unceremoniously? I get that Ms. Rhimes had to do what she had to do -- and every show needs to be shaken up once in a while -- but I don't love that Lexie was the one to die. <b>Could</b> <b>it</b> <b>have</b> been someone less important somehow? I guess it would have been too obvious to do Kepner. And you probably just don't kill off a hottie like Mark Sloan, right?" [...] Stransky also complained about Robbins' screams {{at the beginning of the}} episode, but enjoyed Bailey's story.|$|E

2500|$|The Irish Times {{stated that}} [...] "it is an {{unprecedented}} development that {{the mainstream media}} have been prevented from publishing privileged remarks in the Dáil due {{to the threat of}} legal action". However it also added that Deputy Murphy's Dáil speech was still available on the Oireachtas website, and that the website Broadsheet.ie had ignored a request by solicitors to remove a copy of her speech. Broadsheet.ie rejected the request by referring to Article 15.12 of the Irish Constitution In response, Denis O’Brien’s legal representative said the High Court ruling “covers what could be reported about what was said in the Dáil by Catherine Murphy” and again put us ‘on notice’. Unfortunately, the judge in the case never revealed the terms of the injunction. In a statement Catherine Murphy said: “I am a public representative. Information came to me, from a number of reliable sources, that is, without doubt, in the public interest. I have a duty to put that information into the public domain and I fully intend to fulfill my democratic mandate.”}} - this states [...] "All official reports and publications of the Oireachtas or of either House thereof and utterances made in either House wherever published shall be privileged."

In the High Court the following Tuesday (June 2, 2015), Mr Justice Donald Binchy stated that it was [...] "never intended nor <b>could</b> <b>it</b> <b>have</b> been intended that any order of this court would impact upon entitlements of deputies to speak as they see fit or the entitlement of the media to report on those utterances", but added that it was [...] "entirely understandable" [...] that RTÉ had sought court clarification on this.|$|E
