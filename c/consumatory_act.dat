The entire sequence of feeding behaviour in shrimps from appetitive behavioural pattern to the <b>consumatory</b> <b>act</b> of feeding can be released by chemical stimuli alone. The chemotactic indices, Db and Rb, developed were used to classify the feeding stimuli as attractant and repellent based on their chemotactic property. Analysis of extracts of natural food materials for both species showed that they are attractive to !. indicus and. dobsoni, whereas the squid ink acted as a feeding repellent for shrimps. The feeding response increased with increase in extract concentration and decreased with squid ink concentrations. The major attractant and stimulant substances present in the extracts were free amino acids with 78. 2...|$|E
