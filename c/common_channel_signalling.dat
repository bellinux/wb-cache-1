50|$|The {{telephone}} switching in the ISCs was then typically crossbar or electronic controlled cross-points such as reed relays. The transmission media {{was likely to}} be satellite or lengthy terrestrial submarine cable channels. In some cases these were advantaged or multiplied with TASI (Time-Assignment Speech Interpolation) or DCME (Digital Circuit Multiplication Equipment). These transmission methods were not suited to Line or Inter-Register signalling. Taking the signalling function away from the traffic channel could cut costs, and would later lead to <b>Common</b> <b>Channel</b> <b>Signalling.</b> There would be no need for filtering signalling away from speech, and the duty cycle of the costly trunk for each revenue earning call would be better. Signalling time in call set up and clear down would be significantly shorter than with C4 and C5. With telephone signalling not transmitted over the line, the opportunities for fraud were reduced.|$|E

This thesis investigates in detail the communication service Universal Personal Telecommunication (UPT). UPT serves as a first step for realising universal, personal mobility for its users. Based upon this, an enhanced UPT service, called UPT+, is described and a prototype is developed. The prototype is based upon the architecture of Intelligent Networks and <b>Common</b> <b>Channel</b> <b>Signalling</b> System No. 7 (CCSS-# 7). It is formally specified using SDL. The prototype is implemented in C++ by means of two different code generators. Performance of both implementations is evaluated by extensive measurements. Suitable procedures for measurement and statistical evaluation of processing times are developed. Sheppard's correction is applied in evaluating measured data. Robust estimators are used in evaluating error bounds on the variances of the measured processing times. It is shown that a pure object-oriented implementation is working a little bit more slowly in most of the cases as compared to a conventional procedural implementation. The measured values are used in an existing analytical modelling of the network of Deutsche Telekom AG. It is shown that former theses severely underestimated the influence of the variance due to consideration of only a few different classes of processing times...|$|E

Thus {{the design of the}} signalling system is a fundamental issue for the creation of the future Broadband ISDN out of ATM switching technology. Today 2 ̆ 7 s telecommunication networks use <b>common</b> <b>channel</b> <b>signalling</b> networks (standardised in SS 7) which are often separate from the bearer or transport network. With an ATM based Broadband ISDN (B-ISDN), it is anticipated that both signalHng and user traffic will share the underlying ATM layer. An SS 7 2 ̆ 2 Message Transfer Part 2 ̆ 2 (MTP) provides reliable connectionless signalling message transport. However due to differences between SS 7 links and ATM signalling links (i. e.

This thesis is concerned with the design and engineering of the B-ISDN MTP The need for an ATM signalling link error monitor is identified as a key requirement. To design such an error monitor, the delay performance of ATM signalling links during errored periods must be determined. This requires a model for the delay performance of the Service Specific Connection Oriented Protocol (SSCOP), the link level protocol to be used on ATM signalling links. The thesis presents an SSCOP delay model, which also gives general results for mean Selective Repeat transmitter delay and the mean (and distribution) of Selective Repeat receiver delay...|$|E
