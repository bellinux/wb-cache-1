5000|$|The rigid buoyant boat (RBB) is a {{light-weight}} {{but high}} performance and high capacity boat. Based {{on the concept}} of a Rigid-hulled inflatable boat (RHIB), it has a tube/sponson manufactured from a solid material such as moulded polyethylene or aluminium and therefore being much more robust than the fabrics commonly used. Boats with foam filled collars such as the secure all-around flotation equipped (SAFE) boats employed by the US Coast Guard can also be classified as Rigid Buoyant Boats rather than [...] "true" [...] RHIBs as the collar is solid foam rather than inflated. The handling tends to be very similar to a RHIB; likewise they will remain afloat (buoyant) even if completely flooded. Aluminium RBBs tend to be bespoke (custom-made to specification) or low-volume products whilst the tooling cost of rotomolded polyethylene boats tends to require these to be higher volume products. At least three manufacturers are producing rotomolded boats of this type. One supplier has demonstrated the robustness of the boats by dropping one from a crane onto a <b>concrete</b> <b>car</b> park. The U.S. Navy’s small unit riverine craft and the Coast Guard’s Defender class 25 ft boats are examples of RBBs. Some boat builders make RBB's as workboat from HDPE sheets welded together. Similar deep V-hull can be made for good seakeeping. If buoyancy chambers are filled the hull becomes truly unsinkable and extremely indestructible making the RBB very suitable for rough conditions. The RBB serie of Tideman Boats is a good example.|$|E

Thus, this paper aims to investigate the effect of using car wash wastewater on concrete properties in terms of mechanical properties.

In this research, the compressive strength, modulus of elasticity and tensile strength were studied. The percentages of wastewater replaced in the concrete mix ranged from 0 % up to 40 %. In addition, the results also suggest that the concrete with 20 % car wash wastewater achieved the highest compressive strength and modulus of elasticity compared to other compositions of wastewater. Moreover, the results also recommended that <b>concrete</b> mixed with <b>car</b> wash wastewater has better compressive strength compared to conventional concrete...|$|R

40|$|Suspended solids {{from urban}} {{impervious}} surfaces (SSUIS) is a spreadsheet-based model that predicts the mass loading of suspended solids (SS) in stormwater runoff generated from impervious urban surfaces. The model {{is intended to}} be a research tool and incorporates several particle accumulation and washoff processes. Development of SSUIS is based on interpretation of storm event data obtained from a galvanised iron roof, a <b>concrete</b> <b>car</b> park and a bitumen road located in Toowoomba, Australia. SSUIS is a source area model that tracks the particle mass balance on the impervious surface and within its lateral drain to a point of discharge. Particles are separated into two groups: free and detained, depending on the rainfall energy required for surface washoff. Calibration and verification of SSUIS against the Toowoomba SS data yielded R 2 values ranging from 0. 60 to 0. 98. Parameter sensitivity analysis and an example of how SSUIS can be applied to predict the treatment efficiency of a grass swale are also provided. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{goal of this}} diploma {{thesis is}} {{analysis}} impacts of business cycle on automotive industry in the Czech Republic in 2006 - 2011 with exclusive focusing on passenger cars. Impacts of business cycle on automotive industry in the Czech Republic are researched on domestic demand development for new passenger cars and on production, domestic sales and export of the three biggest czech automobile producers. Impacts of business cycle on domestic demand for new passenger cars are analyzed with helping numbers of first registrations in the <b>concrete</b> <b>car</b> segments. Development of czech demand for new cars and automotive production in 2006 - 2011 is compared to demand and passenger cars production development in Germany, Japan and in the USA. The analysis shows that czech demand for new cars was influenced by economic situation in the Czech Republic in 2006 - 2011. Influence of czech business cycle on automotive production in the Czech Republic was much smaller than influence of business cycle on czech demand for new passenger cars in 2006 - 2011. This fact is due to significant pro-export orientation of czech automotive production...|$|E
40|$|The methodologies {{that are}} used for {{analysing}} the fire behaviour of a structure that is subjected to a uniform thermal situation cannot be applied when the fire is localised. The concept of "zoning" can be applied: the structure is divided into several zones in which the situation is approximated as uniform. It is shown here that this division can lead to spurious forces in the structure. The structural code of the first author has been adapted {{in order to accommodate}} a continuous spatial variation of the fire environment. A series of uncoupled 2 D thermal analyses is performed {{along the length of the}} beam finite elements and a series of ID thermal analyses is performed across the thickness of the shell finite elements.

40|$|Up to {{now there}} seems to be no {{software}} package covering all aspects of designing mechatronic systems for active noise and vibration control: on the one hand coupled FE models of structure, aero acoustics, or piezo actuators, and on the other hand DAE's describing electronic components or methods for controller design and parametric optimization. Therefore, we have developed a toolbox which enables engineers to transfer and reduce automatically linear multi-field ANSYS® models into parametric Matlab® state space models. Note that the considered FE models are, in general, characterized by large non-symmetric and singular matrices due to fluid-structure coupling or neglecting piezo inductance. Hence, neither the built in model reduction of ANSYS® can be applied, which is restricted to symmetric systems with proportional damping, nor the one of Matlab®, which requires small full storage systems. Therefore, we implemented a hybrid reduction scheme combining modal reduction for singular non-symmetric systems and moment matching of the smooth remainder. The other focus of the article will be on parametric model reduction. Fitting models to measurements or optimizing designs requires parameterized models allowing fast evaluation. However, all time savings are lost, if another reduction has to be started for each set of new parameters. Common approaches rely on expansions of the full system matrices with respect to the parameters. However, this requires FE-meshes to be smoothly deformable into each other, which is a hard restriction for more realistic geometries. Therefore, we follow another approach: models are reduced independently to systems with standardized structure and size and interpolated only on this level. Relevance and challenges of finding system realizations suitable for interpolation are highlighted. Results are illustrated by applying the toolbox to some benchmark models including the LMS <b>concrete</b> <b>car.</b> Work is related to the Marie Curie RTN Smart Structures...|$|E
