The values of these parameters tell us the quantity of the product being deteriorated in the logistic chain {{and the extent to}} which the deterioration can be alleviated. Econometric estimation thus presents us with the quantity effects of preservation procedures, whereas the financial effects can be derived using the proper price categories in the calculation of the net present value or the annuity stream.

25|$|The cost of food {{irradiation}} {{is influenced by}} dose requirements, the food's tolerance of radiation, handling conditions, i.e., packaging and stacking requirements, construction costs, financing arrangements, and other variables particular to the situation. Irradiation is a capital-intensive technology requiring a substantial initial investment, ranging from $1million to $5million. In the case of large research or contract irradiation facilities, major capital costs include a radiation source, hardware (irradiator, totes and conveyors, control systems, and other auxiliary equipment), land (1 to 1.5acres), radiation shield, and warehouse. Operating costs include salaries (for fixed and variable labor), utilities, maintenance, taxes/insurance, cobalt-60 replenishment, general utilities, and miscellaneous operating costs.

40|$|Outsourcing in the <b>cold</b> supply <b>chain</b> {{can assist}} the fresh fruit {{industry}} to attain competitive advantage through {{its role in}} cost reductions and customer service enhancement. The South African fruit industry depends mainly on export markets to earn revenue. It should thus be reckon that the South African fresh fruit travel long distances to reach these markets as South Africa is remotely situated from its major markets. However, the products {{have to be in}} good quality on arrival, and also be on time. The challenge therefore is for the fresh fruit industry to ensure that the <b>cold</b> supply <b>chain</b> is maintained through to international destinations. The primary objective of the dissertation is to perform an analysis of the <b>cold</b> supply <b>chain</b> of the South African avocado for export – ‘charter the movement of the South African avocado from production areas to international markets, paying special attention to the outsourcing possibilities in the cold supply chain’. In order to fulfill this purpose, the study covers the following main aspects: • Developments in the fruit industry focusing specifically on the avocado fresh fruit industry. • Detailed analysis of the <b>cold</b> supply <b>chain</b> and costs associated with operating and managing the chain. • Outsourcing as a strategy for achieving the <b>cold</b> supply <b>chain</b> competitive advantage: assisting the avocado industry to compete effectively with other supplying countries. The dissertation has outlined a number of strategies relevant to deal with the challenges of <b>cold</b> supply <b>chain,</b> such strategies concern themselves with delivering the right product at the right time to the right customer at the right condition and at the right price. It is evident from the discussions in the study that the South African avocado supply chain is long, complex and involves interaction of various processes and role-players. The post-harvest <b>cold</b> supply <b>chain</b> processes involves temperature controlled storage and transportation. Every link in the supply chain must be analysed to identify weaknesses, as there should be no breakage in the chain so that quality of fruit is not compromised and profitability is achieved. Currently storage and transportation are outsourced to a number of service providers. As far as the chain is concerned there are minimal problems regarding temperature management in the chain. Few avocado fruits have in the past failed PPECB quality tests for export. The main challenge (amongst others) that the avocado chain is facing is effective information sharing to ensure a coordinated and well-aligned supply chain that will play a role in reducing costs and enhancing customer service. Lack of, for example accurate crop harvest estimate information and real-time communication and information sharing creates problems for the supply chain to function as a single entity with shared objectives. Based on the above, a number of conclusions about, and recommendations for, outsourcing in the <b>cold</b> supply <b>chain</b> of South African avocado for export are made, a summary of which is provided by the following statements: • A reliable relationship is important for both producers and service providers • Joint responsibility: farmers should play their part in the <b>cold</b> supply <b>chain</b> management • Ensuring <b>cold</b> supply <b>chain</b> best practices • Creation of supply chain vision • Ensuring of supply chain visibility • Adoption of total cost approach • Integrating and coordinating the supply chain Charting the movement of the South African avocados from production areas to international markets requires that short, medium and long-term decisions about outsourcing be thoroughly made.

25|$|An {{independent}} evaluation of obstacles to polio eradication {{requested by the}} WHO and conducted in 2009 considered the major obstacles in detail by country. In Afghanistan and Pakistan, they concluded that the most significant barrier was insecurity; but that managing human resources, political pressures, the movement of large populations between and within both countries, inadequately resourced health facilities, also posed problems, as well as technical issues with the vaccine. In India, the major challenge {{appeared to be the}} high efficiency of transmission within the populations of Bihar and Uttar Pradesh states, set against the low (~80% after three doses against type 1) seroconversion response seen from the vaccine. In Nigeria, meanwhile, the most critical barriers identified were management issues, in particular the highly variable importance ascribed to polio by different authorities at the local government level, although funding issues, community perceptions of vaccine safety, inadequate mobilisation of community groups, and issues with the <b>cold</b> <b>chain</b> also played a role. Finally, in those countries where international spread from endemic countries had resulted in transmission becoming re-established—namely Angola, Chad, and South Sudan, the key issues identified were underdeveloped health systems and low routine vaccine coverage, although low resources committed to Angola and South Sudan for the purpose of curtailing the spread of polio and climatic factors were also identified as playing a role.|$|E

40|$|The {{research}} {{conducted in the}} European PASTEUR project focussed on perishables monitoring through smart tracking of lifetime and quality. The aim {{was to develop a}} wireless sensor platform to monitor the environmental conditions of perishable goods in the supply chain between producer and consumer. The sensor platform is based on an intelligent RFID package in which multiple sensor technologies are incorporated. By adding such devices to packaging solutions (crates, containers, boxes, etc.) one can guarantee a product's quality more effectively throughout the whole logistic chain. This project focussed on the low-end (e. g., fruit, vegetables) <b>cold</b> supply <b>chain</b> (cooled transport of goods), which eventually enables item management in the near future. Added intelligence comes from the addition of smart models that analyse the information stream from the sensors. By collecting and studying these data, optimization of logistic flows can be achieved resulting in reduction of food losses and thus preserve the environment. Three types of models are included to help evaluating the logistic <b>cold</b> <b>chains.</b> Statistical control models are implemented to check whether the logistic conditions stay within predefined bounds. Keeping quality models are implemented to provide dynamic information on 'best before dates'. Finally, detailed quality change models are implemented to evaluate the impact of the logistic conditions on specific quality attributes in more details. Together, the three types of models provide instruments for streamlining the logistic activities throughout the <b>cold</b> handling <b>chain</b> increasing efficiency and minimizing losses of e. g., fresh fruits and vegetables. </p...|$|R

2500|$|Vaccine {{produced}} by Copeman's method {{was the only}} type issued free to public vaccinators by the English Government Vaccine Establishment from 1899. At {{the same time the}} 1898 Vaccination Act banned arm-to-arm vaccination, thus preventing transmission of syphilis by this vaccine. However, private practitioners had to purchase vaccine from commercial producers. Although proper use of glycerine reduced bacterial contamination considerably the crude starting material, scraped from the skin of infected calves, was always heavily contaminated and no vaccine was totally free from bacteria. A survey of vaccines in 1900 found wide variations in bacterial contamination. Vaccine issued by the Government Vaccine Establishment contained 5,000 bacteria per gram, while commercial vaccines contained up to 100,000 per gram. The level of bacterial contamination remained unregulated until the Therapeutic Substances Act, 1925 set an upper limit of 5,000 per gram, and rejected any batch of vaccine found to contain the causative organisms of erysipelas or wound infections. Unfortunately [...] glycerolated vaccine soon lost its potency at ambient temperatures which restricted its use in tropical climates. However, it remained in use into the 1970s where a satisfactory <b>cold</b> <b>chain</b> was available. Animals continued to be widely used by vaccine producers during the Smallpox Eradication Campaign. A WHO survey of 59 producers, some of whom used more than one source of vaccine, found that 39 used calves, 12 [...] used sheep and 6 used water buffalo, whilst only 3 made vaccine in cell culture and 3 in embryonated hens' eggs. English vaccine was occasionally made in sheep during World War I but from 1946 only sheep were used.|$|E

50|$|India {{is one of}} {{the largest}} {{producers}} of agricultural products and one of the global leaders in the pharmaceutical sector. Yet, it is known to have a fledgling cold-chain, which results in supply chain losses of food and other resources. These losses have been stated to be as high as USD 8 to 15 billion per annum from the agriculture sector alone. To address this concern, the government had earlier constituted a National Task Force on Cold-chain in 2008. This task force was discharged in 2010 on completing its mandate and in its report recommended that a dedicated institute be established to promote and coordinate various cold-chain initiatives undertaken by different government arms and the private industry. <b>Cold</b> <b>chains</b> are common in the food and pharmaceutical industries and also some chemical shipments.|$|R

Operations are concerned with the production or value added of products and services in departments within the firm. Outbound logistics are concerned with distributing the food to the final customer. In service industries, firms regularly monitor food supply chain operations, and remedial action is taken in the event of non-conformance.
