5|$|As Bode was {{in action}} at Poling, Alfons Orthofer's unit {{attacked}} Ford. There were only six Lewis machine guns manned at Ford and the Ju 87s {{were able to}} attack with complete confidence. Bombs rained down on huts, hangars, building and amongst aircraft drawn up together for maintenance. Early on bombs struck the field's oil tanks and storage compounds causing an enormous blaze which contributed to the crippling damage on the airfield. Gosport also <b>came</b> <b>under</b> <b>attack</b> soon after. Siegel's Ju 87s, with no air opposition, swooped onto their targets causing large-scale damage.|$|E

5|$|In mid-May, Liverpool {{joined a}} group of {{warships}} that was to have escorted Trinidad on her return journey to Britain. After temporary repairs in Russia, Trinidad got underway on 13 May. The group that included Liverpool positioned itself west of Bear Island, in the Barents Sea, to rendezvous with the cruiser. On 14 May, Trinidad came under repeated attack and was set ablaze by bombs. The British had to evacuate and sink her the following day when the fire became uncontrollable. Liverpool {{and the rest of}} Rear-Admiral Burrough's group <b>came</b> <b>under</b> <b>attack</b> themselves on the return journey. On 25 May, Liverpool began escorting PQ 16, a convoy of 35 merchant vessels bound for Murmansk, the largest convoy yet undertaken in support of the Soviet Union. PQ 16 had considerable protection, including the light and heavy cruisers , Kent, and Norfolk, and numerous destroyers and submarines, with distant cover provided by the Home Fleet. Inevitably, the convoy <b>came</b> <b>under</b> <b>attack,</b> beginning with a sortie on 25 May that damaged the freighter SS Carlton. Sustained attacks from U-boats and at least 242 German aircraft yielded a total of seven vessels sunk on 26–27 May. The cruiser escort switched to the returning convoy QP 12 on 26 May.|$|E
5|$|MacLachlan {{found himself}} {{at the heart of}} the battle for the island before the {{squadron}} arrived. On 27 November the convoy <b>came</b> <b>under</b> <b>attack</b> from the Italian Navy in the Battle of Cape Spartivento. MacLachlan saw the Italian fleet at a distance and witnessed enemy shells splashing around the ship. He also witnessed an attack by Italian Savoia-Marchetti SM.79 bombers but they failed to damage the ships. Most of the Hurricanes that took off from the Argus fell into the water out of fuel. The pilots had not run the Hurricanes at economic speeds for fuel consumption.|$|E
5|$|The Australian {{mainland}} <b>came</b> <b>under</b> <b>attack</b> during 1942 and 1943. Japanese submarines operated off Australia from May to August 1942 and January to June 1943.

On 14 May 1943 the hospital ship AHS Centaur was sunk by a Japanese submarine off Brisbane {{with the loss of}} 268 lives. Japanese aircraft also conducted air raids against Allied bases in northern Australia which were being used to mount the North Western Area Campaign against Japanese positions in the Netherlands East Indies (NEI).|$|E

5|$|Before any troop {{transportation}} {{could be}} undertaken, {{all of the}} ships had to be hastily refitted. Of the fourteen ships, four, including El Occidente, were designated to carry animals and cargo; the other ten were designated to carry human passengers. The four ships designated to carry animals had to have ramps and stalls built. All the ships had to have gun platforms installed, before each ship docked at the Brooklyn Navy Yard to have the guns themselves installed. All the ships were manned by merchant officers and crews but carried two U.S. Navy officers, Navy gun crews, quartermasters, signalmen, and wireless operators. The senior Navy officer on board would take control if a ship <b>came</b> <b>under</b> <b>attack.</b>|$|E

The following day Raymond marched on the castle and found it deserted. The crusaders briefly occupied the castle in February {{of the same year}} but abandoned it when they continued their march towards Jerusalem. Permanent occupation began in 1110 when Tancred, Prince of Galilee took control of the site. The early castle was substantially different from the extant remains and no trace of this first castle survives at the site.|$|E

On 8 February 1971 the leading ARVN units marched along Route 9 into Southern Laos while the US ground forces and advisers were prohibited from entering Laos. US logistical, aerial, and artillery support {{was provided to}} the operation. Following the ARVN defeat in Laos, the newly re-opened KSCB <b>came</b> <b>under</b> <b>attack</b> by NVA sappers and artillery and the base was abandoned once again on 6 April 1971.|$|E

B Company also lost heavily in action, falling to a strength of about 85 men.
