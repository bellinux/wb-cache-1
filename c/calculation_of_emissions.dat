The construction of a project baseline often depends on hypothetical scenario modeling, and may be estimated through reference to emissions from similar activities and technologies in the same country or other countries, or to actual emissions prior to project implementation. The partners {{involved in the project}} could have an interest in establishing a baseline with high emissions, which would yield a risk of awarding spurious credits.

40|$|Electron {{emission}} from nanometric size emitters becomes {{of increasing}} interest {{due to its}} involvement to sharp electron sources, vacuum breakdown phenomena and various other vacuum nanoelectronics applications. The most commonly used theoretical tools for the <b>calculation</b> <b>of</b> electron <b>emission</b> are still nowadays the Fowler-Nordheim and the Richardson-Laue-Dushman equations {{although it has been}} shown since the 1990 's that they are inadequate for nanometrically sharp emitters or in the intermediate thermal-field regime. In this paper we develop a computational method for the <b>calculation</b> <b>of</b> <b>emission</b> currents and Nottingham heat, which automatically distinguishes among different emission regimes, and implements the appropriate calculation method for each. Our method covers all electron emission regimes (thermal, field and intermediate), aiming to maximize the calculation accuracy while minimizing the computational time. As an example, we implemented it in atomistic simulations of the thermal evolution of Cu nanotips under strong electric fields and found that the predicted behaviour of such nanotips by the developed technique differs significantly from estimations obtained based on the Fowler-Nordheim equation. Finally, we show that our tool can be also successfully applied in the analysis of experimental $I-V$ data...|$|R
40|$|Vehicles {{are tested}} in {{controlled}} and relatively narrow laboratory conditions {{to determine their}} official emission values and reference fuel consumption. However, on the road, ambient and driving conditions can vary over a wide range, sometimes causing emissions {{to be higher than}} those measured in the laboratory. For this reason, the European Commission has developed a complementary Real-Driving Emissions (RDE) test procedure using the Portable Emissions Measurement Systems (PEMS) to verify gaseous pollutant and particle number emissions during a wide range of normal operating conditions on the road. This paper presents the newly-adopted RDE test procedure, differentiating six steps: 1) vehicle selection, 2) vehicle preparation, 3) trip design, 4) trip execution, 5) trip verification, and 6) <b>calculation</b> <b>of</b> <b>emissions.</b> Of these steps, vehicle preparation and trip execution are described in greater detail.

30|$|The {{fuel mix}} at each {{desalter}} determines {{the mass of}} pollutants emitted per unit volume of fuel consumed. The <b>calculation</b> <b>of</b> <b>emissions</b> per unit of fuel {{is based on the}} U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) estimates for the different boiler types in use at each desalting unit [33]. Based on U.S. EPA emission factors for each boiler-fuel combination, we calculate statistical emission factors (g/MMBtu) for each plant. More than 99 % of the energy mix burned at these plants is natural gas, with the remainder provided by fuel oil, crude oil, and gas oil [34]. To estimate the total emissions for each plant attributable to residential water production under each scenario, we multiply the emission rate (g/kW h) for each plant by the total energy (Energywater,total, in kW h/m 3) used for water production and by the total amount of water produced to meet residential demand in Abu Dhabi City in 2008.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Gas content can be {{considered}} the most important parameter for assessing emissions from coal seams during and post mining. Traditionally, the purpose of gas content determination was to assess gas outburst potentials and to quantify the magnitude of gas emissions into underground headings and at the coal face. Therefore, it’s a traditional definition; measurement and determination are based on these objectives. However, the <b>calculation</b> <b>of</b> <b>emissions</b> from mining {{for the purpose of}} establishing a greenhouse gas inventory would require new definitions for gas content and new measurement methods. Moreover, errors inherent in measuring gas content need to be quantified so that the uncertainty of emissions inventory can be evaluated. Therefore, various definitions of gas content in relation to the purpose of its use are suggested. Anew method of measurement for low gas content coals is discussed. Moreover, various parameters influencing the value of measured gas content are discussed and errors of estimation using the direct method are evaluated...|$|E

40|$|The road {{pollutant}} emissions, {{above all}} in urban context, are correlated to many infrastructural parameters and to traffi c intensity and typology.

40|$|Tunnels {{for road}} and street traffic become {{increasingly}} important for transport provisions, primarily in large cities. Currently, there are in Stockholm and Gothenburg high-volume tunnels in the primary road network. In addition, many new tunnels will soon be finalised or are planned both in Stockholm and Gothenburg. The exhaust emissions in road tunnels may not exceed certain limits. Road tunnels are equipped with ventilation systems {{to make sure that}} limits for air quality are not exceeded, primarily emissions of NO 2. The ventilation systems are dimensioned using data on maximum expected emissions per unit of time. VTI has obtained a commission from the Swedish National Road Administration (SNRA) to develop a model for calculation of exhaust emissions in tunnels, which in addition shall take into account oversaturated conditions. Currently, SNRA has no satisfactory model for calculations at hourly level. The objective of the development effort has been to formulate a calculation model for travel speeds and emissions in motorway tunnels, to be used when tunnel ventilation systems are dimensioned. For a complete structure, the model shall provide individual tunnel tube emission data for hourly traffic, split upon homogenous - from the viewpoint of traffic engineering - road links and ventilation segments. This report describes the results of the development project for <b>calculation</b> <b>of</b> <b>emissions</b> in tunnels. The completed model comprises two parts, one for calculation of speed and corresponding hourly flow at given demand level and one for <b>calculation</b> <b>of</b> <b>emissions,</b> using hourly flows and speed as input data. For each part, there is a computer program with user manual. Test runs of the model for some basic typical tunnel cases, has been carried out to illustrate the results of the total model. The total emissions of NOx (kg/km) as a function of traffic flow have been calculated for different degree of traffic load. In addition, the model has been validated by comparisons of calculated NOx values from the model with measured NOx values in three different tunnels: the Gnistäng tunnel and the Tingstad tunnel in Gothenburg and the Southern Route tunnel in Stockholm...|$|E
