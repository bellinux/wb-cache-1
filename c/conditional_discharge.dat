In 1967, Jagger and Richards were arrested on drug charges and were given unusually harsh sentences: Jagger was sentenced to three months' imprisonment for possession of four over-the-counter pep pills he had purchased in Italy. The traditionally conservative editor of The Times, William Rees-Mogg, wrote an article critical of the sentences; and on appeal Richards' sentence was overturned and Jagger's was amended to a <b>conditional</b> <b>discharge</b> (although he ended up spending one night inside London's Brixton Prison). The Rolling Stones continued to face legal battles for the next decade.|$|E
5|$|After {{a four-month}} investigation, the {{criminal}} justice branch of the Attorney General of British Columbia announced formal charges of assault causing bodily harm against Bertuzzi on June 24, 2004. With the charge, Bertuzzi faced up to one-and-a-half years in prison. Bertuzzi pleaded guilty to the assault charge on December 22 after arranging a plea bargain with prosecutors. He was given a <b>conditional</b> <b>discharge</b> requiring 80 {{hours of community service}} and one year's probation that additionally prohibited him from playing in any hockey game Moore was competing in. Under Canadian law, Bertuzzi's successful completion of his probationary period precluded him from a criminal record. Moore expressed disappointment regarding Bertuzzi's discharge and was upset that he was unable to attend the court date, having to issue a written victim statement instead. Moore's lawyer, Tim Danson, was given one day's notice of the court date following Bertuzzi's plea bargain, which he said was insufficient time for Moore to travel to Vancouver.|$|E

25|$|Ant {{was brought}} to court at the Old Bailey. The charges against him, which {{included}} criminal damage and threatening members of the public, were reduced to a single count of causing affray, to which he pleaded guilty. He was fined £500 and ordered to psychiatric care with a suspended sentence. In June 2003, he was arrested again by police after a conflict with a neighbour resulted in him attempting to smash in the neighbour's patio door with a shovel, and then lying down on the concrete floor of a café basement with his trousers pulled down, curling up, and trying to sleep. Once again {{he was charged with}} affray and criminal damage and spent time in psychiatric wards. In September of that year he was sectioned under the Mental Health Act 1983, and spent a further six months receiving in-patient psychiatric care. He was eventually granted a <b>conditional</b> <b>discharge</b> by the judge at Highbury Magistrates Court.|$|E
25|$|Richards' notoriety for {{illicit drug}} use stems in part from several drug busts during the late 1960s and 1970s and his candour about using heroin and other substances. Richards has been tried on drug-related charges five times: in 1967, twice in 1973, in 1977, and in 1978. The first trial – the only one {{involving}} a prison sentence – resulted from a February 1967 police raid on Redlands, Richards' Sussex estate, where he and some friends, including Jagger, were spending the weekend. The subsequent arrest of Richards and Jagger put them on trial before the British courts, while also exposing them to public opinion. On 29 June 1967, Jagger was sentenced to three months' imprisonment for possession of four amphetamine tablets. Richards {{was found guilty of}} allowing cannabis to be smoked on his property and sentenced to one year in prison. Both Jagger and Richards were imprisoned at that point: Jagger was taken to Brixton Prison in south London, and Richards to Wormwood Scrubs Prison in west London. Both were released on bail the next day pending appeal. On 1 July The Times ran an editorial entitled Who breaks a butterfly upon a wheel?, portraying Jagger's sentence as persecution, and public sentiment against the convictions increased. A month later the appeals court overturned Richards' conviction for lack of evidence, and gave Jagger a <b>conditional</b> <b>discharge.</b>|$|E

The Guardian reported that the investigation and prosecution [...] "ended in fiasco with Whittamore and three others receiving <b>conditional</b> <b>discharges,</b> and a trial of other members collapsing before it even started."

Kane and his cousin appeared before a grand jury on August 19. While they were cleared of any felony charges, the two were still indicted on less severe misdemeanor assault, theft and harassment charges. Kane and his cousin reiterated their not guilty pleas when appearing in court the next day. On August 27, Kane and cousin pleaded guilty to noncriminal disorderly conduct charges, and were both given <b>conditional</b> <b>discharges,</b> avoiding any penalties if they stayed out of trouble for a year, and also ordered to apologize to Radecki.|$|R

On 31 July, the appeals court overturned Richards' conviction, and Jagger's sentence was reduced to a <b>conditional</b> <b>discharge.</b> Jones' trial took place in November 1967; in December, after appealing the original prison sentence, Jones received a £1,000 fine and was put on three years' probation, with an order to seek professional help.|$|E

On 10 March 1993, Gannon verbally abused Stoke City player Mark Stein, who reacted by assaulting Gannon. Gannon made a formal complaint {{to the police and}} as a result Stein was later required to appear in court for the attack. The two players' confrontation continued the following month after Gannon's then-girlfriend spat at Stein in a post-match interview. Stein was given a <b>conditional</b> <b>discharge</b> after the court accepted he was under [...] "extreme provocation" [...] from what he claimed was racial abuse. During his early days at the club Gannon was criticised by supporters for his performances, but he soon won them over after moving from centre-half to become a goalscoring midfielder.

40|$|The article {{considers}} {{the level of}} professionalism in police investigations of illegal wildlife trade in Norway by identifying factors that influence the decision-making of investigators and prosecutors. It argues that {{with a lack of}} achievement targets, weak management of environmental crime investigation, and national laws that prevent the regulation of domestic trade in species covered by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Flora and Fauna, investigations become compromised. Inconsistent crime recording impedes the production of reliable statistics on the extent and distribution of violations, which likely has a negative effect on decisions to prioritize such cases. Many investigations result in fines, <b>conditional</b> <b>discharges,</b> or dismissals based on insufficient evidence or lack of prosecutorial capacity. However, the variations in the sample prevent reaching generally applicable conclusions about the overall state of investigations. Arguably, a lack of direction at the policy level leaves investigations vulnerable to systemic weaknesses, as they are largely dependent on the dedication of individual officers and local leaders...|$|R

The Hells Angels' West Wales chapter clubhouse in Haverfordwest was raided by police in September 2007, with the police finding a handgun fitted with a {{silencer}} loaded with a full magazine of bullets. Gary Young, a probationary club member, was charged with possessing the weapon; he denied the charge and was found not guilty. He was later granted a <b>conditional</b> <b>discharge</b> for two years after admitting possessing a firearm without a certificate, possessing an offensive weapon and possessing three amounts of cannabis, charges which stemmed from several further police raids on his home during the initial investigation. Young was expelled from the Hells Angels due to the club taking exception to him [...] "naming names" [...] about who was whom within the West Wales chapter.|$|E
5000|$|In England and Wales, a <b>conditional</b> <b>discharge</b> is a {{sentence}} vitiating {{the finding of}} guilt in which the offender receives no punishment provided that, in a period set by the court (not more than three years), no further offence is committed.

Pursuant section 14 of the Powers of Criminal Courts (Sentencing) Act 2000 [...] and R v Patel 2006 EWCA Crim 2689 the <b>conditional</b> <b>discharge</b> does not constitute a conviction unless the individual breaches the <b>conditional</b> <b>discharge</b> and is re-sentenced.|$|E
5000|$|A {{criminal}} court may impose a [...] "mandate" [...] {{as part of}} a legal process on a person accused of a crime consisting of an obligation to engage in certain conditions or activities in exchange for suspension or reduction in penalty; such as, conditions of probation, <b>conditional</b> <b>discharges,</b> or other <b>conditional</b> sentences. For example, a defendant convicted of driving while intoxicated or drug possession may be mandated to engage in alcoholism or substance abuse rehabilitation. The term is paradoxical because acceptance of the [...] "mandate" [...] is a voluntary act by the defendant, who also has the option of serving what would most generally (though the relative weight is a matter determined by the individual's perspective and readiness to change) be viewed as a harsher alternative, such as incarceration. In this sense, the mandate is not truly mandatory, but is instead a type of legal fiction wherein the court assumes an illusion of power which, in actuality, is constrained by the defendant's free will.|$|R
