5|$|Based on Henry VIII's {{desire for}} an {{annulment}} {{of his marriage}} (first requested of Pope Clement VII in 1527), the English Reformation was at the outset more of a political affair than a theological dispute. The reality of political differences between Rome and England allowed growing theological disputes to <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>fore.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{production}} {{of renewable energy}} in Scotland {{is an issue that}} has <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>fore</b> in technical, economic, and political terms during the opening years of the 21st century. The natural resource base for renewable energy is extraordinary by European, and even global standards, with the most important potential sources being wind, wave, and tide.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{scarcity}} of inhabitants in the Rhondda prior to industrialisation, there are few residents of note before the valleys became a coal mining area. The earliest individuals to <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>fore</b> were linked with the coal industry and the people; physical men who found {{a way out of}} the Rhondda through sport; charismatic orators who led the miners through unions or political and religious leaders who tended to the deeply religious chapel going public.|$|E

5|$|In 1987, Grumman Aerospace {{took over}} {{support for the}} A-10 program. In 1993, Grumman updated the damage {{tolerance}} assessment and Force Structural Maintenance Plan and Damage Threat Assessment. Over the next few years, problems with wing structure fatigue, first noticed in production years earlier, began to <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>fore.</b> The process of implementing the maintenance plan was greatly delayed by the base re-alignment and closure commission (BRAC), which led to 80% of the original workforce being let go.|$|E
5|$|The Foundation's next advert {{invited the}} general public {{to vote for the}} worst artist, either by going to the {{exhibition}} and using their critical faculties or by letting their inherent prejudices <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>fore.</b> The final advert summarised the whole campaign, asked some questions back to the people that had written to them, and explained that the winner of the K Foundation award would be announced in a TV advert during the live Turner Prize coverage on Channel 4 television.|$|E
5|$|In late 1907 the Knights {{moved to}} Cornwall, staying first in Newlyn, {{before moving to}} the nearby village of Lamorna. There, {{alongside}} Lamorna Birch and Alfred Munnings, they became central figures in the artists colony known as the Newlyn School. By March 1908 both had work exhibited at the Newlyn Art Gallery and Harold Knight was an established professional portrait painter, while Laura Knight was still developing her art. Around Newlyn the Knights found themselves among a group of sociable and energetic artists, which appears to have allowed the more vivid and dynamic aspects of Laura's personality to <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>fore.</b>|$|E

5|$|In modern times, the Welsh {{roots of}} the college <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>fore</b> most {{prominently}} on Saint David's Day. The feast {{is marked by a}} choral Evensong in the chapel, decorated for the occasion with daffodils. The service, including music, is conducted entirely in Welsh (despite only a small minority of the choir usually being native speakers of the language). It is generally well attended by members of the Welsh community in Oxford. The college's annual St. David's Day Dinner traditionally culminates with the serving of Sir Watkin Williams-Wynn's Pudding. The name recalls the Welsh politician and prominent Jacobite who attended the college early in the 18th century.|$|E
5|$|Romney {{sought to}} bring near-universal health {{insurance}} coverage to the state. This came after Staples founder Tom Stemberg told him {{at the start of}} his term that doing so would be the best way he could help people. Another factor was that the federal government, owing to the rules of Medicaid funding, threatened to cut $385million in those payments to Massachusetts if the state did not reduce the number of uninsured recipients of health care services. Although the idea of universal health insurance had not <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>fore</b> during the campaign, Romney decided that because people without insurance still received expensive health care, the money spent by the state for such care could be better used to subsidize insurance for the poor.|$|E
25|$|This {{activism}} {{occurred in}} the context of a broader anti-psychiatry movement that had <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>fore</b> in the 1960s and was challenging the legitimacy of psychiatric diagnosis. Anti-psychiatry activists protested at the same APA conventions, with some shared slogans and intellectual foundations.|$|E

25|$|The planet should rotate {{relatively}} quickly so {{that the}} day-night cycle is not overlong.

25|$|The Habad-Lubavitch {{intellectual}} {{school of}} Hasidism {{broke away from}} General-Hasidism's emotional faith orientation, by making the mind central as the route to the internal heart. Its texts combine what they view as rational investigation with explanation of Kabbalah through articulating unity in a common Divine essence. In recent times, the messianic element latent in Hasidism has <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>fore</b> in Habad.|$|E

25|$|One {{interviewer}} found Jones {{to value}} anonymity and {{the enjoyment of}} everyday tasks, like home repairs, and {{found him to be}} uninterested in status symbols and fan adulation. In that 1989 interview, Jones pointed out that greater public recognition actually makes it more difficult to transition between roles and allow the character to <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>fore</b> and the actor to recede from view.|$|E
25|$|At the RRL Glanville {{took on an}} {{increasingly}} more administrative role, devolving research to his assistants, however he still found time to undertake a comprehensive study {{of the performance of}} concrete roads. He also established a section of the laboratory to work exclusively on soil mechanics, a subject which was beginning to <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>fore</b> of building and infrastructure design. He was made director of the RRL in 1939.|$|E
25|$|Aspects of {{the subject}} which have <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>fore</b> in recent decades include {{interest}} in the patronage and consumption of art, including {{the economics of the}} art market, the role of collectors, the intentions and aspirations of those commissioning works, and the reactions of contemporary and later viewers and owners. Museum studies, including the history of museum collecting and display, is now a specialized field of study, as is the history of collecting.|$|E

25|$|The Portuguese {{arrived in}} the area from 1498, by which time the Zamorin (King) of Calicut had <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>fore.</b> Arab traders had firmly {{established}} themselves at his port and although trade still went to the ports {{of the other two}} small kingdoms it was in relatively small amounts. Indeed, the kingdom based at Kolattunad had split into three even smaller kingdoms; and the ruler of Vernad had conceded considerable powers to local chiefs within his kingdom.|$|E
25|$|Though Philip was now {{active in}} {{restoring}} order within his territories, new leaders—such as Maurice of Saxony and Christopher of Württemberg—had <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>fore.</b> Philip no longer desired {{to assume the}} leadership of the Protestant party. All his energies were now directed toward finding a basis of agreement between Protestants and Roman Catholics. At his direction his theologians were prominent in the various conferences where representative Roman Catholics and Protestants assembled to attempt to find a working basis for reunion.|$|E
25|$|Others {{started looking}} for ways to {{stabilise}} the plasma during compression, and by 1953 two concepts had <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>fore.</b> One solution was to wrap the vacuum tube in a sheet of thin but highly conductive metal. If the plasma column began to move, the current in the plasma would induce a magnetic field in the sheet, one that, due to Lenz's law, would push back against the plasma. This was most effective against large, slow movements, like the entire plasma torus drifting within the chamber.|$|E
