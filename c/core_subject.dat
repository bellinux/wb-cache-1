I {{questioned}} the discrimination." [...] She did not subscribe to the stereotypes that were expected of her and experimented with fashion from a young age, often pairing up accessories and clothes that would seem [...] "bizarre" [...] to her neighbours. Ranaut was educated at the DAV School in Chandigarh, where she pursued science as her <b>core</b> <b>subject,</b> remarking that she was [...] "very studious" [...] and [...] "always paranoid about [...] results".

However, a failed unit test in chemistry during her twelfth grade led Ranaut to reconsider her career prospects and despite preparing for the All India Pre Medical Test, she did not turn up for the exam. Determined to find her [...] "space and freedom", she relocated to Delhi at the age of sixteen. Her decision not to pursue medicine led to constant feuding with her parents and her father refused to sponsor a pursuit he considered to be aimless.|$|E
