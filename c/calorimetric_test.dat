40|$|Ice {{content is}} an {{essential}} factor that affects the internal pressure of cement-based materials during freeze-thaw cycles (FTCs). Since the electrical conductivity of mortar {{is closely related to}} its moisture content, it is possible to estimate the ice content based on electrical conductivity variation of mortar. As a result, the ice formation process during FTCs can be monitored. This paper proposed a model to estimate the ice content by applying electrical measurements and clarified the combined effects of temperature and moisture content for electrical conductivity of mortar. The ice content of mortar was estimated with the model by conducting the electrical test. The results are found in acceptable agreement with theoretical results from thermodynamic analysis, and the relationship between ice content and temperature is similar to existing <b>calorimetric</b> <b>test</b> results, which confirm the reliability of the model and the proposed test method...|$|E

40|$|This work aims to {{elucidate}} whether {{the hypothesis of}} zero oxygen at the mixture layer when flame takes place is assumable for every kind of material. For that purpose, we investigated the oxygen concentration there by cone calorimeter tests. A modified holder was developed in order to collect oxygen in this mixture layer. In addition, thermogravimetric tests were carried out so as to relate the possible effects {{of the presence of}} oxygen in the atmosphere where the pyrolysis process takes place, since the cone calorimeter does not allow to control the oxygen level of the atmosphere during the experiment. The reaction rates and per cent of residue in the cone <b>calorimetric</b> <b>tests</b> were measured and compared with the results from thermogravimetric tests. Six products were analysed which can be classified in three main groups: lignocellulosic, thermoplastic polymers and thermoset polymers. Cone calorimetric results showed that for some of the materials analysed (PET, Nylon and PUR foam) the oxygen level at mixture layer decreased until values close to zero. The comparison of reaction rates between cone <b>calorimetric</b> and thermogravimetric <b>tests</b> revealed the char layer created in cone <b>calorimetric</b> <b>tests</b> over the exposed face for brushed fir, Nylon and PET established an important heat barrier that modifies the thermal behaviour of these materials.

40|$|Governing {{equations}} {{are derived}} for the kinetics of physical aging in polymeric glasses. An amorphous polymer {{is treated as}} an ensemble of cooperatively rearranged regions (CRR). Any CRR is {{thought of as a}} string of elementary clusters (EC). Fragmentation of the string may occur at random time at any border between ECs. Two string can aggregate at random time to produce a new string. The processes of aggregation and fragmentation are treated as thermally activated, and the rate of fragmentation is assumed to grow with temperature more rapidly than that for coalescence. This implies that only elementary clusters are stable at the glass transition temperature Tg, whereas below Tg, CRRs containing several ECs remain stable as well. A nonlinear differential equation is developed for the distribution of CRRs with various numbers of ECs. Adjustable parameters of the model are found by fitting experimental data for polycarbonate, poly(methyl methacrylate), polystyrene and poly(vinyl acetate). For all materials, fair agreement is established between observations and results of numerical simulation. For PVAc, the relaxation spectrum found by matching data in a <b>calorimetric</b> <b>test</b> is successfully employed to predict experimental data in a shear relaxation test. ...|$|E

The effects of MPP/PEPA on the flame retardancy and thermal degradation of PP were investigated by {{limiting oxygen index}} (LOI), vertical burning test (UL- 94), cone <b>calorimetric</b> <b>test</b> (CCT), and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). It was found that PEPA showed an outstanding synergistic effect with MPP in flame retardant PP. When the content of PEPA was 13. 3 [*]wt% and MPP was 6. 7 [*]wt%, the LOI value of the flame retardant PP was 33. 0 % and the UL- 94 test was classed as a V- 0 rating.

40|$|A {{reversible}} CO 2 prototype RAC split {{unit system}} has been designed, built and installed in two <b>calorimetric</b> <b>test</b> chambers. The unit {{is based on the}} Lorentzen Cycle with a receiver and a suction line heat exchanger. Both the indoor and the outdoor heat exchangers have tube-in-fin design. The hermetic compressor has two compression stages and is inverter driven. In heat pump mode the CO 2 prototype unit can either operate as a conventional one-stage circuit or as a two-stage system. In air-condition mode, there is an option for cooling of the compressor first stage discharge gas. Experimental tests are under preparation. Realistic simulations have been carried out with the advanced in-house simulation program CSIM using input data for all components of the prototype. CSIM is a steady state circuit simulator (primarily) for trans-critical CO 2 cycles, which uses well calibrated models for all components.

Results indicate that the prototype CO 2 unit will perform almost equal as the R 410 A baseline unit in AC mode at 27. 8 °C and 35 °C ambient temperature. In heat pump mode, the prototype CO 2 unit is predicted to perform around 30 to 40 % better at – 5 °C and 5 °C ambient temperature. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{hydration}} {{of ordinary}} Portland cement (OPC) blended with blast-furnace slag (BFS) {{is a complex}} process since both materials have their own reactions which are, however, influenced by each other. Moreover, {{the effect of the}} slag on the hydration process is still not entirely known and little research concerning the separation of both reactions {{can be found in the}} literature. Therefore, this article presents an investigation of the hydration process of mixes in which 0 - 85 % of the OPC is replaced by BFS. At early ages, isothermal, semi-adiabatic and adiabatic calorimetric measurements were performed to determine the heat of hydration. At later ages, thermogravimetric (TG) analyses are more suitable to follow up the hydration by assessment of the bound water content w (b). In addition, the microstructure development was visualized by backscattered electron (BSE) microscopy. Isothermal <b>calorimetric</b> <b>test</b> results show an enhancement of the cement hydration and an additional hydration peak in the presence of BFS, whilst (semi-) adiabatic calorimetric measurements clearly indicate a decreasing temperature rise with increasing BFS content. Based on the cumulative heat production curves, the OPC and BFS reactions were separated to determine the reaction degree Q(t) /Q (a) (Q = cumulative heat production) of the cement, slag and total binder. Moreover, thermogravimetry also allowed to calculate the reaction degree by w (b) (t) /w (ba).

40|$|This paper {{describes}} the production, characterization and in vivo activity of lipid nanocarriers (LN) containing a levodopa prodrug (LD-PD) with therapeutic potential in Parkinson’s disease. LD is {{the mainstay of}} the pharmacotherapy of Parkinson’s disease. However, after a good initial response, motor fluctuations, dyskinesia and loss of efficacy, develop over time, partly due to oscillations in plasma and brain levels of the drug. LD-PD was produced {{with the aim of}} prolonging the pharmacological activity of LD. To improve solubility, and simultaneously provide a long lasting release and therapeutic efficacy, the prodrug was formulated in tristearin/lecithin LN. The obtained formulation was homogeneous in particle size and remained stable for up to two months from preparation. For the three different tested LD concentrations, namely 1. 25, 2. 5 and 5. 0 mg/ml, the morphological characterization revealed no substantial differences between unloaded and LD-PD loaded LN. The <b>calorimetric</b> <b>test</b> showed an interaction between the lipid phase and the loaded prodrug. In vitro studies using the dialysis method and enzymatic degradation procedure showed that the LD-PD loaded LN provided a controlled prodrug release. Finally, two behavioural tests specific to akinesia (bar test) or akinesia/bradykinesia (drag test) performed in 6 -hydroxydopamine hemilesioned mice (a model of Parkinson’s disease) demonstrated that the LD-PD loaded LN attenuated parkinsonian disabilities, showing a slightly reduced maximal efficacy but a longer lasting action (up to 24 hours) than an equal dose of LD. We conclude that LD-PD loaded LN may represent a future LD formulation useful in Parkinson’s disease therapy...|$|E
40|$|Vapor-injection {{compressor}} {{technology is}} being used in refrigeration systems and heat pumps working at large differences between evaporating and condensing temperatures. However, there are no published standards for the characterization {{of this kind of}} compressors. Calorimetric benches are widely used to characterize compressors, nevertheless, the calorimetric benches, as known, cannot be used directly to characterize vapor-injection compressors, since the refrigerant conditions at the injection port are defined by the injecting temperature and the intermediate pressure. In addition, these intermediate conditions depend critically on {{the way in which the}} injection is performed (economizer, flash tank, liquid injection, etc.). Therefore, the characterization process of this type of compressors is more complex. In this paper, a methodology for characterizing vapor-injection compressors is proposed. The method allows measurement of vapor-injection compressors in a typical <b>calorimetric</b> <b>test</b> bench after implementing some minor modifications in order to incorporate the injection line. With these modifications, the system is capable of independently controlling the intermediate pressure and the injection temperature. The proposed methodology has been evaluated with a vapor-injection scroll compressor (of 17. 1 m 3 /h) using R 407 C as a refrigerant. The measurement results and the performance parameters of the vapor-injection scroll compressor are presented. A simple correlation to estimate the injection mass flow rate as a function of the intermediate pressure has been found, that can be used to correlate the experimental results with high accuracy for several operating conditions.

The chemical structure of PETAT was investigated by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and 1 H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Thermal properties of the PETAT and IFR systems were tested by thermogravimetric-derivative thermogravimetric analysis (TGA-DTG) and thermogravimetry–Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (TG-FTIR). The mechanical properties, thermal stability, flame-retardant properties, water resistance, and structures of char residue in flame-retardant composites were characterized using tensile and flexural strength property tests, TGA, limiting oxygen index (LOI) values before and after soaking, underwritten laboratory- 94 (UL- 94) vertical burning test, cone <b>calorimetric</b> <b>test</b> (CCT), scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry (SEM-EDXS), and FTIR. The results indicated that PETAT was successfully synthesized, and when the ratio of APP to PETAT was 2 : 1 with 25 wt % loading, the novel IFR system could reduce the deterioration of tensile strength and enhance the flexural strength of composites. Meanwhile, the flame-retardant composite was able to pass the UL- 94 V- 0 rating with an LOI value of 30. 3 %, and the peak of heat release rate (PHRR), total heat release (THR), and material fire hazard values were considerably decreased compared with others. In addition, composites also exhibited excellent water resistance properties compared with traditional IFR composites. SEM-EDXS and FTIR analyses of the char residues, as well as TG-FTIR analyses of IFR were used to investigate the flame-retardant mechanism of the APP/PETAT IFR system.

40|$|INTRODUCTION The {{design of}} a {{composite}} material like Polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) bone cement loaded with a bioactive and ferrimagnetic glass-ceramic is very useful against the development and proliferation of bone tumors. This biomaterial produces heat by magnetic hysteresis loss due to presence of magnetite (Fe 3 O 4) inside the glass-ceramic phase 1 and {{so it can be}} used in hyperthermia treatment. Moreover, the bioactive component of the glass-ceramic confers osteointegration property at the material. The aim of the present work is the synthesis and characterization of a composite cement in which the disperse phase is a glass ceramic (SC 45) with magnetic property, embedded in a polymeric (PMMA) matrix. EXPERIMENTAL METHODS The SC 45 powders, (see 1 for the chemical composition) sieved below 20 micron, were mixed in different amounts (10, 15, 20 % wt) with the polymeric solid phase of a commercial bone cement (Palamed®MV). The mixed powders and the liquid monomer were manually mixed for two minutes and subsequently put inside a mold, obtaining the composite cements. P 10, P 15, P 20. Furthermore commercial cements were prepared as control. The characterizations were developed for all formulations proposed as described below. Mechanical testing of cement samples The compressive strength of the cement were evaluated according to standard ISO 5833 procedure. For each formulation 6 samples were tested. Calorimetric measurements The heat generation was measured with an induction furnace at fixed frequency and alternate electromagnetic field. The samples were placed in a test tube containing 10 ml of distilled water. The increase of temperature that occurred following the heat transfer from the magnetic phase of the composite to water was measured with a thermocouple. SEM and EDS analysis before and after bioactivity test SEM-EDS analyses were carried out to evaluate the morphology and composition of the samples. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION The compression strength of the composites depends from the amount of glass-ceramic phase; nevertheless the reached values satisfy the ISO requirements (> 70 MPa). Calorimetric tests show a maximum increasing temperature of 40 °C that respect the limit imposed by hyperthermia therapy. CONCLUSION The preliminary experimental tests demonstrated a good mechanical properties and a good osteointegration. The <b>calorimetric</b> <b>test</b> evidenced a range of temperature adapted to biological environment. REFERENCES 1. O. Bretcanu et al.

40|$|Nowadays, {{everyone}} {{feels the}} impact of nanotechnology in his life. There is a trend that urges people to revisit many research areas with a nano-view, {{in order to understand}} how the same thing can work at nano- level. This phenomenon is revolutionizing pharmaceutical sciences and many drugs are being reformulated for possibilities of delivering as a nanosystem. In recent years, a particular attention has been focused on new generations of lipid nanoparticles such as nanostructured lipid carriers (NLC), a second generation of solid lipid nanoparticles (SLN), and monoolein aqueous dispersions (MAD), derived from the mesophases originated from the system monoolein/water/poloxamer. In this thesis different NLC, SLN or MAD formulations were developed as drug delivery systems specifically for antiparkinson or antimycotic drugs, in order to prolong their action and reduce the side effects. Bromocriptine (BC), new synthetized L-DOPA derivatives (Der-A, Der-B, Der-C and Der-D) or Clotrimazole (CLO) have been alternatively chosen as model drugs. Physical and chemical characterizations have been performed on the obtained formulations. In vitro and in vivo studies permitted to obtain release kinetics and evaluate the effectiveness of nanoparticulate systems. BC containing NLC and MAD showed high entrapment efficiency and X-ray diffraction analyses demonstrated that the presence of BC did not affect the scattering profile. In this case, different in vitro experimental approaches were evaluated, showing that the in vitro release of poorly water soluble drugs (as BC) is more affected by the composition of the receiving phase (i. e. in term of presence of water miscible polar organic solvents) rather than by the experi modality adopted for the in vitro determinations. In vivo studies demonstrated that only BC-NLC were able to markedly attenuate motor deficit in 6 -OHDA hemilesioned rats, suggesting that NLC represent a more effective carrier to prolong the half-life of BC in vivo. All L-DOPA derivatives were successfully incorporated in NLC. The produced formulations resulted homogeneous in terms of size and remain stable until two months from the preparation. Morphological characterization highlighted that no substantial difference characterized empty and derivatives containing NLC. In vitro kinetics release highlighted that NLC were able to release the contained derivatives in a controlled manner and permit to select Der-A for in vivo tests. In vivo tests demonstrated that the Der-A possess antiparkinson activity. The inclusion of Der-A in SLN, performed using three different concentrations of prodrug, showed different entrapment efficiencies depending on the quantity of active employed. <b>Calorimetric</b> <b>test</b> evidenced an effective interaction between lipid phase and the prodrug. In vitro studies demonstrated a controlled release of Der-A from SLN, also thanks to the extension of the half-life of the prodrug. CLO was incorporated both in MAD and in NLC with high recovery. Shelf life stability evidenced that the solid matrix of NLC enabled to control drug degradation better than MAD. In vitro experiments on candida cells demonstrated that CLO-MAD and CLO-NLC exhibit a higher activity than the free drug. The gelification of CLO containing nanoparticles permitted to obtain formulations able to remain on the mucosa surface. Micro calorimetric assays confirmed that poloxamer formulated gels are able to change their structure, with a rapid passage from liquid to solid (crystalline) form at a temperature lower than vaginal temperature, allowing a selective action in the site of application. Finally it is noteworthy that the production of CLO-NLC poloxamer gel is simple and suitable for industry scaling up...|$|E
40|$|In {{the sixties}} {{of the last}} century solar calorimetric outdoor {{experiments}} have been performed on the combinations of solar shading devices and single and double glazed window units. From these experiments typical reduction factors for the effective total solar energy transmittance have been derived and published. In standards such as EN 832 [1] tables with typical reduction factors of the main shading device types are given. However, for a more exact derivation of the total solar energy transmittance of a façade including solar shading device, other means are needed. Within IEA Task 27 we try to develop and check methodologies to characterize solar shading devices experimentally, and compare with different theoretical calculations. The experimental characterisation is based on a new generation of solar <b>calorimetric</b> <b>testing</b> devices developed within completed European and national projects. In this paper We want to compare experimental results using these devices with calculated results using some new and unvalidated standards for different combinations of solar protection devices and glazings...|$|R
40|$|The {{combustion}} {{behavior of}} a blend made of high impact polystyrene (HIPS) with sodium montmorillonite (MMT-Na+) and triphenyl phosphite (TPP), as a halogen-free flame retardant, is analyzed in detail in this work. The blend is processed through various extrusion methods aimed to improve clay dispersion. The UL 94 method in vertical position, oxygen index and cone calorimetric measurements assess HIPS blend behavior in combustion. TGA, FTIR, SEM and X-ray measurements, together with mechanical and rheological tests evaluate the thermal degradation, morphology, intercalation and degree of dispersion of particles. The use of a static-mixing die placed at the extreme of a single screw extruder improves clay platelets distribution and reduces the peak heat release rate better than employing a twin screw extrusion process. In addition, mechanical and rheological properties are affected substantially by changing the extrusion process. A correlation between clay dispersion and HIPS fire retardant properties is found, as the peak heat release rate decreases with good clay dispersion in cone <b>calorimetric</b> <b>tests...</b>|$|R
40|$|Crystallization of α – Fe phase during {{annealing}} process of Fe 55 Cr 18 Mo 7 B 16 C 4 bulk amorphous alloy has been evaluated by X- ray diffraction, differential scanning <b>calorimetric</b> <b>tests</b> and TEM observations in this research. In effect, crystallization mechanism and activation energy of crystallization were evaluated using DSC tests in four different heating rates (10, 20, 30, 40 K/min). A two -step crystallization process {{was observed in}} the alloy in which α–Fe phases was crystallized in the first step after {{annealing process}}. Activation energy for {{the first step of}} crystallization process (i. e. α – Fe phase) was measured to be 276 (Kj/mole) according to Kissinger kinetic model. Furthermore, Avrami exponent calculated from DSC curves was two and a three -dimensional diffusion controlled mechanism with decreasing nucleation rate was observed in the alloy. It is also known from the TEM observations that crystalline α – Fe phase nucleated {{in the structure of the}} alloy in an average size of 10 nm and completely mottled morpholog...|$|R
40|$|Three Italian zeolitized volcanoclastic {{deposits}} with predominant phillipsite, chabazite or clinoptilolite {{were selected}} to investigate their attitude to form ceramized products of the Cs- and Sr-enriched forms and {{to evaluate the effectiveness}} of immobilization by means of leaching tests. The mineralogical evolution was carefully followed after thermal treatments at increasing temperatures (800 °C up to 1100 °C) which led to the crystallization of prevailing pollucite for Cs-exchanged phillipsite and chabazite and of a Sr-feldspar (about 35 wt. %) along with cristobalite and amorphous matter for all Sr-exchanged zeolites. Cs-enriched clinoptilolite at the same temperature was almost totally amorphous. Leaching tests confirm the substantial immobilization of the polluting cations in the ceramized materials with slight higher values only for the Cs-enriched clinoptilolite, mostly amorphous. Finally, <b>calorimetric</b> <b>tests</b> account for a hydrolysis process widely decreasing after thermal treatments at 1100 °C for phillipsite and chabazite, both Cs- and Sr-enriched, substantially similar for Sr-enriched clinoptilolite and definitely increased in the prevailing amorphous Cs-enriched clinoptilolite. © 2011 Elsevier B.
