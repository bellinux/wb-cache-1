25|$|Originally a {{sub-category}} {{of direct}} discrimination, harassment {{is now an}} independent tort which requires no comparator. The Protection from Harassment Act 1997, and now the Equality Act 2010 sections 26 and 40, define harassment as where a person's dignity is violated, or the person is subject to an intimidating, hostile, degrading, humiliating or offensive environment. An employer will be liable for its own conduct, but also conduct of employees, or customers if this happens on 2 or more occasions and the employer could be reasonably expected to have intervened. In a straightforward case, in Majrowski v Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Trust a gay man was ostracised and bossed about by his supervisor {{from the very start}} of his work as a <b>clinical</b> <b>audit</b> co-ordinator. The House of Lords held the laws create a statutory tort, for which (unless a statute says otherwise) an employer is automatically vicariously liable. Under the Equality Act 2010 section 27, an employer must also ensure that once a complaint is brought by a worker, even if it ultimately proves to be unfounded, that worker should not be victimised. This means the worker should not be subject to anything that a reasonable person would perceive as detrimental. In St Helen’s MBC v Derbyshire the House of Lords held a council victimised female staff who were pursuing an equal pay claim when it sent letters warning (without much factual basis) that if the claim went ahead, the council would be forced to cut school dinners and make redundancies. Because it attempted to make the workers feel guilty, a reasonable person would have regarded this as a detriment. By contrast, in Chief Constable of West Yorkshire Police v Khan, a sergeant with a pending race discrimination claim was denied a reference by the employer that he was suing. The House of Lords held this could not be considered victimisation because the Constabulary was only seeking to protect its legitimate interests by not giving a reference, so as to not prejudice its own future case in the discrimination hearings.|$|E

40|$|Data from <b>clinical</b> <b>audits</b> {{such as the}} Dutch Surgical Colorectal Audit, can be {{used for}} valid and {{meaningful}} feedback information, which may support improvement of quality of care. First, we showed that the continuous feedback cycle of <b>clinical</b> <b>auditing</b> has an autonomous, positive effect on the quality of surgical care. Second, we describe how data from <b>clinical</b> <b>audits</b> can be used to monitor and improve national practice and performance in colorectal cancer care, especially for high-risk patients. Third, we describe how <b>clinical</b> <b>auditing</b> {{can be used for}} the evaluation and monitoring of the implementation of new techniques, such as laparoscopic surgery, on a national level. We demonstrate that, although there is a large hospital variation in the use of laparoscopic surgery, this does not explain the variation in outcome. Last, we investigate how data can be used to evaluate quality of care and give transparency to all stakeholders. As the various aspects of quality of care can be strongly interrelated, quality of care may best be represented using composite-measures. These composite measures can be used by all stakeholders to evaluate quality of care as a whole. The methodologies described in this thesis may be used in many other <b>clinical</b> <b>audits.</b> Promotores: J. Kievit, R. A. E. M. Tollenaar, M. W. J. M. Wouters, P. J.

Twenty of the 42 public maternities which responded had performed so. Thirteen of these 20 hospitals were visited and 56 semi-structured interviews held with administrators and health professionals. Locally available audit registers were consulted to triangulate data. RESULTS: Eleven of 13 maternities visited conducted an average of 6. 8 case reviews per year with a total average of 16. 7 cases per hospital (range 4 - 38). Although interviewees confirmed that audits resulted in better quality of care, five hospitals had ceased performing audits altogether and the remainder did them less frequently, because of audit teams encountering staff resistance, insufficient understanding of the audit concept, difficulties in organizing sessions, and lack of administrative support. Insufficient training and external assistance hindered the implementation of complete audit loops, resulting in a loss of staff motivation.

40|$|Background: <b>Clinical</b> <b>audits</b> {{have emerged}} as a {{potential}} tool to summarize the clinical performance of healthcare over a specified period of time. However, the effectiveness of audit and feedback has shown inconsistent results {{and the impact of}} audit and feedback on clinical performance has not been evaluated for COPD exacerbations. In the present study, we analyzed the results of two consecutive nationwide <b>clinical</b> <b>audits</b> performed in Spain to evaluate both the in-hospital clinical care provided and the feedback strategy. Methods: The present study is an analysis of two <b>clinical</b> <b>audits</b> performed in Spain that evaluated the clinical care provided to COPD patients who were admitted to the hospital for a COPD exacerbation. The first audit was performed from November–December 2008. The feedback strategy consisted of personalized reports for each participant center, the presentation and discussion of the results at regional, national and international meetings and the creation of health-care quality standards for COPD. The second audit was part of a European study during January and February 2011. The impact of the feedback strategy was evaluated in term of clinical care provided and in-hospital survival. Results: A total of 94 centers participated in the two audits, recruiting 8, 143 admissions (audit 1 : 3, 493 and audit 2 : 4, 650). The initially provided clinical care was reasonably acceptable even though there was considerable variability. Several diagnostic and therapeutic procedures improved in the second audit.

Participants: Process evaluation involved health centre staff in both communities; <b>clinical</b> <b>audits</b> used random samples from the adult population (each sample n = 30); ethnographic fieldwork was conducted with resident population.

Results: On almost all indicators, implementation of NQICDS had progressed further in Community A than in Community B; however, some common issues emerged, especially lack of linkages between health centres and other groups, and lack of support for client self-management.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{assess the}} {{implementation}} {{and effectiveness of}} the two-week waiting time policy for cancer referrals and to inform {{a review of the}} cancer referral guidelines by NICE. DESIGN: Systematic review of <b>clinical</b> <b>audits</b> conducted in England and Wales. SEARCH: Key staff in all NHS Trusts, Strategic Health Authorities, Cancer Networks and relevant professional organisations in England were contacted and asked to provide details of all cancer waiting time audits conducted since 1 st April 1999. Searches of the Internet and of a range of electronic databases were also undertaken. Conference proceedings were hand searched. SELECTION OF STUDIES: Obtained audit reports (sometimes only available as an abstract or slide presentation) were independently assessed for inclusion by two reviewers using predefined inclusion criteria. If an audit appeared to be relevant, but {{it was not possible to}} confirm this because information was missing, attempts were made to contact the authors. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Waiting time to first appointment; GP conformity to guidelines; cancer detection (both cancer rates for populations of referrals and type of referral for populations of cancer patients); appropriateness of type of referral according to hospital clinicians; ability of the guidelines to identify correct referrals (patients meeting guidelines but who had a low suspicion of cancer, or not meeting guidelines but who had a high suspicion of cancer); process of referral (referrals received by hospital within 24 hours and mode of referral). RESULTS: 241 <b>clinical</b> <b>audits</b> meeting the inclusion criteria were identified. 193 <b>clinical</b> <b>audits</b> were classified as criterion based (i. e. where clinical practice is compared to explicit predefined criteria), 36 as non-criterion based (i. e. where practice was not compared to predefined criteria), and 12 as research studies.
