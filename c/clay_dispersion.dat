Thermal, mechanical, and surface properties of hyperbranched polyurethane-urea (HBPU) moisture cured coatings have been studied in relationship to chemical structure. Different NCO terminated HBPU prepolymers were prepared by reacting hyperbranched polymers with isophorone diisocyanate (IPDI) or 4,4'-bis-methylene cyclohexane diisocyanate (HMDI). A range of NCO/OH eq. ratios from 1.2 - 1.6 was used.

TGA, FTIR, SEM and X-ray measurements, together with mechanical and rheological tests evaluate the thermal degradation, morphology, intercalation and degree of dispersion of particles. The use of a static-mixing die placed at the extreme of a single screw extruder improves clay platelets distribution and reduces the peak heat release rate better than employing a twin screw extrusion process. In addition, mechanical and rheological properties are affected substantially by changing the extrusion process.

These NBS-mediated PP-g-MAs possess higher graft content than classic PP-g-MAs (i. e. without NBS) while they keep acceptable molar masses. NBS-mediated PP-g-MAs were used as matrices in model PP-g-MA/organoclay nanocomposites and compared with commercial and home-made classic PP-g-MAs in order to evaluate their ability to disperse the clay. Significantly better degrees of clay delamination and dispersion were reached using NBS-mediated PP-g-MAs than with classic PP-g-MAs. As expected, PP-g-MAs having high graft content showed the best <b>clay</b> <b>dispersion.</b> Within the examined range of molar masses, the PP-g-MA molar mass had no influence on the <b>clay</b> <b>dispersion.</b> However PP-g-MAs exhibiting important reduction of crystallinity lead to poor <b>clay</b> <b>dispersion</b> whatever the graft content.

The infiltration rates (IR) of ten arid-zone soils in disturbed soil columns were measured and their relative susceptibilities to dispersion and slaking were determined. It was also examined whether the final soil IRs (FIR) could be estimated from various soil stability indices. The susceptibility to chemical dispersion was determined by measuring the IR of soil columns slowly pre-saturated from below with tap water and subsequently ponded with deionized (DW), canal irrigation (CW), and gypsum-saturated (GW) waters. The susceptibility to aggregate slaking was determined by comparing the IR measured in pre-saturated (slow wetting from below) and air-dry (fast wetting) soil columns ponded with CW. The FIRs of most soils decreased in the order GW> CW> DW. Seven soils were susceptible to <b>clay</b> <b>dispersion</b> induced by DW.

Greater amount of clay was dispersed following soil treatment with sodium dithionite-citrate-bicarbonate (DCB) than with acid NH 4 &# 8211; oxalate (Ox). Treatment with either Na-bicarbonate (B), Na-citrate (C) or Na-citrate plus Na-bicarbonate (CB) produced clay amounts comparable to those obtained with the DCB treatment but extracted only 0. 06 to 2. 11 % of FeD and 0. 24 to 19. 2 % of AlD.

On the whole, the electrical charges of stevensite particles remain negative in the whole pH range. Nevertheless, depending on the pH values, two behaviours were observed. For pH ranging from 2 to around 8, the negative electrical charge remains constant (z = - 20 mV) and corresponds to permanent charges of basal surfaces formed of –O-Si-O- groups insensitive to pH variation. Beyond pH = 8, the electrical charge increases (z = - 35 mV) {{as a result of}} deprotonation of silanol edge groups. Ionic dyes adsorption experiments show that anionic orange G adsorption is negligible whereas that of cationic methylene blue is greater due to columbic interactions. In accordance with eletrokinetic measurements, the methylene blue adsorption capacity onto stevensite particles significantly increases beyond pH » 8 due to the increase of the whole electrical charge of stevensite particles evolved by silanol edge sites deprotonation...|$|R
40|$|Aqueous dispersions of pure {{sodium and}} calcium {{smectite}} clays with platelet sizes {{on the order}} of a few hundred nanometers were characterized using a combination of cryo-transmission electron microscopy (cryo-TEM) and small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS). With monovalent sodium counterions the clay is dispersed as individual platelets, as seen by cryo-TEM, that order into a nematic phase. From SAXS a one-dimensional swelling of the day in water is observed with the characteristic spacing h(s) = delta/phi(c), where h(s) is the separation between the platelets, delta = 1 nm is the effective platelet thickness, and phi(c) is the clay volume fraction in the sample. In calcium montmorillonite, on the other hand, cryo-TEM images dearly show the presence of tactoids, where the platelets have aggregated into stacks with a periodic spacing of 2 nm. From imaging a large number of tactoids the distribution function f(N) far the number of platelets per tactoid was estimated, and the average number (N) approximate to 10. The characteristic 2 nm spacing as well as the small number of platelets per tactoid was also confirmed by SAXS. The present study demonstrates that cryo-TEM, with carefully prepared specimen, is a very useful technique to characterize <b>clay</b> <b>dispersions,</b> particularly in aggregated systems...|$|R

(2017) have also reported the modulus dependency on concentration of polymeric additives. To investigate the temperature dependency of interaction between polymer and clay minerals, we performed frequency sweep analysis of 1.00 w/v% <b>clay</b> <b>dispersion</b> in water containing 0.5 w/v% of polymers at four different temperatures. Storage modulus of polyAETMAC containing <b>clay</b> <b>dispersion</b> was {{higher than that of}} polyDMAPMA containing <b>clay</b> <b>dispersion</b> (Fig.  7). It suggested the presence of stronger interaction between clay minerals and the charged quaternary amine moieties present in polyAETMAC polymer than the interactive forces between polyDMAPMA polymer possessing neutral substituted amine functionalities and clay minerals. Furthermore, on gradually increasing the temperature from 30 to 60  °C, storage modulus of polyAETMAC containing sample increased significantly and that of polyDMAPMA containing sample remained unaltered. This {{can be attributed to the}} network expansion of polyAETMAC at higher temperature owing to the strong interactive forces between clay platelets and cationically charged quaternary amines present in polyAETMAC polymer chains. The data further supported that the cationically charged polymer may be a suitable additive in high-temperature reservoirs and the rheological parameters of the resulting drilling fluid may improve owing to the stronger interactive forces present in the system.|$|E
40|$|Nanocomposites {{constituted}} by nitrile rubber matrix and Cloisite 15 A (OC 15 A) as the organoclay were prepared by melt blending and cured with the m-phenylene-bis-maleimide (BMI) /dicumyl peroxide (DCP) system. The effect of mixing parameters on the <b>clay</b> <b>dispersion</b> was evaluated, including mixing temperature and time, and rotor {{speed of the}} internal mixer. The organoclay effectively accelerated the vulcanization reaction of NBR, which was attributed {{to the presence of}} the alkylammonium salt as the intercalant. All nanocomposites displayed improved tensile properties indicating a good reinforcing action of the clay. Also, the creep compliance was substantially reduced with the incorporation of the clay. X-ray diffraction studies showed the presence of intercalated and deintercalated clay population. The mixing parameters did not have an important effect on <b>clay</b> <b>dispersion</b> and properties of NBR-clay nanocomposites, except for the creep behavior...|$|E
40|$|This work {{discloses}} a novel one-pot {{preparation method}} of polypropylene (PP) /clay nanocomposites with {{high degree of}} clay delamination and improved thermal, mechanical and rheological properties. The in situ simultaneous synthesis of carboxylate clay from native clay and ionomer of PP-graft maleic anhydride (PP-g-MA) through trihydrate sodium acetate addition, combined with water injection in the extrusion process, {{appears to be a}} valuable alternative to the use of organoclay for producing PP/PP-g-MA/clay nanocomposites. The influence of PP-g-MA graft content, and of its ionomer form, onto the <b>clay</b> <b>dispersion</b> has been especially investigated. PP-g-MA of low graft content is compared to a home-made highly grafted PP-g-MA synthesized in the presence of N-bromosuccinimide (NBS). The nanocomposites prepared by combining the use of NBS-mediated PP-g-MA, trihydrate sodium acetate and water injection exhibit the highest <b>clay</b> <b>dispersion.</b> Thermal, rheological, and mechanical properties of the nanocomposites have been measured...|$|E
40|$|This work {{focuses on}} the {{rheological}} properties of polymeric nanocomposites. A model system based on aqueous surfactant dispersions is explored to define the limitations of a concentric cylinder rheometer and its software. Following on from this, hydropolymeric/silicate <b>clay</b> <b>dispersions</b> are studied to assess if dispersion can be quantified. To this end, a reliable methodology of data processing is described, which incorporates {{the use of the}} De Kee equation for a variety of sample compositions. The effects caused by the presence of silicate particulates on the crystallisation properties are studied using optical microscopy techniques. Electrical characterisation using standard AC breakdown techniques is applied to study the effects rheological dispersion has on an epoxy composites insulation properties. Two types of filler are used; silicates and hydroxides of alumina in the form of montmorillonite and functionalised and unfunctionalised boehmite. Raman spectroscopy is used to identify the surface chemistry of the functionalised boehmite. Lastly, the Raman technique is employed in developing a methodology to organically modify inorganic particulates in the form of nano sized silicon dioxide. Functionalised silicon dioxide nanocomposites are manufactured using a combination of sonication and rheology to promote dispersion. Samples are then electrically tested using a standard AC electrical break down procedure...|$|R

The isotherms of NK, RhB 18 and their mixtures are characteristic for liquid expanded state behaviour with repulsive interactions between the two cationic dyes. In the presence of laponite the isotherms show liquid expanded and condensed state behaviour. In laponite dispersions and in monolayers, NK has a strong tendency to aggregate with formation of H- and J- aggregates. The absorption and fluorescence maxima of the monomers in the films are at 435 nm and at 480 nm; H-dimer have an absorption maximum around 410 nm and do not fluoresce. J-dimers are present in all the films with absorption maximum at 461 nm and fluorescence at 463 nm. RhB 18 is mainly present as monomers in the LB films with an absorption maximum at 576 nm and fluorescence at 595 nm. Fluorescence resonance energy transfer from NK to RhB 18 has been observed in <b>clay</b> <b>dispersions</b> and in films with and without laponite. The optimum condition for NK RhB 18 fluorescence energy transfer in the films is 90 mol% NK + 10 mol% RhB 18. Comment: 18 pages, 7 figures, 3 table...|$|R
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. A number of polyurethane (PU) I poly(ethyl methacrylate) (PEMA) interpenetrating polymer network nanocomposites were investigated with regard to morphology and energy absorbing ability. The nanoclays used were umnodified sodium montmorillonite clay and three different types of organically-modified clays: CI 5 A, C 20 A and C 30 B. The nanoclays were incorporated into the lPNs by using an in-situ polymerisation method. The <b>clay</b> <b>dispersions</b> were characterised by wide angle X-ray diffraction (W AXD) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The morphologies of the lPNs were determined with dynamic mechanical thermal analysis (DMTA), TEM and modulated-temperature differential scanning calorimetry (M-TDSC), while the mechanical properties were investigated using tensile testing and hardness measurements. Firstly, the original synthesis procedure and formulation was adjusted by varying the nanoclay C 20 A content, lPN composition ratio, nanoclay mixing time and PU catalyst, including {{a study of the}} PU and PEMA homopolymer composites. AlIlPN composites showed only partially intercalated nanocomposites as revealed by W AXD and TEM results. 70 PU/ 30 PEMA (70 : 30 composition ratio) lPN nanocomposites exhibited potential as materials for damping applications as it had a broad loss factor;::: 0. 3 spanning a wide temperature range. Secondly, the synthesis procedure was modified by changing the order of nanoclay mixing with homopolymer components.
