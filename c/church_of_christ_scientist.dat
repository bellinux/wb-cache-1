25|$|North Street {{was another}} {{important}} commercial street, lined with banks, offices, shops, inns and entertainment venues. In 1892, the Athenaeum Recreation Hall was built at number 148.

Worship took place there from the early 20th century, and another church—the Central Spiritualist Church—was later established there as well. In 1921, Brighton architects Clayton & Black were commissioned (Charles Clayton had executed the original conversion of Montpelier House into two houses so was a natural choice to convert it back again) to convert 97 and 97a Montpelier Road (which had been acquired in 1909 and used as a separate church and reading room) back into a single large church to provide for the rapidly growing congregation. They substantially extended the building, creating a chapel to the south and embellishing the entrance in a Neoclassical style.|$|E

At 29th Street, Maryland Avenue merges into Charles Street, which becomes a divided boulevard that contains three lanes northbound and one lane southbound.

5000|$|With the {{resignation}} of McKean, some efforts are being made at reconciliation between the International <b>Churches</b> <b>of</b> <b>Christ</b> and the mainstream <b>Churches</b> <b>of</b> <b>Christ.</b> In March 2004, Abilene Christian University held the [...] "Faithful Conversations" [...] dialog between members <b>of</b> the <b>Churches</b> <b>of</b> <b>Christ</b> and International <b>Churches</b> <b>of</b> <b>Christ.</b> Those involved were able to apologize and initiate an environment conducive to building bridges.

25|$|Historically, the United States {{has always}} been marked by {{religious}} pluralism and diversity, beginning with various native beliefs of the pre-colonial time. In colonial times, Anglicans, Catholics and mainline Protestants, as well as Jews, arrived from Europe. Eastern Orthodoxy has been present since the Russian colonization of Alaska. Various dissenting Protestants, who left the Church of England, greatly diversified the religious landscape. The Great Awakenings gave birth to multiple Evangelical Protestant denominations; membership in Methodist and Baptist churches increased drastically in the Second Great Awakening. In the 18th century, deism found support among American upper classes and thinkers. The Episcopal Church, splitting from the Church of England, came into being in the American Revolution. New Protestant branches like Adventism emerged; Restorationists and other Christians like the Jehovah's Witnesses, the Latter Day Saint movement, Churches of Christ and <b>Church</b> <b>of</b> <b>Christ,</b> <b>Scientist,</b> as well as Unitarian and Universalist communities all spread in the 19th century. Pentecostalism emerged in the early 20th century {{as a result of}} the Azusa Street Revival. Scientology emerged in the 1950s. Unitarian Universalism resulted from the merge of Unitarian and Universalist churches in the 20th century. Beginning in 1990s, the religious share of Christians is decreasing due to secularization, while Buddhism, Hinduism, Islam, and other religions are spreading. Protestantism, historically dominant, ceased to be the religious category of the majority in the early 2010s.|$|E
