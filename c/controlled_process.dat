5|$|Apoptosis is a <b>controlled</b> <b>process</b> {{in which}} the cell's {{structural}} components are destroyed, resulting in death of the cell. Changes associated with apoptosis directly affect the nucleus and its contents, for example, in the condensation of chromatin and {{the disintegration of the}} nuclear envelope and lamina. The destruction of the lamin networks is controlled by specialized apoptotic proteases called caspases, which cleave the lamin proteins and, thus, degrade the nucleus' structural integrity. Lamin cleavage is sometimes used as a laboratory indicator of caspase activity in assays for early apoptotic activity. Cells that express mutant caspase-resistant lamins are deficient in nuclear changes related to apoptosis, suggesting that lamins play a role in initiating the events that lead to apoptotic degradation of the nucleus. Inhibition of lamin assembly itself is an inducer of apoptosis.|$|E

40|$|Cognitive <b>control</b> <b>processes,</b> such {{as those}} {{involved}} in response inhibition or task switching, have {{been the focus of}} much recent research. Few studies, however, have considered how such processes work together in tasks that require multiple <b>control</b> <b>processes.</b> This paper reports a computational study of random sequence generation and the cognitive <b>control</b> <b>processes</b> involved therein. The task, which is argued to involve multiple <b>control</b> <b>processes,</b> produces several dependent measures. These measures are held to be differentially dependent on the differential efficacy of the various underlying <b>control</b> <b>processes.</b> Initial simulations demonstrate that the model is capable of reproducing subject performance on the basic task. Additional simulations explore differential interference effects of different secondary tasks (held to interfere with different <b>control</b> <b>processes)</b> on the different random generation dependent measures. The work illustrates how the putative <b>control</b> <b>processes</b> may interact in the production of successive responses during the random generation task...|$|R
40|$|Generally, {{so-called}} <b>control</b> <b>processes</b> {{are thought}} to be necessary when we must perform one out of several competing actions. Some examples include performance of a less well-practiced action instead of a well-practiced one (prepotency); learning a new action (novelty); and rapidly switching from one action to another (task-switching). While it certainly is difficult to perform the desired action in these circumstances, it is less clear that a separate set of <b>processes</b> (e. g., <b>control</b> <b>processes)</b> are necessary to explain the observed behavior. Another way to approach the study of <b>control</b> <b>processes</b> is to investigate physiological dependent measures (e. g., electrophysiological or neuroimaging measures). Although these offer another avenue of inquiry into <b>control</b> <b>processes,</b> they have yet to furnish unambiguous evidence that <b>control</b> <b>processes</b> exist. While this might suggest that there are no <b>control</b> <b>processes,</b> {{it is also possible that}} our methods are insufficiently sensitive to measure <b>control</b> <b>processes.</b> We have investigated this latter possibility using tasks that are neuroanatomically distinct, though within the same modality (vision). This approach did not yield evidence for a separable set of <b>control</b> <b>processes.</b> However, recent works using a task-switching paradigm in which subjects switch between a visual and an auditory task suggest that switching both task and modality may be importantly different than switching task within a given modality. This may represent a way forward in the study of <b>control</b> <b>processes...</b>|$|R

25|$|Spark {{ignition}} {{engines are}} designed to burn gasoline in a <b>controlled</b> <b>process</b> called deflagration. However, the unburned mixture may autoignite by detonating from pressure and heat alone, rather than ignite from the spark plug at exactly the right time. This causes a rapid pressure rise which can damage the engine. This {{is often referred to}} as engine knocking or end-gas knock. Knocking can be reduced by increasing the gasoline's resistance to autoignition, which is expressed by its octane rating.|$|E

25|$|In {{contrast}} to necrosis, {{which is a}} form of traumatic cell death that results from acute cellular injury, apoptosis is a highly regulated and <b>controlled</b> <b>process</b> that confers advantages during an organism's lifecycle. For example, the separation of fingers and toes in a developing human embryo occurs because cells between the digits undergo apoptosis. Unlike necrosis, apoptosis produces cell fragments called apoptotic bodies that phagocytic cells are able to engulf and quickly remove before the contents of the cell can spill out onto surrounding cells and cause damage to the neighboring cells.|$|E
25|$|Certain {{amphiphilic}} {{block copolymer}} micelles display a similar behavior as surfactant micelles. These are generally called dynamic micelles and {{are characterized by}} the same relaxation processes assigned to surfactant exchange and micelle scission/recombination. Although the relaxation processes are the same between {{the two types of}} micelles, the kinetics of unimer exchange are very different. While in surfactant systems the unimers leave and join the micelles through a diffusion-controlled process, for copolymers the entry rate constant is slower than a diffusion <b>controlled</b> <b>process.</b> The rate of this process was found to be a decreasing power-law of the degree of polymerization of the hydrophobic block to the power 2/3. This difference is due to the coiling of the hydrophobic block of a copolymer exiting the core of a micelle.|$|E

40|$|Speech {{comprehension}} and production {{are governed by}} <b>control</b> <b>processes.</b> We explore their nature and dynamics in bilingual speakers {{with a focus on}} speech production. Prior research indicates that individuals increase cognitive control in order to achieve a desired goal. In the adaptive control hypothesis we propose a stronger hypothesis: Language <b>control</b> <b>processes</b> themselves adapt to the recurrent demands placed on them by the interactional context. Adapting a <b>control</b> <b>process</b> means changing a parameter or parameters about the way it works (its neural capacity or efficiency) or the way it works in concert, or in cascade, with other <b>control</b> <b>processes</b> (e. g., its connectedness). We distinguish eight <b>control</b> <b>processes</b> (goal maintenance, conflict monitoring, interference suppression, salient cue detection, selective response inhibition, task disengagement, task engagement, opportunistic planning). We consider the demands on these processes imposed by three interactional contexts (single language, dual language, and dense code-switching). We predict adaptive changes in the neural regions and circuits associated with specific <b>control</b> <b>processes.</b> A dual-language context, for example, is predicted to lead to the adaptation of a circuit mediating a cascade of <b>control</b> <b>processes</b> that circumvents a control dilemma. Effective test of the adaptive control hypothesis requires behavioural and neuroimaging work that assesses language control in a range of tasks within the same individual...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Complex cloud {{services}} rely on different elasticity <b>control</b> <b>processes</b> {{to deal with}} dynamic requirement changes and workloads. However, enforcing an elasticity <b>control</b> <b>process</b> to a cloud service does not always lead to an optimal gain in terms of quality or cost, due {{to the complexity of}} service structures, deployment strategies, and underly-ing infrastructure dynamics. Therefore, being able, a priori, to estimate and evaluate the relation between cloud service elasticity behavior and elasticity <b>control</b> <b>processes</b> is crucial for runtime choices of appropriate elasticity <b>control</b> <b>processes.</b> In this paper we present ADVISE, a frame-work for estimating and evaluating cloud service elasticity behavior. ADVISE gathers service structure, deployment, service runtime, <b>control</b> <b>processes,</b> and cloud infrastructure information. Based on this informa-tion, ADVISE utilizes clustering techniques to identify cloud elastic-ity behavior produced by elasticity control. Our experiments show that ADVISE can estimate the expected elasticity behavior, in time, for dif-ferent {{cloud services}} thus being a useful tool to elasticity controllers for improving the quality of runtime elasticity control decisions. ...|$|R

Automatic resource allocation is achieved through the proposition of a digraph model for any Ladder Diagram representation of a <b>control</b> <b>process,</b> which is then translated into an XML (Extensible Mark Up Language) model. The required PLC resources needed to implement a <b>control</b> <b>process</b> are extracted from the XML model. These resources are then used by a selection engine to determine, from a PLC database, the most appropriate PLCs or Embedded Controllers (EBCs) that can satisfy the resource requirements. Additionally, information extracted from the XML model is used to generate a formally verifiable SMV code of the system. This paper focuses on the practical implementation, testing, and verification of three conceptual modules applied to a <b>control</b> <b>process.</b> These are, the XML model of the <b>control</b> <b>process,</b> the PLC Database Automatic Resource Allocation, and the XML-to-SMV translator.
