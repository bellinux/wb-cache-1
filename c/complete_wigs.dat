5000|$|In 1700 Cohen {{published}} in Venice his Derashot 'al ha-Torah, a common title for homilies (sermons) and {{commentary on the}} Pentateuch (Torah). His Derashot 'al ha-Torah {{is also known as}} Kebod Chacamim or Kevod Ḥakhamim (The Glory of Wise Men). [...] In 1719 he {{published in}} Venice his Kehunnat Abraham (כהנת אברהם), a book of religious poems in Hebrew written in the manner of and inspired by the Psalms (Tehillim). Cohen used a number of different meters in his poetry. His Kehunnat Abraham created a stir within the Jewish community of the Venetian Republic and other parts of Italy, full of compliments. Joseph Fiametta published a poem in praise of it, as did Issac Vita Cantarini and Shabbethai Marini, both in the mode of the times, sonnet form. Cohen's engraved self-portrait appears on the fly-leaf of his Kehunnat Abraham <b>complete</b> with <b>wig.</b>|$|R
40|$|Intravenous {{immunoglobulin}} (WIG) {{is increasingly}} recommended for many diseases apart from primary immunodeficiency diseases (PID). Although effective and safe, adverse reactions may occur. We conducted a 2 -year prospective observational study in 117 patients with PID who received regular IVIG replacement therapy at a median dose of 600 mg/kg every 3 to 4 weeks to examine IVIG's adverse effects; 1765 infusions were performed (mean = 15 /patient) in 75 males and 42 females (aged 3 months to 77 years) in 3 groups: = 20 years (39. 3 %). Fifty patients had common variable immunodeficiency (CVID), 11 had X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA), and 55 had other immune system disorders. the drugs administered were Octagam (R) (49. 1 %), Tegeline (R) (17. 3 %), Imunoglobulin (R) (18. 6 %), Flebogama (R) (12. 9 %), Vigam (R) (1. 2 %), and Kiovig (R) (0. 4 %). Immediate infusion-related adverse reactions {{occurred in the}} cases of 38 out 1765 infusions (2. 15 %, IC 95 % 1. 53 %- 2. 94 %), which were classified as mild (81. 6 %), moderate (10. 5 %), or severe (7. 9 %). Time until reaction ranged from 10 to 240 min (mean = 85. 7, median = 60). Reaction rates were similar across age groups. the most common reactions were malaise, headache, and abdominal pain. Reported severe events were tightness of the throat and seizure. All symptoms improved with temporary or <b>complete</b> <b>WIG</b> interruption and symptomatic medications. Sixteen of 38 reactions to infusions occurred in the presence of an acute infection (p = 0. 09). Tegeline (R) represented a greater reaction risk factor than Octagam (R) (p < 0. 001). These results indicate that IVIG infusion can be considered a safe procedure. Low reaction incidence and few severe immediate infusion-related adverse reactions were observed. (C) 2014 Elsevier B. V.

5000|$|Today, Palma is {{best known}} as Shemp Howard's posthumous double. In 1955, Three Stooges member Shemp Howard died of a sudden heart attack. At the time, the Stooges still had four short films left to deliver on their annual {{contract}} with Columbia Pictures. By 1955, budget cuts had forced them to utilize stock footage from previous shorts as a matter of survival. As a result, the Stooges managed to complete the four films without Shemp. To do this, Palma was made up to resemble the late Stooge, <b>complete</b> with <b>wig,</b> and would be filmed only from the back or side. On occasion, Palma was required to add a brief line of dialogue or sound (most notably in Hot Stuff). The few new shots Palma appeared in were then edited together with the recycled footage containing the real Shemp, and [...] "new" [...] films were born. Palma would remain a supporting cast member in The Three Stooges shorts throughout Joe Besser's short run as the third stooge.|$|R
5000|$|In season 3 [...] "Nikki Heat", Castle {{is upset}} when B-movie actress Natalie Rhodes is cast as Nikki, {{thinking}} {{she is not}} right for the role. When Rhodes comes onto a case to observe Beckett, Castle is further insulted that she has not read the actual book. Rhodes considers him unimportant to the film and Beckett likes having Natalie around. However, as the case goes on, Rhodes begins to copy Beckett's mannerisms and outfits, <b>complete</b> with brunette <b>wig,</b> annoying Beckett while Castle begins to like her more. At one point, Rhodes kisses Castle, making it clear she wants to sleep with him to feel the character more but Castle turns her down, telling Beckett that sleeping with the actress playing the fictional version of her is [...] "way too meta".|$|R
2500|$|At {{the age of}} 15 Martin {{joined the}} band of Lennie Hastings a highly {{respected}} jazz drummer who spent many years with the Alex Welsh band. Lennie, although famous for his cod-German routines as Herr Lennie Hastings. <b>complete</b> with irish (<b>wig)</b> and penny monocle was an extremely talented drummer. He had left the Welsh band {{and tried to make}} a go of it with his own band in 1973. The band attracted many fine musicians like Nick Stevenson (trumpet), Peter Skivington (bass guitar), Ron Brown (trombone) and Jamie Evans (piano). Lennie was able to attract high calibre guests like George Chisholm, Beryl Bryden and others. Although the band only lasted for less than a year, Martin (driven to gigs by his father Buck) has said that he learned a lot during that period and has many happy memories of playing with the Oo-Yah band (as it was often known).|$|R
5000|$|Samuel's old Commander, General Anthony Wayne wanted [...] "his {{long time}} friend" [...] Samuel Brady {{to be his}} chief scout in an {{upcoming}} Indian campaign. So, he and Samuel's father in law, Van [...] "Indian" [...] Swearingen of Wellsburg, along with many of Samuel's friends, convinced Samuel to surrender himself for trial in Pittsburgh, so the matter {{would no longer be}} hanging over his head. The case was much celebrated at the time and became one of the earliest court trials in Pittsburgh. The Judge came by stage coach (<b>complete</b> with <b>wig)</b> all the way from Philadelphia to preside at the trial. Pennsylvania Chief Justice Thomas McKean (a Quaker) went along with the trial judge and actually sat on the bench next to him. The jurors were all male and all settlers. At this trial, Samuel was defended by the politician James Ross. Present and going way {{out of her way to}} be conspicuous in the [...] "court room" [...] (apparently a bar) was the compelling presence of Jennie Stupes. Brady had heroically rescued her and her son from Indians thirteen years earlier and the jury members knew it full well. To make sure no juror missed her presence, she walked up to where Samuel was seated and placed a flask of brandy on the table in front of him and a pitcher of water on top of that [...] "for his personal refreshment".|$|R
50|$|Billy Snedden (1976-1983) was {{the last}} Speaker to wear the full {{traditional}} attire of the Speaker, <b>complete</b> with the <b>wig.</b> On {{the election of the}} Howard Government in 1996, the new Speaker, Bob Halverson, chose to wear the traditional court dress of the Speaker upon his election in April 1996, but without the wig. Speaker Ian Sinclair opted to wear a gown, albeit of a simpler academic style, during his brief term in 1998, a practice mirrored by his successors, Neil Andrew and David Hawker. Speaker Harry Jenkins resumed Labor practice from 2007 until the election of Peter Slipper in late 2011. Slipper went one step further to restoring the traditional dress by the gown and the QC's bar jacket underneath his business attire. Slipper also took to wearing a white long tie or bow tie, in a variation from the lace jabot or bands. For example, he wore a wing collar with white bow tie and bands on the occasion of his first formal procession into parliament. The first speaker of the Abbott Government from 2013, Bronwyn Bishop, the first non-Labor woman to hold the post, continued wearing business attire with no gown, a practice continued by her successor, Tony Smith.|$|R
5000|$|Samuel L. Jackson as The Octopus: A former coroner turned {{psychotic}} super-villain {{who plans}} to bring all of Central City to its knees and will kill without discretion anyone unlucky enough to stand in his way. Jackson was Miller's first choice for the role and was cast in May 2007. Jackson, Miller, and the costume designer went through the various scenes of the film to design elaborate costumes for the Octopus to wear—to the point that in every scene he appears in his look is different than the one before. They include a samurai robe <b>complete</b> with a <b>wig,</b> a full Nazi SS uniform, a Western duster influenced outfit with a ludicrously out-of-proportion cowboy hat, and a costume consisting of a Russian-esque hat and a fur-lined coat influenced by 1970s blaxploitation pimps. When asked about the change from the Octopus just being recognized {{by a pair of}} gloves in the comics to the various costumes, Jackson stated, [...] "It's just an opportunity to be larger than life to take the Octopus's theme of dressing the way he feels every day, or having a theme to his day to day life and making some sense with it. And hopefully, the audience will take the ride with us." ...|$|R
5000|$|When Hannah Montana/Miley Stewart {{stays at}} the Tipton, she befriends the candy counter girl Maddie Fitzpatrick. Listening to Miley's dad sing, Maddie {{says that he}} sounds just like Robbie Ray, the [...] "Honkytonk Heartthrob", before realizing that he is Robbie Ray. Apparently both {{she and her mother}} were Robbie Ray fans. When Maddie talks to Hannah/Miley about his career back in the day, Miley starts to believe that her father gave up his dream to sing so that Miley could pursue her own career as Hannah Montana.

Jackson gets fed up and goes to San Diego, followed by Miley and Roxy. Billy Ray Cyrus (as Robbie Ray) performs [...] "I Want My Mullet Back" [...] in this episode. However, upon watching his father's performance and hearing about him being offered to go on tour in Hawaii with Toby Keith, Jackson changes his mind. However, Robby decides not to go on the tour because he doesn't want to leave his kids again. Maddie then also shows up, but is chased away by Roxy. At the end of the episode, both Robby and Miley perform an encore performance of [...] "I Want My Mullet Back", <b>complete</b> with mullet <b>wigs</b> and Jackson, also wearing a mullet, doing the underarm trumpet.|$|R
