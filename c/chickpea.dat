25|$|Cicero's cognomen, or {{personal}} surname, {{comes from the}} Latin for <b>chickpea,</b> cicer. Plutarch explains that the name was originally given to one of Cicero's ancestors who had a cleft in {{the tip of his}} nose resembling a <b>chickpea.</b> However, {{it is more likely that}} Cicero's ancestors prospered through the cultivation and sale of chickpeas.

At Arad in the northern Negev, the remains of wheat, barley and legumes have been found, along with stone lined storage pits for grain from this period. Pottery was imported from Cyprus and Mycenae in Greece for the first time, probably for use as good quality tableware. After the Bronze Age collapse of urban culture, there was an increase in herding and the disappearance of smaller agricultural communities.|$|E

The author notes that bacon is not as bad nutritionally as had previously been thought. He compares the nutritional characteristics of two slices of cooked bacon to one pork hot dog, noting that the bacon contains approximately [...] "73 calories, 202 milligrams of sodium, 6 grams of fat and 11 milligrams of cholesterol", while the hot dog has [...] "182 calories, 638 milligrams of sodium, 17 grams of fat and 29 milligrams of cholesterol". [...] "If health concerns sometimes make you feel guilty about loving bacon ... relax ...yes, it’s high in sodium and fat, but if eaten in moderation or used as a flavoring agent ... it is a guilt free indulgence," [...] writes Villas. Breakfast dishes include French Cheese and Bacon souffle, and Bacon Scrapple. A recipe for BLT sandwich is included in the section on sandwiches, but the majority of Villas's other sandwich recipes are more extreme, and include ingredients such as Jamaican smoked fish.

25|$|The {{earliest}} known {{recipes for}} a dish similar to hummus bi tahina are recorded in cookbooks written in Cairo in the 13th century. A cold purée of <b>chickpeas</b> with vinegar and pickled lemons with herbs, spices, and oil, but no tahini or garlic, {{appears in the}} Kanz al-Fawa'id fi Tanwi' al-Mawa'id; and a purée of <b>chickpeas</b> and tahini called hummus kasa appears in the Kitab Wasf al-Atima al-Mutada: {{it is based on}} puréed <b>chickpeas</b> and tahini, and acidulated with vinegar (though not lemon), but it also contains many spices, herbs, and nuts, and no garlic. It is also served by rolling it out and letting it sit overnight, which presumably gives it a very different texture from hummus bi tahina. Indeed, its basic ingredients—chickpeas, sesame, lemon, and garlic—have been eaten in the region for millennia. Though <b>chickpeas</b> were widely eaten in the region, and they were often cooked in stews and other hot dishes, puréed <b>chickpeas</b> eaten cold with tahini do not appear before the Abbasid period in Egypt and the Levant.|$|R
