40|$|Abstract Background: In {{their working}} activity, {{seafarers}} {{are exposed to}} high levels of stress that should be accuratelyinvestigated, measured, followed up and, if possible, countered. This is also required by regulations recently entered into force such as the Maritime Labour Convention 2006, recommending to consider special physiological or psychological problems created by the shipboard environment. The choice of the tools for this evaluation is challenging, and a common basic standard usable in a large scale should be identified. Aim: The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate: 1) the suitability of the Psychological General Well-Being Index (PGWBI) questionnaire conducted on board for assessing stress in the sailing seafarers, 2) The presenceof stress in seafarers of different categories (<b>deck</b> <b>officers,</b> <b>engine</b> <b>officers,</b> <b>deck</b> crew, <b>engine</b> crew, chiefstewards/catering staff) monitored by the PGWBI. Materials and methods: 162 male seafarers on board of 7 tankers belonging to the same shipping companywere evaluated through the PGWB questionnaire. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to analyse thedifferences in the scores of the questionnaire. Results: <b>Engine</b> <b>officers</b> exhibited significantly higher anxiety levels than the <b>deck</b> or <b>engine</b> crew, andshowed lower satisfaction than the deck crew. <b>Deck</b> and <b>engine</b> <b>officers</b> revealed higher self-control levelsthan the engine crew. Chief stewards/catering staff showed lower vitality levels than the deck crew. Conclusions: <b>Deck</b> or <b>engine</b> <b>officers</b> should achieve a greater self-control than the crew and this is documentedby the present study. Our findings support the view that management responsibility is more often associated with higher levels of stress. In our opinion, the PGWB questionnaire is a reasonable compromise forobtaining a global evaluation of psychological conditions, including stress of seafarers. It should be therefore considered as a large scale tool for assessing the well-being and eventual stress levels of sailing seafarers...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the evidence that}} exists on the global demand and supply of seafarers, and their age profiles. New information on the age profiles of <b>deck</b> and <b>engine</b> <b>officers</b> is presented, drawn from records held by the UK Maritime and Coastguard Agency. Detailed age profiles for certain countries are constructed and {{compared with that of}} the UK, as well as with estimates published elsewhere. Using the data derived from the MCA, it is shown that there is a significant positive correlation between the age profiles of seafarer supplying countries and their level of economic development, as measured by GDP per capita. This evidence is consistent with the view that the future supply of seafaring officers will increasingly be oriented towards countries at lower levels of development, as the existing pool of highly qualified officers from traditional maritime countries continues to diminish.

40|$|Objectives. The first {{purpose of}} this study was to compare the psychosocial working {{conditions}} and mental health of our sample of maritime <b>engine</b> <b>officers</b> with a sample of British shorebased professional engineers. The second purpose was to analyse the relationship between the psychosocial working conditions onboard and mental strain for the Swedish maritime <b>engine</b> <b>officers.</b> Material and methods. There were a total of 731 <b>engine</b> <b>officers</b> in the Swedish merchant fleet, almost all males with higher education. The British comparison sample consisted of consisted 312 professional shore-based engineers. A questionnaire was distributed to the Swedish <b>engine</b> <b>officers</b> with a modified version of the JCQ for the DC-S model, the Role conflict and Ambiguity scale, and two items on family–work inter-role conflicts (WFI/FWI), as workload indicators. The General Health Questionnaire (GHQ 12) and Perceived Stress Scale (PSS 10) were used as strain indicators. Results. There were no significant differences in perceived job stain or in WFI/FWI between the Swedish <b>engine</b> <b>officers</b> and the British professional engineers in perceived job strain. While the British shore-based engineers reported significantly higher role ambiguity the Swedish <b>engine</b> <b>officers</b> perceived a significantly higher degree of role conflict and higher perceived stress. Hierarchic linear regression analysis showed that the Role Stress was strongly related to perceived stress (R 2 = 0. 319) as well as to mental health (R 2 = 0. 222). When introduced in the second step the DC-S model was significantly related to the outcome measures, as was WFI/FWI when finally introduced. Conclusions. The main source of the high degree of perceived stress among the <b>engine</b> <b>officers</b> does not seem to be the job content but may rather be understood from an interactional perspective, where conflicting requirements are directed towards the individual officer. It can be assumed that the fast technological and organizational changes and the increased pressure for economic profitability that characterize the shipping industry have attenuated these role conflicts...|$|R

40|$|Students of BP 2 IP Surabaya are the {{candidates}} of <b>deck</b> or <b>engine</b> <b>officers</b> {{who will be}} on duty on board ship and will encounter many tasks which require English communication skills such as speaking and writing. In order to facilitate those skills, Maritime English has been taught to the students and writing in English also {{has been one of}} the requirements to pass the seafaring courses on BP 2 IP Surabaya. Thus, according to the students, writing is an essential skill to be improved. Recently the issue of self-esteem widely investigated and found correlated with the improvement of writing ability among students. Based on that, this study was conducted. The present study is an attempt to investigate the correlation between EFL writing ability and self-esteem of BP 2 IP Surabaya students. The data were collected using two instruments; Test of English Writing and Questionnaire of Self- esteem which covers three sections of questionnaire; global self-esteem, situational self-esteem and task self-esteem. The instruments were distributed to 107 students of BP 2 IP Surabaya who were adolescents and high school graduates. The first instrument administered was the Test of English Writing and the second was the three sections of Questionnaire of Self-esteem. Subsequently, the data were analyzed using Pearson Product Moment. The result revealed the highest number of students were in good to average writing ability level, the second highest number of students lied in fair writing ability level and the third in poor writing ability level, meanwhile the lowest number of students were in very poor writing ability level and the second lowest were in excellent to very good writing ability level. It was found that in general the students' writing ability level was fair which is generally experience great difficulty while they are writing in EFL, they are also not yet feasible to compete with the native writers. Concerning the self-esteem level of BP 2 IP Surabaya students, the level of global self-esteem, situational self-esteem and task self-esteem were all in moderate level. The correlation between overall self-esteem and writing ability of BP 2 IP Surabaya students was shown significantly positive. The highest level of correlation appeared between situational self-esteem and writing ability, meanwhile the lowest level of correlation appeared between global self-esteem and writing ability. Consequently, it can be concluded that the effort of building student’s self- esteem will lead to the improvement of their writing ability. A preparatory course is needed to improve the writing ability as well as the other skills in English. It was recommended for the EFL teachers to facilitate a healthy learning environment within the semi-military circumstance by supporting a non-threatening interaction between teacher and students or among students...|$|R
