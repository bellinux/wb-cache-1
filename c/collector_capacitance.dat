2500|$|Collector {{triggering}} input circuit: {{the input}} trigger signal is fed to the collector via a fast switching diode , possibly after being {{shaped by a}} pulse shaping network. This way of driving an avalanche transistor was extensively employed in first generation circuits since the collector node has a high impedance and also <b>collector</b> <b>capacitance</b> [...] behaves quite linearly under large signal regime. As a consequence of this, the delay time from input to output is very small and approximately independent {{of the value of}} control voltage. However, this trigger circuit requires a diode capable of resist to high reverse voltages and switch very fast, characteristics that are very difficult to realize in the same diode, therefore it is rarely seen in modern avalanche transistor circuits.|$|E
50|$|PN diodes {{also have}} {{transient}} behaviors {{that might be}} of concern with the design. The capacitance of a PN diode between anode and cathode is inversely proportional to the reverse voltage, growing as it approaches zero volts and into forward bias. There is also a recovery concern where the current will not decrease immediately when it is switched from forward bias to reverse bias. In {{the case of the}} diode OR if two or more of the inputs are at the 1 level and one switches to 0 it will cause a glitch or increase in current in the diodes that remain at 1. This can cause a short term dip in the output voltage. In practice if the diode logic gate drives a transistor inverter, as it usually does, and the diode and transistor are of similar construction the transistor will have a similar base <b>collector</b> <b>capacitance</b> that is amplified by the transistor gain so that it will be too slow to pass the glitch. Only when the diode is of a much slower construction will it become any concern at all. In one unusual design small selenium diode discs were used with germanium transistors. The recovery time of the very slow selenium diodes caused a glitch on the inverter output. It was fixed by placing a selenium diode across the base emitter junction of the transistor making it “think” it was a selenium transistor (if there could ever be one).|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a method to}} reduce the extrinsic base-collector capacitance for HBT using a selective buried sub-collector (SBSC) layer. An experimental carbon-doped GaInP/GaAs HBT with SBSC grown by MOCVD was fabricated and compared with a normal HBT. The base sheet resistance is 200 Ω/square and the emitter area is 3 × 11 μm 2. A current gain of 30 and a BVceo of 10 V are obtained. Both values of gain and BVceo for the HBT with SBSC {{are the same as}} that of a normal HBT, which indicates that the regrown interface between the sub-collector and the collector does not degrade the device current gain and breakdown voltage. The value of the total <b>collector</b> <b>capacitance</b> of the HBT with SBSC is reduced to about half of a normal HBT with the same device size. A cutoff frequency of 47 GHz and a maximum oscillation frequency of 100 GHz for the HBT with SBSC are obtained. About 30 % increase in fmax is observed at Jc 2. 5 V due to the reduction of <b>collector</b> <b>capacitance</b> indicating that the RF performance of the HBT can be improved significantly by using SBSC. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E

40|$|A thermal {{performance}} model for multi-stage collectors {{of the form}} Qu = a H- b(Tf, 1 - Ta) {{is derived from the}} Hottel-Whillier equation. Qu is the collector's thermal power output, H is the incident solar flux, Ta is the ambient air temperature, and Tf, 1 is the fluid temperature at the inlet to the first collector stage.

40|$|Common control {{strategies}} used {{to regulate the}} flow of liquid through flat-plate solar collectors are discussed and evaluated using a dynamic collector model. Performance of all strategies is compared using different set points, flow rates, insolation levels and patterns (clear and cloudy days), and ambient temperature conditions. The unique characteristic of the dynamic collector model is that it includes effects of <b>collector</b> <b>capacitance.</b> In general, capacitance has a minimal effect on long term collector performance; however, short term temperature response and the energy =storage capability of <b>collector</b> <b>capacitance</b> are shown to play significant roles in comparing on/off and proportional controllers. Inclusion of these effects has produced considerably more realistic simulations than any generated by steady-state models. Simulations indicate relative {{advantages and disadvantages of}} both types of controllers, conditions under which each performs better, and the importance of pump cycling and controller set points on total energy collection. Results show that the turn-on set point is not always a critical factor in energy collection since collectors store energy while they warm up and during cycling; and, that proportional flow controllers provide improved energy collection only during periods of interrupted or very low insolation when the maximum possible energy collection is rela= tively low. Although proportional controllers initiate flow ·at lower insolation levels than on/off controllers, proportional controllers produce lower flow rates and higher average collector temperatures resulting in slightly lower instantaneous collection efficiencies...|$|E

40|$|In the {{development}} of a semiconductor process benchmarks for the performance of this technology are needed. The maximum toggle rate of a static frequency divider represents a good benchmark for the applicability of the process for high-speed logic circuits. We report on the design and implementation of three frequency divider circuits in InP-DHBT technology using current mode logic: a 1 / 2 frequency divider, a 1 / 4 frequency divider and a variant of the 1 / 2 frequency divider which uses internal level shifters to avoid saturation of the transistors in the latch pair.

40|$|Due to high {{installation}} costs and relatively low output, the active use of solar energy is limited. The output from a collector {{can be improved}} e. g. by using a selective absorber, AR-treated cover glass or transparent insulation. The output/cost ratio can also be improved {{by the use of}} reflectors. The performance of a collector depends highly on the incidence angle dependent optical efficiency. In this report, detailed methods for measuring the optical efficiency is developed. In order to evaluate the performance of a collector, measurements are needed. For the evaluations in this work, a dynamic test method has been used. The collector output is modelled as: = h 0 bKta(Q) Ib + h 0 dId – kDT - (mC) e(dTf/dtð) where h 0 is the optical efficiency, I the irradiance, k the heat loss factor, DT the temperature difference between collector and ambient air, and (mC) e the effective <b>collector</b> thermal <b>capacitance.</b> Kta(Q) is a modifier accounting for the dependence of varying incidence angles during the day. It is often modelled as: Kta(Q) = 1 - b 0 (1 /cos(Q) - 1) where b 0 is the “incidence angle modifier coefficient”. In order to evaluate the energy output from different collector types, measurements were made on a number of collector prototypes. In the analysis, the collector parameters were identified by MLR on the measured data. In order to verify the determined parameters, the modelled output was compared with the measured output. The annual energy output was then estimated by using the collector parameters in the simulation program MINSUN. In one study in the work, the incidence angle dependence of the absorptance was investigated by outdoor testing. The tested absorbers had coatings of nickel-pigmented aluminum oxide (Ni-Al 2 O 3), and sputtered nickel/nickel oxide (Ni-NiOx). The results showed that the Ni-Al 2 O 3 absorber has a slightly better performance than the Ni-NiOx absorber at high incidence angles. In another study, detailed comparative tests were made on different glazings in order to study the influence of AR treatment on the collector output. The tests indicated that the AR treatment can increase the annual output by 9 % (at Top = 50 °C). Usually a structured glass is installed with the structures facing the absorber. The evaluation indicates, however, that facing the structure outwards can increase the annual performance by 4 %. A detailed study showed that the b 0 factor generally depends on the incidence angle. MaReCo collectors are studied in the work. This is a reflector collector, specially designed for northern latitudes. The MaReCo principally consists of an asymmetric reflector trough with a single, double-sided selective, absorber that runs along the trough. The purpose of the MaReCo is to replace the collector box, insulation, and some of the absorber material by a reflector. The standard MaReCo has an acceptance angle interval of 20 ° - 65 °, outside which the reflector is not active and the absorber only works with radiation direct from the sun. The MaReCo concept is flexible and can be used for stand-alone as well as building integrated applications. Several MaReCo prototypes have been tested in the work. The estimated yearly energy output at 50 °C from a stand-alone MaReCo with Teflon and from a Roof-MaReCo, both at a tilt of 30 °, were 282 and 336 kWh/m² respectively. The Spring/Fall-MaReCo is a special version that has a low optical efficiency during the summer. In this way, a larger collector area can be installed for increasing the solar fraction of the system without increasing the risk of overheating. The test results estimate a yearly energy output of 222 kWh/m² from this collector. For an asymmetric collector (e. g. the MaReCo), the incidence angle dependence will be different in different directions. The angular analysis then has to be made in two perpendicular planes (longitudinal and transverse) of the collector. In the transverse plane, not only the properties of glass and absorber affect the output, but also the reflectivity and shape of the reflector. In order to handle this, a biaxial incidence angle modifier should be used. One example is the common “product model”: Kta(Q) = KL(QL, 0) KT(0,QT). Shortcomings of this model are that it is not correct for plane collectors and that it is not defined for concentrators where normal incidence is outside the acceptance interval. In this work, a new expression for a biaxial incidence angle modifier is suggested: Kta = fL(Q) gTL(QT). The factor fL(Q) gives information about the influence of the glazing and gTL(QT) accounts for the influence of the reflector. This expression differs in principle from the product model, since QL is not used. In order to study the suggested model, measurements were made on MaReCo collectors. The “no-loss efficiency” was determined by eliminating the effect of heat losses from the measured output. The factor fL(Q) was decided from measurements in the L direction made around the equinox (when QT is constant). The factor FT(QT) was determined from measurements in the T direction for constant QL. In order to keep QL constant, the collector was rotated to a north/south direction. The results were then used to calculate the reflector factor, gTL(QT), as the ratio FT(QT) /fL(QT). The parameters were then used to model the energy output. The analyses indicate that the new suggested biaxial expression can be used to model the collector output for asymmetric collectors where the standard model does not work. One drawback of the method is, however, that it requires measurements to be made around either spring or autumn equinox. The new suggested model has also been tested for modelling the angular performance of PV modules with concentrators...|$|R
