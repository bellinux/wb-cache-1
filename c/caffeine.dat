5|$|Initial {{measures}} can include rest, <b>caffeine</b> intake (via coffee or intravenous infusion), and hydration. Corticosteroids may provide transient relief for some patients. An abdominal binder — {{a type of}} garment that increases intracranial pressure by compressing the abdomen — can temporarily relieve symptoms for some people.|$|E
5|$|College {{students}} {{are at risk}} of engaging in poor sleep hygiene and also of being unaware of the resulting effects of sleep deprivation. Because of irregular weekly schedules and the campus environment, college students may be likely to have variable sleep-wake schedules across the week, take naps, drink <b>caffeine</b> or alcohol near bedtime, and sleep in disruptive sleeping environments. Because of this, {{it is important to have}} sleep hygiene education on college campuses.|$|E
5|$|Conclusions on dietary {{components}} have {{at times}} {{been difficult to}} ascertain as results have differed between population-based studies and randomised controlled trials. There is limited evidence that light to moderate use of alcohol, particularly red wine, is associated with lower risk of AD. There is tentative evidence that <b>caffeine</b> may be protective. A number of foods high in flavonoids such as cocoa, red wine, and tea may decrease the risk of AD.|$|E
5|$|One {{published}} {{study that}} analysed samples of mephedrone bought {{using the internet}} in the UK in 2010 found it was racemic (a mixture of both stereoisomers) and of high purity. An unpublished study of six samples also ordered off the internet in the UK in 2010 found they contained very few organic impurities. Four products sold in Irish head shops were tested in 2010 and were found to contain between 82% and 14% mephedrone, with some products containing benzocaine and <b>caffeine.</b>|$|E
5|$|Similarly, {{shift workers}} have {{difficulty}} maintaining a healthy sleep-wake schedule due to night or irregular work hours. Shift {{workers need to}} be strategic about napping and drinking <b>caffeine,</b> as these practices may be necessary for work productivity and safety, but should be timed carefully. Because shift workers may need to sleep while other individuals are awake, additional sleeping environment changes should include reducing disturbances by turning off phones and posting signs on bedroom doors to inform others when they are sleeping.|$|E
5|$|Zoo or {{laboratory}} rearing and isolation are important factors leading to increased susceptibility to self-harm in higher mammals, e.g., macaque monkeys. Non-primate mammals are also known to mutilate themselves under laboratory conditions after administration of drugs. For example, pemoline, clonidine, amphetamine, and very high (toxic) doses of <b>caffeine</b> or theophylline {{are known to}} precipitate self-harm in lab animals.|$|E
5|$|Alkaloids {{are derived}} from various amino acids. Over 3000 known {{alkaloids}} exist, examples include nicotine, <b>caffeine,</b> morphine, cocaine, colchicine, ergolines, strychnine, and quinine. Alkaloids have pharmacological effects on humans and other animals. Some alkaloids can inhibit or activate enzymes, or alter carbohydrate and fat storage by inhibiting the formation phosphodiester bonds involved in their breakdown. Certain alkaloids bind to nucleic acids and can inhibit synthesis of proteins and affect DNA repair mechanisms. Alkaloids can also affect cell membrane and cytoskeletal structure causing the cells to weaken, collapse, or leak, and can affect nerve transmission. Although alkaloids act on a diversity of metabolic systems in humans and other animals, they almost uniformly invoke an aversively bitter taste.|$|E
5|$|Apart {{from its}} use in {{fertilisers}} and energy-stores, nitrogen is a constituent of organic compounds as diverse as Kevlar used in high-strength fabric and cyanoacrylate used in superglue. Nitrogen is a constituent of every major pharmacological drug class, including antibiotics. Many drugs are mimics or prodrugs of natural nitrogen-containing signal molecules: for example, the organic nitrates nitroglycerin and nitroprusside control blood pressure by metabolizing into nitric oxide. Many notable nitrogen-containing drugs, such as the natural <b>caffeine</b> and morphine or the synthetic amphetamines, act on receptors of animal neurotransmitters.|$|E
5|$|Aspirin is an {{effective}} analgesic for acute pain, but is generally considered inferior to ibuprofen for the alleviation of pain because aspirin {{is more likely to}} cause gastrointestinal bleeding. Aspirin is generally ineffective for those pains caused by muscle cramps, bloating, gastric distension, or acute skin irritation. As with other NSAIDs, combinations of aspirin and <b>caffeine</b> provide slightly greater pain relief than aspirin alone. Effervescent formulations of aspirin, such as Alka-Seltzer or Blowfish, relieve pain faster than aspirin in tablets, which makes them useful for the treatment of migraines. Topical aspirin may be effective for treating some types of neuropathic pain.|$|E
5|$|Back at the office, {{the staff}} have drunk {{multiple}} cups of espresso and experience a <b>caffeine</b> rush {{along with a}} powerful surge in office productivity. As the rush dies down, they all begin to sweat profusely, become highly irritable and argumentative, frantically tear up the office carpet to reveal the hardwood underneath, and try to relocate the copy machine. At five o'clock everybody leaves the office in total disarray. When Pam and Darryl arrive back from Philadelphia, they are bewildered by the sight they encounter.|$|E
5|$|Bitterman et al. in 1986 and 1995 {{showed that}} {{darkness}} and <b>caffeine</b> would delay {{the onset of}} changes to brain electrical activity in rats. In the years since, research on central nervous system toxicity has centred on methods of prevention and safe extension of tolerance. Sensitivity to central nervous system oxygen toxicity {{has been shown to}} be affected by factors such as circadian rhythm, drugs, age, and gender. In 1988, Hamilton et al. wrote procedures for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to establish oxygen exposure limits for habitat operations. Even today, models for the prediction of pulmonary oxygen toxicity do not explain all the results of exposure to high partial pressures of oxygen.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{symptoms}} of low mood and energy, individuals with depression may {{be likely to}} have behaviors that are counter to good sleep hygiene, such as taking naps during the day, consuming alcohol near bedtime, and consuming large amounts of <b>caffeine</b> during the day. In addition to sleep hygiene education, bright light therapy can be a useful treatment for individuals with depression. Not only can morning bright light therapy help establish a better sleep-wake schedule, {{but it also has}} been shown to be effective for treating depression directly, especially when related to seasonal affective disorder.|$|E
5|$|In 1889, William Sadler {{moved to}} Battle Creek, Michigan, {{to work at}} the Battle Creek Sanitarium, where he served as a bellhop and helped in the kitchen. He also {{attended}} Battle Creek College for one year when he was 16. Both institutions had strong ties to his church and Sadler was mentored by local Adventist businessman John Harvey Kellogg, who heavily influenced Sadler's views. Sadler's early writings about health are similar to ideas advanced by John Kellogg, including the concept of autointoxication, and the idea that <b>caffeine</b> has negative health effects. He similarly condemned the consumption of tobacco, meat, and alcohol. Although Sadler did drink later in his life.|$|E
5|$|In May 2011, Cielo tested {{positive}} for the banned substance furosemide. Furosemide is a diuretic often used to help lose weight {{but it is also a}} masking agent which may hide the presence of other drugs. Cielo was one of four Brazilian swimmers who {{tested positive}} for the substance and was given a warning by Brazil's national swimming federation. Cielo claimed the positive drug test was a result of a cross-contamination. FINA appealed Cielo's case to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) and CAS upheld the warning for Cielo. CAS claimed that a <b>caffeine</b> supplement had been contaminated, causing the failed drug test. CAS was convinced that the furosemide found was not aimed at improving athletic performance or masking the use of some other performance-enhancing substance.|$|E
5|$|Phytochemistry is {{a branch}} of plant {{biochemistry}} primarily concerned with the chemical substances produced by plants during secondary metabolism. Some of these compounds are toxins such as the alkaloid coniine from hemlock. Others, such as the essential oils peppermint oil and lemon oil are useful for their aroma, as flavourings and spices (e.g., capsaicin), and in medicine as pharmaceuticals as in opium from opium poppies. Many medicinal and recreational drugs, such as tetrahydrocannabinol (active ingredient in cannabis), <b>caffeine,</b> morphine and nicotine come directly from plants. Others are simple derivatives of botanical natural products. For example, the pain killer aspirin is the acetyl ester of salicylic acid, originally isolated from the bark of willow trees, and {{a wide range of}} opiate painkillers like heroin are obtained by chemical modification of morphine obtained from the opium poppy. Popular stimulants come from plants, such as <b>caffeine</b> from coffee, tea and chocolate, and nicotine from tobacco. Most alcoholic beverages come from fermentation of carbohydrate-rich plant products such as barley (beer), rice (sake) and grapes (wine). Native Americans have used various plants as ways of treating illness or disease for thousands of years. This knowledge Native Americans have on plants has been recorded by enthnobotanists and then in turn has been used by pharmaceutical companies as a way of drug discovery.|$|E
5|$|Washington's at-that-time unique product saw major use as combat rations in World War I. Coffee {{consumption}} on {{the battlefield}} was seen as valuable since it gave soldiers a <b>caffeine</b> boost. E.F. Holbrook, {{the head of the}} coffee section of the U.S. War Department at the time, also considered it an important aid in recovery from mustard gas. It was employed by the Canadian Expeditionary Force from 1914 until the American Expeditionary Force entered the war in 1917, and all production was shifted toward American military use. New, smaller producers also sprung up to meet the incredible level of demand from the Army, which in the final period of the war was six times the national supply.|$|E
5|$|While {{prohibited}} drugs are generally {{viewed as being}} the most dangerous, the misuse of prescription drugs are linked to more deaths in several countries. Cocaine and heroin combined caused fewer deaths than prescriptions drugs in the United Kingdom in 2013, and fewer deaths than prescription opiates alone in the United States in 2008. As of 2015 the drug most likely to cause fatal overdose in Australia was diazepam (Valium). While fatal overdoses are highly associated with drugs such as opiates, cocaine and alcohol, deaths from other drugs such as <b>caffeine</b> are extremely rare.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} foods and {{substances}} {{have been found}} to disturb sleep, due to stimulant effects or disruptive digestive demands. Avoiding nicotine, <b>caffeine</b> (including coffee, energy drinks, soft drinks, tea, chocolate, and some pain relievers), and other stimulants in the hours before bedtime is recommended by most sleep hygiene specialists, as these substances activate neurobiological systems that maintain wakefulness. Alcohol near bedtime is frequently discouraged by clinicians, because, although alcohol can induce sleepiness initially, the arousal caused by metabolizing alcohol can disrupt and significantly fragment sleep. Smoking tobacco products before bed is also thought to reduce one's quality of resting by decreasing the time spent in deep sleep, leading to sleep fragmentation and nocturnal restlessness. Both consumption of a large meal just before bedtime, requiring effort to metabolize it all, and hunger have been associated with disrupted sleep; clinicians may recommend eating a light snack before bedtime. Lastly, limiting intake of liquids before bedtime can prevent interruptions due to urinations.|$|E
5|$|Between World War I and World War II, {{many new}} aspirin brands and aspirin-based {{products}} entered the market. The Australian company Nicholas Proprietary Limited, through the aggressive marketing strategies of George Davies, built Aspro {{into a global}} brand, with particular strength in Australia, New Zealand, and the U.K. American brands such as Burton's Aspirin, Molloy's Aspirin, Cal-Aspirin and St. Joseph Aspirin tried {{to compete with the}} American Bayer, while new products such Cafaspirin (aspirin with <b>caffeine)</b> and Alka-Seltzer (a soluble mix of aspirin and bicarbonate of soda) put aspirin to new uses. In 1925, the German Bayer became part of IG Farben, a conglomerate of former dye companies; IG Farben's brands of Aspirin and, in Latin America, the caffeinated Cafiaspirina (co-managed with Sterling Products) competed with less expensive aspirins such as Geniol.|$|E
5|$|Central {{nervous system}} oxygen {{toxicity}} manifests as {{symptoms such as}} visual changes (especially tunnel vision), ringing in the ears (tinnitus), nausea, twitching (especially of the face), behavioural changes (irritability, anxiety, confusion), and dizziness. This may {{be followed by a}} tonic–clonic seizure consisting of two phases: intense muscle contraction occurs for several seconds (tonic phase); followed by rapid spasms of alternate muscle relaxation and contraction producing convulsive jerking (clonic phase). The seizure ends with a period of unconsciousness (the postictal state). The onset of seizure depends upon the partial pressure of oxygen in the breathing gas and exposure duration. However, exposure time before onset is unpredictable, as tests have shown a wide variation, both amongst individuals, and in the same individual from day to day. In addition, many external factors, such as underwater immersion, exposure to cold, and exercise will decrease the time to onset of central nervous system symptoms. Decrease of tolerance is closely linked to retention of carbon dioxide. Other factors, such as darkness and <b>caffeine,</b> increase tolerance in test animals, but these effects have not been proven in humans.|$|E
5|$|There is no {{cure for}} HD, but there are {{treatments}} available to reduce the severity {{of some of its}} symptoms. For many of these treatments, evidence to confirm their effectiveness in treating symptoms of HD specifically are incomplete. As the disease progresses the ability to care for oneself declines, and carefully managed multidisciplinary caregiving becomes increasingly necessary. Although there have been relatively few studies of exercises and therapies that help rehabilitate cognitive symptoms of HD, there is some evidence for the usefulness of physical therapy, occupational therapy, and speech therapy. An association between <b>caffeine</b> intake and earlier age of onset in Huntington's disease has been found but, since this finding was based on retrospective questionnaire data rather than a blinded, randomized trial or case-control study, this work is a poor basis for guiding lifestyle decisions.|$|E
25|$|Coffee borer beetles {{seem to be}} {{unaffected}} by <b>caffeine,</b> in that their feeding rate did not change when they were given leaves sprayed with <b>caffeine</b> solution. It was concluded that those beetles have adapted to <b>caffeine.</b> This study was further developed by changing the solvent for <b>caffeine.</b> Although aqueous <b>caffeine</b> solutions had indeed {{no effect on the}} beetles, oleate emulsions of <b>caffeine</b> did inhibit their feeding, suggesting that even if certain insects have adjusted to some <b>caffeine</b> forms, they can be tricked by changing minor details, such as the drug solvent.|$|E
25|$|<b>Caffeine</b> <b>Caffeine</b> {{increases}} urine production.|$|E
25|$|<b>Caffeine</b> can {{increase}} {{blood pressure and}} cause vasoconstriction. Long-term consumption at sufficiently high doses {{has been associated with}} chronic arterial stiffness. Coffee and <b>caffeine</b> can affect gastrointestinal motility and gastric acid secretion. <b>Caffeine</b> in low doses may cause weak bronchodilation for up to four hours in asthmatics. <b>Caffeine</b> increases basal metabolic rate in adults. In postmenopausal women, high <b>caffeine</b> consumption can accelerate bone loss.|$|E
25|$|Tolerance varies for daily, regular <b>caffeine</b> {{users and}} high <b>caffeine</b> users. High doses of <b>caffeine</b> (750 to 1200mg/day spread {{throughout}} the day) {{have been shown to}} produce complete tolerance to some, but not all of the effects of <b>caffeine.</b> Doses as low as 100mg/day, such as a 6 oz cup of coffee or two to three 12 oz servings of caffeinated soft-drink, may continue to cause sleep disruption, among other intolerances. Non-regular <b>caffeine</b> users have the least <b>caffeine</b> tolerance for sleep disruption. Some coffee drinkers develop tolerance to its undesired sleep-disrupting effects, but others apparently do not.|$|E
25|$|According to DSST, alcohol {{provides}} {{a reduction in}} performance and <b>caffeine</b> has a significant improvement in performance. When alcohol and <b>caffeine</b> are consumed jointly, the effects produced by <b>caffeine</b> are affected, but the alcohol effects remain the same. For example, when additional <b>caffeine</b> is added, the drug effect produced by alcohol is not reduced. However, the jitteriness and alertness given by <b>caffeine</b> is decreased when additional alcohol is consumed. Alcohol consumption alone reduces both inhibitory and activational aspects of behavioral control. <b>Caffeine</b> antagonizes the activational aspect of behavioral control, but {{has no effect on}} the inhibitory behavioral control.|$|E
25|$|Minor {{undesired}} symptoms from <b>caffeine</b> ingestion {{not sufficiently}} severe {{to warrant a}} psychiatric diagnosis are common, and include mild anxiety, jitteriness, insomnia, increased sleep latency, and reduced coordination. <b>Caffeine</b> can have negative effects on anxiety disorders. According to a 2011 literature review, <b>caffeine</b> use is positively associated with anxiety and panic disorders. At high doses, typically greater than 300mg, <b>caffeine</b> can both cause and worsen anxiety. For some people, discontinuing <b>caffeine</b> use can significantly reduce anxiety.|$|E
25|$|Chocolate {{derived from}} cocoa beans {{contains}} {{a small amount}} of <b>caffeine.</b> The weak stimulant effect of chocolate may be due to a combination of theobromine and theophylline, as well as <b>caffeine.</b> A typical 28-gram serving of a milk chocolate bar has about as much <b>caffeine</b> as a cup of decaffeinated coffee. By weight, dark chocolate has one to two times the amount of <b>caffeine</b> as coffee: 80–160mg per 100g. Higher percentages of cocoa such as 90% amount to 200mg per 100g approximately and thus, a 100 gram 85% cocoa chocolate bar contains about 195mg <b>caffeine.</b>|$|E
25|$|Water extraction: Coffee {{beans are}} soaked in water. The water, which {{contains}} many other compounds {{in addition to}} <b>caffeine</b> and contributes to the flavor of coffee, is then passed through activated charcoal, which removes the <b>caffeine.</b> The water can then be put back with the beans and evaporated dry, leaving decaffeinated coffee with its original flavor. Coffee manufacturers recover the <b>caffeine</b> and resell it for use in soft drinks and over-the-counter <b>caffeine</b> tablets.|$|E
25|$|<b>Caffeine</b> is also {{a common}} {{ingredient}} of soft drinks, such as cola, originally prepared from kola nuts. Soft drinks typically contain 0 to 55 milligrams of <b>caffeine</b> per 12 ounce serving. By contrast, energy drinks, such as Red Bull, can start at 80 milligrams of <b>caffeine</b> per serving. The <b>caffeine</b> in these drinks either originates from the ingredients used or is an additive derived from the product of decaffeination or from chemical synthesis. Guarana, a prime ingredient of energy drinks, contains large amounts of <b>caffeine</b> with small amounts of theobromine and theophylline in a naturally occurring slow-release excipient.|$|E
25|$|<b>Caffeine,</b> {{like other}} xanthines, also {{acts as a}} {{phosphodiesterase}} inhibitor. As a competitive nonselective phosphodiesterase inhibitor, <b>caffeine</b> raises intracellular cAMP, activates protein kinase A, inhibits TNF-alpha and leukotriene synthesis, and reduces inflammation and innate immunity. <b>Caffeine</b> also affects the cholinergic system where it inhibits the enzyme acetylcholinesterase.|$|E
25|$|In {{a healthy}} liver, <b>caffeine</b> is mostly {{broken down by}} the hepatic microsomal enzymatic system. The {{excreted}} metabolites are mostly paraxanthines—theobromine and theophylline—and {{a small amount of}} unchanged <b>caffeine.</b> Therefore, the metabolism of <b>caffeine</b> depends on the state of this enzymatic system of the liver.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} {{clinical}} {{studies have shown}} a positive association between <b>caffeine</b> ingestion and panic disorder and/or anxiogenic effects. People who have panic disorder are {{more sensitive to the}} anxiety-provoking effects of <b>caffeine.</b> One of the major anxiety-provoking effects of <b>caffeine</b> is an increase in heart rate.|$|E
25|$|Tea {{contains}} more <b>caffeine</b> than coffee by dry weight. A typical serving, however, contains much less, since tea is normally brewed more weakly than coffee. Also contributing to <b>caffeine</b> content are growing conditions, processing techniques, and other variables. Thus, teas contain varying amounts of <b>caffeine.</b>|$|E
25|$|Products {{containing}} <b>caffeine</b> are coffee, tea, {{soft drinks}} ("colas"), energy drinks, other beverages, chocolate, <b>caffeine</b> tablets, other oral products, and inhalation.|$|E
