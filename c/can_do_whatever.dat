25|$|With the {{way that}} {{everything}} is being done, with people like Trent Reznor and Radiohead, it was very inspiring to us that when you're doing things on your own you <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>whatever</b> you want. Not that we're going to give records away but this time we're starting a label, we want to build it up first and {{have the freedom to}} release exclusive things whenever we want. That's something we've always been able to do until we were on Epic, so it's nice that we're able to do that again.|$|E
500|$|Neil Strauss of The New York Times, while {{complimentary}} on the album's overall quality, {{noted that}} Dookies pop sound only remotely resembled punk music. The band {{did not respond}} initially to these comments, but later claimed that they were [...] "just trying to be themselves" [...] and that [...] "it's our band, we <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>whatever</b> we want". Dirnt claimed that the follow-up album, Insomniac, one of the band's hardest albums lyrically and musically, was the band releasing their anger at all the criticism from critics and former fans.|$|E

500|$|Garbage had not {{initially}} planned to release [...] "Vow" [...] as their first single, {{as a single}} at all, or even include it on their debut album. The band felt that [...] "Vow" [...] was not representative of the album's genre-hopping body of work, although they later came to appreciate the situation {{that led to the}} song becoming their debut. Manson declared that [...] "now we <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>whatever</b> and people won't know what to expect", but if the band had instead settled for [...] "of the more clubby tunes" [...] as a single, [...] "we would have been pigeonholed as a dance band and that's a hard tag to shake".|$|E
500|$|Dinklage later {{appeared}} in the direct-to-DVD film Tiptoes (2003) with Gary Oldman and Matthew McConaughey. The film met with negative reviews, particularly Oldman's role as a person with dwarfism. According to Dinklage, the original cut of the film was [...] "gorgeous", but the director was fired shortly after turning it in, and the film was re-cut into a [...] "rom-com with dwarves". Speaking on the Oldman controversy, Dinklage said, [...] "There was some flak: Why would you put Gary Oldman on his knees? That's almost like blackface. And I have my own opinions about political correctness, but I was just like, It's Gary Oldman. He <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>whatever</b> he wants, and I'm {{so happy to be}} here." ...|$|E
500|$|Streep's mother, {{whom she}} has {{compared}} in both appearance and manner to Dame Judi Dench, strongly encouraged her daughter and instilled confidence in her from a very young age. Streep has said: [...] "She was a mentor because she said to me, 'Meryl, you're capable. You're so great.' She was saying, 'You <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>whatever</b> you put your mind to. If you're lazy, you're {{not going to get}} it done. But if you put your mind to it, you can do anything.' And I believed her." [...] Although Streep was naturally more introverted than her mother, at times when she later needed an injection of confidence in adulthood, she would consult her mother, asking her for advice.|$|E

500|$|Clarkson {{fought with}} her bosses to prevent [...] "Already Gone" [...] from being {{released}} as a single, {{out of respect}} for Knowles. She wanted [...] "Cry" [...] to be released instead, but conceded that, [...] "in the end, they’re releasing it without my consent. It sucks, but it's one of those things I have no control over... At this point, the record company <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>whatever</b> they want with it." [...] Tedder, however, was pleased that the song was released, saying that he likes it more than [...] "Halo". The song was sent to radio airplay on August 11, 2009. In September 2009, Clarkson told MTV that it was unfortunate the two songs sound exactly the same, but noted that they have different vocal melodies.|$|E
500|$|Production {{designer}} Michael Wylie, who {{had previously}} worked on Marvel Television's Agent Carter, found designing for Legion to be more flexible than other series, {{due to the lack}} of set continuity from scene to scene, though Hawley was very specific about his ideas for the series, and provided Wylie with a 'lookbook' for the show when first interviewing him for the job. To avoid dating the series, elements such as cars are rarely shown, and when they are seen there is a mixture of modern-day cars and vehicles from the 60s. Clothing is also a mixture of present-day and past fashions, emulating a prediction of the future from the 60s or 70s. Wylie explained that the [...] "story is being told from an unreliable narrator so we <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>whatever</b> we want." [...] Visual inspiration was taken from the works of Stanley Kubrick, including A Clockwork Orange and [...]|$|E
500|$|Clarkson had {{expressed}} interest in recording a Christmas album for years, having recorded various Christmas songs such as [...] "Oh Holy Night" [...] and [...] "My Grown Up Christmas List" [...] on the [...] (2003), [...] "I'll Be Home for Christmas" [...] on iTunes Session (2011), and being featured on Blake Shelton's Christmas album Cheers, It's Christmas (2012). Weary of constantly being asked for her primary genre, she felt that recording a Christmas album would finally pave a way for her to explore other different genres. She remarked, [...] "I always get asked what genre I'm in: 'Is this country or pop or rock? What are you?' And what's cool about making the Christmas album was, 'Oh, there are no limitations! We <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>whatever</b> we want!'". She further added, [...] "The thing about Christmas is that it almost doesn't matter what mood you're in or {{what kind of a}} year you've had—it's a fresh start. I'm going to clear the air and take stock of the good that's happened." ...|$|E

500|$|Clarkson was furious, and confronted Tedder on the phone. In response, Tedder {{commented that}} he would never give two artists the same musical arrangement, and that her {{criticism}} was [...] "hurtful and absurd". He asserted that the concept, melodies, and lyrics of [...] "Already Gone" [...] and [...] "Halo" [...] are completely different. Calling [...] "Already Gone" [...] one of the best songs he had ever composed, Tedder challenged people to [...] "listen [...] and form their own opinions". Clarkson discouraged her label, RCA, from releasing [...] "Already Gone" [...] as a single because she respected Beyoncé, but they went against her will and released it. She said, [...] "It's one of those things I have no control over. I already made my album. At this point, the record company <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>whatever</b> they want with it." [...] Clarkson later told James Montgomery of MTV News that it was unfortunate [...] "Already Gone" [...] and [...] "Halo" [...] sound so similar, but noted that at least they have different vocal melodies.|$|E
500|$|In 2007, New Line Cinema {{bought the}} rights to produce an English-language remake with Guillermo del Toro as producer. On remakes, {{director}} Bayona noted that [...] "The Americans have {{all the money in}} the world but can't do anything, while we <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>whatever</b> we want but don't have the money" [...] and [...] "The American industry doesn't take chances, that's why they make remakes of movies that were already big hits". On August 4, 2009, Larry Fessenden was announced as the director of the American remake. Fessenden was later announced that he will not be involved with directing the remake, stating [...] "Working on the script with Guillermo was a very exciting experience, but then I got into a casting miasma and that's where the thing is; I think they're gonna do it another way, actually. So I think I'm out of it. Hopefully they'll still use my script, but I'm not sure I'm directing it anymore". In January 2010, Mark Pellington replaced Larry Fessenden as director of the project.|$|E
500|$|Leslie sees Jeanine Restrepo (Loretta Fox), an {{influential}} zoning board member {{who could help}} Leslie with her plans to turn the Sullivan Street pit into a park. Leslie is too nervous to approach her, so she practices with Mark (Paul Schneider), who teasingly pinches her nose because he says as Jeanine, [...] "I <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>whatever</b> I want"; Ann pinches Mark's nose and Leslie pinches Ann's, and Mark summarizes, [...] "It's fun {{to pretend to be}} zoning board members." [...] Marlene suggests Leslie try sucking up to Jeanine in her speech, but it comes across awkwardly when Leslie claims to [...] "love" [...] Jeanine. When Leslie tries to approach her later, Jeanine suggests Leslie make an appointment with her secretary. Marlene says this means Jeanine is blowing them off, and tells Leslie to blackmail Jeanine with the knowledge that her husband has a DUI offense in Illinois. Leslie shares the advice with Ann, who says she believes it is unethical and wrong; offended, Leslie accuses Ann of pampering Andy. ("He's got three crutches, {{and one of them is}} you. And the other two are crutches.") Ann storms off.|$|E

[...] During the 2004 Republican National Convention {{acceptance}} speech, President George W. Bush recognized the high-poverty, mostly Hispanic school and McCollough’s efforts: “In northeast Georgia, Gainesville Elementary School is mostly Hispanic and 90% poor — {{and this year}} 90% of its students passed state tests in reading and math. The principal expresses the philosophy of his school this way: ‘We don't focus on what we can't do at this school; we focus on what we <b>can</b> <b>do.</b> We <b>do</b> <b>whatever</b> {{it takes to get}} kids across the finish line.’ This principal is challenging the soft bigotry of low expectations, and that is the spirit of our education reform, and the commitment of our country: No dejaremos a ningún niño atrás.” The New York Times declared “Gainesville Elementary School and its principal are for real.” ...|$|R
500|$|The {{album is}} {{licensed}} under a Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial Share Alike license, in effect allowing anyone to use or rework the material for any non-profit purpose, {{as long as}} credit is provided and the resulting work is released under a similar license. Reznor explained this move by saying [...] "It's a stance we're taking that we feel is appropriate with digital technology, and outdated copyright laws, and all the nonsense that's going on these days". Jim Guerinot, then manager of Nine Inch Nails, explained the unconventional release of the album as [...] " [...] a reaction to what doesn’t exist today. it’s more just like, 'Hey, in a vacuum I <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>whatever</b> I want to do.'" [...] The digital-release of the album reportedly required an extensive overhaul of the Nine Inch Nails website {{in order for the}} site to cope with the influx of traffic, online-payments, and customer service needs of releasing the album. These upgrades cost Reznor approximately $20,000 to implement. Despite these measures, upon the release of Ghosts the site crashed, and additional servers were necessary to handle the traffic.|$|E
500|$|John Glover characterizes Lionel as a {{businessman}} who is disappointed with his son. To Glover, Lionel is this [...] "rich and powerful businessman" [...] who sees his son as a [...] "wuss" [...] and [...] "fraidy-cat". It was important to Glover that Lionel appear as human as possible; Glover {{said he does not}} want to simply [...] "twirl [...] mustache". Glover described Lionel as a man who will do whatever he needs to do to get what he wants. He characterizes Lionel as an intelligent man who can read people easily. Lionel uses that ability to further his goals. The character can also get past people's defenses and manipulate them. Glover thinks that type of power would be great if it could be used to help someone other than Lionel. Lionel's character is also connoted by the color scheme that surrounds him; the use of cold blue tones helps to evoke the [...] "sinister" [...] nature of the character. Lionel is also often portrayed in front of a white or [...] "clinical blue" [...] background. Lionel's signature mane of hair is used to symbolize his power—by growing it out and refusing to style it, Lionel attempts to show he is so powerful that he <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>whatever</b> he wants without any backlash.|$|E

5000|$|... "Mmm Yeah" [...] is a dance-pop song which {{contains}} a [...] "swirling" [...] production, funk-influenced trumpets, a percussion-heavy four {{on the floor}} electropop beat, and influences of Chicago house, hip hop, and Latin music. The track heavily samples Lidell Townsell's 1992 single [...] "Nu Nu". Lyrically, the song speaks of being rejected by an attractive woman walking down a street: [...] "We <b>can</b> <b>do</b> whatever/ <b>Do</b> <b>whatever</b> we want/ When she walked past me I said 'hey, hey, hey' So {{tell me where you}} from where you want to go/ She walked past me like I ain't say a word".
