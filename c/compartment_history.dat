40|$|WesTrac Pty Ltd (WesTrac) {{is one of}} {{the largest}} Caterpillar ® dealers in the world that {{provides}} condition monitoring services to clients in the form of oil analysis and maintenance suggestions. This project uses diagnostic oil data to develop logistic regression (LR) models to classify oil samples taken from different machinery compartments into categories relating to the condition of the oil. Such classification is currently undertaken manually and as a result is potentially subject to interpretation bias and human error. Models developed to help screen ‘A samples ’ (those with no contamination) correctly classified 85 - 96 % of the samples tested. Multinomial LR models extend work done Ratnam (2011) by classifying the oil data into the four categories (A, B, C, X) currently used at WesTrac. An investigation is also made into the key factors that influence the oil sample classification and of most significance, the effect of previous <b>compartment</b> <b>history</b> on future classification is outlined 1...|$|E

30|$|High tibial {{osteotomy}} (HTO) {{has traditionally}} been used to treat varus gonarthrosis in younger, active patients. Varus malalignment {{increases the risk of}} progression of medial compartment osteoarthritis and an HTO can be performed to realign the mechanical axis of the lower limb towards the lateral compartment, thereby decreasing contact pressures in the medial compartment. Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) insufficiency may lead to post-traumatic arthritis due to altered joint loading and associated injuries to the menisci and articular cartilage. Understanding the importance of posterior tibial slope and its role in sagittal knee stability has {{led to the development of}} biplane osteotomies designed to flatten the posterior tibial slope in the ACL deficient knee. Altering the alignment in both the sagittal and coronal planes helps improve stability as well as alter the load in the medial <b>compartment.</b> Detailed <b>history,</b> physical exam and radiographic analysis guide treatment decisions in this high demand patient population. Lateral closing wedge (LCW) and medial opening wedge (MOW) HTOs have been performed and their potential advantages and disadvantages have been well described. Given the triangular shape of the proximal tibia, it is imperative that the surgeon pay close attention to the geometry of the osteotomy “gap” when performing MOW HTO to avoid inadvertently increasing the posterior tibial slope. Simultaneous ACL reconstruction may require technique modifications depending on the type of HTO and ACL graft chosen. With appropriate patient selection and good surgical technique, it is reasonable to expect patients to return to activities of daily living and recreational sports without debilitating pain or instability.|$|R

40|$|Sea lice are a {{persistent}} problem for farmed and wild salmonid populations. Control {{can be achieved}} {{through the use of}} veterinary medicines. A model was developed to describe the patterns of sea lice infection on salmon farms in Scotland and to predict the likely effect of various treatment strategies. This model takes into account development rates and mortality using <b>compartments</b> representing life <b>history</b> stages and external infection pressure. The national sea lice infection pattern was described using parameters representing stage survival, background infection levels and egg viability rates. The patterns observed across farms varied greatly and the model gave broad agreement to observed trends with different parameters being required in the model for sites using hydrogen peroxide and cypermethrin treatments. The parameter estimates suggest that the background infection pressure on sites where cypermethrin was administered was higher than for those using hydrogen peroxide. Both models had comparable magnitudes of sensitivity with survival from one stage to another being the most sensitive parameter, followed by feedback rates at which gravid females produce eggs, with background infection levels the least sensitive. The effect of different cypermethrin treatment strategies was assessed using the model. Increasing treatments in a production cycle gave more effective control. However, the model showed that timing of treatments is most important if sea lice are to be effectively controlled...|$|R
40|$|Membrane {{transporters}} (MTs) {{facilitate the}} movement of molecules between cellular <b>compartments.</b> The evolutionary <b>history</b> of these key components of eukaryote genomes remains unclear. Many photosynthetic microbial eukaryotes (e. g., diatoms, haptophytes, and dinoflagellates) appear to have undergone serial endosymbiosis and thereby recruited foreign genes through endosymbiotic/horizontal gene transfer (E/HGT). Here we used the diatoms Thalassiosira pseudonana and Phaeodactylum tricornutum as models to examine the evolutionary origin of MTs in this important group of marine primary producers. Using phylogenomics, we used 1, 014 diatom MTs as query against a broadly sampled protein sequence database that includes novel genome data from the mesophilic red algae Porphyridium cruentum and Calliarthron tuberculosum, and the stramenopile Ectocarpus siliculosus. Our conservative approach resulted in 879 maximum likelihood trees of which 399 genes show a non-lineal history between diatoms and other eukaryotes and prokaryotes (at the bootstrap value $ 70 %). Of the eukaryote-derived MTs, 172 (ca. 25 % of 697 examined phylogenies) have members of both red/green algae as sister groups, with 103 putatively arising from green algae, 19 from red algae, and 50 have an unresolved affiliation to red and/or green algae. We used topology tests to analyze the most convincing cases of non-lineal gene history in which red and/or green algae were nested within stramenopiles. This analysis showed that ca. 6 % of all trees (our most conservative estimate) support an algal origin of MTs in stramenopiles with the majority derived from green algae. Our findings demonstrate th...|$|R
40|$|AbstractCompartment {{fires are}} {{commonly}} {{discussed in the}} classical sense with the <b>compartment</b> fire growth <b>history</b> starting with the incipient phase leading into the growth phase that transition through flashover into the fully developed phase and ends in the decay phase. However, when a fire starts in a closed compartment where only ventilation is the leakage available, the fire can start to smolder and produce large quantities of CO and unburned hydrocarbons. These products of incomplete combustion accumulate in the compartment and create an extremely hazardous condition. If the conditions are right and a large vent becomes available, such as a fire fighter opening a door, a rapidly developing flame front spreads through the enclosure burning the available fuel that has mixed with the incoming air, culminating in a large fireball outside the opening. This catastrophic event is known to fire fighters as a backdraft and by definition requires a sudden change it the ventilation. Anecdotal evidence supports a different phenomenon in which a closed compartment suddenly erupts in flames breaking glass and even causing structural damage without a vent ever being open. This phenomenon is referred to here as a smoke explosion. Recent work has focused on improving our understanding of these poorly understood events and the conditions that precede them. A series of small scale experiments have been conducted burning a timber crib inside an enclosure with tightly controlled ventilation. Under certain fire conditions, the compartment will suddenly erupt, ejecting smoke and flames from the small openings in the compartment. This paper describes the experimental results from the smoke explosion research and compares the smoke explosion to the more familiar phenomena known as backdraft...|$|R
