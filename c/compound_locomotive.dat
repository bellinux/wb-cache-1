25|$|A <b>compound</b> <b>{{locomotive}}</b> is a {{steam locomotive}} which {{is powered by}} a compound engine, a type of steam engine where steam is expanded in two or more phases. Colloquially referred to as a compound engine, the locomotive is only one application of the compounding principle.|$|E
25|$|In 1889 Samuel M. Vauclain of the Baldwin Locomotive Works {{devised the}} Vauclain <b>compound</b> <b>locomotive.</b> This design used a double-expansion engine fitted {{into the space}} {{occupied}} by a conventional single-expansion engine on the locomotive, using a single piston valve with conventional gear to control both the high- and low-pressure cylinders. The high-pressure cylinder could be placed above or below the low-pressure cylinder, each had its own piston rod connected to a common crosshead, so that one connecting rod and crank was required for each pair of cylinders. Substantial fuel efficiencies were achieved, but maintenance difficulties doomed the type. Most were converted to conventional engines.|$|E

5000|$|Cross <b>compound</b> <b>locomotives</b> have a {{fundamental}} design issue, {{which is that}} if the HP cylinder is stopped [...] "on center", the locomotive cannot start. To resolve this, all practical cross <b>compound</b> <b>locomotives</b> have some form of starting valve, which allows admission of HP steam into the LP cylinder on starting. In some cases this is manually operated by the locomotive driver, while in other cases it is automatic; in the latter case the valve {{is often referred to as}} an [...] "intercepting valve". The primary difference between various forms of cross <b>compound</b> <b>locomotives</b> is in the design and operation of the intercepting valve.|$|R

25|$|Chapelon's aborted post-war {{locomotive}} replacement programme {{included a}} whole range of 3-cylinder Sauvage compounds. The only one to come into existence was 242A 1, a 4-8-4 prototype rebuilt in 1946 from an unsuccessful 4-8-2 3-cylinder simple. 242A 1 was probably the most important <b>compound</b> <b>locomotive</b> of all time, capable of developing a remarkable 5,300 cylinder horsepower (4,000kW) for an engine unit weighing just 145.6 metric tons. One of the most efficient steam locomotives ever built, coal consumption was just 850 g/hp (1.1 g/W) per hour and water consumption was 6.45 L/hp (8.6 mL/W) per hour at 3,000hp (2,200kW). A typical simple-expansion locomotive could consume approximately double these amounts to generate the same output.|$|E
25|$|NSB took {{delivery}} of five Class V steam locomotives, manufactured by Motala Verkstad and four lager tender Class XI locomotive built by Dübs and Company. The latter were mostly {{used for the}} express trains. The first <b>compound</b> <b>locomotive,</b> Class XIII, was taken into use in 1895. The next two were not compound: two Baldwin Locomotive Works locomotives were delivered in 1898. They remained in service until 1908, when they were transferred to the Røros Line. Two Class IX from Swiss Locomotive and Machine Works units were transferred to the Vestfold Line in 1897. Two more Class XIII were delivered in 1900. Two Class XXIIIa locomotives were delivered from Hamar Jernstøperi in 1907 and 1908, with a further ten Class XXIIId units delivered from Thune between 1913 and 1915. The line later received various other steam locomotives as narrow gauge railways were converted to standard gauge.|$|E
2500|$|The {{simplest}} {{form of the}} <b>compound</b> <b>locomotive</b> has two cylinders, a {{high-pressure cylinder}} on one side, and a low-pressure on the other side; the name reflects the steam flow from the HP to the LP across the locomotive. [...] Most early attempts at compound locomotives were variations on the cross compound design, some notable ones being that of Baxter (1870) and Hudson (1873). [...] Another was by Anatole Mallet who introduced in 1876 {{a series of small}} 2-cylinder compound 0-4-2 tank locomotives for the Bayonne-Anglet-Biarritz Railway. These were entirely successful and worked for many years.|$|E

2500|$|On the British North Eastern Railway there {{appeared}} in 1898 a prototype 4-4-0 <b>compound</b> <b>locomotive,</b> no. 1619 (NER Class 3CC) with this same layout {{to the design}} of Walter Mackersie Smith (this itself being rebuilt from an earlier Worsdell/Von Borries 2-cylinder compound prototype of 1893). This formed the basis for an initial batch of five Midland Railway 1000 Class locomotives designed by [...] Samuel W. Johnson for the Midland Railway. These were followed from 1905 onwards by 40 of an enlarged production version where all the Smith fittings were replaced by a simplified starting arrangement incorporated into the regulator; this {{to the design of}} Johnson's successor, Richard Deeley. The original Johnson locomotives were rebuilt as Deeley compounds from 1914 onwards and were superheated.|$|E
2500|$|For railway {{locomotive}} applications {{the main}} benefit sought from compounding is economy in fuel and water consumption plus high power/weight ratio due to temperature and pressure drop taking place {{over a longer}} cycle, this resulting in increased efficiency; additional perceived advantages include more even torque and in many cases, superior riding qualities with consequent less wear on the track. In situations where heavy grades and low axle loads were combined, the ordinary <b>compound</b> <b>locomotive</b> was often deemed {{to be the most}} viable solution. However, in the past, optimum performance demanded constant attention and expert handling, which usually made single-manning advisable, thus reducing a locomotive's availability. At the end of the steam age, this particular problem was being addressed by Andre Chapelon, and Livio Dante Porta also actively pursued this line of research. Successful design of a <b>compound</b> <b>locomotive</b> demands a firm grasp of thermo- and fluid dynamics; that such has frequently not been the case is why many productions in the past have been far from optimal. This is especially true of locomotives built {{in the early years of}} the 20th century. The problem not only affected compounds, but was dramatic in their case due to the long steam cycle which made them particularly sensitive to temperature-drop and condensation of the steam during its lengthy passage. In rebuilding older locomotives from 1929 onwards, Chapelon was able to inexpensively obtain what seemed almost [...] "magical" [...] improvements in power and economy by improving flow through the steam circuit, at the same time putting in a larger superheater in order to increase the initial steam temperature so that cooling took longer. [...] Subsequently, in order to maintain a more constant temperature throughout the cycle, Chapelon successfully applied re-superheating between HP and LP stages plus steam-jacketed cylinders to a [...] "test-bed" [...] freight locomotive, 160 A1 (tested 1948-51). Resuperheating was also a feature of L.D. [...] Porta's prototype 4-8-0 rebuild: 'Presidente Peron'/'Argentina' (tested around the same time in Argentina from 1949). Proponents of simple expansion argue that use of early cut-off in the cylinder thus expanding small quantities of steam at each piston stroke obviates the need for the complication and initial expense of compounding and indeed multi-cylinder single expansion – this is an ongoing debate.|$|E
