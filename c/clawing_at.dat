25|$|Jealous {{servants}} of Ketil who {{look down on}} slaves, destroy Thorfinn's and Einar's wheat crops. When Thorfinn and Einar confront the jealous servants, they both get into a fight with them where Thorfinn is knocked out and has a gruesome vision. In his dreams, many corpses are seen fighting and <b>clawing</b> <b>at</b> Thorfinn, {{as though they are}} trying to drag him down with them into eternal battle. Thors appears to his son and reveals to Thorfinn that he never wanted him to become a Viking warrior. Thorfinn assumes that this is a nightmarish version of Valhalla, where dead Vikings fight a never ending battle. Askeladd then appears to Thorfinn and reveals that it is not Valhalla nor is it a peaceful afterlife: these are all of the people that Thorfinn has slain. Askeladd further reveals that it is not too late to redeem himself so he will not end up there just like him. He tells Thorfinn to become a real warrior just like his father. Thorfinn's vision makes him regret the sins he has done and weeps for those he has slain while contemplating the lives of those he has killed. He resigns to give up and allow the mass of corpses to pull him down but Askeladd encourages him to continue his life. Thorfinn vows to never hurt anyone again and climbs out of the pile and wakes up next to Einar, who declares that they won the fight. Thorfinn declares that he will never hurt anyone again and the duo contemplates their troubles for the fight that just occurred. Luckily, Ketil found evidence of the jealous servants’ wrongdoing and told them to never bother Thorfinn and Einar again.|$|E

500|$|A {{writer from}} the website E! Online felt {{that in the}} video, Beyoncé [...] "most {{certainly}} comes into her own". Puja Patel of Spin regarded it as [...] "practically a tribute to her curves". An editor for CTV News noted how the singer was seen hovering over a bed in an exorcist style. Kathy Iandoli from Vice remarked the same particular scenes for showing Beyoncé living in a matrix. Billie Cohen from the magazine Condé Nast Traveler noted that [...] "maybe {{one of the most}} memorable image" [...] from the visual album was when the singer was seen falling on a king-size bed in [...] "Rocket". In what she perceived to be the best dance moves on the album, Lindsey Weber of Vulture listed the same scene. Considering it one of the most intimate videos on the entire record, Michael Zelenko from The Fader noted, [...] "In a collection full of erotic videos, 'Rocket,' with its heaving chests, bare thighs, bubble baths, and nails <b>clawing</b> <b>at</b> sheets, manages to stand apart as the steamiest of the bunch." [...] Jody Rosen of The New York Times opined that the video featured mostly slow-motion pictures of [...] "billowing silk sheets and water droplets tumbling onto Beyoncé's bare midriff". Neil McCormik from The Daily Telegraph noted the lack of subtlety during the scenes showing a power drill and Beyoncé [...] "shuddering with pleasure". In another review, he labeled the clip as [...] "very naughty".|$|E

However, at abundant food sources (i.e. spawning salmon or garbage dumps) black bears may congregate and dominance hierarchies form, with the largest, most powerful males dominating the most fruitful feeding spots. They mark their territories by rubbing their bodies against trees and <b>clawing</b> <b>at</b> the bark.

A [...] "disease" [...] on society, they are {{themselves}} afflicted with different types of afflictions: horrible diseases, stench, thirst, filth, darkness, and screaming. Some lie prostrate while others run hungering through the pit, tearing others to pieces. Shortly before their arrival in this pit, Virgil indicates that it is approximately noon of Holy Saturday, and he and Dante discuss one of Dante's kinsmen (Geri de Bello) among the Sowers of Discord in the previous ditch. The first category of falsifiers Dante encounters are the Alchemists (Falsifiers of Things). He speaks with two spirits viciously scrubbing and <b>clawing</b> <b>at</b> their leprous scabs: Griffolino d'Arezzo (an alchemist who extracted money from the foolish Alberto da Siena {{on the promise of}} teaching him to fly; Alberto's reputed father the Bishop of Siena had Griffolino burned at the stake) and Capocchio (burned at the stake at Siena in 1293 for practicing alchemy).|$|E
