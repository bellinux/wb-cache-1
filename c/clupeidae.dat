25|$|The type genus of the herring family <b>Clupeidae</b> is Clupea. Clupea {{contains}} three species: the Atlantic herring (the type species) {{found in}} the north Atlantic, the Pacific herring {{found in the}} north Pacific, and the Araucanian herring found {{off the coast of}} Chile. Subspecific divisions have been suggested for both the Atlantic and Pacific herrings, but their biological basis remains unclear.|$|E
40|$|Three Species of white-baits (Genus: Anchoviella) were {{described}} by Day (1878 - 89) from Indian waters under the generic name Engraulis Cuvier, 1817; viz., E. commersonianus (Lacepede, 1803), E. indicus (van Hasselt, 1823), and E. tri (Bleeker, 1852). Weber and de Beaufort (1913) recognised five species from the Indo-Australian archipelago, but used the generic name Stolephorus Lacepede, 1803. Important {{contributions to the}} knowledge of the systematics of these fishes have been made by Hardenberg (1933 and 1934) and by Fowler (1941). It was Fowler (1911) who emended Stolephorus Lacepede (strictly belonging to subfamily Dussumieriini, <b>Clupeidas)</b> and created the new genus Anchoviella (Engraulidae) with Engraulis perfasciatus Poey, orthotypic as the genotype...|$|R
40|$|Ova-diameter {{studies have}} become an {{integral}} part of fishery biological research. It is well known that in most fishes there is a marked seasonal periodicity in egg production. Clark (1934) and Hickling and Rutenberg (1936) have shown that it is possible to determine the time of spawning and the spawning periodicity of fishes by ova-diameter frequency studies. Karandikar and Palekar (1950, 1952 and 1953), Prabhu (1956), Dharmamba (1959) and Karekar and Bal, (i 960) among others have shown that this method is applicable in regard to the fishes they studied. This account deals with the determination of the time and periodicity of spawning of four common food fishes of the South Canara coast viz., Nematalosa nasus, Anodontostoma chacunda (Family <b>Clupeida.</b> e); Otolitkus argenteus (Family Sciaenidae), and Saurida tumbil (Family Scopelidae), based on the frequency distribution of the diameter of the intraovarian eggs...|$|R

25|$|Forage fish, {{also called}} prey fish or bait fish, are small pelagic fish which are preyed on by larger predators for food. Predators include other larger fish, seabirds and marine mammals. Typical ocean forage fish feed {{near the base}} of the food chain on plankton, often by filter feeding. They include {{particularly}} fishes of the family <b>Clupeidae</b> (herrings, sardines, shad, hilsa, menhaden, anchovies and sprats), but also other small fish, including halfbeaks, silversides, smelt such as capelin, and the goldband fusiliers pictured on the right.|$|E
25|$|The {{species of}} Clupea {{belong to the}} larger family <b>Clupeidae</b> (herrings, shads, sardines, menhadens), which {{comprises}} some 200 species that share similar features. These silvery-coloured fish have a single dorsal fin, which is soft, without spines. They have no lateral line and have a protruding lower jaw. Their size varies between subspecies: the Baltic herring (Clupea harengus membras) is small, 14 to 18cm; the proper Atlantic herring (C. h. harengus) can grow to about 46cm (18in) and weigh up 700 g (1.5lb); and Pacific herring grow to about 38cm (15in).|$|E
25|$|Most filter-feeding {{pelagic fish}} found in coastal waters are small, silvery forage fish. Forage fish include fishes {{of the family}} <b>Clupeidae</b> (herrings, shad, {{sardines}} and pilchards, hilsa, menhaden and sprats), as well as anchovies, capelin and halfbeaks. They use schooling strategies to avoid predators, and different schools of forage fish often associate {{with each other in}} open coastal waters. Forage fish feed near the base of the food chain on plankton and fry (recently hatched fish), often by filter feeding. In turn, they are preyed on by larger predatory fish, seabirds and marine mammals.|$|E
25|$|Most of the {{material}} acquired from the National Marine Fisheries Service Tropical Atlantic Biological (TABL) collection consists of western Atlantic fishes from nearshore shallows to moderate depths, with the families Argentinidae, Atherinidae, Balistidae, Batrachoididae, Belonidae, Bothidae, Branchiostomatidae, Caproidae, Carangidae, <b>Clupeidae,</b> Congridae, Cynoglossidae, Dasyatidae, Engraulididae, Exocoetidae, Fundulidae, Gadidae, Gerreidae, Haemulidae, Hemiramphidae, Lutjanidae, Macrouridae, Monacanthidae, Mugilidae, Ogcocephalidae, Ophichthidae, Ophidiidae, Paralichthyidae, Peristediidae, Priacanthidae, Rajiidae, Sciaenidae, Scombridae, Serranidae, Scorpaenidae, Scyliorhinidae, Soleidae, Sparidae, Sphyraenidae, Stromateidae, Squalidae, Syngnathidae, Synodontidae, Tetraodontidae, and Triglidae most common. These collections have been substantially augmented by the field activities of museum personnel and donations made over the last 20 years. Eastern Atlantic collections from the Gulf of Guinea are available in some abundance. The western Atlantic collections acquired from the National Marine Fisheries Service Pascagoula laboratory and University of Miami are generally from greater depths and represent some of the museum's most valuable resources. Deepwater anguilliform, salmoniform, stomiiform, aulopiform, myctophiform, and ophidiiform families are particularly well represented. For certain families, i.e. searsiidae, alepocephalidae, these collections may be among the best North American holdings from the western Atlantic region.|$|E
2500|$|A {{number of}} {{different}} species, most belonging to the family <b>Clupeidae,</b> are {{commonly referred to as}} herrings. The origins of the term [...] "herring" [...] is somewhat unclear, though it may derive from the Old High German heri meaning a [...] "host, multitude", in reference to the large schools they form.|$|E
2500|$|There are {{distinct}} {{differences between the}} different sections of the river basin, but Cyprinidae is the most diverse throughout. In the upper section (roughly equalling the basin parts in Uttarakhand) more than 50 species have been recorded and Cyprinidae alone accounts for almost 80% those, followed by Balitoridae (about 15.6%) and Sisoridae (about 12.2%). Sections of the Ganges basin at altitudes above [...] above sea level are generally without fish. Typical genera approaching this altitude are Schizothorax, Tor, Barilius, Nemacheilus and Glyptothorax. About 100 species have been recorded from the middle section of the basin (roughly equalling the sections in Uttar Pradesh and parts of Bihar) and more than 55% of these are in family Cyprinidae, followed by Schilbeidae (about 10.6%) and <b>Clupeidae</b> (about 8.6%). The lower section (roughly equalling the basin in parts of Bihar and West Bengal) includes major floodplains and is home to almost 100 species. About 46% of these are in the family Cyprinidae, followed by Schilbeidae (about 11.4%) and Bagridae (about 9%).|$|E
2500|$|The {{crevalle jack}} is a {{powerful}} predatory fish which predominantly takes other small fishes as prey at all stages of its life, with various invertebrates generally being of secondary importance to its diet. Several studies conducted on the species' diet over its range have found other aspects of its diet vary widely, including the specific types of prey the species takes and the change in diet with age. The most detailed of these studies was conducted in the Southern USA, which showed the species diet comprised between 74% and 94% [...] fish. The remainder of the diet was various prawns, shrimps, crabs, molluscs and stomatopods. The types of fish taken varied throughout the range, with members of <b>Clupeidae,</b> Sparidae, Carangidae and Trichiuridae all taken in variable amounts, usually with members of one family dominating the local diet. The percentage of various invertebrates also was highly variable, with penaeid shrimps, portunid crabs, stomatopods and squid being of importance to different populations. The study also indicated young crevalle jack predominantly take clupeids, adding sparids and later carangids to their diets as they grow larger. The larger individuals also took much higher amounts of invertebrates, and also small quantities of seagrass, indicating larger fish are more opportunistic. This general change in diet with age also seems spatially variable, with young crevalle jack in both Maryland and Puerto Rico consuming almost exclusively crustaceans, including shrimps, crabs (and juvenile tarpon) in Maryland and harpacticoid copepods in Puerto Rico before moving to fish-dominated diets later in life. Research in Ghana shows a pattern somewhat intermediate to the previous two locations; adults take larger fish, predominantly Engraulis guineensis and Sardinella eba, while juvenile fish take smaller fishes such as Epiplatys sexfasciatus or juvenile caridian and penaeid shrimps.|$|E
