50|$|<b>Cytomegalovirus</b> <b>retinitis,</b> {{also known}} as CMV retinitis, is an {{inflammation}} of the retina of the eye {{that can lead to}} blindness. Caused by human cytomegalovirus, it occurs predominantly in people whose immune system has been compromised, 15-40% of those infected with AIDS. There are different types of retinitis, such as retinitis pigmentosa (causes tunnel vision).|$|E
5000|$|Retinitis may {{be caused}} by several {{infectious}} agents, including toxoplasmosis, cytomegalovirus and candida. [...] <b>Cytomegalovirus</b> <b>retinitis</b> is an important cause of blindness in AIDS patients, and is {{the most common cause of}} vision loss in AIDS patients. Candida may spread to the retina from the bloodstream, which usually leads to the production of several abscesses in the retina.|$|E

5000|$|The company's first marketed {{drug was}} {{fomivirsen}} (Vitravene) {{which was used}} in the treatment of <b>cytomegalovirus</b> <b>retinitis</b> (CMV) in immunocompromised patients, including those with AIDS. [...] It was discovered at the NIH and was licensed and initially developed by Isis, which subsequently licensed it to Novartis. It was approved by the FDA for CMV in Aug 1998, and was the first antisense drug that was approved. [...] Novartis withdrew the marketing authorization in the EU in 2002 and in the US in 2006. [...] The drug was withdrawn because while there was a high unmet need for drugs to treat CMV when the drug was initially discovered and developed due to the CMV arising in people with AIDS, the development of HAART dramatically reduced the number of cases of CMV.|$|E
50|$|Its only {{indication}} {{that has received}} regulatory approval worldwide is <b>cytomegalovirus</b> <b>retinitis.</b> Cidofovir has also shown efficacy {{in the treatment of}} aciclovir-resistant HSV infections. Cidofovir has also been investigated as a treatment for progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy with successful case reports of its use. Despite this, the drug failed to demonstrate any efficacy in controlled studies. Cidofovir might have anti-smallpox efficacy and might be used on a limited basis {{in the event of a}} bioterror incident involving smallpox cases. Brincidofovir, a cidofovir derivative with much higher activity against smallpox that can be taken orally has been developed. It has inhibitory effects on varicella-zoster virus replication in vitro although no clinical trials have been done to date, likely due to the abundance of safer alternatives such as aciclovir. Cidofovir shows anti-BK virus activity in a subgroup of transplant recipients. Cidofovir is being investigated as a complementary intralesional therapy against papillomatosis caused by HPV.|$|E

5000|$|The first {{reference}} to HIV/AIDS is a “KS lesion” which is found on page 8. A “KS legion” is a Kaposi's sarcoma lesion, which form on various places {{of a person}} in a later stage of HIV/AIDS. The lesions are most visible and recognizable on skin, and therefore give away the HIV/AIDS status of the person who has them. Those who read the book and have no former experience with HIV/AIDS may not understand the terms. In this way of writing, Alammedine has a select audience that he writes to. Other HIV/AIDS vocabulary used throughout the novel are CMV retinitis (<b>Cytomegalovirus</b> <b>retinitis),</b> in which the infected person loses his or her eyesight. One of the narrators refers to this condition when talking of his friend who was an artist who stopped painting due to CMV retinitis. In this reference he sort of describes the condition by saying that his friend, “couldn’t see worth shit due to CMV retinitis” (10).

50|$|Valganciclovir is {{commonly}} used for treatment of <b>cytomegalovirus</b> (CMV) <b>retinitis</b> (eye infection may cause blindness) in people who have acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).

Overall, valganciclovir works by preventing the spread of CMV disease or slowing the growth of CMV.|$|R
