25|$|The {{programme}} Scoop on TVB, {{the dominant}} terrestrial television channel in Hong Kong, on 1 April drew criticism. The strikers {{objected to the}} programme, saying it was biased, misleading and did not give enough airtime to the strikers. The <b>Communications</b> <b>Authority</b> had received 1,800 complaints within four days and TVB said it had received 47 complaints from the audience, and the broadcaster had no particular stance.|$|E
500|$|Four days later, the DA {{submitted}} a complaint to the Independent <b>Communications</b> <b>Authority</b> of South Africa (ICASA) about censorship {{by the public}} broadcaster after the SABC informed the DA it would not continue broadcasting a DA television advert titled [...] "ANC Ayisafani", meaning [...] "the ANC's not the same", and five DA radio adverts aired on 8 and 9 April 2014. According to the DA's Mmusi Maimane, who appears in the television advert, the SABC banned all DA adverts from 11 public radio stations {{as well as the}} television advert. ICASA announced that it would hold public hearings on the matter on Thursday the 17th, 6 days after the DA lodged their complaint. Following the DA's announcement that it would submit an urgent application to the South Gauteng High Court requesting a ruling on the adverts before the long Easter weekend commencing Good Friday, the day after ICASA's proposed public hearing date, the ICASA hearings commenced 2 days earlier than originally scheduled. On the day after the hearing, the ban was lifted temporarily as the SABC had failed to provide reasons for the ban during the ICASA hearings and requested more time to prepare a response. The DA also objected to the SABC not allowing the national official opposition party to participate in a televised election debate on land reform on SABCin the first 2 weeks of April. On 25 April, ICASA upheld the SABC's ban on the television advert finding that it contravened ICASA's regulations on party election broadcasts. ICASA ordered that a photograph taken by The Citizen photographer Alaister Russell of a police officer firing rubber bullets at unarmed residents during the March 2014 Bekkersdal protest be removed from the advert as [...] "the police should not be seen {{as a threat to the}} community". In the advert, Maimane says [...] "We've seen a police force killing our own people" [...] while the photograph is shown on the screen. The South African Police Service had earlier {{submitted a}} complaint to ICASA that this footage would incite violence against police officers.On 15 April 2014, a protest campaign against corruption with the slogan [...] "Vukani! Sidikwe! (Wake up! We are Fed up!) Vote No", supported by over 100 ANC veterans, was launched by former government ministers Ronnie Kasrils and Nozizwe Madlala-Routledge. The IEC has requested a legal opinion on whether the campaign contravenes the Electoral Act. The campaign urges ANC supporters to either spoil their votes or vote for a smaller party. Archbishop Emeritus Desmond Tutu welcomed the campaign, and human rights activist and cleric Barney Pityana describes it as [...] "a campaign to bring rationality, order, morality and decency back into our electoral system" [...] in a Mail & Guardian opinion piece.|$|E
