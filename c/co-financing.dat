25|$|In 1948, voters {{rejected}} the {{proposal for a}} municipal loan to finance the change, but soon the situation was changed with the Housing Act of 1949 and Missouri state laws that provided <b>co-financing</b> of public housing projects.

Specifically, St. Louis Land Clearance and Redevelopment Authority was authorized to acquire and demolish the slums of the inner ring and then sell the land at reduced prices to private developers, fostering middle-class return and business growth. Another agency, St. Louis Housing Authority, had to clear land to construct public housing for the former slum dwellers.|$|E
