5|$|In 2006, <b>Cisco</b> Systems and Apple {{negotiated}} over allowing Apple {{rights to}} use Cisco's Linksys iPhone trademark, but the negotiations stalled when <b>Cisco</b> {{pushed for the}} two products to be interoperable. Following the public unveiling of the Apple iPhone at the 2007 Macworld Expo, <b>Cisco</b> {{filed a lawsuit against}} Apple in January 2007, alleging Apple's iPhone name infringed on Cisco's iPhone trademark. <b>Cisco</b> alleged that Apple created a front company subsequent to their negotiations to try to acquire the rights another way, while Apple countered {{that there would be no}} likelihood of confusion between the two products, because Apple's iPhone product was the first cell phone with such a name, while Cisco's iPhone was a VoIP phone. Bloomberg reported Cisco's iPhone as a product marketed for less than $100 and part of the Linksys home routers, enabling internet-based calls through Skype and Yahoo! Messenger, and contrasted it with Apple's iPhone as a mobile phone which sold for around $600. In February 2007, <b>Cisco</b> and Apple announced an agreement under which both companies would be allowed to use the iPhone name worldwide.|$|E

It had ten times the throughput of comparable contemporary <b>Cisco</b> products. The M40 {{was followed by the}} smaller M20 router in December 1999 and the M160 in March 2000.|$|E

5|$|By 2003, Juniper had diversified {{into three}} major router applications: core routers, edge routers and routers for mobile traffic. Juniper's first major {{diversification}} from core routers {{was when it}} entered the market for edge routers, by acquiring the e-series product family (originally known as ERX) through the purchase of Unisphere in 2000. By 2002, both <b>Cisco</b> and Juniper had increased their focus on edge routers, because many ISPs had built up abundant bandwidth at the core. Several improvements to Juniper's software and its broadband aggregation features were released in late 2003. At this time, Juniper had the largest market-share (52%) of the broadband aggregation market. In 2003, Juniper entered the market for cable-modem termination systems with the G-series product family after the acquisition of Pacific Broadband. The product family was discontinued later that year.|$|E
