5|$|This act {{introduced}} the 11+ examination {{to determine if}} a <b>child</b> <b>should</b> be eligible for a grammar school, secondary modern or technical college, under the Tripartite System, but has since been phased out across the majority of the United Kingdom, with just several boroughs in England and Northern Ireland still using it. League tables published in March 2007 showed grammar schools throughout the country were outperforming comprehensive schools; data published ten years later in 2017 suggested a similar clear division between student attainment in grammar schools compared to comprehensive schools.|$|E
5|$|During the 1840s, {{students}} in Philadelphia schools began {{the day with}} reading the Protestant version of the Bible. On November 10, 1842, Philadelphia's Roman Catholic Bishop, Francis Kenrick, {{wrote a letter to}} the Board of Controllers of public schools, asking that Catholic children be allowed to read the Douay version of the Bible, used by Roman Catholics. He also asked that they be excused from other religious teaching while at school. As a result, the Board of Controllers ordered that no <b>child</b> <b>should</b> be forced to participate in religious activities and stated that children were allowed to read whichever version of the Bible their parents wished. Nativists further inflamed hostile feelings towards Catholics by reportedly twisting Kenrick's requests to the Board of Controllers as an attack against the Bible used in Protestant devotionals.|$|E

25|$|As Shadow Secretary of State for Children, Schools and Families, Gove {{advocated}} {{the introduction of}} a Swedish-style voucher system, whereby parents can choose where their <b>child</b> <b>should</b> be educated, with the state paying what they would have cost in a state-school. He has also advocated Swedish-style free schools, to be managed by parents and funded by the State, with the possibility that such schools may be allowed to be run on a for-profit model.|$|E
25|$|For the {{traditional}} observance of the day, school children form processions through the hallways {{of the school}} building carrying candles, and hand out lussekatt buns. While rarely observed at home, parents often take time off work to watch these school processions in the morning, and if their <b>child</b> <b>should</b> be chosen Lucia it is considered a great honor. Later on in the day, the procession usually visits local retirement homes, hospitals, and nursing homes.|$|E

Margaret was born at Bletsoe Castle, Bedfordshire, on 31 May 1441 or 1443. The day and month are not disputed, as she required Westminster Abbey to celebrate her birthday on 31 May. The year of her birth is more uncertain. William Dugdale, the 17th-century antiquary, suggested {{that she may have}} been born in 1441, based on evidence of inquisitions post mortem taken after the death of her father. Dugdale has been followed by a number of Margaret's biographers; however, {{it is more likely that}} she was born in 1443, as in May 1443 her father had negotiated with the king concerning the wardship of his unborn <b>child</b> <b>should</b> he die on campaign.|$|E
500|$|The film {{received}} mixed reviews, {{but also}} criticism for {{several aspects of}} the production. The Morning Telegraph stated, [...] "The photography {{at the beginning of}} the film is poor. It seems queer that the <b>child</b> <b>should</b> be able to escape from the orphan asylum in such an easy manner and that no search be made by the institution. It seemed very theatrical and hardly possible that the <b>child</b> <b>should</b> make the first stop at the house of the father's intended. Why did not the producer have the child make a few more stops or have something happen to her instead of making the first stop at the woman's house?" [...] The Moving Picture World spared little coverage of the actual film in its review, noting that the emotional story might be a plausible. The New York Dramatic Mirror gave a detailed review that found the acting favorable, but found the plot and its resolution to be fantastical by stating, [...] "The manifest absurdity of this plot lies in the adoption. No girl just betrothed would ever adopt a runaway orphan." ...|$|E

500|$|Assessing the child's {{safety is}} an {{essential}} first step that determines whether future intervention can {{take place in the}} family unit or whether the <b>child</b> <b>should</b> be removed to a safe situation. Interventions may include psychosocial support services for the family unit (including financial or domestic aid, housing and social work support), psychotherapeutic interventions (including treating parents for mental illness, family therapy, individual therapy), education (including training in basic parenting skills and child development), and monitoring of the child's safety within the family environment ...|$|E
500|$|... "Passive resistance" [...] greatly {{slowed the}} pace of school {{desegregation}} in Virginia. Legislation enacted by the Assembly placed the burden on often-poor African American parents to [...] "prove" [...] that their <b>child</b> <b>should</b> be enrolled in an all-white school. (For example, a black family had {{to prove that the}} all-white school was physically closer than the all-black school their child was enrolled in. [...] An actual, physical measurement had to be submitted.) By the time Almond left office in 1962, only 1 percent of Virginia's schools had integrated. By 1964, it had risen to just 5 percent.|$|E

[...] In regard to public education, Grant endorsed that every <b>child</b> <b>should</b> receive [...] "the opportunity of a good common school education, unmixed with sectarian, pagan, or atheist tenets.

500|$|The {{replacement}} cost method {{also has its}} critics. What types of jobs should be used as substitutes? For example, should childcare activities [...] "be calculated using the wages of daycare workers or child psychiatrists?" [...] This relates {{to the problem of}} depressed wages in female-dominated industries, and whether using such jobs as an equivalent leads to the undervaluing of unpaid work. [...] Some have argued that education levels ought to be comparable, for example, [...] "the value of time that a college-educated parent spends reading aloud to a <b>child</b> <b>should</b> be ascertained by asking how much it would cost to hire a college-educated worker to do the same, not by an average housekeeper's wage." ...|$|E
500|$|Bowlby drew {{together}} such {{empirical evidence}} as {{existed at the}} time from across Europe and the US, including Spitz (1946) and Goldfarb (1943, 1945). His main conclusions, that [...] "the infant and young <b>child</b> <b>should</b> experience a warm, intimate, and continuous relationship with his mother (or permanent mother substitute) in which both find satisfaction and enjoyment" [...] and that {{not to do so}} might have significant and irreversible mental health consequences, were both controversial and influential. The monograph was published in 14 different languages and sold over 400,000 copies in the English version alone. Bowlby's work went beyond the suggestions of Otto Rank and Ian Suttie that mothering care was essential for development, and focused on the potential outcomes for children deprived of such care.|$|E
500|$|In {{the early}} twentieth century, DeLee {{observed}} that obstetric complications and deaths were so common that he [...] "often wondered whether nature did not intend women should be used up {{in the process of}} reproduction, in a manner analogous to that of the salmon, which dies after spawning. Perhaps laceration, prolapse and all the evils are, in fact, natural to labor and in fact normal... If you adopt this view, I have no ground to stand on, but, if you believe that a woman after delivery should be as healthy, as well as anatomically perfect as she was before, and that the <b>child</b> <b>should</b> be undamaged, then you will have to agree with me that labor is pathogenic, because experience has proved such ideal results exceedingly rare." ...|$|E
