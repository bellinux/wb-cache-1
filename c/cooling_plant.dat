25|$|In postwar Aberdeen (1964) a {{large-scale}} (>400 cases) outbreak of typhoid occurred, caused by contaminated corned beef {{which had been}} imported from Argentina. The corned beef was placed in cans and because the <b>cooling</b> <b>plant</b> had failed, cold river water from the Plate estuary was used to cool the cans. One of the cans had a defect and the meat inside was contaminated. This meat was then sliced using a meat slicer in a shop in Aberdeen, {{and a lack of}} cleaning the machinery led to spreading the contamination to other meats cut in the slicer. These meats were then eaten by the people of Aberdeen who then became ill.|$|E
500|$|The Olympic Ice Stadium (Stadio Olimpico Del Ghiaccio) [...] was {{intended}} to be {{the focal point of the}} Games. It was built on the banks of the Boite river just north of Cortina. After new roads and a bridge had been constructed, the stadium was an eight-minute walk from the center of town. The stadium was built to accommodate 6,000–7,000 people. Due to space limitations the grandstands were constructed vertically, with tiers built directly on top of each other. There were two artificial ice rinks of , with a total ice surface of [...] A special <b>cooling</b> <b>plant</b> was built under the stadium, which froze the ice through the evaporation of ammonia. The construction cost totaled ITL 1.3billion (US$2.1million in 1956), making it the most expensive venue of these Games. The stadium was used for the opening and closing ceremonies, all of the figure skating competitions and select ice hockey events. After the Games, the organising committee made the Ice Stadium a gift to the city of Cortina. It was used as an ice skating rink in the winter and an outdoor gymnasium for judo and gymnastics in the summer.|$|E
