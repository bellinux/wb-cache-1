Indexes usually have high contention, and database performance is quite sensitive to the index management scheme. This paper examinesthe effects of two index caching schemes, one centralized and the other distributed, for index page management in a page server OODB. In the centralized scheme, index pages {{are not allowed to}} be cached at <b>client</b> <b>sites</b> and are managed by the server. The distributed index management scheme supports inter-transaction caching of index pages at <b>client</b> <b>sites,</b> and enforces a distributed index consistency control protocol similar to that of data pages. We study via simulation the performance of these two index management schemes under several different workloads and contention profiles, and identify scenarios where each of th [...] ...|$|R

40|$|Recent work on {{client-server}} data-shipping OODBs {{has demonstrated}} {{the usefulness of}} local data caching at <b>client</b> <b>sites.</b> However, none of the studies has investigated index-related performance issues in particular. References to index pages arise from associative queries and from updates on indexed attributes, often making indexes the most heavily used hot spots in a database. System performance is therefore quite sensitive to the index management scheme. This paper examines the e ects of index caching, and investigates two schemes, one centralized and the other distributed, for index page management inapage server OODB. In the centralized scheme, index pages {{are not allowed to}} be cached at <b>client</b> <b>sites</b> � thus, communication with the central server is required for all index-based queries and index updates. The distributed index managementscheme supports inter-transaction caching of index pages at <b>client</b> <b>sites,</b> and enforces a distributed index consistency control protocol similar to that of data pages. We study via simulation the performance of these two index managementschemes under several di erent workloads and contention pro les, and identify scenarios where each ofthetwoschemes performs better than the other. ...|$|R

50|$|Algolia {{claims a}} number of {{advantages}} for their approach, including speed of response from searching a single site rather than the entire web. Moreover, as Algolia's search can be tailored to the <b>client</b> <b>site,</b> its known structure and its metadata facets, the search offered can be smarter and more site-specific than a generalised web text search. This improves the relevance of search results as searching may take the semantics of site content into account. A web site selling both puppies and dog clutches could avoid the search confusions and homonymy that bedevil the simple text-based search approaches.|$|E

While traditional usability techniques are often quite powerful in providing information on clicking and scrolling patterns, eye tracking offers the ability to analyze user interaction between the clicks and how much time a user spends between clicks. This provides valuable insight into which features are the most eye-catching, which features cause confusion and which ones are ignored altogether. Specifically, eye tracking can be used to assess search efficiency, branding, online advertisements, navigation usability, overall design and many other site components. Analyses may target a prototype or competitor site in addition to the main <b>client</b> <b>site.</b>|$|E

Organizations of all sizes {{are said to be}} at risk of DDoS attacks, because the newer application-level attacks are more targeted than classic DDoS botnet attacks and don’t need as many resources to deploy. The cloud-based DDoS mitigation approach used by Prolexic employs technology to redirect traffic to the company’s DDoS mitigation service, scrub the traffic, and send only legitimate traffic to the <b>client</b> <b>site.</b> This attack mitigation approach is said to be lower-cost than the traditional approach of a company maintaining its own network firewall, making DDoS attack prevention an option for most firms doing business on the web.|$|E
50|$|The {{origin of}} the term {{freelance}} has now been widely accepted as emerging from the historical novel, Ivanhoe, written by the Scottish novelist, playwright and poet, Sir Walter Scott in 1820. In this novel, Scott used the term freelance as two separate words “free” and “lance” {{and used it to}} refer to a mercenary who was willing to wield his lance or weapon to fight for the highest bidder. “I offered Richard the service of my Free Lances, and he refused them—I will lead them to Hull, seize on shipping, and embark for Flanders; thanks to the bustling times, a man of action will always find employment.” In this first ever reference, freelance is used to suggest an individual who offered skills in exchange for monetary compensation. The gist of the term has survived up to the modern times but today freelancing can be used to define a broad range of ways in which professionals work independently. Some people work on long term contracts, doing a full week at a single <b>client</b> <b>site</b> for several months until the contract is finished or renewed. Others work with several clients simultaneously on a series of fast turnaround projects. Freelancers are also known by different designations like independent contractor, consultant, independent professional, portfolio worker etc.|$|E

The protocol uses two different types of checkpoints to adapt to the current network characteristics, and to trade off performance with recovery time. 1 Introduction Mobile computing enables users to access and exchange information while they travel, roam in their home environment, or work at a <b>client's</b> <b>site.</b> Currently, mobile computing can only be used in restricted contexts; however, the growing investment by industr [...] ...|$|R

40|$|In {{this major}} report, we present {{the design and}} {{implementation}} of the Corba Version of the Concordia Parallel Programming Environment (CPPE), a client-server-based simulator for parallel programming environment. The purpose of the client/server version is to provide services and a rich set of graphical user interfaces for remote clients. The challenge in the design of client/server version is to reuse the existing C/C++ code. To solve the problem, we use Corba's delegation technique to wrap the existing C/C++ application into a standard Corba object, and then we create an IDL interface for it. From the IDL interface specification, we create a Java standalone application wrapped in Corba objects that runs at <b>client</b> <b>site</b> and communicates with the server. We design and implement <b>client</b> <b>site</b> GUIs for the application in Java/Swing. This Corba Version of CPPE is very portable since the <b>client</b> <b>site</b> application can be installed and run in any platform. The server supports multiple users...|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn recent years, network {{streaming}} {{becomes a}} highly popular research topic {{in computer science}} {{due to the fact}} that a large proportion of network traffic is occupied by multimedia streaming. In this paper we present novel methodologies for enhancing the streaming capabilities of Java RMI. Our streaming support for Java RMI includes the pushing mechanism, which allows the servers to push data in a streaming fashion to the <b>client</b> <b>site,</b> and the aggregation mechanism, which allows the <b>client</b> <b>site</b> to make a single remote invocation to gather data from multiple servers that keep replicas of data streams and aggregate partial data into a complete data stream. In addition, our system also allows the <b>client</b> <b>site</b> to forward local data to other clients. Our framework is implemented by extending the Java RMI stub to allow custom designs for streaming buffers and controls, and by providing a continuous buffer for raw data in the transport layer socket. This enhanced framework allows standard Java RMI services to enjoy streaming capabilities. In addition, we propose aggregation algorithms as scheduling methods in such an environment. Preliminary experiments using our framework demonstrate its promising performance in the provision of streaming services in Java RMI layers...|$|E
