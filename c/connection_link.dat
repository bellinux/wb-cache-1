50|$|In Quebec, {{defamation}} {{was originally}} {{grounded in the}} law inherited from France. To establish civil liability for defamation, the plaintiff must establish, on a balance of probabilities, {{the existence of an}} injury (fault), a wrongful act (damage), and of a causal <b>connection</b> (<b>link</b> of causality) between the two. A person who has made defamatory remarks will not necessarily be civilly liable for them. The plaintiff must further demonstrate that the person who made the remarks committed a wrongful act. Defamation in Quebec is governed by a reasonableness standard, as opposed to strict liability; a defendant who made a false statement would not be held liable if it was reasonable to believe the statement was true.|$|E

50|$|In {{computer}} science, in {{the context}} of data storage, serialization is the process of translating data structures or object state into a format that can be stored (for example, in a file or memory buffer) or transmitted (for example, across a network <b>connection</b> <b>link)</b> and reconstructed later (possibly in a different computer environment). When the resulting series of bits is reread according to the serialization format, {{it can be used to}} create a semantically identical clone of the original object. For many complex objects, such as those that make extensive use of references, this process is not straightforward. Serialization of object-oriented objects does not include any of their associated methods with which they were previously linked.|$|E
50|$|The {{traditional}} {{technique of}} titanium production is via the Kroll process which involves chlorination of TiO2 ore {{in the presence}} of carbon and reacting the resulting TiCl4 with magnesium to produce titanium sponge. These processes take place at temperatures as high as 1040 °C. The sponge particle range in size from 45 to 180 µm, with particles ~150 µm termed ‘sponge fines’. These fines are irregularly shaped and porous with a sponge-like morphology. The fines are then blended with alloy additions; cold compacted into a green compact at up to 415 MPa then vacuum sintered at 1260 °C to produce a 99.5% dense component. Hot isostatic pressing (HIP) can further increase the density of these parts and produce components more economically than cast or wrought parts, but the porosity present in the material degrades fatigue and fracture properties. The BE approach has been used to produce valves for the Toyota Altezza, golf club heads and softball bats. More recently, close to 100% dense Ti Grade 5 parts has been achieved using a hydrided powder along with 60:40 Al:V master alloy. The mechanical properties compare well with those exhibited by cast-and-wrought products. A cost estimate of less than $3.00 for a 0.320 g automotive <b>connection</b> <b>link</b> has been made.|$|E

Furthermore, we extend the existing logic of the scene by defining the rendering process as a scene element.

30|$|Within {{the variety}} of models for optimal foraging, Lévy flights have several {{characteristic}} properties that show promise for software testing. In particular, the Lévy flight hypothesis accentuates the most significant property {{of these kinds of}} stochastic processes for our purposes. It states that Lévy flights minimize search time when foraging sources of food that are sparsely and randomly distributed, resting, and refillable. These assumptions match the properties of bugs in software (with the interpretation that refillable translates to the fact that software bugs stay until fixed). In addition to the mathematical Lévy flight hypothesis, the Lévy flight foraging hypothesis in theoretical biology states that these processes actually model real foraging behavior in certain biological systems due to natural selection. The Lévy flight hypothesis constitutes the major <b>connection</b> <b>link</b> between optimal foraging theory and random software testing.|$|E

40|$|Effects {{of carbon}} {{nanotubes}} on {{properties of the}} fluorouracil anticancer drug: DFT studies of a CNT-fluorouracil compound Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed to investigate {{the effects of a}} carbon nanotube (CNT) on the properties of the fluorouracil (F-Uracil) anticancer drug. To achieve the purpose, a molecular model including both of F-Uracil and CNT molecules was created to represent the CNT@F-Uracil compound. The optimized parameters indicated that the new compound could show new properties different from the original F-Uracil. The obtained chemical shielding parameters also indicated that the electronic properties of oxygen and fluorine atoms could detect notable changes whereas those of carbon and hydrogen atoms are almost negligible. Moreover, the most changes of properties were observed for nitrogen atom number one, in which make the <b>connection</b> <b>link</b> of the CNT group to the F-Uracil molecule.

40|$|We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} control traffic overhead in MANETs with long-lived connections, operating under a reactive rout-ing protocol (e. g. AODV). In such settings, control traffic overhead origins can be traced principally to <b>connection</b> <b>link</b> failures, which trigger expensive global route discoveries. In this paper, we introduce a route maintenance scheme de-veloped {{with the objective of}} reducing global route discov-eries in such settings. The proposed scheme decrease the expected number of route discovery attempts by taking pre-emptive action to counteract impending link disconnections due to node movement. The proposed scheme was imple-mented as an extension of AODV in ns 2, and compared with the standard AODV under different network regimes. Through the analysis of data derived from extensive simula-tions, we demonstrate that the proposed scheme significantly decreases overall control traffic while maintaining compara-ble packet delivery rates, at the cost of only very minor degradation in path optimality...|$|E

The FNN has capability to develop complex, nonlinear functional relationships between input–output patterns based on limited and sometimes inconsistent data, and is therefore suitable to predict the accident frequency rate on the basis of data obtained from historical data of the enterprise.

We devise a rout-ing algorithm which provides not only connectivity but also bandwidth among multicast members at a low cost.

A simulation study is used to illustrate the al-gorithms ' performance and trade offs. 1 In t roduct ion In a QOS environment, routing algorithms must provide routes which conform with users end-to-end requirements while minimizing the cost of a connection.

40|$|The Scalable Video Coding (SVC) {{standard}} as {{an extension}} of H. 264 /AVC allows efficient, standard-based temporal, spatial, and quality scalability of video bit streams. Scalability of a video bit stream allows for media bit rate as well as for device capability adaptation. Moreover, adaptation of the bit rate of a video signal is a desirable key feature, if limitation in network resources, mostly characterized by throughput variations, varying delay or transmission errors, need to be considered. Typically, in mobile networks the throughput, delay and errors of a <b>connection</b> (<b>link)</b> depend on the current reception conditions, which are largely influenced by a number of physical factors. In order to cope with the typically varying characteristics of mobile communication channels in unicast, multicast, or broadcast services, different methods for increasing robustness and achieving quality of service are desirable. We will give an overview of SVC and its relation to mobile delivery methods. Furthermore, innovative use cases are introduced which apply SVC in mobile networks...|$|E
