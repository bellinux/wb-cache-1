40|$|The ARINC- 653 {{standard}} {{is often used}} to build mixed-criticality systems, using a partitioned architecture. Inter-partition communication is carried out by means of a message-passing mechanism based on ports. The standard includes an API for Ada, but the implementation semantics of operation ports is not fully defined. Furthermore, the API was defined for the Ada 95 standard, and therefore {{does not take into account}} the enhancements to the real-time features of the language that have been incorporated in the 2005 and 2013 standards, most notably the Ravenscar profile.

50|$|The EP-2 {{added an}} Accessory Port, a power and <b>communication</b> <b>port,</b> which allowed {{the use of}} various accessories, such as an {{external}} stereo microphone for HD video recording. However, the principal use of the accessory port was a new, high resolution, optional hotshoe mounted VF-2 electronic viewfinder (EVF). The VF-2 had a flip angle eyepiece, allowing viewing from 0-90 degrees. The high resolution VF-2 had specifications that matched the highly acclaimed built-in EVF on the Panasonic Lumix DMC-G1, the first MFT camera ever introduced.|$|E

50|$|For TXE4, TXE4E {{replaced}} the ten Miniature Threaded Wire Stores (MTWS) in the MCU {{with just two}} units, each containing six re-programmable chips which could be removed and updated with changes via a separate computer.

The Cyclic Stores threading fields (12mS x 156mS & 3 x 36mS) were commoned and all new subscribers, ceases or change of Class Of Service, which were threaded previously, were now done via a terminal.

30|$|According to {{the focus}} of this work, the {{cooperative}} trajectory planning algorithm, the simulation is implemented based on the proposed method, regardless the technique of communication. Since the communication mediums are considered as tools to exchange the information between vehicle and infrastructure, any communication standard, which provides the fit qualification, can be applied to autonomous intersection management. In this work, the Internet protocol has been used for communicating between vehicle and infrastructure. The wireless local area network with UDP protocol is implemented. In general, a computer is set as the vehicle server in order to generate the requested messages and send to the intersection manager over the WiFi, IP address. Meanwhile, another computer is the intersection manager for simulating the autonomous crossing. However, the option of the local host IP address 127.0. 0.1 with different broadcast <b>communication</b> <b>ports</b> is used for communication in this simulation to run a simulation on a stand-alone computer, four <b>communication</b> <b>ports</b> for vehicles from each single street and another port for the intersection manager. The communication will be updated every 0.1 -s time interval or in 10 -Hz frequency.|$|R

50|$|Each time Intel {{launched}} a new microprocessor, they simultaneously provided a System Development Kit (SDK) allowing engineers, university students, and others to familiarise themselves with the new processor's concepts and features. The SDK single-board computers allowed the user to enter object code from a keyboard or upload it through a <b>communication</b> <b>port,</b> and then test run the code. The SDK boards provided a system monitor ROM to operate the keyboard and other interfaces. Kits varied in their specific features but generally offered optional memory and interface configurations, a serial terminal link, audio cassette storage, EPROM program memory. Intel's Intellec development system could download code to the SDK boards.|$|E

40|$|In {{a digital}} modem design, the {{integration}} of the Analog to Digital Converters (ADC) and Digital to Analog Converters (DAC) with the core processor is usually a major issue for the designer. In this paper an FPGA scalable Software Defined Radio platform based on a Spartan- 6 as a control unit is presented, developed for both educational and research purposes, which can fit the different application requirements in terms of analog front-end performance, processing unit and cost. The resolution and sampling frequency of the analog front-end are its main adjustable parameters. The processing core requirements involve the FPGA and the <b>communication</b> <b>ports.</b> A multidisciplinary working group was required to design a high performance system for both analog front-end and digital processing core in terms of signal integrity and electromagnetic compatibility.
