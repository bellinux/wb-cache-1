The lattice spacing can be tuned to produce optimal boundary conditions of the standing wave inside the cavity to produce minimal loss and highest Q.|$|E

Since silicon is an indirect band gap semiconductor, the quantum yield of radiative recombination in {{this material is}} very low. As the thickness of silicon-based nanostructures reduces below the effective Bohr radius (about 9 nm, in silicon) the quantum efficiency of light emission from this material increases owing to the quantum <b>confinement</b> <b>effect.</b> Relying on this fact, photoemission capability of silicon nanotubes with very thin sidewalls has been demonstrated.|$|E

30|$|It can be {{also found}} from Fig. 2 that the Raman {{spectrum}} of the ZnO nanowires is slightly asymmetrical with respect to those of ZnO crystals [20]. This asymmetrical spectrum shape is mainly attributed to the <b>confinement</b> <b>effects</b> of phonons in nanowire samples. The phonons can be confined within the nanosized systems and thus phonons other than those of Brillouin-zone center can {{also contribute to the}} Raman spectrum, which leads to the asymmetrical shapes of the Raman spectrum. Such an asymmetrical shape of the Raman modes associated with the phonon <b>confinement</b> <b>effects</b> in ZnO nano-sized systems are also reported on ZnO nanoparticles [22].|$|R
50|$|An {{increase}} {{in either the}} core size or shell length results in longer emission wavelengths. The interface between the core and shell can be tailored to passivate relaxation pathways and form radiative states. The size dependence of the band gap in these nanoparticles due to the quantum <b>confinement</b> <b>effect</b> has been utilized to control the photoluminescence color from blue to red by preparing nanoparticles of varying sizes. By manipulating the size or shape of the nanoparticles, the luminescence colors and purity can be controlled. However, the quantum yield and the brightness of luminescence of the CSSNCs is ultimately limited and it cannot be controlled {{because of the presence}} of surface traps.|$|E
50|$|The quantum <b>confinement</b> <b>effect</b> can be {{observed}} once {{the diameter of the}} particle is of the same magnitude as the wavelength of the electron's wave function. When materials are this small, their electronic and optical properties deviate substantially from those of bulk materials.As the material is miniaturized towards nano-scale the confining dimension naturally decreases. But the characteristics are no longer averaged by bulk, and hence continuous, but are at the level of quanta and thus discrete. In other words, the energy spectrum becomes discrete, measured as quanta, rather than continuous as in bulk materials. As a result, the bandgap asserts itself: there is a small and finite separation between energy levels. This situation of discrete energy levels is called quantum confinement.|$|E
50|$|Τhe {{electronic}} and optical {{properties of materials}} are affected by size and shape. Well-established technical achievements including quantum dots were derived from size manipulation and investigation for their theoretical corroboration on quantum <b>confinement</b> <b>effect.</b> The {{major part of the}} theory is the behaviour of the exciton resembles that of an atom as its surrounding space shortens. A rather good approximation of an exciton’s behaviour is the 3-D model of a particle in a box. The solution of this problem provides a sole mathematical connection between energy states and the dimension of space. Decreasing the volume or the dimensions of the available space, increases the energy of the states. Shown in the diagram is the change in electron energy level and bandgap between nanomaterial and its bulk state.|$|E

5000|$|CdSe-derived {{nanoparticles}} with sizes below 10 nm {{exhibit a}} property known as quantum confinement. Quantum confinement results when the electrons in a material {{are confined to}} a very small volume. Quantum confinement is size dependent, meaning the properties of CdSe nanoparticles are tunable based on their size. [...] One type of CdSe nanoparticle is a CdSe quantum dot. This discretization of energy states results in electronic transitions that vary by quantum dot size. Larger quantum dots have closer electronic states than smaller quantum dots {{which means that the}} energy required to excite an electron from HOMO to the LUMO is lower than the same electronic transition in a smaller quantum dot. This quantum <b>confinement</b> <b>effect</b> can be observed as a red shift in absorbance spectra for nanocrystals with larger diameters.|$|E
50|$|Unlike simple atomic {{structure}}s, {{a quantum}} dot structure has the unusual property that energy levels are strongly {{dependent on the}} structure's size. For example, CdSe quantum dot light emission can be tuned from red (5 nm diameter) to the violet region (1.5 nm dot). The physical reason for QD coloration is the quantum <b>confinement</b> <b>effect</b> and {{is directly related to}} their energy levels. The bandgap energy that determines the energy (and hence color) of the fluorescent light is inversely proportional to the square of the size of quantum dot. Larger QDs have more energy levels that are more closely spaced, allowing the QD to emit (or absorb) photons of lower energy (redder color). In other words, the emitted photon energy increases as the dot size decreases, because greater energy is required to confine the semiconductor excitation to a smaller volume.|$|E

These oriented single crystals are being used in semiconductor nanowire devices such as diodes, transistors, logic circuits, lasers and sensors. Since nanowires have one dimensional structure meaning large surface to volume ratio, the diffusion resistance decreases. In addition, their efficiency in electron transport which is due to the quantum <b>confinement</b> <b>effect,</b> make their electrical properties be influenced by minor perturbation. Therefore, use of these nanowires in nanosensor elements increases the sensitivity in electrode response. As mentioned above, one dimensionality and chemical flexibility of the semiconductor nanowires make them applicable in nanolasers. Peidong Yang and his co-workers have done some research on room-temperature ultraviolet nanowire nanolasers in which the significant properties of these nanolasers have been mentioned. They have concluded that using short wavelength nanolasers have applications in different fields such as optical computing, information storage, and microanalysis.|$|E
