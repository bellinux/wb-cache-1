40|$|Weighted <b>power</b> <b>means</b> are a {{flexible}} and powerful family of aggregation functions. The simplest {{member of this}} family, the weighted arithmetic mean, previously has been adapted for interval type- 2 fuzzy scores and weights. This operator has been termed a “linguistic weighted average,” {{and has been a}} primary instantiation of a “perceptual computer” in recent literature. We present an algorithm for computing weighted <b>power</b> <b>means</b> of arbitrary <b>power</b> for type- 1 or interval type- 2 fuzzy inputs and weights, which we call “linguistic weighted <b>power</b> <b>means.</b> ” We compare the linguistic weighted <b>power</b> <b>mean</b> and the linguistic weighted average on an “investment judgment advisor” example.

40|$|It is {{well known}} that if P_t denotes a set of <b>power</b> <b>means</b> then the mapping R∋ t P_t(v) ∈ (v, v) is both 1 - 1 and onto for any non-constant {{sequence}} v = (v_ 1, [...] ., v_n) of positive numbers. Shortly: the family of <b>power</b> <b>means</b> is a scale. If I is an interval and f I →R is a continuous, strictly monotone function then f^- 1 (1 n∑ f(v_i)) is a natural generalization of <b>power</b> <b>means,</b> so called quasi-arithmetic mean generated by f. A famous folk theorem says that the only homogeneous, quasi-arithmetic <b>means</b> are <b>power</b> <b>means.</b> We prove that, upon replacing the homogeneity requirement by an invariant-type axiom, one gets a family of quasi-arithmetic means building up a scale, too.

Fifteen physically active female university athletes performed a 45 s cycle ergometer test at resistances of 0. 075, 0. 085, and 0. 095 kp/kg bw, as well as a 45 s and a 3 repetition isokinetic flexion and extension test at velocities of 60, 180, and 300 $ sp circ$/s. Results revealed that peak <b>power,</b> <b>mean</b> <b>power</b> (W and W/kg), and fatigue (W/kg) were highest at the 0. 095 kp/kg bw resistance and lowest at the 0. 075 kp/kg bw resistance.

40|$|We discuss {{properties}} of certain generalization of <b>Power</b> <b>Means</b> proposed in 1971 by Carlson, Meany and Nelson.

We work towards a complete {{answer to the question}} when such means satisfy inequalities resembling the classical Hardy inequality. We give a definitive answer in {{a large part of the}} parameter space. An unexpected corollary is that this family behaves much differently than most of other families admitting Hardy-type inequalities. Namely, arbitrarily small perturbations of parameters may lead to the breakdown of such inequalities. Comment: 5 page...|$|R
