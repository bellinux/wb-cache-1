50|$|DMA is {{included}} {{in a number of}} connections, because it lets a connected device (such as a camcorder, network <b>card,</b> <b>storage</b> <b>device</b> or other useful accessory or internal PC card) transfer data between itself and the computer at the maximum speed possible, by using direct hardware access to read or write directly to main memory without any operating system supervision or interaction. The legitimate uses of such devices have led to wide adoption of DMA accessories and connections, but an attacker can equally use the same facility to create an accessory that will connect using the same port, and can then potentially gain direct access to part or all of the physical memory address space of the computer, bypassing all OS security mechanisms and any lock screen, to read all that the computer is doing, steal data or cryptographic keys, install or run spyware and other exploits, or modify the system to allow backdoors or other malware.|$|E

30|$|Semiconductor {{memory is}} an {{indispensable}} component and backbone of all modern electronic devices. All recognizable computing platforms ranging from hand-held devices to large super-computer storage systems {{are used for}} storing data, either temporarily or permanently, as per their requirement [1].

40|$|Abstract â€“ In {{a future}} {{electric}} power system, there will exist {{a lot of}} distributed energy resources such as energy <b>storage</b> <b>devices,</b> renewable generation and cogeneration in the demand side. A system operator can utilize the dis-tributed energy <b>storage</b> <b>devices</b> to control power flow of transmission networks and supply-demand balance con-cerned with bilateral transactions. For management of such distributed energy storage de-vices, a mobile agent which can migrate in computer net-works is available. This paper proposes an application of the mobile agent to management of the distributed <b>storage</b> <b>devices</b> for power flow control of transmission network. Management of distributed <b>storage</b> <b>devices</b> is done hierar-chically. On the transmission-level, the system operator controls power flows by using a lot of distributed <b>storage</b> <b>devices</b> connected in distribution networks. On distribu-tion-level, the mobile agent aggregates the information about such distributed <b>storage</b> <b>devices</b> and makes charge-discharge schedules of individual <b>storage</b> <b>devices.</b> The mobile agent is called <b>Storage</b> <b>Device</b> Management (SDM) Agent in this paper.
