We sum up some {{current results}} of the {{theoretical}} study of the reasons of successful application of supercompilers to verification of monotonic <b>counter</b> <b>systems</b> representing the models of practical protocols and other parallel systems.

40|$|AbstractThe {{verification}} of final termination for <b>counter</b> <b>systems</b> is undecidable. For non flattable <b>counter</b> <b>systems,</b> the {{verification of}} this type of property is generally based on the exhibition of a ranking function. Proving the existence of a ranking function for general <b>counter</b> <b>systems</b> is also undecidable. We provide a framework in which the verification whether a given function is a ranking function is decidable. This framework is applicable to convex <b>counter</b> <b>systems</b> which admit a Presburger or a LPDS ranking function. This extends the results of [A. Bradley, Z. Manna, and B. Sipma.

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is to {{investigate}} {{the possibility of using}} a counter machines modelchecker, FAST [2] for instance, for programs working over singly-linked lists. We define a CTL ∗ logic which may express quantitative properties and shape properties on the memory managed by pointer systems.

5000|$|The {{next step}} of the Virus Counter’s {{evolution}} also {{took place in the}} Rowlen’s lab at UC-Boulder as Carrie Stoffel’s Ph.D. project. By 2004 Carrie had added a second detection channel to the SNaPE instrument and improved data analysis substantially to increase specificity. The principle of detection was based on staining proteins and nucleic acids with fluorescent dyes within a liquid sample, where the protein stain emits in the red region of the visible spectrum and the nucleic acid stain emits in the yellow region of the visible spectrum. As stained particles pass through the probe region and interact with a laser, emissions are detected and recorded for analysis. This dual channel system established the concept of measuring intact virions through detection of co-localized protein and nucleic acids. Results from baculovirus analyzed with this dual-channel virus <b>counter</b> <b>system</b> were lower in magnitude than the SNaPE results, being more similar in magnitude and correlated with infectious assay results.

Our results span different complexity classes (mainly from PTime to PSpace) and they apply to languages in which arithmetical constraints on counter values are systematically allowed.

5000|$|While {{the camera}} is almost {{completely}} battery dependent (small exception)—power is provided by a 6 volt PX28 (originally Mercury specified 1968 and Silver-Oxide 1971), but equal substitutes PX28S/4SR44—as with many systems of the era, the mirror and cloth curtains are mechanically driven, {{the timing of the}} shutter being electrically governed by transistors and a magnet. The combination of capacitors routed by the speed setting determine the length of time the magnet remains engaged. Also, the operation of the shutter is not normally possible without film being properly loaded. However, one can test the shutter by rotating the counter dial away from the empty position while the film door is open and then by closing the film door while still holding the dial, thus facilitating the unlocking of the advance mechanism and operation of the shutter. The frame counter is incremented only while there is film passing through the [...] "main roller" [...] or [...] "counter roller" [...] next to the take-up spool in the camera. The camera disengages the [...] "transport system" [...] when the counter dial (connected to the frame counting control cam) has reached the last frame, or when the counter has returned to the [...] "empty" [...] or start position. The automatic frame counter resets only if the shutter is released before opening the back. Because a battery must power the timing, the loss of adequate voltage means the camera halts after the mirror is allowed to rise, and therefore the curtain release will not disengage. To drive the mirror to finish the cycle, a small button located flush on the right-hand camera front, just below the shutter-release button, is provided for restarting of the mirror/shutter cycle. Depressing the shutter release once more will release the cycles. The shutter release button is standard threaded for bulb or cable releases or the use of a large accessory button. The fingernail-operated latch to the left lower side releases the film door for loading. The film spools are secured by the pins and slot shaped opening at either end to the spool. The camera has two twist-lock cams that turn and pull out to open, the left side for the unexposed roll and the right side, known as the “take-up”. Because of the arrangement differences of the 120 and 220 start length of paper, the indicated starting points are marked above the film plane for lining-up of the start marks for the film. The film advance system is a tension/friction type, the film source side being a tension brake and the take-up side torque/slip clutch. A counting cam governs the frame count and interacts with the friction system to allow enough slip and movement to accurately space each frame {{from the beginning of the}} roll to the end. The counting cam also allows the system to regulate a lock to open and close, allowing the shutter to fire. This slip system has brought criticism of durability in early models, as it would slip more over time, causing frame spacing issues as well as disengaging the shutter. The frame <b>counter</b> <b>system,</b> tied to the counter roller, operates the automatic reset of the counter (returns it to start) whenever the back is opened and also sets the regulating of the next frame.|$|E
