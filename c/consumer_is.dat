5|$|A {{food web}} is the archetypal {{ecological}} network. Plants capture solar energy {{and use it}} to synthesize simple sugars during photosynthesis. As plants grow, they accumulate nutrients and are eaten by grazing herbivores, and the energy is transferred through a chain of organisms by consumption. The simplified linear feeding pathways that move from a basal trophic species to a top <b>consumer</b> <b>is</b> called the food chain. The larger interlocking pattern of food chains in an ecological community creates a complex food web. Food webs are a type of concept map or a heuristic device that is used to illustrate and study pathways of energy and material flows.|$|E
5|$|In net {{metering}} {{the price of}} the electricity produced {{is the same as the}} price supplied to the consumer, and the <b>consumer</b> <b>is</b> billed on the difference between production and consumption. Net metering can usually be done with no changes to standard electricity meters, which accurately measure power in both directions and automatically report the difference, and because it allows homeowners and businesses to generate electricity at a different time from consumption, effectively using the grid as a giant storage battery. With {{net metering}}, deficits are billed each month while surpluses are rolled over to the following month. Best practices call for perpetual roll over of kWh credits. Excess credits upon termination of service are either lost, or paid for at a rate ranging from wholesale to retail rate or above, as can be excess annual credits. In New Jersey, annual excess credits are paid at the wholesale rate, as are left over credits when a customer terminates service.|$|E

25|$|Under the Fair Credit Reporting Act, a <b>consumer</b> <b>is</b> {{entitled}} to a free credit report (but not a free credit score) within 60 days of any adverse action (e.g., being denied credit, or receiving substandard credit terms from a lender) taken {{as a result of}} their credit score. Under the Wall Street reform bill passed on July 22, 2010, a <b>consumer</b> <b>is</b> {{entitled to}} receive a free credit score if they are denied a loan or insurance due to their credit score.|$|E
25|$|This {{also means}} that if the <b>consumer</b> <b>is</b> {{indifferent}} between A and B and is indifferent between B and C she will be indifferent between A and C.|$|E
25|$|There are, however, {{some key}} differences. One is that, {{unlike in the}} United States, where a <b>{{consumer}}</b> <b>is</b> allowed only one free copy of their credit report a year, in Canada, the consumer may order a free copy of their credit report any number of times in a year, {{as long as the}} request is made in writing, {{and as long as the}} consumer asks for a printed copy to be delivered by mail. This request by the <b>consumer</b> <b>is</b> noted in the credit report as a 'soft inquiry', but it has no effect on their credit score. According to Equifax's ScorePower Report, Equifax Beacon scores range from 300 to 900. Trans Union Emperica scores also range from 300 and 900.|$|E

50|$|Although Chicago school economists {{assumes that}} {{theoretically}} <b>consumers</b> <b>are</b> farsighted and rational, {{the results of}} a number of empirical economic literature insist that <b>consumers</b> <b>are</b> in many cases highly myopic towards the sophisticated choices.|$|R
50|$|The first {{objective}} of financial regulation <b>is</b> <b>consumer</b> protection.

25|$|A second common {{reason for}} this kind of {{discrimination}} is when the worker or <b>consumer</b> <b>is</b> not cost-efficient. For example, some stores in the US Northwest do not stock ethnic foods, despite requests for such, since they feel the cost is too high for too low a return.|$|E
25|$|Means that if A and B are in {{all respect}} {{identical}} the consumer will consider A {{to be at least}} as good as (i.e. weakly preferred to) B. Alternatively, the axiom can be modified to read that the <b>consumer</b> <b>is</b> indifferent with regard to A and B.|$|E

25|$|The service {{provider}} must deliver the {{service at the}} time of service consumption. The service is not manifested in a physical object that is independent of the provider. The service <b>consumer</b> <b>is</b> also inseparable from service delivery. Examples: The service consumer must sit in the hairdresser's chair, or in the airplane seat. Correspondingly, the hairdresser or the pilot must be in the shop or plane, respectively, to deliver the service.|$|E
25|$|Self-worth – In {{the book}} Income, Saving and the Theory of Consumer Behavior (1949), J.S. Duesenberry {{proposed}} that a person's conspicuous consumption psychologically depends not only upon the actual level of spending, but also {{depends upon the}} degree {{of his or her}} spending, as compared with and to the spending of other people. That the conspicuous <b>consumer</b> <b>is</b> motivated by the importance, to him or to her, of the opinion of the social and economic reference groups for whom are performed the patterns of conspicuous consumption.|$|E
25|$|The base or basal {{species in}} a food web are those species without prey and can include autotrophs or {{saprophytic}} detritivores (i.e., the community of decomposers in soil, biofilms, and periphyton). Feeding connections in the web are called trophic links. The number of trophic links per <b>consumer</b> <b>is</b> a measure of food web connectance. Food chains are nested within the trophic links of food webs. Food chains are linear (noncyclic) feeding pathways that trace monophagous consumers from a base species {{up to the top}} consumer, which is usually a larger predatory carnivore.|$|E
50|$|Also in this {{business}} model, <b>consumers</b> <b>are</b> becoming the voices of those products and significantly impacting {{the success or failure}} of online stores, products, and brands, particularly through their involvement on the social media Those <b>consumers</b> <b>are</b> the important roles to drive the products and brands to thrive.

In addition, it is also found that <b>consumers</b> <b>are</b> willing to pay higher fares to maximize the compensation received from airlines in reaction to accidents. ...|$|R
25|$|In economics, many {{problems}} involve multiple objectives along with constraints on what combinations of those objectives are attainable. For example, consumer's demand for various goods {{is determined by}} the process of maximization of the utilities derived from those goods, subject to a constraint based on how much income is available to spend on those goods and on the prices of those goods. This constraint allows more of one good to be purchased only at the sacrifice of consuming less of another good; therefore, the various objectives (more consumption of each good is preferred) are in conflict with each other. A common method for analyzing such a problem is to use a graph of indifference curves, representing preferences, and a budget constraint, representing the trade-offs that the <b>consumer</b> <b>is</b> faced with.|$|E
25|$|The {{development}} of personal coping strategies (including self-management or self-help) {{is said to}} be an important element. This can involve making use of medication or psychotherapy if the <b>consumer</b> <b>is</b> fully informed and listened to, including about adverse effects and about which methods fit with the consumer's life and their journey of recovery. Developing coping and problem solving skills to manage individual traits and problem issues (which {{may or may not be}} seen as symptoms of mental disorder) may require a person becoming their own expert, in order to identify key stress points and possible crisis points, and to understand and develop personal ways of responding and coping. Developing a sense of meaning and overall purpose {{is said to be}} important for sustaining the recovery process. This may involve recovering or developing a social or work role. It may also involve renewing, finding or developing a guiding philosophy, religion, politics or culture. From a postmodern perspective, this can be seen as developing a narrative.|$|E
25|$|As mentioned, lifestyle- and obesity-related {{diseases}} {{are becoming increasingly}} prevalent all around the world. There {{is little doubt that}} the increasingly widespread application of some modern food processing technologies has contributed to this development. The food processing industry is a major part of modern economy, and as such it is influential in political decisions (e.g., nutritional recommendations, agricultural subsidising). In any known profit-driven economy, health considerations are hardly a priority; effective production of cheap foods with a long shelf-life is more the trend. In general, whole, fresh foods have a relatively short shelf-life and are less profitable to produce and sell than are more processed foods. Thus, the <b>consumer</b> <b>is</b> left with the choice between more expensive, but nutritionally superior, whole, fresh foods, and cheap, usually nutritionally inferior, processed foods. Because processed foods are often cheaper, more convenient (in both purchasing, storage, and preparation), and more available, the consumption of nutritionally inferior foods has been increasing throughout the world along with many nutrition-related health complications.|$|E
40|$|The {{existing}} literature in expert-customer relationship concludes that when: i) <b>consumers</b> <b>are</b> homogenous, ii) <b>consumers</b> <b>are</b> committed with an an expert once this one made a recommendation, and iii) {{the type of}} treatment provided is verifiable, an expert finds optimal to serve efficiently his customers. This work shows that the previous result may not occur when <b>consumers</b> <b>are</b> not risk-neutral. Our result, that holds in a monopoly setting and under Bertrand competition, suggests that risk averse consumers have {{more likely to be}} mistreated by experts.

25|$|Low {{introductory}} {{credit card}} rates {{are limited to}} a fixed term, usually between 6 and 12 months, after which a higher rate is charged. As all credit cards charge fees and interest, some customers become so indebted to their credit card provider that they are driven to bankruptcy. Some credit cards often levy a rate of 20 to 30 percent after a payment is missed. In other cases, a fixed charge is levied without change to the interest rate. In some cases universal default may apply: the high default rate is applied to a card in good standing by missing a payment on an unrelated account from the same provider. This {{can lead to a}} snowball effect in which the <b>consumer</b> <b>is</b> drowned by unexpectedly high interest rates. Further, most card holder agreements enable the issuer to arbitrarily raise the interest rate for any reason they see fit. First Premier Bank at one point offered a credit card with a 79.9% interest rate; however, they discontinued this card in February 2011 because of persistent defaults.|$|E
25|$|Most Indian {{shopping}} {{happens in}} open markets or numerous small grocery and retail shops. Shoppers typically wait outside the shop, ask {{for what they}} want, and can not pick or examine a product from the shelf. Access to the shelf or product storage area is limited. Once the shopper requests the food staple or household product they are looking for, the shopkeeper goes to the container or shelf or {{to the back of}} the store, brings it out and offers it for sale to the shopper. Often the shopkeeper may substitute the product, claiming that it is similar or equivalent to the product the <b>consumer</b> <b>is</b> asking for. The product typically has no price label in these small retail shops; all packaged products must display the maximum retail price (MRP) above which the product cannot be sold. It is a criminal offence to sell a product beyond the MRP of a product. The shopkeeper can price the food staple and household products arbitrarily, and two consumers may pay different prices for the same product on the same day but never will those price be above the maximum retail price. Price is rarely negotiated between the shopper and shopkeeper. The shoppers usually do not have time to examine the product label, and do not have a choice to make an informed decision between competitive products.|$|E
25|$|The {{earliest}} cylinder boxes have a plain {{brown paper}} exterior, sometimes rubber-stamped {{with the company}} name. By the late 1890s, record companies usually pasted a generic printed label around {{the outside of the}} box, sometimes with a penciled catalog number but no other indication of the identity of the recording inside. A slip of paper stating the title and performer was placed inside the box with the cylinder. At first this information was hand-written or typed on each slip, but printed versions became more common once cylinders were sold in large enough quantities to justify the printing set-up cost. The recording itself usually began with a spoken announcement of the title and performer and also the name of the record company. On a typical Edison record slip from 1903, the <b>consumer</b> <b>is</b> invited to cut off a coupon with the printed information and paste it onto the lid of the box. Alternatively, a circular area within the coupon could be cut out and pasted onto the end of a spindle for that cylinder in one of the specially built cases and cabinets made for storing cylinder records. Only a minority of cylinder record customers purchased such storage units, however. Slightly later, the record number was stamped on the lid, then later still a printed label with the title and artist information was factory-applied to the lid. Shortly after the start of the 20th century, an abbreviated version of this information was impressed into or printed on one edge of the cylinder itself.|$|E

40|$|We {{investigate}} how firms' incentives to acquire customer data for targeted offers depend on its quality. A two-dimensional Hotelling model <b>is</b> proposed where <b>consumers</b> <b>are</b> heterogeneous both {{with respect to}} their locations and transportation cost parameters (flexibility). Firms have perfect data on the locations of consumers while data on their flexibility <b>is</b> imperfect. When <b>consumers</b> <b>are</b> relatively homogeneous in their flexibility, in equilibrium both firms acquire customer data regardless of its quality. This increases profits but harms <b>consumers.</b> When <b>consumers</b> <b>are</b> relatively differentiated in flexibility, data acquisition incentives depend on its quality. Only if the data is sufficiently precise, both firms acquire it and their profits decrease, while <b>consumers</b> <b>are</b> better-off. Our model has particular relevance for location-based marketing such as in mobile telephony, where firms have near-perfect information on the proximity of customers but may have imperfect knowledge of other consumer characteristics...|$|R
40|$|<b>Consumer</b> <b>are</b> active {{participants}} in the market place. Without consumers market cannot function as it is now. As {{active participants}} and due to some weaknesses possessed by <b>consumers,</b> they have <b>been</b> given certain basic rights {{in order to ensure}} that they are not manipulated by manufacturers. One of those rights it right to safety in relation to products and services. Product safety is paramount important to consumer safety and should become a vital component of consumer protection legislation. This <b>is</b> because <b>consumers</b> <b>are</b> being exposed to various types of products which some of them are manufactured and presented in a sophisticated manner that really challenge the ability of the consumers to make a safe choice. Without proper guidance and protection, <b>consumers</b> <b>are</b> not able to identify and even to protect themselves against risks when using the products. Consumers need protection against unsafe products. Therefore, product safety law can serve as a protecting tool to ensure that <b>consumers</b> <b>are</b> presented only with safe product...|$|R
