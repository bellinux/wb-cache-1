25|$|The design, {{using as}} many {{commercial}} components {{as possible to}} improve reliability {{and the rate of}} production, was standardized in 1940 and built by the Autocar Company, Diamond T Motor Company, and the White Motor Company. Offered with a choice of White 160AX or IHC Red Diamond 450 engines, the M3 was driven through a manual <b>constant-mesh</b> (non-synchromesh) transmission with four forward and one reverse gear, as well as a two-speed transfer case. The front suspension was leaf spring, tracks by vertical volute spring. Braking was vacuum-assisted hydraulic, steering manual, without power assist. The electrical system was 12-volt.|$|E
25|$|The PS2 {{followed}} the PD2 Titan in having the 125bhp 9.8-litre O600 engine {{and a new}} synchromesh gearbox. With changes to rules on width and length there were numerous {{different versions of the}} home market PS2 based on permutations of width and length, whether built with or without a rear dropped frame and whether reconstructed from short-wheelbase chassis or built new to the longer wheelbase. PS2/1, 3, 5 and 7 had a 17ft 6in wheelbase for 27ft 6in bodywork. PS2/10, 11, 12, 12A, 13, 13A, 14 and 15 had a longer wheelbase of 18ft 9in for 30ft long coachwork (but see later about the six-wheel PS2/10 and /11). The entire home market Tiger range was vacuum-braked and PS2s for the UK had the synchromesh gearbox only, whilst the Titan PD2 had a number of options including <b>constant-mesh,</b> AEC preselector and Pneumocyclic. The last new PS2 coaches entered service in 1953 with West Riding Automobile Company, and the last home-market customer for the Tiger PS2 bus was the Burnley, Colne and Nelson Joint Transport Committee, their last arrived in 1955 and put in 20 years and more of work, thus being the last half-cab single deckers on normal service in the UK.|$|E
2500|$|Clément was a {{director}} of Panhard-Levassor, and when the factory could not meet the production requirements for circa 500 units of the 1898 'voiture légère' ('dog cart') model, he undertook manufacture under licence at his factory in Levallois-Perret. It was designed by airship pioneer Commandant Arthur Krebs, of Panhard, and used a tubular chassis, centre-pivot steering, near-horizontal [...] rear-mounted engine with automatic inlet valve and hot-tube ignition, driving through a <b>constant-mesh</b> gear-train, and final drive by side chains; early models had no reverse gear.|$|E
2500|$|The Bristol SU ("small, underfloor-engined") chassis {{featured}} the same Albion EN250 engine and BMC rear axle as the Albion Nimbus NS3AN with a David Brown overdrive-top five-speed <b>constant-mesh</b> gearbox and a front axle by Kirkstall. [...] The major {{difference from the}} Nimbus was that the radiator was mounted at the extreme front of the chassis. EWT 386C (West Yorkshire's SMA17) was later rebuilt with a Perkins H6.354 5.8-litre engine to test its design {{for use in the}} Bristol LH, which superseded the SU as Bristol's lightweight chassis.|$|E
2500|$|Mercedes {{released}} updated local colectivo chassis, {{a modified}} L 3500 truck chassis – LO3500, OP3500, LO311, LO312, LO 911 (the [...] stands for Omnibus) – with a separately manufactured body fitted later by different coachbuilders. In {{less than a}} decade the output was 6,500 units a year. In 1963 Mercedes built the 10,000nd colectivo (model LO312), and continued with other models, such as L1112 (120 HP), LA1112 (all-wheel traction) and the L1114. The Mercedes-Benz colectivos had truck powerplants, a diesel engine with power transmitted to the rear axle by a five-speed <b>constant-mesh</b> gearbox.|$|E
50|$|A <b>constant-mesh</b> {{transmission}} {{offers several}} advantages over a sliding-mesh design. First, the dog clutch {{is designed for}} the task, rather than asking the gear to do dual duty of power transmission and sliding engagement. Second, the dog clutch is typically smaller in diameter than the gear it controls, so absolute speeds of the engaging parts are lower, aiding engagement. Thus, while a non-synchromesh transmission still relies on the operator to match speeds, gears are easier to engage. Third, a <b>constant-mesh</b> transmission can easily use helical gears which are smoother, quieter, and can carry more torque for a given size of gear. Fourth, a <b>constant-mesh</b> transmission can use synchromesh for easier shifting; while many heavy vehicle transmissions do not use it, most medium- and light-duty automotive transmissions do.|$|E

50|$|With the {{exception}} of the single 1932 tank transporter, all Pioneers purchased by the British Army were equipped with a 102 bhp Gardner 6-cylinder Diesel engine, driving the rear wheels through a <b>constant-mesh</b> gearbox and fitted with a power take-off driving a Scammell winch.|$|E
5000|$|Two {{revisions}} to specification {{which were not}} accompanied by a change in specification number were from 1957 when an Albion five-speed <b>constant-mesh</b> gearbox became an option for manual-transmission chassis and from 1958 when the 105bhp 6.15 litre O375H engine became optional across the range.|$|E
50|$|The Unimog 401 has a Daimler-Benz {{six-speed}} <b>constant-mesh</b> gearbox {{with two}} additional reverse gears.

50|$|The {{engine was}} mounted {{transversely}} and vertically {{as in the}} Dominator, but was a 130 bhp 5.7-litre Perkins T6.354 unit, this drove through the radical Avon Maxwell transmission, an automatic electronically controlled <b>constant-mesh</b> gearbox using small multi-plate clutch units to select drive ratios, this also did the jobs of retarder and angle-drive. The radiator was smaller but like most Dominator derivatives mounted at the front, low down in the frame. Greater Manchester PTE were unique among bus operators {{of the time in}} having (as a result of buying Lancashire United Transport) a wholly owned coachbuilder, the Northern Counties Motor & Engineering Company.

5000|$|Having {{seen that}} {{mechanized}} road transport would present better prospects for making money Searle entered {{business as a}} consultant motor engineer located in the West End of London. In 1905 he was in Paris, France where he represented the Turgan and Lacoste et Battman companies. He sold several Lacoste et Battman chassis to the London and District Motor Omnibus Company, which traded as [...] "Arrow". The Lacoste et Battman buses were unreliable, and suffered frequent breakdowns. Searle was forced to abandon his consultancy when the final part of the order was cancelled due to the unreliability of the vehicles. Arrow took Searle on as a mechanic to keep the fleet of buses on the road. Searle patented and sold to LGOC for £1,000 an ingenious silent roller-chain <b>constant-mesh</b> gearbox.|$|E
5000|$|In 1920 Mr Ashton-Evans {{decided to}} find out what his {{customers}} wanted in an [...] "owner driver's ideal" [...] car and invited opinions. From the response he worked out that the car should have a four-cylinder water cooled engine not exceeding 12 taxable hp and be silent, vibrationless, easy to start and powerful. Gear changing should be silent and without the need to double declutch. There should be room for three people on the front seat. To meet this specification J Bedford designed a new car which became the Ashton 10.5 model, the Ashton-Evans name being temporarily dropped. This had a normal rear axle. Most cars featured -litre, 4-cylinder Coventry Simplex engines and three-speed <b>constant-mesh</b> gearboxes with selection made by dog clutches. Some of the early cars might have had two-cylinder engines. Two- and four-seat open bodies were available.|$|E
5000|$|The {{earliest}} form of {{a manual}} transmission {{is thought to have}} been invented by Joe Clulow and Émile Levassor in the late 19th century. This type of transmission offered multiple gear ratios and, in most cases, reverse. The gears were typically engaged by sliding them on their shafts (hence the phrase shifting gears), which required careful timing and throttle manipulation when shifting, so the gears would be spinning at roughly the same speed when engaged; otherwise, the teeth would refuse to mesh. These transmissions are called sliding mesh transmissions or sometimes crash boxes, because of the difficulty in changing gears and the loud grinding sound that often accompanied. Newer manual transmissions on cars have all gears mesh at all times and are referred to as <b>constant-mesh</b> transmissions, with [...] "synchro-mesh" [...] being a further refinement of the constant mesh principle.|$|E
50|$|The VFR750F models {{all used}} 748 cc 16-valve gear driven DOHC liquid-cooled 90° V4 engines with carburetor-based air/fuel induction; the bore/stroke {{remained}} {{the same for all}} 750 models at 70.0 x 48.6 mm (2.756 x 1.913 inches). The engine was made of cast aluminium alloy with the crankcase being divided horizontally, VFR750P and VFR750K models use slightly different crankcases with the lower casing being modified to allow for the gear position indicator in place of the neutral switch. On all the VFR750 models the gear drive for the cams was between the cylinders. Lubrication was via a wet sump with a chain-driven, dual-rotor oil pump; an oil (air) cooler was also fitted. The transmission was a 6-speed, with a <b>constant-mesh,</b> wet multi-plate clutch and chain drive to the rear wheel {{with the exception of the}} 5-speed VFR750P which had a spacer in place of one of the gears.|$|E
