5|$|The radar {{technology}} was not flawless. It struggled to gauge heights of incoming formations above 25,000 feet {{and could not}} measure their numerical strength. It could also take several minutes to assess the line of advance for aircraft on a zigzag course. Moreover, the radar looked out to sea {{and was unable to}} track aircraft overland. That was the job of the Royal Observer Corps. Tens of thousands of volunteers, the length and breadth of Britain tracked the German formations over land. They were connected to Sector airfields by landline and <b>could</b> <b>communicate</b> intelligence in real time.|$|E
5|$|Ernest {{believed}} he <b>could</b> <b>communicate</b> with both extraterrestrials and historical figures, channeling messages from them. In 1954, seeking to popularize his channeling, Ernest and Ruth formed an organization known as Unarius, operating {{from their home}} in California. After their marriage, Ruth served as Ernest's typist, later claiming to have learned the skill while sleeping. She recorded the information he channeled, writing books about psychic healing and trips into the solar system. In the 1950s and 1960s, they attracted several followers, including two students whom they later taught to channel. One early trainee was Charles Spiegel, who later led the group. Many converts had previous involvement with New Age or mystic groups, making it easy for the Normans to convert them.|$|E
5|$|The magazines, {{situated}} deep {{under the}} casemates, consist of alternating pairs of shell and cartridge rooms accessed via an ammunition passage {{at the front}} and a lighting passage behind. Great care was taken to reduce {{the possibility of an}} accidental explosion. The magazine workers wore special clothes and shoes to eliminate the risk of striking sparks and the floors of the cartridge stores were covered by wooden battens. The lighting was provided from oil lamps situated behind glass windows and accessed only from the lighting passage, which was physically separated {{from the rest of the}} magazine. Sets of lifting gear enabled the workers to winch the cartridges and ammunition up to the casemates, with which they <b>could</b> <b>communicate</b> via voice tubes.|$|E

5|$|Following the accident, Johnson {{suggested}} {{launching the}} D-21 {{from the very}} large Boeing B-52 Stratofortress bomber, and adding a solid rocket booster to get it up to speed. The drone was modified by adding attachment points on its spine to mate with the carrying pylon on the B-52 and its belly attachment points were adapted to accommodate the rocket booster necessary to increase its speed and allow its ramjet to operate. Its vertical stabilizer was increased in size by approximately 20%. The modified drone version was designated D-21B (there was no D-21A). Two B-52Hs were modified to carry a pair of drones each by means of two large underwing pylons that replaced the smaller pylons used for the AGM-28 Hound Dog cruise missiles. The tail gunner's and electronic warfare officer's stations were replaced with two launch control stations. Command and telemetry systems were added, and high-speed cameras were installed to track the drones as they separated from the pylons. The launch control officer on the B-52H <b>could</b> <b>communicate</b> with the D-21Bs, and could make it self-destruct.|$|E
5|$|Siglinda Scarpa {{says she}} had issues with {{communication}} as a child, stating that “people were not seeing me, that they were talking, but never to me.” It was not until her father brought a stray kitten home and placed it under her sheets that Scarpa felt she <b>could</b> <b>communicate</b> with someone. The kitten was a year old when he became very ill and died. After his death, Scarpa decided to take in as many cats as possible, with the hopes of eventually creating {{a safe haven for}} cats. Scarpa created the Goathouse Refuge in 2007, naming it after an old goat who came with the dilapidated plantation house and the 16 acre property. Originally, the land was just intended for her pottery studio. After the house and studio burned down Scarpa rebuilt it with plans that included a sanctuary for cats, using personal resources and proceeds from her pottery sales to make it possible.|$|E
5|$|The final {{official}} designation, assigned in 1938, was PanzerkampfwagenI (M.G.) {{with special}} ordnance number Sd.Kfz. 101. The first 150 tanks (1./LaS, 1st series LaS, Krupp-Traktor), produced in 1934, {{did not include}} the rotating turret and were used for crew training. Following these, production was switched to the combat version of the tank. The Ausf.A was under-armoured, with steel plate of only 13millimeters (0.51in) at its thickest. The tank had several design flaws, including suspension problems, which made the vehicle pitch at high velocities, and engine overheating. The driver was positioned inside the chassis and used conventional steering levers to control the tank, while the commander was positioned in the turret where he also acted as gunner. The two crewmen <b>could</b> <b>communicate</b> by means of a voice tube. Machine gun ammunition was stowed in five bins, containing various numbers of 25-round magazines. 1,190 of the Panzerkampfwagen I Ausf. A were built in three series (2.-4./LaS). Further 25 were built as command tanks.|$|E

25|$|Colin M. Turnbull, an American anthropologist, wrote a {{book about}} the Efé Pygmies, The Forest People, in 1965. This {{introduced}} Mbuti culture to Western countries.

25|$|In December 2004, {{the first}} survey of {{language}} {{use in the}} People's Republic of China revealed that only 53% of its population, about 700 million people, <b>could</b> <b>communicate</b> in Standard Chinese.

25|$|These {{systems could}} use the old {{electromechanical}} signaling methods inherited from crossbar and step-by-step switches.

This data link was based on CCITT 6, a predecessor to SS7.|$|E

25|$|In 1668 he {{published}} his Essay towards a Real Character and a Philosophical Language.

25|$|The most {{difficult}} aspect of close support was communication. Air-ground liaison officers {{had been used}} since 1935, when the Luftwaffe first set up a training program for this purpose. By 1937, precise procedures {{had yet to be}} worked through for air to ground coordination. Staff officers were trained to solve operational problems, and the lack of doctrine and reluctance of the Oberkommando der Luftwaffe (OKL = High Command of the Air Force) to micromanage gave Sperrle and Richthofen a free hand to devise solutions. Aircraft could not communicate with the frontline. Instead they <b>could</b> <b>communicate</b> via radio with each other and their home base. One of the first innovations was to prepare signals staff on the frontline in the region of any planned air strikes, and equip them with telephones. The forward officers could telephone the base with updates, who in turn could radio the aircraft. It became an important standard operational practice. Liaison officers were attached to the Nationalist Army, and improved coordination continued {{in the second half of}} 1937 despite occasional friendly-fire incidents. In the Second World War, the Luftwaffe air units and liaison officers at the front <b>could</b> <b>communicate</b> directly with updated radios.|$|E

25|$|In the {{computer}} game , it is hinted that the palantír of Osgiliath was not lost, but recovered by Sauron {{and sent to}} Carn Dûm so he <b>could</b> <b>communicate</b> with the Witch-king of Angmar or his Steward, Mordirith. When the player successfully attacks Mordirith, the palantír gets stolen by Amarthiel, who takes it to Annúminas. The player then has to steal the palantír, after which it disappears out of the plot, safely kept away. An unusual feature {{of this is the}} actual stealing and moving of the palantír of Osgiliath, which was, in the books, supposedly the largest one.|$|E
25|$|After the crisis, the U.S. and the Soviet Union {{created the}} Moscow–Washington hotline, a direct {{communications}} link between Moscow and Washington.

The worldwide U.S. Forces DEFCON 3 status was returned to DEFCON 4 on November 20, 1962. U-2 pilot Anderson's body was returned to the US and was buried with full military honors in South Carolina. He was the first recipient of the newly created Air Force Cross, which was awarded posthumously.|$|E
25|$|The picture target {{experiments}} that {{were conducted by}} Krippner and Ullman were criticized by C. E. M. Hansel.

Only the agent should have known the target and no other person until the judging of targets had been completed, however, an experimenter was with the agent when the target envelope was opened. Hansel also wrote there had been poor controls in the experiment as the main experimenter <b>could</b> <b>communicate</b> with the subject.|$|E
