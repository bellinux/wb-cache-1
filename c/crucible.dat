5|$|<b>Crucible</b> {{steel is}} steel {{that has been}} melted in a <b>crucible</b> rather than having been forged, {{with the result that}} it is more homogeneous. Most {{previous}} furnaces could not reach high enough temperatures to melt the steel. The early modern <b>crucible</b> steel industry resulted from the invention of Benjamin Huntsman in the 1740s. Blister steel (made as above) was melted in a <b>crucible</b> or in a furnace, and cast (usually) into ingots.|$|E
5|$|At the <b>Crucible</b> O'Sullivan {{defeated}} Marcus Campbell in {{the last}} 32, Ali Carter {{in the last}} 16, Stuart Bingham in the quarter-finals. He reached the final without falling behind even once, and defeated Barry Hawkins 18–12 to win his fifth world title. O'Sullivan's break of 103 in the 15th frame was his 128th century break at the <b>Crucible</b> Theatre, breaking Stephen Hendry's record of 127 <b>Crucible</b> centuries. During the final he extended the record to 131 century breaks. O'Sullivan became the only player to score six century breaks in a World Championship final. He also became only the third player to retain his title at the <b>Crucible</b> after Steve Davis and Stephen Hendry.|$|E
5|$|Sheffield has {{two large}} theatres, the Lyceum Theatre and the <b>Crucible</b> Theatre, which {{together}} with the smaller Studio Theatre make up the largest theatre complex outside London, located in Tudor Square. The <b>Crucible</b> Theatre is the home (since 1977) of the World Snooker Championships and hosts many well-known stage productions throughout the year. The Lyceum, which opened in 1897, serves as a venue for touring West End productions and operas by Opera North, as well as locally produced shows. Sheffield also has the Montgomery Theatre, a small 420 seater theatre located {{a short distance from}} Tudor Square, opposite the town hall on Surrey Street. There are also a large number of smaller amateur theatres scattered throughout the city.|$|E
50|$|Smelting and melting {{of copper}} and its alloys such as leaded bronze were smelted in <b>crucibles</b> {{similar to those}} of the Roman period which have thinner walls and flat bases to sit within the furnaces. The {{technology}} for this type of smelting started to change at the end of the Medieval period with the introduction of new tempering material for the ceramic <b>crucibles.</b> Some of these copper alloy <b>crucibles</b> were used in the making of bells. Bell foundry <b>crucibles</b> had to be larger at about 60 cm (Tylecote 1976: p73). These later medieval <b>crucibles</b> were a more mass-produced product.|$|R
50|$|By {{the late}} Medieval period steel {{production}} {{had moved from}} India to modern-day Uzbekistan where new materials were {{being used in the}} production of steel <b>crucibles,</b> for example Mullite <b>crucibles</b> were introduced. These were sandy clay <b>crucibles</b> which had been formed around a fabric tube. These <b>crucibles</b> are used {{in the same way as}} other cementation vessels but with a hole in the top of the vessel to allow pressure to escape.|$|R
50|$|<b>Crucibles</b> {{and their}} covers {{are made of}} high temperature-resistant materials, usually porcelain, alumina or an inert metal. One of the {{earliest}} uses of platinum was to make <b>crucibles.</b> Ceramics such as alumina, zirconia, and especially magnesia will tolerate the highest temperatures. More recently, metals such as nickel and zirconium have been used. The lids are typically loose-fitting to allow gases to escape during heating of a sample inside. <b>Crucibles</b> and their lids can come in high form and low form shapes and in various sizes, but rather small 10-15 ml size porcelain <b>crucibles</b> are commonly used for gravimetric chemical analysis. These small size <b>crucibles</b> and their covers made of porcelain are quite cheap when sold in quantity to laboratories, and the <b>crucibles</b> are sometimes disposed of after use in precise quantitative chemical analysis. There is usually a large mark-up when they are sold individually in hobby shops.|$|R
5|$|Sometimes thorium is {{extracted}} by electrolysis of a fluoride {{in a mixture}} of sodium and potassium chloride at 700–800°C in a graphite <b>crucible.</b> Highly pure thorium can be extracted from its iodide with the crystal bar process.|$|E
5|$|Using {{an alcohol}} lamp, Wöhler heated {{alternating}} layers of beryllium chloride and potassium in a wired-shut platinum <b>crucible.</b> The above reaction immediately took place and caused the <b>crucible</b> to become white hot. Upon cooling and washing the resulting gray-black powder {{he saw that}} it was made of fine particles with a dark metallic luster. The highly reactive potassium had been produced by the electrolysis of its compounds, a process discovered 21 years before. The chemical method using potassium yielded only small grains of beryllium from which no ingot of metal could be cast or hammered.|$|E
5|$|Crucibles used {{to contain}} {{plutonium}} {{need to be}} able to withstand its strongly reducing properties. Refractory metals such as tantalum and tungsten along with the more stable oxides, borides, carbides, nitrides and silicides can tolerate this. Melting in an electric arc furnace can be used to produce small ingots of the metal without the need for a <b>crucible.</b>|$|E
30|$|After the incubation, undigested {{samples were}} {{filtered}} in pre-dried and weighed glass filter <b>crucibles</b> containing 500  mg of Celite as filter aid using the Fibertec System (Fibertec System 1021 Cold Extractor, Tecator, Hӧganӓs, Sweden). The test flasks were rinsed twice by distilled water. Undigested samples in glass filter <b>crucibles</b> were rinsed twice with 10  mL of 95  % ethanol and 99.5  % acetone. Then, glass filter <b>crucibles</b> with undigested samples were dried at 130  °C for 6  h. After 1  h cooling in a desiccator, glass filter <b>crucibles</b> were weighed.|$|R
30|$|<b>Crucibles</b> {{were first}} washed, dried, incinerated (550  °C for 2  h), cooled in desiccator, and weighed. Samples {{were added to}} <b>crucibles,</b> weighed, {{and placed in a}} muffle furnace (250  °C for 2  h). Temperature was then raised to 550  °C and samples were left overnight. After cooling in a desiccator, <b>crucibles</b> with samples were again weighed and ash content calculated.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the influence of}} <b>crucibles</b> {{on the development of}} leadership capability. To do this, it analyses and interprets relevant comments relating to how Northland community leaders’ calling, character and competence developed, through surviving and thriving (Surthriving) overwhelming ordeals in their lives. This thesis did not set out to prove or challenge extant leadership and experiential learning theories or leadership praxis. It simply asked 2 ̆ 2 How do <b>crucibles</b> influence Northland community leaders’ calling, character, and competence? 2 ̆ 2 With this end in mind, the writer undertook phenomenological research to interview 20 community leaders living in Northland, a low socio-economic region in New Zealand. Interview data was analysed and interpreted using a mixed research methodology to identify themes of how leadership capability develops through experientially learning from <b>crucibles.</b> Interpretation of these themes produced interesting findings. First, <b>crucibles</b> usually influenced research respondents’ calling to either serve others or become more self-aware of their own leadership calling in life. Second, <b>crucibles</b> usually influenced respondents’ character to either be the best at whatever they did, or influenced how they behaved in their relationships with people. Third, <b>crucibles</b> usually influenced respondents’ leadership competence to either draw from their own aptitudes and skills, or from external resources to strengthen their leadership competence. Fourth, respondents’ self-awareness and communication with people was the attribute most frequently influenced by <b>crucibles</b> on leadership calling, character, and competence. Fifth, <b>crucibles</b> influenced respondents’ leadership calling, character, or competence and the relationships between these elements in an interdependent manner. The research showed <b>crucibles</b> triggered significant personal insights that encouraged respondents to perceive their problems more as personal development opportunities than as insurmountable obstacles. The sixth and perhaps most significant finding is that <b>crucibles</b> influenced all respondents’ will to survive their ordeals, whilst some even thrived because of them. The most common <b>crucibles</b> involved family relationships, job and, death which were unpredictably forced upon them. These themes led the writer to develop the Surthrive concept, which is an experiential learning process that shows how <b>crucibles</b> influence leaders to reflectively think about their calling in life, character, and competence by reflecting on their <b>crucibles.</b> The writer hopes the Surthrive concept will provide an effective approach for developing leadership capability in rapidly changing circumstances and positively benefit society throughout the 21 st century and beyond...|$|R
5|$|Further, {{two of her}} father's {{brothers}} had also married their cousins: Prativa Devi Choudhury, wife of Ashutosh Choudhary, {{was the daughter of}} Hemendranath Tagore, and Indira Devi Choudhary, wife of Promatho Choudhary, was the daughter of Satyendranath Tagore. Devika thus had strong ties to Jarasanko, seat of the Tagore family in Kolkata and a major <b>crucible</b> of the Bengali renaissance.|$|E

40|$|The {{suitability}} of local quartz {{sand in the}} production of bath <b>crucibles</b> is a study that was carried out in order to impart overall strength on bath <b>crucibles</b> hence reduce breakages during fettling. Therefore this research constitutes a study to enhance the efficiency of production of bath <b>crucibles</b> by addition of quartz sand in slip preparation. The steps taken in the beneficiation of quartz sand for the production of bath <b>crucibles</b> are comminution which entails crushing and milling classification washing liquid dispersion sizing and reduction of iron content by magnetic separation. The slip contains materials like plastic clay feldspar kaolin talc sodium silicate water quartz sand etc. These were all milled in the ball mill for slip production casting and fettling glazing and sintering to get final bath <b>crucibles</b> as the end products. Quartz sand is used in a variety of products essentially as raw material for the foundry casting and glass industries and also in chemicals water filtration and ceramics the heat resistance nature of quartz sand makes it an excellent refractory substance for these industrial processes. Slip can be prepared for production of bath <b>crucibles</b> without the inclusion of quartz sand however the addition of quartz sand is needed to improve the mechanical performance of the slip {{in the production of}} bath <b>crucibles...</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{immediate}} {{result of}} the research {{was the creation of}} the new material cerium sulfide (CeS), from which they made several hundred <b>crucibles</b> for use at Los Alamos National Laboratory. Brewer's <b>crucibles</b> were ready when the plutonium became available.|$|R

40|$|<b>Crucibles</b> {{from the}} German region of Hesse have been famous since the Middle Ages {{due to their}} {{exceptional}} quality, regarded by many as a mystery. We analyzed 50 Hessian and non-Hessian archeological <b>crucibles</b> using SEM-EDS, FESEM, and XRD to investigate their technology and material properties. It was revealed that Hessian <b>crucibles</b> were systematically made of kaolinitic clay with a low flux content, mixed with quartz sand, and fired to temperatures in excess of 1300 °C. Primary mullite developed {{in most of the}} glass matrix, with secondary mullite in some regions of clay–feldspar relict mixtures. Consequently, the vessels showed superior creep and thermal shock resistance, high-temperature strength, and thermal and chemical refractoriness. These <b>crucibles</b> represent the earliest industrial exploitation of mullite in Europe, which explains their historical success...|$|R
