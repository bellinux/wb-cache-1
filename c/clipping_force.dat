The present study investigated the role of Nrf 2 in upregulating of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) activity, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), and MMP- 9 after SCI. Wild-type Nrf 2 (+/+) and Nrf 2 -deficient (Nrf (−/−)) mice were subjected to an SCI model induced by the application of vascular <b>clips</b> (<b>force</b> of 10 [*]g) to the dura after a three-level T 8 -T 10 laminectomy.

50|$|To {{fasten the}} binding, the spring {{assembly}} was lifted, sliding on a plastic disk. After being raised slightly it could move forward, releasing all {{tension on the}} clips. A metal clip prevented it from moving under the boot area, while also acting as a mounting spot for a safety strap. The boot could then be forced onto the angled upper area of the <b>clips,</b> <b>forcing</b> them to open outward, and then fastened by pushing the spring back down to re-apply tension. Step-in action in the S-2/3/4 series was accomplished by a small spring-loaded pin catch on the cams. When the spring assembly was lifted, the pin was forced upward into a hole on the T-arm running to the spring, holding it forward. When the skier stepped in, the pin would be pushed down and release the arm, springing the clips closed. The S-9 model improved on this using a large lever over the spring assembly that released spring pressure by pushing the spring forward when it was pushed down with a ski pole. The lever also had a finger that pressed up on the sole of the boot, helping it pop open the clips. This gave the system true step-in, step-out behaviour.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Inflammation {{plays an}} {{important}} role in the pathogenesis of secondary damage after spinal cord injury (SCI). The present study explored the effect of sulforaphane (SFN), a potent anti-inflammatory extract of cruciferous vegetables, on the expression of two inflammatory mediators, metalloproteinase (MMP) - 9 and TNF-α, in a murine model of SCI. Murine spinal cord injury was induced by the application of vascular <b>clips</b> (<b>force</b> of 10 g) to the dura after a three-level T 8 -T 10 laminectomy. The wet/dry weight ratio was used to reflect the percentage of water content of impaired spinal cord tissue at 48 hr after SCI. The mRNA levels of MMP- 9 were determined using the reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and protein levels of TNF-α and MMP- 9 were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) at 24 hr after SCI. Gelatin zymography was used to determine MMP- 9 activity of spinal cord tissue at 24 hr after SCI. Mice treated with SFN at 1 hr after SCI had lower expression and activity of MMP- 9 compared to mice with SCI. The decrease of MMP- 9 in mice treated with SFN was associated with decreased levels of spinal cord water content and TNF-α. In summary, suforaphane decreases MMP- 9 and TNF-α expression and vascular permeability changes following spinal cord injury in mice...|$|R
40|$|Continuous {{welded rail}} (CWR) is a {{fundamental}} component of any modern track structure and has several advantages over former types of rail joining processes. The reduction in maintenance and related costs {{has become the most}} attractive property of CWR although careful monitoring and maintenance of CWR is essential to ensure safe train operations. Management of the stress-free temperature (SFT) of any section of CWR in order to prevent rail breaks and lateral buckling that could lead to derailments is a vital duty of the track maintenance team. Variations in the SFT are influenced by a number of external factors. This paper describes experimental field and laboratory tests carried out to investigate to what extent the fastening strength influences the variation in SFT in CWR track on Fist fastenings and two types of pads. The research established a nonlinear relationship between clamping force and rail movement through the fasteners as well as a strongly linear relationship between clamping force and the variation in SFT. It is also demonstrated that although the friction coefficient of the pad has an influence on rail movement through the fastener, the primary factor influencing SFT variations is the <b>clip</b> <b>force.</b> This paper concludes by quantifying the relationship between clamping force and the expected variation in SFT with clear guidelines on the management of the SFT in CWR.

40|$|Background: Primary {{traumatic}} {{mechanical injury}} to the spinal cord (SCI) causes {{the death of a}} number of neurons that to date can neither be recovered nor regenerated. During the last years our group has been involved in the design, synthesis and evaluation of PDE 7 inhibitors as new innovative drugs for several neurological disorders. Our working hypothesis is based on two different facts. Firstly, neuroinflammation is modulated by cAMP levels, thus the key role for phosphodiesterases (PDEs), which hydrolyze cAMP, is undoubtedly demonstrated. On the other hand, PDE 7 is expressed simultaneously on leukocytes and on the brain, highlighting the potential crucial role of PDE 7 as drug target for neuroinflammation. Methodology/Principal Findings: Here we present two chemically diverse families of PDE 7 inhibitors, designed using computational techniques such as virtual screening and neuronal networks. We report their biological profile and their efficacy in an experimental SCI model induced by the application of vascular <b>clips</b> (<b>force</b> of 24 g) to the dura via a four-level T 5 –T 8 laminectomy. We have selected two candidates, namely S 14 and VP 1. 15, as PDE 7 inhibitors. These compounds increase cAMP production both in macrophage and neuronal cell lines. Regarding drug-like properties, compounds were able to cross the blood brain barrier using parallel artificial membranes (PAMPA) methodology.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Olprinone {{hydrochloride}} is a {{newly developed}} compound that selectively inhibits PDE type III and {{is characterized by}} several properties, including positive inotropic effects, peripheral vasodilatory effects, and a bronchodilator effect. In clinical settings, olprinone is commonly used to treat congestive cardiac failure, due to its inotropic and vasodilating effects. The mechanism of these cardiac effects is attributed to increased cellular concentrations of cAMP. The aim {{of the present study}} was to evaluate the pharmacological action of olprinone on the secondary damage in experimental spinal cord injury (SCI) in mice. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Traumatic SCI is characterized by an immediate, irreversible loss of tissue at the lesion site, as well as a secondary expansion of tissue damage over time. Although secondary injury should be preventable, no effective treatment options currently exist for patients with SCI. Spinal cord trauma was induced in mice by the application of vascular <b>clips</b> (<b>force</b> of 24 g) to the dura via a four-level T 5 -T 8 laminectomy. SCI in mice resulted in severe trauma characterized by edema, neutrophil infiltration, and production of inflammatory mediators, tissue damage, apoptosis, and locomotor disturbance. Olprinone treatment (0. 2 mg/kg, i. p.) 1 and 6 h after the SCI significantly reduced: (1) the degree of spinal cord inflammation and tissue injury (histological score), (2) neutrophil infiltration (myeloperoxidase activity), (3) nitrotyrosine formation, (4) pro-inflammatory cytokines, (5) NF-kappaB expression, (6) p-ERK 1 / 2 and p 38 expression and (7) apoptosis (TUNEL staining, FAS ligand, Bax and Bcl- 2 expression). Moreover, olprinone significantly ameliorated the recovery of hind-limb function (evaluated by motor recovery score). CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Taken together, our results clearly demonstrate that olprinone treatment reduces the development of inflammation and tissue injury associated with spinal cord trauma...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Palmitoylethanolamide (PEA) is an {{endogenous}} {{fatty acid}} amide displaying anti-inflammatory and analgesic actions. Moreover, several data have suggested that PEA reduced inflammation and tissue injury associated with spinal cord trauma and showed a regulatory role for peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) -α signaling in the neuroprotective effect of PEA. However, several other mechanisms could explain the anti-inflammatory and anti-hyperalgesic effects of PEA, including the activation of PPAR-δ and PPAR-γ. The aim {{of the present study}} was to carefully investigate the exact contribution of PPAR-δ and PPAR-γ in addition to PPAR-α, in the protective effect of PEA on secondary inflammatory damage associated with an experimental model of spinal cord injury (SCI). Methods SCI was induced in mice through a spinal cord compression by the application of vascular <b>clips</b> (<b>force</b> of 24 g) to the dura via a four-level T 5 to T 8 laminectomy, and PEA (10 mg/kg, intraperitoneally, 1 and 6 hours after SCI) was injected into wildtype mice and into mice lacking PPAR-α (PPAR-αKO). To deepen the ability of specific PPAR-δ and PPAR-γ antagonists to reverse the effect of PEA, mice were administered GSK 0660 or GW 9662, 30 minutes before PEA injection. Results Genetic ablation of PPAR-α in mice exacerbated spinal cord damage, while PEA-induced neuroprotection seemed be abolished in PPARαKO mice. Twenty-four hours after spinal cord damage, immunohistological and biochemical studies were performed on spinal cord tissue. Our results indicate that PPAR-δ and PPAR-γ also mediated the protection induced by PEA. In particular, PEA was less effective in PPAR-αKO, GSK 0660 -treated or GW 9662 -pretreated mice, as evaluated by the degree of spinal cord inflammation and tissue injury, neutrophil infiltration, proinflammmatory cytokine, inducible nitric oxide synthase expression and motor function. PEA is also able to restore PPAR-δ and PPAR-γ expression in spinal cord tissue. Conclusion This study indicates that PPAR-δ and PPAR-γ can also contribute to the anti-inflammatory activity of PEA in SCI. </p...|$|R

40|$|Many {{studies have}} been {{conducted}} {{to examine the effects of}} displayed violence in digital games on outcomes like aggressive behavior and physiological arousal. However, they often lack a proper manipulation of the relevant factors and control of confounding variables. In this study, the displayed violence and game speed of a recent first-person shooter game were varied systematically using the technique of modding, so that effects could be explained properly by the respective manipulations. Aggressive behavior was measured with the standardized version of the Competitive Reaction Time Task or CRTT (Ferguson et al., 2008. Physiological arousal was operationalized with four measurements: galvanic skin response (GSR), heart rate (HR), body movement, force on mouse and keyboard. A total of N = 87 participants played in one of four game conditions (low- vs. high-violence, normal- vs. high speed) while physiological measurements were taken with finger <b>clips,</b> <b>force</b> sensors on input devices (mouse and keyboard), and a Nintendo Wii balance board on the chair they sat on. After play, their aggressive behavior was measured with the CRTT. The results of the study do not support the hypothesis that playing digital games increases aggressive behavior. There were no significant differences in GSR and HR, but with a higher game speed, participants showed less overall body movement, most likely to meet the game’s higher demands on cognitive and motor capacities. Also, higher game speed and displayed violence caused an increase in applied force on mouse and keyboard. Previous experience with digital games did not moderate any of these findings. Moreover, it provides further evidence that the CRTT should only be used in a standardized way as a measurement for aggression, if at all. Using all 7 different published (though not validated) ways to calculate levels of aggression from the raw data, “evidence” was found that playing a violent digital game increases, decreases, or does not change aggression at all. Thus, the present study does extend previous research. Firstly, it shows the methodological advantages of modding in digital game research to accomplish the principles of psychological (laboratory) experiments by manipulating relevant variables and controlling all others. It also demonstrates the test-theoretical problems of the highly diverse use of the CRTT. It provides evidence that for a meaningful interpretation of effects of displayed violence in digital games, there are other game characteristics that should be controlled for since they might have an effect on relevant outcome variables. Further research needs to identify more of those game features, and it should also improve the understanding of the different measures for physiological arousal and their interrelatedness...|$|R

This paper proposes a toe-gap force measure-ment as {{an evaluation of the}} lower limb muscular power for this purpose. The effectiveness of the method is examined from the viewpoints of anatomy, comparison with the conventional measurement method and practically useful method. In the proposed method, the <b>clipping</b> toe-gap <b>force</b> is measured between the great toe and the digitus secundus. The toe-gap force in this situation, is generated by the collaboration of the flexor tensor muscles of the lower limb, which are supposed to have roles in the effort against falling. The measure-ment device has a structure similar to the grip dynamometer, and the toe-gap force is displayed by a mechanical structure. As to the physical strength against falling, 153 subjects were tested and results were compared to the indication of the proposed device. It is seen that the measured toe-gap force is closely related to the physical strength of the lower limb examined the general examination.

The original Rottefella eliminated the heel strap, which held the boot forward in the binding, by drilling small holes in the sole of the boot which fit into pins in the toe piece. This would only work if the sole was held very firmly down on the pins, so the binding also introduced a metal <b>clip</b> that was <b>forced</b> down onto the top of the sole of the boot, forcing it onto the pins. When the inventor, Bror With, won a race on the new design, Norwegian Crown Prince Olav ask him what they were, and he responded [...] "Oh, they're just a couple of rat traps I picked up at the hardware store".

However, if the force was also to the front, {{as in the case of}} the ski tip catching a tree root or front of a mogul, the pivot would be too close to the line of motion to allow easy rotation. To address this, the entire body of the binding was also pivoted.

Receivers are equipped with features to allow the CTCSS [...] "lock" [...] to be disabled. On USA licensed systems, Federal Communications Commission rules require CTCSS users on shared channels to disable their receiver's CTCSS to check if co-channel users are talking before transmitting. On a base station console, a microphone may have a split push-to-talk button. Pressing {{one half of the}} button, (often marked with a speaker icon or the letters [...] "MON", short for [...] "MONitor") disables the CTCSS decoder and reverts the receiver to hearing any signal on the channel.

This interlock option is referred to as compulsory monitor before transmit (the user is forced to monitor by the hardware design of the equipment itself). On mobile radios, the microphone is usually stored in a hang-up clip or a hang-up box containing a microphone clip.

Morphological analyses were performed by LM and EM. The Sham group did not show any morphofunctional alteration. All SCI animals showed flaccid paralysis 24 h after injury. with subsequent improvement. The BMS score of the SCI group improved until the intermediate phase (2. 037 +/- 1. 198) : the Sham animals maintained the highest BMS score (8. 981 +/- 0. 056). p < 0. 001 during the entire time. The locomotor speed was slower in the SCI animals (5. 581 +/- 0. 871) than in the Sham animals (15. 80 +/- 1. 166), p < 0. 001. Morphological analysis of the SCI group showed, in the acute phase, edema, hemorrhage, multiple cavities, fiber degeneration, cell death and demyelination. In the chronic phase we observed glial scarring, neuron death, and remyelination of spared axons by oligodendrocytes and Schwann cells. In conclusion, we established a simple, reliable, and inexpensive clip compression model in mice, with functional and morphological reproducibility and good validity.

Force and torque sensor {{are based on the}} following working principle: the elastic deformation of a structure caused by external forces or torques is measured. Therefore, the strain {{on the surface of the}} structure is measured with strain gauges. During this work, platinum strain gauges were manufactured and characterized for different applications. Multiple strain gauges were additionally grouped on sensor foils and were combined to form measurement circuits. Moreover, the strain gauges on the sensor foils can be aligned more precisely to each other than single strain gauges. Application-specific sensor foils therefore help to meet the demands of the measurement task in the best possible way. The miniaturized strain gauges for the sensor foil were produced on a polyimide substrate. They have a gauge factor of k = 3 and show a linear temperature coefficient of a = 2. 5 • 10 - 3 K- 1. The metal resistor has a length of 1. 23 mm and a width of 0. 84 mm. Furthermore a special assembly technique for the strain gauges was developed. Additionally, the sensors can be sterilized with hot steam for 30 times. Sensor foils for three different applications were developed and tested. In the first application, a 190 mm long milling tool for the removal of femoral bone cement in revision total hip replacement was realized. A sensor foil on the shaft measured the deformation of the tool in reaction to the milling forces. This information can be used for position correction in navigated surgery. The second application is a sensor <b>clip</b> for uniaxial <b>force</b> measurement on surgical tools. The sensor clip can be attached on various instruments with a quick mount. The sensor clip allows it to measure intra-operational forces acting on the instrument. The sensor clip is capable of measuring forces reproducibly. This was shown on test structures. The third application is a universal force and torque sensor. With this sensor it is possible to measure forces in all spatial directions and also measure the torques around the axes. The working principle of this sensor was shown. Besides the platinum strain gauges, piezoresistive silicon strain gauges were designed and manufactured. The piezoresistors were structured by reactive ion etching of the 2 µm thick device layer of a SOI wafer. By this method, the resistor is fully isolated by the buried oxide and the surrounding air. Ultrasonic flip-chip bonding connects the sensors with gold stud bumps to a flexible circuit board. On these circuit boards, the piezoresistive strain gauges can be connected to sensor foils again. The piezoresistive sensors have a gauge factor of k = 70 and a temperature coefficient of a = 3. 6 • 10 - 3 K- 1...|$|R
