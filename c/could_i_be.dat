500|$|One filmed {{scene from}} [...] "Mamma Mia" [...] was cut {{out from the}} airing. Instead, the scene was {{featured}} on 30 Rocks season three DVD {{as part of the}} deleted scenes in the Bonus feature. In the scene, NBC page Kenneth Parcell (Jack McBrayer) gives George Park, Fred O'Dwyer, and Milton Greene a tour around the backstage area of TGS. Fred tells Kenneth that he resembles a man he served with in the service, which Kenneth says [...] "Well, obviously that's a coincidence. How <b>could</b> <b>I</b> <b>be</b> in Normandy?". Fred responds by saying that he never told Kenneth where he served. Jack shows up where Kenneth and the three men are, and tells Kenneth {{that he would like to}} talk to Milton, prompting Kenneth to tell Jack [...] "As head of this tour, I'm going to deny your request." [...] Jack and Milton are then seen at Jack's office.|$|E
500|$|Jyoti Singh {{was born}} and raised in Delhi while her parents were from a small village in the Ballia {{district}} of Uttar Pradesh. Her father sold his ancestral land to educate her, and worked double shifts to continue to pay for her schooling. In an interview he related that as a youth he had dreamed of becoming a school teacher, but at that time education was not considered important and girls were not even sent to school. [...] "Attitudes are changing back home now, but when I left 30 years ago, I vowed never deny my children so sending them to school was fulfilling my desire for knowledge." [...] He said that he put his daughter's education above that of even his two sons. [...] "It never entered our hearts to ever discriminate. How <b>could</b> <b>I</b> <b>be</b> happy if my son is happy and my daughter isn't? And it was impossible to refuse a little girl who loved going to school." ...|$|E

2500|$|Files in Ireland's National Archives, {{released}} to the public in 2006, feature a request from Maeve Binchy to President Cearbhall Ó Dálaigh asking if he could [...] "receive" [...] her. She wrote, [...] "I know you are extremely busy but I often see in the paper that you 'received' so-and-so and was wondering very simply <b>could</b> <b>I</b> <b>be</b> received too." [...] This request came while she was working for The Irish Times in London in 1975.|$|E
2500|$|She {{also made}} the cover of Rolling Stone for a record-setting sixth time. Mad Love entered the Billboard Album Chart in the Top Five its first week (a record at that time) and climbed to the number 3 position. The project {{continued}} her streak of Top 10 hits with [...] "How Do I Make You?", originally recorded by Billy Thermal, and [...] "Hurt So Bad", originally a Top 10 hit for Little Anthony & the Imperials. The album earned Ronstadt a 1980 Grammy Award nomination for Best Rock Vocal Performance/Female (although she lost to Pat Benatar's Crimes of Passion album). Benatar praised Ronstadt by stating, [...] "There {{are a lot of}} good female singers around. How <b>could</b> <b>I</b> <b>be</b> the best? Ronstadt is still alive!" ...|$|E
2500|$|In October 1980, Julia Cave and a {{team from}} the BBC arrived in Abydos to film the {{documentary}} Omm Sety and Her Egypt. Featuring interviews with Egyptologists T. G. H. James and Rosalie David, it described Abydos and the excavations that had been undertaken. It had extensive input from Omm Sety, who used crutches due to her deteriorating health. The documentary was broadcast on BBC 2 in May 1981. The Times wrote of the documentary: [...] "An incredulous smile froze on my lips as I watched the Chronicle film Omm Sety and Her Egypt. <b>Could</b> <b>I</b> <b>be</b> absolutely positive {{it was all a}} lot of eyewash? Of course I couldn't. And neither will you be able to. In any case, it makes marvellous television." [...] At the time the BBC were recording their documentary, the American producer Miriam Birch asked Omm Sety to appear, along with Egyptologists Kent Weeks and Lanny Bell, in a documentary that National Geographic Channel was filming, Egypt: Quest for Eternity. It concentrated on Rameses II, the son of Seti I. Shooting took place in March 1981, coinciding with Omm Sety's seventy-seventh birthday party at Chicago House, which was filmed. She was {{in a lot of pain}} but full of good cheer, and the film crew carried her up to the Temple of Seti for filming. This was to be her last visit to the shrine in which she believed she had served as a priestess 3,000 years before.|$|E
