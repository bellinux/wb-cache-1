40|$|In winter {{oilseed rape}} {{experiments}} at Rothamsted in 2000 / 01 to 2002 / 03 growing seasons, {{the severity of}} phoma stem canker epidemics in summer depended on the timing of phoma leaf spot epidemics in the previous autumn, and hence on the timing of Leptosphaeria maculans ascospore release. The first major release of L. maculans ascospores was earlier in 2000 (26 September) and 2001 (18 September) than in 2002 (21 October). Consequently, the autumn phoma leaf spot epidemic was also earlier in 2000 and 2001 than in 2002. The resulting stem canker epidemics were severe by harvest (July) in 2001 and 2002 but not in 2003. No correlation {{was found between the}} severity or duration of phoma leaf spotting (lesion days or lesion ??<b>C-days)</b> and the subsequent severity of phoma stem canker epidemics. Rates of leaf production and loss were similar in the three growing seasons. Out of ca. 25 leaves produced on plants during each season, leaf numbers 10 ??? 14 generally remained on plants for the longest. Treatment with flusilazole + carbendazim in autumn decreased the severity of phoma leaf spotting for several weeks after treatment, decreased the severity of stem canker the following summer and increased yield significantly in 2001 and 2002 but not in 2003. The most effective timings for flusilazole + carbendazim application were when leaves 7 ??? 11 were present on most plants and at least 10 % of plants were affected by phoma leaf spot. Two half-dose applications of fungicide reduced phoma stem canker and increased yield more than a single full dose application when phoma leaf spot epidemics were early (< 800 ??<b>C-days</b> after sowing) ...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe Drake Landing Solar Community in Okotoks, Alberta, Canada {{utilizes}} a {{solar thermal}} system with borehole seasonal storage to supply space heating to 52 detached energy-efficient homes through a district heating network. Systems of similar size and configuration {{have been constructed}} in Europe, however, {{this is the first}} system of this type designed to supply more than 90 % of the space heating with solar energy and the first operating in such a cold climate (5200 degree <b>C-days).</b> Solar heat captured in 2293 m 2 of flat-plate collectors, mounted on the roofs of detached garages, is stored in soil underground and later when needed for space heating, is extracted and distributed through a district system to each home in the subdivision. Independent solar domestic hot water systems installed on every house are designed to supply more than 50 % of the water heating load. Annual greenhouse gas emission reductions from energy efficiency improvements and solar energy supply exceed 5 tonnes per house. The seasonal storage utilizes approximately 34, 000 m 3 of earth and a grid of 144 boreholes with single u-tube heat exchangers. The system is configured to maintain the centre of the field at the highest temperature to maximize heating capacity and the outer edges at the lowest temperature to minimize losses. A short -term thermal storage consisting of 240 m 3 of water is used to interconnect the collection, distribution and seasonal heat storage subsystems. The system has undergone detailed monitoring since it was brought into service in July 2007 to characterize its performance and to improve the TRNSYS model employed in its design. A solar fraction of 97 % in its fifth year of operation, convincingly confirms the design target, a solar fraction of more than 90 % in year five, has been met. This paper describes the system and its operation, presents 5 years of measured performance and compares those results against the TRNSYS predicted performance for the same period...|$|R

50|$|C-days in Vietnam {{were always}} classified, never pre-announced. On <b>C-day,</b> {{soldiers}} would {{be restricted to}} base, preventing GIs from helping Vietnamese civilians—especially local bars, brothels, bar girls and other black market people—from converting old MPC to the newer version. Since Vietnamese {{were not allowed to}} convert the currency, they frequently lost savings by holding old, worthless MPC. People angry over their MPC loss would sometimes attack the nearest U.S. base the next night in retaliation.|$|E

5000|$|Of {{all these}} [...] "super-Crossed", {{there is one}} who takes it to another level: Salt, an infamous serial killer (known as the [...] "Phonebook Killer") who was {{infected}} on <b>C-Day.</b> Because Salt was already homicidally insane and had no restrictions on his impulses, the Crossed virus did not significantly change him (perhaps because his psychopathic brain structure was already significantly altered from normal).

He created the hundred-year plan to ensure the Crossed survive and continue the apocalyptic cycle indefinitely.|$|E
5000|$|One {{hundred years}} after the initial outbreak, as {{depicted}} in Crossed: +100, it is revealed that around 2050 AD, Crossed numbers began to drop significantly and eventually regular humans once again outnumbered the infected, though small family groups of Crossed continued to inhabit some areas, breeding new generations by refraining from killing their young. Crossed +100 shows {{that in the long}} run, Crossed will even learn to breed and form dysfunctional family units. Human society has somewhat begun to rebuild in the former United States, but is still socially and technically backwards compared to society before [...] "The Surprise", as <b>C-Day</b> is referred to in 2108.|$|E
5000|$|Issues #93-99 (by Gage and Fernando Heinz) {{begins by}} {{following}} {{a band of}} survivors led by Cody, an opportunistic man who designed disaster shelters for the elite before stealing one for himself when <b>C-Day</b> hit. His state-of-the-art bunker serves the group well until it comes afoul of Smokey, the [...] "Super-Crossed" [...] last seen in the Quisling arc. After being driven out and left at Smokey's mercy, Cody saves himself by offering to help Smokey mold the Crossed into a coherent society, advising him on means of controlling the others' bloodlust and promising them fresh victims by breeding uninfected like cattle. When this inevitably fails (in part due to a remorseful Cody sacrificing himself to undo his own work), Smokey seeks out other Super-Crossed like himself, eventually finding the Crossed twins from the Homo Superior arc.|$|E
5000|$|Issues #25-28 (The Fatal Englishman, by Ennis and Caceres) are set {{five years}} after <b>C-Day.</b> Four British Army {{soldiers}} (representing each nation of the United Kingdom) go on a suicide mission to break into Porton Down and release the biological weapons, hoping it will wipe out the Crossed but leave enough humans alive for Britain to rebuild and go on an offensive war against the infected. Along the way, they become guardians {{of a group of}} children and a Catholic priest, with whom the title character shares his wisdom. Eventually, after ensuring the survival of the priest and his flock, they decide against their genocidal plan, instead blowing up the entrance of Porton Down to stop anyone from using its lethal cargo before setting off to make a final stand against the Crossed. However, the leader of the group realizes that he cannot see his friends suffer a grisly end {{at the hands of the}} Crossed; thus, he shoots them dead on the way up before confronting a horde of Crossed with nothing but a half-filled pistol.|$|E
5000|$|To reduce profiteering from {{currency}} arbitrage, the U.S. military {{devised the}} MPC program. MPCs were paper money denominated in amounts of 5 cents, 10 cents, 25 cents, 50 cents, 1 dollar, 5 dollars, 10 dollars, and starting in 1968 20 dollars. Unlike US currency, these certificates were issued {{under the authority}} of the Department of War (later Department of Defense) rather than the Department of the Treasury. Consequently they do not bear the US Treasury seal found on virtually every example of US currency. MPCs were fully convertible to U.S. dollars upon leaving a designated MPC zone, and convertible to local currencies when going on leave (but not vice versa). Because they were and are not obligations of the US Treasury, they are (unlike all US currency) no longer redeemable. It was illegal for unauthorized personnel to possess MPC, and that policy, in theory, eliminated U.S. dollars from local economies. Although actual greenbacks were not circulating, many local merchants accepted MPC on par with US dollars, since they could use them on the black market. This was especially evident during the Vietnam War when the MPC program was at its zenith. To prevent MPC from being used as a primary currency in the host country and destroying the local currency value and economy, MPC banknote styles were frequently changed to deter black marketers and reduce hoarding, as the old style would become worthless. Many veterans can recount a conversion day or <b>C-Day.</b>|$|E
5000|$|In 2108, a {{group of}} {{survivors}} from the rebuilt settlement at Chattanooga, Tennessee (called [...] "Chooga") make a horrifying discovery through the diary entries of Beau Salt, an infamous serial killer (known as the [...] "Phonebook Killer") who was infected on <b>C-Day.</b> Because Salt was already homicidally insane and had no restrictions on his impulses, the Crossed virus did not significantly change him (perhaps because his psychopathic brain structure was already significantly altered from normal). Salt considered {{the new world of}} the Crossed to be a paradise, but he also had the foresight to realize that {{it would be difficult to}} sustain indefinitely - given that many Crossed will rape and eat their own small children. Salt therefore began self-consciously conducting conditioning experiments on other Crossed, to weed out the uncontrollable ones and actively select for the ones that could display enough restraint to follow long term plans. Salt also came to realize that because the Crossed were constantly fighting the uninfected, the survivors were becoming battle-hardened and difficult for the Crossed to fight; therefore, he prepared a plan which would take decades to reach fruition (an explicit reference to the Seldon Plan in Isaac Asimov's Foundation Series), in which the Crossed would basically let the uninfected survivor enclaves [...] "lay fallow" [...] for a full generation at a time; over time, the uninfected would get soft, unused to a daily fight for survival against the Crossed. Salt even planned out that the return attacks of the Crossed against survivor enclaves would take place on the exact day of the 100 year anniversary of the Surprise, in July 2108. Chaos unfolds as the uninfected humans seek to protect the remaining settlements in the east coast area of the USA, while trying to uncover the conspiracy laid out by Salt a hundred years earlier.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT. Surface melting rarely occurs across {{most of the}} Antarctic ice sheet, {{away from}} the warmer coastal regions. Nonetheless, {{isolated}} melt features are preserved in the firn and ice in response to infrequent and short-lived melting events. An understanding of the formation and occurrence of these melt layers will help us to interpret records of past melt occurrences from polar ice cores such as the Siple Dome ice-core record from West Antarctica. A search in the near-surface firn in West Antarctica found that melt features are extremely rare, and consist of horizontal, laterally continuous, one to a few millimeter thick, ice layers with few air bubbles. The melt layers found date from the 1992 / 93 and 1991 / 92 summers. Field experiments to investigate changes in stratigraphy taking place during melt events reproduced melt features {{as seen in the}} natural stratigraphy. Melting conditions of varying intensity were created by passively heating the near-surface air for varying lengths of time inside a clear plastic hotbox. Melt layers formed due entirely to preferential flow and subsequent refreezing of meltwater from the surface into near-surface, fine-grained, crust layers. Continuous melt layers were formed experimentally when positive-degree-day values exceeded 18 <b>C-day,</b> a value corresponding well with air-temperature records from automatic weather station sites where melt layers formed in the recent past...|$|E
40|$|Vaccination with Plasmodium falciparum MSP 1 (42) /complete Freund's {{adjuvant}} (FA) {{followed by}} MSP 1 (42) /incomplete FA {{is the only}} known regimen that protects Aotus nancymaae monkeys against infection by erythrocytic stage malaria parasites. The role of adjuvant is not defined; however complete FA cannot be used in humans. In rodent models, immunity is strain-specific. We vaccinated Aotus monkeys with the FVO or 3 D 7 alleles of MSP 1 (42) expressed in Escherichia coli or with the FVO allele expressed in baculovirus (bv) combined with complete and incomplete FA, Montanide ISA- 720 (ISA- 720) or AS 02 A. Challenge with FVO strain P. falciparum showed that suppression of cumulative day 11 parasitemia was strain-specific and could be induced by E. coli expressed MSP 1 (42) in combination with FA or ISA- 720 but not with AS 02 A. The coli 42 -FVO antigen induced a stronger protective effect than the bv 42 -FVO antigen, and FA induced a stronger protective effect than ISA- 720. ELISA antibody (Ab) responses at day of challenge (DOC) were strain-specific and correlated inversely with <b>c-day</b> 11 parasitemia (r = - 0. 843). ELISA Ab levels at DOC meeting a titer of at least 115, 000 ELISA Ab units identified the vaccinees not requiring treatment (noTx) with a true positive rate of 83. 3 % and false positive rate of 14. 3 %. Correlation between functional growth inhibitory Ab levels (GIA) and cumulative day 11 parasitemia was weaker (r = - 0. 511), and was not as predictive for a response of noTx. The lowest false positive rate for GIA was 30 % when requiring a true positive rate of 83. 3 %. These inhibition results along with those showing that antigen/FA combinations induced a stronger protective immunity than antigen/ISA- 720 or antigen/AS 02 combinations are consistent with protection as ascribed to MSP 1 -specific cytophilic antibodies. Development of an effective MSP 1 (42) vaccine against erythrocytic stage P. falciparum infection will depend not only on antigen quality, but also upon the selection of an optimal adjuvant component...|$|E
