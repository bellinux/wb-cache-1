50|$|The {{diesel engines}} are {{originally}} from the Dutch state railways, Nederlandse Spoorwegen (NS), apart from one. This way the VSM has a valuable collection of Dutch diesel engines {{dating from the}} fifties and sixties from the last century. Present are locomotors (serie 200/300), shunters (serie 500/600) and main line engines (series 2200/2300 and 2400/2500).Passenger coaches available from the NS are six ‘Blokkendozen’ (Mat '24) and eleven ‘Bolkoppen’ (Plan D and Plan K), one coach Plan E and two steel guard coaches. Also eight Austrian carriages with two axles and open platforms. Also present are 3 Wagon Lits dining cars and 3 Mitropa cars. Most of these are licensed to run on the Dutch railways. Among the other items there are a <b>coaling</b> <b>crane</b> and an accident crane from the NS.|$|E

50|$|The Asnæs Power Station (Asnæsværket) is a {{coal-fired}} power plant operated by DONG Energy in Kalundborg, Denmark. It consists of three active units, which deliver 147 MW (Unit 2), 270 MW (Unit 4) and 640 MW (Unit 5). Unit 3 went in service in 1959 and uses a 152.1 m flue gas stack, while Unit 5, which went into service in 1981, uses a 220.1 m flue gas stack, the third tallest in Denmark. Its two 60m high <b>coal</b> <b>cranes</b> were dismantled in 2016.|$|R
2500|$|When Suur Tõll was {{delivered}} in 1914, {{she was one}} of the most modern icebreakers in the world. Extensively electrified, she had electrical lighting and her anchor windlass, winches and two <b>coal</b> <b>cranes</b> were all powered by electricity to avoid having easily freezing steam pipes on the deck. Furthermore, she had an electrical salvage pump that could be transported to a grounded ship in a boat or on a sledge over ice without bringing the icebreaker too close to the shallow waters. When delivered, her radio station had a range of , but it was later increased to [...]|$|R
50|$|Much of {{the dock}} {{equipment}} was operated by electricity, supplied at 440V from the Hull Corporation, including electric <b>coal</b> conveyors, <b>cranes,</b> and dock lighting, as well as powering pumps used to supply hydraulic power. Hydraulic equipment (from Hathorn Davey of Leeds) was used for lock and dry dock gates, and for the <b>coal</b> tippers. <b>Cranes</b> were supplied by Royce Limited (Manchester), Craven Brothers, and a floating crane by Werfo Gusto (A.F. Smulders), coal handling equipment was from Head Wrightson. The machinery and mechanism for the lock gates was manufactured by the Hydraulic Engineering Company (Chester); the centrifugal pumps and electric motors for draining the dry docks were made by W.H. Allen (Bedford).|$|R

After using much of task specific knowledge to restrict the possible Tool Center Point (TCP) trajectories to a feasible subspace, two approaches are analyzed to optimize the dig head trajectory in this subspace: a Fuzzy Logic and a Dynamic Programming based trajectory generation.

Established in 1872, the New York based firm supplied rope, <b>coal</b> handling equipment, <b>cranes,</b> and complete industrial railways.

50|$|Originally {{the station}} precinct {{included}} a locomotive depot for the Baden railway with a reception room, a turntable, a <b>crane</b> <b>coal</b> and coal store. It also included the Württemberg railway's administration and depot, including a hand-operated turntable. When the electrically-operated turntable {{was installed in}} Zimmern in 1926, these facilities were decommissioned. The {{construction of a new}} locomotive hall in 1937-38 delayed the demolition of these buildings until 1941-42. The largest hall with seven entrances was built at the west end of the station together with an accommodation building for drivers from Zimmern and the associated tracks. From 1946 to 1953, the locomotive hall served as a rolling stock depot.|$|R
40|$|AbstractErgonomics {{processes}} {{described in}} the literature have been associated mostly with manufacturing, financial, elec-tronics, and office settings where working conditions tend to be rather constant and repetitive. The information {{presented in this paper}} demonstrates, however, that an ergonomics process can also be implemented in a setting such as mining where working conditions frequently change and workers are periodically exposed to extreme conditions. This paper describes how to identify manual handling problem in one of Indonesian Coal Company at South Kalimantan Mine in 2015. The process of problem identification and the impacts of the process on working conditions at the mine using Job Discomfort Survey, Manual Handling Checklist and Sample Decisison Matrix (DM) are reviewed. Barriers overcome and lessons learned are also described. Quotes from Coal Company em-ployees are included in the document to add an ergonomic perspective. Other industries with working conditions similar to mining, such as construction and retail, may find this information useful. The uniqueness of decision matrix is that DM is the research instrument that collect baseline data from supervisor interviews, Nordic-questionnaire, incident data and management concerns becomes task analysis which consist of observations, video taping, discomfort intervention, task measurements which end up with identify risk factors. Scope of coal mining in this paper is crushing & sizing and barge loading, as we know that the overall scope of coal mining are: overburden stripping, coal mining, loading coal from rom stockpile to coal hauler, coal hauling, haul road, crushing & sizing, barge loading, <b>coal</b> barging, floating <b>cranes,</b> <b>coal</b> terminal. Finally, the contribution is to help, prevent or reduce the occurrence of lifting-related lower-back injurie...|$|R
5000|$|Initially, {{the channel}} {{leading to the}} port was dredged to allow vessels to pass through {{to a depth of}} 19 ft over a width of [...] with a widened stretch of [...] for vessels to {{negotiate}} a turn. A pier was built with a length of 1,050 ft and a width of 120 ft at its head in order to facilitate quick and easy loading of grain; there were also two shorter piers for use by smaller vessels in a draft of [...] The port served the town of Maribo which is located 4 miles (6 km) away with connections to Nakskov, Rødby, and Sakskøbing stations. It also had a repair facility and a building yard. Two beacons at the northeastern end of Lindhom provided the required guidance for the vessels through the approach channel to the port. For loading grain and <b>coal,</b> electric <b>cranes</b> and two grain elevators were fixed on the quay. Today, appropriate, navigational facilities are operated during the season with red lights, range lights at fixed heights, buoys, and a channel marked out with red spar buoys to facilitate navigation {{into and out of the}} harbor. The tidal fluctuation noted every 6 hours is of the order of 1 foot at the harbor. During gales it varies between [...]|$|R
50|$|The <b>coal</b> tipping <b>cranes,</b> (referred to as coal-tips, hoists or staiths by the Barry Railway Co) were {{elevated}} {{well above}} water level. After being weighed, a loaded wagon, which would hold about 10 LT of coal, was {{pulled from the}} weighbridge, onto a raisable or lowerable cradle at the hoist to suit the coal chute and a vessels open hold.The cradle was held within a tower, and usually had a downhill gradient railtrack of 1 in 233 towards the weighbridge but a 1 in 70 downhill incline out.The cradle could also be raised or lowered as the dock water level varied.Using hydraulic power, the cradle was tilted to an angle, so the coal {{ran out of the}} wagon and down a coal chute into the hold of the vessel below.At the start of loading, the coal would run into a suspended anti-breakage box, which was hydraulically lowered into the hold and emptied through a hinged flap at the bottom.As loading proceeded, a cone of coal built up below the anti-breakage box until it reached the height {{of the end of the}} chute.At this stage the anti-breakage box was swung out of the way and the coal allowed to run directly down the chute and down the sides of the cone at its angle of repose.Coal trimmers in the hold would level the coal.|$|R

After running 15 years, the corrosion quantity of rail beam rebar is 0. 7 mm, in the late period of development steel corrosion, directly affects the structure of bearing capacity. The corrosion of reinforcement concrete and reinforced area decreasing, reinforced bite force weakened, lead to a significant long-term operation structure safety hazard. On the assumption that, under the rebar corrosion quantity with running time, {{the structure of the}} bearing capacity of growth will no longer meet the requirement of the engineering specifications. Analysis and study of the causes of cracks in the future for terminal maintenance and reinforcement of operation management and provide scientific basis, for similar project offers a useful reference...|$|R
