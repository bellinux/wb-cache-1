5|$|Winckel {{was born}} on 3 November 1912 in Muntok, Bangka Island, {{in what was then}} the Dutch East Indies. On the island his parents ran a trading store in {{commodities}} such as rubber, tin and sugar. Winckel had an untroubled childhood and at age fifteen was sent back to the Netherlands to study at the nautical school in Delfzijl. He stayed with his grandparents while studying, and three years later became a seaman first class for the merchant marine. He specialised in navigation. In 1931, when he was aged nineteen, Winckel started working as a quartermaster on the freighter Pallau, which sailed between the Netherlands and Java. After his work on the ship he went to the island of Borneo to work on oil rigs. By 1935 he returned to the Netherlands once more, this time to work for the Royal Netherlands Navy as a submarine torpedo <b>calibrator.</b> During his time at the Navy a friend showed him a flyer for a pilot position at the Netherlands East Indies Air Force, which was being formed at the time. Winckel joined the Air Force in 1935 and became a pilot at age 23. Between 1935 and 1942 he flew transports across the Dutch East Indies, mainly in Lockheed Lodestars.|$|E
25|$|The range {{signal was}} {{received}} {{on a single}} half-wave dipole mounted at {{the middle of the}} horizontal antenna array, fed into a four-tube RF receiver, and then into a four-tube intermediate frequency (IF) system. The output was fed directly into the lower Y-axis plate of one of the two CRTs. The upper plate on the Y-axis was fed the output of a <b>calibrator,</b> allowing it to be adjusted so the beam was centred vertically. Signals being received from the antenna would thus cause the beam to deflect downward to produce a blip, {{as in the case of}} Chain Home.|$|E

40|$|Spaceborne {{synthetic}} aperture radar (SAR) systems operating at lower frequencies, such as P-band, are significantly affected by Faraday rotation (FR) effects. A novel algorithm for calibrating the circular-transmit-and-linear-receive (CTLR) mode spaceborne compact polarimetric SAR using mixed <b>calibrators</b> is proposed, which is able to correct precisely both FR and radar system errors (i. e., channel imbalance and crosstalk). Six sets of mixed <b>calibrators,</b> consisting of both passive <b>calibrators</b> and polarimetric active radar <b>calibrators</b> (PARCs), are investigated. Theoretical analysis and simulations demonstrate that the optimal calibration scheme combines four polarimetric selective mixed <b>calibrators,</b> including two gridded trihedrals and two PARCs, together with total-electron-content measurements by the Global Navigation Satellite System system...|$|R

5000|$|Sound <b>calibrators</b> {{are used}} in an {{identical}} way to pistonphones, providing a known sound pressure field in a cavity to which a test microphone is coupled. Sound <b>calibrators</b> are different from pistonphones in that they work electronically and use a low-impedance (electrodynamic) source to yield {{a high degree of}} volume independent operation. Furthermore, modern devices often use a feedback mechanism to monitor and adjust the sound pressure level in the cavity so that it is constant regardless of the cavity / microphone size. Sound <b>calibrators</b> normally generate a 1 kHz sine tone; 1 kHz is chosen since the [...] A-weighted SPL is equal to the linear level at 1 kHz.

[9], current study investigated the real-life scenario of using only local dose <b>calibrators</b> for 89 Zr measurement as well as by asking sites to perform the experiments themselves using the provided manuals and instructions. Out of the eight systems investigated in total, four Calibration QC and three NEMA Phantom QC experiments demonstrate a SUV bias of >[*] 10 % (Fig.  2). Since the scanners are EARL accredited for [18 F]FDG-PET/CT, they comply with accreditation specifications for SUV bias (≤[*] 10 %); it is therefore believed that the large global errors are due to inaccurate cross-calibration between the scanners and dose <b>calibrators</b> used to measure the 89 Zr solution activity on site.

When Eptesicus fuscus are taken from their home roosts and exposed to magnetic fields 90 degrees clockwise or counterclockwise of magnetic north, they are disoriented and set off for their homes in the wrong direction. Therefore, it seems that Eptesicus fuscus is capable of magnetoreception. However, the exact use of magnetic fields by Eptesicus fuscus is unclear as the magnetic field could be used either as a map, a compass, or a compass <b>calibrator.</b> Recent research with another bat species, Myotis myotis, supports the hypothesis that bats use magnetic fields as a compass <b>calibrator</b> and their primary compass is the sun.|$|E

40|$|Significant {{improvements}} {{in our understanding}} of various photometric effects have occurred in the more than nine years of flight operations of the Infrared Array Camera aboard the Spitzer Space Telescope. With the accumulation of calibration data, photometric variations that are intrinsic to the instrument can now be mapped with high fidelity. Using all existing data on calibration stars, the array location-dependent photometric correction (the variation of flux with position on the array) and the correction for intra-pixel sensitivity variation (pixel-phase) have been modeled simultaneously. Examination of the warm mission data enabled the characterization of the underlying form of the pixelphase variation in cryogenic data. In addition to the accumulation of calibration data, significant {{improvements in}} the calibration of the truth spectra of the <b>calibrators</b> has taken place. Using the work of Engelke et al. (2006), the KIII <b>calibrators</b> have no offset as compared to the AV <b>calibrators,</b> providing a second pillar of the calibration scheme.

40|$|Although the {{importance}} of the anticardiolipin test in diagnosis of antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is widely accepted, there remains much misunderstanding about the strengths and weak-nesses of this assay. Several disorders result in formation of low levels of the antibody, hence the anticardiolipin test is not speci c when results are low positive. In general, the higher the anticardiolipin level the greater the likelihood of a diagnosis of APS. Hence there have been numerous efforts to enable reproduciblemeasurement of anticardiolipin levels. Standard <b>calibrators</b> were introduced to construct calibration curves from which levels of unknown samples can be derived. Those standard <b>calibrators</b> were made by mixing varying quantities of high positive with normal sera. More recently, <b>calibrators</b> derived from monoclonal anticardiolipin antibodies have been introduced. There are advantages and disadvantages with both types of <b>calibrators.</b> Determi-nation of a precise and reproducible anticardiolipin level is dif cult, whatever the <b>calibrators</b> used, because the assay is dependent on several variable components, any of which may fail on any given day. Utilization of a semi-quantitative measure (low, medium, high) may suf ce in most clinical settings and would be less subject to error. Validated ELISA kits may offer greater reproducibility, since there is less variability than bench assays set up in very different laboratories.
