40|$|The World Summit of Harmonization on Traditional, Alternative and Complementary Medicine (TACM) {{was held}} in Lima, Peru, November 7 – 11, 2007, with almost 600 {{worldwide}} participants. This meeting was organized by Peruvian Medical College, the institution that affiliates and authorizes all physicians to practice medicine in Peru. The meeting included seven sections starting with an overview on {{the current status of}} the TACM. The second section included experiences from different countries on regulations and quality control in products and services used in the TACM. The worldwide experience of education and training in TACM was {{a very important part of}} the meeting in which speakers from Spain, Germany, Argentina, Italy, Brazil, Cuba and Peru shared their experience. The meeting included topics on homeopathy, acupuncture, mind–body medicine, neural therapy, <b>chiropraxis,</b> among others. Two final sessions were related to the ways of linking Traditional medicine to the national Health Systems in the Latin America countries and also the association between bio-commerce and TACM including intellectual properties and bio-piracy...|$|E
40|$|Spinal {{manipulation}} {{is a form}} of {{back and}} other musculoskeletal pain treatment that often involves a high-velocity thrust, a technique in which the joints are adjusted rapidly. The main objective of chiropractors is to correct spinal malalignment and relieve the nerves, allowing them to function optimally (Ernst In: Expert Rev Neurother 7 : 1451 – 1452, 2007; Oppenheim et al. In: Spine J 5 : 660 – 666, 2005). The evidence for the effectiveness of this treatment based on randomized clinical trials still remains uncertain (Cassidy et al. In: Spine 33 (4 suppl) : S 176 –S 183, 2008; Dupeyron et al. In: Ann Readapt Med Phys 46 : 33 – 40, 2003; Ernst et al. In: Expert Rev Neurother 7 : 1451 – 1452, 2007; Hurwitz et al. In: J Manipulative Physiol Ther 27 : 16 – 25, 2007; Thiel et al. In: Spine 32 : 2375 – 2378, 2007). Several case reports and series have been focusing on the risks of <b>chiropraxis,</b> especially on the cervical spine, although the risk/benefit ratio for certain selected patients could be acceptable (Powell et al. In: Neurosurgery 33 : 73 – 78, 1993). We describe the case of a 45 -year-old woman who suffered complete paraplegia shortly after a chiropractic maneuver in the thoracic spine. Dorsal CT showed a calcified disc herniation at the T 8 –T 9 level and MRI revealed a diffuse spinal cord ischemia from T 6 to the conus medullaris without spinal cord compression at the level of herniation. Despite a normal arteriography, authors suggest a vascular injury as the cause of the deficit...|$|E
