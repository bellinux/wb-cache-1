Influential figures that had <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>against</b> Keynesian policy, even from left of center politics, include the UK Labour Party's Maurice Glasman, whose favorite economist is Hayek, and the diplomat Carne Ross, who asserted that no form of centralized authority can meet the problems of the modern world, arguing for an anti-statist form of participatory democracy instead.|$|E

The pay restrictions included prohibition of bonuses in excess of one-third of total salary for any company receiving any money from the plan and was retroactive to companies that received funds under Troubled Assets Relief Program. The limit was a significant alteration of the administration's plan and caught Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner and National Economic Council Chairman Lawrence Summers by surprise.|$|E

Earlier in the week Suways, {{who was in charge}} of security in Tripoli, had ordered Tripoli's police officers to return to work, as Tripoli's police officers had not been in active service since the Civil War. A group calling itself the Official Operations Room, said to be linked with the LROR, claimed on its Facebook page that Misratan militias, with the help of others from Suq al-Huma, had arrested four individuals who it accused of planning to take over a camp in Tajoura.

500|$|Following {{the end of}} the Battle of Britain, Newall {{was quickly}} forced into {{retirement}} and replaced as Chief of the Air Staff by Sir Charles Portal. Contemporaries attributed this to the effects of overwork, which had certainly taken its toll, but there were also other aspects; Newall had lost political support, particularly following a dispute with Lord Beaverbrook over the control of aircraft production and repair. Matters came to a head with the circulation of an anonymous memo attacking Newall, among other senior officers, as [...] "a real weakness to the RAF and to the nation's defences". The author was Edgar McCloughry, a disaffected staff officer who saw himself as passed over for promotion and who had been brought into Beaverbrook's inner circle. Beaverbrook pressed Churchill to dismiss Newall, gaining the support of influential ex-RAF figures such as Trenchard and Salmond. Trenchard had <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>against</b> Newall for his failure to launch a decisive strategic bombing offensive, while Salmond saw Newall's removal as the simplest way to replace Dowding as head of Fighter Command – despite Newall having also sought to sack Dowding.|$|E
500|$|In {{what the}} Miller Center of Public Affairs {{considers}} [...] "a serious tactical error that ruined the scheme [...] ", Tyler appointed former Vice President John C. Calhoun in early March 1844 as his Secretary of State. Tyler's good friend, Virginia Representative Henry A. Wise, wrote that following the Princeton disaster, Wise {{on his own}} volition extended Calhoun the position as a self-appointed emissary {{of the president and}} Calhoun accepted. When Wise went to tell Tyler what he had done, the president was angry but felt that the action had to stand. [...] Calhoun was a leading advocate of slavery, and his attempts to get an annexation treaty passed were resisted by abolitionists as a result. When the text of the treaty was leaked to the public, it met political opposition from the Whigs, who opposed anything that might enhance Tyler's status, as well as from foes of slavery and those who feared a confrontation with Mexico, which had announced that it would view annexation as a hostile act by the United States. Both Clay and Van Buren, the respective frontrunners for the Whig and Democratic nominations, decided in a private meeting at Van Buren's home to <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>against</b> annexation. Knowing this, Tyler was pessimistic when he sent the treaty to the Senate for ratification in April 1844.|$|E
500|$|In October 1960 a preparatory Commission for the {{upcoming}} International Conference of the Communist and Workers' Parties scheduled for November that year was held from October 121, with the Albanian delegation being led by Hysni Kapo and Ramiz Alia.

To this end, they created around our delegation a harsh and dangerous atmosphere, in which open threats were combined with cunning flattery." [...] Hoxha once again communicated via radiogram, writing to Kapo on October 13 that, [...] "We are not of the same opinion as those {{who are trying to}} smooth out the problems by means of phrases in resolutions or declarations... We are for carrying the matter through to the end. If this is not understood, it means that the danger which the Khrushchev group represents for the world communist movement is not understood. It does not depend on us whether this group should continue in power or not, but it is essential that we, should expose this group with Khrushchev at the head, as they deserve... we shall not allow ourselves to be impressed by those who say: 'How can one attack the glorious Soviet Union or the great Communist Party of Lenin for the faults of a few rascals?' We say: Precisely to defend the Soviet Union and the Party of Lenin, these 'rascals' must be exposed, and there must be no toning down of criticism or covering up of the deviationists." ...|$|E

It is essential for cardiovascular function in cats, and development and function of skeletal muscle, the retina and the central nervous system.

As {{head of the federal}} army he felt a responsibility to maintain public order where it had broken down, often because the city militias had <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>against</b> the city governments. An interesting political development started to take shape, in which the Orangist mob (against which normally both the States Party and the Orangist regents would have formed a common front) injected a decidedly [...] "democratic" [...] element into Dutch politics. The mob, incited by the Calvinist preachers as usual, demanded not only a purge of the States Party regents, but also an alteration of detested policies, like toleration of dissenting Protestants. The main demand, of course, was the abolition of the Perpetual Edict, and the appointment of William to the restored stadtholdership. He was therefore, in effect, [...] put in power by the people in July, 1672. The Orangist regents (hoping this would be a one-off aberration) legitimized this [...] "unconstitutional" [...] interference of the common people in what they, too, considered [...] "their" [...] affairs, after the fact as a [...] "patriotic" [...] and necessary check on regent presumption, which was justified by the emergency. It is nevertheless remarkable, and somewhat ironic, that now Orangist ideology also had a [...] "democratic" [...] variant.|$|E
2500|$|The current Grand Imam of al-Azhar {{and former}} {{president}} of al-Azhar University, Ahmed el-Tayeb, has strongly condemned the Islamic State, stating that it is acting [...] "under the guise of this holy religion and have given themselves the name 'Islamic State' in an attempt to export their false Islam". Citing the Quran, he stated: [...] "The punishment for those who wage war against God and his Prophet and who strive to sow corruption on earth is death, crucifixion, the severing of hands and feet on opposite sides or banishment from the land. This is the disgrace for them in this world and in the hereafter they will receive grievous torment." [...] Although el-Tayeb has been criticised for not expressly stating that the Islamic State is heretical, the Ash'ari school of Islamic theology, to which el-Tayeb belongs, does not allow calling a person who follows the shahada an apostate. El-Tayeb has strongly <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>against</b> the practice of takfirism (declaring a Muslim an apostate) which is used by the Islamic State to [...] "judge and accuse anyone who doesn’t tow their line with apostasy and outside the realm of the faith" [...] declaring [...] "Jihad on peaceful Muslims" [...] using [...] "flawed interpretations of some Qur’anic texts, the prophet's Sunna, and the Imams’ views believing incorrectly, that they are leaders of Muslim armies fighting infidel peoples, in unbelieving lands".|$|E

But the talks must be a discussion, not an ultimatum." [...] On 4 November 2007, he declared Israel's intention {{to negotiate with the}} Palestinians about all issues, stating, [...] "Annapolis will be the jumping-off point for continued serious and in-depth negotiations, which will not avoid any issue or ignore any division that has clouded our relations with the Palestinian people for many years." [...] On 29 November 2007, he warned of the end of Israel in case a two-state solution is not eventually found for the Israeli-Palestinian dispute. [...] "If the day comes when the two-state solution collapses, and we face a South African-style struggle for equal voting rights (also for the Palestinians in the territories), then, as soon as that happens, the State of Israel is finished", Olmert said {{on the last day of}} the Annapolis Conference. [...] "The Jewish organizations, which were our power base in America, will be the first to <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>against</b> us", Olmert said, [...] "because they will say they cannot support a state that does not support democracy and equal voting rights for all its residents".|$|E

2500|$|During the war, Indian {{nationalist}} expatriates in Southeast Asia and the Japanese Army {{formed the}} Indian National Army (INA) {{to fight for}} Indian independence from Britain. For manpower, it relied on the approximately 45,000 Indian troops of the Indian Army whom the Japanese captured when Singapore fell in February 1942. Subhas Chandra Bose was parachuted in to lead the INA in 1943, and he greatly expanded the INA to include the mainly Tamil civilian Indian community in Malaya. He also negotiated a combat role for the INA from the reluctant Japanese, who were more inclined to use it intelligence and propaganda work. In 1944, INA units participated in the Japanese Army`s offensives against British positions in the Arakan and the Imphal Plain. Not being a military man Bose - or [...] "Netaji" [...] (respected leader) naively believed that Indian soldiers of the Indian Army who deployed against the INA would flock to its standard. But these Indian troops stood fIrm, and actually defeated the INA. Despite this, Bose insisted that the INA be given an independent sector on the Irrawaddy in February 1945. Despite the desperate efforts of some INA troops, their sector was overrun, and desertions became commonplace. Militarily, the INA was finished. After the war, however, it made a political impact, due to the British decision to publicly court-martial three INA commanders. This was a miscalculation, because Indian nationalist politicians, who had previously <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>against</b> the INA, now whipped up popular sentiment {{for the release of}} the INA accused. Realizing their error, the British acquiesced. In this way, the INA was another sign that the Raj's days were numbered.|$|E
2500|$|Abdur Rahman bin Abu Bakr and Abdullah ibn Umar were mid level Muslim commanders at the Battle of Yarmouk {{that took}} Syria. Abdur Rahman bin Abu Bakr sister Asmā' bint Abu Bakr also {{fought in the}} Battle of Yarmouk and was opposed to Yazid. Abdur Rahman bin Abu Bakr {{had been one of}} the first to duel in that battle, after taking a sword to hand over to a Qays bin Hubayrah who had lost his sword, while in a duel with the Roman Army's best horseman. Two more Roman {{horsemen}} then came forward, saying, [...] "We see no justice when two of you come against one of us." [...] Abdur Rahman bin Abu Bakr replied, [...] "I only came to give my companion a sword and then return. Were 100 of you to <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>against</b> one of us we would not be worried. You are now three men. I am enough to take on all three of you". After which he took down the Roman horsemen on his own. After seeing this, Bannes the Roman general said [...] "Caesar really knew these people best. I now know that a difficult situation is to come on you. If you do not attack them with great numbers, you will have no chance". Abdullah ibn Umar had also been a mid level commander in the Battle of Yarmouk. Some Roman soldiers went to the house of Abu al-Jaid a local Christian in az-Zura ah and after eating all the food, raped his wife and killed his son. His wife complained to the Roman general and he ignored her. Abu al-Jaid then went to the Muslims and told them that he knows the local area and if the Muslims exempt him and his descendents from taxes for ever he will help them defeat the Roman army. He then took horse men led by Abdullah ibn Umar to the Roman camp at night and attacked them and then ran away. The Romans chased them and in the dark tens of thousands of them fell down a cliff at the an-Naqusah Creek into a river. Abdullah bin Az-Zubair had also been a commander in various battles including in North Africa and was also involved in the siege of Constantinople.|$|E
2500|$|With the 39th BC general {{election}} coming in May 2009, Trevena was acclaimed as the BC NDP candidate in October 2008. The BC Liberals selected {{former chief of}} the Kwakiutl First Nation Marion Wright to face Trevena in what was projected to be a competitive race but which Trevena easily won. In the 39th Parliament of British Columbia Trevena became one of two assistant deputy speakers. In that role, she travelled to Kenya to attend a conference for the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association, along with the speaker Bill Barisoff. She joined with fellow NDP MLAs Scott Fraser and Lana Popham, {{in conjunction with the}} Western Canada Wilderness Committee, in lobbying for the stop to old-growth logging on Vancouver Island and the Lower Mainland. In the Harmonized Sales Tax debate, Trevena called for the Select Standing Committee on Finance to conduct public consultation across the province but ultimately opposed its implementation on the basis its fewer exemptions compared to Provincial Sales Tax and the increased control the HST would give to the federal government on taxation matters. In November 2010, Trevena emerged as one of thirteen NDP MLAs to call for a leadership convention over the leadership of Carol James. Trevena had been critical of the party a year earlier at a BC NDP convention when she criticized the neglect of the party's [...] "Sustainable BC" [...] vision during the 2009 election but did not publicly <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>against</b> James' leadership, as Bob Simpson was removed from caucus in October for public dissent, until Katrine Conroy resigned as caucus whip. After threats of discipline and mediation efforts failed and James resigned, Trevena immediately stated she was not running for the leadership position. Instead, in mid-March 2011, she endorsed John Horgan in the leadership race, though Adrian Dix went on to win. Dix moved Trevena from assistant deputy speaker to opposition critic of children and family development, a role similar to what she held during the 38th Parliament. In this role she responded to an editorial by Mary McNeil, the minister responsible for children and families, calling for the minister to poverty reduction strategy. As the government was considering a fall 2011 election, Trevana was acclaimed the NDP candidate for the North Island riding, though the mid-term election was not called. In 2012 she toured with an NDP forestry committee, along with Bill Routley, Norm Macdonald, and Harry Lali seeking strategies to curtail raw log exports. She subsequently presented the NDP forestry plan later that year, calling for reforestation, restriction to raw log exports, and the re-instatement of a jobs commissioner. She advocated for the Coastal Ferry Amendment Act to include a freeze in the rise of ferry fees and subsequently called fare increases [...] "disgraceful".|$|E
