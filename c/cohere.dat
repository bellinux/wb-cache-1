The diverse ritualistic, mythical, doctrinal, legal, institutional and material features of religion may not necessarily <b>cohere</b> with experiential, emotive, spiritual or contemplative considerations about the origin and operation of conscience. Common secular or scientific views regard the capacity for conscience as probably genetically determined, with its subject probably learned or imprinted (like language) {{as part of a}} culture.|$|E
5|$|Because And Yet It Moves was {{originally}} designed to be played with digital controls, the Wii Remote's analog motion controls needed to be implemented such that they felt natural and not intrusive. Broken Rules determined, following a number of tests, that allowing the player to freely rotate to any degree best suited motion controls; originally the player could only rotate in 90 degree intervals. Four different control schemes were implemented to satisfy a wide number of players, three of which either use motion control or the Wii Remote pointer. While the file size limit imposed on WiiWare games was not an issue, the visuals needed to be downsampled to <b>cohere</b> with the Wii hardware. A standard-definition television was used in development; Bohatsch felt the visuals looked nicer on the SDTV than on a PC or Mac with higher display resolution, but warned that some HDTVs might not upsample the Wii resolution properly, recommending that a component cable be used while playing the game. The online leaderboards were omitted from the Wii version because the PC version's leaderboards were not frequently used. Three new levels, unlocked when the player completes the main campaign mode, were added. The near {{final version of the}} game was submitted to Nintendo's Quality Assurance team in May 2010 to inspect and find bugs. And Yet It Moves was released on the Wii Shop Channel in North America on August 23, 2010 and then in Europe on August 27.|$|E

Journalist Michael Azerrad, profiling Minutemen in his book Our Band Could Be Your Life (titled after a lyric from [...] "History Lesson – Part II"), named Double Nickels on the Dime as [...] "one of the greatest achievements of the indie era" [...] and {{described it as a}} [...] "Whitman's sampler of left-wing politics, moving autobiographical vignettes, and twisted Beefheartian twang".

500|$|The {{two most}} widely {{accepted}} altered states are sleep and dreaming. [...] Although dream sleep and non-dream sleep appear very similar to an outside observer, each {{is associated with a}} distinct pattern of brain activity, metabolic activity, and eye movement; [...] each is also associated with a distinct pattern of experience and cognition. [...] During ordinary non-dream sleep, people who are awakened report only vague and sketchy thoughts, and their experiences do not <b>cohere</b> into a continuous narrative. [...] During dream sleep, in contrast, people who are awakened report rich and detailed experiences in which events form a continuous progression, which may however be interrupted by bizarre or fantastic intrusions. [...] Thought processes during the dream state frequently show a high level of irrationality. [...] Both dream and non-dream states are associated with severe disruption of memory: [...] it usually disappears in seconds during the non-dream state, and in minutes after awakening from a dream unless actively refreshed.|$|E
500|$|Sarmiento's {{book is a}} {{critique}} and also a symptom of Argentina's cultural conflicts. [...] In 1810, the country had gained independence from the Spanish Empire, but Sarmiento complains that Argentina had yet to <b>cohere</b> as a unified entity. [...] The country's chief political division saw the Unitarists (or Unitarians, with whom Sarmiento sided), who favored centralization, counterposed against the Federalists, who believed that the regions should maintain a good measure of autonomy. This division was in part a split between {{the city and the}} countryside. [...] Then as now, Buenos Aires was the country’s largest and wealthiest city {{as a result of its}} access to river trade routes and the South Atlantic. Buenos Aires was exposed not only to trade but to fresh ideas and European culture. These economic and cultural differences caused tension between Buenos Aires and the land-locked regions of the country. [...] Despite his Unitarian sympathies, Sarmiento himself came from the provinces, a native of the Western town of San Juan.|$|E

500|$|Development {{accelerated}} {{in early}} 2010, {{and the project}} was [...] "beginning to <b>cohere</b> as a game" [...] {{around the time of}} E3. Donkey Kong Country Returns was officially announced at Nintendo's press conference held on June 15, with four playable levels available on the show floor. Although the game was set for release later that year, the team still had 70 levels to create or refine. Around the end of development, Tanabe had lower back pain and needed to take a week off. During that time, assistant producer Risa Tabata took over his duties, and Tanabe decided to keep her in charge for the rest of production. The music, which was inspired by David Wise and Eveline Fischer's score for the Super NES games in the series, was co-written by Kenji Yamamoto, who had worked on the Prime trilogy. Yamamoto wrote songs to fit the mood of certain levels, and some songs were rewritten if their matching levels were heavily redesigned. Takashi Nagasako voiced both Donkey Kong and Cranky Kong, while Katsumi Suzuki voiced Diddy Kong.|$|E
500|$|Several reviewers re-watched Star Trek: The Next Generation {{after the}} end of the series.

He gave [...] "Conspiracy" [...] a score of four out of ten. Zack Handlen, who reviewed the episode for The A.V. Club, thought that while [...] "Conspiracy" [...] was a [...] "hard episode to forget", it was not quite as good as he remembered and did not quite [...] "fit" [...] with the rest of the season. He thought that certain parts of the plot were [...] "idiotic", and the Admirals reminded him of a [...] "Bond villain convention".

500|$|Calling {{the series}} [...] "sophomoric, gross, and unfunny", Hal Boedeker of the Orlando Sentinel {{believed}} that this episode [...] "makes such a bad impression that it's hard {{to get on the}} show's strange wavelength." [...] Ann Hodges of the Houston Chronicle considered the show [...] "made by and for childish grown-ups" [...] and for [...] "adults who enjoy kid shows". Seeing the show as the inheritor of The Simpsons and Beavis and Butt-Head, Ginia Bellafante of Time noted its failure to <b>cohere</b> and considered the show [...] "devoid of subtext". Caryn James of The New York Times commented that the series [...] "succeeds best in small touches" [...] but [...] "seems to have a future". In a generally negative review of the first three episodes of the series, Tom Shales of The Washington Post wrote that [...] "Most of the alleged humor on the premiere is self-conscious and self-congratulatory in its vulgarity: flatulence jokes, repeated use of the word 'dildo' (in the literal as well as pejorative sense) and a general air of malicious unpleasantness." [...] In one of the few generally positive reviews, Eric Mink of the Daily News praised the South Park universe and the [...] "distinct, interesting characters" [...] within it. He singled out Cartman, calling him [...] "the most vibrant of the bunch", describing him as [...] "a bitter old man living in an 8-year-old's body".|$|E

500|$|Agharta was {{originally}} panned by critics, becoming {{the most widely}} criticized of Davis' double albums in the 1970s. According to The Strangers Dave Segal, {{it was one of}} the most divisive records ever, challenging both critics and the artist's core audience much in the same way Lou Reed's Metal Machine Music album had in 1975. In The New York Times, Robert Palmer wrote that Agharta was marred by long stretches of [...] "sloppy, one-chord jams", disjointed sounds, and a banal quality clearly rendered by the impeccable Japanese engineering. He complained that Davis' use of the wah-wah pedal inhibited his ability to phrase notes and that the septet sounded poor [...] "by rock standards", particularly Cosey, whose overamplified guitar [...] "whined and rumbled like a noisy machine shop", relegating Lucas to background riffs. Jazz Forum critic Andrzej Trzaskowski said Fortune seemed to be the only jazz musician on the record, finding his solos often flawless while disparaging the performances of Davis, Lucas, and Cosey, whose guitar and synthesizer effects he found pointlessly brutal. In Trzaskowski's opinion, the individual segments did not <b>cohere</b> as a whole and were further hampered by the clichéd [...] "rock phraseology" [...] of the guitarists, who he said lacked wit, harmony, and taste. Ian Carr, a biographer of Davis, felt his trumpet sounded fatigued, dejected, and out of place with the band's intense rhythms and monotonously noisy guitars; in general, he found the music [...] "too non-Western in the sense of too much rhythm and not enough structure".|$|E
500|$|Television {{columnist}} Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger noted [...] "I use {{the phrase}} 'funny forgives a lot' in my 30 Rock reviews when an episode fails to <b>cohere</b> but is still entertaining. [...] That changed with 'Audition Day', which still wasn't 30 Rock at its peak but which had one perfect, hilarious sequence that almost singlehandedly redeemed the episode for me." [...] He enjoyed Jack's scene in the subway, calling it [...] "the funniest moment" [...] from the episode, and [...] "one of the funniest things Alec Baldwin has done on the show in a long time". TV Squad's Bob Sassone wrote {{that he did not}} enjoy Jack's plot, explaining that the bedbug bit [...] "got to be a little too much", and much preferred Jenna and Tracy's storyline [...] "because it fit in with the auditioning plot." [...] Time contributor James Poniewozik opined that this was an [...] "amusing episode overall", and was glad that it gave Scott Adsit's Pete [...] "something to do" [...] here. Los Angeles Timess Meredith Blake was favorable towards [...] "Audition Day", writing it was a [...] "fine return to form", following the airing of [...] "Stone Mountain", which she disliked. IGN contributor Robert Canning said this episode of 30 Rock had fun, comedic chaos, and that it [...] "worked well, but never quite reached the hilarity tipping point." [...] He disliked that Brian Williams' cameo was ruined by the promos [...] "because the surprise of the bit would have been far funnier than what the bit actually turned out to be." [...] Canning said the auditions were [...] "fun, though not a complete knockout", enjoyed the fact that Kathy participated in the auditions and her Susan Boyle reference [...] "had great timing", and was [...] "let down" [...] by the revelation that Jayden was psychotic, noting it [...] "eemed like a bit of a cop out to the story as a whole." [...] In conclusion, Canning gave this episode an 8.2 out of 10 rating.|$|E
