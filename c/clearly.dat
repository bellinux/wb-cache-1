5|$|But {{theories}} of either complete independence of or complete {{dependence on the}} synoptics are largely rejected in current scholarship: on the one hand, elements such as distinctive Johannine language, the lengthy discourses, and the prologue on the Logos, are <b>clearly</b> unique to John; on the other, John <b>clearly</b> shares a multitude of episodes with the other three.|$|E
5|$|Obsolete {{nations are}} {{included}} in the table to more <b>clearly</b> illustrate past Olympic appearances for their successor nations.|$|E
5|$|One house which <b>clearly</b> {{shows this}} Palladian-Gibbs {{influence}} is Mount Airy, in Richmond County, Virginia, built in 1758–62.|$|E
5|$|Storing {{antifreeze}} in <b>clearly</b> marked original sealed containers, {{in areas}} that are inaccessible to pets or small children.|$|E
5|$|A {{band-pass filter}} can be {{constructed}} using any elements that can resonate. Filters using stubs can <b>clearly</b> be made band-pass; numerous other structures are possible and some are presented below.|$|E
5|$|A rigid {{division}} of labor is established which <b>clearly</b> identifies the regular tasks and duties of the particular bureaucratic system.|$|E
5|$|As {{the threat}} of {{invasion}} was <b>clearly</b> felt in late 1941, {{an idea for a}} series of secret observation posts (first in Gibraltar and later in other places like Malta and Aden) was put together under Operation Tracer.|$|E
5|$|Delta Photos was {{dissolved}} in 1972 but other {{organizations such as}} Morten Bo's Ragnarok and Henrik Saxgren's 2. Maj sought to promote more <b>clearly</b> defined social and political objectives. Some photographers, such as Viggo Rivad and Krass Clement, chose instead to become freelancers.|$|E
5|$|Despite his immense popularity, Como {{is rarely}} {{given credit for}} what, once you stop and think of it, he so <b>clearly</b> is: {{one of the great}} singers and one of the great artists of our time.|$|E
5|$|During {{his first}} {{appearances}} in parliament, Charles {{spoke to the}} government through her. He would whisper the questions he had in her ear, and she would ask them aloud and <b>clearly</b> for him.|$|E
5|$|Her {{political}} {{observations are}} <b>clearly</b> written {{from her own}} Tory viewpoint. However, her {{detailed description of the}} rivalry for power between the Tories and Liberals which took place between 1822 and 1830 {{is one of the most}} authoritative accounts of this struggle.|$|E
5|$|Herodotus {{does not}} {{estimate}} {{numbers for the}} Eretrians. Presumably, {{the majority of the}} citizen body would {{have been involved in the}} defence of the city, but the population of Eretria at the time cannot be <b>clearly</b> established.|$|E
5|$|Historians {{debate the}} extent to which Geneva was a theocracy. On the one hand, Calvin's {{theology}} <b>clearly</b> called for separation between church and state. Other historians have stressed the enormous political power wielded on a daily basis by the clerics.|$|E
5|$|However, recent {{documentary}} evidence, a Kabulatipatra dated April 1794 {{bearing the}} sign of Ramprasad Sen as a witness, <b>clearly</b> proves the fact that Ramprasad Sen was alive in 1794. The said Kabulatipatra has been preserved and displayed at Sabarna Sangrahashala in Barisha.|$|E
5|$|In 1979, an unexplained {{phenomenon}} {{causes the}} sky to flash white. Afterward, every chicken around the world develops instantaneous intelligence on par with humans. They are also able to speak <b>clearly.</b>|$|E
5|$|In {{his memoir}} Götzen, written in prison, he further {{commented on the}} {{meanings}} of Sonderbehandlung, explaining that it had both a <b>clearly</b> lethal meaning {{as well as other}} possible ones and providing documentary examples for each meaning.|$|E
5|$|Mycenastrum corium subsp. ferrugineum {{has a deep}} rusty red to {{reddish orange}} gleba, <b>clearly</b> {{distinguishing}} it from the glebal coloring of the main subspecies. M.corium var. diabolicum has an extremely spiny capillitium.|$|E
5|$|Several {{sites on}} the Mendips are {{designated}} as open access land, {{and there are many}} footpaths and bridleways that are generally <b>clearly</b> marked.|$|E
5|$|St Helena: , {{used on a}} postcard. Only the Colonial Office in London could authorize new stamps, a fact <b>clearly</b> {{unknown to}} the Governor, and the issue was withdrawn. These are among the rarest of modern stamps as only 434 sets were sold.|$|E
5|$|Support for the French {{nationalist}} leader Jean-Marie Le Pen. In 1985, the French periodical Présent quoted Lefebvre as endorsing Le Pen on {{the grounds}} that he was the only leading French politician who was <b>clearly</b> opposed to abortion.|$|E
5|$|The Silver Age {{of comic}} books was {{followed}} by the Bronze Age. The demarcation is not <b>clearly</b> defined, but {{there are a number of}} possibilities.|$|E
5|$|The above {{geometric}} proof shows very <b>clearly</b> {{where the}} additional force arises from {{to make the}} orbit revolve {{with respect to the}} static orbit.|$|E
5|$|The fossils <b>clearly</b> {{belong to}} a hippopotamus, but one much larger than any {{previously}} described Madagascan species. From what is known, the species closely resembled the modern hippopotamus, but was somewhat smaller.|$|E
5|$|The {{girl who}} {{allegedly}} underwent a tracheotomy {{appeared to be}} able to speak and sing <b>clearly</b> mere days after the surgery.|$|E
5|$|The name of Zobel is, perhaps, most {{well known}} {{with regard to}} {{impedance}} compensation networks for loudspeakers. <b>Clearly,</b> his designs have applications in this field. However, none of Zobel's patents or articles appear to discuss this topic. It is unclear whether he actually designed anything specifically for loudspeakers. The closest we get to {{this is where he}} speaks of impedance matching into a transducer, but here he is discussing a circuit to equalize a submarine cable, or in another instance where <b>clearly</b> he has in mind the hybrid transformer which terminates a line going into a telephone instrument on a phantom circuit.|$|E
5|$|The peasants {{were well}} {{organized}} {{and for the}} only time mobilized veritable armies against their rulers, which hadn't happened before. The peasant leaders had <b>clearly</b> learned from previous unsuccessful smaller revolts they had been involved in.|$|E
5|$|The shops on {{the north}} side have {{cantilevered}} rear extensions. Consequently, the northern external façade of the bridge is asymmetrical, much altered and of no architectural merit, whereas the southern external side <b>clearly</b> shows the hand of Robert Adam.|$|E
5|$|The {{threefold}} repetition {{rule was}} added, although at some times {{up to six}} repetitions have been required, and the exact conditions have been specified more <b>clearly</b> (see Threefold repetition#History).|$|E
5|$|This crucial {{matter was}} also {{emphasised}} by Beck and defined in very <b>clearly</b> expressed terms {{on the website}} of the artist, Peter Layne Arguimbau.|$|E
5|$|Though <b>clearly</b> forelimb-based launchers, basal pterosaurs have hindlimbs well {{adapted for}} hopping, {{suggesting}} {{a connection with}} archosaurs such as Scleromochlus.|$|E
25|$|The {{evaluation}} function was <b>clearly</b> for illustrative purposes, as Shannon stated. For example, {{according to the}} function, pawns that are doubled as well as isolated would have no value at all, which is <b>clearly</b> unrealistic.|$|E
25|$|If genetic factors {{account for}} half of the {{variation}} of pubertal timing, environment factors are <b>clearly</b> important as well. One of the first observed environmental effects is that puberty occurs later in children raised at higher altitudes. The most important of the environmental influences is <b>clearly</b> nutrition, {{but a number of}} others have been identified, all which affect timing of female puberty and menarche more <b>clearly</b> than male puberty.|$|E
25|$|Pike Perch causes <b>clearly</b> visible, {{negative}} effects on the autochthonous species in Jablaničko Lake. In Salakovačko Lake these effects are in progress, although less visible, while in Grabovičko Lake {{it is not yet}} <b>clearly</b> visible.|$|E
