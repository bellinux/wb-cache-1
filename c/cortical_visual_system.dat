The primary function of the occipital temporal gyrus - otherwise referenced as IT cortex - is associated with visual stimuli processing, namely visual object recognition, and has been suggested by recent experimental results as the final location of the ventral <b>cortical</b> <b>visual</b> <b>system.</b> The IT cortex in humans {{is also known as}} the Inferior Temporal Gyrus since it has been located to a specific region of the human temporal lobe. The IT processes visual stimuli of objects in our field of vision, and is involved with memory and memory recall to identify that object; it is involved with the processing and perception created by visual stimuli amplified in the V1, V2, V3, and V4 regions of the occipital lobe. This region processes the color and form of the object in the visual field and is responsible for producing the “what” from this visual stimuli, or in other words identifying the object based on the color and form of the object and comparing that processed information to stored memories of objects to identify that object.|$|E

This paper reviews findings from experimental psychology demonstrating that visual imagery and perception have similar characteristics. These results suggest that visual imagery and visual perception rely on the same neural substrate. Brain imaging studies as well as clinical observations of neurological patients support this hypothesis. Visual imagery involves visual cortical areas. However, selective visual impairments following damage to the <b>cortical</b> <b>visual</b> <b>system</b> may produce some dissociation between imagery and perception. Similar observations concerning motor imagery are now established in both normals and in neurological patients.

Trauma and sociocognitive explanations of dissociative identity disorder are contrasted. The trauma hypothesis is further differentiated into paradigms in which trauma affects a defense mechanism, and one in which trauma serves to inhibit the normal integration sequence of parallel processes of the self in childhood.

40|$|The {{motion of}} an object (such as a wheel rotating) is seen as {{consistent}} independent of its position and size on the retina. Neurons in higher cortical visual areas respond to these global motion stimuli invariantly, but neurons in early cortical areas with small receptive fields cannot represent this motion, {{not only because of}} the aperture problem but also because they do not have invariant representations. In a unifying hypothesis with the design of the ventral <b>cortical</b> <b>visual</b> <b>system,</b> we propose that the dorsal visual system uses a hierarchical feedforward network architecture (V 1, V 2, MT, MSTd, parietal cortex) with training of the connections with a short-term memory trace associative synaptic modification rule to capture what is invariant at each stage. Simulations show that the proposal is computationally feasible, in that invariant representations of the motion flow fields produced by objects self-organize in the later layers of the architecture. The model produces invariant representations of the motion flow fields produced by global in-plane motion {{of an object}}, in-plane rotational motion, looming versus receding of the object, and object-based rotation about a principal axis. Thus, the dorsal and ventral visual systems may share some similar computational principles. ...|$|E

From there the information is sent to the primary visual cortex, region V1. It then travels from the visual areas in the occipital lobe to the parietal and temporal lobes via two distinct anatomical streams. These two <b>cortical</b> <b>visual</b> <b>systems</b> were classified by Ungerleider and Mishkin (1982, see two-streams hypothesis). One stream travels ventrally to the inferior temporal cortex (from V1 to V2 then through V4 to ITC) while the other travels dorsally to the posterior parietal cortex.

The Inferior Temporal Cortex receives information from the ventral stream, understandably so, as it is known to be a region essential in recognizing patterns, faces, and objects.|$|R

Evidence has emerged that in the healthy human visual cortex, differentiable effects of visual illusions can be found between the two measures of perception and visuo- motor control. This evidence has been cited to support the Milner and Goodale (1995) model. The series of studies reported in this dissertation used a similar, but methodologically revised application of the illusion paradigm in the novel domain of orientation. Using two types of visual illusions, the simultaneous tilt illusion (STI) and the rod-and-frame illusion (RFI), a series of studies found patterns of association, dissociation and interaction that strongly support the Mihier and Goodale model.

However, to date, there has been no broad-based survey of category and location information across all major functionally defined object-selective regions. In this study, we used an fMRI region-of-interest (ROI) approach to identify eight regions characterized by their strong selectivity for particular object categories (faces, scenes, bodies, and objects). Participants viewed four types of stimuli (faces, scenes, bodies, and cars) appearing in each of three different spatial locations (above, below, or at fixation). Analyses based on the mean response and voxelwise patterns of response in each ROI reveal location information in almost all of the known object-selective regions. Furthermore, category and location information can be read out independently of one another such that most regions contain both position-invariant category information and category-invariant position information. Finally, we find substantially more location information in ROIs on the lateral than those on the ventral surface of the brain, even though these regions have equal amounts of category information. Although the presence of both location and category information in most object-selective regions argues against a strict physical separation of processing streams for object shape and location, the ability to extract position-invariant category information and category-invariant position information from the same neural population indicates that form and location information nonetheless remain functionally independent...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe human <b>cortical</b> <b>visual</b> <b>system</b> is {{organized}} into two major pathways: a dorsal stream projecting to the superior parietal lobe (SPL), {{considered to be}} critical for visuospatial perception or on-line control of visually guided movements, and a ventral stream leading to the inferotemporal cortex, mediating object perception [1 – 3]. Between these structures lies a large region, consisting of the inferior parietal lobe (IPL) and superior temporal gyrus (STG), the function of which is controversial. Lesions here can lead to spatial neglect [4, 5], a condition associated with abnormal visuospatial perception [6, 7] as well as impaired visually guided movements [8, 9], suggesting that the IPL+STG may have largely a “dorsal” role. Here, we use a nonspatial task [10] to examine the deployment of visuotemporal attention in focal lesion patients, with or without spatial neglect. We show that, regardless {{of the presence of}} neglect, damage to the IPL+STG leads to a more prolonged deployment of visuotemporal attention compared to lesions of the SPL. Our findings suggest that the human IPL+STG makes an important contribution to nonspatial perception, and this is consistent with a role that is neither strictly “dorsal” nor “ventral” [11].

40|$|Representing the {{orientation}} of features in the visual image is a fundamental operation of the early <b>cortical</b> <b>visual</b> <b>system.</b> The nature of such representations can be informed by considering anisotropic distributions of response across the range of orientations. Here, we used {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} to investigate modulations in the cortical activity elicited by observation of a sinusoidal grating which varied in orientation.

These visual areas and hV 4 showed a further anisotropy in which increased responses were observed for orientations that were radial to the point of fixation.

40|$|The {{visual system}} is {{constantly}} challenged {{to organize the}} retinal pattern of stimulation into coherent percepts. This task is achieved by the <b>cortical</b> <b>visual</b> <b>system,</b> which is composed by topographically organized analytic areas and by synthetic areas of the temporal lobe that have more holistic processing. Additional visual areas of the parietal lobe are related to motion perception and visuomotor control. V 1 and V 2 represent the entire visual field. MT represents only the binocular field, and V 4 only the central 30 °– 40 °. The parietal areas represent more of the periphery. For any eccentricity, the receptive field grows at each step of processing, more at anterior areas in the temporal lobe. Minimal point image size increases towards the temporal lobe, but remains fairly constant toward the parietal lobe. Patterns of projection show asymmetries. Central V 2 and V 4 project mainly to the temporal lobe, while peripherals V 2 (more than 30 °) and V 4 (more than 10 °) also project to the parietal lobe. Visual information that arrives at V 1 projects to V 2, MT and PO, which then project to other areas.

The results support a narrowband approach to visual processing but require its elaboration. Unlike grating patterns, the contrast response to natural scenes depends on the phase structure at remote spatial scales, but over a limited spatial region.

In order to produce stimuli in which luminance cues had been eliminated with an aim to eliciting a chromatic response, preliminary studies of isoluminance determination in adults and infants were undertaken using behavioural and electrophysiological techniques. The results showed close similarity between the isoluminant ratio for adults and infants and all values were close to photometric isoluminance. Pattern reversal VEPs were recorded to stimuli of a range of red/green luminance ratios and an achromatic checkerboard. No transient VEP could be elicited with an isoluminant chromatic pattern reversal stimulus from any infant less than 7 weeks post term and similarly, all infants more than 7 weeks post term showed clear chromatic VEPs. The chromatic response first appeared at that age as a major positive component (P 1) of long latency. This was delayed and reduced in comparison to the achromatic response. As the infant grew older, the latency of the P 1 component decreased with the appearance of N 1 and N by the 10 th week post term. This finding was consistent throughout all infants assessed.

Both systems deliver an estimation of [where], {{that is to say}} the motion and structure of the observed scene and of [what], i. e. the perceptual grouping and labeling of objects in the scene. The long term goal is to elaborate a common theory about precise questions in both neurosciences and algorithms and their architecture in artificial vision, including computer vision applications. Within this framework, the function and behavior of adaptive feedback mechanisms is a key point and on the leading edge of biological studies. The core of this idea is that visual processing is build around: 1) a first computational step allowing to pre-process the input information, provide initial estimates, generate hypotheses about which models to use, ? 2) a refinement step using iterative mechanisms of optimization of the visual perception. Such mechanisms occur, sometimes implicitly, in artificial vision processes. They are mainly related to such problems as the combination of visual attributes, computed from different sources and then fused for ``what'' and ``where'' perceptual tasks; the use of a-priori information, obtained from higher-level visual modules. These modules define models estimated from the data. These models are either given a-priori (e. g. rigidity, shape regularity, [...] ) or chosen thanks to object labeling obtained during the first computational step.

A simple mechanism may account for a vast range of spontaneous perceptual selectivity: Experiences are preferred that maximize the rate of endomorphin release. Such inputs will tend to be those that are richly interpretable (not just complex) insofar as they would produce high activation of associative connections in areas that have the greatest density of mu-opiate receptors. Once an input is experienced, however, competitive learning would serve to reduce activity, resulting in less endomorphin release, leading to habituation and boredom.

Illusions reveal {{some of the}} sophisticated, {{underlying}} neural {{mechanisms that}} often remain hidden in our day-to-day visual experience. Illusions have traditionally been studied using psychological methods, which quantify overall, system-level effects observable at the highest layer of the visual hierarchy. This thesis applies the relatively new technique of computational modelling {{to the study of}} visual illusions, to quantify bias and uncertainty within various levels of our visual system. The method adopted in this thesis merges statistical inferences, obtained from exposure to image subsets, with filtering operations that mimic visual neural processing from layer to layer. Previous computational models of visual illusions have considered these in isolated arrangement. This dissertation highlights the benefits of combinatorial modelling, which includes separating out the contribution of neural operations from potential statistical influences. The first study in this dissertation investigates a well-known line-length illusion in a benchmark model of the visual ventral stream, demonstrating that a model imitating the structure and function of our <b>cortical</b> <b>visual</b> <b>system</b> is susceptible to illusions. In the second study, we further scrutinise this line-length illusion inside each layer of the benchmark model, observing magnitudes of uncertainty and bias that propagate through each level. In the third and final study, we introduce a new model based on exponential filters inspired by contrast statistics of natural images. We apply a suite of lightness illusions to this new model and demonstrate that low-level kernel operations can account for a large set of these illusions. In summary, this thesis shows that combining filtering functions with natural image statistics not only allows for illusory bias and uncertainty to be limited in artificial neural network models. but it also provides further evidence for and against some proposed theories of visual illusions.

40|$|The macaque <b>cortical</b> <b>visual</b> <b>system</b> is hierarchically {{organized}} into two streams, the ventral stream for recognizing objects and the dorsal stream for analyzing spatial relationships. The ventral stream extends from striate cortex or area V 1 to inferior temporal cortex (IT) through extra-striate areas V 2 and V 4. Between V 1 and V 2, the ventral stream {{consists of two}} roughly parallel sub-streams, one extending from the cytochrome oxidase (CO) rich blobs in V 1 to the CO rich thin stripes in V 2, the other extending from the interblobs in V 1 to interstripes, in V 2. The blob-dominated sub-stream is thought to analyze the surface features such as color, whereas the interblob-dominated one is thought to analyze the contour features such as shape. ^ In the current study, the organization of cortical pathways linking V 2 thin stripe and interstripe compartments with area V 4 was investigated {{using a combination of}} physiological and anatomical techniques. Different compartments of V 2 were first characterized, in vivo, using optical recording of intrinsic cortical signals. These functionally derived maps of V 2 stripe compartments were then used to guide iontophoretic injections of multiple, distinguishable, anterograde tracers into specific V 2 compartments. The distribution of labeled axons was analyzed either in horizontal sections through the prelunate gyrus, or in tangentially sectioned portions of physically unfolded cortex containing the lunate sulcus, prelunate gyrus and superior temporal sulcus. When a V 2 thin stripe and adjacent interstripe were injected with distinguishable tracers, a large primary and several secondary foci were observed in V 4. The primary focus from the thin stripe injection was spatially segregated from the primary focus from the V 2 interstripe injection, suggesting a retention of the pattern of compartmentation. ^ We examined the distribution of retrogradely labeled cells in V 1 following the injections of tracers into V 2 different compartments, in order to quantitate just how parallel the two sub-streams are from V 1 to V 2. Our results suggest that both blobs and interblobs project to thin stripes in V 2, whereas only interblobs project to interstripes. This asymmetrical segregation argues against the original proposal of strict parallelism. (Abstract shortened by UMI.) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{ability of}} a human {{observer}} to detect {{the presence of a}} briefly flashed picture of a face can depend on the picture's spatial configuration, that is on whether its features are rearranged (jumbled) or are in their normal configuration. The face-detection effect (FDE) is found under conditions of backward masking, when the presence of a face can be detected with shorter masking intervals when it is in the normal than when in the rearranged configuration. A similar effect is found when the subject is asked to classify the face as rearranged or not - the face-classification effect (FCE). Part of the interest of the FDE and the FCE is that they show how the configuration of a stimulus can be an important factor in the perceptual processing which leads to detection and classification of the stimulus. To analyse these effects we recorded from single neurons in the cortex in the superior temporal sulcus of macaques when they were shown (in a visual fixation task) normal and rearranged faces under backward masking conditions shown in experiments 2 and 3 to produce, with the same apparatus, the FCE, and also to produce comparable effects on the identification of which face was present (called hereafter the face-identification effect), and also of the clarity of the face. We found in experiment 1 that there are some face-selective neurons which respond to faces only, or better, when the features in the faces are in their normal configuration rather than rearranged. We also showed in this experiment that the difference in the response to the normal as compared to the rearranged faces became greater when the masking stimulus was delayed more. Thus, at intermediate delays, there are more neurons active for the normal than for the rearranged face. We therefore propose that the FDE, the FCE, and the face-identification effect arise because the total number of neurons activated by faces in their normal configuration is greater than that activated by rearranged faces, because of the sensitivity of some face-selective neurons to the spatial arrangement of the features. The experiments also show that backward visual masking does produce abrupt termination of the firing of neurons in the temporal <b>cortical</b> <b>visual</b> <b>system,</b> so that the duration of a neuronal response is very short when visual stimuli can just be perceived. </p...|$|E

NVI and its three subtypes—cortical blindness, <b>cortical</b> <b>visual</b> impairment, and delayed visual maturation—must be distinguished from ocular visual impairment {{in terms of their}} different causes and structural foci, the brain and the eye respectively. One diagnostic marker of this distinction is that the pupils of individuals with cortical blindness will respond to light whereas those of individuals with ocular visual impairment will not.|$|R
