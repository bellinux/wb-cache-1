40|$|A conical {{involute}} gear, which resembles {{in shape}} a spur gear-shaper cutter, {{is generated by}} feeding the cutter along any element of the cone. There {{is no question about}} the way of generating a gear with a rack cutter or a spur gear-shaper cutter. 　Now speaking of generating a <b>conical</b> <b>gear,</b> the way of using a hob is practically much commoner and easier than that of using a rack cutter or a gear-shaper cutter. Cutting the gear with a hob comes to the same result with cutting it with a rack cutter set obliquely to the pitch circle of the gear, as the hob is shaped into a screw-like form. Asymmetric teeth are obtained by feeding a rack cutter set obliquely to the pitch circle of the gear along any element of the cone. 　We show in detail the process of generating a <b>conical</b> <b>gear</b> with a hob and the difference between both the normal pitches of {{the right and the left}} profiles of a gear tooth. If the conical gears are mounted on the two parallel shafts, they rotate smoothly, but if they are mounted on the two intersecting shafts in place of the bevel gears, their mesh is not conjugate theoretically...|$|E
40|$|The {{subject is}} the {{aircraft}} bevel gears, which {{are part of}} the drive systems of gas turbine engines and helicopter transmissions. The article deals with defect specifics of the aircraft conical gears with a circular tooth as compared to the <b>conical</b> <b>gear</b> wheels of general engineering. The finite element method has been used to find by calculation that the main reason for destruction of aircraft bevel gears is a resonant vibration excitation of the gear wheel rim due to its nodal diameter eigenvibrations happened to be within the operating range of the transmission rotation frequencies. A parametric finite element model has been developed. It allows us to investigate the impact of modification parameters of the drive side of gear wheels on the function of the kinematic transmission error at different values of transmitted torque. Using the method of main coordinates, a reduced dynamic model of the bevel gear has been developed to allow simulating the vibration intensity of bevel gears with various parameters of the working profile modification. Within the framework of evaluation test of the dynamic model, amplitude-frequency characteristics have been constructed for the main parameters of transmission oscillations, including vibrational stresses in the teeth space. It is found that modification parameters of the transmission drive side {{have a significant effect on}} the vibration intensity of the bevel gears in the entire operating range. The main factor affecting the vibration stress amplitude in the gear wheel is the amplitude of the kinematic error function with the corresponding torque transmitted. The obtained research results can be used when designing the new aircraft drives and modernizing the existing ones. As part of the further development, it is expected to create a technique for recording the damage accumulation in the conical gears, taking into account the typical flight profile of a gas turbine engine or a helicopter. </p...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — This study {{investigates the}} contact stress of concave <b>conical</b> {{involute}} <b>gear</b> pairs with small intersected angles {{by means of}} finite element analysis. The complete mathematical models of the gear pair, including the working tooth surfaces and the fillets have been derived based on the theory of gearing and the generation mechanism. The commercial software, ABAQUS, capable of contact analysis of two 3 -D deformable bodies is applied to evaluate the stress distribution on the tooth surfaces. Several numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the stress analyses of the gear pairs with various gear design parameters. The results show that concave involute gear pairs relieve the high contact stress problem which is inherent in conventional <b>conical</b> involute <b>gear</b> pairs...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{presents}} the results of research undertaken to determine maximum contact pressures, wear and life of <b>conical</b> <b>gears,</b> taking account gear technological correction, tooth engagement and wear-generated changes in curvature of their involute profile. The calculations were made for a reduced cylindrical gear using a method developed by authors. The effect of applied conditions of tooth engagement in the frontal and internal sections of cylindrical gear ring is shown graphically. The initial maximum contact pressures will be higher in the internal section and the highest at the entry of single tooth engagement; the increasing of correcting coefficients will cause the fall of contact and tribocontact pressures; the optimum values of correction coefficients, at which the durability of the gear will be the highest were obtained...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: This paper {{propose a}} method to {{optimise}} the module of cutting <b>conical</b> spur <b>gear,</b> after being wornor broken, {{with the aid of}} Computer-Aided Design (CAD). The suggested method allows determining thegeometric features of a pair of <b>conical</b> spur <b>gear</b> after worn. Design/methodology/approach: The approach consists of drawing real tooth model, with dimensioning characteristicsby CAD; extracting a database of tooth drawing that permits the determination of the real volume by mass destruction. It also allows creating a virtual model, by theoretical geometric characteristics, to calculate the volume. Findings: This approach allows giving an approximation of the conditions of the machine function. However,the optimisation of the module is only a link one chain, for other parameter influences on the good working ofpairs; we could mention the condition of assembly and the tribological aspects. Practical implications: A simulation package, R 2000, was used and an “AutoCAD” software has beendeveloped to accomplish the drawing of 2 D wheel <b>conical</b> spur <b>gear,</b> the verification of the system assemblyand the drawing of a 3 D volume pattern.

40|$|Gear {{theory is}} re-examined {{and we find}} optimal shapes for gears. As {{optimality}} criteria, we allow: (1) minimal frictional losses (highest efficiency) assuming linear law of friction or (2) uniform maximum stress (it will wear out slowly and last the longest) assuming Hertzian contacts or (3) uniform maximal temperature, assuming {{we are in a}} high power limit in which all heat is removed by the lubricant. Some other criteria which have been used before are that (4) mis-spacing the gears still yields perfect gear action with the desired speed ratio or (5) minimal vibration in the low friction limit. Both (4) and (5) lead to "involute gears" which are the standard in engineering practice. Criteria 1, 2, and 3 lead to apparently new gear-tooth forms. We manage to describe these curves with ordinary differential equations (ODEs), and for each of these 3 criteria we find the ODE for both spur (cylinder) and bevel (<b>conical)</b> <b>gears,</b> i. e. a total of 6 ODEs.

50|$|A hypoid {{is a type}} of {{spiral bevel}} gear whose axis does not {{intersect}} with the axis of the meshing gear. The shape of a hypoid gear is a revolved hyperboloid (that is, the pitch surface of the hypoid gear is a hyperbolic surface), whereas the shape of a spiral bevel <b>gear</b> is normally <b>conical.</b> The hypoid <b>gear</b> places the pinion off-axis to the crown wheel (ring gear) which allows the pinion to be larger in diameter and have more contact area. In hypoid gear design, the pinion and gear are practically always of opposite hand, and the spiral angle of the pinion is usually larger than that of the gear. The hypoid pinion is then larger in diameter than an equivalent bevel pinion.|$|R
