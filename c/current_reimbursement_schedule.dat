40|$|Objective: We {{compared}} the estimated costs of coronary interventions from our hospital's cost accounting system {{with data from}} the French Diagnosis Related Group (DRG) cost database, taking the perspective of our hospital. Design: Cost data on hospital resources used by patients hospitalised for acute myocardial infarction (MI), with and without complications, including deceased patients, were collected in a tertiary care university hospital located in Paris, France. The data were collected using the hospital's cost accounting system and then compared with the estimates provided by the DRG reimbursement schedule for similar conditions. Main outcome measures and results: The estimated costs were 849 euro (EUR) for coronary angiography, EUR 4762 for coronary angioplasty with stenting, and EUR 4978 to 8067 for MI. The DRG reimbursement schedule provided for acute MI was EUR 3920 to 5709. Conclusions: Although the current cost of treating acute MI in a teaching hospital is reasonably close {{to that in the}} <b>current</b> <b>reimbursement</b> <b>schedule,</b> rapid technological changes regarding both drugs and devices renders necessary a close monitoring of costs associated with the management of these acute care patients.

We are able to identify a level for the policy maker’s elasticity of utility with respect to its policy tool under which government insured patients are unambiguously better off with policy commitment. The ordering of welfare is reversed if the elasticity of utility is reversed. In either case, privately insured patients may be better or worse off. ...|$|R

Understanding the sources of variability in the cost of radiation therapy is critical to evaluating the efficiency of the <b>current</b> <b>reimbursement</b> system and could shape future policy reform. This study defines the magnitude and sources of variation in the cost of radiation therapy for a large cohort of Medicare beneficiaries. We identified 55, 288 patients within the SEER database diagnosed with breast, lung, or prostate cancer between 2004 and 2009. The cost of radiation therapy was estimated from Medicare reimbursements. Multivariable linear regression models were used to assess the influence of patient, tumor, and radiation therapy provider characteristics on variation in cost of radiation therapy. For breast, lung, and prostate cancers, the median cost (interquartile range) of a course of radiation therapy was $ 8, 600 ($ 7, 300 to $ 10, 300), $ 9, 000 ($ 7, 500 to $ 11, 100), and $ 18, 000 ($ 11, 300 to $ 25, 500), respectively. For all three cancer subtypes, patient- or tumor-related factors accounted for < 3 % of the variation in cost. Factors unrelated to the patient, including practice type, geography, and individual radiation therapy provider, accounted for a substantial proportion of the variation in cost, ranging from 44 % with breast, 43 % with lung, and 61 % with prostate cancer. In this study, factors unrelated to the individual patient accounted for the majority of variation in the cost of radiation therapy, suggesting potential inefficiency in health care expenditure.

METHODS: A "time-motion" method {{was used to measure}} labor costs of providing vaccinations in 13 private and public practices. Practices reported non-labor costs. The authors determined reimbursement by record review. RESULTS: The average vaccine delivery cost per dose (excluding vaccine cost) ranged from $ 4. 69 for community health centers to $ 5. 60 for private practices. Average reimbursement exceeded average delivery costs for all vaccines and contributed to overhead in private practices. Average reimbursement was less than total cost (vaccine-delivery costs + overhead) in private practices for most vaccines in one region with significant managed care penetration. Reimbursement to public providers was less than the average vaccine delivery costs.

The purpose of this study was to examine the cost effectiveness of rhIGF-I therapy in patients who have ALS. Design: We performed a cost-effectiveness analysis from the societal perspective on 177 patients who received treatment with rhIGF-I or placebo in a North American randomised clinical trial. We estimated the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of rhIGF-I using resource utilisation and functional status measurements from the clinical trial. Costs were estimated from 1996 US Medicare <b>reimbursement</b> <b>schedules.</b> Utility weights were elicited from ALS healthcare providers using the standard gamble technique. Main outcome measures and results: The overall cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained for rhIGF-I therapy compared with placebo was $US 67 440. For the subgroups of patients who were progressing rapidly or were in earlier stages of disease at enrolment, rhIGF-I cost $US 52 823 and $US 43 197 per QALY gained, respectively.
