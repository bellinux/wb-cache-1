40|$|Relation {{among various}} {{expressions}} of the <b>complex</b> <b>admittance</b> for quantum systems in contact with heat reservoir is studied. Exact {{expressions of the}} <b>complex</b> <b>admittance</b> are derived in various types of formulations of equations of motion under contact with heat reservoir. Namely, the <b>complex</b> <b>admittance</b> is studied in the relaxation method and the external-field method. In the former method, the admittance is calculated using the Kubo formula for quantum systems in contact with heat reservoir in no external driving fields, while in the latter method the admittance is directly calculated from equations of motion with external driving terms. In each method, two types of equation of motions are considered, i. e., the time-convolution (TC) equation and time-convolutionless (TCL) equation. That is, the full of the four cases are studied. It is {{turned out that the}} expression of the <b>complex</b> <b>admittance</b> obtained by using the relaxation method with the TC equation exactly coincides with that obtained by using the external-field method with the TC equation, while other two methods give different forms. It is also explicitly demonstrated that all the expressions of the <b>complex</b> <b>admittance</b> coincide with each other in the lowest Born approximation for the systemreservoir interaction. The formulae necessary for the higher order expansions in powers of the system-reservoir interaction are derived, and also the expressions of the admittance in the n-th order approximation are given. To characterize the TC and TCL methods, we study the expressions of the admittances of two exactly solvable models. Each exact form of admittance is compared with the results of the two methods in the lowest Born approximation. It is found that depending on the model, either of TC and TCL would be the better method. Comment: 34 pages, no figur...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: When {{turbulent}} wind {{impacts on}} a bridge, the dynamic {{behavior of the}} structure {{is influenced by the}} incoming flow turbulence intensity, making difficult to predict the deck vibration level and safety condition.

This method {{assumes that the}} cross-section of the duct is uniform and that the duct is of a considerable length so that the longitudinal modes can be neglected. The problem is reduced to a two-dimensional (2 D) finite element (FE) solution, from which a set of cross-sectional eigen-values and eigen-functions are determined. This result is used to obtain the modal frequencies, velocities and the attenuation coefficients. The 2 D FE solution is then extended to three-dimensional via the normal mode decomposition technique.

40|$|Scope of this {{dissertation}} is {{to investigate}} {{the influence of the}} electromagnetic properties of the earth on the wave propagation characteristics of overhead power lines and underground power cables in transient responses. The fundamental methodology for the calculation of the per unit length circuit parameters of the overhead transmission lines and underground cables is presented, with special emphasis on the influence of the earth on these parameters as expressed through proper correction terms. The earth correction terms are calculated using novel expressions derived from the solution of the EM field equations, using the Herzian Vector approach. Individual earth correction terms are calculated for the self and mutual complex series impedances and the <b>complex</b> shunt <b>admittances</b> and so the proposed model can be also applied to practical multiconductor transmission line and cable configurations. The proposed model both for the overhead power lines and the underground cable arrangements has a generalized form, since it can include cases with arbitrary resistivities, permittivities, and permeabilities of all propagation media, while it takes into account earth stratification. Therefore, it can be used in simulations of the transmission lines, covering a wide range of power engineering operational states, from steady state up to very fast transients and Power Line Communications (PLC). The accuracy of the proposed model is justified, comparing the obtained results with the corresponding from other simplified models. Furthermore a systematic investigation of the influence of the earth electromagnetic properties on the wave propagation characteristics and transient responses in transmission system arrangements is implemented. ...|$|R

Cavitation is included through the boundary conditions on the suction sides of the blades, where it is assumed to occur uniformly in a small layer of given thickness and <b>complex</b> acoustic <b>admittance</b> depending on the void fraction of the vapor phase and the parametric value of the phase-shift damping used to account for the energy dissipation in the {{dynamics of the}} cavitating layer. Constant boundary conditions for the total pressure are imposed at the inlet and outlet sections of the inducer blade channels. The three-dimensional unsteady governing equations are written in rotating "body fitted" orthogonal helical coordinates, linearized for small-amplitude whirl perturbations of the mean steady flow, and solved by modal decomposition. The whirl excitation and the boundary conditions generate internal flow resonances in the blade channels of the inducer, leading to a complex dependence of the lateral rotordynamic fluid forces on the whirl speed, the properties of the cavitating layer and the flow coefficient of the machine. Multiple subsynchronous and supersynchronous resonances are predicted. At higher levels of cavitation the amplitudes of the resonances decrease and their frequencies approach the rotational speed (synchronous conditions). Comparison with available experimental data indicates that the present theory correctly evaluates the observed magnitude of the rotordynamic forces as functions of the whirl frequency and their stabilizing or destabilizing effects on the whirl motion.

Constant boundary conditions for the total pressure are imposed at the inlet and outlet sections of the impeller blade channels. The unsteady governing equations are written in rotating “body fitted” orthogonal coordinates, linearized for small-amplitude whirl perturbations of the mean steady flow, and solved by modal decomposition. In helical turbopump inducers the whirl excitation and the boundary conditions generate internal flow resonances in the blade channels, leading to a complex dependence of the lateral rotordynamic fluid forces on the whirl speed, the dynamic properties of the cavitation region and the flow coefficient of the machine. Multiple subsynchronous and supersynchronous resonances are predicted. At higher levels of cavitation the amplitudes of these resonances decrease and their frequencies approach the rotational speed (synchronous conditions). On the other hand, application of the same approach indicates that no such resonances occur in whirling and cavitating centrifugal impellers and that the rotordynamic fluid forces are almost insensitive to cavitation, consistently with the available experimental evidence. Comparison with the scant data from the literature indicates that the present theory correctly captures the observed features and parametric trends of rotordynamic forces on whirling and cavitating turbopump impellers.
