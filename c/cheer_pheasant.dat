The park, covering an area of , contains luxuriant forests mainly composed of blue pine, spruce, cypress, poplar, fir and birch. It is habitat for the endangered snow leopard, the blue sheep and many species of birds such as Himalayan monal, blood pheasant, <b>cheer</b> <b>pheasant</b> and snow partridge. It is a religious Buddhist site.|$|E
50|$|<b>Cheer</b> <b>pheasant,</b> {{which became}} extinct in Pakistan, was {{planned to be}} reintroduced in the region. The World Pheasants Association sent 90 eggs of the species to the Dhodial Pheasantry. Among the eggs which hatched, the {{mortality}} was high and remained high till 1995. This situation got better in 1996. In 1997, a parent flock of 40 pairs was raised and eventually reintroduction of the <b>cheer</b> <b>pheasant</b> in Hazara District was carried out. As of 2007, there are around 60 pairs of <b>cheer</b> <b>pheasant</b> in the Dhodial Pheasantry.|$|E

50|$|The {{introduction}} of captives of unknown pedigree can {{pose a threat}} to native populations. Domestic fowl have threatened endemic species such as Gallus g. bankiva while pheasants such as the ring-necked <b>pheasant</b> and captive <b>cheer</b> <b>pheasants</b> of uncertain origin have escaped into the wild or have been intentionally introduced. Green peafowl of similar mixed origins confiscated from local bird dealers have been released into areas with native wild birds.|$|R
50|$|The {{sanctuary}} has mainly mammals. Large mammals include rhesus macaque, leopards, Indian muntjac and crested porcupine. Some of {{the other}} species found in the area include Himalayan black bear, wild boar, common langur, sambar and black naped hare. European red deer were also introduced {{half a century ago}} by the former Maharaja of Patiala but none of them were sighted in 1988 as per the survey conducted. The cheer breeding and rehabilitation centre has helped {{increase in the number of}} <b>cheer</b> <b>pheasants</b> nearby.|$|R

50|$|The <b>cheer</b> <b>pheasant</b> is {{distributed}} in the highlands and scrublands of the Himalayas region of India, Nepal, Kashmir and Pakistan. They are found mainly in the west of Nepal, Kumaon, Garhwal, Tehri Garhwal, Simla States, Bussahir, Kullu, Chamba till about the Hazara District. Surveys in 1981 and 2003 in the Dhorpatan area of western Nepal established 70 calling sites, suggesting substantial numbers exist in this area (approximately 200 birds). In another survey in 2010, <b>cheer</b> <b>pheasant</b> was detected in 21 calling sites in Kullu district of Himachal Pradesh. They are found mainly above 6000 feet altitude and up to 10000 feet in summer.|$|E
50|$|Although {{there is}} not a rich variety of {{wildlife}} here when compared to tropical rainforest for example the region is important habitat, especially for birds. Wildlife includes tigers and leopards although in smaller numbers than in the lowland areas where herds of grazing antelopes provide food for them, whereas these slopes do not sustain grazing in large numbers. More typical animals of the pine forest are langurs and other animals of the Himalayas. Birds include the chestnut-breasted partridge and <b>cheer</b> <b>pheasants</b> that hide in the lush grass.|$|R
50|$|One of the pheasantry’s many successes is {{housing the}} world’s largest flock of <b>Cheer</b> <b>pheasants</b> raised in captivity. This bird became extinct in the 1970s, {{and is now}} being re-introduced in the country. The pheasantry, besides {{accomplishing}} its primary purpose, also aims {{to educate the public}} about pheasant culture. In pursuit of this, the NWFP Wildlife Department formed an NWFP Wildlife Conservation Club. The Mansehra Club, alone, includes over three dozen public and private schools. The club focuses on strengthening the relationship between youth and nature. The documentary brings to light how diverse peoples can, and do, come together on a shared platform for the love of nature.|$|R

50|$|The <b>cheer</b> <b>{{pheasant}},</b> (Catreus wallichii), {{also known}} as Wallich's pheasant is a vulnerable species of the pheasant family, Phasianidae. It is the only member in monotypic genus Catreus. The scientific name commemorates the Danish botanist Nathaniel Wallich.|$|E
60|$|We may {{therefore}} {{conclude that the}} females of distinct though allied species have often had their plumage rendered more or less different by the transference in various degrees of characters acquired by the males through sexual selection, both during former and recent times. But it deserves especial attention that brilliant colours have been transferred much more rarely than other tints. For instance, the male of the red-throated blue- breast (Cyanecula suecica) has a rich blue breast, including a sub- triangular red mark; now marks of nearly the same shape have been transferred to the female, but the central space is fulvous instead of red, and is surrounded by mottled instead of blue feathers. The Gallinaceae offer many analogous cases; for none of the species, such as partridges, quails, guinea-fowls, etc., in which the colours of the plumage have been largely transferred from the male to the female, are brilliantly coloured. This is well exemplified with the pheasants, in which the male is generally so much more brilliant than the female; but with the Eared and <b>Cheer</b> <b>pheasants</b> (Crossoptilon auritum and Phasianus wallichii) the sexes closely resemble each other and their colours are dull. We may {{go so far as}} to believe that if any part of the plumage in the males of these two pheasants had been brilliantly coloured, it would not have been transferred to the females. These facts strongly support Mr. Wallace's view that with birds which are exposed to much danger during incubation, the transference of bright colours from the male to the female has been checked through natural selection. We must not, however, forget that another explanation, before given, is possible; namely, that the males which varied and became bright, whilst they were young and inexperienced, would have been exposed to much danger, and would generally have been destroyed; the older and more cautious males, on the other hand, if they varied in a like manner, would not only have been able to survive, but would have been favoured in their rivalry with other males. Now variations occurring late in life tend to be transmitted exclusively to the same sex, so that in this case extremely bright tints would not have been transmitted to the females. On the other hand, ornaments of a less conspicuous kind, such as those possessed by the Eared and <b>Cheer</b> <b>pheasants,</b> would not have been dangerous, and if they appeared during early youth, would generally have been transmitted to both sexes.|$|R
60|$|Although so many {{pheasants}} {{and allied}} gallinaceous birds carefully display their beautiful plumage before the females, it is remarkable, as Mr. Bartlett informs me, {{that this is}} not the case with the dull-coloured Eared and <b>Cheer</b> <b>pheasants</b> (Crossoptilon auritum and Phasianus Wallichii); so that these birds seem conscious that they have little beauty to display. Mr. Bartlett has never seen the males of either of these species fighting together, though he has not had such good opportunities for observing the Cheer as the Eared pheasant. Mr. Jenner Weir, also, finds that all male birds with rich or strongly-characterised plumage are more quarrelsome than the dull-coloured species belonging to the same groups. The goldfinch, for instance, is far more pugnacious than the linnet, and the blackbird than the thrush. Those birds which undergo a seasonal change of plumage likewise become much more pugnacious at the period when they are most gaily ornamented. No doubt the males of some obscurely-coloured birds fight desperately together, but it appears that when sexual selection has been highly influential, and has given bright colours to the males of any species, it has also very often given a strong tendency to pugnacity. We shall meet with nearly analogous cases when we treat of mammals. On the other hand, with birds the power of song and brilliant colours have rarely been both acquired by the males of the same species; but in this case, the advantage gained would have been identically the same, namely success in charming the female. Nevertheless it must be owned that the males of several brilliantly-coloured birds have had their feathers specially modified for the sake of producing instrumental music, though the beauty of this cannot be compared, at least according to our taste, with that of the vocal music of many songsters.|$|R
40|$|The phylogenetic {{relationships}} of 21 pheasant and 6 non-pheasant species were determined using nucleotide sequences from the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene. Maximum parsimony and maximum likelihood analysis {{were used to}} try to resolve the phylogenetic relationships within Phasianidae. Both the degree of resolution and strength of support are improved over previous studies due to the testing of a number of species from multiple pheasant genera, but several major ambiguities persist. Polyplectron bicalcaratum (grey peacock pheasant) is shown not to be a pheasant. Alternatively, it appears ancestral to either the partridges or peafowl. Pucrasia macrolopha macrolopha (koklass) and Gallus gallus (red jungle fowl) both emerge as non-pheasant genera. Monophyly of the pheasant group is challenged if Pucrasia macrolopha macrolopha and Gallus gallus are considered to be pheasants. The placement of Catreus wallichii (<b>cheer)</b> within the <b>pheasants</b> also remains undetermined, as does the cause for the great sequence divergence in Chrysolophus pictus obscurus (black-throated golden). These results suggest that alterations in taxonomic classifications may be required for some pheasant species and genera. Pheasants {{are one of the most}} endangered groups of birds in the world.
