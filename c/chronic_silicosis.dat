5000|$|The {{preventable}} {{disabling disease}} of silicosis has three main types, chronic, acute and accelerated. <b>Chronic</b> <b>silicosis</b> {{is the most}} common occurring after 10-20 years of low to moderate exposure of respirable crystalline silica. [...] Current studies have shown workers exposed to silica at the current recommend exposure limits (REL) during a lifetime of work develop <b>chronic</b> <b>silicosis.</b> A chest x-ray is used to diagnose <b>chronic</b> <b>silicosis,</b> which has similar symptoms as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). General symptoms are shortness of breath, productive or nonproductive cough, fatigue, and occasionally respiratory failure. ccelerated silicosis has similar symptoms as <b>chronic</b> <b>silicosis,</b> however it develops rapidly in 5-10 years of high exposure to respirable crystalline silica. Lastly, acute silicosis is less prevalent than the other types, however it is a more severe disease with a high occurrence of disability and death. Acute silicosis develops between several months to years with extreme levels of silica exposure, and severe symptoms include shortness of breath, weakness, cough, fever and weight loss. Setting effective control levels and monitoring the adherence to those levels will be crucial in preventing silicosis.|$|E

40|$|Inhalation of respirable {{crystalline}} silica (RCS) {{may lead to}} lung diseases, e. g. <b>chronic</b> inflammation, <b>silicosis</b> and cancer. In 1997 RCS has been classified as human carcinogen by the IARC, but the multifactorial aspects of RCS toxicity were acknowledged and industry and science were encouraged to characterise the properties of RCS-containing dusts from various industrial sectors by physicochemical methods and to discriminate their toxic potential by appropriate in vitro/in vivo tests. The SILICERAM project has thus been initiated as a European Collective Research Project to provide those, responsible for setting legislation, with data that will ensure definition of appropriate RCS air limits for the ceramic industry. Within the SILICERAM project, the suitability of the in vitro alkaline comet assay (CA) for screening of the genotoxic potential of ceramic dusts was investigated. Primary rat alveolar macrophages, pre-cultured for 24 h, were used as a model system. Mid-size DQ 12 quartz was chosen as a positive control, demonstrating an almost linear, concentration-dependent (25 - 200 µg/cm 2) induction of DNA strand breaks (SB) after 2 h of incubation. SB formation was inhibited by co-treatment with 10 µM aluminium lactate, indicating a quartz-specific, surface-dependent clastogenic effect. In addition, DQ 12 induced PGE 2 liberation and LDH release. TiO 2 Bayertitan T (rutile) was investigated as a potential negative control, but was shown to be inappropriate. Unexpectedly, TiO 2 induced {{a significant increase in}} SB formation, not counteracted by aluminium lactate. Unlike TiO 2, Al 2 O 3 could subsequently be identified as an appropriate negative control for the CA. Contrived samples (representative of mineral mixtures employed in ceramic production) composed of different amounts of DQ 12, China clay, and feldspar were investigated and could be ranked by their RCS content. Using the optimised CA, different ceramic dust samples collected in the tile, table- and sanitary ware, refractory and brick sector, will be screened and ranked concerning their genotoxic potential. Aluminium lactate will be used to differentiate quartz-dependent and -independent effects...|$|R

40|$|The {{two major}} lung {{diseases}} of miners are "blacklung" and silicosis. Blacklung, or pneumoconiosis, was first {{recognized as a}} disease of British coal miners in the 1600 s. However, investigations into the cause of blacklung disease did not begin until the 1900 s. The causative agent of pneumoconiosis in coal miners {{was thought to be}} silica until studies in the United Kingdom provided evidence that expo- sure to coal dust containing minimal silica could also cause pneumoconiosis. In the Federal Coal Mine Health and Safety Act of 1969, coal workers pneumoconiosis (CWP) was defined as "a chronic dust disease of the lung arising out of employment in an underground coal mine. " Diagnosis of CWP is generally based on chest x-ray findings and a patient's history of working in coal mines, usually for 10 or more years. In its early stages, CWP is called "simple CWP. " Miners with simple CWP are at increased risk of developing an advanced stage of the disease, called "progressive massive fibrosis" pMF) or "complicated CWP. " PMF (complicated CWP) is associated with significant decreases in lung function and oxygen- diffusing capacity. PMF is also associated with breathlessness, chronic bronchitis, recurrent chest illness, and episodes of heart failure. Coal miners with silicotic lesions or PMF have an increased risk of tuberculosis and other mycobacterial infections. PMF may progress {{even in the absence of}} further dust exposure. This disease is also associated with increased mortality (National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health [NIOSH] 1995). The most recent study to determine the prevalence of CWP in coal workers was in the mid- 1990 s. The average prevalence of CWP was 2. 8 %, but for those with 30 or more years in the industry it was 14 %. For the 10 -year period from 1987 to 1996, 18, 245 deaths were attributed to CWP. The most frequently recorded occupation on the death certificate (70 %) was mining machine operator (NIOSH 1999). Silicosis may develop when inhaled respirable crystalline silica (quartz) is deposited in the lungs. The clinical diagnosis of silicosis is based on (1) recognition by the physician that the level of silica exposure is adequate to cause the disease, (2) the presence of chest radiographic abnormalities consistent with silicosis, and (3) the absence of other illnesses (e. g., tuberculosis or pulmonary fungal infection) that may mimic silicosis. The radiographic patterns are often the same for CWP and silicosis; thus, these diseases are sometimes distinguishable only by work history or pathological examination. <b>Chronic</b> <b>silicosis</b> commonly involves 15 or more years of exposure to silica. The characteristic microscopic feature is the silicotic nodule. <b>Chronic</b> <b>silicosis</b> is often asymptomatic and may manifest itself as a radiographic abnormality with small, rounded opacities of less than 10 mm in diameter, predominantly in the upper lobes. Lung function may be normal or show mild restriction. <b>Chronic</b> <b>silicosis</b> is also associated with a predisposition to tuberculosis and other mycobacterial infections and with progression to complicated silicosis...|$|E
40|$|Silicosis is an {{occupational}} lung disease caused by inhalation of crystalline silica.

40|$|Exposure to {{coal mine}} dust and/or {{crystalline}} silica results in pneumoconiosis with initiation and progression of pulmonary fibrosis. This review presents characteristics of simple and complicated coal workers ' pneumoconiosis (CWP) {{as well as}} pathologic indices of acute and <b>chronic</b> <b>silicosis</b> by summarizing results of in vitro, animal, and human investigations. These results support four basic mechanisms in the etiology of CWP and silicosis: a) direct cytotoxicity of coal dust or silica, resulting in lung cell damage, release of lipases and proteases, and eventual lung scarring; b) activation of oxidant production by pulmonary phagocytes, which overwhelms the antioxidant defenses and leads to lipid peroxidation, protein nitrosation, cell injury, and lung scarring; c) activation of mediator release from alveolar macrophages and epithelial cells, which leads to recruitment of polymorphonuclear leukocytes and macrophages, resulting {{in the production of}} proinflammatory cytokines and reactive species and in further lung injury and scarring; o) secretion of growth factors from alveolar macrophages and epithelial cells, stimulating fibroblast proliferation and eventual scarring. Results of in vitro and animal studies provide a basis for proposing these mechanisms for the initiation and progression of pneumoconiosis.

I present {{the case of a}} 63 -year-old male who worked in DOE facilities for 30 years as a weapons testing technician. In addition to silica, other workplace exposures included beryllium, various solvents and heavy metals, depleted uranium, and ionizing radiation. In 1989 a painful macular skin lesion was biopsied and diagnosed as leukocytoclastic vasculitis. By 1992 he developed gross hematuria and dyspnea. Blood laboratory results revealed a serum creatinine concentration of 2. 1 mg/dL, ethrythrocyte sedimentation rate of 61 mm/hr, negative cANCA (antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody cytoplasmic pattern), positive pANCA (ANCA perinuclear pattern), and antiglomerular basement membrane negative. Renal biopsy showed proliferative (crescentric) and necrotizing glomerulonephritis. The patient’s diagnoses included microscopic polyangiitis, systemic necrotizing vasculitis, leukocytoclastic vasculitis, and glomerulonephritis.

40|$|Occupational {{exposures}} to respirable crystalline silica {{are associated with}} the development of silicosis, lung cancer, pulmonary tuberculosis, and airways diseases. These exposures may also be related to the development of autoimmune disorders, chronic renal disease, and other adverse health effects. Recent epidemiologic studies demonstrate that workers have a significant risk of developing <b>chronic</b> <b>silicosis</b> when they are exposed to respirable crystalline silica over a working lifetime at the current Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) permissible exposure limit (PEL), the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) PEL, or the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) recommended exposure limit (REL). This NIOSH Hazard Review examines the health risks and diseases associated with occupational {{exposures to}} respirable crystalline silica, discusses important findings of recent epidemiologic studies, provides the reader with sources of more comprehensive information about health effects and experimental studies describes current sampling and analytical methods and their limitations for assessing occupational exposures to respirable crystalline silica, and suggests many areas for further research. Current sampling and analytical methods used to evaluate occupational exposure to respirable crystalline silica do not meet the accuracy criterion needed to quantify exposures at concentrations below the NIOSH REL of 0. 05 mg/m 3 as a time-weighted average (TWA) for up to a 10 -hr workday during a 40 -hr workweek. Until improved sampling and analytical methods are developed for respirable crystalline silica, NIOSH will continue to recommend an exposure limit of 0. 05 mg/m 3 {{to reduce the risk of}} developing silicosis, lung cancer, and other adverse health effects. NIOSH also recommends minimizing the risk of illness that remains for workers exposed at the REL by substituting less hazardous materials for crystalline silica when feasible, by using appropriate respiratory protection when source controls cannot keep exposures below the NIOSH REL, and by making medical examinations available to exposed workers.

40|$|Researchers {{studying}} dust generation from blasthole drills {{developed a}} simple, quick fix that reduced respirable dust concentrations {{by more than}} 63 % at the dump point. This device, which requires almost no maintenance, is small and inexpensive, and it will help operators maintain compliance to the dust standard. The thought process was that a reduction of respirable dust {{at any of the}} multiple sources on the drill, in this case the dust collector dump point, should reduce the total respirable dust generated by the drill. The U. S. Mine Safety & Health Administration (MSHA) has a coal respirable dust standard of 2 milligrams per cubic meter (mg/m 3) for an 8 -hour shift. MSHA and mine operators periodically collect personal dust samples to determine compliance with this dust standard. Drill operators have one of the highest exposure levels to respirable dust. This has been proven through many reviews of the MSHA dust sampling database. Prior to 1987, the highwall driller at surface coal mines had the most severe exposure to respirable silica dust, a trend that continues today based on MSHA's respirable dust sampling database. A review of the MSHA database for the years 1985 through 1992 shows that 81 % of the respirable silica dust samples taken exceeded the permissible exposure limit for the highwall drill operator at surface coal mines. A more recent review of the MSHA database, for the years 1996 through 2000, shows that only 31 % of the respirable silica dust samples taken exceeded the respirable silica dust limit for the highwall driller at surface coal mines. This suggests a substantial improvement in preventing the exposure of silica dust to the highwall drill operator. The drill operator, however, still tops the list of job occupations that have the highest exposure to respirable silica dust Respirable dust {{has been shown to be}} harmful to human health, especially when silica is present in the dust. It causes a disease known as silicosis, which can occur in three levels: <b>chronic</b> <b>silicosis,</b> which occurs after 10 years of exposure; accelerated silicosis, which occurs between 5 and 10 years of exposure; and acute silicosis, which can occur within a few weeks to five years of very high exposure to silica dust. Respirable dust consists of the dust particle size fraction whose median diameter is 4 micrometers (m). The drilling machine generates high concentrations of respirable dust from several sources: drill table shroud leakage, dust leakage through the table bushing, dust discharge from the dust collector exhaust due to impaired filters, and dust entrained from the dust collector fines dumped onto the bench. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health's (NIOSH) Pittsburgh Research Lab (PRL) has been studying different methods to reduce respirable dust from these sources. During its testing, the institute identified a simple solution that reduces the amount of respirable dust generated at the collector dump point...|$|E
