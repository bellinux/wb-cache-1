Investigating Italian parliament members discovered that Central Energy Italian Gas Holding (CEIGH), a part of the <b>Centrex</b> Group, was {{to play a major role}} in the lucrative agreement. Bruno Mentasti-Granelli, a close friend of Berlusconi, owned 33 percent of CEIGH. The Italian parliament blocked the contract and accused Berlusconi of having a personal interest in the Eni-Gazprom agreement.|$|E

The site is located immediately north of Lipson Cove. The proposed port (if approved) will be capable of loading Capesize ships (either directly or by transshipment) for export of iron ore and potentially, grain.|$|E

50|$|Bell Labs {{took over}} <b>Centrex</b> {{development}} in the late 1960s. The NYTel version was designated <b>Centrex</b> I, and the Bell Labs revision <b>Centrex</b> II with additional features. The unreliable Step switches were replaced by a <b>Centrex</b> Position Link Circuit (CXPL), a small, dedicated two stage crossbar network. In the early 1970s <b>Centrex</b> III arrived, a complete redesign bringing more versatility to the old 5XB system. Rather than incoming trunks having appearances on the ordinary Line Link Frame for transfer purposes, <b>Centrex</b> III (or Phase 3 <b>Centrex)</b> had a separate four stage Transfer Network of six-wire crossbar switches to connect to a Transfer Trunk. CXPL continued in use for connecting to consoles. Among other changes, the Phase 3 consoles used DTMF rather than multifrequency pulsing. The <b>Centrex</b> product line was also extended down-market, with <b>Centrex</b> Small Business for customers having mere dozens of lines and no attendant console.|$|E
50|$|<b>Centrex</b> was {{responsible}} for overseeing the design and delivery of probationer training, investigators training and other key areas. <b>Centrex</b> was also responsible for evaluating police training {{to see if it}} actually works. <b>Centrex</b> also set the national police promotion exams, probationer development tests and advised on the assessment of recruits.|$|E
50|$|In the United States, {{the usage}} of <b>Centrex</b> lines has fallen {{over the past decade}} from 16.5 million in 2002 to 10.7 million in 2008 as users {{transition}} to IP-PBX (through VoIP). <b>Centrex</b> continues to be used by large institutions, government agencies, and universities as most of the equipment has already been paid for, though leasing <b>Centrex</b> lines may be more expensive.|$|E
50|$|Schlaff {{also owns}} {{a company in}} Cyprus which is {{registered}} at the same address as <b>Centrex</b> Holding and shares some directors with Gazprom companies. Schlaff, <b>Centrex,</b> and Robert Nowikovsky share the same press officer in Vienna.Nowikovsky is involved with <b>Centrex</b> Group and a director of Central Energy Italian Gas Holding, a company which was found to secretly benefit Silvio Berlusconi's friend in an Italian-Russian gas deal.|$|E
50|$|<b>Centrex,</b> {{the common}} {{name of the}} Central Police Training and Development Authority (CPTDA), was {{established}} under Part 4 of the Criminal Justice and Police Act 2001, and was the primary means of police training in England and Wales. It was based at Bramshill House, {{formerly known as the}} Police Staff College, Bramshill. <b>Centrex</b> had the responsibility for many aspects of police training and development. There had been a move away from running Police Training Centres to running police trainee/initial probationer courses in-house under the auspices of <b>Centrex.</b> <b>Centrex</b> was replaced by the National Policing Improvement Agency (NPIA) on 1 April 2007.|$|E
50|$|<b>Centrex</b> was {{staffed by}} {{a mixture of}} non-police {{officers}} (civil servants) and seconded police officers. <b>Centrex</b> had five main Foundation Training sites at Ashford, Kent, Bruche, St Dials in Cwmbran, Ryton-on-Dunsmore and Aykley Heads in Durham.|$|E
5000|$|Customized <b>Centrex</b> is {{the most}} {{flexible}} (and most expensive) <b>Centrex</b> service as it offers a highly customizable set of options that require specialized programming and troubleshooting skills to maintain. A typical Customized <b>Centrex</b> setup will allow 4-digit dialing between [...] "locals" [...] (perhaps {{even if they are}} located {{in different parts of the}} city), customized routing through the telephone network (such as Least Cost Routing or Time of Day Routing), and customized codes for invoking features.|$|E
50|$|<b>Centrex</b> is a PBX-like service {{providing}} switching {{at the central}} office instead of at the customer's premises.

50|$|<b>Centrex</b> Data {{services}} can provide relatively low speed (56 and 64 kbit/s) data services utilizing the circuit-switched telephone network.

5000|$|<b>Centrex</b> obviates {{the need}} for {{separate}} exchange lines delivered to a site for use with a 1A2 Key System or similar, or PBX. Instead, telephone extensions, called <b>Centrex</b> lines, are delivered directly from the local exchange to the user. Some customers, however, still like to use a key telephone system for a small office within the large corporate <b>Centrex,</b> in an arrangement called [...] "key behind Centrex". Unlike with a conventional PBX, {{it is a simple}} matter to have extensions at different locations while allowing them to function as if they were within the same building. Newer IP PBX systems also allow phones at any location with a WAN or Internet connection to act as a local extension. Facilities such as Direct Inward Dialing (DID), where individual extensions are offered a direct and unique telephone number for incoming calls, are standard features in a <b>Centrex</b> environment. Stations may also be part of a hunt group, allowing for automatic distribution of incoming calls to two or more extensions.|$|E

The project was conceived by <b>Centrex</b> Metals Ltd for the export of iron ore from prospective iron ore deposits at Wilgerup and {{in the hills of}} Koppio on Lower Eyre Peninsula. The port project was also dependent on the approval of the Fusion Magnetite Project, which was a joint venture partnership between <b>Centrex</b> Metals Ltd and Wuhan Iron & Steel (Group) Co, a Chinese government steelmaking enterprise.

50|$|<b>Centrex</b> {{was invented}} in the mid 1960s by the Engineering Department of New York Telephone to replace the PBX switchboards of large customers. It was a feature package of the 5XB {{crossbar}} system. Much equipment had to be redesigned, including incoming trunks and markers. The redesigned equipment was so expensive that usually a separate 5XB switch was used just for <b>Centrex</b> customers, while POTS (Plain Old Telephone Service) customers were wired to an unmodified exchange.|$|E
