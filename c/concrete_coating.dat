[...] The project was spearheaded {{by two of the}} Dowse sons, Philip and Curtis, and supported by the Comstock Community Club. [...] In the course of several years, over $6,000 was raised for the project. [...] A fence was built to exclude cattle from the house. [...] The roof was repaired and reshingled. [...] The exterior walls were reinforced and repaired with new sod blocks, cut with a horse-drawn plow about [...] from the house; additional <b>concrete</b> <b>coating</b> was applied in places. [...] The porch walls were re-shingled, and doors and windows were replaced. [...] Inside the house, the manure covering the floors was removed, and the wood flooring repaired; the plaster on the walls was patched or replaced, up to 20 layers of old wallpaper was removed, and new wallpaper applied in places. [...] Pioneer-era interior furnishings such as a cast-iron stove were installed. [...] In May 1982, the house was opened as a museum.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{protecting}} of concrete, {{which consists}} of coating a chemical substance onto concrete’s surface, {{has been applied to}} architectural conservation. There is increasing interest in studying materials for concrete which can reduce the infiltration of water and salt solutions and rehabilitate and extend its service life. Silicon compounds are frequently used as a base for commercial protecting paint due to their hydrophobicity and penetrability.

Adhesion, chloride content and resistance of chloride ion diffusivity of two types of polyaspartic ester polyurea <b>coated</b> <b>concrete</b> were analyzed.

The degradation process of <b>coated</b> <b>concrete</b> simultaneously exposed to co-action exposure was significantly accelerated. In co-action exposure tests, the average chloride ion content of <b>coated</b> <b>concrete</b> increased about 33 % and 87 % after 25 and 50 times of cycles compared with single NaCl solution immersion exposure; the chloride ion diffusion coefficient of concrete substrate increased with the increase of exposure time and freeze-thaw cycles. Freeze-thaw cycles results showed a severe influence on chloride ion diffusion and permeation of surface protection <b>coating</b> of <b>concrete.</b> Research also showed that the chloride ion diffusion of <b>coated</b> <b>concrete</b> subjected to the co-action of freeze-thaw cycles-NaCl solution was coincided with the Fick’s second law...|$|R

40|$|When {{evaluating}} the carbonation resistance of paint <b>coated</b> <b>concrete,</b> {{the effects of}} both the strength grade and the curing conditions (standard curing and accelerated curing) of concrete substrate on carbonation resistance of paint <b>coated</b> <b>concrete</b> were investigated. The concept of the carbonation suppression ratio of paint was presented for evaluation of the anti-carbonation performance of {{the two types of}} paints (exterior and interior paints) when applied to a reference concrete substrate. The test results showed a good linear relationship between the carbonation depths of the paint <b>coated</b> <b>concrete</b> and the square root of exposure times. Concrete with higher strength grade exhibited greater carbonation resistance. The carbonation depth of the C 35 standard cured concrete was reduced by 56 % in comparison with that of the C 25 standard cured concrete. It was found that concrete substrate prepared by accelerated curing method displayed lower carbonation resistance than standard cured concrete. Compared with the standard cured specimen, the carbonation depth of the accelerated cured specimen increased by 61 % for the control C 25 concrete and by 56 % for the control C 35 concrete. This phenomenon was attributed to the formation of a higher volume of capillary pores in concrete prepared by accelerated curing. Additionally, the exterior paint had a higher carbonation suppression ratio than the interior paint. The suppression ratios of the exterior and interior paint coatings applied on C 25 standard cured concrete were 71 % and 56 %, respectively.

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{evaluate}} new and traditional surface materials for use in cattle barns. The evaluated concrete materials had different compositions and included different additives and coatings. Contact angle meter, optical profilometry and scanning electron microscopy SEM were used for characterization of surface properties. Radiochemical methods and a biochemical adenosine triphosphate ATP method were used to determine cleanability. A specific methodological aim was to examine the correlations between these determination methods. A statistically significant difference was observed between contact angles of non-coated <b>concretes,</b> <b>coated</b> <b>concretes</b> and joint materials. In general, coatings smoothened surfaces and the joint materials were the roughest surfaces, as illustrated by profilometry and SEM. On the basis of the radiochemical determination methods, coatings improved the cleanability of concrete. An epoxy joint material was cleaned efficiently from the oil model soil and from the labelled feed soil when compared to the two cement-based joint materials. According to the results of the biochemical ATP method the manure test soil was cleaned better from a concrete including inorganic sealant than from the other materials examined. The cleanability results of oil model soil used in the radiochemical method correlated with the results of the test feed soil used in the biochemical ATP method. Both determination methods of cleanability appeared to be suitable for examining the cleanability of surfaces soiled with agricultural soils. Only the radiochemical determination gives detailed quantitative results, but it can be used only in laboratory studies. The results of this laboratory study will be used for selecting materials for a pilot study in a cattle barn. ...|$|R
