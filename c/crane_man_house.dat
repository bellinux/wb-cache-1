50|$|The lands around Old <b>Man</b> <b>House</b> were {{retained}} by the Suquamish tribe after the Point Elliott Treaty {{was signed in}} 1855, becoming the Port Madison Indian Reservation. However, the longhouse was burned by the U.S. government in 1870, after Seattle's death. The destruction of the longhouse was intended to encourage the Suquamish to spread out across their reservation and take up farming. After it was burned, the Suquamish rebuilt their village at the site and continued to live there. In 1886 the federal government divided the reservation into allotments which were assigned to individual Suquamish families. In 1904 the U.S. War Department acquired land along Agate Pass, including the site of Old <b>Man</b> <b>House,</b> to build fortifications to protect the new naval shipyards at Bremerton. The village site had to be moved, and the tribe {{lost much of its}} water access. The fortifications were never built, and the land purchased by the military was eventually sold in 1937 to a private developer and subdivided for vacation homes. In 1950, the Washington Parks and Recreation Department purchased an acre of waterfront where Old <b>Man</b> <b>House</b> had been located and set it aside as a state park. The park was returned to the Suquamish Tribe on August 12, 2004.|$|R
