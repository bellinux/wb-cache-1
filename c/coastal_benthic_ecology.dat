The subtidal <b>benthic</b> <b>ecology</b> to the immediate north-west of the marina was also examined. Behavioural experiments were carried out in the laboratory to evaluate the abilities of the common cockle (Austrovenus stutchburyi) to rebury if left on the surf ace and to resurface if buried under sediment. The intertidal <b>benthic</b> <b>ecology</b> of the area was diverse, with 89 taxa being identified. The 10 most common taxa accounted for 66 % of the 39125 individuals recorded. The assemblage composition was similar to other low energy intertidal areas. The taxal assemblages were reasonably stable in time, with seasonal fluctuations in assemblage composition being related to recruitment phases. Spatially, there was variation between the transects, however the transects close to the approach channel to the marina were similar. Mid and low tide sites had similar mollusc assemblages, which changed similarly through time. High tide sites however were distinct. The dumpground faunal assemblage changed post-dumping. Not all taxa were affected and within 6 months the dumpground was recolonised to pre-dumping levels. The subtidal area to the west of Motukaraka Island was dominated numerically by the introduced bivalve Theora lubrica. Species diversity changed in an onshore/offshore direction, with a higher species diversity closer to shore.

40|$|<b>Coastal</b> <b>benthic</b> marine ecosystems, such as coral reefs, {{seagrass}} beds, and kelp {{forests are}} highly productive {{as well as}} ecologically and commercially important resources. These systems are vulnerable to degraded water quality due to coastal development, terrestrial run-off, and harmful algal blooms. Measurements of these features are important for understanding linkages with land-based sources of pollution and impacts to coastal ecosystems. Challenges for accurate remote sensing of <b>coastal</b> <b>benthic</b> (shallow water) ecosystems and water quality are complicated by atmospheric scattering/absorption (approximately 80 +% of the signal), sun glint from the sea surface, and water column scattering (e. g., turbidity). Further, sensor challenges related to signal to noise (SNR) over optically dark targets as well as insufficient radiometric calibration thwart the value of coastal remotely-sensed data. Atmospheric correction of satellite and airborne remotely-sensed radiance data is crucial for deriving accurate water-leaving radiance in coastal waters. C-HORSE seeks to optimize coastal remote sensing measurements by using a novel airborne instrument suite that will bridge calibration, validation, and research capabilities of bio-optical measurements from the sea to the high altitude remote sensing platform. The primary goal of C-HORSE is to facilitate enhanced optical observations of coastal ecosystems using {{state of the art}} portable microradiometers with 19 targeted spectral channels and flight planning to optimize measurements further supporting current and future remote sensing missions...|$|R
40|$|Stable {{isotopes}} {{of carbon}} and nitrogen {{were used to}} determine the different carbon pathways and trophic assemblages amongst <b>coastal</b> <b>benthic</b> fauna of the Windmill Islands, East Antarctica. Macroalgae, pelagic POM, sediment POM and sea ice POM had well-separated δ 13 C signatures, which ranged from − 36. 75 ‰ for the red alga Phyllophora antarctica, to − 10. 35 ‰ for sea ice POM. Consumers were also well separated by δ 13 C, ranging from − 21. 42 ‰ for the holothurian Staurocucumis sp. up to − 7. 47 ‰ for the urchin Sterechinus neumayeri. Analysis of δ 13 C and δ 15 N revealed distinct groups for suspension feeders, grazer/herbivores and deposit feeders, whilst predators and predator/scavengers showed less grouping. Consumers spanned a δ 15 N range of 8. 71 ‰, equivalent to four trophic levels, although δ 15 N ratios amongst consumers were continuous, rather than grouped into discrete trophic levels. The study has built a trophic model for the Windmill Islands and summarises three main carbon pathways utilised by the benthos: (1) pelagic POM; (2) macroalgae/epiphytic/benthic diatoms and (3) sediment POM/benthic diatoms. The movement of carbon within the <b>coastal</b> <b>benthic</b> community of the Windmill Islands is considered complex, and stable isotopes of carbon and nitrogen were valuable tools in determining specific feeding guilds and in tracing carbon flow, particularly amongst lower-order consumers...|$|R
40|$|Early {{ecological}} {{research in}} McMurdo Sound revealed local spatial gradients in community structure associated with variations in anchor ice disturbance, fast {{ice and snow}} cover, {{and the effects of}} predators. Research contrasting the east and west sides of McMurdo Sound has shown major differences in benthic communities, which have been attributed to oceanographic influences on the advection of water-column productivity and the frequency of fast ice break-out. Despite these regional and local differences, <b>coastal</b> <b>benthic</b> communities in McMurdo Sound show a high level of stability, and contain a variety of large and potentially very long-lived species. In Terra Nova Bay, about half way along the Victoria Land Coast of the western Ross Sea, the <b>coastal</b> <b>benthic</b> communities provide some insightful contrasts with those in McMurdo Sound. For example, the abundance and depth distribution of dominant species such as Sterechinus neumayeri and Adamussium colbecki are markedly different from McMurdo Sound. In both locations communities dominated by large sponges are most prolific in regions that are free from iceberg disturbance of the seabed. A recent assessment of northern Victoria Land <b>coastal</b> <b>benthic</b> communities, in conjunction with multibeam imagery of the seafloor, further highlights the importance of iceberg disturbance in structuring Antarctic benthic communities. A comparative synthesis of these coastal ecological studies enables us to generate hypotheses concerning the relative importance of different environmental drivers in structuring benthic communities. Overlain on the regular latitudinal shifts in physical factors such as light regime, are regional fluctuations that are controlled by atmospheric and oceanographic circulation patterns and coastal topography/bathymetry. Change in diversity along the western coast of the Ross Sea is predicted to be influenced by three main factors (1) ice disturbance (e. g., via anchor ice and advection of supercooled water or icebergs), (2) photosynthetically available radiation (affected by ice and snow cover and water clarity), (3) the locations of polynyas and advection of planktonic production and larvae. Interactions between these factors are expected to result in non-linear changes along the latitudinal gradient. While predictions generated from these hypotheses remain to be rigorously tested,they provide indications of how benthic communities may respond to changes in production, disturbance and the stability of coastal sea ice...|$|R

40|$|To {{provide new}} {{insights}} into the early diagenesis of extracellular deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and its relevance in trophodynamic processes, we collected sediment samples from a variety of coastal and deep-sea sites. Turnover times of extracellular DNA were approximately threefold shorter in <b>coastal</b> <b>benthic</b> systems than in deep-sea sediments (0. 35 yr and 1. 2 yr, respectively). This was due to the higher concentrations of bioavailable extracellular DNA in deep-sea over coastal sediments (19. 8 6 0. 6 and 9. 8 6 2. 6 mg DNA g 21, respectively), since deoxyribonuclease (DNase) activities did not show significant differences between sampling sites (135. 8 6 72. 7 and 62. 8 6 19. 0 ng DNA g 21 d 21, in coastal and deep-sea sediments, respectively). The <b>coastal</b> <b>benthic</b> systems were characterized by DNase activities per prokaryotic cell significantly lower than those of their deep-sea counterparts (0. 12 6 0. 05 and 0. 27 6 0. 06 fg DNA degraded cell 21 d 21, respectively), although carbon production per cell was not significantly different (6. 9 6 4. 4 and 2. 6 6 0. 9 fg C cell 21 d 21, respectively). These results suggest that DNase activity per cell may be more dependent on the amount of bioavailable substrate rather than on prokaryotic metabolism.
