50|$|According to Hein, verification, validation, testing, and {{operational}} history increases the confidence in a system's reliability and quality. However, accumulating this history is often expensive. NASA's now retired Space Shuttle program used {{a large amount}} of 1970s-era technology. Replacement was cost-prohibitive because of the expensive requirement for flight certification. The original hardware completed the expensive integration and <b>certification</b> <b>requirement</b> for flight, but any new equipment would have had to go through that entire process again. This long and detailed process required extensive tests of the new components in their new configurations before a single unit could be used in the Space Shuttle program. Thus any new system that started the certification process becomes a de facto legacy system by the time it is approved for flight.|$|E

Speed measurements are only reliable when the distance at which a specific measurement has been recorded is known.

50|$|The Seawind 3000 first flew in late March 1993. The first {{prototype}} crashed during {{testing on}} 3 April 1993 with test pilot Bob Mills and SNA president Dick Silva on board. After several routine tests, {{they attempted to}} simulate an engine-out situation reducing the engine power and setting the prop pitch to high. However, due to a malfunction, the propeller went into reverse pitch. This caused excessive drag and prevented the propeller from windmilling. The crew attempted to reach the runway but, due to the high descent rate and reverse thrust, they landed in rough terrain short of the runway at approximately 80 mph, hitting several boulders on two sides of an embankment. The crash forces were estimated to be in excess of 20Gs. Although the aircraft suffered extensive damage, both crew suffered only muscle strains. The crash also showed {{the strength of the}} composite structure and, in particular, the vertical fin/engine pylon arrangement. Some skeptics had felt this was a potential weak point in the Seawind design, although the pylon is capable of 15G vertical and 20G forward loading, more than twice the <b>certification</b> <b>requirement.</b>|$|E
5000|$|As a {{surveillance}} plane, Sébastien Lefebvre conceives {{of the plane}} {{as an alternative to}} drone UAVs, the latter being costly to operate, especially near airports. The Ellipse aims to [...] "deliver 80% of the range of drone missions for 20% of the cost". The potential of the plane for surveillance and military missions led the investment fund Magellan Industries to become a shareholder in LH Aviation. The Ellipse was thus further developed in collaboration with Thales as a modular platform for civilian and military missions with different equipment systems, including day and night vision, rocket launching, and on-board communication systems.The LH-10 Ellipse is a low-wing, tandem two-seat light kit aircraft, powered by a 100 hp Rotax petrol engine in a pusher-propeller configuration. Its low weight and unusual configuration is designed to deliver a very high cruising speed with exceptional fuel economy. This high speed and a relatively high 50-knot stall speed will exclude it from the UK Microlight or United States LSA categories, so a full single-engine private pilot certificate will be the minimum <b>certification</b> <b>requirement</b> to fly it in these countries, which are not the immediate target of the manufacturer, anyway. At the 2008 Farnborough Airshow LH-Aviation said that for the future they would be looking into LSA/ELA compliant production, possibly for the United States.|$|E

The study investigates the prediction that the new regulations affect jurors' assessment of guilt for failing to discover fraud, and also whether the regulations affect jurors' perceptions of the appropriateness of auditors' actions regarding fraud detection and of auditors' and officers' responsibility for the fraudulent financial statements. The study tests whether these perceptions mediate the association between the regulations and mock jurors' guilt assessments. Results show that jurors assess auditors as less guilty under SAS No. 99 and {{in the presence of}} the officer <b>certification</b> <b>requirement.</b> SAS No. 99 decreases guilt assessments indirectly through jurors' perception that auditors acted more appropriately under the new standard. Although jurors did view auditors as more responsible under SAS No. 99, their responsibility perceptions had no effect on guilt assessments. An additional finding is that the officer <b>certification</b> <b>requirement</b> has an indirect effect on guilt assessments via jurors' perceptions of the officers' responsibility for the fraudulent financial statements. ...|$|E

We demonstrate first the intractability of determining whether a system specified in this model can be scheduled to meet all its <b>certification</b> <b>requirements,</b> even for systems subject to merely two sets of <b>certification</b> <b>requirements.</b> Then we quantify, via the metric of processor speedup factor, the effectiveness of two techniques, reservation-based scheduling and priority-based scheduling, that are widely used in scheduling such mixed-criticality systems, showing that the latter of the two is superior to the former.
