These unchanged standards and <b>complete</b> <b>interchangeability</b> of parts results in many modern models functioning perfectly with Meccano components that are more than 100 years old and vice versa. Indeed, old and new parts can be intermixed with impunity, the only problem being the odd mixture of colour schemes.|$|E
50|$|In {{the late}} 1970s, {{following}} the initial {{successes of the}} Synthodont implant, Driskell et al. introduced the Titanodont implant. The Titanodont implant was composed of surgical grade titanium (grade 5, Ti-6Al-4V). The Titanodont implant was unique for three main reasons. First, the Titanodont implant allowed for <b>complete</b> <b>interchangeability</b> with abutments of varying diameters and angles. This interchangeability allowed for a more natural biological width. Second, the implant was grit blasted and acid etched, which provided both a larger surface area and more preferable substrate for cells involved in osseointegration. Third, and perhaps most importantly, the Titanodont implant had a locking taper abutment connection, which allowed 360° of abutment positioning, along with a bacterial seal. Unlike screw-form implants, the locking taper connection design prevents the infiltration of bacteria into the implant crypt and surrounding tissues.|$|E

The unit features a 72 KHz true chopper amplifier that affords complete isolation between input and output. This unit is fully developed and went into production in June 1966 offering many advanced features to airborne telemetry system users. Each input channel presents a true differential analog switch into the low level D. C. amplifier. The operating characteristics such as C. M. R. (100 db) out to 1 KHz, no D. C. drift or gain-change, and selectable pedestal levels add to ease of operation and flexibility. Heavy use of integrated circuits was also made including monolythics, hybrids and discrete elements. The gating logic, chopper amplifier front end, and carrier amplifier/synchronous demodulator each have a separate power supply winding thus providing excellent isolation for user applications. Mechanical construction employs plug in boards affording ease of manufacture and <b>complete</b> <b>interchangeability</b> of boards between units.

40|$|Cadillac is a {{division}} of U. S. -based General Motors (GM) that markets luxury vehicles worldwide. Cadillac is among the oldest automobile brands in the world, second in America only to fellow GM marque Buick. The firm was founded from {{the remnants of the}} Henry Ford Company in 1902, almost nine years before Chevrolet. By the time General Motors purchased the company in 1909 Cadillac had already established itself as one of America's premier luxury carmakers. The <b>complete</b> <b>interchangeability</b> of its precision parts had allowed it to lay the foundation for the modern mass production of automobiles. It was at the forefront of technological advances, introducing including full electrical systems, the clashless manual transmission and the steel roof. The brand developed three engines, with its V 8 setting the standard for the American automotive industry. In the 1950 s its body styling became extravagany, especially at the rear, with tail fins inspired by the Lockheed P- 38 fighter. After 1959 Cadillac simplified their designs and this 1960 de Ville Coupe, of which 21, 585 were made, is now much sought after by collectors.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{appreciate}} the current and inexorable future “racialization ” of DNA dragnets, {{it is useful to}} step back in time and provide some social and historical context of how emerging fields of inquiry most relevant to the new forensics were birthed with the complex issue of the relationship between human taxonomies and DNA markers. For {{the first decade of the}} Human Genome Project, from 1989 to 1999, the official position that dominated the whole enterprise was captured in the mantra of human “sameness ” (Cook-Degan 1994, Bishop and Waldholz 1990). We heard repeatedly that, since all humans are so alike at the DNA level, it did not matter whose genome was sequenced. This conventional scientific wisdom obviated the need for any serious or meaningful discussion of how human variation might play a role in determining which human (or humans) was (were) to be used as the source of mapping and sequencing. If the DNA sequences of Laplanders, Scots, Sudanese, Aborigines, Canadians, Japanese and Brazilians ’ are so much alike, then we might as well just sequence some white males from the United States and be done with it. This position of the <b>complete</b> <b>interchangeability</b> of humans for the purpose of sequencing the genome was officially re-affirmed at the White House press conference of June, 2000 – in which the key players came together to announc...|$|E
40|$|Langerhans cells (LCs) in {{mammalian}} epidermis {{possess the}} ectoenzyme Ca++/Mg++-dependent adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase), which {{has served as}} a useful histochemical marker for these dendritic cells in a variety of tissue preparations. Since ATPase represents only one of several potential cell surface polyphosphatases, we investigated the capacities of 3 related adenine nucleotide substrates to identify rodent epidermal LCs. Cell surface ATPase activity was not inhibited in the presence of ouabain and was observed to be strictly divalent cation-dependent, with <b>complete</b> <b>interchangeability</b> between Ca++ and Mg++. Optimal staining in the presence of either cation occurred at a 20 mM concentration. Substrate concentration dependence was also observed, with optimal staining at 0. 33 mM adenosine 5 ′-triphosphate (ATP). On an equimolar basis, however, adenosine 5 '-diphosphate (ADP) was superior to ATP for the identification of LCs both in whole mounts of epidermis and in suspensions of disaggregated epidermal cells. The substrate adenosine 5 '-monophosphate (AMP) stained follicular epithelial cells in both rodent species but failed to identify epidermal LCs in the mouse and only weakly stained these dendritic cells in rat epidermis. We conclude from these studies that ADP demonstrates greater specificity for LC surface polyphosphatase activity than ATP and that the inadvertent inclusion of AMP during identification procedures for epidermal cell suspensions will falsely identify cells other than LCs...|$|E
30|$|Note {{that for}} all higher market levels, this {{information}} is sufficient for the operators, as in these stages, the mapping of abstract resources to physical resources is not necessary. Nevertheless, the broker will maintain a history of transactions for clearing purposes. However, on the lowest market level, the level with finest granularity, a common resource scheduler needs to know the final allocation of transmission resources for the upcoming time frame {{in order to accomplish}} the allocation of specific physical resources. Being a software agent, the scheduler is collocated with the broker, since it has to serve the same operators for the same cell as the broker. This collocation also mitigates explicit signaling between the broker and scheduler. The scheduler signalizes the channel numbers added or lost to each operator after a successful transaction. That scheduler can be designed to accomplish different goals. One possibility is to implement an algorithm that tries to reallocate those frequencies first, which were last allocated, so that a minimum of reconfiguration becomes necessary. Another possibility is to randomize reallocations. This would mitigate the effect of benefitting any operator with respect to channel quality, for example, concerning actual fading and interference situation. Nevertheless, note that a basic assumption of our approach is the <b>complete</b> <b>interchangeability</b> of resource goods in order to allow efficient trading by a double auction scheme. Consequently, it is not possible for an operator to bid for a specific frequency channel, even on the lowest market level, for example, to have a contiguous frequency block after the auction. Compared to the current fixed allocation practice, this is not a disadvantage for operators, as by not participating in any trades, the allocation status quo for that operator would not change.|$|E
40|$|Biomethane or {{synthetic}} {{natural gas}} (Bio-SNG) produced from gasified renewable woody biomass is a promising option for replacing fossil natural gas. The <b>complete</b> <b>interchangeability</b> with natural gas in all its conventional applications {{such as in the}} power generation, transportation and chemical industry sector is of particular interest. This work presents results from a comprehensive process integration study of different process alternatives for Bio-SNG production from gasified biomass. The influence of the main conversion steps in the process chain – drying, gasification, gas cleaning, methanation, and gas upgrade – on the overall process performance is investigated. Process bottlenecks and both heat and material integration opportunities are highlighted. Using future energy market scenarios the energetic, economic, and carbon footprint performance of the investigated processes are evaluated from a system perspective clearly showing the sensitivity of the obtained results to underlying assumptions. It is shown that drying of the biomass feedstock prior to gasification using excess process heat – using steam drying or low-temperature air drying technology – is an important aspect for improving the process energy efficiency. The results also indicate that indirect and direct gasification technologies perform equally well within the overall Bio-SNG production process. Existing infrastructure in the form of biomass-fired combined heat and power plants based on fluidised bed combustion technology presents interesting opportunities for integrating indirect gasification for Bio-SNG production, with beneficial effects on the cogeneration of electricity from the Bio-SNG process excess heat. The choice of methanation technology between fixed and fluidised bed is not a critical one with respect to process integration, since both technologies allow for efficient heat recovery and consequent cogeneration. For gas upgrade, in particular removal of CO 2 from the product gas, amine based separation is shown to achieve better energy efficiency and economic performance than membrane based or pressure swing adsorption processes. Preliminary estimations of Bio-SNG costs are significantly higher than current natural gas prices, thus dedicated and long term policy measures are necessary in order to stimulate Bio-SNG production. The process integration aspects presented in this thesis can contribute to reducing production costs by increasing energy efficiency and in consequence increasing economic robustness of Bio-SNG process concepts. </html...|$|E
40|$|This article {{seeks to}} resolve {{the debate over the}} use of a {{statutory}} method for approving international agreements in place of the supermajority process required by the Constitution's Treaty Clause. These "congressional-executive agreements," which require only simple majorities in Congress and presidential signature, have become the instrument of choice for entry into some of the nation's most significant international obligations, such as the WTO and NAFTA. Some, such as Bruce Ackerman and David Golove argue that statutes and treaties are interchangeable because a "constitutional moment" occurred at the end of World War II (in which "We the People" non-textually amended the Constitution to allow this alternate process). Their critics, such as Laurence Tribe, suggest that the text and structure of the Constitution forbids the use of a statutory method to enter into significant international agreements. Standard foreign relations law doctrine, by contrast, consistently has defended interchangeability, but with little success at explaining how interchangeability is consistent with the constitutional text and structure. This Article provides a constitutional justification for the congressional-executive agreement, one consistent with the text, structure, and history of the Constitution. It shows a clear dividing line that demarcates the situations in which treaties must be the sole instrument of national policy, and those that can be dealt with by the congressional-executive agreement. This Article articulates a theory of treaties that explains the record of practice by the political branches, rather than making normative claims derived simply from different theories of constitutional interpretation. Practice suggests that <b>complete</b> <b>interchangeability</b> ought to be rejected because it creates severe distortions in the American public lawmaking system. Allowing statutes to completely replace treaties eliminates the restrictions upon Congress's enumerated powers and undermines the separation of powers in foreign affairs. Nonetheless, congressional-executive agreements still have a legitimate place in the constitutional conduct of foreign policy, because their use preserves Congress's constitutional powers over matters such as international commerce. Treaties still retain a vital role by allowing the nation to enter into agreements that regulate matters outside of Congress's enumerated powers. Congressional-executive agreements allow the political branches to maintain a separation between treatymaking and lawmaking {{at a time when the}} distinction between international and domestic is rapidly disappearing...|$|E
