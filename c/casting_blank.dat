500|$|House members voted by state, with a {{majority}} required for a state's vote to be awarded, and {{a majority}} of nine states required to win. [...] During the first 35 ballots, Jefferson carried eight states and Burr six, with two states counted as [...] "no result" [...] because of a tie among their House members. [...] Vermont was one of the two [...] "no result" [...] states, because Lewis Morris voted for Burr and Lyon cast his ballot for Jefferson. [...] On the 36th ballot, several Federalists decided to break the impasse by allowing the election of Jefferson through either <b>casting</b> <b>blank</b> ballots or absenting themselves from the House chamber during the vote. [...] Morris was among the Federalists who took part; as a result of Morris's decision to be absent, Lyon's vote for Jefferson moved Vermont into his column. [...] Vermont was one of two states to switch from [...] "no result" [...] to Jefferson, and he carried 10 states on the final ballot; Lyon thus {{played an important role in}} Jefferson's victory.|$|E

50|$|Maryland did {{not choose}} its electors as a slate; rather, it divided itself into electoral {{district}}s, with each district choosing one elector. Three of Marylands eleven districts were won by Federalist electors. However, these electors did not vote for King or for a Federalist vice president, instead <b>casting</b> <b>blank</b> votes as a protest, thus resulting in Monroe winning the votes of all the Maryland state electors.|$|E

50|$|There were 443 {{candidates}} for the 77 seats - an average of 5.5 per seat. There were 48.7 million voters registered for the election and turnout was 42.51%. This included 4.5% of voters who went to vote and <b>cast</b> <b>blank</b> or invalid votes.|$|R
5000|$|During the {{referendum}} campaign, the PSOE was virtually left {{alone at the}} national level campaigning for NATO membership support, as the PCE (which later in the year would go on to form the United Left coalition) opposed Spain's permanence within NATO, while the main opposition AP, considered as a pro-NATO party, asked for an abstention in {{the referendum}}. In words of David Ruiz, this would be a [...] "painful strategy... to discredit the political career of its founder, Manuel Fraga, as an aspirant to the Government of the State". Finally, the NATO permanence option won the vote by a surprising 53.1% to 40.3% (with 6.6% <b>casting</b> <b>blank</b> ballots), and the PSOE came out reinforced.|$|E
50|$|Exiled in Venezuela and {{subjected}} to numerous assassination attempts ordered by the new regime in Argentina, Perón continued to exert considerable political influence in his homeland; as Argentine voters geared for the 1958 elections, the exiled leader's Justicialist Party was barred from fielding even local candidates (the mere mention of Perón's name was illegal). Following the secret meeting in Caracas, however, Perón endorsed Arturo Frondizi, instructing his supporters to vote for their former opponent and forego <b>casting</b> <b>blank</b> ballots, {{as a number of}} Peronists were advocating. Failing to secure the UCR nomination, Frondizi ran on a splinter ticket, whose party he named the Intransigent Radical Civic Union (UCRI). Enjoying Perón's support, Frondizi's UCRI handily defeated the mainstream UCR candidate, Ricardo Balbín, by about 1.5 million votes out of 9 million cast.|$|E
50|$|In the Election Committee Subsector {{elections}} in December 2011, pan-democracy camp {{was able to}} get more than 150 seats to secure the threshold of nominating a candidate in the 2012 Chief Executive election. Democratic Party chairman Albert Ho won over Frederick Fung Kin-kee of ADPL in the pan-democracy primary election and stood for the camp in the election. The election was dominated by the two candidates from the pro-Beijing camp, Henry Tang and Leung Chun-ying and marked by scandals, dirty tactics and smears from both sides. Albert Ho fell behind in the opinion poll throughout the campaign partly due to the impossibility of him being elected by the Beijing-controlled Election Committee. The pan-democracy camp called for <b>casting</b> <b>blank</b> votes on the election day. During the election 1,132 votes were cast, CY Leung received 689; Henry Tang received 285, and Albert Ho received 76.|$|E

On the other hand, the Union declared its members would again cast a blank vote in this ballot, but would vote for Napolitano in the fourth ballot, to be held on May 10, for which a plain majority of votes would be required for a successful election.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Study {{focusing}} on {{the dynamics of the}} crystallizer hydraulic non-sinusoidal vibration system in the bullet caster crystallizer, which is employed in an electric furnace factory, is introduced. With respect to construct a mathematical model of continuous casting crystallizer hydraulic vibration system, a power band graph method is applied. With the utilization of this method, a process of modeling and evaluating the performance of the hydraulic cylinder, electric-hydraulic servo and sensor system is conducted. The system is also analyzed and simulated by MATLAB/SIMULINK. In our experiment, the performance of the crystallizer non-sinusoidal vibration system with the change of main parameters is studied. Furthermore, an experiment is also conducted aims at investigating the quality requirements for the servo system, including stability, rapidity, and accuracy. Furthermore, an experiment is also conducted aims at investigating the quality requirements for the servo system, including stability, rapidity, and accuracy. The results demonstrate that crystallizer hydraulic servo non-sinusoidal vibration system can satisfy high frequency steel ball requirements and small amplitude design requirements.

40|$|The article {{deals with}} the {{determination}} of the basic indicators of heat transfer in the continuous casting of steel, which can be described as an unsteady process with complicated boundary conditions for the solution. An analytical solution of this problem is practically impossible and, therefore, mathematical modelling is applied with a certain simplification of the real conditions and with a description of those criteria that influence the most the process of solidification and cooling. Using a simulation program and the knowledge of input parameters, it was possible to predict the distribution of the thermal field of a continuously <b>cast</b> <b>blank</b> in the course of its casting. Simulations also allowed us to deal with the issues of the inner structure, surface quality, mechanical properties of a continuously <b>cast</b> <b>blank,</b> metallurgical length, change in the thickness of a strand shell and overheating of steel. Some results obtained with numerical simulations are documented for concrete examples. Web of Science 47681881...|$|R
