5|$|<b>Cultivated</b> plant {{taxonomy}} is {{one part of}} the study of horticultural botany which is mostly carried out in botanical gardens, large nurseries, universities, or government departments. Areas of special interest for the <b>cultivated</b> plant taxonomist include: searching for and recording new plants suitable for cultivation (plant hunting); communicating with and advising the general public on matters concerning the classification and nomenclature of <b>cultivated</b> plants and carrying out original research on these topics; describing the <b>cultivated</b> plants of particular regions (horticultural floras); maintaining databases, herbaria and other information about <b>cultivated</b> plants.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{structure}} of the Botanical Code the <b>Cultivated</b> Plant Code is set out {{in the form of an}} initial set of Principles followed by Rules and Recommendations that are subdivided into Articles. Amendments to the <b>Cultivated</b> Plant Code are prompted by international symposia for <b>cultivated</b> plant taxonomy which allow for rulings made by the International Commission on the Nomenclature of <b>Cultivated</b> Plants. Each new <b>Cultivated</b> Plant Code includes a summary of the changes made to the previous version and these have also been summarised for the period 1953 to 1995.|$|E

In order to process its own meat, the company operated a slaughterhouse. By using this system the store was able to sell fresh meat at affordable prices.|$|E

These names, sometimes called variety names, are not in Latin but are added onto the scientific Latin names, and they assist communication among the community of foresters, farmers and horticulturists.|$|E
