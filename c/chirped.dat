25|$|If D is {{less than}} zero, the medium {{is said to have}} {{positive}} dispersion or normal dispersion. If D is greater than zero, the medium has negative dispersion. If a light pulse is propagated through a normally dispersive medium, the result is the higher frequency components slow down more than the lower frequency components. The pulse therefore becomes positively <b>chirped,</b> or up-chirped, increasing in frequency with time. This causes the spectrum coming out of a prism to appear with red light the least refracted and blue/violet light the most refracted. Conversely, if a pulse travels through an anomalously (negatively) dispersive medium, high frequency components travel faster than the lower ones, and the pulse becomes negatively <b>chirped,</b> or down-chirped, decreasing in frequency with time.|$|E

40|$|Weakly {{electric}} fish {{produce and}} detect electric fields {{and use their}} electrosensory modality {{in a number of}} behaviours including navigation and communication. They can modulate their electric discharge in frequency and amplitude to produce electrocommunication signals in variable patterns during social interactions. In one model neuroethological species, Apteronotus leptorhynchus, the most commonly produced communication signal is the ‘small chirp’ – a brief 10 - 30 ms modulation. Individuals tend to produce these signals at high rates during agonistic interactions. In this thesis I will explore the social value of <b>chirps,</b> {{and to a lesser extent}} other communication behaviours, in A. leptorhynchus using a variety of experimental designs involving different staged social contexts. I use time series analysis methods to explore the patterns of <b>chirps</b> produced and accompanying aggressive behaviours. I first characterize electrocommunication and <b>chirping</b> in pairs of free swimming fish and correlate signal production with aggressive displays. Bursts of echoed, or reciprocated, <b>chirps</b> tend to be produced in the intervals separating aggressive attacks. Behavioural analysis shows that fish respond to conspecific <b>chirps</b> with echoed <b>chirps</b> and decreased aggression in social contexts outside the range in which previous modelling and electrophysiological data predicted that <b>chirps</b> could be encoded effectively. I then characterize the <b>chirping</b> and aggressive responses to playbacks simulating intruders with different <b>chirping</b> styles to test whether alternative <b>chirp</b> patterns differentially influence conspecific behaviour. In response to simulated intruders producing <b>chirps</b> that echo the real fish’s <b>chirps</b> with a short latency, less aggressive fish tend to produce more of their <b>chirps</b> in bursts than more aggressive fish. For randomly <b>chirping</b> intruders, the response of fish depends on the rate of <b>chirps</b> delivered. Fish respond less aggressively, with fewer <b>chirps,</b> and echo the stimulus <b>chirps</b> at a higher rate when high rates of random <b>chirps</b> are delivered than when responding to simulated intruders with low rates of randomly delivered <b>chirps.</b> Further, across all playback scenarios, fish that produce <b>chirps</b> in response to the playbacks are more aggressive than those that do not <b>chirp.</b> Finally, to better understand the electrosensory inputs during these interactions, I characterize changes in the electric image received by a restrained fish during movements of a free-swimming conspecific and correlate these with <b>chirp</b> production. When one fish is restrained, bursts of <b>chirps</b> tend to be associated with approach behaviours. Communication signals often function to promote individual assessment of potential rivals during agonistic encounters and bursty, antiphonal <b>chirp</b> exchanges may facilitate these assessments and deter potentially costly physical escalations...|$|R
40|$|<b>Chirp</b> spread {{spectrum}} (CSS) is a suitable choice of modulation signals for wireless communications, {{due to its}} inherited advantages such as low transmission power, simplicity of implementation, good interference rejection capability. Linear <b>chirps</b> are common choices in practical CSS systems of binary orthogonal keying (BOK) mode. However, linear <b>chirps</b> generally require the time-bandwidth product of each <b>chirp</b> signal to be 60 sHz or more {{in order to achieve}} desirable orthogonality requirements. Thus, a BOK CSS system based on linear <b>chirps</b> has to occupy very wide bandwidth, which is a very precious resource for wireless communication. Clearly, the requirement on broad frequency bandwidth is a major limiting factor for the widespread adoption of the BOK linear CSS system in practice. To overcome this drawback, it is worthwhile to explore other types of <b>chirp</b> signals outside the linear domain, which can potentially reduce the bandwidth requirement without jeopardizing the system performance. This is the main objective of the current research. In this dissertation, a pair of non-linear <b>chirps</b> has been discovered, which has the potential to replace linear <b>chirps</b> for BOK CSS systems. After exploring desirable properties of non-linear <b>chirps,</b> it is demonstrated that a significant performance advantage on orthogonality over linear <b>chirps</b> can be achieved by a pair of sine or cosine <b>chirps.</b> Subsequently, properties of sine and cosine <b>chirps</b> are analyzed mathematically. Derivations of spectral characteristics, autocorrelation and cross-correlation for both sine and cosine <b>chirps</b> are carried out respectively. Finally, comparison of sine <b>chirps</b> of four different time periods (i. e. half time period, full time period, triple time period, and quadruple time period) are made in terms of their cross-correlation and autocorrelation properties. It has been concluded that full period sine (FPS) <b>chirps</b> are the better choice for this particular application among the sine <b>chirps.</b> Performance of a BOK CSS system based on FPS <b>chirps</b> has been evaluated in three typical scenarios. Firstly, BER (bit error rate) performance of the BOK FPS CSS system in an additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel is derivated. Furthermore, performance comparison in terms of BERs between linear <b>chirps</b> and FPS <b>chirps</b> is examined. Secondly, effects of Doppler shift on the BOK FPS CSS system are analyzed. The effect of Doppler shift between linear <b>chirps</b> and FPS <b>chirps</b> has been compared. Thirdly, BER performance of the BOK FPS CSS system in a fading environment (Rayleigh channel) has been analyzed. Moreover, BER performance comparisons between linear <b>chirps</b> and FPS <b>chirps</b> in the AWGN+Rayleigh channel with and without a Doppler shift have also been studied. Using analytic means and numerical simulations, this dissertation has conclusively demonstrated that a pair of orthogonal FPS <b>chirps</b> has the capability of replacing linear <b>chirp</b> in BOK CSS systems...|$|R

25|$|As more {{information}} about the signal became available, its purpose as a radar signal became increasingly obvious. In particular, its signal contained a clearly recognizable structure in each pulse, which was eventually identified as a 31-bit pseudo-random binary sequence, with a bit-width of 100 μs resulting in a 3.1 ms pulse. This sequence is usable for a 100μs <b>chirped</b> pulse amplification system, giving a resolution of 15km (10mi) (the distance light travels in 50μs). When a second Woodpecker appeared, this one located in eastern Russia but also pointed toward the US and covering blank spots in the first system's pattern, this conclusion became inescapable.|$|E
40|$|Discussions {{about the}} {{evolution}} of female mating preferences have often suggested that females should express multiple strong preferences when different male traits are correlated with different mating benefits, yet few studies have directly tested this hypothesis by comparing the strength of female preferences for male traits known to be correlated with different benefits. In the variable field cricket, Gryllus lineaticeps, females receive fecundity and fertility benefits from mating with males with higher <b>chirp</b> rates and life-span benefits from mating with males with longer <b>chirp</b> durations. Although females prefer higher <b>chirp</b> rates and longer <b>chirp</b> durations when the other trait is held constant, {{it is possible that}} they give priority to one of these song traits when both vary. In this study, we examined the relative importance of <b>chirp</b> rate and <b>chirp</b> duration in female mate choice using single-stimulus presentations of songs that varied in both <b>chirp</b> rate and <b>chirp</b> duration. Females expressed both directional and stabilizing preferences based on <b>chirp</b> rate, responding most strongly to a <b>chirp</b> rate approximately one standard deviation above the population mean. Females did not express preferences based on <b>chirp</b> duration, and did not express correlational preferences. These results suggest that females may give priority to the reproductive benefits provided by males that produce higher <b>chirp</b> rates...|$|R
40|$|Synchronising bushcricket males achieve {{synchrony}} by delaying their <b>chirps</b> {{in response}} to calling neighbours. In multi-male choruses, males that delay <b>chirps</b> {{in response to}} all their neighbours would remain silent {{most of the time}} and be unable to attract mates. This problem could be overcome if the afferent auditory system exhibited selective attention, and thus a male interacted only with a subset of neighbours. We investigated whether individuals of the bushcricket genus Mecopoda restricted their attention to louder <b>chirps</b> neurophysiologically, behaviourally and through spacing. We found that louder leading <b>chirps</b> were preferentially represented in the omega neuron but the representation of softer following <b>chirps</b> was not completely abolished. Following <b>chirps</b> that were 20 dB louder than leading <b>chirps</b> were better represented than leading <b>chirps.</b> During acoustic interactions, males synchronised with leading <b>chirps</b> even when the following <b>chirps</b> were 20 dB louder. Males did not restrict their attention to louder <b>chirps</b> during interactions but were affected by all <b>chirps</b> above a particular threshold.

The heating pulse needs to be very short, about 10 to 20ps long, but this is too short a time for the amplifiers to work well. To solve this problem HiPER uses a technique known as <b>chirped</b> pulse amplification (CPA). CPA starts with a short pulse from a wide-bandwidth (multi-frequency) laser source, as opposed to the driver which uses a monochromatic (single-frequency) source. Light from this initial pulse is split into different colours using a pair of diffraction gratings and optical delays. This [...] "stretches" [...] the pulse into a chain several nanoseconds long. The pulse is then sent into the amplifiers as normal. When it exits the beamlines it is recombined in a similar set of gratings to produce a single very short pulse, but because the pulse now has very high power, the gratings have to be large (approx 1m) and sit in a vacuum. Additionally the individual beams must be lower in power overall; the compression side of the system uses 40 beamlines of about 5kJ each to generate a total of 200kJ, whereas the ignition side requires 24 beamlines of just under 3kJ to generate a total of 70kJ. The precise number and power of the beamlines are currently a subject of research. Frequency multiplication will also be used on the heaters, but it has not yet been decided whether to use doubling or tripling; the latter puts more power into the target, but is less efficient converting the light.
