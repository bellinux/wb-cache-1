40|$|AbstractImproving {{the quality}} <b>of</b> <b>steel</b> and the {{steelmaking}} {{process has been}} a matter of routine for metallurgical engineers and steelmaking companies in a demanding market for quality products at highly competitive price. The chemical and temperature adjustment are made during the secondary refining process, as well as the inclusion modification required to product quality, and also the demand for castability accuracy. Continuous casting process is the most used solidification casting process, in which the flow of pouring liquid metal through the submerged entry nozzle is assured by the correct temperature and the formation of liquid inclusion in the casting temperature. Thermocalc and CEQCSI were the software used in this work to assess the effect of carbon, silicon and sulphur in the <b>castability</b> window <b>of</b> the aluminium vs calcium phase diagrams. They have proved to be highly suitable and effective and the results showed that the chemical elements used directly affected the position <b>of</b> the <b>castability</b> window <b>of</b> carbon <b>steel.</b> An analysis <b>of</b> a 0. 2 %C billet sample using Scanning Electron Microscopy showed that there is a great heterogeneity of inclusions in aluminium-killed and calcium-treated steel...|$|R

40|$|Context: Castability {{has been}} found to be {{affected}} by many aspects of the entire casting system. Very few references in dental literature are available regarding recasting of the base metal alloys. Aims: To evaluate and compare the <b>castability</b> <b>of</b> fresh and reused nickel-chromium alloy and to evaluate the effect of two brands of investment materials on <b>castability</b> <b>of</b> nickel-chromium alloy. Subjects and Methods: For the experimental purpose of evaluation of the effect of recasting of nickel-chromium alloy on its <b>castability,</b> different percentages <b>of</b> new and casted alloy (Nickel-chromium alloy-(Wirolloy NB, Type 4 (Ni- 67 %; Cr- 25 %; Mo- 5 %; Si- 1. 5 %; Mn, Nb, B, C each < 1 %) and two commercial brands of investment materials namely, Deguvest Impact (Degudent; Dentsply Germany) and Bellavest SH (Degudent; Dentsply Germany) was used to obtain 30 samples. Castability value was obtained using Whitlock's formula. Student t-test and one way ANOVA using SPSS 20. 0 software was done. Results: The results of this study confirm earlier works that demonstrate that there is no significant difference in <b>castability</b> values <b>of</b> new and recast alloys. In addition, it also demonstrated, there was no difference in castability using Deguvest Impact and Bellavest SH investment materials. Conclusions: Within the limitations of the study, it was concluded that there was no significant difference found in <b>castability</b> <b>of</b> different percentage combinations of new and once casted alloy using two investment materials. The addition of new alloy during recasting to maintain the <b>castability</b> <b>of</b> nickel-chromium alloy may therefore not be required...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The rotor {{is a key}} {{determinant}} {{of the performance of}} a compressor and many {{attempts have been made to}} improve the efficiency of compressors by optimising rotor design. Rotors are usually made of several layers <b>of</b> <b>steel</b> sheets with thin cavities through the steel sheets, and aluminium alloys are used to fill the cavities by high pressure die casting process, and so bind the steel sheets together. Because of their high fluidity and good damping ability, magnesium alloys can be a good alternative for a high efficiency rotor. In this study, magnesium alloys were used for manufacturing rotors by high pressure die casting process using pin-point gate mold. By adopting a pin-point gate system, additional machining was eliminated and casting defects were reduced due to good <b>castability</b> <b>of</b> magnesium alloy...|$|R

A 10 X 10 mm square-shaped nylon net containing 100 open squares served as a template for construction of wax patterns, which were invested with phosphate-based investment (Termocast), silica-based investment (Refrafil) and mixed investing technique (2 -mm layer phosphate investment plus filling with silica investment). Forty-five cast specimens (5 per experimental condition) were obtained and sandblasted with aluminum oxide. The number of completely reproduced cast segments was counted to obtain a percentage designated "castability value", which indicated the accuracy of the alloy to reproduce mold details. Statistical analysis using two-way ANOVA and Tukey's test showed that, comparing the alloys, Remanium 2000 had statistically similar castability (p> 0. 05) to Vera PDI and lower than Durabond (p 0. 05). In conclusion, the <b>castability</b> <b>of</b> the Co-Cr-Mo-W alloy (Remanium 2000) was comparable to that of the Co-Cr alloy (Vera PDI) and worse than that of the Ni-Cr alloy (Durabond). Except for Remanium 2000, the mixed investing technique considerably improved the accuracy of the alloys to reproduce cast details, compared to the phosphate-based investment.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a thorough evaluation <b>of</b> the <b>castability</b> <b>of</b> {{the most common}} Mg die-casting alloys developed for elevated temperature applications. The alloys evaluated include AS 31, AJ 52, MRI 153 A, MRI 153 M, MRI 230 D, AXJ 530, AE 44, and AM-HP 2 plus. Among the various alloys evaluated, AE 44, MRI 153 A, and AS 31 are found to have better castability than the other alloys. AM-HP 2 plus also has acceptable castability, but it shows signs of hot tearing in some samples. The alloys containing significant levels of Ca, such as MRI 153 M, MRI 230 D, and AXJ 530, tend to oxidize rapidly, leading to poor melt handling.

40|$|Rapidly {{increasing}} {{fuel prices}} and global pressures {{to reduce the}} harmful effects of vehicle emissions are forcing vehicle manufacturers to look at alternative materials to reduce the mass of the vehicles they produce. This has led to an increase in the research and development of magnesium alloys for use in automotive applications, and the methods used to produce them. With a density two-thirds that of aluminium alloys, and one quarter that <b>of</b> <b>steel,</b> magnesium alloys are continually being investigated as possible replacements for the production of automotive castings such as wheels and engine blocks. However, there is presently a lack of understanding of the effects of common alloy additions that refine the as-cast microstructure on the <b>castability</b> <b>of</b> the casting alloys in question. The most popular magnesium alloys for large automotive castings are based on the magnesium-aluminium alloy system. For the work presented in this thesis, two of the most common Mg-Al alloys, AZ 91 E and AM 60 B, were chosen to determine the effect of grain refinement on the <b>castability</b> <b>of</b> Mg-Al alloys. An experimental mould has been designed and developed to emulate the geometry, filling, and solidification of an alloy wheel casting. Two different grain refiners were investigated at varying addition levels to determine the effect of different levels of grain refinement on the <b>castability</b> <b>of</b> the two alloys. Castability, defined as the ability to produce sound castings from a particular alloy, has been assessed through visual examination of external casting defects, X-ray radiography of internal defects, as well as grain size and porosity level analysis of all samples produced. It has been found that for both AZ 91 E and AM 60 B, an increase in the level of grain refinement achieved lead to an increase in the occurrence and severity of the surface slumping defect in the castings produced. Conversely, increased levels of grain refinement were found to reduce or totally eliminate the occurrence of the hot tearing defect in both alloys. Contrary to popular belief, grain refinement was found to increase the level of internal shrinkage porosity in the Mg-Al castings. This was especially the case in the poorly fed regions of the casting, such as the junction between the spoke and rim sections. This is due to the increased reliance on interdendritic feeding of liquid to compensate for shrinkage during the latter stages of solidification in such areas, where solidification does not proceed directionally towards the feeding reservoirs. An increase in the level of grain refinement means the interdendritic network becomes heavily constricted, resulting in a rapid increase in the feeding pressure required to feed metal to the areas where it is required. This study has also resulted {{in the development of a}} novel method of successfully and consistently introducing carbon to a Mg-Al alloy melt. This has in the past been identified as a major issue to overcome when adding carbon based grain refiners to Mg-Al alloy melts...|$|R
40|$|A {{study was}} {{conducted}} to assess the performance and <b>castability</b> <b>of</b> a new AA 6061 aluminum alloy variant specially designed for semi-solid pressure die casting. The AA 6061 alloy has very desirable mechanical properties for the fabrication of automotive parts. However, it has limited castability due to its low silicon content. It is not well suited for shape casting processes which are, for their part, very interesting in terms of production costs for complex-shaped automotive components. In an effort to meet automotive industry requirements, new AA 6061 alloy variants have been developed by Rio Tinto Alcan researchers over the past years, aiming to improve the <b>castability</b> <b>of</b> the alloy while maintaining its desirable mechanical properties, by increasing its die-filling capacity, decreasing its hot tearing tendency. The study described herein {{is an example of how}} the performance of a single variant was assessed in terms <b>of</b> <b>castability.</b> The full {{study was conducted}} on six separate variants. A part simulating a car suspension arm was die-cast for this study.

The study was based on a new design of experiment method that builds on past experience: E. M. Method*. Work performed in this study allowed unbiased comparisons of the filling capacity and hot-tearing tendency of several AA 6061 alloy variants.

40|$|Context: Since 1907 casting restorations {{have been}} in use in dentistry. Numerous {{companies}} have been manufacturing and marketing base metal alloys. Gold was {{a major component of}} casting alloys. But alloys with less than 65 % gold tarnished easily and the increase in cost of gold post- 1970 s lead to the revival of base metal alloys such as nickel-chromium and cobalt-chromium alloys which were in use since 1930 s. Aim: This study was conducted to evaluate and compare the castability between an indigenous alloy and an imported alloy, as imported base metal alloys are considered to be expensive for fabrication of crowns and bridges. Materials and Methods: This study was conducted to evaluate and compare the castability (for the accurate fabrication of crowns and bridges) between an indigenous base metal alloy-Non-ferrous Materials Technology Development Centre (NFTDC), Hyderabad (Alloy A) -and an imported base metal alloys (Alloy B). Castability measurement was obtained by counting the number of completely formed line segments surrounding the 81 squares in the pattern and later calculating the percentage values. The percentage obtained was taken as the castability value for a particular base metal alloy. The percentage <b>of</b> <b>castability</b> was determined by counting only the number of completely cast segments in a perfect casting (81 × 2 = 162), and then multiplying the resulting fraction by 100 to give the percentage completeness. Statistical Analysis Used: The Student t-test was used. Results: When the <b>castability</b> <b>of</b> alloys A and B was compared, the calculated value was less than the tabular value (1. 171 < 2. 048) leading to the conclusion that castability between alloys A and B is insignificant. Therefore we conclude that both the alloys have the same castability. Conclusions: Using the above-mentioned materials and following the method to test castability, we were able to derive favorable results. As the results were satisfactory, we can conclude that the <b>castability</b> <b>of</b> the indigenous alloy is on par with the imported alloy...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to develop the Automated Steel Cleanliness Analysis Tool (ASCATTM) to permit steelmakers to evaluate the quality <b>of</b> the <b>steel</b> through the analysis of individual inclusions. By characterizing individual inclusions, determinations can be made as to the cleanliness <b>of</b> the <b>steel.</b> Understanding the complicating effects of inclusions in the steelmaking process and on the resulting properties <b>of</b> <b>steel</b> allows the steel producer to increase throughput, better control the process, reduce remelts, and improve the quality of the product. The ASCAT (Figure 1) is a steel-smart inclusion analysis tool developed around a customized next-generation computer controlled scanning electron microscopy (NG-CCSEM) hardware platform that permits acquisition of inclusion size and composition data at a rate never before possible in SEM-based instruments. With built-in customized ''intelligent'' software, the inclusion data is automatically sorted into clusters representing different inclusion types to define the characteristics of a particular heat (Figure 2). The ASCAT represents an innovative new tool for the collection of statistically meaningful data on inclusions, and provides a means of understanding the complicated effects of inclusions in the steel making process and on the resulting properties <b>of</b> <b>steel.</b> Research conducted by RJLG with AISI (American Iron and Steel Institute) and SMA (<b>Steel</b> Manufactures <b>of</b> America) members indicates that the ASCAT has application in high-grade bar, sheet, plate, tin products, pipes, SBQ, tire cord, welding rod, and specialty steels and alloys where control of inclusions, whether natural or engineered, are crucial to their specification for a given end-use. Example applications include <b>castability</b> <b>of</b> calcium treated steel; interstitial free (IF) degasser grade slag conditioning practice; tundish clogging and erosion minimization; degasser circulation and optimization; quality assessment/steel cleanliness; slab, billet or bloom disposition; and alloy development. Additional benefits of ASCAT include the identification of inclusions that tend to clog nozzles or interact with refractory materials. Several papers outlining the benefits of the ASCAT have been presented and published in the literature. The paper entitled ''Inclusion Analysis to Predict Casting Behavior'' was awarded the American Iron and Steel Institute (AISI) Medal in 2004 for special merit and importance to the steel industry. The ASCAT represents a quantum leap in inclusion analysis and will allow steel producers to evaluate the quality <b>of</b> <b>steel</b> and implement appropriate process improvements. In terms of performance, the ASCAT (1) allows for accurate classification of inclusions by chemistry and morphological parameters, (2) can characterize hundreds of inclusions within minutes, (3) is easy to use (does not require experts), (4) is robust, and (5) has excellent image quality for conventional SEM investigations (e. g., the ASCAT can be utilized as a dual use instrument).

On the basis of the experimental results, different fatigue damaging micromechanisms were identified, both in the graphite nodules and in the ferritic – pearlitic matrix...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we attempt}} to {{estimate}} the impact <b>of</b> Chinese <b>steel</b> consumption upon the world price <b>of</b> <b>steel</b> mill products and inputs {{over the past several}} years. We focus upon the inputs <b>of</b> <b>steel</b> scrap and iron ore as inputs involving competing technologies. We find that an equilibrium relationship exists between China's consumption <b>of</b> <b>steel</b> and prices for steel and its inputs, but we cannot conclude from our analysis that variations in Chinese consumption drive variations in the prices <b>of</b> <b>steel</b> or its inputs...|$|R
