40|$|The {{impingement}} of edge dislocations on nano-scale interfaces {{formed when}} bringing in <b>contact</b> <b>aluminum</b> crystals is investigated using molecular dynamics simulations. Dislocations, {{inserted in the}} bottom crystal, glide towards the contact when the two crystals are pressed together. There, dislocations are absorbed and upon further loading new dislocations are nucleated from the impinging site. Absorption and nucleation are events that affect the length of dislocation pile-ups and therefore the plastic behavior of crystals under contact loading. While {{it is possible to}} track absorption and nucleation at the nano-scale with molecular dynamics simulations, larger scale models, which are suitable to study plasticity, do not have the right resolution and neglect these events. The goal of this work is {{to gain a better understanding}} of dislocation impingement and to assess to which extent absorption and renucleation would play a role at the larger scale. The contacts are here characterized by their initial atomic scale roughness for which a simple, novel definition is introduced. Results show for the first time that roughness controls dislocation nucleation from the contact. This is true for both dislocation-free crystals and for crystals containing one or more dislocations before application of contact loading. In dislocation-free crystals nucleation occurs at decreasing load for increasing roughness. When a dislocation impinges on the contact, it affects its local roughness, by that decreasing the load necessary for dislocation nucleation. Only when the initial roughness of the contact is above a given threshold, dislocation impingement does not affect the load required for nucleation. If instead of a single dislocation, a train of dislocations impinges on the same site, dislocation nucleation is even more facilitated. However, even in this case the contact pressure required to nucleate dislocations is in the order of one GPa, rather high compared with the pressure required to sustain plastic deformation when macro-scale bodies are in contact...|$|E
40|$|Matrix-addressable light {{emitting}} diode (LED) micro-arrays on sapphire substrates have been reported. In the fabrication process, complicated chemical-mechanical polishing after planarization with oxides, or conformal sputtering metallization process were needed to ensure smooth metal interconnections. The resistance of each individual device was reported to depend strongly on the n-type GaN stripe length and distance of the die from the contact {{at the end of}} the column, leading to significantly larger turn-on voltages with great variation. We have developed a simpler and more reliable fabrication process with much improved performance using a flip-chip configuration on a silicon wafer. The p-type <b>contact</b> <b>aluminum</b> bus lines were fabricated on the silicon carrier under the solder bumps, with very simple steps. The contact pads of the matrix were formed on the silicon wafer, with {{light emitting}} from the sapphire side. A high resolution 8 x 8 LED dot matrix display has been designed and fabricated. An individual device size was 300 x 300 μm 2. The turn-on voltages of the devices on the display were found to be strongly dependent on the n-type metal bus line design. Various n-type metal bus line designs were fabricated on the same LED wafer for investigation. Our optimum design showed an average turn-on voltage of the matrix fabricated on the same LED wafer not much higher from individual ones fabricated with conventional process. The variation was also small, from 3. 21 V to 3. 36 V. The matrix was flipped onto the silicon wafer afterward. We demonstrated that each LED on the matrix was addressed and lit up successfully. 2 mm x 2 mm large LED with two different designs were also fabricated from the same fabrication process as the dot matrix display. These large LED provided higher wall-plug efficiency than the standard 0. 3 mm x 0. 3 mm LED at the injection current density range (0 - 225 mA/mm 2) ...|$|E

Three different coating materials (lead, tin, and indium) were evaluated using four different thicknesses for each coating material.

The enhancement factors for thermal contact conductance were found to be on the order of 700, 400, and 50 percent, respectively. Based upon the experimental data, the hardness of the coating materials appears to be the most significant parameter in ranking the substrate and coating material combinations; however, additional experimental data are needed to substantiate this hypothesis.

40|$|In this study, an {{approach}} to create laser-fired <b>contacts</b> from <b>aluminum</b> foils is studied on p-type silicon-heterojunction solar cells. This alternative approach consists {{of the use of}} aluminum foils instead of evaporated layers as a metal source and rear electrode for the laser-firing process. A q-switched infrared laser (1064 nm) was employed to create the local point contacts. Quasi-steady-state photoconductance measurements evidenced a limited degradation in the surface passivation quality during the laser-firing process. Heterojunction solar cells fabricated with these rear contacts reached a best conversion efficiency of 18 % with a remarkable open-circuit voltage of 690 mV. These values were very close to those of reference devices fabricated with evaporated aluminum layers. This result suggests a similar effect on the rear surface passivation by both contact strategies. However, external quantum efficiency curves revealed a better response from devices with a rear aluminum foil in the near infrared. Optical measurements indicate that this effect can be related to a higher internal reflection at the back surface. Consequently, laser-fired <b>contacts</b> from <b>aluminum</b> foils appear to be a fast and convenient solution for the rear contact of high-efficiency silicon solar cells.

40|$|AbstractIn this work, <b>aluminum</b> as <b>contact</b> {{material}} with low transfer resistance to p- and n-silicon {{is combined with}} the zincate process which enables plating on aluminum. In this way the excellent <b>contact</b> quality of <b>aluminum</b> and the high conductivity of plated layers are combined. Examples of application are given on two solar cell concepts. One is the both side <b>aluminum</b> <b>contacted</b> concept suitable for p-type and n-type base material. The double sided metallization approach is called DACAPO (Double sided <b>Aluminum</b> <b>Contacted</b> And Plated Overcoating) process. On p-type wafers, satisfactory results are shown for the metallization in terms of contact geometry (contact width down to 50 μm). Challenges of the approach such as laser and inkjet alignment and resist stability in aluminum etching solution, are discussed. Calculations of VOC and RC in dependence of the contact area show {{the potential of the}} DACAPO process for high efficiency solar cells. The second solar cell concept tested with zincate and plating is the IBC (interdigitated back contact) concept. Different possibilities of plating processes on both polarities are discussed in this context. Thickening the aluminum/silicon layer by plating results in an increased FF by 1. 3 % and consequently in higher cell efficiency up to 20. 4 %, even on small sized solar cells.

Conversely, very little investigation exists of nanotube networks composed of {{a small number of}} MWCNTs. A detailed investigation of the long time stability, adhesion to the surface, and topological structure of the interconnections between MWCNTs is reported here. Three different microscopy techniques, focused ion beam (FIB), scanning electron microscope (SEM), and atomic force microscope (AFM), were used to investigate the interconnection of MWCNTs deposited by electrophoresis on a thermally oxidized silicon wafer with aluminum microgap structures. SEM, AFM, and FIB imaging revealed an interesting interconnection morphology between the drop casted MWCNTs.
