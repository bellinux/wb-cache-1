40|$|The {{surficial}} sediments of Chagvan Bay consist of: (1) coarse-grained (- 3 [Phi] to - 2 [Phi]) lithic {{fragments of}} dunites, diorites and sandstones; (2) fine sands (2 [...] 3 [Phi]) composed of quartz and feldspar; and (3) <b>coarse</b> <b>silts</b> (4 [...] 5 [Phi]) composed mostly of quartz. The lithic fragments primarily result from wave {{erosion of the}} coastal bluffs, while the fine sands are transported into the bay by tidal currents and the <b>coarse</b> <b>silts</b> by fluvial currents. During successive ebb tides tidal currents remove {{most or all of}} the newly deposited material and tend to maintain a balance between erosion and deposition. The texture and mineralogy of the bay deposits are primarily controlled by provenance. Inasmuch as most of the sedimentary particles are being supplied at present and the dispersal of the surficial sediments reflects the present configuration of distributor processes, the sediments are classified as "neoteric". Benthic epifauna are present only in relatively low-energy depositional areas, although other parts of the bay offer a similar environment. For this reason, it is postulated that the distribution of benthic organisms is influenced by the scouring activity of currents. Although there is seasonal ice-cover, the sediments rapidly acquire characteristics which reflect the energy regime during the ice-free period and form a hydraulically graded profile. It is concluded from this that the sediments are always at or near an equilibrium state, and that this situation should lead to a diastem or unconformity in the stratigraphic record...|$|R
50|$|Seasonal {{changes in}} weather can create cyclic sediments {{in the form}} of {{alternating}} bands of clay and silt (also known as varves). For example, in a glacial region where sediments are deposited in a lake, coarse sediments that are trapped in ice are released when the ice melts in the summer. This creates paler, <b>coarser</b> <b>silt</b> bands in the lake deposits. In winter, melting is at a minimum, meaning that only fine material is supplied to the lake, causing thin clay layers. Because the cycles are limited to the depositional basin, the lateral extent of the resultant strata are limited. The time period over which autocycles form are usually less than the time periods of allocyclic deposits.|$|R
50|$|These {{are used}} when {{laboratory}} testing {{is not enough}} to determine the required properties of the ground. Laboratory samples are at times not considered to be representative and of insufficient quality, stress, pore pressure, and degree of saturation. Discontinuities in the ground can also warrant filed tests. Sample sizes depend on ground nature and test type. Boreholes are commonly used. The SPT is a simple and inexpensive test which can furnish a piling contractor with useful information. The van test is used to determine the shear strength of a soil - material with <b>coarse</b> <b>silt</b> or sand can mean unreliable results. Permeability is found by determining whether the relevant aquifer is confined on unconfined with cognizance of the normal fluctuations in the aquifer. Installation of the borehole itself may influence stresses. For a reliable test this should be followed by a pumping test. Packer tests are also used to measure the impermeability of grouted ground and permeability of dam foundations, strength and deformation data can also be taken. There are many types, mechanical, hydraulic and pneumatic, the latter being the most popular. A clean borehole with a properly seated packer is essential (cement mortar is sometime used). Geophysical logs from the boreholes used can be taken at the same time enhancing the value of the results. Pressuremeter tests are used to stress, stiffness and strength of the ground to be investigated. It can be used in most ground types. There are three main types - pre-bored, self bored and pushed in. Boring should do minimal damage to the ground as much as possible. an unload reload method of around three times is used to give an accurate value of stiffness. Probing from the surface is done using a steel rod. Mainly used at a preliminary stage, it is also useful to check surrounding ground but is unsuitable in soils with boulders and cobbles. Static probing is mostly conducted with the use of electric sensors. It is quick and cheap. Pumping allows the determination of groundwater conditions using pumping and observation wells. Data interpretation can be complicated and is classed in steady and non-steady states. Density testing is conducted using the average of three results to obtain a significant result. The use of the sand replacement and core cutter test are common and the use of water replacement, rubber balloon, and nuclear methods are also used.In-situ testing data is important to design of works. Stress measurement in rocks and soils can be determined. Bearing tests are used to determine the shear strength and deformation characteristics of a soil. In-situ shear testing is done using a system similar to the laboratory shear box test. Large scale testing should be assessed on a case by case basis. Slope failure or settlement of a structure after field tests have been conducted are examples of phenomena which may be considered as back analysis, this be conducted successfully when accompanied by a full investigation to determine the ground and ground water conditions. Geophysical surveying can be useful in site investigation for determining layers of rock other geological features, locating aquifers, mineral deposits, voids - natural or man-made and engineering properties of the ground. Electrical resistivity and seismic methods amongst others are used. This is a specialized field. The geophysical adviser should be involved at all stages.

40|$|The Chinese Loess Plateau (CLP) is a large, {{spatially}} {{well defined}} and persistent zone of loess accumulation developed near the fluctuating northwest {{margin of the}} East Asian monsoon. Many studies have analyzed its loess sediments to provide insights into paleoclimatic conditions. Although spatial and temporal variations in the grain sizes of CLP sediments are fundamental to this effort, controversy over {{the origin of the}} dominant coarse quartz silt has limited interpretations. Reexamination of the spatial pattern of grain-size distribution across the CLP and a field-scale experiment conducted in the Gobi Desert revealed a genetic association between the <b>coarse</b> <b>silt</b> fraction of the loess and primary production of <b>coarse</b> <b>silt</b> through eolian abrasion of sand in the proximal Mu-Us, Tengger, and Badain Jaran sandy deserts. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of eolian abrasion of quartz sand in primary <b>coarse</b> <b>silt</b> production in Central Asia and identify this process as the most consistent with the wellrecognized systematic northwest-southeast depositional pattern of the CLP. We suggest that only abraded coarse quartz grains transported short distances by long-term persistent eolian activity can build up thick loess sequences to form a massive and spatially well defined loess plateau.

Vibratory cone penetration tests (VCPTU) represent a new approach for the evaluation of cyclic softening in fine grained sediments. In the past, VPCTU were utilized to evaluate liquefaction potential of sands, but cyclic softening of fine-grained marine sediments has not yet been tested with VCPTU in situ. At the study site in Orkdalsfjord, mid Norway marine clayey silt deposits are interbedded with <b>coarse</b> <b>silt</b> and clay layers.

Samples from 3 surficial layers were also taken at 3 landscape positions at Moorfield to investigate recent (within-season) soil particle redistribution. Size fractions were determined using chemical dispersion, wet sieving (to separate the sand fractions) and laser gramilometry (for the finer fractions). The distribution of various fractions and {{the relationships between}} elevation and the various fractions suggest preferential detachment and movement of coarse to very <b>coarse</b> <b>silt</b> fractions (16 - 63 mu m), which were found mostly at downslope or depositional areas.

BSF sediment is derived from a quartzose sedimentary and felsic igneous provenance and the original sediment was in part derived from oceanic arc material. Underlying and overlying formations are derived fi 2 ̆ 7 om felsic and intermediate igneous provinces and the original sediment was derived from passive to active continental margin material. Palynological analysis is in agreement with previous research that the BSF belongs to the mid-Toumaisian, Spelaeotriletes pretiosus - Raistrickia clavata (PC) Biozone. Climate change is not considered a factor in BSF deposition owing to the continuation of spore assemblages, through the BSF without major change. The reworked acritarchs are restricted mainly to the Ordovician and Silurian. The occurrence of acritarch species commonly restricted to the Devonian is discussed...|$|R
40|$|The {{detrital}} {{component of}} marine sediment {{is a powerful}} recorder of paleoenvironmental changes in a marginal sea such as the South China Sea. This is in particular valid for the magnetic fraction {{that is one of}} the key parameters for paleoenvironmental studies in the South China Sea, although poorly used so far. We report here on the analysis of the magnetic properties of a 50 m-long sedimentary sequence retrieved from the northern South China Sea, on the continental slope off the Pearl River mouth. Magnetic minerals with different coercivities (magnetite, pyrrhotite, and hematite) are mixed. The variations in relative content of these magnetic minerals illustrate influences of various external forcing mechanisms at different timescales. The pyrrhotite content exhibits a long-term increase, which is also observed in illite+chlorite content, indicating a continuous enhancement of supply from Taiwan most likely related to active Taiwan orogeny. Glacial-interglacial fluctuations are characterized by more magnetite and pyrrhotite with <b>coarser</b> <b>silt</b> and magnetic grains during glacials than interglacials. This is attributed to sea-level changes with the enormous continental shelf exposed during glacials, in turn affecting the sediment transport distance and pathway. On a shorter timescale, larger hematite inputs in fine-grained sediments coincide with precession minima. We suggest that this periodic hematite supply change is related to the eolian dust deposited at the studied site in addition to the fluvial and oceanic transported materials...|$|R
40|$|Diatom biofilms {{growing at}} {{the surface of the}} {{intertidal}} mudflat of Marennes Oléron, France, were incubated for 48 h in the laboratory under simulated conditions of high- and low tide (immersed and emersed in seawater) and day and night (illuminated or dark conditions). The biofilms were subsequently sampled using the cryolander technique, without disturbing the structure. The samples were kept in liquid nitrogen until they were transferred to the cooled stage of a field-emission cryo-scanning electron microscope, which was used to study the structural relationships between the sediment particles, the diatoms and the different types of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) produced by these organisms. The diatoms were most abundant at the sediment surface when incubated in the light under emersed conditions. In the dark or when immersed, the diatoms migrated into the sediment. In the light, the diatoms were coated with EPS, while {{this was not the case}} when incubated in the dark. When immersed, the sediment surface appeared smooth as the result of the deposition of mud. Under emersed conditions, the <b>coarser</b> <b>silt</b> grains were prominently present. These grains were wrapped with organic matter and bound together through threads of EPS. This was the case both in light and in dark incubated sediment. It is proposed that this latter type of EPS contributes to the increased erosion threshold of intertidal mudflats colonized by biofilms of diatoms.
