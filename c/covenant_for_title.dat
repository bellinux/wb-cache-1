40|$|The {{recent case}} of Bisby v. Walker, 169 N. W. 467, {{decided by the}} Supreme Court of Iowa November 23, 1918, is an {{interesting}} instance of an all too common lack of appreciation {{and understanding of the}} very fundamentals of property law. Under the will of her grandfather B became entitled to a contingent remainder (at least the court treated it as such) in certain lands; the contingency upon which her taking depended was her being one of the surviving children of her mother {{at the time of the}} death of the life tenant, the testator 2 ̆ 7 s widow. During the continuance of the prior estate and therefore while her remainder was contingent B executed several mortgages, some describing the mortgaged property by metes and bounds and some as all her 2 ̆ 2 right, title, and interest 2 ̆ 22 ̆ 7 in the devised lands. These mortgages all contained <b>covenants</b> <b>for</b> <b>title</b> or recitals indicating an intention to convey 2 ̆ 2 absolute title in fee simple. 2 ̆ 2 While the remainder was still contingent, and after the execution of all of the mortgages but one B went through bankruptcy and received the usual discharge. It was held, undoubtedly correctly so, that the mortgages were enforceable liens upon B 2 ̆ 7 s interest in the devised lands after the death of the life tenant, B having survived her...|$|R
50|$|The {{land was}} {{sold by the}} company to George W. Miller, to whom a {{certificate}} of sale was given, which afterwards was assigned to Lewis Dunmeyer, to whom the company made a deed purporting to convey a good <b>title.</b> On this <b>covenant</b> <b>for</b> good <b>title</b> Dunmeyer brought the present action, alleging that the railroad company never had any title, and that the covenant was therefore broken. On this issue the case was tried. Several other defenses were set up, among them that the covenant was not broken, because Dunmeyer was in possession when he bought the certificate issued to Miller and when he took his deed, {{and has never been}} disturbed or ousted; that Miller was in possession when he bought of the company and transferred possession to Dunmeyer, and that this has been held ever since, and that Miller's purchase was a compromise of disputed rights, and he and Dunmeyer are therefore estopped to maintain this action. But these and perhaps other points, decided against plaintiff in error, do not present questions of federal law which this Court can review in a judgment of a state court.|$|R

In this report I evaluate the design of a <b>covenant</b> <b>for</b> conservation forestry on Cortes Island, British Columbia. I assess both structural and ecological provisions of the covenant to determine whether covenants were a useful tool for conservation forestry in this case. Effective <b>covenants</b> <b>for</b> conservation forestry must include clear objectives, balance flexibility with rigour, adopt provisions to maximize compliance and include a monitoring program. In addition to regulating forest practices, <b>covenants</b> <b>for</b> conservation forestry should protect habitat at multiple scales, designate reserves, maintain structural complexity and ensure connectivity across the landscape. Careful consideration must also be given to how <b>covenants</b> <b>for</b> conservation forestry will incorporate societal values...|$|R
