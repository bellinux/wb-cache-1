5|$|Rainfall {{and storm}} surge flooded 20 homes in Terrebonne Parish. In addition, several homes in Lafouche Parish {{experienced}} flooding, including two with over {{two feet of}} water. Numerous homes in Golden Meadow experienced flooding, as well. The flooding also forced the temporary closing of numerous roads across the state, including portions of U.S. Route 11 and Interstate 10. Flood waters from the storm <b>cracked</b> <b>a</b> water line in LaPlace, leaving nearly 30,000 residents and many businesses without tap water. The problem was expected to take little time to fix, though residents were advised to boil the water before drinking it. Matthew also left 2,500people without power {{for a short period}} of time. The storm's impact also closed several schools, forcing school administrators to reschedule plans for making up school closings caused by Hurricane Ivan one month earlier. In all, Matthew caused no deaths and $255,000 in damage (2004USD).|$|E

25|$|This tour {{can best}} be remembered for being India's first tour to Australia and also for being Bradman's last test series at home and his second last series. It was perhaps because of this that {{it was assumed that}} the Indians were {{actually}} keen to watch Bradman play. Even though India capitulated for scores less than hundred four times on the tour, their batsmen performed well individually. In fact, Dattu Phadkar, who <b>cracked</b> <b>a</b> century in fourth test, and hit three fifties as well, headed the averages. Vijay Hazare became a sensation after his two centuries in the same match. Vinoo Mankad hit two centuries, in the third and fifth tests, however, it was the failure from an experienced campaigner and their team captain Lala Amarnath, which hastened the team's heavy loss.|$|E
25|$|Dawson's {{first team}} debut for Gloucestershire {{came in a}} Sunday League match against Nottinghamshire at Trent Bridge in May 1992. The {{following}} month he made his first-class debut against Lancashire at Old Trafford. Initially, Dawson was a regular feature in the Gloucestershire team. Primarily a batsman, in his first couple of seasons with the county he struggled with his batting form, averaging 11.00 and 21.87 in the 1992 and 1993 seasons respectively, although in the 1992 season he did record his maiden half century. The 1994 season was to prove to be Dawson's most productive in first-class cricket, making 16 first-class appearances and scoring 1,112 runs (the only time in his first-class career he would pass 1,000 runs in a season) at a batting average of 42.76. Indeed, with this season it seemed that Dawson's potential was beginning to be fulfilled as he <b>cracked</b> <b>a</b> maiden century, scoring 127* against Cambridge University and scoring seven half centuries.|$|E

500|$|Great Captain Island Lighthouse is a {{lighthouse}} on Great Captain Island {{in the western}} Long Island Sound {{off the coast of}} Greenwich, Connecticut, United States. Built in 1829, the first lighthouse, made of stone, was of such poor construction that the walls were severely <b>cracked</b> <b>a</b> decade later. In 1868, a new granite dwelling with attached lantern was completed. The lighthouse is of the same design as lighthouses at Sheffield Island in Norwalk; Morgan Point in Noank; Old Field Point Light and Plum Island in New York; and Block Island North in Rhode Island. In 1890, a fog whistle was added, in 1905 a siren was installed. The lighthouse was deactivated in 1970 when a skeletal tower replaced it. The Town of Greenwich acquired the property in 1973 and had full-time caretakers on the site until the lighthouse became too dilapidated in 2003. A successful restoration effort was completed in 2009 and a non-navigational light was activated in 2012. In 2010, a memorial plaque was installed to [...] "honor the 23 people who lived in Greenwich, or had a connection to the town", who died in the September 11, 2001 attacks. In 1991, the Great Captain Island Light was added to the National Register of Historic Places.|$|E

The 1895 had its epicenter near Charleston, Missouri.

40|$|International audienceIn this article, {{we develop}} a closed-form {{solution}} for <b>a</b> <b>crack</b> in <b>a</b> magnetoelectroelastic strip of finite width, subjected to anti-plane mechanical and in-plane electric and magnetic fields. Explicit expressions for the stresses, electric and magnetic fields, {{together with their}} intensity factors are obtained for the two extreme cases of <b>an</b> impermeable <b>crack</b> and <b>a</b> permeable <b>crack.</b> Solutions for some special cases, such as <b>a</b> center <b>crack,</b> <b>an</b> edge <b>crack,</b> <b>a</b> semi-infinite medium, and an infinite medium, are also obtained in closed-forms. The problem of two symmetric and collinear cracks is also discussed. It is found that the electrically and magnetically permeable conditions on the crack profile are important in obtaining the correct crack tip electromagnetic filed intensity factors. The stress intensity factor, however, {{does not depend on}} the crack electromagnetic boundary condition assumptions...|$|R
2500|$|The Pryor Mountains are a [...] {{region of}} Montana and Wyoming. They were {{formed in the}} late Cretaceous and Early Tertiary period (about 70 to 60 million years ago) when magma welling up from below <b>cracked</b> <b>a</b> vast {{limestone}} plateau into four pieces and uplifted {{the northeast corner of}} each piece. The Bighorn River flows north from Wyoming until it reaches the plateau between the Bighorn and Pryor mountains. The river flows along the fault line between the two mountain ranges, and has cut the Bighorn Canyon deep into the limestone. The Crow Native American tribe called the mountains Baahpuuo Isawaxaawuua ("Hitting the Rock Mountains"), because of the large amount of flint found there (a type of rock which could be chipped into arrowheads and spear points). The mountains draw their current name from Sergeant Nathaniel Hale Pryor, a member of the Lewis and Clark Expedition who vainly pursued horses stolen from the expedition in the area.|$|E

Zhang Yu accompanied Liu Zhang when he met Liu Bei for a reception banquet in Fu County (涪縣; present-day Mianyang, Sichuan). During the banquet, Liu Bei saw that Zhang Yu had a thick beard, so {{he came up with}} a joke to make fun of Zhang Yu: [...] "When I was in Zhuo County (涿縣), there were many people with the family name Mao. They were everywhere, be it north, south, east or west. The Prefect even remarked, 'Zhuo County is surrounded by Maos!'" [...] Zhang Yu also <b>cracked</b> <b>a</b> joke to get back at Liu Bei: [...] "Once upon a time, there was a certain Prefect of Lu County (潞縣) who was later reassigned to Zhuo County. After he retired, someone wanted to write him a letter but didn't know how to address him in a way that reflected the two appointments he held, so he thought of the term 'Gentleman of Lu-Zhuo' (潞涿君)." [...] Zhang Yu's joke was meant to mock Liu Bei, who had no beard.|$|E

In contrast to this image of an outgoing, lively young man, when Toole's mother came to visit, friends noticed that he became sullen and withdrawn. His friend Pat Rickels commented that Thelma [...] "was absolutely convinced that he was without flaw and that all the hopes of the world lay in him.
