The scientist had just quit his job at the research labs of Stark International (as it had just been bought out by Stane International) and had taken his research with him. The scientist, too impatient to wait for the bus, was hit by a car, and the drifter stole the scientist's briefcase in the ensuing confusion. Discovering the force field generator, the man began a crime spree in the Los Angeles metropolitan area. Soon, however, he was interrupted by the Avenger Wonder Man, and later, by one of the Avengers' initial outings as a west coast branch team. Spooked by these encounters, the Blank was on the verge of leaving town when the supervillain Graviton emerged from the generator's <b>charging</b> <b>device,</b> using the device to escape from extra-dimensional exile. The Blank assumed a role as lieutenant in Graviton's attempt to unite the Los Angeles criminal underworld under the supervillain's control, but became caught up in Graviton's rage during an encounter with the Avengers and was swept out to sea along with the heroes. The Blank went missing at this point, and was not seen again for some time.|$|E
