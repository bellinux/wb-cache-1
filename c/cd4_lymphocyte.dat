50|$|The HIV {{virus is}} {{commonly}} transmitted via unprotected sexual activity, blood transfusions, hypodermic needles, and from mother to child. Upon {{acquisition of the}} virus, the virus replicates inside and kills T helper cells, which are required for almost all adaptive immune responses. There is an initial period of influenza-like illness, and then a latent, asymptomatic phase. When the <b>CD4</b> <b>lymphocyte</b> count falls below 200 cells/ml of blood, the HIV host has progressed to AIDS, a condition characterized by deficiency in cell-mediated immunity and the resulting increased susceptibility to opportunistic infections and certain forms of cancer.|$|E
50|$|Marginal {{structural}} {{models are}} {{a class of}} statistical models used for causal inference in epidemiology. Such models handle the issue of time-dependent confounding in evaluation of the efficacy of interventions by inverse probability weighting for receipt of treatment. For instance, {{in the study of}} the effect of zidovudine in AIDS-related mortality, <b>CD4</b> <b>lymphocyte</b> is used both for treatment indication, is influenced by treatment, and affects survival. Time-dependent confounders are typically highly prognostic of health outcomes and applied in dosing or indication for certain therapies, such as body weight or lab values such as alanine aminotransferase or bilirubin.|$|E
50|$|In {{positive}} selection the cells expressing the antigen(s) of interest, which {{attached to the}} magnetic column, are washed out to a separate vessel, after removing the column from the magnetic field. This method is useful for isolation of a particular cell type, for instance <b>CD4</b> <b>lymphocytes.</b>|$|R
50|$|An {{experiment}} that used monoclonal antibodies that were specific for chick Ia (a chicken class II {{major histocompatibility complex}} antigen), and T and B-lymphocytes were observed to determine its effects on cellular infiltrates during the development of reovirus arthritis. Within the synovium collected, plasma cells and T-lymphocytes were the primary inflammatory cells present. During the acute-phase, CD8 cells were present in low numbers. The most activity was observed during the subacute phase {{with an increase in}} CD8 and <b>CD4</b> <b>lymphocytes.</b> At this phase, clusters of IgM-positive, B-cells, T-cells, and plasma cells were also observed. During the chronic phase, a high amount of CD4 T- cells and a few IgM-positive B-cells were observed.|$|R
50|$|The {{function}} {{of the immune system}} depends in a large part on interleukins, and rare deficiencies of a number of them have been described, all featuring autoimmune diseases or immune deficiency. The majority of interleukins are synthesized by helper <b>CD4</b> T <b>lymphocytes,</b> as well as through monocytes, macrophages, and endothelial cells. They promote the development and differentiation of T and B lymphocytes, and hematopoietic cells.|$|R
5000|$|HIV is {{associated}} with pathological changes in mainly subcortical and fronto-striatal areas of the brain, including the basal ganglia, deep white matter, and hippocampal regions. Neuroimaging studies of HIV patients indicate that significant volume reductions are apparent in the frontal white matter, whereas subcortically, hypertrophy is apparent in the basal ganglia, especially the putamen. Moreover, the results of some studies suggest loss of brain volume in cortical and subcortical regions even in asymptomatic HIV patients and patients who were on stable treatment. [...] A recent longitudinal study of a small representative cohort of HIV-positive patients on stable medication regiments suggests that this cortical atrophy is progressive, and is in part related to nadir CD4. [...] Cerebral brain volume {{is associated}} with factors related to duration {{of the disease and}} CD4 nadir; patients with a longer history of chronic HIV and higher CD4 nadir loss present with greater cerebral atrophy. [...] <b>CD4</b> <b>lymphocyte</b> counts have also been related to greater rates of brain tissue loss. [...] Current factors, such as plasma HIV RNA, {{have been found to be}} associated with brain volumes as well, especially with regards to basal ganglia volume and total white matter.|$|E
50|$|CD4 {{testing is}} a normal {{practice}} in the clinical laboratory, and is accomplished {{through the use of}} flow cytometry. Flow cytometry is a standard technique used in virtually every hospital and research institution around the world. While flow cytometry techniques are straightforward, they are not necessarily simple, particularly when applied to clinical practice. A great deal of automated technology is employed to gather measurements, analyze data, and produce reports. Consequently, the cost of performing these tests is relatively high. CD4 testing is generally performed by a flow cytometer. In this process, a small tube of blood cells is treated with a reagent which is specific to the <b>CD4</b> <b>lymphocyte</b> (a type of white blood cell).The reagents used for identification are called monoclonal antibodies (MABs). These antibodies can specifically attach to a certain type of cell. In this case, the antibody will attach to a CD4 T cell. Certain molecules (called fluorochromes) areattached to the antibody to aid in the identification process. When a laser beam is fired at the cells, those cells with the attached molecules emit a signal identifying themselves. This signal is called fluorescence and can easily be measured with sensitive detectors. If hundreds or thousands of cells are forced past the laser very quickly, an accurate count can be obtained of all cells that are present. CD4 cells are measured in this manner. CD is an acronym for “cluster of differentiation,” and that simply means that this molecule can be classified into a well-defined group of cells. In this case, it is cluster of differentiation 4, or a CD4 helper T-lymphocyte cell.|$|E
50|$|His {{research}} has focussed on retroviruses, initially {{as a means}} of understanding T-cell leukemia and other cancers, which may be caused by retroviruses. A break-through discovery in 1971 was that the retroviral genome in chickens follows the rules of Mendelian inheritance. Later his work moved on to HIV, also a retrovirus, and made several new important discoveries, most notably identifying <b>CD4</b> on <b>lymphocytes</b> as the binding receptor for HIV.|$|R
5000|$|APOBEC3G mRNA is {{expressed}} in certain cells, referred to as non-permissive cells, in which HIV-1 cannot properly infect and replicate {{in the absence of}} Vif. Such cells include physiologically relevant primary <b>CD4</b> T <b>lymphocytes</b> and macrophages. The encapsidation of APOBEC3G into HIV-1 virions is very important for the spread of APOBEC3G and the exertion of anti-retroviral activity. Encapsidation of APOBEC3G may occur by at least the following four proposed mechanisms (Figure 3): 1. Non-specific packaging of APOBEC3G 2. APOBEC3G interaction with host RNA 3. APOBEC3G interaction with viral RNA 4. Interaction of APOBEC3G with HIV-1 Gag proteins. Only the latter two mechanisms have been extensively confirmed. [...] The amount that is incorporated into virions is dependent on the level of APOBEC3G expression within the cell producing the virion. Xu et al. conducted studies with PBMC cells and found that, in the absence of Vif, 7±4 APOBEC3G molecules were incorporated into the virions and resulted in potent inhibition of HIV-1 replication.|$|R
40|$|Penicillins, {{cephalosporins}} {{and other}} betalactam antibiotics {{are widely used}} antibacterial drugs. Recently {{it was found that}} some of them also have effects on proliferating eukaryotic cells (Neftel, K. A. and Hübscher, U. (1987) Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 31, 1657 - 1661), and one such effect was shown to be the inhibition of DNA polymerase alpha (Huynh Do,U., Neftel, K. A., Spadari, S. and Hübscher, U. (1987) Nucl. Acids Res. 15, 10495 - 10506). The data suggested that degradation products of betalactam antibiotics were responsible for the inhibitory effect on DNA polymerase alpha. There is some confirmation at the structural level, since we found that penicillin binding proteins, the natural target of the cephalosporins, share amino-acid homologies to DNA polymerases and also to reverse transcriptase from HIV 1 (Hafkemeyer, P., Neftel, K. A. and Hübscher, U. Meth. Find. Exp. Clin. Pharmacol. 12, 43 - 46, 1990). We have purified and determined the structure of one product from the cephalosporin Ceftazidim and found one molecule (HP 0. 35) that did not interfere with eukaryotic cell proliferation but rather had a specific inhibitory effect on the RNase H activity of human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV 1) and feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) reverse transcriptases, while the DNA polymerising activity of these enzymes was not affected. RNases H from HeLa cells, calf thymus and Escherichia coli on the other hand were much less affected by HP 0. 35. The inhibitory concentration of 50 % (IC 50) was more than 10 times lower compared to those of all cellular RNases H. We therefore tested the effect of HP 0. 35 on in vitro lentivirus infection as exemplified by FIV-infection of <b>CD(4</b> +) -cat <b>lymphocytes</b> in cell culture. Under conditions where cell proliferation was absolutely unaffected, HP 0. 35 was able to inhibit FIV-infection in <b>CD(4</b> +) -cat <b>lymphocytes.</b> Moreover, preincubation of these lymphocytes with HP 0. 35 rendered the cells completely unsusceptible to FIV-infection. These data suggest that a degradation product of a clinically used betalactam antibiotic might represent an effective inhibitor class for lentiviral RNase H...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Shikonin {{exhibits}} {{a wide range}} of anti-inflammatory actions. Here, we assessed its effects on maturation of murine bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BM-DCs) and on allergic reactions in a murine model of asthma. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH Cultured murine BM-DCs were used to investigate the effects of shikonin on expression of cell surface markers and their stimulation of T-cell proliferation and cytokine production. The therapeutic potential of shikonin was evaluated in a model of allergic airway disease. KEY RESULTS Shikonin dose-dependently inhibited expression of major histocompatibility complex class II, CD 80, CD 86, CCR 7 and OX 40 L on BM-DCs, induced by a mixture of ovalbumin (OVA; 100 mg. mL(- 1)) and thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP; 20 ng. mL(- 1)). Shikonin-treated BM-DCs were poor stimulators of <b>CD(4</b> +) T <b>lymphocyte</b> and induced lower levels of interleukin (IL) - 4, IL- 5, IL- 13 and tumour necrosis factor (TNF) -alpha release by responding T-cells. After intratracheal instillation of shikonin in OVA-immunized mice, OVA challenge induced lower IL- 4, IL- 5, IL- 13, TNF-alpha and eotaxin release in bronchial alveolar lavage fluid, lower IL- 4 and IL- 5 production in lung cells and mediastinal lymph node cells and attenuated OVA-induced lung eosinophilia and airway hyperresponsiveness. CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS Shikonin effectively suppressed OVA + TSLP-induced BM-DC maturation in vitro and inhibited allergic inflammation and airway hyperresponsiveness in a murine model of asthma, showing good potential as a treatment for allergic asthma. Also, our model provides a novel platform for screening drugs for allergic diseases...|$|R
5000|$|Jacques Leibowitch is at {{the center}} of the {{research}} on AIDS since the original outbreak of the epidemic, from the very moment when the investigation on its causative agent was launched. When the first series of AIDS cases in the United States were published in the New England Journal of Medicine and the Lancet in December 1981, Leibowitch noticed the similarity between the cases described in the United States and the historic case of a multiple-opportunistic infection syndrome in a Portuguese resident in Paris who had spent time in Angola and Mozambique between 1973 -76. He was then contacted by Willy Rozenbaum in March 1982 to set up the informal French Working Group SIDA, a self-nominated body to analyse the cases appearing in France.When in July 1982, the first cases of AIDS appear in hemophiliacs receiving highly filtered blood samples, the scientific community realized that AIDS was most likely caused by a virus. Jacques Leibowitch noticed some intriguing similarities between AIDS and the pathology linked to HTLV (Human T Cell Leukemia Lymphoma Virus), the only known human retro-virus at that time. Both situations affect <b>CD4</b> T helper <b>lymphocyte</b> cells. HTLV induces the massive proliferation of one or several clones and their cancerization, whereas the other virus, the HIV virus tends to eradicate these cells without apparent discrimination. Otherwise, these two pathological descriptions are present in both Africa and the Caribbean (see. A Strange Virus of Unknown Origin Jacques Leibowitch, Ballantine Books, New York, 1985, translated from Un Virus Etrange Venu d’Ailleurs, Grasset Paris 1984 [...] ). Indeed, in both Paris and Brussels, doctors had seen cases of patients having lived or spent time in Francophone Africa or in Haiti who suffered from a disease with an undeniable resemblance to that arising at the time in the United States in [...] "immuno-deficient homosexuals". Leibowitch, informed by the Franco-American literary author Gilles Barbedette of the announcement by Robert Gallo in Medical World News (August 1, 1982) that an HTLV type retro-virus could be at the cause of AIDS, found in that most succinct brief the profile matching his CD4-tropic exotic viral suspect (in Grasset, Ballantine Books, workS cited). The retro-viral inspiration was thus consolidated and opened between Bethesda (Gallo) and Paris (Leibowitch et al.) from August 1982 onwards. Failing to find in the Paris team of Professeur Jean-Paul Lévy [...] or the Lille team of Dominique Stéhelin a French retro-virus specialist eager to pursue this line of investigation, he contacted upon a recommendation by Jean Paul Lévy Professor Robert Gallo in Bethesda, the then world-renowned virologist on HTLV. It was then in November 1982 that Gallo informed him from Bethesda of his initial virology findings in keeping with the AIDS HTLV-type virus hypotheses. For his part, Willy Rozenbaum, warned in private by Leibowitch that an exotic HTLV-type retrovirus could well be the cause of AIDS, embarks upon a discreet collaboration with the Luc Montagnier team of the Pasteur Institute. Montagnier, along with his collaborator Jean-Claude Chermann, had just recently received news of the HTLV and AIDS hypotheses by Dr Paul Prunet, the then director of « Recherche&Développement » at Sanofi-Pasteur-Marnes La Coquette, where Leibowitch had given a speech at the end of November 1982. The Montagnier team subsequently detected in the cell culture of patient BRU the traces of the first non HTLV retrovirus in January 1983, a virus eventually recognized as the cause of AIDS thanks to the conclusive additions by Robert Gallo and his group (April 1984) sur le site de la Jon Cohen AIDS Research Collection, 2 pages. Luc Montagnier and Françoise Barré-Sinoussi received the Nobel Prize for Medicine in 2008 for their work. In a letter to the prestigious magazine Nature Medicine in 2003, as well as in his Nobel Prize acceptance speech in 2008, Luc Montagnier recognizes Jacques Leibowitch as being the initiator of the retro-virus hypothesis in France [...] However, the patented list of the discoverers of AIDS and HIV do not take Jacques Leibowitch into account for his contribution in the initial phases of the discovery. The scientific historian Mirko Grmek reflects back on the details of the stages that led to the discovery of the AIDS virus in his work “the History of AIDS” and the Jon Cohen AIDS Research Collection contains numerous archived documents on the subject. The book “Sida.O” (AIDS.O) written by D. Lestrade and G.Pialoux contains also many details on the history of AIDS.|$|R
