50|$|The {{architect}} Archibald Leitch {{brought his}} experience {{with the construction of}} industrial buildings to bear on the design of functional stadiums up and down the country. His work encompassed the first 40 years of the 20th century. One of his most notable designs was Old Trafford in Manchester. The ground was originally designed with a capacity of 100,000 spectators and featured seating in the south stand under cover, while the remaining three stands were left as terraces and uncovered. It was the first stadium to feature <b>continuous</b> <b>seating</b> along the contours of the stadium.|$|R
5000|$|Through the 2004 season, the {{official}} {{capacity of the}} stadium stood at 35,362. In 2003 the Raising Reser campaign was initiated, which resulted in an increase of seating capacity to 43,300 for the 2005 season by way of constructing a new grandstand along the northeast sideline, with plans to eventually reach 55,000 seats through three phases of renovation."Phase Two" [...] of the Raising Reser project was completed between the 2006 and 2007 football seasons; it enclosed the horseshoe in the southeast end zone with <b>continuous</b> <b>seating</b> in the corners. This addition raised total seating capacity to 45,674 and included the 80 x 30 ft ProStar Digital VideoPlus Display screen.|$|R
60|$|So, Mr. George {{leading the}} way, {{and the others}} following, they all passed round the gallery towards the other side. The gallery was not very wide, the space being only {{sufficient}} {{for two or three}} persons to walk abreast. There was a high balustrade on the edge of it, {{and on the other side}} a <b>continuous</b> <b>seat</b> against the wall. First Rollo and Jennie, running forward a little way, sat down on the seat to try it. Then, going forward again a little in advance of Mr. George and Mrs. Holiday, they stopped to look over the balustrade. Rollo could look over it down upon the floor of the church far below. Jennie was not tall enough to look over the balustrade, and so she looked through.|$|R
5000|$|Before the American Revolution, Grace Galloway {{was one of}} {{the most}} {{prominent}} figures in Pennsylvania society, in part because Joseph Galloway, a strong loyalist, held a <b>continuous</b> <b>seat</b> in the assembly from 1757 to 1776 (except for 1764) and served as the Speaker of the House from 1766 to 1775. Their social standing began to decline when it became clear the British were losing the war, but the Galloways remained true to their loyalist beliefs even in a society that was highly revolutionist. [...] Joseph was removed from the speakership and became a public example that loyalism would not be tolerated in the new age. When the war started going poorly for the British, Joseph and Elizabeth sought protection with the British, leaving Grace behind to defend and reclaim the family land. Grace never saw her husband or daughter again. Grace's continued loyalist beliefs and the fact that Joseph had abandoned her made her a social pariah. Grace worried that the name Galloway and Growden was being ruined. Grace recounted in her diary: [...] "No one will take me in and all the men keep away from me... I am fled from as pestilence". This was especially hard for Grace because she had been held in such esteem for all of her life previously.|$|R
25|$|A Windsor {{chair is}} a chair built {{with a solid}} wooden seat into which the chair-back and legs are round-tenoned, or pushed into drilled holes, in {{contrast}} to standard chairs, where the back legs and the uprights of the back are <b>continuous.</b> The <b>seats</b> of Windsor chairs were often carved into a shallow dish or saddle shape for comfort. Traditionally, the legs and uprights were usually turned on a pole lathe. The back and sometimes the arm pieces (if arms are present) are formed from steam bent pieces of wood.|$|R
5000|$|After {{leaving the}} army, Westphal was {{involved}} in various bands including the Benson Orchestra of Chicago. In 1921, he became established with his own dance orchestra at the newly opened Rainbo Gardens in Chicago. The open-air venue had a revolving stage to allow for <b>continuous</b> entertainment, table <b>seating</b> for 2,000 patrons, and space {{on the dance floor}} for an additional 1,500.|$|R
50|$|It {{is one of}} {{the more}} {{substantial}} stadiums in Bangkok. On one side is a - barely - covered stand fitted with red seats. 'B M A' (Bangkok Metropolitan Administration) is picked out in white seats (The BMA own the stadium). The rest of the stadium is a <b>continuous</b> ring with <b>seats</b> fitted throughout (unusual in Thailand). The word 'BANGKOK' has been picked out with white seats in the stand opposite the main stand. This stand also has an insignificant cover. Unusually for a Thai stadium there is a perimeter fence on three sides separating the stands from the pitch.|$|R
50|$|Alberti did {{not concern}} {{himself with the}} practicalities of building, and very few of his major works were brought to completion. As a {{designer}} and a student of Vitruvius and of ancient Roman remains, he grasped the nature of column and lintel architecture, from the visual rather than structural viewpoint, and correctly employed the Classical orders, unlike his contemporary, Brunelleschi, who utilised the Classical column and pilaster in a free interpretation. Among Alberti's concerns was the social effect of architecture, and to this end he was very {{well aware of the}} cityscape. This is demonstrated by his inclusion, at the Rucellai Palace, of a <b>continuous</b> bench for <b>seating</b> {{at the level of the}} basement.|$|R

50|$|The {{doorway to}} the upper chamber is ornate with Purbeck marble shafts to either side and {{mouldings}} above. There was originally a drawbar running into holes. Originally the walls would have been plastered smooth and painted like stone. The original division of the hall was into a high status decorated room {{to the west and}} a simpler room to the east. The fireplaces and stack which dominate the room are from the 17th-century modifications by the Blakes. The entrance door led directly into the western room which would have been used for communal activities and for eating. The better lit eastern end was probably a chamber, similar to those provided at episcopal and royal palaces for visiting guests. Heating would have been by brazier, there is plenty of height and no evidence of medieval filerplaces. There is <b>continuous</b> wall <b>seating</b> from which pilars of purbeck marble rose to carry an arcade. This arcade has been mutilated and partially restored. Such plaster as remains carries later graffiti including a name, possibly Cray. The chamber at the eastern end has two splayed recesses, tentatively identified as a wash baison and a privy within a screened off garderobe. Scattered floor tiles have been found and it is probable that the upper floor was tiled prior to the departure of the Templars. At the western end there {{appears to have been a}} form of serving hatch from a now lost and unrecorded western extension. A later oven or still is of unknown purpose.|$|R
40|$|In {{this report}} we {{describe}} {{a patient with}} a tight filum associated with a small concentric lipoma that was treated by cutting the filum terminale through a totally endoscopic approach. Our approach required {{the creation of a}} midline surgical corridor provided by the placement of a telescopic self-retaining retractor over the ligamentum flavum at L 5 -S 1, under endoscopic control. The ligamentum was partially removed, the dura and the arachnoid opened and the filum terminale and the roots of the cauda exposed. After neurophysiological confirmation of the absence of neural structures the filum was coagulated and cut, the dura was closed by a <b>continuous</b> suture and <b>seated</b> with fibrin glue. The entire surgery was performed under the illumination and magnification provided by a rigid endoscope working in an aerial environment. This case shows that the cauda can be explored and the filum terminale cut with a minimally invasive endoscopic approach that does not significantly compromise the structural integrity of the spine, requires only a short dural incision, therefore reducing the risk of postoperative cerebrospinal fluid leakage, and allows the use of multiple surgical instruments in an aerial environment. © Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart...|$|R
6000|$|... § XV. But the {{severity}} {{which is so}} marked in the pulpit at Torcello is still more striking in the raised seats and episcopal throne which occupy {{the curve of the}} apse. The arrangement at first somewhat recalls to the mind that of the Roman amphitheatres; the flight of steps which lead up to the central throne divides the curve of the <b>continuous</b> steps or <b>seats</b> (it appears in the first three ranges questionable which were intended, for they seem too high for the one, and too low and close for the other), exactly as in an amphitheatre the stairs for access intersect the sweeping ranges of seats. But in the very rudeness of this arrangement, and especially in the want of all appliances of comfort (for the whole is of marble, and the arms of the central throne are not for convenience, but for distinction, and to separate it more conspicuously from the undivided seats), there is a dignity which no furniture of stalls nor carving of canopies ever could attain, and well worth the contemplation of the Protestant, both as sternly significative of an episcopal authority which {{in the early days of}} the Church was never disputed, and as dependent for all its impressiveness on the utter absence of any expression either of pride or self-indulgence.|$|R
