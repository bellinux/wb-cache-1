Entre os fatores que contribuíram para a evolução no ritmo de produção destacam-se a utilização da irrigação e o manejo do solo, a fim de tornar mais produtivas áreas anteriormente tidas como pouco adequadas para a atividade agrícola. Nesse contexto situa-se o Cerrado brasileiro. A discussão nesta dissertação trata da expansão da implantação de sistemas de irrigação na sub-bacia do ribeirão Entre-Ribeiros, tributário do rio Paracatu – que, por sua vez, é o {{principal}} afluente, em volume hídrico, da margem esquerda do rio São Francisco – em Minas Gerais. Tal processo produziu escassez de água na área, especialmente em função das captações sem os devidos cuidados técnicos. Ocorreu, então, a intervenção do Ministério Público, exigindo a readequação das práticas irrigantes. Esta readequação tem sido estruturada a partir de iniciativas dos próprios produtores, limitando-se os órgãos públicos às ações punitivas. Os objetivos do trabalho foram identificar as relações entre oferta e demanda hídrica na bacia, estudar as formas de atuação do poder público e os conflitos entre produtores e, por fim, sugerir possibilidades de desenvolvimento sustentável da agricultura irrigada na bacia do Entre-Ribeiros. A metodologia adotada compreende, além da revisão bibliográfica, registro fotográfico, entrevistas, coleta de dados acerca da oferta e demanda de água na bacia, da área irrigada, das outorgas concedidas e sobre o volume de precipitação na região. Também houve análise de dois documentos que abordam o caso: o Inquérito Civil n. 1 / 2002 e o Diagnóstico Ambiental da Bacia. _______________________________________________________________________________ ABSTRACTThe agricultural activities if {{had developed}} technical objectifying to increase {{to the maximum}} of the productivity. Between the factors that had contributed for the evolution in the production rhythm are distinguished it use of the irrigation and {{the handling of the}} ground, in order to become more productive areas previously had as little adjusted for the agricultural activity. In this context the Brazilian Savannah is placed. The quarrel in this text deals with the expansion of the implantation of systems of irrigation in the sub-basin of the Entre- Ribeiros river, tributary of the Paracatu river – that, in turn, it is the main tributary, in water volume, of the left edge of the São Francisco river – in Minas Gerais. Such process produced water scarcity, especially in function of the which had <b>captations</b> without well-taken care of the technician, occurred, then, the intervention of the public prosecution service, demanding the change of the irrigation practical. This change has been structuralized from initiatives of the proper producers, limiting itself the public agencies to the punitive actions. The objectives of the work had been to identify the relations between offer and water demand in the basin, to study the forms of performance of the government and the conflicts between producers and, finally, to suggest possibilities of sustainable development of the agriculture irrigated in the basin of the Entre-Ribeiros river. The adopted methodology understands, beyond the bibliographical revision, photographic register, interviews, collects of data concerning offers and water demand in the basin, of the irrigated area, the granted grants and on the volume of precipitation in the region. Also it had analysis of two documents that approach the case: the Civil Inquiry n. 1 / 2002 and the Environmental Diagnosis of the Basin...|$|R

He realized fictions : Piste (1980), Moco Fictions(2007), documentaries : Théatre, Ecole Créativité (1982) and Looking For Beethoven ( [...] 2012 [...] ), experimental films : Paris Figure Simple ( [...] 1986 [...] ) and Nyc Nac Solo (1989) and videos : Correspondance avec Jean-Luc Godard (1985) and Laos Noblabla (2011). At the same time, he developed visual prototypes such as Switcher Video Band.From 1985, he is particularly drawn to new technologies. He joined the Ars Technica Association {{connected to the}} Cité des Sciences et de l'Industrie uniting philosophers, artists, scientists such as Piotr Kowalski, Jean-Marc Levy-Leblond, Claude Faure, Jean-Max Albert, Sara Holt, Piero Gilardi, reflecting {{on the relationship between}} art and new technologies. In 1989, Dominique Noguez recommended him for the 1st Biennial of Contemporary Art of Barcelona. He showed a video installation in 12 TV monitors arranged in pyramid. In the 90s, he was considered one of the precursors of HDTV beside Jean-Christophe Averty, David Niles, Zbigniew Rybczynski, Jacques Barsac, Pierre Trividic, Hervé Nisic. He produced and realized experimental programs such as Dix-neuvième for Canal+. In 1991, uniting his activities of R&D in audiovisual media conception, he created jcMCK, his own production company.In 1992, the Centre national d’art et de culture Georges-Pompidou showed his experimental movies and videos at the Cinéma du Musée curated by Jean-Michel Bouhours. Beside Catherine Desrosiers, Catherine Beuve-Mery and Maurice Séveno, Jean-Claude Mocik participated in the CICV of Belfort Montbéliard, with the conception of an interactive TV program. In December, 1993, {{at the request of the}} 35mm laboratory Les 3 Lumières,he inaugurated Switcher Vidéo Band, an experimental multicameras <b>captation</b> in Le Palace, Paris.In 1994, he left one of the main cooperatives of experimental films in Paris, Light Cône, and made the decision to broadcast his experimental movies and video tapes exclusively thru his personal workshop. Recommended by Olivier Bontemps and Christophe Valdejo, two art directors of Gédéon and founders of the agency View, the Italian photographer Oliviero Toscani offered him, in 1995, the management of the department Cinéma-Vidéo of Fabrica, the Research center on the Communication of Benetton, based near Venice. In November, 1996, Fabrice Michel and Alain Josseau invited him to Toulouse to conceive and present a video installation entitled Video Solo in reference to his movie Nyc Nac Solo, shot in 1989 in New-York. L’Atelier de Recherche d’Arte regularly broadcasts his films and vidéos. As a TV director, Jean-Claude Mocik collaborated on numerous programs broadcast on diverse TV channels: Paristroïka, produced and broadcast by MCM Euromusique, Tout Paris for Paris-Première, L’Atelier 246 for FR3, Court Circuit, produced by MK2 broadcast by Arte. He created concepts of documentary series of which Le Travail en questions, a collection of 10 × 52 min animated by Ariel Wizman and Francis von Litsenborgh, were broadcast on La Cinquième.Since 2006, he is in charge of an educational department of Conception, Writing and Directing within the Pole of Education and Research of INA. In 2007, he wrote the screenplay and directed Moco Fictions a visual film essay completely shot with a robot. In 2013, he filmed in Vienna, Austria, Looking For Beethoven, a documentary film on Belcea Quartet for TV Mezzo and for a German music channel Unitel Classica. In February, 2014, at the request of Paul Ouazan, he contributed to a project entitled Le marcheur, broadcast on Arte Creative.|$|E

For {{the right and}} optimal use of this resource, {{in addition to the}} resort to some simple designing expedients that can be brought back to the practice of “building in a workmanlike manner”, it is possible to adopt speciﬁc devices able to improve the sunlight <b>captation.</b> Among these devices a class that presents a very interesting compromise between simplicity of realization, costs and daylighting performances is represented by the so-called “light pipes”. Light pipes usually work by means of a device placed on an external closing element which attends to collect, redirect and in some cases, concentrate or collimate the incident luminous ﬂux, and a device situated inside the environments able to transport the daylight inwards the building and distribute it into the deep zone of the rooms so as to obtain a better illuminance distribution.

The kinetics of β 2 -microglobulin (β 2 m) were studied in 17 anephric or functionally anephric hemodialyzed patients and five healthy subjects as controls. Highly purified β 2 m was radiolabeled with 125 I and infused into patients. The radioactivity in plasma and dialysis fluids was measured during a week including {{two or three}} dialysis sessions. Patients were classified in four groups according to treatment: hemodialysis on Cuprophan (N = 5) or on AN 69 membranes (N = 5), hemofiltration (N = 4) and CAPD (N = 3). Plasma activity was fitted to a three compartment model. In controls almost 100 % of the radioactivity was recovered in urine within 96 hours {{and there was no}} extrarenal catabolism. In patients the fractional catabolic rate ranged from 0. 0008 to 0. 0022 min - 1 versus 0. 026 to 0. 047 min- 1 in controls. The synthetic rate was within the range of values from controls in 10 patients but higher in the seven others. It was correlated with plasma β 2 m concentration. Kinetic data indicate a retention of intact β 2 m. The original model was therefore modified with an additional compartment representing β 2 m <b>captation.</b> The amount of capted β 2 m was more elevated in hemodialyzed patients than in patients treated by hemofiltration or CAPD, in whom it could reach 5 mg/kg/day.

The growth parameters were estimated through the analysis of length distribution and the relationships among time of smaller growth, alimentary activity, fat accumulation and reproductive period were considered. Besides, the instantaneous rate of natural mortality was calculated. Monthly samplings were accomplished in the Ribeirao Claro stream, in the reservoir of water <b>captation</b> of Rio Claro city. For that, 50 m of wait net was used, with meshes of 1. 5, 2. 0, 2. 5, 3. 0 and 3. 5 cm measured between adjacent knots. The ELEFAN I program was used to estimate the growth parameters, and its application was done using the FISAT program. It was also used the seasonal version of von Bertalanffy's growth curve. It was considered that the reproduction of C. modestus is annual and concentrated from December to February, allowing the identification of different modas in the distributions, an essential condition for the conduction of that analysis type. The estimated parameters were: K = 0. 34 /year, L [infinity] = 15. 40 cm, C = 0. 2, Wp = 0. 6 and M = 0. 949 /year, with the identification of four cohorts.

This study {{evaluated}} the hematological response of Pimelodus maculatus captured in two environments with {{different levels of}} pollution in the Itajaí-Açu river, Santa Catarina State, southern Brazil. One of them, hereby named reference site, is a water <b>captation</b> site that supplies the city of Blumenau, in which the riparian forest is preserved {{and there is no}} sewage discharge. The other, denominated polluted site, is characterized by discharge of domestic sewage. After water quality analysis, fish were captured, transported to the laboratory and anesthetized for the hematological exam. In the polluted site, the most probable number of fecal coliforms and water transparency were respectively higher and lower than that observed at the reference site. The main results were an increased percentage of hematocrit and reduced numbers of lymphocytes and monocytes in the differential counting in fish from the polluted site. Red blood cells, total white blood cells and total counting of thrombocytes did not vary between environments. The number of neutrophils remained at high levels in fish from both environments. This study demonstrated that water quality might affect the hematological parameters in free-living fish. Key words: siluriform fish, hematology, sewage, water quality...|$|E
40|$|The {{industrial}} maintenance activities, generally, were considered as more one {{problem to the}} organizations. This image needs to change in Brazil, because this sector {{is part of the}} companies supply chain, is responsible to maintain equipments reliability and availability and it is a generator of the companies costs. This responsibility increases {{in a country where the}} productive capacity is in the limit, demanding extra efforts and where increasing pressures for reductions of the costs and restrictions techniques and human beings are increasing, ask to paradigms changes. The present study had for purpose to identify main canals of <b>captation</b> of the information used by the Brazilian {{industrial maintenance}} professionals, demonstrating systematic use of Competitive Intelligence can bring technological advance and profit of competitive advantage. For this, a qualitative research was made, using as research instruments the Delphi method, interviews with professionals and an experimental delineation C. I- Competitive Intelligence in a department-pilot (automotive sector). The results had shown to the use of formal and informal sources in different frequencies of access and the fragility in these departments in the not-systematic use of C. I, harming the above-mentioned challenges...|$|E
40|$|With the {{introduction}} of preoperative (neoadjuvant) chemotherapy {{in the treatment of}} osteosarcoma, an early preoperative evaluation of the effectiveness of chemotherapy is essential, so that treatment may be modified in cases which are not responsive, and so that the surgical margin may be planned. The authors evaluate the accuracy of total body bone scan with Tc 99 m MDP in determining response to chemotherapy in 43 patients affected with osteosarcoma of the limbs, and preoperatively submitted to two cycles of chemotherapy with MTX i. v. and CDP i. a. All of the cases were submitted to a double bone scan examination, before and after preoperative chemotherapy. A bone scan evaluation using a qualitative method was compared to the percentage of necrosis observed in the tumorous tissue by histological examination carried out after surgery. In 58 % of the cases the two values corresponded perfectly, in 28 % of the cases bone scan evaluation overestimated response, and in 14 % it underestimated it. In order to obtain quantitative preoperative data on response to chemotherapy in osteosarcoma, orientation towards the use of more sophisticated bone scan methods seems to be necessary, with computerized analysis of <b>captation</b> by dynamic measurement after infusion of Tc 99 m MDP or by radiocompounds with intracellular fixation such as Ga 67...|$|E
