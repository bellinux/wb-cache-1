The demand for high reliability found in electronic package attracts more and more researchers to study the properties and distribution <b>of</b> binders and <b>filler</b> particles. These will affect properties such as {{coefficient of thermal expansion}} and stiffness. Both of these contribute strongly to reliability. The filler concentration, size distribution and spatial distribution must be examined in a structured manner to understand their effects on final properties. However, most studies deal with filler concentration and size distribution, while very few studies have tied the particle spatial distribution to the properties. It is not enough to just properly control the filler concentration and size distribution. The more uniform filler distribution, the more uniform are local properties, and this can be achieved by well-designed mixing processes. Mixing is very important and in many cases the goodness <b>of</b> the <b>mixing</b> <b>of</b> <b>fillers</b> will affect or determine the properties of the products. In this thesis, the local properties of electronic package and their relations with filler particle distribution are quantified. For the first time, a new feed protocol that can generate chaotic mixing during filling cavity by implementing periodic and aperiodic filling process is presented. Instead of using single gate in the molding process, we have developed a two-gate feeding protocol.

The behaviour of the carbon black N 234 in a styrene butadiene copolymer was more specifically investigated. Two dispersion mechanisms were observed and characterized: rupture and erosion. The two mechanisms happen during a mixing operation in a batch mixer. The advantage of the rheo-optical approach is that by defining specific shear protocols, it was possible study separately the two mechanisms. Rupture was found to occur above a critical shear rate. Critical conditions for rupture were determined in two SBR matrices and for different carbon black pellet sizes. The condition for rupture {{was found to be}} based on a critical shear stress and to depend on the pellet size. Erosion kinetics was determined. The effect of different parameters (pellet size, shear rate, stress and duration) on the erosion rate was investigated: The erosion process was shown to process via the detachment of a constant eroded volume per strain unit and to be driven by the energy supplied to the system.

The fillers were formulated in three different percentages (20, 30 and 40 wt %) and compounded via extrusion. Samples for all formulations were prepared by injection molding. The mechanical properties (flexural modulus and strength, tensile modulus and strength, impact strength), water absorption and density were measured. The properties of hybrid composites were evaluated by varying the amounts <b>of</b> two <b>fillers</b> at 10 wt%- 20 wt%, 15 wt%- 15 wt% and 20 wt%- 10 wt% each, keeping the overall filler content constant at 30 wt%. The effect <b>of</b> type <b>of</b> <b>filler,</b> filler size and filler content were critical in this work. The results obtained from this study indicated that filler type and filler content greatly influenced the mechanical properties and water absorption characteristics of the composites. The flexural modulus increased with increasing filler content. It was interesting to observe that though the impact strength decreased with the addition <b>of</b> <b>fillers,</b> increasing the filler content from 20 to 40 wt% did not affect the property. With respect to all fillers, wollastonite improved the mechanical properties significantly. Increasing the amount of WS content reduced the composite’s resistance to water absorption. Among mineral fillers, mica showed significantly higher percentage gain in weight with water absorption. Combination <b>of</b> <b>fillers</b> at varying percentages did not have any synergy effect on the mechanical behaviour of the composite. The percentage increase in weight with water absorption was observed to be increasing with increasing WS content in hybrid composites, but significantly lower than pure WS composites. The morphological study on WS composites revealed improved interaction <b>of</b> <b>filler</b> with homopolymer and polypropylene blend...|$|R
40|$|Subject: {{nowadays}} self-compacting concretes (SCC), the use {{of which}} requires no additional compaction, have become widespread for use in densely-reinforced structures and hard-to-reach places. In self-compacting concretes, finely-ground admixtures-microfillers are widely used for controlling technological properties. Their introduction into the concrete mix allows us to obtain more dense structure of concrete. The influence of micro-fillers on water consumption and plasticity <b>of</b> concrete <b>mix,</b> on kinetics <b>of</b> strength gain rate, heat release and corrosion resistance is also noticeable. Research objectives: the work focuses {{on the development of}} composition of self-compacting concrete with assigned properties with {{the use of}} fly ash based on coal burning waste, optimized with the help of experimental design method in order to clarify the influence of ash and cement quantity, sand size on strength properties. Materials and methods: pure Portland cement CEM I 42. 5 N was used as a binder. Crushed granite of fraction 5 … 20 mm was used as coarse aggregate, coarse quartz sand with the fineness modulus of 2. 6 and fine sand with the fineness modulus of 1. 4 were used as fillers. A superplasticizer BASF-Master Glenium 115 was used as a plasticizing admixture. The fly ash from Cherepetskaya thermal power plant was used as a <b>filler.</b> The study <b>of</b> strength and technological properties of self-compacting concrete was performed by using standard methods. Results: we obtained three-factor quadratic dependence of strength properties on the content of ash, cement and fraction <b>of</b> fine <b>filler</b> in the <b>mix</b> <b>of</b> fine <b>fillers.</b> Conclusions: introduction <b>of</b> micro-filler admixture based on the fly ash allowed us to obtain a concrete mix with high mobility, fluidity and self-compaction property. The obtained concrete has high strength characteristics, delayed strength gain rate due to replacement of part of the binder with ash. Introduction of the fly ash increases degree of hydration of Portland cement due to the greater water retention capacity, and also contributes to reduction in total capillary porosity of SCC structure...|$|R
40|$|Electrically {{conductive}} composites {{that contain}} conductive filler dispersed in an insulating polymer matrix are usually {{prepared by the}} vigorous <b>mixing</b> <b>of</b> the components. This affects the structure <b>of</b> the <b>filler</b> particles and thereby {{the properties of the}} composite. It is shown that by careful mixing nano-scale features on the surface <b>of</b> the <b>filler</b> particles can be retained. The fillers used possess sharp surface protrusions similar to the tips used in scanning tunnelling microscopy. The electric field strength at these tips is very large and results in field assisted (Fowler–Nordheim) tunnelling. In addition the polymer matrix intimately coats the filler particles and the particles do not come into direct physical contact. This prevents the formation <b>of</b> chains <b>of</b> <b>filler</b> particles in close contact as the filler content increases. In consequence the composite has an extremely high resistance even at filler loadings above the expected percolation threshold. The retention <b>of</b> <b>filler</b> particle morphology and the presence of an insulating polymer layer between them endow the composite with a number of unusual properties. These are presented here together with appropriate physical models...|$|R
