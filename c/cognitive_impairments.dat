40|$|<b>Cognitive</b> <b>impairment,</b> {{including}} Alzheimer's {{disease and}} other kinds of dementia, is a major health problem in older adults worldwide. Although numerous investigators have attempted to develop effective treatment modalities or drugs, there is no reasonably efficacious strategy for preventing or recovering from <b>cognitive</b> <b>impairment.</b> Therefore, modifiable risk factors for <b>cognitive</b> <b>impairment</b> have received attention, and the growing literature of metabolic risk factors for <b>cognitive</b> <b>impairment</b> has expanded from epidemiology to molecular pathogenesis and therapeutic management.

40|$|BACKGROUND Clinicians need easy {{methods of}} {{screening}} for <b>cognitive</b> <b>impairment</b> {{in patients with}} heart failure. If correlates of <b>cognitive</b> <b>impairment</b> could be identified, more patients with early <b>cognitive</b> <b>impairment</b> could be treated before the problem interfered with adherence to treatment. • OBJECTIVES To describe <b>cognitive</b> <b>impairment</b> in patients with heart failure, to explore the usefulness of 4 measures of <b>cognitive</b> <b>impairment,</b> and to assess correlates of <b>cognitive</b> <b>impairment.</b> • METHODS A descriptive, correlational design was used. Four screening measures of cognition were assessed in 42 patients with heart failure: Commands subtest and Complex Ideational Material subtest of the Boston Diagnostic Aphasia Examination, Mini-Mental State Examination, and Draw-a-Clock Test. <b>Cognitive</b> <b>impairment</b> was defined as performance less than the standardized (T-score) cutoff point on at least 1 of the 4 measures. Possible correlates of <b>cognitive</b> <b>impairment</b> included age, education, hypotension, fluid overload (serum osmolality < 269 mOsm/kg), and dehydration (serum osmolality ≥ 295 mOsm/kg). • RESULTS <b>Cognitive</b> <b>impairment</b> was detected in 12 (28. 6 %) of 42 participants.

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{test whether}} susceptibility-weighted {{magnetic}} resonance imaging at baseline may help predict cognitive decline. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This prospective study {{was approved by the}} institutional review board, and written informed consent was obtained from all participants. Thirty-five healthy control subjects and 69 patients with mild <b>cognitive</b> <b>impairment</b> were included. Patients with mild <b>cognitive</b> <b>impairment</b> underwent neuropsychologic follow-up after 1 year (40 patients with stable mild <b>cognitive</b> <b>impairment,</b> 27 with progressive mild <b>cognitive</b> <b>impairment,</b> and two lost to follow-up). Cerebral microhemorrhages were visually analyzed by two experienced neuroradiologists in consensus. Iron deposition in deep gray matter was assessed with voxel-wise and region-of-interest analysis after nonlinear spatial registration. In addition, individual classification of mild <b>cognitive</b> <b>impairment</b> was analyzed by using a support vector machine (SVM). RESULTS: At baseline, the number of cerebral microhemorrhages was significantly higher in the mild <b>cognitive</b> <b>impairment</b> group than in the control group (P <. 01) but did not differ between the patients with stable and those with progressive mild <b>cognitive</b> <b>impairment.</b> Compared with the control group, patients with mild <b>cognitive</b> <b>impairment</b> had increased iron concentration in the right pallidum (P <. 01) and right substantia nigra (P <. 01) but decreased concentration in the right red nucleus (P <. 05). The classification based on the SVM successfully helped discriminate patients with mild <b>cognitive</b> <b>impairment</b> from the healthy control subjects (accuracy, 84 %; sensitivity, 89 %; specificity, 85 %) and those with stable from those with progressive mild <b>cognitive</b> <b>impairment</b> (accuracy, 85 %; sensitivity, 84 %; specificity, 83 %). CONCLUSION: The findings reveal an accumulation of cerebral microhemorrhage in patients with mild <b>cognitive</b> <b>impairment</b> that is present at baseline, independent of subsequent cognitive decline, as well as an altered iron distribution in subcortical nuclei between the healthy control subjects and patients with mild <b>cognitive</b> <b>impairment.</b> Analysis of iron deposition at baseline performed with an SVM might help identify individual patients with mild <b>cognitive</b> <b>impairment</b> at risk for cognitive decline.

Moreover, these cognitive deficits appear to be consistent cross-culturally, indicating that these impairments are characteristic of the disorder and not attributable to differences in cultural values, norms, or practice.

Communicating hydrocephalus—in which the normal reabsorption of cerebrospinal fluid is blocked and causes increased pressure inside the head—is common in some of the mucopolysaccharidoses. Surgically inserting a shunt into the brain can drain fluid.

40|$|IntroductionBecause of {{the growing}} number of {{caregivers}} and the awareness of related health and quality-of-life issues, caregiving has emerged as an important public health issue. We examined the characteristics and caregiving experiences of caregivers of people with and without <b>cognitive</b> <b>impairment.</b> MethodsParticipants (n = 668) were adults who responded to the 2005 North Carolina Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System. Caregivers were people who provided regular care to a family member or friend aged 60 years or older either with or without <b>cognitive</b> <b>impairment</b> (ie, memory loss, confusion, or Alzheimer's disease). ResultsDemographic characteristics of caregivers of people with <b>cognitive</b> <b>impairment</b> were similar to those of caregivers of people without <b>cognitive</b> <b>impairment.</b> However, compared with caregivers of people without <b>cognitive</b> <b>impairment,</b> caregivers of people with <b>cognitive</b> <b>impairment</b> reported higher levels of disability, {{were more likely to be}} paid, and provided care for a longer duration.

40|$|This thesis explores what a {{range of}} people know and {{understand}} about <b>cognitive</b> <b>impairment.</b> The research presented here also explores the language and terminology that people use when discussing <b>cognitive</b> <b>impairment.</b> In order to do so, a mixed methods design was employed, involving three related studies; a systematic {{review of the literature}} about knowledge and understanding of mild <b>cognitive</b> <b>impairment</b> (MCI), a questionnaire study exploring respondents’ knowledge and understanding of <b>cognitive</b> <b>impairment,</b> and an interview study building on the results of the questionnaire and exploring perceptions of <b>cognitive</b> <b>impairment</b> in-depth. 	The systematic review included 30 studies; 20 qualitative articles and 10 survey studies. The questionnaire study received 417 responses predominantly from England, but including some international responses. Questionnaire respondents were drawn from six population groups: people living with <b>cognitive</b> <b>impairment,</b> care partners, younger adults, older adults, healthcare professionals, and dementia specialists. Twenty-one semi-structured interviews were conducted with representatives from each of these six participant groups. 	The findings from these studies suggest that most participants were able to offer a definition of <b>cognitive</b> <b>impairment,</b> highlighting similar symptoms (focusing on memory problems) and causes (such as brain damage and ageing). Participants discussed <b>cognitive</b> <b>impairment</b> in the context of dementia and were uncertain as to whether the two were synonymous or different. Where participants felt that <b>cognitive</b> <b>impairment</b> and dementia were different, they were unable to articulate these differences suggesting that the boundaries between <b>cognitive</b> <b>impairment</b> and dementia are not clear to the wider population. Participants offered causation accounts and narratives which suggested both controllable and uncontrollable factors {{may play a role in}} cognitive health, but participants generally claimed that <b>cognitive</b> <b>impairment</b> was beyond an individual’s personal sphere of control. 	Participants identified that professionals and the lay population used different language and labels when discussing <b>cognitive</b> <b>impairment</b> and most felt that MCI was not an acceptable or appropriate label. The use of the word memory in diagnostic services for <b>cognitive</b> <b>impairment</b> and dementia (such as memory clinic, memory assessment service) is challenged as this may contribute to the perception that <b>cognitive</b> <b>impairment</b> and dementia are conditions which are solely or primarily characterised by a memory impairment. 	The results of the studies inform the development of an illness representation model of <b>cognitive</b> <b>impairment,</b> providing a framework on which to base future information resources, media messages and public health and awareness campaigns. This thesis has begun to address a key gap in the literature, considering the views of {{a range of}} populations about <b>cognitive</b> <b>impairment.</b> However, future research is needed to explore factors which influence perspectives about <b>cognitive</b> <b>impairment</b> and to consider whether these perspectives change over time and can be influenced by educational campaigns and information...|$|R
25|$|In 2017, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention {{stated that}} {{speaking}} with a therapist may help.

25|$|In 2008, S Heim et al. {{was one of}} {{the first}} studies not to just compare {{dyslexic}}s with a non dyslexic control, but to go further and compare the different cognitive sub groups with a non dyslexic control group. Different theories conceptualise dyslexia as either a phonological, attentional, auditory, magnocellular, or automatisation deficit. Such heterogeneity suggests the existence of yet unrecognised subtypes of dyslexics suffering from distinguishable deficits. The purpose of the study was to identify cognitive subtypes of dyslexia. Out of 642 children screened for reading ability 49 dyslexics and 48 controls were tested for phonological awareness, auditory discrimination, motion detection, visual attention, and rhythm imitation. A combined cluster and discriminant analysis approach revealed three clusters of dyslexics with different cognitive deficits. Compared to reading-unimpaired children cluster no. 1 had worse phonological awareness; cluster no. 2 had higher attentional costs; cluster no. 3 performed worse in the phonological, auditory, and magnocellular tasks. These results indicate that dyslexia may result from distinct <b>cognitive</b> <b>impairments.</b> As a consequence, prevention and remediation programmes should be specifically targeted for the individual child's deficit pattern.|$|E
25|$|Individual {{factors of}} {{potential}} importance are genetic factors, prior radiation exposure, and previous head injury, such as concussion. Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) {{has been shown}} to be an important and common factor in CNS responses. ApoE controls the redistribution of lipids among cells and is expressed at high levels in the brain. New studies are considering the effects of space radiation for the major isoforms of ApoE, which are encoded by distinct alleles (ε2, ε3, and ε4). The isoform ApoE ε4 {{has been shown to}} increase the risk of <b>cognitive</b> <b>impairments</b> and to lower the age for Alzheimer’s disease. It is not known whether the interaction of radiation sensitivity or other individual risks factors is the same for high- and low-LET radiation. Other isoforms of ApoE confer a higher risk for other diseases. People who carry at least one copy of the ApoE ε4 allele are at increased risk for atherosclerosis, which is also suspected to be a risk increased by radiation. People who carry two copies of the ApoE ε2 allele are at risk for a condition that is known as hyperlipoproteinemia type III. It will therefore be extremely challenging to consider genetic factors in a multipleradiation-risk paradigm.|$|E
