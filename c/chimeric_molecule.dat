Expression of this <b>chimeric</b> <b>molecule</b> in ouabain resistant mouse L cells was assured by the high-affinity binding of [3 H]ouabain. In the presence of Ca 2 +/calmodulin, this <b>chimeric</b> <b>molecule</b> exhibited ouabain inhibitable Na+,K(+) -ATPase activity; the putative chimeric ATPase activity was absent in the absence of Ca 2 +/calmodulin and activated by Ca 2 +/calmodulin in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, this <b>chimeric</b> <b>molecule</b> could bind monoclonal IgG 5 specific to the chicken Na+,K(+) -ATPase alpha 1 subunit only in the presence of Ca 2 +/calmodulin, suggesting that the epitope for IgG 5 in this chimera is masked in the absence of Ca 2 +/calmodulin and uncovered in their presence. These results propose a direct interaction between the calmodulin binding auto-inhibitory domain of the PM Ca(2 +) -ATPase and the specific regions of the Na+,K(+) -ATPase alpha 1 subunit that are structurally homologous to the PM Ca(2 +) -ATPase.

40|$|The {{cytoskeleton}} plays {{a critical}} role in regulating mitochondria distribution. Similar to axonal mitochondria, the fission yeast mitochondria are distributed by the microtubule cytoskeleton, but this is regulated by a motor-independent mechanism depending on the microtubule associated protein mmb 1 p as the absence of mmb 1 p causes mitochondria aggregation. In this study, using a series of chimeric proteins to control the subcellular localization and motility of mitochondria, we show that a <b>chimeric</b> <b>molecule</b> containing a microtubule binding domain and the mitochondria outer membrane protein tom 22 p can restore the normal interconnected mitochondria network in mmb 1 -deletion (mmb 1 ∆) cells. In contrast, increasing the motility of mitochondria by using a <b>chimeric</b> <b>molecule</b> containing a kinesin motor domain and tom 22 p cannot rescue mitochondria aggregation defects in mmb 1 ∆ cells. Intriguingly a <b>chimeric</b> <b>molecule</b> carrying an actin binding domain and tom 22 p results in mitochondria associated with actin filaments at the actomyosin ring during mitosis, leading to cytokinesis defects. These findings suggest that the passive motor-independent microtubule-based mechanism is the major contributor to mitochondria distribution in wild type fission yeast cells. Hence, we establish that attachment to microtubules, but not kinesin-dependent movement and the actin cytoskeleton, is required and crucial for proper mitochondria distribution in fission yeast. published_or_final_versio...|$|E

40|$|A {{complete}} set of chimeras was made between the lysosomal membrane glycoprotein LEP 100 and the plasma membrane-directed vesicular stomatitis virus G protein, combining a glycosylated lumenal or ectodomain, a single transmembrane domain, and a cytosolic carboxyl- terminal domain. These chimeras, the parent molecules, and a truncated form of LEP 100 lacking the transmembrane and cytosolic domains were expressed in mouse L cells. Only LEP 100 and chimeras that included the cytosolic 11 amino acid carboxyl terminus of LEP 100 were targeted to lysosomes. The other chimeras accumulated in the plasma membrane, and truncated LEP 100 was secreted. Chimeras that included the extracellular domain of vesicular stomatitis G protein and the carboxyl terminus of LEP 100 were targeted to lysosomes and very rapidly degraded. Therefore, in chimera-expressing cells, virtually all the <b>chimeric</b> <b>molecules</b> were newly synthesized and still in the biosynthesis and lysosomal targeting pathways. The behavior {{of one of these}} chimeras was studied in detail. After its processing in the Golgi apparatus, the chimera entered the plasma membrane/endosome compartment and rapidly cycled between the plasma membrane and endosomes before going to lysosomes. In pulse- expression experiments, a large population of <b>chimeric</b> <b>molecules</b> was observed to appear transiently in the plasma membrane by immunofluorescence microscopy. Soon after protein synthesis was inhibited, this surface population disappeared. When lysosomal proteolysis was inhibited, <b>chimeric</b> <b>molecules</b> accumulated in lysosomes. These data suggest that the plasma membrane/early endosome compartment is on the pathway to the lysosomal membrane. This explains why mutations that block endocytosis result in the accumulation of lysosomal membrane proteins in the plasma membrane...|$|R

To quantify the frequency of <b>chimeric</b> <b>molecule</b> formation, mixed genomic DNAs from eight actinomycete species whose 16 S rRNA sequences had been determined were used for PCR coamplification of 16 S rRNA genes. A large number of cloned 16 S ribosomal DNAs were examined by sequence analysis, and chimeric molecules were identified by multiple-sequence alignment with reference species. Here, we report that the level of occurrence of chimeric sequences after 30 cycles of PCR amplification was 32 %. We also show that PCR-induced chimeras were formed between different rRNA gene copies from the same organism.

To define structural features of the MHC molecule important for such species-specific recognition, HLA-A 2 (A 2) -specific murine CTL were examined for their recognition of transfected cell lines expressing the class I molecules A 2 or A 2 /H- 2 Kb(A 2 /Kb). A 2 /Kb is a <b>chimeric</b> <b>molecule</b> consisting of the alpha 1 and alpha 2 domains of A 2 and the alpha 3, transmembrane, and cytoplasmic regions of Kb. The majority of CTL clones showed enhanced recognition of transfected cell lines expressing this <b>chimeric</b> <b>molecule.</b> Enhanced recognition was shown to correlate with sensitivity of the CTL clones to inhibition by anti-CD 8 antibody. These results suggested that CD 8 may interact with class I in a species- specific manner, and that suboptimal CD 8 interaction with the alpha 3 domain of xenogeneic molecules {{may be an important}} contribution to poor xenoreactivity.

In this study, a <b>chimeric</b> <b>molecule</b> containing the myristylation sequence of Src and the intracellular portion of CD 45, previously shown to restore function in CD 45 - T cells, was mutagenized to determine if membrane-associated CD 45 tyrosine phosphatase activity is required to restore TCR-mediated signaling in CD 45 - T cells. Abolition of enzymatic activity by substitution of a serine for a critical cysteine in the first catalytic domain resulted in failure of this molecule to restore TCR signaling. Another mutation, in which a single amino acid substitution destroyed the myristylation site, resulted in failure of the <b>chimeric</b> <b>molecule</b> to partition to the plasma membrane. Although expressed at high levels and enzymatically active, this form of intracellular CD 45 also failed to restore normal signaling in CD 45 - T cells.

In the present work we report the construction of a human IgG 1 chimeric variant of IOR-T 3, named T 3 q. In order to reduce the T-cell activating capacity of the newly obtained <b>chimeric</b> <b>molecule,</b> the two leucine residues at positions 234 and 235 of the CH 2 region were replaced by alanines, obtaining the T 3 q(Ala/Ala) molecule. In vitro evaluation of T 3 q and T 3 q(Ala/Ala) showed that there were no differences in the recognition of human CD 3 in comparison with murine IOR-T 3. However, the Fc-mutated version T 3 q(Ala/Ala) displayed a much weaker FcgammaR binding capacity than the unmutated <b>chimeric</b> <b>molecule</b> T 3 q, as well as a reduced ability to induce T-cell proliferation, proinflammatory cytokine release (TNFalpha and IL- 6), and early activation surface marker expression (CD 25 and CD 69). We also found that, unlike treatment with T 3 q, the reduction in T-cell proliferation was less marked on CD 8 (+) cells compared to the CD 4 (+) cells after treatment with T 3 q(Ala/Ala).

40|$|One step in {{the process}} of herpes simplex virus (HSV) entry into cells is the binding of viral {{glycoprotein}} D (gD) to a cellular receptor. Human nectin- 2 (also known as HveB and Prr 2), a member of the immunoglobulin (Ig) superfamily, serves as a gD receptor for the entry of HSV- 2, variant forms of HSV- 1 that have amino acid substitutions at position 25 or 27 of gD (for example, HSV- 1 /Rid), and porcine pseudorabies virus (PRV). The gD binding region of nectin- 2 is believed to be localized to the N-terminal variable-like (V) Ig domain. In order to identify specific amino acid sequences in nectin- 2 that are important for HSV entry activity, <b>chimeric</b> <b>molecules</b> were constructed by exchange of sequences between human nectin- 2 and its mouse homolog, mouse nectin- 2, which mediates entry of PRV but not HSV- 1 or HSV- 2. The nectin- 2 <b>chimeric</b> <b>molecules</b> were expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells, which normally lack a gD receptor, and tested for cell surface expression and viral entry activity. As expected, <b>chimeric</b> <b>molecules</b> containing the V domain of human nectin- 2 exhibited HSV entry activity. Replacement of either of two small regions in the V domain of mouse nectin- 2 with amino acids from the equivalent positions in human nectin- 2 (amino acids 75 to 81 or 89) transferred HSV- 1 /Rid entry activity to mouse nectin- 2. The resulting chimeras also exhibited enhanced HSV- 2 entry activity and gained the ability to mediate wild-type HSV- 1 entry. Replacement of amino acid 89 of human nectin- 2 with the corresponding mouse amino acid (M 89 F) eliminated HSV entry activity. These results identify two different amino acid sequences, predicted to lie adjacent to the C′ and C" beta-strands of the V domain, that are critical for HSV entry activity. This region is homologous to the human immunodeficiency virus binding region of CD 4 and to the poliovirus binding region of CD 155...|$|R

In addition to MHC class I and II antigens, intestinal epithelia constitutively express the nonclassical MHC molecule CD 1 d, a transmembrane molecule with a short cytoplasmic tail expressed as a β 2 -microglobulin-associated 48 -kDa glycoprotein and novel β 2 -microglobulin-independent 37 -kDa nonglycosylated protein on intestinal epithelia. At present, it is not known whether extracellular ligands can signal intestinal epithelial CD 1 d. To define signaling of CD 1 d cytoplasmic tail, retrovirus-mediated gene transfer was used to generate stable cell lines expressing wild-type CD 1 d or a <b>chimeric</b> <b>molecule</b> (extracellular CD 1 d and cytoplasmic CD 1 a), and surface CD 1 d was triggered by antibody crosslinking. Although wild-type CD 1 d was readily activated (tyrosine phosphorylation), no demonstrable signal was evident in cell lines expressing the <b>chimeric</b> <b>molecule.</b> Subsequent studies revealed that anti-CD 1 d crosslinking specifically induces epithelial IL- 10 mRNA and protein and is blocked by the tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein. Further studies addressing epithelial-derived IL- 10 revealed that anti-CD 1 d crosslinking attenuates IFN-γ signaling and that such attenuation is reversed by addition of functionally inhibitory IL- 10 antibodies. These results define signaling through surface CD 1 d, and, importantly, they demonstrate that this pathway may serve to dampen epithelial proinflammatory signals...|$|E

Thus far most of the reported anti-HIV dual-function vectors express different effector RNAs as a <b>chimeric</b> <b>molecule.</b> In our study involving retroviral vectors coexpressing a U 5 ribozyme and either an anti-tat or anti-rev antisense RNA, chimeric vectors exhibit poor potency in several important functional aspects, including inhibition of HIV replication, protection against cytopathic effects, and suppression of target gene function. Surprisingly, such a poor efficacy of chimeric vector function {{was not associated with}} a lower level of effector RNA expression. These results indicate that expression of two effector RNAs as a <b>chimeric</b> <b>molecule</b> can lead to interference, reducing their global biological effects. More importantly, we have demonstrated that such interference can be avoided by coexpressing these effector RNAs as separate molecules through a new dual-function vector, called a dual-effector cassette (Dec) vector, developed in this study. We also define some of the design alterations that might affect the efficacy of the Dec vector and demonstrate that forward-designed Dec vectors are more efficacious than reverse-designed Dec vectors, which express a lower level of effector RNA owing to the instability of the 5 ' effector cassettes in the provirus. We believe that the principle of Dec vector design may also be applicable for the coexpression of other therapeutic RNA effectors in many gene therapy applications.

To test this hypothesis we used a system developed for E-cadherin that, when transfected into L cells (mouse fibroblasts), {{has been shown to}} cause aggregation. Because this aggregation requires the cytoplasmic domain of E-cadherin to bind to catenins, we made a chimeric cDNA construct that encodes the extracellular domain of pemphigus vulgaris antigen and the cytoplasmic domain of E-cadherin. Analysis by immunofluorescence and flow cytometry with pemphigus vulgaris sera indicated that the pemphigus vulgaris antigen extracellular domain of this <b>chimeric</b> <b>molecule</b> (PVEC) was expressed on the cell surface of transiently transfected cells and permanently transfected L-cell clones.

40|$|In Drosophila the {{function}} of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor is modulated zygotically by three EGF-like proteins: Spitz (Spi), which is a potent activator; Vein (Vn), which is a moderate activator; and Argos (Aos), which is an inhibitor. <b>Chimeric</b> <b>molecules</b> were constructed in which the EGF domain of Vn was swapped with the EGF domain from each factor. The modified Vn proteins behaved both in vitro and in vivo with properties characteristic of the factor from which the EGF domain was derived. These results demonstrate that the EGF domain is the key determinant that gives DER inhibitors and activators their distinct properties...|$|R
40|$|The role of clathrin in {{intracellular}} sorting {{was investigated}} by {{expression of a}} dominant-negative mutant form of clathrin, termed the hub fragment. Hub inhibition of clathrin-mediated membrane transport was established by demonstrating a block of transferrin internalization and an alteration in the intracellular dis-tribution of the cation-independent mannose- 6 -phos-phate receptor. Hubs {{had no effect on}} uptake of FITC-dextran, adaptor distribution, organelle integrity in the secretory pathway, or cell surface expression of consti-tutively secreted molecules. Hub expression blocked ly-sosomal delivery of <b>chimeric</b> <b>molecules</b> containing ei-ther the tyrosine-based sorting signal of H 2 M or the dileucine-based sorting signal of CD...|$|R
40|$|Primary {{systemic}} vasculitis {{is associated with}} a high mortality if left untreated and it is essential to make the diagnosis before permanent organ damage has occurred. In this thesis the diagnostic and prognostic significance of anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA) in {{systemic vasculitis}} is investigated. The clinical significance of a capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) based on the monoclonal antibody 4 A 3 for detection of antibodies against proteinase 3 (PR 3 -ANCA) was evaluated and found to have a high sensitivity and specificity. It was shown that patients with high levels of PR 3 -ANCA as measured by the capture ELISA have a poorer survival and worse renal outcome and are more prone to relapse. In comparison the symptoms, signs and clinical course of a cohort of patients with vasculitis but without ANCA, with the diagnosis of polyarteritis nodosa, were described. Recombinant <b>chimeric</b> <b>molecules</b> were produced in order to map epitopes of monoclonal antibodies to PR 3. The clinical utility of these chimeric proteins in the diagnosis and follow-up of patients with PR 3 -ANCA positive vasculitis was studied and these <b>chimeric</b> <b>molecules</b> were not found to be better than capture ELISA using native PR 3. It was observed that samples from the same patient during one exacerbation episode always exhibited a similar pattern of reactivity and that some patients exhibited the same pattern at diagnosis and subsequent flares, while in many patients the pattern changed considerably over time indicating epitope shift during the course of disease...|$|R
