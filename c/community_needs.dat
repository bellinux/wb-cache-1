The InterGreek Council is the self-governing student organization that provides guidelines and support to its member organizations {{within each of the}} three councils at Columbia, the Interfraternity Council, Panhellenic Council, and Multicultural Greek Council. The three council presidents bring their affiliated chapters together once a month to meet as one Greek community.

The findings suggested significant group differences. Although there was no significant main effect for motivation to help as a personal need (extrinsic motivation) across the generations, an examination of the social and <b>community</b> <b>need</b> (intrinsic motivation) indicated that generation X considered social and <b>community</b> <b>need</b> more important than Generation Y. <br /...|$|R

The Church sent missionaries, who were directed from the new cathedral in Tunisia, south across the Sahara to what became Francophone Black Africa where many mission communities were established.

Protectorate projects enlisted civil engineers and city planners who developed designs from which were built many public improvements.

25|$|For forest managers, {{sustainably}} {{managing a}} particular forest tract means determining, in a tangible way, {{how to use}} it today to ensure similar benefits, health and productivity in the future. Forest managers must assess and integrate a wide array of sometimes conflicting factors – commercial and non-commercial values, environmental considerations, <b>community</b> <b>needs,</b> even global impact – to produce sound forest plans. In most cases, forest managers develop their forest plans in consultation with citizens, businesses, organizations and other interested parties in and around the forest tract being managed.

25|$|This trend can be {{explained}} by overall low financial incentives for health care personnel, especially for work in remote areas. The average monthly salary for a general practitioner in Nicaragua under MINSA is $544 USD while that of Honduras is $1,332 USD and that of Panama is $1,025 USD. Additionally, although 52% of Nicaraguan doctors are specialized in training, this specialization level fails to meet widespread <b>community</b> <b>needs</b> for primary care. In order to improve the healthcare access of those living in more isolated areas, the public medical schools in Nicaragua require their graduates to perform two years of social service in high-need settings, after which they can opt to work in private institutions. This requirement aligns with MINSA's objective to encourage these graduates to work for the public health sector.|$|E
25|$|Collaborative {{planning}} {{arose in}} the US {{in response to the}} inadequacy of traditional public participation techniques to provide real opportunities for the public to make decisions affecting their communities. Collaborative planning is a method designed to empower stakeholders by elevating them to the level of decision-makers through direct engagement and dialogue between stakeholders and public agencies, to solicit ideas, active involvement, and participation in the community planning process. Active public involvement can help planners achieve better outcomes by making them aware of the public’s needs and preferences and by using local knowledge to inform projects. When properly administered, collaboration can result in more meaningful participation and better, more creative outcomes to persistent problems than can traditional participation methods. It enables planners to make decisions that reflect <b>community</b> <b>needs</b> and values, it fosters faith in the wisdom and utility of the resulting project, and the community is given a personal stake in its success.|$|E
25|$|In any {{community}} of scientists, Kuhn states, {{there are some}} individuals who are bolder than most. These scientists, judging that a crisis exists, embark on what Kuhn calls revolutionary science, exploring alternatives to long-held, obvious-seeming assumptions. Occasionally this generates a rival to the established framework of thought. The new candidate paradigm will appear {{to be accompanied by}} numerous anomalies, partly because it is still so new and incomplete. The majority of the scientific community will oppose any conceptual change, and, Kuhn emphasizes, so they should. To fulfill its potential, a scientific <b>community</b> <b>needs</b> to contain both individuals who are bold and individuals who are conservative. There are many examples in the history of science in which confidence in the established frame of thought was eventually vindicated. It is almost impossible to predict whether the anomalies in a candidate for a new paradigm will eventually be resolved. Those scientists who possess an exceptional ability to recognize a theory's potential will be the first whose preference is likely to shift in favour of the challenging paradigm. There typically follows a period in which there are adherents of both paradigms. In time, if the challenging paradigm is solidified and unified, it will replace the old paradigm, and a paradigm shift will have occurred.|$|E

500|$|On {{the day of}} Isabel {{moving through}} the state, President George W. Bush {{declared}} 18 counties and 14 independent cities as disaster areas, making residents and business-owners there eligible for federal funding. Additionally, funds were allocated {{for state and local}} governments in the 31 designated jurisdictions to pay 75% of the eligible cost for debris removal and emergency services related to the hurricane, including requested emergency work undertaken by the federal government. Many other jurisdictions were added, based on subsequent damage reports, and by September 22, 99 jurisdictions were eligible for disaster assistance. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) provided hurricane-related bulletins, including safety tips and the method for removing hazardous materials. By 12days after the passage of the hurricane, FEMA distributed more than 6.3million lbs. (2.9million kg) of ice and [...] of water to areas affected by Isabel. Disaster Recovery Centers, which contain information on the aftermath process, were opened in eight locations and received more than 1,850 inquiries. More than 350 FEMA inspectors visited homes to verify damages caused by Isabel, {{and by the end of}} September 2003 about 12,000 inspections were completed. In response to the power outages, FEMA installed 28 generators at disaster-affected critical public facilities to support life-sustaining <b>community</b> <b>needs.</b> By about four months after the hurricane, 93,139 individuals in the designated areas applied for disaster assistance, while 20,417people visited Disaster Recovery Centers throughout the state. The Small Business Administration approved more than 3,000 low-interest disaster loans from homes and businesses, with the value of the loans totaling $74million (2003USD; $87million 2008USD). The government provided $105million (2003USD; $123million 2008USD) for debris removal, emergency protective services, and permanent work, and approved about $25.9million (2003USD; $30.3million 2008USD) for life-sustaining needs such as water, ice, and generators at critical public facilities. Monetary assistance for temporary rental assistance and minimal home repairs totaled $32million (2003USD; $37million 2008USD), as well.|$|E
