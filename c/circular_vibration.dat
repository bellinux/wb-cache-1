The glass lenses are moulded by press moulding with micro ceramics moulds made of tungsten carbides (WC). In this paper, a new Vibration Assisted Polishing (VAP) method is proposed and developed by using <b>circular</b> <b>vibration</b> of the magnetostrictive vibrating polisher. The polisher is composed of a magnetostrictive vibrator and a small polishing tool, and the small polishing tool is mounted {{on the head of}} the magnetostrictive vibrator. The concrete design of the magnetostrictive vibrating polisher is assisted by the finite element method (FEM) and through vibration mode analysis, the 4 th mode is selected. It generates a <b>circular</b> <b>vibration</b> trace at a frequency of 9. 2 kHz with a radius of 30 µm. The polisher is fixed in a 5 -axis (X, Y, Z, B and C) controlled polishing system. Through some fundamental polishing experiments, the shapes of the removal function is acquired and surface roughness is reduced to 9 nm Rz (1 nm Ra) ...|$|E
40|$|International audienceAIM: To compare muscle {{activity}} of lower limb muscles between dual mode whole-body vibration (WBV) and the commonly used side-alternating mode. METHODS: Thirty physically active volunteers performed static squats at a knee angle of 60 ° (0 °: knee fully extended) on the WBV platform while surface electromyography (sEMG) was measured of the vastus lateralis (VL), the biceps femoris (BF), and the soleus (SOL). The side-alternating WBV trial was induced at a frequency of 6 Hz and an amplitude (displacement from baseline to peak) of 2. 5 mm. Dual mode WBV consisted of side-alternating vibration with additional <b>circular</b> <b>vibration</b> in the horizontal plane with frequencies of 14 Hz and 43 Hz. Root mean {{square of the}} sEMG signals (sEMGRMS) was calculated after withdrawal of the excessive spikes in the sEMG spectrum via linear interpolation. Then, sEMGRMS was normalized to the sEMGRMS during maximal voluntary contractions (MVCs). Finally, sEMGRMS during a control trial without vibration was subtracted from the trials with WBV in order to isolate the increase in muscle activity due to the vibration. RESULTS: Increase in sEMGRMS of the VL and BF was significantly greater during dual mode compared to side-alternating WBV when the dual mode trial consisted of the high circular frequency (43 Hz, P < 0. 01, Figure 1). In the SOL, the dual mode enhanced muscle activity significantly compared to the side-alternating mode for both <b>circular</b> <b>vibration</b> frequencies (14 Hz, 43 Hz, P < 0. 01, Figure 1). CONCLUSION: Dual mode WBV resulted in significantly higher muscle activity in select lower limb muscles than the commonly used side-alternating mode. Therefore, {{it is recommended that}} dual mode platforms be considered for future WBV protocols in order to optimize the training stimulus in the lower limbs...|$|E

In this new approach, metal objects are melted with a mobile laser beam while they are being rotated. A <b>vibration</b> generator provides <b>circular</b> <b>vibrations</b> with an amplitude of 3 mm, and the vibration plane is perpendicular to the moving laser beam. The melting tests were performed using flat carbon steel samples at a predetermined frequency of <b>circular</b> <b>vibrations.</b> The effects of laser power and laser beam scanning velocity on the melted shapes were studied. All laser melting procedures were performed at a vibration frequency of 105 Hz. The melted samples were subjected to microscopic evaluation and the Ra parameter, which characterises mean roughness, was measured using a profilometer. Melting metal samples with physically smooth surfaces (Ra = 0. 21 µm) resulted in surface structures of varied roughness values, with Ra ranging from 5 µm to approximately 58 µm.

Also, the static eccentricity between the rotating and non-rotating test seal parts is easily adjustable to desired values. By accurately measuring both dynamic radial displacement and dynamic radial force signals, over a wide range of circular orbit frequency, one is able to solve for the full linear-anisotropic model's 12 coefficients rather than the 6 coefficients of the more restrictive isotropic linear model. Of course, one may also impose the isotropic assumption in reducing test data, thereby providing a valid qualification of which seal configurations are well represented by the isotropic model and which are not. In fact, as argued in reference (1), the requirement for maintaining a symmetric total system mass matrix means that the resulting isotropic model needs 5 coefficients and the anisotropic model needs 11 coefficients...|$|E

By applying a <b>circular</b> <b>vibration</b> to a micropillar array spiral pattern, a whirling flow is induced around the micropillars, and target cells are transported towards the single cell catcher placed {{at the center of}} the spiral. The single cell catcher is composed of a single-cell-sized hole pattern of thermo-responsive gel. The gel swells at low temperatures (≲ 32 ◦C) and shrinks at high temperatures (≳ 32 ◦C), therefore, its volume expansion can be controlled by an integrated microheater. When the microheater is turned on, a single cell is trapped by the hole pattern of the single cell catcher. Then, when the microheater is turned off, the single cell catcher is cooled by the ambient temperature. The gel swells at this temperature, and the hole closes to catch the single cell.

In the stratification of density media (gases, liquids, etc.) and under certain external conditions convective movement caused by Archimedean force can arise.

40|$|A general {{approach}} is presented for solving the free vibration of solid and hollow circular cylinders. The analysis procedure {{is based on}} the small-strain, linear and exact elasticity theory. By taking the Chebyshev polynomial series multiplied by a boundary function to satisfy the geometric boundary conditions as the admissible functions, the Ritz method is applied to derive the frequency equation of the cylinder. According to the axisymmetric geometrical property of a <b>circular</b> cylinder, the <b>vibration</b> modes are divided into three distinct categories: axisymmetric vibration, torsional vibration and circumferential vibration. Moreover, for a cylinder with the same boundary conditions at the two ends, the vibration modes can be further divided into antisymmetric and symmetric ones in the length direction. Convergence and comparison studies demonstrate the high accuracy and small computational cost of the present method. A significant advantage over other Ritz solutions is that the present method can guarantee stable numerical operation even when a large number of terms of admissible functions are used. Not only the lower-order but also the higher-order frequencies can be obtained by using a few terms of the Chebyshev polynomials.

Both of these vibration modes can be written in terms of spherical harmonics of degree n. The frequency equation for the toroidal modes is obtained analytically, and it depends on both n and β [= (Cn - C 12) /(2 C 44) ], where C 11, C 12, and C 44 have the usual meaning of moduli and are defined in Eqs.

The WBV trials included two side-alternating trials (Side-L: 6 Hz, 2. 5 mm; Side-H: 16 Hz, 4 mm), two circular trials (Circ-L: 14 Hz, 0. 8 mm; Circ-H: 43 Hz, 0. 8 mm), and four dual mode trials that were the combinations of the single mode trials (Side-L/Circ-L, Side-L/Circ-H, Side-H/Circ-L, Side-H/Circ-H). Further, control trials without vibration were assessed, and 3 D platform acceleration was quantified during the vibration. Significant increases in the root mean square of the sEMG (sEMGRMS) compared to the control trial were found in most muscles for Side-L/Circ-H (+ 17 to + 63 %, P < 0. 05), Side-H/Circ-L (+ 7 to + 227 %, P < 0. 05), and Side-H/Circ-H (+ 21 to + 207 %, P < 0. 01), and in the lower leg muscles for Side-H (+ 35 to + 138 %, P < 0. 05).
