40|$|This thesis {{proposes a}} hybrid {{approach}} for efficiently handling both best-effort and streaming traffic while enhancing {{performance in a}} Network-on-Chip “NoC”. The hybrid approach consists in separately handling each type of traffic using the appropriate, suitable and specialized switching technique while introducing mechanisms for improving performances. Three hybrid router architectures are then proposed and are summarized as follows. A SDM-Based hybrid router architecture in which, a packet-switching technique is used to handle the best-effort traffic while the <b>circuit-switching</b> technique is used to handle the streaming traffic. Since <b>circuit-switching</b> technique often leads to poor utilization of communication resources, the Spatial Division Multiplexing ”SDM" technique is introduced in the <b>circuit-switching</b> technique in order to mitigate the poor utilization of communication resources by increasing router path diversity while the packet-switching is kept as simple as possible. A SDM-TDM Based hybrid router architecture which, while {{taking advantage of the}} hybrid approach implemented in the SDM-based hybrid router, introduces the temporal dimension by associating Spatial Division Multiplexing with Time Division Multiplexing “TDM” in order to share, in the <b>circuit-switching</b> technique, communication resources among multiple streaming data flows. Combining SDM and TDM techniques allows the highest number of available channels in the <b>circuit-switching.</b> Furthermore, this is an efficient and simple solution to overcome limitations in TDM-based NoCs due to time slot scheduling constraints. A CDM-Based hybrid router with CDM-TDM based bus which takes advantage of both NoC and Bus architectures. The CDM-based router also benefits from the hybrid approach; however the <b>circuit-switching</b> technique is Code Division Multiplexing “CDM”-Based, and allowing communication resources to be simultaneously accessed by several streaming data flow. The bus architecture combines CDM and TDM techniques in order to benefit from simultaneous channel access while sharing resources over time. Finally, the SDM and SDM-TDM based hybrid routers are used to build any size of 2 D Mesh NoC. The resulting NoCs are used as interconnection infrastructures in a Multiprocessor System-on-Chip “MPSoC” platform. (FSA 3) [...] UCL, 201...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Multimedia {{requirements}} of the 1990 ’s drove wired and optical network architects to reconsider the inefficiencies of packet switching and consider long proven methods such as <b>circuit-switching</b> to implement traffic engineering {{in order to reduce}} end-to-end delay. This resulted in the development of Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) and Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) technologies. Because both are mature and proven technologies for wired and optical network architectures, much research has been done to apply these methods to wireless mesh networks. But optimal performance improvement eludes wireless mesh network designers because of differences between the wired/optical and wireless environments in the provision of non-interfering unidirectional internodal links and lack of a wireless circuit switch. We propose a wireless mesh networking architecture that will provide low-latency and potentially higher throughput, based upon the availability of multiple channels, a <b>circuit-switch</b> implemented at the physical layer, and a reserva-tion protocol that will assign channels to provide non-interfering unidirectional internodal links.
