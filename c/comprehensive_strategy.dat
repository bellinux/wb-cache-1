Under the mayorship of Marc Ravalomanana (1998–2001), street lights were installed or repaired throughout the city to improve night-time safety. He increased the number of police officers on the streets, leading to a drop in crime. , the city lacks a <b>comprehensive</b> <b>strategy</b> for reducing crime.

2500|$|The International Olympic Committee (IOC) {{recognizes that}} the Olympic Games demand {{tremendous}} environmental resources, activities, and construction projects that could be detrimental to a host city’s environment. In 1995, IOC President Juan Antonio Samaranch stated, “the International Olympic Committee is resolved {{to ensure that the}} environment becomes the third dimension of the organization of the Olympic Games, the first and second being sport and culture.” Acting on this statement, in 1996 the IOC added the ‘environment’ as a third pillar to its vision for Olympic games. The IOC requires cities bidding to host the Olympics to provide a <b>comprehensive</b> <b>strategy</b> to protect the environment in preparation for hosting, and following the conclusion of the Games. This initiative was most notably acted upon in 2000, when the “Green Olympics” effort was developed by the Beijing Organizing Committee for the Beijing Olympic Games. The Beijing 2008 Summer Olympics effort to host environmentally friendly games resulted in over 160 projects meeting the goal of “green” games through improved air quality and water quality, implementation of sustainable energy sources, improved waste management, and environmental education. These projects included industrial plant relocation or closure, furnace replacement, introduction of new emission standards, and more strict traffic control. [...] Most of these measures were adopted on a temporary basis, and although real improvements were realized (particularly in air quality), most of these improvements had disappeared one year following the Games. [...] Although these improvements were short lived, IOC’s inclusion of environmental policies in evaluating and selecting host cities demonstrates a corporate responsibility that may be built upon in years to come. Detailed frameworks for environmental sustainability have been released for the 2018 Winter Olympics, and 2020 Summer Olympics in PyeongChang, South Korea, and Tokyo, Japan, respectively.|$|E
