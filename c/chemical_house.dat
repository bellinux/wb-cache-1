50|$|The {{residential}} areas of Katwe {{have been a}} slum, right from when human habitation started to appear along the railway tracks leading from Kampala to Kasese {{in the first half}} of the 20th century.

Quality Chemical Industries Limited, a Ugandan pharmaceutical manufacturer has its head office at Quality <b>Chemicals</b> <b>House,</b> in Katwe. Equity Bank maintains its headquarters in the area, having acquired Uganda Microfinance Limited which had established its headquarters there in August 2007.

50|$|The {{building}} {{was constructed in}} 1929-30 by John Mowlem & Co on riverside land cleared after the disastrous 1928 Thames flood severely damaged run-down residential properties. It was built to designs by Sir Frank Baines, of the Government's Office of Works. It is of design uniform with but not identical to Imperial <b>Chemical</b> <b>House</b> which is opposite it {{on the north side}} of Horseferry Road; while Imperial <b>Chemical</b> <b>House</b> was exclusively for ICI, Thames House originally had various uses, including the London headquarters of International Nickel Ltd. Baines's design owes much to the 'Imperial Neoclassical' tradition of Sir Edwin Lutyens and deliberately ties in with the Imperial design of Lambeth Bridge when it was redesigned from 1929. High up on the frontage are statues of St George and Britannia sculpted by Charles Sargeant Jagger. It was owned by Thames House Estates until it was sold to the British Government in 1994. Thames House Estates was jointly owned by ICI and Prudential for many years and subsequently was wholly owned by ICI.|$|E

Thames House, the next building south along Millbank, across Horseferry Road, was also designed by Baines and constructed at the same time.|$|E

5000|$|The {{damage caused}} by the flood took several years to repair.

They were replaced with modern office blocks and apartment buildings. Imperial <b>Chemical</b> <b>House</b> (designed by Sir Frank Baines, the Principal Architect of the Government's Office of Works), was one of the new buildings constructed in the area in 1927-29. The current headquarters of MI5, Thames House, was built to a very similar (though not identical) design in 1929-1930 {{on the other side of}} Horseferry Road, with the two buildings forming a landmark pair of office blocks facing the river.|$|E
