5|$|Croatia's initial jersey was {{designed}} in 1990 by painter Miroslav Šutej, who also designed the nation's {{coat of arms}} (though the <b>chequered</b> pattern has been a symbol of Croatia for hundreds of years). Although slightly altered by manufacturer Lotto (the 1998 jersey was a white jersey with the chequers on the right side, like a flying flag) and Nike since its original release, the <b>chequered</b> motif was adopted {{as a symbol of}} national identity and similar designs are used by all Croatian national sports teams.|$|E
5|$|A {{total of}} 11 {{companies}} were ever granted licenses by the BBC to manufacture the model, {{a maximum of}} 3 at any given time. The product proved highly challenging to manufacture, {{if for no other}} reason than tight specifications and consistency of parts, and many of these companies would have a <b>chequered</b> corporate history. Audible differences could result from the mounting screws, grille fabric, or the origin of the wool.|$|E
5|$|A {{variety of}} Fritillaria species {{are used as}} early spring {{ornamental}} flowers. These vary from the large Fritillaria imperialis (crown imperial) available {{in a number of}} colours such as yellow or orange, to the relatively tiny species such as Fritillaria meleagris or Fritillaria uva-vulpis with their <b>chequered</b> patterns. Erythronium is less common but a popular cultivar is 'Pagoda' with its sulphur yellow flowers. Calochortus (mariposa lily) may be sold as a mixture or as cultivars.|$|E
5|$|There are benches in {{the main}} aisle and confessionals in the side aisles. The confessionals {{contained}} benches until {{the closure of the}} church in 1938. After its reconstruction, the left side was reserved for women, and the right for men. Both side aisles are separated from the main aisle by pillar files, consisting of four columns and two half columns. The columns and the roof are painted in white, and the walls in cream. The floor is constructed from light and dark grey marble slabs in a <b>chequered</b> pattern.|$|E
5|$|Cook and Jones {{continued}} to work through guest appearances and as session musicians. In 1980, they formed The Professionals, which lasted for two years. Jones went on {{to play with the}} bands <b>Chequered</b> Past and Neurotic Outsiders. He also recorded two solo albums, Mercy and Fire and Gasoline. Now a resident of Los Angeles, he hosts a daily radio program called Jonesy's Jukebox. Having played with the band Chiefs of Relief in the late 1980s and with Edwyn Collins in the 1990s, Cook is now a member of Man Raze. Following The Rich Kids' break-up in 1979, Matlock played with various bands, toured with Iggy Pop, and recorded several solo albums. He is currently a member of Slinky Vagabond.|$|E
5|$|In {{the third}} session on Saturday morning, Hamilton topped the {{timesheets}} once again, setting {{a time of}} 1:44.352, {{a quarter of a}} second clear of teammate Rosberg. Hülkenberg was third for Force India ahead of Ricciardo and Vettel. The session saw several incidents: Bottas damaged the floor of his car when he ran over a drain cover on his installation lap and was forced to miss the rest of the session; Felipe Massa made contact with the wall, but was later able to rejoin practice; Räikkönen's track time was limited as well due to a loss of power; and a red flag period occurred right after the <b>chequered</b> flag fell as Pérez crashed at turn 15.|$|E
5|$|Liverpool's {{first season}} was successful, as the club {{narrowly}} won the Lancashire League title on goal average, over Blackpool. They {{also won the}} Liverpool District Cup by defeating Everton. The subsequent theft of the league and cup trophies cost the club £130 to replace them. Following their success, Liverpool reapplied to the Football League. This application was successful, {{mainly because of the}} resignations of Accrington and Bootle from the Second Division. Liverpool's original strip had been blue and white <b>chequered</b> shirts and white shorts, similar to those of their neighbours Everton. From 1894 they changed to red shirts and white shorts.|$|E
5|$|The Madcap Laughs is {{the debut}} solo album by the English singer-songwriter Syd Barrett. It was {{recorded}} after Barrett had left Pink Floyd in April 1968. The album had a <b>chequered</b> recording history, with work beginning in mid-1968, but {{the bulk of}} the sessions taking place between April and July 1969, for which five different producers were credited − including Barrett, Peter Jenner (1968 sessions), Malcolm Jones (early-to-mid-1969 sessions), and fellow Pink Floyd members David Gilmour and Roger Waters (mid-1969 sessions). Among the guest musicians are Willie Wilson from (Gilmour's old band) Jokers Wild and Robert Wyatt of the band Soft Machine.|$|E
5|$|There were, however, {{continuing}} gradual economic improvements, {{among the}} most visible {{of which was the}} replacement of the traditional thatched blackhouse with accommodation of a more modern design and with the assistance of Highlands and Islands Enterprise many of the islands' populations have begun to increase after decades of decline. The discovery of substantial deposits of North Sea oil in 1965 and the renewables sector have contributed to a degree of economic stability in recent decades. For example, the Arnish yard has had a <b>chequered</b> history but has been a significant employer in both the oil and renewables industries.|$|E
5|$|After {{the release}} of the Lexus brand in the Japanese {{domestic}} market in 2005, Lexus sanctioned the entry of four SC 430 coupes in the Super GT series of the All Japan Grand Touring Car Championship in the GT500 class. In the first race of the 2006 series, an SC 430 took the <b>chequered</b> flag, and drivers André Lotterer and Juichi Wakisaka raced the SC 430 to capture the GT500 championship for that year. In 2007, another SC 430 won the GT500 opening round race. In 2006, Lexus raced a hybrid vehicle for the first time, entering a GS 450h performance hybrid sedan in partnership with Sigma Advanced Racing Development at the 24 Hours of Tokachi race in Hokkaido, Japan. Lexus Canada also entered the GS 450h in 2007's Targa Newfoundland event. In 2009, Lexus Super GT Team SC 430 and IS 350 racers won the GT500 and GT300 championships, respectively.|$|E
5|$|He sported one-off helmet designs four times. For the 1998 Japanese Grand Prix, a title decider with Mika Häkkinen, he {{replaced}} the German flag with a <b>chequered</b> flag motif and reflective silver replacing the white areas. At the 2004 Italian Grand Prix, the German flag design {{was replaced with}} an Italian flag in honour of his team's home race. For the Brazilian Grand Prix race of 2006 (at the time intended to be his final Grand Prix), he wore an all-red helmet that included the names of his ninety-one Grand Prix victories. For the 2011 Belgian Grand Prix, Schumacher's 20th anniversary in Formula One, he wore a commemorative gold-leafed helmet. The helmet, very similar to his current helmet, included the year of his début to the present, and the years of his seven World titles. For the 2012 Belgian Grand Prix, Schumacher's 300th Grand Prix appearance, he wore a special platinum-leafed helmet with a message of his achievement.|$|E
5|$|Lewis Hamilton {{topped the}} {{timesheets}} in second practice on Friday afternoon {{with a time}} of 1:37.583, using the super-soft compound. Earlier in the session, he had suffered a spin in turn four that flat-spotted his tyres and sent him back to the pitlane. Rosberg managed only third fastest as the Mercedes drivers were split by Sebastian Vettel, even though the latter suffered from electrical problems that lost him track time. Rosberg in turn was unable to improve on his time set on the soft-compound tyre due to his super-soft run being compromised by yellow flags shown after a spin by Romain Grosjean. Behind the top three, Kimi Räikkönen was again fourth, ahead of Daniel Ricciardo and Valtteri Bottas. Slowest of the session was Sauber's Marcus Ericsson, with the two Manor drivers Rio Haryanto and Pascal Wehrlein slotting in ahead of him. Wehrlein reported a loss of power after crossing the <b>chequered</b> flag {{at the end of the}} session.|$|E
5|$|Ornais and Dooneys Gate both {{suffered}} fatal {{falls on}} the first circuit. Ornais incurred a cervical fracture at the fourth fence (a plain 4ft 10-inch obstacle) and Dooneys Gate fractured his thoracolumbar at fence six (the 5ft Becher's Brook). Aintree had made significant modifications to its National Course in recent years, including improving veterinary facilities and reducing the severity of some fences, but another notable change was highlighted in this race – that the course has been widened to allow more fences to be bypassed if necessary. As the remaining contenders on the second circuit approached the 20th fence, arrowed signposts and marshals waving <b>chequered</b> flags signalled them to bypass on the outside as Ornais' body was covered by a tarpaulin on the landing side. Two jumps later and they were again diverted, this time around the famous Becher's Brook, where veterinary staff attended to Dooneys Gate. This {{was the first time}} since the modern course was finalised in the 1880s that only 28 fences were jumped.|$|E
5|$|The last Yugoslav team {{to field}} a {{considerable}} Croatian contingent played against Faroe Islands on 16 May 1991, days before Croatia's independence referendum. However, an unofficial Croatian team was formed shortly before, {{and played the}} team's first modern international game, against the United States on 17 October 1990 at Maksimir Stadium. The game, which Croatia won 2–1, {{was one of three}} games played under caretaker manager Dražan Jerković. The match against the American side also marked the introduction of Croatia's national jersey, inspired by the <b>chequered</b> design of the country's coat of arms. Although Croatia was still officially part of Yugoslavia until its independence declaration on 8 October 1991, this team already served as a de facto national side. Croatia went on to win two more friendly games under Jerković, against Romania in December 1990 and Slovenia in June 1991.|$|E
5|$|Another virtual safety car period ensued on lap 34, {{caused by}} Verstappen who crashed his {{car into the}} barrier after locking up his tyres. As the VSC ended on lap 37, Ricciardo once more failed {{in an attempt to}} regain the lead. At the chicane coming out of the tunnel, Hamilton misjudged the corner and backed Ricciardo off at the exit of the chicane, causing the latter to {{complain}} about the move on team radio. While the incident was investigated by the stewards, the decision was not to take action against Hamilton. At that point, the order stood as follows: Hamilton, Ricciardo, Pérez, Vettel, Alonso, Rosberg, Hülkenberg, Sainz, Button and Gutiérrez. The top four drivers pulled away cleanly {{from the rest of the}} field behind them. On lap 50, the two Sauber cars collided at Rascasse corner, after Felipe Nasr had ignored instructions from the pit lane to let his teammate Ericsson behind him pass. Another VSC period was called while both Sauber drivers made pit stops to repair damages, only for both to retire some laps later. In front, the race carried on in the same order. On lap 68, the fourth virtual safety car period occurred when a large plastic sheet fell onto the start–finish straight. Hamilton was able to extend his lead over Ricciardo at that point, setting the fastest lap of the race on lap 71. Three laps from the finish, rain started to fall again, although no driver changed tyres before the <b>chequered</b> flag fell. Hamilton crossed the finish line to take victory ahead of Ricciardo and Pérez. This win for Hamilton marked his second at Monaco, the other being in 2008. These two races featured many similarities, such as the Hamilton starting third on the grid, the race starting in wet conditions and finishing in the dry, as well as Hamilton taking the lead on lap 33. Vettel hung on to fourth, followed by Alonso in fifth. Rosberg however lost his sixth place to Nico Hülkenberg on the very last lap.|$|E
5|$|As {{the green}} flag flew on lap 38, Chip Ganassi Racing held a one–two with Franchitti leading Dixon, {{with two of}} the Dreyer & Reinbold cars—Conway and Wilson—holding third and fourth places, with the only {{remaining}} KV car of E. J. Viso holding fifth, the Venezuelan disposing of Castroneves just after the restart. Realising that the gamble had backfired, the lead quintet pitted on laps 41 and 42, which cycled Hunter-Reay back through to the lead. Power made an error which allowed Matos and Briscoe to move ahead of him. Briscoe moved ahead of Matos on lap 45 and set off in chase of Hunter-Reay. Four laps later, the Australian was on the American's tail, and moved ahead after an outbraking move into the final hairpin. Hunter-Reay immediately regained the position into the first chicane on Lap 51, before Briscoe sealed the place with a similar final hairpin move {{at the end of the}} lap. Briscoe's luck would run out, however, when he overcooked it into turn five on lap 54, and nudged the barriers with his nose assembly, bringing out the fourth and final caution of the race. The time limit meant that only six laps remained at the restart, with Hunter-Reay leading Power, Matos, Meira and Wheldon. Meira soon passed his fellow Brazilian for third on Lap 57, and began to chase down the lead duo, who had changed positions after Power used the slipstream to overtake Hunter-Reay into the final corner. Power moved away from Hunter-Reay in the final laps, taking the <b>chequered</b> flag to cap his return from injury with a victory. Hunter-Reay took his best result for a year in second, with another injury returnee, Meira, finishing third. Matos was fourth, holding off seven other cars, as fourth to eleventh were covered by 3.49 seconds at the race's conclusion. Wheldon led those seven in fifth, ahead of the Ganassis, Conway, Castroneves, Kanaan and Wilson. Viso finished twelfth ahead of top rookie Beatriz, a recovering Briscoe, Danica Patrick and de Silvestro, the final two off the lead lap.|$|E
25|$|In many short tracks, the flagman {{gives the}} <b>chequered</b> flag {{to the winner}} of the race, but a variety of other celebratory traditions, such as the burnout, the Polish victory lap and the victory lane or victory circle celebration, {{sometimes}} overshadow the <b>chequered</b> flag tradition.|$|E
