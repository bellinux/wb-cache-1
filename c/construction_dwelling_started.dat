It was first {{designated}} {{by the office of}} Wissing-Derks as a 'Groeikern' - a centre of growth - {{to meet the needs of}} the growing city of Utrecht. From the beginning urban planner-designer Robert Derks was involved with the development of the New Town Houten. In 1979 the <b>construction</b> of 10,000 <b>dwellings</b> <b>started</b> and the population grew from 4,000 to more than 30,000 late in the nineties.|$|R

50|$|The suburb is {{predominantly}} residential. Florida Place, a cul-de-sac, {{is typical of}} many residential streets in Seven Hills especially those south of the railway. The buildings show a transition from the mid 20th century single storey mixed <b>construction</b> <b>dwellings</b> {{with an average of}} approx 100 m² floorspace on 600 to 900 m² blocks to replacement two storey brick veneer dwellings built in the 2000s with twice to three times the floorspace.|$|R
50|$|The Original Nucleus of the TownA {{township}} {{started to}} grow up {{on the basis of}} the various activities surrounding the Monestir de Sant Feliu de Guíxols.

50|$|In {{the early}} 17th century, the {{original}} portion of most <b>dwellings</b> <b>started</b> out, {{as a matter}} of immediate need, as simple one-story dwellings constructed primarily of local available material. When available the house would be constructed of fieldstone such as the Abraham Manee House on Staten Island. The wood for the joists and rafters were trimmed with an adze from trees felled on or near the property.|$|R

50|$|Some believe {{abandonment}} of semi-subterranean <b>dwellings</b> <b>started</b> {{at the beginning}} of the Little Ice Age and before the 16th Century. In Labrador, these types of dwellings were believed to be used until the end of the 17th Century when shared sod houses came into the picture. These sod houses varied in size and structure and were built out of necessity when snow was not abundant. This may have been due to warmer climate conditions. However, none have been found in the Nunavik area of Hudson Bay, and semi-subterranean homes were used until the 19th Century.|$|R

Civil institutions soon appeared: the Heathcote Association (1904), the Town Club (1904), the Scarsdale Woman's Club (1918) and the Scarsdale League of Women Voters (1921). Scarsdale High School and Greenacres Elementary School were built in 1912, and the Edgewood Elementary School opened in 1918.

The final stage is the definitive program and dwelling type distribution. Because of the flexibility a large range of dwelling types and sizes was developed, that can be placed throughout the building.

40|$|This paper uses a {{simulation}} model to make exploratory estimates {{of current and}} potential reductions in national costs to sustain dwelling services due to refurbishment. Data and parameters {{are based on a}} typical New Zealand dwelling of lightweight timber framed <b>construction.</b> <b>Dwelling</b> service years provided by a dwelling over one year adjusted for depreciation serve as a proxy for benefits. The costs to construct one dwelling and fractions thereof serve as a proxy for the costs of maintenance, refurbishment, replacement, and new construction. Current levels of refurbishment reduce national average costs to sustain dwelling services by a magnitude of 15 %. Potential reductions in national costs are modest (5 %) should the housing stock be stationary, but are negligible when the expansion rate of the housing stock is as high as 2. 0 % per year. A decline in the expansion rate of a housing stock has a greater impact on reducing national costs than {{an increase in the number}} of cycles of refurbishment. ...|$|R
