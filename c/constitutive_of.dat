25|$|Hermeneutic {{therapists}} use {{memory and}} imagination to envision others’ experiences in their minds. As they do, possibilities {{come to the}} mind of the therapist that might not present themselves to the client: possibilities for potential re-interpretation, healing, meaning, relating, and discovery (knowledge). It is for these reasons that hermeneuts consider imagination is so vital to not only reflexive development but it is vital to therapists as an intersubjective tool to help promote growth in clients by bringing “to mind what is presently absent", which helps establish some stability to one's knowledge and, in turn, establish personal truth and meaning about a self and his or her experiences. Finally, the knowledge produced from imagination is only <b>constitutive</b> <b>of</b> a person's (client's) identity and experiences when that person marks that knowledge as meaningful to his- or herself, thus reinforcing the impact of co-created meaning in counseling.|$|E

25|$|Ultimately, each {{relatively}} autonomous {{field of}} modern life, such as economy, politics, arts, journalism, bureaucracy, science or education engenders a specific complex {{of social relations}} where the agents will engage their everyday practice. Through this practice, they develop a certain disposition for social action that is conditioned by their position on the field (dominant/dominated and orthodox/heterodox are only two possible ways of positioning the agents on the field; these basic binary distinctions are always further analysed considering the specificities of each field). This disposition, combined with every other disposition the individual develops through his engagement with other fields operating within the social world, will eventually come to constitute a system of dispositions, known in Bourdieu's lexicon as a habitus. Dispositions - a key concept in Bourdieu's work - can be conceived as {{a sense of the}} game, a partly rational but partly intuitive understanding of fields and of social order in general, a practical sense, a practical reason, giving rise to opinions, tastes, tone of voice, typical body movements and mannerisms and so on. The dispositions <b>constitutive</b> <b>of</b> habitus are therefore conditioned responses to the social world, becoming so ingrained that they come to occur spontaneously, rather like 'kneejerk' opinions. It follows that the habitus developed by an individual will typify his position in the social space. By doing so, social agents will often acknowledge, legitimate and reproduce the social forms of domination (including prejudices) and the common opinions of each field as self-evident, clouding from conscience and practice even the acknowledgment of other possible means of production (including symbolic production) and power relations.|$|E

2500|$|It was {{not until}} {{publication}} of The Abuse of Casuistry: A History of Moral Reasoning (1988), by Albert Jonsen and Stephen Toulmin, that a revival of casuistry occurred. They argue that the abuse of casuistry is the problem, not casuistry per se (itself an example of casuistic reasoning). Properly used, casuistry is powerful reasoning. Jonsen and Toulmin offer casuistry in dissolving the contradictory tenets of moral absolutism and the common secular moral relativism: [...] "the form of reasoning <b>constitutive</b> <b>of</b> classical casuistry is rhetorical reasoning.". Moreover, the ethical philosophies of Utilitarianism (especially preference utilitarianism) and Pragmatism commonly are identified as greatly employing casuistic reasoning.|$|E

The superiority of Fr. Sage’s analysis comes from his work on Fr. d’Alzon’s thought. He “explains” the Assumption from d’Alzon himself and shows the profoundly Christocentric doctrine of the founder.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Partial {{resistance}} to plant pathogens is extensively used in breeding programs since it {{could contribute to}} resistance durability. Partial resistance often builds up during plant development and confers quantitative and usually broad-spectrum resistance. However, very little is known on the mechanisms underlying partial resistance. Partial resistance is often explained by poorly effective induction of plant defense systems. By exploring rice natural diversity, we asked whether expression of defense systems before infection could explain partial {{resistance to}}wards the major fungal pathogen Magnaporthe oryzae. The <b>constitutive</b> expression <b>of</b> 21 defense-related genes belonging to the defense system was monitored in 23 randomly sampled rice cultivars for which partial resistance was measured. Results We identified {{a strong correlation between}} the expression of defense-related genes before infection and partial resistance. Only a weak correlation was found between the induction of defense genes and partial resistance. Increasing <b>constitutive</b> expression <b>of</b> defense-related genes also correlated with the establishment of partial resistance during plant development. Some rice genetic sub-groups displayed a particular pattern <b>of</b> <b>constitutive</b> expression, suggesting a strong natural polymorphism for <b>constitutive</b> expression <b>of</b> defense. <b>Constitutive</b> levels <b>of</b> hormones like salicylic acid and ethylene cannot explain <b>constitutive</b> expression <b>of</b> defense. We could identify an area of the genome that contributes to explain both preformed defense and partial resistance. Conclusion These results indicate that <b>constitutive</b> expression <b>of</b> defense-related genes is likely responsible for a large part of partial resistance in rice. The finding of this preformed defense system should help guide future breeding programs and open the possibility to identify the molecular mechanisms behind partial resistance. </p...|$|R
2500|$|A {{number of}} critics argued that {{analytical}} Marxism proceeded {{from the wrong}} methodological and epistemological premises. [...] While the analytical Marxists dismissed [...] "dialectically oriented" [...] Marxism as [...] "bullshit", others maintain that the distinctive character of Marxist philosophy is lost if it is understood [...] "non-dialectically". The crucial feature of Marxist philosophy {{is that it is}} not a reflection in thought of the world, a crude materialism, but rather an intervention in the world concerned with human praxis. According to this view, analytical Marxism wrongly characterizes intellectual activity as occurring in isolation from the struggles <b>constitutive</b> <b>of</b> its social and political conjuncture, and at the same time does little to intervene in that conjuncture. For dialectical Marxists, analytical Marxism eviscerated Marxism, turning it from a systematic doctrine of revolutionary transformation into a set of discrete theses that stand or fall on the basis of their logical consistency and empirical validity.|$|E
