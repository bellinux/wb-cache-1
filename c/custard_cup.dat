60|$|At {{last the}} dinner was all done, the cloth was cleared, the hearth swept, {{and the fire}} made up. The {{compound}} in the jug being tasted, and considered perfect, apples and oranges were put upon the table, and a shovel full of chestnuts on the fire. Then all the Cratchit family drew round the hearth in what Bob Cratchit called a circle, meaning half a one; and at Bob Cratchit's elbow stood the family display of glass. Two tumblers and a <b>custard</b> <b>cup</b> without a handle.|$|E
5000|$|In American Food (1974), author Evan Jones writes: [...] "Settlers from Maine {{who founded}} Portland, Oregon, Americanized the pudding from Yorkshire by cooking the batter in <b>custard</b> <b>cups</b> {{lubricated}} with drippings from the roasting beef (or sometimes pork); another modification {{was the use}} of garlic, and, frequently, herbs. The result is called Portland popover pudding: individual balloons of crusty meat-flavored pastry." ...|$|R
2500|$|In late 1864, Mrs. Lincoln {{ordered a}} new set of china for the White House. [...] This time, the {{importer}} was China Hall, a company owned by James K. Kerr of Philadelphia. The design this time was extremely simple: [...] A white plate, with a buff border edged in gilt lines. This 511-piece set consisted of dining plates, soup plates, dessert plates, ice cream plates, a wide variety of dishes (large and small fish platters, vegetable platters, side dish platters), tureens, sauce boats, pickle dishes, salad bowls, <b>custard</b> <b>cups,</b> fruit baskets (round and oval), fruit platters, sugar bowls, coffee cups and saucers, and other items. [...] This 181-piece set cost $1,700, and was billed on January 30, 1865. It's not clear which firm manufactured the china, but it is clearly of French make.|$|R
2500|$|Lincoln ordered 666 {{pieces of}} china for the White House. The dining service – which {{consisted}} of two large salad bowls, four pickle bowls, 18 meat platters of various sizes (ranging from [...] in diameter), four fish platters of various sizes, two butter dishes, six vegetable platters, 96 dinner plates, 48 soup bowls, four water pitchers, and two ice bowls – consisted of 190 pieces. [...] The 208-piece dessert service consisted of <b>custard</b> <b>cups,</b> fruit bowls of various heights and sizes, strawberry bowls, sugar bowls, fruit baskets (some oval, some round), dessert plates, coffee cups, and two large shell-shaped bowls. The breakfast/tea service consisted of tea plates, preserve plates, coffee cups, egg cups, tea cups, and cake plates {{for a total of}} 260 pieces. [...] She also ordered four [...] "servers" [...] (large plates for serving chocolates), two punch bowls, and four large centerpieces (white pelicans formed a pillar on top of which was a large platform on which dishes could be presented).|$|R
50|$|The {{cream is}} made by {{whipping}} egg yolks and sugar together until the yolk is almost white, and then slowly adding hot milk, while whisking. This process is {{commonly referred to as}} tempering. Vanilla beans (seeds) may be added for extra flavour and visual appeal. The sauce is then cooked over low heat (excessive heating may cause the yolks to cook, resulting in scrambled eggs) and stirred constantly with a spoon until it is thick enough to coat the back of a spoon, and then removed from the heat. It is also possible to set the sauce into <b>custard</b> <b>cups</b> and bake in a bain-marie until the egg yolks set. If the sauce reaches too high a temperature, it will curdle, although it can be salvaged by straining into a container placed in an ice bath. Cooking temperature should be between 70 °C (156 °F) and 85 °C (185 °F); the higher the temperature, the thicker the resulting cream, as long as the yolks are fully incorporated into the mixture.|$|R
30|$|Five {{samples from}} each cluster were {{selected}} for sensory evaluation using the texture profiling method [Lyon et al. 2000]. Milled grains from each sample were cooked using a 1 : 1 (v/v) ratio with water in rice cookers (0.6  L, Micromatic Model MRC- 350). After the rice was cooked to completion, the rice was mixed, ensuring that the grains touching the sides and the bottom were undisturbed. Sub-samples were distributed into glass <b>custard</b> <b>cups</b> (pre-labelled with three-digit codes), sealed with a plastic lid, and then monadically presented for sensory evaluation to a previously trained set of panellists. Along with the sample, a tablespoon {{and a cup of}} drinking water were provided. To ensure that the samples were kept warm during the evaluation, the samples were kept in the rice cooker (at the “Warm” setting) and only placed in sample cups once the panellists requested for the samples. A rice breeding line, IR 06 N 155 (harvested in the dry season of 2013 at IRRI’s Long-Term Continuous Cropping Experiment), was used as a standard. It was served to the panellists six times, randomly distributed in different rice tasting sessions.|$|R
2500|$|In July 1865, President Andrew Johnson asked Haughwout & Co. {{to make an}} {{inventory}} of the White House china and silver, and to make replacements as necessary. Congress subsequently made a $30,000 appropriation {{at the end of}} 1865 to pay for the general refurbishment of the house (which included the china and silver replacements). The administration replaced the entire [...] "solferino" [...] china set with an identical set on January 17, 1866, also manufactured by Haviland and decorated by E. V. Haughwout and Company. This china is different from the 1861 set, as both the outline and the colors were done by hand (no stencil was used). [...] This second order of [...] "Lincoln china" [...] consisted of 391 pieces, and included pickle dishes, <b>custard</b> <b>cups,</b> egg cups, serving dishes of various depths, compote dishes, sugar bowls, baskets, butter dishes, dinner plates, dessert plates, tea plates, soup plates, preserve plates, breakfast coffee cups, regular coffee cups, tea cups, water pitchers, and one salad bowl, cake plate, and ice bowl. There is little documentary evidence, but oral tradition claims that E.V. Haughwout contracted with Edward Lycett, the most famous china painter in the United States at the time, to decorate the china. Glassware was also reordered from Haughwout & Co. in 1866, and manufactured by the New England Glass Co. of Cambridge, Massachusetts.|$|R
