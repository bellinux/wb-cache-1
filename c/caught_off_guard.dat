5|$|In the {{clashes with}} the Normans through the 1080s, the only {{effective}} Byzantine naval force was a squadron commanded, and possibly maintained, by Michael Maurex, a veteran naval commander of previous decades.

5|$|In 1950, the Korean War broke out, {{prompting}} the United States {{to intervene in}} the name of the United Nations. President Truman was <b>caught</b> <b>off</b> <b>guard</b> when the invasion struck, but quickly ordered U.S. forces stationed in Japan into South Korea. Truman also sent U.S.-based troops, tanks, fighter and bomber aircraft, and a strong naval force to Korea to support the Republic of Korea. As part of the naval mobilization Missouri was called up from the Atlantic Fleet and dispatched from Norfolk on 19 August to support UN forces on the Korean peninsula.|$|E

They managed to capture the armoury and proclaimed victory. The leaders of the uprising sent a patrol into the centre of the town to exhort the populace to join the insurrection, falsely claiming that they had already eliminated the entire French officer corps.|$|E
5|$|The {{incident}} {{involved the}} accidental triggering {{of a fire}} extinguishing system which sealed two forward compartments and released Halon 2402 (freon R-114B2), dibromotetrafluoroethane gas into them. According to survivors, those affected by the gas release were <b>caught</b> <b>off</b> <b>guard</b> and {{may not have been}} alerted in time due to warning sirens sounding only after the gas had already begun pouring in. Some of the victims were reported to have been unable to turn on breathing kits before they suffocated.|$|E

One barge was an oil rig tender that {{contained}} 16people; it was carried several hundred miles across the central Gulf of Mexico. All crew members survived, {{and there were no}} maritime deaths related to the hurricane. Jeanne produced a prolonged period of rough surf and heavy swells along the Texas coast. Tides reached 2 to 4feet (1.20m) above normal. The hurricane caused coastal flooding; the worst flooding occurred near Galveston.|$|E
5|$|In June 1941, Nazi Germany {{invaded the}} Soviet Union. Unlike {{many of the}} border troops who were <b>caught</b> <b>off</b> <b>guard</b> by the offensive, Bagramyan and his commander, General Mikhail Kirponos, {{believed}} an invasion by Germany was inevitable. However, Kirponos chose to ignore Bagramyan's viewpoint that the German offensive would employ the lightning speed Blitzkrieg tactics like those seen in the campaigns in Poland in 1939 and Western Europe in 1940. Since the winter of 1939–40, Bagramyan had been busy devising a battle plan that would counter threats from the western Ukraine, which was approved after numerous revisions on 10 May 1940.|$|E
5|$|It's good to {{know people}} didn't see it coming. That's a big concern when you {{have this kind of}} story line and you are leading to that kind of reveal. You don't want people to be expecting it, {{especially}} in the Walking Dead. I pride myself in the fact that, when you pick up an issue of the comic, you don't know what's going to happen at any time. So any time we can work that into the show and maintain that in a television environment, it's very exciting for me. I’m glad people are being <b>caught</b> <b>off</b> <b>guard.</b>|$|E

5|$|On February 17, 1859, the French {{warships}} {{opened fire}} on the citadel with artillery. This attack focused on the southeastern corner of the citadel, {{where most of the}} Vietnamese artillery had been installed. The Vietnamese artillery commanders had miscalculated and had set up their cannons incorrectly, firing at excessively high angles. The cannons were not easily adjusted and thus the Vietnamese firepower was misdirected and ineffective. At around 10:00, Captain Des Pallieres led 300 French soldiers in an infantry attack. They used bamboo ladders to scale the walls under artillery support from the river. The defenders were <b>caught</b> <b>off</b> <b>guard</b> by this manoevre and many fled in chaos.|$|E
5|$|The outer {{bands of}} Hurricane Dean {{produced}} heavy rainfall and winds up to 75mph (121km/h) across Antigua and Barbuda.

In the Atlantic, a sailboat bound for Bermuda was <b>caught</b> <b>off</b> <b>guard</b> by the hurricane. The boat, which carried no radio equipment, was spotted by a hurricane hunter plane. The occupants of the boat suffered no injuries. In Bermuda, the hurricanes eastern eyewall produced 81mph (130km/h) sustained winds with gusts up to 113mph (182km/h). Bermuda highest rainfall total from Dean was 2.45in (50.8mm) while parts of the island received 3-5in (76.2–127mm) of rain.|$|E
5|$|The {{restoration}} {{of relations with}} Galicia had an immediate benefit for Manuel when, in 1166, he dispatched two armies to attack the eastern provinces of Hungary in a vast pincer movement. One army crossed the Walachian Plain and entered Hungary through the Transylvanian Alps (Southern Carpathians), while the other army made a wide circuit to Galicia and, with Galician aid, crossed the Carpathian Mountains. Since the Hungarians had most of their forces concentrated on the Sirmium and Belgrade frontier, they were <b>caught</b> <b>off</b> <b>guard</b> by the Byzantine invasion; this resulted in the Hungarian province of Transylvania being thoroughly ravaged by the Byzantine armies.|$|E

5|$|By this time, {{the first}} wave of what would {{eventually}} be more than four million letters, telegrams, postcards, and phone calls had flooded into RNC headquarters and other political offices. While a later study found that only about 7 percent of these communications addressed any substantive issue, they still ran 75 to one in favor of Nixon. Nixon skeptics joined in; both Stassen and Dewey sent congratulatory telegrams. Many letters included contributions {{to help pay for the}} cost of the broadcast; the RNC eventually recouped four-fifths of the $75,000 cost. Newspaper switchboards were jammed with calls from people seeking the RNC's address, while Western Union was <b>caught</b> <b>off</b> <b>guard</b> by Nixon's request that listeners wire the RNC, and had no extra help on hand. Checkers herself received enough dog food to last a year, and hundreds of collars, leashes, and toys.|$|E
5|$|Claudette wobbled to the {{northwest}} over the Gulf of Mexico and gradually restrengthened. Upper-level winds steadily decreased, and Claudette again became a hurricane late on July 14. Just prior to landfall, it strengthened quickly and picked up its forward motion in a more westerly direction, striking Port O'Connor, Texas, on July 15 as a Category1 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale with 90mph (150km/h) winds. Residents along and inland of the central Texas coast were <b>caught</b> <b>off</b> <b>guard</b> both by its intensity and its time of arrival. The hurricane was projected to make landfall in the evening hours of July 15, but instead came ashore before noon. Furthermore, some initial estimates suggested that Claudette had reached Category2 status, with sustained winds of up to 100mph (155km/h); these were based on unofficial observations which were not backed up by official data.|$|E
5|$|The Secretary of State Nguyễn Đính Thuan and Interior Minister Bùi Văn Lương were <b>caught</b> <b>off</b> <b>guard</b> by the attacks. The initial {{perception}} {{was that the}} military establishment had suddenly cracked down on the Buddhists because they were deemed {{to be a threat}} to the war effort. The government propagated a theory which held that the military felt compelled to take action after pro-Buddhist student unrest on 17–18 August. In Huế, student protestors had turned on an ARVN officer after he fired in their direction. The attacks were preceded by a large rally at Xá Lợi during which some monks had called for the overthrow of the Diệm regime and denounced the anti-Buddhist statements of the de facto first lady Madame Nhu. However, observers dismissed government claims that the raids were spontaneous.|$|E
50|$|North Vietnam had {{announced}} in October 1967 {{that it would}} observe a seven-day ceasefire from January 27 to February 3, 1968, {{in honor of the}} Tết holiday.

5|$|The western army, led by Wanyan Zonghan, {{departed}} from Datong and headed towards Taiyuan {{through the mountains}} of Shanxi, {{on its way to}} the Song western capital Luoyang. The Song forces were not expecting an invasion and were <b>caught</b> <b>off</b> <b>guard.</b> The Chinese general Tong Guan was informed of the military expedition by an envoy he had sent to the Jin to obtain the cession of two prefectures. The returning envoy reported that the Jurchens were willing to forgo an invasion if the Song ceded control of Hebei and Shanxi to the Jin. Tong Guan retreated from Taiyuan and left command of his troops to Wang Bing. Jin armies besieged the city in mid January 1126. Under Wang Bing's command, Taiyuan held on long enough to stop the Jurchen troops from advancing to Luoyang.|$|E
5|$|Bellerophon {{returned}} to England in June, before departing {{to patrol the}} Western Approaches until September. She entered Portsmouth Dockyard again in October and underwent a refit costing £8,103. She resumed patrol and blockade duty in the Western Approaches in January 1796, at first under Cranstoun, but from April effectively under the acting-captaincy of Lieutenant John Loring. Cranstoun's replacement, Captain Henry D'Esterre Darby, arrived to take command in September. Blockade duty continued until early January 1797, when news reached the fleet that a French expedition had appeared off Ireland. <b>Caught</b> <b>off</b> <b>guard,</b> the Admiralty ordered Bellerophon {{and a number of}} other ships to patrol off Bantry Bay. By then the French expedition had been dispersed by bad weather, and after three weeks on patrol, Bellerophon put into Cork where she rendezvoused with the Irish squadron under Admiral Robert Kingsmill. Shortly after her return to Spithead in early March, Bellerophon was given new orders by the Admiralty. She sailed on 17 March, bound for Cadiz to join Sir John Jervis's Mediterranean Fleet blockading the port.|$|E

New Jersey was recommissioned at Bayonne on 21 November 1950, Captain David M. Tyree in command, and proceeded to the Caribbean, where she welded her crew into an efficient body which would meet the demanding requirements of the Korean War. She sailed from Norfolk, Virginia 16 April 1951 and arrived from Japan off the east coast of Korea 17 May. Vice Admiral Harold M. Martin, commanding the United States Seventh Fleet, placed his flag in New Jersey for the next six months.|$|E
