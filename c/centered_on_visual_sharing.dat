5000|$|In Laurel's work {{regarding}} interface design, she is {{well known}} for her support of the theory of interactivity, the [...] "degree to which users of a medium can influence the form or content of the mediated environment." [...] Virtual reality, according to Laurel, is less characterized by its imaginary or unreal elements than by its multisensory representation of objects, be they real or imaginary. While discussions around virtual reality tended to <b>center</b> <b>on</b> <b>visual</b> representations, audio and kinesthesia are two potent sources of sensory input that virtual reality devices attempt to tap into. Laurel's 1994 Placeholder installation at Banff Center for the Arts—a collaboration with Rachel Strickland—explored these multisensory possibilities. The installation allowed multiple people to construct a narrative by attaching movement trackers to its subjects' bodies while letting them navigate a virtual environment by doing common physical acts with special results, such as flapping one's arms to fly.|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} novel {{approach}} to teaching astronomy and planetary sciences, <b>centered</b> <b>on</b> <b>visual</b> images and simulations of planetary objects. The basic idea of the “Thinking Journey” concept {{is to take the}} students to other celestial objects as tourists, and to teach science through the observation of various natural phenomena in these new environments. The power of scientific visualization, through still and dynamic images, makes such a journey an exciting learning experience. The introduction of new technologies (3 D animations, virtual reality) greatly enhances the visualization capabilities the teacher can use, allowing him to simulate actual flights over the terrain of other planets and to study them as if observing from a spaceship in orbit. The present program focuses on the study of the Moon and of the planet Mars, by means of observation, interpretation, and comparison to planet Earth. Students learn to recognize geological and atmospheric processes, discuss astronomic phenomena, and discover that the same basic physical laws govern all objects in the solar system.

The archive preserves a large artistic and documentary heritage about any form of artistic expression featuring the use of both the word and the sign. Born from the encounter between Della Grazia and artist Ugo Carrega, in the 1990s the ANS became the main Italian research <b>center</b> <b>on</b> <b>visual</b> poetry, organizing exhibitions, meetings and other cultural events. In 1998 the Archivio di Nuova Scrittura was deposited in part at the Mart in Rovereto (library, archives and some artworks) and in part at the Museion in Bozen (artworks only). The artwork section of the ANS includes about 1,600 works by international artists at Mart and about 2,000 at Museion. The ANS archives preserve, apart from the internal archive of the association (ANS fonds), the Fraccaro-Carrega fonds, containing the papers of collector Marco Fraccaro and visual poet Ugo Carrega. The library section, preserved at Mart, contains more than 10,000 volumes, among them 600 artist's books and hundreds of futurist first editions, and 500 art magazines including about 100 international artist's magazines.|$|R
40|$|With the {{proliferation}} of digital multimedia, more and more schemes for digitally watermarking have been proposed to provide alternative/complementary solutions for digital multimedia security, including copyright protection, multimedia authentication, broadcast monitoring, traitor tracing, etc [...] These watermarking tasks are not mutually exclusive. Moreover, any multimedia document may {{have been subjected to}} multiple watermarking, applications or several repetitions of a single goal. For the developments of digital watermarking techniques, robustness enhancement, public verfication and multiple-watermarking applications are three major focuses. In this paper, a watermarking model for multiple-watermarking applications, based <b>on</b> <b>visual</b> secret <b>sharing,</b> is proposed. The feature of the proposed model is to involve the concept of <b>visual</b> secret <b>sharing</b> into multiple watermarking. Furthermore, an implementation instance, aiming at enhancing the robustness of watermarks, is shown for which a series of experiments over both DWT- and DFT-domain were conducted. The proposed scheme has the following advantages: First of all, the proposed scheme is resistant to both common image processing and geometric distortion without losing commercial value of the protected contents.

The binary patterns of the shares, however, have no visual meaning and hinder the objectives of visual cryptography. Halftone visual cryptography encodes a secret binary image into n halftone shares (images) carrying significant visual information.

40|$|The {{topic of}} this thesis is lifelogging, the automatic, passive {{recording}} of a person’s daily activities and in particular, on performing a semantic analysis and enrichment of lifelogged data. Our work <b>centers</b> <b>on</b> <b>visual</b> lifelogged data, such as taken from wearable cameras. Such wearable cameras generate an archive of a person’s day {{taken from a}} first-person viewpoint {{but one of the}} problems with this is the sheer volume of information that can be generated. In order to make this potentially very large volume of information more manageable, our analysis of this data is based on segmenting each day’s lifelog data into discrete and non-overlapping events corresponding to activities in the wearer’s day. To manage lifelog data at an event level, we define a set of concepts using an ontology which is appropriate to the wearer, applying automatic detection of concepts to these events and then semantically enriching each of the detected lifelog events making them an index into the events. Once this enrichment is complete we can use the lifelog to support semantic search for everyday media management, as a memory aid, or as part of medical analysis on the activities of daily living (ADL), and so on. In the thesis, we address the problem of how to select the concepts to be used for indexing events and we propose a semantic, density- based algorithm to cope with concept selection issues for lifelogging. We then apply activity detection to classify everyday activities by employing the selected concepts as high-level semantic features. Finally, the activity is modeled by multi-context representations and enriched by Semantic Web technologies. The thesis includes an experimental evaluation using real data from users and shows the performance of our algorithms in capturing the semantics of everyday concepts and their efficacy in activity recognition and semantic enrichment...|$|R

Design {{enables us to}} adapt the built environment to people's needs and to empower people interacting in the environment. Yet, design knowledge about how to design products effectively is limited. Neither traditional intuitive design methods <b>centered</b> <b>on</b> <b>visual</b> language nor human-centered design methods <b>centered</b> <b>on</b> cognition adequately {{address the needs of}} people of different cultures in different contexts. A rhetorical approach to design can provide methods and principles to understand people's culture and context. In this study, the researcher sought to map and understand the rhetorical appeals (i. e., logos, pathos, ethos) in design for social change. This research is a pragmatic primarily qualitative study developed in three stages. (1) The researcher examined design products for social change (i. e., animated viral videos) with rhetorical appeals analysis and expert interviews. (2) He led the design of a product (i. e., a mobile web application for Latino parents about childhood obesity prevention called Lifecast) and conducted an auto-observation of his behavior as the designer. (3) He evaluated the design product with design experts and in the real context using heuristics, participant observation, and in-depth interviews. The researcher found that strength of the three rhetorical appeals generates a wide reception. He concluded that an effective strategy of rhetorical appeals should be carefully planned and continually reviewed. In the evaluation of the design product, he found that parents and their children were motivated to use the design product and exhibited positive change in their knowledge, attitudes, and behavior. The researcher identified salient indices and strategies that constitute an inventory to organize the rhetorical appeal concepts in graphic design, that thus far are imprecise theoretical concepts. Also, he proposed rules of thumb about the rhetorical appeals in design for social change. Future research should focus <b>on</b> not only <b>visual</b> and textual elements, but also on design concept, design format, and interactivity elements. Finally, the researcher examined design research methods and discussed issues of design practice in research, research frames, and research paradigms. Based on the concepts mapped in this dissertation, future research on rhetorical appeals in design for social change should include experimental methods...|$|R
