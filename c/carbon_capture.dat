5|$|Following the {{legislative}} session, Beshear began to address his agenda related to energy production.

The move essentially reversed the consolidation of Environmental, Public Protection, and Labor Cabinets effected under Beshear's predecessor, Ernie Fletcher. Later in the year, Beshear released what he called the state's first-ever comprehensive energy plan. The plan called for expansion of solar, wind, and biomass energy generation, as well as more speculative ventures such as coal gasification and <b>carbon</b> <b>capture</b> and sequestration. Although the plan called for an exploration of the use of nuclear power, Beshear stopped short of advocating an end to the state's ban on the construction of nuclear reactors.|$|E

40|$|Gasification {{appears to}} be the way of {{processing}} and utilizing coal cleanly. However, currently the main issue of coal utilization is CO 2 production that adversely impacts the environmental sustainability of this process. Some efforts have been made to control and reduce the CO 2 emission in the atmosphere, such as using CCS (<b>Carbon</b> <b>Captured</b> and Storage) or CCU (<b>Carbon</b> <b>Captured</b> and Utilization). As a part of those efforts, this work investigates the effect of utilizing CO 2 in the gasification process. Towards this aim, numerical simulations of single coal particle gasification are conducted. The benefits of adding CO 2 to the gasification process compared to that of air are examined thoroughly. It is found that H 2, CO and CH 4 productions are increased with CO 2 addition thus indicating an improvement in syngas generation from the coal gasification...|$|R
40|$|This paper links Hotelling's theory, {{in recent}} {{literature}} applied to an emission constrained environment, with the classical capacity planning framework to describe portfolio time-paths in electricity production. Emission targets are considered by a ceiling {{on the stock}} of pollution. We propose conditions for an efficient production portfolio as a subset of available technologies. We then derive potential production portfolio time-paths for a renewable, a fossil and a <b>carbon</b> <b>capturing</b> technology that differ according to their fixed and variable costs, their efficiency and their polluting characteristics. We conclude that {{the share of the}} fossil technology will continuously decrease, the scarce resource will be fully exploited. On each constrained path, the stock of pollution will remain at the ceiling for a non-zero time period.
