50|$|Tenancy {{in common}} {{is a form of}} <b>concurrent</b> <b>estate</b> in which each owner, {{referred}} to as a tenant in common, is regarded by the law as owning separate and distinct shares of the same property. By default, all co-owners own equal shares, but their interests may differ in size.|$|E
5000|$|Ownership {{transfer}} {{may also}} be crafted within deeds to pass by demise, as where a property is held in <b>concurrent</b> <b>estate</b> such as [...] "joint tenants with right of survivorship" [...] (JTWROS) or [...] "tenants by the entirety". In each case, the title to the property immediately and automatically vests in the named survivor(s) upon {{the death of the}} other tenant(s).|$|E
50|$|A <b>concurrent</b> <b>estate</b> or {{co-tenancy}} is {{a concept}} in property law which describes the various ways in which property is owned {{by more than one}} person at a time. If more than one person owns the same property, they are referred to as co-owners. If more than one person leases the same property, they are called co-tenants or joint tenants. Most common law jurisdictions recognize tenancies in common and joint tenancies, and some also recognize tenancies by the entirety. Many jurisdictions refer to a joint tenancy as a joint tenancy with right of survivorship, and a few U.S. states treat the phrase joint tenancy as synonymous with a tenancy in common.|$|E

5000|$|Co-owners in <b>concurrent</b> <b>estates</b> {{also have}} the right to an {{accounting}} of profits, in order to properly apportion income from the use or leasing of the property. The remedy is also available against strangers to a trust who [...] "dishonestly assist" [...] an express trustee in a breach of the trustee’s fiduciary duty.|$|R
40|$|Designed {{for use in}} a four, five or six unit Property course, this casebook applies {{traditional}} property {{concepts in}} a distinctly modern context. The book begins with fundamental Property principles and concepts, followed by personal property with an introduction to intellectual property. Subsequent chapters cover present and future interests, <b>concurrent</b> <b>estates,</b> landlord and tenant law, real estate transactions, easements, covenants, and public land use regulation (including zoning, eminent domain and regulatory takings, and constitutional challenges based on due process, equal protection, freedom of speech and freedom of religion).

5000|$|Fee simple. Under common law, this is {{the most}} {{complete}} ownership interest one can have in real property, other than the rare Allodial title. The holder can typically freely sell or otherwise transfer that interest or use it to secure a mortgage loan. This picture of [...] "complete ownership" [...] is, of course, complicated by the obligation in most places to pay a property tax and by the fact that if the land is mortgaged, there will be a claim on it {{in the form of a}} lien. In modern societies, {{this is the}} most common form of land ownership. Land can also be owned by more than one party and there are various <b>concurrent</b> <b>estate</b> rules.|$|E
50|$|A {{joint tenancy}} or joint tenancy with right of {{survivorship}} (JTROS, JTWROS or JT TEN WROS) {{is a type of}} <b>concurrent</b> <b>estate</b> in which co-owners have a {{right of survivorship}}, meaning that if one owner dies, that owner's interest in the property will pass to the surviving owner or owners by operation of law, and avoiding probate. The deceased owner's interest in the property simply evaporates and cannot be inherited by his or her heirs. Under this type of ownership, the last owner living owns all the property, and on his or her death the property will form part of their estate. Unlike a tenancy in common, where co-owners may have unequal interests in a property, joint co-owners have an equal share in the property.|$|E
5000|$|A {{partition}} is a {{term used}} in the law of real property to describe an act, by a court order or otherwise, to divide up a <b>concurrent</b> <b>estate</b> into separate portions representing the proportionate interests of the owners of property. It is sometimes described as a forced sale. Under the common law, any owner of property who owns an undivided concurrent interest in land can seek such a division. In some cases, the parties agree to a specific division of the land; if {{they are unable to}} do so, the court will determine an appropriate division. A sole owner, or several owners, of a piece of land may partition their land by entering a deed poll (sometimes referred to as [...] "carving out").|$|E
5000|$|Writing in January 2011, {{three of}} the four Republicans on the FCIC Commission also agreed that the <b>concurrent</b> {{commercial}} real <b>estate</b> boom showed that U.S. housing policies were not the sole cause of the real estate bubble:"Credit spreads declined not just for housing, but also for other asset classes like commercial real estate. This tells us to look to the credit bubble as an essential cause of the U.S. housing bubble. It also tells us that problems with U.S. housing policy or markets do not by themselves explain the U.S. housing bubble." ...|$|R
5000|$|A tenancy by the {{entirety}} (sometimes called a tenancy by the entireties) {{is a type}} of <b>concurrent</b> <b>estate</b> formerly available only to married couples, where ownership of property is treated as though the couple were a single legal person. (In the State of Hawaii, the option of Tenants by the Entirety ownership is also available to domestic partners in a registered [...] "Reciprocal Beneficiary Relationship"; Vermont's Civil Union statute qualifies parties to a civil union for tenancy by {{the entirety}}.) Like a Joint Tenancy with Rights of Survivorship, the tenancy by the entirety also encompasses a right of survivorship, so if one spouse dies, the entire interest in the property is said to [...] "ripen" [...] in the survivor so that sole control of the property ripens, or passes in the ordinary sense, to the surviving spouse without going through probate.|$|E
