5000|$|With {{the formula}} below, freezing-point {{depression}} {{can be used}} to measure the degree of dissociation or the molar mass of the solute. This kind of measurement is called <b>cryoscopy</b> (Greek cryo = cold, scopos = observe [...] "observe the cold") and relies on exact measurement of the freezing point. The degree of dissociation is measured by determining the van 't Hoff factor i by first determining mB and then comparing it to msolute. In this case, the molar mass of the solute must be known. The molar mass of a solute is determined by comparing mB with the amount of solute dissolved. In this case, i must be known, and the procedure is primarily useful for organic compounds using a nonpolar solvent. <b>Cryoscopy</b> is no longer as common a measurement method as it once was, but it was included in textbooks {{at the turn of the}} 20th century. As an example, it was still taught as a useful analytic procedure in Cohen's Practical Organic Chemistry [...] of 1910, in which the molar mass of naphthalene is determined using a Beckmann freezing apparatus.|$|E
5000|$|Together {{with the}} formula above, the boiling-point {{elevation}} can in principle {{be used to}} measure the degree of dissociation or the molar mass of the solute. This kind of measurement is called ebullioscopy (Greek [...] "boiling-viewing"). However, since superheating is difficult to avoid, precise ΔTb measurements are difficult to carry out, which was partly overcome by the invention of the Beckmann thermometer. Furthermore, the cryoscopic constant that determines freezing-point depression is larger than the ebullioscopic constant, and since the freezing point is often easier to measure with precision, it is more common to use <b>cryoscopy.</b>|$|E
50|$|In 1887 Wilhelm Ostwald {{moved to}} Leipzig, and {{physical}} chemistry {{then became a}} focus of Beckmann's work, as he served {{as an assistant to}} Ostwald. Beckmann used the methods of ebullioscopy (boiling-point elevation) and <b>cryoscopy</b> (freezing-point depression) to determine the molecular masses of several substances. These measurements required a careful determination of temperature differences, as opposed to absolute values, and to accomplish them Beckmann invented the differential thermometer that now carries his name (Beckmann thermometer). For this work he altered the methods of François-Marie Raoult, and the improvement was sufficiently great that Beckmann's method, and the associated equipment, became standard in chemical laboratories. However, {{by the end of the}} twentieth century these colligative-property techniques had been largely superseded by molecular mass determinations using electronic instrumentation.|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: It is {{a common}} {{observation}} that superficial freezing of normal skin and skin tumors may create a transient superficial whitening effect. In this respect, <b>cryoscopy</b> refers to the direct observation by dermoscopy, with or without digital recording, of the visual alterations of the frozen tissues. AIMS: To define the optimal method of <b>cryoscopy</b> and to describe the <b>cryoscopy</b> patterns of normal skin and selected skin lesions. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The influence of (a) different cryogenic sources [solid carbon dioxide (- 78. 5 degrees C), liquid nitrogen (N(2), - 196 degrees C), and a mixture of dimethyl ether and propane (- 57 degrees C) ], (b) various application methods (spraying, cotton chill tips, copper plate), and (c) freezing time was assessed with regard to clinical feasability, visualization quality, and persistance time of the whitening effect. <b>Cryoscopy</b> patterns of normal skin, callosities and of histologically proven seborrheic keratoses, verrucous hamartomas, molluscum contagiosum, keratoacanthomas, viral warts, condylomas, actinic keratoses, dermatofibromas, skin tags, basal cell carcinomas, angiomas, and melanocytic naevi were assessed. RESULTS: The <b>cryoscopy</b> images of skin highlighted the skin lines. They appeared similar regardless of the freezing source and the application method. The aspects differed according {{to the nature of}} the lesions. The cotton chill tip method provided a longer whitening period compared with the other cold sources, both in normal and lesional skin. Hence, it represented the most convenient way for performing digital recording <b>cryoscopy.</b> On normal skin, cryoapplication was limited to about 1. 5 s due to pain, resulting in whitening times ranging from 6 to 9 s, which was too short for easy digital recording. On all studied skin tumors, a 10 -s N(2) freezing time was not experienced as painful, and blanching time persisted for 20 - 34 s, allowing easy digital recording. The whitening time was longer with increasing freezing time on both normal and lesional skin. Every single examined normal skin site and all the skin lesions showed a strong whitening effect, except heavily cornified structures, including some keratoses, callosities, and viral warts. Increased contrast of the skin surface texture was observed in almost every studied lesion. CONCLUSION: The N(2) cotton chill tip technique appeared to be the most convenient technique for <b>cryoscopy</b> and provided longer whitening periods compared with the other freezing sources. Pain prevented its use on normal skin, but a series of exophytic skin lesions was conveniently accessible to <b>cryoscopy.</b> The differences in whitening periods of various epidermal components resulted in increased visual contrast, creating typical <b>cryoscopy</b> images for the different exophytic skin tumors. <b>Cryoscopy</b> represents a novel in vivo skin imaging technique that is rapid, non-invasive, cost-effective, and easily performed. It shows both investigative and diagnostic potentials. It is remarkable that <b>cryoscopy</b> pictures closely resemble those yielded by skin capacitance imaging. Peer reviewe...|$|E

Thus, this study aimed to evaluate the quality of milk in artisanal cheese factories in Rio Grande do Norte, Brazil. Fifty samples were collected from areas that stand out in dairy production in the state. These samples underwent microbiological and physical–chemical analysis, as well as antibiotic residue and fraud searches. Viable strict and facultative mesophilic bacteria were surveyed, in addition to total and thermotolerant coliforms, Salmonella sp., and Staphylococcus aureus; titratable acidity in Dornic degrees, density, <b>cryoscopy,</b> stability to alizarol, and percentages of protein, lactose, and fat contents were also measured, and tests for residues and recurrent fraud in milk were conducted. In general, all samples exceeded the limit established by law for mesophilic bacteria counting; Salmonella sp. was found in one sample. Given this contamination, the acidity of 76 % of the samples was higher than allowed by the legislation. Regarding fat and protein parameters, 14 % and 10 % of the samples were below the required values by the legislation, respectively. Furthermore, there is suspicion of fraud by adding water in 24 % of samples. Chlorides were found in 16 % and antimicrobial residues in 46 % of samples.

40|$|UHT milk is {{the most}} {{consumed}} type of milk in Brazil. Its consumption has been increasing {{in the last years}} due to its easy storage and extended shelf life. The aim of this work was to verify microbiological and physico-chemical quality and also labeling from UHT milk commercialized in Londrina, in addition, carry out other analysis not required by legislation that may collaborate with quality evaluation of the product. For that, 33 UHT milk samples were evaluated for parameters established by law, as well as for other parameters which have no official standards. In fat analysis 18. 18 % of samples were out of standards; 33. 3 % of samples were acid; 6. 25 % of skimmed milk presented nonfat solids lower than the minimum; 21. 21 % samples presented mesophilic aerobe counts above acceptable. Concerning complementary analysis 30. 3 % of samples presented some level of gelation; <b>cryoscopy</b> of the majority of samples was incompatible with milk added with sodium citrate. Results show problems with UHT milk, together with analysis not required by legislation, what suggests that legislation should be complemented, establishing quality control parameters that allow evaluation of the major problems of this product. O leite UHT é o leite fluido mais consumido no Brasil. Esse consumo vem crescendo nos últimos anos devido a sua praticidade de armazenamento e longa vida útil. O objetivo desse trabalho foi verificar a qualidade microbiológica, físico-química e a rotulagem dos leites UHT comercializados em Londrina, além de realizar outras análises não especificadas na legislação que podem colaborar com a avaliação da qualidade do produto. Foram avaliadas 33 amostras de leite UHT quanto aos quesitos estipulados pela legislação, além de outras análises para as quais não há padrões oficiais. Na análise de gordura 18, 18 % das amostras estavam fora do padrão; 33, 3 % das amostras estavam ácidas; 6, 25 % dos leites desnatados estavam com o valor de SNG abaixo do mínimo; 21, 21 % amostras apresentaram contagens de aeróbios mesófilos acima do permitido. Quanto às análises complementares 30, 3 % das amostras apresentavam algum grau de geleificação; índice crioscópico da maioria das amostras não foi compatível com o leite adicionado de citrato de sódio. Na rotulagem foram encontradas poucas incompatibilidades com a legislação. Os resultados demonstram que há problemas com a qualidade do leite UHT, inclusive nas análises não estipuladas pela legislação, o que sugere que a legislação do leite UHT deve ser complementada, de modo a estabelecer parâmetros de controle de qualidade que possibilitem a avaliação dos principais problemas desse produto.

40|$|BACKGROUND Autosomal {{dominant}} {{polycystic kidney}} disease (ADPKD) {{is characterized by a}} decline in renal function at late disease stage when the majority of functional renal parenchyma is replaced by cystic tissue. Thus, kidney function, assessed by estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) does not well represent disease burden in early disease. Here, we investigated various urinary markers for tubular injury and their association with disease burden in ADPKD patients at early disease course. METHODS ADPKD patients between 18 and 40 years with an eGFR greater or equal to 70 ml per min per 1. 73 m 2 were eligible for this cross-sectional study. Urinary Neutrophil Gelatinase-Associated Lipocalin (NGAL), Kidney Injury Molecule- 1 (KIM- 1), and Uromodulin (UMOD) were investigated by Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay. Clara Cell Protein 16 (CC 16) was investigated by Latex Immuno Assay. <b>Cryoscopy</b> was performed to assess urine osmolality and Urinary Albumin-to-Creatinine Ratio (UACR) was calculated. The association and the predictive properties of the markers on eGFR and height adjusted total kidney volume (htTKV) was evaluated using multiple regression analysis, incorporating different control variables for adjustment. Internal bootstrapping validated the obtained results. RESULTS In 139 ADPKD patients (age 31 ± 7 years, mean eGFR of 93 ± 19 ml per min per 1. 73 m 2) the total kidney volume was negatively correlated with eGFR and UMOD and positive associated with age, UACR, KIM- 1 and urine osmolality after adjustment for possible confounders. Urine osmolality and htTKV were also associated with eGFR, whereas no association of CC 16, NGAL and UMOD with eGFR or htTKV was found. CONCLUSION UACR and urinary KIM- 1 are independently associated with kidney size but not with renal function in our study population. Urine osmolality was associated with eGFR and kidney volume following adjustment for multiple confounders. Despite statistical significance, the clinical value of our results is not yet conceivable. Further studies are needed to evaluate the property of the aforementioned biomarkers to assess disease state at early ADPKD stage...|$|E
