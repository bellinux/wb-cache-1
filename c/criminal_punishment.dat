25|$|The punishments for corrupt {{practices}} {{fall into}} two broad categories: non-criminal sanctions, and criminal punishments. The reporting, by an election court, of a person as guilty of a corrupt practice renders them immediately liable to the non-criminal sanctions, and they may additionally be prosecuted and subjected to the criminal punishments (but if they are prosecuted and acquitted, then the non-criminal sanctions are revoked). Where the election was not challenged by a petition at the time, but suspected corrupt practices are subsequently identified, a criminal prosecution can be instigated (but only within one year of the election concerned), and anyone found guilty is subject to both <b>criminal</b> <b>punishment</b> and the non-criminal sanctions.|$|E

Furthermore, Economic Criminal Law in Nazi Germany justified severe punishments including {{the death penalty for}} violation of economic laws, by making economic orders a legally protected interest. Today, it is not permissible to impose <b>criminal</b> <b>punishments</b> without <b>criminal</b> procedure, in terms of separation of the powers and due process. Furthermore, it is not permissible to impose <b>criminal</b> <b>punishments</b> in the name of protecting an order because such punishments would result in abuse of <b>criminal</b> <b>punishments.</b> On the other hand, the use of non-criminal penalties by administrative agencies might be an effective means to guarantee enforcement.

25|$|State {{policy of}} social classes: The State enforces a rigidly {{stratified}} society with entrenched patterns of official discrimination. A citizen's potential success {{in life and}} the level of services provided by the State are predetermined by a State-assigned social class (songbun). Each individual's and family's designation is decided according to the apparatus' perception of their ideological loyalty to the regime. Discrimination applies to geographic segregation, occupation, <b>criminal</b> <b>punishment,</b> and access to food, housing, health care, and education. Applying intergenerational responsibility and collective punishment, a family's social class (songbun) is passed down to its children and grandchildren. Each individual's status is recorded in a registration system, inaccessible to him or her. The lowest songbun was given to groups including former wealthy industrialists, alleged spies, Catholics, Buddhists, and South Korean prisoners of war.|$|E

500|$|The {{derogatory}} term [...] "fan" [...] (Chinese: 番) {{was often}} {{used against the}} Plains Aborigines by the Taiwanese. The Hoklo Taiwanese term was forced upon Aborigines like the Pazeh. A racist, anti-Aboriginal slur was also used by Chiu Yi-ying, a DPP Taiwanese legislator. Chiu Yi-ying said the racist words were intended for Aboriginal KMT members. The Aborigines in the KMT slammed President Tsai over the <b>criminal</b> <b>punishment</b> of a hunter of Bunun Aboriginal background. In response to the [...] "apology" [...] ceremony held by Tsai, KMT Aboriginals refused to attend. Aboriginals demanded that recompense from Tsai to accompany the apology. Aboriginal protestors slammed Tsai for not implementing sovereignty for Aboriginals and not using actions {{to back up the}} apology. The Taipei Times ran an editorial in 2008 that rejected the idea of an apology to the Aborigines, and rejected the idea of comparing Australian Aborigines' centuries of 'genocidal' suffering by White Australians to the suffering of Aborigines in Taiwan.|$|E

5000|$|Colonial American jails {{were not}} the [...] "ordinary {{mechanism}} of correction" [...] for criminal offenders, according to social historian David Rothman. Criminal incarceration as a penal sanction was [...] "plainly a second choice," [...] either a supplement to or a substitute for traditional <b>criminal</b> <b>punishments</b> of the day, {{in the words of}} historian Adam J. Hirsch. Eighteenth-century criminal codes provided for a far wider range of <b>criminal</b> <b>punishments</b> than contemporary state and federal criminal laws in the United States.

2500|$|Law {{enforcement}} in the United States {{is one of}} three major components {{of the criminal justice system}} of the United States, along with courts and corrections.

2500|$|The use {{of prisons}} in Continental Europe was never {{as popular as}} it became in the English-speaking world, {{although}} state prison systems were largely {{in place by the}} end of the 19th century in most European countries. After the unification of Italy in 1861, the government reformed the repressive and arbitrary prison system they inherited, and modernized and secularized <b>criminal</b> <b>punishment</b> by emphasizing discipline and deterrence.

2500|$|A term which preceded fǎ was xíng (刑), which {{originally}} probably {{referred to}} decapitation.

2500|$|The Constitutional Acts of 11 and 12 July 1940 {{granted to}} Pétain all powers (legislative, judicial, administrative, {{executive}} – and diplomatic) {{and the title}} of [...] "head of the French state" [...] (chef de l'État français), {{as well as the}} right to nominate his successor. On 12 July Pétain designated Laval as Vice-President and his designated successor, and appointed Fernand de Brinon as representative to the German High Command in Paris. Pétain remained the head of the Vichy regime until 20 August 1944. The French national motto, Liberté, Egalité, Fraternité (Freedom, Equality, Brotherhood), was replaced by Travail, Famille, Patrie (Work, Family, Fatherland); it was noted at the time that TFP also stood for the <b>criminal</b> <b>punishment</b> of [...] "travaux forcés à perpetuité" [...] ("forced labor in perpetuity").

2500|$|Like secular legal systems, the Church has at {{different}} times distinguished between various forms and elements of [...] "slavery", often in a highly theoretical way that has been unclear in its practical application.

[...] A distinction was long made between [...] "just" [...] and [...] "unjust" [...] slavery, and whether a particular slave was [...] "justly" [...] or [...] "unjustly" [...] kept in that condition could depend on his religious status.

2500|$|The {{judicial}} {{sense of}} the term [...] "homicide" [...] includes any intervention undertaken with the express intention of ending a life, even to relieve intractable suffering. Not all homicide is unlawful. Two designations of homicide that carry no <b>criminal</b> <b>punishment</b> are justifiable and excusable homicide. In most countries this is not the status of euthanasia. The term [...] "euthanasia" [...] is usually confined to the active variety; the University of Washington website states that [...] "euthanasia generally means that the physician would act directly, for instance by giving a lethal injection, to end the patient's life". Physician-assisted suicide is thus not classified as euthanasia by the US State of Oregon, where it is legal under the Oregon Death with Dignity Act, and despite its name, it is not legally classified as suicide either. Unlike physician-assisted suicide, withholding or withdrawing life-sustaining treatments with patient consent (voluntary) is almost unanimously considered, at least in the United States, to be legal. The use of pain medication to relieve suffering, even if it hastens death, has been held as legal in several court decisions.|$|E
2500|$|Christian {{people could}} be enslaved as a <b>criminal</b> <b>punishment,</b> or for debt, or sell {{themselves}} or their children. [...] In 655 the Ninth Council of Toledo, {{in an attempt to}} persuade priests to remain celibate, ruled that all children of clerics were to be automatically enslaved. This ruling was later incorporated into the canon law of the church, but seems rarely to have been enforced. [...] In 1089, Pope Urban II ruled at the Synod of Melfi that the wives of priests were to be enslaved. .... disabilities of all kinds were enacted and as far as possible enforced against the wives and children of ecclesiastics. Their offspring were declared to be of servile condition .... The earliest decree in which the children were declared to be slaves, the property of the Church, and never to be enfranchised, {{seems to have been a}} canon of the Synod of Pavia in 1018. Similar penalties were promulgated later on against the wives and concubines (see the Synod of Melfi, 1189, can. xii), who by the very fact of their unlawful connection with a subdeacon or clerk of higher rank became liable to be seized as slaves ...|$|E
2500|$|Critics have lambasted the United States for incarcerating a {{large number}} of non-violent and victimless offenders; half of all persons incarcerated under state {{jurisdiction}} are for non-violent offenses, and 20% are incarcerated for drug offenses (in state prisons; federal prison percentages are higher). [...] "Human Rights Watch believes the extraordinary rate of incarceration in the United States wreaks havoc on individuals, families and communities, and saps the strength of the nation as a whole." [...] The population of inmates housed in prisons and jails in the United States exceeds 2million, with the per capita incarceration population higher than that officially reported by any other country. Criminal justice policy in the United States has also been criticized for a number of other reasons.

We next showed you, that the whole landed interest, the zemindars, or Hindoo gentry of the country, was likewise ruined by its being given over, by letting it on a five years' lease, to infamous farmers, and giving it up to their merciless exactions,--and afterwards by subjecting the rank of those zemindars, their title-deeds, and all their pecuniary affairs, to the minutest scrutiny, under pain of <b>criminal</b> <b>punishment,</b> by a commission granted to a nefarious villain called Gunga Govind Sing. We lastly showed you that the remaining third class, that of the English, was partly corrupted, or had its authority dissolved, and that the whole superintending English control was subverted or subdued,--that the products of the country were diminished, and that the revenues of the Company were dilapidated, by an overcharge of expenses, in four years, to the amount of 500,000l., in consequence of these corrupt, dangerous, and mischievous projects.|$|E
