5|$|In {{homodyne}} detection, {{the interference}} occurs between two beams {{at the same}} wavelength (or <b>carrier</b> <b>frequency).</b> The phase {{difference between the two}} beams results in a change in the intensity of the light on the detector. The resulting intensity of the light after mixing of these two beams is measured, or the pattern of interference fringes is viewed or recorded. Most of the interferometers discussed in this article fall into this category.|$|E
5|$|Optical {{heterodyne}} detection {{is an essential}} technique used in high-accuracy measurements of the frequencies of optical sources, {{as well as in}} the stabilization of their frequencies. Until a relatively few years ago, lengthy frequency chains were needed to connect the microwave frequency of a cesium or other atomic time source to optical frequencies. At each step of the chain, a frequency multiplier would be used to produce a harmonic of the frequency of that step, which would be compared by {{heterodyne detection}} with the next step (the output of a microwave source, far infrared laser, infrared laser, or visible laser). Each measurement of a single spectral line required several years of effort in the construction of a custom frequency chain. Currently, optical frequency combs have provided a much simpler method of measuring optical frequencies. If a mode-locked laser is modulated to form a train of pulses, its spectrum is seen to consist of the <b>carrier</b> <b>frequency</b> surrounded by a closely spaced comb of optical sideband frequencies with a spacing equal to the pulse repetition frequency (Fig.16). The pulse repetition frequency is locked to that of the frequency standard, and the frequencies of the comb elements at the red end of the spectrum are doubled and heterodyned with the frequencies of the comb elements at the blue end of the spectrum, thus allowing the comb to serve as its own reference. In this manner, locking of the frequency comb output to an atomic standard can be performed in a single step. To measure an unknown frequency, the frequency comb output is dispersed into a spectrum. The unknown frequency is overlapped with the appropriate spectral segment of the comb and the frequency of the resultant heterodyne beats is measured.|$|E
25|$|Frequency {{modulation}} can {{be classified}} as narrowband if {{the change in the}} <b>carrier</b> <b>frequency</b> is about the same as the signal frequency, or as wideband if the change in the <b>carrier</b> <b>frequency</b> is much higher (modulation indexnbsp&>nbsp&1) than the signal frequency.|$|E

30|$|The two GNSS, GPS and GLONASS, have {{a similar}} {{performance}} for both analysis methods. However, there are some built-in differences for the two systems: the number of orbiting satellites, which is higher for GPS, and the multiple access technique used. The former impacts, for the SNR analysis, the number of possible sea level solutions per day and, for the phase delay analysis, the robustness of each sea level solution (number of observations in the least-squares solution). The two multiple access techniques used for GPS and GLONASS are {{code division multiple access}} (CDMA) and frequency division multiple access (FDMA), respectively. This means that all GPS satellites use the same L 1 and L 2 <b>carrier</b> <b>frequencies,</b> whereas GLONASS satellites have slightly different <b>carrier</b> <b>frequencies,</b> separated by multiples of 562.5 and 437.5 kHz for L 1 and L 2, respectively. Furthermore, the GPS <b>carrier</b> <b>frequencies</b> are lower than the GLONASS <b>carrier</b> <b>frequencies.</b>|$|R

25|$|Radio {{transmitters}} work {{by mixing}} a radio frequency (RF) signal {{of a specific}} frequency, the carrier wave, with the signal to be broadcast. The result {{is a set of}} frequencies with a strong peak signal at the <b>carrier</b> <b>frequency,</b> and smaller signals from the <b>carrier</b> <b>frequency</b> plus the maximum frequency of the signal, and the <b>carrier</b> <b>frequency</b> minus the maximum frequency of the signal. That is, the resulting signal has a spectrum with twice the bandwidth of the original input signal. In conventional AM radio, this signal is then sent to the radio frequency amplifier, and then to the broadcast antenna. Due {{to the nature of the}} amplification process, the quality of the resulting signal can be defined by the difference between the maximum and minimum signal energy. Normally the maximum signal energy will be the carrier itself, perhaps twice as powerful as the mixed signals.|$|E

25|$|If we {{just look}} at the {{short-term}} spectrum of modulation, changing as it would for a human voice for instance, then we can plot the frequency content (horizontal axis) as a function of time (vertical axis) as in Fig. 3. It can again be seen that as the modulation frequency content varies, at any point in time there is an upper sideband generated according to those frequencies shifted above the <b>carrier</b> <b>frequency,</b> and the same content mirror-imaged in the lower sideband below the <b>carrier</b> <b>frequency.</b> At all times, the carrier itself remains constant, and of greater power than the total sideband power.|$|E
