30|$|Crude extract of C. <b>carandas</b> {{possesses}} laxative and antidiarrheal properties mediated through {{combinations of}} gut stimulant and inhibitory activities. The gut stimulant potential of C. <b>carandas</b> was found mediated through combination of muscarinic and histaminergic receptors activation, while its gut inhibitory activity was observed mediated through antagonistic pathway. This study provides {{a rationale for}} the medicinal use of C. <b>carandas</b> in constipation and diarrhea [67]. The roots of C. <b>carandas</b> and C. spinarum are used as a purgative and as an antidote for snakebite, and the leaves for remittent fever [68]. In vitro inhibitory activity of leaf extracts of C. spinarum in non-polar and polar solvents was determined against Bungarus caeruleus and Vipera russelli toxic snake venom enzymes. Methanol extracts (100  μg/mL) inhibited acetylcholinesterase, phospholipase A 2, hyaluronidase, phosphomonoesterase, phosphodiesterase, 5 ′-nucleotidase enzymes of B. caeruleus and V. russelli venoms [69].|$|R

The antipyretic activity was evaluated by Brewer’s yeast induced pyrexia in rats. Ethanol and aqueous extracts from roots of C. <b>carandas</b> exhibited significant (P <  0.01) analgesic, anti-inflammatory and antipyretic activities at doses of 100 and 200  mg/kg body weight. In analgesic activity, {{the highest percentage of}} inhibition of abdominal constriction (72.67 %) was observed for ethanol extracts of C. <b>carandas</b> at a dose of 100  mg/kg body weight. The ethanol and aqueous extracts from C. <b>carandas</b> were found to reduce significantly the formation of edema induced by carrageenan after 2  h. Both the extracts of C. <b>carandas</b> showed significant antipyretic activities on yeast induced hyperpyrexia in rats after 2  h. The results of this study indicated that the ethanol and aqueous extracts from the roots of C. <b>carandas</b> possess significant analgesic, anti-inflammatory and antipyretic activities in rodent models [55]. In a separate study to investigate the anti-inflammatory potential of root methanol extracts of C. <b>carandas</b> involving bioassay guided fractionation of extract based on inhibitory potential towards proinflammatory mediators (TNF-a, IL- 1 b and NO), it was found out that lupeol (1), oleanolic acid (15), carissone (26), stigmasterol (86), and scopoletin (104) possess potential anti-inflammatory agents. Carissone (26) and scopoletin (104) exhibited significant inhibition of NO production comparable to specific NO inhibitor without affecting the cell viability [56]. C. spinarum has been used traditionally for the treatment of inflammation-related disorders such as rheumatic pain and to relieve fever. Based on this information, ethanolic extract of the roots of C. spinarum was evaluated for its antipyretic activity. Wistar albino rats were induced with Brewer’s yeast (2  mL/kg) for pyrexia and antipyretic activity was assessed with 100, 200 and 400  mg/kg ethanolic extract.

Significant hepatoprotective effects were obtained against liver damage induced by all the three toxins, as indicated by changed biochemical parameters like serum transaminases, alkaline phosphate, total bilirubin, total protein, and total cholesterol. The ethyl acetate fraction prevented toxin-induced oxidative stress by significantly maintaining the levels of reduced glutathione and malondialdehyde, and a normal functioning of the liver, compared to toxin controls [38]. C. <b>carandas</b> root extract is used by tribal healers of Western Ghat region of Karnataka as hepatoprotective and antihyperglycemic [60].

40|$|Ethnopharmacological {{relevance}} Carissa <b>carandas</b> Linn. {{commonly known}} as “Karaunda” (Apocynaceae) is a popular medicinal herb widely distributed {{in different parts of}} Pakistan. In addition to other medicinal uses, Carissa <b>carandas</b> is popular in indigenous system of medicine for its medicinal use in gut motility disorders like, constipation and diarrhea. Objective This study was planned to provide pharmacological basis to the medicinal use of Carissa <b>carandas</b> in constipation and diarrhea. Materials and methods The crude extract of the leaves of Carissa <b>carandas</b> (Cc. Cr) was prepared in methanol and its fractionation was carried out with ethylacetate, petroleum ether and n-butanol. In-vivo studies were conducted on mice, while isolated rabbit jejunum and guinea-pig ileum preparations were used for the in-vitro experiments. The spasmogenic and spasmolytic responses of gut tissues were recorded using isotonic transducers coupled with PowerLab data acquisition system. Results The HPLC fingerprints of Cc. Cr, its petroleum (Cc. Pef), ethylacetate (Cc. Eaf) and n-butanol (Cc. Baf) fractions showed the presence of oleanolic acid, ursolic acid, stigmasterol and β-sitosterol. Oral administration of Cc. Cr to mice increased fecal output at lower doses (30 and 50 mg/kg), while it showed protection against castor oil-induced diarrhea at higher doses (300 and 600 mg/kg). In isolated guinea-pig ileum and rabbit jejunum, Cc. Cr and Cc. Baf exhibited stimulatory effect at 0. 003 – 3 mg/ml, which was partially sensitive to atropine or pyrillamine or partially/fully sensitive to atropine+pyrillamine, followed by relaxation at higher tested concentrations, being more potent in rabbit tissues. The ethylacetate fraction (0. 1 – 5 mg/ml) exhibited fully atropine-sensitive contractions in both guinea-pig and rabbit tissues, being more potent in guinea-pig while more efficacious in rabbit tissues. However, the petroleum fraction (0. 003 – 1. 0 mg/ml) showed only spasmolytic activity in spontaneously contracting rabbit tissues, similar to nifedipine. In guinea-tissue, Cc. Pef did not cause any stimulant effect. When studied against high K+ (80 mM) -induced contraction, the crude extract and its fractions caused a dose-dependent inhibition, with the following order of potency: Cc. Pef 3 ̆eCc. Eaf 3 ̆eCc. Cr≥Cc. Baf, similar to nifedipine indicating Ca++ channel antagonist like activity, which was further confirmed when the plant extract displaced Ca++ curves to the right with suppression of maximum effect similar to that of nifedipine. Conclusion This study demonstrates that the crude extract of Carissa <b>carandas</b> possesses a gut-stimulatory effect mediated primarily through the activation of muscarinic and histaminergic receptors while its spasmolytic effect was mediated possibly through Ca++ antagonist pathway. Thus, this study provides a clear evidence for the dual effectiveness of Carissa <b>carandas</b> in constipation and diarrhea, thus validating its medicinal use...|$|R
