2500|$|F-106C : Unbuilt version. Aircraft was {{intended}} to have the AN/ASG-18 radar and fire control system fitted originally developed for the North American XF-108 Rapier.

The design featured an improved raised canopy design featuring better visibility, canards and lengthened rectangular inlet ducts. The aircraft was to be capable of carrying one GAR-9/AIM-47A in its <b>center</b> <b>bay</b> and one AIM-26A in each side bay.
