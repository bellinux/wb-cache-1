5|$|Final Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn is an MMORPG and {{features}} a persistent {{world in which}} players can {{interact with each other}} and the environment. Players create and customize their characters for use in the game, including name, race, gender, facial features, and starting class. Unlike in the original release, players may only choose to be a Disciple of War or Magic as a starting class—Disciples of the Hand and Land are initially unavailable. Players must also select a game world for characters to exist on. While servers are not explicitly delineated by language, data centers have been placed in the supported regions (i.e., North America, Europe, Japan) to improve the communication latency between the server and the <b>client</b> <b>computer</b> and players are recommended to choose a server in their region. Regardless of server or language, the game features a large library of automatically translated game terms and general phrases which allow players who speak different languages to communicate.|$|E
25|$|JavaScript and the DOM {{provide the}} {{potential}} for malicious authors to deliver scripts to run on a <b>client</b> <b>computer</b> via the Web. Browser authors contain this risk using two restrictions. First, scripts run in a sandbox {{in which they can}} only perform Web-related actions, not general-purpose programming tasks like creating files. Second, scripts are constrained by the same-origin policy: scripts from one Web site {{do not have access to}} information such as usernames, passwords, or cookies sent to another site. Most JavaScript-related security bugs are breaches of either the same origin policy or the sandbox.|$|E
25|$|On January 15, 2008, Apple {{introduced}} Time Capsule, an AirPort Extreme (802.11 Draft-N) with {{an internal}} hard drive. The device includes software to allow any computer running a reasonably recent version of Mac OS or Windows {{to access the}} disk as a shared volume. Macs running Mac OS X 10.5 and later, which includes the Time Machine feature, can use the Time Capsule as a wireless backup device, allowing automatic, untethered backups of the <b>client</b> <b>computer.</b> As an access point, the unit is otherwise equivalent to an AirPort Extreme (802.11 Draft-N), with four Gigabit Ethernet ports and a USB port for printer and disk sharing.|$|E
30|$|The {{enterprise}} systems {{must have}} {{prior knowledge of}} the characteristics of all their <b>client</b> <b>computers.</b> On the one hand, a single image for all <b>client</b> <b>computers</b> may not be a viable solution as different clients may have different requirements. On the other hand, the maintenance and management of all <b>client</b> <b>computers</b> with a variety of configurations that meets the requirements of TCG attestation protocol is difficult and challenging.|$|R

50|$|The Alerter {{service is}} a Microsoft Windows service {{which is used to}} send {{administrative}} alerts. It alerts users about security, access, and user session problems. Alert messages are sent from a server to a <b>client</b> <b>computer,</b> and the Windows Messenger service must be running on the <b>client</b> <b>computer</b> for the user to receive alert messages.|$|E

50|$|When {{connecting}} to IRC, the <b>client</b> <b>computer</b> typically makes an outgoing connection on port 6667 (or any port {{in the range}} 6660-7000), causing the IRC server to attempt to verify the username given by making a new connection back to the <b>client</b> <b>computer</b> on port 113. When the computer is behind a NAT, the NAT silently drops this connection {{because it does not}} know to which computer behind the NAT it should send the request to connect.|$|E

50|$|This code {{is run by}} the <b>client</b> <b>computer,</b> and {{the results}} are used by other code to make {{necessary}} adjustments on client-side. In this example, the <b>client</b> <b>computer</b> is asked to determine whether the browser can use a feature called ActiveX. Since this feature was proprietary to Microsoft, a positive result will indicate that the client may be running Microsoft's Internet Explorer. This is no longer a reliable indicator since Microsoft's open-source release of the ActiveX code, however, meaning that it can be used by any browser.|$|E
