In other words, {{the behavior of the}} process in the future is stochastically independent of its behavior in the past, given {{the current state of the}} process.|$|E

5|$|Miller and Pflueger were {{selected}} in 1923 {{to build an}} expansive new headquarters tower for Pacific Telephone & Telegraph. In June 1924, Pflueger showed his plans for a $3million skyscraper, 26 stories high, designed with continuous vertical elements and a progression of step-backs narrowing the floors near the top. Arthur Frank Mathews {{was brought in to}} paint a mural in the boardroom on the 18th floor. The structure was fully devoted to offices for 2,000 employees, mostly female. Pflueger's vision was strongly influenced by Eliel Saarinen's second-place entry in the competition to design the Tribune Tower in Chicago. In June, 1925, the Pacific Telephone & Telegraph Company Building was completed for $4million ($million in <b>current</b> <b>value),</b> becoming the tallest building in San Francisco for the next 40 years, tied by the Russ Building in 1927.|$|E
5|$|One CMPC {{shooting}} {{location was}} on family property near Boulder Creek, California where Middleton's father {{had established a}} timber holding {{now known as the}} Middleton Tract. Other filming locations included undeveloped portions of Sonoma, Santa Cruz and Marin counties. In San Rafael, the studio boasted a large glass-walled and -roofed building that let in light but not wind so that shooting for indoor scenes could take place in full light without the telltale flapping of tablecloths and clothing blown by gusts. Considered expensive at the time, the company used a 1,250 Bell & Howell movie camera, worth about $ in <b>current</b> <b>value.</b> The camera held two reels of film so that two negatives were made of each scene. A second $700 camera provided a third reel of the same scene, from another perspective.|$|E
5|$|As non-fusing helium ash accumulates in {{the core}} of a main-sequence star, the {{reduction}} in the abundance of hydrogen per unit mass results in a gradual lowering of the fusion rate within that mass. Since it is the outflow of fusion-supplied energy that supports the higher layers of the star, the core is compressed, producing higher temperatures and pressures. Both factors increase the rate of fusion thus moving the equilibrium towards a smaller, denser, hotter core producing more energy whose increased outflow pushes the higher layers further out. Thus there is a steady increase in the luminosity and radius of the star over time. For example, the luminosity of the early Sun was only about 70% of its <b>current</b> <b>value.</b> As a star ages this luminosity increase changes its position on the HR diagram. This effect results in a broadening of the main sequence band because stars are observed at random stages in their lifetime. That is, the main sequence band develops a thickness on the HR diagram; it is not simply a narrow line.|$|E
40|$|Critical {{current of}} bent-damaged Bi 2223 {{composite}} tape differs from specimen to specimen. To describe the distributed critical <b>current</b> <b>values</b> of specimens, the three-parameter Weibull distribution function has been employed {{and has been}} demonstrated to describe the experimental results. In the present work, {{the reason for this}} was discussed by modeling analysis of the experimental results in a round robin test of VAMAS/TWA 16. The distribution of the measured normalized critical <b>current</b> <b>values</b> was described well by using the damage evolution approach, in which the difference in damage evolution among the specimens was correlated to the distribution of critical <b>current</b> <b>values.</b> From this approach, the three-parameter Weibull distribution function for critical <b>current</b> <b>values</b> was derived, which gave almost the same parameter values for the minimum critical current, scale parameter and shape parameter as those obtained by the direct application of the Weibull distribution function to the experimental results. Based on this result, the reason why the normalized critical <b>current</b> <b>values</b> of bent-damaged composite tape is described by the three-parameter Weibull distribution function was accounted for in a quantitative manner by the difference in damage evolution among the specimens...|$|R

She happened to be visiting Dublin in 1884, when Wilde was lecturing at the Gaiety Theatre. He proposed to her, and they married on 29 May 1884 at the Anglican St James's Church, Paddington in London. Constance's annual allowance of £250 was generous for a young woman (equivalent to about £ in <b>current</b> <b>value),</b> but the Wildes had relatively luxurious tastes, and they had preached to others for so long {{on the subject of}} design that people expected their home to set new standards. No. 16, Tite Street was duly renovated in seven months at considerable expense. The couple had two sons, Cyril (1885) and Vyvyan (1886). Wilde became the sole literary signatory of George Bernard Shaw's petition for a pardon of the anarchists arrested (and later executed) after the Haymarket massacre in Chicago in 1886.|$|E

Mara had run the day-to-day operations under Bob Tisch's supervision in the years leading up to his father's death. Forbes magazine estimates the 2010 value of the team at $1.183 billion. This ranks them fourth in the 30 team league in terms of value.

Operating revenue was $26.7 million, and player salary was $97 million. The team finished second to the Redskins in the NFL in attendance in 2006, 2007, and 2008, drawing 628,910, 629,848, and 632,554 respectively.
