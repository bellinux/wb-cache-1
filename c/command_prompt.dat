25|$|In Unix-like systems the $ {{is often}} {{part of the}} <b>command</b> <b>prompt,</b> {{depending}} on the user's shell and environment settings. For example, the default environment settings for the bash shell specify $ {{as part of the}} <b>command</b> <b>prompt.</b>|$|E
25|$|A CCP {{internal}} command, of {{the form}} drive letter followed by a colon, {{could be used to}} select the default drive. For example, typing B: and pressing enter at the <b>command</b> <b>prompt</b> would change the default drive to B, and the <b>command</b> <b>prompt</b> would then become B> to indicate this change.|$|E

25|$|Windows Vista {{includes}} {{context menu}} commands for folders {{to open a}} <b>command</b> <b>prompt</b> at the selected folder and to copy their path. Shortcut items have a context menu to open their target location. A sound event and shell overlay icon are also present for User Account Control.|$|E
25|$|By default, Microsoft Windows refreshes {{its policy}} {{settings}} every 90 minutes with a random 30 minutes offset. On Domain controllers, Microsoft Windows does so every five minutes. During the refresh, it discovers, fetches and applies all GPOs {{that apply to}} the machine and to logged-on users. Some settings - such as those for automated software installation, drive mappings, startup scripts or logon scripts - only apply during startup or user logon. Since Windows XP, users can manually initiate a refresh of the group policy by using the gpupdate command from a <b>command</b> <b>prompt.</b>|$|E
500|$|The {{popularity}} of Microsoft Security Essentials {{has led to}} the appearance of malware abusing its name. In February 2010, a rogue security package calling itself [...] "Security Essentials 2010" [...] appeared on the Internet. Designated TrojanDownloader:Win32/Fakeinit by Microsoft, it bears no visual resemblance to the Microsoft product. It reappeared in November 2010, this time calling itself [...] "Microsoft Security Essentials 2011". A more dangerous rogue appeared in August 2010. Designated Rogue:Win32/FakePAV or Unknown Win32/Trojan, it closely resembles Microsoft Security Essentials and uses sophisticated social engineering to deceive users and infect their systems, under the guise of five different fictional anti-malware products. It also terminates and prevents the launch of 156 different programs, including Registry Editor, Windows <b>Command</b> <b>Prompt,</b> Internet Explorer, Mozilla Firefox, Opera, Safari and Google Chrome.|$|E
2500|$|The Bloomberg {{keyboard}} {{includes a}} unique [...] key which navigates {{back to the}} previous function used. [...] If no previous commands are found, [...] displays a list of related functions. [...] Similarly, the History key will populate the command-line with previously used functions in reverse chronological order, as the Up arrow key function does in certain <b>command</b> <b>prompts.</b>|$|R
50|$|Operation of the {{software}} typically involves loading a table of data and applying statistical functions from pull-down menus or (in versions starting from 9.0) from the ribbon bar. The menus then prompt for the variables to be included {{and the type of}} analysis required. It is not necessary to type <b>command</b> <b>prompts.</b> Each analysis may include graphical or tabular output and is stored in a separate workbook.|$|R
5000|$|... p0f {{does not}} have a {{graphical}} user interface. It is instead run from the <b>command</b> line <b>prompt.</b>|$|R

50|$|Prior to Windows Vista, all I/O {{requests}} were capped at 64 KB; thus larger operations had to {{be completed}} in chunks. In Windows Vista, there is no limit on the size of I/O requests. This means an entire I/O operation can be completed by issuing fewer requests, which in turn may lead to higher performance. Windows Explorer and the <b>Command</b> <b>Prompt's</b> copy <b>command</b> have been modified to issue 1 MB requests.|$|R
25|$|Al Jalil's {{commentary}} to the Expressen {{came during}} widespread political unrest and protests in Libya {{calling for the}} removal of Ghaddafi from power. The protests were part of a massive wave of unprecedented uprisings across the Arab world in: Tunisia, Morocco, Bahrain and Egypt, where Egyptian protesters effectively forced the removal of long-term ruler, Hosni Mubarak, from office. Jalil's comments came on a day when Ghaddafi's defiance and refusal to leave his <b>command</b> <b>prompted</b> his brutal attacks on Libyan protesters.|$|R
50|$|Barbiano's Compagnia di San Giorgio ("St. George Company") renovated the {{military}} {{style of the}} mercenary companies of the period, with sharply improved cavalry armor and tactics, and with a strong attention paid to the training aspect. Famous condottieri like Facino Cane, Jacopo dal Verme, Braccio da Montone and Muzio Attendolo began their military career in the St. George Company. Starting with 200 men, Alberico could soon boast 4,000 soldiers under his <b>command,</b> <b>prompting</b> a quick decline of the foreign companies that had dominated the Italian grounds till that moment.|$|R
2500|$|Version 8.0 (Windows XP) – DOS boot disks {{created by}} XP and later contain files from Windows ME. The [...] "VER" [...] {{internal}} <b>command</b> <b>prompt</b> reports the Windows version 5.1.|$|E

2500|$|Version 7.1 (Windows 95B – Windows 98 – Windows 98SE) [...] – Support for FAT32 file system. [...] Last {{general purpose}} DOS to load Windows. The [...] "VER" [...] {{internal}} <b>command</b> <b>prompt</b> reports the Windows version 4.00.1111, 4.10.1998 or 4.10.2222.|$|E
25|$|Increasing {{pressure}} {{over the}} results of the first Royal Commission, along with allegations by former Voyager executive officer Peter Cabban that Captain Duncan Stevens was unfit for <b>command,</b> <b>prompted</b> a second Royal Commission in 1967: the only time in Australian history that two Royal Commissions have been held to investigate the same incident. Although Cabban's claims revolved primarily around Stevens' drinking to excess, the second Royal Commission found that Stevens was unfit to command for medical reasons. Consequently, the findings of the first Royal Commission were based on incorrect assumptions, and Robertson and his officers were not to blame for the collision.|$|R
25|$|After {{arriving}} {{at his new}} location, Sulayman sent notice of his movements to 'Ali ibn Muhammad, who approved and ordered him to send any food supplies and animals back to the central Zanj camp. This caused a dispute to break out between Sulayman, who attempted to send the supplies back on barges, and al-Jubba'i, who believed that any supplies they found should be burned in order to deny their use by the government. Al-Jubba'i began ignoring Sulayman's <b>commands,</b> <b>prompting</b> the latter to write to 'Ali and complain. The Zanj leader therefore intervened and sent orders to al-Jubba'i, instructing him to obey Sulayman and follow his commands.|$|R
5000|$|In a {{collaboration}} of ASUS hardware and the Xandros operating system, the first [...] "netbook" [...] came into being. The ASUS Eee PC was available with either Xandros or Windows XP. The installed version of Xandros is tab based, built from scratch using Xlib and the Qt 4.5 toolkit. The full desktop version (or [...] "Advanced Mode") may be installed - {{but not always}} easily - {{through a set of}} administrative <b>command</b> <b>prompts.</b> The full desktop version features a KDE 3 desktop with a few modifications performed by Xandros. This desktop mode also provides access to the Synaptic Package Manager which can be used to update and manage the Eee PC's software.|$|R
2500|$|Win32 console {{applications}} use CMD.EXE {{as their}} <b>command</b> <b>prompt</b> shell. [...] This confusion {{does not exist}} under OS/2 because there are separate DOS and OS/2 prompts, and running a DOS program under OS/2 will launch a separate DOS window to run the application.|$|E
2500|$|Similarly, {{corrupted}} registry files, {{system files}} or boot files can be restored from the command line. Windows 95 and Windows 98 can be started from DOS Mode by typing 'WIN' [...] at the <b>command</b> <b>prompt.</b> [...] However, the Recovery Console for Windows 2000, which as {{a version of}} Windows NT played a similar role in removing viruses.|$|E
2500|$|Notepad is {{a common}} text-only (plain text) editor. The {{resulting}} files—typically saved with the [...]txt extension—have no format tags or styles, making the program suitable for editing system files to use in a DOS environment and, occasionally, source code for later compilation or execution, usually through a <b>command</b> <b>prompt.</b> It is also useful for its negligible use of system resources; making for quick load time and processing time, especially on under-powered hardware.|$|E
50|$|Once booted, {{these systems}} provide a UNIX/Linux <b>command</b> line <b>prompt</b> (generally as the root user). Some also provide some very compact {{graphical}} user interface (GUI) tools. The LNX-BBC includes a small X (X Window System) server and a web browser called BrowseX (among other tools).|$|R
50|$|The POSIX {{standard}} specifies its standard shell as {{a strict}} {{subset of the}} Korn shell, an enhanced version of the Bourne shell. From a user's perspective the Bourne shell was immediately recognized when active by its characteristic default <b>command</b> line <b>prompt</b> character, the dollar sign ($).|$|R
50|$|The default {{behavior}} of the mv and cp commands is to clobber their destination file if it already exists. This behavior may be overridden by invoking or aliasing the commands with the -i switch, causing the <b>commands</b> to <b>prompt</b> the user before overwriting the destination file.|$|R
2500|$|Version 7.0 (Windows 95, Windows 95A) – Support for VFAT long file {{names and}} 32-bits signed integer errorlevel. [...] New editor. [...] JO.SYS is an {{alternative}} filename of the IO.SYS kernel file and used as such for [...] "special purposes". JO.SYS allows booting from either CD-ROM drive or hard disk. Last version to recognize only the first 8.4 GB of a hard disk. The [...] "VER" [...] internal <b>command</b> <b>prompt</b> reports the Windows version 4.00.950.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>Command</b> <b>Prompt</b> {{is often}} called the MS-DOS prompt. [...] In part, this was the {{official}} name for it in Windows 9x and early versions of Windows NT (NT 3.5 and earlier), {{and in part because}} the SoftPC emulation of DOS redirects output into it. [...] Actually only COMMAND.COM and other 16bit commands run in a NTVDM with AUTOEXEC.NT and CONFIG.NT initialisation determined by _default.pif, optionally permitting the use of Win32 console applications and internal commands with a NTCMDPROMPT directive.|$|E
2500|$|SQLCMD is {{a command}} line {{application}} {{that comes with}} Microsoft SQL Server, and exposes the management features of SQL Server. It allows SQL queries to be written and executed from the <b>command</b> <b>prompt.</b> It can also act as a scripting language to create and run a set of SQL statements as a script. Such scripts are stored as a [...]sql file, and are used either for management of databases or to create the database schema during the deployment of a database.|$|E

5000|$|Edwin Budgett (1829-1849). He was {{a healthy}} {{young man who}} died {{suddenly}} of Cholera. William Arthur, presumably quoting {{a member of the}} family, wrote, [...] "Frank, vivacious, open, with a clear head, a quick glance, a <b>commanding</b> look, <b>prompt,</b> firm action, a hearty laugh, a mellow voice, and a musical taste which .... would sometimes make the place joyful....".|$|R
5000|$|Once {{downloaded}} from XMLStarlet you can {{extract the}} zip file into a directory {{and run the}} XMLStarlet utility.
