25|$|The next {{match was}} the Tag Team Turmoil {{match for the}} World Tag Team Championship. Tajiri and William Regal were the champions heading into the match. The teams would <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>at</b> random, and it was The Heart Throbs who entered first, with the champions Tajiri and Regal coming out next. Tajiri {{utilized}} a lot of kicks and then locked in the Tarantula. The Heart Throbs then kept Tajiri isolated, but Tajiri pinned Antonio with a sunset flip. Simon Dean and Maven entered into the match next, trying to pick apart the weakened Tajiri. Their inclusion in the match did not last very long as Regal made the tag and cleaned house, putting Dean away with a knee to the head. La Résistance came in next, but Regal and Tajiri tried to fight back. Regal was then rolled up, {{with a handful of}} tights, eliminating he and Tajiri and guaranteeing new champions. Rosey and The Hurricane were the last two men to enter the match. Hurricane was then smashed on the turnbuckle post. Hurricane and Rosey got the pin when Hurricane leapt off the shoulders of Rosey, who was perched on the top rope to grab the win.|$|E

25|$|In the box T are two wheels (as in Dr Long's sphere) and two pinions, whose axes <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>at</b> V and U; {{either of}} which may be turned by the small winch W. When the winch is put upon the axis V, and turn backward, the {{terrestrial}} globe, with its horizon and celestial meridian, keep at rest; and the whole sphere of circles turns round from east, by south, to west, carrying the sun Y, and moon Z, round the same way, and causing them to rise above and set below the horizon. But when the winch is put upon the axis U, and turned forward, the sphere with the sun and moon keep at rest; and the earth, with its horizon and meridian, turn round from horizon to the sun and moon, to which these bodies came when the earth kept at rest, and they were carried round it; showing that they rise and set in the same points of the horizon, and at the same times in the hour circle, whether the motion be in the earth or in the heaven. If the earthly globe be turned, the hour-index goes round its hour-circle; but if the sphere be turned, the hour-circle goes round below the index.|$|E

500|$|Unlike other hip-hop musicians, Whodini's backing {{music and}} beats were synthesizer-based. Escape {{contains}} tracks with minimal musical backing, such as [...] "Big Mouth" [...] and [...] "Friends", and faster-paced music such as [...] "Escape (I Need a Break)". Hutchins {{believed that the}} Fender Jazz Bass was part of Whodini's signature sound, and used it on [...] "Five Minutes of Funk". Escape lyrics are generally egocentric, but also explored the difficulty of city life ("Escape (I Need a Break)"), failed romance ("Friends") and New York's party lifestyle ("Freaks <b>Come</b> <b>Out</b> <b>at</b> Night").|$|E
500|$|During the Second World War Forglen was {{one area}} that had an Auxiliary Unit Patrol. Auxiliary Units were a top-secret {{resistance}} organisation formed down the entire {{eastern side of the}} UK. If Germany ever invaded, the patrol would go into hiding in an Operational Base. When the invasion was one to two weeks old, and things settled down, the patrol would <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>at</b> night and undertake guerilla warfare. Members of the patrols were trained as explosives experts and were well armed compared to the conventional British Army. [...] Research by Coleshill Auxiliary Research Team has identified the patrol members and an approximate location of the operational base in the estate.|$|E
500|$|Daniels is {{openly gay}} {{and lives in}} south London. He once remarked: [...] "Out? I've never been in." [...] He lives with actor Ian Gelder. They began seeing each other during a 1993 {{production}} of Joe Orton's Entertaining Mr Sloane. Daniels was already sure of his sexuality in his teens, {{although he did not}} discuss the matter with his parents because they did not have a very close emotional relationship. He was [...] "cautious about mentioning it when I left drama school, because AIDS was terrifying everyone and there was a huge homophobic backlash". He decided to <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>at</b> the age of 24, while appearing in an all-star benefit performance of Martin Sherman's Bent.|$|E
50|$|Another caution {{happened}} as Gary Bettenhausen crashed at turn 4 at lap 84. He retired. Restart <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>at</b> lap 97. At lap 109, after 3 pitstops {{in just a}} few laps, Robby Gordon retired.

He retired because his right-front suspension was very damaged. Restart happened at lap 132, with Zanardi leading the rest of the field, but the restart did not happen, as André Ribeiro was relocated to the lead lap, and Eddie Lawson lost one lap. Restart happened again at lap 139. The 8th caution of the day <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>at</b> lap 145 as Jeff Krosnoff retired after having an engine problems.

500|$|The {{record has}} been called [...] "rhythm & blues-based rap", and has been cited as a major {{influence}} on new jack swing—a hip-hop-influenced form of funk which became the dominant form of contemporary R from 1987 to 1993. Nelson George described Escape music as a style which [...] "black radio embraces", specifically a [...] "radio-friendly, singles-oriented hip hop", as opposed to the [...] "hard-core, more rhyme-centered rap". Retrospective commentary on their music suggested that, although the group sounded tame when compared to the later work of artists such as Too Short and Ol' Dirty Bastard, as well as groups like 2 Live Crew, Whodini were considered [...] "raunchy and racy" [...] during the mid-1980s on songs such as [...] "Freaks <b>Come</b> <b>Out</b> <b>at</b> Night".|$|E
500|$|During his monologue, host Rock joked, [...] "Clint Eastwood's a star, OK? Tobey Maguire's {{just a boy}} in tights," [...] He also added, [...] "You want Tom Cruise and all you can get is Jude Law? Wait. You want Russell Crowe and all you can get is Colin Farrell? Wait. Alexander is not Gladiator." [...] In response, Sean Penn rebutted Rock's remarks praising Law {{as one of his}} generation's [...] "finest actors". Over a year later, Law {{expressed}} his anger toward Rock in The New York Times telling columnist Craig Modderno, [...] "At first I laughed because I didn't think he knew who I was. Then I got angry as his remarks became personal. My friends were livid. It's unfortunate I had five or six films <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>at</b> the same time." ...|$|E
500|$|Among {{retrospective}} reviews, Fact {{noted that}} Escape was [...] "eclipsed by {{the antics of}} the new school" [...] {{and that it had}} [...] "tumbled off of most casual fans' bucket lists." [...] According to AllMusic, the album was a [...] "vast improvement over the previous year's debut" [...] with [...] "a countless amount of memorable lines and productions, and has held up over time better than the debut", but that it was not [...] "a conceptual masterpiece." [...] The reviewer called [...] "Freaks <b>Come</b> <b>Out</b> <b>at</b> Night" [...] and [...] "Five Minutes of Funk" [...] classics, and said that [...] "We Are Whodini" [...] "distills the essence of the group more than the other groundbreaking tracks here, and still retains a sense of freshness." [...] Trouser Press found the album [...] "airy without being simple", and called it appealing and innovative. Fact placed Escape at number 98 on their list of top 1980s albums, calling it [...] "diverting from end to end – something Spoonie G, The Cold Crush Brothers and The Furious Five conspicuously failed to deliver." ...|$|E

500|$|In a {{contemporary}} review, Robert Christgau gave Escape a grade of B+ and wrote that Hutchins and Smith [...] "turn out ingratiating {{variations on a}} formula. Fortunately, the formula isn't tired yet." [...] Although Christgau found the lyrics of [...] "Freaks <b>Come</b> <b>Out</b> <b>at</b> Night" [...] less intellectual than [...] "Escape" [...] or [...] "Friends" [...] and less musically interesting than [...] "Five Minutes of Funk", he still considered it a strong song. NME described Escape as superior to Whodini's first album and praised Smith's production, writing that his [...] "sparse DMC sound here gives way to a rich and warm electronic soundscape". They went on to dub the title track as being the best song on the album, followed by [...] "Big Mouth", [...] "Out of Control", [...] "We Are Whodini" [...] and [...] "Friends". They {{went on to say}} that [...] "Featuring Grandmaster Dee" [...] was Escape weak link, calling it a [...] "pointless instrumental reworking of [...] "Five Minutes of Funk"." [...] Spin praised [...] "Escape (I Need a Break)", comparing it to Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five's [...] "The Message", writing that Whodini's song [...] "focuses on the guy affected by social condition, not on the condition itself." ...|$|E
500|$|Kurt invites Blaine to the McKinley junior prom in [...] "Prom Queen". The {{attendees}} greet Karofsky's {{election as}} Prom King with great enthusiasm, but a stunned silence falls when Kurt is declared Prom Queen due to having received an {{overwhelming number of}} unwanted write-in votes in the secret balloting. Humiliated, Kurt flees in tears, but is able to calm down and return for his coronation; his comment—"Eat your heart out, Kate Middleton"—garners applause that swells into an ovation. The traditional dance between King and Queen is next, and Karofsky is faced with having to partner with a boy {{in front of his}} classmates. He rejects Kurt's suggestion to <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>at</b> the prom, and abandons Kurt on the dance floor as the music begins; Blaine dances with Kurt instead. At the end of the season, the glee club travels to the Nationals competition in New York City. Kurt and Rachel sneak into the Gershwin Theatre where Wicked is playing, and from the stage they sing [...] "For Good", a song from the musical. They both decide to come back to New York after graduation. New Directions finishes in twelfth place at Nationals, and upon Kurt's return to Ohio, he and Blaine declare their love for one another.|$|E
500|$|The {{album was}} {{released}} on October 17, 1984 by Jive Records. The group had a developed a large following in Britain and Europe prior {{to the release of}} Escape, although success in the United States had initially been limited. [...] "Five Minutes of Funk" [...] and [...] "Freaks <b>Come</b> <b>Out</b> <b>at</b> Night" [...] became their first legitimate hits in their home country. According to the New York Times, these could be [...] "heard almost constantly in New York dance clubs, as well as on local urban-contemporary radio stations." [...] Ecstasy said that audiences were finally ready for hip-hop music, and Whodini were [...] "just beginning to break through on radio. Rather than listening to Stevie Wonder or someone do an inferior version of rap, people want to hear the real thing, with the original complexity to it. This is the most complex, interesting stuff going on in black music today, and the radio's just beginning to discover that the public eats it up." [...] By December 1984, the 7- and 12-inch singles [...] "Friends" [...] and [...] "Five Minutes of Funk" [...] were approaching sales of 350,000, and received more airplay than the [...] "Magic's Wand" [...] and [...] "Haunted House of Rock" [...] from Whodini's first album. Billboard reported the airplay, noting that despite the increased play, the songs were unreported and often played during the night. The month before Escape release, Whodini appeared at the 1984 Swatch Watch New York City Fresh Fest as part of the first national tour featuring hip-hop groups. The 27-date tour featured Run–D.M.C., Kurtis Blow, The Fat Boys and Newcleus, and grossed $3.5 million.|$|E
