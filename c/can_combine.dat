5|$|The element iron <b>can</b> <b>combine</b> with {{chlorine}} at {{high temperatures}} {{in a strong}} exothermic reaction, creating a chlorine-iron fire. Chlorine-iron fires are a risk in chemical process plants, {{where much of the}} pipework that carries chlorine gas is made of steel.|$|E
5|$|Charged leptons <b>can</b> <b>combine</b> {{with other}} {{particles}} to form various composite particles such as atoms and positronium. The electron governs {{nearly all of}} chemistry, as it is found in atoms and is directly tied to all chemical properties. Neutrinos rarely interact with anything, and are consequently rarely observed. Neutrinos stream throughout the Universe but rarely interact with normal matter.|$|E
50|$|Like ollies, a nollie <b>can</b> be <b>combined</b> {{with other}} tricks to form variations. For example, a nollie <b>can</b> be <b>combined</b> with a kickflip {{to create a}} nollie flip, or a nollie <b>can</b> be <b>combined</b> with a 360-flip to create a nollie 360-flip.|$|R
50|$|A pair {{of boats}} <b>can</b> be <b>combined</b> to give another still life {{known as the}} boat tie (a pun on bow tie, which it superficially resembles). Similarly, a pair of ships <b>can</b> be <b>combined</b> into a ship tie.|$|R
2500|$|These {{three basic}} prefixes <b>can</b> be <b>combined</b> with various suffixes to express all of Cheyenne's pronominal distinctions. For example, the prefix ná- <b>can</b> be <b>combined</b> on a verb with the suffix -me {{to express the}} first person plural exclusive.|$|R
5|$|Dalton {{proposed}} that each chemical element {{is composed of}} atoms of a single, unique type, and though they cannot be altered or destroyed by chemical means, they <b>can</b> <b>combine</b> to form more complex structures (chemical compounds). This marked the first truly scientific theory of the atom, since Dalton reached his conclusions by experimentation and examination of the results in an empirical fashion.|$|E
5|$|As {{characters}} gain experience points their mutant superpowers {{and unique}} abilities can be upgraded. Items found during gameplay {{can also be}} equipped to further enhance a character's abilities. Characters <b>can</b> <b>combine</b> attacks to create a combo, in which two or more players punch or kick a single enemy at the same time. The character's special abilities {{can also be used}} in the same manner to create a Super Combo which inflicts massive damage on enemies. Each character has several mutant powers that players can assign to controller buttons. The game also features a skirmish mode, which allows players to fight against each other or waves of computer-controlled enemies.|$|E
5|$|Cleansing asanas {{are those}} that when practiced for {{short periods of time}} help the body prevent or correct {{internal}} imbalances and tone inner organs; while meditative asanas are those postures, either sitting or standing, that one can maintain steadily and comfortably for extended periods of time. In both, a proper posture is achieved when one <b>can</b> <b>combine</b> relaxed steadiness with deep breathing exercises. Such comfortable and stable asanas are necessary for cleansing of the Nadi (blood vessels) through the Pranayama stage of yoga. This view is shared by other yoga texts, such as in verse 5.2 of Gheranda Samhita. The Padmasana (lotus position) is esteemed for both cleansing and meditative contemplation.|$|E
25|$|In Hold'em Poker players {{make the}} best hand they <b>can</b> <b>combining</b> the two cards in their hand with the 5 cards (community cards) {{eventually}} turned up on the table. The deck has 52 and there are 13 of each suit.|$|R
50|$|These {{parameters}} can {{be expressed}} in various ways. For example, the current and beam size <b>can</b> be <b>combined</b> into the current density, and the current and energy (or beam voltage V) <b>can</b> be <b>combined</b> into the perveance K = I V−3/2.|$|R

5|$|However, one <b>can</b> <b>combine</b> {{the nominal}} solar mass {{parameter}} {{with the most}} recent (2014) CODATA estimate of the Newtonian gravitational constant G to derive the solar mass to be approximately 1.9885 × 1030 kg. Although the exact values for the luminosity, radius, mass parameter, and mass may vary slightly in the future due to observational uncertainties, the 2015 IAU nominal constants will remain the same SI values as they remain useful measures for quoting stellar parameters.|$|E
5|$|In Quenya, {{there are}} many {{similarities}} in form between prepositions and adverbs since the grammatical case already determines the relation of verb and object. Many Quenya prepositions have adverb-like uses with no complement. In Common Eldarin, these prepositions were postpositions instead, and later became inflectional endings. Case markings combine primarily with nouns, whereas prepositions <b>can</b> <b>combine</b> with phrases of many different categories. This is why most prepositions in Quenya are used with a noun in the nominative case.|$|E
5|$|On 26 December 2002, Brigitte Boisselier, a Raëlian Bishop and CEO of a {{biotechnology}} {{company called}} Clonaid, announced {{the birth of}} baby Eve, supposedly the first-ever human clone. The announcement ignited much media attention, ethical debate, doubt, criticism, and claims of a hoax. Spokespeople for the movement, including Claude Vorilhon, have suggested {{that this is one}} of the first steps in achieving a more important agenda. They claim that through cloning they <b>can</b> <b>combine</b> an accelerated growth process with some form of mind transfer, and in such, may achieve eternal life. Raelians constitute the world's largest UFO religion.|$|E
5000|$|Systematic design methodologies {{comparable}} to digital design methods {{are far more}} primitive in the analog and mixed-signal arena. Analog circuit design can not generally be automated to nearly the extent that digital circuit design <b>can.</b> <b>Combining</b> the two technologies multiplies this complication.|$|R

5|$|Sulfuric acid is {{produced}} in the upper atmosphere by the Sun's photochemical action on carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide, and water vapour. Ultraviolet photons of wavelengths less than 169 nm can photodissociate carbon dioxide into carbon monoxide and atomic oxygen. Atomic oxygen is highly reactive; when it reacts with sulfur dioxide, a trace component of the Venusian atmosphere, the result is sulfur trioxide, which <b>can</b> <b>combine</b> with water vapour, another trace component of Venus's atmosphere, to yield sulfuric acid.|$|E
5|$|A second season, {{consisting}} of 13 episodes began airing on February 20, 2016 and saw Bumblebee's team, or Bee Team, attempting {{to apprehend the}} remaining escaped Decepticons and the discovery that the Alchemor was cut in half upon crashing on Earth, leading {{to the creation of}} a different Decepticon group. The season also features the return of Soundwave and Ratchet from Transformers: Primethe former appearing for one episode while the latter appears in the two-part finale. A miniseries, {{consisting of}} six episodes, premiered in October 2016 and features the return of Starscream, placing him as the main antagonist. In April 2017, the series' third season, entitled Combiner Force, began airing and focuses on Bee Team's realization that they <b>can</b> <b>combine</b> into the Combiner, Ultra Bee, as well as the arrival of the Stunticons, who are also capable of combining. Soundwave also plans to return with the help of Activators, a new breed of Minicons.|$|E
5|$|Ceramics lend {{themselves}} to circular motifs, whether radial or tangential. Bowls or plates can be decorated inside or out with radial stripes; these may be partly figurative, representing stylised leaves or flower petals, while circular bands can run around a bowl or jug. Patterns of these types were employed on Islamic ceramics from the Ayyubid period, 13thcentury. Radially symmetric flowers with, say, 6 petals {{lend themselves}} to increasingly stylised geometric designs which <b>can</b> <b>combine</b> geometric simplicity with recognisably naturalistic motifs, brightly coloured glazes, and a radial composition that ideally suits circular crockery. Potters often chose patterns suited {{to the shape of}} the vessel they were making. Thus an unglazed earthenware water flask from Aleppo {{in the shape of a}} vertical circle (with handles and neck above) is decorated with a ring of moulded braiding around an Arabic inscription with a small 8-petalled flower at the centre.|$|E

5|$|The {{development}} of captive breeding methods {{has led to}} peregrines being commercially available for falconry use, thus mostly eliminating the need to capture wild birds for support of falconry. The main reason for taking wild peregrines {{at this point is}} to maintain healthy genetic diversity in the breeding lines. Hybrids of peregrines and gyrfalcons are also available that <b>can</b> <b>combine</b> the best features of both species to create what many consider to be the ultimate falconry bird for the taking of larger game such as the sage-grouse. These hybrids combine the greater size, strength, and horizontal speed of the gyrfalcon with the natural propensity to stoop and greater warm weather tolerance of the peregrine.|$|E
