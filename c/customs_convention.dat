25|$|Tradition {{should be}} {{differentiated}} from <b>customs,</b> <b>conventions,</b> laws, norms, routines, rules and similar concepts. Whereas tradition {{is supposed to}} be invariable, they are seen as more flexible and subject to innovation and change. Whereas justification for tradition is ideological, the justification for other similar concepts is more practical or technical. Over time, <b>customs,</b> routines, <b>conventions,</b> rules and such can evolve into traditions, but that usually requires that they stop having (primarily) a practical purpose. For example, wigs worn by lawyers were at first common and fashionable; spurs worn by military officials were at first practical but now are both impractical and traditional.|$|R

2500|$|In day-to-day {{business}} it happens that containers do appear {{which do not}} follow the ISO 6346 identification at all; however, they are fully CSC safety approved containers. Usually these are [...] "shippers owned" [...] containers, {{which means that they}} are not owned by the carrier but supplied by the cargo owners (shippers). They may have no registered owner code and no category identifier and have no check digit. It is advisable to follow ISO 6346 as the absence of a compliant identification code causes problems for both carriers and container terminals to correctly identify the equipment and properly deliver the cargo, because computer systems require ISO 6346 conformant naming and as such missing prefixes are invented. For example, YYYY at the carrier and XXXX at the terminal causes the equipment to mismatch. Moreover, since ISO 6346 identification has become a requirement in international <b>Customs</b> <b>conventions</b> (<b>Customs</b> <b>Conventions</b> on Containers and Istanbul <b>Convention),</b> many <b>Customs</b> Administrations have begun validating that containers are marked as per the standard.|$|R
