25|$|In November 2013, {{the company}} {{announced}} the re-branding of its residential services to Charter Spectrum which encompass an upgrade to an all-digital network for its video, voice and broadband services. The company relied heavily on a predominantly coaxial cable-based network. The newer fiber-optic service-delivery system provides higher bandwidth speeds than are available with its coaxial <b>cable</b> <b>infrastructure.</b>|$|E
25|$|Internet The {{fibre optic}} cable that runs from a bay on the {{southern}} {{side of the island}} connects it to the internet. Internet services were provided using VDSL and ADSL until central government introduced a national fibre optic rollout that included urban parts of Waiheke. Central government also forced the separation of the <b>cable</b> <b>infrastructure</b> from the ISPs, with the fibre backbone being mained by Chorus who has contracts with numerous ISPs. The locally owned WISP continues to provided wireless internet and some islanders use both services to ensure systems redundancy.|$|E

5000|$|ADSL Services {{are deemed}} {{slower than the}} new LibyaMax {{services}} due to disorganized <b>cable</b> <b>infrastructure</b> requiring adequate maintenance and repair providing consumers slower than expected internet speeds. <b>Cable</b> <b>infrastructure</b> especially in the Tripoli Residential capital area ( [...] Omar Al-Mukhtar [...] ) can be observed as being disorganized and damaged, with old copper wiring still serving the typical household and not providing the intended-advertised services. LTT Headquarters is near the capital - 'Al-Shat Road / Coastal Road' where Residential areas are most dense, hence <b>cable</b> <b>infrastructure</b> is inevitably disorganized and poorly maintained, bringing about poor service delivery to typical households {{in and out of}} the capital area.|$|E

50|$|As of October 2016, Bezeq, HOT, 012 Smile and Cellcom offer {{landline}} telephony services. Bezeq is {{the oldest}} {{of all of them}} and is reputed to have a monopoly in the field.

The <b>cable</b> <b>infrastructure</b> is not yet spread throughout the entire country and therefore not every house in Israel can be a member of Hot; in comparison, Bezeq has landline infrastructure in all towns and villages in the country. The strategy of 012 Smile and Cellcom is different from the former two in that they did not rush to establish a new physical infrastructure; rather, they provide telephone services which are based on the infrastructure of Bezeq and Hot, by means of Internet telephony technologies and additional technologies.|$|E
