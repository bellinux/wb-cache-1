5|$|A second {{option is}} to {{increase}} the amount of well-watered vegetation. These two options can be combined with the implementation of green roofs. Green roofs are excellent insulators during the warm weather months and the plants cool the surrounding environment.

40|$|Background and purpose: Because of {{the high}} traffic flow in the city center in Sari, a walk through survey {{indicated}} that the PM 2. 5 concentrations {{are likely to be}} higher than the standards. This study was carried out to determine the level of PM 2. 5 at the streets' <b>curbsides</b> in the city center in Sari. Materials and Methods: In this cross-sectional study the PM 2. 5 concentrations were measured in 185 monitoring stations at the <b>curbsides</b> of four main streets in the Sari city  entre. 5550 10 -s samples were collected using a real time particle monitor. A questionnaire was used to record air pollution related information and data were analyzed by descriptive statistic and ANOVA tests. Results: Mean of PM 2. 5 concentration was 83 μgm- 3 and it was two times more than the national one and EPA recommended 24 - hour standard (35 μgm- 3). This study showed that mean of PM 2. 5 concentration at the street during traffic rush hours in the morning and evening were higher than those measured in the afternoon. Conclusion: Because {{of the high}} concentration of PM 2. 5 in the Sari’s city centre that resulted in this study, the 24 - hour PM 2. 5 concentrations are likely to be higher than standards in some days in the city centre in Sari.

In urban areas surfaces are often planar and plane patches are an efficient representation for localization purposes.

40|$|In {{a traffic}} network, {{capacities}} {{of parts of}} the network restrict the amount of transport units which can be handled by this network. The capacity of a given traffic network element is not fixed but influenced by parameters such as number of lanes, maximum speed, weather, view horizon and so on. These parameters also define the maximum capacity of roundabouts. Special shapes of roundabouts, particularly in urban regions, may further increase or decrease their capacity. This paper investigates how the capacity of such special roundabouts can be estimated with only the <b>curbsides</b> of a roundabout as an input. It is also of interest to see that changes to the shape decrease the amount of space “wasted ” for the traffic roundabout while the capacity remains unchanged. In this case study one special roundabout is examined: “Central” in downtown Zurich, Switzerland. The particularity of this roundabout is that it partially behaves like a roundabout but also contains two uncontrolled intersections. Due to its central position in the city, the roundabout is very busy with both individual cars and public transport vehicles.

40|$|A growing {{interest}} in environmental issues within the community has seen suburban backyards, streets, houses and <b>curbsides</b> become sites of experimentation around sustainable lifestyle practices. Drawing upon research on various grassroots green initiatives around inner urban and suburban Melbourne, this article discusses what the rise {{of these kinds of}} lifestyle politics might mean for conceptualizing scale, citizenship, and social change in the contemporary moment. Drawing on social practice theory and its focus on the embodied, habitual and more-than-human elements of everyday practices, I argue that green suburban lifestyle initiatives such as &# 039;permablitzes&# 039; are transformational {{in a number of ways}} and that they embody, materialize and perform broader sets of changes in people&# 039;s lives as they seek to switch from practices of consumption to a focus on self-sufficiency and making do.

40|$|Anuradha Mathur and Dilip da Cunha theorise {{in their}} work on cities and {{flooding}} {{that it is not}} the floodwaters that threaten lives and homes, the real cause of danger in natural disaster is the fixity of modern civilisation. Their work traces the fluidity of the boundaries between 'dry' and 'wet' land challenging the deficiencies of traditional cartography in representing the extents of bodies of water. Mathur and da Cunha propose a process of unthinking to address the redevelopment of communities in the aftermath of natural disaster. By documenting the path of floodwaters in non-Euclidean space they propose a more appropriate response to flooding. This research focuses on the documentation of flooding in the interior of dwellings, which is an extreme condition of damage by external conditions in an environment designed to protect from these very elements. Because the floodwaters don't discriminate between the interior and the exterior, they move between structures with disregard for the systems of space we have in place. With the rapid clean up that follows flood damage, little material evidence is left for post mortem examination. This is especially the case for the flood damaged interior, piles of materials susceptible to the elements, furniture, joinery and personal objects line <b>curbsides</b> awaiting disposal. There is a missed opportunity in examining the interior in the after math of flood, in the way that Mathur and Dilip investigate floods and the design of cities, the flooded interior proffers an undersigned interior to study. In the absence of intact flood damaged interior, this research relies on two artists' documentation of the flooded interior. The first case study is the mimetic scenographic interiors of a flood-damaged office exhibited in the Bangkok art gallery by the group _Proxy in 2011. The second case study is Robert Polidori's photographic exhibition in New Orleans, described by Julianna Preston as, 'a series of interiors undetected by satellite imaging or storm radar.

50|$|The area is fenced off and is {{technically}} {{not open to}} the public today. A large “No Trespassing” sign was placed around the beach in 1987 due to a string of deaths and injuries that occurred at the location (2). There have been at least eighteen deaths {{in the last five years}} at or near the cliffs of San Pedro or Sunken City itself (7). In 2003, there were five cliffside deaths, two of which happened within a three-day span (7). In 2006, four people fell or threw themselves from the edges of the cliffs onto the rocks below and died along the cliffs of San Pedro (7). In January 2007,a man on the USC football team fell at least 100 feet over the cliffs to his death in San Pedro (7). In the same year, a nineteen-year-old girl simply lost her footing on unstable rocks and plunged at least 50 feet to her death at Sunken City (7). Three more people died in the same year from falls from the cliffs (7). Aside from deaths at Sunken City or areas near it, there have been a number of injuries that have resulted from trespassing past the gate and hiking the area as well (8). People have broken bones from falling, sprained ankles from loose footing, or suffered serious head injuries that caused them to be hospitalized (8). This is the reason Sunken City has been held back from public opening (8). Sunken City is one of the only areas along the coastline of San Pedro that still remains closed to the public (2). However, it is a hidden tourist attraction because of the abundance of graffiti it is decorated with. Sunken City has a beautiful view of the Pacific ocean and also the remains of concrete foundations, <b>curbsides,</b> sanitation, and piping from the neighborhood that once thrived on the San Pedro cliff (1). The beach also offers views of Catalina Island and the cranes of Los Angeles’s port (2). It has gained a sort of cult status due to its whimsical views of graffiti messages from teenagers who trespass the area (2). The beach is closed to the public due to possible safety hazards but it can be accessed through a small hole in the fence that separates the public from the hiking trail that leads to the attraction (1). It can also be accessed by climbing the fence, but it is suggested that one use extreme caution.|$|R
40|$|In January 2011 a swollen Brisbane River broke {{its banks}} {{flooding}} riverside houses and buildings. The river’s water spread and rose up through storm water drains inundating some 20 000 houses in low-lying land. As the water receded those residents {{affected by the}} floods returned to their homes to assess the damage. While some people {{breathed a sigh of}} relief others were devastated by the overwhelming damage to their homes and personal belongings. Over the next few weeks the landscape of Brisbane was altered not merely by the mud and debris left by the torrent of water, but by the piles of domestic contents occupying Brisbane streets. Beds, toys, cabinets, plasterboard, tiles and household furniture lined <b>curbsides</b> waiting for collection. Later they would accumulate in public parks and sports centres to await disposal, momentarily creating an unsettling landscape of discarded domestic interiors. While most houses remained standing the heart breaking repercussions were evident in their interiority. Thousands of volunteers flocked to help those affected by the floods to purge the damage left by the water – removing wall and floor linings, discarding furniture and spoilt belongings. In her paper on Hurricane Katrina, Julieanna Preston wrote, ‘What anthropological evidence would we find as we followed their migration – heaps left by the side of the road, the physical weight overcoming the personal value…’ For many of the post flood restored homes and buildings entire interiors have been replaced, eradicating any trace of the significant event that disturbed them only months earlier. There were artifacts that would have survived the floods - furniture of solid timber – these were discarded and with them the patina that marked an important event in history. The patina is beyond technological reproducibility, and as Walter Benjamin writes, this being the whole premise of genuineness. It is the role of the French Polisher to maintain the true wear of the artefact for it is the patina that is most valuable in its ability to narrate the history of a piece. In 2012 two separate exhibitions in Brisbane will take place to display a selected collection of flood-damaged artefacts. This orchestrated way to commemorate the damage left by floods may be a method to compensate for the haste in which the damage was purged from the city. This need for exhibiting damaged artifacts illustrates Andreas Huyssen’s point that "…today memory is understood as a mode of re-presentation and as belonging to the present. " This research looks at the dying trade of the French Polisher through conversations and a visual study of flood damaged furniture. The research also investigates the personal loss of artifacts through intimate stories shared by flood victims.

40|$|Following the Civil War, the American {{government}} {{greatly expanded}} the opportunities available for private businessmen and investors {{in an effort}} to rapidly colonize the West. This expansion of private commerce led to the second industrial revolution in which railroads and the corporation became the symbols and tools of a rapidly modernizing nation. It was also during this period that the responsibility of food distribution was released from municipal accountability and institutions like public markets began to fade from the American urbanscape. While the proliferation of private grocers greatly aided many metropolises 2 ̆ 7 rapid growth, they did little to secure a sustainable and desirable form of food distribution. During the decades before and {{after the turn of the}} century, public market campaigns began to develop in response to the widespread abandonment of municipal food distribution. Like many western cities, Portland, Oregon matured during the second half of the nineteenth century and lacked the historical and social precedent for the construction of a public market. Between 1851 and 1914, residents of Portland and its agricultural hinterland fought for the construction of a municipally-owned public market rallying against the perceived harmful and growing influences of middlemen. As a result of their efforts, the Carroll Public Market was founded on the <b>curbsides</b> of Yamhill Street in downtown Portland. While success encouraged multiple expansions and an increasingly supportive consumer base, a growing commitment to modernist planning among city officials and the spread of automobile ownership determined the market to be incompatible with the commercial future of Portland. In an effort to acknowledge and capitalize on the Carroll Public Market 2 ̆ 7 s community, a group of investors, incorporated as the Portland Market Company, worked with city officials between 1926 and 1934 to create the largest public market in the United States, the Portland Public Market. As the first building of the newly constructed waterfront development, many believed the massive institution would reinvigorate nearby businesses and ultimately influence the potential of the downtown business district. The Portland Public Market was decidedly distinct from the market along Yamhill and the promoters cast it as such. By utilizing the most modern technologies and promises of convenience there was little that the two organizations shared in common. In the end, the potential of the waterfront market was never fulfilled and amidst legal scandals, an ongoing struggle to meet operating costs, and the success of a rebellious Farmers Cooperative, it shut down after nine years. This thesis discusses these two public markets during a period of changing consumer interests and the rise of modernist planning in Portland, Oregon. Ultimately, the Carroll Public Market was torn down for reasons beyond its own control despite the comfortable profit it enjoyed each year. Many city officials refused to support the institution as they increasingly supported the values of modernism and urban planning. The Portland Public Market fit perfectly with many city planners 2 ̆ 7 and private investors 2 ̆ 7 intents for the future.
