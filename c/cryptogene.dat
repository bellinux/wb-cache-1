40|$|Six short G-rich {{intergenic regions}} in the maxicircle of Leishmania tarentolae are conserved in {{location}} and polarity in two other kinetoplastid species. We show here that G-rich region 6 (G 6) represents a pan-edited <b>cryptogene</b> which contains at least two domains edited independently in a 3 '-to- 5 ' manner connected by short unedited regions. In the completely edited RNA, 117 uridines are added at 49 sites and 32 uridines are deleted at 13 sites, creating a translated 85 -amino-acid polypeptide. Similar polypeptides are probably encoded by pan-edited G 6 transcripts in two other species. The G 6 polypeptide has significant sequence similarity {{to the family of}} S 12 ribosomal proteins. A minicircle-encoded gRNA overlaps 12 editing sites in G 6 mRNA, and chimeric gRNA/mRNA molecules were shown to exist, in agreement with the transesterification model for editing...|$|E
40|$|RNA editing in the {{mitochondria}} of kinetoplastid protoza {{involves the}} insertion and/or deletion of precise numbers of uridine residues at precise {{locations in the}} numbers of uridine residues at precise locations in the transcribed RNA of certain genes. These genes are known as cryptogenes. In this paper we study computational algorithms to search for unknown cryptogenes and for the associated templates for insertion of uridines, gRNA sequences. The pairwise similarity search algorithm of Smith and Waterman (1) is modified to study this problem. The algorithm searches for unknown gRNAs given the <b>cryptogene</b> sequence. The method is tested on 4 known cryptogenes from L. tarentolae which are known to have 7 associated gRNAs. The statistical distribution of the longest gRNA when comparing random sequences is derived. Finally we develop an algorithm to search for cryptogenes using amino acid sequences from related proteins...|$|E

40|$|In {{a recent}} paper (5), Noyes et al. {{discussed}} a nested-PCR-based approach for identification {{and analysis of}} Leishmania kinetoplast DNA (kDNA) minicircle classes using the analysis of minicircle variable-region (VR) restriction profiles. The kDNA of trypanosomatids consists of catenated mini-circle (approximately 5 3 103 to 5 3 104 per associate) and maxicircle (20 to 50 per associate) molecules (8). It was shown that the minicircles encode guide RNA (gRNA) molecules involved in the RNA editing of maxicircle <b>cryptogenes</b> (for a review, see reference 9). To date, only this one important cellular function has been demonstrated for minicircles but the enigma of their redundancy remains topical. The prognosti-cated number of minicircle classes in Leishmania is more than 60 (4). This number comes from the hypothetical number of maxicircle <b>cryptogenes</b> requiring editing of pre-mRNA tran...|$|R
40|$|RNA editing in kinetoplastids {{appears to}} be a labile genetic trait that is {{affected}} by prolonged cell culture. The transcripts of the G 1 -G 5 <b>cryptogenes</b> are pan-edited in the recently isolated LEM 125 strain of Leishmania tarentolae, but not in the UC strain which has been in culture for 55 years. At least 32 minicircle-encoded guide RNAs (gRNAs) for the editing of G 1 -G 5 transcripts are present in LEM 125 and absent in UC. We hypothesize that specific minicircle sequence classes encoding gRNAs for the editing of these transcripts were lost during the long culture history of the UC strain. The protein products, which include components of complex I of the respiratory chain, are probably not required during the culture stage of the Leishmania life cycle...|$|R
40|$|Synthetic pre-edited {{messenger}} RNA (mRNA) {{and guide}} RNA (gRNA) for the 5 '-edited maxicircle-encoded ND 7 <b>cryptogene</b> from Leishmania tarentolae formed chimeric molecules upon incubation {{in the presence}} of a mitochondrial extract. These chimeric molecules consisted of the gRNAs covalently linked to the mRNAs by short oligo(U) tails at normal editing sites in most cases. Unlike the previously reported chimeras present in steady-state kinetoplast RNA, the in vitro-synthesized chimeras showed no editing of downstream editing sites. The synthesis of chimeric RNAs required ATP and was dependent on the formation of a gRNA/mRNA anchor duplex 3 ' of the pre-edited region, as shown by in vitro mutagenesis of the mRNA and the gRNA. mRNA sequences 3 ' and 5 ' of the pre-edited region also affected the efficiency of the chimera-forming activity. This in vitro system may accurately represent the initial step in RNA editing...|$|E
40|$|The {{complete}} {{sequences of}} three kinetoplast DNA minicircles (B 4, D 3 and D 12) from Leishmania tarentolae are reported. All L. tarentolae minicircles encode single gRNAs localized within the variable region approximately 150 bp from the conserved region. The 5 ' termini and tentative 3 ' termini {{of the new}} gRNAs were determined and the gene sequences and flanking sequences of all minicircle gRNA genes compared for conserved motifs of possible transcriptional regulatory significance. All minicircle gRNAs possess 3 ' oligo-[U] tails of variable length similar to maxicircle gRNAs. A role for the D 3 minicircle gRNA in the editing of the 5 ' pan-edited MURF 4 mRNA was suggested by sequence analysis, and a role for the D 12 minicircle gRNA in the editing of the COIII mRNA and another minicircle gRNA (Lt 154) in the editing of the pan-edited G 6 mRNA have been previously reported. The <b>cryptogene</b> mRNAs edited by the B 4 and Lt 19 minicircle gRNAs are yet undetermined...|$|E
40|$|Kinetoplastid RNA (kRNA) editing is {{a process}} that creates {{translatable}} mitochondrial mRNA transcripts from <b>cryptogene</b> encoded RNAs and is unique for kinetoplastids, such as Trypanosoma brucei. In addition to the catalytic 20 S editosome, multiple accessory proteins are required for this conversion. Recently, the multiprotein mitochondrial RNA binding complex 1 (MRB 1) has emerged as a key player in this process. MRB 1 consists of six core proteins but makes dynamic interactions with additional accessory proteins. Here we describe the characterization of one such factor, the 72 kDa MRB 1590 protein. In vivo experiments indicate a role for MRB 1590 in editing mitochondrial mRNA transcripts, in particular the transcript encoding the ATP synthase subunit 6 (A 6). Structural studies show that MRB 1590 is dimeric and contains a central ABC-ATPase fold embedded between novel N- and C-terminal regions. The N-terminal domains combine to create a basic pore and biochemical studies indicate residues in this region participate in RNA binding. Structures capturing distinct MRB 1590 conformations reveal that the RNA binding pore adopts closed and open states, with the latter able to accommodate RNA. Based on these findings, implications for MRB 1590 function are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Abstract RNA editing {{describes}} targeted sequence {{alterations in}} RNAs {{so that the}} transcript sequences differ from their DNA template. Since the original discovery of RNA editing in trypanosomes nearly 25 years ago {{more than a dozen}} such processes of nucleotide insertions, deletions, and exchanges have been identified in evolu-tionarily widely separated groups of the living world including plants, animals, fungi, protists, bacteria, and viruses. In many cases gene expression in mitochondria is affected, but RNA editing also takes place in chloroplasts and in nucleocytosolic genetic environments. While some RNA editing systems largely seem to repair defect genes (<b>cryptogenes),</b> others have obvious functions in modulating gene activities. The present review aims for an overview on the current states of research in the different systems of RNA editing by following a historic timeline along the respective original discoveries...|$|R
40|$|The {{mitochondrial}} genome of Trypanosoma brucei {{contains many}} <b>cryptogenes</b> {{that must be}} extensively edited following transcription. The RNA editing process is directed by guide RNAs (gRNAs) that encode the information for the specific insertion and deletion of uridylates required to generate translatable mRNAs. We have deep sequenced the gRNA transcriptome from the bloodstream form of the EATRO 164 cell line. Using conventionally accepted fully edited mRNA sequences, ~ 1 million gRNAs were identified. In contrast, over 3 million reads were identified in our insect stage gRNA transcriptome. A comparison of the two life cycle transcriptomes show an overall ratio of procyclic to bloodstream gRNA reads of 3. 5 : 1. This ratio varies significantly by gene and by gRNA populations within genes. The variation in the abundance of the initiating gRNAs for each gene, however, displays a trend that correlates with the developmental pattern of edited gene expression. A comparison of related major classes from each transcriptome revealed a median value of ten single nucleotide variations per gRNA. Nucleotide variations were {{much less likely to}} occur in the consecutive Watson-Crick anchor region, indicating a very strong bias against G:U base pairs in this region. This work indicates that gRNAs are expressed during both life cycle stages, and that differential editing patterns observed for the different mitochondrial mRNA transcripts are not due to {{the presence or absence of}} gRNAs. However, the abundance of certain gRNAs may be important in the developmental regulation of RNA editing...|$|R
40|$|International audienceOne of {{the unusual}} {{features}} of DNA-containing organelles {{in general and}} mitochondria in particular is the frequent occurrence of RNA editing [1]. The term “RNA editing” refers {{to a variety of}} mechanistically unrelated biochemical processes that alter RNA sequence during or after transcription [2]. The editing can be insertional, deletional, or substitutional and has been found in all major types of RNAs [3, 4]. Although mitochondrial mRNA editing is widespread in some eukaryotic lineages [5 - 7], it is rare in animals, with reported cases limited both in their scope and in phylogenetic distribution [8 - 11] (see also [12]). While analyzing genomic data from calcaronean sponges Sycon ciliatum and Leucosolenia complicata, we were perplexed by the lack of recognizable mitochondrial coding sequences. Comparison of genomic and transcriptomic data from these species revealed the presence of mitochondrial <b>cryptogenes</b> whose transcripts undergo extensive editing. This editing consisted of single or double uridylate (U) insertions in pre-existing short poly(U) tracts. Subsequent analysis revealed the presence of similar editing in Sycon coactum and the loss of editing in Petrobiona massiliana, a hypercalcified calcaronean sponge. In addition, mitochondrial genomes of at least some calcaronean sponges were found to have a highly unusual architecture, with nearly all genes located on individual and likely linear chromosomes. Phylogenetic analysis of mitochondrial coding sequences revealed accelerated rates of sequence evolution in this group. The latter observation presents a challenge for the mutational-hazard hypothesis [13], which posits that mRNA editing should not occur in lineages with an elevated mutation rate...|$|R
40|$|The ≈ 20 S RNA ligase-containing complex (L-complex) in trypanosomatid {{mitochondria}} interacts {{by means}} of RNA linkers {{with at least two}} other multiprotein complexes to mediate the editing of mitochondrial <b>cryptogene</b> transcripts. The L-complex contains ≈ 16 proteins, including the two RNA-editing ligases (RELs), REL 1 and REL 2. Leishmania tarentolae REL 1 and REL 2 and Trypanosoma brucei REL 1 were expressed as enzymatically active tandem affinity purification-tagged proteins in a Baculovirus system. When these proteins were added to mitochondrial lysates from T. brucei procyclic cells that were depleted of the cognate endogenous ligase by RNA interference down-regulation of expression, the added proteins were integrated into the L-complex, and, in the case of REL 1, there was a complementation of in vitro-precleaved U-insertion and U-deletion editing activities of the 20 S L-complex. Integration of the recombinant proteins did not occur or occurred at a very low level with noncognate ligase-depleted L-complex or with wild-type L-complex. A C-terminal region of the T. brucei recombinant REL 1 downstream of the catalytic domain was identified as being involved in integration into the L-complex. The ability to perform functional complementation in vitro provides a powerful tool for molecular dissection of the editing reaction...|$|E
40|$|Two {{different}} RNA editing {{systems have}} been described in the kinetoplast-mitochondrion of trypanosomatid protists. The first involves the precise insertion and deletion of U residues mostly within the coding regions of maxicircle-encoded mRNAs to produce open reading frames. This editing is mediated by short overlapping complementary guide RNAs encoded in both the maxicircle and the minicircle molecules and involves a series of enzymatic cleavage-ligation steps. The second editing system is a C 34 to U 34 modification in the anticodon of the imported tRNATrp, thereby permitting the decoding of the UGA stop codon as tryptophan. U-insertion editing probably originated in an ancestor of the kinetoplastid lineage and appears to have evolved in some cases by {{the replacement of the}} original pan-edited <b>cryptogene</b> with a partially edited cDNA. The driving force for the evolutionary fixation of these retroposition events was postulated to be the stochastic loss of entire minicircle sequence classes and their encoded guide RNAs upon segregation of the single kinetoplast DNA network into daughter cells at cell division. A large plasticity in the relative abundance of minicircle sequence classes has been observed during cell culture in the laboratory. Computer simulations provide theoretical evidence for this plasticity if a random distribution and segregation model of minicircles is assumed. The possible evolutionary relationship of the C to U and U-insertion editing systems is discussed...|$|E
40|$|RNA editing in trypanosomatids is an {{elaborate}} form of post-transcriptional processing that inserts and deletes uridines in many mitochondrial pre-mRNAs, providing the genetic {{information needed to}} create functional transcripts. The process has been extensively analyzed in Trypanosoma brucei, Crithidia fasciculata, and Leishmania tarentolae. However, few data exist on this mechanism in pathogenic Leishmania species. Here, we show evidence that this process also operates in Leishmania braziliensis, being {{the first time that}} RNA editing has been described in a species of the Viannia subgenus. A partially edited transcript corresponding to the NADH dehydrogenase subunit 8 (ND 8) gene was identified in L. braziliensis promastigotes. Sequence analysis allowed the identification of the maxicircle-encoded <b>cryptogene,</b> which shows a high degree of sequence conservation with the corresponding cryptogenes in other Leishmania species. Although an edition pattern could be postulated for the ND 8 transcripts in L. braziliensis, attempts to isolate completely edited transcripts by RT-PCR were not fruitful; instead, many transcripts with partial and unexpected editing patterns were isolated. This data, together with our inability to detect full-size transcripts by Northern blotting in promastigotes of L. braziliensis, led us to the suggestion that the strain used in this study (M 2904) lacks of critical RNA guides for a complete edition of ND 8 transcripts.

40|$|Although the {{mitochondrial}} uridine insertion/deletion, guide RNA (gRNA) -mediated type of RNA editing {{has been}} described in Crithidia fasciculata, no evidence for the encoding of gRNAs in the kinetoplast minicircle DNA has been presented. There {{has also been a}} question as to the capacity of the minicircle DNA in this species to encode the required variety of gRNAs, because the kinetoplast DNA from the C 1 strain has been reported as essentially containing a single minicircle sequence class. To address this problem, the genomic and mature edited sequences of the MURF 4 and RPS 12 <b>cryptogenes</b> were determined and a gRNA library was constructed from mitochondrial RNA. Five specific gRNAs were identified, two of which edit blocks within the MURF 4 mRNA, and three of which edit blocks within the RPS 12 mRNA. The genes for these gRNAs are all localized with identical polarity within one of the two variable regions of specific minicircle molecules, approximately 60 bp from the "bend" region. These minicircles were found to represent minor sequence classes representing approximately 2 % of the minicircle DNA population in the network. The major minicircle sequence class also encodes a gRNA at the same relative genomic location, but the editing role of this gRNA was not determined. These results confirm that kinetoplast minicircle DNA molecules in this species encode gRNAs, {{as is the case in}} other trypanosomatids, and suggest that the copy number of specific minicircle sequence classes can vary dramatically without an overall effect on the RNA editing system...|$|R
40|$|RNA editing a b s t r a c t Kinetoplast maxicircle DNA {{sequence}} organisation {{was investigated}} in Leishmania donovani, strain 1 S LdBob. Gene arrangement in the coding (conserved) region of the maxicircle is collinear with that of most trypanosomatids, with individual genes showing 80 – 90 % nucleotide identity to Leishmania tarentolae, strain UC. The notable exception was an integration of a full-size minicircle sequence in the ND 1 gene coding region found in L. donovani. Editing patterns of the mitochondrial mRNAs investigated also fol-lowed L. tarentolae UC patterns, including productive editing {{of the components of}} respiratory complexes III–V, and ribosomal protein S 12 (RPS 12), as well as the lack of productive editing in five out of six pan-edited <b>cryptogenes</b> (ND 3, ND 8, ND 9, G 3, G 4) found in these species. Several guide RNAs for the editing events were localised in minicircles and maxicircles in the locations that are conserved between the spe-cies. Mitochondrial activity, including rates of oxygen consumption, the presence and the levels of respi-ratory complexes and their individual subunits and the steady-state levels of several mitochondrial-encoded mRNAs were essentially the same in axenically grown amastigotes and in promastigotes of L. donovani. However, some modulation of mitochondrial activity between these developmental stages was suggested by the finding of an amastigote-specific component in complex IV, a down-regulation of mitochondrial RNA-binding proteins (MRP) and MRP-associated protein (MRP-AP) in amastigotes, and by variations in the levels of RPS 12, ND 3, ND 9, G 3 and G 4 pre-edited transcripts...|$|R
