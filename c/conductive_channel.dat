25|$|In an {{n-channel}} 'enhancement-mode' device, a <b>conductive</b> <b>channel</b> {{does not}} exist naturally within the transistor, and a positive gate-to-source voltage is necessary to create one. The positive voltage attracts free-floating electrons within the body towards the gate, forming a <b>conductive</b> <b>channel.</b> But first, enough electrons must be attracted near the gate to counter the dopant ions added {{to the body of}} the FET; this forms a region with no mobile carriers called a depletion region, and the voltage at which this occurs {{is referred to as the}} threshold voltage of the FET. Further gate-to-source voltage increase will attract even more electrons towards the gate which are able to create a <b>conductive</b> <b>channel</b> from source to drain; this process is called inversion.|$|E
25|$|Even {{though the}} <b>conductive</b> <b>channel</b> formed by gate-to-source voltage no longer connects source to drain during {{saturation}} mode, carriers are not blocked from flowing. Considering again an n-channel enhancement-mode device, a depletion region {{exists in the}} p-type body, surrounding the <b>conductive</b> <b>channel</b> and drain and source regions. The electrons which comprise the channel are free {{to move out of}} the channel through the depletion region if attracted to the drain by drain-to-source voltage. The depletion region is free of carriers and has a resistance similar to silicon. Any increase of the drain-to-source voltage will increase the distance from drain to the pinch-off point, increasing the resistance of the depletion region in proportion to the drain-to-source voltage applied. This proportional change causes the drain-to-source current to remain relatively fixed, independent of changes to the drain-to-source voltage, quite unlike its ohmic behavior in the linear mode of operation. Thus, in saturation mode, the FET behaves as a constant-current source rather than as a resistor, and can effectively be used as a voltage amplifier. In this case, the gate-to-source voltage determines the level of constant current through the channel.|$|E
25|$|Once a <b>conductive</b> <b>channel</b> bridges the air {{gap between}} the {{negative}} charge excess in the cloud and the positive surface charge excess below, {{there is a large}} drop in resistance across the lightning channel. Electrons accelerate rapidly as a result in a zone beginning at the point of attachment, which expands across the entire leader network {{at a fraction of the}} speed of light. This is the 'return stroke' and it is the most luminous and noticeable part of the lightning discharge.|$|E

50|$|The {{bit cell}} is {{programmed}} by applying a high-voltage pulse not encountered during a normal operation across {{the gate and}} substrate of the thin oxide transistor (around 6V for a 2 nm thick oxide, or 30MV/cm) {{to break down the}} oxide between gate and substrate. The positive voltage on the transistor's gate forms an inversion channel in the substrate below the gate, causing a tunneling current to flow through the oxide. The current produces additional traps in the oxide, increasing the current through the oxide and ultimately melting the oxide and forming a <b>conductive</b> <b>channel</b> from gate to substrate. The current required to form the <b>conductive</b> <b>channel</b> is around 100µA/100nm and the breakdown occurs in approximately 100µs or less.|$|E

40|$|A type of Ni/CCTO/PVDF {{three-phase}} percolative composite was prepared, {{in which}} the filler content (volume fraction) of Ni and CCTO was set at 60 vol%. The dependence of permittivity, electrical modulus and ac conductivity on the concentration of Ni and CCTO fillers near the percolation threshold was investigated in detail. The permittivity of the composites dramatically increased as the Ni content approached 24 vol%. This unique physical mechanism was realized as the formation of <b>conductive</b> <b>channels</b> near the percolation threshold. Analysis on the electrical modulus showed that the <b>conductive</b> <b>channels</b> are governed by three relaxation processes induced by the fillers (Ni, CCTO) and PVDF matrix, which are the interfacial polarization derived from the interfaces between fillers (Ni, CCTO) and PVDF matrix, and the polarization of CCTO ceramic filler and PVDF matrix. The conductivity behaviour with various Ni loadings and temperature suggested that the transition from an insulating to a conducting state should be induced by charge tunnelling between Ni-Ni particles, Ni-CCTO fillers and Ni-PVDF matrix. These findings demonstrated that the tunnelling conduction in the composite {{can be attributed to}} the unique physical mechanism near the percolation threshold. Department of Applied Physic...|$|R
30|$|Conduction in memristive devices is {{controlled}} by a spatially heterogeneous metal/oxide electronic barrier was reported by Yang et al. [46].

The concentration of vacancies is higher at the boundaries or metal/oxide interfaces. The ON and OFF switching took place at the top interface only, which indicates that top electrode acts as the active electrode.|$|R

30|$|So, {{taking into}} account the {{abovementioned}} discussion, one can suppose that subsurface layers of the whisker are saturated as B and Ni impurities. Then, the magnetic impurities (Ni) could be polarized by the influence of a magnetic field in the crystals. The polarization of the magnetic impurities, which are located close to each other, could lead to the occurrence of polarized zones, which can affect the movement of charge carriers. By managing such areas, it is possible to create the <b>conductive</b> <b>channels</b> in the crystal, which can be controlled by an external magnetic field.|$|R

The partition-free approach by Cini is combined with time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) to calculate total currents and densities in interacting systems.

The density oscillates with history-dependent amplitudes and, as a consequence, the effective potential of TDDFT oscillates too. Such time dependence might open new <b>conductive</b> <b>channels,</b> an effect which is not accounted for in any steady-state approach and might deserve further investigations.
