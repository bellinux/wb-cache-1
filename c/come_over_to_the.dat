5|$|In late 1968, {{the members}} of the Jimi Hendrix Experience were living in a rented house in Benedict Canyon, Los Angeles. One night bassist Noel Redding was warned about a pending visit from law enforcement, so he {{immediately}} phoned drummer Mitch Mitchell, who was at the nightclub Whisky a Go Go, and asked him to <b>come</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> house so that they could search for and remove any illegal drugs. They found a large assortment of substances in Hendrix's room that had apparently been given to him by fans. Soon afterwards, they were paid a visit by three detectives who told them that they were under police surveillance by officers living in a nearby house.|$|E
5|$|The {{government}} led by Montfort soon {{ran into}} problems. He negotiated a treaty with Llywelyn ap Gruffudd, the Prince of Wales, {{an act that}} made him unpopular with the English Marcher lords. In May Edward escaped captivity, {{with the help of}} Gilbert de Clare, Earl of Gloucester, who had now <b>come</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> royal side. Edward started on a campaign of re-conquest, while Montfort was forced to suppress a rebellion in the Marches. He succeeded only by making large concessions to Llewelyn, and then moved east to join forces with his son Simon. Edward, however, routed the younger Simon at Kenilworth Castle, and on 4 August 1265 Montfort found himself trapped at Evesham, forced to give battle with a much smaller army than the royals. The battle soon turned into a massacre; Montfort himself was killed and mutilated on the field. Even with Montfort dead resistance remained, particularly at the virtually impregnable Kenilworth Castle. In October 1266 the Dictum of Kenilworth set down terms by which the rebels could obtain pardons, {{and by the end of}} the year the garrison surrendered.|$|E
25|$|The Ottomans were {{encouraged}} to invade the Morea again, but were defeated by General Steinau and driven back to their base at Thebes. At the same time, Steinau succeeded in bringing Gerakaris to <b>come</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Venetian side (see above).|$|E

25|$|Gandhiji {{stayed in}} the Ashram {{and spoke to the}} volunteers. He tried to boost up their morale, by {{explaining}} to them the principle of Satyagraha and the role of scarifies and suffering in it, and the need for extreme patience. He tried to reach a compromise with the orthodoxy and for this; he had to meet the Savarna leaders. His secretary sent a note of invitation to the Savarna leader Idanthuruthil Devan Neelakandan Namboothiri to <b>come</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> camp. The haughty Namboothiri not only refused to accept the invitation, but also said that those who wanted to see him must go over to his house. So it was that Gandhiji and his party reached the Indanthuruthil Mana (a Namboothiri household) on the next day noon. They were made to sit in the portico of the house, while the Namboothiri and his Savarna comrades occupied the inner room. The Namboothiri believed that Gandhi and his followers were polluted by the touch of untouchables, and could not be admitted into the pure interior of an orthodox Mana.|$|E
500|$|When {{staff at}} the Rainbow told him of Corcoran's {{disappearance}} on 13 November, Smith telephoned the police station at Castle Vale saying that he wished to give a statement. Significantly, his call came at 4:00pm, before the body found in Worcestershire had been positively identified as Corcoran's, and within an hour Smith had presented himself at Castle Vale. Detective Constable Ruth Wilkins later recalled Smith's phone call: [...] "He {{said he would like}} to come to the police station to help with the inquiry and that he had seen [...] on Saturday night leave the pub with an unknown man. He insisted he would like to <b>come</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> police station. He said he had been asked to contact the police by someone else and gave his mobile number." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1780, after Benedict Arnold's {{attempted}} treason {{had been}} exposed, Captain Beesly Edgar Joel, a British defector and former {{officer in the}} British Army, claimed that another officer besides Arnold had attempted to defect, and after interrogation Joel named Howe as that officer. [...] Joel cited Edmund Fanning, William Tryon's secretary, as the source for his information. [...] Joel further described Howe's method of communicating with the British, which was {{by means of a}} frequently imprisoned-and-exchanged prisoner who would convey messages between the parties. [...] While neither Washington or the Congressional Board of War believed Joel's story due to their suspicion of Joel as a British spy, Joel was later commissioned by Thomas Jefferson and the Virginia government to lead a Patriot militia unit against Loyalists in that state. [...] Furthermore, William Smith, a New York Loyalist and the brother of Howe's agent and Arnold's co-conspirator Joshua Hett Smith, noted in his diary on April 29, 1780, that his brother, Thomas Smith, had been informed that a commissary had <b>come</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> British with [...] "information" [...] from the Patriots in much the same manner as Joel had described. On September 28, 1780, William Smith told Henry Clinton that he believed [...] "Bob" [...] Howe would be willing to turn on the Patriots.|$|E

2500|$|Pharaoh {{is unique}} in Prus' oeuvre as a {{historical}} novel. A Positivist by philosophical persuasion, Prus had long argued that historical novels must inevitably distort historic reality. [...] He had, however, eventually <b>come</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> view of the French Positivist critic Hippolyte Taine that the arts, including literature, may act as a second means alongside the sciences to study reality, including broad historic reality.|$|E
2500|$|Casual labourers {{and farm}} labourers have disappeared.

The conditions in which the urban poor and the professional people used to exist as independent social strata are virtually no longer present ... What is the point, then, of classifying these social strata into two different categories? And even if we were to try to devise a classification, how could we make it neat and clear-cut? ...|$|E
2500|$|Because {{there is}} so little room at the home where they live, Bramble Bellflower (...) decides that he and his family should move. He does not {{announce}} the plan until later, when the seven members <b>come</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> other side of the hill and look at their new property. They do not know that Bramble has actually bought and remodelled the house, which is called The Berries. It will be eight days before the family settles in their new spot. But Periwinkle, one of Bramble's five children, is deeply affected by the change of address; he is afraid he will miss his neighbour, Pimpernelle, and his old home, in the process. He finds his new room, which he will share with brother Dandelion, too large for his liking.|$|E

2500|$|On April 26, 2007, Tobias was {{questioned}} by Federal investigators, regarding any services {{he received from}} the escort service owned by Deborah Jeane Palfrey, who {{has been charged with}} prostitution-related racketeering. When reached by ABC News on April 26, Tobias said he had several times called the [...] "Pamela Martin and Associates" [...] escort service [...] "to have gals <b>come</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> condo to give me a massage." [...] Tobias, who is married, said there had been [...] "no sex," [...] and that recently he had been using another service [...] "with Central Americans" [...] to provide his [...] "massages." [...] The next day, April 27, 2007, Tobias resigned from his U. S. State Department position as Director of US Foreign Assistance and as Administrator of the United States Agency for International Development (USAID). A State Department press release said only he was leaving for [...] "personal reasons." ...|$|E
2500|$|Wanrong's {{younger brother}} Rong Qi remembered how Puyi and Wanrong, both teenagers, loved to race their {{bicycles}} through the Forbidden City, forcing eunuchs {{to get out}} of the way, and told Behr in an interview: [...] "There was a lot of laughter, she and Puyi seemed to get on well, they were like kids together." [...] In 1986, Behr interviewed one of Puyi's two surviving eunuchs, an 85year-old man who proved reluctant to answer the questions asked of him, but finally stated about Puyi's relationship with Wanrong: [...] "The Emperor would <b>come</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> nuptial apartments once every three months and spend the night there ... He leave early in the morning on the following day and for the rest of that day he would invariably be in a very filthy temper indeed." [...] Reginald Johnston arranged for the Marquis of Extended Grace Zhu Yuxun, a descendant of the Ming dynasty Imperial family, to visit Puyi in the Forbidden City in September1924, which was the first time the heirs of both the deposed Ming and Qing dynasties came face to face.|$|E
2500|$|On 10 July 1943, a {{combined}} force of American and British Commonwealth troops invaded Sicily in Operation Husky. German generals again {{took the lead}} in the defence and, although they lost the island, they succeeded in ferrying large numbers of German and Italian forces safely off Sicily to the Italian mainland. With the loss of Sicily, popular support for the war diminished in Italy. On 25 July 1943, the Grand Council of Fascism ousted Italian dictator Benito Mussolini and a new Italian government, led by General Pietro Badoglio and King Victor Emmanuel III, took over in Italy. Although the new government declared that Italy would go on fighting with the Axis, it immediately began secret negotiations with the Allies to end the fighting and to <b>come</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Allied side. On 3 September, a secret armistice was signed with the Allies at Fairfield Camp in Sicily. The armistice was announced to the public on 8 September. By then, the Allies were on the Italian mainland (landing unopposed because of the armistice). The Germans were aware that the Italy might defect from the Axis and strengthened their forces in Italy in preparation during the time of Italy's secret negotiations with the Allies. In the event, the Italian armed forces were given unclear instructions on how to treat their former German allies. Resistance was therefore slight as the Germans moved in and disarmed the Italians and took control of the northern part of Italy. (The exception to this was the navy that received orders to steam out of reach of the Germans. Therefore, few Italian ships fell into German hands.) The captured Italian soldiers were given the choice of imprisonment or to keep fighting for Germany. A minority choose to fight with the Germans. In the Balkans, that Italy had previously occupied alongside Germany, thousands of Italian soldiers evaded capture and joined the local resistance movements. To circumvent the ban on using prisoners of war as forced labor, the Germans re-designated their Italian prisoners as [...] "military internees" [...] and shipped them to Germany as slave labor.|$|E
