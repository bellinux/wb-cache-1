5|$|By 1 December, the PVA 58th Division was {{virtually}} destroyed, {{with the remainder}} waiting for reinforcements from the 26th Corps of the 9th Army. But much to the frustration of Song Shi-Lun, the 26th Corps did not arrive before the Marines broke out of Yudam-ni. The airfield was opened to traffic on 1 December, allowing UN forces to bring in reinforcements and to evacuate {{the dead and the}} wounded. With the Marines at Yudam-ni completing their withdrawal on 4 December, the trapped UN forces <b>could</b> <b>finally</b> start their breakout towards the port of Hungnam.|$|E
5|$|It was {{announced}} at a general meeting on 22 March 1895 that the club <b>could</b> <b>finally</b> {{afford to buy}} Goodison Park. Mahon revealed that Everton were buying Goodison Park for £650 less than the price of Anfield three years earlier, with Goodison Park having more land and a 25% larger capacity. The motion to purchase Goodison Park was passed unanimously. Dr. Baxter also lent the club £5,000 to redeem the mortgage early {{at a rate of}} 3½%. By this time the redrawing of political boundaries put Walton, and hence Goodison Park, inside the City of Liverpool.|$|E
5|$|At 20:15, {{the camp}} was secured from the Japanese and Prince fired his flare to signal {{the end of the}} assault. No gunfire had {{occurred}} for the last fifteen minutes. However, as the Rangers headed towards the meetup, Cpl. Roy Sweezy was shot twice by friendly fire, and later died. The Rangers and the weary, frail, and disease-ridden POWs {{made their way to the}} appointed Pampanga River rendezvous, where a caravan of 26carabao carts waited to transport them to Plateros, driven by local villagers organized by Pajota. At 20:40, once Prince determined that everyone had crossed the Pampanga River, he fired his second flare to indicate to Pajota and Joson's men to withdraw. The Scouts stayed behind at the meetup to survey the area for enemy retaliatory movements. Meanwhile, Pajota's men continued to resist the attacking enemy until they <b>could</b> <b>finally</b> withdraw at 22:00, when the Japanese forces stopped charging the bridge. Joson and his men met no opposition, and they returned to help escort the POWs.|$|E

5|$|Bonaparte's {{position}} as First Consul was {{strengthened by the}} successful outcome of the battle and the preceding campaign. After this victory, Napoleon could breathe a sigh of relief. The generals who had been hostile to him could see that his luck had not abandoned him. Thus, he had surpassed Schérer, Joubert, Championnet, and even Moreau, none {{of whom had been}} able to inflict a decisive blow on the Coalition. Moreau's victory at Hohenlinden, which was the one that in reality had {{put an end to the}} war, was minimised by Bonaparte who, from then on, would pose as a saviour of the fatherland, and even of the Republic. He rejected offers from Louis XVIII, who had considered the Consulate to be a mere transition towards the restoration of the king. Thanks to the victory at Marengo, Napoleon <b>could</b> <b>finally</b> set about reforming France according to his own vision.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} January, the KPA II Corps was {{decimated}} {{during its}} guerrilla operations, and its estimated strength was reduced from 16,000 to 8,000. The KPA V Corps' attempt to capture Wonju had also resulted in crippling casualties, and its estimated strength was reduced from 32,000 to 22,000 {{by the end of}} January. In contrast, the UN losses were relatively moderate during the same period. The defeat of the North Korean army enabled the UN forces to consolidate their positions along the Korean central and eastern front, and the retreating US Eighth Army on the Korean western front <b>could</b> <b>finally</b> return to the offensive after its rear and eastern flank were secured. As soon as the US X Corps regained full control of the central front at the end of January, Ridgway immediately ordered the US Eighth Army to launch Operation Thunderbolt against Chinese and North Korean forces on January 25, 1951.|$|E
5|$|The ice-cutting {{involved}} several {{stages and}} was typically {{carried out at}} night, when the ice was thickest. First the surface would be cleaned of snow with scrapers, {{the depth of the}} ice tested for suitability, then the surface would be marked out with cutters to produce the lines of the future ice blocks. The size of the blocks varied according to the destination, the largest being for the furthest locations, the smallest destined for the American east coast itself and being only 22inches (0.56 m) square. The blocks <b>could</b> <b>finally</b> be cut out of the ice and floated to the shore. The speed of the operation might depend on the likelihood of warmer weather impacting on the ice. In both New England and Norway, harvesting occurred during an otherwise quiet season, providing valuable local employment.|$|E

25|$|In Poland, {{which had}} {{suffered}} {{the loss of}} six million citizens, including its elite and almost its entire Jewish population due to Lebensraum and the Holocaust, most Germans were seen as Nazi-perpetrators who <b>could</b> now <b>finally</b> be collectively punished for their past deeds.|$|R
50|$|A loyal {{minister}} Zheng Dan {{tried to}} give some sound advice to King Ling, but King Ling {{knew that there was}} nothing he <b>could</b> do. <b>Finally</b> Zheng Dan went to the rebels and told them that the king was depressed by what had happened.|$|R
5|$|There {{was also}} the {{secondary}} capital city of Luoyang, which was the favored capital of the two by Empress Wu. In the year 691 she had more than 100,000 families (more than 500,000 people) from around the region of Chang'an move to populate Luoyang instead. With {{a population of about}} a million, Luoyang became the second largest city in the empire, and with its close proximity to the Luo River it benefited from southern agricultural fertility and trade traffic of the Grand Canal. However, the Tang court eventually demoted its capital status and did not visit Luoyang after the year 743, when Chang'an's problem of acquiring adequate supplies and stores for the year was solved. As early as 736, granaries were built at critical points along the route from Yangzhou to Chang'an, which eliminated shipment delays, spoilage, and pilfering. An artificial lake used as a transshipment pool was dredged east of Chang'an in 743, where curious northerners <b>could</b> <b>finally</b> see the array of boats found in southern China, delivering tax and tribute items to the imperial court.|$|E
25|$|After various {{legal battles}} he {{inherited}} from the Marescottis, Capizucchis and Ruspolis. On September 4, 1705, by notarial act Floridi, he <b>could</b> <b>finally</b> add to his titles that of Marquis of Cerveteri.|$|E
25|$|The {{conquest of}} Mexico was a {{critical}} stage in the Spanish colonization of the Americas. Ultimately, Spain conquered Mexico and thereby gained substantial access to the Pacific Ocean, which meant that the Spanish Empire <b>could</b> <b>finally</b> achieve its original oceanic goal of reaching the Asian markets.|$|E
50|$|Johnson {{continued}} to perform where he <b>could,</b> and was <b>finally</b> awarded full rights to his hit song in 1999.|$|R
30|$|As {{a direct}} consequence, {{otherwise}} previously scattered data <b>could</b> be <b>finally</b> explored, analysed and compared {{in a more}} efficient way, providing for example the municipal functionaries with selected “views” regarding specific aspects, such as the annual thermal or electrical consumption normalised by the volume and grouped by building use.|$|R

25|$|Augusta enjoyed life in Koblenz and it {{was here}} that she <b>could</b> <b>finally</b> live out court life as she was {{accustomed}} to during her childhood in Weimar. Meanwhile, their son Friedrich (Frederick) studied nearby in Bonn and became the first Prussian prince to receive an academic education.|$|E
25|$|Restoration failed twice, but {{the project}} of 1974 <b>could</b> <b>finally</b> be {{realized}} two years later. The spa reopened in 1977. Prospects for further thermal springs were successful in 1982, and a new outdoor pool could be added a year later. Today, the spa welcomes more than 1200 visitors per day.|$|E
25|$|Scharoun's {{original}} designs {{had planned}} a similar cladding, {{which was not}} implemented at the time for cost reasons. After the reunification of Berlin Potsdamer Platz, adjacent {{to the east of}} the Kulturforum, was rebuilt; by this Scharoun's designs concerning city redevelopment of the area <b>could</b> <b>finally</b> be recorded as complete.|$|E
50|$|For {{the next}} decade, the club did not {{particularly}} stand {{out of the}} ranks of Berlin football clubs. Only in 1933 <b>could</b> it <b>finally</b> win a championship in the local Kreisklasse but {{the change in the}} German football league system, the introduction of the Gauligas, prevented the team from being promoted.|$|R
6000|$|ONE day, {{on board}} the 'Aleck Scott,' my chief, Mr. Bixby, was {{crawling}} carefully through a close place at Cat Island, both leads going, and everybody holding his breath.

50|$|Rivera next faced {{another long}} layoff. When his first defense <b>could</b> be <b>finally</b> held. Rivera lost his title {{when he was}} knocked out in four rounds by Calvin Grove, on January 23, 1988 in Gamaches, France. Sixteen months passed between the moment that Rivera won the world {{championship}} and his first title defense.|$|R
25|$|Only {{after the}} 1920s German {{inflation}} was over Großprofil cars <b>could</b> <b>finally</b> be ordered. In 1924, the first 16 multiple units and 8 normal passenger cars were delivered. Because they had big elliptical front windows, they were commonly called Tunneleulen ("tunnel owls"). The cars were 13.15 meters long and had 3 double sliding doors. This series was called BI.|$|E
25|$|In late 2006, Elefante {{took this}} {{opportunity}} to consider something he had never done in his career: catch his breath. Even with his reduced schedule, he needed a break. The brothers closed the label, and Elefante <b>could</b> <b>finally</b> take some {{time away from the}} industry. This proved more challenging than expected, and despite his best intentions, he served as producer on three albums in 2007.|$|E
25|$|Digging of {{the well}} also created problems. First {{attempts}} could only reach 40 meters, at which point work was suspended {{due to a lack}} of skilled labor. A special permit to import the required dynamite was acquired, but it was only when a foreign expert was brought in that work on the well <b>could</b> <b>finally</b> be resumed and water was finally struck at 93 meters. The well was deepened to a 100 meters.|$|E

60|$|Defarge {{drew out}} the key, closed the door, locked {{it on the}} inside, took out the key again, {{and held it in}} his hand. All this he did, methodically, and with as loud and harsh an accompaniment of noise as he <b>could</b> make. <b>Finally,</b> he walked across the room with a {{measured}} tread to where the window was. He stopped there, and faced round.|$|R
50|$|For the 2014 season, he was loaned to Doncaster. He played just 3 {{games before}} being {{recalled}} {{to play in}} the first team for Hull F.C. Since then, he has made 8 appearances for the club and <b>could</b> be <b>finally</b> cementing his place in the starting 13. Dean has scored 2 tries for the club, one of them against Huddersfield in a 30-6 victory.|$|R
25|$|Guiuan in Eastern Samar was {{the point}} of Haiyan's first landfall, and was {{severely}} affected due to the typhoon's impacts. Nearly all structures in the township suffered at least partial damage, many of which were completely flattened. For several days following Haiyan's first landfall, the damage situation in the fishing town remained unclear due to lack of communication. However, the damage <b>could</b> <b>finally</b> be assessed after Philippine Air Force staff arrived in Guiuan on November 10.|$|E
25|$|After {{only ten}} years of peace, {{a new series of}} wars between the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth and Sweden, which had claimed Estonia after the Livonian War, ravaged Livonia from 1592. Eventually, the Swedes were victorious. In 1629, they <b>could</b> <b>finally</b> call Livonia and the city of Riga their own. Under the 17th Century Swedish Kings Gustav II Adolf and Charles XI, general {{elementary}} education was introduced, the Bible was translated in Estonian and Latvian, and a university was founded in Tartu in southern Estonia.|$|E
25|$|Before {{meeting the}} top-ranked assassin, Travis is {{told that the}} UAA was just an {{elaborate}} con set up by Sylvia, who overheard his drunken ramblings and organized his entry so that he <b>could</b> <b>finally</b> have revenge on his half-sister, Jeane, who murdered his parents. Jeane reveals in a fast-forwarded cutscene that their father had sexually abused her all her life, thus forcing her to become a prostitute to survive and become a killer. Travis is eventually saved by Shinobu and kills Jeane.|$|E
50|$|On 25 May 1654, {{almost seven}} years after Pomerania had lost her {{independence}} and only after Bogislaw's wife Elisabeth of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg had died, <b>could</b> Bogislaw's body <b>finally</b> be put to rest in Stettin.|$|R
50|$|He {{started his}} youth career in Asker before joining Lyn. He {{was in the}} first-team squad for two seasons, but never got to play in Tippeligaen. Having been loaned back to Asker in 2006, he joined Hønefoss ahead of the 2007 season. Another spell in Asker followed, then Strømmen before joining Mjøndalen in 2014. When they won promotion, Rasch <b>could</b> then <b>finally</b> make his debut on the highest tier in 2015.|$|R
50|$|In mid-February 2011, Moraes {{signed with}} Associação Naval 1º de Maio also in Portugal.
