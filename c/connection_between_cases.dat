A little emphasized tool that experts use to help them reason is to refer back to previous problem solving experiences, interpreting and applying those experiences as they solve problems. Results from a pilot study conducted Fall Semester 2002 suggest that improvement in interpreting and applying expert cases to solve a problem may also lead to improvement in certain scientific reasoning skills. In this paper, we seek to explore the <b>connection</b> <b>between</b> <b>case</b> application and scientific reasoning skills, namely, using evidence to justify a claim, generating hypotheses, making predictions, and explaining scientific phenomena...|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} be able {{possibly}} to influence the occurrence of premature termination by means of appropriate and timely measures, it is necessary among other things to have a knowledge of the type of terminations occurring and of the conditions which can lead to a trainee dropping out of a training course. This necessitates, in addition to theoretical clarifications and empirical studies of the phenomenology of the occurrence of premature terminations, also statistical analyses of cases of premature termination of initial training in occupational rehabilitation. Thus in the general planning of the study, two types of study were designed: differentiating studies on the cause-related analysis of premature terminations of training and on the development of an appropriate methodical instrument, as well as orientation studies on the analysis of data from the 'statistics on occupational rehabilitation from the Federal Employment Service' (Bundesanstalt für Arbeit) (Reha statistics St 37). The contents of this article deal with the results of the orientation study. It concerns the analysis of the following issues: the proportion of young people who dropped out of initial vocational training which commenced in 1991 (drop-out rate); distribution of the drop-outs over the period of the vocational training; ratio of drop-outs occurring {{in the first year of}} training; differences in the occurrence of dropping out of training in the first year of training for the years 1991 to 1994; differences between the old and new federal states in these years; <b>connection</b> <b>between</b> <b>cases</b> of dropping out of training and features of the rehabilitation statistics. With the drop-out rate a distinction is made between 'gross drop-out rate' and 'net drop-out rate'. For the evaluation of the relevant data from the rehabilitation statistics both descriptive and multivariate statistical procedures were used. However, as the results reveal, definite statements can only be obtained with regard to some of the subjects or questions. This leads to the assumption discussed from various points of view, that at the level of orientation studies it is hardly possible to obtain systematic statements regarding the conditions, main emphasis, unusual features or peculiarities of the termination of the training course. Thus to begin with differentiating studies should be favoured in particular for reasons connected with establishing criteria which have sufficient reliability.

40|$|A {{forensic}} intelligence process was conducted over cross-border seizures of false identity documents whose sources were partly {{known to be}} the same. Visual features of 300 counterfeit Portuguese and French identity cards seized in France and Switzerland were observed and integrated in a structured database developed to detect and analyze forensic links. Based on a few batches of documents known to come from common sources, the forensic profiling method could be validated and its performance evaluated. The method also proved efficient and complementary to conventional means of detecting <b>connections</b> <b>between</b> <b>cases.</b> Cross-border links were detected, highlighting {{the need for more}} collaboration. Forensic intelligence could be produced, uncovering the structure of counterfeits' illegal trade, the concentration of their sources and the evolution of their quality over time. In addition, two case examples illustrated how forensic profiling may support specific investigations. The {{forensic intelligence}} process and its results will underline the need to develop such approaches to support the fight against fraudulent documents and organized crime...|$|R
40|$|In {{the recent}} {{literature}} {{there is growing}} interest in the morpho-syntactic encoding of hierarchical effects. The paper investigates one domain where such effects are attested: ergative splits conditioned by person. This type of splits is then compared to hierarchical effects in direct-inverse alternations. On the basis of two case studies (Lummi instantiating an ergative split person language and Passamaquoddy an inverse language) we offer an account that makes no use of hierarchies as a primitive. We propose that the two language types differ {{as far as the}} location of person features is concerned. In inverse systems person features are located exclusively in T, while in ergative systems, they are located in T and a particular type of v. A consequence of our analysis is that Case checking in split and inverse systems is guided by the presence/absence of specific phi-features. This in turn provides evidence for a close <b>connection</b> <b>between</b> <b>Case</b> and phi-features, reminiscent of Chomsky’s (2000, 2001) Agree...|$|R

The SICADs are manned by federal and local police officers that gather, assess and spread intelligence and information within the local and federal police forces. This is to facilitate the coordination of investigations and even day-to-day police operations. Each SICAD processes the criminal data from the local and federal police forces to analyze recent cases and events, thus identifying trends and issuing any necessary warnings. It also correlates the <b>connections</b> <b>between</b> <b>cases,</b> people, vehicles, etc. and sorts information for operational and strategic purposes. Each SICAD contributes to the cross-border exchange of police data and supports the managers of the police zones with data processing capabilities. Each chief of investigations has overall responsibility for a SICAD but a department chief ensures the daily management of the centre.|$|R

40|$|As the law moves inexorably to {{a digital}} {{publication}} {{model in which}} books no longer play a role, {{the problem of how}} to continue to make the law available to all becomes more acute. Open access initiatives already exist, and more are on the way, but all are limited by their inability to provide more than self-indexed search options for their users. Self-indexing, although a powerful alternative to the traditional pre-indexed searching made possible by systems like West’s “Key Number” digests, has inherent limitations which make it a poor choice as the sole means of researching the law. But developing a new pre-indexed legal digest would be a prohibitively expensive and complex undertaking, making it unlikely that open access legal information sites can develop and maintain a fully-implemented digesting approach to legal research. This article proposes a reconceptualization of the information already contained within most American judicial opinions in order to permit open access sites to offer a form of pre-indexed research to their users. By mapping a case’s location in a graphical representation of the doctrinal development of an issue under consideration, this approach allows the court’s citations to prior authority to act as a pre-indexing tool, allows the researcher to update the law by showing more recent cases that have cited to the target case, and gives the researcher the opportunity to trace network links in order to uncover <b>connections</b> <b>between</b> <b>cases</b> that might otherwise have been difficult to discern...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. We {{introduce}} PriCL: {{the first}} framework for expressing and automatically reasoning about privacy case law {{by means of}} precedent. PriCL is parametric in an underlying logic for expressing world prop-erties, and provides support for court decisions, their justification, {{the circumstances in which}} the justification applies as well as court hierar-chies. Moreover, the framework offers a tight <b>connection</b> <b>between</b> privacy <b>case</b> law and the notion of norms that underlies existing rule-based pri-vacy research. In terms of automation, we identify the major reasoning tasks for privacy cases such as deducing legal permissions or extract-ing norms. For solving these tasks, we provide generic algorithms that have particularly efficient realizations within an expressive underlying logic. Finally, we derive a definition of deducibility based on legal con-cepts and subsequently propose an equivalent characterization in terms of logic satisfiability...|$|R
