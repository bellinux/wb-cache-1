5|$|Along {{with other}} members of the lipocalin protein family, major urinary {{proteins}} can be potent allergens to humans. The reason for this is not known, however molecular mimicry between Mups and structurally similar human lipocalins has been proposed as a possible explanation. The protein product of the mouse Mup17 gene, known as Musm1, Ag1 or MA1, accounts for much of the allergenic properties of mouse urine. The protein is extremely stable in the environment; studies have found 95% of inner city homes, and 82% of all types of homes in the United States have detectable levels in at least one room. Similarly, Ratn1 is a known human allergen. A US study found its presence in 33% of inner city homes, and 21% of occupants were sensitized to the allergen. Exposure and sensitization to rodent Mup proteins is considered a risk factor for <b>childhood</b> <b>asthma,</b> and is a leading cause of laboratory animal allergy (LAA)—an occupational disease of laboratory animal technicians and scientists. One study found that two-thirds of laboratory workers who had developed asthmatic reactions to animals had antibodies to Ratn1.|$|E

2500|$|Because of <b>childhood</b> <b>asthma,</b> chronic ear infections, and {{generally}} frail health, Lomax had mostly been home schooled in elementary school. In Dallas, {{he entered the}} Terrill School for Boys (a tiny prep school that later became St. Mark's School of Texas). Lomax excelled at Terrill and then transferred to the Choate School (now Choate Rosemary Hall) in Connecticut for a year, graduating eighth in his class at age 15 in 1930. Because of his mother's declining health, however, rather than going to Harvard as his father had wished, Lomax matriculated at the University of Texas at Austin. A roommate, future anthropologist Walter Goldschmidt, recalled Lomax as [...] "frighteningly smart, probably classifiable as a genius", though Goldschmidt remembers Lomax exploding one night while studying: [...] "Damn it! The hardest thing I've had to learn is that I'm not a genius." [...] At the University of Texas Lomax read Nietzsche and developed an interest in philosophy. He joined and wrote a few columns for the school paper, The Daily Texan but resigned when it refused to publish an editorial he had written on birth control. At this time he also he began collecting [...] "race" [...] records and taking his dates to black-owned night clubs, {{at the risk of}} expulsion. During the spring term his mother died, and his youngest sister Bess, age 10, was sent to live with an aunt. Although the Great Depression was rapidly causing his family's resources to plummet, Harvard came up with enough financial aid for the 16-year-old Lomax to spend his sophomore year there. He enrolled in philosophy and physics and also [...] pursued a long-distance informal reading course in Plato and the Pre-Socratics with University of Texas professor Albert P. Brogan. He also became involved in radical politics and came down with pneumonia. His grades suffered, diminishing his financial aid prospects. Lomax, now 17, therefore took a break from studying to join his father's folk song collecting field trips for the Library of Congress, co-authoring American Ballads and Folk Songs (1934) and Negro Folk Songs as Sung by Lead Belly (1936). His first field collecting [...] without his father was done with Zora Neale Hurston and Mary Elizabeth Barnicle in the summer of 1935. He returned to the University of Texas that fall and was awarded a BA in Philosophy, summa cum laude, and membership in Phi Beta Kappa in May 1936. Lack of money prevented him from immediately attending graduate school at the University of Chicago, as he desired, but he would later correspond with and pursue graduate studies with Melville J.

To analyse the association between adenoidectomy and/or tonsillectomy in <b>childhood</b> and <b>asthma,</b> AR, and eczema at age 21 years, relative risks (RR) were calculated. RESULTS: Six hundred and ninety-three (66 %) members completed the questionnaire at age 21 years, of whom 104 (15 %) had undergone adenoidectomy and/or tonsillectomy and 262 (38 %) reported atopic disease. Children who underwent adenoidectomy and/or tonsillectomy before the age of 8 years were not more likely to develop asthma, AR, or eczema at the age of 21 years than children who did not; RR 0. 93 (95 % confidence limits (CL) 0. 52 - 1. 64), RR 0. 94 (CL 0. 68 - 1. 30), and RR 1. 00 (CL 0. 59 - 1. 68), respectively.

The aim {{of this study is to}} investigate the effect of altitude on the prevalence and morbidity of <b>childhood</b> bronchial <b>asthma.</b> Methods. A questionnaire regarding the history and symptoms of asthma was distributed to 874 children aged 6 - 12 years, to be completed by their parents with the help of their pediatrician. A total of 583 children lived at sea level, 180 at an attitude between 501 and 800 meters, and 111 at an altitude between 801 and 1, 200 meters. All children with recurrent cough, shortness of breath, wheezing, and a history of bronchial asthma were considered to have bronchial asthma. Results. The prevalence of <b>childhood</b> bronchial <b>asthma</b> in the mountains (800 - 1, 200 meters) was twice as low as that at sea level (15. 8 % of children) (p < 0. 01).
