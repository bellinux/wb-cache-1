40|$|Abstract. The ITER CS {{is in an}} {{advanced}} state of design. Detailed analysis continues. In this paper, finite element analyses done by the US PT are presented. These analyses relate to a few issues still requiring some resolution. Finite element analyses by the ITER International Team (IT) and other US PT analyses are cited for comparison with the finite element results. The degree of preload required to offset vertical tensions in the coils are discussed. Parametric analyses of different preloads and friction coefficients have been performed which point to a lower preload than that specified by the project. Lateral loading on the CS due to postulated off center electromagnetic loads are quantified. Lateral seismic loads are applied, and the existing and proposed restraint systems are discussed. Behavior of the upper flex supports is also available from the simulation model and will be compared with previous work. The coil leads are supported by the preload system tie-plates. Radial differential motion between the tie-plates and coils is quantified for the case {{where there is no}} radial coupling between the coils and tie-plates. Support provisions for the leads are discussed in the context of both load capacity and displacement absorbing ability. vertical loads on the CS. Torsional registration between the modules is provided by interlocking the modules with radial grooves and keys. The compliance of the <b>coil</b> <b>stack</b> and the differential loads along the height of the stack cause small but significant rotations at the flex plates, which are designed primarily for purely radial displacements. There is a lower restraint system for the CS but its required loading has not been well defined [6]. Electromagnetic loads {{have been found to be}} small at this lower support. Seismic loads are more significant and require reconsideration of the design for the lower restraint system...|$|E

At low T*, disks crystallize into ordered lamellar, ordered perforated lamellar, and ordered cylinder phases. We find that the confine-ment imposed on the disks by the attached coils strongly contributes to the ordered stacking of the disks. In particular, the ordered cylinder phase contains highly ordered disks stacked in parallel due to the cylindrical confinement of the coils that restricts the system to a single degree of freedom associated with the director vector of the disks.

Disc stack stress and opening characteristics vs. applied pressure may be determined with simplified analytically derived model and full 2 D model including almost all significant forces and moments in a stack of circular plates.

Practical implications: A valve system has to withstand the cyclic pressure load across the piston. The number of discs, their diameters and thicknesses directly affect durability of a valve system. Damper force and valve durability expressed in life-cycles are the optimization criteria considering during selection and tuning of a valve system.

Full 3 -D models have been developed, but their use for simulating superconducting devices is a very challenging task involving a large-scale computational problem. In this work, we present a new method to simulate the electromagnetic transient behavior of 2 G HTS <b>stacks</b> and <b>coils.</b> The method, originally used to model stacks of straight superconducting tapes or circular coils in 2 D, is now extended to 3 D. The main idea is to construct an anisotropic bulklike equivalent for the <b>stack</b> or <b>coil,</b> such that the geometrical layout of the internal alternating structures of insulating, metallic, superconducting and substrate layers is reduced while keeping the overall electromagnetic behavior of the original device. Besides the aforementioned interest in modeling and simulating 2 G HTS coated conductors, this work gives a further step towards efficient 3 D modeling and simulation of superconducting devices for large scale applications...|$|R
40|$|AIM: To {{investigate}} the normal hepatic {{magnetic resonance spectroscopy}} findings choline/lipid 2 (Cho/Lip 2) associated with age and body mass index (BMI). METHODS: A total of 58 single-voxel proton spectra of the liver were acquired at 3. 0 T using the eight-channel phased array abdominal coil as the receiver <b>coil.</b> Consecutive <b>stacks</b> of breath-hold spectra were acquired using the point resolved spectroscopy technique at a short echo time of 30 ms and a repetition time of 1500 ms. The spectra were processed with the SAGE software package. Areas and heights for metabolite resonance were obtained. Student&#x 2019;s t test for unpaired data was used for comparisons of shimming, Cho/Lip 2, and lipid content. RESULTS: There were significant negative correlations between the Cho/Lip 2 peak height ratios and BMI (r = - 0. 615) and age (r = - 0. 398) (all P < 0. 01). Compared with the high-BMI group, the low-BMI group was younger (39. 1 1; 13. 0 years vs 47. 6 1; 8. 5 years, t = - 2. 954, P = 0. 005); had better water suppression (93. 4 % 1; 1. 4 % vs 85. 6 % 1; 11. 6 %, t = 2. 741, P = 0. 014); had higher Cho/Lip 2 peak heights ratio (0. 2 1; 0. 14 vs 0. 05 1; 0. 04, t = 6. 033, P < 0. 000); and had lower lipid content (0. 03 1; 0. 08 vs 0. 29 1; 0. 31, t = - 3. 309, P = 0. 004). Compared with the older group, the younger group had better shimming effects (17. 1 1; 3. 6 Hz vs 22. 0 1; 6. 8 Hz, t = - 2. 919, P = 0. 008); higher Cho/Lip 2 peak heights ratios (0. 03 1; 0. 05 vs 0. 09 1; 0. 12, t = 2. 4, P = 0. 020); and lower lipid content (0. 05 1; 0. 11 vs 0. 23 1; 0. 32, t = - 2. 337, P = 0. 031). Compared with the low-choline peak group, the high-choline peak group had lower lipid content (0. 005 1; 0. 002 vs 0. 13 1; 0. 23, t = - 3. 796, P < 0. 000); lower BMI (19. 6 1; 2. 4 vs 23. 9 1; 3. 0, t = - 4. 410, P < 0. 000); and younger age (34. 7 1; 10. 0 years vs 43. 2 1; 12. 5 years, t = - 2. 088, P = 0. 041). CONCLUSION: Lipid accumulation could result from the increased fat in the body depending on age and BMI. Lipid can mask the resonance signal of choline...|$|R
