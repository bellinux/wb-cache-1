25|$|Heising (constant-current) modulation: RF {{amplifier}} plate voltage is {{fed through}} a “choke” (high-value inductor). The AM modulation tube plate is fed {{through the same}} inductor, so the modulator tube diverts current from the RF amplifier.

25|$|The {{simplest}} {{method to}} measure the electrical resistance of a sample of some material is to place it in an electrical circuit in series with a <b>current</b> <b>source</b> I and measure the resulting voltage V across the sample. The resistance of the sample is given by Ohm's law as R=V/I. If the voltage is zero, {{this means that the}} resistance is zero.|$|E
25|$|On {{the input}} {{side of the}} two-port we have Rf. If the voltage at {{the right side of}} Rf changes, it changes the current in Rf that is {{subtracted}} from the current entering the base of the input transistor. That is, the input side of the two-port is a dependent <b>current</b> <b>source</b> controlled by the voltage at the top of resistor R2.|$|E
40|$|Abstract:- The paper proposes two novel perfect-matching layout {{techniques}} {{for four or}} more cascode <b>current</b> <b>sources.</b> The purpose {{is to reduce the}} matching sensitivity of linear parameter gradients in high performance integrated circuit applications. One layout technique for matching four <b>current</b> <b>sources</b> consists of three sets of four-segment rectangular structure and utilizes two level hierarchies to equalize the outputs of four <b>current</b> <b>sources.</b> Another proposed novel layout technique adopts an inner four-segment two-current-source rectangular structure to uniformly distribute the current to outer four-segment four-current-source rectangular structure for perfect matching. The latter topology has better area efficiency. Furthermore, these two proposed layout techniques can be easily extended to 8, 16 or more perfect matching <b>current</b> <b>sources.</b> With MATLAB simulations, both layouts are verified to completely eliminate current mismatch caused by the linear gradient of threshold voltage.

25|$|In {{practice}} the ideal impedances are {{not possible to}} achieve. For any particular circuit, a small-signal analysis {{is often used to}} find the actual impedance. A small-signal AC test current Ix is applied to the input or output node, all external sources are set to AC zero, and the corresponding alternating voltage Vx across the test <b>current</b> <b>source</b> determines the impedance seen at that node as R = Vx / Ix.|$|E
25|$|The {{impedance}} seen by {{the load}} needs further discussion. The load in Figure 5 {{is connected to the}} collector of the output transistor, and therefore is separated from the body of the amplifier by the infinite impedance of the output <b>current</b> <b>source.</b> Therefore, feedback has no effect on the output impedance, which remains simply RC2 as {{seen by the}} load resistor RL in Figure 3.

25|$|After 50 years, {{during which}} {{solid-state}} electronic components have largely displaced the vacuum tube, the photomultiplier remains {{a unique and}} important optoelectronic component. Perhaps its most useful quality is that it acts, electronically, as a nearly perfect <b>current</b> <b>source,</b> owing to the high voltage utilized in extracting the tiny currents associated with weak light signals. There is no Johnson noise associated with photomultiplier signal currents, {{even though they are}} greatly amplified, e.g., by 100 thousand times (i.e., 100dB) or more. The photocurrent still contains shot noise.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — The {{utilization}} of variable <b>current</b> <b>sources,</b> in Comparator-Based Switched-Capacitor (CBSC) circuits, {{instead of the}} traditional constant <b>current</b> <b>sources,</b> reveals itself {{as one of the}} effective ways to increase speed while maintaining the accuracy. In this paper, a Level-Shifting Variable Current Charging Technique is proposed to implement variable <b>current</b> <b>sources</b> for CBSC circuits. The CBSC gain stage obtained with the proposed technique is applied to a 2 - 1 Cascaded Multi-Stage (MASH) △Σ modulator implemented in 90 nm CMOS for WCDMA applications.

25|$|For example, for a current-{{feedback}} amplifier, current {{from the}} output is sampled for feedback and combined with current at the input. Therefore, the feedback ideally {{is performed using}} an (output) current-controlled <b>current</b> <b>source</b> (CCCS), and its imperfect realization using a two-port network also must incorporate a CCCS, that is, the appropriate choice for feedback network is a g-parameter two-port. Here the two-port method used in most textbooks is presented, using the circuit treated in the article on asymptotic gain model.|$|E
25|$|A {{press release}} announces that the orbiter has {{detected}} methane in the Martian atmosphere. Although the amount is small, about 10 parts {{in a thousand}} million, it has excited scientists to question its source. Since methane {{is removed from the}} Martian atmosphere very rapidly, there must be a <b>current</b> <b>source</b> that replenishes it. Because one of the possible sources could be microbial life, it is planned to verify the reliability of these data and especially watch for difference in the concentration in various places on Mars. It is hoped that the source of this gas can be discovered by finding its location of release.|$|E
25|$|The μA709, which {{followed}} the compromised μA702, became a technical and commercial success. Widlar increased the μA709's voltage gain tenfold over {{that of the}} μA702 (70,000 vs. 7,000), and improved output performance with a push-pull output stage, although the output lacked protection against short circuit. The input stage was governed by a Widlar <b>current</b> <b>source</b> which allowed operation at low currents. The transistors were equipped with beta-compensation resistors to level the inevitable mismatch in their performance. Fairchild R staff spoke against Widlar's decision to employ lateral PNP transistors. Widlar locked himself up for 170 hours of continuous experimental work and {{came out with a}} robust design that blended two resistive diffusion areas into a lateral PNP device.|$|E

25|$|An {{alternative}} view is {{that the}} voltage at the top of R2 is set by the emitter current of the output transistor. That view leads to an entirely passive feedback network made up of R2 and Rf. The variable controlling the feedback is the emitter current, so the feedback is a current-controlled <b>current</b> <b>source</b> (CCCS). We search through the four available two-port networks and find the only one with a CCCS is the g-parameter two-port, shown in Figure 4. The next task is to select the g-parameters so that the two-port of Figure 4 is electrically equivalent to the L-section made up of R2 and Rf. That selection is an algebraic procedure made most simply by looking at two individual cases: the case with V1 = 0, which makes the VCVS {{on the right side of}} the two-port a short-circuit; and the case with I2 = 0. which makes the CCCS on the left side an open circuit. The algebra in these two cases is simple, much easier than solving for all variables at once. The choice of g-parameters that make the two-port and the L-section behave the same way are shown in the table below.|$|E

25|$|Small {{changes in}} the voltage applied across the base–emitter {{terminals}} cause the current between the emitter and the collector to change significantly.
