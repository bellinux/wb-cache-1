5|$|In 1920 Neubronner {{found that}} {{ten years of}} hard work and {{considerable}} expenses had been rewarded only with his inclusion in encyclopedias and the satisfaction that an ancillary technology, the mobile dovecote (described below), had proved its worth in the war. Neubronner's panoramic <b>camera</b> <b>is</b> displayed at the German Museum of Technology in Berlin and the Deutsches Museum in Munich.|$|E
5|$|The {{inspiration}} for the title sequence, set inside the secret laboratory of Dr Hassler, was the espionage theme embodied by the character: in what Archer and Hearn describe as an imitation of the style of 1960s James Bond films, a miniature <b>camera</b> <b>is</b> seen to be concealed inside Hassler's artificial eye.|$|E
5|$|As with Windows 8, all {{certified}} devices must {{ship with}} UEFI Secure Boot enabled by default. Unlike Windows 8, OEMs {{are no longer}} required to make Secure Boot settings user-configurable, meaning that devices may optionally be locked to run only Microsoft-signed operating systems. A supported infrared-illuminated <b>camera</b> <b>is</b> required for Windows Hello face authentication. Device Guard requires a UEFI system with no third-party certificates loaded, and CPU virtualization extensions (including SLAT and IOMMU) enabled in firmware.|$|E
50|$|The 70mm Fox Grandeur <b>cameras</b> <b>were</b> {{manufactured}} by Mitchell <b>Camera</b> Corporation, and <b>were</b> {{based on the}} Mitchell standard 35mm camera, enlarged to accommodate 70mm 4-perf film. The <b>cameras</b> <b>were</b> designated as Mitchell Model FC cameras, the FC designation most likely standing for Fox-Case, as the technical specifications and orders for the <b>cameras</b> <b>were</b> submitted to Mitchell by the Fox-Case Corporation, pioneers of the Movietone Sound on Film system. The first Fox Grandeur production <b>cameras</b> <b>were</b> delivered to Fox-Case New York in May of 1929. An additional four Grandeur <b>cameras</b> <b>were</b> delivered to MGM in 1930, and one additional <b>camera</b> <b>was</b> delivered to Feature Productions, also in 1930.|$|R
50|$|Intermittent motion <b>cameras</b> <b>are</b> {{capable of}} {{hundreds}} of frames per second. Rotating prism <b>cameras</b> <b>are</b> capable of thousands of frames per second. Rotating mirror <b>cameras</b> <b>are</b> capable of millions of frames per second.|$|R
50|$|Remote <b>cameras</b> <b>are</b> {{most widely}} used in sports photography. 35mm digital or film, and medium format <b>cameras</b> <b>are</b> the most common types of <b>cameras</b> that <b>are</b> used.|$|R
5|$|Dr. Adam Pierce, a {{scientist}} at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, intercepts a visual transmission from Firewalker, a mobile robot sent by a volcanic research project on Mount Avalon near Bend, Oregon. Firewalker is broadcasting from inside a volcanic cave, where Pierce glimpses the dead body of the chief seismologist, Phil Erickson. He also sees a shadow moving in the cave, an impossibility due to the extremely high temperatures. Firewalker's <b>camera</b> <b>is</b> then destroyed, ending the transmission.|$|E
5|$|In {{his second}} {{meeting of the}} day with Scully and Doggett, Wells {{explains}} that he cannot remember the last few days. Scully suggests that maybe he did do it. Wells begins having flashes of the murder but they are unclear. Waiting in his cell, he kills a spider. Later, a nanny cam from his house reveals that {{the only person to}} arrive between the police’s arrival and the last time his wife is on <b>camera</b> <b>is</b> Martin Wells. Eventually, Wells meets his lawyers and tells them about the nanny cam. However, it turns out that it is Wednesday: Wells is somehow “living the week backwards”.|$|E
5|$|Prior {{to a new}} hotel {{opening on}} Amity Island, an {{enormous}} great white shark ambushes and kills two divers who are photographing {{the wreck of the}} Orca. A couple of days later, their <b>camera</b> <b>is</b> recovered, and the shark goes after a female water skier and speedboat driver, killing the skier, while the driver fends off the shark using a gas tank and flare gun, causing the boat to explode, which kills her and severely burns the shark's face.|$|E
5000|$|Gun <b>cameras</b> <b>are</b> <b>cameras</b> used {{primarily}} in aircraft to help measure tactical effectiveness. These <b>cameras</b> <b>are</b> {{triggered by the}} firing of a weapon, hence the name.|$|R
5000|$|The {{earliest}} instant <b>cameras</b> <b>were</b> conceived before Edwin Land's {{invention of}} the instant <b>camera.</b> These <b>cameras</b> <b>were,</b> however, more portable wet darkrooms than [...] "instant" [...] <b>camera</b> and <b>were</b> difficult to use.|$|R
50|$|SAO <b>cameras</b> <b>were</b> at Woomera, Australia; Juptier, Florida; Organ Pass, New Mexico; Olifantsfontein, Union of South Africa; Cadiz, Spain; Mitaka, Japan; Nani Tal, India; Arequipa, Peru; Shiraz, Iran; Curaҫao, Netherlands West Indies; Villa Dolores, Argentina; and Haleakala, Maui, Hawaii. USAF <b>cameras</b> <b>were</b> at Oslo, Norway; Edwards AFB, California, and Santiago, Chile. Two {{additional}} <b>cameras</b> <b>were</b> later {{added to}} the USAF inventory - one of the USAF <b>cameras</b> <b>was</b> transferred to the Royal Canadian Air Force at Cold Lake, Alberta, Canada in 1961.|$|R
5|$|Resident Evil – Code: Veronica {{features}} traditional survival horror gameplay {{found in}} most early Resident Evil games. This includes the series signature controls, interface, puzzles, as well as zombies and monsters to battle. Unlike previous games in the series which used pre-rendered backgrounds, Code: Veronica uses real-time 3D environments. Because of this, the <b>camera</b> <b>is</b> more dynamic than in previous games. The camera will follow, pan, and zoom as the player navigates their character through the environment, similar to Capcom's own Dino Crisis (1999). The story is told through cinematic CGI sequences and in-game cutscenes.|$|E
5|$|The 3.2-megapixels <b>camera</b> <b>is</b> {{accompanied}} by a LED flash, and allows autofocusing and video recording. More features include a microSD slot and a headphone port. Relatively to its connectivity, the BlackBerry Bold 9700 has support for 3G HSDPA networks and integrates Wi-Fi and GPS. The T-Mobile version of the Bold 9700 supports UMA technology—unlicensed mobile access, which allows making voice calls with a Wi-Fi network and not just with a celullar network.|$|E
5|$|The SIII has an 8-megapixel camera {{similar to}} that of the Galaxy SII. It can take 3264×2448-pixel {{resolution}} photos and record videos in 1920×1080-pixel (1080p) resolution. Samsung improved the camera's software over that of its predecessor to include zero shutter lag, and Burst Mode and Best Shot, which work together to quickly take numerous photos before the best-judged frame is selected. The phone can also take pictures while recording videos. The rear-facing <b>camera</b> <b>is</b> complemented by a 1.9-megapixel front-facing camera that can record 720p videos. The phone has LED flash and autofocus.|$|E
50|$|The Olympus PEN F {{series of}} <b>cameras</b> <b>were</b> half-frame SLR <b>cameras</b> {{produced}} between 1963 and 1970. The <b>cameras</b> <b>were</b> unique in using a rotary shutter.|$|R
30|$|Video <b>cameras</b> <b>are</b> {{present in}} many parts of our daily lives. In {{surveillance}} applications they are used to monitor train stations, airports, or public places in cities [1]. Enforcement applications and traffic monitoring [2] are another application area where <b>camera</b> systems <b>are</b> frequently used. In all those applications multiple, spatially distributed <b>cameras</b> <b>are</b> used to cover large areas. But the deployment of <b>cameras</b> <b>is</b> no longer limited to public places. An example where <b>cameras</b> <b>are</b> installed in private environments is assisted living. Elderly people are monitored in their homes to detect unusual behavior such as the collapse of persons [3].|$|R
50|$|Some special {{models of}} color <b>camera</b> <b>are</b> only capable of {{outputting}} raw digital image data. Such <b>cameras</b> <b>are</b> called ColorRAW or Bayer <b>cameras.</b> They <b>are</b> {{often used in}} industry, medicine, astronomy, microscopy and science. In form of photo <b>cameras,</b> they <b>are</b> used by professional photographers. Semi-professional photo cameras often offer an optional RAW mode.|$|R
5|$|The {{episode was}} written by Sam Catlin and {{directed}} by filmmaker David Slade, marking his first time directing for television. It featured guest appearances by Nigel Gibbs and stand-up comedian Bill Burr, the latter of whom specifically sought {{to appear on the}} show. The footage shown from the first-person perspective of Gus' <b>camera</b> <b>is</b> actual footage from the real camera. Marie's return to the kleptomania she demonstrated in the first season was conceived early during brainstorming sessions for the third season.|$|E
5|$|The {{music video}} {{was set in}} a dystopian future {{controlled}} by Cyber-cops (referred to as such by director Brett Leonard.) It depicted an individual who records the Cyber-cops beating a man, only to be noticed and attacked himself. His <b>camera</b> <b>is</b> destroyed and the Cyber-cops leave him unconscious on the ground, as they are busy trying to put down a riot elsewhere in the city. Alone, his camera equipment lands on him and is absorbed into his body, causing him to dramatically morph into a cyborg. The cyborg then joins the riot, leading the rebels to victory.|$|E
5|$|The series {{currently}} {{consists of}} six single-player-only games, and a seventh that includes multiplayer. Each game typically features a third-person, fixed cinematic camera. The player controls the character Kratos in {{a combination of}} hack and slash combat, platforming, and puzzle game elements to achieve goals and complete the story. A first-person <b>camera</b> <b>is</b> featured in God of War III and Ascension. Betrayal is the only installment to feature a 2D side-scrolling view.|$|E
50|$|In motor racing, onboard <b>cameras</b> <b>are</b> {{often used}} to give a better {{perspective}} from the driver's point of view, whilst in films, these <b>cameras</b> <b>are</b> designed to increase the intensity and action of a specific scene. Onboard <b>cameras</b> <b>were</b> used in movies such as Le Mans and The Fast and the Furious series, for this purpose.|$|R
50|$|The narrow-angle <b>camera</b> <b>was</b> placed {{inside an}} 80 cm-long {{cylinder}} with {{a diameter of}} 40 cm, and the two wide-angle <b>cameras</b> <b>were</b> attached above the cylinder's front area. All <b>cameras</b> <b>were</b> based on CCD technology and were supported by state-of-the-art 1980s electronics, including a 32-bit radiation-hardened 10 MHz processor (capable of 1 million instructions per second) and 12 MB of DRAM memory buffer.|$|R
50|$|Subsequently, many single-system 35mm <b>cameras</b> <b>were</b> {{produced}} by Wall Camera Corporation, which much later produced the three-film Cinerama cameras. Wall initially converted some Bell & Howell Design 2709 cameras to single-system, {{but most were}} Wall designed and produced. Single-system <b>cameras</b> <b>were</b> also {{produced by}} Mitchell Camera Corporation during World War II for the U.S. Army Signal Corps, although these <b>cameras</b> <b>were</b> quite rare.|$|R
5|$|Combat {{comes in}} the form of both avoidable random {{encounters}} and scripted fights where the <b>camera</b> <b>is</b> fixed within the fighting area: enemies and bosses are primarily drawn from Japanese folklore and mythology. Battles are triggered only when enemies are near, with the player character otherwise keeping their weapons sheathed. In combat, characters attack and guard using a single-button prompt, while another button accesses items such as healing potions. Continuously attacking triggers combos. Different moves include sword slashes combined with directional buttons, which have different effects such as throwing an enemy into the air with an upward slash. Additional offensive items such as smoke bombs are acquired during the course of the game. At the end of each battle, experience points are awarded to the player character depending on how fast the battle was finished: leveling up increases a character's health, stats, and the amount of damage inflicted upon enemies.|$|E
5|$|Production on {{the game}} started at the {{beginning}} of 2001 with a team of only four programmers. Since Resident Evil was one of Capcom's first titles developed for the GameCube, the development team had to study the system's performance during the first stages of development. Initially, the team considered the possibility of creating the game's environments with computer graphic animation, but then realized that this approach would require too much hardware capacity and processing to achieve realistic graphics. As a result, the graphical style of the remake features 3D models over pre-rendered backgrounds like the Resident Evil games for the PlayStation. Despite this, the <b>camera</b> <b>is</b> more dynamic and can track the player at varying angles. The backgrounds also make use of particle effects and full motion video layers to simulate effects such as rushing water or swaying tree branches. Causing fear to the player was a high priority, and many of the game's backgrounds were designed to have a high contrast between dark and light so that enemies could appear unexpectedly.|$|E
5|$|Sleight of hand during stage magic {{performances}} is not common, as most magic {{events and}} stunts are performed with objects visible {{to a much}} larger audience, but is nevertheless done occasionally by many stage performers. The most common magic tricks performed with sleight of hand on stage are rope manipulations and card tricks, with the first typically being done {{with a member of}} the audience to rule out the possibility of stooges and the latter primarily being done on a table while a <b>camera</b> <b>is</b> live-recording, allowing the rest of audience to see the performance on a big screen. Worldwide acclaimed stage magician David Copperfield often include illusions featuring sleight of hand in his stage shows.|$|E
50|$|Infrared or thermographic <b>cameras</b> <b>are</b> used to {{facilitate}} gestural detection. Unlike digital cameras, infrared cameras operate independent of light, instead {{relying on the}} heat signature of an object. This is beneficial because it allows for gesture detection in all lighting conditions. However, <b>cameras</b> <b>are</b> subject to occlusion by other objects that {{may result in a}} loss of gesture tracking. Infrared <b>cameras</b> <b>are</b> most common in three-dimensional implementations.|$|R
50|$|In Hong Kong, where {{red light}} <b>cameras</b> <b>are</b> installed, signs are erected to warn drivers that <b>cameras</b> <b>are</b> present, {{with the aim}} of educating drivers to stop for signals. The number of red light cameras in Hong Kong doubled in May 2004, and digital red light <b>cameras</b> <b>were</b> {{introduced}} at intersections identified by the police and transport department as having the most violations and greatest risk. The digital <b>cameras</b> <b>were</b> introduced to further deter red-light running. As added assistance to drivers, some of the <b>camera</b> posts <b>were</b> painted orange so that drivers could see them more easily. By 2006, Hong Kong had 96 red light cameras in operation. By 2016 this number had risen to 195.|$|R
40|$|The epipolar {{geometry}} of central panoramic catadioptric <b>cameras</b> <b>is</b> presented. Firstly, {{we show that}} central panoramic catadioptric <b>cameras</b> <b>are</b> obtained {{by a combination of}} (i) a conventional perspective camera with a hyperbolic mirror or (ii) an orthographic camera with a parabolic mirror. Secondly, a complete characterization of the epipolar {{geometry of}} central panoramic catadioptric <b>cameras</b> <b>is</b> given as the hyperbolic and the parabolic catadioptric <b>cameras</b> <b>are</b> the only panoramic catadioptric cameras with a single mirror which have a single viewpoint. It is shown that epipolar curves in image become (i) general conics for the hyperbolic camera (ii) ellipses or lines for the parabolic <b>camera.</b> It <b>is</b> advocated that the difference in the estimation of epipolar geometry for conventional and central panoramic cameras consists in image data normalization. A normalization suitable for panoramic <b>cameras</b> <b>is</b> proposed. The effect of normalization is demonstrated for the hyperbolic camera...|$|R
5|$|The {{dancing is}} {{restrained}} {{with a single}} prop: that of a solitary chair. At {{one point in the}} first segment of the video, she is filmed dancing but the <b>camera</b> <b>is</b> almost still and the motions of the dance are confined within the small range of the camera. As the screens inside the viewing booths open and close, the camera slices the shots of Madonna each with its own angle and duration. The same imagery is exhibited by the little boy outside who tries to frame Madonna's playbill image into different angles. There are four other men in the booths who are made of wood with paintings of artist Tamara de Lempicka on them. Madonna at one point takes off her gloves like Rita Hayworth in Gilda and points towards one of the wooden paintings. It collapses and she blows on her finger.|$|E
5|$|The player {{controls}} the protagonist Leon S. Kennedy from a third-person perspective. The gameplay focuses on action and shootouts involving crowds of enemies in large open areas but still features some Horror elements. The <b>camera</b> <b>is</b> placed behind Leon and zooms {{in for an}} over-the-shoulder view when aiming a weapon, or a first-person view when aiming with a sniper rifle. There is no crosshair for firearms, instead, every firearm has a laser sight. Unlike previous games where players can only shoot straight, up or down, players have more options. For example, shots to the feet can cause enemies to stumble, shots to the arms can make them drop their weapons, and headshots instantly kill most human enemies. Players can shoot down projectiles like thrown axes or scythes.|$|E
5|$|Volcanic ash {{clouds are}} very {{difficult}} to detect from aircraft as no onboard cockpit instruments exist to detect them. However, a new system called Airborne Volcanic Object Infrared Detector (AVOID) has recently been developed by Nicarnica Aviation, a daughter company of the Norwegian Institute for Air Research, which will allow pilots to detect ash plumes up to 100 km (62 mi) ahead and fly safely around them. The system uses two fast-sampling infrared cameras, mounted on a forward-facing surface, that are tuned to detect volcanic ash. This system can detect ash concentrations of <1 mg/m3 to > 50 mg/m3, giving pilots approximately 7–10 minutes warning. The <b>camera</b> <b>is</b> currently being tested by easyJet airline company.|$|E
50|$|CMOS helmet <b>cameras</b> <b>are</b> {{based upon}} the {{complementary}} metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) image sensor. They typically operate on 5 VDC and draw very little power. CMOS <b>cameras</b> <b>are</b> also generally smaller than the CCD type.|$|R
5000|$|The {{battery life}} {{of some of}} these <b>cameras</b> <b>is</b> another {{important}} factor in which <b>cameras</b> <b>are</b> used; large batteries offer a longer running time for the <b>camera</b> but can <b>be</b> cumbersome in set up or when lugging the equipment to the field site [...]|$|R
25|$|Established in 2011, SPD {{operates}} {{a network of}} 140 surveillance cameras called the Criminal Observation and Protection System (COPS). Between 2011 and 2014 more than 40 utility pole mounted <b>cameras</b> <b>were</b> installed, mainly in the Southwest and Northeast neighborhoods. The <b>cameras</b> <b>were</b> funded by federal, state, and private grants. In Summer 2014, 10 <b>cameras</b> <b>were</b> approved for installation in Downtown Syracuse, the first area not targeted because of high levels of violent crime. Live monitoring of Clinton Square for suspicious people during events and festivals was planned, although police agreed to a {{prohibition on the use}} of cameras to monitor protests. Twenty-five additional <b>cameras</b> <b>were</b> planned to be installed in 2016.|$|R
