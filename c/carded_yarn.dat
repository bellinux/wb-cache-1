30|$|It can therefore, be {{concluded}} that plated fabrics with combination of <b>carded</b> <b>yarn</b> in the outer layer and coarse polyester fibre in the inner layer may be suitable for cold and dry conditions owing to high thermal resistance, warm feel next to skin and high water absorbency.|$|E
30|$|Moreover, hairy {{structure}} of <b>carded</b> <b>yarn</b> may disrupt {{the continuity of}} capillaries; combed yarn {{on the other hand}} seems to be forming more continuous capillaries owing to more uniform and less hairy structure. High trans planar wicking of combed yarn fabrics can therefore be explained well in the light of above arguments.|$|E

30|$|Incorporation of coarser {{polyester}} fibres in {{the inner}} layers of plated fabrics resulted in improved thermal resistance for both carded (RC 1.1 –RC 3.3) and combed yarn fabrics (RM 1.1 –RM 3.3) (Fig.  2).

High coefficient of determination (0.90) and (0.96) for <b>carded</b> and combed <b>yarn</b> fabrics respectively suggested positive linear relationship between fibre linear density and thermal resistance. The findings indicate that fibre and yarn combination that would result in high thermal resistance of plated fabrics are polyester fibre of high linear density and <b>carded</b> ring <b>yarns</b> compared to combination of polyester fibre of lower linear density and combed yarns.|$|R
40|$|In this study, five {{parameters}} of a mercerising machine, four {{parameters of}} untreated yarn and three {{parameters of the}} caustic soda bath affecting the tensile strength of mercerised yarn were investigated. Experiments were designed {{with the aid of}} the Response Surface Method. Accordingly different types of yarns were mercerised on different machines and with production settings, then relevant trends were studied. Results show that the strength of the mercerised yarn is highly affected by the cylinder normal pressure, warm rinsing tem-perature and caustic soda bath concentration, while the effect of the cold rinsing tempera-ture is observed only for higher qualities of cotton fibers and yarns. Increasing the cylinder rotation duration results in a reduction in the strength of <b>carded</b> <b>yarns,</b> but has little effect on combed yarns. Results also show that optimum settings are highly affected by the type of cotton fiber, yarn structure and number of plies, but the linear density of single yarn and the mercerising machine type have no significant effect...|$|R

Engineering fabrics with desirable thermo-physiological properties suited for specific applications such as active wear, intimate wear is a big challenge for textile manufacturers as gamut of fibre, yarn and fabric parameters are known to influence the thermo-physiological properties. The present study was undertaken with an aim to explore suitable combination of fibre and yarn variables for engineering polyester–cotton plated fabrics with good thermo-physiological properties. Categorical variables i.e. outer layer yarn type and inner layer fibre linear density were found to affect the thermal, moisture vapour and liquid moisture transfer properties of developed test samples. Fabrics knitted with <b>carded</b> <b>yarn</b> and polyester fibre of high linear density showed high thermal resistance and would feel warmer on initial skin contact owing to low thermal absorptivity. However, the air permeability and moisture vapour transmission rate increased with combination of combed cotton yarn in the outer and coarse polyester fibre in the inner layer.

40|$|Over {{a fourth}} of the cotton {{produced}} in the US since 2002 has been produced in Texas, with most coming from the High Plains. In recent years, Texas has accounted for {{almost half of all}} US cotton production (USDA-NASS, 2008 b). Most cotton on the High Plains is of more storm-proof varieties that have traditionally been harvested using stripper harvesters. However, improvements in irrigation technology and shifting markets for US cotton have increased interest in picker harvesters in the region. A holistic comparison of picker and stripper harvesters in irrigated cotton on the High Plains of Texas was conducted focusing on differences in system efficiencies, the costs of ginning, fiber and yarn quality, and potential economic returns under comparable crop yields and conditions. Harvester performance was evaluated based on harvest efficiency, time-inmotion, and fuel consumption. Stripper harvesters left less cotton in the field, but most of the cotton left by the picker was of low quality. While the time spent in each operation of harvest was highly dependent on the operator and support equipment available, in general, picker harvesters were able to harvest a unit area of high-yielding cotton more quickly than stripper harvesters. The cost of ginning picked and stripped cotton was evaluated considering current fee schedules from gins on the High Plains. On average, it cost a producer $ 4. 76 more per bale to gin stripped-and-field-cleaned cotton than picked cotton. Fiber quality parameters were compared between harvest treatments based on results from High Volume Instrument (HVI) and Advanced Fiber Information System (AFIS) tests. Samples were ring-spun into carded and carded-and-combed yarns. Differences in fiber quality between harvest treatments were more pronounced when growing conditions were less favorable. Few differences were detected in <b>carded</b> <b>yarn</b> quality between harvest treatments, while more pronounced differences favoring picked cotton were seen in carded-and-combed yarns. A cost-benefit analysis was conducted to determine the production scenarios in which picker and stripper harvesters were most appropriate. Results indicate that, if a producer has sufficient yields coupled with sufficient area to harvest per machine, picker harvesting is a more profitable alternative to producers of on the High Plains...|$|E
30|$|Several {{researchers}} {{have attempted to}} study the effect of fibre and yarn parameters on comfort characteristics of woven and knitted fabrics. Varshney et al. (2010) studied the effect of fibre linear density on physiological properties of polyester woven fabrics and observed an increase in thermal resistance, trans planar wicking, air and water vapour permeability with fibre decitex. However they observed that thermal conductivity, thermal absorptivity and spreading speed of water drop decreased with increase in fibre coarseness. Das et al. (2008) reported reduction in air and water vapour permeability through the fabrics but increased wicking properties with the decrease in fibre diameter in their studies on micro-denier and normal denier filament fabrics. Ramakrishnan et al. (2009) compared the comfort properties of micro denier and normal denier viscose yarn knitted fabrics and observed better water absorbency and wicking for micro denier yarn knitted fabrics. Raj and Sreenivasan (2009) reported that the cotton fibre fineness had negative correlation with air permeability of fabrics woven from yarns having the same count and twist and suggested this outcome of reduced air spaces in the fabrics made from finer fibres. Oglakcioglu and Marmarali (2010) studied the effect of yarn type on thermal comfort properties of cotton knitted fabrics and observed that fabrics knitted with double plied yarn had higher thermal conductivity, thermal absorptivity and thermal resistance compared to single plied yarn fabrics. Singh and Nigam (2013) compared carded, combed and compact spun yarn woven fabrics for their comfort performance and reported that compact weft yarn fabrics showed high water vapour permeability while <b>carded</b> <b>yarn</b> fabrics showed higher thermal insulation. Ozdil et al. (2007) studied the thermal comfort properties of carded and combed yarn rib knitted fabrics and observed an increase in thermal conductivity and water vapour permeability of fabrics knitted with combed yarns. Nasrin and Nahida (2011) reported that combed yarns were stronger, less hairy and more uniform than carded yarns. Erdumlu and Saricam (2013) studied the wicking and drying properties of vortex spun yarns and knitted fabrics in comparison with ring-spun yarns and fabrics. They observed that vortex spun yarn had lower yarn and fabric wicking values and water absorbency rate than ring-spun yarns. Tyagi et al. (2009) studied the influence of yarn type on thermal comfort properties of woven fabrics and concluded that Murata Jet Spinning (MJS) yarn fabrics showed higher absorbency, air and water vapour permeability but lower wick ability compared to ring yarn fabrics. The review of published literature suggests that researches are mainly focused on studying the effect of fibre and yarn parameters on comfort properties of woven and knitted fabrics. However, studies on the thermo-physiological properties of plated knits are very limited although the structures are fast becoming preferred choice as intimate wear owing to flexibility in engineering fabrics with different fibre and yarn combinations in the two distinct layers. Moreover, none of the reported studies suggest the desirable fibre and yarn combination in the two layers to engineer fabrics suited for particular environmental conditions. The present study was, therefore undertaken to explore the field further and {{to determine the effect}} of inner layer fibre linear density and the outer layer yarn type on thermo-physiological properties of plated knits.|$|E

40|$|Carding {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} preparatory processes in the short-staple spinning of yarn from a raw material such as cotton. The main purpose of carding is to individualise fibres thoroughly so that they can be spun into yarns. Therefore, the quality of the yarns spun and the quality of fabrics produced from them is largely determined by the effectiveness of the carding process. The design of the licker-in zone determines the degree of pre-opening, and so plays a major role in determining the carding efficiency. This work investigates and evaluates the influence and effectiveness of licker-in design in determining the quality of <b>carded</b> <b>yarns</b> and the fibre configurations in yarn with the two licker-in designs in use today, viz. the single and triple licker-in designs. Two Indian cotton fibre varieties with widely differing characteristics were processed on a commercial high-production card using the single and triple licker-in systems. The quality of yarns spun revealed that licker-in design indeed has a bearing on fibre, yarn and fabric quality. Test results show that whilst the triple licker-in system demonstrated a relative improvement in the yarn quality when processing the medium staple cotton of average fineness, the single licker-in was observed to be more suitable for the longer and finer variety. The analysis of the fibre configuration in yarns indicates that licker-in designs as well as the processing parameters such as licker-in speed and carding rate have an influence on the fibre configuration. Yarns spun using the material processed through the triple licker-in showed more disorder than those of the single licker-in. Finally, an investigation into the fibre opening at the licker-in using high-speed video photography indicates that the degree of opening and the fibre orientation on the licker-in surface before fibre transfer to the main carding cylinder is different between the two licker-in systems. The degree of opening and fibre orientation were also found to depend on the cotton variety, the production rate and licker-in parameters such as speed.
