40|$|The paper {{analyses}} the {{new type}} of judicial review on <b>concurrent</b> <b>legislative</b> <b>power</b> exercised by the Federation, as introduced by the recent constitutional reform, which amended art. 93, para. 2 of German Basis Law. The paper begins by examining the role of Bundesverfassungsgerciht (the German Federal Constitutional Court) as a guardian {{of the principle of}} unity, underlining the steps that were carried out in order to consolidate judicial review on <b>concurrent</b> <b>legislative</b> <b>power</b> exercised by the Federation. Analysis concentrates on the new function assigned to the Bundesverfassungsgericht by the amended art. 93, c. 2 GG. This function can be added to the so-called "necessity-clause" which gives the Bundesverfassungsgericht the power to review federal law when parliamentary or political procedures have proved to be unsuccessful. Finally the paper examines the arbitration function of the Bundesverfassungsgericht {{in the context of the}} German legal system...|$|R
50|$|The {{supremacy}} clause (section 109 of the constitution) gives Commonwealth laws precedent over state laws. The state law-making {{power is}} therefore constrained where the Commonwealth has concurrent law-making power. Furthermore, regarding the subject matters which Commonwealth has <b>concurrent</b> <b>legislative</b> <b>power,</b> Commonwealth parliament can 'cover the field', {{which means the}} Commonwealth can by express words or implication exclude the operations of state laws. The Commonwealth parliament has exclusive <b>legislative</b> <b>power</b> over the subject matters listed in sections 52 and 92 of the constitution, {{which means that the}} states cannot make laws in these areas. Also under section 96 of the Constitution, the Commonwealth can use financial assistance to entice states to refrain from exercising their <b>legislative</b> <b>powers,</b> such as refraining from collecting income tax.|$|R
50|$|In the {{consultations}} of the Parliamentary Council {{over the}} future constitution of the Federal Republic of Germany such financial dependency was to be avoided. The federation and the states should have equal rights and be financially independent of one another. With regard to a common economic region there was agreement on standardized taxes governed by federal law, a system of dividing tax income with the exclusive and <b>concurrent</b> <b>legislative</b> <b>power</b> of the federal parliament, financial administration shared between the federation and the states, and a system of equalization payments between the states. In practice a revenue sharing mechanism was introduced which was laid down in the constitution in 1955.|$|R
40|$|Within {{the general}} picture of public {{administration}} reform [1], great changes have affected the regulations, governance, and management [2] in the cultural heritage sector. In this context, museums have {{played a central role}} by acquiring a more deÞ ned individuality and passing from a condition of being “universitas rerum ” to being an institution. 1. Emilia-Romagna regulations regarding valorization In order to understand the activities of Emilia-Romagna in the Þ eld of cultural heritage, it is necessary to take into consideration the regional statutory provisions for museums [3]. In this respect, the activity of valorizing museums, which is a <b>concurrent</b> <b>legislative</b> <b>power</b> reserved for regions [4] (Italian Constitution, art. 117, section 3), is aimed at spreading and supporting knowledge, and offering and preserving cultural heritage, and must be carried out in accordance with the practice of safeguarding, which is an exclusive <b>legislative</b> <b>power</b> of the state (Art. 117, section 2). This division of powers provided by article 117 leaves room for agreement and coordination, based on state law (Italian Constitution, art. 118, section 3), in the matter of cultural heritage protection...|$|R
50|$|The Provincial Assembly has {{exclusive}} {{powers to}} make law {{with respect to}} any matter not enumerated either in the Federal Legislative List or in the <b>Concurrent</b> <b>Legislative</b> List. Such list is called a Residuary List. Residuary matters are exclusively within Provincial autonomy. From the above, it cannot be extracted that the Province is subordinate to the Federation or Federation is subordinate to Province. In fact, <b>legislative</b> <b>powers</b> are distributed between Federation and Provinces vide Article 142. And one institution cannot take over powers of other institution.
