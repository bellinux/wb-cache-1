40|$|The {{epithelial}} {{surface of}} the mammalian intestine is a dynamic tissue that renews every 3 - 7 days. Understanding this renewal process identified a population of rapidly cycling intestinal stem cells (ISCs) characterized by their expression of the Lgr 5 gene. These are supported by a quiescent stem cell population, marked by Bmi- 1 expression, capable of replacing them {{in the event of}} injury. Investigating the interactions between these populations is crucial to understanding their roles in disease and cancer. The ISCs exist within crypts on the intestinal surface, these niches support the ISC in replenishing the epithelia. The interaction between active and quiescent ISCs likely involves other differentiated cells within the niche, as it has previously been demonstrated that the ‘‘stemness’’ of the Lgr 5 ISC is closely tied to the presence of their neighboring Paneth cells. Using conditional <b>cre-lox</b> <b>mouse</b> models we tested the effect of deleting the majority of active ISCs in {{the presence or absence of}} the Paneth cells. Here we describe the techniques and analysis undertaken to characterize the intestine and demonstrate that the Paneth cells play a crucial role within the ISC niche in aiding recovery following substantial insult...|$|E
40|$|International audienceNeuronal {{maturation}} during {{development is}} a multistep process regulated by transcription factors. The transcription factor ROR alpha (retinoic acid-related orphan receptor alpha) is necessary for early Purkinje cell (PC) maturation but is also expressed throughout adulthood. To identify the role of ROR alpha in mature PCs, we used <b>Cre-lox</b> <b>mouse</b> genetic tools in vivo that delete it specifically from PCs between postnatal days 10 - 21. Up to 14 d of age, differences between mutant and control PCs were not detectable: both were mono-innervated by climbing fibers (CFs) extending along their well-developed dendrites with spiny branchlets. By week 4, mutant mice were ataxic, some PCs had died, and remaining PC soma and dendrites were atrophic, with almost complete disappearance of spiny branchlets. The innervation pattern of surviving ROR alpha -deleted PCs was abnormal with several immature characteristics. Notably, multiple functional CF innervation was reestablished on these mature PCs, simultaneously with the relocation of CF contacts to the PC soma and their stem dendrite. This morphological modification of CF contacts could be induced even later, using lentivirus-mediated depletion of rora from adult PCs. These data show that the late postnatal expression of ROR alpha cell-autonomously regulates the maintenance of PC dendritic complexity, and the CF innervation status of the PC (dendritic vs somatic contacts, and mono-innervation vs multi-innervation). Thus, the differentiation state of adult neurons is {{under the control of}} transcription factors; and in their absence, adult neurons lose their mature characteristics and acquire some characteristics of an earlier developmental stage...|$|E
40|$|Rapid eye {{movement}} sleep (REMS) {{is characterized by}} activation of the cortical and hippocampal electroencephalogram (EEG) and atonia of non-respiratory muscles with superimposed phasic activity or twitching, particularly of cranial muscles {{such as those of}} the eye, tongue, face and jaw. While phasic activity is a characteristic feature of REMS, the neural substrates driving this activity remain unresolved. Here we investigated the neural circuits underlying masseter (jaw) phasic activity during REMS. The trigeminal motor nucleus (Mo 5), which controls masseter motor function, receives glutamatergic inputs mainly from the parvocellular reticular formation (PCRt), but also from the adjacent paramedian reticular area (PMnR). On the other hand, the Mo 5 and PCRt do not receive direct input from the sublaterodorsal (SLD) nucleus, a brainstem region critical for REMS atonia of postural muscles. We hypothesized that the PCRt-PMnR, but not the SLD, regulates masseter phasic activity during REMS. To test our hypothesis, we measured masseter electromyogram (EMG), neck muscle EMG, electrooculogram (EOG) and EEG in rats with cell-body specific lesions of the SLD, PMnR, and PCRt. Bilateral lesions of the PMnR and rostral PCRt (rPCRt), but not the caudal PCRt or SLD, reduced and eliminated REMS phasic activity of the masseter, respectively. Lesions of the PMnR and rPCRt did not, however, alter the neck EMG or EOG. To determine if rPCRt neurons use glutamate to control masseter phasic movements, we selectively blocked glutamate release by rPCRt neurons using a <b>Cre-lox</b> <b>mouse</b> system. Genetic disruption of glutamate neurotransmission by rPCRt neurons blocked masseter phasic activity during REMS. These results indicate that (1) premotor glutamatergic neurons in the medullary rPCRt and PMnR are involved in generating phasic activity in the masseter muscles, but not phasic {{eye movement}}s, during REMS; and (2) separate brainstem neural circuits control postural and cranial muscle phasic activity during REMS...|$|E

40|$|Peroxisome proliferator {{activated}} receptor-γ (PPARγ) {{has been}} reported to exert anti-inflammatory properties in endotoxic shock and sepsis. One phenomenon that alters the inflammatory response to endotoxin [lipopolysaccharide (LPS) ] is endotoxin tolerance, which is caused by previous exposure to endotoxin. Here, we investigate whether changes in endogenous PPARγ function regulate this phenomenon using three different models of LPS-induced tolerance in macrophages. In a first in vitro model, previous LPS exposure of murine J 774. 2 macrophages suppressed tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) release in response to subsequent LPS challenge. Treatment of J 774. 2 cells with the PPARγ inhibitor GW 9662 did not alter tolerance induction because these cells were still hyporesponsive to the secondary LPS challenge. In a second ex vivo model, primary rat peritoneal macrophages from LPS-primed rats exhibited suppression of thromboxane B 2 and TNF-α production, while maintaining nitrite production in response to in vitro LPS challenge. Pretreatment of rats with the PPARγ inhibitor GW 9662 in vivo failed to alter the tolerant phenotype of these primary macrophages. In a third ex vivo model, primary peritoneal macrophages with conditional deletion of PPARγ were harvested from LPS-primed <b>Cre-lox</b> <b>mice</b> (Cre+/+ PPARγ−/−) and exhibited significant suppression of TNF-α production in response to in vitro LPS challenge. Furthermore, both LPS-primed PPARγ-deficient Cre+/+ PPARγ−/− mice and wild-type Cre−/− PPARγ+/+ mice exhibited reduced plasma TNF-α levels in response to a high dose of LPS in vivo. These data demonstrate that PPARγ does not {{play a role in the}} LPS-induced tolerant phenotype in macrophages...|$|R

40|$|During chronic {{and severe}} acute liver injury, {{regeneration}} {{is thought to}} occur through hepatic progenitor cells (HPCs). Understanding the regulation of HPCs may offer therapeutic opportunities to enhance liver regeneration. HPCs are associated {{with an increase in}} laminins in the extracellular matrix. Laminins are heterotrimeric proteins, composed of an alpha, beta and gamma chain. There are 5 alpha chains with different distributions and functions, but the relative contributions of these in HPC-mediated liver regeneration are not known. My aims were to describe the laminin alpha chains associated with the HPC response and to define the functional effects of specific laminin chains on HPCs. I examined the laminin alpha chains in two mouse models of HPC activation: a transgenic model using conditional deletion of Mdm 2 in hepatocytes, and a dietary model using 3, 5 -diethoxycarbonyl- 1, 4 -dihydrocollidine (DDC). The laminin alpha 5 (Lama 5) chain is significantly upregulated in both models and forms a basement membrane which surrounds the progenitor cells. I have also demonstrated Lama 5 expression in the ductular reaction seen in human liver disease. Using primary mouse cell cultures, I have shown that Lama 5 is produced predominantly by the HPCs themselves, rather than by stellate cells. The HPCs express the cell surface receptor alpha- 6 beta- 1 integrin, a binding partner of Lama 5. I then studied the functional effects of matrix on cell behaviour in vitro using recombinant laminins and a line of spontaneously immortalised mouse HPCs. Compared to other laminin chains, Lama 5 selectively promotes HPC adhesion and spreading. These effects are partially blocked by antibodies against beta- 1 integrin. Lama 5 also significantly enhances HPC migration, resulting in an increase in cell migration. Furthermore, only Lama 5 enhances HPC survival in serum-free medium, with an increase in cell viability. Culturing HPCs on HPCs maintained in culture on plastic synthesise Lama 5 chain. Knock-down of endogenous Lama 5 production using siRNA results in reduced proliferation and increased hepatocytic differentiation, with increased albumin production. I then studied the effects in vivo using transgenic <b>Cre-lox</b> <b>mouse</b> strains that allow conditional knock-out of either laminin alpha 5 or beta- 1 integrin in HPCs. The effects of gene deletion were examined in healthy mice and two dietary models of HPC activation: the DDC diet and a choline-deficient, ethionine-supplemented (CDE) diet. Although these experiments were limited by a low number of experimental animals and low recombination rates, there was a suggestion of impaired HPC expansion associated with loss of laminin alpha 5. There was also a significant increase in hepatocellular injury and fibrosis in response to the DDC diet seen with loss of laminin alpha 5 expression. Laminin alpha 5 -containing matrix is deposited around HPCs during liver regeneration and supports progenitor cell attachment, migration and maintenance of an undifferentiated phenotype. This work identifies a novel target for enhancing liver regeneration...|$|E

We investigated the functional consequences of partial and full Sgta ablation in vivo using <b>Cre-lox</b> Sgta-null <b>mice.</b> Sgta(+/-) breeders generated viable Sgta(-/-) offspring, but {{at less than}} Mendelian expectancy. Sgta(-/-) breeders were subfertile with small litters and higher neonatal death (P[*]<[*] 0. 02). Body size was significantly and proportionately smaller in male and female Sgta(-/-) (vs WT, Sgta(+/-) P[*]<[*] 0. 001) from d 19. Serum IGF- 1 levels were genotype- and sex-dependent. Food intake, muscle and bone mass and adiposity were unchanged in Sgta(-/-). Vital and sex organs had normal relative weight, morphology and histology, although certain androgen-sensitive measures such as penis and preputial size, and testis descent, were greater in Sgta(-/-). Expression of AR and its targets remained largely unchanged, although AR localisation was genotype- and tissue-dependent. Generally expression of other TPR-containing proteins was unchanged. In conclusion, this thorough investigation of SGTA-null mutation reports a mild phenotype of reduced body size. The model's full potential likely will be realised by genetic crosses with other models to interrogate the role of SGTA in the many diseases {{in which it has}} been implicated. Lisa K.

40|$|SummaryMutations in the amyloid {{precursor}} protein (APP) cause early-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD), but the only genetic risk factor for late-onset AD is the ɛ 4 allele of apolipoprotein E (apoE), a major cholesterol carrier. Using <b>Cre-lox</b> conditional knockout <b>mice,</b> we demonstrate that lipoprotein receptor LRP 1 expression regulates apoE and cholesterol levels within the CNS. We also found that deletion of APP and its homolog APLP 2, or components of the γ-secretase complex, significantly enhanced the expression and function of LRP 1, which was reversed by forced expression of the APP intracellular domain (AICD). We further show that AICD, together with Fe 65 and Tip 60, interacts with the LRP 1 promoter and suppresses its transcription. Together, our findings support that the γ-secretase cleavage of APP plays {{a central role in}} regulating apoE and cholesterol metabolism in the CNS via LRP 1 and establish a biological linkage between APP and apoE, the two major genetic determinants of AD...|$|R
40|$|Oct 4 {{is a key}} {{component}} of the pluripotency regulatory network, and its reciprocal interaction with Cdx 2 {{has been shown to be}} a determinant of either the self-renewal of embryonic stem cells (ESCs) or their differentiation into trophoblast. Oct 4 of maternal origin is postulated to play critical role in defining totipotency and inducing pluripotency during embryonic development. However, the genetic elimination of maternal Oct 4 using a <b>Cre-lox</b> approach in <b>mouse</b> revealed that the establishment of totipotency in maternal Oct 4 –depleted embryos was not affected, and that these embryos could complete full-term development without any obvious defect. These results indicate that Oct 4 is not essential for the initiation of pluripotency, in contrast to its critical role in maintaining pluripotency. This conclusion is further supported by the formation of Oct 4 -GFP– and Nanog- expressing inner cell masses (ICMs) in embryos with complete inactivation of both maternal and zygotic Oct 4 expression and the reprogramming of fibroblasts into fully pluripotent cells by Oct 4 -deficient oocytes...|$|R
40|$|Vascular endothelial {{growth factor}} (VEGF) plays a {{critical}} role in normal development as well as retinal vasculature disease. During retinal vascularization, VEGF is most strongly expressed by not yet vascularized retinal astrocytes, but also by retinal astrocytes within the developing vascular plexus, suggesting a role for retinal astrocyte-derived VEGF in angiogenesis and vessel network maturation. To test the role of astrocyte-derived VEGF, we used <b>Cre-lox</b> technology in <b>mice</b> to delete VEGF in retinal astrocytes during development. Surprisingly, this only had a minor impact on retinal vasculature development, with only small decreases in plexus spreading, endothelial cell proliferation and survival observed. In contrast, astrocyte VEGF deletion had more pronounced effects on hyperoxia-induced vaso-obliteration and led to the regression of smooth muscle cell-coated radial arteries and veins, which are usually resistant to the vessel-collapsing effects of hyperoxia. These results suggest that VEGF production from retinal astrocytes is relatively dispensable during development, but performs vessel stabilizing functions in the retinal vasculature and might be relevant for retinopathy of prematurity in humans...|$|R
40|$|Although TSH stimulates {{all aspects}} of thyroid {{physiology}} IGF-I signaling through a tyrosine kinase-containing transmembrane receptor exhibits a permissive impact on TSH action. To better {{understand the importance of}} the IGF-I receptor in the thyroid in vivo, we inactivated the Igf 1 r with a Tg promoter-driven <b>Cre-lox</b> system in <b>mice.</b> We studied male and female mice with thyroidal wild-type, Igf 1 r(+/-), and Igf 1 r(-/-) genotypes. Targeted Igf 1 r inactivation did transiently reduce thyroid hormone levels and significantly increased TSH levels in both heterozygous and homozygous mice without affecting thyroid weight. Histological analysis of thyroid tissue with Igf 1 r inactivation revealed hyperplasia and heterogeneous follicle structure. From 4 months of age, we detected papillary thyroid architecture in heterozygous and homozygous mice. We also noted increased body weight of male mice with a homozygous thyroidal null mutation in the Igf 1 r locus, compared with wild-type mice, respectively. A decrease of mRNA and protein for thyroid peroxidase and increased mRNA and protein for IGF-II receptor but no significant mRNA changes for the insulin receptor, the TSH receptor, and the sodium-iodide-symporter in both Igf 1 r(+/-) and Igf 1 r(-/-) mice were detected. Our results suggest that the strong increase of TSH benefits papillary thyroid hyperplasia and completely compensates the loss of IGF-I receptor signaling at the level of thyroid hormones without significant increase in thyroid weight. This could indicate that the IGF-I receptor signaling is less essential for thyroid hormone synthesis but maintains homeostasis and normal thyroid morphogenesis...|$|R

GABA-mediated tonic inhibition largely controls neuronal excitability and action potential firing rates, and we previously suggested with pharmacological analysis that the GABAA receptor β 3 subunit plays {{a large role in}} the basal tonic current seen in D 2 + MSNs from young mice (Ade et al, 2008; Janssen et al, 2009). In this study, we demonstrated the essential role of the β 3 GABAA receptor subunit in mediating MSN tonic currents using conditional β 3 subunit knock-out (β 3 f/fDrd 2) <b>mice.</b> <b>Cre-lox</b> genetics were used to generate conditional knock-out animals where Cre recombinase was expressed under the D 2 receptor (Drd 2) promoter. We show that while the wild-type MSN tonic current pattern demonstrates a high degree of variability, tonic current patterns from β 3 f/fDrd 2 mice are narrow, suggesting that the β 3 subunit is essential to striatal MSN GABA-mediated tonic current. Our data also suggest that a distinct population of synaptic receptors upregulate due to β 3 subunit removal. Further, deletion of this subunit significantly decreases the D 2 + MSN excitability. These results offer insight for target mechanisms in Parkinson’s disease, where symptoms arise due to the imbalance in striatal D 1 + and D 2 + MSN excitability and output...|$|R
40|$|Calcium and {{phosphorous}} {{are critical}} {{elements in a}} number of physiological processes, including maintenance of bone structure, cell signaling and energy metabolism. Their endocrine regulation is tightly controlled through a number of feedback mechanisms involving parathyroid hormone (PTH), vitamin D and the recently discovered fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF 23). The kidney is a key organ in maintaining normal serum levels of calcium and inorganic phosphorous, and disturbances in mineral metabolism are commonly observed in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Klotho is a membrane-bound protein expressed in the renal tubules that acts as a co-receptor for FGF 23. In addition, Klotho can be shedded from the cell surface to extra-cellular compartments and function as a hormone with effects on mineral metabolism independent of FGF 23. During the progression of CKD the expression of Klotho rapidly declines, and accumulating evidence point to lack of Klotho as a pathogenic factor driving clinical complications in CKD. The main focus of this thesis has been to elucidate the role of renal Klotho in mineral metabolism and on systemic effects. In Study I we generated distal tubule-specific Klotho knockout mice (Ksp-KL-/-) by employing <b>cre-lox</b> recombination. Ksp-KL-/- <b>mice</b> were hyperphosphatemic with elevated serum Fgf 23 levels, indicating that distal tubular Klotho affects phosphate reabsorption in the proximal tubules. The exact mechanism of this proposed distal-toproximal tubular signaling remains unknown. In Study II we generated mice with Klotho deleted throughout the nephron (Six 2 -KL-/-). Six 2 -KL-/- mice were infertile, kyphotic, growth retarded and had a decreased life span, closely resembling the phenotype seen in systemic Klotho knockout mice. Also the serum and urine biochemistries, low serum Klotho levels as well as profound histological abnormalities were indistinguishable from systemic Klotho knockout mice, unraveling the kidney as the principle contributor to circulating Klotho and mediator of Klotho anti-ageing traits. Taken together, the studies presented in this licentiate thesis substantially contribute to the understanding of renal Klotho function...|$|R
40|$|Serum {{response}} factor (SRF) is a transcription factor of the MADS box family that regulates essential structural and metabolic genes in many tissues. Using a <b>mouse</b> <b>Cre-Lox</b> model, {{we have shown}} previously that SRF inactivation can result in severe cardiac and intestinal failure as well as angiogenic defects. We have performed transcriptomic analyses of gene expression alteration in the cardiac and vascular system following SRF inactivation (see other abstracts) and we found {{a large number of}} down-regulated genes but an even larger number that are up-regulated after SRF inactivation. This latter result was partly unexpected since SRF is mainly known as a positive regulator of transcription. While various hypotheses can account for this up-regulation, we chose to focus on the potential role of SRF in the control of miRNAs, which are endogenous small RNAs that can inhibit the expression of other mRNAs. Indeed, recent bioinformatic analyses revealed that more than 40 microRNAs contain SRF target sequences in their promoter region, suggesting a possible broad regulatory role of SRF for these microRNAs. It has already been shown by others that SRF regulates miR- 1 and miR- 133 expression during heart development, those miRs being essential for correct cardiogenesis and the control of cardiac hypertrophy. The aims of this project are: 1) To analyse the role of SRF in the regulation of microRNAs in the adult heart and vessels of mice by a transcriptomic approach and ChIP on Chip approach; 2) To study the biological role of microRNAs regulated by SRF and their implications in development of cardiovascular disease. To analyse the role of SRF in microRNA regulation, we have started to extract total RNA from hearts of SRF conditional knockout mice at different stages and in basal and hypertrophic settings. Preliminary analysis of global microRNA expression profile of these samples using Illumina V 2 microRNA beadarrays and characterization of the expression of putative SRF MiR targets by quantitative RT PCR will be presented...|$|R
40|$|Inflammatory and {{metabolic}} {{processes are}} critical {{to the survival of}} multicellular organisms. Inflammation and metabolism are closely linked, and many pathologies are associated with dysregulation of both of these processes, including obesity, cancer, diabetes, and atherosclerosis. Understanding the mechanistic links of inflammation and metabolism are critical for the development of treatments of metabolic and inflammatory diseases. AMP-activated protein kinase, AMPK, is a serine/threonine kinase that regulates energy homeostasis and metabolic stress in eukaryotes. When cellular ATP is low, AMPK is activated and turns off ATP-consuming anabolic pathways and turns on ATP-generating catabolic pathways. Previous work from our laboratory, as well as by others, has provided evidence that AMPKa 1 acts as a negative regulator of TLR-induced inflammatory function. The goal of this dissertation was to investigate the role of AMPKa 1 in myeloid antigen presenting cell activity. Herein we demonstrate that AMPKa 1 -deficient macrophages and dendritic cells (DCs) exhibit heightened inflammatory function and an enhanced capacity for antigen presentation favoring the promotion of Th 1 and Th 17 responses. Macrophages and DCs generated from AMPKa 1 -deficient mice produced higher levels of proinflammatory cytokines and decreased production of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL- 10 in response to both TLR and CD 40 stimulation as compared to AMPKa 1 +/+ cells. In assays of antigen presentation, AMPKa 1 deficiency in both the myeloid APC and T cell populations contributed to enhanced IL- 17 and IFN? production. Focusing on the CD 154 -CD 40 interaction, we found that CD 40 stimulation resulted in increased phosphorylation of ERK 1 / 2, p 38, and NF-?B p 65 and decreased activation of the antiinflammatory Akt - GSK 3 ß - CREB pathway in DCs deficient for AMPKa 1. AMPKa 1 serves to attenuate LPS and CD 40 -mediated proinflammatory activity of myeloid APC and AMPKa 1 activity in both APC and T cells antagonizes the development of proinflammatory T cell responses during antigen presentation. Additionally, we sought to investigate the influence of macrophage-expressed AMPKa 1 on tumor-macrophage interactions and macrophage polarization in the tumor microenvironment. Our studies show that macrophage-expressed AMPKa 1 polarizes tumor-infiltrating macrophages (TIMs) to an anti-inflammatory phenotype and contributes to tumor growth. To evaluate the role of myeloid cell-expressed AMPKa 1 in tumor growth and metastasis, we used an AMPKa 1 <b>Cre-lox</b> transgenic <b>mouse</b> model. AMPKa 1 flox/flox LysM-Cre+ (described subsequently as MacAMPKa 1 KO) mice had reduced Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) tumor growth and metastasis compared to AMPKa 1 flox/- LysM-Cre- (WT) mice. Additionally, TIMs isolated from MacAMPKa 1 KO mice exhibited higher production of proinflammatory cytokines and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). Furthermore, TIMs isolated from MacAMPKa 1 KO mice had higher phosphorylation of p 65 NF-?B and reduced phosphorylation of Akt and CREB. Overall, deficiency of myeloid AMPKa 1 results in higher proinflammatory activity of TIMs and decreased tumor growth. Our studies herein demonstrate that AMPKa 1 counter-regulates myeloid cell TLR- and CD 154 -induced inflammatory activity and antagonizes the development of proinflammatory effector T cell responses. Furthermore, myeloid-expressed AMPKa 1 contributes to the polarization of TIMs to an anti-inflammatory phenotype and leads to increased tumor growth and metastasis. These studies demonstrate that AMPKa 1 is an important link to inflammation and metabolism and is a valuable potential target for the treatment of inflammatory and metabolic diseases. Additionally, these studies provide evidence that activation of AMPKa 1 in cancer therapy may contribute to increased tumor growth through polarization of TIMs to an anti-inflammatory phenotype, a valuable observation given that many AMPK activators are being studied as cancer therapeutics...|$|R
40|$|Chronic {{kidney disease}} (CKD) {{is a global}} health burden of growing {{incidence}} and prevalence. As renal function declines disturbances in mineral metabolism, such as hyperphosphatemia and secondary hyperparathyroidism, inevitably develop. These metabolic changes are closely associated with poor prognosis and survival. The bonederived hormone fibroblast growth factor- 23 (FGF 23) and its co-receptor Klotho represent a novel endocrine axis regulating mineral metabolism in health and disease. FGF 23 -Klotho signalling inhibits renal phosphate reabsorption and activation of vitamin D, and reduces secretion of parathyroid hormone (PTH). Serum levels of FGF 23 rise at early stages of CKD, presumably due to increased phosphate load, and numerous studies identify elevated FGF 23 {{as a predictor of}} adverse clinical outcome. In contrast, tissue expression of Klotho decreases in parallel with CKD progression and reaches low or undetectable levels in end-stage renal disease. Importantly, mice lacking Klotho develop numerous complications associated with accelerated ageing, and many patients with advanced CKD, a state of Klotho deficiency, display a similar senescentlike phenotype. Altogether, FGF 23 excess and lack of Klotho may be key pathogenic factors in CKD. In the present thesis we sought to elucidate the role of renal and parathyroid FGF 23 -Klotho signalling in physiology and in CKD. In Study I we investigate Klotho levels in surgically resected parathyroid tissue specimen from CKD patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism, and find diminished Klotho expression paralleling the decline in renal function. Further, we demonstrate that FGF 23 dose-dependently suppresses Klotho in bovine parathyroid cell culture, indicating a ligand-receptor regulatory process. In Study II we generate parathyroid-specific Klotho knockout <b>mice</b> (PTH-KL-/-) using <b>Cre-Lox</b> recombination. PTH-KL-/- <b>mice</b> display a normal gross phenotype with a preserved calcium-PTH axis. Their PTH response is similar to wild-type mice when treated with FGF 23 or challenged with renal failure. Yet, FGF 23 treatment activates the MAPK pathway in wild-type mice but not in PTH-KL-/- mice. Importantly, blocking of calcineurin with cyclosporine A abolishes the FGF 23 -mediated PTH suppression in PTH-KL-/- mice, whereas wild-type mice remain responsive. Thus, we identify a novel calcineurin-dependent pathway in the parathyroid glands that, in the absence of Klotho, mediates acute suppression of PTH secretion by FGF 23. In Study III we develop a novel, non-surgical, mouse model of tubulointerstitial nephropathy. By adding various concentrations of adenine to the diet we define an adjustable protocol for inducing and maintaining uremia in mice. In Study IV we generate distal tubule-specific Klotho knockout mice (Ksp-KL-/-). In contrast to systemic Klotho knockout mice, Ksp-KL-/- mice are fertile with a normal gross phenotype. Adult Ksp-KL-/- mice are hyperphosphatemic, indicating attenuated effects of FGF 23 on proximal tubular phosphate handling. Further, FGF 23 is higher in Ksp-KL-/- mice than in wild-type mice with matched serum phosphate, suggesting phosphate-independent regulation of FGF 23 in Ksp-KL-/- mice. Collectively, the studies presented in this thesis identify several novel and critical aspects of FGF 23 -Klotho signalling and function in health and disease, and provide important tools allowing for continuous investigation...|$|R
