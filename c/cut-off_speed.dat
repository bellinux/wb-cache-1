40|$|Abstract — Shaft {{misalignment}} in {{rotating machinery}} {{is one of}} the major industrial concerns. When the power supply to any rotating system is cut-off, the system begins to lose the momentum gained during sustained operation and finally comes to rest. The exact time period between the power cut-off time and the time at which the rotor stops is called Coast Down Time. In this paper an experimental study was conducted to investigate the effect of angular misalignment in forward curved centrifugal blower test setup. Tests were conducted for various level of angular misalignment at different shaft <b>cut-off</b> <b>speeds.</b> The results show that the coast down time decreases with increase in level of angular misalignment. At higher speed and at higher level of angular misalignment, the impact on percentage reduction in CDT is very high and there is a specific correlation between the percentage reduction, <b>cut-off</b> <b>speeds</b> and the level of introduced angular misalignment. The vibration signatures acquired at different <b>cut-off</b> <b>speeds</b> and at the various level of angular misalignment conditions. The 2 X and 3 X vibration amplitude components are predominant frequencies and increase as the angular misalignment and shaft rotational speed increases, thereby establishing the fact that the CDT analysis can be used as one of the diagnostic condition monitoring parameter for rotating machinery...|$|R

Because of this variation nature of wind speed, every wind turbine demonstrates a unique performance and delivers a unique power.

For the purpose of full operation analysis in this study, 8 commercially available wind turbines of similar sizes (in terms of their rated power in MW) have been chosen. For comparison analysis wind speed characteristics, and power curve of these wind turbines were used. To reach its objectives, this paper is divided to two parts. In the first part the Weibull distribution function was applied to analyse the wind speed characteristics and used to calculate the wind power operation capacity.

This study investigates {{the use of}} the Bees Algorithm for the selection of the optimal operating speed parameters for wind power units. Three speed parameters need to be optimized, namely, the rated, cut-in, and <b>cut-off</b> (furling) <b>speed</b> of the turbine. The aim of the optimization process is to maximize the yearly power yield and turbine usage time. The choice of the best parameters depends from the wind frequency distribution at the site of installation. Eleven locations on the coastal areas of Egypt were chosen as case studies. The well-known Particle Swarm Optimization was used as a control optimization algorithm. A popular classical approach based on the manual optimization of the sole rated speed was used as baseline for the comparison of results. The optimization of all the three speed parameters and the use of intelligent optimization techniques represent the novelties of this paper. The study showed that the Bees Algorithm outperformed the other two optimization methods. The proposed algorithm was able to find speed parameters that greatly enhanced the power yield, without compromising the usage time or significantly increasing the capital costs. The comparison between the standard manual optimization method and the two intelligent optimization techniques proved the superiority of the latter ones...|$|R

The excess charge carriers responsible for the photo-induced stress were produced via photon irradiation from both a diode laser and a black body source. In the case of Si, the photo-induced stress is of opposite direction and about four times larger than the thermal stress.

This study aimed {{to determine the effect}} of wind direction and speed on particle dispersion in the above size ranges. Particle number distributions (PNDs) and concentrations (PNCs) were measured in the 5 - 2738 �nm range continuously (and in real-time) for 17 �days between 7 th and 23 rd March 2007 in a regular (aspect ratio�~�unity) street canyon in Cambridge (UK), using a newly developed fast-response differential mobility spectrometer (sampling frequency 0. 5 �Hz), at 1. 60 �m above the road level. The PNCs in each size range, during all wind directions, were better described by a proposed two regime model (traffic-dependent and wind-dependent mixing) than by simply assuming that the PNC was inversely proportional to the wind speed or by fitting the data with a best-fit single power law.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{simulate}} and implement open loop and closed loop controlled DC-DC converter for stand-alone wind energy system. Wind turbines, however, are not always very efficient in the wind speeds that are most common to a region. Typically, wind energy systems are designed to be highly efficient in high wind speed and have a cut-off wind speed- below which no energy is captured. In remote locations where wind energy is used for battery charging, the energy lost below the <b>cut-off</b> wind <b>speed</b> could be used for trickle charging or maintaining a batteryâs fully charged state. Wind turbines are most efficient when they are operated at one specific Tip-Speed to Wind-Speed Ratio (TSR). Therefore, for the efficient capture of wind power, turbine speed should be controlled to follow the ideal TSR, with an optimal operating point, which is different for every wind speed In this system, the DC-DC converter in the DC link with a constant dc voltage to the load, a DC-DC converter will allow the voltage at the output of a diode bridge rectifier to be controlled. In low wind speed conditions, the voltage may be lowered to prevent the dc link from reverse biasing the diode rectifier. Under high wind speed condition, the voltage may be increased, reducing I 2 R losses. In addition, adjusting the voltage on the dc rectifier will change the generator terminal voltage and thereby provide control over the current flowing out of the generator. The LCL-T resonant inverter system for both open loop and closed loop DC-to-DC converter systems are simulated using MATLAB simulink power system blocks. This converter has advantages like reduced transformer size, reduced filter size and current source characteristics. The simulation studies indicate that LCL-T type for open and closed loop DC-DC converter can be used with stand-alone wind generator. Constant voltage can be maintained at the output of DC-to-DC converter by using a PWM rectifier at the output. Embedded controlled DC to DC converter is fabricated and it is tested...|$|R

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Gastric emptying and antral speed were measured in 12 type 1 diabetic patients (mean age 43 years) and 9 healthy volunteers (mean age 31 years). Subjects, fasting from 6 h, were evaluated in supine position using a 1. 5 T MR scanner and a eight-channels phased-array body coil after ingestion of 400 ml of a vanillas pudding mixed with 5 ml of Gd-DTPA. Axial 3 D T 1 w sequence at 0 and 30 min for volume evaluation and cine-steady state acquisition every 5 min for a total time of 30 min for gastric wave speed assessing were acquired. Two blinded observers extrapolated T(1 / 2) from gastric volume assessment and speed of gastric waves. RESULTS: All the patients tolerated the examination. The T(1 / 2) cut-off was of 115 min with an accuracy in differentiate controls from diabetics of 96 % (95 % CI 0. 766 - 0. 992; p< 0. 001), while the antral <b>speed</b> <b>cut-off</b> was of 0. 15 mm/s with an accuracy of 87 % (95 % CI 0. 628 - 0. 977; p< 0. 001).

5000|$|The {{engine was}} {{designed}} and built by the roads master mechanic, Andrew Jackson [...] "A.J" [...] Stevens at Sacramento Locomotive Works in 1882. The locomotive had two highly unusual features: the firebox shape and the steam distribution. [...] The rear end of the firebox was depressed so that the outer shell was below the water level, leaving no clear steam space. The roof was sloped down towards the back so that steam bubbles would flow forward till they reached the upper vertical part of the backplate which was in two pieces. The fire-hole door was in the lower backplate. The firebox was very long, [...] to the tubeplate, the grate being [...] long. It {{is not clear what}} object Stevens had in mind when having this abnormal construction, which must have been costly to build and maintain: it did give more room in the cab.The special valve gear operated four slide valves for each cylinder, two of which were worked by Stephenson valve gear, but used for reversing only, and two more, on top of the first two, for controlling the cutoff, these being operated by a third eccentric through a rocking lever with a sliding block on one arm. The use of a double valve gear is reminiscent of Centipede, but separate valves for each end of the cylinder were novel on a locomotive. This valve gear gave very good steam distribution even at short cut-offs; short as understood for a saturated-steam engine with a boiler pressure low by modern standards.

All other steam locomotives with slide valves had just a single valve in the center.|$|R
40|$|Most of {{the energy}} in the fuel burned in modern {{automotive}} internal combustion engines is lost as waste heat without contributing to the vehicle’s propulsion. In principle some of this lost energy could be captured and used to increase the vehicle’s fuel efficiency by fitting a {{waste heat recovery system}} to the engine. This thesis presents investigations into the design and functioning of waste heat recovery systems based on Rankine cycle technology for vehicular applications. To facilitate the design of such systems, the performance of different working fluids and expansion devices was investigated using a zero-dimensional model of the Rankine cycle. Simulations using this model indicated that water-based fluids should perform well when recovering waste heat from a high temperature source such as a combustion engine’s exhaust gas. In addition, evaluations based on similarity parameters indicated that displacement expanders are optimal in systems having low flow rates and high expansion pressure ratios, both of which are to be expected in vehicular systems using water as the working fluid. Organic working fluids allow higher flow rates in the cycle, making the efficient use of turbines possible. Data from the simulations using the zero-dimensional model were used to guide the design and construction of a demonstrator test bench featuring a Rankine cycle-based recovery system that recovers waste heat from the exhaust gas recirculation system of a heavy duty Diesel engine. The test bench uses water as the working fluid and a piston expander as the expansion device. The Rankine cycle’s thermal efficiency was 10 %, corresponding to 1 - 2 % of the engine’s power output. To find ways of improving the system’s performance, one-dimensional models of the expander and the system as a whole were created and then validated by comparing their output to experimental data obtained with the test bench. The expander model suggested that reducing the compression ratio would make it possible to reduce the steam inlet pressure by 30 % without affecting the expander’s power output. This hypothesis was then confirmed experimentally. The expander model was used to rank the relative influence of selected steam boundary conditions and expander geometry parameters on the performance of a piston expander. The inlet pressure, steam inlet <b>cut-off</b> timing, expander <b>speed</b> and outlet pressure were found to be the most significant main effects on expander performance. It was also shown that interaction effects between steam conditions and expander geometry had considerable influence on both power output and efficiency...|$|R
