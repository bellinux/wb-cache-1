5|$|In some enzymes, no {{amino acids}} are {{directly}} involved in catalysis; instead, the enzyme contains sites to bind and orient catalytic cofactors. Enzyme structures may also contain allosteric sites where the binding of a small molecule causes a <b>conformational</b> change that increases or decreases activity.|$|E
5|$|Induced fit {{may enhance}} the {{fidelity}} of molecular {{recognition in the}} presence of competition and noise via the <b>conformational</b> proofreading mechanism.|$|E
5|$|Inhibitory serpins do not inhibit {{their target}} proteases by the typical {{competitive}} (lock-and-key) mechanism used by most small protease inhibitors (e.g. Kunitz-type inhibitors). Instead, serpins use an unusual <b>conformational</b> change, which disrupts {{the structure of}} the protease and prevents it from completing catalysis. The <b>conformational</b> change involves the RCL moving to {{the opposite end of the}} protein and inserting into β-sheet A, forming an extra antiparallel β-strand. This converts the serpin from a stressed state, to a lower-energy relaxed state (S to R transition).|$|E
5|$|Mutations {{that affect}} the rate or the extent of RCL {{insertion}} into the A-sheet can cause the serpin to undergo its S to R <b>conformational</b> change before having engaged a protease. Since a serpin can only make this <b>conformational</b> change once, the resulting misfired serpin is inactive and unable to properly control its target protease. Similarly, mutations that promote inappropriate transition to the monomeric latent state cause disease by {{reducing the amount of}} active inhibitory serpin. For example, the disease-linked antithrombin variants wibble and wobble, both promote formation of the latent state.|$|E
5|$|Protease-inhibition {{is thought}} to be the ancestral function, with non-inhibitory members the results of {{evolutionary}} neofunctionalisation of the structure. The S to R <b>conformational</b> change has also been adapted by some binding serpins to regulate affinity for their targets.|$|E
5|$|The <b>conformational</b> {{mobility}} of serpins provides a key advantage over static lock-and-key protease inhibitors. In particular, {{the function of}} inhibitory serpins can be regulated by allosteric interactions with specific cofactors. The X-ray crystal structures of antithrombin, heparin cofactor II, MENT and murine antichymotrypsin reveal that these serpins adopt a conformation wherein the first two amino acids of the RCL are inserted {{into the top of}} the A β-sheet. The partially inserted conformation is important because co-factors are able to conformationally switch certain partially inserted serpins into a fully expelled form. This <b>conformational</b> rearrangement makes the serpin a more effective inhibitor.|$|E
5|$|The favoured {{model for}} the enzyme–substrate {{interaction}} is the induced fit model. This model proposes that the initial interaction between enzyme and substrate is relatively weak, but that these weak interactions rapidly induce <b>conformational</b> changes in the enzyme that strengthen binding. These <b>conformational</b> changes also bring catalytic residues in the active site close to the chemical bonds in the substrate that will be altered in the reaction. <b>Conformational</b> changes can be measured using circular dichroism or dual polarisation interferometry. After binding takes place, one or more mechanisms of catalysis lower {{the energy of the}} reaction's transition state by providing an alternative chemical pathway for the reaction. Mechanisms of catalysis include catalysis by bond strain; by proximity and orientation; by active-site proton donors or acceptors; covalent catalysis and quantum tunnelling.|$|E
5|$|Certain non-inhibitory serpins {{also use}} the serpin <b>conformational</b> change {{as part of their}} function. For example, the native (S) form of thyroxine-binding {{globulin}} has high affinity for thyroxine, whereas the cleaved (R) form has low affinity. Similarly, transcortin has higher affinity for cortisol when in its native (S) state, than its cleaved (R) state. Thus, in these serpins, RCL cleavage and the S to R transition has been commandeered to allow for ligand release, rather than protease inhibition.|$|E
5|$|Crystallographic {{structure}} of fsTnI in troponin complex from chicken fast skeletal muscle showed an overall structure {{similar to that}} of cardiac troponin. The inhibitory region of fsTnI was resolved in skeletal troponin whereas it was invisible in the cardiac troponin crystal structure. Based on the crystal structure, a schematic illustration (Fig. 3) was proposed to show the <b>conformational</b> changes in troponin during muscle activation and relaxation.|$|E
5|$|After the {{processed}} antigen (peptide) is complexed to the MHC molecule, {{they both}} migrate together {{to the cell}} membrane, where they are exhibited (elaborated) as a complex that can be recognized by the CD 4+ (T helper cell)– a type of white blood cell. This is known as antigen presentation. However, the epitopes (<b>conformational</b> epitopes) that are recognized by the B cell prior to their digestion {{may not be the}} same as that presented to the T helper cell. Additionally, a B cell may present different peptides complexed to different MHC-II molecules.|$|E
5|$|Certain serpins spontaneously {{undergo the}} S to R {{transition}} without having been cleaved by a protease, {{to form a}} conformation termed the latent state. Latent serpins are unable to interact with proteases and so are no longer protease inhibitors. The <b>conformational</b> change to latency is {{not exactly the same}} as the S to R transition of a cleaved serpin. Since the RCL is still intact, the first strand of the C-sheet has to peel off to allow full RCL insertion.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to ion pumps, ion channels do not build chemical gradients but rather dissipate {{them in order}} to perform work or send a signal. Probably the most familiar and best studied example is the voltage-gated Na+ channel, which allows conduction of an action potential along neurons. All ion pumps have some sort of trigger or “gating” mechanism. In the previous example it was electrical bias, but other channels can be activated by binding a molecular agonist or through a <b>conformational</b> change in another nearby protein.|$|E
5|$|Poor {{breeding}} may {{be encouraged}} {{by the fact that}} many horses are sent to the breeding shed following an injury. If the injury is linked to a <b>conformational</b> fault, the fault is likely to be passed to the next generation. Additionally, some breeders will have a veterinarian perform straightening procedures on a horse with crooked legs. This can help increase the horse's price at a sale and perhaps help the horse have a sounder racing career, but the genes for poor legs will still be passed on.|$|E
5|$|Rosetta@home is a {{distributed}} computing project aimed at protein structure prediction {{and is one}} of the most accurate tertiary structure predictors. The <b>conformational</b> states from Rosetta's software can be used to initialize a Markov state model as starting points for Folding@home simulations. Conversely, structure prediction algorithms can be improved from thermodynamic and kinetic models and the sampling aspects of protein folding simulations. As Rosetta only tries to predict the final folded state, and not how folding proceeds, Rosetta@home and Folding@home are complementary and address very different molecular questions.|$|E
25|$|If {{the bond}} angles, bond lengths and torsion angles of the {{components}} are not modified at any stage of complex generation, it is known as rigid body docking. A subject of speculation {{is whether or not}} rigid-body docking is sufficiently good for most docking. When substantial <b>conformational</b> change occurs within the components at the time of complex formation, rigid-body docking is inadequate. However, scoring all possible <b>conformational</b> changes is prohibitively expensive in computer time. Docking procedures which permit <b>conformational</b> change, or flexible docking procedures, must intelligently select small subset of possible <b>conformational</b> changes for consideration.|$|E
25|$|A protein may undergo {{reversible}} {{structural changes}} in performing its biological function. The alternative {{structures of the}} same protein {{are referred to as}} different <b>conformational</b> isomers, or simply, conformations, and transitions between them are called <b>conformational</b> changes.|$|E
25|$|Nonlinear {{optimization}} {{methods are}} widely used in <b>conformational</b> analysis.|$|E
25|$|The <b>conformational</b> change most {{relevant}} for Factor IXa and Xa inhibition involves the P14 and P15 amino acids within the N-terminal {{region of the}} reactive site loop (circled in Figure 4 model B). This region has been termed the hinge region. The <b>conformational</b> change within the hinge region in response to heparin binding results in the expulsion of P14 and P15 from {{the main body of}} the protein and it has been shown that by preventing this <b>conformational</b> change, increased Factor IXa and Xa inhibition does not occur. It is thought that the increased flexibility given to the reactive site loop as a result of the hinge region <b>conformational</b> change is a key factor in influencing increased Factor IXa and Xa inhibition. It has been calculated that in the absence of the pentasaccharide only one in every 400 Antithrombin molecules (0.25%) is in an active conformation with the P14 and P15 amino acids expelled.|$|E

25|$|In living cells, {{signals are}} {{processed}} by networks of proteins that {{can act as}} complex computational devices. These networks rely {{on the ability of}} single proteins to exist in a variety of functionally different states achieved through multiple mechanisms, including post-translational modifications, ligand binding, <b>conformational</b> change, or formation of new complexes. Similarly, nucleic acids can undergo a variety of transformations, including protein binding, binding of other nucleic acids, <b>conformational</b> change and DNA methylation.|$|E
25|$|Finnhorse: mane {{and tail}} are left natural for <b>conformational</b> showing. They may be, but rarely are, braided for other disciplines.|$|E
25|$|CFTR {{functions}} as an ATP-gated anion channel, increasing the conductance for certain anions (e.g. Cl−) to flow down their electrochemical gradient. ATP-driven <b>conformational</b> changes in CFTR {{open and close}} a gate to allow transmembrane flow of anions down their electrochemical gradient. This in contrast to other ABC proteins, in which ATP-driven <b>conformational</b> changes fuel uphill substrate transport across cellular membranes. Essentially, CFTR is an ion channel that evolved as a 'broken' ABC transporter that leaks when in open conformation.|$|E
25|$|<b>Conformational</b> entropy – is the entropy {{associated}} with the physical arrangement of a polymer chain that assumes a compact or globular state in solution.|$|E
25|$|The {{coupling}} of proton translocation and electron transport in Complex I {{is currently}} proposed as being indirect (long range <b>conformational</b> changes) {{as opposed to}} direct (redox intermediates in the hydrogen pumps as in heme groups of Complexes III and IV). The architecture of the hydrophobic region of complex I shows multiple proton transporters that are mechanically interlinked. The three central components believed to contribute to this long-range <b>conformational</b> change event are the pH-coupled N2 iron-sulfur cluster, the quinone reduction, and the transmembrane helix subunits of the membrane arm. Transduction of <b>conformational</b> changes to drive the transmembrane transporters linked by a 'connecting rod' during the reduction of ubiquinone can account {{for two or three}} of the four protons pumped per NADH oxidized. The remaining proton must be pumped by direct coupling at the ubiquinone-binding site. It is proposed that direct and indirect coupling mechanisms account for the pumping of the four protons.|$|E
25|$|The general {{mechanism}} for the transport cycle of ABC transporters has not been fully elucidated but substantial structural and biochemical data has accumulated to support a model in which ATP binding and hydrolysis is coupled to <b>conformational</b> changes in the transporter. The resting state of all ABC transporters has the NBDs in an open dimer configuration, with low affinity for ATP. This open conformation possesses a chamber accessible to {{the interior of the}} transporter. The transport cycle is initiated by binding of substrate to the high-affinity site on the TMDs, which induces <b>conformational</b> changes in the NBDs and enhances the binding of ATP. Two molecules of ATP bind, cooperatively, to form the closed dimer configuration. The closed NBD dimer induces a <b>conformational</b> change in the TMDs such that the TMD opens, forming a chamber with an opening opposite to that of the initial state. The affinity of the substrate to the TMD is reduced, thereby releasing the substrate. Hydrolysis of ATP follows and then sequential release of Pi and then ADP restores the transporter to its basal configuration. Although a common mechanism has been suggested, the order of substrate binding, nucleotide binding and hydrolysis, and <b>conformational</b> changes, as well as interactions between the domains is still debated.|$|E
25|$|Increased Factor IXa and Xa {{inhibition}} {{requires the}} minimal heparin pentasaccharide sequence. The <b>conformational</b> {{changes that occur}} within antithrombin in response to pentasaccharide binding are well documented.|$|E
25|$|The crystal {{structure}} {{reveals that the}} catalytic region of Epac2 interacts with cNBD-B intramolecularly, {{and in the absence}} of cAMP is sterically masked by a regulatory region, which thereby inhibits interaction between the catalytic region and Rap1. The {{crystal structure}} of the cAMP analog-bound active form of Epac2 in a complex with Rap1B indicates that the binding of cAMP to the cNBD-B domain induces the dynamic <b>conformational</b> changes that allow the regulatory region to rotate away. This <b>conformational</b> change enables access of Rap1 to the catalytic region and allows activation.|$|E
25|$|The high {{activation}} energy (270 kJ/mol) of the deactivation process indicates {{the occurrence of}} major <b>conformational</b> changes in the organisation of the complex I. However, until now, the only <b>conformational</b> difference observed between these two forms {{is the number of}} cysteine residues exposed at the surface of the enzyme. Treatment of the D-form of complex I with the sulfhydryl reagents N-Ethylmaleimide or DTNB irreversibly blocks critical cysteine residue(s), abolishing the ability of the enzyme to respond to activation, thus inactivating it irreversibly. The A-form of complex I is insensitive to sulfhydryl reagents.|$|E
25|$|The hinge {{region of}} {{antithrombin}} in the Figure 5 complex {{could not be}} modelled due to its <b>conformational</b> flexibility, and amino acids P9-P14 are not seen in this structure. This <b>conformational</b> flexibility indicates an equilibrium may exist within the complex between a P14 P15 reactive site loop inserted antithrombin conformation and a P14 P15 reactive site loop expelled conformation. In support of this, analysis of the positioning of P15 Gly in the Figure 5 complex (labelled in model B) shows it to be inserted into beta sheet A (see model C).|$|E
25|$|Due to {{its ability}} to <b>conformational</b> changes and {{interaction}} with many proteins actin acts as a regulator of formation and activity of protein complexes such as transcriptional complex.|$|E
25|$|ABC {{transporters}} {{are active}} transporters, that is, they require {{energy in the}} form of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to translocate substrates across cell membranes. These proteins harness the energy of ATP binding and/or hydrolysis to drive <b>conformational</b> changes in the transmembrane domain (TMD) and consequently transports molecules. Both ABC importers and exporters have a common mechanism in transporting substrates because of the similarities in their structures. The mechanism that describes the <b>conformational</b> changes associated with binding of substrate is the alternating-access model. In this model, the substrate binding site alternates between outward- and inward-facing conformations. The relative binding affinities of the two conformations for the substrate largely determines the net direction of transport. For importers, since translocation is directed from the periplasm to the cytoplasm, then the outward-facing conformation will have higher binding affinity for substrate. In contrast, the substrate binding affinity in exporters will be greater in the inward-facing conformation. A model that describes the <b>conformational</b> changes in the nucleotide-binding domain (NBD) as a result of ATP binding and hydrolysis is the ATP-switch model. This model presents two principal conformations of the NBDs: formation of a closed dimer upon binding two ATP molecules and dissociation to an open dimer facilitated by ATP hydrolysis and release of inorganic phosphate (Pi) and adenosine diphosphate (ADP). Switching between the open and closed dimer conformations induces <b>conformational</b> changes in the TMD resulting in substrate translocation.|$|E
25|$|Prions are {{infectious}} {{forms of}} proteins. In general, proteins fold into discrete units that perform distinct cellular functions, but some proteins are also capable of forming an infectious <b>conformational</b> state {{known as a}} prion. Although often viewed {{in the context of}} infectious disease, prions are more loosely defined by their ability to catalytically convert other native state versions of the same protein to an infectious <b>conformational</b> state. It is in this latter sense that they can be viewed as epigenetic agents capable of inducing a phenotypic change without a modification of the genome.|$|E
