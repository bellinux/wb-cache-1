50|$|Colijn de <b>Coter</b> (c. 1440-1445 - c. 1522-1532) was {{an early}} Netherlandish painter who {{produced}} mainly altarpieces. He worked primarily in Brussels and Antwerp. His name was sometimes given as Colijn van Brusele (Colijn of Brussels), indicating that he hailed from Brussels or at the least lived there most of his active life. He also signed several paintings with Coliin de <b>Coter</b> pingit me in Brabancia Bruselle ("Colijn de <b>Coter</b> painted me in Brussels {{in the region of}} Brabant").|$|E

50|$|Although unproven, {{art historians}} believe Colijn de <b>Coter</b> headed an {{influential}} workshop {{with a number}} of pupils. This conclusion is based on the diversity in style and quality of the work attributed to him. The Leiden painter Cornelis Engebrechtsz. may have been one of his pupils.|$|E
50|$|De <b>Coter</b> {{was born}} around 1440-1445. This can be deduced from a 1479 {{document}} in the Brussels archives, naming {{him as a}} husband, painter and tenant of a house; in other words, he must have already reached adulthood in that year. Another document, dating from 1483, refers to him as Colijn van Brusele (Colijn of Brussels). This document states that he had registered with the Guild of Saint Luke in Antwerp and decorated a vault in the chapel of that guild in the Cathedral of Our Lady in Antwerp. The archives of the Brussels Brotherhood of Saint Eloy list three payments to Colijn de <b>Coter</b> in 1509-1511 for painting a church tabernacle. From the archives of this brotherhood, we can also deduce that the painter's death probably fell somewhere in the period 1522-1532.|$|E
50|$|He {{was born}} in 1957 in Gazzaniga, a village in the {{province}} of Bergamo (Italy). He was ordained a priest in the Diocese of Bergamo on June 20, 1981.

50|$|During antiquity, Tibiuca was {{the seat}} of an ancient bishopric, suffragan of the Archdiocese of Carthage. There are two bishops {{attributable}} to Roman era Tibiuca. The first is Felix of Thibiuca, who suffered {{at the time of}} Diocletian; his vita reports that he was deported to Italy and martyred in Venosa in Apulia. It is commemorated in the Roman martyrology on the date of October 24. Another bishop of Tibiuca was Pascasio, {{who took part in the}} Council of Carthage (411). The diocese at that time had no Donatist bishops. Today, Tibiuca survives as titular bishopric and the current Bishop is Eugenio <b>Coter,</b> of Pando.|$|E
50|$|Contracts {{survive for}} two lost works by de <b>Coter</b> one dated 1493 for the {{decoration}} of a vault of a chapel and the other dated 1509-10 for the commission for the church tabernacle mentioned above. While the dates of these documents mark the known boundaries of his active period, his surviving work shows that this period more likely spanned from the years 1480 to 1525. Three signed paintings are known: St Luke Painting the Virgin in the parish church of Vieure, Cosne d’Allier, the altarpiece of the Trinity (Paris, Louvre) and the Virgin Crowned by Angels (Düsseldorf, private collection). These works are {{the basis for the}} attributions of other works to this artist.|$|E
40|$|Blends of PET {{with the}} {{different}} commercial <b>co(ter)</b> polymer compatibilisers were prepared {{and the effect}} of their glycidyl methacrylate (GMA) content and viscosity on the blend properties was determined. The efficiency of compatibilisation of the commercial <b>co(ter)</b> polymer in the ternary blends was examined and compared. For all the ternary blends (PET/EPR/co(ter) polymer, the PET content was fixed at 70 wt% of the total weight of the blends. Higher compatibilisation effect was found in PET/EPR blends compatibilised with the commercial copolymer ethylene glycidyl methacrylate (E-GMA 8 (5)) containing 8 % GMA and MFI = 5 (g/ 10 min) was achieved as reflected in the observed higher elongation at break when compared to corresponding blends compatibilised with the methyl acrylate containing terpolymer ethylene methyl acrylate glycidyl methacrylate EM-GMA 8 (6) containing 8 % GMA and MFI = 6 (g/ 10 min). The presence of methyl acrylate ester groups in the commercial terpolymer EM-GMA (containing similar amount of GMA and same MFI) resulted in low level of compatibilisation due to the possibility of a higher extent of branching and crosslinking resulting from the presence of the ester groups and this would be responsible for the observed lower elongation, and the less favourable morphology observed. Further, the more bulky structure of the terpolymer compared to the copolymer would give rise to a more difficult migration to the interface, thus lowering the efficiency of compatibilisation. However, the morphology of both blends compatibilised with either the terpolymer or the copolymer were not significantly different...|$|E
30|$|In {{addition}} to revealing {{the presence of}} manganese, the quantitative SEM–EDX analyses indicate the type of glass in each case. This {{is dependent on the}} raw materials used to make it, including the silica source, whether pebbles or sand, and especially the type of ash that was the source of the alkali flux. In the Mediterranean area the ash of coastal halophytic plants was used, producing soda-ash glass rich in sodium, as found in all except one of the Italian paintings analysed at the National Gallery. Glass of this type was also identified in the National Gallery’s Northern European paintings, including five of the twelve German works (see table in [8]). Several more examples in German works were published by Lutzenberger, who also found it in one Netherlandish work by Colijn de <b>Coter</b> painted before 1510 [14]. Another Netherlandish occurrence is added here; Lucas Van Leyden‘s, A Man aged 38 (NG 3604) of about 1521 (Table  1). In the fifteenth century and the early sixteenth century this glass is likely to have been imported from Italy, although a little later soda-ash glass was being made in the Netherlands following the arrival of Italian glassmakers in centres such as Antwerp [18].|$|E
40|$|Existing {{technologies}} have been tailored to deliver cost-effective irrigation on a railway embankment and excavated steep slopes (referred to as batters) within a semiarid environment. Irrigation is {{to aid the}} establishment of 100 % grass <b>coter</b> {{within a few weeks}} to mitigate soil erosion problems. It is based on water sourced from a temporary excavated pond plus the use of a solar powered pump and a drip irrigation system. Railway batter erosion remediation is timed for the wet summer season when irrigation can be used to supplement natural rainfall. For a given irrigation demand and catchment area, critical (minimum) pond volume is estimated from regional charts developed for ungauged catchments [...] About 20 % of the critical volume is added to account for evaporation losses and dead storage. Also, seepage losses need to be considered if the soil is medium to coarse textured and if the pond is not lined with an impermeable material. Initial results are very encouraging with a cost estimate of ~ ~ $ 2. 7 4 o/fm b~att er aea treated (irrigated). Irrigation unit cost is expected to decrease with a larger scale irrigated batter area and the refinement of technologies and installation procedures. Although irrigation methodologies were developed for railway embankments and excavated slopes, they can also be used for erosion control on steep slopes such as road embankments or excavated slopes and earth dam side slopes...|$|E
