5|$|A person under 21 who {{is convicted}} of driving with a BAC level {{of at least}} 0.01%, but less than 0.08% will have their driver's license {{suspended}} for 1 to 3 months, be required to perform 15–30 hours of <b>community</b> <b>service,</b> <b>and</b> take part in an alcohol education program. Penalties for refusal to submit a breath sample {{are the same as}} driving with a BAC over 0.15%. The holder of a commercial driver's license (CDL) is subject to a one-year suspension of their CDL for the first offense, and a lifetime CDL suspension for repeat offenses if they drive a commercial vehicle with a BAC of 0.04% or greater, drive an automobile with a BAC of 0.08% or greater, or refuse to submit a breath sample. More severe penalties may be imposed if the DUI took place within 1000 feet of a school, or if there was a juvenile in the vehicle. DUI accidents resulting in serious injury or death are considered indictable crimes.|$|E
5|$|After {{a four-month}} investigation, the {{criminal}} justice branch of the Attorney General of British Columbia announced formal charges of assault causing bodily harm against Bertuzzi on June 24, 2004. With the charge, Bertuzzi faced up to one-and-a-half years in prison. Bertuzzi pleaded guilty to the assault charge on December 22 after arranging a plea bargain with prosecutors. He was given a conditional discharge requiring 80 hours of <b>community</b> <b>service</b> <b>and</b> one year's probation that additionally prohibited him from playing in any hockey game Moore was competing in. Under Canadian law, Bertuzzi's successful completion of his probationary period precluded him from a criminal record. Moore expressed disappointment regarding Bertuzzi's discharge and was upset that {{he was unable to}} attend the court date, having to issue a written victim statement instead. Moore's lawyer, Tim Danson, was given one day's notice of the court date following Bertuzzi's plea bargain, which he said was insufficient time for Moore to travel to Vancouver.|$|E
5|$|Bokhary was {{involved}} in a second altercation at around 3am on 13 July 2008, again in Central. Short of cash with which to pay the HK$17.80 taxi fare, she proffered her credit card.

5|$|In 1972 a {{testimonial}} {{match was}} organised by Everton on Lawton's behalf {{to help him}} pay off his debts of around £6,000. However his financial situation was still bleak, and on two occasions he narrowly avoided a prison sentence for failing to pay his rates after an Arsenal supporters club and later an anonymous former co-worker stepped in {{to pay the bill}} for him. In August 1974, he was again found Guilty of obtaining goods by deception after failing to repay a £10 debt to a publican, and was sentenced to 200 hours of <b>Community</b> <b>service</b> <b>and</b> ordered to pay £40 costs.

5|$|Linden's long tenure {{with the}} Canucks (Linden holds second most games played in {{franchise}} history at 1,140), deep attachment {{to the city of}} Vancouver and history of charitable <b>community</b> <b>service</b> <b>and</b> involvement have {{made him one of the}} most beloved and respected players among fans {{in franchise history}}. His 2001 return to the Canucks was an emotional event for fans and players alike, with Linden admitting that he was too excited to sleep the night before his first game back. He is still often referred to affectionately as 'Captain Canuck', despite not having captained the team since 1997. On April 5, 2008, the Canucks' final game of the 2007–08 season, the Vancouver crowd gave Linden a standing ovation before the start of the third period. Once the game ended, the crowd again rose to their feet in recognition of Linden.|$|E
5|$|On 10 November 2004, two {{suspected}} attackers {{were captured}} after an hour-long siege {{of a building}} in The Hague.

5|$|Throughout the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s, members {{helped to}} sponsor job training, reading enrichment, {{heritage}} and youth programs. By encouraging youth to improve math, science, and reading skills, the sorority continued {{a legacy of}} <b>community</b> <b>service</b> <b>and</b> pledged to enrich the lives of others. Financially, Alpha Kappa Alpha expanded funding for projects in 1953 through the creation and trademark of a fashion show called Fashionetta. Politically, ACHR continued lobbying for equality concerning civil rights during the 1950s and 1960s. According to Collier-Thomas, the ACHR drew attention to legislation concerning education, transportation, employment, and improving equality {{in the armed forces}} and public places. The ACHR participated in filing civil rights cases in amicus curiae with Bolling v. Sharpe and 1954's Brown v. Board of Education. However, as a whole, ACHR voted to dissolve operations in 1963.|$|E
5|$|A {{few years}} earlier, a healthy Nalla {{took part in}} various street theatre {{performances}} protesting against multinational corporation-driven industrialisation, {{that resulted in the}} marginalisation of the labour force. He was at odds with Kandasamy Padayatchi (Nassar), a manipulative factory owner who refused to give his workers a raise. Nalla satirically imitated Padayatchi in many of his shows. However, in an unexpected turn of events, Nalla and Padayatchi's daughter Balasaraswathi, called Bala (Kiran Rathod), fell in love with each other. Realising their chances of getting together would be slim if Padayatchi knew about their relationship, Nalla and Bala decided to elope to Kerala. Nalla boarded a bus bound for Kerala, and on his way to meet Bala, the bus crashed on a hillside leaving him scarred, disfigured, and partially paralysed for life. After recovering from his wounds, he visited Bala only to be informed by Padayatchi that his daughter was already married and has settled abroad. Padayatchi had earlier lied to Bala that Nalla died in the accident. It was also at this time that Nalla became a firm believer in kindness and love. Despite suffering from an inferiority complex due to his scarred and deformed body, Nalla performs <b>community</b> <b>service</b> <b>and</b> social work with renewed fervour while continuing to fight for union causes.|$|E
5|$|Mitchell {{turned himself}} in to {{authorities}} on March 12, 2012, after being indicted on federal tax fraud charges. He was arraigned on March 22 on the charges, and a warrant for his arrest in Indiana for failure to pay child support led to his incarceration in Orange County, Florida. In May 2012, Mitchell {{filed a lawsuit against}} a married couple, who were defendants in his previous charges, citing fraud, breach of contract, and intentional infliction of emotional distress. Mitchell pleaded guilty on March 8, 2013, to one count of conspiring to file a false tax claim with the federal government. At a hearing on October 24, 2013, in Orlando, Florida, he claimed that his crime stemmed from concussions he suffered during his career in the NFL, adding that he suffers from headaches, insomnia, and memory loss. That memory loss was cited as a possible reason for his failing to pay child support in that case as well. His attorneys asked the judge in the case that Mitchell only be sentenced to <b>community</b> <b>service</b> <b>and</b> probation. On October 29, he was sentenced to serve 37 months in prison. He began his sentence on December 6.|$|E
