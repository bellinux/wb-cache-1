5|$|After {{ordering}} {{almost all}} <b>civilians</b> <b>to</b> {{leave the city}} in September, Sherman gave instructions that all military and government buildings in Atlanta be burned, although many private homes and shops were burned as well. This was to set a precedent for future behavior by his armies.|$|E
5|$|Russia {{deliberately}} attacked fleeing {{civilians in}} South Ossetia and the Gori district of Georgia. Russian warplanes bombed civilian population centres in Georgia proper and villages of ethnic Georgians in South Ossetia. Armed militias engaged in looting, arson attacks and abductions, forcing Georgian <b>civilians</b> <b>to</b> flee.|$|E
5|$|The {{conscription}} of German men at {{the start}} of the war created a manpower shortage in German factories important for the war effort. From 1915, the Germans encouraged Belgian <b>civilians</b> <b>to</b> enlist voluntarily to work in Germany but the 30,000 recruits of the policy proved insufficient to meet demands.|$|E

5|$|By August 8, the 50,000-watt {{standard}} wave {{station on}} Saipan the OWI radio station, broadcast a similar message to Japan every 15 minutes about Hiroshima, stating that more Japanese cities would face {{a similar fate}} {{in the absence of}} immediate acceptance of the terms of the Potsdam Declaration and emphatically urged <b>civilians</b> <b>to</b> evacuate major cities. Radio Japan, which continued to extoll victory for Japan by never surrendering, had informed the Japanese of the destruction of Hiroshima by a single bomb.|$|E
5|$|During World War II, Hōshō {{participated in}} the Battle of Midway in June 1942 in a {{secondary}} role. After the battle, the carrier resumed her training role in Japanese home waters {{for the duration of}} the conflict and survived the war with only minor damage from air attacks. She was used as a repatriation transport after the war, making nine trips to bring some 40,000 Japanese soldiers and <b>civilians</b> <b>to</b> Japan from overseas locations. Hōshō was scrapped in Japan beginning in 1946.|$|E
5|$|Georgian {{artillery}} units launched smoke bombs into South Ossetia at 23:35 on 7 August. This {{was followed}} by a 15-minute intermission, which purportedly enabled the <b>civilians</b> <b>to</b> escape, before the Georgian forces began bombarding enemy targets. Georgian military intentionally targeted South Ossetian military objects, not civilian ones. Although Georgian military had promised safety to the Russian peacekeepers for their neutrality, the Russian peacekeepers had to follow the Russian command to attack the Georgian troops.|$|E

5|$|Initially, {{the living}} {{conditions}} of the Robinsons varied according {{to whether or not}} they had had time to prepare. There were roughly three days between the signing of the capitulation and the deadline for <b>civilians</b> <b>to</b> leave the city, during which those who made the decision to stay could stockpile food and water, and camouflage their hiding places. As time passed, supplies ran out, and many Robinsons had to change their locations for security reasons. The situation soon became equally desperate for all who remained.|$|E
5|$|The 610 Office's {{intelligence}} collection efforts are bolstered through he cultivation of paid civilian informants. 610 Offices at local levels {{have been found}} to offer substantial monetary rewards for information leading to the capture of Falun Gong practitioners, and 24-hour hotlines have been created for <b>civilians</b> <b>to</b> report on Falun Gong-related activity. In some locales, 'responsibility measures' are enacted whereby workplaces, schools, neighborhood committees and families are held accountable for monitoring and reporting on Falun Gong practitioners within their ranks.|$|E
5|$|The {{occupation}} {{coincided with}} a religious revival in Belgium which had always been overwhelmingly Catholic. The Primate of Belgium, Cardinal Désiré-Joseph Mercier, became {{an outspoken critic of}} the German occupation regime. Mercier published a celebrated pamphlet entitled Patriotisme et Endurance (Patriotism and Endurance) on Christmas Day 1914 which called for <b>civilians</b> <b>to</b> observe occupation laws only which were consistent with Belgian patriotism and Christian values. The pamphlet attacked the authority of the German occupying government, stating that any rule legitimised by force alone should not be obeyed.|$|E

5|$|To {{cope with}} the ongoing war situation, Charles had {{introduced}} martial law to large swathes of the country; he extended this during 1626 and 1627, as the financial constraints imposed by Parliament began to cut into pay, leading to soldiers rioting. Under {{the law of the}} time, martial law was declared by the local military commander, at which point a group of Commissioners would be empowered to decide on the facts of offences, before passing the case to the commander, who would pass judgment. In practice, things worked completely differently. In Dover, the forces were commanded by Lord Conway, who declared martial law. Not only were commissioners authorised to decide on the facts, they were also permitted to authorise summary judgments, including the execution of people they deemed to be guilty. In addition, the commissioners were given the power not only to resolve billeting disputes between soldiers and civilians, but to order <b>civilians</b> <b>to</b> provide quarters for the troops. A later declaration of martial law in Portsmouth extended the commission's remit yet again, allowing for <b>civilians</b> <b>to</b> be tried under martial law and, if necessary, sentenced to death. Even this did not solve the problems, as soldiers would often wander outside the jurisdiction of the commissioners; to deal with this, February 1627 saw a Provost Marshal introduced to each county, bringing the entire nation under martial law.|$|E
5|$|To promote ethnic harmony, in 1648 an {{imperial}} decree formulated by Dorgon allowed Han Chinese <b>civilians</b> <b>to</b> marry {{women from the}} Manchu Banners, {{with the permission of}} the Board of Revenue if they were registered daughters of officials or commoners, or the permission of their banner company captain if they were unregistered commoners. Only later in the dynasty were these policies allowing intermarriage rescinded.|$|E
5|$|When {{the small}} party of {{survivors}} arrived in Gonzales on March 13 they found Sam Houston, {{the commander of}} all Texian forces, waiting there with about 400men. After Dickinson and Joe related {{the details of the}} battle and the strength of Santa Anna's army, Houston advised all <b>civilians</b> <b>to</b> evacuate and then ordered the army to retreat. This {{was the beginning of the}} Runaway Scrape, in which much of the population of Texas, including the acting government, rushed to the east to escape the advancing Mexican Army.|$|E

5|$|During {{the last}} weeks of the war the {{remnants}} of the 366th Independent Infantry Battalion were pursued by Australian Army patrols, air attacks and groups of local Dayaks organised by the Australian Services Reconnaissance Department. These attacks led to the disintegration of the unit. Major General Akashi led {{the remnants of the}} forces stationed at Brunei {{as well as a number}} of Japanese <b>civilians</b> <b>to</b> the inland town of Tenom; this trek took 40 days and involved traversing mountainous and trackless terrain. However, the forces involved suffered heavy casualties, with 50 percent of the 367th Battalion's soldiers being killed between 10 June and the end of the war. The 369th and 370th Independent Infantry Battalions did not see combat, and remained largely intact at the end of the war. Following the Japanese surrender, the survivors of the 56th Independent Mixed Brigade were concentrated in locations selected by the Australian forces.|$|E
5|$|In the {{northern}} {{sector of the}} island, in February 1945, Major General Kesao Kijima—commander of the Japanese 38th Independent Mixed Brigade— had ordered a withdrawal to Numa Numa, following the fighting around Tsimba Ridge. He subsequently left a force of 1,400 sailors drawn from the 87th Naval Garrison Force and 2,000 <b>civilians</b> <b>to</b> hold the Bonis Peninsula. Of these civilians, about 600 were armed, although only half were trained to undertake a combat role. As their supplies dwindled, in May–June the Japanese sailors—under the command of Captain Eikichi Kato, the senior naval officer in Buka—began to raid the Australian supply lines between Ruri Bay and Ratsua as they attempted {{to hold a position}} between Porton Plantation and Tarbut.|$|E
5|$|Ninety-seven British {{prisoners were}} killed and the Germans forced French <b>civilians</b> <b>to</b> bury the bodies in a shallow mass grave the next day. Despite the German efforts, Private William O'Callaghan had survived and pulled Private Albert Pooley alive from among the bodies in the field. The pair then hid in a pig-sty {{for three days and}} nights, {{surviving}} on raw potatoes and water from puddles before being discovered by the farm's owner, Madame Duquenne-Creton, and her son Victor. The French civilians risked their lives caring for the two men, who were later captured by the Wehrmacht's 251st Infantry Division and transferred to a military hospital.|$|E

5|$|She put to sea in late December with 103 Marines to {{reinforce}} their detachment at Johnston Island (about 750 nautical miles—860 miles, or 1,390km—west of Hawaii), and evacuated 47 <b>civilians</b> <b>to</b> Hawaii the following month. A convoy assignment took Mahan to Samoa, where she joined Task Force 17 (including the carrier , two cruisers and five destroyers). The task force carried out raids on Jaluit Atoll, Mili Atoll and Makin Atoll (Butaritari) in the Marshall Islands and Gilbert Islands. Mahan {{moved on to}} Canton Island in late February 1942, temporarily assigned to offshore patrol duty. By early April, she was at sea with a convoy bound for San Pedro, California. The ship then steamed north to the Mare Island Naval Shipyard for overhaul, docking on 18 April 1942.|$|E
5|$|The emperor's role as supreme judge {{could be}} {{temporarily}} duplicated by any official he designated {{in times of}} emergency or in distant borderlands where central government had little influence. This entailed a symbolic conferral of power, which was embodied in the Staff of Authority (Jiezhang 節杖). Roughly 2m (6ft) in height and decorated with ribbons, the Staff of Authority was often granted to an official with a specific errand, such as {{acting on behalf of}} the emperor as ambassador to a foreign country, appointing <b>civilians</b> <b>to</b> office, or immediately promoting a deserving military officer on the field of battle. Moreover, it granted its bearer the authority to sentence criminals and political rebels with execution without notifying the court first.|$|E
5|$|California was a liner {{that had}} spent {{the first years of}} the war as an armed {{merchant}} cruiser before being converted to a troopship. She had previously carried troops to Bombay in India as part of convoys WS22 and 26. She returned to the Clyde from Gibraltar on 4June as part of Convoy MFK15 and spent the next month docked in Glasgow undergoing repairs. Once this work was complete, California began to embark 470 personnel bound for West Africa on 4July. She was to be accompanied on this voyage by SS Duchess of York, which had been tasked with carrying 600 Royal Air Force personnel and <b>civilians</b> <b>to</b> West Africa, but had missed an earlier convoy owing to electrical problems. Like California, Duchess of York was a pre-war liner which had been converted to a troopship. Prior to the ships' departure it was decided to use Duchess of York to transport elements of the 5th(West Africa) Brigade to Bombay after the ships arrived at Freetown, while California would instead carry other West African personnel to the Middle East.|$|E
