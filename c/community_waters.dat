The aim of this article is to provide an analysis of the impact of the fishing sector on the economy of Galicia and to estimate some of the impacts that a reduction in the TAC for hake, established by the European Commis-sion during the period 1999 – 2003, have on the entire Galician economy using a “supply-driven ” Social Accounting Matrix (SDSAM) model for the Galician fishing sector. Hake production is considered as exogenously given and the model differentiates between activities and commodities so that both industry-by-commodity and commodity-by-commodity impacts can be calculated. The SDSAM allows us also to compute the impact distribution upon household incomes as well as the impacts on employment.

40|$|Introduction]. The {{purpose of}} this paper is {{analyzing}} the reform and modernization process of fishing industry in Galicia (Spain) during the 1989 - 1998 period in the framework of the Autonomous Community and the European Union Administrations performance. The fishing industry is identified as a strategic sector in the Galician economy, either in the direct way for its contribution to the GNP (9 %), to the employment creation and balance of trade, or indirect in the generation of an important volume of complementary and services activities. The fishing relevance as a productive activity must be considered also, valuing its multiplier effect over the coastal economies. Fishing industry involves: distant water fishing (in international and third countries waters), coastal and inshore fishing (in interior and <b>community</b> <b>waters),</b> aquaculture (including shellfishing), companies dealing with processing of sea food (canneries, refrigerating companies, frozen products companies, etc.), auxiliary sector (shipyards, raw material suppliers, packaging, machinery [...] .) and marketing sector. The wide range of sectors has taken us to select a case study, shellfishing, based on three reasons: i) in the power distribution between the Spanish Government and the Autonomous Community of Galicia, shellfishing constitutes an exclusive domain of the later, that allows an analysis of its performance in the industry ordination and promotion; ii) it’s one of the most traditional and rooted socioculturally sector in Galicia; iii) the primitive development of its exploitation model...|$|E

40|$|Some authors {{defend the}} {{implementation}} of regulation mechanisms such as individual transferable quotas, that is, the capacity to assign every fisherman an individual right {{so that he can}} fish a certain quantity of a specific species during a concrete period of time, as {{the most efficient way to}} reach a greater resource assessment and to guarantee biological sustainability. Nevertheless, much attention has been brought to the fact that, since these rights can be sold, negotiated, exchanged or transferred by the owners, it can bring about a concentration process, which would not favour social equity. In Spain, fishing legislation has been moving progressively towards {{the implementation of}} individual transferable fishing rights with regard to industrial fishing in <b>community</b> <b>waters,</b> whereas it has also kept a more traditional access system regarding coastal fishing. Law 3 / 2002 sanctions this transferability of fishing rights, although it avoids making a statement on Individual Transferable Quotas (ITQs). In Europe, after the passing of the Reform of the Common Fishery Policy, the criteria to be developed in mechanisms in fishing management tend to favour ITQs, although no regulation guidelines exist yet.

40|$|This paper {{outlines}} the approach {{taken by the}} European Union to the management of deep-sea fish stocks. An extensive range of measures was adopted in 2002, and implementation began in 2003. The scheme, which is binding on EU fishing vessels targeting deep-sea species in the North-East Atlantic, encompasses both input and output controls. In southern Europe and in the Mediterranean, deep-sea fisheries tend to be artisanal in nature, {{and in some cases}} of considerable antiquity. In northern <b>community</b> <b>waters</b> deepwater fisheries began in the 1970 ’s. These diverse fisheries, in several regions create particular problems for fisheries managers. The approach taken by the European Union was to adopt catch restrictions, in the form of total allowable catches for a range of the key deepwater species in the ICES area. In addition, a capacity restriction has been imposed. This requires that vessels that want to land more than a very small amount of some specified deepwater species should hold a license issued by its flag state. The overall capacity (in kilowatts and in gross tonnes) of vessels that can receive licences is limited to recent levels. The capacity limitation scheme is accompanied by a requirement to implement a scientific observer scheme in order to improve the scientific data available for assessment purposes.

40|$|Many European {{countries}} are exploiting common fish {{resources in the}} EU <b>community</b> <b>waters</b> and hence the management of their fisheries is highly governed by the European Common Fisheries Policy (CFP). The main objective of the CFP is that it ‘shall ensure exploitation of living aquatic resources that provides sustainable economic, environmental and social conditions ‘ (Council Regulation 2371 / 2002, p 61). Since {{the establishment of the}} CFP in 1983, the application of Total Allowable Catches (TACs) has been a key element in achieving the CFP’s objectives. Each year in December, the TACs for the coming year are negotiated between the European Commission and the Council of Ministers for Fisheries, and all Member States receive a fixed share or quota from the agreed TACs. Setting TACs is the final step of an annual process, which starts with the collection of fishery- and stock-related data at the national level. Data gathering is subjected to the provisions of the Data Collection Regulation (DCR; Council Regulation 1543 / 2000 and Commission Regulations 1639 / 2001 and 1581 / 2004) and ILVO-Fisheries is one of the partners who carries out the DCR for Belgium. Fishery independent data (derived from surveys at sea with research vessels) and fishery dependent data (e. g. landings and discard statistics, length and age compositions of fish caught by fleet segments, etc.) are used to assess the status of the stocks. The assessment of stocks in the North East Atlantic occurs under the umbrella of ICES, the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea. It is also ICES who advises the European Commission on the fishing opportunities for the coming year(s). The Commission makes use of the advice to formulate the TAC proposals for the Council of Ministers in December...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{seeks to}} analyse the {{evolution}} of the EU Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) as a Community tool for the management of a common-pool resource in the context of European integration. The theoretical framework, comprising different levels of analysis, employs European integration theories (Neo-Functionalism and Liberal Intergovernmentalism), paradigms of fisheries management (conservation, economic and social/community) and the concept of common goods. Spillover contributed {{to the development of the}} two pillars of the original policy, the structural policy and the common market organisation, which was complemented by a resource conservation regime and a common external policy regarding fisheries. Also, the European Court of Justice has played a significant role in confirming the supremacy of Community law in this field. At the same time, domestic interests in several Member States led to the extenuation of Commission proposals and to perennial stalemates, also due to the Luxembourg Compromise and especially in negotiations on distributive matters. Furthermore, since the adoption of the first CFP in 1970, overdue reforms have not been undertaken (particularly the introduction of individual transferable quotas as a market-based management tool and a definitive end to subsidising overcapacity). Partial reforms, especially concerning equal access, enshrined the status quo through repeatedly renewing derogations, thereby making them de facto permanent. The CFP has evidently failed to prevent the Tragedy of the Commons as most major fish stocks in <b>Community</b> <b>waters</b> are far below their 1983 levels, the year the common conservation regime went into effect. This trend has been exacerbated not only due to the CFP’s ambiguous objectives that stem from its common heritage with the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) but also through a tendency of the policy to be oriented toward the social/community paradigm of fisheries management. political science; neo-functionalism; integration theory; agriculture policy; intergovernmentalism; European Court of Justice; Luxembourg...|$|E
40|$|This study {{focuses on}} {{communities}} in conservation in central Philippines, {{with reference to}} marine protected areas. It analyzes communities as intersections of multiple actors with stratified interests and power, involving complex processes of place-making, ecological knowledge, tenure, governance, markets, and negotiation with domestic and international non-governmental organisations (NGOs). As rights to places are fundamentally at issue with protected areas, matters of tenure are central for the study. And because marine protected areas (MPAs) are community-based, questions of local empowerment have equal centrality. The ownership of rights to marine resources by village members is a necessary if not sufficient condition for the political empowerment of communities in conservation. The issue of property rights in the Philippines is irrevocably linked to issues of equity, as social actors confront prevailing unequal relations of power. The development of community commitment to the reconfigured arrangements of marine protected area establishment depends on substantial economic gains for marginalized villagers, an equitable distribution of those gain, the ecologically sound management of resources over which rights are negotiated and gains generated, and a socially meaningful realignment of relations of power among nested sources of authority. My analysis points to the advantages of a reinforced community property regime that would call for measures by the national government to enhance villagers' tenure over their settlements and <b>community</b> <b>waters</b> (katubigang barangay). Such a regime is no panacea for the manifold social and environmental challenges faced by communities, but it {{would enable them to}} engage more confidently and constructively with state, NGO and other interests in conservation, and to address the real or perceived threats of dislocation by externally proposed schemes.

40|$|This thesis {{analyzes}} {{material from}} an inner-city high school (ICHS) which {{is situated in}} a so-called Dominican community in New York. The students’ parents {{were born in the}} Dominican Republic, but not all students would self-ascribe as Dominicans. By using the notions of identity by Holland et al (1998), I argue that identities can not be seen as completely durable, and one can distinguish between self-ascribed and imposed identities. I view ethnicity in Barth’s (1998) terms; as unfixed boundaries that are upheld by the actors themselves that may be affected by how the larger society’s views. I regard ICHS as a site that may affect identity formation, but where students are not passive recipients (Levinson et al. 1996). One of my main findings is that students had a great freedom in choosing between different identities. This flexibility could be constrained {{by the fact that the}} students were somewhat stigmatized. This choice of identities may be contrasted to former research on Dominicans were they were regarded more as an isolated group with a common transnational identity. In ICHS Dominican students were in majority, but they did not constitute a homogenous group. Still many students reified Dominican identity to markers like music, flag, festivals, baseball and food. An explanation for this can be that they wanted to show ethnic pride. These markers could also be said to be American creations because by going to e. g. a Dominican parade one could be a part of a <b>community</b> (<b>Waters</b> 1990). Another interpretation is that the markers expressed transnational ties. The students could also choose to withdraw from Dominican ethnicity. How ICHS was organized influenced interrelations between students (Lamphere 1992). I employ Foucault (1995) to describe ICHS as a prison-school. Students were scanned every morning, and were under surveillance. In a class, a teacher tried to impose a Dominican identity by introducing a novel by a Dominican author. Furthermore, the students were organized in different language programs: Bilingual, English as a Second Language (ESL) and English mainstream. These programs could reflect individual strategies. Here I regard Spanish as a marker for Latino ethnicity. Those who spoke Spanish could under-communicate the language in school and outside (Eidheim 1994) ...|$|E

40|$|To {{improve the}} cod {{stocks in the}} Baltic Sea, a number of {{regulations}} have recently been established by the International Baltic Sea Fisheries Commission (IBSFC) and the European Commission. According to these, fishermen are obliged to use nets with escape windows (BACOMA nets) with a mesh size of the escape window of 120 mm until end of September 2003. These nets however, retain only fish {{much larger than the}} legal minimum landing size would al-low. Due to the present stock structure only few of such large fish are however existent. As a consequence fishermen use a legal alternative net. This is a conventional trawl with a cod-end of 130 mm diamond-shaped meshes (IBSFC-rules of 1 st April 2002), to be increased to 140 mm on 1 st September 2003, according to the mentioned IBSFC-rule. Due legal alterations of the net by the fishermen (e. g. use of extra stiff net material) these nets have acquired extremely low selective properties, i. e. they catch very small fish and produce great amounts of discards. Due to the increase of the minimum landing size from 35 to 38 cm for cod in the Baltic, the amount of discards has even increased since the beginning of 2003. Experiments have now been carried out with the BACOMAnet on German and Swedish commercial and research vessels since arguments were brought forward that the BACOMA net was not yet sufficiently tested on commercial vessels. The results of all experiments conducted so far, are compiled and evaluated here. As a result of the Swedish, Danish and German initiative and research the European Commission reacted upon this in June 2003 and rejected the increase of the diamond-meshed non-BACOMA net from 130 mm to 140 mm in September 2003. To protect the cod stocks in the Baltic Sea more effectively the use of traditional diamond meshed cod-ends with-out escape window are prohibited in <b>community</b> <b>waters</b> without derogation, becoming effective 1 st of September 2003. To enable more effective and simplified control of the bottom trawl fishery in the Baltic Sea the principle of a ”One-Net-Rule“ is enforced. This {{is going to be the}} BACOMA net, with the meshes of the escape window being 110 mm for the time being. The description of the BACOMA net as given in the IBSFC-rules no. 10 (revision of the 28 th session, Berlin 2002) concentrates on the cod-end and the escape window but only to a less extent on the design and mesh-composition of the remaining parts of the net, such as belly and funnel and many details. Thus, the present description is not complete and leaves, according to fishermen, ample opportunity for manipulation. An initiative has been started in Germany with joint effort from scientists and the fishery to better describe the entire net and to produce a proposal for a more comprehensive description, leaving less space for manipulation. A proposal in this direction is given here and shall be seen as a starting point for a discussion and development towards an internationally uniform net, which is agreed amongst the fishery, scientists and politicians. The Baltic Sea fishery is invited to comment on this proposal, and recommendations for further improvement and specifications are welcomed. Once the design is agreed by the Baltic Fishermen Association, it shall be proposed to the IBSFC and European Commission via the Baltic Fishermen Association. ...|$|E
40|$|Marine resources, {{so crucial}} to the {{countries}} of the South, are being over-exploited. Regulatory measures have been put in place, but must be accompanied by close surveillance of fishing vessels to be effective. Positive examples do exist, and these should be developed. June 11, 2005, saw a confrontation in Senegal between fishermen from Kayar and Guet-Ndar. The toll: one dead and several wounded. The cause of the dispute: rivalry over access to an increasingly scarce resource fish. Incidents of this kind are symptomatic of a serious problem. In August 2003, Spore sounded a cautionary note, urging the introduction of extensive political and economic changes if fish stocks were to be maintained. In March 2005, FAO confirmed that 75 % of fishery resources had been fished to their maximum yield, over-exploited or exhausted. Encouragingly, there is growing awareness of the need to move towards sustainable fisheries management, which combines long-term viability with a strategy that satisfies the needs of fishers and ensures the economic development of resources. This has translated into a growing understanding, shared by all those involved, and in a range of measures, binding or otherwise, developed to regulate fishing. But there {{is still a long way}} to go before responsible and voluntary management of marine resources is adopted by all players in the fisheries sector. As long as stocks are over-exploited, and their profits diminished, fishers will continue to break the law. That was the clear message from several participants in an internet debate organised by CTA in 2004. Crucial for ACP states The problem of fisheries surveillance is gradually being perceived as a major issue. Experts are coming up with acronyms such as IUU (illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing), MCS (monitoring, control and surveillance) and VMS (vessel monitoring system). In June 2005, a conference on the impact of illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing on developing countries was held in London. These developing nations are particularly badly affected, the meeting heard, because of a lack of funds, technical capacity, manpower, cooperation between states and, occasionally, of political will. Look out, fishers on patrol In an effort to reduce the number of conflicts between industrial and small-scale fishers, sparked by the incursion of trawlers into the zone reserved for small-scale fishing, a community surveillance project was set up in Guinea in 2002 (see Spore 110). It aimed to lower the number of trawlers by teaming up the institutions charged with coastal surveillance with the fishing communities themselves. According to Hassimiou Tall, technical advisor to the Ministry for Fisheries and Aquaculture in Guinea, the results have been very encouraging. The programme has succeeded in reducing illegal incursions by industrial trawlers by 60 % as crews now know that some small-scale fishers are working for the authorities. Relatively inexpensive (US$ 20, 000 less than 16, 500) and holding considerable promise, the Guinean experiment is due to be extended to Congo, Gabon and Mauritania. But in Guinea itself, the pilot project has been (provisionally?) suspended, due to lack of funds. More proof, if it were needed, that good ideas are not enough, unless they are backed up by adequate resources. The countries of the South are not alone. Published last May, the European Commission s annual report on serious breaches to the rules of the Common Fisheries Policy revealed that the number of infringements recorded rose from 6, 756 in 2002 to 9, 502 in 2003. Five EU member states detected nearly 90 % of all breaches. Unauthorised fishing accounted for 22 % of the cases, while the figure for unlicensed fishing was 17 %. A fine was imposed in 84 % of cases. In 4, 720 cases, fishing gear was seized. The June 2005 bulletin of the Fisheries News Update section on CTA s Agritrade website concluded that the report offered interesting lessons for ACP countries, noting that greater transparency over infringements and sanctions will increase confidence in the fair and equitable enforcement of regulations. Fisheries infringements come in many guises, they include: fishing with unlicensed boats; and failing to land catches in local ports, in spite of the obligations of fisheries agreements and falsely reporting tonnage caught. Whatever the measures taken, whether they are aimed at getting fishing zones respected, at better regulating fishing gear, at limiting the size of catches, at guaranteeing a biological rest period or at developing the economic activity of ports by making it mandatory to land all or part of catches locally, the notion of self-regulation appears to be an illusory one, and control measures are certainly needed. Some of these are already in place, and fall into two groups so-called hardware and software measures. Means and human resources Hardware measures consist of advanced and often costly and cumbersome techniques, such as radar, onboard systems and satellite. To monitor an economic zone of 200 square miles, it takes several rapid intervention boats, surveillance vessels, radar stations and even airplanes. And, of course, a computer system capable of cross checking data, with permanent internet access. For ACP countries, it is hard to reconcile such demands with budgetary constraints. These systems are essential, but they are also inadequate unless they are backed by human resources. The software techniques refer to onboard observers or the participation of fishing communities. Officially, any such observers go onboard to collect scientific data. But since they are equipped with communication tools, their information is by default used for surveillance. They run the risk therefore, if this aspect of their work were to be known, of no longer being allowed on board. Senegal s fishing committees By limiting their catches and adopting good practices, the fishers of Kayar, in Senegal, have enabled fish stocks to be replenished. A local initiative, surveillance committees see to it that this Kayar code is respected. Fishing zones have been defined and a limit imposed of 45 kg of fish per canoe per day. Highly destructive techniques such as the use of explosives or drag nets have been banned. These days, catches are smaller, but they fetch a better price. Not surprisingly, this initiative has quickly spread throughout Senegal s main fishing zones since 2001, around 50 local committees have been created. But the incidents of June 11 show that not all fishers are ready to take the idea on board. The presence of onboard observers is crucial for providing independent information on fishing activities, both on a daily and a case-by-case basis, the CTA online debate concluded. But to be effective, such methods depend on the inspectors receiving adequate training and payment, as Ms Janet Uronu, joint president for fisheries at the Ministry for Natural Resources and Tourism in Tanzania pointed out, The high levels of technology (and the principles on which it is based) to be found on modern fishing vessels were well beyond the comprehension of those fishery officers sent to inspect the vessels. The job of these inspectors also carries risks: vulnerability to corruption, especially if they are poorly paid, violence and the risk of being taken hostage, to prevent them from reporting what they have seen. A number of experiments closely linking fishing communities with surveillance operations have been carried out in West Africa. After all, the fishermen know the fishing grounds better than anyone. However, while these initiatives have produced positive results, they also raise the question of motivation the fishers are simultaneously acting as inspectors and stakeholders. This approach effectively establishes that small-scale fishers are also responsible for the over-exploitation of resources. A culture of change None of these methods will work unless at least two conditions are met. First, there must be clear rules about what is and is not allowed, accompanied by sanctions which are properly enforced. Secondly, there needs to be regional cooperation between countries facing the same problem. That is true for the North: on March 14, 2005, the EU Fisheries Council finally agreed to establish a Community Fisheries Control Agency, based in Vigo, Spain which should coordinate fishing control systems within <b>community</b> <b>waters,</b> but also an important point for ACP countries within the framework of bilateral fisheries agreements. It is also true for the South, where one of the most successful initiatives in this respect has been the MCS Programme set up by the Southern Africa Development Community (SADC). Financed by the EU, it has, since 2003, allowed bilateral and trilateral surveillance operations to be carried out between the countries concerned, and strengthened the equipment, human resources and capacity to exchange information of member countries which needed support in these areas. Tanzania, for example, now has more than 30 trained observers. According to Ms Uronu, the first change needed to achieve such results involves overcoming inertia and bureaucracy. A culture of change is essential. The Indian Ocean Tuna Commission, which numbers seven mainland or island East African countries among its members, is another example of regional cooperation. According to Mark Pearson, at the Secretariat of the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA), this cooperation has already enabled the number of refrigerated fishing vessels practising IUU fishing to be cut from 140 to 40. One method used is the exchange, between member countries and others, of lists of authorised vessels, together with their tonnage (known as the positive list). Other regional groupings in the fisheries sector may lead to similar initiatives. That has already happened in the case of the Programme pêche, commerce et environnement en Afrique de l Ouest (PCEAO), a programme set up to promote sustainable fishing in six West African states, which met in Dakar in early June 2005. The question of surveillance was not specifically on the agenda, but the West African sub-regional commission on West African fisheries, la Commission sous-régionale des pêches d Afrique de l Ouest (CSRP), does have a project to address this issue, supported by the Luxembourg Development Agency among others. In the Caribbean, the Caribbean Regional Fisheries Mechanism lists the development of a monitoring, control and surveillance system as a priority. Finally, the Monitoring, Control and Surveillance Unit of the Pacific Islands Forum Fisheries Agency (FFA), based in the Solomon Islands, has, since 1999, installed a satellite surveillance system to monitor fishing vessels on behalf of its member states. It has proved to be highly effective the number of cases of illicit fishing recorded by the authorities is, and continues to be, very small. Fisheries surveillance requires considerable means. How should available resources be best used, and what kind of support is needed? That is what future fisheries agreements being drawn up between ACP countries and the EU should try to clarify. Equally, they should encourage greater harmony between national fisheries legislation, as well as regional cooperation in various forms: data exchange, joint patrols, exchange of personnel and experiences between crews, and of surveillance systems in the EU and the ACP regions concerned. In the long run, it makes sense all round. Marine resources, so {{crucial to the}} countries of the South, are being over-exploited. Regulatory measures have been put in place, but must be accompanied by close surveillance of fishing vessels to be effective. Positive examples do exist [...] ...|$|E
