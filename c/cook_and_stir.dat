40|$|Recently, starch has {{attracted}} great consideration as a raw material on wood adhesives {{in the wood}} industry. Cassava and sago starchbased adhesive are renewable, biodegradable and environmental friendly product when compared with other petroleum-based adhesives. In this study, different starches-based adhesive has been produced. Mechanical properties of plywood made from Acacia mangium veneers with different starches-based adhesives (cassava and sago) as binder cured at different curing temperatures (100 °C, 120 °C and 140 °C) has been determined. All materials (starch, vinegar, water <b>and</b> glycerol) were <b>cooked</b> <b>and</b> <b>stirred</b> until the mixture reached 70 °C - 80 °C which become sticky and whitish. After that, starch-based adhesives were applied on the veneers by using spreader, and the plywood were pre-pressed for 30 minutes with 20 kg load before hot-press. Cassava starch-based adhesive showed the highest Modulus of Elasticity which was 12410. 56 N/mm 2 than sago starch-based adhesive, while Modulus of Rupture of the cassava starch-based adhesive at 100 °C showed highest mean value at 74. 19 N/mm 2. Sago-starch based adhesive at 140 °C showed the highest shear strength with 1. 11 N/mm 2. In short, cassava and sago starch-based adhesives gave good performance in mechanical properties such as bending for pressed temperature (100 °C and 120 °C), and shear at 140 °C pressed temperature...|$|R
50|$|In Maharashtra and Gujarat {{states of}} India the leaves as {{used to make}} a fried snack which is {{prepared}} by applying besan (gram flour) on the leaves and then frying them.Locals call the snack 'wadi'. In the recipe for kesa or kesuvina palya, which is native to Malenadu, the kesuvina (Colocasia) leaves are finely chopped and washed with water. Then the chopped Colocasia leaves are cooked in a pressure cooker by adding just a little water, not more than 5% of the quantity of Colocasia leaves. The leaves are cooked for almost 10 minutes or until the steam cooker attains 4-5 pressure whistles. The cooked leaves are then boiled in low flame. Meanwhile, spicy chillies, preferably jeerige menasinakayi (native to the Malenadu) and garlic are ground into a paste and added to the <b>cooked</b> Colocasia leaves <b>and</b> <b>stirred.</b> To this mixture, lemon extract is added, preferably 2-3 lemon extracts <b>and</b> <b>cooked</b> for 3-4 minutes. It is recommended to eat this with Akki rotti or rice with ghee.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{differences}} between the private and public discourses associated with <b>cooks</b> <b>and</b> chefs and the identities that are formed by these discourses. Academic literature and memoirs were reviewed to analyze the private discourse created among <b>cooks</b> <b>and</b> chefs that form their identities. Media articles and two movies were reviewed to analyze the public discourses that form the larger social identities of <b>cooks</b> <b>and</b> chefs. Embracing Fairhurst and Putnam’s (2004) conceptualization of “discourse” as local talk and texts and “Discoruse” as large scale systems of meaning, I conceptualized private discourse as local talk among <b>cooks</b> <b>and</b> chefs and public “Discourse” as larger meanings about <b>cooks</b> <b>and</b> chefs. Taking a becoming orientation to discourse and embracing a Foucauldian power/knowledge lens, I analyze discourses about <b>and</b> among <b>cooks</b> <b>and</b> chefs to explore their emergent identities. This analysis reveals that the public discourse surrounding the identity of <b>cooks</b> <b>and</b> chefs is oppressive and potentially limits the ways they can engage in necessary discourse to create their own identities...|$|R
