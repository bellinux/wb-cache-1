40|$|The disease {{processes}} underlying inherited retinal {{disease are}} complex and are not completely understood. Many of the <b>corrective</b> <b>gene</b> therapies designed to treat diseases linked to mutations in genes specifically expressed in photoreceptor cells restore function to these cells but fail to stop progression of the disease. There is growing consensus that effective treatments for these diseases will require delivery of multiple therapeutic proteins that will be selected to treat specific aspects of the disease process. The {{purpose of this study}} was to design a lentiviral transgene that reliably expresses all of the proteins it encodes and does so in a consistent manner among infected cells. We show, using both in vitro and in vivo analyses, that bicistronic lentiviral transgenes encoding two fluorescent proteins fused to a viral 2 A-like cleavage peptide meet these expression criteria. To determine if this transgene design is suitable for therapeutic applications, we replaced one of the fluorescent protein genes with the gene encoding guanylate cyclase - 1 (GC 1) and delivered lentivirus carrying this transgene to the retinas of the GUCY 1 *B avian model of Leber congenital amaurosis – 1 (LCA 1). GUCY 1 *B chickens carry a null mutation in the GC 1 gene that disrupts photoreceptor function and causes blindness at hatching, a phenotype that closely matches that observed in humans with LCA 1. We found that treatment of these animals with the 2 A lentivector encoding GC 1 restored vision to these animals as evidenced by the presence of optokinetic reflexes. We conclude that 2 A-like peptides, with proper optimization, can be successfully incorporated into therapeutic vectors designed to deliver multiple proteins to neural retinal. These results highlight the potential of this vector design to serve as a platform for the development of combination therapies designed to enhance or prolong the benefits of <b>corrective</b> <b>gene</b> therapies...|$|E

40|$|The newly {{discovered}} Inil cellular protein binds HIV- 1 integrase and {{is part of}} a protein complex thought to alter nucleosomal structure; such alterations may influence the selection of sites for HIV- 1 DNA integration. Many gene therapy protocols use retroviruses to deliver <b>correCtive</b> <b>genes</b> to diseased cells, primarily because retroviral infection culminates in the covalent insertion of reverse-transcribed retroviral DNA into host cell chro-mosomes. This DNA integration ensures that the thera-peutic gene will be maintained indefinitely in the target cells. But retroviral DNA integration can also adversely influence host genes; examples of potentially harmful effects include the insertional inactivation of a host gene, inappropriate transcriptional activation of a nearby gene, {{and the creation of a}} novel fusion protein by joining a viral exon to a nearby host exon [1].

Genetic modification of critical components of the inflammatory process may be beneficial-for example, overexpressing anti-elastase genes may circumvent elastase mediated lung damage in emphysema. With the development of improved viral and liposome vectors {{and the evolution of}} effective adjuvant immunosuppression to obviate host immune responses [...] for example, using selective cytokines and blockers of T cell surface activation [...] the potential exists to target therapeutic doses of transgene to deficient or dysregulated cells. Furthermore, increased understanding of tissue-specific promoter regions and of mechanisms controlling regulation of gene expression offer the potential for close control of therapeutic gene expression within the lung. Continuing refinements in these technologies will provide new therapeutic strategies in inflammatory lung disease. ...|$|R

Current approaches to hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) gene therapy involve the collection and ex vivo manipulation of HSCs, a process associated with loss of stem cell multipotency and engraftment potential. An alternative approach for correcting blood-related diseases is the direct intravenous administration of viral vectors, so called in vivo gene therapy. In this study we evaluated the safety and efficacy of in vivo gene therapy using a foamy virus vector for the correction of canine SCID-X 1.

40|$|A {{prerequisite}} for using <b>corrective</b> <b>gene</b> therapy to treat humans with inherited retinal degenerative diseases that affect primarily rods {{is to develop}} viral vectors that target specifically this population of photoreceptors. The delivery of a viral vector with photoreceptor tropism coupled with a rod-specific promoter {{is likely to be}} the safest and most efficient approach to target expression of the therapeutic gene to rods. Three promoters that included a fragment of the proximal mouse opsin promoter (mOP), the human G-protein coupled receptor protein kinase 1 promoter (hGRK 1), or the cytomegalovirus immediate early enhancer combined with the chicken beta actin proximal promoter CBA) were evaluated for their specificity and robustness in driving GFP reporter gene expression in rods, when packaged in a recombinant adeno-associated viral vector of serotype 2 / 5 (AAV 2 / 5), and delivered via subretinal injection to the normal canine retina. Photoreceptor specific promoters (mOP, hGRK 1) targeted robust GFP expression to rods, while the ubiquitously expressed CBA promoter led to transgene expression in the retinal pigment epithelium, rods, cones and rare Müller, horizontal and ganglion cells.

40|$|X-linked severe {{combined}} immunodeficiency (XSCID) is characterized by profound immunodeficiency and early mortality, the only potential cure being hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) transplantation or gene therapy. Current clinical gene therapy protocols targeting HSCs are based upon ex vivo gene transfer, potentially limited by the adequacy of HSC harvest, transduction efficiencies of repopulating HSCs, and the potential loss of their engraftment potential during ex vivo culture. We demonstrate an important proof of principle by showing achievement of durable immune reconstitution in XSCID dogs following intravenous injection of concentrated RD 114 -pseudotyped retrovirus vector encoding the <b>corrective</b> <b>gene,</b> the interleukin- 2 receptor γ chain (γc). In 3 of 4 dogs treated, normalization of numbers and function of T cells were observed. Two long-term–surviving animals (16 and 18 months) showed significant marking of B lymphocytes and myeloid cells, normalization of IgG levels, and protective humoral immune response to immunization. There were no adverse effects from in vivo gene therapy, and in one dog that reached sexual maturity, sparing of gonadal tissue from gene transfer was demonstrated.

40|$|Genetic {{diseases}} {{arise from}} the aberrant expression of genes. These disorders can potentially be treated via the introduction of <b>corrective</b> <b>genes</b> (in a process referred to as gene therapy). Two main obstacles to gene therapy of the brain are the inability to introduce therapeutic genes into all necessary cells {{and the lack of}} long-term expression of the transferred gene. ^ The focus of this dissertation has been on the development of Herpes Simplex Virus Type 1 (HSV- 1) as a vector for gene therapy of murine mucopolysaccharidosis (MPS) type VII, a lysosomal storage disease caused by mutations in the lysosomal enzyme beta-glucuronidase (GUSB). HSV- 1 is a promising vector for brain gene therapy because HSV- 1 efficiently infects and spreads through nervous tissue. The ability of HSV- 1 vectors to drive long-term transgene expression is under debate. ^ I have engineered a HSV- 1 vector (1716 -LAT-hGUSB) that expresses human GUSB in order to study brain transduction in mice. 1716 -LAT-hGUSB is able to transduce many anatomical brain regions after a single, site-specific intracranial injection. The ensuing patterns of viral latency and transgene expression differ depending upon the inoculation route. Many regions of latency are consistent with axonal transport from the injection site. ^ A quantitative analysis was performed to measure long-term (one year) transgene expression in the mouse brain. The vector genome was stably maintained at all latent time points. Expression of both latency-associated transcripts and GUSB activity both peaked in the first weeks/months of infection before reaching stable levels. The stable levels of GUSB enzymatic activity were higher than the minimal therapeutic range reported for treatment of MPS VII. ^ Adult MPS VII mice suffering from lysosomal storage were treated with 1716 -LAT-hGUSB, and lysosomal storage was corrected in several brain regions after a single intracranial injection. This study represents the first report of correction of an inherited disorder with a HSV- 1 vector, and demonstrates the potential for widespread, long-term correction with HSV- 1 -based vectors in the nervous system. ...|$|R
40|$|Introduction Retinal degenerations and dystrophies, {{the major}} causes of genetically {{inherited}} blindness, are characterised {{by the death}} or degeneration of photoreceptors (rods and/or cones). 1 Approaches to treating this disease include: a) replacing the defective gene; b) introducing a drug or agent that either slows down or stops the premature death of photoreceptors; c) introducing electronic chips; or d) replacing the damaged cells by cellular therapy. Gene therapy is aimed at counteracting the defective gene by substituting it with the normal gene in the target tissues. Though successful visual recovery has been reported with gene therapy in dog models, 2 - 3 it remains a challenge to identify a safe and reliable way of introducing the <b>corrective</b> <b>gene</b> in humans, given that the genes need to act for the lifetime of the patient.

40|$|Xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) is {{a devastating}} disease {{associated}} with dramatic skin cancer proneness. XP cells are deficient in nucleotide excision repair (NER) of bulky DNA adducts including ultraviolet (UV) -induced mutagenic lesions. Approaches of <b>corrective</b> <b>gene</b> transfer in NER-deficient keratinocyte stem cells hold great {{hope for the}} long-term treatment of XP patients. To face this challenge, we developed a retrovirus-based strategy to safely transduce the wild-type XPC gene into clonogenic human primary XP-C keratinocytes. De novo expression of XPC was maintained in both mass population and derived independent candidate stem cells (holoclones) after more than 130 population doublings (PD) in culture upon serial propagation (> 10 (40) cells). Analyses of retrovirus integration sequences in isolated keratinocyte stem cells suggested the absence of adverse effects such as oncogenic activation or clonal expansion. Furthermore, corrected XP-C keratinocytes exhibited full NER capacity as well as normal features of epidermal differentiation in both organotypic skin cultures and in a preclinical murine model of human skin regeneration in vivo. The achievement of a long-term genetic correction of XP-C epidermal stem cells constitutes the first preclinical model of ex vivo gene therapy for XP-C patients. F.

40|$|Harlequin {{ichthyosis}} (HI) is {{a devastating}} skin disorder with an unknown underlying cause. Abnormal keratinocyte lamellar granules (LGs) are {{a hallmark of}} HI skin. ABCA 12 {{is a member of}} the ATP-binding cassette transporter family, and members of the ABCA subfamily are known to have closely related functions as lipid transporters. ABCA 3 is involved in lipid secretion via LGs from alveolar type II cells, and missense mutations in ABCA 12 have been reported to cause lamellar ichthyosis type 2, a milder form of ichthyosis. Therefore, we hypothesized that HI might be caused by mutations that lead to serious ABCA 12 defects. We identify 5 distinct ABCA 12 mutations, either in a compound heterozygous or homozygous state, in patients from 4 HI families. All the mutations resulted in truncation or deletion of highly conserved regions of ABCA 12. Immunoelectron microscopy revealed that ABCA 12 localized to LGs in normal epidermal keratinocytes. We confirmed that ABCA 12 defects cause congested lipid secretion in cultured HI keratinocytes and succeeded in obtaining the recovery of LG lipid secretion after <b>corrective</b> <b>gene</b> transfer of ABCA 12. We concluded that ABCA 12 works as an epidermal keratinocyte lipid transporter and that defective ABCA 12 results in a loss of the skin lipid barrier, leading to HI.

40|$|This review {{will focus}} on new {{technologies}} in development that promise to lead to further advances in haemophilia therapeutics. There has been continued interest in the bioengineering of recombinant factor VIII (rFVIII) and factor IX (rFIX) with improved function to overcome some of the limitations in current treatment, {{the high costs of}} therapy and to increase availability to a broader world haemophilia population. Bioengineered forms of rFVIII, rFIX or alternative haemostatic molecules may ultimately have an impact on improving the efficacy of therapeutic strategies for the haemophilias by improving biosynthesis and secretion, functional activity, half-life and immunogenicity. Preventing and suppressing inhibitors to factor (F) VIII remain a challenge for both clinicians and scientists. Recent experiments have shown {{that it is possible to}} obtain anti-idiotypic antibodies with a number of desirable properties: (i) strong binding avidity to FVIII inhibitors; (ii) neutralization of inhibitory activity both in vitro and in vivo; (iii) cross-reactivity with antibodies from unrelated patients, and (iv) no interference with FVIII function. An alternative, although complementary approach, makes use of peptides derived from filamentous-phage random libraries. Mimotopes of FVIII can be obtained, which bind to the paratope of inhibitory activity and neutralize their activity both in vitro and in vivo. In this paper, we review advanced genetic strategies for haemophilia therapy. Until recently the traditional concept for gene transfer of inherited and acquired haematological diseases has been focused on how best to obtain stable insertion of a cDNA into a target-cell genome, allowing expression of a therapeutic protein. However, as gene-transfer vector systems continue to improve, the requirement for regulated gene transcription and hence regulated protein expression will become more critical. Inappropriate protein expression levels or expression of transferred cDNAs in non-intended cell types or tissues may lead to target-cell toxicity or activation of unwanted host immune responses. Regulated protein expression requires that the transferred gene be transferred with its own regulatory cassette that allows for gene transcription and translation approaching that of the normal gene in its endogenous context. New molecular techniques, in particular the use of RNA molecules, now allow for transcription of <b>corrective</b> <b>genes</b> that mimic the normal state. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|Pluripotent hematopoietic {{stem cells}} (PHSC) are rare cells capable of multilineage differentiation, {{long-term}} reconstituting activity and extensive self-renewal. Such cells are the logical targets for {{many forms of}} <b>corrective</b> <b>gene</b> therapy, but are poor targets for retroviral mediated gene transfer owing to their quiescence, as retroviral transduction requires that the target cells be cycling. To try and surmount this problem we have constructed a retroviral producer line that expresses the membrane-bound form of human stem cell factor (SCF) on its cell surface. These cells are capable, therefore, of delivering a growth signal concomitant with recombinant retroviral vector particles. In this report we describe {{the use of this}} cell line to transduce a highly quiescent population of cells isolated from adult human bone marrow using the 5 -fluorouracil (FU) resistance technique of Berardi et al. Quiescent cells selected using this technique were transduced by cocultivation with retroviral producers expressing surface bound SCF or with the parent cell line that does not. Following coculture, the cells were plated in long-term bone marrow culture for a further 5 weeks, before plating the nonadherent cells in semisolid media. Colonies forming in the semisolid media over the next 14 days were analyzed by polymerase chain reaction for the presence of the retroviral vector genome. Over six experiments, the transduction frequency of the quiescent 5 -FU resistant cells using the SCF-expressing producer line averaged about 20 %, whereas those transduced using the parent producer line showed evidence of reduced levels or no transduction...|$|E
40|$|Fabry {{disease is}} an X-linked {{metabolic}} disorder {{due to a}} deficiency of alpha-galactosidase A (alpha-gal A; EC 3. 2. 1. 22). Patients accumulate glycosphingolipids with terminal alpha-galactosyl residues that come from intracellular synthesis, circulating metabolites, or from the biodegradation Of senescent cells. Patients eventually succumb to renal, cardio-, or cerebrovascular disease. No specific therapy exists. One possible approach to ameliorating this disorder is to target <b>corrective</b> <b>gene</b> transfer therapy to circulating hematopoietic cells. Toward this end, an amphotropic virus-producer cell line has been developed that produces a high titer (> 10 (6) i. p. per ml) recombinant retrovirus constructed to transduce and correct target cells. Virus-producer cells also demonstrate expression of large amounts of both intracellular and secreted alpha-gal A. To examine the utility of this therapeutic vector, skin fibroblasts from Fabry patients were corrected for the metabolic defect by infection with this recombinant virus and secreted enzyme was observed. Furthermore, the secreted enzyme {{was found to be}} taken up by uncorrected cells in a mannose- 6 -phosphate receptor-dependent manner. In related experiments, immortalized B cell lines from Fabry patients, created as a hematologic delivery test system, were transduced. As with the fibroblasts, transduced patient B cell lines demonstrated both endogenous enzyme correction and a small amount of secretion together with uptake by uncorrected cells. These studies demonstrate that endogenous metabolic correction in transduced cells, combined with secretion, may provide a continuous source of corrective material in trans to unmodified patient bystander cells (metabolic cooperativity) ...|$|E
40|$|The adeno-associated viruses (AAVs) can {{package and}} deliver foreign DNA into cells for <b>corrective</b> <b>gene</b> {{delivery}} applications. The AAV serotypes have distinct cell binding, transduction, and antigenic characteristics {{that have been}} shown to be dictated by the capsid viral protein (VP) sequence. To understand the contribution of capsid structure to these properties, we have determined the crystal structure of AAV serotype 4 (AAV 4), one of the most diverse serotypes with respect to capsid protein sequence and antigenic reactivity. Structural comparison of AAV 4 to AAV 2 shows conservation of the core � strands (�B to�I) and helical (�A) secondary structure elements, which also exist in all other known parvovirus structures. However, surface loop variations (I to IX), some containing compensating structural insertions and deletions in adjacent regions, result in local topological differences on the capsid surface. These include AAV 4 having a deeper twofold depression, wider and rounder protrusions surrounding the threefold axes, and a different topology at the top of the fivefold channel from that of AAV 2. Also, the previously observed “valleys ” between the threefold protrusions, containing AAV 2 ’s heparin binding residues, are narrower in AAV 4. The observed differences in loop topologies at subunit interfaces are consistent with the inability of AAV 2 and AAV 4 VPs to combine for mosaic capsid formation in efforts to engineer novel tropisms.

40|$|The {{recombinant}} Adeno-associated virus (rAAV) {{gene delivery}} system is entering a crucial and exciting phase {{with the promise}} of more than 20 years of intense research now realized in a number of successful human clinical trials. However, as a natural host to AAV infection, anti-AAV antibodies are prevalent in the human population. For example, ~ 70 % of human sera samples are positive for AAV serotype 2 (AAV 2). Furthermore, low levels of pre-existing neutralizing antibodies in the circulation are detrimental to the efficacy of <b>corrective</b> therapeutic AAV <b>gene</b> delivery. A key component to overcoming this obstacle is the identification of regions of the AAV capsid that participate in interactions with host immunity, especially neutralizing antibodies, to be modified for neutralization escape. Three main approaches have been utilized to map antigenic epitopes on AAV capsids. The first is directed evolution in which AAV variants are selected in the presence of monoclonal antibodies or pooled human sera. This results in AAV variants with mutations on important neutralizing epitopes. The second is epitope searching, achieved by peptide scanning, peptide insertion or site-directed mutagenesis. The third, a structure biology-based approach, utilizes cryo-electron microscopy and image reconstruction of AAV capsids complexed to fragment antibodies, which are generated from monoclonal antibodies, to directly visualize the epitopes.

40|$|PURPOSE. Achromatopsia (ACHM) is a {{congenital}} {{autosomal recessive}} cone disorder with a presumed stationary nature {{and only a}} few causative genes. Animal studies suggest that ACHM may be a good candidate for <b>corrective</b> <b>gene</b> therapy. Future implementation of this therapy in humans requires the presence of viable cone cells in the retina. In this study the presence of cone cells in ACHM was determined, as a function of age. METHODS. The appearance and thickness of all retinal layers were evaluated by spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) in 40 ACHM patients (age range, 4 - 70 years) with known mutations in the CNGB 3, CNGA 3, and PDE 6 C genes. A comparison was made with 55 healthy age-matched control subjects. RESULTS. The initial feature of cone cell decay was loss of inner and outer segments with disruption of the ciliary layer on OCT, which was observed as early as 8 years of age. Cone cell loss further progressed with age and occurred in 8 (42 %) of 19 patients below 30 years and in 20 (95 %) of 21 of those aged 30 + years. Retinal thickness was significantly thinner in the fovea of all patients (126 μm in ACHM vs. 225 μm in the control; P < 0. 001) and correlated with age (β = 0. 065; P = 0. 011). Foveal hypoplasia was present in 24 (80 %) of 30 patients and in 1 of 55 control subjects. CONCLUSIONS. ACHM is not a stationary disease. The first signs of cone cell loss occur in early childhood.

Nevertheless, mutation correction frequencies varying between 0. 0001 % and 40 % have been reported using chimeraplasty, oligoplasty, triplex-forming oligonucleotides, and small corrective PCR amplicons. We have investigated potential mechanisms that impede effective gene correction and potential methods by which to improve the efficiency of dystrophin gene mutation correction in the mdx mouse model of Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD). Arrest of cell cycle using Hydroxyurea and double Thymidine blockade significantly improved TCGC frequency in mdx myoblasts at the gene level, but it was clearly evident that transfection reagents rendered TCGC efficiency variable with some, albeit limited expression of the corrected loci. The latter aspect was investigated by adjustment of transfection conditions, resulting in more robust gene correction with better (but still variable) expression of the corrected locus in a proportion of the treated cells, but still affected by the toxic chemistries used to mediate improved gene correction. These studies report new methods and strategies for improvement of TCGC by cell cycle arrest using molecular methods less toxic than transfection reagents or chemical cell cycle inhibitors: Molecular technologies such as PNA chemistry, advanced electromaterials, and CNA motifs that present lesional signals to the DNA metabolic machinery are potential technologies that may impart levels of efficiency that translate more efficiently from gene to protein levels and more readily facilitate consideration towards clinical application...|$|E

Numerous reports supported {{the ability of}} these vectors to confer long-term gene expression in slowly dividing cell types for potentially <b>corrective</b> <b>gene</b> expression. These reports also highlighted additional applications of these vectors as delivery platforms for alternate integrative pathways, suicide gene therapy and vaccines. Nevertheless, in cell culture systems the transgene expression duration of IDLVs is highly transient, because of the rapid cell turnover, limiting their use to non-dividing or slowly dividing cells. The instability of the IDLVs in proliferating cells is mainly {{due to the lack}} of an origin of replication allowing vector’s DNA replication. In a work by Vargas et al. (2008), it has been demonstrated that if the transgene cassette carries a viral ORI, IDLV’s transgene expression persists if the necessary trans protein is supplied. In the work described in this thesis we have engineered IDLVs to selectively transduce EBNA 1 -expressing cells by incorporating the EBV oriP into the IDLV genome. Exploitation of EBNA 1 to maintain DNA that contains the oriP has obvious use for gene therapy. Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) is widely associated with disease in both immunocompromised and immunocompetent hosts and has been implicated in approximately 1 % of tumors worldwide. Current therapies are poorly effective and often toxic, therefore, the development of an effective, tumor-specific treatment is of high priority. The goal of IDLV-mediated suicide gene therapy of EBV-driven diseases would be to eliminate B cells that are latently infected with EBV using an IDLV that contains the EBV elements required for EBNA 1 -induced episome retention and transcriptional up-regulation.

It is a diverse group of conditions that results from mutations in any one of over 100 different genes. Many of the genes have now been identified and their functions elucidated, providing a major impetus to develop gene-based treatments. Whilst gene replacement and gene silencing strategies offer prospects for the treatment of specific inherited retinal disorders, other disorders may be less amenable to these corrective approaches. These conditions include, in particular, those associated with abnormal retinal development and those in which {{retinal degeneration}} is advanced at birth. Furthermore, the development of individualized <b>corrective</b> <b>gene</b> therapy strategies for patients with disorders due to very rare mutations may be unfeasible. However, generic gene therapy strategies that aim not to correct the gene defect but to ameliorate its consequences offer the possibility of therapies that are widely applicable across a range of conditions. One potential strategy in these cases is to halt or delay the process of cell death, so that useful visual function can be maintained throughout the lifetime of an affected individual. It has been shown in variety of experimental models over the last three decades, that neurotrophic factors have the potential to delay neuronal apoptosis. Neurotrophic factors are small proteins which have relatively short half lives and a requirement for repeated administration has limited their clinical application. Since these proteins do not ordinarily cross the blood-brain barrier, previous approaches have relied upon intrathecal infusion pumps or similar complex devices to sustain elevated neurotrophin levels within the central nervous system (CNS). However, sustained delivery through viral vector mediated expression of genes encoding neurotrophic factors may circumvent the potential side effects of repeated administration.

Critical questions {{for the development of}} gene transfer strategies for CF airway disease are what airway regions require CFTR function and how many epithelial cells require CFTR expression to restore normal ASL volume regulation and mucus transport to CF airway epithelium? An in vitro model of human CF ciliated surface airway epithelium (CF HAE) was used to test whether a human parainfluenza virus (PIV) vector engineered to express CFTR (PIVCFTR) could deliver sufficient CFTR to CF HAE to restore mucus transport, thus correcting the CF phenotype. PIVCFTR delivered CFTR to > 60 % of airway surface epithelial cells and expressed CFTR protein in CF HAE approximately 100 -fold over endogenous levels in non-CF HAE. This efficiency of CFTR delivery fully corrected the basic bioelectric defects of Cl(-) and Na(+) epithelial ion transport and restored ASL volume regulation and mucus transport to levels approaching those of non-CF HAE. To determine the numbers of CF HAE surface epithelial cells required to express CFTR for restoration of mucus transport to normal levels, different amounts of PIVCFTR were used to express CFTR in 3 %- 65 % of the surface epithelial cells of CF HAE and correlated to increasing ASL volumes and mucus transport rates. These data demonstrate for the first time, to our knowledge, that restoration of normal mucus transport rates in CF HAE was achieved after CFTR delivery to 25 % of surface epithelial cells. In vivo experimentation in appropriate models will be required to determine what level of mucus transport will afford clinical benefit to CF patients, but we predict that a future goal for <b>corrective</b> <b>gene</b> transfer to the CF human airways in vivo would attempt to target at least 25 % of surface epithelial cells to achieve mucus transport rates comparable to those in non-CF airways...|$|E
