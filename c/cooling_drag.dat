50|$|Grumman's {{engineers}} {{felt that}} the AA-5 design had more speed potential than the original Traveler, even with its 1975 improvements, and so embarked on an aerodynamic cleanup and redesign. Changes {{were made to the}} engine cowling and baffling to reduce <b>cooling</b> <b>drag,</b> the exhaust system was redesigned, the main landing gear fairings were further improved, the ventral fin was deleted and the horizontal tail was enlarged to allow a larger center of gravity range. Fuel capacity was increased from the Traveler's 37 US gallons to 52 gallons, thus increasing its range.|$|E
50|$|An {{aircraft}} radiator {{contained in}} a duct heats the air passing through, causing the air to expand and gain velocity. This is called the Meredith effect, and high-performance piston aircraft with well-designed low-drag radiators (notably the P-51 Mustang) derive thrust from it. The thrust was significant enough to offset the drag of the duct the radiator was enclosed in and allowed the aircraft to achieve zero <b>cooling</b> <b>drag.</b> At one point, there were even plans to equip the Spitfire with an afterburner, by injecting fuel into the exhaust duct after the radiator and igniting it. Afterburning is achieved by injecting additional fuel into the engine downstream of the main combustion cycle.|$|E
5000|$|The Rainbow {{featured}} a wing of straight taper with squared tips and high aspect ratio for maximum efficiency. The engines {{featured a}} sliding cowl arrangement to facilitate cooling airflow {{instead of the}} normal cowl flaps, which caused too much drag. At {{the front of the}} cowls, the engines were also fitted with a two-stage [...] "impeller fan" [...] directly behind the propeller hub and prop spinner. This allowed the engines to be tightly cowled for aerodynamic efficiency, but still provide the cooling airflow the engines required. When the sliding cowl ring was closed (during flight), the air used for cooling the engine was ducted through the nacelle to the rear exhaust orifice for a net thrust gain, as opposed to the usual <b>cooling</b> <b>drag</b> penalty.|$|E

5000|$|The other feature {{was a new}} cooling {{arrangement}} (aft positioned, single ducted {{water and}} oil radiators assembly) that reduced the <b>cooling</b> <b>drag.</b> It was later [...] discovered that, after lot of development, the cooling assembly {{could take advantage of}} the [...] "Meredith Effect", in which heated air exited the radiator with a slight amount of jet thrust. Because NAA lacked a suitable wind tunnel to test this feature, it used the GALCIT 10 ft wind tunnel at the California Institute of Technology. This led to some controversy over whether the Mustang's cooling system aerodynamics were developed by NAA's engineer Edgar Schmued or by Curtiss, although NAA had purchased the complete set of P-40 and XP-46 wind tunnel data and flight test reports for US$56,000. The NA-73X {{was also one of the}} first aircraft to have a fuselage lofted mathematically using conic sections; this resulted in smooth, low drag surfaces. To aid production, the airframe was divided into five main sections—forward, center, rear fuselage and two wing halves—all of which were fitted with wiring and piping before being joined.|$|E

40|$|The {{interactions}} between water droplets and fire plume in a two compartmental enclosure connected to tall shaft are numerically investigated. The <b>cooling</b> and <b>drag</b> effects of water particles on thermal plume characteristics are analyzed under natural and forced ventilation conditions. Numerical study is performed by Large Eddy Simulation (LES) using Fire Dynamic Simulator (FDS) code. The water droplets oppose the smoke buoyancy force {{and reduces the}} ceiling vent discharge rate. For higher sprinkler operating pressure the drag force dominates buoyancy force and stops the plume propagation through horizontal passage. The critical sprinkler operating pressure that leads to smoke logging is identified. The horizontal vent mass flow rate decreases linearly with water spray discharge rate. The forced air stream supplied at low velocity assists buoyancy force and eliminates smoke logging. However, higher ventilation velocities intensify cooling effect by increasing the {{interactions between}} water droplets and thermal plume. The model employed has been validated with the existing experimental results available in the literature...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: A {{mathematical}} {{model has been}} developed to investigate {{the effect of a}} sprinkler spray on adjacent horizontal smoke venting and in particular the water droplet drag component. The pressure difference across a roof vent and the volumetric flow of smoke vented are determined by considering the interaction between the drag force of the sprinkler spray and the buoyancy of the smoke layer in the spray region. Smoke venting may become progressively more inefficient as the sprinkler operating pressure increases due to the <b>cooling</b> and <b>drag</b> effect of the sprinkler spray. Full scale experiments were carried out to validate the model. Results show that the {{mathematical model}} can predict the observed trend of a decrease in vented volumetric flow with an increase in sprinkler operating pressure, which eventually leads to ineffective smoke venting. Experiments with different smoke venting areas show that vent area has little influence on smoke flow once sprinkler pressure causes a loss in smoke flow efficiency or vent function.

40|$|A {{mathematical}} model {{was developed for}} predicting the downward descending behavior of the buoyant smoke layer under sprinkler spray. The behavior of the smoke layer was determined by considering {{the interaction between the}} drag force of the sprinkler spray and the buoyancy force of the hot smoke layer itself in the spray region.

40|$|As {{the target}} figures for CO 2 {{emissions}} are reduced every year, vehicle manufacturers seek to exploit all possible {{gains in the}} different vehicle attributes. Aerodynamic drag {{is an important factor}} that affects the vehicle’s fuel consumption, and its importance rises with the shift from the New European Driving Cycle to the Worldwide harmonized Light vehicles Test Cycle which has a higher average speed. In order to reduce vehicle drag, car manufacturers employ the use of grill/spoiler shutters which reduces the amount of air going through the vehicle’s cooling system, also known as cooling flow, thus reducing both its cooling capability and the resultant <b>cooling</b> <b>drag.</b> This paper investigates the influence of different grill blockages on the cooling flow through the radiator of a Volvo S 60. By modifying the engine bay and radiator, load cells are used to measure the force acting on the radiator core while the velocity distribution across the radiator core is measured using pressure probes. These values are analyzed and compared to different vehicle configurations and grill inlet designs. A number of test configurations are reproduced in Computational Fluid Dynamics simulations and compared to the test results. For some grill configurations, the simulations provide a good prediction of mass flow and velocity distribution; however a clear discrepancy is present as the grill blockages increase. On the other hand, the force acting on the radiator core was well predicted for all configurations. This paper discusses the different parameters affecting cooling flow predictions such as wind tunnel blockage and measurement grid discretization by comparing radiator forces and mass flows. In addition, the changes on overall vehicle forces are discussed with the radiator force put in context with <b>cooling</b> <b>drag...</b>|$|E
