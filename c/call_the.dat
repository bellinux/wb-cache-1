5|$|Dig Me Out is the {{follow-up}} to Sleater-Kinney's highly acclaimed second album <b>Call</b> <b>the</b> Doctor, released in 1996 by the queercore independent record label Chainsaw Records. <b>Call</b> <b>the</b> Doctor confirmed the band's {{reputation as one}} of the major musical acts from the Pacific Northwest, rebelling against gender roles, consumerism, and indie rock's male-dominated hierarchy. After the release of <b>Call</b> <b>the</b> Doctor, drummer Janet Weiss of Quasi joined the band. Previously, the band had had a number of temporary drummers, including Misty Farrell, Lora Macfarlane, and Toni Gogin. Weiss would eventually become Sleater-Kinney's longest serving and current drummer. For its third album, Sleater-Kinney worked again with producer John Goodmanson. The band left Chainsaw Records and decided to release the album through Kill Rock Stars, another independent record label which singer and guitarist Corin Tucker thought had better resources to ensure the band's distribution. Goodmanson also remarked that Kill Rock Stars afforded the band a generous amount of studio time for an independent label, stating that <b>Call</b> <b>the</b> Doctor only took four days to record while Dig Me Out was recorded over the period of eight days.|$|E

5|$|Governor-General Kerr was {{following}} the crisis closely.
