Our results reveal that chains are prevalent in information workers and that attributes such as the number of links, the rate of media and organizational switching can be predicted from the first catalyzing link of the chain. When chains are triggered by external interruptions, they have more links, a trend for more media switches and more organizational switches. We also found that more switching of organizational contexts in communication is associated with higher levels of stress.

50|$|There are twenty-five agencies, under seven {{ministries}} {{that are}} involved in maintaining water quality, yet their communication and data sharing between agencies is underdeveloped.Water user associations which are non-governmental associations of farmers who organize an irrigation process of all agricultural land, maintain diesel pumps and deal with conflicts between farmers and water management. They have been around since 1988, but have lacked structure and the inclusion of women. Women are seen as contributors to pollution of irrigation canals since they wash clothes, dishes and animals in the drainages. The lack of planning and corruption within governmental departments, the neglecting of concerns and disbursement of low-quality land to the poor, and the improper education of safe handling methods and improper irrigation and crop management for men and women, all contribute to poor water quality. Though money is a major factor in improving these areas, in the case of erasing corruption and improving interdepartmental communication, stricter rules and enforcement of them is something that can be done immediately. Increasing Water User Associations (WUAs) and establishing a <b>communication</b> <b>chain</b> between these associations and government departments is recommended. Appointing field supervisors for designated areas to oversee WUAs and educate farmers on irrigation methods (like drip irrigation that applies water to the root zone which can reduce water use by 30 to 60 percent), effective water distribution during crop cycle, crop rotation and soil management. Field supervisors can also monitor water levels, check on the maintenance of pumps and report on drainage structures.The World Bank has financed the agricultural drainage program in Egypt since 1970. This program equips agricultural land with subsurface drains. These drains are made of plastic pipes produced in government-owned plants in the Nile Valley and Delta. Landholders pay for the installation of drains on a 20-year interest-free annual installments. Subsurface drainage has shown to improve soil conditions and crop yield. Educating farmers on the functioning of these subsurface drainages are needed to prevent a disruption of water supply to all connected fields. Since these drainages cannot be seen on the surface, if a farmer closes a drain to keep more water in his field it will prevent water from reaching users beyond.|$|E
40|$|Increase in {{lead time}} of {{software}} projects has been mainly attributed to long development cycles {{and changes in}} customer requirements. This has driven {{the development of a}} number of modern software development strategies to address the issue. Among them is streamline development - an in-house development framework at Ericsson AB inspired by lean principles. In this paper we explore the development life cycle of a feature to identify the possible bottlenecks - a term used in lean development denoting interruptions, re-work or any activities that hinder the development process hence an increase in lead time. This paper is based on a case study carried out at one of the development unit at Ericsson AB. The results presented here are after a qualitative interview study with one cross function team using streamline development framework. Using lean as a theoretical base, the results show that: task switching, competence, delayed replies and feedbacks, limited follow ups of evaluations, long <b>communication</b> <b>chains,</b> limited knowledge on the feature usage, unclear understanding of the development process, and lack of documents describing the architecture for the team are some of the possible bottlenecks that can increase the lead time of a software project...|$|R
40|$|Our work {{is focused}} on the {{investigation}} of an influence of an additive thermal noise and a multiplicative phase noise in space <b>communication</b> <b>chains.</b> The most important properties of both noise types are summarized. The main concern of this paper is on the multiplicative phase noise that is especially important in systems with the phase shift keying. The simulation procedure for modeling of a signal degraded by the multiplicative phase noise is described. One starts from the frequency domain, where noise properties are set up. Five basic phase noise types can be included. After a passing to the time domain, the final noisy signal is obtained. To prove the modeling correctness, two ways are used. Firstly, Allan variances are utilized as a time domain processing. Finally, for a comparison, the direct conversion formula from the frequency to the time domain is exploited. Created signal corrupted by the phase noise expresses the harmonic oscillator output signal. A pair of these oscillators, disturbed by different phase noise processes, is installed into a communication channel model and with its help, the simultaneous influence of both oscillators on the useful signal is examined. Results show a good coincidence with theoretical presumptions...|$|R

Due to the growing importance of network centric capabilities in military operations, {{one of the main}} focus points for the development of ITSimBw is the faithful modelling of IT and communication aspects. This goal is achieved essentially by two means: 1. A message format for simulated communication acts between agents is provided which allows the detailed specification of communication channel, medium, and range. 2. A voxel-space representation is used to model the extension of all objects belonging to the simulated environment. This allows for the application of high performance ray tracing algorithms to precisely determine the impact of effects like radio-pockets (e. g. caused by mountains) as well as jamming by opposing forces. These two features in conjunction allow for a detailed and realistic modeling of <b>communication</b> <b>chains</b> for reporting and command both inside and across different echelons.

40|$|Abstract—Electronic {{chaining}} is the formation, and maintenance, of a linked <b>communication</b> <b>chain</b> that maximizes the endto-end throughput using {{a cooperative}} team of mobile robotic relays. For this paper, an optimal <b>communication</b> <b>chain</b> is defined using the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) {{of the communication}} links along the chain. By using the SNR of the individual communication channels, instead of relative position, an optimal <b>communication</b> <b>chain</b> of robotic relays is formed that is {{able to respond to}} changes in, and unexpected features of, the RF environment that is simply not possible with position based chaining solutions. Since the operating environment is generally not known a priori to deployment of a robotic sensor network, an adaptive model-free extremum seeking (ES) algorithm is presented to control the motion of 2 D nonholonomic vehicles acting as communication relays. Even without specific knowledge of the SNR field, the ES algorithm is able to drive the team of vehicles to optimal locations with only local measures of the SNR. A specific application using unmanned aircraft is simulated to highlight the fact that the performance of the ES chaining algorithm is limited due to the performance constraints and capabilities of the individual vehicles within the chain.

40|$|The {{advancement}} of wireless communication technology has {{made possible the}} consideration of inter-vehicle communication {{as a foundation for}} developing decentralized advanced transportation information systems that would function as a sort of "internet on the road". In this paper, we discuss the reliability of inter-vehicle communication in a traffic stream, dependent on the distribution of equipped vehicles. With the assumption that information propagation is instantaneous compared to vehicle movements, the reliability is measured by the probability of success for information to travel beyond a location; stochastic models are presented for both uniform and general traffic streams. In the models, the traffic stream is divided into a series of cells based on the transmission range, the structure of possible most-forward-within-range <b>communication</b> <b>chains</b> is clarified, the probabilities for information to travel to and beyond a vehicle at a certain hop are computed regressively, and the lower bound of the absolute success rate for information to travel beyond a point is determined. Based on the models, we examine the performance of information propagation for different penetration rates, transmission ranges, and traffic scenarios that include gaps and shock waves. Finally, some implications and future extensions of this effort are discussed. ...|$|R

On the other hand, following <b>communication</b> <b>chains</b> in a precise and quantifiable way is a daunting task for both the researcher and the respondent. The methodology proposed in this study offers a practical middle ground between no data and perfect data on causal linkages. Specifically, for a given Internet activity, we simply ask the respondent to identify its causal antecedent and its likely communication consequences, by checking off the appropriate responses from a list. Obviously, by sacrificing precision and detail we lose the ability to quantify those consequences (e. g., in terms of miles of travel generated or substituted). However, we argue that the qualitative view of causal chains provided by this approach can offer valuable insights not possible from single cross-sectional studies alone. We analyze the relative strengths of effects of a given Internet activity in three ways. Using a 1994 sample of 148 early Internet adopters to illustrate the application of the methodology, we first tabulate the total presence, within the sample, of specific types of effects, to assess the net effect of Internet activities on other communication media. Second, we tabulate the frequency with which specific combinations of effects, or “pattern vectors,” occur in the sample. Finally, we use cluster analysis to identify latent types of <b>communication</b> <b>chains</b> having relatively similar causal relationships between Internet activities and other media. To establish a theoretical background and context for this study, we briefly summarize the relevant literature and develop a conceptual framework for understanding interactions among communications media. After introducing the survey instrument and methods of analysis, we apply the proposed methodology and discuss key empirical findings...|$|R
