50|$|For {{conspicuous}} gallantry and intrepidity {{in action}} {{at the risk of}} his life above and {{beyond the call of duty}}. Pfc. Lee distinguished himself near the city of Phu Bai in the province of Thua Thien. Pfc. Lee was serving as the radio telephone operator with the 3d platoon, Company B. As lead element for the company, the 3d platoon received intense surprise hostile fire from a force of North Vietnamese Army regulars in well-concealed bunkers. With 50 percent casualties, the platoon maneuvered to a position of cover to treat their wounded and reorganize, while Pfc. Lee moved through the heavy enemy fire giving lifesaving first aid to his wounded comrades. During the subsequent assault on the enemy defensive positions, Pfc. Lee continuously kept close radio contact with the company commander, relaying precise and understandable orders to his platoon leader. While advancing with the front rank toward the objective, Pfc. Lee observed 4 North Vietnamese soldiers with automatic weapons and a rocket launcher lying in wait for the lead element of the platoon. As the element moved forward, unaware of the <b>concealed</b> <b>danger,</b> Pfc. Lee immediately and with utter disregard for his own personal safety, passed his radio to another soldier and charged through the murderous fire. Without hesitation he continued his assault, overrunning the enemy position, killing all occupants and capturing 4 automatic weapons and a rocket launcher. Pfc. Lee continued his 1-man assault on the second position through a heavy barrage of enemy automatic weapons fire. Grievously wounded, he continued to press the attack, crawling forward into a firing position and delivering accurate covering fire to enable his platoon to maneuver and destroy the position. Not until the position was overrun did Pfc. Lee falter in his steady volume of fire and succumb to his wounds. Pfc. Lee's heroic actions saved the lives of the lead element and were instrumental in the destruction of the key position of the enemy defense. Pfc. Lee's gallantry at the risk of life above and beyond the call of duty are in keeping with the highest traditions of the military service and reflect great credit on himself, the 502d Infantry, and the U.S. Army.|$|E

40|$|We {{know very}} little about the ecology of our {{designed}} world. Contrary to all appearances, design is not about making objects. It is rather about structuring the conditions for life. Design is our second nature, naturalising changes in our ways of living. Yet it also <b>conceals</b> <b>dangers</b> and diminishes our sensitivity to respond to them. The security offered by the televisual image — and the solace of design's promise to remove all environmental risks — are fictions. Ecology of the Image is a critical exploration of idealism in design. Drawing on hermeneutic phenomenology, socio-cultural and design theory, it argues that design is not a value-free practice but structures epistemological attitudes into the world. Ideas are material elements of our environments. This thesis offers an explanation of how idealism circulates within the designed world, fashioning our minds, bodies and environments. The televisual is analysed as a normative phenomenon that inducts us into a way of seeing and understanding the world. Its vision of the affluent good life inspires and gives purpose to desire, and sustains what Manzini has called 'product based well being'. The thesis argues that the televisual puts us {{out of touch with the}} consequences of its vision; it diminishes our capacity for forethought. This results in the generation of unacknowledged, yet self-endangering environmental feedback. Environmental problems force us to take account of design's hidden rationales. Only at five minutes to midnight, for example, do we realise that the stock and supply of potable water is endangered. The problem is not so much this late recognition, but that design led us to believe in water's abundance. This situation demands the development of an ecological understanding of our designed worlds that can inform future actions. The sign, particularly as it has been mobilised in cultural theory, plays a leading role in this design situation and the perceptions it supports. The sign is utilised for its ability to denaturalise appearances — to 'read' design's claims on the world. Finally, the thesis turns to the designer-in-training in the process of acquiring instrumental skills and worldviews. It proposes a research strategy that inscribes environmental consciousness into the design process — situating the designer in the midst of semiotic and material worlds. Through its observational methodology it outlines ways of first understanding, then of intervening and generating changes in our 'ideal' world...|$|R

40|$|The {{design of}} the LHC and future {{colliders}} aims their operation with high intensity beams, with bunch population, N_p, {{of the order of}} 10 ^ 11. This is dictated by a desire to study very rare processes with maximum data sample. HEP colliders are engineering structures of many kilometers in length, whose transverse compactness is achieved by the application of the superconducting technologies and limitations of cost. However the compactness of the structural elements <b>conceals</b> and potential <b>danger</b> for the stable work of the accelerator. This is because a high intensity beam of positively charged particles (protons, positrons, ions) creates around itself an electric self-field of very high intensity, 10 ^ 5 - 10 ^ 6 V/cm. Being located near the conducting surfaces, at the distances of 1 - 20 mm away from them, the field of such bunches activates the field emission of electrons from the surface. These electrons, in addition to electrons from the ionization of residual gases, secondary electrons and electrons knocked out by synchrotron radiation, {{contribute to the development of}} a dense electron cloud in the transport line. The particles of the bunch, being scattered on the dense electron cloud with N_e∼ N_p, leaves the beam and may cause noticeable damage. The paper presents an analysis of the conditions, under which the field emission in the LHC collimator system may become a serious problem. The analogous analysis of a prototype of the International Linear Collider (ILC) project, USLC, reveals that a noticeable field emission will accompany positron bunches on their entire path during acceleration.

40|$|Adult education’, ‘adult learning’ and ‘lifelong learning’ are terms {{which are}} popular in public {{discourse}} today. Indeed they are carriers of notions which sound pleasant to the ear, and which easily garner widespread approval. Who is, after all, not {{in favour of}} a society which creates possibilities of learning for adults, which makes education readily accessible beyond compulsory schooling and which portrays it as a lifelong process? The popularisation of these terms, and of the notions they carry, while conducive to consciousness-raising and not negative per se, does <b>conceal</b> some <b>dangers.</b> One of these is when adult education is viewed exclusively as an instrumental tool, possibly also marketed as a product, {{and not as a}} means to improve one’s quality of life, to form reflective citizens and to lead to even further opportunities for learning. The study by Faculty of Education colleagues Carmel Borg, Peter Mayo and Milosh Raykov provides insights into the ‘state of the art’ of adult learning in Malta and presents comparisons with several countries worldwide, especially those in the EU. Numerous thought-provoking considerations emerge from the data provided, also in relation to the trends of early-school leaving in Malta. While it is indeed positive to see a number of encouraging patterns, including the participation in education-related activities in adult life, the study clearly shows that much is yet to be achieved locally, especially when taking into consideration variables such as gender and socio-economic status. Borg, Mayo & Raykov’s study also has the merit of providing indications of how one can be pro-active in this sector. It illustrates how locally in adult learning there is an interest in foreign languages and specialized subjects, such as science, in addition to basic and job-specific skills. Other transferable skills, such as problem-solving and working with others, are also viewed as important thereby hinting that, even locally, there is the need for the sector to develop widely, in consonance with the concept of lifewide, besides lifelong, education. Furthermore, through the pilot study which complements the comparative data of their research, the authors highlight the fact that participants mention that they learn from Internet-mediated audiovisual sources, beside television and radio. These data are discussed in what, {{at the beginning of the}} study, is defined as the ‘dangers of an overly economistic rendering’, thereby underlining that a balance is to be found between the demands of employment and the development of reflective and critical skills in learners. The latter is particularly important locally, especially in relation to what is often transmitted through the means of communication mentioned above. This study is perfectly in line with the vision that the Faculty of Education has developed recently, summarised by our goal: Promoting an Educated Public in a Participatory Democracy. The recent restructuring of the faculty aims, in fact, to move beyond the faculty’s trademark Initial Teacher Education endeavours, of which it is proud, and engage more directly with the community it serves. This restructuring has led to the creation of the Department of Arts, Open Communities and Adult Education, one of the goals of which is precisely to research and tackle issues related to adult learning locally, as described in Borg, Mayo & Raykov’s study. In conclusion, besides stressing the merits of this work as another milestone in the extensive body of research that the Faculty of Education has produced over the years, I feel that it provides an opportunity for those who are not necessarily experts in the field to obtain a concise and comprehensible picture of Adult Education in Malta and elsewhere today, supplemented by clear indications of where action needs to be taken. peer-reviewe...|$|R

Suggestions are made for preventative measures to avoid or minimise environmental damage and remedial measures to deal with accidental high contamination. Guidance is given on assessing the tolerability or unacceptability of side-effects and control methods. The handbook incorporates experience gained elsewhere in Africa and much of the content is widely relevant to development programmes other than those for trypanosomiasis control. This publication has been produced by CTA and the Scientific Environmental Monitoring Group Project of the Regional Tsetse and Trypanosomiasis Control Programme (Malawi, Mozambique, Zambia, Zimbabwe) which is funded by the European Development Fund. Environmental monitoring handbook for tsetse control operations by Peter Nagel ISBN 3 8236 1249 2 published by Margraf Verlag and available from CTA Pesticides in tropical agriculture focuses on the risks involved in the use of pesticides, which are often referred to as 'plant protection' products - a term which tends to <b>conceal</b> the potential <b>dangers</b> of the products if not handled and used correctly. The book gives practical suggestions on how to communicate the hazards involved in pesticide use, as well as how to minimize them. There is a chapter on modes of poisoning, symptoms and treatment and also a chapter on alternatives to chemical plant protection.
