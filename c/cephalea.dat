To analyze the convenience of specific neurology shifts or {{the role that the}} neurologist should play in the emergency department, it is necessary to answer questions such as: What is the demand for emergency neurological care? What are the most frequent neurological emergencies? Who should attend to neurological emergencies and why? Are specific neurology shifts necessary? Neurological emergencies account for between 2. 6 % and 14 % of medical emergencies. Stroke represents a third of all neurological emergencies, while the diagnoses of acute cerebrovascular disease, epilepsy and <b>cephalea</b> constitute 50 % of all neurological care in the emergency department. On the basis of quality of care criteria and professional competence, the best care for patients with a neurological emergency is provided by a specialist in neurology.

40|$|Abstract: Rationale and aim: Nasal {{congestion}} is {{a common}} symptom in allergic and non-allergic rhinitis, rhinosinusitis and nasal polyposis. Although various pharmacotherapy options exist, no agent is universally efficacious. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the clinical effectiveness efficacy of Narivent®, which is an osmotically acting medical device with anti-oedematous and anti-inflammatory effects, in a long-term (30 days) treatment. Methods: A single-centre prospective study with a pre-post design was conducted with consecutive enrolment in an Italian Otolaryngology Department of 56 both genders patients with persistent nasal congestion. Patients received 2 puffs of Narivent ® into each nostril 2 times a day over the course of 4 weeks. The severity of symp-toms was assessed subjectively as measured by a 0 to 10 visual analogue scale (VAS) and the presence/absence of symp-toms and signs. Differences in subjective and objective severity measures before and after treatment were compared using Paired-Sample Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test.

Here, we would like to report the first ependymoma of this kind in a Latin American institution. A 16 -year-old boy experienced <b>cephalea</b> during three months. Magnetic resonance imaging scans showed a left paraventricular tumour which corresponded to anaplastic ependymoma. Intriguingly, it was also composed of cells with single or multiple hollow cytoplasmic vacuoles sometimes giving a signet-ring cell-like configuration. Immunolabeling of these showed membrane positivity for GFAP, PS 100, and CD 99, while Ki- 67 expression was null. Ultrastructural examination of retrieved paraffin-embedded tissue showed the presence of scarce microlumina filled with microvilli but failed to demonstrate any content in such optically empty vacuoles as only scant granulofibrillary debris was observed. A schism prevails at present regarding these unusual morphological variants, being either “lipomatous” or “vacuolated” based mainly on the EMA immunoprofile.

40|$|The {{discovery}} of the multiple physiological and pathophysiological processes in which nitric oxide (NO) is involved has promoted {{a great number of}} pharmacological researches to develop new drugs that are capable of influencing NO production directly and/or indirectly for therapeutic purposes (i. e, NO-releasing drugs, NO-inhibiting drugs, and phosphodiesterase V inhibitors). In particular, the so-called NO donor drugs could actually have an important therapeutic effect in the treatment of many diseases such as arteriopathies (atherosclerosis and its sequelae, arterial hypertension and some forms of male sexual impotence), various acute and chronic inflammatory conditions (colitis, rheumatoid arthritis and tissue remodelling), and several degenerative diseases (Alzheimer's disease and cancer). The old organic nitrates show some well-known pitfalls including the induction of tolerance and acute side effects related to abrupt vasodilation such as <b>cephalea</b> and hypotension, which limit their therapeutic indications. A low therapeutic index (i. e., peroxynitrite toxicity) has always characterised the sydnonimines class. A series of interesting new classes of NO donors are under intense pharmacological investigation and scrutiny (S-nitrosothiols, diazeniumdiolates and NO hybrid drugs), each characterised by a particular pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile.

40|$|OBJETIVO: comparar a efetividade da nitroglicerina transdérmica com a nifedipina oral na inibição do trabalho de parto prematuro. MÉTODOS: foi realizado um ensaio clínico com 50 mulheres em trabalho de parto prematuro, randomizadas em dois grupos, 24 para nifedipina oral (20 mg) e 26 para nitroglicerina transdérmica (patch 10 mg). Foram selecionadas as pacientes com gestação única, entre a 24 ª e 34 ª semanas e diagnóstico de trabalho de parto prematuro. Foram excluídas pacientes com malformações fetais e com doenças clínicas ou obstétricas. As variáveis analisadas foram tocólise efetiva, tempo necessário para tocólise, frequência de recorrência, progressão para parto prematuro e efeitos colaterais. RESULTADOS: a eficácia da tocólise nas primeiras 12 horas foi semelhante entre os grupos (nitroglicerina: 84, 6 % versus nifedipina: 87, 5 %; p= 0, 5). A média do tempo para tocólise também foi semelhante (6, 6 versus 5, 8 horas; p= 0, 3). Não houve diferença entre os grupos quanto à recorrência de parto prematuro (26, 9 versus 16, 7 %; p= 0, 3) e nem na frequência de parto prematuro dentro de 48 horas (15, 4 versus 12, 5 %; p= 0, 5). Entretanto, a frequência de cefaleia foi significativamente maior no grupo que usou nitroglicerina (30, 8 versus 8, 3 %; p= 0, 04). CONCLUSÕES: a nitroglicerina transdérmica apresentou efetividade semelhante à nifedipina oral para inibição do trabalho de parto prematuro nas primeiras 48 horas, porém com maior frequência de cefaleia. PURPOSE: {{to compare}} the {{effectiveness}} of transdermal nitroglycerin with oral nifedipine in the inhibition of preterm delivery. METHODS: a clinical essay has been performed with 50 women in preterm delivery, randomly divided into two groups, 24 receiving oral nifedipine (20 mg), and 26, transdermal nitroglycerin (10 mg patch). Patients with a single gestation, between the 24 th and the 34 th weeks and diagnosis of preterm delivery were selected. Women with fetal malformation and clinical or obstetric diseases were excluded. The variables analyzed were: effective tocolysis, time needed for tocolysis, recurrence frequency, progression to preterm delivery, and side effects. RESULTS: tocolysis efficacy in the first 12 hours was similar between the groups (nitroglycerin: 84. 6 % versus nifedipine: 87. 5 %; p= 0. 50). The time average time needed for tocolysis was also similar (6. 6 versus 5. 8 hours; p= 0. 30).

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Tako-tsubo {{cardiomyopathy}} is {{a rapidly}} reversible form of acute heart failure triggered by stressful events that occur {{more frequently in}} postmenopausal women. A central role {{is supposed to be}} played by catecholamines and the association with pheocromocytoma is rare. CASE PRESENTATION: We describe a patient admitted for abdominal pain and suffering of hypertension pharmacologically treated. During hospitalization the patient presented <b>cephalea</b> and precordial pain with nausea and profuse sweating. ECG showed ST elevation and deep negative T wave. Blood tests were moderately elevated. Echo-cardiography reported a left ventricular apex akynesia and hyperkynesia of the base while coronarography was negative. As hypertension persisted the suspicion of pheocromocytoma arose. Urinary and blood catecholamines were mildly elevated and echography and Magnetic Resonance revealed a left adrenal gland mass. The diagnosis of pheocromocytoma was thus confirmed Left laparoscopic adrenalectomy was performed after adequate stabilization and preoperative pharmacological preparation by hydration, a-and f-blockers. Intraoperatively blood pressure was controlled by nitroprussiate, rapid half life beta-blockers (esmolol cloridrate). Post-operative course was uneventful and arterial pressure returned to normal as well as catecholamines values. Patient was discharged on the 5 th post-operative day Five months afterwards the patient had normal arterial pressure without anti-hypertensive therapy and symptom free. CONCLUSION: The case confirmed that tako-tsubo cardiomyopathy could be the first manifestation of tumors secreting catecholamines and that pheocromocytoma should be considered in patients with hypertension and acute stress-induced cardiomiopathy without evidence of acute coronary disease and with negative coronarography...|$|E
40|$|Nitric oxide is {{becoming}} an increasingly important signalling molecule implicated in {{a growing number of}} physiological and pathophysiological processes. Moreover, with the recent advances in nitric oxide biochemistry, many well known drugs have been shown to act totally or partially by modulating NO metabolism with varying therapeutic results. The classic organic nitrates have been shown to exhibit beneficial therapeutic but suffer from some well known pitfalls (tolerability induction, abrupt <b>cephalea</b> and hypotension). Similarly, sydnonimines, another well known class of NO donor drugs, have a characteristically low therapeutic index (i. e., cyanide toxicity). At present, pharmacological researchers are designing and synthesising various chemical compounds capable of modulating NO metabolism for therapeutic purposes that also possess an optimal therapeutic index. Specifically, various new classes of NO donors are under intense pharmacological investigation (such as S-nitrosothiols, diazeniumdiolates, furoxans, zeolites and so on), each characterised by a particular pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile. To known the pharmacological development of these new NO donor drugs could help to ameliorate the use of these molecules in various therapeutic protocols. In fact, the pharmacologically modulated nitric oxide release showed to have an important therapeutic impact in the treatment of diseases such as arteriopathies, various acute and chronic inflammatory conditions, and several degenerative diseases. At present, the most important obstacle in the field of new NO donor drugs seems to be carefully targeting NO release to a particular tissue at an optimal concentration, so as to achieve a beneficial action and to limit possible toxic effects...|$|E
40|$|Introductions: In {{the care}} of hypertension, it is {{important}} that health professionals possess available tools that allow evaluating the impairment of the health-related quality of life, according to the severity of hypertension and the risk for cardiovascular events. Among the instruments developed for the assessment of health-related quality of life, there is the Mini-Cuestionario of Calidad de Vida en la Hipertensi&# 243;n Arterial (MINICHAL) recently adapted to the Brazilian culture. Objective: To estimate the validity of known groups of the Brazilian version of the MINICHAL regarding the classification of risk for cardiovascular events, symptoms, severity of dyspnea and target-organ damage. Methods: Data of 200 hypertensive outpatients concerning sociodemographic and clinical information and health-related quality of life were gathered by consulting the medical charts and the application of the Brazilian version of MINICHAL. The Mann-Whitney test was used to compare health-related quality of life in relation to symptoms and target-organ damage. The Kruskal-Wallis test and ANOVA with ranks transformation were used to compare health-related quality of life in relation to the classification of risk for cardiovascular events and intensity of dyspnea, respectively. Results: The MINICHAL was able to discriminate health-related quality of life in relation to symptoms and kidney damage, but did not discriminate health-related quality of life in relation to the classification of risk for cardiovascular events.

A case of parathyroid adenoma observed in a patient aged 47, admitted to the Emergency Medicine Department of our Hospital with a diagnosis of hypertensive crisis, <b>cephalea,</b> vomiting, and a clinical history of recurrent episodes of severe abdominal and renal pain, is presented. Lab data showed severe hypercalcemia and a progressive worsening of the renal function. A severe neurological involvement with stupor, derangement of mind, the arising of acute respiratory depression, lethargy compelled the colleagues to transfer him to the Intensive Care Unit; a neck ultrasonography showed a poor-echogenous area under the right thyroid inferior pole, with signs of vascularization. The suspect of a primary hyperparathyroidism related to a single adenoma of the parathyroid gland suggested a surgical treatment. A ''concise parathyroidectomy'' was performed. Our surgical approach was confirmed by the comparison of the preintervention and the post-intervention iPTH values: 2080 pg/mL (normal range: 12 - 65 pg/mL) before excision vs 101 pg/mL after the removal. The histologycal exam reported a parathyroid adenoma with large areas with haemorrage. Three days after surgery the patient was in good general conditions.

O aumento desta ou a ossificação do ligamento estilohióideo pode originar uma série de sintomas como disfagia, odinofagia, dor facial, otalgia, cefaléia, zumbido e trismo. Este conjunto de sintomas associado à presença da apófise estilóide alongada é conhecido como Síndrome de Eagle. Objetivo: Relatar um grupo de quatro pacientes com Síndrome de Eagle, bem como {{discutir}} a apresentação clínica e o tratamento mais adequado desta doença. Forma de estudo: Clínico retrospectivo. Material e método: Realizado estudo clínico retrospectivo de quatro pacientes, operados no HSPE-FMO e HSPM de São Paulo, no período de junho de 1998 a junho de 2001. O tratamento cirúrgico foi a opção terapêutica escolhida, com a retirada da apófise estilóide alongada. Foi avaliada a evolução clínica no pós-operatório. Resultados: Dos quatro pacientes, três eram do sexo feminino e um do sexo masculino, com idade variando de 38 a 68 anos e com média etária de 57, 25 anos. A apófise estilóide alongada foi encontrada e operada em ambos os lados em 50 % dos casos. Houve remissão completa dos sintomas em três pacientes, com melhora parcial no outro paciente. Conclusão: Esta doença deve ser considerada em pacientes com sintomas de disfagia, odinofagia, dor facial, otalgia, cefaléia, zumbido e trismo. O tratamento cirúrgico para pacientes que apresentam a apófise estilóide alongada com sintomas compatíveis com a Síndrome de Eagle é a melhor forma de conduzir estes casos, sendo a via de abordagem externa a que oferece mais segurança e que possibilita uma ressecção mais completa. Introduction: The styloid apophysis is an osseous outgrowth {{originating in}} the tympanum portion of the temporal bone. Its growth, or the ossification of the stylohyoid ligament, may cause a series of symptoms, such as dysphagia, odynophagia, facial pain, otalgia, <b>cephalea,</b> tinnitus and trismus. This set of symptoms associated {{to the presence of}} an elongated styloid aphophysis is known as the Eagle syndrome. Aim: To report on a group of four patients with Eagle syndrome, as well as to discuss the clinical presentation and the most suitable treatment of this disease. Study design: Clinical retrospective. Material and Method: A retrospective clinical study of four patients who were submitted to surgery at the HSPE-FMO (State Public Servants Hospital) of São Paulo, and at the HSPM (Municipal Public Servants Hospital) of the city of São Paulo, in the period from June, 1998, to June, 2001. The surgical treatment was the therapeutic option selected, with the removal of the elongated styloid aphophyses. The clinical evolution was assessed during the postoperative period. Results: Of the four patients, three were females and one a male, ages ranging from 38 to 68 years, with an average age of 57. 25 years. The elongated styloid aphophyses were found and operated in both sides in 50 % of the cases. Full remission of the symptoms occurred in three of the patients, and a partial improvement was observed in the other patient. Conclusion: This disease should be considered when the patient presents symptoms, such as dysphagia, odynophagia, facial pain, otalgia, <b>cephalea,</b> tinnitus and trismus.

40|$|ABSTRACT BACKGROUND: Infliximab and adalimumab are {{considered}} effective {{drugs in the}} management of Crohn’s disease. However, due to significant immunossupression, they can cause important adverse events, mostly infections. OBJECTIVE: The aim {{of this study was to}} quantify and describe adverse events derived from adalimumab and infliximab use in Crohn’s disease patients, and to compare the safety profile between these two agents. METHODS: This was an observational, single-center, longitudinal, retrospective study with Crohn’s disease patients under infliximab or adalimumab therapy. Variables analyzed: demographic characteristics (including the Montreal classification), type of agent used, concomitant immunomodulators, presence and types of adverse events observed. Patients were allocated in two groups (infliximab and adalimumab) and had their adverse events accessed and subsequently compared. RESULTS: A total of 130 patients were included (68 in infliximab and 62 in adalimumab groups, respectively). The groups were fully homogeneous in all baseline characteristics, with a median follow-up of 47. 21 ± 36. 52 months in the infliximab group and 47. 79 ± 35. 09 in the adalimumab group (P= 0. 512). Adverse events were found in 43 / 68 (63. 2 %) and 40 / 62 (64. 5 %) in each group, respectively (P= 0. 879).

Cerebral hemorrhage diagnosed by image was observed in 35 patients (57. 3 %). Most arteriovenous malformations (67. 2 %) were graded Spetzler III and IV. Venous stenosis (21. 3 %) and aneurysm (13. 1 %) were the most frequent angioarchitecture changes. The dose administered varied from 12 to 27. 5 Gy in {{the periphery of the}} lesion. RESULTS: Out of twenty-eight patients that underwent conclusive angiography control, complete obliteration was achieved in 18 (72 %) and treatment failed in 7 (absence of occlusion with more than 3 years of follow-up). Four were submitted to a second radiosurgery, and one of these has shown obliteration after 18 months of follow-up. DISCUSSION: Several factors were analyzed regarding the occlusion rate (gender, age, volume, localization, Spetzler, flow, embolization, total of isocenters, prescribed dose and chosen isodose) and complications (total of isocenters, localization, volume, maximum dose, prescribed dose and chosen isodose). Analyzed variables showed no statistical significance for obliteration of the vessel, as well as for treatment complications. The largest diameter of the arteriovenous malformation, its volume and the dose administered did not influence time of obliteration. CONCLUSION: Radiosurgery is effective in the treatment of arteriovenous malformations and can be an alternative for patients with clinical contraindication or with lesions in eloquent areas. In the studied variables no statistically significant correlation was observed between occlusion and treatment complications...|$|E
40|$|Cryptococcal {{meningitis}} is {{the most}} common fatal central nervous system infection in AIDS patients in Sub-Saharan Africa. The purpose of this prospective study conducted from March 2003 to February 2004 in the internal medicine and infectious diseases departments of the Point G University Hospital Center was to investigate the clinical, prognostic and epidemiological profile of Cryptococcus neoformans infection in patients hospitalized for brain and meningeale infection (BMI). Diagnosis of neuromeningeal cryptococcosis (NMC) was based on positive identification of Cryptococcus by direct exam of the cebrospinal fluid (CSF) after India ink staining and/or culture on Sabouraud medium without actidione. During the study period, a total of 569 patients were hospitalized including 235 (41. 3 %) with HIV infection. Overall C. neoformans was identified in 14 patients. Median patient age was 39 ± 8 years. There was a male preponderance with a sex ratio of 1. 8 (9 men/ 5 women). Patients with BMI were HIV positive in 85. 7 % of cases (n= 12) and HIV-negative in 14. 3 % (n= 2). The overall and HIV-specific prevalence of BMI was 2. 5 % and 5. 1 % respectively. The CD 4 lymphocyte count was between 1 and 49 cells/mm 3 in 64. 3 % of cases. The main clinical symptoms were <b>cephalea</b> in 85. 7 % of cases, altered consciousness in 50 % and nausea/vomiting in 35. 7 %. Neurological manifestations (hemiparesis and cranial nerve deficit) were noted in 14. 3 %. HIV infection is the main purveyor of NMC in Mali. The actual incidence of cryptococcosis is unclear due to the poor sensitivity of diagnostic techniques. This study highlights diagnostic difficulties related to clinical polymorphism and poor technical facilities. Agglutination testing of blood and CSF is recommended, but mortality remains...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: Paediatric {{patients}} are a special group in apheresis. It is general accepted to use adult indications in paediatric patients, but {{data in this}} age group are rare. In order to provide more information of apheresis practise in children and young adults (Methods: This is a web-based registry. A link is available from the WAA homepage (www. worldapheresis. org). So far data from 12, 448 procedures have been included. Six hundred and twelve procedures were performed in 135 children and young adults (308 procedures < 16 a, 237 from 17 to 20 a, and 67 with 21 a) representing 5 % of the total population. The median age was 14 years (range 1 - 21 years), 74 male and 61 female. These data were entered by 15 centres with a frequency of in median 18 aphereses in young patients per centre (range 1 - 287) from 2003 to 2007. Results: Main indications: haematological diseases and also nephrological, and neurological. The type of aphereses was mainly Leukapheresis (196, 33 %), plasma exchange (149, 25 %), photopheresis (127, 21 %), and lipid aphereses (79, 13 %). Blood access: peripheral vessels in 305 procedures (50 K, compared to 73 % in adults), central venous catheter in 239 (38 %), and AV-fistula in 2 % and 0. 3 %, and in 8 (1. 31 %) procedures an arterial line was used. Anticoagulation was mostly by ACD (71 %), heparin (18 % or the combination of both (3 %). 39 adverse events (AE) were registered in 22 (= 3. 59 %) of the procedures. mostly graded as mild. Treatment was interrupted in 14 procedures (2. 29 %. AE's were abdominal pain, anaphylactic shock, flush, hyper- and hypotension, nausea, vertigo, <b>cephalea</b> and need for sedation and technical problems with the device and problems with the venous access. The rate of AE's was similar for stem cell harvesting and for plasma exchange (4 %, and 4. 7 %). respectively). Conclusion: The paediatric data compared to the whole registry data set are showing that aphereses are performed as safe in paediatrics as in adults. Centres are mostly handling only a few cases younger than 21. Therefore more exchange of information and experience in paediatric apheresis is warranted. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Methods: open multicenter clinical trial during one year was conducted in postmenopausal women. The patients were assigned to receive 70 mg of Sodic Alendronate in a soft gelatin capsule presentation, once time per week. The primaries endpoints were the bone density mineral measured by DEXA and the C-telopeptide serum level. The bone condition was evaluated by basal bone densitometry, 6 and 12 months. The bone resortion was evaluated by basal C-telopeptide serum levels, to 3, 6 and 12 months. The secondary endpoint was the presentation of secondary adverse events. Results: the study included 146 patients recruited in 10 rheumatologic clinical centers in Colombia, with diagnosis of osteopenia or osteporosis. Mean aged was 67 ± 8 years (range 45. 7 to 92. 8 years) and the mean duration of menopausal time was 16 ± 7. 8 years. Thirty patients (20. 54 %) had a history of previous fracture bone. At month 12, a statistically significant reduction from base line in mean of C-telopeptide serum level was observed (basal 0. 53, 3 month 0. 22, 6 month 0. 17 and 12 month 0. 17, p < 0. 00001). In addition, there was a clinical and statistically significant improvement in the T-score with the treatment in lumbar vertebrae L 2 -L 4 (basal - 2. 57, 6 month - 2. 27 and 12 month - 2. 29), femur (basal - 2. 37, 6 month - 1. 98 and 12 month - 1. 99), trochanter (basal - 1. 95, 6 month - 1. 55 and 12 month - 1. 41), and in hip (basal - 1. 73, 6 month - 1. 6 and 12 month - 1. 57). Also it was observed an improvement in the parameters of bone density of 2. 3 % at lumbar vertebral level and of 2. 59 % in hip. No significant changes were observed in a left neck femur and trochanter. These increases are similar to observed with other presentations of alendronates and biphosphonates. Among this population, only the 8. 2 % had dyspeptic symptoms, 3. 4 % vertigo, 2. 7 % <b>cephalea</b> and 1. 4 % constipation.

40|$|Os autores fazem uma revisão de 103 casos de endocardites infecciosas, dos quais 52 apresentaram manifestações neurológicas. Dos 52 que não tiveram problemas neurológicos, 39 faleceram 175 %), enquanto que dos 51 que não tiveram alterações do sistema nervoso, apenas 18 evoluíram para o óbito 135, 3 %). A endocardite infecciosa com manifestações neurológicas, na presente série, foi dominante no sexo masculino. Os grupos etários mais envolvidos foram as crianças, adolescentes e adultos jovens. Houve outro pico importante em pacientes acima de 50 anos. Os critérios para o diagnóstico de endocardite infecciosa utilizados no presente estudo, foram os clássicos, acrescidos de outros considerados de extrema utilidade, à medida que a experiência foi sendo acumulada, acompanhando paralelamente as modificações dos padrões etiológicos, assim como as alterações dos espectros clínicos da doença, conseqüentes a muitos fatores aqui discutidos. Os principais distúrbios neurológicos observados foram as manifestações meningeias, 25 / 52 148, 1 %), alterações do comportamento, 20 / 52 (38, 4 %), fenômenos motores (paralisias e paresias), 20 / 52 (38, 4 %). Alterações do nível de consciência (torpor ou coma), ao lado de outras menos comuns, como cefaléia 16 / 52 (26, 9 %), convulsões, 10 / 52 (19, 2 %), afasia 7 / 52 (13, 5 %) e manchas de Roth, 7 / 53 (13, 5 %). As manifestações neurológicas frequentemente foram múltiplas em um mesmo paciente. Nas formas de endocardite, foram em muitos casos praticamente as alterações que abriram e dominaram a cena clínica. As mais comuns foram: síndrome meningeia, síndrome {{vascular}} e encefalopatia tóxica. Foi difícil, em conseqüência de múltiplas manifestações neurológicas num mesmo paciente, estabelecer critérios entre a lesão neurológica e o prognóstico, embora o coma profundo, as convulsões, os distúrbios motores acentuados, a meningite e as alterações do comportamento, isoladamente ou em associação, façam com que o mesmo seja bem mais sério. O germe mais encontrado em nossa série foi oStaphylococcus aureus, relacionado com formas agudas da infecção endocárdica, aliado a processos destrutivos valvulares e a sérias alterações neurológicas tais como meningite, encefalite, infartos, hemorragias e abcessos cerebrais. Os principais achados neurológicos referentes à patologia, no estudo de 15 casos, são apresentados ao lado de conclusões tiradas de reflexões sobre o material analisado e da experiência vivida. Uma revisão da literatura é feita desde os trabalhos iniciais sobre a doença até os dias de hoje, ficando evidenciada a importância do tema pelas grandes contribuições apresentadas pelos diferentes autores. The authors make {{a revision}} of 103 cases of infectious endocarditis, 52 of which brought about neurologic manifestations. In the 52 cases showing neurologic problems, 39 died (75 %), while in the other 51 cases showing no alterations {{of the nervous system}} only 18 evolved to death (35, 3 %). The present series of infectious endocarditis with neurologic manifestations was dominat in the mate sex. The more affected age groups were children, adolescents and young adults. Another significant peak was shown by patients more than 50 years old. For the diagnosis of infectious endocarditis in the present study, classical criteria were adopted in addition to a few other ones which were recognized to be extremely useful in the process of accumulating experience, as paralel observation was applied to those changes of etiological patterns and to those alterations of clinical specters of the disease, which resulted from many of the factors here described. The major neurologic diserders detected were meningeal manifestations, 25 / 52 (48, 1 %), behavior alterations, 20 / 52 (38, 4 %) motor phenomena (paralysis and paresis), 20 / 52 (38, 4 %), alterations of the level of consciousness (torpor or coma), plus a few less commonones, such as <b>cephalea,</b> 16 / 52 (30, 7 %), alterations of cranial pai rs, 14 / 52 (26, 9 %), convulsions, 10 / 52 (19, 2 %),aphasia, 7 / 52 (13, 5 %). Multiple neurologic manifestations were frequent in the same patient. These alterations were practically the opening and dominant feature of the clinical scene in many cases of acute endocardites. Most common were: meningeal syndrome, vascular syndrome and toxic encephalopathy. Due to multiple neurologic manifestations in the same patient it was difficult to establish criteria linking the neurologic lesion to the prognostic although in states of profound coma, convulsion, pronounced motor disorders, meningitis and behavior alterations, isolated or in association, this prognostic becomes rather more serious. The germ more often found in our series was the staphylococcus aureus, related to acute forms of endocardiac infection, associated with valve destructive process and serious neurologic alterations, such as meningitis, encephalitis, infarcts, hemorrhages and cerebral abscesses. A description is given of the major neurologic findings related to the pathology and of the conclusions draw upon reflexion over the material analysed and the experience collected. A review of the existing literature on the disease, from the initial to the lates studies, clearly points out to the importance of the theme to which different authors have made remarkable contributions...|$|E
