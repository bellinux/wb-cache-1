We measure the complex reflection from a sample terminating a coaxial transmission line and calibrate the signals with three standards with known reflection coefficients. Thermal isolation of the heat load from the inner conductor is accomplished by including a section of NbTi superconducting <b>cable</b> (<b>transition</b> temperature around 8 − 9 K) and hermetic seal glass bead adapters. This enables us to stabilize the base temperature of the sample stage at 300 mK. However, the inclusion of this superconducting cable complicates the calibration procedure.

40|$|Transients from {{lightning}} strikes can enter underground cables at overhead line to power <b>cable</b> <b>transitions.</b> Possible overvoltages on these surges at cross-bonding connections {{of the cable}} screens are of major concern. A model is developed for modelling overvoltages from transient signal propagation through a combined cross-bonding cable and box. This model {{is applied to the}} first Dutch 400 kV cable connection. Such model incorporates model parameters whose values depend on design details of the cross-bonding box. The values for these model parameters are extracted from the measured transmission and reflection signal on steep pulses injected into the actual cross-bonding box configuration. The model combines transmission line description for the cross-bonding cables with mainly inductive behaviour of the cross-bonding box. The obtained results are verified by measurements. The model is applied to investigate overvoltages induced at the cross-bonding cable and box on 1. 2 / 50 ?s impulse voltage injection representing a lightning impulse voltage applied to the core conductor of the cross-bonding cable.

The virtual work-energy functional {{is used to}} obtain the non-linear equations of three-dimensional motion.

The axial extensibility effect is also included in order to obtain accurate results. Based on a multi-degree-of-freedom model, numerical procedures are implemented to solve both spatial and temporal problems. Various numerical examples of arbitrarily sagged cables with large-amplitude initial conditions are carried out to highlight some outstanding features of cable non-linear dynamics by accounting also for internal resonance phenomena. Non-linear coupling between three- and two-dimensional motions, and non-linear cable tension responses are analyzed. For specific <b>cables,</b> modal <b>transition</b> phenomena taking place during in-plane vibrations and ensuing from occurrence of a dominant internal resonance are observed.

40|$|This {{full text}} paper was peer {{reviewed}} {{at the direction}} of IEEE Communications Society subject matter experts for publication in the IEEE ICC 2011 proceedingsNowadays wireless sensor networks (WSNs) have attracted a great deal of study due to their low cost and widerange applications. Most of the sensors used so far are point sensors which have a disc-shaped sensing region. In this paper, we study a new type of sensor: the fiber optic cable sensor. Unlike a traditional point sensor, this type of sensor has a rectangular sensing region with a processor installed on it to do processing and communication. Like wireless sensor networks with point sensors, energy-efficient communication is still an important issue in wireless sensor networks with cable sensors because of the need to efficiently use limited resources. To address the issue, we propose a <b>Cable</b> Mode <b>Transition</b> (CMT) algorithm, which determines the minimal number of active sensors to maintain Kcoverage of a terrain as well as K-connectivity of the network. Specifically, it allocates periods of inactivity for cable sensors without affecting the coverage and connectivity requirements of the network based only on local information. Before presenting CMT, we first show the relationship between coverage and connectivity, then the eligibility algorithm permitting a cable sensor to decide whether to stay active. CMT calls the eligibility algorithm to schedule cables. Simulation results show that our scheme is efficient in saving energy and thus can prolong the lifetime of wireless cable sensor networks. supported by NSF grant CBET 072969...|$|R
40|$|Since {{the storm}} Gudrun in 2005, {{overhead}} lines are {{being replaced by}} underground <b>cables.</b> However the <b>transition</b> to <b>cables</b> lead to appearance of overvoltages during islanding. In order to analyze the problem, {{a part of the}} distribution grid where the problems appeared, is studied. The study is performed in PSCAD where a simplified model of the grid is built. Simplifications are used for the modelling of the surrounding grid and the customers are represented with lumped constant impedance loads. However, the other components of the system, such as transformers, cables, OHLs and generators are modelled in detail. Different islanding scenarios are simulated based on possible faults in the system. The results are analysed to find what the source of overvoltages and what in uence the level of overvoltage. A loss of connection from the main grid to the local generator causes instabillity and result in over- or undervoltage. A solution is to disconnect all shunt capacitances at the local generation units and install a shunt reactor to compensate for the reactive power generation from the cables. The reactor is only required if the cables reactive power consumption is too high...|$|R

The possibility to simulate the detailed geometry of an ICRF antenna in front of a realistic plasma description and to obtain the antenna input parameters and the radiated near electric field distribution is of paramount importance to evaluate and predict the overall system performances. Upon starting from a reference geometry, we pursued a detailed electrical optimization of the IC launcher and we came out with a final geometry showing a remarkable increase in terms of power coupled to plasma.

40|$|In {{large scale}} superconducting applications, like bending magnets in {{particle}} colliders, thermal stability {{is an important}} issue. A relatively small perturbation of about 100 µJ in a single point can create a small normal zone in the superconductor, which will experience sever joule heating. If the heating exceeds the cooling the normal zone will expand, and vice versa it will collapse. The thermal stability of a superconductor defines the amount of thermal energy required for a point disturbance to initiate an irreversible transition to the normal state. There is little empirical data available on this for the current generation Nb 3 Sn Rutherford cables. This work aims to {{provide an overview of}} the thermal stability in such cables. With the aid of point heaters, the thermal stability is probed at various positions on the cable surface under various operating conditions. It is shown that regardless of the high current density and poor cooling, these cables can recover from a quenched strand by current redistribution when the test conditions are far from the <b>cable</b> limitations. This <b>transition</b> point, where the cable can recover from a single normal strand, is determined for test current and applied magnetic field {{as close as possible to}} the typical operational conditions of a magnet coil within the experimental window. In the center part of a Rutherford cable, the thermal stability is significantly better than at the cable edges. This is due to a reduced RRR and degraded critical current at the thick and thin edges of the cable. The thermal stability decreases when Nb 3 Sn is operated at a lower temperature, i. e. 1. 9 K. Two numerical models and one analytical model are compared to the empirical observations. It is found that none of the models predicts all features of the thermal stability curves with high accuracy...|$|R
40|$|This is {{the author}} {{accepted}} manuscript. An increasing use of submarine power cables is found in dynamic applications such as floating wind, floating wave and tidal generation technologies. These applications substantially differ from common applications, such as floating oil and gas installations {{in that they are}} more dynamic. Power cables that cross the water column, so-called umbilicals will be exposed to considerable extreme and fatigue loads mainly induced by the motion of the device, incident waves and tidal current. The actual loading regimes of dynamic submarine power cables in operation are not well understood for marine renewable energy (MRE) applications {{due to a lack of}} field experience. The cable design has to consider a combination of cable geometry, hydrodynamic parameters, suitable layout configuration, suitable ancillary systems (e. g. bend stiffeners) in relation to the environmental site conditions. This paper evaluates the influence of the environmental conditions and the cable design parameters on the mechanical loads and potential failure modes of a dynamic submarine power cable attached to a dynamic floating body in form of a generic point absorber. One notable result is the large effect of the tidal direction, even in relatively moderate flow conditions. The full range of tidal flow conditions should be considered in the power cable design to ensure that the cable MBR is not exceeded in any conditions. The shown configurations also give some insight into the possible variations of the geometric cable configuration. A well balanced S-curve shape yields some of the best results and achieves a good load distribution along the <b>cable</b> and the <b>transition</b> points, whilst avoiding cable compression. The design challenge for the cable configuration is to maintain the S-shape for as many environmental and device response modes as possible in order to achieve high reliability. This paper will be useful for cable, device and site developers of floating MRE to inform the selection of the most suitable cable design...|$|R
