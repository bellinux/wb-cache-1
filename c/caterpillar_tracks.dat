5|$|Modern winter service {{vehicles}} will usually {{also have a}} satellite navigation system connected to a weather forecast feed, allowing the driver to choose the best areas to treat and to avoid areas in which rain is likely, which can wash away the grit used—the most advanced can even adapt to changing conditions, ensuring optimal gritter and plow settings. Most run on wheels, often with snow chains or studded tires, but some are mounted on <b>caterpillar</b> <b>tracks,</b> with the tracks themselves adapted to throw the snow towards {{the side of the}} road. Off-road winter {{service vehicles}} mounted on <b>caterpillar</b> <b>tracks</b> are known as snowcats. Snowcats are commonly fitted with snowplows or snow groomers, and are used by ski resorts to smooth and maintain pistes and snowmobile runs, although they can also be used as a replacement for chairlifts.|$|E
25|$|Robots {{all have}} some kind of {{mechanical}} construction, a frame, form or shape designed to achieve a particular task. For example, a robot designed to travel across heavy dirt or mud, might use <b>caterpillar</b> <b>tracks.</b> The mechanical aspect is mostly the creator's solution to completing the assigned task and dealing with the physics of the environment around it.

25|$|During World War II, {{the median}} strips of some autobahns were paved over {{to allow their}} {{conversion}} into auxiliary airstrips. Aircraft were either stashed in numerous tunnels or camouflaged in nearby woods. However, {{for the most part}} during the war, the autobahns were not militarily significant. Motor vehicles, such as trucks, could not carry goods or troops as quickly or in as much bulk and in the same numbers as trains could, and the autobahns could not be used by tanks as their weight and <b>caterpillar</b> <b>tracks</b> damaged the road surface. The general shortage of petrol in Germany during much of the war, as well as the low number of trucks and motor vehicles needed for direct support of military operations, further decreased the autobahn's significance. As a result, most military and economic freight was carried by rail. After the war, numerous sections of the autobahns were in bad shape, severely damaged by heavy Allied bombing and military demolition. Furthermore, thousands of kilometres of autobahns remained unfinished, their construction brought to a halt by 1943 due to the increasing demands of the war effort.|$|E

25|$|The Breton-Prétot {{machine was}} a saw {{designed}} {{to cut the}} barbed wire protecting enemy trenches of World War I. The first version consisted of a small circular saw, driven by a six hp engine, attached to a long lever that was placed on a small cart with four wheels, {{that had to be}} pushed towards its objective. Breton proposed the machine to the French government in November 1914 and a prototype was tried in January 1915, when it was shown that the system in this form had little practicality. The use of <b>caterpillar</b> <b>tracks</b> was discussed that same month, but since none was available at that time, the system was then mounted at Liancourt {{on the back of a}} Bajac tractor in an attempt to obtain all-terrain mobility, towards the end of February 1915. The small circular saw was replaced by a large vertical saw with thirteen teeth, but a larger horizontal circular saw was added, just above ground level to cut the barbed-wire poles. In July the system was again changed, the horizontal saw being left out and large deflection shields being placed to protect the wheels. Eight small bronze cannon were used as simulation weights.|$|E
25|$|The Bajac {{agricultural}} tractor however proved not mobile enough — the initial experiment had only tested the wire-cutting ability — {{and had the}} severe disadvantage of having to approach the enemy lines driving backwards. Breton and Prétot then considered {{using some of the}} two hundred American four-wheel drive Jeffery tractors that had been commanded by the French Artillery. When this was refused, Commandant Boissin directed Breton to the Schneider company which was working on the caterpillar track system, under a production licence from the American Holt Manufacturing Company. Experiments with the Holt <b>caterpillar</b> <b>tracks</b> had started in May 1915 at the Schneider plant with a 75hp wheel-directed model and the 45hp integral caterpillar Baby Holt, showing the superiority of the latter. On 16 June, new experiments had followed in front of the President of the Republic, and again on 22 July 1915 in front of War Minister Alexandre Millerand, who decided on 7 August 1915 on the construction of 10 armoured and armed Breton-Prétot machines. For his machine, Breton was thus allowed to order ten Holt tractors, to use as a base for his wire-cutting machine,. Experiments again took place on 10 September for Commander Ferrus. This order was modified on 7 December 1915 into an order to re-use the caterpillars to produce the first Schneider CA1 tanks.|$|E

5000|$|It is {{frequently}} claimed that Richard Lovell Edgeworth created a <b>caterpillar</b> <b>track.</b> It {{is true that}} in 1770 he patented a [...] "machine, that should carry and lay down its own road", but this was Edgeworth's choice of words. His own account in his autobiography is of a horse-drawn wooden carriage on eight retractable legs, capable of lifting itself over high walls. The description bears no similarity to a <b>caterpillar</b> <b>track.</b> Armoured trains appeared in the mid-19th century, and various armoured steam and petrol-engined vehicles were also proposed.|$|R

2500|$|Robots have {{electrical}} components which {{power and control}} the machinery.

Even petrol powered machines that get their power mainly from petrol still require an electric current to start the combustion process which is why most petrol powered machines like cars, have batteries. The electrical aspect of robots is used for movement (through motors), sensing (where electrical signals are used to measure things like heat, sound, position, and energy status) and operation (robots need some level of electrical energy supplied to their motors and sensors in order to activate and perform basic operations) ...|$|E
2500|$|Before 1914, inventors had {{designed}} armoured fighting vehicles and {{one had been}} rejected by the Austro-Hungarian army in 1911. In 1912, L. E. de Mole submitted plans to the War Office for a machine which foreshadowed the tank of 1916, that was also rejected and in Berlin an inventor demonstrated a land cruiser in 1913. By 1908, the British army had adopted vehicles with <b>caterpillar</b> <b>tracks</b> to move heavy artillery and in France, Major E. D. Swinton RE heard of the cross-country, caterpillar-tracked Holt tractor in June 1914. In October, Swinton thought of a machine-gun destroyer, that could cross barbed wire and trenches and at GHQ discussed it with Major-General G. H. Fowke, the army chief engineer, who passed this on to Lieutenant-Colonel Maurice Hankey, the Secretary of the War Council but this had evoked little interest by January 1915. Swinton [...] persuaded the War Office {{to set up an}} informal committee, which in February watched a demonstration of a Holt tractor pulling a weight of [...] over trenches and barbed wire, the performance of which was judged unsatisfactory.|$|E
2500|$|In 1937, the Red Army had {{assigned}} engineer Mikhail Koshkin {{to lead a}} {{new team}} to design a replacement for the BT tanks at the Kharkiv Komintern Locomotive Plant (KhPZ). The prototype tank, designated A-20, was specified with [...] of armour, a 45mm (1.77in) gun, and the new Model V-2-34 engine, using less-flammable diesel fuel in a V12 configuration designed by Konstantin Chelpan. It also had an 8×6-wheel convertible drive similar to the BT tank's 8×2, which allowed it to run on wheels without <b>caterpillar</b> <b>tracks.</b> This feature had greatly saved on maintenance and repair of the unreliable tank tracks of the early 1930s, and allowed tanks to exceed [...] on roads, but gave no advantage in combat and its complexity {{made it difficult to}} maintain. By 1937–38, track design had improved and the designers considered it a waste of space, weight, and maintenance resources, despite the road speed advantage. The A-20 also incorporated previous research (BT-IS and BT-SW-2 projects) into sloped armour: its all-round sloped armour plates were more likely to deflect rounds than perpendicular armour.|$|E
50|$|Hornsbys thought {{civilian}} {{applications of}} the <b>caterpillar</b> <b>track</b> would be popular, but they only ended up selling one vehicle. Holt Manufacturing and C.L. Best Tractor Co. (the originator was Daniel Best) of the USA recognised its potential and sold many tracked vehicles; their vehicles were steered by a front wheel, unlike modern tanks. Hornsbys, with no incentives from military orders, {{did not see the}} same glowing future for the type of vehicle. They sold the patent to Holt, and only a year later, the British Army ordered 442 of Holt's <b>caterpillar</b> <b>tracked</b> vehicles made under licence by Ruston in Lincoln.|$|R

25|$|The {{machines}} {{typically have}} two large powered wheels {{at the back}} and two smaller wheels for steering at the front. However, some traction engines used a four-wheel-drive variation, and some experimented with an early form of <b>caterpillar</b> <b>track.</b>|$|R
2500|$|On 9 December 1915 in the Souain experiment, a Schneider {{prototype}} armoured tank, a Baby Holt chassis with boiler-plate armour, {{was demonstrated}} to the French Army. Among the onlookers were General Philippe Pétain, and Colonel Jean Baptiste Eugène Estienne — an artillery man and engineer held in very high regard throughout the army for his unmatched technological and tactical expertise. The {{results of the}} prototype tank were, {{at least according to}} Estienne, excellent, displaying remarkable mobility in the difficult terrain of the former battlefield of Souain. The length of the Baby Holt however appeared to be too short to bridge German trenches, justifying the development of longer <b>caterpillar</b> <b>tracks</b> for the French tank project. [...] For Estienne the vehicle shown embodied concepts about armoured fighting vehicles which he had been advocating since August 1914. [...] Already on 1 December Estienne had proposed to the French GHQ the use of tracked armoured tractors to move infantry, equipment and cannon over the battlefield, having performed some trials with British caterpillar tractors. On 11 December Estienne let a certain lieutenant Thibier draw a sketch of two conceptions: the one of a Baby Holt chassis fitted at the front and the back with auxiliary rollers, to improve the trench-crossing capacity; the other of an elongated suspension protected by side armour.|$|E

[...] The Castéran and the Killen-Strait Tractor were also tested but rejected. Work was now begun on an auto-mitrailleuse blindée à chenilles ("tracked armoured self-propelled machine gun"). On 16 June, new experiments followed in front of the President of the Republic Raymond Poincaré, leading to the order of six, later expanded to ten, armoured tracked vehicles for further testing. The type was since July called a machine offensive à chenilles ("tracked offensive machine") and was based on the Baby Holt with a suspension that was to be thirty centimetres lengthened. [...] In August drawings were made of what was now designated the tracteur blindé et armé ("armoured and armed tractor"). In September 1915 the Schneider programme was combined with an official one for the development of an armoured barbed wire cutter by engineer and Member of Parliament Jules-Louis Breton, the Breton-Prétot machine. [...] Ten of the fifteen available Baby Holt vehicles were to be armoured and fitted with the wire cutter of which ten systems had been ordered on 7 August. [...] This involved the Service Automobile in the project. [...] On 10 September, new experiments were made for Commandant L. Ferrus, an officer who had been involved in the study (and ultimate rejection) of the Levavasseur tank project in 1908.|$|E

40|$|Small {{alterations}} to {{the structure}} of a star-shaped template totally change its mode of operation. The hexapyridyl template directs the conversion of a porphyrin dimer to the cyclic hexamer, but deleting one pyridine site changes the product to the cyclic decamer, while deleting two binding sites changes the product to the cyclic octamer. This surprising switch in selectivity is explained by the formation of 2 : 1 <b>caterpillar</b> <b>track</b> complexes, in which two template wheels bind inside the nanoring. <b>Caterpillar</b> <b>track</b> complexes can also be prepared by binding the hexapyridyl template inside the 8 - and 10 -porphyrin nanorings. NMR exchange spectroscopy (EXSY) experiments show that these complexes exhibit correlated motion, in which the conrotatory rotation of the two template wheels is coupled to rotation of the nanoring track. In the case of the 10 -porphyrin system, the correlated motion can be locked by binding palladium(II) dichloride between the two templates...|$|R
