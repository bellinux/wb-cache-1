40|$|Swiss {{laboratories}} performing toxicological {{road traffic}} analyses have been authorized {{for many years}} by the Swiss Federal Roads Office (FEDRO). In 2003 FEDRO {{signed a contract with}} the Swiss Society of Legal Medicine (SSLM) to organize the complete quality management concerning road traffic analyses. For this purpose a multidisciplinary working group was established under the name of "road traffic commission (RTC) ". RTC has to organize external quality control, to interpret the results of these controls, to perform audits in the laboratories and to report all results to FEDRO. Furthermore the working group can be mandated for special tasks by FEDRO. As an independent organization the Swiss Center for Quality Control (CSCQ) in Geneva manages the external quality controls in the laboratory over the past years. All tested drugs and psychoactive substances are listed in a federal instruction. The so-called 'zero tolerance substances' (THC, morphine, cocaine, amphetamine, methamphetamine, MDMA and MDEA) and their metabolites have to be tested once a year, all other substances (benzodiazepines, zolpidem, phenobarbital, etc.) periodically. Results over the last years show that all laboratories are generally within the confidence interval of +/- 30 % of the mean value. In <b>cases</b> <b>of</b> <b>non-conformities</b> measures have to be taken immediately and reported to the working group. External audits are performed triennially but accredited laboratories can combine this audit with the approval of the Swiss Accreditation Service (SAS). During the audits a special checklist filled in by the laboratory director is assessed. Non-conformities have to be corrected. During the process of establishing a new legislation, RTC had an opportunity of advising FEDRO. In collaboration with FEDRO, RTC and hence SSLM can work actively on improving of quality assurance in road traffic toxicological analyses, and has an opportunity to bring its professional requests to the federal authorities...|$|R

In addition to that, the data interpretation including the data uncertainty have to be treated appropriately.

40|$|In {{a market}} economy there are needed certain rules for products, {{services}} and commercial practices {{in order to satisfy}} consumer's requirements, while ensuring the free movement of goods and services as well as fair competition. The seller is obliged to deliver to the consumer only products which are in accordance with the contract of sale. In <b>case</b> <b>of</b> <b>non-conformity,</b> the consumer is entitled to have the goods brought into conformity free of charge by repair or replacement, or an appropriate price reduction or rescission of the contract for those goods. Consumer policy in the European Union enables European citizens to shop safely in all Member States. Because the internal market must guarantee the free movement of goods, persons, services and capital, there was a need for a common set of minimum rules of consumer protection valid regardless of where the purchase of goods is made in the Community. When a customer has purchased a product, the Community legislation requires that the product he receives corresponds to what he, the buyer, expressly or implicitly agreed to buy, that is to what is provided in the contract between seller and consumer. Obviously, the product must be used in a normal way. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{investigation}} of the structural characteristics (geometry, structural details, materials quality, etc.) is a crucial step {{in the assessment of}} existing reinforced concrete (RC) constructions especially after earthquakes, fire or explosions, increase of live loads, etc. Specifically, the {{investigation of}} materials quality can also be required for new constructions in the <b>case</b> <b>of</b> <b>non-conformity</b> of the strength obtained from standard test specimens. Therefore the knowledge of the in-situ mechanical properties of constituent materials (concrete and steel) is a key issue in the evaluation of structural capacity. In order to achieve this goal, destructive (DT; e. g., cores) and non-destructive (NDT; e. g., ultrasonic, rebound) test methods are often adopted, either alone or combined. However, insufficient indications are provided in the current European and Italian codes to permit an effective use of these methods, individually or in combination, during in-situ investigation campaigns. To remedy this, this paper proposes some possible improvements to the current standards paying special attention to the identification of the concrete areas with homogeneous properties within the structure using non-destructive tests (rebound index and direct ultrasonic velocity tests). It also, using a duly selected number of destructive test values (i. e., cores), establishes a multivariate relation between NDT and DT data for each homogeneous area, thus also permitting the estimation of concrete strength in the other points where only NDT tests are provided. Suggestions for the application of the proposed procedure, are provided in the report of a real case...|$|E

40|$|Suppose {{you bought}} a gadget on a web shop. When {{choosing}} you take a lot into consideration. You might be worried about the latest trends, delivery modalities, the newest technologies… But you might also attach importance {{to the impact of}} your purchase on the environment or to the labour conditions of the workers that have manufactured your new gadget. Some of you may know how it feels when you realize that your favourite brand has 'betrayed' you because their production methods are not that 'ecological' or human rights-friendly. Thus, a fundamental question that arises is: how can European (EU) consumer contract law protect the legitimate expectations of the ethical consumer in a digital era? Firstly, {{it is important to note}} that the EU has set the objective for a 'green and circular economy' and 'sustainable consumption and production'. Also with regard to digital (consumer) law, things are evolving. After abandoning a 28 th sales regime 'the CESL', the Commission proposed, among others, a Directive concerning online and other distance sales contracts of goods. It introduces e. g. rules about conformity of goods and the remedies in <b>case</b> <b>of</b> <b>non-conformity.</b> How can we use these elements of 'non-conformity' and 'remedies' to enhance the protection of ethical consumers? The European Consumer Organisation (BEUC) suggested for example in its response to the Commission of 3 September 2015 that the latter should implement, with regard to non-conformity, criteria such as 'durability'. This contribution aims to contribute to the debate about ethical consumerism in a digital era. Therefore it is of fundamental importance to explore all possible mechanisms (and their necessity) in the (proposed) EU contract (soft) law instruments to enhance the protection of ethical consumers, and especially the instruments aimed at online sales contracts. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|The {{domestic}} legal system, or the Macedonian Law of Contracts and Torts, {{incorporates the}} concept of the Federal Law of Contracts and Torts from 1978. Namely, there is difference between <b>cases</b> <b>of</b> failure to perform (entirely or in part) a contractual obligation and <b>cases</b> <b>of</b> performance of an obligation lacking conformity. Performance lacking conformity (performance with material and legal defects) is regulated separately in the provisions of LCT addressing the liability of the seller, while the provisions in the general part of the law (art. 110) extend the application of these rules to all bilateral contracts, unless provisions of specific bilateral contracts contain different rules. There- fore, there is a legislative tendency to separate <b>cases</b> <b>of</b> failure to perform and those of performance lacking conformity, however, this is not always possible in practice. In principle, the LCT concept is not very different from the concept accepted in CISG. This, of course, refers more to the matter of existence of material defects, or existence <b>of</b> <b>non-conformity</b> <b>of</b> goods. Differences do exist, how- ever, in legal remedies, particularly with regard to requirements for individual legal remedies (ter- mination, (due) performance, price reduction, damages). Having this in mind, we can say that the domestic legislator did take into account the provisions of CISG, or the provisions of earlier Hague Conventions. The source of non-compliance between the CISG concept and {{the concept of}} domestic legislation is, however, the solution of the latter that rejects the fundamental breach of contract and therefore creates an expressed duality between legal remedies in <b>cases</b> <b>of</b> lack <b>of</b> conformity and <b>cases</b> <b>of</b> failure to perform. ...|$|R
