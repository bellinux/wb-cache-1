5|$|After graduating high school, Diekman {{enrolled}} at Doane College, where he pitched for one season. He {{then transferred to}} Cloud County Community College in Kansas. Following his sophomore season, he attended a junior college baseball showcase at which, with a fastball well over , he drew much interest. He received an offer for a full scholarship to be a Nebraska <b>Cornhusker,</b> which he would have accepted had the Phillies not drafted him in the 2007 Major League Baseball Draft's 30th round.|$|E
5|$|<b>Cornhusker</b> Ahman Green, who {{had started}} most of Nebraska's games during the regular season, entered the game and ran three {{straight}} plays for 24 yards. On the third play, Green fumbled the ball, which was recovered by a Nebraska player. Frost then completed an 11-yard pass for a first down to the Tech 21-yard line. The Cornhuskers were stopped for losses on two consecutive running plays, but Frost broke free for a 22-yard touchdown run. The score and subsequent extra point gave the Cornhuskers a 4121 lead with 3:26 remaining in the game.|$|E
5|$|Following the Nebraska kickoff, Tech {{tried to}} answer the <b>Cornhusker</b> score with one of its own. The Hokies started at their 20-yard line after a touchback. Parker caught an eight-yard pass from Druckenmiller, then ran for three yards and a first down. With a first down at the Tech 31-yard line, Druckenmiller threw an {{incomplete}} pass. This {{was followed by a}} four-yard run by Oxendine and a ten-yard completion by Druckenmiller for another first down, this time to the Tech 45-yard line. Oxendine picked up three yards on two short runs, then Druckenmiller advanced the Hokies into the Nebraska side of the field with a 19-yard pass to Jennings. Oxendine was stopped for no gain and Druckenmiller threw an incompletion, but on third down, Druckenmiller connected with White for a 33-yard gain and Tech's first touchdown of the second half. The extra point was good, and the Hokies again trimmed Nebraska's lead to three points: 2421. Tech's drive covered 80 yards in 12 plays and 4:56 of game time.|$|E
50|$|The University of Nebraska Coliseum (also {{called the}} NU Coliseum or The Coliseum) is an indoor coliseum {{on the campus}} of the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. It was the home of Nebraska <b>Cornhuskers</b> {{basketball}} team between 1926 and 1976, and currently one of the homes of the Nebraska <b>Cornhuskers</b> volleyball team and Nebraska <b>Cornhuskers</b> wrestling team, though not in active use.|$|R
50|$|Jackson {{attended}} the University of Nebraska where she played as a forward and midfielder for the <b>Cornhuskers.</b> Jackson scored 35 goals and had 31 assists in 85 appearances for the <b>Cornhuskers.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The inaugural matchup {{between the}} <b>Cornhuskers</b> and Hurricanes was in 1951 in Miami, Florida. The Hurricanes won 19-7. The next game was in 1953 in Lincoln, Nebraska with the <b>Cornhuskers</b> winning 20-16.|$|R
5|$|Before the {{subsequent}} kickoff, Virginia Tech committed a 15-yard personal foul penalty, allowing Nebraska {{to kick off}} from the 50-yard line instead of the regulation 35-yard line. The kick resulted in a touchback, and Tech started from its 20-yard line. Oxendine picked up nine yards on a rush, and Parker earned another seven yards for a first down at the Tech 36. Oxendine then ran three consecutive times for 17 yards and a first down. After Parker was stopped for no gain, Druckenmiller ran the ball himself for a seven-yard gain and a first down at the Nebraska 40-yard line. Oxendine gained one yard on a carry to the left, but on the next play, Druckenmiller was sacked for an 11-yard loss, negating the minor gain. Druckenmiller then completed a 24-yard pass to Oxendine, but the play was negated by a holding penalty against Virginia Tech, effectively resulting {{in a loss of}} 34 yards and pushing the Hokies back to their 33-yard line. On the first play after the holding penalty, Druckenmiller fumbled the football after he was jarred by Nebraska defender Mike Rucker. The loose ball was picked up by <b>Cornhusker</b> Jason Peter, who ran 31 yards for a defensive touchdown. The score gave Nebraska a 177 lead with 3:36 remaining in the first half.|$|E
5|$|In Robinson's {{second game}} for the 2015–16 Michigan Wolverines men's {{basketball}} team, he posted 19 points on 6–6 shooting (5–5 3-point shots) from the floor against Elon. On December 12, Michigan defeated Delaware State 80–33, as Robinson made his first career start for Michigan by posting 11 points on 3–5 three-point shooting. At the time Robinson ranked third {{in the nation in}} three-point shooting percentage. Note that various sources have various eligibility thresholds. E.g., while BigTen.org only requires a minimum of 1.0 made per game, NCAA.org requires a minimum of 2.5 made per game. On December 23, Robinson tied his career high (set twice at Williams) with six assists against Bryant. The game marked the ninth consecutive game in which he made at least 3 3-point shots. Robinson entered conference play as the Big Ten leader in three-point field goal percentage and led the Big Ten Conference in both three-point field goals (52) and three-point field goal percentage (.565) through {{the first week of the}} Big Ten Conference schedule. On January 12, with leading scorer Caris LeVert sidelined, Michigan defeated (#3/#3) Maryland 70–67 as Robinson contributed 17 points on 5–9 three-point shooting. On January 23, Michigan defeated Nebraska 81–68, behind a game-high and season-high 21 points by Robinson. With the <b>Cornhusker</b> defense challenging his three-point shot, he scored more points inside the three-point line than outside it for the first time as a Wolverine. The January 27 game against Rutgers marked the 17th consecutive game in which Robinson made at least two three-point shots. Robinson made only one three-point shot in each the subsequent two games against Penn State and (#22/21) Indiana. Nonetheless, Robinson entered the February 6 Michigan–Michigan State men's basketball rivalry game against the #10-ranked 2015–16 Spartans as the Big Ten Conference leader in three-point shots made and three-point field goal percentage, but he was held to 0–3 three-point shooting in the game. The game marked the first time since the season opener, that Robinson did not make a single three point shot, ending a 22-game streak. On February 10, Michigan defeated Minnesota as Robinson posted a game- and season-high nine rebounds to go along with 14 points on 4-for-7 three-point shooting.|$|E
25|$|<b>Cornhusker</b> All-Americans became commonplace during Devaney's {{tenure as}} coach. Among the 18 who {{received}} such recognition were Johnny Rodgers, {{who won the}} Heisman Trophy in 1972, and Rich Glover, who won the Outland Trophy and Lombardi Award that same season.|$|E
50|$|If {{there was}} any {{consolation}} to the <b>Cornhuskers</b> that things could be worse, it was the Kansas State Wildcats that continued to bring the good news. Amidst a record string of consecutive losing seasons, the <b>Cornhuskers</b> handed Kansas State a shutout. The 32-0 defeat of the Wildcats was Nebraska's sixth-straight victory over the team from Manhattan, and the <b>Cornhuskers</b> improved to 26-4-2 in the series.|$|R
50|$|Culbert played college {{football}} from 2006 to 2008 with the Nebraska <b>Cornhuskers</b> of the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. He played {{running back and}} defensive back for the <b>Cornhuskers</b> before settling on defensive back in 2008.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Cornhuskers</b> {{wasted no}} time in finding the {{scoreboard}} early on, but wasted two scoring attempts soon afterward to lost fumbles. The game remained fairly evenly matched thereafter, until a late spirited attack by the Jayhawks put a brief minor scare in Nebraska before being warded off. This was the 14th straight game dropped to the <b>Cornhuskers,</b> and the Jayhawks fell to 9-34-3 against the <b>Cornhuskers</b> in the series.|$|R
25|$|As the Rocky Mountain Rocket was {{downgraded}} due to non-rail competition, {{the route}} traveled by {{the train was}} shortened from the western terminal at Denver, first to Omaha, then to Council Bluffs and the train was renamed The <b>Cornhusker.</b> In 1970, the train was cut to a Chicago to Rock Island run, a run entirely {{within the confines of}} the State of Illinois and finally renamed the Quad Cities Rocket.|$|E
25|$|The Sun {{came into}} the 2010 WNBA Draft with two picks {{in the first round}} – the first and seventh overall picks, the latter of which was {{acquired}} one day prior to the draft from Tulsa. With its first overall selection in franchise history, the Sun took UConn standout and Player of the Year recipient, Tina Charles, the consensus top prospect available. By playing alongside premier talent at the collegiate level, Charles had shown that she was ready to pilot an offense and lead this franchise into the post-Sales era. After the selection of Charles, Thibault had the remainder of the draft to fortify the weapons around his newly acquired center. To diminish the losses of Amber Holt and Chante Black, both of whom were part of the package deal with the Shock, the Sun selected Kansas product Danielle McCray. Prior to the draft, it was understood that McCray wouldn't be available to participate in the upcoming season due to an ACL injury she sustained in college. There was risk involved concerning her durability, but McCray's potential as a superstar was reason enough to take the leap of faith. The Sun cemented its guard corps with the selection of Allison Hightower in the second round. Thibault wasn't finished making a mark on draft day as he maneuvered around the draft board to address the Sun's suspect defense. He nabbed former <b>Cornhusker</b> Kelsey Griffin, who was taken third overall, in a trade once again involving the Lynx. This trade would have the Sun relinquishing their first and second round picks in next year's draft. The acquisition of coveted players through the draft and free agency capped an offseason of change that had transformed a franchise for the future. Although the reconstruction of the Sun remained a work in progress, this talented class of prospects would serve as the foundation for a team that jumped back into contention quicker than anyone anticipated.|$|E
25|$|The series {{began on}} November 23, 1912 in Lincoln, NE. The game {{resulted}} in a 13–9 <b>Cornhusker</b> victory. Nebraska dominated the series until the 1942 season, going 16–3–3. Thereafter, the Sooners ran off sixteen consecutive victories, the longest streak in the series. The Sooners won nearly all of these games by substantial margins; only the 1947 and 1950 matches were competitive. Then, in 1959, an unranked Nebraska squad upset #19 Oklahoma, 25–21. In addition to ending the Cornhuskers' drought against the Sooners, this victory snapped Oklahoma's remarkable 74-game win streak against conference opponents. Through the 1960s and early 1970s, the two teams traded wins and losses, with each team going 6–6. Then, from 1972–1977, Oklahoma went on a six-game win streak. In 1978, #4 Nebraska upset #1 Oklahoma, 24–21. Less than two months later, however, the #4 Sooners defeated the #6 Cornhuskers in a rematch in the 1979 Orange Bowl. Later that year, Oklahoma defeated Nebraska again in the 1979 regular season. In the 1980s, the series was evenly split, with each team going 5–5. In 1990, an unranked Oklahoma team shocked #10 Nebraska, 45–10. The rest of the decade, however, decidedly belonged to the Cornhuskers. Nebraska went on a seven-game win streak, outgaining Oklahoma by a combined score of 265–61. This includes the 1997 game which Nebraska won 69-7, the most lopsided score {{in the history of}} the rivalry. With the expansion of the Big 8 Conference in 1996, thereby establishing the Big 12, the 1995 game actually marked the end of the series as an annual contest. (The 1996–97 games were incidental to Big 12 scheduling.) As Big 8 opponents, Nebraska and Oklahoma had played annually for 68 years, dating back to the 1928 season. The Big 12 Conference's two-division structure, with Nebraska in the North Division and Oklahoma in the South, presented a new era. After the 1997 game, the two teams did not meet again until 2000. From 2000–2009, they met seven times, with the Sooners going 5–2. The two teams met for the last time as conference opponents in the 2010 Big 12 Championship Game, in which #9 Oklahoma defeated #13 Nebraska, 23–20.|$|E
50|$|The Badgers {{would not}} see their next victory until 1974, 73 years after their first win. It wasn't until the Nebraska <b>Cornhuskers</b> left the Big 12 Conference and joined the Big Ten Conference in 2011 that the two {{programs}} would meet again across division lines. The <b>Cornhuskers</b> were in the Legends division and the Badgers the Leaders division. The two programs traded home wins with Wisconsin resoundingly defeating the <b>Cornhuskers</b> in their inaugural Big Ten game at Camp Randall in 2011 48-17. The <b>Cornhuskers</b> had the second-largest comeback in program history to defeat the Badgers at Memorial Stadium in the 2012 regular season 30-27. The two met again just over two months later in the 2012 Big Ten Football Championship Game where the unranked Badgers defeated the heavily favored #14 <b>Cornhuskers</b> at Lucas Oil Stadium 70-31.|$|R
50|$|Georgia outgained Nebraska 416-307 {{in total}} yards. The Bulldogs outgained the <b>Cornhuskers</b> 320-163 in passing yards, while the <b>Cornhuskers</b> outgained the Bulldogs 144-96 in rushing yards. The Bulldogs also made seven trips inside of Nebraska's 21-yard line.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Cornhuskers</b> {{opened the}} season and welcomed Coach Clark back with a win, the third {{straight}} over the Cyclones. The home opening victory snapped Nebraska's six-season opening game losing streak, and the <b>Cornhuskers</b> improved over Iowa State to 33-8-1.|$|R

500|$|The decade from 1990 to 2000 saw a {{significant}} rise in population from 191,972 to 225,581.

2500|$|Nebraska {{made the}} long journey to Eugene to face off against the Oregon Ducks for the first time, in a rare night time game. [...] Oregon was favored, and had a {{daunting}} aerial attack plan that put the <b>Cornhusker</b> defense to the test by rolling up 134 yards to Nebraska's 32 by air. [...] However, faced with a Nebraska rushing onslaught of 280 yards that dwarfed the 75 managed by the Ducks, Oregon was unable to step the string of points rolled off by the <b>Cornhusker</b> machine.

2500|$|Statistically, the Penn State contest {{looked like}} most of the others of 1952, as Nebraska outgained the Nittany Lions by ground 210-129. [...] The first half ended {{scoreless}} thanks to a stiff defensive <b>Cornhusker</b> effort that turned Penn State away empty-handed from inside the 20 yard line on three drives. [...] Penn State was the first to find success against Nebraska by air, actually producing points instead of simply winning the passing battle, as their 102-45 air advantage helped them finally punch in a touchdown in the third quarter before sealing the outcome with a late field goal. [...] It was the first <b>Cornhusker</b> loss of the season as the year now stood at 4-1, which was nonetheless the best beginning os a Nebraska football season since the 6-0 start in 1933. [...] With the loss handed down, the Cornhuskers slipped to 1-4 versus the Nittany Lions all-time.|$|E
2500|$|Nebraska met Kansas State in Manhattan to {{open the}} final <b>Cornhusker</b> Big 12 Conference slate.

[...] The Wildcat offense seemed to have success to start the game, marching down the field on their first possession, until they were stopped on a 4th-and-2 in the Nebraska red zone with no points to show for it. [...] The Blackshirts subsequently took control of the game defensively, notching their 13th straight game holding an opponent to 21 points or less and helping the Cornhuskers to hand Kansas State head coach Bill Snyder a home field loss, in the stadium named after him, on his 71st birthday. [...] The Nebraska win moved the Cornhuskers to 5–0 {{for the first time since}} 2003, and the series between the programs drew to a close with a Nebraska advantage of 78–15–2.|$|E

50|$|Iowa {{brought the}} <b>Cornhuskers</b> to Iowa City for Nebraska's second non-conference {{game of the}} year, and dealt {{a blow to the}} <b>Cornhuskers</b> with the help of {{repeated}} Nebraska miscues. Although Iowa allowed the first points of the game to be scored by Nebraska, {{the rest of the day}} belonged to the Hawkeyes. The <b>Cornhuskers</b> could have made it a game, but fumbles and stalled drives were too much to overcome, and their series lead slipped to 24-11-3.|$|R
50|$|The Kansas State Aggies gave Nebraska {{the biggest}} {{battle of the}} season, perhaps emboldened by nearly winning against the <b>Cornhuskers</b> in 1925 {{for the first time}} prior to {{settling}} for a tie that year. Somehow the <b>Cornhuskers</b> were able to hang onto the game and fight back. Repeatedly, Kansas State attempted field goals which were summarily blocked by Nebraska, and the <b>Cornhuskers</b> themselves were frequently on their heels and forced to punt out of trouble. Nebraska managed one field goal in the third quarter, which was the only score of the game for either side. Kansas State was sent back to Manhattan in disappointment and still winless against the <b>Cornhuskers</b> in eleven tries.|$|R
5|$|Texas first {{played the}} Nebraska <b>Cornhuskers</b> in 1933, and the Longhorns held a 7–4–0 record against Nebraska though 2006. As with Kansas State and Iowa State, Texas plays the <b>Cornhuskers</b> twoout of every fouryears {{as part of}} the Big 12 Conference schedule.|$|R
