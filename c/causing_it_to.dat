5|$|June 30, 2010– Hurricane Alex made {{landfall}} at Soto la Marina, Tamaulipas in Mexico {{as a large}} Category2 hurricane, bringing heavy rains, wind, and tornadoes to South Texas. The hurricane's remnants {{also bring}} heavy rains to portions of the Rio Grande, <b>causing</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> exceed record levels.|$|E
5|$|Mike {{continues}} to blast the shark with the impulses, <b>causing</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> leap {{out of the}} water again, igniting the bomb as Ellen steers the sailboat towards the shark while thinking back to Sean's demise, the shark's attack on Thea, and when her husband killed the first shark. The broken bowsprit impales the shark in the exact spot where the bomb is, <b>causing</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> explode on impact. The shark's corpse then sinks {{to the bottom of the}} sea. Mike then hears Jake calling for help, seriously injured, but alive and conscious, floating in the water. The four survive the harsh encounter and make it back to land. Hoagie then flies Ellen back to Amity Island.|$|E

5000|$|Wave 8: ScrubsThe final wave {{consists}} of diagonally-moving formations of small blue objects called [...] "Scrubs". Shooting a Scrub will <b>cause</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> break formation and slowly fall.

5000|$|The {{most common}} {{example is a}} screw. In most screws, {{applying}} torque to the shaft can <b>cause</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> turn, moving the shaft linearly to do work against a load, but no amount of axial load force against the shaft will <b>cause</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> turn backwards.|$|R

5|$|Congress of the People (COPE), {{is led by}} Mosiuoa Lekota, {{although}} the leadership is disputed by Mbhazima Shilowa who continues to battle for recognition in the High Court. The party has been riven by infighting, <b>causing</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> lose much of its support and resulting {{in the formation of}} a splinter group, the United Congress. COPE won three seats in the National Assembly in the 2014 elections.|$|E

5|$|In Bellefleur, Oregon, Detective Miles {{drives to}} the scene of a {{reported}} air crash in the forest. As Miles arrives, his car's electricity cuts out, <b>causing</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> crash. After exiting the vehicle, an injured Miles finds his deputy sheriff, Ray Hoese, unconscious in his police cruiser. Miles is suddenly confronted by a man identical to Hoese who is bleeding green fluid, indicating he is an Alien Bounty Hunter.|$|E
5|$|In South Korea, {{two people}} were killed with two others {{reported}} missing. A South Korean freighter rode out the storm at the port in Hakata Bay. It breached along the breakwater, <b>causing</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> sink, killing all 10crew members. The Japan Coast Guard launched a search and rescue mission for two days.|$|E
5|$|Marine {{molluscs}} such as sea hares, cuttlefish, squid and octopuses {{give themselves}} a {{last chance to}} escape by distracting their attackers. To do this, they eject a mixture of chemicals, which may mimic food or otherwise confuse predators. In response to a predator, animals in these groups release ink, creating a cloud, and opaline, affecting the predator's feeding senses, <b>causing</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> attack the cloud.|$|E
50|$|Induced paths are induced subgraphs {{that are}} paths. The {{shortest}} path between any two vertices in an unweighted graph {{is always an}} induced path, because any additional edges between pairs of vertices that could <b>cause</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> be not induced would also <b>cause</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> be not shortest. Conversely, in distance-hereditary graphs, every induced path is a shortest path.|$|R

5|$|Model's true {{opinion on}} the value of the {{offensive}} remains unclear. Manstein took his recommendation at face value, while Guderian said that he was categorically against attacking. It has similarly been suggested that Model, in fact, hoped to scuttle the operation by <b>causing</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> be delayed until the Soviet forces launched their own attack.|$|E
5|$|Mount Elbert is {{composed}} largely of quartzite. However, the summit ridge consists of metamorphic basement rock, which is Pre-Cambrian in origin and about 1.7 billion years old. There are various igneous intrusions including pegmatite, {{as well as}} bands of gneiss and schist. Unlike mountains of similar altitude elsewhere, Elbert lacks both a permanent snowpack and a prominent north-facing cirque, which {{can be attributed to}} its position among other mountains of similar height, <b>causing</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> receive relatively small quantities of precipitation.|$|E
5|$|On October 18, 2006, the MX Series was {{publicly}} announced. Before its release, Ethernet aggregation was {{a missing}} component of Juniper's edge network products, which was <b>causing</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> lose market-share to Alcatel. The MX Series was late to market, {{but it was}} well received by analysts and customers. It {{was part of a}} trend at-the-time to incorporate additional software features in routers and switches.|$|E
5000|$|The causative {{morpheme}} {{can also}} be used recursively to generate indefinitely long words that are grammatically valid. This morpheme shows quite some irregularity, taking one of six forms depending on the verb root. Otherwise it alternates between -DIr (D=d or t, I=ı,i,u or ü) and -t depending on the preceding letter. piş-ir-di-ler = they cooked it piş-ir-t-ti-ler = they <b>caused</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> be cooked (they had it cooked) [...] piş-ir-t-tir-di-ler = they <b>caused</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> be <b>caused</b> to be cooked (they had someone have it cooked) piş-ir-t-tir-t-ti-ler = they <b>caused</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> be <b>caused</b> to be caused to be cooked (they had someone have someone have it cooked) piş-ir-t-tir-t-tir-di-ler = they <b>caused</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> be <b>caused</b> to be caused to be caused to be cooked (they had someone have someone have someone have it cooked)Multiple usage of this suffix is rare, but there is no theoretical reason to put a limit to its use.|$|R

5|$|Raven fought Sean Waltman in a Clockwork Orange House of Fun match. A Clockwork Orange House of Fun {{match is}} held under no {{disqualification}} rules, involving multiple types of weapons including {{part of a}} steel cage. Waltman scored a near-fall after jumping off the pillars holding up the cage and performing a somersault leg drop onto Raven through a table. Raven won the bout after throwing Waltman into the cage <b>causing</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> collapse, Raven then followed with a pinfall victory at thirteen minutes.|$|E
5|$|The crew {{notice that}} Geiger {{has set the}} ship to crash into an oil tanker {{off the coast of}} Saint Martin. Alex decides to stop the ship by diving {{underneath}} it and jamming the propeller with a steel cable. Geiger realizes Alex is trying to stop the ship, so he jams the cable winch while Alex is underwater, <b>causing</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> break off the ship and free the cable. Geiger takes Annie hostage and escapes with her on a boat from the ship's stern.|$|E
5|$|The {{explosion}} {{was caused}} by a gas leak in a 30-year-old building. It severely damaged a nearby nine-story apartment building, <b>causing</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> collapse. Mónica Fein, mayor of Rosario, asked residents to avoid the area because of the risk that more buildings might collapse, and to ease the work of disaster management personnel. The streets were covered with broken glass from damaged buildings. Gas and electricity were immediately disconnected, and the national government sent an Argentine Federal Police task force to the scene.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the centre}} {{and the eastern}} {{parts of the country}} are mostly flat, the west is mountainous. Both the Andes and Sierras Pampeanas affect the climate of Argentina, leading to {{differences}} in temperature, pressure, and spatial distribution of precipitation depending on the topography and altitude. Here, the Andes exert an important influence on the climate. Owing to the higher altitudes of the Andes north of 40oS, they completely block the normal westerly flow, preventing low pressure systems containing moisture from the Pacific Ocean from coming in. Thus, much of Argentina north of 40oS is dominated by wind circulation patterns from the South Atlantic High. South of 40oS, the Andes are lower in altitude, allowing much of Patagonia to be dominated by westerly winds and air masses from the Pacific Ocean. However, the north–south orientation of the Andes creates a barrier for humid air masses originating from the Pacific Ocean. This is because they force these air masses upwards, cooling adiabactically. Most of the moisture is dropped on the Chilean side, causing abundant precipitation and cloudiness while on the Argentine side, the air warms adiabatically, <b>causing</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> become drier as it descends. Thus, an extensive rain–shadow is present in much of Patagonia, <b>causing</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> receive very little precipitation. The Sierras Pampeanas influences the climate on a much smaller scale than the Andes.|$|E
5|$|Another {{possible}} {{mechanism for}} the formation of planetesimals is the streaming instability in which the drag felt by particles orbiting through gas creates a feedback effect causing the growth of local concentrations. These local concentration push back on the gas creating a region where the headwind felt by the particles is smaller. The concentration is thus able to orbit faster and undergoes less radial drift. Isolated particles join these concentrations as they are overtaken or as they drift inward <b>causing</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> grow in mass. Eventually these concentrations form massive filaments which fragment and undergo gravitational collapse forming planetesimals the size of the larger asteroids.|$|E
5|$|As {{the wave}} {{breaches}} the Himalayas and approaches the site, an impact driver lodges in the ark-door gears, keeping a boarding gate open and preventing the ship's engines from starting. In the ensuing chaos where many people attempt {{to board the}} ships, Yuri, Tamara and Gordon are killed, Tenzin is injured, Ark 4 begins filling with water and is set adrift after Air Force One crashes into one of its supports, while also <b>causing</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> skim the hull of Ark 6 before drifting off. With Jackson and Noah's help, {{the crew of the}} Ark manages to regain control of the Ark narrowly before it fatally smashes into Mount Everest.|$|E
