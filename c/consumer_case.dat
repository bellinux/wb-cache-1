Only through deinstitutionalization in the last 20 to 30 years have mental health consumers, who were long-term residents of state psychiatric hospitals, been {{given the opportunity to}} be a part of connnunity life again. Deinstitutionalization is a recent policy movement.

We propose an efficient view interpolation and rendering algorithm at the receiver side based on texture+depth data representation, which can operate with a limited amount of views. We study the main artifacts that occur during rendering-occlusions, and we quantify them first for a synthetic model and then for real-world biomedical data. The experimental results allow us to quantify the peak signal-to-noise ratio for rendered texture and depth as well as the amount of disoccluded pixels {{as a function of the}} angle between surrounding cameras...|$|E

The vertically integrated state-owned company had a legally established monopoly on the generation, transmission and distribution of electricity in Turkey. With the support and encouragement of international organizations like the World Bank, Turkey has initiated a comprehensive program to liberalize and privatize the electricity market in 2001. The liberalization of the electricity market in Turkey started in the distribution side of the market. The distribution network was divided into 21 distribution regions and in each of these, separate - initially state-owned - distribution companies have been authorized to distribute and sell electricity. The plan envisaged to complete privatization of all distribution companies until the end of 2006. This study compares the welfare implication of privatization of the distribution networks by comparing two extreme cases, a pure regional distributional monopoly case and a representative pure "free" <b>consumer</b> <b>case,</b> with a benchmark case of administered price regulation. For this purpose, we develop a simulation model of the Turkish electricity system, and use the data on generation and distribution costs.

Due to the increased risk of the disease and its related complications, in addition to the harmless properties of sesame seeds, this research was aimed to study the effect of consuming sesame seeds on some biochemical factors in type 2 diabetic patients. Materials & Methods: This clinical trial has been carried out on 60 type 2 diabetic patients who were randomly divided into two groups of 30 sesame seeds <b>consumers</b> (<b>case)</b> and 30 non sesame seeds <b>consumers</b> (control). The <b>case</b> group was given 60 grams sesame seeds per day for 2 months and the control group did not receive any sesame seeds. The patient information was collected by questionnaire. The fasting blood serum of patients at the beginning and the end of the testing were collected and the biochemical factors of this study were measured in laboratory. For the data analysis, two independent samples t-test and paired t-test were used. Results: In this study, the mean ± SD (Standard Deviation) of the patients’ ages in the two groups, sesame seeds <b>consumers</b> (<b>case)</b> and non sesame seeds consumers (control), was 72 / 5 ± 40 / 52 and 11 / 6 ± 00 / 56 years, respectively.

The kernel fat that lies between the Spinalis dorsi and the Longissimus thoracis was removed. The Infraspinatus was cut open and the heavy connective tissue removed. A 0. 5 % dry-sprinkle application of Activa[]TG-RM/sodium caseinate mixture was applied. Steaks from both the ribeye and the top blade were assigned randomly to: 1) in-home sensory evaluation; 2) raw chemical analysis; or 3) cooked chemical analysis. Both the raw and cooked steaks were dissected into separable lean, fat, connective tissue, and inseparable tissue. Chemical analyses were conducted to determine percent moisture, fat, and protein content, and results were determined for protein calories, fat calories, and total calories. In addition, twenty-four beef lip-on, ribeye rolls and twenty beef top blade roasts were used for a consumer retail case study. Results showed treatment affected percent dissectible lean, fat calories, and total calories for all cuts (P 0. 05) percent chemical moisture, fat, and protein of the cooked top blade steaks, and did not affect percent chemical moisture and fat for the raw top blade. In-home sensory evaluations showed that consumers rated Activa[] TG-RM formed steaks higher for leanness. However, treated ribeyes did not show a difference for color, overall appearance, tenderness, juiciness, flavor, and overall like/dislike. Consumers rated treated top blade steaks higher for all sensory characteristics. <b>Consumer</b> <b>case</b> study data suggested that consumers chose treated ribeyes over control ribeyes due to leanness, and treated top blade steaks over controls because of perceived marbling.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} divided into two parts. Part I deals with demand management. For goods with no substitutes, under supply constraints, {{fairness}} considerations introduce negative externalities and lead to a market failure. One example of such a good with no substitutes is water. In case of a market failure, it is necessary to design coordination mechanisms called contracts which provide the right incentives for coordination. As “repetition can yield coordination”, the aim in this part is to design price based dynamic demand management contracts which, under supply constraints, mitigate the market failure. In these contracts, we consider complete information settings; and use the status quo proposition as a fairness criterion for designing them. The contracts are designed as almost noncooperative dynamic games, within the agency theory framework, where the agent (the consumer) is induced to consume at a specified consumption level based on the incentive mechanism offered by the principal (the producer). These contracts use the solution concept of sub-game perfect Nash equilibrium (SPNE) to compute the price (mal-incentive) that acts as a credible threat for deviation from the specified consumption level. In these contracts, unlike the dynamic contracts with asymmetric information, the penalty for deviation is proportional to the amount of deviation. First, we consider a two-period demand management contract for a single consumer satisfying the status quo proposition. Under the assumption that the gain to the consumer and the loss to the producer by deviation is small, the contract is shown to be economically efficient. It is shown that, in the finite horizon, a fair demand management contract cannot be efficient. The demand management contract is homeomorphic to finite horizon alternating bargaining model. In the finite horizon alternating bargaining model, there is a unique SPNE, in which the player who offers last is always at an advantageous position. In the two-period contract, the assumption considered attenuates the last mover advantage and leads to the efficiency. We have shown that one possible way to achieve efficiency, without the assumption, is to make the agents uncertain about the period of interaction. This possibility can be included in an infinite horizon contract. Hence, next, we design an infinite horizon contract for a single consumer. It is proved that this contract is economically efficient and provides revenue sufficiency. The sensitivity analysis of the contract shows that the discounting rate measures the aversion to conservation characteristics of the consumer. The analysis of the contract shows that a sufficiently time-patient consumer is not penalized for the deviation, as the consumer himself is aware of conservation requirements. This result is similar to the results for the present-biased preferences in behavioral economics. Lastly, the infinite horizon contract is extended to two consumers case which internalizes the externality a consumer causes to another. In the two <b>consumer</b> <b>case,</b> consumers are strategically noninteracting; and it is shown that the producer acts as a budget balancer. These contracts are also shown to be economically efficient. The demand management contracts achieve both the procedural and end-state fairness. Also, the infinite horizon contracts are homeomorphic to infinite horizon alternating bargaining model. The efficiency of infinite horizon contracts is due to their homeomorphism with the alternating bargaining process as they exhaust all possible mutual gains from exchange. In the two-period model, the bargaining process is constrained and hence all possible mutual gains are not eliminated, leading to the inefficiency. In part II of the thesis, we discuss the notions of exchangeability in the Shapley value. The Shapley value is a probabilistic value for the transferable utility (TU) cooperative games, in which each player subjectively assigns probabilities to the events which define their positions in the game. In this part, the objective have been to explore the aspect of subjective probability which leads to the uniqueness of the Shapley value. This aspect of subjective probability is known as exchangeability. We derive the Shapley value using de Finetti’s theorem. We also show that, in the Shapley value, each player’s prospects of joining a t-player game as the last member of the game is a moment sequence of the uniquely determined uniform distribution. We stress on finite exchangeability; and deduce that, with finite exchangeability, the Shapley value is the only value in which the probability assignment is a unique mixture of independent and identical distributions. It is concluded that, in both the finite and infinite exchangeable cases, the uniqueness of probability assignment in the Shapley value is due to exchangeability and the mixing with the uniform distribution...|$|E
