5000|$|In image {{processing}} and computer vision, [...] suggest applying the curve-shortening {{flow to the}} outline of a shape derived from a digital image, in order to remove noise from the shape and provide a scale space that provides a simplified description of the shape at different levels of resolution.The method of Mokhtarian and Mackworth involves computing the curve-shortening flow, tracking the inflection points of the curve as they progress through the flow, and drawing a graph that plots the positions of the inflection points around the curve against the time parameter. The inflection points will typically be removed from the curve in pairs as the curve becomes convex (according to the Gage-Hamilton-Grayson theorem) and the lifetime of a pair of points corresponds to the salience of a feature of the shape.Because of the resampled <b>convolution</b> <b>method</b> that they describe for computing a numerical approximation of the curve-shortening flow, they call their method the resampled curvature scale space.
