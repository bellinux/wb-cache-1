60|$|Having said thus {{much about}} my manner of writing, I will add {{that with my}} large books I spend {{a good deal of}} time over the general {{arrangement}} of the matter. I first make the rudest outline in two or three pages, and then a larger one in several pages, a few words or one word standing for a whole discussion or series of facts. Each one of these headings is again enlarged and often transferred before I begin to write in extenso. As in several of my books facts observed by others have been very extensively used, and as I have always had several quite distinct subjects in hand at the same time, I may mention that I keep from thirty to forty large portfolios, in cabinets with labelled shelves, into which I can at once put a detached reference or memorandum. I have bought many books, and at their ends I make an index of all the facts that concern my work; or, if the book is not my own, write out a separate abstract, and of such abstracts I have a large drawer full. Before beginning on any subject I look to all the short indexes and make a general and <b>classified</b> <b>index,</b> and by taking the one or more proper portfolios I have all the information collected during my life ready for use.|$|E

50|$|A {{friendship}} with Robert Cadell {{caused him to}} be chosen to catalogue Sir Walter Scott's library at Abbotsford.

References to passages in Scott's writings connected with the books throw light on Scott's literary history. The first catalogue of the London Library (1842) was issued by Cochrane. In 1847 an enlarged edition of the catalogue appeared, and a short time before his death a supplementary volume, in which a general <b>classified</b> <b>index</b> is announced.|$|E
5000|$|The [...] "Index Alphabeticus" [...] {{the first}} catalog {{compiled}} by James, {{which consisted of}} 8,700 entries, appeared in July 1605. It was dedicated to Henry Frederick, Prince of Wales, {{at the suggestion of}} Bodley (who thought that 'more reward was to be gained from the prince than from the king'). It includes both printed books and manuscripts, arranged alphabetically under the four classes of theology, medicine, law, and arts. A continuation of this <b>classified</b> <b>index,</b> embracing writers on arts and sciences, geography and history, {{is to be found in}} Rawlinson MS. Miscell. 730, drawn up by James after quitting the library. An alphabetical catalogue prepared by him in 1613 was not printed, but remained in the library. A second edition of the catalogue appeared in 1620. It abandoned the classified arrangement of the former catalogue, and adopts only one alphabet of names. There was also issued in 1635 'Catalogus Interpretum S. Scripturæ juxta numerorum ordinem qui extant in Bibliotheca Bodleiana olim a D. Jamesio … concinnatus, nunc vero altera fere parte auctior redditus. … Editio correcta,' Oxford. In 1604, Bodley noted some errors James had made in cataloguing the Hebrew manuscripts, suggesting that James should check with scholars fluent in Hebrew.|$|E

5000|$|The UDC was {{developed}} by the Belgian bibliographers Paul Otlet and Henri La Fontaine {{at the end of the}} 19th century. In 1885, they created Universal Bibliographic Repertory (Répertoire Bibliographique Universel) (RBU) which was intended to become a comprehensive <b>classified</b> <b>index</b> to all published information. The idea that the RBU should take the form of a card catalogue came from the young American zoologist Herbert Haviland Field who was at the time himself setting up a bibliographical agency in Zurich, the Concilium Bibliographicum. A means of arranging the entries would be needed, and Otlet, having heard of Dewey Decimal Classification wrote to Melvil Dewey and obtained permission to translate it into French. The idea outgrew the plan of mere translation, and a number of radical innovations were made, adapting the purely enumerative classification (in which all the subjects envisaged are already listed and coded) into one which allows for synthesis (that is, the construction of compound numbers to denote interrelated subjects that could never be exhaustively foreseen); various possible relations between subjects were identified, and symbols assigned to represent them. In its first edition in French [...] "Manuel du Répertoire bibliographique universel" [...] (1905), the UDC already included many features that were revolutionary in the context of knowledge classifications: tables of generally applicable (aspect-free) concepts—called common auxiliary tables; a series of special auxiliary tables with specific but re-usable attributes in a particular field of knowledge; an expressive notational system with connecting symbols and syntax rules to enable coordination of subjects and the creation of a documentation language proper.|$|E
