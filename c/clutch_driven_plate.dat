With {{the help}} of the {{orthogonal}} experiment and the friction-wear mechanism by car as the research object of the <b>clutch</b> <b>driven</b> platen friction <b>plate</b> of Chongqing Changan CX 20 auto power take-off installation, the optimization of clutch friction materials is studied. It was selected for the resin-base fiber materials of <b>clutch</b> <b>driven</b> platen to be commonly used in auto mechanical manufacture. It was analyzed for the abrasion mechanism of the <b>clutch</b> <b>driven</b> platen friction <b>plate</b> between the flywheel and the pressure plate,and discussed for the relationship of driven platen friction-plate heat recession-performance and the <b>driven</b> <b>plate</b> material at high temperature. The results show that the friction factor of the optimized driven platen lining materials do not change. In the process of the frequent friction heating to high temperature, the stability of the optimized driven platen lining materials is strong, the wear of those is reduced, and the optimized driven platen lining materials have good performance of high temperature-thermal recession...|$|R

40|$|This study {{introduces}} {{a new concept}} of portable air conditioner which integrated with some available components in automotive air conditioning system. This new idea intends to solve the storage problems {{as well as to}} reduce the price of current portable air conditioner since some devices could directly be used from the automotive air conditioning system.

25|$|In DCTs {{where the}} two {{clutches}} are arranged concentrically, the larger outer <b>clutch</b> <b>drives</b> the odd-numbered gears and the smaller inner <b>clutch</b> <b>drives</b> the even-numbered gears. Shifts can be accomplished without interrupting torque distribution to the driven roadwheels, by applying the engine's torque to one clutch {{at the same time}} as it is being disconnected from the other clutch. Since alternate gear ratios can preselect an odd gear on one gear shaft while the vehicle is being driven in an even gear (and vice versa), DCTs are the fastest-shifting road car transmission available and are even able to shift faster than a professional racing driver using a manual transmission. DCTs can even shift more quickly than cars equipped with single-clutch automated-manual transmissions (AMTs), also called single-clutch semiautomatics. Also, with a DCT, shifts can be made more smoothly than with a single-clutch AMT, making a DCT more suitable for conventional road cars.|$|R

It is a device used to connect the driving shaft to a driven shaft, so that the driven shaft may be started or stopped at will, without stopping the driving shaft.
