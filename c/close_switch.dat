There is a growing tendency to use environmentally friendly gases such as air, oxygen, nitrogen or their mixtures in such devices instead of the traditional insulating gaseous switching medium, sulphur hexafluoride, due to its high cost and the environmental issues associated with this gas. The present study {{is focused on the}} analysis of performance of self-breakdown plasma <b>closing</b> <b>switch</b> with corona pre-ionisation electrodes.

In most applications this is achieved by fast <b>closing</b> <b>switches</b> operating in parallel to the klystron path. These switches are known as crowbars. Most commonly used crowbar switches are sparkgaps, thyratrons and ignitrons. Recent progress {{in the development of}} high power semiconductors introduces the possibility to apply semiconductor <b>closing</b> <b>switches</b> as crowbars. The most promising approach is the application of the Light Triggered Thyristor (LTT). This especially is interesting for high power high voltage dc installations, like hvdc klystron power supplies with appropriate protection requirements. This paper describes a solution using series connected LTTs as a <b>closing</b> crowbar <b>switch.</b> Static and dynamic behaviour of the thyristors are introduced. The special requirements regarding the crowbar applications are pointed out.

40|$|When {{operating}} gas-filled plasma <b>closing</b> <b>switches,</b> {{the most}} commonly used dielectric gas is sulphur hexafluoride (SF 6) due to its desirable and advanced dielectric properties. In recent years, concerns over the impact of SF 6 on the environment and its contributions to the global greenhouse effect [1], as well as the continual rise in the cost of acquiring SF 6 [2] has led to a desire within the pulsed power community to find an alternative switching medium to replace SF 6, [3]. The main concern over replacing SF 6 is that plasma <b>closing</b> <b>switches</b> filled with any replacement gas must have similar performance parameters to the SF 6 –filled switches, e. g. parameters such as the DC breakdown voltage and the triggered breakdown voltage, jitter and breakdown voltage spread, the recovery of the switch and the energy losses [4]. This paper presents results obtained for DC breakdown tests in a self-breakdown switch with an adjustable inter-electrode gap that has been filled with argon, nitrogen, atmospheric air and an argon/oxygen mixture at different pressures. As a result of the experimental work conducted, the characteristics of the plasma <b>closing</b> <b>switches</b> filled with different gases have been obtained and compared to previous work carried out [5] as well as compared with the characteristics of commonly used SF 6 –filled switches. Initial development of the model of a plasma <b>closing</b> <b>switch</b> has been developed which will be developed so that the model can be used for characterising the performance of different pulsed power systems and for optimization of current systems in order to improve their performance parameters e. g. decrease jitter and pre-fire rate, generate tailored wave-forms and improve overall stability of operation...|$|R

The circuit that a high-voltage pulse is sharpened by {{an opening}} <b>switch</b> and a <b>closing</b> <b>switch</b> is designed. The electric exploding wire switch (EEOS) is adopted as the opening switch to steepen pulse primarily. When the EEOS explodes, the voltage {{passes through the}} gas switch which is used as the <b>closing</b> <b>switch</b> ， and then is sharpened to high-voltage pulse on the terminal load. This high-voltage and high-current circuit is simulated by steps with the software PSPICE.

40|$|Corona-stabilised plasma <b>closing</b> <b>switches,</b> {{filled with}} {{electronegative}} gases such as SF 6 and air, {{have been used}} in pulsed-power applications as repetitive switching devices for the last 10 years. Their high repetition-rate capabilities coupled with their relatively simple design and construction have made them suitable alternatives to thyratrons and semi-conductor switches. As well as having repetitive switching capabilities, corona-stabilised plasma <b>closing</b> <b>switches</b> have the potential to operate at elevated voltages through the incorporation of multiple electrode sets. This allows high-voltage operation with inherent voltage grading between the electrodes. A further feature of such switches is that they can have relatively low jitter under triggered condition. This paper reports on some of the operational features of a new design of corona-stabilised, cascade switch that utilises air as the insulating gas. At pressures between 0 and 1 bar gauge the switch has be shown to operate over the voltage range of 40 to 100 kV with a jitter below 2 ns...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—A {{soft-landing}} actuation waveform {{was designed}} to reduce the bounce of a single-pole single-throw (SPST) ohmic radio frequency (RF) microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) switch during actuation. The waveform consisted of an actuation voltage pulse, a coast time, and a hold voltage. The actuation voltage pulse had a short duration relative to the transition time of the switch and imparted the kinetic energy necessary to <b>close</b> the <b>switch.</b> After the actuation pulse was stopped, damping and restoring forces slowed the switch to near-zero velocity as it approached the closed position. This {{is referred to as}} the coast time. The hold voltage was applied upon reaching closure to keep the switch from opening. An ideal waveform would <b>close</b> the <b>switch</b> with near zero impact velocity. The switch dynamics resulting from an ideal waveform were modeled using finite element methods and measured using laser Doppler vibrometry. The ideal waveform <b>closed</b> the <b>switch</b> with an impact velocity of less than 3 cm/s without rebound. Variations in the soft-landing waveform <b>closed</b> the <b>switch</b> with impact velocities of 12. 5 cm/s with rebound amplitudes ranging from 75 to 150 nm compared to impact velocities of 22. 5 cm/s and rebound amplitudes of 150 to 200 nm for a step waveform.

40|$|Ultrafast plasma <b>closing</b> <b>switches</b> rely on sub-nanosecond {{electrical}} {{breakdown of the}} insulating gas. Until recently, little information was available on gas breakdown occurring within this timescale, because of the difficulties in designing an experimental system for such a study. Recently published papers have reported {{on the results of}} studies carried out using two devices designed specifically for the investigation of fast (sub-nanosecond) {{electrical breakdown}} processes. The devices are essentially modified transmission line plasma <b>closing</b> <b>switches,</b> and in this paper we describe their structure and operation. Because electromagnetic wave behaviour plays a significant role in sub-nanosecond switching, especially reflections from impedance mismatches, the design of the devices is based on transmission line concepts, rather than those of lumped parameters. One of the switches has a conical transmission line topology and is designed for the study of fast switch closure at insulating gas pressures less than 0. 6 MPa. The second has a hybrid radial transmission line/conical transmission line topology and is designed for the study of fast switch closure at pressures up to 10 MPa. The paper also includes details of the D-dot monitors used to investigate sub-nanosecond processes in the two transmission line plasma devices...|$|R
