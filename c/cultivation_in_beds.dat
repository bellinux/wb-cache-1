40|$|ABSTRACT The {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to evaluate the meteorological elements of the environments and the production components of mini tomato crop in organic system in different forms of cultivation, biofertilizer doses and technological levels of protected environments. The research was conducted in completely randomized design in a 3 x 2 x 5 factorial scheme, corresponding to three greenhouses (A - climatized, B - mobile screen and C - fixed screen), two forms of cultivation (pots and beds) and five doses of a commercial biofertilizer (0, 50, 100, 150 and 200 % of dose indicated), with five replicates. The treatments affected the analyzed variables, except for biofertilizer doses and interaction of treatments. Air temperature was unchanged among the environments and the mean and minimum relative humidity were within the control range in the climatized greenhouse. The greenhouse with mobile screen showed the best production results for the <b>cultivation</b> <b>in</b> <b>beds</b> and the biofertilizer doses were indifferent for all treatments...|$|E
40|$|Marketing the inflorescences of Comanthera elegans (Bong.) L. R. Parra & Giul. {{represents}} {{a source of}} income to many families from extractives communities in {{the portion of the}} Espinhaço Range located in the state of Minas Gerais, Brazil. Cultivating this species stands out by allying income generation with conservation since the species is currently endangered. This study aimed to assess aspects of the development of C. elegans in three cultivation systems: beds, rows, and whole area. Sowing took place in January 2009 and the inflorescences were harvested in May 2010, which characterized the experimental period. Emergence; plant density; rates of flowering, mortality, resprouting, and recruiting of new individuals; and production of inflorescences per plant and per area were assessed. Emergence began approximately 50 days after sowing. Plant density ranged from 130 to 350 plants. m- 2 among the three cultivation systems. The highest mortality rate (18 %) was observed {{at the peak of the}} dry season (August) and the overall mortality rate over one reproductive cycle was 49 %. Of the plants that lost the aerial part, 36 % resprouted. Sprouting and seed germination accounted for 30 and 3 % of the recruiting of new individuals, respectively. C. elegans had two bloom (AprilMay 2009 and April-May 2010) : 5. 4 % of the plants bloomed in the first season and 78 %, in the second. Each plant produced between three and 178 inflorescences and the highest inflorescence production in terms of weight (232 g. m- 2) and number (2, 910 inflorescences. m- 2) was observed in the <b>cultivation</b> <b>in</b> <b>beds</b> at 1, 624 kg. ha- 1...|$|E
50|$|There are <b>cultivations</b> <b>in</b> {{the river}} <b>beds</b> and banks which are deterimental to biodiversity. The {{practice}} accelerates siltation and the rivers will eventually dry up.

5|$|Sewage outfalls {{into the}} lake are {{proposed}} to be completely stopped by the interception and diversion of feeder lines. Lining the main feeders {{into the lake}} and setting up water treatment plants to continuously treat and recirculate the lake water are also envisioned. Conservation measures proposed for adoption to clean the lake are by way of desilting and deweeding, water treatment at inlet of feeders into the lake, construction of check dams, conservation of ghats, afforestation of denuded hills in the catchment, soil moisture conservation measures, stabilization of sand dunes by planting vegetation of suitable species of plants and restriction of <b>cultivation</b> <b>in</b> the <b>bed</b> of feeder channels. In addition, the institutional measures considered for effecting improvement of the lake are mass awareness programmes with the population's participation {{as well as the}} control of fish proliferation {{to reduce the risk of}} death of fishes during periods of inadequate water depth in the lake.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{highlights}} some interventions {{which might}} alleviate agricultural pressures on steep slopes and reduce land degradation {{in parts of}} the Ethiopian Highlands. The Ethiopian highlands are losing alarming amounts of soils (estimated at more than one billion, 1000 million, tonnes) annually. This loss, which is associated with nutrient losses, is manifest in declining agricultural production and biodiversity. About 80 percent of the annual soil loss occurs from croplands during the rainy season. The nutrient imbalance is further accentuated by forest clearing, removal of crop residue from cultivated lands, and little use of chemical fertilizers or organic manure. Even where livestock are part of the production system, dung is preferentially used as a cooking fuel. Chemical fertilizers are costly, and therefore an alternative land-management scheme is suggested. This is based on a new land-shaping device for drainage which is called the BBM (broad-bed maker), and growing forage legumes to improve soil nutrients, which should allow intensive <b>cultivation</b> of Vertisols <b>in</b> the Ethiopian Highlands. Adoption of the broad bed and furrow land-management system would facilitate early planting and increase the yield of both grain and straw from the major crops relative to the yield from traditional <b>cultivation</b> <b>in</b> flat <b>beds.</b> While not decreasing the yield of grain, mixed cropping of grain and forage crops has been shown to give significantly greater total crop residue yields. The yield is even greater when fertilizers are applied. Supplementary irrigation can help in utilizing Vertisols on bottom lands, and this can be expedited by constructing water reservoirs...|$|R
40|$|The present {{experiment}} was conducted {{within the framework}} of randomized completed block design (RCBD) with 6 treatments and 4 replications in the research greenhouse of the educational farm in Islamic Azad University, Jiroft branch to investigate the impact of organic fertilizers on yield of greenhouse organic cucumber crops. The treatments included: (1) compost+poultry manure; (2) compost+cow manure; (3) poultry manure+compost+biological nitroxin fertilizer; (4) cow manure +compost +biological nitroxin fertilizer; (5) cow manure+compost+poultry manure+biological nitroxin fertilizer and finally (6) the control (regional custom and routine). The findings indicated that many growth and yield parameters at p< 0. 01 were significantly affected by the <b>cultivation</b> <b>beds.</b> <b>In</b> general, the results indicated that due to their considerable performance, the mixed bed of compost, poultry manure, cow manure, and biologic fertilizer led to an increase in cucumber yield and could be utilized as the proper bed to produce greenhouse organic cucumber...|$|R
30|$|The {{nutrient}} concentration in dracaena leaves {{was within the}} presented range as shown by Denis et al. (2003), denoting the effectiveness of nutrient range for plant growth. Lack of significant potassium level changes in treatments using peanut shell compost {{may be due to}} a higher yield of dry leaf matter in these treatments, compared to the control. In fact, potassium uptake occurred in plants, but the higher yield of plants and the dilution effect indicated no observable difference from the control. Additionally, in most cases, concentration variations did not follow from the values of these elements <b>in</b> the <b>cultivation</b> <b>beds.</b> <b>In</b> terms of {{nutrient concentration}} in plant organs, these depended on different factors such as plant growth, ionic competition and deposition; therefore, sometimes it is impossible to use nutrient concentrations in plants as a reliable parameter for assessing plant growth. The impact of nutrient dilution resulting in additional yields can also give rise to confusion. In this regard, nutrient uptake by plants from growth media is considered a more reliable parameter.|$|R
