50|$|Aminosteroids are a {{group of}} steroids with a similar {{structure}} based on an amino-substituted steroid nucleus. They are neuromuscular blocking agents, acting as competitive antagonists of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR), and block the signaling of acetylcholine in the nervous system. These drugs include <b>candocuronium</b> <b>iodide</b> (chandonium iodide), dacuronium bromide, dihydrochandonium, dipyrandium, malouetine, pancuronium bromide, pipecuronium bromide, rapacuronium bromide, rocuronium bromide, stercuronium iodide, and vecuronium bromide.|$|E
50|$|<b>Candocuronium</b> <b>iodide</b> (INN, {{formerly}} chandonium, HS-310) is an aminosteroid neuromuscular-blocking drug or {{skeletal muscle}} relaxant {{in the category}} of non-depolarizing neuromuscular-blocking drugs. Its potential adjunctive use in anesthesia to facilitate endotracheal intubation and to provide skeletal muscle relaxation during surgery or mechanical ventilation was briefly evaluated in clinical studies in India, but further development discontinued because of attendant cardiovasular effects, primarily tachycardia that was no worse than but also not an improvement over the clinically established pancuronium bromide. Candocuronium demonstrated a short duration and a rapid onset of action, with little or no ganglion blocking activity, and it was only slightly less potent than pancuronium.|$|E
50|$|His {{scientific}} {{research has been}} in organic chemistry, medicinal chemistry and natural products. Nearly 50 master and doctoral theses have been completed under his supervision. There have been published 125 original {{scientific research}} papers. 14 patents have been obtained. His research group {{has been successful in}} designing a clinically useful drug <b>candocuronium</b> <b>iodide</b> (INN) (chandonium iodide, HS-310), which is a synthetic azasteroid. Dr Singh has lectured on his research at several of the institutions and conferences in India, United States of America, Canada, United Kingdom and China. He delivered invited lectures at the Harvard School of Medicine and at the International Symposium on Molecular Structure sponsored by the International Union of Crystallography at Beijing.|$|E
50|$|A new neuromuscular blocker, {{initially}} {{named as}} Chandonium Iodide, {{was designed and}} synthesized by the research group of Professor Harkishan Singh at the Panjab University, Chandigarh. The pharmacological testing was carried out at the University at Strathclyde. The toxicity studies at the Central Drug Research Institute, Lucknow, did not reveal any adverse effects. The clinical studies were also successfully completed through the CDRI. The proceedings of the symposium on the clinical testing on Chandonium Iodide {{were published in the}} Journal of Anesthesiology and Clinical Pharmacology, 10, 109-151 (1994). The drug was cleared by the Ministry of Health, Government of India, for manufacturing and clinical use. The World Health Organization gave to the drug the INN designation <b>Candocuronium</b> <b>Iodide.</b> The drug is a potent non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocker with short duration of action. The injections can be sterilized by autoclaving. The preparation can be stored at room temperature without any loss of activity.|$|E
