Unit-root tests and maximum likelihood methods involving a panel data model are explored to obtain reliable estimates. The results suggest that climate has different impacts on different crops and a gradual increase in crop yield variation is expected as global warming prevails. Policy measures to counteract yield variability should therefore be carefully evaluated to protect farmers from exposure to these long-lasting and increasingly climate-related risks.

The problem being dealt with is how to transfer these data to single year transition probabilities. First, a short introduction is given to stochastic and intensity matrices, and to necessary and sufficient conditions for the embeddability of stochastic matrices as the esponential of an intensity matrix and the identification (uniqueness) of this intensituy matrix. Second, the way the problem has been solved is described. The procedures used are: the determination of the 'nearest' intensity matrix. The determination of the maximum likelihood age-independent resp. age-dependent single year transition probabilities. the results are compared and discussed. ...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we develop}} tests for {{structural}} change in cointegrated panel regressions with common and idiosyncratic trends. We consider both {{the cases of}} observable and nonobservable common trends, deriving a Functional Central Limit Theorem for the partial sample estimators under the null of no break. We show that tests based on sup-Wald statistics are powerful versus breaks of size, also proving that power is present when the time of change differs across units and when only some units have a break. Our framework is extended {{to the case of}} cross correlated regressors and endogeneity. Monte Carlo evidence shows that the tests have the correct size and good power properties.

40|$|Many studies {{analyzed}} in depth how aging affects aggregate economic performance. But analyses of these {{effects on the}} employment structure are scarce {{and they do not}} consider that consumption patterns, the supply of goods and services, and also sectoral labor productivity are all likely to adjust to aging and will change. Hence, regression analysis of sectoral employment shares is proposed that controls for aging. For a large panel of countries and a long time period it is found that aging indeed affects relative employment of most sectors statistically highly significant either positive or negative. We also conclude that aging tends to accelerate ongoing structural change. This enables to derive specific policy implications. The approach could thus become a new method in forecasting employment and other effects of aging. Aging, structural <b>change,</b> <b>panel</b> regressions...|$|E
40|$|Panel {{data are}} used in almost all subfields of the {{agricultural}} economics profession. Furthermore, many research areas have an important spatial dimension. This article discusses {{some of the recent}} contributions made in the evolving theoretical and empirical literature on spatial econometric methods for panel data. We then illustrate some of these tools within a climate change application using a hedonic model of farmland values and panel data. Estimates for the model are provided across a range of nonspatial and spatial estimators, including spatial error and spatial lag models with fixed and random effects extensions. Given the importance of location and extensive use of panel data in many subfields of agricultural economics, these recently developed spatial panel methods hold great potential for applied researchers. climate <b>change,</b> <b>panel</b> data, spatial econometrics, Environmental Economics and Policy, Resource /Energy Economics and Policy, C 33, Q 10, Q 54,...|$|E

40|$|Detection of {{structural}} {{change is a}} critical empirical activity, but continuous 'monitoring' of series, for structural changes in real time, raises well-known econometric issues that have been explored in a single series context. If multiple series co-break then {{it is possible that}} simultaneous examination of a set of series helps identify changes with higher probability or more rapidly than when series are examined on a case-by-case basis. Some asymptotic theory is developed for maximum and average CUSUM detection tests. Monte Carlo experiments suggest that these both provide an improvement in detection relative to a univariate detector over a wide range of experimental parameters, given a sufficiently large number of co-breaking series. This is robust to a cross-sectional correlation in the errors (a factor structure) and heterogeneity in the break dates. We apply the test to a panel of UK price indices.

40|$|EU Eastern {{enlargement}} {{has brought}} trade creation, growth and shifts in trading {{patterns in the}} context of opening up, structural change, foreign direct investment and rising domestic investment. We focus on outsourcing and changes in relative prices, RCAs, and export unit values in new EU member states. From a theoretical perspective, it is argued that real exchange rate changes, shifts of RCAs, as well as product innovations/product upgrading will influence the pattern of foreign direct investment. Thus a hybrid Heckscher-Ohlin-Dunning-Schumpeter perspective is an adequate approach. From an empirical point of view, the results of a dynamic panel estimation reveals that industrial production, export unit values, FDI and wages are the most important factors driving comparative advantages in trade. However, their impact and significance depends to a great extent on whether we deal with labour intensive industries, high technology industries or total manufacturing.
