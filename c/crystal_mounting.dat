Using this technique, the cryo-buffer and cryoloop around the protein crystal can be removed before data collection to eliminate their X-ray absorption. The superiority and the reproducibility of the datasets with our mounting technique were demonstrated using tetragonal hen egg-white lysozyme crystals. The structure of a novel protein, PH 1109, from Pyrococcus horikoshii OT 3 was solved using this technique. At the wavelength of chromium Kα radiation, anomalous signals, / of PH 1109 {{is expected to be}} 1. 72 %, as this protein of 144 residues includes 4 methionines and 2 cysteines. Sulphur SAD phasing was performed using SHELXD and SHELXE. In the case of the dataset obtained using our novel <b>crystal</b> <b>mounting</b> technique, 54. 9 % of all residues were built with side-chains automatically by RESOLVE. On the other hand, only 16. 0 % were built with side-chains for the dataset collected using the standard cryoloop. These results indicated that our <b>crystal</b> <b>mounting</b> technique was superior to the standard loop mounting method for measurement of small anomalous differences at longer wavelength, and yielded better results in sulphur substructure solution and initial phasing.

40|$|AbstractHigh-throughput data {{collection}} for macromolecular crystallography requires an automated sample mounting and alignment system for cryo-protected crystals that functions reliably when integrated into protein-crystallography beamlines at synchrotrons.

40|$|The first-order monoclinic-to-orthorhombic (β→γ) phase {{transition}} {{of the giant}} magnetocaloric material Gd 5 Si 2 Ge 2 was studied using in situ high-temperature single-crystal X-ray diffraction. A special <b>crystal</b> <b>mounting</b> procedure was developed to avoid crystal contamination by oxygen or nitrogen at high temperatures. The elastic β→γ transformation occurs at 300 − 320 °C during heating, and it is reversible during fast and slow heating and slow cooling but irreversible during rapid cooling. Contrary to theoretical predictions, the macroscopic distribution of the Si and Ge atoms remains the same in both the orthorhombic γ-polymorph and the monoclinic β-phase. It appears that interstitial impurities may affect stability of both the monoclinic and orthorhombic phases. In the presence of small amounts of air, the β→γ transformation is complete only at 600 °C.

40|$|Over {{the last}} 20 years cryocrystallography has {{revolutionized}} {{the field of}} macromolecular crystallography, greatly reducing radiation damage and allowing the collection of complete data sets at synchrotron sources. However, in order to cool crystals to 100  K cryoprotective agents must usually be added to prevent the formation of crystalline ice, which disrupts the macromolecular crystal lattice and often results in a degradation of diffraction quality. This process can involve the extensive testing of solution compositions and soaking protocols to find suitable conditions that maintain diffraction quality. In this study, it is demonstrated that when some crystals of macromolecules are mounted in the complete absence of surrounding liquid no crystalline ice is formed and the diffraction resolution, merging R factors and mosaic spread values are {{comparable to those of}} crystals cryocooled {{in the presence of a}} cryoprotectant.
