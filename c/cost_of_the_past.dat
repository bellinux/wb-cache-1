It highlighted important trends that frame {{the challenges in}} water resources management of today and into the future, and critically evaluated solutions that people have developed to cope with these challenges. Important past trends include increases in food production that have outpaced population growth, much of this due to a doubling <b>of</b> <b>the</b> global irrigated area between 1961 and 2003, and accompanying declines in <b>the</b> health <b>of</b> aquatic ecosystems resulting from demands for, and impacts of, water use in agriculture. The future will bring new pressures on water resources and ecosystems as demands from sectors other than agriculture increase (including water for biofuel production), populations rise and become more wealthy, which leads to demand for foods that are more water intensive to produce, and climate change increases uncertainty and risk in our agricultural systems. Modelling predictions and analysis of scenarios show that water demand may rise from between only 20 up to 90 % over the next 50 years, depending on how we choose to manage water in agricultural systems in the future.

40|$|OBJECTIVE - To examine racial/ethnic and {{economic}} variation in cost-related medication underuse among insured adults with diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS - We surveyed 5, 086 participants from the multicenter Translating Research Into Action for Diabetes Study. Respondents reported whether they used less medication because <b>of</b> <b>cost</b> in <b>the</b> <b>past</b> 12 months. We examined unadjusted and adjusted rates of cost-related medication underuse, using hierarchical regression, {{to determine whether}} race/ethnicity differences still existed after accounting for economic, health, and other demographic variables. RESULTS - Participants were 48 % white, 14 % African American, 14 % Latino, 15 % Asian/ Pacific Islander, and 8 % other. Overall, 14 % reported cost-related medication underuse. Unadjusted rates were highest for Latinos (23 %) and African Americans (17 %) compared with whites (13 %), Asian/Pacific Islanders (11 %), and others (15 %). In multivariate analyses, race/ethnicity significantly predicted cost-related medication underuse (P = 0. 048). However, adjusted rates were only slightly higher for Latinos (14 %) than whites (10 %) (P = 0. 026) and {{were not significantly different}} for African Americans (11 %), Asian/Pacific Islanders (7 %), and others (11 %). Income and out-of-pocket drug costs showed the greatest differences in adjusted rates of cost-related medication underuse (15 vs. 5 % for participants with income ≤$ 25, 000 vs. > $ 50, 000 and 24 vs. 7 % for participants with out-of-pocket costs > $ 150 per month vs. ≤$ 50 per month. CONCLUSIONS - One in seven participants reported cost-related medication underuse.

This is {{in spite of}} evolutionist theories that predicted its demise and colonial and post-colonial policies that tried actively to accelerate it. The chapter develops an anthropological conceptualization <b>of</b> <b>the</b> institutions <b>of</b> embedded tenure. With examples from Africa and various part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> world, the authors highlight the factors that account for the flexibility, adaptibility and resilience {{of this type of}} system. Embedded tenure has been able to cope with economic stress and hostile policies because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> unique way in which it nests private entitlements into the commons, and both of them into collective property and long-lasting social institutions. Two philosophical principles giving rise to three constitutional rights and four appropriations regimes make up its structure, while dynamic access and transformation rules govern the interlocking and transmutations of appropriation regimes across space and time. This opens three specific paths of agricultural change as well profuse right delegation and land transaction procedures. These have helped the system adapt to changing economic, demographic and social conditions since at least the 19 th century. Reductionist economic analyses of non-market systems, includingn property rights, kinship, common property and non-wage systems contributed to relegating the most innovative aspects of these systems in <b>the</b> limbo <b>of</b> imperfect markets. More interested in "crafted" institutions, the CPR literature also failed to see or emphasize the theoritical and policy implications <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nesting <b>of</b> appropriation regimes in embedded tenure. Other analyses have tended to overemphasize <b>the</b> controversial role <b>of</b> traditional authority at <b>the</b> expense <b>of</b> a deeper institutional analysis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> embedded system. The chapter highlights the numerous policy mistakes that can derive from these forms <b>of</b> reductions. <b>The</b> authors conclude that to disentangle African forest policies from the social <b>costs</b> and inefficiencies <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>past,</b> it is necessary to integrate the complexity and validity of embedded tenure institutions and their demonstrated ability to adapt to legal pluralism and commodity markets...|$|R
40|$|Objectives Australia has <b>the</b> highest {{incidence}} <b>of</b> {{skin cancer}} in the world. Skin cancer prevention campaigns have been implemented in Australia for over two decades. The most notable is under the brand name, SunSmart. <b>The</b> aim <b>of</b> <b>the</b> current study is to assess <b>the</b> cost-effectiveness <b>of</b> SunSmart in <b>the</b> <b>past</b> and <b>the</b> potential cost-effectiveness <b>of</b> an ongoing national SunSmart program with optimal investment in the future. Methods An economic evaluation from a health sector perspective was conducted using the reduction in skin cancer incidence attributable to the SunSmart program modelled as the primary end-point. Historical SunSmart program expenditures were obtained from three representative states in three latitude zones, covering different levels of UVR exposure. Melanoma incidence rates from the three representative state cancer registers were used to model the health outcomes. Program effectiveness was assessed by the comparison between the well-resourced SunSmart state (Victoria) and the under-invested states (New South Wales and Queensland). Non-Melanoma Skin Cancer (NMSC) was modelled based on national survey results. 2003 {{was chosen as the}} reference year and future costs/outcomes over a 20 year time horizon were discounted at 3 %. <b>The</b> future level <b>of</b> investment in a national SunSmart was chosen to strengthen current practice by increasing current investment to a realistic and achievable level. This conservative increase in investment (expressed as ‘$ per capita’) reflected the investment level that has been achieved in Victoria over sustained periods. To model <b>the</b> potential cost-effectiveness <b>of</b> an upgraded national SunSmart program, a conservative approach was taken, whereby <b>the</b> same magnitude <b>of</b> effectiveness from 1988 to 2003 was applied to future skin cancer incidence. Results SunSmart in Victoria has saved 22, 300 life-years, averted 27, 900 disability-adjusted life-years(DALYs) (discounted) since its introduction in 1988 and achieved an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of $AUD 680 per life-year saved (LYS) and $AUD 540 per DALY averted. When the cost-offset from the estimated reduction in skin cancer treatment costs were taken into account, SunSmart achieved ‘dominance’. <b>The</b> net <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> SunSmart in <b>the</b> <b>past</b> was an estimated saving of $AUD 93 million. An upgraded national SunSmart for the next 20 years would save 91, 000 life-years and avert 122, 000 DALYs (discounted), involving an increased investment level from the current $AUD 0. 07 per capita to <b>the</b> historical average <b>of</b> $AUD 0. 28 per capita. The ICER for the upgraded SunSmart program was estimated at $AUD 940 per LYS and $AUD 700 per DALY averted. When the cost-offset is included, the program achieves dominance with a <b>cost</b> saving <b>of</b> $AUD 115 million – an estimated $AUD 2. 32 return for every dollar invested between 2003 and 2022. Conclusions This study demonstrates that a sustained modest investment in skin cancer control is likely to be excellent value-for-money. While the available data base is certainly not prefect, key parameters would have to change dramatically for this conclusion to be challenged. <br /...|$|R
40|$|Current {{interest}} in teacher pension reform {{stems from the}} poor financial condition of many states' pension systems. <b>The</b> <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> these systems were not fully capitalized into <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> education in <b>the</b> <b>past,</b> which is putting pressure on current finances, and policy-makers may wantto reduce <b>the</b> likelihood <b>of</b> this occurring in the future. Moreover, there are concerns that many states' traditional defined benefit plans may not distribute compensation {{in a way that}} optimally attracts and retains the best teachers. In considering pension reforms, such as shifting towards defined contribution structures, it is important to gain insights into teachers' preferences for different types of plans. Washington State's experience of creating a hybrid pension plan can provide useful information to policy makers dealing with these issues. The "big picture" policy implication <b>of</b> <b>the</b> experience in Washington State is that teacher pension systems can be reformed {{in a way that is}} attractive to both teachers and states. <b>The</b> proportion <b>of</b> teachers choosing to transfer to the hybrid plan (75 percent) or enroll as a new hire (60 percent) suggests that there was substantial win-win territory to be taken by restructuring the pension system. As stated previously, creating a new pension system does not by itself reduce unfunded liabilities associated with an existing DB system. However, a state can reduce the financial risk associated with its exposure to those liabilities by inducing employees to voluntarily transfer to the new system. Our analysis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 1997 transfer decision illustrates a situation in which a large proportion of teachers in a traditional DB plan were willing to transfer to a hybrid pension system, and that the decision to transfer was influenced by financial incentives and factors related to risk preferences (particularly age and income). While these findings cannot be generalized to hybrid plans as a whole (we only observe choice between two specific plans), they do indicate the potential to induce a large proportion of transfersto a suitably structured plan. Our analysis of pension choice among new hires in the 2007 choice cohort indicates that a popular hybrid pension plan can be created at comparable cost to a traditional DB plan and with lower financial exposure for taxpayers. Excepting teacher age, new hires' pension preferences were not related to observable teacher and work-environment characteristics. It appears unlikely that <b>the</b> introduction <b>of</b> TRS 3 significantly altered <b>the</b> composition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> teacher workforce interms of attracting new hires. Furthermore, we find no evidence that transitioning to the hybrid system negatively affected <b>the</b> quality <b>of</b> <b>the</b> teacher workforce. In fact, more effective teachers were slightly more likely to choose the hybrid plan. As unfunded pension obligations compete for many state's current education dollars, there is likely to be increasing pressure to enact reforms that will prevent <b>the</b> recurrence <b>of</b> such problems in the future. Given the stakes involved, pension reform is inevitably a contentious process, but the findings from Washington State suggest changes can be made to pension systems that make both teachers and taxpayers better off...|$|R
