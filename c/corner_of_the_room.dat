5|$|A strong {{smell of}} burning {{was present in}} the Lords' {{chambers}} during the afternoon of 16 October, and at 4:00pm two gentlemen tourists visiting to see the Armada tapestries that hung there were unable to view them properly because of the thick smoke. As they approached Black Rod's box in the <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>room,</b> they felt heat from the floor coming through their boots. Shortly after 4:00pm Cross and Furlong finished work, put the last few sticks into the furnaces—closing the doors as they did so—and left {{to go to the}} nearby Star and Garter public house.|$|E
5|$|For {{greatest}} {{efficiency and}} best coupling to the room's air volume, subwoofers {{can be placed}} in a <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>room,</b> far from large room openings, and closer to the listener. This is possible since low bass frequencies have a long wavelength; hence there is little difference between the information reaching a listener's left and right ears, and so they cannot be readily localized. All low frequency information is sent to the subwoofer. However, unless the sound tracks have been carefully mixed for a single subwoofer channel, it's possible to have some cancellation of low frequencies if bass information in one channel is out of phase with another.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, the Enterprise is {{approaching}} the planet. Picard enters his ready room and finds his belongings {{scattered on the}} floor. He calls in Worf, who cannot explain their displacement. D'Sora arrives at Data's cabin where he is painting. She tells him to continue, but is then annoyed when he does so, causing him some confusion. The ship arrives at the coordinates for the planet but finds nothing there. Then it suddenly appears as the ship's computer warns of a depressurization in the observation lounge. The crew investigate and find all the furniture piled in one <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>room.</b>|$|E
60|$|What was she doing? She {{was looking}} fixedly into one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>room.</b>|$|R
60|$|<b>The</b> {{opposite}} <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> {{were soon}} decorated with corresponding figures, whom Rollo introduced as Lord and Lady Frost.|$|R
60|$|Dominey {{did as he}} was bidden. <b>The</b> furthermost <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>room,</b> {{with its}} many wings of book-filled shelves, were illuminated. She nodded.|$|R
5|$|South of {{the great}} hall was a two-storey {{building}} containing withdrawing chambers, dating from around 1200. Narrow windows opening onto the bailey were original but have since been filled in. The first floor was entirely occupied by the great chamber, furnished with a fireplace. In the south-west <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> was a door to a small room which was perhaps used as a safe. The ground floor {{was used as a}} cellar, through which the Carrickfergus Tower could be accessed. The polygonal tower was also accessible through the great chamber at first floor level. Fitted with latrines and a fireplace, it was an extension of the lordly accommodation provided by the great chamber.|$|E
5|$|Josie Packard (Joan Chen) and Pete Martell (Jack Nance) discuss Packard's {{trouble with}} her {{sister-in-law}} Catherine Martell (Piper Laurie). Truman and Cooper arrive {{to speak with}} Packard, who had employed Palmer as an English tutor. Packard admits to sensing that Palmer was troubled but cannot help further; Cooper picks up {{on the fact that}} Truman has been having a relationship with Packard. Catherine calls Packard to tell her that the latter's sawmill lost $87,000 the day before; Catherine is having an affair with Benjamin Horne (Richard Beymer), with whom she is conspiring a hostile takeover of the mill. That same day, Hayward visits Palmer's mother Sarah (Grace Zabriskie), attempting to console her. However, Sarah has a vision of a sinister man (Frank Silva) crouching in the <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>room,</b> and panics. Meanwhile, Laurence Jacoby (Russ Tamblyn), Laura's psychiatrist, listens to an audio tape she had made for him, and sobs as he toys with half of a golden heart necklace, the other half of which was found {{at the scene of the}} crime.|$|E
5|$|The {{long take}} video begins with many people dancing on a hallway, until a girl comes and opens a door {{which leads to}} a room. There, other dancers are dancing to the song in midway of white rays of light, until the camera shows Jackson in the <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> and they start {{performing}} a dance routine. While the singer disappears from vision, people dance until she appears again dancing to the song. Then she goes to a hallway and enters a red-lighted room, accompanied by dancers, where entertainer Mimi Marks is seen. There she dances another routine along with her dancers. After dancing, she enters in another hallway where she gets alone with a man, until they share a kiss. Then, people who were in the previous room enter to the hallway to connect to another room, with Marks taking Jackson with her. The video ends with people coming closer to Jackson.|$|E

60|$|Hester {{stood near}} the door, looking at him. She moved to go out again--stopped--and fixed her eyes {{suddenly}} on one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> inner <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>room.</b>|$|R
25|$|The singer may {{occasionally}} adopt {{a position}} facing the <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> {{and away from}} the audience, with eyes closed, a position that has acoustic benefits, aids concentration for performing long intricate songs from memory, and perhaps has some additional ancient significance.|$|E
25|$|Beck {{probably}} witnessed {{his first}} cardiac arrest during his internship in 1922 {{while on the}} surgery service at the Johns Hopkins Hospital. During a urologic operation, the anaesthetist announced that the patient's heart had stopped. To the amazement of Beck, the surgical resident removed his gloves {{and went to a}} telephone in a <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> and called the fire department. Beck remained in total bewilderment as the fire department rescue squad rushed into the operating room 15minutes later and applied oxygen-powered respirators to the patient's face. The patient died, but the episode left an indelible impression on him. Beck would go on to develop techniques to take back the management of cardiac arrest from the fire department and place it in the hands of surgeons.|$|E
25|$|Under the 1830 Act any householder {{who paid}} rates could apply, with a one-off payment of two guineas (roughly equal in value to £ today), to sell beer or cider {{in his home}} (usually the front parlour) and even to brew his own on his premises. The {{permission}} did not extend to the sale of spirits and fortified wines, and any beer house discovered selling those items was closed down and the owner heavily fined. Beer houses were not permitted to open on Sundays. The beer was usually served in jugs or dispensed directly from tapped wooden barrels {{on a table in}} the <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>room.</b> Often profits were so high the owners were able to buy the house next door to live in, turning every room in their former home into bars and lounges for customers.|$|E
5000|$|The HTC Vive virtual-reality system {{incorporates}} room-scale tracking in {{its core}} design, using two infrared tracking stations located in opposite <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> to monitor <b>the</b> movement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> player.|$|R
60|$|We {{had risen}} to depart when Baskerville gave a cry, of triumph, and diving into one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> he drew a brown boot from under a cabinet.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Clark muttered {{something}} under his breath, and, in a mechanical fashion, {{began to build}} little castles with the draughts. He {{was just about to}} add to an already swaying structure when a thundering rat-tat- tat at the door dispersed the draughts to <b>the</b> four <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>room.</b> <b>The</b> servant opened the door, and the next moment ushered in Mrs. Bowman's visitor.|$|R
25|$|This {{area was}} a sacred burial {{site for the}} aliʻi (ruling class). Kekāuluohi and Kanaʻina's {{original}} home {{was similar to that}} of the other estates in the neighborhood consisting of small buildings used for different purposes. The sitting and sleeping area had a folding door entrance of green painted wood under glass upper panels. The house had two rooms separated by a festooned tent door of chintz fabric and was carpeted with hand crafted makaloa mats. In the front was a lounge area opposite a sideboard and mirror. In the middle they placed a semi circle of armchairs with a center table where the couple would write. Four matching cabinet-bookshelves with glass doors were set in each <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> with silk scarves hanging from each. In his book, A visit to the South Seas, in the U.S. Ship Vincennes: during the years 1829 and 1830, Charles Samuel Stewart describes the area and homes in detail.|$|E
25|$|When {{the second}} floor {{was added to the}} tower {{in the middle of the}} 14th century, the sloping ridged roof of the earlier terrace was {{retained}} and became the floor of the new room. The rib vaulting is divided into three bays instead of two as on the lower two floors. The carved corbels and ceiling bosses are less skilful executed that those on the first floor. The room was originally lit by openings in six niches of which two were windows and four were arrowslits. Those with arrowslits were blocked when the tower was used as a prison and have not been reopened. The arches of the niches differ from those on the lower floors; they have an ogive shape rather than a semi-circular form. The fireplace is set into the north wall. There is an entrance to a gardrobe in the southwest <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>room.</b> The position is surprising as it would have been almost above the quarters of the châtelain and it is possible that the structure was originally a bartizan which was converted into a gardrobe when the upper floors were used as a prison.|$|E
25|$|Approximately {{half of the}} country's {{population}} practice traditional religion, {{which tends}} to emphasize links between {{the living and the}} razana (ancestors). The veneration of ancestors has led to the widespread tradition of tomb building, as well as the highlands practice of the famadihana, whereby a deceased family member's remains may be exhumed to be periodically re-wrapped in fresh silk shrouds before being replaced in the tomb. The famadihana is an occasion to celebrate the beloved ancestor's memory, reunite with family and community, and enjoy a festive atmosphere. Across the island, many Malagasy make offerings out of respect to the ancestors, such as by pouring the first cap-full of each newly opened bottle of rum into the northeastern <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>room.</b> Consideration for ancestors is also demonstrated through adherence to fady, taboos that are respected during and after the lifetime of the person who establishes them. It is widely believed that by showing respect for ancestors in these ways, they may intervene on behalf of the living. Conversely, misfortunes are often attributed to ancestors whose memory or wishes have been neglected. The sacrifice of zebu is a traditional method used to appease or honor the ancestors. In addition, the Malagasy traditionally believe in a creator god, called Zanahary or Andriamanitra.|$|E
60|$|The temple derived {{its light}} solely {{from a small}} opening in the vaulted ceiling; that light which came down in a narrow shaft was grey and dull and failed to {{penetrate}} the dark and mysterious <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>room.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{interior}} {{has four}} rooms without a central hallway. The door opens {{to a small}} foyer with staircase. The second floor has three bedrooms and a bath. The fireplaces with original Greek-motif mantels are in <b>the</b> <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>room.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Four corners is a children's game, often {{played in}} {{elementary}} schools. <b>The</b> object <b>of</b> <b>the</b> game is for players to choose <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> {{and not get}} caught by the designated [...] "It" [...] player until they are the last remaining participant.|$|R
25|$|In 1966, Serra {{made his}} first sculptures out of nontraditional {{materials}} such as fiberglass and rubber. Serra's earliest work was abstract and process-based made from molten lead hurled in large splashes {{against the wall of}} a studio or exhibition space. In 1967 and 1968 he compiled a list of infinitives that served as catalysts for subsequent work: “to hurl” suggested the hurling of molten lead into crevices between wall and floor; “to roll” led to the rolling of the material into dense, metal logs. He began in 1969 to be primarily concerned with the cutting, propping or stacking of lead sheets, rough timber, etc., to create structures, some very large, supported only by their own weight. His “Prop” pieces from the late 1960s are arranged so that weight and gravity balance lead rolls and sheets. Cutting Device: Base Plate Measure (1969) consists of an assemblage of heterogeneous materials (lead, wood, stone and steel) into which two parallel cuts have been made and the results strewn around in a chance configuration. In Malmo Role (1984), a four-foot-square steel plate, one and a half inches thick, bisects a <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> and is prevented from falling by a short cylindrical prop wedged into the corner of the walls.|$|E
500|$|In the HIStory album booklet {{there is}} a drawing of Jackson as a child. He is huddled in a <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> and looks scared, and the {{electric}} cord of his microphone has snapped. On one corner wall are the lyrics to [...] "Childhood", the other wall shows Jackson's signature.|$|E
500|$|According to the {{traditional}} beliefs of many Malagasy ethnic groups, one attains the status of [...] "ancestor" [...] after death. [...] It is often believed that ancestors continue to watch over and shape events on Earth and can intervene on behalf of (or interfere with) the living. [...] As a consequence, ancestors are to be revered: prayers and sacrifices to honor or appease them are common, {{as well as the}} observation of the local fady (taboos) the ancestors may have established in life. Gestures of respect, such as throwing the first capful of a new bottle of rum into the northeast <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> to share it with the ancestors, are practiced throughout the island. The most visible emblem of the respect due to ancestors is the construction of the elaborate family tombs that dot the countryside in much of Madagascar.|$|E
500|$|This {{excavation}} {{confirmed the}} kitchen was a square building measuring [...] square, with walls of between [...] and [...] thick. The ovens found in <b>the</b> <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> suggest <b>the</b> <b>room</b> was an octagonal shape internally: similar to the kitchens found at Glastonbury Abbey.|$|R

500|$|Inside, {{the layout}} {{consisted}} of two floors with four rooms each, linked by a central staircase with a decorative wooden balustrade. Ebony and rosewood {{were used for the}} interior panelling, floors and ceilings while the floor of the central hall exhibited a diamond parquet design in oak and rosewood. An 1873 visitor described the floor as [...] "highly polished... all right enough for bare feet but rather slippery for boots". Wallpaper adorned the walls of the central hall, which was approximately [...] long, [...] wide and [...] high. The queen's couch occupied the northeast <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>room,</b> a space reserved for the ancestors according to traditional Malagasy cosmology, where she would receive visitors in repose. A room formerly used as an office by Prime Minister Rainilaiarivony occupied the portion of the second floor facing the stairway.|$|E
500|$|Numerous {{alcoholic}} beverages are produced for local consumption and limited export. The local pilsner, Three Horses Beer, is popular and ubiquitous. Wine {{is produced in}} the southern highlands around Fianarantsoa, and rum (toaka gasy [...] ) is widely produced and can be either drunk neat, flavored with exotic fruits and spices to produce rhum arrangé or blended with coconut milk to make a punch coco cocktail. The most traditional form of rum, called betsabetsa , is made from fermented sugarcane juice. Rum serves a ritual purpose {{in many parts of}} Madagascar, where it is traditional to throw the first capful of a newly opened bottle of rum into the northeast <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> as an offering and gesture of respect to the ancestors. At social gatherings it is common for {{alcoholic beverages}} to be accompanied with savory, fried snacks known collectively as tsakitsaky, commonly including pan-fried peanuts, potato chips, nems, sambos and kaka pizon.|$|E
500|$|On the {{afternoon}} of this day I was taking a walk with the steward of the convent in the neighbourhood, and as we returned, towards sunset, he begged me to take some refreshment {{with him in his}} cell. Scarcely had he entered the room, when, resuming our former subject of conversation, he said: [...] "And I, too, have read a Septuagint" [...] – i.e. a copy of the Greek translation made by the Seventy. And so saying, he took down from the <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> a bulky kind of volume, wrapped up in a red cloth, and laid it before me. I unrolled the cover, and discovered, to my great surprise, not only those very fragments which, fifteen years before, I had taken out of the basket, but also other parts of the Old Testament, the New Testament complete, and, in addition, the Epistle of Barnabas and a part of the Shepherd of Hermas.|$|E
