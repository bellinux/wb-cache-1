40|$|Abstract—Compliant {{mechanisms}} realize mechanism functions by {{utilizing the}} elastic deformations of flexible components {{rather than the}} relative motions of rigid joints. The advantages of compliant mechanisms stem from the removal or replacement of rigid joints, which include the elimination of backlash, friction, wear and lubrication, the reduction of vibration and noise, the decreased manufacturing and assembly cost, and the increased precision. Because of the integrated motion and force behavior and the nonlinearities of large deformations, designing compliant mechanisms is much more challenging than rigid mechanisms. <b>Constant</b> <b>force</b> compliant mechanisms produce an output force that does not change for a large range of input motion and have many different applications. A method is introduced in this paper for designing <b>constant</b> <b>force</b> compliant mechanisms. A designed <b>constant</b> <b>force</b> compliant mechanism is modelled as a network of variable width spline curves which are defined by their interpolation circles. The design of <b>constant</b> <b>force</b> compliant mechanisms is systematized as optimizing the independent parameters of the variable width spline curves. The presented method is demonstrated by {{the design of a}} <b>constant</b> <b>force</b> compliant mechanism in the paper.

We illustrate this technique in simulations and demonstrate its effectiveness in experiments on a DNA hairpin. We find that the combination of this technique with the use of short DNA handles facilitates a high-resolution measurement of the hairpin's folding landscape with a very short measurement time...|$|R

We observe both apparent two-state unfolding and several unfolding pathways involving {{one of three}} major, mutually exclusive intermediate states. All three major intermediates lack two of seven native β-strands, and share a quite similar extension. The unfolding behavior is found to depend strongly on the pulling conditions. In particular, we observe large variations in the relative frequencies of occurrence for the intermediates. At low <b>constant</b> <b>force</b> or low <b>constant</b> velocity, all three major intermediates occur with a significant frequency.

40|$|At {{medium and}} high force levels, {{patients}} with generalized myotonia (GM) cannot produce normal force {{because of a}} peculiar transient paresis. The authors have previously demonstrated that, during transient paresis, there is a disturbed propagation of muscle fiber action potentials along the sarcolemma, resulting in conduction block and paresis. At low force levels, however, these patients can produce a <b>constant</b> <b>force.</b> It is as yet unknown how patients with GM, despite these muscle membrane abnormalities, are able to produce <b>constant</b> <b>force</b> during isometric voluntary low-force contractions. Using high-density surface EMG (SEMG), the authors tested the hypothesis that in patients with GM, muscle membrane function is already disturbed at low <b>force</b> levels despite <b>constant</b> <b>force</b> and that abnormal motor unit recruitment acts as a compensatory mechanism to obtain normal force stability. High-density SEMG was measured on the biceps brachii at 20 % of the maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) in seven patients with GM previously shown to have transient paresis at higher force levels. High-density SEMG provides spatial and temporal information {{that is used to}} analyze propagation disturbances and recruitment strategies. In addition, needle EMG was performed in two patients simultaneously. The SEMG abnormalities included disturbed propagation of motor unit action potentials (MUAPs) over the muscle fiber membrane and abnormal motor unit recruitment patterns, pointing to central adaptation mechanisms. Prolonged periods of low SEMG amplitudes were sometimes present despite <b>constant</b> <b>force,</b> indicating that mechanisms other than motor unit recruitment also contribute to force preservation. During the periods of low SEMG, the density of myotonic discharges, recorded simultaneously with needle EMG, was not increased. Patients with GM can show, despite muscle membrane dysfunction, normal force stability. Abnormal motor unit recruitment as a compensatory mechanism occurs in patients with GM but cannot fully explain <b>constant</b> <b>force...</b>|$|R
40|$|We {{make use}} of the {{formulation}} developed by Lovalenti and Brady 1 for the hydrodynamic force acting upon a spherical particle undergoing arbitrary time dependent motion in an arbitrary time dependent uniform flow field at low Reynolds numbers, to derive an expression for the effects of a <b>constant</b> bias <b>force</b> acting on a periodically forced rigid spherical particle in a Newtonian fluid. We use Newton's second law to relate the total force acting on the particle to the motion of the particle. The total force is given by: Totalforce=F ext+ FH, where, F ext is the external force inclusive of both the periodic <b>force</b> and the <b>constant</b> bias <b>force.</b> F H is the hydrodynamic force derived by Lovalenti and Brady 1 including both unsteady and convective inertia. The equation derived contains a nonlinear history term and is nonlinear. This equation is solved numerically using an adaptive step size Runge - Kutta scheme. We obtain several phase plots (plots between particle displacement and particle velocity), which show the effects of low Reynolds numbers, the periodic force and the effects of the <b>constant</b> bias <b>force</b> on the particle motion. It is observed that at low magnitudes of the periodic <b>forcing</b> the external <b>constant</b> <b>force</b> dominates and the particle moves along the direction of the external <b>constant</b> <b>force.</b> As we increase the magnitude of the periodic forcing, the periodic force is seen to dominate and the particle is seen to oscillate along a mean position with a slight drift along the direction of the periodic force and the external <b>constant</b> <b>force,</b> when they are imposed in the same direction. However the motion of the particle becomes more complicated when the directions of the periodic <b>forcing</b> and external <b>constant</b> <b>force</b> are opposite to each other. We also observe a reflection in phase space when the directions of both the forces are reversed. The phase plots typically are of a half sinusoidal, sinusoidal and a coiled (solenoidal) pattern. These plots include the effects of both periodic <b>force</b> and the <b>constant</b> bias <b>force.</b> As the Reynolds numbers increases the drift of the particle reduces, which indicates the effects of inertia.
