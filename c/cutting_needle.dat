40|$|PURPOSE: To {{report the}} {{experience}} of a radiology department in the use of computed tomography guided biopsies of mediastinal lesions with fine and <b>cutting</b> <b>needles,</b> describing the differences between them. The results of adequacy of the sample and histologic diagnoses are presented according to the type of needle used. METHODS: We present a retrospective study of mediastinal biopsies guided by computed tomography performed from January 1993 to December 1999. Eighty-six patients underwent mediastinal biopsy in this period, 37 with <b>cutting</b> <b>needles,</b> 38 with fine needles, and 11 with both types (total of 97 biopsies). RESULTS: In most cases, it was possible to obtain an adequate sample (82. 5 %) and specific diagnosis (67. 0 %). Cutting-needle biopsy produced a higher percentage of adequate samples (89. 6 % versus 75. 5 %, P = 0. 068) and of specific diagnosis (81. 3 % versus 53. 1 %, P = 0. 003) than fine-needle biopsy. There were no complications that required intervention in either group. CONCLUSION: Because they are practical, safe, and can provide accurate diagnoses, image-guided biopsies should be considered the procedure of choice in the initial exploration of patients with mediastinal masses. In our experience, <b>cutting</b> <b>needles</b> gave higher quality samples and diagnostic rates. We recommend the use of <b>cutting</b> <b>needles</b> as the preferred procedure...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} {{the contribution of}} percutaneous biopsy with core <b>cutting</b> <b>needle</b> in the diagnosis of mediastinal tumors. METHOD: Retrospective review of 22 patients with mediastinal lesions who were submitted to percutaneous core <b>cutting</b> <b>needle</b> biopsy, oriented, but not guided by computer assisted tomography of the thorax, between 1999 and 2002. RESULTS: Percutaneous biopsy with core <b>cutting</b> <b>needle</b> provided adequate material in 18 / 22 cases, with a total positive sample rate of 82 %. In 4 / 22 cases, the material was insufficient to define the diagnosis (18 %). Percutaneous core <b>cutting</b> <b>needle</b> biopsy established a specific histologic diagnosis in 82 % of the patients: 8 / 22 (36 %) lymphoma; 5 / 22 (28 %) thymoma; 2 / 22 (11 %) thymic carcinoma; 1 / 22 (6 %) metastatic adenocarcinoma; 1 / 22 (6 %) neuroectodermic primitive tumor; and 1 / 22 (6 %) plasmocytoma. All the patients were submitted to a thoracic X-ray after the biopsy. No complications were found in these patients. CONCLUSION: Percutaneous core <b>cutting</b> <b>needle</b> biopsy oriented, but not guided by computer assisted tomography of the thorax, is an easy and safe procedure which can provide a precise diagnosis in most mediastinal tumors, and can prevent the exploratory thoracic surgery in inoperable or chemotherapy-treated cases...|$|E
40|$|Fine Needle Aspiration (FNA) is a {{minimally}} invasive method for sampling focal lesions that uses a small gauge hypodermic needle (20 - 24 Gauge) to obtain cells for microscopic analysis. This {{is in contrast to}} core biopsy which obtains a core of tissue using larger gauge <b>cutting</b> <b>needles</b> (14 - 18 Gauge). Both FNA and core biopsies are classified as closed or percutaneous biopsies as opposed to open biopsy that is obtained during surgery. Ultrasound (US) -guided FNA lends itself particularly well to lesions in superficial organs such as the thyroid, lymph nodes and the breast. However, since it is less traumatic than core biopsy, it is safer for use in highly vascular organs such as the thyroid gland.

40|$|AbstractAim: To {{determine}} {{the contribution of}} percutaneous biopsy with core <b>cutting</b> <b>needle</b> (Trucut) in the diagnosis of mediastinal tumours. Method: Retrospective review of 56 patients with mediastinal lesions who underwent percutaneous core <b>cutting</b> <b>needle</b> biopsy, oriented but not guided by computer assisted tomography of the thorax, 1999 – 2008. Results: Percutaneous biopsy with core <b>cutting</b> <b>needle</b> provided adequate material in 49 / 56, with a total positive sample rate of 88 %. In 7 / 56 (12 %) cases the material was insufficient to define the diagnosis. Percutaneous core <b>cutting</b> <b>needle</b> biopsy established a specific histological diagnosis in 88 % of the patients: 23 / 56 (41 %) lymphomas; 12 / 56 (21 %) thymomas; 5 / 56 (3 %) thymic carcinomas; 3 / 56 (2 %) small cell carcinoma and 1 / 56 (0. 6 %) metastatic adenocarcinoma, metastatic squamous cell carcinoma, neuroendocrine primitive carcinoma, plasmocytoma, teratoma and goiter.

30|$|When a {{complete}} tissue analysis {{is needed for}} a correct histological diagnosis and for further pathological analyses, as Ki- 67 quantification in neuroendocrine neoplasms, FNA is not adequate, as it only provides a cytological specimen with few histologic structures. Moreover, when FNA is performed without the immediate evaluation of the specimen by a cytopathologist, the procedure must be repeated in a different session if the sample results inadequate for a final pathological diagnosis. Core-needle biopsy (CNB) overcomes all these limitations, because it provides preserved tissue structures for histologic analysis and molecular characterisation. Coaxial <b>cutting</b> <b>needles</b> are commonly used for CNB. No significant differences in complication rates have been reported between different calibres of the CNB needle, which normally ranges between 14 to 20 [*]G [6, 15]. Several studies have reported very high sensitivity, specificity and accuracy values for CNB of pancreatic masses, with a diagnostic rate that ranges between 92 and 96 % [6]. Percutaneous CNB has {{a higher risk of}} complications [6] compared with US-FNA [10]. Therefore, percutaneous US-FNA, especially when performed in the presence of an experienced cytopathologist, has sensitivity and accuracy values comparable to those of EUS-FNA and US-CNB, but it is cheaper and with less complications.|$|R

We determined the clinical efficacy of USCNB in diagnosing parotid gland masses by using <b>cutting</b> <b>needles</b> of different bores. METHODS: We reviewed records for 40 benign and 13 malignant parotid lesions. USCNB was performed by using 14 – 20 -gauge needles (mean, 16. 6 gauge) with one to five (mean, 2. 43) passes and a 15 -mm throw or specimen notch.

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{report the}} {{experience}} of a radiology department in the use of computed tomography - guided <b>cutting</b> <b>needle</b> biopsy of pulmonary nodules, by evaluating diagnostic yield and incidence of complications. METHODS: This is a retrospective analysis of 52 consecutive patients who underwent lung lesion biopsy guided by computed tomography, performed between May 1997 and May 2000. Thirty-five patients were male and 17 were female, with ages ranging from 5 to 85 years (median, 62 years). The size of the lesions ranged from 1. 8 to 15 cm (median, 5. 4 cm). RESULTS: In a total of 52 biopsies of lung lesions, 51 biopsies (98. 1 %) supplied appropriate material for histopathological diagnosis, with 9 diagnosed (17. 3 %) as benign and 42 (80. 8 %) as malignant lesions. Specific diagnosis was obtained in 44 (84. 6 %) biopsies: 4 benign (9. 1 %) and 40 (90. 9 %) malignant lesions. The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of the <b>cutting</b> <b>needle</b> biopsies for determining presence of malignancy were 96. 8 %, 100 %, and 97. 2 %, respectively.

40|$|SummaryIntroductionThe primary aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the ability of radiologists to accurately estimate pneumothorax and pulmonary haemorrhage during percutaneous co-axial <b>cutting</b> <b>needle</b> CT-guided lung biopsy. MethodologyPatients undergoing <b>cutting</b> <b>needle</b> lung biopsy during the study period were identified; the path taken by the <b>cutting</b> <b>needle</b> marked on each pre-biopsy staging CT scan. Each scan was then reviewed independently by two thoracic radiologists blinded to clinical details and complications; pneumothorax and pulmonary haemorrhage risk estimated with a percentage Visual Analogue Scale. ResultsIn 134 patients, pneumothorax occurred in 24 %. The radiologists differed in the estimation of pneumothorax risk in 55 % (74 episodes). When pneumothorax risk was estimated < 20 % by radiologists 1 and 2, 16 % and 14 % of biopsies resulted in pneumothorax; where risk was estimated at 20 – 49 %, pneumothorax incidence rose to 33 % and 31 %; where risk was deemed ≥ 50 %, pneumothorax rate was 87 % and 100 %. Pulmonary haemorrhage occurred in 4 %; estimated haemorrhage risk for biopsies complicated by haemorrhage did not differ significantly from where haemorrhage did not occur.

30|$|There {{is a wide}} {{variation}} in reporting diagnostic accuracies of fine-needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) between different institutions, ranging from 64 % to 97 %. The false-negative rate of FNAB varies, occurring in 6 to 54 % of biopsies. The sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of FNAB for pulmonary lesions are 82 to 99 %, 86 to 100 % and 64 to 97 %, respectively [28]. Core biopsy {{has been shown to}} have slightly higher overall sensitivity, specificity and accuracy, with respective values of 89 %, 97 % and 93 % (Table 3). Several recent papers advocate the use of 18 - and 20 -gauge <b>cutting</b> <b>needles</b> as well as coaxial techniques to improve the diagnostic yield, reporting diagnostic accuracies of 74 – 95 % for the diagnosis of malignancy. Charig and Phillips reported similar accuracy of FNAB and core biopsy when an on-site pathologist was available; in a similar setting Capalbo et al. observed a greater diagnostic accuracy of FNAB compared to core needle biopsy (94.83 % vs. 81.82. %) [36]. Nowadays, the test of genetic mutations is important to plan targeted therapies in patient with lung cancers.

40|$|Background: Transthoracic {{ultrasound}} (US) {{has gained}} popularity {{as a tool}} for visualizing pleural effusions and assisting thoracentesis or chest drain placement. In the absence of effusion, US just as well demonstrates solid masses involving or abutting the pleura, yet biopsy of such lesions is not widely performed by chest physicians. Objective: To assess the feasibility and the safety of US-assisted <b>cutting</b> <b>needle</b> biopsy performed by chest physicians in routine practice. Methods: Lesions involving or abutting the pleura ≥ 20 mm in diameter on US were sampled with a 14 -gauge <b>cutting</b> <b>needle</b> under local anesthesia. Biopsy site, needle direction and depth of penetration were determined with US. The procedure was performed without direct US guidance in 'free-hand' technique. Results: Ninety-one patients underwent 96 cutting-needle biopsies for suspected peripheral lung tumors (n = 44, 46 %), pleural-based (n = 39, 41 %), mediastinal (n = 10, 10 %), or chest wall lesions (n = 3, 3 %), which were single in 71 %, multiple in 6 % and diffuse in 23 %. Sensitivity for malignant neoplasms (n = 65) was 85. 5 % and 100 % for mesothelioma (n = 10). Pneumothorax occurred in 4 %.

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} our study was to {{evaluate}} a method of automated <b>cutting</b> <b>needle</b> biopsy (ACNB) that combines {{the use of a}} long-throw needle, higher mean number of needle passes, and tandem system, in terms of the accuracy of specific diagnosis of small and large lung lesions and the safety of the procedure. Materials and Methods: Fifty-seven ACNBs were performed under computed tomography guidance using a tandem system with a 20 -gauge and 18 -gauge (through non-aerated lung) automated <b>cutting</b> <b>needle</b> with a throw length of 23 mm. We classified the nodules into 21 small nodules (≤ 2 cm) and 36 large nodules (> 2 cm). All ACNB diagnoses were divided into three groups: specific, non-specific, and false diagnoses. All of the complications were recorded. Results: The mean number of ACNB specimens obtained was 2. 0. Of the 35 ACNB procedures for malignant lesions, 33 yielded a specific malignant diagnosis (33 / 35, 94 %). Of the 22 procedures for benign lesions, 17 gave a specific benign diagnosis (17 / 22, 77 %). The diagnostic accuracy for small nodules was no lower than that for large nodules. Postbiopsy pneumothorax occurred in 18 patients (32 %). Conclusion: The diagnostic accuracy of the combined method is as high for small lung nodules as for large ones. The procedure has high diagnostic accuracy for the subtypes of lung cancer and an acceptable complication rate. Link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{evaluate}} {{the performance of}} fine and <b>cutting</b> <b>needles</b> in computed tomography guided-biopsy of lung lesions suspicious for malignancy and to determine which technique is the best option for a specific diagnosis. METHODS: This retrospective study reviewed the data from 362 (71. 6 %) patients who underwent fine-needle aspiration biopsy and from 97 (19. 7 %) patients who underwent cutting-needle biopsy between January 2006 and December 2011. The data concerning demographic and lesion characteristics, procedures, biopsy sample adequacy, specific diagnoses, and complications were collected. The success and complication rates of both biopsy techniques were calculated. RESULTS: Cutting-needle biopsy yielded significantly higher percentages of adequate biopsy samples and specific diagnoses than did fine-needle aspiration biopsy (p< 0. 05). The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of cutting-needle biopsy were 93. 8 %, 97. 3 %, and 95. 2 %, respectively; those of fine-needle aspiration biopsy were 82. 6 %, 81. 3 %, and 81. 8 %, respectively (all p< 0. 05). The incidence of pneumothorax was higher for fine-needle aspiration biopsy, and that of hematoma was higher for cutting-needle biopsy (both p< 0. 05).

The procedure was attempted in 14 pigs. Initially crocodile jaw (two pigs) and fenestrated cups forceps (five pigs), which are currently in use for transbronchial lung biopsy, were used. Subsequently the biopsy forceps was modified and the jaws were replaced by a <b>cutting</b> <b>needle</b> mechanism (six pigs). Out of the 13 animals in which the procedure was technically possible, lung parenchyma was obtained from nine and pulmonary arterial wall from 11. One animal died shortly after the procedure. The cause of death could not be determined with certainty at postmortem examination. There was, however, a small tear on the surface of the lung, which could have produced a tension pneumothorax. The other 12 animals recovered from the procedure. They were killed 24 hours later and postmortem examination was carried out. One animal in which the crocodile jaw forceps had been used had a haematoma in the lower lobe (3 X 3 X 4 cm) and 100 ml of blood in the pleural cavity. In the other 11 animals, in which the fenestrated cups or the <b>cutting</b> <b>needle</b> forceps had been used, the intrapulmonary haematomas were 1 - 2 cm in diameter and the pleural surface was intact. It is concluded therefore that transvenous lung biopsy is feasible and that this procedure might find an application in monitoring rejection in recipients of heart-lung transplants...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The optimal {{method for}} liver biopsy in {{patients}} with simultaneous bone marrow and liver impairment {{has not yet been}} established. New approaches (e. g. imaging-guided methods) for this procedure are needed. In spite of coagulopathy, immunosuppression, anemia or ascites, we histologically characterized liver damage in a series of bone marrow transplanted patients using color-Doppler ultrasonography, which permits very keen visualization (and assessment) of hepatic parenchyma and vessels, and a fine needle for percutaneous biopsy. DESIGN AND METHODS: We performed percutaneous liver biopsy using a Menghini-type automatic very fine <b>cutting</b> <b>needle</b> (1. 2 mm, 18 G) under color ultrasound guidance in 16 bone marrow transplanted adult patients consecutively seen in our units from 1998 to 2001. The patients had clinically defined diffuse serious liver damage; liver biopsy was performed between 3 and 10 months after allogeneic (n= 11) or autologous (n= 5) transplantation. RESULTS: Fifteen patients tolerated the procedure well and had no discomfort, while one patient developed intrahepatic hemorrhage. All liver biopsies were suitable for histologic examination and informative, revealing the specific etiology of liver damage: graft-versus-host disease in six patients, drug toxicity in five, hepatitis C virus acute reactivation in two, and in one each vanishing bile duct syndrome, nodular regenerative hyperplasia and hemochromatosis. Biopsy detected potentially injurious concomitant factors, e. g., occult intrahepatic hepatitis B virus infection and reactivation. Histology radically changed the presumptive clinical diagnosis in 10 of the 16 patients and led to successful treatment changes in six. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: Percutaneous biopsy with a small <b>cutting</b> <b>needle</b> under color ultrasound guidance carries a low risk of complications and provides reliable information regarding liver histology in critically ill patients, in the early stage after bone marrow transplantation. We suggest including this imaging-guided mini-invasive procedure to the standard work-up of post-transplant liver damage...|$|E
40|$|Chronic viral {{hepatitis}} {{is a common}} disease in the general population. During chronic hepatitis, the prognosis and clinical management are highly dependent {{on the extent of}} liver fibrosis. The fibrosis evaluation can be performed by FibroTest (using serological markers), by Elastography or FibroScan (a noninvasive percutaneous technique using the elastic properties of the hepatic tissue) and by liver biopsy (LB), considered to be the “gold standard”. Currently, there are three techniques for performing LB: percutaneous, transjugular and laparoscopic. The percutaneous LB can be performed blind, ultrasound (US) guided or US assisted. There are two main categories of specialists who perform LB: gastroenterologists (hepatologists) and radiologists, and the specialty of the individual who performs the LB determines if the LB is performed under ultrasound guidance or not. There are two types of biopsy needles used for LB: <b>cutting</b> <b>needles</b> (Tru-Cut, Vim-Silverman) and suction needles (Menghini, Klatzkin, Jamshidi). The rate of major complications after percutaneous LB ranges from 0. 09 % to 2. 3 %, but the echo-guided percutaneous liver biopsy is a safe method for the diagnosis of chronic diffuse hepatitis (cost-effective as compared to blind biopsy) and the rate of complications seems {{to be related to the}} experience of the physician and the type of the needle used (Menghini type needle seems to be safer). Maybe, in a few years we will use non-invasive markers of fibrosis, but at this time, most authorities in the field consider that the LB is useful and necessary for the evaluation of chronic hepatopathies, despite the fact that it is not a perfect test...|$|R
40|$|Liver biopsy is the {{standard}} procedure for obtaining hepatic tissue for histopathological examination. The three major techniques are percutaneous, transvenous, and laparoscopic/open biopsy, with either <b>cutting</b> or suction <b>needles.</b> The indications for liver biopsy are shifting as knowledge of etiologies, non-invasive biomarker alternatives, and treatment options in paediatric liver disease expand. This mini-review presents specific indications, alternative approaches, methods, complications, and contraindications for paediatric liver biopsy...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Since August Bier {{reported}} {{the first case}} in 1898, post-dural puncture headache (PDPH) {{has been a problem}} for patients following dural puncture. Clinical and laboratory research over the last 30 years has shown that use of smaller-gauge needles, particularly of the pencil-point design, are associated with a lower risk of PDPH than traditional <b>cutting</b> point <b>needle</b> tips (Quincke-point needle). A careful history can rule out other causes of headache. A postural component of headache is {{the sine qua non of}} PDPH. In high-risk patients, 50 years, post-partum, in the event a large-gauge needle puncture is initiated, an epidural blood patch should be performed within 24 – 48 hours of dural puncture. The optimum volume of blood has been shown to be 12 – 20 mL for adult patients. Complications caused by autologous epidural blood patching (AEBP) are rare...|$|R
