50|$|Flowers {{had been}} brought in to design the Heath Robinson's <b>combining</b> <b>unit.</b> He was not {{impressed}} by the system of a key tape {{that had to be}} kept synchronised with the message tape and, on his own initiative, he designed an electronic machine which eliminated the need for the key tape by having an electronic analogue of the Lorenz (Tunny) machine. He presented this design to Max Newman in February 1943, but the idea that the one to two thousand thermionic valves (vacuum tubes and thyratrons) proposed, could work together reliably, was greeted with great scepticism, so more Robinsons were ordered from Dollis Hill. Flowers, however, knew from his pre-war work that most thermionic valve failures occurred {{as a result of the}} thermal stresses at power up, so not powering a machine down reduced failure rates to very low levels. Flowers persisted with the idea and obtained support from the Director of the Research Station, W Gordon Radley. Flowers and his team of some fifty people in the switching group spent eleven months from early February 1943 designing and building a machine that dispensed with the second tape of the Heath Robinson, by generating the wheel patterns electronically. Flowers used some of his own money for the project.|$|E

40|$|Answer Set Programming (ASP) is a logic {{programming}} language for nonmonotonic reasoning. Propositional ASP programs are usually evaluated by DPLL algorithms <b>combining</b> <b>unit</b> propagation with operators that are specific of ASP. Among them, unfounded set propagation {{is used for}} handling recursive programs by many ASP solvers. This paper reports a comparison of two available solutions for unfounded set propagation, the one adopted in DLV and that based on source pointers. The paper also discusses the impact of splitting the input program in components according to head-to-body dependencies. Both solutions and variants have been implemented in the same solver, namely WASP. An advantage in properly splitting the program in components is highlighted by an experiment on a selection of problems taken from the 3 rd ASP Competition. In this experiment the algorithm based on source pointers performs better. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2013...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Growing use of {{renewables}} pushes thermal gener-ators against operating constraints – e. g. ramping, minimum output, {{and operating}} reserves – that are traditionally ignored in expansion planning models. We show how including such unit-commitment-derived details can significantly change energy production and optimal capacity mix. We introduce {{a method for}} efficiently <b>combining</b> <b>unit</b> commitment and generation expansion planning into a single mixed-integer optimization model. Our formulation groups generators into categories allowing integer commitment states from zero to the installed capacity. This formulation scales well, runs much faster (e. g. 5000 x) than individual plant binary decisions, and makes the combined model computationally tractable for large systems (hundreds of generators) at hourly time resolutions (8760 hours) using modern solvers on a personal computer. We show that ignoring these constraints during planning {{can result in a}} sub-optimal capacity mix with significantly higher operating costs (17 %) and carbon emissions (39 %) and/or the inability to meet emissions targets...|$|E

40|$|A scaling {{fixed field}} {{alternating}} gradient (FFAG) accelerator provides large momentum acceptance {{despite the fact}} that magnetic guiding fields are constant in time. Optical functions are identical over the large momentum range as well. We have designed a straight beam transport line (BTL) using a scaling FFAG type magnet which has a field profile of y^{k}, where y is the horizontal coordinate and k is the magnetic field index. This FFAG-BTL has very large momentum acceptance and optical functions that, practically speaking, do not depend on momentum. We also designed a dispersion suppressor {{at the end of the}} line by <b>combining</b> <b>unit</b> cells with a different field index k so that the momentum dependence of orbit location should be eliminated at the exit. An obvious application of this design is the BTL after an FFAG accelerator to a patient in a hadron therapy facility or to a target in general. This could be an alternative to the conventional BTL with solenoids or quadrupoles because of the strong focusing nature of a quadrupole and the large momentum acceptance like a solenoid...|$|E
40|$|Abstract － Scheduling the {{economic}} generation of thermal units {{is a critical}} task {{in a large scale}} power system because it significantly reduces annual production cost. This study presents a novel triple-stage algorithm {{to solve the problem of}} <b>combining</b> <b>unit</b> commitment and economic dispatch of the thermal units while minimizing cost. The proposed algorithm divides all the units into five groups and finds potential combinations with a redundancy factor in the first stage. Then, employ a simplified economic dispatch method and a look forward method to obtain the optimal unit scheduling in the second stage. Lastly, a look backward method is applied to refine the optimal solution in the last stage. When the discontinuous cost function of unit is considered, a zero cost power method is also used to evaluate the solution. Finally, three test cases are simulated and the results compared with existing methods. Simulation results demonstrate the outstanding performance of the proposed method.

Actual soil behavior is well known to be inexpressible by simple elemental shapes in DEM, such as circles for 2 D or spheres for 3 D because of the excessive rotation of elements. To develop a more effective model for approximating real soil behavior by DEM, either {{the introduction of a}} rolling resistance moment for simple elemental shape or the combination of simple elements to form a complex model soil particle shape cannot be avoided. This study was conducted to investigate the effects of elemental shape on the cutting resistance of soil by a narrow blade using 3 D DEM.

Moreover, cutting resistance was measured in a soil bin filled with air-dried sand to collect comparative data.

40|$|The aim of {{the thesis}} {{is to develop a}} {{numerical}} model based on first principles for the simulation of change of size of soil pores during drying of soft soil. This model is suitable for the type of soil consisting of clay with layered structure, such as Montmorillonite. In this study, the geometry of the soil pore is idealized by a triangle consisting of three sand grains and clay fabrics connecting the sand grains. The simplified structure is named as unit cell in this thesis. The change of size of soil pore results from deformation of clay fabrics, and the clay fabric deforms due to the variation of water content. The length of clay fabric is related to the chemical potential of water by applying the Diffuse Double Layer theory as well as geometrical considerations. The soil mass is modelled by <b>combining</b> <b>unit</b> cells of different original pore sizes, which is randomly generated. The model is built by Matlab. The inputs include soil properties (porosity, clay fraction, lamellar properties, etc) and distribution factors; the outputs are total volume of soil and volume of wate, further derivation gives the Water Retention Curve and Soil Shrinkage Curve. In conclusion, the model is able to provide reasonable prediction of change of soil pore size. The shrinkage of pore due to drying of soil is observed. It is found that the multiple uni...|$|E
