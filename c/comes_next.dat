As of 2014, the United States are the most successful National Olympic Committee (NOC) in Olympic skeleton, having won eight medals (three golds, four silvers and one bronze). Great Britain <b>comes</b> <b>next</b> with six medals (two golds, one silver and three bronzes), and is the only NOC to have collected a medal every Games that skeleton has featured at the Winter Olympics; they have featured particularly strongly in the women's event, with 2 of 4 the gold medalists, and 4 of the 12 total medalists. Thirty medals have been awarded to twenty-six sledders representing nine NOCs.|$|E

25|$|Given {{an overall}} design, {{a good choice}} of {{efficient}} algorithms and data structures, and efficient implementation of these algorithms and data structures <b>comes</b> <b>next.</b> After design, the choice of algorithms and data structures affects efficiency {{more than any other}} aspect of the program. Generally data structures are more difficult to change than algorithms, as a data structure assumption and its performance assumptions are used throughout the program, though this can be minimized by the use of abstract data types in function definitions, and keeping the concrete data structure definitions restricted to a few places.|$|E
25|$|The budget {{restrictions}} imposed {{are shown}} in the table. The first column states whether the council made a rate or set a precept to be collected by other authorities on its behalf.

The maximum rate imposed by the cap (in pence) <b>comes</b> <b>next,</b> followed by the maximum percentage change on 1984/85 rate levels.

25|$|The lion’s {{share of}} {{government}} expenditure on R goes to universities, {{as in most}} countries. This level of spending increased slightly from 58% to 61% of total government funding of R between 2008 and 2012. Among specific sectors, agriculture <b>comes</b> <b>next,</b> in {{a reflection of the}} sector’s relevance for Brazil, the second-largest foodproducing country in the world after the USA. Brazilian agricultural productivity has risen constantly since the 1970s, due to the greater use of innovative technology and processes. Industrial R comes third, followed by health and infrastructure, other sectors having shares of 1% or lower of government expenditure. With some exceptions, the distribution of government spending on R in 2012 is similar to that in 2000. After a sharp increase in industrial technology from 1.4% to 6.8% between 2000 and 2008, its share of government expenditure declined to 5.9% in 2012. The share of space science and technology (civilian) has been pursuing a downward spiral from a high of 2.3% in 2000. Defence research spending had been curtailed from 1.6% to 0.6% between 2000 and 2008 but has since rebounded to 1.0%. Research into energy has also declined from 2.1% (2000) to just 0.3% (2012). Overall, though, the allocation of government R spending seems to be relatively stable.|$|E

500|$|The ride {{begins with}} the floor {{retracting}} {{which leads to the}} front gate opening.

Following the vertical loop, an Immelmann loop <b>comes</b> <b>next,</b> and provides a footchopper element with the pylon. After completing the Immelmann, the train goes through a zero-g roll, where riders experience a feeling of weightlessness. Following the zero-G roll, riders are then inverted twice during the batwing element which leads into the mid-course brake run. A twisting dive to the right immediately follows the brake run and leads into a [...] vertical loop. A series of corners and a corkscrew lead the train to the final brake run and back into the station.|$|E

Kenneth Partridge of The Boombox praised the performance writing that [...] "the R megastar is all growls and snarling glances". He further stated that she looked like [...] "a triumphant rock 'n' roll goddess" [...] while performing [...] "I Care". A writer of The Huffington Post praised the performance writing that [...] "'I Care'... showcases an impressive amount of Beyonce-ness. As she belts the lyrics 'You see these tears falling down to my ears/ I swear you like when I'm in pain/ I try to tell you all my fears/ You still don't care?/ That's okay,' Beyonce bedazzles in a sparkly getup and an impressive amount of hair-whipping."

500|$|Developers tasked both art and map design {{personnel}} {{with creating}} levels, ensuring visual quality. Hall implemented a [...] "grow as you play" [...] philosophy, choosing to show certain features and statistics (like [...] "Beat" [...] {{or the use}} of MysTech) only after the player enabled their use. Developers sought to make the game accessible to expert and casual players through two statistic displays—numerical or qualitative (using categories such as [...] "very good" [...] or [...] "bad"). Hall disparaged complicated number systems found in other games: [...] "One of the things I hate about RPGs is, you've got, like, 'here's this thing and here's that thing' and it's like 'this is 52 and that's 53' I mean, what's the difference? It's like, OK it's 'a point,' and the formula will come up to be like 'two points' and like, sure, that's going to make a difference. So now I have to hit the guy three times..." [...] Hall also sought to ensure players knew their next goal, and invented the character of Fatima Doohan to keep track of missions. Fatima's name is a pun born from the phrase, [...] "What am I doing?" [...] Hall named her after the experience of loading an old saved game in an RPG and having forgotten what <b>comes</b> <b>next</b> in the current quest or storyline.|$|E

Nick witnesses an emergency caesarean section and a suicide in the first; the tension between his parents in the second. The next story, [...] "The End of Something", is also set in Michigan, and details Nick's break-up with his girlfriend; [...] "The Three-Day Blow" [...] follows, where Nick and a friend get drunk. [...] "The Battler" [...] is about Nick's chance encounter with a prize-fighter.

The penultimate [...] "My Old Man" [...] concerns horse-racing in Italy and Paris, and the volume ends with the two-part Nick Adams story [...] "Big Two-Hearted River", set in Michigan.
