These restrictions, imposed by the local maritime administrations, declare the minimum requirements for ships that are given icebreaker assistance, for example [...] "ice class 1A, 2000 DWT". Finnish fairway dues, a system of fees charged for the use of sea lanes to cover the <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> <b>management</b> and icebreaker assistance, also depend on the vessels' ice class. Since ships of lower ice classes generally require more assistance during the winter months, their fairway dues are considerably higher than those of ships of the highest ice classes. For this reason the majority of ships regularly calling Finnish ports are built to the highest ice classes. In the beginning of 2008, 47% of the Finnish tonnage were of ice class 1A Super.|$|E

40|$|Background: There is {{a paucity}} of {{information}} on the actual costs incurred by the family as a result of musculoskeletal injuries due to road traffic crash from our part of India. This study was conducted with the objective to ascertain the <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> initial <b>management</b> <b>of</b> musculoskeletal injuries due to road traffic crashes. Materials and Methods: This prospective study was conducted as a register-based descriptive study in a tertiary care teaching hospital in a rural area (with a predominantly mountainous terrain) of North-West India. All patients with nonfatal musculoskeletal injuries due to road traffic crashes, presenting between 2014 and 2015 and agreeing {{to participate in the study}} were included in the study. Results: Of 313 cases, 116 were managed conservatively, whereas in 189 cases, operative intervention was required. In 8 cases, both the modalities <b>of</b> <b>management</b> were required. The average <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>management</b> was Rs. 20, 386 in operative group. The average cost in the conservative group was Rs. 3726. Average cost calculated for patients in whom both modality of treatment was required was Rs. 24, 000. It was observed that the indirect <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>management</b> was proportionately higher in conservative group. Conclusions: The initial <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>management</b> for patients managed conservatively is less than those managed by operative intervention. Importantly, however, the indirect <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>management</b> is a major contributor to the total <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>management...</b>|$|R

There are two motivations for conducting this study.

40|$|Background: Coronary {{artery disease}} (CAD) {{is the second}} highest cause of {{mortality}} in Hong Kong. The most significant manifestation is acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Both treatment and cardiac rehabilitation for AMI are costly. Knowledge <b>of</b> the <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>management</b> <b>of</b> AMI is important for better planning for allocation of medical resources. The present study aims to evaluate and describe the <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>management</b> <b>of</b> patients with explicit Q-wave AMI in a local public hospital in Hong Kong. Methods: A retrospective study was performed of patients admitted to the United Christian Hospital in Hong Kong. The study cohort consisted of patients who were aged >= 18 years with _a _diagnosis _of _Q-wave _AMI _from 1 January 2000 to 31 December 2000 admitted to the coronary care unit. Cost items studied included hospital stay, outpatient clinic visits, diagnostic tests, medications, and percutaneous coronary interventions. Results: Ninety-five cases were evaluated. The average annual medical cost per patient for AMI management in the year 2000 was $US 9323. 4 +- 5792 ($US 1 = HK$ 7. 8). The total annual cost per patient increased with {{the complexity of the}} disease from $US 7745 +- 6245 for non-fatal AMI without procedure to $US 12 _ 344 +- 3129 for non-fatal AMI with procedure. Based on the local epidemiological data, the prevalence rate of CAD is 2. 2 % and assuming 3 % of patients with CAD may experience AMI with medical care, the estimated total <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> AMI <b>management</b> in Hong Kong was $US 45 million per year or 0. 5 % of the 2000 - 2001 total healthcare expenditure.

Drugs are the most commonly implicated in 95 % of cases. Aims : To audit the causative drugs, clinical outcome, and <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>management</b> in SJS, TEN, and SJS-TEN overlap. Setting and Design: Tertiary care hospitals-based multicentric retrospective study (case series). Materials and Methods : Indoor case papers of SJS, TEN, and SJS-TEN overlap admitted between January 2006 and December 2009 in four tertiary care hospitals of Gujarat were scrutinized. Data were collected for demographic information, causative drugs, investigations, treatment given, duration of hospital stay, time interval between onset of symptoms and drug intake, clinical outcome, and complications. Data were analyzed to find out proportion of individual drugs responsible, major complications, and clinical outcome in SJS, TEN, and SJS-TEN overlap. Total <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>management</b> was calculated by using <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> drugs, investigations, and consumables used during entire hospital stay. Statistical Analysis : One-way Analysis of Variance followed by Tukey-Kramer multiple comparison test was used for comparison of incubation period, duration of hospital stay, and <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>management.</b> Results : Antimicrobials (50 %), nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (22. 41 %), and antiseizure drugs (18. 96 %) were the most commonly associated groups. Nevirapine (28. 12 %) {{was the most common}} drug. Antiseizure drugs were more often associated with serious form of adverse reaction (TEN: 81. 8 %) than other drugs.
