6000|$|... "Is {{that all}} he has to say?" [...] she asked. [...] "You told me he <b>could</b> <b>help</b> us. <b>You</b> led me to suppose he could find the guilty person." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Do {{you think}} I mind that?" [...] she asked eagerly. [...] "The only point worth {{considering}} is, <b>could</b> I <b>help?</b> <b>You</b> know {{in your heart}} {{that you could not}} make me afraid." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "--the same way, you wouldn't mind my trailing, if I didn't sit in too often; and I {{thought maybe}} I <b>could</b> <b>help</b> <b>you</b> if----" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Lister saved Arcturus before I meddled," [...] Barbara {{declared}} with a blush. [...] "However, I'm glad I <b>could</b> <b>help.</b> <b>You</b> {{have often}} helped me." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Ay, Sir Richard," [...] said Foster, [...] "you {{would take}} no advice. I ever {{told you that}} drunken profligate would fail you at need. Now I <b>could</b> have <b>helped</b> <b>you</b> to a sober young man." ...|$|R

60|$|HIGGINS [impressively] Stop. You'll come {{regularly}} {{to see your}} daughter. It's your duty, you know. My brother is a clergyman; and he <b>could</b> <b>help</b> <b>you</b> in your talks with her.|$|E
6000|$|... "You do not {{understand}} the combination that has been effected. <b>You</b> <b>could</b> not <b>help</b> yourself. <b>You</b> would be drafted into the militia." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "How could I?" [...] he {{returned}} eagerly. [...] "For but for THAT how <b>could</b> I <b>help</b> <b>you</b> {{to carry out}} YOUR trust?

6000|$|... "I'm sorry," [...] said Goodwin, {{with equal}} directness, [...] "but you can't have any. You're {{drinking}} yourself to death, Blythe.

6000|$|... "Don't be sensational," [...] {{she said}} with a wave of her hand. [...] "You are prone to exaggeration, and, of course, I will not go with <b>you.</b> How <b>could</b> I <b>help</b> <b>you</b> to chase wild cattle? Now, try to be sensible!
