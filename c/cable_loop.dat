50|$|Two {{types of}} polarential systems, known as types A and B, are in use. In {{half-duplex}} {{operation of a}} type A polarential system, the direct-current balance is independent of line resistance. In half-duplex operation of a type B polarential system, the direct current is substantially independent of the line leakage. Type A is better for <b>cable</b> <b>loops</b> where leakage is negligible but resistance varies with temperature. Type B is considered better for open wire where variable line leakage is frequent.|$|R
50|$|The cable lift {{utilizes}} a <b>cable</b> <b>loop</b> {{in place}} of the traditional chain, which is attached to a short section of chain that engages the trains chain dog. Because a cable is much lighter than a chain, cable lifts are much faster than chain lifts and can be used on much steeper hills - even vertical. A cable also requires far less maintenance than a chain. Another advantage to park guests is that a cable lift is very quiet, partly because the main drive winch is located directly beneath the top of the lift, a location which will normally be relatively far from guest-accessible areas.|$|E
50|$|At {{the tops}} of the lift towers are a series of wheels known as sheaves, or sheave trains as there are almost always more than one in a row. Towers {{typically}} have two sheave trains, one for the uphill-moving side of the <b>cable</b> <b>loop,</b> and one for the downhill side. Upon inspection the next morning, maintenance crews discovered that the sheave train on the downhill side of tower 11 had failed, and that the sheave had turned into the path of a chair and forced it off the cable. The cause was later determined to be a failed bolt, and all of the bolts were replaced.|$|E
5000|$|The {{aerial lift}} line was {{constructed}} by the Austrian Doppelmayr Garaventa Group. With its length of 4359 m, {{it is one of}} the longest passenger-carrying aerial tramway lines in the world. There are four supporting towers located between the two terminals. The aerial tram consists of two passenger cabins, each capable of carrying 80 passengers. Two fixed track cables are for support while one loop of cable, solidly connected to the cabins, is for haulage. An electric motor drives the haulage rope, which provides propulsion. When the cabins arrive at the end stations, the <b>cable</b> <b>loop</b> stops and reverses direction so that the cars shuttle back and forth between the terminals.|$|E

40|$|Abstract- The paper {{presents}} the results of numerical calculations of lightning surge currents and voltages in a telecommunication building during direct strike to the communication tower. The analysis concerned currents in waveguides and DC return conductors, potential differences between various installations and voltages induced in <b>cable</b> <b>loops.</b> The calculations were carried out using a numerical program based on the electromagnetic field theory and the method of moments. Large voltages were observed between isolated cable installations (even those running very close to each other). For cables grounded at one end the corresponding voltages were much lower. ...|$|R

50|$|To {{speed the}} {{movement}} of timbers between the two lakes, the ingenious solution of a cable-drawn steam-powered tramway was implemented. At a neck of land about 3 mi north of the dam, a pair of tracks was laid across the neck (about 3000 ft), and a continuous wire <b>cable</b> <b>loop</b> 6000 ft in length was attached to lumber-carrying trucks. The tramway was powered by large steam boilers located at the Chamberlain Lake end, and was capable of transporting logs at 250 ft per minute, averaging more than 500,000 board-feet of lumber over a typical working day. The tramway was rendered obsolete by {{the invention of the}} Lombard Steam Log Hauler, and ceased operation in 1907.|$|E
50|$|In {{that same}} year, Capital Traction began {{construction}} on a Waddy Wood-designed car barn in Georgetown {{to be called}} Union Station. Union Station was designed to serve four streetcar companies: The old Washington and Georgetown lines would use the ground floor on M Street NW while the Washington, Arlington and Falls Church and the projected Great Falls and Old Dominion were to come across the Potomac from Rosslyn entering {{the second and third}} floors respectively on steel trestles. The Metropolitan would use the roof. In reality, the Virginia companies never used it and the Metropolitan only sparingly so. The Washington and Great Falls took over the third floor. The station opened on May 27, 1897 and contained Washington's only <b>cable</b> <b>loop.</b>|$|E
50|$|An {{aerial tramway}} {{consists}} {{of one or}} two fixed cables (called track cables), one loop of cable (called a haulage rope), and a number of passenger cabins. The fixed cables provide support for the cabins while the haulage rope, by means of a grip, is solidly connected to the truck (the wheel set that rolls on the track cables). An electric motor drives the haulage rope which provides propulsion. Aerial tramways are constructed as reversible systems; vehicles shuttling back and forth between two end terminals and propelled by a <b>cable</b> <b>loop</b> which stops and reverses direction when the cabins arrive at the end stations. Aerial tramways differ from gondola lifts in that gondola lifts are considered continuous systems (cabins attached onto a circulating haul rope that moves continuously).|$|E
50|$|Cable locks are in {{many ways}} similar to chain locks. Cable locks often come with the locking {{mechanism}} already permanently integrated. Otherwise, a length of <b>cable</b> with <b>loops</b> on both ends can also be used.|$|R
50|$|The LZB {{control center}} {{communicates}} with the train using conductor <b>cable</b> <b>loops.</b> Loops {{can be as}} short as 50 meters long, as used at the entrance and exit to LZB controlled track, or as long as 12.7 km. Where the loops are longer than 100 m they are crossed every 100 m. At the crossing the signal phase angle is changed by 180¬∞ reducing electrical interference between the track and the train as well as long-distance radiation of the signal. The train detects this crossing and uses it to help determine its position. Longer loops are generally fed from the middle rather than an end.|$|R
50|$|The {{initial setup}} is four 3-car trains (113 {{passengers}} each train), {{but the system}} can accommodate an expansion to four 4-car trains (148 passengers each train). The system has four <b>cable</b> <b>loops</b> and one train per cable. The system uses a pinched-loop configuration, with two lines that merge into a single track just before each terminus. Cars switch cables during dwell time at the station. The trains automatically switch cables four times: once at each end, and halfway between the two stops at the wheelhouse, near the intersection of Hegenberger Road and Airport Access Road. The wheelhouse has four 12 ft drive wheels that move the cables.|$|R
5000|$|A {{hydraulic}} launch track has a trough {{running along}} its center, a [...] "catch car" [...] that {{connects to the}} train for launching travels through this trough. The catch car is connected to a <b>cable</b> <b>loop</b> that runs along {{the entire length of}} the launch track, anchored by a pulley wheel at the near end of the track and by the launch motor itself at the far end. The launch motor is located in a small building under the end of the launch track. Only about 2/3 of the length of this type of launch track can be used for launching the train, as the catch car must be stopped after it disengages from the train. This type of propulsion is capable of catapulting a train to very high speeds, yet is only used mostly by Intamin, and less abundantly used by Vekoma, in their Accelerator coasters and Motorbike coasters, respectively. An example of an Intamin manufactured launch system is the Formula Rossa in Abu Dhabi, which accelerates the coaster train to its top speed of 240 km/h (150 mph) in approximately 5 seconds.|$|E

Taking into account the compactness of TCC and the isometry between TCC loop and OCS-R loop, the coupling between TCC loop and OCS-R loop can be ignored generally in the analysis and calculation.

60|$|The thickset man {{had been}} pacing the room fretfully, and now turned {{and went through the}} archway towards the balcony, from which the noise of a distant crowd still came in gusts and cadences. The crop-headed lad handed the tailor a roll of the bluish satin and the two began fixing this in the {{mechanism}} in a manner reminiscent of a roll of paper in a nineteenth century printing machine. Then they ran the entire thing on its easy, noiseless bearings across the room to a remote corner where a twisted <b>cable</b> <b>looped</b> rather gracefully from the wall.

50|$|Some gravity railroads were {{designed}} to allow {{the weight of the}} descending loaded cars to lift the empty cars back up to the top, using a <b>cable</b> <b>looped</b> around a pulley at the top for a portion of the line. A later revision designed by John B. Jervis, used two separate tracks known as the loaded or heavy track which carried cars loaded with coal to the destination, and the light track, used to return empty cars to the mines. This method allowed cars to travel in a loop, without the need for passing sidings. A stationary steam engine and a <b>looping</b> <b>cable,</b> chain or iron bands were used to raise the empty cars up the lift planes. The cars then coasted down a slight grade to the next lift plane. When cars reversed direction at the ends of the line on a switch or turnout instead of a loop, the railroad was known as a switchback gravity railroad.|$|R
50|$|The tram was {{constructed}} {{along the same}} lines as a modern ski lift. A continuous wire cable ran in a loop carrying 130 lb feed sacks. The weight of the sacks as they descended operated the tram, with 64 loaded sacks and 64 empties over the length of the tram. A brakeman at the upper terminal controlled the rate of descent, squeezing the cable with a grip brake. At either end the <b>cable</b> <b>loops</b> back on an 8 ft diameter wheel. The towers are of wood construction, between 6 ft and 13 ft high. The original terminal and lowermost towers were submerged when the level of the Snake was raised 50 ft by the construction of Lower Granite Dam.|$|R
