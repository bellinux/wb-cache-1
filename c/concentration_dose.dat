40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} was to test and compare the effect of four {{selected}} and in present commonly used medical treatments on other species of fish in recirculating aquaculture system (RAS). This presented work was divided into two separate experiments dealing with curative baths for fry of pikeperch. The fry was raised in ponds, feeded by natural food, {{with the intention of}} adaptating for RAS after a bath. Baths were targeted against parasitic and bacterial diseases by using Bellasav, SAVO Original, formaldehyde and Chloramine T. The curative baths took 30 minutes after which the fish were transferred to clean water where the mortality within 24 hours and the efficacy of the preparation within 24 hours was monitored. In the first experiment were used fish with an average weight of 0. 23 +- 0. 05 g and a total lenght of 31. 7 +- 2. 5 mm at the age of 35 days. The tested doses were 0. 5; 1; 1. 5; 2; 5; 10 and 50 ml. m- 3 for Bellasav, 1; 5; 10; 20 and 50 ml. m- 3 for SAVO Original, 0. 5; 1; 1. 5; 2. 5; 5; 10; 15; 30; 45 and 50 ml. 100 l- 1 for formaldehyde and 10; 20; 30; 40; 50; 100; 150 and 200 mg. l- 1 for Chloramine T. The best efficacy was achieved at the <b>concentration</b> <b>dose</b> 1. 5 ml. m- 3 for Bellasav. The <b>concentration</b> <b>dose</b> 10 ml. m- 3 of SAVO Original only reduced parasitic infection by one degree. An effective dose of formaldehyde was 1 ml. 100 l- 1 which reduced the parasitic infection by two degrees. The most effective preparation was Chloramine T at the <b>concentration</b> <b>dose</b> of 30 mg. l- 1. In the second experiment were used fish with an average weight of 1. 6 +- 0. 4 g and a total lenght of 60. 4 +- 3. 56 mm at the age of 70 days. The tested doses were 10; 20 and 50 ml. m- 3 for Bellasav, 10; 20 and 50 ml. m- 3 for SAVO Original, 2. 5; 5 and 10 ml. 100 l- 1 for formaldehyde and 40; 150 and 200 mg. l- 1 for Chloramine T. The best efficacy was achieved at the <b>concentration</b> <b>dose</b> 20 ml. m- 3 for Bellasav and 10 ml. m- 3 for SAVO Original. The most effective dose for formaldehyde was 2. 5 ml. 100 l- 1 which reduced the bacterial infection in fish skin by two degrees.

40|$|BACKGROUND: CYP 3 A 5 and MDR 1 polymorphisms {{have been}} shown to {{influence}} tacrolimus blood <b>concentrations</b> and <b>dose</b> requirements. The aim is to determine whether these polymorphisms also affect sirolimus trough <b>concentrations</b> and <b>dose</b> requirements after kidney transplantation. METHODS: Eighty-five renal transplant recipients receiving sirolimus were included. Twenty-four were treated with a combined sirolimus-tacrolimus regimen. Eighty-one patients received steroids. Sirolimus and tacrolimus were adjusted to a target therapeutic window. CYP 3 A 5 (intron 3) and MDR 1 (exons 12, 21, 26) genotypes were correlated to the adjusted trough <b>concentrations</b> and <b>dose</b> requirements for both sirolimus and tacrolimus. RESULTS: There were no significant correlation between adjusted sirolimus trough <b>concentrations</b> or <b>dose</b> requirements and genetic polymorphisms. In a multiple regression model, adjusted-prednisone dose was involved with a positive or negative effect when considering sirolimus dose requirements or adjusted concentrations, respectively. In the subgroup of patients treated by tacrolimus and sirolimus, adjusted tacrolimus doses were higher in patients carrying at least one CYP 3 A 5 * 1 allele (median 0. 083 vs. 0. 035 mg/kg for CYP 3 A 5 * 3 /* 3 patients, P< 0. 05). Adjusted-prednisolone dose and CYP 3 A 5 polymorphism explained up to 61 % of the variability in tacrolimus dose requirements. CONCLUSIONS: Unlike tacrolimus, sirolimus adjusted trough <b>concentrations</b> and <b>dose</b> requirements seem not affected by CYP 3 A 5 and MDR 1 polymorphisms.

This study aimed to evaluate, through a systematic literature review, if there is scientific evidence ensuring the safe and effective use of natural product(s) -containing mouthwashes as adjunctive treatment of biofilm-induced gingivitis. Searches were conducted in the databases Medline, SciELO, LILACS and Cochrane Library, by using combinations of the key words gingivitis/natural products/phytotherapy/mouthwash, in English, Portuguese and Spanish. Studies published until September 2010 were considered.
