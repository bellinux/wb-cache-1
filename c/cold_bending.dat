5000|$|Unique tower {{envelope}} made of cold-bent glass {{emphasizes the}} lightness and {{dynamic of the}} form visually denying the gravity force. Two hundred meters high sculpture, crafted of materials traditionally believed to be fragile and inflexible, symbolizes the idea of evolution spiral as the pinnacle of progress {{and the power of}} human intellect, challenging the forces of nature and the laws of physics. Original façade concept and innovative construction technology allow to create visually organic and flowing 3D form. Double curved tower envelope is provided by the <b>cold</b> <b>bending</b> of reflective glass units. The innovative cold-bent glazing in the curtain wall uses flat double glazed units cold-formed in 3D within the aluminum frame to avoid stepping in geometry. This approach appeared to be both more energy-efficient and more cost-efficient solution in comparison to the stepped curtain wall units previously applied in some twisted unitized facades. During factory fabrication the glass unit is placed in the twisted aluminum frame horizontally and then takes curved shape by its own weight without any thermal treatment. Maximum corner deformation does not exceed 50 mm relative to the opposite corner of the unit. Finally façade looks like continuously twisted spiral glass surface. Currently this curtain wall is the world’s largest cold bent façade in terms of the area in one building. Organic cold-bent glazed ribbon with constant leaning angle at the corners (approx. 14 degrees vertically) creates a stunning optical illusion reflecting the surrounding cityscape vertically with 90-degree twist.Evolution tower total façade area is 40,500 sq m, including 34,500 sq m of the typical facade areas from 3-rd to 51-st level. On each floor the curtain wall consists of 108 parallelogram façade panels 4.3 m high and 1.5m wide. 27 of them have 2 types of different sizes that vary with twist angle from +14 to -14 that largely complicated the construction logistics. However the implementation of this façade structure was successful due to involvement of German façade company Joseph Gartner (Permasteelisa Group) in design and production of tower curtain wall, atrium glazing and canopies /entrances. The company was selected through the tender with 30 façade manufacturers competing for a prestigious contract. The aluminum profiles were extruded in Russia at a specially arranged production line. Despite glass units fabrication in Germany with all associated delivery and customs duties the overall façade cost per m2 remained within the budget of a ‘standard’ benchmark high-rise tower, that was an achievement of German logistics. Double glazed units with energy-efficient multi-functional glass (manufactured by Guardian) provide the energy efficiency and thermal insulation parameters (U-Value) similar to those of standard triple glazed units but with less weight in panoramic floor to ceiling application. The units themselves were assembled in Germany by BGT, who provided long-time warranty for cold bent heat-strengthened glass in a result of multiple tests. Transparent double glazed units consist of triplex 8+6mm from heat-strengthened glass from the outside and 8mm Guardian Standard HP Neutral 60/40 tempered glass on the inside with application of energy efficient coating, significantly reducing the solar gain whilst providing the double glazed unit thermal performance equal to a standard triple glazed unit normally used in Moscow to withstand harsh winter conditions. Guardian SunGuard production technology allows to create almost perfect combination of transparent and spandrel façade areas. Guardian magnetron coating has a special feature - it is colored outside and transparent on the inside, which does not distort the view color unlike tinted glass in mass. With no color filter (color is from the coating, not from coloured glass) the high color quality provides comfortable environment inside the building given that the glass panel is 3m high (floor to ceiling) the perfect daylighting is provided in the office spaces. Glass unit formula with heat-strengthened triplex outside and tempered glass inside allows bending of the unit in installation position to achieve required façade geometry providing additional safety of envelope structure , as in case of destruction the tempered glass (5 times stronger than usual) is fractured in small pieces and triplex lamination film protects it from falling out. Heat strengthened glass triplex gains additional strength and reduces the risk of glass destruction via associated heat soak tests as part of the production process.|$|E
40|$|AbstractCold bending {{of glass}} {{involves}} the straining of relatively thin glass components, (typically plates), at ambient temperatures, {{and is a}} low energy and cost effective manner of creating curvilinear forms required in modern glass applications. <b>Cold</b> <b>bending</b> is also popular because it is thought to eliminate the optical imperfections in curved glass plates that arise during alternative and more conventional thermal bending techniques. Experimental and numerical investigations on the <b>cold</b> <b>bending</b> of monolithic glass plates into anticlastic shapes are undertaken and described in this paper. The aim is to characterise the <b>cold</b> <b>bending</b> behaviour during the bending process and to evaluate the surface/optical quality of the curved plates. Two distinct phenomena of interest are observed: (i) {{a change in the}} deformation mode that under particular boundary and loading conditions lead to snap-through buckling and; (ii) a local instability termed “cold bending distortion” that appears on curved plates when certain applied displacement limits are exceeded. This <b>cold</b> <b>bending</b> distortion is found to occur at stresses significantly below the fracture strength of the glass plate, but the distortions can be sufficiently large to breach optical serviceability requirements.

Additions are allowed only {{if they do not}} detract from the interesting parts of the building, integrate harmoniously, yet are distinguishable to prevent architectural falsification of the monument. Completely transparent additions to historic buildings of structural glass can be an answer to all the above demands. As a research into these possibilities, a refurbishment proposal is made for the Ruin of Teylingen in the Netherlands. Here the original wood roof that is missing, is replaced by a structural glass roof. As a design research, the glass roof design has been elaborated in this graduation. The roof has the same shape and size of the original roof, and closes off the donjon, allowing a new function to be put in the castle. Laminated heat-strengthened glass beams are connected to a slender steel contour frame. To create a fluid curvature, laminated heat-treated <b>cold</b> <b>bend</b> glass panels are used, which are held in place by clamping joints, connected onto the glass beams. Passive climate measures are used to prevent overheating of the glass roof. A glass floor allows the roof {{to be used as a}} lookout point over the refurbished area around the castle.

The product of the design process is an plausible and elegant solution for covering the historic building with an all glass roof that respects the historical and aesthetical value of the monument.

Due to the operational loads, changes in the pipe horizontal and vertical alignment, and variations in the soil type, axial loads and bending moments are generated along the pipeline. Through the {{wall thickness}} transition, stress concentrations develop due to the differences in pipe geometry, stiffness, material grade and mechanical strength. Current engineering practice and standards provide guidance on back-bevel design for wall thickness transitions. An alternative configuration, the counterbore-taper design recommended by TranCanada PipeLines, is intended to reduce stress concentration effect across the transition, facilitate welding processes, and improve NDT quality, productivity and reliability. Through a parametric study, using finite element methods, the relative mechanical response of the back-bevel and counterbore-taper wall thickness transition is evaluated. The numerical modelling procedures are verified with analytical equations and numerical simulations available {{in the public domain}} literature. The influence of element type, mesh topology, wall thickness mismatch (t₂/t₁), material grade on the limit load, pressure containment response, associated with the onset of plastic collapse, are evaluated. In terms of strength performance associated with stress concentration effects, the significance of element type, mesh topology, pipe diameter (D), pipe diameter to wall thickness ratio (D/t), wall thickness mismatch (t₂/t₁), material grade on the limit load, counterbore length, taper angle and radial girth weld offset (i. e., Hi-Lo) are examined. The improved performance of the counterbore-taper weld transition; relative to the back-bevel design as recommended by current practice, was demonstrated in this study through equivalent limit load capacity for pressure containment and reduction in the stress concentration factor for combined loading. The minimum counterbore length was found to be consistent with industry recommended practices, and was related to the pipe diameter and wall thickness mismatch. Guidance on the selection of joining methods to advance current engineering practice is provided...|$|R

40|$|Four flex {{circuits}} were tested. They are categorized as: (1) Litchfield narrow; (2) Litchfield wide; (3) Cirexx wide; and (4) Speedy Circuit green. The {{cross sectional}} area of copper was calculated from trace resistance measurements. All the flex circuits had an acceptable amount of copper cross section. about 6 e- 8 m{sup 2 } for all except the Cirexx flex which had 4. 5 e- 8 m{sup 2 }. The thickness of the ribbons was 0. 006 -inch for the Litchfield and about 0. 004 -inch for the Cirexx and Speed circuit. The room temperature resistivity ratio (RRR) {{was measured to be}} 15 for all the circuits. This was expected and means that the trace material resistivity at helium temperatures is 1 / 15 th of what it is at room temperature. This is good from the standpoint of thermal heat load. Purer copper, with an RRR > 30 would result in an unacceptable heat load. The cryogenic cycling and bending tests to liquid nitrogen proved that both the Cirexx wide and Speedy circuit green were made of acceptable materials. Both Litchfield flex circuits had significant cracking of the coverlay when bent at cold temperatures and are not acceptable. The Litchfield narrow was in bad physical condition to start with and got worse through the testing with many more crazing cracks appearing. The crazing is bad enough that the coverlay began to peel and expose the copper beneath. This candidate is unacceptable. The Litchfield wide started out testing in good condition with no cracks. It ended up with much crazing in the coverlay. Within 1 mm of the edge of the coverlay at the cold end. the copper traces were bulged away from the base material. Traces became nadhered and lifted off of the base material at the ends where the coverlay was not present. Numerous electrical opens (7 out of 24 checked) were found {{at the end of the}} testing.

40|$|The {{demand for}} flat glass {{is high and}} {{increasing}} significantly in the building industry {{as a direct result}} of architectural requirements for lightness, transparency and natural light. Current architectural trends require glass in curvilinear forms for smooth free-form façades. Two principal challenges arise from this: to cost-effectively produce the desired curvature and; to ensure its safe performance after exposure to ageing. The recent availability of high strength glass provides an opportunity to address the first challenge by developing cold bent glass. <b>Cold</b> <b>bending</b> involves the straining of relatively thin glass components, at ambient temperatures, and is a low energy and cost effective manner of creating curvilinear forms. However, <b>cold</b> <b>bending</b> is not yet widely established as a reliable method. The aim of this thesis is to develop the understanding of cold bent glass during the bending process and to evaluate its post-ageing performance. This thesis, firstly, investigates the mechanical response of monolithic glass plates during the <b>cold</b> <b>bending</b> process. The stability of cold bent glass is investigated experimentally by bending it in double curved anticlastic shapes. A parametric numerical analysis involves different boundary conditions, geometrical plate characteristics and bending parameters. The principal outcome is that a local instability, now termed <b>cold</b> <b>bending</b> distortion, occurs when certain displacement limits are exceeded and could degrade the optical quality of the glass. An evaluation procedure is also formulated to set limits and aid designers/manufacturers to predict the mechanical response and the optical quality of the glass. Cold bent glass is subjected to permanent bending stresses throughout its service life and therefore, its strength degradation after ageing needs to be quantified. Analytical, experimental and numerical investigations are undertaken in this thesis to identify the most effective method for estimating glass strength (evaluation of destructive tests, required number of specimens, statistical analysis methods and sub-critical crack growth). The limited availability of naturally aged toughened glass and the absence of a reliable ageing standard impede the evaluation of its aged performance. Therefore, a parametric experimental investigation of artificial ageing methods on glass is undertaken in this thesis. A procedure for the evaluation of the strength of aged glass is finally, formulated to allow the selection of artificial ageing parameters that correspond to a target level of erosion. The knowledge on artificial ageing and strength prediction acquired above is finally implemented on different types of glass to determine their strength after ageing and assess their safe use in <b>cold</b> <b>bending</b> / load bearing applications. The investigation showed that fully toughened glass has a superior performance to chemically toughened or annealed glass. Overall, the research presented in this thesis demonstrates that high quality cold bent toughened glass can be created when certain applied displacement limits are respected. These can be used as a safe, cost-effective and energy efficient replacement to the more conventional hot bent glass. However, <b>cold</b> <b>bending</b> / load bearing applications in which the stressed glass surface is exposed to ageing, require glass with a relatively high case depth such as fully toughened or bi-tempered glass.

40|$|A {{criterion}} for selecting a coating for an energy pipeline {{is that the}} coating should have a suitable flexibility to meet the high strain demand during hydrostatic testing and during field bending. This requires knowledge {{of the level of}} strain demand for the pipeline, and also the maximum strain that could be tolerated by the coating system. Whereas average strains imposed during manufacturing and construction are reasonably well predicted, there is insufficient understanding on the factors leading to localised deformation of the pipe. Significant work has been carried out in the past to develop tests for assessing the coatings’ ability to handle a certain amount of strain based on bend testing, tensile testing and burst testing. However, there is a concern as to whether these tests properly represent localised micro-strains associated with construction activities including field bending and pressure testing, particularly pressure testing of pipelines designed for operation at 80 % of specified minimum yield strength (SMYS). Consequently coatings considered "suitable" for modern pipelines may fail. The first issue discussed in this paper is main factors affecting strain localisation. The non-deterministic distributions of heterogeneities over the pipe provide a ground to consider the mechanisms of localisation as a stochastic process. An approach is proposed to quantify the maximum localised strain demand through <b>cold</b> field <b>bending</b> and hydrostatic experiments. Another issue discussed in this paper is the experimental assessment of coating flexibility under the effects of localised strains.

The {{purpose of this study is}} to investigate the corrosion (basically pitting) resistant property of cold deformed Duplex and Super Duplex materials namely UNS S 32205 and UNS S 32750 respectively. The bended tubes 2. 5 ND and 5 ND were studied and compared with the straight tubes of same materials. Accelerated coupon testing (ASTM G 48) and electrochemical method (ASTM G 61) were followed to accomplish the objective of this study. ASTM G 48 Test method was performed to know about the pitting corrosion behaviour of material at different temperatures. Weight loss per unit area was measured after exposure at acidic environment at different temperature for different exposure duration. ASTM G 61 method was adopted to determine the pitting potential for each specimens and also to find the crevice/pitting susceptibility for each specimen. The results show that the corrosion resistant property of material decreases with temperature. The pitting and crevice resistant properties of cold deformed duplex and super duplex tubes were found to be similar to that of straight tubes. No specific patterns were observed in weight loss of straight and bended parts. The specimens’ weight loss per unit area was found to be under the acceptance criteria according to NORSOK Standard MDS- 630. Similarly, the pitting potential of straight and bended parts for both duplex and super duplex were found to be in the similar range of about 1 V. The hardness of bended material was observed to be higher than straight one but the hardness decreased slightly after accelerated coupon testing...|$|R
40|$|The {{main lines}} of {{discussion}} and {{analysis for the}} LHC dipole geometry {{are related to the}} shape of the cold mass at different stages of production and tests. The limitations in the stability of the cold mass shape induces constraints for the positioning of the spool pieces (feed down effects), for the flanges (interconnectivity) and the overall shape (aperture considerations). The geometry after acceptance in industry may change by the time of measurements at CERN. Tolerances that are needed by hardware and by beam physics will be reviewed. GEOMETRY OF THE DIPOLE The theoretical geometry of the dipole is shown in figure 1, and a table of some of the important parameters are given in table 1. The (x,y) plane is the plane of the accelerator. The two theoretical beam-trajectories (the two bent curves in figure 1) consist of an arc of a circle with the angle Θ and the radius ρ and of straight lines between magnets. The 3 dimensional measurements of the centre of the two cold bore tubes are fitted to the two theoretical curves. The plane obtained in this way is called the mean plane and the axes the geometrical axes.

40|$|Abstract. Longitudinal crack on HRB 335 {{hot-rolled}} ribbed bar {{surface in}} <b>cold</b> <b>bending</b> test in HISCO {{was ever a}} problem that caused great economic losses. To find the main reason, continuous cast product macro-acid etching test，metallographic examination，scanning electron microscope and EDAX are carried out. It is regarded that the defect is mainly caused by serious subsurface blowholes and internal cracks in the cast product，which can run through the surface in the later hot working process and are oxidized. As a result, the inner surface of these defects can not be welded-on in the rolling process and the cracks happen finally. Related measures are suggested to eliminate the defect...|$|E
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} is to evaluate the through thickness residual stresses distribution in the walls and in the corners of a cold-formed open section made of a material presenting a non linear hardening behaviour. To get results {{as close as possible to}} the reality, the complete process is modeled, including coiling and uncoiling of the sheet before the <b>cold</b> <b>bending</b> of the corner itself. The elastic springback after flattening as well as after final shaping are also taken into account. In order to validate the model in predicting the residual stresses distribution, the presented results are confronted to experimental measurements and FE results collected from the literature.

40|$|During recent years, SKI has {{supported}} research work {{to study the}} creep and creep crack growth (CCG) behaviour in low alloy reactor pressure vessel steel (ASTM A 508 class 2). The main reason for this initiative was observations of creep failure {{in a number of}} <b>cold</b> worked pipe <b>bends</b> in conventional power plants at relatively low temperatures (360 oC). These failures have occurred after service lives from 8000 to 100000 hours. The Swedish nuclear power plants are normally operating at temperatures between 280 oC and 320 oC, which are below the limit temperature for design against creep for the above mentioned material. Purpose of the project The purpose of the research work, which has been carried out in stages, was to investigate if CCG occurs in a low alloy reactor pressure vessel material below limit temperature, to study the CCG behaviour and {{to examine the effects of}} microstructure, chemical composition and temperature on the CCG and creep failure. In the first study the notch sensitivity of A 508 material under constant load conditions was studied at 360 oC. After that a second stage was started in which creep crack growth was studied at 420 and 360 oC...|$|R
40|$|The flow {{distribution}} in the primary circuit of the pressurized water reactor was studied with experiments and Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations. The main focus was on the flow field and mixing in the downcomer of the pressure vessel: how the different factors like the orientation of operating loops, the total loop flow rate and the asymmetry of the loop flow rates affect the outcome. In addition to the flow field studies the overall applicability of CFD methods for primary circuit thermal-hydraulic analysis was evaluated based on the CFD simulations of the mixing experiments of the ROCOM (Rossendorf Coolant Mixing Model) test facility and the mixing experiments of the Paks NPP. The experimental {{part of the work}} in work package 3 included series of steady state mixing experiments with the ROCOM test facility and the publication of results of Paks VVER- 440 NPP thermal mixing experiments. The ROCOM test facility models a 4 -loop KONVOI type reactor. In the steady-state mixing experiments the velocity field in the downcomer was measured using laser Doppler anemometry and the concentration of the tracer solution fed from one loop was measured at the downcomer and at the core inlet plane. The varied parameters were the number and orientation of the operating loops, the total flow rate and the (asymmetric) flow rate of individual loops. The Paks NPP thermal mixing experiments took place during commissioning tests of replaced steam generator safety valves in 1987 - 1989. It was assumed that in the reactor vessels of Paks VVER- 440 NPP equipped with six loops the mixing of the coolant is not ideal. For the realistic determination of the active core inlet temperature field for the transients and accidents associated with different level temperature asymmetry a set of mixing factors were determined. Based on data from the online core monitoring system and a separate mathematical model the mixing factors for loop flows at the core inlet were determined. In the numerical simulation part of the work package 3 the detailed measurements of ROCOM tests were used for the validation of CFD methods for primary circuit studies. The selected steady state mixing experiments were simulated with CFD codes CFX- 4, CFX- 5 and FLUENT. The velocity field in the downcomer and the mixing of the scalar were compared between CFD simulations and experiments. The CFD simulations of full scale PWR included the simulation of Paks VVER- 440 mixing experiment and the simulation of Loviisa VVER- 440 downcomer flow field. In the simulations of Paks experiments the experimental and simulated concentration field at the core inlet were compared and conclusions made concerning the results overall and the VVER- 440 specific geometry modelling aspects like how to model the perforated elliptic bottom plate and what is the effect of the <b>cold</b> leg <b>bends</b> to the flow field entering to the downcomer. With Loviisa simulations the qualitative comparison was made against the original commissioning experiments but the emphasis was on the CFD method validation and testing. The overall conclusion concerning the CFD modelling of the flow field and mixing in the PWR primary circuit could be that the current computation capacity and physical models also in commercial codes is beginning to be sufficient for simulations giving reliable and useful results for many real primary circuit applications. However the misuse of CFD methods is easy, and the general as well as the nuclear power specific modelling guidelines should be followed when the CFD simulations are made...|$|R
