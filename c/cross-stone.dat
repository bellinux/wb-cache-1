60|$|These {{stones at}} Stonehenge, as Mr. Camden {{describes}} them, {{and in which}} others agree, were very large, though not so large--the upright stones twenty-four feet high, seven feet broad, sixteen feet round, and weigh twelve tons each; and the <b>cross-stones</b> on the top, which he calls coronets, were six or seven tons. But this does not seem equal; for if the <b>cross-stones</b> weighed six or seven tons, the others, as they appear now, were at least {{five or six times}} as big, and must weigh in proportion; and therefore I must think their judgment much nearer the case who judge the upright stones at sixteen tons or thereabouts (supposing them to stand a great way into the earth, as it is not doubted but they do), and the coronets or <b>cross-stones</b> at about two tons, which is very large too, and as much as their bulk can be thought to allow.|$|R

60|$|The {{form of this}} {{monument}} is {{not only}} described but delineated in most authors, and, indeed, {{it is hard to}} know the first but by the last.

The main stones were placed upright, and they were joined on the top by <b>cross-stones,</b> laid from one to another, and fastened with vast mortises and tenons. Length of time has so decayed them that not only most of the <b>cross-stones</b> which lay on the top are fallen down, but many of the upright also, notwithstanding the weight of them is so prodigious great. How they came thither, or from whence (no stones of that kind being now to be found in that part of England near it) is still the mystery, for they are of such immense bulk that no engines or carriages which we have in use in this age could stir them.|$|R
