5000|$|Mechanism for benefit: A DISC {{contracts}} with a producer or reseller of U.S. made goods or provider of certain qualifying <b>construction-related</b> <b>services</b> to provide [...] "services" [...] to such related supplier for a fee. The fee is determined under formulas and rules {{defined in the}} law and regulations. [...] Under these regulations, the fee is deductible by the related supplier and results in a specified net profit to the DISC. This net profit {{is not subject to}} Federal income tax. The DISC then distributes the profit to its shareholders, who are taxable on the income as a qualified dividend. [...] If the shareholders are U.S. resident individuals or others eligible for the reduced rate of tax (now between 0% and 20%, depending on ordinary income level) on qualified dividends, then the tax rate on the income allocated to the DISC is reduced.|$|E
40|$|The {{utilisation}} of nighttime highway {{construction has}} increased {{in recent years in}} order to minimise daytime <b>construction-related</b> <b>service</b> disruptions and traffic congestion. In this type of nighttime construction, lighting arrangements need to be properly designed and implemented in order to enhance safety and productivity on site, and ensure full compliance with the required lighting specifications. A number of field experiments were conducted to evaluate the performance of various lighting arrangements in three typical highway construction zones, namely: activity area, transition and termination areas and flagger stations. In each of these zones, a number of practical lighting arrangements were found to be capable of satisfying all the lighting design criteria required by various Departments of Transportation. The experimental results also confirm that the set-up of lighting equipment on site has a significant impact on lighting performance, and therefore lighting arrangements should be carefully designed and executed on nighttime highway construction projects. Highway construction, workspace, nighttime construction, computer models, light,...|$|R

40|$|Since 1996, the Greater Brooklyn Business Association (GBBA) of Portland, Oregon {{has worked}} with the {{community}} and other organizations to assist in the production of several planning documents related to the revitalization of the business environment in the Brooklyn area. Previous studies have focused primarily on transportation related planning concerns surrounding Southeast Powell Boulevard and main street community development issues associated with Southeast Milwaukie Avenue. This study builds on previous planning efforts to provide the GBBA with: a profile of existing businesses; documentation of business concerns and planning needs; a document {{that can be used for}} future involvement and lobbying efforts; and recommendations to increase business participation and cohesion. Information for this study was gathered through a combination of primary and secondary sources, including survey results, site visits, interviews, and the Oregon Employment Department (OED) database. Using the OED database, this study identifies and analyzes the top five industry groups within the district. The industry groups most frequently found in the district are <b>construction-related,</b> I creative <b>services,</b> automotive-related, food related and health and social services. A sample survey of businesses yielded valuable information regarding issues affecting business operations and planning concerns in the district. A copy of the survey and its results are included in this document as Appendix A. In addition to the survey, interviews of a sampling of businesses within the GBBA area were conducted in order to gather more specific qualitative information...|$|R

40|$|STATE-FUNDED DESIGN AND ENGINEERING SERVICES. INITIATIVE CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT. Prohibits {{contracting}} where {{performance of}} work by civil service employees is less costly unless urgent need for contract. Prohibits contracts which Controller or awarding agency determines are against public interest, health, safety or where quality of work would be lower than civil service work. Contractors must indemnify state in suits related to performance of contracts. Requires defined competitive bidding of state-funded design and engineering contracts over 50, 000, unless delay from bidding would endanger public health or safety. Provisions severable and should be harmonized with similar measures on subject. Summary of Legislative Analyst 2 ̆ 7 s Estimate of Net State and Local Government Fiscal Impact: Unknown impact on {{state and local government}} costs to obtain <b>construction-related</b> <b>services.</b> Impact would depend largely on factors included in the cost comparison analyses required by the proposition.

40|$|The {{shift in}} {{municipal}} procurement of <b>construction-related</b> <b>services</b> from technical departments to central departments of procurement has significant {{impacts on the}} selection criteria and processes. These new roles and decision-making contexts (increased regulative complexity, stricter control and outsourcing of wider ranges of municipal services) are examined for how they shape procurement practices for architectural and engineering services in Swedish municipalities. Based on a critical theoretical review of policy implementation and inter-professional collaboration, the purchasing practices of five Swedish municipalities are examined and compared through case study interviews to understand the relationships and practices that occur between technical and procurement staff. Resource constraints and stricter control are found {{to lead to a}} strong preference, especially among technical staff, for simplified procurement models with a high emphasis on lowest price, whilst procurement staff favour more advanced methods for quality assessment. However, differences in knowledge and professional culture between the technical staff and procurement staff have created barriers to communication and competence integration. To develop a procurement practice that rewards supplier competence, clearer guidelines and changes to procurement roles within the client organization are needed, as well as increased resources. Procurement policies need to be more closely tied to their implementation...|$|E
40|$|Leadership—it is a {{difficult}} phenomenon to precisely define, and perhaps even more importantly, {{it is difficult to}} identify the effects thereof. In business, it is believed that leadership is important, that it really matters. There have been countless books written on the subject. There have been numerous researchers who have tried to debunk all the myths and rumors, using qualitative, quantitative, and mixed methods research strategies. Over time, leadership theories have changed. Theories that include trait- centered leadership, situational leadership, servant leadership, democratic leadership, Laissez-faire leadership, Theory X, Theory Y, and others have been well documented and researched. Transactional leadership and transformational leadership theories are fairly new concepts on the leadership landscape. Both have provided revolutionary ideas into the way leadership is viewed today. Industrial distribution is an integral component to the manufacturing industry. For many companies, in many different market segments, industrial distributors provide a channel to the market for their products. Therefore, the health and success of industrial distribution companies are critical for the overall strength of the U. S. economy. There has been little research conducted on the effect of leadership at industrial distributors, specifically at the branch level. So, does leadership really matter? This research attempts to quantitatively examine the benefits, or effects of, transformational and transactional leadership style on the success of industrial distributors, at the branch level. Using the Multilevel Leadership Questionnarie (MLQ), leadership data were gathered from both leaders and followers at the branch level of industrial distributors engaged in the sale of <b>construction-related</b> goods and <b>services.</b> Moderated multiple regression techniques were used to analyze the data collected on independent variables (transformational and transactional leadership), moderating variables (age, duration, education, and experience), and the dependent variables (sales and margin). The results of the analysis indicate that transformational leadership style has a statistically significant, positive relationship to year-over-year sales and margin...|$|R
40|$|As a {{component}} of the regulatory structure controlling building construction and land development in Australia, the system of building regulation was reformed during a period of significant restructuring of the Australian economy. The microeconomic reforms aimed to find efficiencies in government and industry sectors, and with respect to the latter, facilitate the development of competitive trade structures across national and global markets. The research provides a critical narrative account of the development and outcomes of the microeconomic reform of building regulation between 1990 and 2003. The microeconomic reform process is examined {{in the context of the}} vastly differing approaches of two Australian states, Victoria and New South Wales, with respect to the national reform agenda which was initiated and led by the Commonwealth government in response to the increasing globalization of the national economy. An understanding of what happened and why and how the states differed with respect to the national reform agenda enabled the outcomes of the reforms to be examined for their impact upon government, industry and the community. The regulation of building construction is a constitutional responsibility of the state governments and has traditionally been controlled by local government. However, control is increasingly being centralized at the national level, in response to international pressures to adopt performance-based regulations, standards and governance systems that accord to neoliberal ideology. This has resulted in a reduction of state and local government involvement in certain building control functions with a commensurate increased role for the private sector; an increase in the complexity and quantity of regulatory instruments; a reduction in government accountability for the standard of building construction; the development of structures to facilitate competitive intranational and international trade in <b>construction-related</b> goods and <b>services</b> and a reduction in the quality and standard of buildings. The principal benefits of the reforms have accrued to industry and to government and the least benefits have accrued to the community/consumer...|$|R
40|$|The recent ―Great Recession‖ {{impacted}} {{all parts}} of the country and the economy. But, selected industries and regions were especially hard-hit, as is true in many recessions. In terms of regions, the western and mountain regions of the United States, the industrial Midwest and the state of Florida were impacted most. Among industries, the manufacturing industry was hard hit, as is typically the case during recession. For example, in the State of Nebraska, net jobs losses in the manufacturing industry accounted for 9, 400 (33 %) of the total 28, 300 net job loss between December 2007 and December 2009. But, one unusual aspect of the Great Recession was the collapse of the housing sector. This lead to substantial job losses in construction and in portions of the service sector closely tied to the housing market such as finance, real estate, legal service, architecture and engineering. We note that construction accounted for another 4, 200 (15 %) of the 28, 300 net job loss in Nebraska between December 2007 and December 2009. Given these patterns, the University of Nebraska-Lincoln Bureau of Business Research (BBR) conducted a special study for the Northern Plains and Rocky Mountain Consortium, which is composed of the Departments of Labor in the states of Iowa, Nebraska, South Dakota, Montana, Utah, and Wyoming. This study examines re-employment opportunities in green occupations for displaced workers in the construction, manufacturing, and <b>construction-related</b> <b>services</b> industries. The first part of the research examines the potential ―match‖ in theory between green occupations and the occupations of displaced manufacturing, construction, and construction-related service workers in each consortium state...|$|E
