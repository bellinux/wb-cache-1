40|$|It {{was used}} as {{material}} the component resolvable for 10 % NaOH derived from extraction in the mixed medium of methanol, aceton and benzene from the activated charcoal in which the component unresolvable for buthanol in acid medium after being extracted of native water of Tama river by methanol and the component of infiltrated fluid by glasswool filter of the drinking water of Tama river and the material was subcutaneously injected continuously 10 days in male rats in d. d. strain in their developing stage. By the above-mentioned procedures, marked degeneration in cartilage tissue in epiphysis of tibia were observed subsequent to degeneration in the striated ducts of parotid glands in accordance {{with a lot of}} reports. In the degenerated striated ducts of parotid glands, enzyme activities of Succinic-dehydrogenase and <b>Cytochrome-oxydase</b> are abnormally observed and staining affinity for acridineorange of nuclei is decreased, showing differently stained by double staining of alcianbluehematoxylin. The substance positive for alcianblue staining, supposed to be chondroitinsulphate, is decreased in cartilage cells. It was, moreover, observed decrease of acid phosphatase an irregularity of staining affinity of alkaline phosphatase. It is considered that the findings above-mentioned offer the important ground for determination of poisonous substance of Kaschin-Beck disease occured by a drinking water and for histochemical proof of earlier changes based upon disorders of internal secretion of salivary glands...|$|E
