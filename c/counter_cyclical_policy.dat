40|$|Includes bibliography. The Macroeconomics for {{development}} blue print for Latin America and the Caribbean is articulated around two issues: an active strategy of productive development and a <b>counter</b> <b>cyclical</b> <b>policy</b> stance. Macroeconomic counter cyclicality {{refers to the}} management of the level of aggregate demand to dampen the fluctuations and volatility of real and nominal variables around their long-term trends. This paper argues that cycle and trend are interdependent and that, as a result, counter cyclical policies (i. e., aggregate demand policies) are not neutral to the long-run behaviour of economies.

40|$|We {{examine the}} {{potential}} policy role of monetary aggregates {{by attempting to}} use them as effectively {{as possible in the}} analysis of empirical relationships. We consider three possible roles: as information variables, as indicators of policy actions and as instruments in a policy rule. These require successively stronger and more stable relationships between the aggregates and the final policy targets. Our results show that in the United States since 1979, the monetary aggregates fall considerably short of those requirements, and results with German M 3 are hardly more favorable. We also investigate whether empirical relationships are not reflective of causal relationships because of the use of these variables in <b>counter</b> <b>cyclical</b> <b>policy.</b> The results are reasonably consistent with that notion in the case of interest rates, but not {{in the case of the}} aggregates. ...|$|E

40|$|During {{the decade}} of the 1970 ’s the US economy {{unexpectedly}} suffered from “stagflation” namely, high unemployment, slowed economic growth and high rates of inflation. During the 1980 ’s the major macroeconomic problem became high interest rates and massive government deficits. Macroeconomists employed ad hoc supply shocks, rational expectations and natural rate of unemployment theories in an effort to account for these anomalous observed economic events. Our paper puts forth an alternative explanation of these events, namely that they were at least partially the result of the growth of the underground economy during this period. The macroeconomic model developed in the paper demonstrates that when monetary policy is committed to a full employment target, growth of the underground economy will give rise to a continuous stagflation which can only be abetted by the monetary authority shifting to a price stability target. Such a shift took place in October 1979 when the Federal Reserve adopted a price stability target and the fiscal authorities assumed the burden of <b>counter</b> <b>cyclical</b> <b>policy.</b> We show that in the presence of an unrecorded economy, such a policy shift will lead to high interest rates and increasing government deficits. In short, the paper demonstrates how the mere illusion of economic malaise can be translated into the reality of economic chaos.

40|$|Preliminary draft, {{please do}} not quote This paper investigates the {{reaction}} of fiscal policy to the business cycle, depending {{on the level of}} public debt within a panel of developed and emerging economies over the period 1990 - 2011. While we strengthen the well-established finding that fiscal <b>policy</b> is <b>counter</b> <b>cyclical</b> or neutral in developed and emerging economies, additional outcomes emerge from this study. First, we find a non-linear response of fiscal policy to the business cycle, conditional upon the outstanding debt stock. Interestingly, our results show that when the public debt-to-GDP ratio goes beyond our estimated threshold of 86 %, fiscal policy behaves rather pro cyclically. Our second step estimations give evidence to the effectiveness of FR in dampening the impact of public debt burden on the implementation of <b>counter</b> <b>cyclical</b> fiscal <b>policy.</b> This positive effect stems from the fiscal discipline induced by the adoption of rules.

40|$|During {{the first}} half of the 1930 ’s, the founders of the Chicago School of {{economics}} and John Maynard Keynes in England advocated public works and as a cure for unemployment and a way to overcome the Great Depression. <b>Counter</b> <b>cyclical</b> fiscal <b>policy</b> was seen as a feasible strategy to attenuate the phases of the economic cycle. The quantity theory of money coupled with the hypothesis of wage and price rigidity provided the theoretical underpinnings for this policy proposal. These economists argued that a monetary policy channeled through the banking system was ineffective. In particular, Chicago economists identified two key features that exemplified this restriction: the instability of the circulation velocity of money and the fragility and underdevelopment of the banking system and financial structure. Fiscal policy was thus advocated on the basis of market rigidities and the impotency of monetary policy. By the end of the decade both Chicago economists and Keynes had departed from this fiscal policy stance. The former became concerned with the inflationar...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we extend the neoclassical model {{presented}} by Baxter and King (1993) {{to evaluate the}} effects of two alternative fiscal policy rules on the business cycle. The rules we analyze {{are similar to those}} implemented in practice by some countries, such as: limits to the structural fiscal deficit (which eliminates the effects of the business cycle on the government revenues) and limits to conventional fiscal deficit. We focus our analysis in a model calibrated to mimic Peruvian data to evaluate the short run dynamics and the conditions for the stability of the equilibrium. We find that the rule based on the structural balance generates a <b>counter</b> <b>cyclical</b> fiscal <b>policy,</b> which reduces significantly output volatility. Moreover, we find that a condition for a determinate equilibrium in the model endowed with the structural rule is that non-financial government expenditures react more than one–to-one to changes in interest expenditures.

40|$|Empirical {{fiscal policy}} {{reaction}} functions based on ex post data cannot {{be said to}} describe fiscal policymakers intentions, since they utilise data which did not exist when their decisions were made. A characterisation of what fiscal policymakers {{were trying to do}} requires real time data. This paper compares fiscal policy reaction functions for 14 European countries over the period 1994 - 2006 using both types of data. We exploit the information contained in real-time and ex post data and develop a new approach to estimate the automatic and discretionary fiscal policy responses to changing economic conditions. This avoids the uncertainties and inaccuracies associated with filtering the data upfront in an attempt to estimate potential output or the structural budget. We find that the often commented upon pro-cyclicality of discretionary policy arises only with ex post data; the real time data suggests that policymakers are seeking to run <b>counter</b> <b>cyclical</b> discretionary <b>policy,</b> but find it hard to do so in practice due to data constraints. Compared to elsewhere in the literature, our model yields lower estimates of the automatic fiscal response and stronger estimates of the discretionary fiscal response to an output gap.

40|$|TResearch by J. D. Sachs and A. M. Warner, {{indicates}} that resource-rich countries are less successful {{in terms of}} economic growth than are resource-poor countries. The question of what measures Icelanders need to take to prevent their fishery wealth from limiting economic growth is posed. The main body of the essay discusses arguments for a fishing fee. The principal arguments for a fishing fee are listed. One type of argument concerns flexibility, with a view to possibly introducing other forms of management or altering the distribution of profit in the future. Another type of argument concerns equity and fairness, contending that having a fishing fee makes it easier to ensure that the entire nation enjoys the benefit of the resource. A third type of argument is connected to risk-management, maintaining that, if properly arranged, a fishing fee would make it possible to offer vessel operators an indirect insurance policy which otherwise would not be available to them. The fourth type of argument concerns counter-cyclical policy and the problem of co-habitation of the fishery industry and other export industries. and refers to the possibility of wage earners and/or taxpayers being forced (or tempted) to apply general policy instruments to secure a portion of the fishery rent. The general measures available to obtain a piece of the fishery rent share a common failing: their use unavoidably increases costs for other sectors of industry and thus limits possibilities for growth in those sectors and links their performance to fisheries performance. Then there are arguments for neutrality, {{based on the idea that}} so-called resource rent taxes should not affect the use of the factors of production.

40|$|As well as {{highlighting}} {{the importance of}} introducing <b>counter</b> <b>cyclical</b> capital buffers, this paper {{draws attention to the}} need for greater focus on “more forward looking provisions”, as well as provisions which are aimed at addressing losses and unforeseen problems attributed to “maturity transformation of short-term deposits into long term loans. ” Whilst the need for forward looking provisioning has been echoed by some authorities on the literature, the paper also adds weight to the argument through its attempt to link such an argument to the ever increasing prominence assumed by liquidity risks – since liquidity also contributes to pro cyclicality. “The complex response of financial institutions to deteriorating market conditions - which to a large extent, is attributed to liquidity shortfalls which reflected on and off balance sheet maturity mismatches and excessive levels of leverage, has resulted in an increasingly important role for liquidity provided by central banks in the funding of bank balance sheets. ” Owing to such increased importance of liquidity risks, this paper also attempts to highlight why the Basel Committee’s <b>Counter</b> <b>Cyclical</b> Buffer Proposal – a response to the recent financial crisis (which to a significant extent, focuses on banking sector capital requirements), should also take greater account of more forward looking provisions.

40|$|The Chilean {{economy is}} {{historically}} {{characterized by an}} important degree of volatility. Volatility is undesirable in an indexed economy that attempts do disinflate, making the smoothing of the business cycle an issue for economic policy. The article studies the effect of public expenditure stabilization {{and the use of}} taxes as an <b>counter</b> <b>cyclical</b> tool. This is done calibrating a basic macroeconomic model to Chilean reality. The results show that about 25 % of variability in growth rates could be eliminated in the model if cyclical fiscal impulses where avoided. This could be achieved with constant rates of growth for public consumption and investment, and through <b>counter</b> <b>cyclical</b> taxes. Finally, the article proposes the idea of establishing a stabilization mechanism for public expenditure through growth limits and state dependent flexibility rules. The establishment of a stabilization fund for tax revenues where <b>counter</b> <b>cyclical</b> responses by the fiscal sector could be accounted for and accumulated, is important for expenditure growth stabilization to be effective and credible. This measure could grant public expenditure independence from changes in tax collecting along the business cycle. Moreover, the possibility of flexibilizing the VAT is analyzed, assessing its effectiveness, its time consistency problems, and {{the costs and benefits of}} substituting it with some degree of flexibility on income taxes or on investment tax incentives. The article concludes that there exists a series of fiscal instruments that could be used in a <b>counter</b> <b>cyclical</b> way, like expenditure growth rules, stabilization funds and flexible tax systems. ...|$|R
40|$|Standard DSGE small {{open economy}} models can not {{generate}} the cyclical properties of middleincome countries (MICs). These models, {{compared to the}} data, predict excessive consumption smoothing, low procyclicality of investment and procyclical, instead of <b>counter</b> <b>cyclical,</b> real net exports. Previous studies have solved this problem by increasing the persistence of shocks or by lowering the intertemporal elasticity of substitution. This paper tackles it by introducing market imperfections relevant for MICs into an otherwise standard model. More specifically, we build a model with limited access to the foreign capital market, identified as an external borrowing constraint, and asymmetric financing opportunities across tradable and non-tradable sectors, identified as sector-specific labor financing wedges. The key parameters associated to these frictions are deduced to replicate selected data for Chile between 1986 and 2004. We find that the external borrowing constraint makes investment and consumption of tradable goods more procyclical and volatile, making real net exports <b>counter</b> <b>cyclical.</b> However, it produces <b>counter</b> <b>cyclical</b> employment and a low volatility of consumption of non tradable. Introducing sectorspecific labor financing wedges enables the model to reproduce these moments as well. ...|$|R

This paper takes a different approach. It explores whether adding two financial frictions to an otherwise standard small open economy model, an external borrowing constraint and labor financing wedges, can reconcile theory and data without appealing to changes in preferences, but rather to market imperfections widely studied in the literature for the emerging world. I find that adding the external borrowing constraint makes consumption and investment more procyclical and volatile, and reproduces the <b>counter</b> <b>cyclical</b> path of the current account.
