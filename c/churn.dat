40|$|Milk {{samples from}} three Jersey and three Holstein herds {{were used to}} {{determine}} if the degree of <b>churning</b> correlated with the initial milkfat assay, and also to determine if the <b>churned</b> milkfat could be measured as accurately as the initial milkfat using the Milko-Tester. Regression lines for the initial milkfat test versus <b>churned</b> milk- fat test fit polynomial curves. The degree of <b>churning</b> was greater for Jerseys than Holsteins and correlated with the initial milkfat test. The repeatability of initial milkfat tests vas 0. 98 for Jerseys and 0. 99 for Holsteins. However, the repeatability of <b>churned</b> milkfat tests was lower for both breeds, especially for Jerseys. This indicated that the <b>churned</b> sample could not be measured for its milkfat content as accurately as the nonchurned sample. <b>Churned</b> milkfat samples all tested lower than initial milkfat samples, thus the Milko-Tester Mark III was unable to provide an initial fat test estimate following sample <b>churning.</b> Cows were different from each other in the difference between initia 1 and <b>churned</b> milk fat tests. This suggested that cows which produce milk with a higher tendency for <b>churning</b> are apt to receive less reliable milkfat tests from central laboratories than other cows, when all milk samples are subjected to <b>churning</b> conditions...|$|R

The rope to hang the pot was {{wrapped around the}} edges of the side collar, it is believed that the rope was tied tightly to the pot, allowing the pot to spin in circles, due to the spinning motion, several theories have been made of the use of the pots. It is believed that the smaller hanging pots were used to ferment alcohol, by use of the seeds of touch-me-not balsam (Impatiens noli-tangere), and the larger hanging pots were used to <b>churn</b> butter and make cheese. They were cattle breeders, and as such required salt in order to preserve their meat, however, the Iazyges had no salt mines within their land.

5|$|After the {{groundbreaking}} opticals of Star Wars, The Motion Pictures producers realized the film required similarly high-quality visuals. Douglas Trumbull, a film director with an excellent reputation in Hollywood {{who had worked}} on , was the first choice for director of special effects, but declined the offer. When approached, Trumbull was busy on Close Encounters, and was tired of being ignored as a director and having to <b>churn</b> out special effects for someone else's production; after completing the effects work, Trumbull planned on launching his own feature using a new film process. The next choice, John Dykstra, was similarly wrapped up in other projects. Post-production supervisor Paul Rabwin suggested Robert Abel's production company Robert Abel and Associates might {{be up to the}} task. The scope and size of the effects grew after the television movie became The Motion Picture. Abel and Associates bid $4million for doing the film's effects and Paramount accepted. As new effects were added, Abel increased their bid by $750,000, and Roddenberry suggested that the effects costs and schedules be reexamined.|$|E

By contrast the Braves won the NL that {{year with a}} 92–62 record and advanced to the 1958 World Series where the New York Yankees defeated them in seven games. Despite their success the Braves made several changes leading into the 1959 season. First, they selected Jim Pisoni in the Rule 5 draft from the Yankees in December 1958, although {{he returned to the}} Yankees by May 1959. The Braves then traded with the Philadelphia Phillies for Ted Kazanski, Stan Lopata, and Johnny O'Brien just prior to the season. Finally, the Braves traded for Mickey Vernon from the Cleveland Indians and selected Bobby Ávila, Ray Boone, and Enos Slaughter off of waivers during the 1959 season.

25|$|Companies {{usually make}} a {{distinction}} between voluntary <b>churn</b> and involuntary <b>churn.</b> Voluntary <b>churn</b> occurs due to a decision by the customer to switch to another company or service provider, involuntary <b>churn</b> occurs due to circumstances such as a customer's relocation to a long-term care facility, death, or the relocation to a distant location. In most applications, involuntary reasons for <b>churn</b> are excluded from the analytical models. Analysts tend to concentrate on voluntary <b>churn,</b> because it typically occurs due to factors of the company-customer relationship which companies control, such as how billing interactions are handled or how after-sales help is provided.|$|E

25|$|<b>Churn</b> or Customer {{attrition}} {{is often}} used {{as an indicator of}} customer satisfaction. However the <b>churn</b> rate can be kept artificially low by making it difficult for the customers to resiliate their services. This can include ignoring resiliations requests, implementing lengthy and complicated resiliation procedures to follow through by an average consumer and various other barriers to resiliation. Thus, <b>churn</b> can improve while customer satisfaction deteriorates. This practice is short sighted and will backfire. However, it was shown to be common in telephone companies and among internet providers.|$|E

40|$|The {{phenomena}} of aggregation and disruption of fat globules in cream subjected to viscous flow were studied, and special care {{was taken to}} exclude air bubbles. In classical <b>churning</b> processes the incorporation of air was essential, but it was clearly shown that also {{in the absence of}} air rapid and efficient <b>churning</b> was possible. <b>Churning</b> was shown to be satisfactory at a fairly narrow range of shearing rates; higher and lower rates led to excessive <b>churning</b> times, or to abnormal butter formation and high fat content in the buttermilk. The experiments were performed in a cylindrical vessel in which a concentric solid cylinder could be rotated at different speeds. The influence of shear rate (cylinder velocity, annular clearance and cream viscosity), temperature, fat content, acidity and fat globule size were studied in relation to <b>churning</b> time and efficiency. Partly empirical equations were derived, describing the relations. A <b>churning</b> time of a few seconds and a fat content in the buttermilk below 1 % could easily be achieved...|$|R

40|$|Pressure and {{performance}} requirements of axial piston pumps {{and the proportion}} of <b>churning</b> losses in axial piston pumps increase significantly with increasing speed. To investigate the primary distribution of <b>churning</b> losses in axial piston pumps at various ranges of speed, a test rig was set up in which other friction losses can be eliminated, thus making it possible to investigate the net <b>churning</b> losses in an axial piston pump. The influence of the rotating cylinder block and pistons on <b>churning</b> losses is analyzed based on a qualitative evaluation of the various fluid flow regimes at different test speeds in an axial piston pump. The analytical results indicate that pistons have less influence on <b>churning</b> losses than the rotating cylinder block beyond the critical speed in axial piston pumps, because the total energy dissipation transforms laminar viscous friction losses into turbulent shear stress losses. It is concluded that more attention should be given to the effect of the rotating cylinder block on <b>churning</b> losses in axial piston pumps at high rotation speed...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the impact}} of <b>churning</b> in the imported varieties of capital and intermediate inputs on firm export scope and productivity. Using detailed data on imports and exports at the firm-product-market level, we document substantial <b>churning</b> in both imports and exports for Slovenian manufacturing firms in the period 1994 – 2008. On average, a firm changes about one-quarter of imported and exported product-markets every year, while gross <b>churning</b> in terms of added and dropped product-markets is almost three times higher. A substantial share of this product <b>churning</b> is due to simultaneous imports and exports of firms in identical varieties within the same CN- 8 product code (so called pass-on-trade). We find that <b>churning</b> in imported varieties {{is far more important}} than reduction in tariffs or declines in import prices for firms’ productivity growth and increased export product scope. We also find gross <b>churning</b> has a bigger impact on firm productivity improvements by a factor of more than 10 in comparison with net <b>churning.</b> Both adding and dropping of imported input varieties thus seem to be of utmost importance for firms aiming to optimise their input mix towards their most valuable inputs. These effects are further enhanced when excluding simultaneous trade in identical varieties, suggesting that pass-on-trade has less favourable effects on firms’ long-run performance than regular trade. status: publishe...|$|R

An econometric analysis is conducted using disaggregated data by firms for the industry sector in the Metropolitan Region of Sao Paulo. The results confirm the models main hipotesis.

One of the main objectives of modeling customer <b>churn</b> is to determine the causal factors, so that the company can try to prevent the attrition from happening in the future.

40|$|High youth {{unemployment}} rates {{may be a}} signal of difficult labor market entry for youth or may reflect high <b>churning.</b> The European and United States literature finds the latter conclusion while the Latin American literature suggests the former. This paper uses panel data to examine whether Latin American youth follow OECD patterns or are, indeed, unique. By decomposing transition matrices into propensity to move and rate of separation matrices and estimating duration matrices, the authors find that Latin American youth do follow the OECD trends: their high unemployment reflects high <b>churning</b> while their duration of unemployment {{is similar to that}} of non-youth. The paper also finds that young adults (age 19 - 24) have higher <b>churning</b> rates than youth; most <b>churning</b> occurs between informal wage employment, unemployment, and out-of-the labor force, even for non-poor youth; and unemployment probabilities are similar for men and women when the analysis control for greater <b>churning</b> by young men.
