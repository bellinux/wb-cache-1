Take {{the case of the}} spreading of heritage <b>capitalization</b> <b>processes.</b> Namely the conflictual or negotiated redefinition of economic, symbolic and relational values.

Overturning common sense, we might assert that nowadays it is quite rare to find something unsuitable to be capitalized: everything could be intended as patrimony, general wealth, public property, everybody’s heritage. It is practices that are being capitalized, before spaces; new heritages are invented; the balance between democratic and oligarchic wealth is being re-written. To ask why we persist so stubbornly in highlighting what has been stolen from us or what we feel we should inherit during this long crisis is almost naïve. This persistence is not only an educational or moralistic stimulus to justify overflowing capitalization. Nor is it only spreading conservatism with very ancient roots.|$|R

The present {{study investigated the}} role of self-esteem and agreeableness in <b>capitalization</b> <b>processes</b> in romantic relationships. Capitalization occurs when people share personal positive news with others, and it has well-established affective benefits.

Participants reported on the most recent positive event they had disclosed to their romantic partner, and their mood prior to and following disclosure. Relative to HSEs, LSEs reported disclosing less enthusiastically and openly, feeling greater concern about their partner’s potential response, enjoying the interaction less, and perceiving overall worse responding from their partners. Despite these less positive self-reported expectations for, and perceptions of, the interaction, LSEs’ self-reported mood improved following disclosure. Controlling for self-reported typical mood, LSEs’ self-reported positive mood after capitalization {{did not differ from}} HSEs’.

The {{subject in}} this article is theoretical, methodical and applied aspects of state {{management}} of banks’ capitalization in Ukraine, a consideration which allows the estimate efficiency of Ukrainian banks refinancing and recapitalization, as well as to enunciate practical recommendations concerning an increase of their capitalization level. The purpose is an analysis of government support measures for the domestic bank system; furthermore the search for additional sources of financing bank funds and the development of capitalization level increase in conditions of social and economic transformations. Methodology. In the research there are used general scientific methods of learning economic facts and the use of processes in their steady development and correlation: logic analysis, methods of scientific abstraction, induction, deduction, optimization, grouping and comparison, as well as graphic and tabular methods. Results. The questions of government control in the bank system in the period of the world financial crisis is researched on international level by the Financial Stability Council, Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, specialists of the World Bank and International Monetary Fund. As a result of relative novelty of these problems {{only a small number of}} researches is devoted to the use of government bank support instruments and therefore further development of this topic has practical value for improving the renewal mechanisms of financial stability and reliability of the bank system in Ukraine. After the analysis of the government control measures of the domestic bank capitalization, since 2009, and the effectiveness of budget resources segregation on refinancing and recapitalization of bank institutions in Ukraine (including crisis period), it was found out that these mechanisms, unfortunately, did not change much the situation on the bank market. Taking into account the unstable political situation in Ukraine and its military conflict with Russia, which has influenced the inflation growth, depreciation of the national currency and panic outflow of deposits, furthermore the forecast of an intensified bank crisis is used as confirmation to the problems with liquidity and bankruptcy of numerous groups of the domestic banks. Therefore advisable is working of a structural and logical scheme of banks’ capitalization level increase, which consists of a selection of four categories of banks after stress-testing the measures of obligatory <b>capitalization</b> or <b>processes</b> of amalgamation and merging: financially consistent and reliable; 2) problem; 3) insolvent; 4) bad (helpless) banks. Conclusions. Realization of problem banks’ recapitalization with participation of the government is one of the possible variants of initiatives in handling the economic crisis’ condi-tions. Nevertheless, problems with deposit-returns and debt-discharges are better to solve by refinancing and restricting their liabilities than by recapitalization. In authors’ opinion, more reasonable methods of banks’ additional capitalization-financing is attracting resources from privatization of state property and introduces new activation mechanisms of citizens savings used, particularly for converting deposits of artificial and physical bodies in hryvni and dollars into the preference shares of domestic banks...|$|R

40|$|The {{rapid change}} in {{technologies}} and markets (innovations) {{as well as}} government policies has induced firms and localities to take collective actions to enhance their capacity to adapt and respond to uncertainty (Lundvall, 1998). In this regard current approaches to economic development draw upon diverse theoretical fields and concepts {{but there is some}} agreement as to the importance of social capital (Coleman, 1988; Putnam, 1993; Sabel, 1993). Social capital refers to embeddedness of trust and strong civic relations in a locality that serves as a source of competitiveness through cooperation. The SME’s are, naturally, both creators and users of the social capital in a locality. It is observed that different regions perform different qualities in the creation and exploitation of social capital in Turkey. Thus, this study aims to analyze and identify the attitudes of the SME’s towards networking, trust and collaboration in Lakes District (Isparta and Burdur Provinces) in order to assess the social capital capacity and capability. Is there a certain level networking among SME’s? Do they trust each other in their local business environment? Do they trust other local actors such as business chambers and local authorities? Is there awareness about collaborative business development among SME’s? The findings of such questions will help policy makers to design effective strategies in order to improve the role of social capital in economic development process. This study depends on a survey conducted in 2005. 66 SME’s were chosen from KOSGEB’s regional data inventory which includes 250 SME’s for Lakes District. In this survey, 50 questions questionnaire was used. The data collected have been evaluated by SPSS and MINITAB. In order to explore the social capital attitudes and differences among the SME’s, discriminant analysis, t-test and ANOVA are used. The social capital was categorized into (i) supportive structure of local actors (ii) collaboration among SME’s (iii) trust at different levels. The initial findings are less supportive of a strong social capital among SME’s and between SME’s and local actors. It is expected that informal and social relations should have been much developed in less developed economies, mainly as a consequence of less <b>capitalization</b> of social <b>processes.</b> Ironically, strong social relations in developing countries are not enough to produce/reproduce social capital.

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} new way of decomposing net present values and net final values in {{periodic}} shares. Such a decomposition generates a new notion of residual income, radically different from the classical one available in the financial and accounting literature. While the standard residual income is formally computed as profit minus cost of capital times actual capital invested, the new paradigm introduces a fourth element: the capital invested in the so-called shadow project. Such a capital is the counterfactual capital that the investor would own if, at time 0, he invested his funds at the cost of capital, rather than in the project. Two important features are found: in primis, the new residual income is obtained as the sum of the standard residual incomes and the interest earned on past standard residual incomes; in secundis, the new paradigm is shown to be additive: the net final value of the project is computed as the sum of all periodic shares (residual incomes) with no <b>capitalization</b> <b>process</b> (abnormal earnings aggregation). A generalization is provided for a levered portfolio of projects, and a fourthfold decomposition is reached: (i) periodic decomposition, (ii) opportunity account decomposition, (iii) project decomposition, (iv) financing decomposition. ...|$|E
