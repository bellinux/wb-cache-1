40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} {{to determine the effects of}} red and green glasswort on the physicochemical and textural prop-erties of reduced-salt <b>cooked</b> <b>sausages.</b> The control was formulated with 1. 5 % NaCl; then, three reduced-salt treatments were prepared, with 0. 75 % NaCl (RS), 0. 75 % NaCl+ 1. 0 % red glasswort (RSR) and 0. 75 % NaCl+ 1. 0 % green glasswort (RSG), respectively. The addition of glasswort within the added amount of 1 % had no influence on the pH value of the reduced-salt <b>cooked</b> <b>sausages,</b> regardless of the glasswort type. In terms of color, RSG treatment conveyed a higher hue angle value than the RSR treatment (p 0. 05). Furthermore, the addition of glasswort, regardless of its type, resulted in decreased cooking loss, and increased emulsion stability. As a result, reduced-salt <b>cooked</b> <b>sausages</b> formulated with either red or green glasswort demonstrated similar textural properties to those of the control. In conclusion, the type of glasswort within an added amount of 1 % had no influence on the physicochemical and textural properties of reduced-salt <b>cooked</b> <b>sausages,</b> except for the color characteristics. In terms of color alteration by the addition of glasswort, the red glass-wort, which in comparison with the green glasswort could minimize the color changes of reduced-salt <b>cooked</b> <b>sausages,</b> might be an effective source for manufacturing meat products...|$|R

In shear tests, fat replacement resulted in the gradually decrease of the studied parameters, related to a less hard and easy to chew texture.
