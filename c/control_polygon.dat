Summary: “Curve subdivision {{is a technique}} for generating smooth curves from initial <b>control</b> <b>polygons</b> by repeated refinement. The most common subdivision schemes are based on linear refinement rules, which are applied separately to each coordinate of the control points, and the analysis of these schemes is well understood. Since the resulting limit curves are not sufficiently sensitive to the geometry of the <b>control</b> <b>polygons,</b> {{there is a need}} for geometric subdivision schemes. Such schemes take the geometry of the <b>control</b> <b>polygons</b> into account by using nonlinear refinement rules and are known to generate limit curves with less artefacts. Yet, only a few tools exist for their analysis, because the non-linear setting is more complicated. In this paper, we derive sufficient {{conditions for}} a convergent interpolatory planar subdivision scheme to produce tangent continuous limit curves. These conditions as well as the proofs are purely geometric and do not rely on any parameterization. ...|$|R

40|$|A {{new method}} of Geometrically Designed least squares (LS) splines with {{variable}} knots, named GeDS, is proposed. It {{is based on}} the property that the spline regression function, viewed as a parametric curve, has a <b>control</b> <b>polygon</b> and, due to the shape preserving and convex hull properties, it closely follows the shape of this <b>control</b> <b>polygon.</b> The latter has vertices whose x-coordinates are certain knot averages and whose y-coordinates are the regression coefficients. Thus, manipulation of the position of the <b>control</b> <b>polygon</b> may be interpreted as estimation of the spline curve knots and coefficients. These geometric ideas are implemented in the two stages of the GeDS estimation method. In stage A, a linear LS spline fit to the data is constructed, and viewed as the initial position of the <b>control</b> <b>polygon</b> of a higher order (n > 2) smooth spline curve. In stage B, the optimal set of knots of this higher order spline curve is found, so that its <b>control</b> <b>polygon</b> is as close to the initial polygon of stage A as possible and finally, the LS estimates of the regression coefficients of this curve are found. The GeDS method produces simultaneously linear, quadratic, cubic (and possibly higher order) spline fits with one and the same number of B-spline coefficients.
