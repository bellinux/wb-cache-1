40|$|With China join {{into the}} WTO for over 10 years, {{increasing}} number of foreign investors, including foreign invested <b>construction</b> <b>companies,</b> show their interests in the Chinese market. Due to the cultural differences between foreign and local companies, the foreign investors will face many challenges when entering into Chinese market. These challenges may lead to difficulties not only in establishing relationships with government, customers, and suppliers but also in managing local employees. Employees’ job satisfaction is proven {{to be an important}} predictor to organizational performance. With more and more Chinese people working in foreign invested <b>construction</b> <b>companies,</b> {{it is not clear whether}} they feel live up to their expectations. Limited literature is found about people’s job satisfaction in foreign invested <b>construction</b> <b>companies.</b> There is a research gap as the factors affecting Chinese employees’ job satisfaction in foreign invested <b>construction</b> <b>companies</b> are not examined. Based on literature review and exploration, 9 hypotheses are proposed for this research. The first hypothesis is to evaluate people’s overall job satisfaction in foreign invested <b>construction</b> <b>companies.</b> The remaining 8 hypotheses are used to investigate the specific factors affecting job satisfaction. A quantitative approach is adopted and a questionnaire survey is conducted for data collection. Data in both local and foreign invested <b>construction</b> <b>companies</b> are collected for comparison purpose. Afterwards, three experienced managers are interviewed to seek their opinions on the findings. Multiple regression analysis is applied for hypotheses testing. The data analysis results confirm the first hypothesis that employees working in foreign invested <b>construction</b> <b>companies</b> have a lower job satisfaction compared to employees working in local <b>construction</b> <b>companies.</b> The results also show that performance appraisal system, monthly income, feel of responsibility and career prospect are significant factors affecting people’s job satisfaction in foreign invested <b>construction</b> <b>companies.</b> This study portrays a whole picture of employees’ job satisfaction in foreign invested <b>construction</b> <b>companies</b> and several significant predictors are identified.

40|$|Purpose: The {{business}} environment {{is fraught with}} risks and crises. Yet, {{in spite of the}} uncertainties faced, many <b>construction</b> <b>companies</b> were not aware of business continuity management (BCM), nor have they implemented BCM within their organizations. The {{purpose of this study is}} to understand the reasons behind this observation. Design/methodology/approach: A questionnaire survey was conducted with large <b>construction</b> <b>companies</b> in China, Hong Kong and Singapore to identify the threats and crises faced by these organizations. The survey findings were aggregated with a view to understanding why BCM is not widely implemented in <b>construction</b> <b>companies.</b> Findings: The survey findings were mapped against the Institutional Compliance Framework to explain the behavior of <b>construction</b> <b>companies</b> pertaining to BCM implementation. The study suggests that rational choice theory, normative theory and cultural-cognitive theory provide useful pointers to understanding the decisions made and the actions that should be taken to encourage more <b>construction</b> <b>companies</b> to adopt, develop and implement BCM in their organizations. Originality/value: Through a three-country survey, the study presents the threats and crises that <b>construction</b> <b>companies</b> have identified in China, Hong Kong, and Singapore. More significantly, the study provides, for the first time, a theoretical underpinning to explain how <b>construction</b> <b>companies</b> may receive BCM and the measures that decision makers can take to encourage these organizations to pay more attention strategically to BCM in their operations. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
