40|$|This study {{focuses on}} the {{microstructure}} and texture evolution of a Ti- 5 Al- 5 Mo- 5 V- 3 Cr alloy during cold rolling and annealing treatments. Three samples with different initial microstructures were <b>cold</b> <b>rolled</b> to a 40 % reduction in thickness. The starting microstructure of one sample was single β phase while two other specimens were α+β phases with different α particle sizes, distributed in β grains. For all three samples, the average size of primary β grains was 150 µm. The <b>cold</b> <b>rolled</b> specimens were then annealed at 860 °C (10 °C above the β transus temperature) for 5 minutes followed by water quenching. Microstructure development during cold rolling and recrystallization was studied by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) technique. Microstructure investigations showed that massive amount of shear bands occurred during the cold rolling of the single β phase sample while only a few shear bands were observed in the α+β <b>cold</b> <b>rolled</b> microstructures. The <b>cold</b> <b>rolled</b> texture of the sample comprised of a single β phase contains a gamma fibre (//ND) and a partial alpha fibre (//RD).

40|$|<b>Cold</b> <b>roll</b> forming is an {{extremely}} important but little studied sheet metal forming process. In this thesis, the process of <b>cold</b> <b>roll</b> forming is introduced and it is seen that form roll design {{is central to the}} <b>cold</b> <b>roll</b> forming process. The conventional design and manufacture of form rolls is discussed and it is observed that surrounding the design process are a number of activities which although peripheral are time consuming and a possible source of error. A CAD/CAM system is described which alleviates many of the problems traditional to form roll design. New techniques for the calculation of strip length and controlling the means of forming bends are detailed. The CAD/CAM system's advantages and limitations are discussed and, whilst the system has numerous significant advantages, its principal limitation can be said to be the need to manufacture form rolls and test them on a mill before a design can be stated satisfactory. A survey of the previous theoretical and experimental analysis of <b>cold</b> <b>roll</b> forming is presented and is found to be limited. By considering the previous work, a method of numerical analysis of the <b>cold</b> <b>roll</b> forming process is proposed based on a minimum energy approach. Parallel to the numerical analysis, a comprehensive range of software has been developed to enhance the designer's visualisation of the effects of his form roll design. A complementary approach to the analysis of form roll design is the generation of form roll design, a method for the partial generation of designs is described. It is suggested that the two approaches should continue in parallel and that the limitation of each approach is knowledge of the <b>cold</b> <b>roll</b> forming process. Hence, an initial experimental investigation of the rolling of channel sections is described. Finally, areas of potential future work are discussed...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, a Mo-Nb microalloyed TRIP Steel was {{subjected}} to several heat treatments designed to generate different microstructures. These microstructures were then <b>cold</b> <b>rolled</b> and TRIP-annealed, and the resulting tensile properties and retained austenite characteristics were determined. The results reveal that prior heat treatment has {{a significant effect on}} the <b>cold</b> <b>rolled</b> and annealed behavior. Generally, an increasing volume fraction of proeutectoid ferrite prior to cold rolling and TRIP annealing leads to improved tensile ductility. This is due to increased work-hardening rates, which, in turn, correlate to increased carbon enrichment in the retained austenite. These results can clearly be used to optimize the hot rolling process to produce hot strip for the subsequent production of <b>cold</b> <b>rolled</b> Mo-Nb TRIP Steel. (author abst.)
