Both human Jurkat T cells and Caco- 2 cells were incubated with increasing concentrations of the test compounds (0. 5 – 10 % v/v) for 24 h. Cell viability was assessed using the MTT, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release and Trypan Blue assays.

40|$|Immunomodulating {{proteins}} and peptides are formed during the hydrolysis of cow's milk proteins. These proteins are potential ingredients in functional foods {{used for the}} management of a range of immune related problems, both in infants and adults. However, the mechanism behind these effects is unknown. We hypothesize that the interaction of peptides with Toll-like receptors (TLRs) can induce immune effects, since these receptors are known to sample many dietary molecules in the intestine in order to regulate immune effects. To investigate this, we compared the immune effects and TLR activation and inhibition by whey and <b>casein</b> <b>hydrolysates</b> with different hydrolysis levels. We first measured cytokine production in primary peripheral blood mononuclear cells stimulated with either whey, <b>casein,</b> or their <b>hydrolysates.</b> IL- 10 and TNF alpha were induced by whey hydrolysates (decreasing with increasing hydrolysis level), but not by <b>casein</b> <b>hydrolysates.</b> Next, the activation of TLR 2, 3, 5 and 9 receptors were observed by intact and mildly hydrolysed whey proteins only and not by <b>casein</b> <b>hydrolysates</b> in TLR reporter cell lines. Many <b>casein</b> <b>hydrolysates</b> inhibited TLR signaling (mainly TLR 5 and 9). These results demonstrate that the effects of cow's milk proteins on the immune system are protein type and hydrolysis dependent.

40|$|Aim: Sheep milk-born {{bioactive}} peptides {{have been}} found to exhibit various physiological activities. The present work was designed with the aim to evaluate the effect of boiling on antidiabetic property of peptides derived from sheep milk caseinate on hydrolysis with three different proteases. Materials and Methods: In this investigation, casein prepared from raw and boiled sheep milk was hydrolyzed by three commercially available proteases (trypsin, pepsin, and chymotrypsin). These hydrolysates collected at different hydrolysis times (60, 120, 160, and 240 min) were assayed for their antidiabetic activity. Results: Among the three different enzyme <b>hydrolysates,</b> <b>casein</b> treated with chymotrypsin shows the highest antidiabetic activity among other enzymes. While the antidiabetic effect of raw milk-derived <b>casein</b> <b>hydrolysates</b> always exceeds than effect shown by boiled milk <b>casein</b> <b>hydrolysates.</b> Conclusion: The result obtained hence shows that the effect of boiling on the properties of bioactive peptides released during different enzyme digestion depends largely on the enzymatic formulation used and treatment conditions. Chymotrypsin treatment of raw casein yields peptides with maximum antidiabetic activity as compared to pepsin and trypsin. Moreover, the peptides produced after enzymatic treatment of boiled casein show reduced antidiabetic properties. Therefore, enzymatically treated raw milk <b>casein</b> <b>hydrolysates</b> may be used as effective nutritional supplements for diabetic patients, as it causes a significant inhibition of α-amylase activity...|$|R

Casein was hydrolyzed by alcalase to a degree of hydrolysis of 12. 4 %. The prepared hydrolysates exhibited in vitro inhibition on Angiotensin-I-converting Enzyme (ACE) and scavenging activity on DPPH radical. The prepared hydrolysates were then modified by alcalase-catalyzed plastein reaction in the presence of one of three extrinsic amino acids (leucine, valine or phenylalanine). At fixed 35 % (w/w) substrate concentration and 6 h reaction time, other conditions were optimized as 0. 6 mol/mol amino acid addition, 3 kU g - 1 peptides alcalase addition and 30 C reaction temperature.

40|$|Abstract – The aim of {{this study}} was to prepare papain-catalyzed casein plasteins and to {{demonstrate}} the influence of the plastein reaction on the radical scavenging activity. Casein was initially hydrolyzed with papain under selected conditions to give a degree of hydrolysis of 9. 6 %. The <b>casein</b> <b>hydrolysates</b> were then subjected to papain-catalyzed plastein reaction to prepare casein plasteins. The formation of plasteins in the prepared casein plasteins was confirmed by size exclusion chromatography. The optimal conditions for the plastein reaction, determined by response surface methodology using the decrease of free amino groups in the casein plasteins as the response variable, were as follows: papain addition level was fixed at 500 U·g− 1 proteins, reaction temperature 30 °C, concentration of <b>casein</b> <b>hydrolysates</b> 50 % and reaction time 5. 6 h. Six different casein plasteins were prepared and the radical scavenging activity on two radicals, 2, 2 -diphenyl- 1 -picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and 2, 2 ′-azino-bis(3 -ethyl-benzothiazoline- 6 -sulfonic acid) (ABTS), was evaluated by the Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC).

Further in vivo analysis of the anti-inflammatory properties of the 1 kDaR is proposed...|$|R
40|$|Hydrolytic {{parameters}} {{were tested}} to prepare <b>casein</b> <b>hydrolysates</b> with high oligopeptide content for dietetic purpose, using papain. Employing {{a temperature of}} 37 °C and an E:S ratio of 2 % was the most economical condition for large-scale manufacture. The encapsulation in liposomes was used for masking the bitterness, and was also able to reduce the hydrophobicity {{as well as to}} keep the chemical stability during 60 days of storage. The UV spectrometry with second derivative transformation was used to measure the encapsulation rate, which changed from 56 % to 62 %. The size distribution of vesicles was in the range of 500 to 1000 nm...|$|R
40|$|In this study, {{the various}} {{concentrations}} of <b>casein</b> <b>hydrolysate</b> (25, 50, 75, 100 mg/L) and L-phenylalanine (50, 100, 150, 200 µM/l) were incorporated in MS containing 15 µM BA plus 5 µM 2, 4 -D for enhancement of secondary metabolites in cell culture of Spilanthes acmella. The presence of <b>casein</b> <b>hydrolysate</b> in the nutrient medium improved {{the growth of}} cell biomass {{and the production of}} scopoletin. The addition of <b>casein</b> <b>hydrolysate</b> up to 75 mg/L stimulated the accumulation of scopoletin, but increasing excess 75 mg/L the level of <b>casein</b> <b>hydrolysate</b> reduced the production of scopoletin. The addition of L-phenylalanine in the nutrient medium was found to be more effective for production of secondary metabolite in S. acmella. The addition of 50 µM/L of L-phenylalanine in the medium increased scopoletin content to 27. 12 ± 0. 58 µg/g dry weight, compared to the scopoletin content of control at 7. 89 ± 0. 61 µg/g dry weight. The highest accumulation of scopoletin was observed in the 100 µM/L L-phenylalanine in cell suspension, which was 4. 51 times more than the control. As a result, using moderate concentration of L-phenylalanine was ideal for the production of scopoletin. In general, <b>casein</b> <b>hydrolysate</b> was more effective than L-phenylalanine for production of scopoletin and growth of cell biomass in the cell culture of S. acmella...|$|E

40|$|Background It remains {{controversial}} whether {{avoidance of}} dietary diabetogenic triggers, such as cow's milk proteins, can prevent {{type 1 diabetes}} in genetically susceptible individuals. Here, different extensive <b>casein</b> <b>hydrolysates</b> (HC) and single amino acid (AA) formulations were tested for their effect on mechanisms underlying autoimmune diabetes pathogenesis in diabetes-prone BioBreeding rats. Intestinal integrity, gut microbiota composition and mucosal immune reactivity were studies to assess whether these formulations have differential effects in autoimmune diabetes prevention. Methods Diabetes-prone BioBreeding rats received diets in which the protein fraction was exchanged for the different hydrolysates or AA compositions, starting from weaning {{until the end of}} the experiment (d 150). Diabetes development was monitored, and faecal and ileal samples were collected. Gut microbiota composition and cytokine/tight junction mRNA expression were measured by quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Cytokine levels of ileum explant cultures were measured by ELISA, and intestinal permeability was measured in vivo by lactulose-mannitol assay. Results Both HC-diet fed groups revealed remarkable reduction of diabetes incidence with the most pronounced effect in Nutramigen (R) -fed animals. Interestingly, AA-fed rats only showed delayed autoimmune diabetes development. Furthermore, both HC-fed groups had improved intestinal barrier function when compared with control chow or AA-fed animals. Interestingly, higher IL- 10 levels were measured in ileum tissue explants from Nutramigen (R) -fed rats. Beneficial gut microbiota changes (increased Lactobacilli and reduced Bacteroides spp. levels) were found associated especially with HC-diet interventions. Conclusions <b>Casein</b> <b>hydrolysates</b> were found superior to AA-mix in autoimmune diabetes prevention. This suggests the presence of specific peptides that beneficially affect mechanisms that may play a critical role in autoimmune diabetes pathogenesis. Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd...|$|R
50|$|Galactosemic infants present {{clinical}} symptoms {{just days}} after the onset of a galactose diet. They include difficulty feeding, diarrhea, lethargy, hypotonia, jaundice, cataract, and hepatomegaly (enlarged liver). If not treated immediately, and many times even with treatment, severe mental retardation, verbal dyspraxia (difficulty), motor abnormalities, and reproductive complications may ensue. The most effective treatment for many of the initial symptoms is complete removal of galactose from the diet. Breast milk and cow's milk should be replaced with soy alternatives. Infant formula based on <b>casein</b> <b>hydrolysates</b> and dextrin maltose as a carbohydrate source can also be used for initial management, but are still high in galactose. The reason for long-term complications despite a discontinuation of the galactose diet is vaguely understood. However, {{it has been suggested that}} endogenous (internal) production of galactose may be the cause.|$|R
40|$|O efeito da adição de NaCl sobre algumas propriedades funcionais da caseína e de seus hidrolisados trípticos, foi estudado em dois valores de pH (4, 0 e 5, 0). Para tal, foi adicionado um teor de 0, 02 M do sal às soluções-tampão empregadas no preparo das amostras. Foram determinadas a solubilidade protéica, a capacidade emulsificante (EC), o índice de atividade emulsificante (EAI) e a estabilidade das emulsões (ES), e o raio médio dos glóbulos de gordura (R) foi calculado. Os resultados obtidos indicaram que, nos dois valores de pH estudados, a adição de NaCl levou a um aumento significativo da solubilidade e da EC da caseína e de todos os hidrolisados trípticos. Por outro lado, diminuiu os valores de EAI da caseína e elevou os dos hidrolisados, tendo sido observado o oposto para o tamanho dos glóbulos de gordura. Com relação à ES, a da caseína apresentou ligeiro aumento no pH 5, 0, enquanto que apenas alguns hidrolisados trípticos tiveram a sua ES elevada em pH 4, 0 ou 5, 0. The {{effect of}} the NaCl {{addition}} on the emulsifying properties of casein and tryptic <b>casein</b> <b>hydrolysates</b> was studied in two pH values (4, 0 e 5, 0). A 0. 02 M concentration of salt {{was added to the}} buffer solutions used for preparing the samples. The protein solubility, the emulsifying capacity (EC), the emulsifying activity index (EAI) and the emulsion stability (ES) were determined. The mean radius (R) of fat droplets was also calculated. The results showed that the addition of NaCl increased the solubility and the EC of <b>casein</b> and <b>casein</b> <b>hydrolysates,</b> in both pH values. However, this salt addition reduced the EAI of casein and increased that of the hydrolysates. The opposite was observed relating to the R of fat droplets. Regarding the ES, that of casein presented little increase in pH 5. 0, and the same result was obtained for only some hydrolysates in pH 5. 0 or 4. 0...|$|R
