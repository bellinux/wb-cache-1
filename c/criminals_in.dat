5|$|In 1992, Raël {{appeared}} on Ciel mon Mardi, a French talk show hosted by journalist Christophe Dechavanne. Toward {{the end of}} the show, Raël's liberal views on sex were critiqued by a priest, a social worker, and a psychologist. A former Raëlian named Jean Parraga believed that his wife and children were being held as prisoners and that Raël attempted to break up his family. He thought they were being treated like <b>criminals</b> <b>in</b> activities such as orgies and sacrifice involving children at the Sensual Meditation camp. Parraga also had a criminal record as a drug dealer and car thief, and in August 1992, he attempted to shoot Raël.|$|E

5|$|By {{the middle}} of the 18th century, law {{enforcement}} in the counties of Croatia included county pandurs or hussars who patrolled roads and pursued <b>criminals.</b> <b>In</b> 1740, the term was applied to frontier guard duty infantry deployed in the Croatian Military Frontier (Banal Frontier), specifically its Karlovac and Varaždin Generalcies. The role of the pandurs as security guards was extended to Dalmatia after the establishment of Austrian rule there in the early 19th century. The term has dropped from official use for law enforcement officials, but it is still used colloquially in Croatia and the Western Balkans in a manner akin to the English word cop. The unit raised and led by Trenck is also referred to more specifically as Trenck's Pandurs, and less frequently in Croatia than elsewhere, as Croatian Pandurs.|$|E
5|$|Gamma, {{the team}} leader and main {{combatant}} of Zombiepowder.s cast, is a 22-year-old powder hunter who desires the zombie powder {{for the sake}} of immortality, and has already obtained one Ring of the Dead at his introduction in the first chapter. Due to numerous past violent crimes, Gamma {{is one of the most}} wanted <b>criminals</b> <b>in</b> the Zombiepowder. universe, with a bounty to match. This high bounty was one of the first things determined about Gamma's character by Tite Kubo, dating back to a pre-draft rendition of the character who was a sort of samurai. Gamma's personal history is never expounded upon, but it is implied by Balmunk that he was once a mercenary, but reformed and became a powder hunter following the death of a woman.|$|E
5|$|The Superintendent of Waterways and Parks (Shuiheng duwei 水衡都尉) {{was also}} known as the Chief Commandant of Waterways and Parks, and was once a {{subordinate}} of the Minister Steward until 115 BC, when he, and other former subordinates of that ministry, became independent officers. His salary-rank was equivalent to 2000–dan. The Superintendent of Waterways and Parks managed a large imperial hunting park located outside Chang'an, including its palaces, rest stops, granaries, and cultivated patches of fruit and vegetable gardens, which, along with game meat, provided food for the emperor's household. He also collected taxes from commoners using the park's grounds and transmitted these funds to the Minister Steward, who managed the emperor's finances. One of the Superintendent's subordinates supervised convicted <b>criminals</b> <b>in</b> their care of the park's hunting dogs.|$|E

5|$|The {{applications}} from Tone intrigued the Directory, which understood that by attacking Ireland {{they would be}} striking at the least defensible part of the British Isles. Support for the British government was weakest there and the United Irishmen optimistically claimed {{to be able to}} raise an irregular army of as many as 250,000 waiting to join the French once they had landed, with the additional attraction that a successful establishment of an Irish Republic would prove an ideological coup for the French Republic. Finally and most significantly, a large expeditionary force in Ireland could provide an ideal springboard for an invasion of Britain, especially in combination with a plan then under development to land 2,000 uniformed <b>criminals</b> <b>in</b> Cornwall, who would distract the British Army during the invasion of Ireland and could potentially provide a beachhead for future operations.|$|E
5|$|The {{characters}} {{can travel}} between {{a variety of}} locations in the game using their black and white 1960 DeSoto Adventurer, which, when selected, will present the player {{with a list of}} available destinations. The DeSoto is also used for several driving sequences, usually involving pursuing or fleeing <b>criminals</b> <b>in</b> other vehicles. In these driving sequences, the player can use Sam's gun, the car's horn, or have Max attempt to communicate with other vehicles via a megaphone. In addition, special inventory items may be used to complete specific puzzles within these sequences. Driving sequences are also used for several minigames, such as pulling innocent drivers over for fabricated felonies. In keeping with the developer's heritage from the LucasArts adventure games, Sam & Max Save the World is designed so that the player characters cannot die or reach a complete dead-end.|$|E
5|$|Varma chose Raghuvaran to {{play the}} local crime boss, Bhavani. Varma wanted him to underplay the character, {{which was based on}} real life.

Varma wanted to name the characters played by Nagarjuna and Raghuvaran as Bhavani and Siva respectively. At Nagarjuna's request, he reversed the names. Varma chose newcomers Chakravarthy, Jithendra, and Ramjagan to play J. D., Chinna, and Naresh after auditioning them at Annapurna Studios. Uttej, one of Varma's assistant directors, played a comic role of a server in the college canteen. He recommended Varma to cast Sushma for Keerthi's role.|$|E

5|$|Hess {{continued}} {{to be interested in}} aviation, learning to fly the more advanced aircraft that were coming into development at the start of World War II. On 10 May 1941 he undertook a solo flight to Scotland, where he hoped to arrange peace talks with the Duke of Hamilton, whom he believed to be prominent in opposition to the British government. Hess was immediately arrested on his arrival and was held in British custody {{until the end of the}} war, when he was returned to Germany to stand trial in the Nuremberg Trials of major war <b>criminals</b> <b>in</b> 1946. During much of the trial, he claimed to be suffering from amnesia, but later admitted this was a ruse. Hess was convicted of crimes against peace and conspiracy with other German leaders to commit crimes and was transferred to Spandau Prison in 1947, where he served a life sentence. Repeated attempts by family members and prominent politicians to win him early release were blocked by the Soviet Union. Still in custody in Spandau, he died by suicide in 1987 at the age of 93. After his death the prison was demolished to prevent it from becoming a neo-Nazi shrine.|$|E
5|$|In 1754, {{representatives of}} seven British North American colonies {{met in the}} Stadt Huys, Albany's city hall, for the Albany Congress; Benjamin Franklin of Pennsylvania {{presented}} the Albany Plan of Union there, {{which was the first}} formal proposal to unite the colonies. Although it was never adopted by Parliament, it was an important precursor to the United States Constitution. The same year, the French and Indian War, the fourth in a series of wars dating back to 1689, began; it ended in 1763 with French defeat, resolving a situation that had been a constant threat to Albany and held back its growth. In 1775, with the colonies {{in the midst of the}} Revolutionary War, the Stadt Huys became home to the Albany Committee of Correspondence (the political arm of the local revolutionary movement), which took over operation of Albany's government and eventually expanded its power to control all of Albany County. Tories and prisoners of war were often jailed in the Stadt Huys alongside common <b>criminals.</b> <b>In</b> 1776, Albany native Philip Livingston signed the Declaration of Independence at Independence Hall in Philadelphia.|$|E
