5|$|A. Newton {{requested}} further specimens, especially males, but in 1875 {{he finally}} published {{a plate of}} the female, lamenting that no male specimens could be found. Tafforet's 1726 account had been rediscovered the previous year, and A. Newton noted that it confirmed his assumption that the male would turn out be much more colourful than the female. Newton's collector, Henry H. Slater, had seen a live Newton's parakeet the year before, but was not <b>carrying</b> <b>a</b> <b>gun</b> at the time. On 14 August 1875, William Vandorous shot a male specimen. It {{may have been the}} same specimen Slater had observed. It was subsequently sent to E. Newton by William J. Caldwell. This is the paratype of the species, numbered UMZC 18/Psi/67/h/2 and housed in the Cambridge Museum.|$|E
5|$|Castro became {{critical}} of the corruption and violence of Grau's regime, delivering a public speech on the subject in November 1946 that earned him {{a place on the}} front page of several newspapers. In contact with members of student leftist groups – including the Popular Socialist Party (Partido Socialista Popular – PSP), the Socialist Revolutionary Movement (Movimiento Socialista Revolucionaria – MSR) and the Insurrectional Revolutionary Union (Unión Insurrecional Revolucionaria – UIR) – he grew close to the UIR, although biographers are unsure whether he became a member. In 1947, Castro joined a new socialist group, the Party of the Cuban People (Partido Ortodoxo), founded by veteran politician Eduardo Chibás (1907–1951). A charismatic figure, Chibás advocated social justice, honest government, and political freedom, while his party exposed corruption and demanded reform. Though Chibás lost the election, Castro remained committed to working on his behalf. Student violence escalated after Grau employed gang leaders as police officers, and Castro soon received a death threat urging him to leave the university; he refused and began <b>carrying</b> <b>a</b> <b>gun</b> and surrounding himself with armed friends. In later years Castro was accused of attempting gang-related assassinations during this period, including that of UIR member Lionel Gómez, MSR leader Manolo Castro and university policeman Oscar Fernandez, but these charges remain unproven.|$|E
5|$|As {{de facto}} racial {{segregation}} increased, so did tensions between {{residents of the}} northeast {{and members of the}} predominantly white male Teaneck Police Department. On the evening of April 10, 1990, the Teaneck Police Department responded to a call from a resident complaining about a teenager with a gun. After an initial confrontation near Bryant School and a subsequent chase, Phillip Pannell, an African American teenager, was shot and killed by Gary Spath, a white Teaneck police officer. Spath said he thought Pannell had a gun and was turning to shoot him. Witnesses said Pannell was unarmed and {{had been shot in the}} back. Protest marches, some violent, ensued; most African Americans believed that Pannell had been killed in cold blood, while other residents insisted that Spath had been justified in his actions. Testimony at the trial claimed that Pannell was shot in the back, and that he was <b>carrying</b> <b>a</b> <b>gun.</b> A police officer testified to finding a modified starter's pistol with eight cartridges in Pannell's jacket pocket. Spath was ultimately acquitted on charges of reckless manslaughter in the shooting. Some months after Spath had been cleared, he decided to retire from law enforcement. The incident was an international news event that brought Reverend Al Sharpton and Jesse Jackson to the community and inspired the 1995 book Color Lines: The Troubled Dreams of Racial Harmony in an American Town, by Mike Kelly.|$|E

25|$|In this {{tradition}} the expensive medium of oil-on-canvas itself, {{and the lack}} of farm-workers in the image are cited as further evidence, and Mrs Andrews' somewhat stiff seated position is said to express her inferior and passive status, as she is placed on display like other assets of her husband. Harsh things are said about the appearance and facial expressions of the two sitters, their dress and poses, and Mr Andrews <b>carrying</b> <b>a</b> <b>gun.</b> To some authors in {{this tradition}}, Gainsborough's intention in making the portrait was in part satirical, something most art historians are unlikely to agree with.|$|E

Douglas Horner was wounded by pieces of the windscreen. The car proceeded ahead where White and Wanders tried to get in, but Horner did not realise the situation and drove on. When they saw that White had been shot, they came back and picked them up. Both parties then continued down to a local establishment called the Fox and Hound, where they called police.|$|E

25|$|The {{character}} was eventually to bow out on 23 February 1989 {{in one of}} the programme's most famous episodes which attracted more than 20 million viewers. After escaping from custody, Den returned to the famous canal (in Alperton) for one last rendezvous with Michelle. The episode ended with Den being shot {{by a member of the}} firm (who was <b>carrying</b> <b>a</b> <b>gun</b> concealed in a bunch of daffodils) and then falling into the canal. The scene where Den actually hit the water had to be taped at the BBC's Ealing Film Studios using a water tank, because the waters of the Grand Union Canal were deemed unsafe. When the episode was finished, however, Jonathan Powell, controller of BBC1, requested that the final shot be removed to allow for the possibility of Den returning at a later date. In protest, Tony Holland and Julia Smith had their names taken off the episode's credits. Den's exit ended up being the creators' final contribution to the show.|$|E
25|$|McLain was {{suspended}} indefinitely by baseball commissioner Bowie Kuhn; the suspension was then {{set for the}} first three months of the 1970 season. He returned in mid-season, but struggled to pitch well. McLain then received a seven-day suspension (from the Detroit club) in September for dousing sportswriters Jim Hawkins of the Detroit Free Press and Watson Spoelstra of the Detroit News with buckets of water. Just as the seven-day suspension was about to end, he received another suspension from Kuhn, this time for <b>carrying</b> <b>a</b> <b>gun</b> on a team flight; the punishment would last for at least the rest of the season. McLain's 1970 season ended with a won-loss record of only 3–5. Later that year, he was forced into bankruptcy despite being the first $100,000 player in Tigers history. Meanwhile, McLain and his friend Jim Northrup co-schemed to make more money; they were back in Detroit furthering a plan that they shared to generate a nude baseball model calendar. These efforts eventually fell short.|$|E

500|$|Holders of {{different}} categories of firearms licenses have different possibility of carrying their firearms. In general, it is prohibited to carry firearms to court buildings (they may be left for safe {{keeping with the}} judicial guard upon entry before passing through metal detector), at demonstrations or mass meetings. It is also generally considered irresponsible to take guns to clubs or bars {{even though it is}} not explicitly prohibited by law. <b>Carrying</b> <b>a</b> <b>gun</b> while intoxicated is, however, illegal and can lead to heavy fines and losing the gun license, with police frequently conducting intoxication tests of open-carrying hunters. Carrying guns in schools and campuses is not prohibited by law and there are no so called [...] "gun-free zones".|$|E

500|$|The {{complications}} {{regarding the}} illegal firearms used in Timoshenko's murder inspired new laws passed in New York City, which authorized new penalties, touted as [...] "part {{of the toughest}} illegal gun possession law in the country." [...] A public awareness campaign, named [...] "GUNS=PRISON", featured posters {{calling attention to the}} 3 ½year prison sentence given to anyone caught carrying an illegal loaded handgun in New York. [...] At a press conference, Mayor Bloomberg stated, [...] "Police Officer Russell Timoshenko was just the latest victim killed by a gunman firing at close range. [...] If the prospect of {{three and a half years}} in jail deters just one would-be killer from <b>carrying</b> <b>a</b> <b>gun</b> and taking the life of another police officer in another deadly confrontation, then the law and the efforts to publicize it are well worth it." [...] NFL player Plaxico Burress was charged with this new law due to an incident that occurred inside of a New York City nightclub. On August 20, 2009, Burress plead guilty to a gun possession charge and agreed to a two-year prison sentence.|$|E

Neighbours described him as [...] "friendly and big-hearted", but stated that in the months before he left the town, his behaviour had become paranoid, and unpredictable. Believing that someone would break into his home, Gonzalez started <b>carrying</b> <b>a</b> <b>gun</b> when walking his dogs, and installed extra security at his house, also choosing to leave his Christmas lights up as they [...] illuminated his property. He told a neighbour that children made him nervous, because he had seen children with bombs strapped to them during the war. When a friend asked him why he had not been answering his cell phone, Gonzales explained that he had placed it in the microwave; he thought the government was trying to bug his house. He lived without electricity in the weeks before he left the town to move to a campground. In February 2013, Gonzalez called the police to report a burglary. When police arrived at his house they found him patrolling his front yard with an assault rifle, handgun and a knife. Gonzalez told police there were cameras and listening devices in his house that were secretly recording him.|$|E
