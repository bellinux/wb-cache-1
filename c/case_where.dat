5|$|From {{the point}} of view of sheaf cohomology, the Mayer–Vietoris {{sequence}} is related to Čech cohomology. Specifically, it arises from the degeneration of the spectral sequence that relates Čech cohomology to sheaf cohomology (sometimes called the Mayer–Vietoris spectral sequence) in the <b>case</b> <b>where</b> the open cover used to compute the Čech cohomology consists of two open sets. This spectral sequence exists in arbitrary topoi.|$|E
5|$|In Fig. 1, a body {{is moving}} along a {{specific}} curve MN acted on by a (centripetal) force, towards the fixed point S. The force depends {{only of the}} distance of the point from S.

5|$|Mass {{transfer}} diffusion {{takes place}} in the <b>case</b> <b>where</b> adparticle sources and traps such as kinks, steps, and vacancies are present. Instead of being dependent only on the jump potential barrier Ediff, diffusion in this regime is now also dependent on the formation energy of mobile adparticles. The exact nature of the diffusion environment therefore plays a role in dictating the diffusion rate, since the formation energy of an adparticle is different for each type of surface feature as is described in the Terrace Ledge Kink model.|$|E
