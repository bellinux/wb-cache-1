5|$|With the reconfirmation of the <b>Charters</b> in 1300, an {{additional}} document was granted, the Articuli super Cartas (The Articles upon the <b>Charters).</b> It {{was composed of}} 17 articles and sought in part {{to deal with the}} problem of enforcing the <b>Charters.</b> Magna Carta and the Forest Charter were to be issued to the sheriff of each county, and should be read four times a year at the meetings of the county courts. Each county should have a committee of three men who could hear complaints about violations of the <b>Charters.</b>|$|E
5|$|After {{the death}} of Bede in 735, Latin prose in England declined. It reached its lowest level in the ninth century, when few books and <b>charters</b> were produced, and they were of poor quality. King Æthelstan's grandfather, Alfred the Great (871–899) {{embarked}} on an extensive programme to improve learning, and by the 890s the standard of Latin in <b>charters</b> was improving. Few <b>charters</b> survive from the reigns of Alfred and his son, Edward the Elder (899–924), and none from 909 to 925. Up to then <b>charters</b> had generally been plain legal documents, and King Æthelstan's early diplomas were similar.|$|E
5|$|Donnchadh's {{career is}} not well {{documented}} in the surviving sources. <b>Charters</b> provide a little information about some of his activities, but overall their usefulness is limited; this is because no charter-collections (called cartularies) from the Gaelic south-west have survived the Middle Ages, and the only surviving <b>charters</b> relevant to Donnchadh's career come from the heavily Normanised English-speaking area to the east. Principally, the relevant <b>charters</b> record his acts of patronage towards religious houses, but incidental details mentioned {{in the body of}} these texts and the witness lists subscribed to them are useful for other matters.|$|E

5|$|Magna Carta became {{increasingly}} embedded into English political life during Henry III's minority. As the King grew older, his government {{slowly began to}} recover from the civil war, regaining control of the counties and beginning to raise revenue once again, taking care not to overstep the terms of the <b>charters.</b> Henry remained a minor and his government's legal ability to make permanently binding decisions on his behalf was limited. In 1223, the tensions over the status of the <b>charters</b> became clear in the royal court, when Henry's government attempted to reassert its rights over its properties and revenues in the counties, facing resistance from many communities that argued—if sometimes incorrectly—that the <b>charters</b> protected the new arrangements. This resistance resulted in an argument between Archbishop Langton and William Brewer over whether the King had any duty to fulfil the terms of the <b>charters,</b> given that he had been forced to agree to them. On this occasion, Henry gave oral assurances that he considered himself bound by the <b>charters,</b> enabling a royal inquiry into the situation in the counties to progress.|$|E
5|$|Siward can {{be found}} {{witnessing}} numerous <b>charters</b> during Edward's reign, though not as many as the Godwinsons; Siward usually comes third in lists of earls, behind Godwine and Leofric but ahead of Godwine's sons and the other earls. He witnessed at least seven, possibly nine, extant <b>charters</b> in 1044, six or seven in 1045, two in 1046, one in 1048 and one in 1049. A Dux ("earl") named Sihroþ and Sihroð witnessed two <b>charters</b> in 1050, {{and this may be}} Siward. There is another attestation in 1050, and his name appears in two dubious witness lists attached to <b>charters</b> dating to 1052 and 1054. Possibly Siward's last historical appearance in English legal documents is in the agreement made—probably at Lincoln—between Wulfwig, Bishop of Dorchester, and Earl Leofric, dating to between 1053 and 1055.|$|E
5|$|The barons {{anticipated}} that the King would act in accordance with these <b>charters,</b> subject to the law and moderated by {{the advice of the}} nobility. Uncertainty continued, and in 1227, when he was declared of age and able to rule independently, Henry announced that future <b>charters</b> had to be issued under his own seal. This brought into question the validity of the previous <b>charters</b> issued during his minority, and Henry actively threatened to overturn the Charter of the Forest unless the taxes promised in return for it were actually paid. In 1253, Henry confirmed the <b>charters</b> once again in exchange for taxation.|$|E

5|$|Although Alexander was a {{frequent}} witness to royal <b>charters</b> and documents, {{there is no evidence}} that he held an official government position after his appointment as bishop, unlike his relatives Roger and Nigel. Nevertheless, Alexander subsequently appears to have become a regular presence at the royal court. He frequently attested royal <b>charters</b> after 1123, and probably acted as a royal justice in Lincolnshire and the town of Lincoln. He also held the royal castles at Newark, Sleaford and Banbury, and gave confirmations of grants to the church at Godstow.|$|E
5|$|As a result, {{despite a}} {{symbolic}} emphasis on royal power, Henry's rule was relatively circumscribed and constitutional. He generally acted within {{the terms of}} the <b>charters,</b> which prevented the Crown from taking extrajudicial action against the barons, including the fines and expropriations that had been common under John. The <b>charters</b> did not address the sensitive issues of the appointment of royal advisers and the distribution of patronage, and they lacked any means of enforcement if the King chose to ignore them. Henry's rule became lax and careless, resulting in a reduction in royal authority in the provinces and, ultimately, the collapse of his authority at court. The inconsistency with which he applied the <b>charters</b> {{over the course of his}} rule alienated many barons, even those within his own faction.|$|E
5|$|Beorhtwulf {{was married}} to Sæthryth, {{apparently}} a figure of some importance {{in her own right}} as she witnessed all of his <b>charters</b> between 840 and 849, after which she disappears from the record.

5|$|Blois was {{frequently}} {{a witness to}} Puiset's <b>charters,</b> and was named as rector of a parish church {{in the city of}} Durham, appointed by Puiset. By the late 1180s, Blois had moved to the household of Hugh of Avalon, the Bishop of Lincoln. Blois was a subdean, an ecclesiastical official, of the diocese of Lincoln by 22 March 1194, probably from about 1189. He was a frequent witness to Hugh's <b>charters</b> in the late 1180s. Although he was now serving Hugh, Blois did not entirely quit the service of Puiset, and was present at Puiset's deathbed in 1195. He was named precentor of Lincoln in 1197, in succession to the medieval writer Walter Map. Besides Hugh and Puiset, he also served Pope Innocent III. He may be the Master William of Blois who is a witness to some Scottish <b>charters.</b>|$|E

5|$|Hemming's Cartulary is a {{manuscript}} cartulary, or collection of <b>charters</b> and other land records, collected by a monk named Hemming {{around the time}} of the Norman Conquest of England. The manuscript comprises two separate cartularies that were made at different times and later bound together; it is in the British Library as MS Cotton Tiberius A xiii. The first was composed at the end of the 10th or beginning of the 11th century. The second section was compiled by Hemming and was written around the end of the 11th or the beginning of the 12th century. The first section, traditionally titled the Liber Wigorniensis, is a collection of Anglo-Saxon <b>charters</b> and other land records, most of which are organized geographically. The second section, Hemming's Cartulary proper, combines <b>charters</b> and other land records with a narrative of deprivation of property owned by the church of Worcester.|$|E
