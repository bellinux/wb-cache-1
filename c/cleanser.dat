It is a paraben-free three-step kit comprising a <b>cleanser</b> and toning gel, each with 2.5 percent benzoyl peroxide, and a moisturizer with salicylic acid.

5|$|Proactiv, {{also known}} as Proactiv Solution, is a brand of skin-care {{products}} developed by two American dermatologists, Katie Rodan and Kathy Fields, and launched in 1995 by Guthy-Renker, a California-based direct marketing company. The range includes moisturizers, body washes and hair products, but the brand {{is known for its}} three-step anti-acne kit consisting of a <b>cleanser,</b> toner and lotion. Proactiv+, a reformulation of the three-step kit, was introduced in 2013.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Modern therapy of acne {{is based}} also on moisturizers, <b>cleansers</b> and sunscreens. However, {{a few studies}} have been {{published}} on <b>cleansers,</b> and never in Italy. OBJECTIVE: We decided to carry out an epidemiological study on the knowledge, beliefs and perceptions of acne patients regarding <b>cleansers.</b> METHODS: The survey has been carried out in Italy in 2013 - 2014. A group of patients with acne completed a questionnaire which included 10 questions. RESULTS: One hundred and eighteen dermatologists and 786 evaluable acne patients attended the survey.

40|$|Background. Knowledge of the pH {{level of}} soaps and <b>cleansers</b> used by {{patients}} with atopic eczema and sensitive skin is crucial, as high-alkalinity products are irritants and impair the normal skin barrier, so {{interfering with the}} adequate control of atopic eczema. Objectives. The {{aim of this study}} was to assess the pH of various bar soaps and <b>cleansers</b> that are usually recommended and used by patients with atopic diseases and dry, sensitive skin in South Africa. Methods. Forty-nine commercial soap bars and <b>cleansers</b> were randomly selected for pH analysis. The samples were prepared as 8...|$|R
5|$|The toner {{contains}} glycolic acid, an exfoliant, and witch hazel, an astringent. The {{active ingredient}} in the <b>cleanser</b> and lotion, outside Europe, is a 2.5 percent concentration of benzoyl peroxide, lower than in most prescription-strength acne treatments. Benzoyl peroxide has been used since 1934 to kill Propionibacterium acnes, the bacterium that causes acne. Several over-the-counter acne treatments contain it, including Clean & Clear, Clearasil, Doctor's Dermatologic Formula, Neutrogena Advanced Systems, PanOxyl and Stridex.|$|E

Billy then arrives and tries to talk some sense into his father, but it is useless and Spider-Man leaps in to get Connors into the pond. Spider-Man pours the <b>cleanser</b> into the mouth of Connors who, as a result, returns to normal, his arm lost once more.|$|E

5|$|The Māori used {{various parts}} of Cordyline australis to treat {{injuries}} and illnesses, either boiled up into a drink or pounded into a paste. The kōata, the growing tip of the plant, was eaten raw as a blood tonic or <b>cleanser.</b> Juice from the leaves was used for cuts, cracks and sores. An infusion of the leaves was taken internally for diarrhoea and used externally for bathing cuts. The leaves were rubbed until soft and applied either directly or as an ointment to cuts, skin cracks and cracked or sore hands. The young shoot was eaten by nursing mothers and given to children for colic. The liquid from boiled shoots was taken for other stomach pains. The seeds of Cordyline australis are high in linoleic acid, one of the essential fatty acids.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: The {{study was}} aimed to compare and {{evaluate}} {{the changes in the}} impact strength of heat cure denture base resins when treated using denture <b>cleansers.</b> Methodology: Study was conducted with sample size of 40 and dimesion 65 mm length, 10 mm width, and 3 mm thickness as per the ISO 1567. Distilled water has been used as control group, in which 10 samples were immersed of 40 samples. Of remaining 30 samples, 10 were treated with Clinsodent, 10 were treated with VI-Clean, and 10 were treated with Clanden denture <b>cleansers.</b> The impact strength of these specimens from each group was tested with the help of Charpy-type pendulum impact strength tester. The energy absorbed to fracture the specimens was recorded, and impact strength was calculated and was analyzed using Kruskal–Wallis ANOVA and Mann–Whitney test. Results: Impact strength of samples was significantly reduced after immersion in denture <b>cleansers</b> Clinsodent, VI-Clean, and Clanden solutions when compared to control group. Conclusion: Clinsodent, VI-Clean, and Clanden denture <b>cleansers</b> decrease the impact strength of heat cure denture base resin after immersion. Hence, the study concludes that denture <b>cleansers</b> should be used with caution and advised to follow manufacturer's instructions...|$|R
40|$|Surfactants in skin <b>cleansers</b> {{interact}} with the skin in several manners. In addition to the desired benefit of providing skin hygiene, surfactants also extract skin components during cleansing and remain in the stratum corneum (SC) after rinsing. These side effects disrupt SC structure and degrade its barrier properties. Recent applications of vibrational spectroscopy and two-photon microscopy in skin research have provided molecular-level information to facilitate {{our understanding of the}} interaction between skin and surfactant. In the arena of commercial skin <b>cleansers,</b> technologies have been developed to produce <b>cleansers</b> that both cleanse and respect skin barrier. The main approach is to minimize surfactant interaction with skin through altering its solution properties. Recently, hydrophobically modified polymers (HMPs) have been introduced to create skin compatible cleansing systems. At the presence of HMP, surfactants assemble into larger, more stable structures. These structures are less likely to penetrate the skin, thereby resulting in less aggressive <b>cleansers</b> and the integrity of the skin barrier is maintained. In this paper, we reviewed our recent findings on surfactant and SC interactions at molecular level and provided an overview of the HM technology for developing <b>cleansers</b> that respect skin barrier...|$|R

25|$|Removal of {{microorganisms}} from skin {{is enhanced by}} the addition of soaps or detergents to water. The main action of soaps and detergents is to reduce barriers to solution, and increase solubility.

Cleansing is, however, aided by a reasonable flow of water.|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE. The {{purpose of}} this study was to analyze the effect of denture <b>cleansers</b> on Candida albicans biofilm {{formation}} over resilient liners and to evaluate compatibility between resilient liners and denture <b>cleansers.</b> MATERIALS AND METHODS. Acrylic resin (Lucitone 199 ®) and 3 resilient liners (COE-SOFT™, GC RELINE™ and SOFRELINER TOUGH TOUGH®) were incubated in denture <b>cleansers</b> (Polident ® and Cleadent®) for 8 hours a day and in unstimulated saliva for 16 hours a day (n= 25 /gp) for 60 days. Two-way and three-way repeated measures ANOVA were performed to compare the surface roughness (Ra), pH and C. albicans binding level by radioisotope (α= 0. 05). The statistical significance of the relation between Ra and adhesion was evaluated by correlation analysis. RESULTS. The degree of Ra was significantly decreased in the following order: COE-SOFT™, acrylic resin, GC RELINE ™ and SOFRELINER TOUGH®. The immersion in denture <b>cleansers</b> significantly increased Ra of resilient liners, except for SOFRELINER TOUGH ® in Cleadent®. No significant differences in pH curves were observed among groups immersed in distilled water and denture <b>cleansers.</b> The binding levels of C. albicans were significantly decreased in the following order: COE-SOFT™, GC RELINE™, SOFRELINER TOUGH®, and acrylic resin. The immersion in Cleadent ® seemed to decrease C. albicans binding level on GC RELINE ™ and SOFRELINER TOUGH®. CONCLUSION. Based on the C. albicans binding levels results, it is not recommended to immerse COE-SOFT ™ in denture <b>cleansers,</b> and GC RELINE ™ and SOFRELINER TOUGH...|$|R
