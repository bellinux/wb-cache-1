40|$|There is {{the long-standing}} {{assumption}} that radio {{communication in the}} range of hundreds of meters needs to consume mWs of power at the transmitting device. In this paper, we demonstrate that this is not necessarily the case for some devices equipped with backscatter radios. We present LoRea an architecture consisting of a tag, a reader and multiple carrier generators that overcomes the power, cost and range limitations of existing systems such as Computational Radio Frequency Identication (CRFID). LoRea achieves this by: First, generating narrow-band backscatter transmissions that improve receiver sensitivity. Second, mitigating self-interference without the complex designs employed on RFID readers by keeping carrier signal and backscattered signal apart in frequency. Finally, decoupling carrier generation from the reader and using devices such as WiFi routers and sensor nodes as a source of the carrier signal. An off-the-shelf implementation of LoRea costs 70 USD, a drastic reduction in price considering commercial RFID readers cost 2000 USD. LoRea’s range scales with the carrier strength, and proximity to the <b>carrier</b> <b>source</b> and achieves a maximum range of 3. 4 km when the tag is located at 1 m distance from a 28 dBm <b>carrier</b> <b>source</b> while consuming 70 μW at the tag.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2016 - 12 This thesis explores new {{wireless}} power and backscatter communication architectures for ultra-low-power wireless sensors {{and other devices}} such as wearables. We first present measurement, analysis and harvesting approaches for extracting energy from 2. 4 GHz wireless communication signals, including an approach for powering a relatively high power sensor in burst mode at an input power level of - 15 dBm. We present the first backscatter-based data uplink approach that achieves compatibility between backscatter devices and billions of completely unmodified standard wireless devices using the Bluetooth Low Energy standard. We show that this data uplink approach can communicate with BLE receivers with a radio communication efficiency of 28. 4 pJ/bit. This is over 100 x lower energy per bit than conventional BLE transmitters. One microcontroller based implementation consumes over 6 x less power than the best commercially-available Bluetooth transmitters, and can leverage both modulated and unmodulated carriers to provide the backscatter uplink. This al- lows us to transform one BLE signal as a <b>carrier</b> <b>source</b> for another BLE-Backscatter signal. We investigate {{the range of the}} BLE-Backscatter system in both bistatic and monostatic, full-duplex application scenarios. The range analysis considers the BLE receiver sensitivity and performance in the presence of self-jamming interference from the external <b>carrier</b> <b>source</b> in the bistatic case. We also present a carrier cancellation architecture that reduces self-jamming in the monostatic case. We characterize the packet error rate and received signal strength in both cabled and over-the-air scenarios. Finally we present an ultra-low power superheterodyne receiver architecture that leverages an external carrier as the local oscillator, removing the need for on board (or on chip) generation of the local oscillator signal. The receiver uses a two- port mixer for simultaneous mixing and power harvesting of the external carrier and desired BLE signal. This thesis shows a path toward the widespread adoption of backscatter communication in low-power wireless devices such as smart watches, fitness bands, biomedical sensors, etc. Other wireless devices, such as sensors for the Internet of Things (IoT) where power consumption is a crucial consideration could also benefit from the approaches presented...|$|E

A pulsed ferrite {{magnetic}} field generator (FMFG) was designed for the use in the 1000 m long through-theearth (TTE) communication system for mining disaster situations. To miniaturize the TTE system, a ferrite core having 10, 000 of permeability {{was used for the}} FMFG. Attenuation of the magnetic field intensity from the FMFG (200 -turn and 0. 18 m diameter) was calculated to be 89. 95 dB at 1000 m depth soil having 0. 1 S/m of conductivity. This attenuation was lower than 151. 13 dB attenuation of 1 kHz electromagnetic wave at the same conditions.

40|$|A phenomenological {{formulation}} which incorporates both avalanche and tunneling {{mechanisms in}} an IMPATT diode is given. Here tunneling {{is viewed as}} a field‐dependent <b>carrier</b> <b>source.</b> An electron after being field emitted may gain sufficient energy from the field to cause ionization. In this formulation, pure avalanche and pure tunneling appear as the two extreme cases of the general problem. The resultant general dc I‐ V characteristic shows the dominance of tunneling at low voltages and the onset of the multiplication at higher voltages as observed experimentally. A small‐signal admittance of an IMPATT oscillator with tunneling has been calculated. Under some conditions tunneling may increase the negative conductance. However as tunneling dominates, the negative conductance deteriorates and the oscillator will operate in the tunnel transit‐time mode. Tunneling invariably shifts the frequency for optimum negative conductance upwards. The threshold frequency for negative conductance varies as the square root of current density for large multiplication factors as expected. However, for small ones it converges to a value determined only by the drift transit time. The general admittance expression reduces to that of pure avalanche and pure tunneling under the prescription ωa → ω as M → ∞ and ωa → ωaz as M → 1, respectively. ωa, ωa 0, and ωaz are the modified avalanche frequencies for the general case, pure avalanche, and pure tunneling, respectively...|$|E

Proteeae species bacteriuria occurred in eight carriers (53. 3 %) and six noncarriers (11. 5 %) (P = 0. 001). At the 10 (2) to 10 (4) /ml level, Proteeae species were isolated in urine specimens from seven carriers (46. 7 %) and four noncarriers (7. 7 %) (P = 0. 001).

In order to move in this direction, new sources of energy must be identified and sustainable methods must be realized. The overarching themes of sustainable energy addressed in this thesis are developing clean fuel, advancing energy efficiency, and advancing clean energy. These themes lend toward removal of our current reliance on unclean sources like oil and coal, and useless nonrenewables, toxic substances, and chemical waste. The future energy source we chose to focus on is hydrogen by photoelectrochemical water splitting using metal oxide semiconductors and visible sunlight. To advance clean energy we have chosen {{to focus on a}} greener approach to organic oxidations, specifically amine oxidation, by use of a semiconductor metal oxide and visible sunlight. With a Z-scheme approach for water splitting the central material focused on this work is copper tungstate, an n-type visible- light absorbing semiconductor, for the water oxidation half reaction. An emphasis is also placed on the use of copper tungstate to provide sustainable pathways for organic amine oxidation reactions. Another n-type material from the tungstate family, alpha tin tungstate, was also synthesized and explored for sustainable water oxidation. Copper tungstate was evaluated for mechanistic insight into water oxidation under visible-light illumination using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). A mid-gap energy state (rather than the valence band) was identified as the <b>carrier</b> <b>source</b> in the water oxidation reaction on the surface of polycrystalline sol-gel copper tungstate electrodes.

40|$|Introduction: A {{strategy}} for bone tissue engineering is to combine osteochondroprogenitor cells, osteoconductive carriers and osteoinductive biomolecules in constructs that induce in vivo bone formation. During the past years, {{the field has}} been directed to implement in vitro processes that mimic in vivo tissue development. Therefore, when engineering these constructs, human periosteum-derived cells (hPDC) are a promising cell source. CaP is an interesting <b>carrier</b> <b>source,</b> as 70 % of our bones consist of hydroxyapatite and certain CaP carriers are reported to be osteoinductive in combination with hPDCs. The identification of this bone forming mechanisms is a crucial step towards engineering robust constructs. It {{has been reported that}} bone formation in CaP-hPDC-containing constructs is dependent on the presence of Ca 2 + together with the activation of Wnt and BMP-signalling, as deletion or inhibition of these parameters abrogated the bone formation. However, not much is known regarding the cellular mechanism of action in Ca-induced bone formation. Therefore, this study aimed to identify the early-activated cellular pathways that drive in vivo bone formation. In addition, we intended to identify the earliest time point and its associated important cellular and material variables which could be used to predict the bone forming capacity of CaP- and hPDC-containing constructs in vivo. Materials & Methods: In order to investigate this, three commercially available CaP-carriers (CopiOs, VitOss and NuOss) known to have different bone forming capacities (0, 3 and 13 % respectively) in combination with hPDCs, were seeded and implanted in an ectopic nude mouse model. To investigate activated signalling pathways, RNA and protein were isolated after both 24 h of in vitro culture and 3 & 12 days of in vivo implantation, for gene expression analysis by quantitative PCR and protein phosphorylation by Western Blot. In parallel, Ca 2 +-release from the carriers was measured during 21 days of in vitro incubation in PBS. Results: After 24 h, Ca 2 +-release in CopiOs was 4 -fold higher as compared to NuOss and 2 -fold higher as compared to VitOss. In addition, after 3 days in vivo, a 20 -fold higher phosphorylation could be seen. Gene expression analysis displayed upregulated Wnt-signalling in CopiOs-constructs after 24 h in vitro (Axin 2) and 3 days in vivo (LRP 5). Gene expression for chondrogenic markers displayed a 5 -fold upregulation of Sox 9, a 2 -fold higher ColII and a 6 -fold higher Coll X expression in the NuOss carrier as compared to CopiOs after 12 days in vivo. Gene expression for bone markers displayed a 3 -fold upregulation of Runx 2 and over 20 -fold higher expression of Osterix in the NuOss carrier as compared to CopiOs after 12 days in vivo. On protein level, BMP-signalling could be detected in the NuOss constructs by phosphorylation of Smad 1 / 5 / 8 after 3 days in vivo, as compared to CopiOs constructs. This could be correlated to upregulated expression of BMP-ligands after 24 h in vitro (BMP- 7) and 3 days in vivo (BMP- 2 and BMP- 7). In addition, a more than 2 -fold higher expression of BMP-target genes ID 1 and ID 3 was found in the same constructs. By hierarchical clustering, factors could be grouped based on their dissimilarity. Those factors who had a strong effect on the in vivo bone forming capacity were further evaluated by partial least square modelling, to predict the in vivo bone formation based on the day 12 samples. Variables with high importance were BMP- 2, Runx 2, Sox 9 and ID 1 expression. Conclusion: In conclusion, this study highlights the crucial inhibitory effect of a high Ca 2 +-release (via phosphorylation of PKC and subsequently β-catenin) on CaP-induced bone formation, which abrogates early activated Wnt signalling. In the presence of a lower Ca-release, early BMP-activation initiated bone formation, which later was driven by enhanced BMP-signalling and followed by stimulated Wnt-signalling. Suitable prediction markers were found to be BMP- 7, Runx 2, Sox 9 and ID 1 expression in explants isolated 12 days after in vivo implantation. status: accepte...|$|E
