25|$|On April 27, 2016, Cruz {{announced}} that, if he {{were selected}} as the party's nominee, he would choose former CEO of HP and fellow 2016 Republican presidential candidate <b>Carly</b> <b>Fiorina</b> as his vice-presidential running mate.|$|E
25|$|Two Trump electors in Texas did {{not vote}} for Trump (one vote went to John Kasich, one to Ron Paul); one elector {{did not vote}} for Pence and instead voted for <b>Carly</b> <b>Fiorina</b> for Vice-President; a third {{resigned}} before the vote rather than vote for Trump {{and was replaced by}} an alternate.|$|E

5000|$|Davi has lent {{his voice}} to {{political}} ads, including <b>Carly</b> <b>Fiorina's</b> [...] "Demon Sheep" [...] attack ad, [...] "Hot Air: The Movie", and others produced by Republican media consultant Fred Davis.|$|R
50|$|A lifelong Republican, Perenchio was a {{supporter}} of initiatives and advocacy organizations that benefited the GOP. He was co-finance director for Senator John McCain's 2008 presidential campaign {{as well as an}} early and influential supporter of <b>Carly</b> <b>Fiorina's</b> 2016 presidential primary campaign.|$|R
25|$|The society holds a {{national}} lawyers convention {{each year in}} Washington, D.C. It {{is one of the}} highest profile conservative legal events of the year. Speakers have included former ACLU head Nadine Strossen, business executive <b>Carly</b> <b>Fiorina,</b> former BB chairman John Allison, former Attorney General Michael Mukasey, and U.S. Senator Mike Lee.|$|E
25|$|Of the faithless votes, Colin Powell and Elizabeth Warren {{were the}} only two to receive more than one; Powell {{received}} three electoral votes for President and Warren received two for Vice President. Receiving one valid electoral vote each were Sanders, John Kasich, Ron Paul and Faith Spotted Eagle for President, and <b>Carly</b> <b>Fiorina,</b> Susan Collins, Winona LaDuke and Maria Cantwell for Vice President. Sanders is the first Jewish American to receive an electoral vote for President. LaDuke is the first Green Party member to receive an electoral vote, and Paul is the third member of the Libertarian Party to do so, following the party's presidential and vice-presidential nominees each getting one vote in 1972. It is the first election with faithless electors from more than one political party. The seven people to receive electoral votes for president were the most in a single election since 1796, and more than any other election since the enactment of the Twelfth Amendment in 1804.|$|E
500|$|When {{asked how}} she felt about Fey's portrayal, Sarah Palin replied, [...] "I watched with the volume {{all the way down}} and I thought it was hilarious... I didn't hear a word she said, but the visual was spot on." [...] Palin [...] "and the press corps watched the sketch {{in the back of her}} plane, {{laughing}} at Tina and Amy's satirical take on the two politicians," [...] and Palin later claimed that she had once dressed up as Fey for Halloween. However, <b>Carly</b> <b>Fiorina,</b> a spokeswoman for the John McCain campaign argued that the sketch portrayed Hillary Clinton as [...] "very substantive," [...] but Fiorina thought, in the case of Sarah Palin, that she was portrayed as [...] "totally superficial." [...] Fiorina thought the sketch was [...] "disrespectful in the extreme" [...] and [...] "sexist." ...|$|E
50|$|Collins faced heavy {{criticism}} {{once again}} after she joked on a segment that presidential candidate <b>Carly</b> <b>Fiorina's</b> face looked 'demented' when smiling during a primary debate. Collins also humorously defended Hillary Clinton's marriage against {{statements made by}} Fiorina, coining the hashtag: #BitchCommits.|$|R
50|$|Former State Senator and California Secretary of State Bruce McPherson {{alleged that}} during a {{telephone}} call with <b>Carly</b> <b>Fiorina's</b> campaign manager, Marty Wilson, Wilson expressed surprise that McPherson was endorsing the candidacy of Tom Campbell, and called him an anti-Semite. Subsequently, Wilson strongly denied having made that charge against Campbell, thus leading to a controversy for the Fiorina campaign, where the credibility of long-time Sacramento political operative Marty Wilson was called into a comparison with that of Bruce McPherson.|$|R
50|$|The Demon Sheep or Demon Sheep ad is a {{political}} ad created as part of <b>Carly</b> <b>Fiorina's</b> 2010 campaign for the United States Senate. The ad gained international attention for its characterization of Fiorina's opponent as a wolf in sheep's clothing, portrayed by {{a man wearing a}} sheep costume with glowing red eyes. Although opinion remains divided as to the effectiveness of the ad in supporting Fiorina's campaign, it is widely {{regarded as one of the}} most bizarre and memorable political advertisements ever devised.|$|R
500|$|Taibbi writes {{critically}} of {{the impact}} press coverage had on the 2016 election. He recounts {{the process by which}} Trump, previously known for his reality television appearances, learned how to strategically manipulate coverage of his campaign through boorish behavior. Taibbi describes a campaign placed with post-truth politics where facts are subsumed by reactions garnered from television audiences. The author recounts that such strategic campaigning was not beholden simply to Donald Trump, but extended to other candidates including <b>Carly</b> <b>Fiorina.</b> The author is critical of the nature by which press coverage of politics has moved to the extremes, writing, [...] "The model going forward will likely involve Republican media covering Democratic corruption and Democratic media covering Republican corruption." [...] He notes it is rare that press companies {{from one side of the}} political divide will cover the same subject matter as the other.|$|E
500|$|Reactions against Davis {{also came}} from the White House, from Kentucky Governor Steve Beshear, and from {{candidates}} {{in the race for}} the 2016 presidential election. White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said, [...] "No public official is above the rule of law. Certainly not the president of the United States, but neither is the Rowan County clerk." [...] Governor Beshear said the judge's decision [...] "speaks for itself", while his attorneys called the legal arguments in her suit against him [...] "absurd". Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton said, [...] "Officials should be held to their duty to uphold the law– end of story." [...] Several Republican presidential candidates also called on Davis to comply with court orders. Donald Trump said, [...] "the decision's been made, and that is the law of the land." [...] Jeb Bush, former governor of Florida, said Davis [...] "is sworn to uphold the law", but also suggested that some sort of accommodation be made for her. Republican presidential candidates <b>Carly</b> <b>Fiorina</b> and Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina both suggested that Davis should comply with the court order or resign. Members of the Westboro Baptist Church protested against Davis for her multiple divorces and marriages, saying she is living in adultery. Westboro also stated [...] "God hates oath breakers", therefore Davis is obligated to follow the nation's law.|$|E

5000|$|The next {{part of the}} ad blames Campbell, who was California's Director of Finance from 2004 to 2005, for California's budget woes, as {{images of}} Campbell are alternated with footage of sheets of money being printed, played at {{increasing}} speed, and images of pigs, sheep, out-of-business signs, and a close-up of the word [...] "deficit" [...] in a dictionary. The narrator asks, [...] "who would remember the Tom Campbell Budget?" [...] as pictures of people from various walks of life appear, each of them wearing a concerned expression; the narrator answers his own question: [...] "we would." [...] As hundred-dollar bills float by in the background, the narrator castigates Campbell for having supported various taxes, especially {{an increase in the}} gasoline tax, proposed following the financial crisis of 2007-08. Images of Campbell now alternate with footage of a sheep chewing its cud at increasingly rapid speeds. In a sarcastic tone of voice, the narrator repeatedly asks [...] "Tom" [...] whether his actions or stances on various issues were [...] "fiscally conservative". Campbell's support for other taxes, and having been [...] "critical of the Bush tax cuts" [...] are also mentioned, as an image of <b>Carly</b> <b>Fiorina's</b> signature on the Taxpayer Protection Pledge appears. The ad calls Campbell the [...] "only Republican candidate" [...] not to sign the pledge.|$|R
5000|$|In early 2005, after news leaks about then-CEO <b>Carly</b> <b>Fiorina's</b> {{clashes with}} the board surfaced, Fiorina hired a law firm to find the source. [...] In February 2005, Fiorina left the company and Patricia Dunn, non-executive chairwoman, {{continued}} the investigation. [...] As {{part of a larger}} scandal, a subcontractor used pretexting to expose Keyworth as the source of an alleged additional leak to CNET, and he was outed at a May 18, 2006 board meeting. [...] At the meeting, Dunn asked Keyworth to resign, he refused asserting that he was not the source of any unauthorized or inappropriate communication with reporters, and another board member (Tom Perkins) resigned over the way Keyworth was being treated. [...] HP revealed the story on September 6, 2006 and said that they were not seeking Keyworth's reelection to the board. Coinciding with Mark V. Hurd's promotion to chairman, Keyworth resigned on September 12. [...] In connection with Keyworth's resignation, HP made the following statement regarding the alleged CNET leak: [...] "At HP's request, Dr. Keyworth often had contacts with the press to explain HP's interests. The board does not believe that Dr. Keyworth's contact with CNET in January 2006 was vetted through appropriate channels, but also recognizes that his discussion with the CNET reporter was undertaken in an attempt to further HP's interests. HP board chairman Patricia Dunn expressed regret for the intrusion into his privacy." ...|$|R

2500|$|The {{attraction}} {{opened to}} the public in a [...] "soft opening" [...] mode in June 2003, and celebrated its grand opening on October 9 with a ceremony attended by Disney CEO Michael Eisner, HP CEO <b>Carly</b> <b>Fiorina</b> and NASA Administrator Sean O'Keefe, as well as several NASA astronauts from its many phases of human space exploration (Mercury, Gemini, Apollo, the space shuttle program and two crew members aboard the International Space Station).|$|E
2500|$|In 2015, various Republican presidential {{candidates}} indicated {{their willingness to}} bring back waterboarding as an interrogation technique. Donald Trump (the eventual winner of the election) stated he believed in {{the effectiveness of the}} technique. Trump also stated that it is a [...] "minimal" [...] form of torture, and that it was necessary. Ben Carson had not ruled out approving its use, nor did Jeb Bush. <b>Carly</b> <b>Fiorina</b> endorsed its use, as did Rick Perry and Rick Santorum.|$|E
2500|$|... (b) Two faithless electors from Texas {{cast their}} presidential votes for Ron Paul and John Kasich, respectively. Chris Suprun {{stated that he}} cast his presidential vote for John Kasich and his vice presidential vote for <b>Carly</b> <b>Fiorina.</b> The other faithless elector in Texas, Bill Greene, cast his presidential vote for Ron Paul but cast his vice presidential vote for Mike Pence, as pledged. John Kasich {{received}} recorded write-in votes in Alabama, Georgia, Illinois, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Vermont.|$|E
2500|$|Also on August 25, Bartoshevich {{was made}} {{the central figure}} of a press conference {{sponsored}} by the Republican National Committee and hosted by <b>Carly</b> <b>Fiorina.</b> Bartoshevich, who is pro-choice, was asked about McCain's views on Roe v. Wade. She responded by saying, [...] "Going back to 1999, John McCain did {{an interview with the}} San Francisco Chronicle saying that overturning Roe v. Wade would not make any sense, because then women would have to have illegal abortions". This raised questions, because McCain's position [...] was that Roe v. Wade should be overturned. In the presidential debate held on October 15, McCain reiterated this point.|$|E
2500|$|Thiel {{initially}} supported <b>Carly</b> <b>Fiorina</b> campaign {{during the}} 2016 GOP presidential primary elections. After Fiorina dropped out, Thiel supported Donald Trump {{and became one}} of the pledged California delegates for Trump's nomination at the 2016 Republican National Convention. He was also a headline speaker during the convention, during which he announced that he was [...] "proud to be gay". On October 15, 2016, Thiel announced a $1.25 million donation in support of Donald Trump's presidential campaign. Thiel stated to The New York Times: [...] "I didn’t give him any money for a long time because I didn’t think it mattered, and then the campaign asked me to." [...] After Trump's victory, Thiel was named to the executive committee of the President-elect's transition team.|$|E

2500|$|In 1992 4-term {{incumbent}} Democratic Senator Alan Cranston retired, {{creating an}} open seat contest. In what {{was billed as}} the [...] "Year of the Woman" [...] then Rep. Barbara Boxer beat fellow Rep. Mel Levine and Lieutenant Governor Leo McCarthy in the Democratic primary, winning 44% of the vote. [...] In the general election, Boxer won the U.S. Senate elections that year, defeating Bruce Herschensohn, a conservative television political commentator from Los Angeles, by 4.9%. A last-minute revelation that Herschensohn had attended a strip club at least partially affected the outcome. In 1998, she won a second term, beating sitting California State Treasurer Matt Fong by 10.1% of the vote. After facing no primary opposition in the 2004 election, Boxer defeated GOP candidate Bill Jones, the former California Secretary of State, {{by a margin of}} 20 percentage points. In 2010, Boxer defeated GOP candidate <b>Carly</b> <b>Fiorina,</b> former chief executive officer of Hewlett-Packard, by a margin of 10 percentage points.|$|E
2500|$|In June 2015, VanderSloot and {{his wife}} gave $50,000 to a {{political}} action committee (Conservative Solutions PAC) funding Florida senator Marco Rubio’s campaign as the Republican Party nominee for the 2016 presidential election. VanderSloot also contributed $2,700, the maximum allowed by law, to the GOP presidential campaign of former technology executive <b>Carly</b> <b>Fiorina.</b> In November 2015, VanderSloot announced that he supported Rubio for president and {{that he planned to}} host fundraisers and bundle contributions on Rubio's behalf. In June 2016, VanderSloot said that he was ready to support Donald Trump as the [...] "best bet" [...] to defeat Hillary Clinton, and in September of that year Donald Trump Jr. made a private visit to VanderSloot at Melaleuca headquarters. Following the presidential election in November 2016, VanderSloot announced on Twitter that Trump was not his first, second, or third choice as a candidate but that it was “time {{for all of us to}} come together and unite behind our new president.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Palin and Clinton were {{compared}} and contrasted {{with one another}} in the media. A New York Times article explains, [...] "Mrs. Clinton and Ms. Palin have little in common beyond their breakout performances at the conventions and the soap opera aspects of their family lives. Mrs. Clinton always faces high expectations; Ms. Palin faced low expectations this week, and benefited from them. Mrs. Clinton can seem harsh when she goes on the attack; Ms. Palin has shown a knack for attacking without seeming nasty. Mrs. Clinton has a lot of experience; Ms. Palin, not so much. Mrs. Clinton is pantsuits; Ms. Palin is skirts." [...] Guy Cecil, the former political director of Mrs. Clinton's campaign, said it was [...] "insulting" [...] for Republicans to compare Ms. Palin to Mrs. Clinton." [...] The Saturday Night Live skit [...] "A Nonpartisan Message from Governor Sarah Palin & Senator Hillary Clinton" [...] counterpoised Palin, played by Tina Fey, against Hillary Clinton, played by Amy Poehler. The skit pointed out their opposing political views and presented Palin as unversed in global politics, as emphasized by the line: [...] "I can see Russia from my house." [...] Ex-Hewlett-Packard chief executive and former McCain advisor <b>Carly</b> <b>Fiorina</b> blasted the Saturday Night Live sketch in a television interview: [...] "They were defining Hillary Clinton as very substantive and Sarah Palin as totally superficial," [...] and an ABC news blog headline soon after ran, [...] "Now the McCain Campaign's Complaining that Saturday Night Live Skit Was 'Sexist'." ...|$|E
2500|$|McCain {{turned his}} {{attention}} to the November general election, while the Democratic primaries continued to be a battle between Clinton and Obama. McCain faced the challenge of staying in the news as the Democrats garnered headlines with their protracted nomination battle, which showed no signs of ending before the Democratic National Convention in late August. However, having the nomination locked up early also gave McCain time to build a national organization and put his general election strategy into action for the six months leading up to the Republican National Convention. McCain planned to raise money and visit several sites in the U.S. before embarking on a tour of Europe and the Middle East as part of a congressional delegation. McCain did not immediately indicate when he would make his choice for Vice President. Even before his March 4 primary wins, McCain indicated that he would campaign [...] "everywhere" [...] in the general election - including traditionally Democratic states like California, New Jersey and Connecticut. A Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll released March 12 showed McCain in a virtual tie with both Obama and Clinton in hypothetical November matchups. In an attempt to make up for his fundraising disadvantage in relation to the Democratic candidates, the campaign merged its resources with the Republican National Committee, and named former Hewlett-Packard CEO <b>Carly</b> <b>Fiorina</b> head of the [...] "Victory 2008" [...] committee charged with fundraising and Get Out The Vote efforts. The campaign also announced that it would use an unorthodox organizational structure, opting to have several regional campaign directors rather than one centralized staff.|$|E
2500|$|Following the {{nomination}} of Sarah Palin for the vice presidency at the Republican National Convention, Palin and Clinton were compared and contrasted {{with one another in}} the media, due to their status as women running in the 2008 presidential election.

Mrs. Clinton always faces high expectations; Mrs. Palin faced low expectations this week, and benefited from them.

Mrs. Clinton is pantsuits; Mrs. Palin is skirts." [...] Guy Cecil, the former political director of Mrs. Clinton's campaign, said it was [...] "insulting" [...] for Republicans to compare Palin to Clinton. A Saturday Night Live skit, [...] "A Nonpartisan Message From Governor Sarah Palin & Senator Hillary Clinton", counterposed Palin, played by Tina Fey, against Hillary Clinton, played by Amy Poehler. Fey presented Palin as a dimwit unable to understand global politics, as emphasized by the line: [...] "I can see Russia from my house." [...] Former Hewlett-Packard chief executive and McCain advisor <b>Carly</b> <b>Fiorina</b> blasted that one of the Saturday Night Live parodies of Sarah Palin in a television interview: [...] "They were defining Hillary Clinton as very substantive and Sarah Palin as totally superficial," [...] and an ABC News headline soon after ran, [...] "Now the McCain Campaign's Complaining that Saturday Night Live Skit Was 'Sexist'".
