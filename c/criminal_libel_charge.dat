500|$|On October 27, {{both men}} {{appeared}} before police magistrate A. H. Gibson for their preliminary {{hearings on the}} <b>criminal</b> <b>libel</b> <b>charge</b> (the counselling to murder charge had been dropped). Unwin opted for a jury trial, while Powell elected to be tried by a judge alone. Unwin's trial proceeded first, on November 12. He testified that he had ordered the pamphlets, which were {{paid for by the}} government, and then circulated them as a publication of the [...] "United Democrats", a fictitious organization that listed its address as that of Unwin's home. According to Unwin, the leaflet's text, minus the named individuals, had been provided to him by Powell, he had sent it to the printer's in exactly that form, and he was surprised to see the list of names in the final version. [...] Though his testimony was vague and apparently evasive, he admitted to destroying 4,000 copies of the leaflet {{on the day of the}} police raid. [...] He was convicted and Ives, dismissing his role in the affair as that of an [...] "errand boy", sentenced him to three months hard labour.|$|E
50|$|In 1835 Charles Dickens {{worked as}} a {{reporter}} in the building for the Morning Chronicle, and Louis Napoleon appeared in court as witness in a fraud case between attempts to establish a second empire in France in 1847.

5000|$|The {{work was}} {{originally}} self-published, with illustrations by Hardy's {{friend and fellow}} Communist [...] "Amb" [...] Dyson, with the rubric [...] "a novel in three parts by Frank J. Hardy, Ross Franklyn". [...] "Ross Franklyn" [...] was the pseudonym Hardy had always used prior to Power Without Glory. This combination of real name and pen name was also used in Hardy's 1961 book The Hard Way which describes the difficulties [...] "Ross Franklyn" [...] had in having the book published, and the problems Frank Hardy faced in answering the <b>criminal</b> <b>libel</b> <b>charge</b> against him arising from the publication.|$|E

50|$|The magazine's {{frequent}} {{investigations of}} corruption have led politicians {{to sue the}} editor-in-chief Senad Avdić. On 23 June 1999, Sarajevo Municipal Court sentenced Avdić to a two-month suspended jail term on <b>charges</b> of <b>criminal</b> <b>libel.</b> This led to the Committee to Protect Journalists to condemn the conviction and sentencing of Senad Avdić on <b>criminal</b> <b>libel</b> <b>charges</b> {{as a violation of}} all international norms of press freedom.|$|R
50|$|On January 9, 1827 Baltimore's {{most notorious}} slave-trader, Austin Woolfolk, whom Lundy had been {{investigating}} in public records since his move to Baltimore and severely criticizing, assaulted Lundy {{as he walked}} along a downtown street. Head-kicks and other injuries until bystanders pulled the strapping Woolfolk off his slightly-built victim confined Lundy to his bed for several days. Woolfolk pleaded guilty to assault, but Judge Nicholas Brice agreed with Woolfolk's lawyers that Lundy had provoked it by criticizing Woolfolk's lawful occupation, and therefore sentenced the slavetrader to a one dollar fine and court costs. He also urged Woolfolk to bring <b>criminal</b> <b>libel</b> <b>charges</b> against Lundy, but a grand jury refused to indict him.|$|R

5000|$|Another {{litigation}} {{case against}} the magazine was initiated by James Goldsmith, who managed to arrange for <b>criminal</b> <b>libel</b> <b>charges</b> to be brought, meaning that, if found guilty, those behind the Eye could be imprisoned. He sued over allegations {{that members of the}} Clermont Set, including Goldsmith, had conspired to shelter Lord Lucan after Lucan had murdered his family nanny, Sandra Rivett. Goldsmith won a partial victory and eventually reached a settlement with the magazine. The case threatened to bankrupt Private Eye, which turned to its readers for financial support {{in the form of a}} [...] "Goldenballs Fund". Goldsmith himself was referred to as [...] "Jaws". The solicitor involved in many litigation cases against Private Eye, including the Goldsmith case, was Peter Carter-Ruck, whose firm the magazine refers to this day as [...] "Carter-Fuck".|$|R
50|$|In {{the summer}} of 1937, O'Hara got into an altercation with the state racing steward. The state Horse Racing Division ordered that O'Hara be removed as a track {{official}} of the race track for intimidating and interfering with the steward. A Superior Court judge issued a restraining order which temporarily set aside the division's ruling. Attorney General of Rhode Island John Patrick Hartigan then got the restraining order set aside by the court's presiding judge. The Horse Racing Division also ordered an audit of the Narragansett Racing Association's books, which resulted in six new charges against the track to revoke its license the fall racing season. O'Hara responded to the charges in the Star-Tribune in an article which he implied that Governor Quinn was or {{would end up in}} Butler Hospital, a psychiatric hospital that specialized in the treatment of substance abuse. Quinn eventually pursued <b>criminal</b> <b>libel</b> <b>charges</b> against O'Hara. O'Hara was arrested by state police at his penthouse at Narragansett Park. He was quickly released on bail.|$|R
500|$|Queensberry {{was arrested}} on a <b>charge</b> of <b>criminal</b> <b>libel,</b> a <b>charge</b> {{carrying}} a possible sentence of {{up to two years}} in prison. Under the 1843 Libel Act, Queensberry could avoid conviction for libel only by demonstrating that his accusation was in fact true, and furthermore that there was some [...] "public benefit" [...] to having made the accusation openly. Queensberry's lawyers thus hired private detectives to find evidence of Wilde's homosexual liaisons. They decided on a strategy of portraying Wilde as a depraved older man who habitually enticed naïve youths into a life of vicious homosexuality to demonstrate that there was some public interest in having made the accusation openly.|$|R
2500|$|The {{pursuit of}} an isthmus canal in Central America {{during this period}} focused on two {{possible}} routes—Nicaragua and Panama, which was then a rebellious district within Colombia. Roosevelt convinced Congress to approve the Panamanian alternative, and a treaty was approved, only to be rejected by the Colombian government. When the Panamanians learned of this, a rebellion followed, was supported by Roosevelt, and succeeded. A treaty with the new Panama government for construction of the canal was then reached in 1903. Roosevelt received criticism for paying the bankrupt Panama Canal Company and the New Panama Canal Company $40,000,000 for the rights and equipment to build the canal. Critics charged that an American investor syndicate allegedly divided the large payment among themselves. There was also controversy over whether a French company engineer influenced Roosevelt in choosing the Panama route for the canal over the Nicaragua route. Roosevelt denied charges of corruption concerning the canal in a January 8, 1906 message to Congress. In January 1909, Roosevelt, in an unprecedented move, brought <b>criminal</b> <b>libel</b> <b>charges</b> against the New York World and the Indianapolis News known as the [...] "Roosevelt-Panama Libel Cases". Both cases were dismissed by U.S. District Courts, and on January 3, 1911, the U.S. Supreme Court, upon federal appeal, upheld the lower courts' rulings. Historians are sharply critical of Roosevelt's criminal prosecutions of the World and the News, but are divided on whether actual corruption in acquiring and building the Panama Canal took place.|$|R
50|$|While {{based in}} London, Malatesta made clandestine trips to France, Switzerland and Italy {{and went on}} a lecture tour of Spain with Fernando Tarrida del Mármol. During this time he wrote several {{important}} pamphlets, including L'Anarchia. Malatesta then {{took part in the}} International Anarchist Congress of Amsterdam (1907), where he debated in particular with Pierre Monatte on the relation between anarchism and syndicalism (or trade-unionism). The latter thought that syndicalism was revolutionary and would create the conditions of a social revolution, while Malatesta considered that syndicalism by itself was not sufficient. (see on Labor Unions, below). In 1912, Malatesta appeared in Bow Street Police Court on a <b>criminal</b> <b>libel</b> (defamation) <b>charge,</b> which resulted in a 3-month prison sentence, and his recommendation for deportation. This order was quashed following campaigning by the radical press and demonstrations by workers organisations.|$|R
25|$|Individuals can {{criticize the}} {{government}} publicly or privately, {{but there are}} criminal penalties, including prison sentences, for libel and slander, and government officials have sought to use these against the political opposition and other critics.
