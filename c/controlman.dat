5|$|The book {{begins by}} {{describing}} conditions aboard Iowa before the explosion. Thompson depicts Moosally, the ship's captain, as an inept seaman who gained {{command of the}} battleship through political connections. Under Moosally's leadership, or lack thereof, Iowa operated with severe training and safety deficiencies, {{especially with regard to}} operations with the ship's 16-inch guns. The book details how the ship's Master Chief Fire <b>Controlman,</b> Stephen Skelley, conducted illegal gunnery experiments with the 16-inch guns. Moosally apparently did not check to ensure that the experiments were authorized, or in some cases, appears not to have been aware that they were being carried out.|$|E
25|$|The {{rating was}} {{established}} in 1797, and separate pay grades were implemented in 1893. The sleeve insignia for the rating depicted two crossed axes. Responsibilities of carpenter's mates included maintaining ship ventilation, watertight control, painting, and drainage. During the era of wooden ships, carpenter's mates were charged with maintaining {{the integrity of the}} ship's hull. In times of battle, carpenter's mates would fight fires and use plugs to patch holes in the hull. In 1948, the rating was changed to damage <b>controlman.</b>|$|E
25|$|In August 2008, it was {{announced}} that 6 sailors had been charged and would face courts-martial for abusing detainees at Camp Bucca. The abuse allegedly occurred on 14 May and involved beatings of two detainees and the sealing of eight detainees in a cell filled with pepper spray while the cells' ventilation was secured. The abuse apparently occurred after some detainees attacked guards, spitting on them and throwing containers filled with human waste at them. Seven other sailors received non-judicial punishment for failing to report the incidents. Two had their charges dismissed, and the remainder were reduced in rank or faced suspended punishment. In November 2008, the 6 sailors faced an article 32 hearing at Naval Air Station Jacksonville on charges of conspiracy, cruelty and maltreatment and making false official statements. Damage <b>Controlman</b> 2nd Class Adam M. White, pleaded guilty to conspiracy and assault and was sentenced to 89 days confinement and reduction of two pay grades. Adams claims he and other sailors participated in the beating of two detainees at the direction of Chief Aviation Structural Mechanic Tracy Necaise because the prisoners spit and threw feces at guards. Necaise’s attorney blamed upper-level Navy officers for the incident because they assigned the sailors to Camp Bucca without any prior experience working in law enforcement or detention facilities. Necaise and the remaining sailors pleaded not guilty and could face trial in 2009.|$|E
5000|$|Navy DCs do {{the work}} {{necessary}} for damage control, ship stability, firefighting, fire prevention, and chemical, biological and radiological warfare defense. They also instruct personnel in the methods of damage control and chemical, biological and radiological defense, and repair damage control equipment and systems. After completion of [...] "A" [...] school, USN damage <b>controlmen</b> are assigned to ships of all types in the United States or overseas, TAR damage <b>controlmen</b> are assigned to NRF ships in CONUS. In a typical 20-year period in the Navy, they spend about 65 {{percent of their time}} on sea duty and about 35 percent on shore duty. Upon completing sea tours, USN damage <b>controlmen</b> will be assigned to shore duty in fleet concentration areas. TAR damage <b>controlmen</b> will be assigned to reserve centers across the nation including the heartland. While assigned to a reserve center TAR damage <b>controlmen</b> will train and administer selected reserve personnel.|$|R

500|$|In January 1989 Iowas Master Chief Fire <b>Controlman,</b> Stephen Skelley, and Gunnery Officer, Lieutenant Commander Kenneth Michael Costigan, persuaded Moosally {{to allow}} them to {{experiment}} with increasing the range of the main guns using [...] "supercharged" [...] powder bags and specially designed shells. [...] Moosally was led to believe, falsely, that top officials from Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) had authorized the experiments. In fact, John McEachren, a mid-level bureaucrat with NAVSEA, had given the go-ahead to conduct the experiments even though he had no authority to do so. McEachren concealed his approval of the gunnery experiments from his superiors.|$|E

50|$|Floodability is the {{susceptibility}} of a ship's {{construction to}} flooding. It also {{refers to the}} ability to intentionally flood certain areas of the hull for damage control purposes, or to increase stability, which is particularly important in combat vessels, which often face the possibility of serious hull breach due to enemy action, and which rely on well-trained Damage <b>Controlmen</b> to equalize and then stop flooding of the hull.|$|R
50|$|The {{rating was}} {{established}} in 1941, when it was split off from the gunner's mate rating. Fire <b>controlmen</b> were highly skilled technicians responsible for the operation of various forms of range finding gear, and solving ballistics calculations to control the firing of the ship's guns. These skills were originally employed primarily for naval gunfire support, and surface combat, but during World War II, the responsibilities expanded into anti-aircraft warfare as well.|$|R

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedHuman Systems Integration ReportThe military screening process entails meeting general physical and cognitive standards and then primarily matching candidates with a specialization based on cognitive test scores. Little consideration {{is given to}} the physical abilities required to perform tasks in that specialization. An online survey was used to explore the perceived relationship among personnel readiness, job performance and work demands for Boatswains Mates (BM) and Damage <b>Controlmen</b> (DC). This study explored four research questions to evaluate physical ability testing. Descriptive statistics showed that the participants had a wide range of experience levels. The results from the logistic model indicated no factors were significant of evaluation trait averages. The chi-square tests showed a difference in level of physical demands in three different modes of operations for both BMs and DCs. Both groups support the use of a physical ability testing in the selection process for job placement. Efforts to develop a physical ability test for use in the selection process, a physical remediation program {{for those who do not}} meet the standards, as well as a maintenance program to verify personnel still meet physical abilities are recommendations that should be considered for future research.

40|$|This {{research}} was conducted in association with Naval Warfare Development Command (NWDC) requests to update Unmanned Vehicle Tactical Memorandum TM- 3 - 22 - 5 -SW. The research identified and discussed significant USV manning considerations such as source ratings and manpower qualities to pilot, operate sensors, support USV electronics, and the manpower implications associated with various weapons systems alternatives. In addition, this research described several existing and notional USV tactics, {{as well as a}} discussion about the existing N 75 and N 76 primary and secondary mission areas USV operations may support. The methodology consisted of a literature review of USV test reports; USV Advanced Concept Technology Demonstration briefs; USV Concept of Operations; fleet lessons learned; the USV tactical memorandum; Naval manpower instructions, and manuals; Weapons Tactical, Field, and Training Manuals; Military Utility Assessments; search of books, magazines, and manpower theses. The research found that determining manpower qualities and standard operating procedures will remain a dynamic process until USV equipment is standardized. The research also showed USV launch and recovery is more manpower intensive than that of a standard RHIB. Gunners Mates (GM) and Aviation Ordnancemen (AO) are potential source ratings to support USV Hellfire and Javelin missile modules. The Navy should establish a GM Navy Enlisted Classification (NEC) to support Hellfire and Javelin or add these weapons to existing GM NECs. Electronics Technicians (ET), Fire <b>Controlmen</b> (FC), and Fire Control Technicians (FT) are potential source ratings for USV electrical/electronic support. FC and FT are potential source ratings to support the Remote Operated Small Arms Mount. This research found additional warfighting capabilities can be gained by equipping surface warfare vessels with USV's without any negative effects to primary or secondary warfare missions. Overall, USVs enhanced designed capabilities of Naval warships and directly support a capabilities based Navy...|$|R

5000|$|In 1985 {{the name}} of this naval rating has changed back to fire <b>controlman.</b> This allowed for the {{separation}} of the submarine rate [...] "fire control technician" [...] from the surface rate [...] "fire controlman". Fire <b>controlman</b> was the original name of the rate through World War II when optic devices called rangefinders were used. After World War II, when the duties expanded into greater use of electronics, such as tracking radars and computers, the name was changed to fire control technician. The fire control technician name is now used exclusively for fire control personnel on submarines. The fire <b>controlman</b> rating insignia is a coincidence or stereoscopic rangefinder, with two lightning bolts (called [...] "sparks") signifying the technical side. Until 1985 it had always been just the rangefinder without the lightning bolts.|$|E
