5|$|Dysprosium is used, in {{conjunction}} with vanadium and other elements, in making laser materials and commercial lighting. Because of dysprosium's high thermal-neutron absorption cross-section, dysprosium-oxide–nickel <b>cermets</b> are used in neutron-absorbing control rods in nuclear reactors. Dysprosium–cadmium chalcogenides are sources of infrared radiation, which is useful for studying chemical reactions. Because dysprosium and its compounds are highly susceptible to magnetization, they are employed in various data-storage applications, such as in hard disks. Dysprosium is increasingly in demand for the permanent magnets used in electric car motors and wind turbine generators.|$|E

40|$|New <b>cermet</b> (ceramic-metal) {{composite}} coatings {{have been}} developed for solar absorbers in a solar concentrating system for combined heat and power operating in a mid-temperature range between 250 to 350 degrees C. The coatings were applied on stainless steel substrates. Two types of <b>cermet</b> with expected good duration properties were chosen: Nb-TiO 2 and W-SiO 2. The basic layer-structure concept consisted of four sub-layers, counted from the substrate: molybdenum infrared reflector, high metal concentration <b>cermet</b> of either Nb-TiO 2 or W-SiO 2, low metal concentration <b>cermet</b> of either Nb-TiO 2 or W-SiO 2 and SiO 2 antireflection layer. The results from optimised coating fabrication gave solar absorptance and thermal emittance of 0. 93 and 0. 09 respectively for the Nb-TiO 2 <b>cermet</b> and 0. 91 and 0. 08 for the W-SiO 2 <b>cermet</b> based absorbers.
