25|$|Engine 127's 1965 Crown, {{one of the}} two {{originally}} {{used for}} the show, was later refitted with a <b>closed</b> <b>cab.</b> Eventually it was placed into reserve status when Station 127 received a new engine. In its reserve capacity, it was serving temporarily as Engine 95 when it was involved in a collision. Damaged beyond repair in the collision, it was salvaged for parts and sold as scrap. The County of Los Angeles Fire Museum Association now owns and has restored the 1965 Crown which formerly served as Engine 60 at Universal Studios and appeared most often as the Crown version of Engine 51.|$|E

6000|$|The {{moment he}} started on his drive, I hired a <b>closed</b> <b>cab.</b> [...] "Double your fare," [...] I {{said to the}} driver, [...] "whatever it may be, if you follow that chaise cleverly, and do what I tell you." ...|$|E
5000|$|All of the 1940 designs had {{commercial}} type <b>closed</b> <b>cabs</b> {{with minor}} modifications. Variants had an open passenger roof so a ring for a [...]50 caliber machine gun could be mounted, during World War II approximately {{one in four}} trucks had a ring. In 1942, to simplify production and reduce shipping height, all manufacturers began to use military style open cabs. Studebaker returned to <b>closed</b> <b>cabs.</b> The post-war M35 and M135 were designed with open cabs and half-doors. All military cabs could mount a machine gun ring. The M35 and M135 had removable hard tops available.|$|R
60|$|The {{great point}} was now to avoid meeting Gildersleeve before the ship sailed. So {{he would pay}} his bill quietly, put his things in his portmanteau, stop in his room till dusk, and then drive off in a <b>close</b> <b>cab</b> to the landing-stage.|$|R
60|$|When I {{arrived at}} Fraunheim, I found my alert American punctually there before me. He raised his crush hat with awkward politeness. I {{could see he}} was little {{accustomed}} to ladies' society. Then he pointed to a <b>close</b> <b>cab</b> in which he had reached the village.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, you see, {{he had all}} his {{plant for}} making the notes in that bag. If he were to lock himself up in his lodging several hours a day it would soon set people wondering, {{to say nothing of}} the chance of eyes at the window or key-hole. Again, you see, if he took a house all on his own hook, without servant nor anyone, it would look queer. So he made up his mind as the best way of working it was to carry it on in a <b>closed</b> <b>cab,</b> and I don't know that he wasn't right. He was known to the police however, and that was how they spotted him. Drat that van! It was as near as a touch to my off-wheel.|$|E
60|$|Thenceforward, he sat all {{day over}} {{the fire in the}} private room, gnawing his nails; there he dined, sitting alone with his fears, the waiter visibly quailing before his eye; and then, when the night was fully come, he set forth in the corner of a <b>closed</b> <b>cab,</b> and was driven to and fro about the streets of the city. He, I say--I cannot say, I. That child of Hell had nothing human; nothing lived in him but fear and hatred. And when at last, {{thinking}} the driver had begun to grow suspicious, he discharged the cab and ventured on foot, attired in his misfitting clothes, an object marked out for observation, into the midst of the nocturnal passengers, these two base passions raged within him like a tempest. He walked fast, hunted by his fears, chattering to himself, skulking through the less frequented thoroughfares, counting the minutes that still divided him from midnight. Once a woman spoke to him, offering, I think, a box of lights. He smote her in the face, and she fled.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Exactly,' said Merton. 'This affair is {{very well}} organised. Your house is {{probably}} being observed. Now what I propose is this. I can go nowhere dressed as I am. You will, if you please, first send a constable, in uniform, to your house with orders to wait till you return. Next, I shall dress, by your permission, in any spare uniform you may have here and in that costume I shall leave this office and accompany you to your house in a <b>closed</b> <b>cab.</b> You will enter it, bring out a hat and cloak, come into the cab, and I shall put them on, leaving my policeman's helmet in the cab, which will wait. Then, minutes later, the constable will come out, take the cab, and drive to any police office you please. Once within your house, I shall exchange my uniform for any old evening suit {{you may be able}} to lend me, and, when your guests have departed, you and I will drive together to Professor Lumley's, where he will identify me. After that, my course is perfectly clear, and I need give you no further trouble.' ...|$|E

50|$|After World War I, several {{advances}} were made: pneumatic tires {{replaced the}} previously common full rubber versions. Electric starters, power brakes, 4, 6, and 8 cylinder engines, <b>closed</b> <b>cabs,</b> and electric lighting followed. The first modern semi-trailer trucks also appeared. Touring car builders such as Ford and Renault entered the heavy truck market.|$|R
50|$|In 1912, Avery added 2 ST and 3 ST {{trucks with}} solid rubber tires. <b>Closed</b> <b>cabs</b> were added a year later, and in 1917 they {{introduced}} a cab-over-engine design featuring an enclosed chain drive. The style of Avery trucks became more conventional, {{but the new}} six-cylinder model introduced in 1921 didn't last long because within five years the company was bankrupt.|$|R
60|$|Thereupon, I {{arranged}} {{my clothes}} as best I could, and summoning a passing hansom, drove to an hotel in Portland Street, {{the name of}} which I chanced to remember. At my appearance (which was indeed comical enough, however tragic a fate these garments covered) the driver could not conceal his mirth. I gnashed my teeth upon him with a gust of devilish fury; and the smile withered from his face--happily for him--yet more happily for myself, for in another instant I had certainly dragged him from his perch. At the inn, as I entered, I looked about me with so black a countenance as made the attendants tremble; not a look did they exchange in my presence; but obsequiously took my orders, {{led me to a}} private room, and brought me wherewithal to write. Hyde in danger of his life was a creature new to me; shaken with inordinate anger, strung to the pitch of murder, lusting to inflict pain. Yet the creature was astute; mastered his fury with a great effort of the will; composed his two important letters, one to Lanyon and one to Poole; and that he might receive actual evidence of their being posted, sent them out with directions that they should be registered. Thenceforward, he sat all day over the fire in the private room, gnawing his nails; there he dined, sitting alone with his fears, the waiter visibly quailing before his eye; and thence, when the night was fully come, he set forth in the corner of a <b>closed</b> <b>cab,</b> and was driven to and fro about the streets of the city. He, I say--I cannot say, I. That child of Hell had nothing human; nothing lived in him but fear and hatred.

6000|$|On deck, the Colonel, {{laden with}} bags, was looking back for her, {{and trying to}} keep a space between him and his wife. He signalled with his chin. Threading her way towards him, she {{happened}} to look up. By the rails of the pier above she saw her husband. He was leaning there, looking intently down; his tall broad figure made the people on each side of him seem insignificant. The clean-shaved, square-cut face, with those almost epileptic, forceful eyes, had a stillness and intensity beside which the neighbouring faces seemed to disappear. She saw him very clearly, even noting the touch of silver in his dark hair, on each side under his straw hat; noting that he seemed too massive for his neat blue suit. His face relaxed; he made a little movement of one hand. Suddenly it shot through her: Suppose Mark had travelled with them, as he had wished to do? For ever and ever now, that dark massive creature, smiling down at her, was her enemy; from whom she must guard and keep herself if she could; keep, at all events, each one of her real thoughts and hopes! She could have writhed, and cried out; instead, she tightened her grip on the handle of her bag, and smiled. Though so skilled in knowledge of his moods, she felt, in his greeting, his fierce grip of her shoulders, the smouldering of some feeling the nature of which she could not quite fathom. His voice had a grim sincerity: [...] "Glad you're back--thought you were never coming!" [...] Resigned to his charge, a feeling of sheer physical faintness so beset her that she could hardly reach the compartment he had reserved. It seemed to her that, for all her foreboding, she had not till this moment had the smallest inkling of what was now before her; and at his muttered: [...] "Must we have the old fossils in?" [...] she looked back to assure herself that her Uncle and Aunt were following. To avoid having to talk, she feigned to have travelled badly, leaning back with closed eyes, in her corner. If only she could open them and see, not this square-jawed face with its intent gaze of possession, but that other with its eager eyes humbly adoring her. The interminable journey ended all too soon. She clung quite desperately to the Colonel's hand on the platform at Charing Cross. When his kind face vanished she would be lost indeed! Then, in the <b>closed</b> <b>cab,</b> she heard her husband's: [...] "Aren't you going to kiss me?" [...] and submitted to his embrace.|$|E

50|$|The AFKWX (A for 1939, F for forward cab, K for all wheel drive, and W for tandem rear axles) 353, a {{cab over engine}} {{cargo bed}} version of the CCKW, went into {{production}} alongside it in 1942 at Yellow’s Pontiac plant and Chevrolet’s in St. Louis. Otherwise mechanically identical, its compact cabin design allowed a 15 ft, and later 17 ft cargo bed to be fitted. The first 50 produced had <b>closed</b> <b>cabs,</b> all others were open. The cab over design made engine maintenance difficult. As a result, only 7235 were built, none with a front-mounted winch.|$|R

50|$|The initial Unimog 2010 {{was offered}} as a Cabrio with a {{foldable}} top, a conceiling windscreen, removable side windows and a rigid rear panel. It was availbe in the colour Unimog-grün. After the re-badging, the <b>closed</b> <b>cab</b> was offered. The Cabrio version was now called Version A while the cab-version was called Version A/F. Unimogs with a trailer-brake-system were called Version B and Version B/F. Unimogs with a <b>closed</b> <b>cab</b> were available in the paint colours Unimog-grün, hellgrau and Mercedes-blau.|$|E
50|$|The cab was {{manufactured}} {{in several different}} versions, such as a <b>closed</b> <b>cab,</b> cab with long cab (crew cabin with fire engines), cab with soft top and a cab with fold-down windshield.|$|E
50|$|In {{order to}} replace steam on the {{numerous}} light rail branches {{operated by the}} Nacionales de Mexico (NdeM), EMD export models G12 and G16 were obtained. A total of 24 G16 units were built by EMD for the NdeM, all equipped with dynamic brakes and introduced between 08/1958 and 07/1960, their running numbers being 7300 to 7323. The first 13 units (Nr. 7300 to 7312) had <b>close</b> clearance <b>cabs,</b> the last 11 units (Nr. 7313 to 7323) were delivered in 1960 and received a standard cab. Nr.7323 was pictured in 1963 with a standard cab, but appeared in 1974 with a <b>close</b> clearance <b>cab,</b> indicating that this unit was either rebuilt or more probably renumbered.|$|R
50|$|Almost all G506s had a <b>closed</b> Chevrolet <b>cab,</b> {{except for}} three models. A panel van version {{was built for}} the signal corps, an open cab was used on Bomb servicers and a cab over engine type was used for long bodied cargo trucks.|$|R

50|$|Another less notable change, was {{the vehicle}} portraying Jones' butcher's van. In the series, the van was a 1935 Ford BB (still {{registered}} as BUC852), whereas a <b>closed</b> <b>cab</b> Ford Model AA {{was used for}} the film.|$|E

40|$|Sclerotinia sclerotiorum is an {{emerging}} fungal pathogen affecting soybeans in the United States. In response to its emergence, exposures to particulates, bioaerosols, endotoxins, S. sclerotiorum, and beta(1 - 3) -glucans were characterized during soybean harvesting. Air sampling {{was performed on}} soybean harvesters (combines) and on the farmers in <b>closed</b> <b>cabs</b> as personal samples during harvesting at 17 farms in 1997 and repeated at 15 in 1998. S. sclerotiorum infestation {{was evident in the}} fields at 8 of the sites (44 %). The geometric mean concentrations (and geometric standard deviations) measured on the combines in 1998 were as follows: total dust, 11. 9 (2. 8) mg/m(3); inhalable dust 11. 7 (6. 4) mg/m(3); and beta(1 - 3) -glucans, 5027 (7) ng/m(3). Values for the personal samples in 1998 were as follows: total dust, 1. 2 (6. 7) mg/m(3); inhalable dust, 1. 1 (5. 3); and beta(1 - 3) -glucans, 674 (9) ng/m(3). These concentrations were two- to threefold higher than in the previous year. Ambient endotoxin concentrations were 4438 EU/m(3) in Year I and 459 EU/m(3) in Year II. Particle size distribution measurements on the combines yielded mass median aerodynamic diameters of 6. 6 microm on the combine and 4. 0 microm inside the combine <b>cab.</b> <b>Closed</b> combine <b>cabs</b> provided an average workplace protection factor of 11. 7 for total dust. Nevertheless, personal exposures to organisms inside combine cabins ranged from 3. 6 x 10 (4) to 4. 0 x 10 (8) organisms/m(3). These data indicate the potential exists for high exposures to organic dust and bioaerosols during soybean harvesting...|$|R
5000|$|... 12 R-XIII's were {{converted}} to blind flying trainers R-XIIIt in 1934, with higher <b>closed</b> trainee <b>cab.</b> Some {{were converted}} to simple liaison aircraft, removig armament and mounting a windscreen in the second cab. Several R-XIII were used to tow gliders, using a special frame with a hook, attached to a fuselage.|$|R
50|$|Early trucks used a {{commercial}} style <b>closed</b> <b>cab,</b> in December 1942 an open military style cab entered production. The Soviet Union preferred the closed cabs for their extreme weather, so in March 1943 the open cabs were discontinued, after only about 10,000 were built.|$|E
5000|$|In the Flexity {{vehicles}} {{the operator}} is {{not responsible for}} fare collection and normally does not provide paper transfers to passengers, since the operator sits inside a <b>closed</b> <b>cab.</b> As such, a proof-of-payment (POP) system is used at all times (this applies on all TTC streetcar routes across the network).|$|E
50|$|A {{ladder frame}} had two live beam axles on leaf springs with a 155 in wheelbase. There was a 15,000 lb winch {{behind the front}} bumper and a pintle hitch at the rear. A {{civilian}} type <b>closed</b> <b>cab</b> was used, right behind the cab was an open cargo box used to carry engineer tools, outboard motors, and other equipment.|$|E
25|$|In 1939-1941 the Army Ordnance Corps was {{developing}} a complete line of tactical trucks that could operate over all roads and cross-country terrain in all weather. A 6-ton (5,400kg) payload rated 6×6 truck to tow anti-aircraft artillery was needed. Corbitt, {{a small company}} who had sold the US Army trucks since 1917, began delivering 200 prototypes in 1940. In 1941 their improved Model 50SD6, with a larger engine and different hood and fenders, was standardized and went into production. Shortly after White began building them, {{they would be the}} largest producer. Brockway began in 1942, and FWD in 1945. Ward LaFrance also built the chassis. Seven body types were built, some by more than one manufacturer. All manufacturer’s models were virtually identical, with very minor variations. Early models had <b>closed</b> <b>cabs</b> with full doors, in 1942 open cabs with half doors were introduced.|$|R
50|$|In the USSR, {{just like}} in the DDR there were networks, which {{permitted}} a maximum width of vehicle of 2.20 m. Since those were too narrow for T3 and the factory in Gotha stopped its production, the T4s was sold as T4SU to the Soviet Union. Like the other CSU types, a <b>closed</b> operator's <b>cab</b> was included. No trailer cars were used.|$|R
60|$|For all {{the street}} silence {{there seemed to}} be a great deal of noise, which I suppose came from the click of boots on the {{sidewalks}} and of hoofs in roadways and the grind and squeal of the trams, with the harsh smiting of the unrubbered tires of the <b>closed</b> <b>cabs</b> on the rough granite blocks of the streets. But there are asphalted streets in Madrid where the sound of the hoofs and wheels is subdued, and the streets rough and smooth are kept of a cleanliness which would put the streets of New York to shame if anything could. Ordinarily you could get cabs anywhere, but if you wanted one very badly, when remote from a stand, there was more than one chance that a cab marked Libre would pass you with lordly indifference. As for motor taxi-cabs there are none in the city, and at Cook's they would not take the responsibility of recommending any automobiles for country excursions.|$|R
