40|$|In many {{developing}} countries a close linkage exists between drinking and irrigation water; however, the effects of irrigation management on drinking water availability and quality, and what drinking water supplies are best suited to irrigated areas, have been little studied. Bacterial contamination and salinity of drinking water sources in a community within the Uda Walawe irrigation system of southern Sri Lanka were monitored from August to December 2000. Water with the lowest combination of faecal contamination and salt content (highest quality) was found in shallow wells, recharged with seepage water from the irrigation system. Of these wells, those surrounded by a protective wall had the lowest levels of thermotolerant coliforms (median of 244 ThCU 100 ml- 1) as compared to shallow wells without protective walls (549 ThCU 100 ml- 1). Furthermore, tube well waters were highly saline (average of 0. 67 mS cm- 1), while canal and reservoir waters had high thermotolerant coliform levels (3940 and 950 ThCU 100 ml- 1).

40|$|Surgery that {{eliminates}} the open radical cavity takes three forms: obliteration (cavity fill-in, reconstruction (canal wall defect repair), or ablation (external <b>canal</b> <b>closure).</b> The evolution of each variety is reviewed in detail {{and a personal}} series of 240 cases is discussed. These included obliterations and reconstructions using organic materials, then reconstructions employing porous hydroxylapatite ceramic implants. Larger defects required Grote implants, but high facial ridge cases were managed with attic defect plates and limited canalplasty. Canal repair success rates improved {{with the use of}} the middle temporal flap to improve canal wall vascularity. Residual cholesteatoma has been prevented by staged surgery, and recurrent disease has been virtually abolished by aggressive prevention techniques which employ drum reinforcement with finely shaven cartilage-perichondrium composite grafts.

In addition, a landslide breached a diversion canal downstream of the J. C. Boyle dam and caused secondary erosion and sedimentation in the “bypass” reach of the Klamath River. The peak flows and landslide may have influenced fish habitat and river geomorphology. I updated existing flood frequency analyses for four gauges in the upper Klamath River basin using new annual peak streamflow data.

I also identified differences in flood frequency estimates based on the method used to analyze annual peak streamflow data. I evaluated the effects of the December 2005 landslide that breached the canal feeding water to the JC Boyle powerplant. The landslide deposited sediment in the Klamath River and the subsequent closure of the canal resulted in increased flows in the river.

40|$|Objective: To {{report and}} review 32 cases of {{subtotal}} petrosectomy (SP) in cochlear implant (CI) surgery and to define the indications and contraindications for this procedure Study Design: Retrospective case review + case reports. Setting: Tertiary skull base center. Patients: Cochlear implant database: 32 subtotal petrosectomies in 31 patients. Interventions: Subtotal petrosectomy with blind sac closure of the external auditory <b>canal,</b> <b>closure</b> of Eustachian tube, and abdominal fat obliteration in combination with cochlear implantation. Results: Indications for SP in CI surgery were as follows: chronic otitis media (n = 4), previous radical cavity (n = 13), previous subtotal petrosectomy (n = 4), ossification of the cochlea (n = 5), malformation of the inner ear (n = 2), and temporal bone fracture (n = 4). One patient was simultaneously bilaterally implanted; 2 cases were revisions. All procedures were performed in 1 stage. In 2 cases, complications were encountered (6 %), one of which lead to reoperation (3 %). None of the patients was explanted. Conclusion: Subtotal petrosectomy combined with cochlear implantation is a procedure required in specific situations and lowers the risk of repetitive ear infections, CSF leakage, and meningitis by closing off all connection with the external environment. Additionally, it gives excellent visibility and access in difficult anatomy or in drill-out procedures. The complication rate of 6 % is comparable with normal cochlear implantation. Preservation of residual hearing can be considered the only absolute contraindication as an open external meatus is necessary for use of electroacoustic stimulation. Risks of the SP+CI procedure are infection of the abdominal fat, breakdown of the blind sac closure, and entrapped cholesteatoma. Follow-up with CT imaging is therefore mandatory...|$|E

Due to the well-known multi-organ affection with significant implication {{on the lives of}} patients and their families, abortion after prenatal diagnosis became reality {{in most parts of the}} world. After publication of the Management of Myelomeningocele Study (MOMS) results fetal surgery seems to be a new option and a broad discussion arose regarding advantages and risks of in utero treatment of spina bifida. This paper tries to evaluate objectively the actual state of knowledge and experience. This review article gives a historical overview as well as the experimental and pathophysiological background of fetal surgery in open spinal dysraphism. Additionally clinical follow-up experience of foetoscopically treated patients are presented and discussed. After carefully outweighing all available information on fetal surgery for spina bifida, one has to conclude, in accordance with the MOMS investigators, that in utero surgery cannot be considered a standard option at present time. But there is clear evidence of the hypothesis that early closure of the spinal canal has a positive influence on spinal cord function and severity of Chiari malformation type II, has been proven. A persisting problem is the fetal risk of prematurity and the maternal risk of uterus damage. There is also evidence that due to technical restrictions, fetal closure of the spinal canal bears unsolved problems leading to a higher postnatal incidence of complication surgery. Finally, missing long-term results make a definite evaluation impossible so far. At the moment, fetal surgery in open spinal dysraphism is not a standard of care despite promising results regarding central nervous system protection due to early spinal <b>canal</b> <b>closure.</b> Many technical problems need to be solved in the future in order to make this option a safe and standard one...|$|E

40|$|THE SEARCH for {{a simple}} secure method for the repair of {{indirect}} hernia continues. In 1899 Kocher (Kocher, 1903) introduced displacement of the invaginated neck of the sac lateral to the inferior epigastric vessels. This method never achieved the popularity of that suggested by Bassini but has been practised by various surgeons; C. J. A. Woodside of Belfast used it throughout his surgical career and claimed, but never published, excellent results. In 1964 Celestin published a modification of the Kocher method which had been used by Grant-Batchelor for at least 10 years. This consists of isolation of the sac up to, but not including, the internal ring, not disturbing the natural adhesions between the fascia transversalis and peritoneum (Fig. 1). The sac is FIG. 1. Isolation of the hernial sac up to the internal inguinal ring. 148 invaginated and brought out through the parietes {{in the vicinity of}} the anterior iliac spine. It is twisted, thereby tightening the posterior wall of the <b>canal,</b> and after <b>closure</b> of the small opening in the peritoneum around the twisted sac, the latter is anchored to the oblique muscles (Fig. 2). The reported results were excellent: 5. 4 per cent recurrence rate in 212 patients with 88. 5 per cent recall at 5 to 9 years after operation; if those over 70 years of age were excluded the failure rate dropped to 4 per cent. The method was recommended for routine use in all adult cases below the age of 70 years. In 1964 the senior of the present authors, after satisfying himself that the method appeared to give a secure repair, started using it routinely in patients under the age of 70 years. In 1967, after 37 operations, the trial was discontinued because it was obvious that the recurrence rate was unacceptable.

40|$|The {{positively}} charged S 4 transmembrane segment of voltage-gated channels {{is thought to}} function as the voltage sensor by moving charge through the membrane electric field in response to depolarization. Here we studied S 4 movements in the mammalian HCN pacemaker channels. Unlike most voltage-gated channel family members that are activated by depolarization, HCN channels are activated by hyperpolarization. We determined the reactivity of the charged sulfhydryl-modifying reagent, MTSET, with substituted cysteine (Cys) residues along the HCN 1 S 4 segment. Using an HCN 1 channel engineered to be MTS resistant except for the chosen S 4 Cys substitution, we determined the reactivity of 12 S 4 residues to external or internal MTSET application in either the closed or open state of the channel. Cys substitutions in the NH 2 -terminal half of S 4 only reacted with external MTSET; the rates of reactivity were rapid, {{regardless of whether the}} channel was open or closed. In contrast, Cys substitutions in the COOH-terminal half of S 4 selectively reacted with internal MTSET when the channel was open. In the open state, the boundary between externally and internally accessible residues was remarkably narrow (∼ 3 residues). This suggests that S 4 lies in a water-filled gating canal with a very narrow barrier between the external and internal solutions, similar to depolarization-gated channels. However, the pattern of reactivity is incompatible with either classical gating models, which postulate a large translational or rotational movement of S 4 within a gating canal, or with a recent model in which S 4 forms a peripheral voltage-sensing paddle (with S 3 b) that moves within the lipid bilayer (the KvAP model). Rather, we suggest that voltage sensing is due to a rearrangement in transmembrane segments surrounding S 4, leading to a collapse of an internal gating <b>canal</b> upon channel <b>closure</b> that alters the shape of the membrane field around a relatively static S 4 segment...|$|R
5000|$|There are arguably {{inaccuracies}} {{with the}} Black Country Society geographical definition - {{first of all}} the thick coal seam was mined at some Wolverhampton collieries though {{not in the same}} quantity as some others - again Jukes and Murchison confirm this. Newspaper adverts from the Staffordshire Advertiser highlight that Chillington, Stow Heath, Rough Hills, Fighting Cocks, Parkfield, Ettingshall, Hill Park (Monmore Green), Cockshutts, and the Wolverhampton Colliery all brought up the thick coal. Of greater significance potentially {{is the fact that the}} 1800s statements of Samuel Sidney, Joseph Beete Jukes, Samuel Griffiths, William White, John Bartholomew, Walter White, Elihu Burritt, and of course Reverend William Gresley all confirm that the true, original Black Country (from around 1830-40 when the term 'Black Country' was first used) was perceived to be larger than that restricted area defined 'only by the existence of the thick coal seam'. Gresley for instance said the Black Country was 20 miles in length, Jukes meanwhile defined the Black Country based on the ironstone tract of the coalfield as that determined where the great iron works developed. Griffiths placed more emphasis on the iron industry in defining the Black Country. Furthermore, all the above considered Wolverhampton to be a key Black Country town, and Griffiths (Bilston born to West Bromwich parents) stated that: - [...] "Wolverhampton was considered to be Capital of the Black Country". Gresley stated that the 'original Black Country' was named after an area of Staffordshire, which naturally excludes Dudley as it lay in Worcestershire. Walter White , like so many others, viewed the Black Country from the elevated position of Dudley Castle, and noted the greatest concentration of smoke to lie over Wolverhampton. Inadvertently, it appears that the Black Country Society, formed from the Dudley <b>Canal</b> Tunnel <b>Closure</b> Group in 1967, seem to have adapted, perhaps understandably, a Dudley-centric view of the Black Country. But newspaper archives (www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk) reveal that Wolverhampton was indeed widely considered both the 'Capital, and Metropolis of the Black Country' throughout the 1800s. A phrase search for 'Capital of the Black Country' between 1750-1950 returns 77 references in favour of Wolverhampton, 30 in favour of Birmingham, only 2 in favour of Dudley. Wolverhampton was also considered 'Capital of the Iron Trade in the Black Country' according to Griffiths, a man primed with local knowledge. These 'newspaper archive' figures highlight a potential problem for Dudley - the great bulk of the Black Country lay in Staffordshire - Wolverhampton, Walsall, Bilston, Wednesbury, Darlaston, Willenhall, Tipton, West Bromwich, with the town of Dudley lying in Worcestershire. This was at a time when County status was important to people, so although Dudley was centrally located, it struggled naturally, to be perceived as Capital of a district which primarily lay in a neighbouring County. Of course, a meritorious re-assessment has taken place in recent times, which seems to have awarded Dudley 'Capital' status, as the whole Black Country now lies within the unifying West Midlands County. But you cannot change history. There is arguably an anti-Wolverhampton agenda in some quarters, with what might well be described as a misrepresentation of Black Country history. The thick coal seam was clearly an important feature of the Black Country but it evidently did not in isolation, define the Black Country. Most of the thick coal was sold to the domestic market, whilst ironically the great iron works depended mainly on thinner seams to fuel their furnaces as most of the thick coal was too crystalline for use there. The Black Country Society exclude Wolverhampton from the Black Country as it alleges that it had no coal-mines where coal outcropped, nor had thick coal in its mines, but both these facts evidently, are plainly wrong, and therefore constitute misinformation which should be corrected on its website. I have written to them about this, and I am hopeful that this will be corrected. There are also potential issues with including within the original Black Country, districts where the deeper, concealed seam was mined after 1870, and progressively thereafter. These deeper mining operations occurred at sites around the edge of the original Black Country - Sandwell Park, Baggeridge for instance. The original Black Country was characterised by relatively shallow mines that gave it its pitted landscape, and these later operations merely constitute a continuation of the mining industry, but arguably in no way define the original Black Country. It seems bizarre, or contrived even, that the Black Country Society include such later geographical areas within its borders, yet it excludes Wolverhampton on geological grounds when the eastern side of town, abutting immediately adjacent to its town centre, was littered with shallow coal-mines, as well as huge iron works, from the early 1800s onwards - perhaps further evidence of an ant-Wolverhampton agenda? ...|$|R
