50|$|Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies {{cartoons}} {{were each}} assigned identification numbers that would appear directly on title cards {{shown at the}} beginning of each short. These numbers included cartoon studio production numbers, Vitaphone release numbers, Blue Ribbon re-release <b>numbers,</b> and MPAA <b>certificate</b> <b>numbers.</b> Not all of these types of numbers were listed in the title cards of every cartoon and the numbering schemes were sometimes inconsistent. For example, until 1943 cartoons listed Vitaphone release numbers but not cartoon studio production numbers. These release numbers, in turn, increased to 9999 but then restarted at 1. Complicating matters was the Warner Bros. Blue Ribbon re-release program, in which some cartoons were re-released in theaters with new title cards that often removed original production credits and substituted production or release numbers with new re-release numbers. In many cases, the Blue Ribbon releases are the only available prints of a cartoon, making it challenging to discern these cartoons' correct original production information.|$|R
