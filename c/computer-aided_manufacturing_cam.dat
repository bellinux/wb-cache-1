50|$|Non-uniform {{rational}} basis spline (NURBS) is {{a mathematical}} model commonly used in computer graphics for generating and representing curves and surfaces. It offers great flexibility and precision for handling both analytic (surfaces defined by common mathematical formulae) and modeled shapes. NURBS are commonly used in <b>computer-aided</b> design (CAD), <b>manufacturing</b> (<b>CAM),</b> and engineering (CAE) and are part of numerous industry wide standards, such as IGES, STEP, ACIS, and PHIGS. NURBS tools are also found in various 3D modeling and animation software packages.|$|R
40|$|NURBS(Non Uniform Rational B-Splines) {{are nearly}} {{ubiquitous}} for <b>computer-aided</b> design (CAD), <b>manufacturing</b> (<b>CAM),</b> and 3 D modelers {{and part of}} numerous industry wide 3 D data exchange standards such as IGES and STEP. With a rapidly growing hardware system, NURBS is getting more attentions in real-time systems or 3 D games. In this new trend, the biggest obstacle is that tessellating NURBS into triangles is still slower than loading pre-triangulated data. However NURBS can give lots of freedom to 3 D application developers such as unlimited control over LOD (Level of Detail) or high rendering quality to the curved surface. In this project, geometry shader is used to tessellate and render curves and surfaces. The benefits of using geometry shader are to reduce the rendering data transferring from CPU to GPU as well as tessellate and render curves and surfaces as a parallel process. 1. INTROUDUCTION 1. 1. Technology A geometry shader can generate new primitives from existing primitives like pixels, lines and triangles. It is executed after vertex shader and its input is the whole primitive or primitive with adjacency information. Then it can emit zero or more primitives, which are rasterized and their fragments passed to fragment shader. With the input of control vertices and other information such as number of input control vertices, geometry shader can generate line or triangle primitives to render Bezier, B-Spline or NURBS curves and surfaces...|$|R
