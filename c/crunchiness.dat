50|$|Crispiness or {{crispness}} is the {{gustatory sensation}} of brittleness in the mouth, {{such that the}} food item shatters immediately upon mastication. Crispiness differs from <b>crunchiness</b> in that a crunchy food continues to provide its material sensation after a few chews. On the other hand, a crispy food quickly loses the 'taut' equilibrium of its material, such as a tightly wrapped sausage.|$|E

50|$|An Afghan biscuit is a {{traditional}} New Zealand biscuit made from flour, butter, cornflakes, sugar and cocoa powder, topped with chocolate icing and a half walnut. The recipe has {{a high proportion of}} butter, and relatively low sugar, and no leavening (rising agent), giving it a soft, dense and rich texture, with <b>crunchiness</b> from the cornflakes, rather than from a high sugar content. The high butter content gives a soft melt-in-the-mouth texture, and the sweetness of the icing offsets the low sugar and the cocoa bitterness. The origin of the recipe and the derivation of the name are unknown, but the recipe has appeared in many editions of the influential New Zealand Edmonds Cookery Book.|$|E
50|$|Control of {{moisture}} in products {{can be a}} vital part of the process of the product. There is a substantial amount {{of moisture}} in what seems to be dry matter. Ranging in products from cornflake cereals to washing powders, moisture can play an important role in the final quality of the product. There are two main aspects of concern in moisture control in products: allowing too much moisture or too little of it. For example, adding some water to cornflake cereal, which is sold by weight, reduces costs and prevents it from tasting too dry, but adding too much water can affect the <b>crunchiness</b> of the cereal and the freshness because water content contributes to bacteria growth. Water content of some foods is also manipulated to reduce the number of calories.|$|E
50|$|Pasta and chickpeas are {{the primary}} {{ingredients}} in Ciceri e Tria. Some versions of the dish may have {{a significant amount of}} broth, which may be eaten using a spoon. Some of the pasta (from one-third to one-half) is fried in oil as part of its preparation, while the rest of it is boiled. The use of fried pasta was originally performed to create a quality or mouthfeel of meatiness in the dish during times of meat scarcity. The fried pasta may also add <b>crunchiness</b> to the dish. Apulian versions may involve the chickpeas being simmered over a low heat while fresh pasta is being prepared. Dried/uncooked chickpeas may be soaked one day prior to preparation of the dish. Additional ingredients may include onion, carrot, celery and garlic. It may be seasoned with black pepper. It has been described as having a bacon-like flavor. It may be served as a side dish with bread or rice.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Vacuum {{impregnation}} {{is seen as}} {{a valuable}} technique for flavor pairing in the catering industry. One of the applications of this technique is the creation of edible cocktails by impregnating fruits with liquors, leading to an interplay of different flavors. However, the effect of the impregnation of sugar and alcohol into the fruit will affect the texture of the fruit and therefore its <b>crunchiness.</b> Thus, the positive effect of flavor pairing might be inhibited by a negative effect in texture changes. Results This investigation focused on the change in <b>crunchiness</b> {{as a result of the}} impregnation of different sugar and alcohol containing solutions. When hypotonic solutions were used, the impregnation resulted in the rupture of the cells, thereby leading to a decrease in <b>crunchiness.</b> When hypertonic solutions were used, the cells shrunk, which also resulted in a decrease in <b>crunchiness.</b> Isotonic solutions resulted in <b>crunchiness</b> comparable to its fresh version. When alcohol was used, the <b>crunchiness</b> decreased at all concentrations investigated. Conclusions <b>Crunchiness</b> of fruit can only be maintained when impregnated with isotonic sugar solutions. When the sugar or alcohol content deviates from that in the fruit, impregnation of these liquids will lead to a decrease in <b>crunchiness.</b> This has consequences for the creation of edible cocktails: for an optimal <b>crunchiness,</b> the sugar content of the impregnation liquid has to be equal to the sugar content of the fruit or vegetable. </p...|$|E
40|$|Background and Aims: The {{instrumental}} {{measurement of}} <b>crunchiness</b> in tablegrapes {{has been the}} subject of little research in spite of the great relevance of this sensory texture trait to consumer preference. Therefore, our aim was to evaluate the potential of several mechanical and acoustic properties to assess the perceived firmness and <b>crunchiness</b> of tablegrape cultivars. Methods and Results: The ripening effect was minimised by densimetric sorting of the berries before testing. The textural quality of seven tablegrape cultivars was evaluated by sensory analysis. Furthermore, three mechanical tests (texture profile analysis, cutting and denture) were performed on the berry flesh or on whole berries, and the acoustic emission produced was recorded simultaneously. Correlation studies showed strong and significant relationships between sensory texture attributes and instrumental parameters, particularly for the denture test. Nevertheless, satisfactory predictive accuracy for the perceived <b>crunchiness</b> required multivariate linear regression involving both mechanical and acoustic properties resulting from the denture test performed on whole berries. In this case, residual predictive interquartile amplitude was higher than 2. Most of the reliable models developed for perceived firmness are fairly recommended not for quantitative purposes but for fast screening (1. 6 < residual predictive interquartile amplitude < 2). Conclusions: The standardised protocol proposed permits more objective and quantitative sensory data to be obtained for firmness and <b>crunchiness</b> of tablegrapes. Significance of the Study: A combined mechanical–acoustic strategy has not previously been used in tablegrapes and represents a powerful tool for a more complete and exhaustive texture characterisation, particularly firmness and <b>crunchiness,</b> by means of a more objective and standardised protocol...|$|E

40|$|Recent studies {{incorporating}} product tasting in a conjoint framework {{have shown}} that sensory aspects have a primary influence on product liking whereas extrinsic factors may have a secondary role (1). Nevertheless there are, to the authors’ knowledge, no conjoint studies based on measuring the effects of different levels of sensory characteristics in fruit and vegetable. Aim of this work is to study whether the varying of different levels of intrinsic sensory attributes (<b>crunchiness</b> and sweetness) and of the information about fibres and antioxidants content (extrinsic) given just before tasting can influence the acceptability of apples. A fractional factorial design was applied to evaluate the influence of intrinsic factors and extrinsic factors on the liking of 8 products. Four apple cultivars with 2 levels of <b>crunchiness</b> and sweetness were {{selected on the basis}} of the quantitative descriptive analysis of 21 varieties under study in a larger project supported by the Autonomous Province of Trento, Italy (AP 2010 / 2011). Then, 221 consumers were asked to evaluate the global liking of the 4 cultivars which were presented twice and were accompanied with different information about their contents in fibres and antioxidants. A preliminary blind test was also performed in order to measure their acceptability without any information. Additional data regarding consumer opinions, knowledge about healthy aspects, fruit consumptions and demographic data were also recorded. Significant effects were found for sensory factors while the extrinsic factors did non affect the consumers’ preference. In particular, global liking is positively influenced by high levels of <b>crunchiness</b> and sweetness. This confirms the importance of sensory characteristics in consumer acceptability, whereas it suggests that information about the amount of healthy components are of far less relevance at least for population average.

40|$|Background – Chickpea and {{fenugreek}} {{are both}} legumes that confer several nutritional and functional virtues, especially to diabetes and associated metabolic syndrome conditions. They {{are high in}} protein and fibre, low in fat and prove to be low glycaemic. They also provide a gluten-free alternative to those suffering from celiac disease. Though these seeds are locally available, hardly any products appear on the supermarket shelves. Objectives – The aim was to utilise the health and nutritional benefits of chickpea and fenugreek and develop acceptable snack products by extrusion technology. Design – Preliminary trials were conducted with different proportions of rice and chickpea at a range of extruder conditions to optimise the raw material and processing conditions. Studies were then conducted at optimum processing conditions using a 7 : 3 chickpea and rice combination replacing with 2 % fenugreek or 5, 10, 15 and 20 % FenuLifeÒ (deodorized fenugreek powder). Products were evaluated for their physical (expansion, <b>crunchiness</b> and colour) and sensory (texture, colour, flavour and overall acceptability) characteristics {{in order to identify}} their suitability as snack products. Outcomes – Addition of chickpea up to 70 % with rice showed increased expansion and stable product characteristics. Addition of fenugreek and FenuLifeÒ, indicated slight reduction in product expansion (radial) and <b>crunchiness.</b> However, the product made with 20 % FenuLifeÒ had significant changes in expansion, <b>crunchiness</b> and colour values. The median scores of sensory evaluation indicated that all products were within the acceptable range. Inclusion of fenugreek showed lower ratings for flavour due to the strong bitter taste of fenugreek. There {{were no significant differences between}} products containing FenuLifeÒ (5 - 15 %) in their colour, flavour, texture and overall quality. Conclusion – This study demonstrates an opportunity for using chickpea and fenugreek in functional product development. Fenugreek in the form of deodorize powder (fenulifeÒ) could be incorporated up to 15 % in a mixture of chickpea and rice to develop snack products of acceptable physical and sensory properties. <br /...|$|E

Breaking of corn flakes was done in a plastic tube in which flakes were piled one over another. Sounds emitted during breaking were detected by a piezoelectric accelerometer and recorded after amplification. Deformation curves were jagged and very irregular, and their course depended on the water activity of the material. Crispness of corn flakes was independent from water activity at aw 0. 639 that property was lost completely. An antiplasticizing effect of water on corn flakes was observed in the water activity range from 0. 516 to 0. 639. Acoustic activity of breaking corn flakes was also dependent on water activity. The energy of acoustic signal decreased at aw> 0. 516.

40|$|In a {{previous}} study (1), we manipulated the sound produced while biting into apple cylinders with the front teeth. Perceived crispness and hardness varied {{as a function of}} the properties of the sound. In the present study, we adopt a different procedure for further investigating the role played by sound on the evaluation of apples and to investigate possible multisensory interaction between physical and chemical stimuli. Fifty-three naïve participants evaluated sensory properties of some apple cylinders (Reinette or Fuji) by chewing them with their lateral teeth and the sound produced while chewing was captured by a microphone. Then, it was manipulated in its high frequencies (2 - 20 kHz) in real time through a computer, before being fed back to the participant via a pair of headphones. The sound manipulation was made by either 24 dB reduction, or 12 dB increase, or else the real sound delivering. Evaluations were made by expressing an intensity score on a 100 -pt rating scale for the following sensory attributes: <b>crunchiness,</b> hardness, juiciness, or sweetness. According to a balanced incomplete block design each participant evaluated no more than two attributes. The data collected were related to 20 participants for each attributes (with 6 replicates for attribute). Sound reduction induced a decrease in perceived apple <b>crunchiness</b> compared to sound increase or the real sound replicating what previously highlighted for perceived crispness (1). The results revealed instead that sound related information did not affect juiciness or sweetness perception. Interestingly, hardness evaluations performed with the lateral teeth were not influenced by sound manipulation as opposed to previous results (1) that showed a sound influence on hardness evaluated with the front teeth. This might be due to chewing duration that in the present study was longer and eventually prevented any auditory conditioning. We suggest also that this result could be related to the different stages in food properties processing at which these evaluations are performed, with hardness perception at first bite with front teeth being an earlier event than hardness perception during chewing. Our findings support the role of sound in the evaluation of an important driver for apples preference, like <b>crunchiness.</b> Sound does not appear to influence other judgments more related to chewing. 1) Demattè, M.

Untreated (control) and treated with calcium lactate fresh cut slices were closed in plastic boxes for 24 hours (T 1) or five days of storage (T 2) at 5 °C, and then placed at 20 °C to assess consumers’ liking. Soluble solids content, titratable acidity, firmness and pH were measured. A sample of n = 750 consumers was selected taking into consideration three variables: age (from 25 to 55 years old), professional status (employed) and aptitude to buy fresh-cut fruit for personal use. A systematic sampling was used, with a detection point based in a properly selected supermarket during the peak hours. Respondents were asked to give a score to the fresh-cut fruit, offered blindcoded, at the two different times after cutting (T 1 and T 2), for four sensory parameters: visual appearance, flavor, <b>crunchiness</b> and taste. The results showed that slices treated with calcium lactate, after 5 days of storage, received the highest rating for all the parameters considered, and, in particular, regarding flavor, <b>crunchiness,</b> and taste. The high suitability of the white peach ‘Settembrina di Bivona’ to maintain, after the treatment with calcium lactate, its organoleptic requirements and taste, according to consumers, shows that this cultivar has excellent potential as fresh-cut produce. Consumers’ ratings did not depend on changes in either soluble solids content or titratable acidity, or firmness and pH, that changed marginally during the fruit storage period, but were highly related to visual score.
