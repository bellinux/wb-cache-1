Alzheimer's Disease and Other Dementias: Abeta Oligomerization and Toxicity: Poster <b>no.</b> <b>637.</b> 10 Increasing {{lines of}} {{evidence}} {{have shown that}} autophagy can be an adaptive process for neurons to struggle for survives. Our previous studies have demonstrated the presence of autophagosomes in concomitance with the aggregation of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in cultured neurons upon exposure to oligomeric β-amyloid (Aβ) peptide. However, the precise mechanisms of how aggregation of the ER leads to formation of autophagosomes are largely unclear. We hypothesize that the damaged ER serves as a seed for nucleation proteins to form autophagosomes. The {{aim of this study}} is to elucidate the biological mechanisms of the nucleation step. Primary cultures of hippocampal neurons were employed for this study. Different DNA constructs conjugated with fluorescent proteins were used to monitor the change of autophagic flux in live neurons. By using multiphoton live cell imaging system, we observed that Aβ-induced autophagosomes were accompanied by omegasomes which were precursors for autophagosomes. Aggregation of the ER could facilitate the formation of the omegasomes. Meanwhile, Atg 14 L, a key mediator for forming omegasomes, was also found to be clustered at the ER aggregation site. The clustered Atg 14 L would further recruit Beclin 1 -Vps 34 to form a nucleation complex that would contribute to formation of omegasomes. Our results are among the first to demonstrate how aggregated ER trigger autophagy in neurons stressed by oligomeric Aβ peptide. link_to_OA_fulltextThe 41 st Annual Meeting of the Society for Neuroscience (SfN 2011), Washington, D.

30|$|According to the {{information}} retrieved from the literature {{the cause of his}} death is actually unspecified. Most Foscolo’s biographers report that he died on Sept/ 10 / 1827 of a long standing liver disease while, Pecchio mention an inflammatory malady of the liver. However among numerous febrile episodes reported by Foscolo there are two characterized as bilious fever (febbre biliosa) [letter no 650 (Aug/ 12 / 1826) and letter no 652 (Sept/ 5 / 1826)] and one characterized as inflammatory fever (febbre infiammatoria) [letter no 632 (Sept/ 12 / 1824)]. Some months before, on 17 th April 1824 he reported to Lord Dacre [letter no 627] that he suffered from fever that lasted for several weeks. In the letter <b>no</b> <b>637</b> to Mr Walker (Oct. 1824) he mentioned that he had just recovered from a disease. In the letter <b>no</b> <b>637</b> to Hudson Gurney (Aug/ 12 / 1826) he was seeking of a more effective remedy against the bile, since nor the pills, nor the rhubarb (which he took in high doses) were able to straining the stomach. He also states that he would prefer of any other disease since bilious attacks rendered him oppressively sleepy. In the letter no 652 to Mr Edgardo Taylor (Sept/ 5 / 1826), he reported: “when I walked up to my last hovel, I began to suffer of a bilious fever” and “fever turns in what we call cholera morbus. Now I feel better, but I feel very tired, yet, the worst in this disease is a lethargic slumber”. Four months later he writes to Mr Reinaud di Zante [letter no 666 (Jan/ 9 / 1827)]: “I was staying for long in bad or mediocre (situation) and never in good health”. Finally, after a short recovery period [letter no 670 (Mar/ 28 / 1827)], a febrile (?) disease described as lasting for more than 3  months was reappeared. Accordingly to Antona-Traversi’s notes, Foscolo’s health was getting worst: He wrote to Bossi (Mar/ 1827) that his fever comes every afternoon and it is associated with bilious irritation. Two months later (Jul/ 1827) he wrote to Mami that his illness lasts 8  months and was gradually aggravated: Despite frequent bloodletting sessions the fever comes twice daily being slight in the morning and rages during the evening. He also noted that the true nature of this disease was finally revealed as it is a chronic liver and intestinal inflammation. Accordingly to Pecchio’s observations it was not before August 1827 that his health status was irreversibly deteriorated and indeed, towards the end of this month, Foscolo’s disease made life very hard for him. He was losing weight day by day and manifested a predisposition to dropsy as a consequence of a disease of the liver that has long afflicted him. In fact, in the letter no 674, to Canonico Riego (Aug/ 5 / 1827), Foscolo notes that the dropsy was growing rapidly however; the surgeon didn’t consider it mature enough for an operation. According to Antona-Traversi, Foscolo finally underwent surgery (paracentesis), which was repeated few days later, however they offered little help. In fact, Foscolo wrote to Bossi (Aug/ 21 / 1827) that weakness, insomnia and dyspepsia continued while dropsy relapsed as well. In Sep/ 7 / 1827 he went into a coma and died on Sep/ 10 / 1827.|$|R

40|$|Advances in {{production}} technology are increasing {{the availability of}} natural gas in the U. S. Examining how these technological advancements influence the dynamics in the natural gas and energy sectors is the subject here. Tests for parameters constancy in cointegrated vector autoregressive models are applied to investigate the possible existence of structural changes in pricing relationships among North America natural gas spot markets. Results suggest that long-run pricing relationships among eight natural gas spot prices are not constant over the period of 1994 to 2014. Two potential breaks are found, during 2000 and 2009. Possible contributing factors to structural changes occurring during 2000 are expensive and volatile natural gas prices, the U. S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission Order <b>No.</b> <b>637,</b> and changes in imports. The major contributing factor to the structural change during 2009 is likely the shale gas revolution. Prequential analysis is applied {{to determine how the}} presence of these structural breaks affects probabilistic forecasts of out-of-sample data of natural gas returns. Models using longer periods as the based estimation period, forecast returns better. Threshold cointegration examines the effects of the structural breaks on transaction costs between natural gas markets. Pairwise transaction costs differ between the 2009 preand post-break periods. During the post-break period, five of seven pairwise transaction costs decrease, while the remaining two pair-wise transaction costs increase relative to the pre-break period. Alterations in natural gas flows {{as the result of the}} shale gas revolution partially explain the transaction costs changes. Finally, a data-rich methodology is used to investigate how the number of factors derived from a large number of time series influences inferences and probabilistic forecasting performance concerning natural gas production. Factor-augmented vector autoregressive models and prequential analysis are applied to data series of the U. S. energy and macroeconomic variables. The number of factors minimally affects inferences from factor-augmented vector autoregressive models, but considerably affects probabilistic forecasting performance. Exploiting estimated factor improves the forecasting ability, but including too many factors tends to exacerbate probabilistic forecasts performance...|$|R

40|$|An {{ecological}} {{study of the}} benthic and fish populations at Mōkapu, O’ahu, Hawai’i was completed {{in the summer of}} 1979. This is the second post-installation study of the Mōkapu Outfall area since the commencement of effluent discharge in December 1977. An initial baseline survey was completed in 1975 (Russo et al. 1977, 1979). Data were obtained from five stations between Mōkapu Point on the northeastern tip of O’ahu to Alāla Point approximately 6 034 m (3. 75 miles) south, at depths of 6 to 24 m (20 - 80 ft) in all surveys. Results show little or no effect from the operation of the outfall on the benthic and fish communities two years after commencement of discharge. There are no significant differences in abundance, diversity or composition of fishes from 1975 to 1979 except over the outfall site where fish abundance increased significantly especially over the diffuser where the snapper Lutjanus kasmira was counted in large numbers (> 500). The relative abundance of herbivorous fishes (acanthurids) increased near the outfall. This may be commensurate with an increased coverage of a fine microalgal mat and an increase in the biomass of Lyngbya, a blue-green alga near the outfall site. The biomass of dominant macroalgae did not significantly change at any of the five areas surveyed. Between the 1975, 1978, and present (1979) studies, there are some differences in coral cover which are attributed to patchy substrata distribution rather than stress from the sewer outfall. In comparison with the samples of 1975 and 1978, the 1979 transect D samples and that from the diffuser show a lower, overall abundance in micromolluscan assemblages than was recorded in either 1975 or 1978, and that Tricolia, Vitricithna, Rissoina miltozona, and Bittium increased in relative proportions at the 18 to 16 m (60 - 80 ft) depth levels and at the diffuser. The differences reflect increasing numbers of micromollusks more usually associated with depths of less than 15 m (50 ft) at greater depths and of species associated with frondose algae and substrata. This trend was noted in 1978 and is apparent again in 1979. Large differences among some of the 1979 samples and between the 1979 and other year samples reflect the patchiness of the substratum and cannot be attributed to effects of the sewer outfall.

The first approximation is used for the calculation of the ELF itself and the second one is used to approximate pair populations integrated in the ELF basins. Both approximations only need the natural orbitals and their occupancies, which are available for most methods used in electronic structure calculations. In this way, methods such as CCSD and MP 2 can be used for the calculation of the ELF despite the lack of a pertinent definition of the 2 -PD. By avoiding the calculation of the 2 -PD, the present formulation provides the means for routine calculations of the ELF in medium-size molecules with correlated methods.

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{unethical}} behaviors {{in health care}} settings {{is an important issue}} in the safe care of clients and has been a concern of the nursing profession for some time. The {{purpose of this study was}} to examine the relationship between use of unethical behaviors in the nursing student experience and the use of unethical behaviors in the workplace as a registered nurse. In addition, the relationship between the severity of unethical behaviors utilized in the classroom, clinical setting and those in the workplace was examined. To insure greater honesty in self-report, only a limited number of demographic variables were requested from participants. ^ During the summer of 1997, a 56 item questionnaire was distributed to registered nurses enrolled in either undergraduate or graduate courses in a public or private institution. The participants were asked to self-report their own use of unethical behaviors as well as their peers use of unethical behaviors. In order to assign a severity score for each item, nursing school faculty were asked to rate severity of unethical behaviors which could be used during the nursing student experience and nursing administrators were asked to rate unethical behaviors which could be used in the workplace. ^ A significant positive relationship was found between individuals 2 ̆ 7 use of unethical behaviors during nursing school and those used in the workplace r=. 630.

40|$|Functionalization of endohedral metallofullerenes (EMFs) is {{an active}} line of {{research}} that is important for obtaining nanomaterials with unique properties that might {{be used in a}} variety of fields, ranging from molecular electronics to biomedical applications. Such functionalization is commonly achieved by means of cycloaddition reactions. The scarcity of both experimental and theoretical studies analyzing the exohedral regioselectivity of cycloaddition reactions involving EMFs translates into a poor understanding of the EMF reactivity. From a theoretical point of view, the main obstacle is the high computational cost associated with this kind of studies. To alleviate the situation, we propose an approach named the frozen cage model (FCM) based on single point energy calculations at the optimized geometries of the empty cage products. The FCM represents a fast and computationally inexpensive way to perform accurate qualitative predictions of the exohedral regioselectivity of cycloaddition reactions in EMFs. Analysis of the Dimroth approximation, the activation strain or distortion/interaction model, and the noncluster energies in the Diels–Alder cycloaddition of s-cis- 1, 3 -butadiene to X@D 3 h-C 78 (X = Ti 2 C 2, Sc 3 N, and Y 3 N) EMFs provides a justification of the methodThe following organizations are thanked for financial support: the Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovacion (MICINN, Project Nos.

40|$|In a {{previous}} paper (J. Phys. Chem. A 2009, 113, 9721), we analyzed theoretically the Diels−Alder cycloaddition between cyclopentadiene and C 60 for which experimental results on energy barriers and reaction energies are known. One {{of the main}} conclusions reached was that the two-layered ONIOM 2 (B 3 LYP/ 6 - 31 G(d) :SVWN/STO- 3 G) method provides results {{very close to the}} full B 3 LYP/ 6 - 31 G(d) ones. Unfortunately, however, both the exothermicity of the reaction and the energy barrier were clearly overestimated by these two methods. In the present work, we analyze the effect of the inclusion of Grimme’s dispersion corrections in the energy profile of this reaction. Our results show that these corrections are essential to get results close to the experimental values. In addition, we have performed calculations both with and without dispersion corrections for the Diels−Alder reaction of C 60 and several dienes and for the Diels−Alder cycloaddition of a (5, 5) single-walled carbon nanotube and 1, 3 -cis-butadiene. The results obtained indicate that inclusion of dispersion corrections is compulsory {{for the study of the}} chemical reactivity of fullerenes and nanotubeThe following organizations are thanked for financial support: the Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovacion (MICINN, Project nos.

40|$|In {{this work}} we present the {{formulas}} for {{the calculation of}} exact three-center electron sharing indices (3 c-ESI) and introduce two new approximate expressions for correlated wave functions. The 3 c-ESI uses the third-order density, the diagonal of the third-order reduced density matrix, but the approximations suggested in this work only involve natural orbitals and occupancies. In addition, the first calculations of 3 c-ESI using Valdemoro's, Nakatsuji's and Mazziotti's approximation for the third-order reduced density matrix are also presented for comparison. Our results on a test set of molecules, including 32 3 c-ESI values, prove that the new approximation based on the cubic root of natural occupancies performs the best, yielding absolute errors below 0. 07 and an average absolute error of 0. 015. Furthemore, this approximation seems to be rather insensitive {{to the amount of}} electron correlation present in the system. This newly developed methodology provides a computational inexpensive method to calculate 3 c-ESI from correlated wave functions and opens new avenues to approximate high-order reduced density matrices in other contexts, such as the contracted Schrödinger equation and the anti-Hermitian contracted Schrödinger equationThe authors are indebted to Mauricio Rodriguez-Mayorga for his assistance with some calculations.

40|$|The {{concepts}} of conjugation and hyperconjugation {{play an important}} role to provide an explanation for several fundamental phenomena observed in organic chemistry. Because these effects cannot be directly measured experimentally, their assessment became a primary concern for chemists from the very beginning. In general, the stabilization produced by both phenomena has been studied by means of isodesmic reactions and energy based analysis such as the energy decomposition analysis. In recent years, electronic delocalization measures have been successfully applied to elucidate the nature of chemical bonding and the aromatic character of all kind of molecules. Because conjugation and hyperconjugation stabilizations are strongly linked to the concept of electron delocalization, this paper will give an account of both effects {{from the point of view}} of electronic delocalization measures calculated within the framework of the quantum theory of atoms in molecules. In particular, we focus our attention in the controversial case of the stabilization by conjugation in 1, 3 -butadiyne and 1, 3 -butadiene. Unexpectedly, theoretical calculations based on the scheme proposed by Kistiakowsky to quantify the extent of stabilization due to conjugation predicted that the conjugation of 1, 3 -butadiyne was zero. Subsequent energetic analyses contradicted this observation. These studies pointed out the presence of hyperconjugation stabilization in the hydrogenated product of 1, 3 -butadiyne and 1, 3 -butadiene that were used as reference systems in the Kistiakowsky's scheme. Consequently, the extra stabilization of 1 -butyne due to hyperconjugation hides the stabilization by conjugation of 1, 3 -butadiyne. Our results based on electron delocalization measures confirm both the presence of conjugation in 1, 3 -butadiene and 1, 3 -butadiyne and hyperconjugation stabilization in their respective hydrogenated products, 1 -butene and 1 -butyneFinancial help has been furnished by the Spanish MICINN Projects No. CTQ 2008 - 03077 /BQU, CTQ 2011 - 23156 /BQU and CTQ 2008 - 06532 /BQU and by the Catalan DIUE through projects <b>No.</b> 2009 SGR <b>637</b> and 2009 SGR 528.

40|$|The lack of {{reference}} aromatic {{systems in the}} realm of inorganic aromatic compounds makes the evaluation of aromaticity in all-metal and semimetal clusters a difficult task. To date, calculation of nucleus-independent chemical shifts (NICS) has been the most widely used method to discuss aromaticity in these systems. In {{the first part of this}} work, we briefly review our previous studies, showing some pitfalls of the NICS indicator of aromaticity in organic molecules. Then, we refer to our study on the performance of some aromaticity indices in a series of 15 aromaticity tests, which can be used to analyze the advantages and drawbacks of aromaticity descriptors. It is shown that indices based on the study of electron delocalization are the most accurate among those analyzed in the series of proposed tests, while NICS(1) zz and NICS(0) pzz present the best behavior among NICS indices. In the second part, we discuss the use of NICS and electronic multicenter indices (MCI) in inorganic clusters. In particular, we evaluate the aromaticity of two series of all-metal and semimetal clusters with predictable aromaticity trends by means of NICS and MCI. Results show that the expected trends are generally better reproduced by MCI than NICS. It is concluded that NICS(0) p and NICS(0) pzz are the kind of NICS that perform the best among the different NICS indices analyzed for the studied series of inorganic compoundsFinancial help has been furnished by the Spanish MICINN Project No. CTQ 2008 - 03077 /BQU and by the Catalan DIUE through project <b>No.</b> 2009 SGR <b>637.</b> F.

40|$|Chagas {{disease is}} one of the most {{important}} parasitic diseases in Latin America, transmitted by triatomine, has reached more than 10 million people. This illness is typical of rural environments and inadequate housing provides shelter to the vector the disease transmitter. The aim of this study was to investigate the presence of Trypanosoma cruzi in triatomines captured in intradomiciliary and surroundings in cities in the southeast region of CearÃin. This is a retrospective descriptive study, by consulting the archives of Control Program of Chagas Disease in Regional Laboratory of Endemic Diseases of Limoeiro do Norte â CE, which attends the cities that were studied from 2009 to 2011. During the study were captured a total of 18. 408 specimens of insects, including nymphs and adults inside the home and outside homes. Of this total, 17. 910 specimens were examined, representing 97, 29 %. The number of nymphs was taken about three times greater than the number of adults. The year of 2010 was the one with the highest number of captures, with a total of 8. 548 triatomines, distributed among nymphs (6. 115) and adults (2. 433), and 637 inside of the houses and 7. 911 around the houses. This year presented an infection rate of 1. 30 %, with 107 positive triatomines, being QuixerÃ the city with the highest infection rate in that year. The infection rate in adults triatomine (1. 92 %) was higher than in nymphs (1. 21 %). The species captured during the study period were Triatoma pseudomaculta, Triatoma brasiliensis, Panstrongylus megistus, Panstrongylus lutzi and Rhodnius nasutus. Of these species, T. pseudomaculta was the most captured throughout the study period, with 12. 643 specimes. During this study, were 11 cities studied, and the most infested was Tabuleiro do Norte with 3. 976 specimens, followed by Ãrere with 3. 289. The city with the highest infection rate during the study period was Limoeiro do Norte (5, 00 %) with a total of 125 triatomines positive, followed by QuixerÃ (2. 39 %). At the end of the study, we can conclude that it is still necessary to intensify Control Program of Chagas disease, in order to avoid the maximum transmission of this disease. Finally we highlight the importance of conducting educational programs to the population in order to provide guidance to the public on disease prevention, such as towing houses, fix cracks and maintain clean environments at home and around the homes to prevent colonization of the approach and vectors.

Essa enfermidade Ã tÃpica de ambientes rurais e habitaÃÃes inadequadas que oferecem abrigo ao vector transmissor da doenÃa. O presente estudo tem como objetivo investigar a presenÃa de Trypanosoma cruzi em triatomÃneos capturados nos intra e peridomicÃlios, em municÃpios da regiÃo sudestedo estado do CearÃ. Trata-se de um estudo retrospectivo descritivo, de consulta aos arquivos do Programa de Controle da DoenÃa de Chagas do LaboratÃrio Regional de Endemias do Limoeiro do Norte â CE, que atende os municÃpios que foram estudados no perÃodo de 2009 a 2011. Durante o estudo foi capturado um total de 18. 408 exemplares de triatomÃneos, entre ninfas e adultos no intradomicÃlio e peridomicÃlio. Desse total, 17. 910 exemplares foram examinados, representando 97, 29 % dos capturados. O nÃmero de ninfas capturadas foi cerca de trÃs vezes maior que o nÃmero de adultos. O ano de 2010 foi o ano com maior nÃmero de capturas, com um total de 8. 548 triatomÃneos capturados, distribuÃdos entre ninfas (6. 115) e adultos (2. 433), sendo <b>637</b> <b>no</b> intradomicÃlio e 7. 911 no peridomicÃlio. O Ãndice de infecÃÃo nesse ano foi de 1, 30 %, com 107 triatomÃneos positivos, sendo QuixerÃ o municÃpio com maior Ãndice de infecÃÃo. O Ãndice de infecÃÃo em adultos (1, 92 %) foi maior do que em ninfas (1, 21 %). As espÃcies capturadas durante o perÃodo de estudo foram Triatoma pseudomaculta, Triatoma brasiliensis, Panstrongylus megistus, Panstrongylus lutzi e Rhodnius nasutus. Dessas espÃcies, T. pseudomaculta foi a mais capturada durante todo o perÃodo de estudo, com 12. 643 exemplares. Durante o perÃodo de estudo foram estudados 11 municÃpios, sendo o mais infestado Tabuleiro do Norte com 3. 976 exemplares, seguido de Ãrere com 3. 289 exemplares. O municÃpio que apresentou maior Ãndice de infecÃÃo durante o perÃodo de estudo foi Limoeiro do Norte (5, 00 %) com um total de 125 triatomÃneos positivos, seguido de QuixerÃ (2, 39 %). Ao fim do estudo, pode-se concluir que ainda faz-se necessÃria a intensificaÃÃo do Programa de Controle da DoenÃa de Chagas, para poder evitar ao mÃximo a transmissÃo da doenÃa. Finalmente destaca-se a importÃncia de realizar programas educativos Ã populaÃÃo com a finalidade de dar orientaÃÃes Ã populaÃÃo na prevenÃÃo da doenÃa, tais como rebocar as casas, corrigir frestas e manter limpos os ambientes no peridomicÃlio e no domicÃlio para evitar a aproximaÃÃo e colonizaÃÃo dos vetores...|$|R
