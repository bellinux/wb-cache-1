40|$|A {{theoretical}} {{model for the}} cooperative control of cellular kinetics is investigated. A <b>critical</b> <b>substance</b> A is produced by the cells whose concentration in a given cell determines whether that cell can divide. The substance A can leak out of the cells into the surrounding medium as well as be reabsorbed by the cells. This feature then implies communication between the cells since all concentrations will be functions of the population density. The substance A also has a lifetime, i. e. decays, for example, by denaturation. This system can be described by three coupled nonlinear differential equations which can be solved analytically in certain limiting cases and can, of course, be studied in detail by computer techniques. Our investigations have shown that (a) there is a critical initial cell population density below which cell proliferation will not occur, (b) cell proliferation can be stimulated by supplying substance A to the medium {{and there is a}} critical initial concentration in the medium for initiating proliferation when the cell population density is subcritical, and (c) a well-defined induction period prior to exponential growth may exist whose length depends on the system parameters and initial conditions...|$|E

In other words the definition and cultures of practice, research and education in the subject are yet to be unequivocally consolidated and explicitly systematized. In this short essay I will describe this condition as ‘Unfixed’. Hildebrandt captures the essence of the unfixedness of Interior Architecture in the essay The Gaps Between Interior Design and Architecture. Cited at the start of this essay, he suggests that meaning in Interior Architecture is embedded inside, as well as outside, of the building. In doing so he corroborates the notion that the subject as one that is engrained within the architectural matter, appearing to be part of an established condition. Yet it is as reliant on what lies outside the building as much as that, which is rooted within it. Perhaps inadvertently, Hildebrandt supports the notion that in any description of meaning in the subject the ambiguous qualities of Interior Architecture are still forcefully prevalent. The suggestion of capturing meaning within as well as outside the building, in order to offer a broad context from which to derive the substance of Interior Architecture, offers a limitless context from which to derive the meaning of the subject. On this basis the complexities of Interior Architecture, its uncodified yet embedded condition in the matter of the building, affords it the opportunity to continually redefine and experiment with its own meanings and processes of origination. This situation always offers the opportunity to reiterate and redefine its fundamental and essential cultures of practice, research and education, a process that incorporates an analysis of its relevance to the design and construction of the contemporary built environment...|$|E
40|$|The {{forms of}} tobacco use are many, {{and it is}} likely that their number is matched by equally varied {{controlling}} variables. All the usual forms of tobacco use, however, share at least one commonality: nicotine is extracted from the tobacco and ingested in a manner that permits its distribution to the central nervous system. The tobacco cigarette is the prevalent means of nicotine self-administration in Western society, and cigarette smoking is the primary form of tobacco use addressed by legislative, research, and treatment efforts. In 1983, the United States Public Health Service categorized cigarette smoking as a form of drug dependence in which nicotine was held to be the <b>critical</b> <b>substance</b> (USPHS 1983). Consistent with the drug dependence model of cigarette smoking, in 1984 a pharmacotherapeutic aid (nicotine gum) for the treatment of tobacco dependence was approved by the Food and Drug Administration. This paper will briefly review nicotine dependence and its implications for the use of chemotherapy in the treatment of tobacco dependence with respect to cigarette smoking. TOBACCO DEPENDENCE: A DECEPTIVELY COMPLEX PHENOMENON At first brush. tobacco dependence would seem readily amenable to study. In the form of cigarette smoking. the behavior is public, practiced by many, and appears to involve a simple act with a simple product. However, cigarette smoking has resisted many attempts at quantitative study, and studies have yielded data which often appears contradictory at the most elemental levels. For instance, the role of dose in the control of cigarette smoking has remained unclear despite decades of study. Since dose-response relations are arguably the most critical quantitative relations to be assessed in pharmacologic studies, the absence of consensual agreement as to the nature of dose-response relations has undoubtedly hindered the understanding and treatment of cigarette smoking. There are specific reasons for some of the ambiguity concerning the role of dose in cigarette smoking.

40|$|International audiencehe multi-layered Eocene aquifer is a {{regional}} scale sedimentary aquifer system occupying ∼ 120, 000 km 2 within the Adour-Garonne district (France). Local authorities have recently identified the aquifer as being {{at risk from}} extensive irrigation abstractions, threatening the sustainability of this key resource. Because large water abstractions for human activities can significantly influence the natural functioning of such aquifer systems, e. g., with leakage between aquifer layers, {{which can lead to}} water quality degradation, the characterization of such large systems constitutes a key point to protect and prevent further deterioration of aquatic ecosystems. This study provides further insight on this large aquifer through a geochemical approach, which addresses the limited number of groundwater wells where sampling is possible. For that purpose, a geochemical analysis combining two isotope systems (δ 34 SSO 4, δ 18 OSO 4 and 87 Sr/ 86 Sr) has been applied. The Eocene sedimentary aquifer system (detrital to carbonate deposits) is made up of four aquifer layers, Eocene Infra-Molassic sand, Early Eocene, Middle Eocene and Late Eocene, and has a mineralized area north of the Aquitaine Basin, where groundwater shows strong mineralization and anomalous levels of <b>critical</b> <b>substances</b> (SO 4, F, etc.), increasing the difficulty of resource exploitation. The extreme heterogeneity of the geochemical composition of the groundwater between the aquifers and within a single aquifer is discussed in terms of the lithological control induced by the lateral variation of facies and interconnections between aquifer layers. Geochemical tools, especially the δ 34 S and δ 18 O from dissolved sulfates and the 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratio, suggest that evaporite dissolution (both sulfate and halite) is the main process controlling the high salinity levels observed in the groundwater, explaining the spatial variations observed at the aquifer system scale. Isotopic tools also provide new information regarding the interconnections between aquifer layers, supporting the hypothesis that the Eocene aquifer system integrates groundwater from the Oligocene–Miocene aquifer through leakage effects. These new insights will likely help decision-makers adjust their choices when managing quality problems, in particular in the “mineralized area of the Entre-Deux-Mers,” where targeted groundwater wells used for drinking water display anomalous levels of <b>critical</b> <b>substances...</b>|$|R

30|$|Tryptophan is an {{essential}} amino acid, necessary {{for the production of}} several <b>critical</b> <b>substances</b> in the body (e.g., serotonin), {{as well as in the}} human diet. Moreover, using tryptophan as capping agent will not induce any environmental toxicity in the CdS NPs formation process. The interaction of tryptophan with NPs occurs via the unshared electron pair on the nitrogen atom and is a result of the formation of a complex between the metal and the π-electrons of the indole ring of tryptophan. The indole ring of tryptophan can participate in π–π stacking interactions for nanoparticle self-assembly and is a fluorescent amino acid that could serve as a probe in non-biological environments. The growth of the particle decreases in the presence of tryptophan, a capping agent. Two effects are considered to explain the decrease in particle size in the presence of a capping agent. First, the growth of the particles may be considered as a polymerization reaction with the capping molecule playing the role of a terminator of the chain. Second, as the precipitation is often not complete, because of the capping of Cd 2 + ions by carboxylic acid (–COOH) and amine (–NH 2) groups of tryptophan, smaller particles may simply result. It is found that the particle size decreases in the presence of a capping agent due to restriction of growth of particles.|$|R

30|$|Development of {{criteria}} for classification of persistent toxic substances {{goes back to}} the 70 s of the last century. They evolved over the last decades due to the diversification of the protection aims under various national regulatory frameworks and international agreements [34]. Japan was the first nation regulating PCBs and other chloro-organic compounds by assessing their P, B, and T properties [35]. However, they did not define criteria for a formal assessment process. Canada and the USA recognised the need for elimination of persistent toxic substances from the Great Lakes and introduced the concept of half-life of a substance in water as a measure (criterion) for persistence [31, 50]: “Half-life means the time required for the concentration of a substance to diminish to one-half of its original value in a lake or water body”. They also defined a numerical value for the persistence criterion: “Persistent toxic substance means any toxic substance with a half-life in water of greater than eight weeks” [31, 50]. With the beginning of the 90 s, various international commissions and North-American national institutions developed further the concept of environmental half-lives as persistence criteria and extended it to other environmental compartments (air, soil, sediment, ground water). An ad hoc science group of Environment Canada [22] reviewed degradation half-lives of a set of <b>critical</b> <b>substances,</b> mainly hydrophobic neutral organic compounds, such as PCBs, PAHs, PCDD/Fs. Scientific judgement was used to assign numerical values (half-lives) of 6  months in water and soil and 1  year in sediment, respectively, which became legally binding with the Canadian Environmental Protection Act [8]. The different half-lives reflect the persistence data available for the set of neutral hydrophobic reference chemicals, against which a chemical is to be compared. The group stated that “…under Canadian climate conditions  6  months is a reasonable window of time in which soil temperature and moisture favour biodegradation of many substances”.|$|R

In this context the non-contact and non-destructive measurement with light, which greatly simplifies the analysis of <b>critical</b> <b>substances,</b> is advantageous. Optical spectroscopy, therefore, {{is an important part of}} analytics. In particular near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy with a wave length range from 780 nm to 3000 nm exhibits numerous applications, ranging from chemical reactions and process analyses, examinations of polymers and textile to quality control of fruits and seeds as well as medical technology. The NIR spectrometers used in this context are primarily designed as spectrographs while the dispersive element is firmly installed and the spectrum is measured via a diode array based on gallium arsenide. Diode arrays in the NIR range are costly but contribute significantly to the spectral resolution of the spectrograph. An alternative approach uses monochromators with a flexible dispersive element as the spectrum swipes across the detector at a specific time. A single diode as a detector is sufficient for this purpose. However, the spectral resolution is a function of the time-dependent position of the dispersive element, which must be controlled and guided with high precision. A macroscopic realization in combination with quick spectrum measurement times in the millisecond range is very elaborate. The present work alternatively deals with the manufacturing and characterization of a micromechanical NIR diffraction grating with which a new, miniaturized NIR spectrometer, based on a monochromator configuration, could be realized. The diffraction grating is based on a resonantly driven micro-mirror, which has been manufactured as a micro-electromechanical system (MEMS) with silicon-based, near-surface volume micromechanics. In this process an extremely compact and robust NIR spectrometer (10 x 8 x 7. 5 cm³) was developed by using a micromechanical diffraction grating. The spectrometer shows a decisive cost advantage in comparison with current NIR spectrographs. In this regard it was absolutely necessary to mirror the requirements for the micromechanical diffraction grating with the marginal conditions of the NIR spectrometer and bring these in agreement with each other. A spectral resolution of the NIR spectrometer below 10 nm with a wave length range of 900 - 2500 nm was achieved with a targeted dimensioning and optimization of the mechanical and optical properties of the micromechanical diffraction grating; this also included among other things the size, diffraction efficiency, vibration frequency, vibration stability, shock resistance and a procedure to detect the time-dependent torsion angle.

Specifically, the drug policy making practices of the North Shore in British Columbia will be explored. An analysis of the secondary data related to the North Shore Substance Abuse Task Force as well as interviews with key members of the task force reveals how the North Shore went about developing a partnership framework to address substance abuse. This paper concludes that, while looking to other municipalities to model drug policy making is interesting and working on a partnership based approach is beneficial, the importance of embedding an implementation plan directly in the policy cannot be overlooked...|$|R
40|$|This paper investigates Newton’s {{ontology}} {{of space}} {{in order to determine}} its commitment, if any, to both Cambridge neo-Platonism, which posits an incorporeal basis for space, and substantivalism, which regards space as a form of substance or entity. A non-substantivalist interpretation of Newton’s theory has been famously championed by Howard Stein and Robert DiSalle, among others, while both Stein and the early work of J. E. McGuire have downplayed the influence of Cambridge neo-Platonism on various aspects of Newton’s own spatial hypotheses. Both of these assertions will be shown to be problematic on various grounds, with special emphasis placed on Stein’s influential case for a non-substantivalist reading. Our analysis will strive, nonetheless, to reveal the unique or forward-looking aspects of Newton’s approach, most notably, his <b>critical</b> assessment of <b>substance</b> ontologies, that help to distinguish his theory of space from his neo-Platonic contemporaries and predecessors...|$|R
