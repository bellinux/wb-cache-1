5|$|Bill Pugh, {{the chief}} {{plastics}} designer at Cascelloid, based in Leicester, and former Royal Air Force pilot, created {{a prototype of}} the blown lemon-shaped plastic shaped <b>container</b> <b>based</b> upon Hack's idea sometime in the 1950s, {{as well as other}} types of blown containers. Pugh's experimented with the initial design until he was satisfied with its appearance. This plastic lemon product was then used for Hax lemon juice. Edward Hack, Ltd. produced and marketed Hax brand squeezable plastic lemon containers filled with two ounces of Sicilian lemon juice. Per Edward Hack, Ltd., the juice was unfiltered, had no water added to it, and contained a preservative to prevent spoilage. Retailers could purchase the product in packs of six bags that contained 12 squeeze packs each, totalling 72 units. Upon introduction to the marketplace, Hax juice and the plastic lemon design received some press coverage. The Hax logo used on Hax lemon juice dates back to at least 1935, at which time it was used in advertisements for Hax brand iodine pencils and Hax brand aspirin.|$|E

40|$|Radioactive waste {{transport}} package {{was developed to}} transport eight drums of low and intermediate level waste(LILW) {{in accordance with the}} IAEA and domestic related regulations. The package is classified with industrial package IP- 2. IP- 2 package is required to undergo a free drop test and a stacking test. After free drop and stacking tests, it should prevent the loss or dispersal of radioactive contents, and loss of shielding integrity which would result in more than 20 % increase in the radiation level at any external surface of the package. The objective {{of this study is to}} establish the safety test method and procedure for stacking test and to prove the structural integrities of the IP- 2 package. Stacking test and analysis were performed with a compressive load equal to five times the weight of the package for a period of 24 hours using a full scale model. Strains and displacements were measured at the corner fitting of the package during the stacking test. The measured strains and displacements were compared with the analysis results, and there were good agreements. It is very difficult to measure the deflection at the <b>container</b> <b>base,</b> so the maximum deflection of the <b>container</b> <b>base</b> was calculated by the analysis method. The maximum displacement at the corner fitting and deflection at the <b>container</b> <b>base</b> were less than their allowable values. Dimensions of the test model, thickness of shielding material and bolt torque were measured before and after the stacking test. Throughout the stacking test, it was found that there were no loss or dispersal of radioactive contents and no loss of shielding integrity. Thus, the package was shown to compl...|$|R
