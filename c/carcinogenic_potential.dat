We therefore analyzed whether patients having severe atopic eczema had an increased cancer risk. The study population included all individuals hospitalized in Denmark with a primary diagnosis of atopic dermatitis during 1977 – 1996. Follow-up was conducted in 1996 in the Danish Cancer Register. A total of 6275 persons were included. Among 2030 adult patients, {{an increased risk of}} cancer was observed, standard morbidity ratio (SMR) = 1. 5 (95 % CI: 1. 2 – 1. 9). Half the excess cases of cancer was keratinocyte carcinomas of the skin diagnosed within the first 9 y of follow–up, SMR= 2. 4 (95 % CI: 1. 4 – 3. 9). For men, SMR= 2. 7 (95 %CI: 1. 2 – 5. 4). In conclusion, earlier hospitalized adult atopic dermatitis patients had an increased risk of cancer. Half the excess cases of cancer were keratinocyte carcinomas.

40|$|The {{mutagenic}} and <b>carcinogenic</b> <b>potentials</b> of lead {{are still}} being investigated. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the genotoxic effect of lead acetate in the early period of life, when the organism is extremely sensitive to toxic effects of lead. Six-day-old suckling Wistar rats were exposed to lead (as acetate) either orally for 9 days (daily dose 2 mg Pb/kg b. wt., 18 mg/kg b. wt. total dose) or by a single intraperitoneal injection (5 mg Pb/kg b. wt.). DNA damage was investigated using the comet assay and in vivo micronucleus test. The results of the comet assay showed statistically significant differences between the control (unexposed) animals and the two groups of exposed animals by ANOVA weighted for unequal variance (heterogeneity of variances was found by Levene’s test), followed by Tukey’s post hoc test at the level of significance of p < 0. 05. The two groups of lead-exposed animals were also significantly different from each other. Orally lead-exposed animals showed a significant increase of micronuclei frequencies in reticulocytes and erythrocytes compared to unexposed animals (ANOVA, p < 0. 05).

40|$|Comparative interactomics is a {{strategy}} for inferring potential interactions among orthologous proteins or "interologs". Herein we focus, in contrast to standard homology-based inference, on the divergence of protein interaction profiles among closely related organisms, showing that the approach can correlate specific traits to phenotypic differences. As a model, this new comparative interactomic approach was applied at a large scale to human papillomaviruses (HPVs) proteins. The oncogenic potential of HPVs is mainly determined by the E 6 and E 7 early proteins. We have mapped and overlapped the virus-host protein interaction networks of E 6 and E 7 proteins from 11 distinct HPV genotypes, selected for their different tropisms and pathologies. We generated robust and comprehensive datasets by combining two orthogonal protein interaction assays: yeast two-hybrid (Y 2 H), and our recently described "high-throughput Gaussia princeps protein complementation assay" (HT-GPCA). HT-GPCA detects protein interaction by measuring the interaction-mediated reconstitution of activity of a split G. princeps luciferase. Hierarchical clustering of interaction profiles recapitulated HPV phylogeny and was used to correlate specific virus-host interaction profiles with pathological traits, reflecting the distinct <b>carcinogenic</b> <b>potentials</b> of different HPVs. This comparative interactomics constitutes a reliable and powerful strategy to decipher molecular relationships in virtually any combination of microorganism-host interactions.

Here, we report differential molecular features between craniofacial (cNCCs) and trunk (tNCCs) NCCs by analyzing transcription profiles and sphere forming assays of NCCs from P 0 -Cre/floxed-EGFP mouse embryos. We identified up-regulation of genes linked to carcinogenesis in cNCCs that were not previously reported {{to be related to}} NCCs, which was considered to be, an interesting feature in regard with <b>carcinogenic</b> <b>potentials</b> of NCCs such as melanoma and neuroblastoma. Wnt signal related genes were statistically up-regulated in cNCCs, also suggesting potential involvement of cNCCs in carcinogenesis.

These results were in accordance with previous notion about differential potentials of cNCCs and tNCCs. We thus propose that sorting NCCs from P 0 -Cre/floxed-EGFP mice might be useful for the basic and translational research of NCCs. Furthermore, these newly-identified genes up-regulated in cNCC would provide helpful information on NC-originatin...|$|R

40|$|Carcinoma of the {{gallbladder}} (CaGB) is {{the fifth}} commonest gastrointestinal tract cancer and is endemic in several countries. The interplay of genetic susceptibility, infections, and life style factors has been proposed {{to be responsible for}} carcinogenesis of gallbladder. Persistence of infection leading to chronic inflammation, and production of certain toxins and metabolites with <b>carcinogenic</b> <b>potentials,</b> by certain bacteria has been speculated {{to be involved in the}} transformation of the gallbladder epithelium. Therefore, any bacteria that have evolved to acquire both of the above carcinogenic mechanisms can cause cancer. Salmonella typhi has been found to be prominently associated with CaGB. Chronic typhoid carriage (persistence) and production of mediators of chronic inflammation and a genotoxic toxin (cytotoxic distending toxin, CdtB) are also known for this bacterium. Furthermore, the natural concentrating function of the gallbladder might amplify the carcinogenic effect of the mediators of carcinogenesis. In addition to S. typhi, certain species of Helicobacter (H. bilis and H. hepaticus) and Escherichia coli have also been implicated in carcinogenesis. As the isolation rate is very poor with the presently available culture techniques, the existence of bacteria in a viable but non-cultivable state is quite likely; therefore, sensitive and specific molecular techniques might reveal the etiological role of bacterial infection in gallbladder carcinogenesis. If bacteria are found to be causing cancers, then eradication of such infections might help in reducing the incidence of some cancers...|$|R

The assay was examined for revertant strains of the organism with at least three alterations in the phenotypic characteristics of the wild type organism. Results obtained showed that the eight bleaching creams produced revertant strains of the organism with alteration in more than three of its phenotypic characteristics and compared favourably with the standard mutagen (ethidium bromide), which produced the same effect. Three mutation mechanisms (forward, backward and silent mutations) were identified. The introduction of liver enzymes (S 9 mix) made no significant difference in the number of characteristics altered (p> 0. 05).
