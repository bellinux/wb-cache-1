40|$|LPG {{tanks are}} {{essential}} storage device in refineries and were frequently subjected to SCC on inner surface during service {{and must be}} inspected from inside regularly. MT or PT are two conventional methods used for the inspection but is very costly and toilsome because of the requirement of scaffolding and the extreme hot working condition inside the tank. Practical experience had shown that epoxy layer may be applied on the inner surface of the LPG tanks to alleviate SCC however extra work of epoxy layer removal was required before MT or PT. In this study, an automated inspection method based on multi-channel electromagnetic technique was developed in lieu of conventional MT or PT. A remote operated scanner with magnetic rollers carrying inspection probe tracking by a video camera were incorporated in this method. Experimental results and field trials had shown that this innovational design may detect real <b>cracks</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> 10 mmL× 1 mmD in dimension and to assure the full coverage of inspection area.

40|$|Suspension {{thermal noise}} {{has become a}} {{limitation}} in {{the resolution of the}} Advanced LIGO interferometer, hindering our ability to detect gravity waves at low frequency. The present baseline solution, fused silica fibers, has many inherent problems that are difficult to overcome. Oxidation presents the most significant problem, as it weakens the fiber and lowers the quality factor, severely limiting the theoretical advantages of using fused silica as suspension material. These problems were the incentive for researching amorphous metals as an alternative material for mirror suspensions. Amorphous MoRuB samples are currently being manufactured and tested for use as flex joints for mirror suspensions. Several material properties and sample characteristics have to be measured, in particular, it is necessary to certify each flex joint uniform, compact, and free from cracks both before and after manufacturing. Certifying that each joint is free from <b>cracks</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> a level substantially smaller than the material’s catastrophic failure critical defect size (~ 100 mm for MoRuB) is equivalent to certifying that the sample will not crack unless it is exposed to stresses exceeding the material ultimate yield strength. Good joint certification allows us to fully use the material’s strength. This certification is made through X-ray imaging of the samples (in our case we used a diagnostic medical X-ray unit courtesy of the Animal Care facility at Caltech), digitizing the images using a scanner (in our case a slide scanner courtesy of Caltech’s Digital Media Center), and then analyzing the results. We developed a process that certifies a sample as being uniform (same thickness throughout and free of any holes/cracks) and therefore suitable for use as a flex-joint suspension. This certification process is also applied to all samples used to measure the material’s properties...|$|R

40|$|There are 72 isomers of the octene {{molecules}} {{and only a}} small number of them have high value as a blending octane component in gasoline. The amorphous silica alumina catalyst used for selectively dimerizing octenes from linear butenes can itself isomerize the target species. It is demonstrated that this process of equilibration leads to an overall reduction of the blending octane number. This is dependent on the different reactivities of octene isomers over the catalyst under dimerization conditions. The boundary between double bond and skeletal isomerization is explored. The linear octenes have a much higher threshold for isomerization than the branched (high octane value) species. In addition, those higher order oligomers (almost exclusively trimers and tetramers) with a large number of allylic hydrogens are considerably more reactive, but this is partially offset at higher temperatures by <b>cracking</b> back <b>down</b> <b>to</b> dimers. A mixture of selective dimerization and associated oligomer cracking emerges as the most promising route for upgrading a mixed butene monomer feed...|$|R

The two step coating with Al followed by a mixture of Al and Al 2 O 3 exhibited a slightly better corrosion resistance than the single step coating with Al.

The corroded surface of the laser surface alloyed specimens revealed a highly localized corrosion. The laser surface alloyed specimens exhibited an improvement in wear resistance.

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{introduces}} a newly developed three-dimensional Material Failure Process Analysis code, MFPA 3 D {{to model the}} failure processes of brittle materials, such as concrete, ceramics, fibrous materials, and rocks. This numerical code, based on a stress analysis method (finite element method) and a material failure constitutive law, can {{be taken as a}} tool in numerical modeling analysis to enhance our understanding of the failure mechanisms of brittle materials. Properties of material heterogeneity are taken into account. The material is discretized into numerous small elements with fixed size. Fracture behavior can be modeled by reducing the material stiffness and strength after the peak strength of the material has been reached. The evolution of the <b>cracking</b> process <b>down</b> <b>to</b> full fracture implies strain softening, which describes the post-peak gradual decline of stress at increasing strain. In the present study, a Mohr-Coulomb criterion envelop with a tension cut-off is used so that the element may fail either in shear or in tension. Simulated fracture or crack patterns of two examples are found quite realistic, and the results strongly depend on the heterogeneity level...|$|R

40|$|The {{useful life}} of {{mechanical}} components which experience highly stressed rolling/sliding contacts, such as rolling element bearings or gears, {{is limited by}} rolling contact fatigue (RCF). Surface initiated pitting is a mode of RCF which has in recent years received particular attention from industry due to its frequent occurrence in service. This work focuses on the growth behaviour of RCF cracks before they develop into surface pits. A three-contact disc machine was used to perform pitting experiments on bearing steel samples. Preliminary tests showed that surface initiated cracks could be reproduced under high contact pressure and mixed lubrication regime. However, {{it was not possible}} to detect them using the vibration monitoring system installed on the test rig. This led to the development of a high sensitivity crack detection system which employs the principle of magnetic flux leakage (MFL). The existing test rig was modified to accommodate an inductive sensor and required signal acquisition electronics. In addition, a signal processing procedure was developed to enable analysis in real time. It was shown that the MFL technique is significantly more sensitive than commonly used alternatives. The system is capable of automatically finding <b>cracks</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> about 100 ??m in length. In addition, results have shown a linear relationship between defect size and signal amplitude which enables in-situ sizing of cracks. Using the crack detector, a procedure to generate cracks and extract their growth rates was established. Crack growth was first studied under high contact pressure. It was found that initiation occurred very early in total life, which was attributed to high asperity stresses due to mixed lubrication regime. Total life to pitting was dominated by crack propagation, the speed of which was shown to depend on crack size. Small cracks grew at a steady and slightly decreasing rate until a critical size is reached at which propagation speed rapidly increases, shortly followed by pitting. Further study at lower loads confirmed that contact pressure is the main parameter controlling propagation speed. In order to identify a suitable crack propagation law, the measured crack growth rates were plotted against a stress intensity parameter expressed in terms of maximum contact pressure and crack size. The results suggest that after reaching certain length, rolling contact fatigue cracks grow according to a Paris??? type power law, where the exponent of stress intensity parameter, and therefore contact pressure, was found to be approximately 7. 5.
