25|$|Ladob is eaten {{either as}} a savoury dish or as a dessert. The dessert version usually {{consists}} of ripe plantain and sweet potatoes (but may also include cassava, breadfruit or even <b>corossol)</b> boiled with coconut milk, sugar, nutmeg and vanilla {{in the form of}} a pod until the fruit is soft and the sauce is creamy. The savoury dish usually includes salted fish, cooked in a similar fashion to the dessert version, with plantain, cassava and breadfruit, but with salt used in place of sugar (and omitting vanilla).|$|E
5000|$|Île du <b>Corossol</b> (named {{after the}} French ship <b>Corossol</b> wrecked {{on the island}} in 1693; site of a {{lighthouse}} and a bird sanctuary) ...|$|E
50|$|The gulf bottom {{surrounding}} the <b>Corossol</b> structure {{is characterized by}} a relict cuesta landscape consisting of partially eroded, gently inclined sedimentary rock layers that decreases southwards into a flat topography. The cuestas consist of steep northward-facing scarps and gentle southward-dipping slopes. Along its north side, the crater is truncated by a steep scarp of one of these cuestas and a 600 m wide and 248 m deep basin. Distinct 200 - 500 m long and 75 - 100 m wide streamlined glacial lineations cut across the southern half of the <b>Corossol</b> structure. The cuestas and associated paleovalleys likely were created by fluvial erosion during regional sea-level lowstand(s) that likely predates Quaternary glaciations. The passage of the Laurentide Ice Sheet formed the streamlined glacial lineations that cut across the southern half of the <b>Corossol</b> structure. The orientation of these lineations indicate SE-SSE-directed ice flow that scoured the surface of the <b>Corossol</b> structure.|$|E
50|$|It is {{proposed}} that the <b>Corossol</b> structure was created {{as a result of}} the impact of a meteorite of about 300 meters (980 ft) in diameter. The impact origin of the <b>Corossol</b> structure is indicated by its associated geology, faulting, fracturing, and a rock fragment recovered from the crater surface. This rock fragment exhibits, under the microscope, impact melt and shock-induced structures.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Corossol</b> is a {{quartier}} of Saint Barthélemy in the Caribbean. It {{is located}} in the northwestern part of the island.|$|E
50|$|<b>Corossol</b> {{is noted}} for its handicrafts; weaving hats and bags from palm fronds is a low income {{economic}} activity of the indigenous people.|$|E
50|$|In 2013, it {{was stated}} that the <b>Corossol</b> {{structure}} is related to a proposed impact event that is hypothesized {{to have taken place}} {{at the start of the}} Younger Dryas Episode and it supports the hypothesis that a meteorite impact triggered this cooling episode. A later paper argues that their interpretation is based on the misreading of preliminary results, including a radiocarbon date, published in a conference abstract. Later papers conclude on the basis of regional studies and the presence of till and glacial lineations cutting across the <b>Corossol</b> structure that the radiocarbon date only indicates that it was formed before deglaciation, which occurred approximately 12.7 and 12.4 cal. ka BP. Furthermore, the conference abstract did not take into account the fluvial erosion of the cuestas which support a Pre-Quaternary, possibly Paleogene or older, age for the <b>Corossol</b> structure. As a result, it was conlcuded that this structure has never been “provisionally dated to 12.9 cal. ka BP” as stated in 2013.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Corossol</b> structure, {{which is}} also known as the <b>Corossol</b> crater, is a circular, 4.3 by 3.9 km in diameter, {{underwater}} bedrock feature that is exposed on the gulf floor of the northwestern Gulf of Saint Lawrence 20 km offshore of the city of Sept-Îles, Quebec in eastern Canada. It is hypothesized to be a possible pre-Pleistocene, extraterrestrial impact structure. It lies underwater at a depth of 40 - 208 m. This underwater feature was found during the study of high-resolution bathymetric and sub-bottom profiler data collected south of the city of Sept-Iles in the northwestern Gulf of Saint Lawrence.|$|E

50|$|Gustavia is {{also known}} as a haven for yachting, with many events being held there each year. These include the St Barths Bucket Regatta, the Saint Barth’s Cup and Les Voiles de St. Barth in April, and the International Regatta in May. Deep sea fishing is also {{undertaken}} from the waterfront of Lorient, Flamands and <b>Corossol</b> to fish for tuna, marlin, bonito, barracuda and wahoo. St Barth Open Fishing tournament is held in July.|$|E
50|$|The central uplift, {{associated}} central cavity, brim, {{and rings}} likely represent both deformation and differential erosion of sedimentary rocks of the Ordovician Saint. Lawrence Platform. The sedimentary strata surrounding the <b>Corossol</b> structure show no deformation. However, seismic data reveal {{that they are}} highly fractured {{by a series of}} 10 - 15 m deep faults. These faults also are associated with the concentric rings and form the irregular topography of the structure’s brim.|$|E
5000|$|Popular fresh juices {{are made}} from bissap, ginger, buy (pronounced 'buoy', which is {{the fruit of the}} baobab tree, also known as [...] "monkey bread fruit"), mango, or other fruit or wild trees (most famously soursop, which is called <b>corossol</b> in French). Desserts are very rich and sweet, {{combining}} native ingredients with the extravagance and style characteristic of the French impact on Senegal’s culinary methods. They are often served with fresh fruit and are traditionally followed by coffee or tea.|$|E
50|$|The precise, {{absolute}} {{age of the}} <b>Corossol</b> structure remains undetermined. It geological {{setting and}} cross-cutting relationships indicate that it was created long after the Middle Ordovician (470 million years ago) and before the accumulation of glacial till and creation of streamlined lineations, which are interpreted as subglacially produced mega-scale glacial lineations, on its surface. The relict cuestas and evidence of fluvial erosion observed on the outer walls of the structure, imply it was formed {{during one of the}} periods of regional lowstand of sea level prior to the Quaternary glaciations.|$|E

50|$|The <b>Corossol</b> {{structure}} has a maximum diameter of 4.3 km and rises 25 m above the surrounding sea floor. At its center, there is central uplift is 0.9 - 1 km {{in diameter and}} rises to the same elevation as the crater rim {{to a depth of}} about 755 m {{below the surface of the}} Gulf of St Lawrence. This uplift lies within a 2 - 2.4 km in diameter and 185 m deep circular central cavity. The central cavity is surrounded by a 90 - 1300 m wide brim. In addition, three concentric rings form narrow (290 m wide), shallow, and discontinuous depressions around the central cavity.|$|E
50|$|A common {{practice}} during the postpartum period is the “three baths.” In {{the first three}} days, the mother bathes in fortified water prepared from boiling special herbs in the water, including papaya, sour orange, sour soup (<b>corossol),</b> mint (ti baume), anise, bugleweed and eucalyptus. These herbs relax the mother and cause her muscles to tighten. This {{is known as the}} first bath. Mothers are also encouraged to drink a special tea made from the same mixture. The second bath occurs after the three-day mark for another three days where the mother bathes in herb-fortified water that is warmed by the sun, not boiled. The third bath occurs at the one-month mark and is a cold bath, the first one the mother takes since delivery. A cold bath is done to promote healing and tightening of the muscles and bones loosened during delivery.|$|E
