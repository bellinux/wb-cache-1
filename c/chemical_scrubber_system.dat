5000|$|<b>Scrubber</b> <b>systems</b> (aka <b>Chemical</b> <b>Scrubbers,</b> Gas Scrubbers) are {{a diverse}} group of air {{pollution}} control devices {{that can be used to}} remove some particulates and/or gases from industrial exhaust streams. The first air scrubber was designed to remove carbon dioxide from the air of an early submarine, the Ictineo I, a role for which they continue to be used till today. Traditionally, the term [...] "scrubber" [...] has referred to pollution control devices that use liquid to wash unwanted pollutants from a gas stream. Recently, the term has also been used to describe systems that inject a dry reagent or slurry into a dirty exhaust stream to [...] "wash out" [...] acid gases. Scrubbers are one of the primary devices that control gaseous emissions, especially acid gases. Scrubbers can also be used for heat recovery from hot gases by flue-gas condensation. [...] They are also used for the high flows in solar, PV, or LED processes.|$|R
40|$|Biological {{treatment}} is a promising alternative to conventional air-pollution control methods, but thus far biotreatment processes for odor control have always required much larger reactor volumes than <b>chemical</b> <b>scrubbers.</b> We converted an existing full-scale <b>chemical</b> <b>scrubber</b> to a biological trickling filter {{and showed that}} effective treatment of hydrogen sulfide (H 2 S) in the converted scrubber was possible even at gas contact times as low as 1. 6 s. That is 8 – 20 times shorter than previous biotrickling filtration reports and comparable to usual contact times in <b>chemical</b> <b>scrubbers.</b> Significant removal of reduced sulfur compounds, ammonia, and volatile organic compounds present in traces in the air was also observed. Continuous operation for > 8 months showed stable performance and robust behavior for H 2 S treatment, with pollutant-removal performance comparable to that achieved by using a <b>chemical</b> <b>scrubber.</b> Our study demonstrates that biotrickling filters can replace <b>chemical</b> <b>scrubbers</b> and be a safer, more economical technique for odor control...|$|R

30|$|Following the cyclones, the hot syngas is {{routed through}} a quench venturi <b>scrubber</b> <b>system</b> to cool and scrub any {{remaining}} particulates, condensable organic particulate contaminants, gases, and other contaminants. First, hot syngas from the cyclones is {{passed through a}} series of water-spray quench vessels, which cool the syngas and coagulate and remove the bulk of micro-particles and contaminants. The cooled syngas then passes through a venturi scrubber to remove particles down to 0.5 – 1  µm in size. The syngas is next routed through an optional air cooler and then into a vertical packed-bed tower <b>scrubber</b> <b>system.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Various {{carbon dioxide}} {{scrubbing}} processes {{have been proposed}} to remove [...] from the air, usually using {{a variant of the}} Kraft process.

2500|$|The {{pilot plant}} in Carthage was {{temporarily}} shut down due to smell complaints. It was soon restarted {{when it was}} discovered that few of the odors were generated by the plant.

40|$|Pharmaceutical {{processes}} involving {{difficult to}} control off-gases are often transferred from the laboratory to the pilot plant without {{development and implementation of}} efficient gas scrubber operations. Two case studies are presented which involve effective scrubber design for mitigation of low boiling point volatile organic compounds (VOCs) based on scale-up from a laboratory bubble column to a pilot plant packed column, including: (1) a toluene/methanesulfonic acid (MSA) <b>scrubber</b> <b>system</b> to mitigate isobutylene emissions from tert-butoxycarbonyl (BOC) deprotection reactions, and (2) an aqueous ethanolamine <b>scrubber</b> <b>system</b> specifically to remove methyl bromide liberated during a demethylation process. On-line vapor phase mass spectrometry (MS) was used as a tool to aid in scrubber development, monitor reaction off-gas generation, and quantify scrubber efficiency on both laboratory and pilot plant scales to ensure safe and environmentally benign processes. The scale-up methodology involved determining the required pilot plant packed column superficial liquid velocity based on an equivalent physical liquid phase mass transfer coefficient (kL) for the laboratory bubble column. Utilizing an equivalent kL value upon scale-up resulted in essentially the same scrubber efficiency for both the isobutylene and methyl bromide <b>scrubber</b> <b>systems.</b> The acceptable isobutylene and methyl bromide loading rates for the pilot plant scrubber were determined based on the respective laboratory scale gas absorption rates for a fast, irreversible first order reaction of isobutylene in toluene and methyl bromide in ethanolamine. The scrubber design methodology was applied to a third case study involving an aqueous oxone <b>scrubber</b> <b>system</b> for mitigating dimethyl sulfide vapors/odors, such that pilot plant hydrodynamic factors and potential processing scale were determined based on laboratory results. Utilization of the scrubber design methodology eliminated the need for pilot plant experiments prior to scale-up. ...|$|R

40|$|Potassium {{permanganate}} (KMnO 4) {{was evaluated}} for application in removing mercury vapor from exhaust air systems. The KMnO 4 {{may be used}} in water solution with a liquid spray <b>scrubber</b> <b>system</b> or as a solid adsorber bed material when impregnated onto a zeolite. Air samples contaminated with as much as 112 mg/cu m of mercury were scrubbed to 0. 06 mg/cum with the KMnO 4 -impregnated zeolite (molecular sieve material). The water spray solution of permanganate was also found to be as effective as the impregnated zeolite. The KMnO 4 -impregnated zeolite was applied as a solid adsorber material to (1) a hardware decontamination system, (2) a model incinerator, and (3) a high vacuum chamber for ion engine testing with mercury as the propellant. A liquid <b>scrubber</b> <b>system</b> was also applied in an incinerator system.

5000|$|Biological {{scrubbers}} are structurally {{identical to}} the wet media scrubbers, but vary in their design. The vessel {{is designed to be}} larger, so the air moves slower through the vessel. The media is designed to encourage biological growth, and the water that sprays through the vessel is filled with nutrients to encourage bacteria to grow. In such scrubbers, the bacteria scrub the pollutant. Also, instead of a single, large support system (typically 10 feet depth of media for <b>chemical</b> <b>scrubbers),</b> there are multiple stages of media support, that can change the design requirements of the vessel. (See biofilter for similar technology that is usually performed outside of an FRP vessel.) ...|$|R

40|$|Of the hace {{elements}} {{known to}} exist in fossil fuels, mercury (Hg) has {{emerged as one of}} the greatest concerns. Mercury has been found to be emitted from combustion in at least two different chemical forms: elemental Hg and oxidized Hg compounds. Precise identification of the oxidized compounds emitted has not been accomplished to date. However, most workers in this field assume that mercuric chloride should be the predominant oxidized species. Mercuric chloride should be readily removed In a wet <b>scrubber</b> <b>system</b> because of its relatively high solubility in water. However, it has been presumed, and we have shown, that elemental Hg will pass through a wet <b>scrubber</b> <b>system</b> with little or no removal being effected. Therefore, it is important, in order to obtain a high total Hg removal, to study methods that might result in a removal of gaseous, elemental Hg from a flue-gas stream. In this regard, we have been studying the effect of dilute halogen-containing solutions on elemental Hg in gas streams of various compositions. In particular, the results of passing Hg through bubblers containing solutions of iodine, chlorine, and chloric acid are described. Mercury found in the bubbler solutions is an indication of the extent of reaction (oxidation) of elemental Hg with the halogen species, since we have found very little H...|$|R
