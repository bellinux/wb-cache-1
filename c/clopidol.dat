40|$|ABSTRACT The {{anticoccidial}} agent monensin {{has been}} tested in 5 floor-pen experi-ments and compared with unmedicated and with positive control treatments (amprolium + ethopabate in 4, <b>clopidol</b> in 2 and zoalene in 1 experiment). Severity of coccidiosis ex-posure was increased by an oocyst-seeding technique, increasing litter moisture content to 30 % or higher, and various attempts to prevent early development of immunity. Coccidio-sis-associated mortality occurred in only 0. 06 % of 1 SS 2 birds on monensin (with or with-out roxarsone), 1. 41 % of 1556 birds on amprolium + ethopabate (with or without roxar-sone), 0. 05 % of 200 birds on zoalene (with roxarsone), 0 % of 401 birds on <b>clopidol</b> (with roxarsone) and 6. 0 % of 1750 birds on unmedicated feed. Coccidiosis-associated mortality occurred in 1 / 31 pens on monensin (when fed at the recommended level), 15 / 31 pens on amprolium plus ethopabate, 1 / 4 on zoalene, 0 / 8 on <b>clopidol</b> and 33 / 45 pens on unmedi-cated feed. Weight gains of monensin-medicated treatments (with or without roxarsone) were significantly greater (P < 0. 05) in 16 / 17 possible treatment comparisons with un-medicated birds. Feed conversion was improved in 11 / 17 comparisons. Monensin and other anticoccidial agents partially or completely suppressed development of lesions and lesio...|$|E

40|$|Anticoccidial {{drugs were}} {{evaluated}} for activity {{and for the}} development of resistance in a model of Toxoplasma gondii growing in human fibroblast cultures. Of 13 anticoccidial drugs tested, 9 had selective antitoxoplasma activity (50 % inhibitory concentration, in micrograms per milliliter) : decoquinate (0. 005), arprinocid-N-oxide (0. 015), robenidine (0. 03), the aryl triazine CP- 25, 415 (0. 2), toltrazuril (0. 4), <b>clopidol</b> (1), dinitolmide (Zoalene; Dow) (10), and the carboxylic acid ionophores monensin (0. 001) and salinomycin (0. 04). Glycarbylamide, amprolium, nicarbazin, and the 6 -(p-bromophenoxy) - 7 -chloro analog of halofuginone (Stenorol; Roussel-UCLAF) (CP- 63, 567) were toxic for the fibroblasts. Since Eimeria tenella has a similar drug susceptibility profile, anticoccidial durgs {{can be viewed as a}} potential source of new antitoxoplasma therapies. The development of resistance has limited the usefulness of most of these drugs as anticoccidial agents; in coccidia, resistance to all except the ionophores occurs readily in vivo. We explored the development of resistance in T. gondii by attempting to select mutants in vitro from parasites mutagenized with ethylnitrosourea. Mutants that had 20 - to 50 -fold-reduced susceptibility to decoquinate, arprinocid-N-oxide, and CP- 25, 415 were obtained. Ionophore-resistant T. gondii mutants were also selected in vitro; however, there was only a twofold difference in susceptibility between these mutants and the wild type. For three drugs (<b>clopidol,</b> robenidine, and toltrazuril), we were unable to select resistant mutants. For experimental anticoccidial drugs, there is currently no in vitro method for assessing the risk of development of resistance in Eimeria species. Our results suggest that T. gondii may offer a useful surrogate for this assessment...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Monensin, admixed {{with the}} feed {{at a level}} of 0. 0125 %, {{adequately}} protected chickens against experimental infections of Eimeria tenella initiated by a strain that had no previous exposure to drugs as well as by strains resistant to amprolium, arsenosobenzene, buquinoiate, <b>clopidol,</b> decoquinate, glycarbylamide, nequinate, nicarbazin, nitrofurazone, Nova-stat, Trithiadol, Unistat, or zoalene, respectively. When fed to uninfected chickens, monensin did not affect rate of gain to a significant degree in three of four replicates. Moreover, an analysis of the aggregate data did not indicate a significant difference in rate of gain between the uninfected group.

40|$|Coccidiosis is an {{economically}} important enteric disease of poultry caused by protozoan parasites {{belonging to the}} genus Eimeria. Drugs are most commonly used to control coccidiosis. Widespread usage of anticoccidial drugs in the field has resulted in development of drug resistant strains and consequently decreased drug efficacy. An alternative control strategy using attenuated vaccines is desired. A series of experiments was designed to identify, isolate and attenuate a strain of a common and pathogenic species of Eimeria of turkeys, E. meleagrimitis. Sensitivity of field isolates of turkey coccidia to the anticoccidials drugs amprolium, <b>clopidol,</b> diclazuril, and monensin was investigated. A total of thirty-four isolates comprising mixed species from farms across the country were tested. Of these, four isolates were sensitive to monensin, twelve sensitive to diclazuril, and seventeen sensitive to <b>clopidol</b> and none to amprolium. One isolate, designated MN 2, was sensitive to three drugs tested and was selected for further investigation. The different Eimeria species present in the isolates were identified using polymerase chain reaction amplification of cox- 1 gene and E. meleagrimitis {{was the most common}} species seen. A pure clone of E. meleagrimitis was developed and the pathogenicity and fecundity of the isolated E. meleagrimitis strain was tested and compared to a standard reference E. meleagrimitis strain. Data from the parameters tested showed that the strain had the same characteristics as that of the reference strain. An attenuated line of E. meleagrimitis was developed by repeated propagation of the parasite in turkeys and collection of the very first oocysts produced following infection. After twenty generations of selection, a line with abbreviated life cycle of - 16 h was developed. Pathogenicity and immunogenicity of this line was tested and compared with the parent strain. The attenuated line was proven to be non-pathogenic but was immunogenic. The developed line is a candidate for attenuated vaccine against turkey coccidiosis...|$|E
40|$|Four {{veterinary}} drugs of dissimilar chemical structures were evaluated for environmental stability and penchant for bioaccumulation. The techniques used were (1) a model aquatic ecosystem (3 days) and (2) a model feedlot ecosystem (33 days) {{in which the}} drugs were introduced via the excreta of chicks or mice. The model feedlot ecosystem was supported by metabolism cage studies to determine the amount and {{the form of the}} drug excreted by the chicks or mice.

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the level of awareness and usage of anticoccidial drugs and vaccines by poultry farms in southwestern geopolitical zones of Nigeria, using Lagos, Oyo, and Ogun states. A researcher-made questionnaire was administered to the selected poultry farms, poultry attendants and veterinarians.

Information was obtained on the mode of administration, treatment programming strategy {{as well as the}} poultry farmers ’ awareness and usage of the anticoccidial agents (drugs and vaccines).

40|$|A {{confirmatory method}} has been {{developed}} {{to allow for the}} analysis of fourteen prohibited medicinal additives in pig and poultry compound feed. These compounds are prohibited for use as feed additives although some are still authorised for use in medicated feed. Feed samples are extracted by acetonitrile with addition of sodium sulphate. The extracts undergo a hexane wash to aid with sample purification. The extracts are then evaporated to dryness and reconstituted in initial mobile phase. The samples undergo an ultracentrifugation step prior to injection onto the LC-MS/MS system and are analysed in a run time of 26 minutes. The LC-MS/MS system is run in MRM mode with both positive and negative electrospray ionisation. The method was validated over three days and is capable of quantitatively analysing for metronidazole, dimetridazole, ronidazole, ipronidazole, chloramphenicol, sulfadiazine, sulfamethazine, dinitolimide, ethopabate, carbadox and <b>clopidol.</b> The method is also capable of qualitatively analysing for tylosin, virginiamycin and avilamycin. A level of 100 μg kg- 1 was used for validation purposes and the method is capable of analysing to this level for all the compounds. Validation criteria of trueness, precision, repeatability and reproducibility along with measurement uncertainty are calculated for all analytes...|$|E
