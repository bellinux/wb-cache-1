In {{response to this}} problem, several methods are proposed that render metrics more meaningful. The methods employed are <b>calibration</b> <b>procedures.</b> Three <b>calibration</b> <b>procedures</b> are illustrated that prove to be extremely powerful in making the metrics of two related measures more understandable. Establishing the behavioral implications of the scores, computing just noticeable differences, and calibrating between measures are the three procedures described and illustrated.

Reducing the energy use of existing homes in the United States offers significant energy-saving opportunities, which can be identified through building simulation software tools that calculate optimal packages of efficiency measures. To improve the accuracy of energy analysis for residential buildings, the National Renewable Energy Laboratory's (NREL) Buildings Research team developed the Building Energy Simulation Test for Existing Homes (BESTEST-EX), a method for diagnosing and correcting errors in building energy audit software and <b>calibration</b> <b>procedures.</b> BESTEST-EX consists of building physics and utility bill calibration test cases, which software developers can use to compare their tools simulation findings to reference results generated with state-of-the-art simulation tools. Overall, the BESTEST-EX methodology: (1) Tests software predictions of retrofit energy savings in existing homes; (2) Ensures building physics calculations and utility bill <b>calibration</b> <b>procedures</b> perform to a minimum standard; and (3) Quantifies impacts of uncertainties in input audit data and occupant behavior.
