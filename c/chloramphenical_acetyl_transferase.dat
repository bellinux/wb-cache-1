40|$|The {{expression}} of <b>chloramphenical</b> <b>acetyl</b> <b>transferase</b> (CAT) protein {{driven by the}} wound-inducible promoter from the proteinase inhibitor II K (pin 2) gene was examined in whole tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L.) plants under field conditions. Mechanical wounding of the field-grown leaves caused an accumulation of CAT protein in these leaves which begins several hours after wounding and continues to accumulate for about 36 hours. When sections of leaves were assayed for accumulation of CAT protein following wounding, the CAT protein was found to accumulate in the apical portions of the leaves. When endogenous insects attacked the leaves of transgenic plants grown in the field, the plants responded by inducing CAT protein. The mesophyll cells of the leaf were the site of {{expression of}} the CAT protein rather than the mid-vein or major veins within the leaf blade, indicating that the wound-inducible pin 2 promoter specifically directs the synthesis of novel genes in tissues preferentially consumed by larval insects...|$|E
40|$|Addition of the {{transcriptional}} enhancers {{present in}} the U 3 region of the Harvey murine sarcoma virus (HaMuSV) long terminal repeat (LTR) to recombinant chimeras in which the HaMuSV transforming gene (Ha-v-ras) is expressed from the mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) promoter increases {{the ability of the}} MMTV v-ras chimeras to transform mouse fibroblasts in culture 50 - to 100 -fold. Significant stimulation of transfection efficiency occurs only when glucocorticoids are {{present in the}} culture medium. Glucocorticoids also elevate the steady-state concentration of MMTV-initiated v-ras mRNA in cell lines isolated from these transfections, and MMTV-v-ras fusion transcripts are initiated at the normal MMTV cap site; potential cryptic initiation events associated with the enhancer could not be detected. The ability of the enhancer to increase the transcriptional activity of the MMTV promoter was also studied in acute transfection assays where expression of the <b>chloramphenical</b> <b>acetyl</b> <b>transferase</b> (CAT) gene is driven by the MMTV promoter. In this system the strong positive effect on MMTV transcription is again obtained only when the cells are hormone treated. These experiments indicate that the hormone-regulatory region is capable of modulating the function of an exogenously introduced enhancer element...|$|E
40|$|During oocyte maturation, cyclin B 1 mRNA is {{translationally}} {{activated by}} cytoplasmic polyadenylation. This process {{is dependent on}} cytoplasmic polyadenylation elements (CPEs) in the 3 ' untranslated region (UTR) of the mRNA. To determine whether a titratable factor might {{be involved in the}} initial translational repression (masking) of this mRNA, high levels of cyclin B 1 3 ' UTR were injected into oocytes. While this treatment had no effect on the poly(A) tail length of endogenous cyclin B 1 mRNA, it induced cyclin B 1 synthesis. A mutational analysis revealed that the most efficient unmasking element in the cyclin 3 ' UTR was the CPE. However, other U-rich sequences that resemble the CPE in structure, but which do not bind the CPE-binding polyadenylation factor CPEB, failed to induce unmasking. When fused to the <b>chloramphenical</b> <b>acetyl</b> <b>transferase</b> (CAT) coding region, the cyclin B 1 3 ' UTR inhibited CAT translation in injected oocytes. In addition, a synthetic 3 ' UTR containing multiple copies of the CPE also inhibited translation, and did so in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, efficient CPE-mediated masking required cap-dependent translation. During the normal course of progesterone-induced maturation, cytoplasmic polyadenylation was necessary for mRNA unmasking. A model to explain how cyclin B 1 mRNA masking and unmasking could be regulated by the CPE is presented...|$|E

Methods: Fischer rats were divided into three main groups: (1) Nontransplant setting: Liposome–chloramphenicol <b>acetyl</b> <b>transferase</b> cDNA was intravenously injected, and lungs were harvested at different time points: 2, 6, 12, and 24 hours; 2, 5, 8, and 21 days (n = 3). Chloramphenicol <b>acetyl</b> <b>transferase</b> activity was determined in lungs, hearts, livers, and kidneys. The distribution and type of transfected cells were evaluated by in situ hybridization. Lung toxicity was assessed by arterial oxygen tension, histology, and tumor necrosis factor–α levels. (2) In vivo graft transfection: Left lungs were transplanted 6 hours, 4 hours, and 15 minutes after intravenous injection and were assessed for chloramphenicol <b>acetyl</b> <b>transferase</b> activity and arterial oxygen tension on postoperative day 2. (3) Ex vivo graft transfection: Grafts were infused ex vivo with either 660 μg (n = 3) or 330 μg (n = 3) of DNA complexed to liposomes and stored at 10 ° C for 4 hours. Chloramphenicol <b>acetyl</b> <b>transferase</b> activity was assessed 44 hours after transplantation. Results: Transgene expression was detected in endothelial cells, macrophages, and interstitial cells. Chloramphenicol <b>acetyl</b> <b>transferase</b> activity was present as early as 2 hours, increased significantly between 6 hours and 8 days, and then decreased to minimal levels by 21 days. Chloramphenicol <b>acetyl</b> <b>transferase</b> activity was greatest in donor lungs and hearts and minimal in livers and kidneys. Arterial oxygen tension was normal in treated animals. Inflammation was minimal, and tumor necrosis factor–α levels increased only sevenfold in treated animals.

40|$|AbstractObjective: Liposomes {{may be an}} {{appropriate}} transfection vehicle for transplanted hearts, avoiding the use of viruses in immunosuppressed hosts and allowing transfection of nondividing cells. To study whether liposome-mediated transfection could be accomplished during transplantation, we used a liposome-reporter gene system in a rabbit model of allograft cardiac transplantation. Methods: After aortic crossclamping, Stauffland donor hearts were injected with 10 ml Stanford cardioplegic solution; then a 1. 3 to 2. 0 mg/kg dose of chloramphenicol <b>acetyl</b> <b>transferase</b> in 1 : 1 deoxyribonucleic acid–liposome complexes was injected proximal to the aortic crossclamp for coronary artery perfusion. The hearts were transplanted into New Zealand White rabbit recipients in the heterotopic cervical position (n = 11 transplants). Recipients were sacrificed at 24 hours. Myocardial specimens (right and left ventricles) and vascular specimens (epicardial coronary artery, aortic root, and coronary sinus) from both the transplanted and native hearts were analyzed for chloramphenicol <b>acetyl</b> <b>transferase</b> protein {{by means of the}} enzymatic liquid scintillation assay (counts per minute per milligram of total protein). Results: In the recipient, myocardial chloramphenicol <b>acetyl</b> <b>transferase</b> activity was significantly greater in treated donor hearts (mean 4. 6 × 105 cpm/mg ± 1. 1 × 105 [standard error]) than in native hearts (mean 4. 1 × 102 cpm/mg ± 72 [standard error], p < 0. 01, Mann-Whitney U test). In treated donor hearts, right and left ventricular specimens, as well as apical and basal myocardial specimens, were transfected equally. Chloramphenicol <b>acetyl</b> <b>transferase</b> activity in vascular specimens also indicated transfection (mean 5. 4 × 105 cpm/mg ± 2. 5 × 105 [standard error]). Chloramphenicol <b>acetyl</b> <b>transferase</b> activity in the coronary sinus was comparable with that in the coronary arteries, which suggests that liposomes can traverse the coronary capillary beds. Conclusions: These findings demonstrate that ex vivo transfection of donor hearts with a liposome-reporter gene system results in significant in vivo expression of the transfected gene product after cardiac transplantation. Genetic alteration of myocardium and cardiac vasculature has potential clinical applications in the prevention of posttransplantation rejection, ischemia-reperfusion injury, and both transplant and nontransplant coronary artery disease.

40|$|HIV Tat, a transactivator of viral {{transcription}}, represses transcription {{of major}} histocompatibility (MHC) class I genes. Repression depends {{exclusively on the}} C-terminal domain of Tat, although the mechanism of this repression has not been known. We now show that repression results from the interaction of Tat with the TAFII 250 component of the general transcription factor, TFIID. The C-terminal domain of Tat binds to a site on TAFII 250 that overlaps the histone <b>acetyl</b> <b>transferase</b> domain, inhibiting TAFII 250 histone <b>acetyl</b> <b>transferase</b> activity. Furthermore, promoters repressed by Tat, including the MHC class I promoter, are dependent on TAFII 250 whereas {{those that are not}} repressed by Tat, such as SV 40 and MuLV promoters, are independent of functional TAFII 250. Thus, Tat repression of MHC class I transcription would be one mechanism by which HIV avoids immune surveillance...|$|R

40|$|Ultraviolet {{irradiation}} stimulates keratinocytes and dermal fibroblasts {{to release}} cytokines involved in apoptosis and immunomodulation, such as tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukin- 1 α. Recent work has associated the - 308 A polymorphism {{of the human}} tumor necrosis factor-α promoter with systemic lupus erythematosus and adverse outcomes in several infectious diseases. To explore the role of this polymorphism in ultraviolet-induced disease, we used two approaches. First, we examined its prevalence in individuals with different ultraviolet sensitivity. Compared with healthy controls, there was a substantially increased prevalence of - 308 A in subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus, an extremely photosensitive form of cutaneous lupus erythematosus, but not in discoid lupus erythematosus, a less photosensitive form. Next, to examine molecular regulation by tumor necrosis factor - 308 A, cultured 3 T 3 fibroblasts were transiently transfected with chloramphenicol <b>acetyl</b> <b>transferase</b> reporter constructs {{under the control of}} either - 308 A or the wild-type - 308 G promoter. Without added interleukin- 1 α the two constructs produced similar baseline chloramphenicol <b>acetyl</b> <b>transferase</b> activity and similar responses to ultraviolet. The responses to interleukin- 1 α, a photoinduced cytokine, were markedly different: interleukin- 1 α without ultraviolet produced a 15 -fold increase in chloramphenicol <b>acetyl</b> <b>transferase</b> transcription from the - 308 A construct without affecting the wild-type - 308 G. Interleukin- 1 α plus ultraviolet B caused a remarkable 300 -fold increase in - 308 A chloramphenicol <b>acetyl</b> <b>transferase</b> transcription over baseline, while increasing the wild type to < 15 % of this level. These results indicate a clear difference between the two promoters, including a striking synergy between ultraviolet B and added interleukin- 1 α in the induction of transcription by the tumor necrosis factor-α- 308 A promoter. Overall, our findings indicate a strong linkage between the - 308 A polymorphism and subacute systemic lupus erythematosus, which is likely to directly contribute to the photosensitivity of these patients...|$|R

40|$|Expression of {{herpes simplex}} virus genes at the {{initiation}} of replication involves two steps that take place at ND 10 nuclear bodies. These are suppression of cellular repressors that attempt to silence viral DNA and remodeling of the viral chromatin to make it accessible for transcription. In earlier studies we reported on the mechanism by which viral proteins ICP 0 and US 3 protein kinase modify and disrupt the HDAC 1 /CoREST/REST/LSD 1 repressor complex. The remodeling step requires in addition acetylation of histones bound to DNA. In an attempt to identify the enzyme, we took note of the observation that ICP 0 physically and functionally interacts with Bmal 1, a partner of the CLOCK histone <b>acetyl</b> <b>transferase,</b> and {{key members of the}} bHLH–PAS family of transcriptional factors. The Bmal 11 and CLOCK heterodimer is best known as a regulator of the circadian oscillation in the mammalian CLOCK system. In this article we report the following: (i) in infected cells both Bmal 1 and CLOCK localize at ND 10 bodies; (ii) wild-type virus stabilizes the CLOCK protein; (iii) overexpression of CLOCK partially compensates for the absence of ICP 0 and enables higher yields in cells infected with a ΔICP 0 mutant and this activity is not expressed by CLOCK mutants lacking histone <b>acetyl</b> <b>transferase</b> activity; and (iv) depletion of CLOCK in cells infected with wild-type virus results in significant decrease in the expression of all viral proteins tested.

To determine whether pTpT mimics the suppressive influence of ultraviolet-B on contact hypersensitivity, we compared the effects of topical application of pTpT with those of ultraviolet-B irradiation on C 57 BL/ 6 mice sensitized to dinitrofluorobenzene. Mice pretreated with pTpT or ultraviolet-B irradiation showed markedly suppressed ear swelling responses to dinitrofluorobenzene challenge. Because tumor necrosis factor α mediates ultraviolet-B-induced suppression of contact hypersensitivity, and because pTpT exerts many ultraviolet-mimetic effects by augmenting mRNA and protein levels of effector molecules, we asked if pTpT mimics ultraviolet-B’s upregulatory influence on tumor necrosis factor α expression. Using transgenic mice carrying a chloramphenicol <b>acetyl</b> <b>transferase</b> reporter linked to the tumor necrosis factor α promoter, we examined effects of ultraviolet-B irradiation versus intradermal injection of pTpT on tumor necrosis factor α gene transcription. Both treatments induced cutaneous chloramphenicol <b>acetyl</b> <b>transferase</b> activity. Ultra- violet-B or pTpT treatment of cultured dermal fibroblasts from these mice also stimulated chloramphenicol <b>acetyl</b> <b>transferase</b> activity. To determine whether human cells responded similarly, a well- differentiated ultraviolet-responsive human squamous cell carcinoma line was treated with pTpT. pTpT increased tumor necrosis factor α mRNA expression and protein secretion in a dose-dependent manner.

Subsequently acetyl-CoA, at the time called “active acetate,” was discovered in 1951. [...] The 3D structure of rat-derived ChAT was not solved until nearly 60 years later, in 2004.|$|R

We previously identified a family of neurogenic 3, 5 -disubstituted isoxazoles (Isx) that increased expression of neurogenic differentiation 1 (NeuroD 1, also known as BETA 2); this transcription factor functions in neuronal and pancreatic β-cell differentiation and is essential for insulin gene transcription. Here, we probed effects of Isx on human cadaveric islets and MIN 6 pancreatic β cells. Isx increased the expression and secretion of insulin in islets that made little insulin after prolonged ex vivo culture and increased expression of neurogenic differentiation 1 and other regulators of islet differentiation and insulin gene transcription. Within the first few hours of exposure, Isx caused biphasic activation of ERK 1 / 2 and increased bulk histone acetylation. Although there was little effect on histone deacetylase activity, Isx increased histone <b>acetyl</b> <b>transferase</b> activity in nuclear extracts. Reconstitution assays indicated that Isx increased {{the activity of the}} histone <b>acetyl</b> <b>transferase</b> p 300 through an ERK 1 / 2 -dependent mechanism. In summary, we have identified a small molecule with antidiabetic activity, providing a tool for exploring islet function and a possible lead for therapeutic intervention in diabetes...|$|R
