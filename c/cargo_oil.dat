Arriving 3 June Caliente fueled dozens of ships in the lagoon and, in mid-June, supported the task forces during the Saipan landings. On 7 July, despite numerous submarine contacts, the oiler refueled the U.S. 5th Fleet carriers on their return from the Philippine Sea battles. For the remainder of the month, as part of Operation Forager, she carried logistical supplies, mostly diesel and black oil, from Enewetak to ships off Saipan. Caliente even made a run to Pearl Harbor, arriving 12 August, to assist the civilian tankers in the unending task of transporting oil and avgas to the fuel-guzzling carriers off the Marianas.|$|E
50|$|Port of Corpus Christi handles {{break bulk}} cargo, project <b>cargo,</b> <b>oil</b> and gas, dry bulk, agricultural, {{refrigerated}} cargo, and containerized cargo, among other commodities. Cotton {{was the main}} cargo in its early days, and is still traded through the port today. Texas is now the top wind energy production state in the United States, producing more wind energy than all but five countries (the U.S., Germany, Spain, China, and India), thus creating an increased demand for wind turbines. These turbines are also a main cargo moving through Port Corpus Christi. In 2009, the US Army Corps of Engineers approved the dredging of La Quinta Channel extension ahead {{of the construction of}} the La Quinta multipurpose facility. This facility (in construction phase, 2011) will provide Port Corpus Christi with the ability to handle an estimated 1 million 20-foot equivalent units annually.|$|E
50|$|On 20 November, after loading 97,975 {{barrels of}} black oil from , {{as well as}} a full load of avgas, diesel, and <b>cargo</b> <b>oil,</b> Caliente lay at anchor {{awaiting}} a destination. Ulithi, a regulating station of the Logistics Division, Pacific Fleet, had been deemed safe from enemy interference yet close enough to serve as a transshipment point for the forward operating areas. But on 20 November the Japanese struck at this logistical lifeline. At 0547 hours the oiler , a sister ship of Caliente, was hit by a kaiten, a Japanese manned torpedo, and burst into flames. The Mississinewa was occupying a berth originally meant for the Caliente. Caliente and the other oilers, to protect their volatile cargo, steamed out of the harbor. While at least three of the attackers were sunk the Mississinewa, having just loaded 107,000 barrels of fuel in her hold, exploded and sank, killing 60 of her crew.|$|E
50|$|When in August 1970, Volgotanker's Nefterudovoz-3 {{arrived to}} Kandalaksha, {{it was the}} first tanker ever to bring a <b>cargo</b> of <b>oil</b> {{directly}} from the Volga basin over the White Sea-Baltic Canal and into the White Sea.|$|R
50|$|Næss {{was always}} searching for {{increased}} efficiency, {{and the long}} voyages ballasted for tankers posed an intriguing problem. In the mid of the 1950s he started {{to think about a}} combination ship that could carry both <b>oil</b> and bulk <b>cargoes.</b> <b>Oil</b> and ore ships had been in operation since the 1920s, but a vessel with the capability of carrying both <b>oil</b> and bulk <b>cargoes</b> seemed impossible to construct. Næss pushed his chief naval architect T. M. Karlsen to keep researching the combined vessel, also checking in on various failed projects like the Mando Theodoracopulos. One of the deficiencies of that vessel was the small hatches, too small for efficient discharging.|$|R

5000|$|At 0434 on 10 September, while {{maneuvering}} in a hazy half-light, Schuylkills bow {{struck her}} sister ship [...] on her quarter. Schuylkill received a large V-shaped hole on her starboard side. She immediately pumped about 25,000 gal {{of fresh water}} from the fore peak tank and transferred <b>cargo</b> <b>oil</b> from forward to after tanks to raise her bow. Unable to proceed until her bulkheads were shored up, the oiler fueled five ships while stopped. After temporary repair, {{she was able to}} get underway at 4 knots; and, as the fueling of more vessels raised the hole further above her water line, she doubled her speed. In all, Schuylkill delivered [...] of fuel oil on that day, earning a [...] "well done" [...] from the task group commander. Schuylkill carried out her scheduled fuel replenishment duty until relief tankers arrived three days later. Then, her task done, she and Millicoma, with destroyer escorts, [...] and , steamed toward the Admiralties. She arrived at Manus on 15 September for repairs.|$|E
40|$|A novel {{mathematical}} method {{is presented to}} determine equivalent circuit modeling based on electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) dates, and to investigate the corrosion behavior of corrosion resistant steel for <b>cargo</b> <b>oil</b> tank (COT) in NaCl acid solution. First, the corrosion rate is calculated by weight loss method, it indicates superior corrosion resistance. Next, the transfer function of system is obtained by the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) dates, and determines proper time constants for equivalent circuit to fit experimental results. Finally, the results of EIS are in agreement with accelerated corrosion measurements by the fitting errors and relating to known physical parameters, which indicate the novel {{mathematical method}} is very effective...|$|E

The evaporation rate of the individual volatile hydrocarbon components as well as gas volume flow and gas composition during loading and discharging of crude oil cargo are modelled and computed by means of a comprehensive simulation program. Emission is controlled through a series of optional combinations of control techniques, including depression of evaporation at the outset through sequential transfer of tank atmosphere (STTA), condensation of oil vapour and absorption of oil vapour in the <b>cargo</b> <b>oil...</b>|$|E
