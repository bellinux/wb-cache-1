40|$|A protein {{required}} for the activation of the lac operon has been extensively purified and partly characterized. This protein, called <b>CGA</b> <b>protein</b> (catabolite gene activator protein, sometimes named CAP), is a dimer with subunits of 22, 000 daltons. Purified <b>CGA</b> <b>protein</b> has a substantial affinity for DNA; this affinity is greatly strengthened by cAMP and strongly inhibited by cGMP. Other {{studies have shown that}} these cyclic nucleotides compete for a binding site on <b>CGA</b> <b>protein.</b> The opposing effects of the two cyclic compounds in DNA-CGA protein binding show a parallel behavior to their effects on the expression of the lac operon. Thus cAMP, in addition to <b>CGA</b> <b>protein,</b> is {{required for}} expression of the lac operon, whereas cGMP inhibits the expression. The obvious inference is that <b>CGA</b> <b>protein</b> activates the lac operon by binding to the DNA under the influence of cAMP.

40|$|AbstractSince the conserved near N-terminal region (residues 18 – 37) of chromogranin A (CGA) has {{tentatively}} {{been identified}} as the vesicle membrane interacting region using synthetic peptides, {{it was necessary to}} confirm this finding with CGA deletion proteins. In order to address this need and to clarify the discrepancies of the published amino acid sequences of CGA, we cloned a CGA gene and produced CGA deletion proteins of various sizes. The recombinant <b>CGA</b> <b>protein</b> lacking the first 16 amino acid residues bound to the vesicle membrane as well as the full-length CGA at pH 5. 5. However, the <b>CGA</b> <b>protein</b> lacking the first 39 amino acid residues, which include the conserved near N-terminal region (residues 17 – 38), failed to interact with the vesicle membrane at pH 5. 5, clearly indicating the essential role of the conserved near N-terminal region in the pH-dependent interaction of CGA with the vesicle membrane. © 1997 Federation of European Biochemical Societies...|$|E
40|$|Chromogranin A (CGA) is {{the major}} protein of the {{secretory}} granule from chromaffin cells and also is found {{in a variety of}} endocrine cells. Although the sequence of this acidic glycoprotein has been elucidated recently, its biological function is unknown. Here we have purified CGA from chromaffin granules; the final preparation contained the 74 -kDa native CGA together with two degradation products [...] three bands near 60 kDa and a single band of 43 kDa. This preparation was found to inhibit (a maximum inhibition of 60 % at 1 microM) the nicotine-induced, but not the high K+-evoked, catecholamine secretion from bovine chromaffin cells maintained in primary culture. Spontaneous release was also affected in the nanomolar <b>CGA</b> <b>protein</b> concentration range. The observation that the inhibitory effect is strictly dependent on a preincubation step together with the modification of the <b>CGA</b> <b>protein</b> profile during this preincubation step suggests that the degradation peptide(s) rather than the 74 -kDa native CGA [...] the approximately equal to 60 -kDa bands or the 43 -kDa singlet band [...] is actually involved in secretory cell activity. This was demonstrated by using trypsin-generated peptides that were inhibitory without the preincubation period. The finding that unprocessed CGA is not active on chromaffin cell secretion suggests that this molecule is a precursor of a peptide(s) that is able to regulate catecholamine secretion. Thus, the present data suggest that a CGA-derived peptide(s) could exert a feedback control on chromaffin cell secretory activity [...] a mechanism that might be of importance during stress situations...|$|E

40|$|The {{plasma level}} of chromogranin A (CgA) is {{elevated}} in genetic hypertension. Conversely, the plasma {{level of the}} CgA peptide catestatin is diminished in individuals with established hypertension and those with a genetic risk of this disease. Resequencing of the human CHGA gene identified three naturally occurring variants of catestatin (Gly 364 Ser, Pro 370 Leu, and Arg 374 Gln) that exhibit different potencies in inhibiting catecholamine secretion. Here, we have examined whether there is any differential processing of the three CHGA variants to catestatin by the endoproteolytic enzyme plasmin. Plasmin digestion of the purified <b>CgA</b> <b>proteins</b> generated a stable biologically active 14 -amino acid peptide (human CgA 360 – 373) from the wild-type, Gly 364 Ser, and Arg 374 Gln proteins despite the disruption of the dibasic site (Arg 373 Arg 374) in the Arg 374 Gln variant. Unexpectedly, the action of plasmin in generating the catestatin peptide from the Pro 370 Leu protein was less efficient. The efficiency of cleavage at the dibasic Arg 373 ↓Arg 374 site in synthetic human CgA 360 – 380 was 3 - to 4 -fold less in Pro 370 Leu CgA, compared with the wild type. Circular dichroism of the synthetic CgA 352 – 372 suggested {{a difference in the}} amount of α-helix and β-sheet between the wild-type and Pro 370 Leu CgA peptides. Because the Pro 370 residue is in the P 4 position, the local secondary structure {{in the vicinity of the}} cleavage site may enforce the specificity or accessibility to plasmin. The less efficient proteolytic processing of the Pro 370 Leu protein by plasmin, coupled with the strong association of this variant with ethnicity, suggests that the Pro 370 Leu CHGA gene variant may contribute to the differential prevalence of cardiovascular disease across ethnic groups...|$|R

40|$|Several {{members of}} the chromogranin/secretogranin (Cg/Sg) family are post-translationally {{processed}} in neuroendocrine cells and tumors to smaller peptides, {{some of which are}} biologically active. For example, CgA is processed to pancreastatin, parastatin, and other peptides. We analyzed the distribution of pancreastatin and CgA proteins in normal and neoplastic pituitaries as well as the prohormone convertases PC 2 and PC 3 / 1 (PC 3), the putative processing enzymes for the Cg/Sg family, in 35 pituitary adenomas and 4 non-neoplastic pituitaries by immunohistochemistry and immunoblotting with highly specific antisera. CgA and CgB mRNAs were also examined. Pancreastatin was present in all subtypes of pituitary tumors, although prolactin-secreting adenomas expressed this peptide less frequently than did other tumor types. <b>CgA</b> <b>protein</b> and CgA mRNA expression were also restricted in prolactin adenomas and in normal prolactin cells, as shown by combined in situ hybridization and immunostaining. The prohormone convertases PC 2 and PC 3 were present in pituitary tumors and in non-neoplastic pituitaries. Immunoblot analysis and immunostaining showed a principal approximately 69 -kd PC 3 band and a approximately 68 -kd PC 2 band. Adrenocorticotrophic hormone-secreting adenomas expressed mainly PC 3 as determined by immunoblotting and immunohistochemistry, whereas all other adenoma groups expressed predominantly PC 2. These results indicate that the enzymes capable of processing CgA and other {{members of the}} Cg/Sg family to peptides with biological activity such as pancreastatin are widely expressed in human pituitary adenomas and in non-neoplastic pituitaries, with adrenocorticotrophic hormone tumors expressing predominantly PC 3 and other adenomas expressing mainly PC 2.

40|$|Chromogranin A (CgA) is {{the major}} member {{of a family of}} acidic {{secretory}} glycoproteins (collectively known as granins) that are expressed in all endocrine and neuroendocrine cells. Granins have been proposed to play multiple roles, both intracellular and extracellular, in the secretory process. The regulation of synthesis and secretion of CgA in primary cultures of bovine parathyroid cells was studied and compared to that of parathyroid hormone (PTH). The effects of both extracellular calcium and the active metabolite of vitamin D$ sb 3 $, 1, 25 -dihydroxyvitamin D$ sb 3 $ (1, 25 (OH) $ rm sb 2 D sb 3 $) were shown to modulate CgA synthesis and secretion in the parathyroid. Whereas a reduced medium calcium level stimulated both CgA and PTH secretion, it had no effect on CgA mRNA levels. In contrast, 1, 25 (OH) $ rm sb 2 D sb 3 $ stimulated CgA mRNA levels by increasing the CgA gene transcription rate. Thus, 1, 25 (OH) $ rm sb 2 D sb 3 $ had opposite actions on the CgA and PTH genes in the parathyroid cell. The relationship between 1, 25 (OH) $ rm sb 2 D sb 3 $-stimulated CgA mRNA levels and total <b>CgA</b> <b>protein</b> levels (intracellular and extracellular) was not simple. Although 1, 25 (OH) $ rm sb 2 D sb 3 $ increased CgA mRNA levels several-fold, there was only a modest increase in <b>CgA</b> <b>protein.</b> This {{was the result of a}} specific effect of 1, 25 (OH) $ rm sb 2 D sb 3 $ on decreasing the translational efficiency of CgA mRNA as demonstrated by an increased ribosome transit time for CgA mRNA. To better understand the functional domains of CgA, and its evolution, and to study the basis of its neuroendocrine cell-specific gene expression, the human CgA gene was cloned and characterized. It spans 15 kb and contains eight exons. There is high conservation between the human, mouse, and bovine CgA genes with respect to exon number and placement of exon/intron borders.

The position of this protein prevents closure of the LH 1 ring, possibly to allow diffusion of ubiquinone/ubiquinol between the RC and the cytochrome bc 1 complex in analogous fashion to the well-studied PufX protein from Rhodobacter sphaeroides. The identity and function of helix W have remained unknown for over 13 years; here we use a combination of biochemistry, mass spectrometry, molecular genetics and electron microscopy to identify this protein as RPA 4402 in Rps. palustris <b>CGA</b> 009. <b>Protein</b> W shares key conserved sequence features with PufX homologs, and although a deletion mutant was able to grow under photosynthetic conditions with no discernible phenotype, we show that a tagged version of protein W pulls down the RC-LH 1 complex.

Results The patient was a 58 -year-old woman. MRI examination revealed a parenchyma mass with irregularly long T 1 and long T 2 signal in right temporal lobe and basal ganglia region. The border was clear and peritumoral edema was inconspicuous. The mesocephalon and right ventricle were compressed, and the midline was shifted to left. Enhanced MRI showed multiple flaky and nodular enhancement. Histologically, tumor cells showed remarkable cellular pleomorphism, and they were composed of mononuclear cells, multinuclear giant tumor cells, frothy tumor cells and spindle cells. Eosinophilic granular bodies and intranuclear inclusions were seen. Tumor cells in partial regions were intensively arranged, with obvious atypia. Immunohistochemical analysis showed immunoreactivity of the cells to glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), Vimentin (Vim), S- 100 protein (S- 100), neuronal nuclei (NeuN) and P 53.

40|$|Chromogranin A (CgA) {{is widely}} {{expressed}} in endocrine and neuroendocrine tissues {{as well as}} in the central nervous system. We observed CgA expression (mRNA and protein) in the gastrocnemius (GAS) muscle and found that performance of CgA-deficient Chga-KO mice in treadmill exercise was impaired. Supplementation with CgA in Chga-KO mice restored exercise ability suggesting a novel role for endogenous CgA in skeletal muscle function. Chga-KO mice display (i) lack of exercise-induced stimulation of pAKT, pTBC 1 D 1 and phospho-p 38 kinase signaling, (ii) loss of GAS muscle mass, (iii) extensive formation of tubular aggregates (TA), (iv) disorganized cristae architecture in mitochondria, (v) increased expression of the inflammatory cytokines Tnfα, Il 6 and Ifnɣ, and fibrosis. The impaired maximum running speed and endurance in the treadmill exercise in Chga-KO mice correlated with decreased glucose uptake and glycolysis, defects in glucose oxidation and decreased mitochondrial cytochrome C oxidase activity. The lack of adaptation to endurance training correlated with the lack of stimulation of p 38 MAPK that is known to mediate the response to tissue damage. Since <b>CgA</b> sorts <b>proteins</b> to the regulated secretory pathway, we speculate that lack of CgA could cause misfolding of membrane proteins inducing aggregation of sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) membranes and formation of tubular aggregates that is observed in Chga-KO mice.

Haem internalization involves the ShmR haem outer membrane receptor and the hmuTUV locus, which participates in haem transport across the cytoplasmic membrane. Previous studies have demonstrated that expression of the shmR gene is negatively regulated by iron through RirA. Here, we identify hmuP in a genetic screen for mutants that displayed aberrant control of shmR. The normal induction of shmR in response to iron limitation was lost in the hmuP mutant, showing that this gene positively affects shmR expression. Moreover, the HmuP protein {{is not part of the}} haemin transporter system. Analysis of gene expression and siderophore production indicates that disruption of hmuP does not affect other genes related to the iron-restriction response.

In {{addition to}} pH- and Ca 2 +-dependent aggregation, CgA {{is known to}} bind {{to a number of}} vesicle matrix proteins. Because the binding-prone property of <b>CgA</b> with secretory <b>proteins</b> may be essential for its targeting to secretory granules, we screened its binding partner proteins using a yeast two-hybrid system. We found that CgA bound to secretogranin III (SgIII) by specific interaction both in vitro and in endocrine cells. Localization analysis showed that CgA and SgIII were coexpressed in pituitary and pancreatic endocrine cell lines, whereas SgIII was not expressed in the adrenal glands and PC 12 cells. Immunoelectron microscopy demonstrated that CgA and SgIII were specifically colocalized in large secretory granules in male rat gonadotropes, which possess large-type and small-type granules. An immunocytochemical analysis revealed that deletion of the binding domain (CgA 48 – 111) for SgIII missorted CgA to the constitutive pathway, whereas deletion of the binding domain (SgIII 214 – 373) for CgA did not affect the sorting of SgIII to the secretory granules in AtT- 20 cells. These findings suggest that CgA localizes with SgIII by specific binding in secretory granules in SgIII-expressing pituitary and pancreatic endocrine cells, whereas other mechanisms are likely to be responsible for CgA localization in secretory granules of SgIII-lacking adrenal chromaffin cells and PC 12 cells...|$|R
40|$|Chromogranin A (<b>CgA),</b> a major <b>protein</b> of chromaffin granules, {{has been}} {{described}} as a potential marker for neuroendocrine tumours. Because of an extensive proteolysis which leads to a large heterogeneity of circulating fragments, its presence in blood has been assessed in most cases either by competitive immunoassays or with polyclonal antibodies. In the present study, 24 monoclonal antibodies were raised against native or recombinant human CgA. Their mapping with proteolytic peptides showed that they defined eight distinct epitopic groups which spanned two-thirds of the C-terminal part of human CgA. All monoclonal antibodies were tested by pair and compared with a reference radioimmunoassay (RIA) involving CGS 06, one of the monoclonal antibodies against the 198 – 245 sequence. It appears that CgA C-terminal end seems to be highly affected by proteolysis and the association of C-terminal and median-part monoclonal antibodies is inadequate for total CgA assessment. Our new immunoradiometric assay involves two monoclonal antibodies, whose contiguous epitopes lie within the median 145 – 245 sequence. This assay allows a sensitive detection of total human CgA and correlates well with RIA because dibasic cleavage sites present in the central domain do not seem to be affected by degradation.

40|$|Chromogranin A (CgA) is an acidic {{glycoprotein}} that is co-stored with hormones or neurotransmitters in granular {{components of}} endocrine cells and neurons, and released together {{with them in}} response to adequate stimulation.

The {{purpose of this study}} is to elucidate how different the processing of CgA is among endocrine tissues by immunostaining using multiple region-specific antisera, and to evaluate the availability of region-specific antisera. When various endocrine organs of rats were immunostained with four region-specific antisera against rat CgA (CgA 1 - 28, 94 - 130, 296 - 314, and 359 - 389), all amine/peptide-secreting endocrine tissues except the pineal body were stained positively. The adrenal medulla and gastric endocrine cells were equally intensely immunoreactive to all four antisera, while the other endocrine tissues, represented by pancreatic islets, showed different staining patterns depending on the antiserum. These results suggest that the processing of CgA differs from tissue to tissue. An antiserum against horse CgA 335 - 365, corresponding to rat CgA 359 - 389 which shows the highest concentration in the plasma and urine of the rat, again stained all endocrine tissues of the horse except the pineal body.

Spinal MRI revealed abnormal signals in the lumbosacral portion of spinal cord, and exhibited heterogeneous enhancement after contrast. The lesion was totally removed under microscopy. Histologically, the tumor was invasive, with diffusely distributed tumor cells and old hemorrhage. Some tumor cells were immature cells with small volume, obvious atypia and hyperchromatic nuclei. Others presented classic rhabdoid features: round to oval cells, eccentrically placed and vacuolar nuclei with prominent nucleoli, and hyperchromatic cytoplasm with eosinophilic round inclusion bodies. Tumor stroma showed mucoid degeneration. Immunohistochemical staining showed partial positivity in the cytoplasm of tumor cells for vimentin (Vim) and smooth muscle actin (SMA).

The human NeuroD gene was stably expressed in FAO-ins cells. In the transfected cells (FAOins-Nd) the expression of genes encoding transcription factor Foxa 2, L-type calcium channel subunits and secretory granule <b>protein</b> <b>CgA</b> was up-regulated. FAOins-Nd also showed greater intracellular insulin content and secretion as well as released insulin in a regulated manner to calcium stimulus. Further, growth factors namely betacellulin, activin A, nicotinamide and exendin- 4 as well as insulin secretagogues such as theophylline, IBMX and carbachol were examined by static incubation in inducing glucose-regulated insulin secretion. Exendin- 4 and insulin secretagogues stimulate insulin secretion in the presence of 1. 5 mM glucose but the addition of 20 mM glucose had no further stimulatory effect.

This tumor exhibits low-grade malignancy with benign histopathological appearance and clinically destructive behavior which occurs in the skull base and frequently invades the posterior petrous bone, the mastoid, semicircular canal, cerebellopontine angle structures and cranial nerve. The presence of intracranial ELST always makes the diagnosis challenge for clinicians and pathologists. Herein we describe a case of ELST in skull base. The clinicopathology of this tumor and its differential diagnosis are discussed. Methods The clinical manifestation of a patient with primary ELST occurring in right cerebellopontine angle was presented retrospectively. Resected mass was routinely paraffin-embedded and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Dako EnVision immunohistochemical staining system was used to detect the tumor antigen expressions, including cytokeratin (CK), vimentin (Vim), epithelial membrane antigen (EMA), carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), synaptophysin (Syn), chromogranin A (<b>CgA),</b> S- 100 <b>protein</b> (S- 100), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), thyroglobulin (TG), thyroid transcription factor- 1 (TTF- 1) and Ki- 67. Results A 32 -year-old male patient presented with 20 -year history of progressive hearing loss. MRI scan revealed an expansile lytic lesion of the mastoid process of the right petrous bone, measuring 4. 20 cm × 3. 30 cm × 2. 00 cm, occupied the right cerebellopontine angle with infiltration of surrounding dura mater. But the lesion did not break the dura mater and invade the brain parenchyma. Craniotomy was performed and the tumor was removed totally. Histological examination revealed a papillary, cystic or glandular architecture in mass. The papillary and glandular structures were lined by a single layer of flattened cuboidal-to-columnar cells. The stroma of the papillary fronds was richly vascularized and chronically inflamed. There were minimal cellular pleomorphism and rare mitotic activity and necrosis was not observed. There were cystic glandular spaces filled with colloid-like material which was remarkably similar to thyroid tissue. Immunohistochemical staining showed that the tumor cells were diffusely positive for CK (AE 1 /AE 3), Vim, EMA and focally positive for CEA, but negative for Syn, CgA, S- 100, GFAP, TG and TTF- 1. The Ki- 67 index was less than 1 %. The colloid-like material showed positive reactivity with periodic acid-Schiff (PAS). Based on clinical presentation and histological findings, a final histological diagnosis of primary papillary ELST in cerebellopontine angle was made according to the criteria of WHO classification. The patient had not received radiotherapy or chemotherapy and attended follow-up for 3 months, without any neurological deficit or signs of recurrence. Conclusion ELST is rare skull base tumor originating from endolymphatic epithelium within the vestibular aqueduct, characterized clinically by slow growth with local invasion and bone destruction. Due to the rarity of this tumor, it can easily be confused with other tumors of skull base with papillary architecture such as chorioid plexus papilloma, papillary ependymoma, papillary meningioma, middle ear adenoma, and metastatic papillary carcinoma of the thyroid. Complete excision is the best guarantee against tumor recurrence, while recurrence may occur due to subtotal resection...|$|R
