Duplock has stated that: [...] "One thing that was quite difficult for me to get right was the idea that she didn't want sex. It's Whitney's way of keeping Tony happy. If she lets him do it, then he's nicer to her and he makes her feel special." [...] Research highlighted the fact that 12% of abused children go on to become abusers in turn, however Duplock explained: [...] "We felt that to imply on TV that someone who has been abused {{is going to go on}} to abuse other people is not a message you want to give out. Those people have been through enough." [...] Narducci for the NSPCC stated that importance was placed on making children viewing the show [...] "feel comfortable about asking for help if they felt they needed it [...] for the wider community - to recognise the signs and let them know that they <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> it.

500|$|Apple filed {{a patent}} {{infringement}} suit against High Tech Computer Corp. (HTC) in March 2010 in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware {{in the two}} companies' ongoing battle with each other, and a complaint against HTC under Section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930 with the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) in Washington, D.C. Apple's suit alleged 20 separate patent infringements relating to the iPhone's user interface, underlying architecture and hardware. Steve Jobs exclaimed [...] "We can sit by and watch competitors steal our patented inventions, or we <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> it. We've {{decided to do something}} about it ... think competition is healthy, but competitors should create their own original technology, not steal ours". The ITC rejected all but one of Apple's claims, however, ruling for Apple on a single claim relating to data tapping. HTC motioned the Delaware court for a change of venue to the Northern District of California, arguing against Apple's desire to consolidate the case with the similar cases brought by Nokia against Apple, alleging insubstantial overlap between those cases and Apple's complaint, but Judge Gregory M. Sleet denied HTC's motion for a venue change, ruling that Apple's choice of forum would prevail. HTC countersued Apple in September 2011 in the same court claiming infringement of four patents HTC obtained from Google, also filing a counter-complaint with the ITC, with HTC's general counsel saying [...] "HTC will continue to protect its patented inventions against infringement from Apple until such infringement stops." [...] In May 2012 the Delaware court ordered mediation between the companies. In November 2012, HTC and Apple ended the patent dispute by settling the case, but did not disclose the terms of the settlement. The companies reported the settlement included a 10-year agreement for licensing both companies' current and future patents to each other." ...|$|E

40|$|The {{introductory}} physics course {{often is}} one of the biggest hurdles in the academic career of a student. For a sizable number of students, the course leaves a permanent sense of frustration. I have only to tell people I am a physicist to hear grumblings about high school or college physics. This general sense of frustration with introductory physics is widespread among non-physics majors required to take physics courses. Even physics majors are frequently dissatisfied with their introductory courses, and a large fraction of students initially interested in physics end up majoring in a different field. What have we done to make it that way, and <b>can</b> we <b>do</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> it?

The theoretical battle appears to be over, {{at least for the}} present, with no winners. There are definitely losers though-landowners who are victims of inequity, if not of constitutional wrongs. Why are we in this situation? Because it is an inescapable product of the land use system we have created. To promote unconstrained private initiative by landowners, we allow owners to consume limited ambient resources like open space and habitat in a version of a prior appropriation system so that nothing is left to later-developing landowners when the limits of acceptable use are finally acknowledged through late-stage regulation.

5000|$|By this time, Nick Powell {{had joined}} the band to play keyboards, {{expanding}} their sound. A third, eponymously titled album was released 6 October 1997. Written in Bethlehem, South Wales, and recorded at Abbey Road Studio Two, this album was seen as significantly lighter than Strangelove's previous records, with Duff choosing to write less directly introspective. [...] "I've just {{got a lot of}} crap in my head, and I've made the choice to get rid of it, to keep it out of my work.

However, seemingly on the point of a major breakthrough, Strangelove split up on 20 April 1998. In later interviews, Duff acknowledged how [...] "unfocused" [...] he was on music while in Strangelove, that he could sense the band had run its course, and he needed {{to get away from the}} fast-paced life of touring to truly recover, and discover his calling as an artist. When asked about the possibility of a Strangelove reunion, Duff explains that while everyone in the band are still friends, and is not completely opposed to the idea, the chances of it are very slim. As a solo artist, Duff has played stripped down, acoustic versions of Strangelove songs, sporadically.|$|R
5000|$|Red Barber {{recounted in}} Ken Burns's {{documentary}} Baseball that Rickey's determination to desegregate Major League Baseball was {{born out of}} a combination of idealism and astute business sense. The idealism was at least partially rooted in an incident involving a team for which Rickey worked early on. While managing at Ohio Wesleyan University, a black player, Charles Thomas, was extremely upset at being refused accommodation at the hotel where the team stayed because of his race. Though an infuriated Rickey managed to get him into the hotel for the night, he never forgot the incident and later said, [...] "I {{may not be able to}} <b>do</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> racism in every field, but I <b>can</b> sure <b>do</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> it in baseball." [...] The business element was based on the fact that the Negro Leagues had numerous star athletes, and logically, the first Major League team to hire them would get first pick of the players at an attractive price. At the time, Mexican brewery czar Jorge Pasquel was raiding America for black talent (e.g., Satchel Paige), as well as disgruntled white players, for the Mexican League with the idea of creating an integrated league that could compete on a talent level with the U.S. major leagues. However idealistic, Rickey did not compensate Monarchs ownership for the rights to obtain Robinson, nor did he pay for rights to Don Newcombe, who would also join the Dodgers from a Negro leagues club. Rickey also attempted to sign Monte Irvin but Newark Eagles business owner Effa Manley refused to allow Irvin to leave her club without compensation. When she threatened to sue him in court, Rickey stopped the pursuit of Irvin, who would later sign with the New York Giants.|$|R

40|$|The communion {{formulary}} of the Nederduitsch Hervormde Kerk states {{clearly that}} a church member {{may not take}} part in revolutionary activities {{and that he should}} obey governmental authorities. Two questions are asked: 1. Does this statement imply that a Christian should obey goverments, even when they are oppressive? <b>Can</b> a Christian <b>do</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> his fate, or is he obliged to suffer injustice? 2. How can and must we interpret this principle today in a democratic state where resistance and rebellion are integral elements of the political process? It is argued that in Biblical-Reformed theology not only the duty to obey but also the right to resist are justified. Although civil disobedience is allowed, violence is strongly condemned. This article asks the church to adhere to the communion formulary, but simultaniously to realise the vast differences between the sixteenth and the twentieth centuries.

50|$|Anti-Colonialist - Child of All Nations takes a {{particularly}} anti-colonialist tone throughout the novel but particularly {{around the time}} of Minke’s realization that he and his people have long been oppressed and he <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> it. The author, Toer, makes a point to have the readers understand that there is no question the natives are oppressed and the Dutch are the oppressors. This is seen repeatedly in the simple fact that no matter what situation or level of ability the natives will always be subject to the Dutch, simply because they Dutch have stated it to be so. The anti-colonial tone, which the book takes, is not surprising when the author himself was imprisoned for subversive activities from a regime supported by former colonial powers.|$|E
