5|$|In the United Kingdom, {{playing in}} 168 cinemas, Dr. No grossed $840,000 {{in just two}} weeks and wound up being the fifth most popular movie of the year there. The box office results in {{mainland}} Europe were also positive. The film ended up grossing $6 million, making it a financial success compared to its $1 million budget. The original North American gross rental was $2 million, increasing to $6 million after its first reissue in 1965, as a double feature with From Russia with Love. The following reissue was in 1966 paired with Goldfinger, to compensate {{the fact that the}} next Bond movie would only <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> following year. The total gross of Dr. No ended up being $59.6 million worldwide, IGN listed it as sixth-best Bond film ever, Entertainment Weekly put it at seventh among Bond films, and Norman Wilner of MSN as twelfth best. The review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes sampled 51 reviews and judged 96% of the reviews as positive. President John F. Kennedy was a fan of Ian Fleming's novels and requested a private showing of Dr. No in the White House.|$|E

500|$|In June 2009, singer Michael Jackson {{died at the}} age of 50 {{following}} cardiac arrest.

500|$|Square had {{announced}} that Xenogears {{may not have}} <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> United States due to [...] "sensitive religious issues". The English translation of Xenogears was the first instance in which an English localization team worked directly with Square developers. It also {{was the first major}} project of Square translator Richard Honeywood. According to Honeywood, translating the game was a particularly difficult task due to it containing numerous scientific concepts and philosophies. He came into contact with it because its previously assigned translators quit or asked for reassignment due to its challenge. In a later interview, Honeywood stated that the biggest issue was with the multiple religious references, and the concept at the end of [...] "killing God", which needed to be adjusted so that it remained faithful to the original premise while stepping around some content that might offend. Honeywood unintentionally had a hand in the Japanese naming of Deus: the staff were originally going to call it Yahweh, and during his argument against it he said [...] "yabeh-o", a Japanese phrase meaning something dangerous. Seeing it as a good pun, the staff used Yabeh as the name.|$|E

500|$|Alucard {{appears in}} the sequel [...] as a {{supporting}} character. Since the game takes place centuries later, Alucard's personality and standing towards his father has drastically changed. He believes that Dracula can still be redeemed and makes it his goal to free the world from tyranny and vanquish the evil that had corrupted him and his father. He concocts a centuries spanning plan to put his father {{into a deep sleep}} by piercing his heart with the Crissaegrim sword, in order to make both the lord of the dead, Zobek and Satan himself, believe that Dracula is dead, so they can <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> open. Once they do, Alucard would remove the sword so Dracula can resurrect and then destroy Zobek and Satan for good. Dracula agrees with his son's plan and awakens centuries later during modern times. Throughout the game Alucard also appears as a younger Trevor Belmont and guides Dracula through his Castle to help him recover his old powers and missing memories. In order to not draw suspicion to his plan, Alucard masquerades himself as Zobek's Lieutenant and eventually reveals his true identity to his father once he remembers their pact. They destroy Zobek and Satan and appear to be on good terms in the end. Alucard is also the protagonist of the DLC Revelations, taking place shortly prior to the events of the game.|$|E
500|$|Titanic {{held the}} record for box office gross for twelve years. Cameron's {{follow-up}} film, Avatar, was considered the first film with a genuine chance at surpassing its worldwide gross, and did so in 2010. Various explanations for why the film was able to successfully challenge Titanic were given. For one, [...] "Two-thirds of Titanic haul was earned overseas, and Avatar [...] similarly... Avatar opened in 106 markets globally and was no. 1 in all of them" [...] and the markets [...] "such as Russia, where Titanic saw modest receipts in 1997 and 1998, are white-hot today" [...] with [...] "more screens and moviegoers" [...] than ever before. Brandon Gray, president of Box Office Mojo, said that while Avatar may beat Titanic revenue record, the film is unlikely to surpass Titanic in attendance. [...] "Ticket prices were about $3 cheaper in the late 1990s." [...] In December 2009, Cameron had stated, [...] "I don't think it's realistic to try to topple Titanic off its perch. Some pretty good movies have <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> last few years. Titanic just struck some kind of chord." [...] In a January 2010 interview, he gave a different take on the matter once Avatar performance was easier to predict. [...] "It's gonna happen. It's {{just a matter of}} time," [...] he said.|$|E
