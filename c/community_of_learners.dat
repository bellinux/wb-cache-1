2500|$|For {{a school}} to be fully {{committed}} to implementing PLCs, the school's leadership must help establish and maintain PLCs.

In a PLC, the view of the principal as the instructional leader changes to a view that reflects the principal as a member of a <b>community</b> <b>of</b> <b>learners</b> and leaders.|$|E

40|$|In this study, {{the concept}} of ‘community of learners’ was used to improve initial {{vocational}} education. The framework of a ‘community <b>of</b> <b>learners</b> for vocational orientation’ that we present offers both a theoretical understanding of teaching–learning processes in initial vocational education and heuristics {{for the design of}} innovative learning environments for optimising these processes. In a design research study, we investigated if, and how, learning environments designed {{on the basis of these}} heuristics fostered <b>communities</b> <b>of</b> <b>learners</b> for vocational orientation, in which students experience to learn in a shared, meaningful, reflective and transfer-oriented way. We examined students’ perceptions of the learning environment and their learning activities during eight curriculum units specifically designed to foster the <b>communities</b> <b>of</b> <b>learners.</b> During almost all of the units that we designed, students found themselves learning in a more shared, meaningful, reflective and transfer-oriented way than during regular units. We conclude that the proposed heuristics had been useful starting points for the design of innovative learning environments that foster <b>communities</b> <b>of</b> <b>learners</b> for vocational orientation. In addition, we show how the heuristics can be elaborated for a particular school, based on practical and pedagogical content knowledge of teachers, as well as students’ perceptions of the learning environment and their learning activities...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Many {{innovations}} in education are not completed, {{even if they}} are well thought out in advance. One of the main causes is the organization's lack of learning ability, combined with a shortage of teachers' and students' ownership with respect to the renewal of ideas and design. In <b>communities</b> <b>of</b> <b>learners,</b> teachers and students collaborate and learn together in order to shape {{innovations in}} their daily practice. Their ability to learn collectively is a key factor in developing a learning organization. So far, insights into how processes of collective learning can be designed effectively, and which critical factors play a role, have been based on limited empirical research. This article's goal is to {{contribute to the development of}} these insights, using the results of a study based on 48 cases of collective learning in <b>communities</b> <b>of</b> <b>learners</b> in primary schools and teacher education institutes. The results suggest that although collective learning rarely takes place in most cases many outcomes are created that affect all community members. This leads to the conclusion that some participants create outcomes, not only on behalf of themselves, but also on behalf of others...|$|R
