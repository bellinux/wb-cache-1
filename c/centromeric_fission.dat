40|$|Somatic {{chromosomes}} at {{mitotic metaphase}} of two species and two undescribed populations of Bowenia, and Stangeria eriopus, which were classified in Stangeriaceae, Cycadales, were compared using the standard aceto-orcein staining method. All Bowenia taxa showed a chromosome number of 2 n = 18, while S. eriopus showed a chromosome number of 2 n = 16. The chromosome number of 2 n = 18 in B. 'Kuranda' is {{reported for the}} first time. The present karyotype analysis indicates that B. 'Kuranda' and another undescribed taxon, B. 'Tinaroo', are cytotaxonomically closer to B. spectabilis than B. serrulata, and that the karyotype of Stangeria is unlikely to have been derived from that of Bowenia by a simple chromosomal change such as <b>centromeric</b> <b>fission</b> and deletion...|$|E
40|$|Fissioncytorace- 1, {{a member}} of the nasuta-albomicans complex of Drosophila is an {{evolutionary}} product of centric fission, which had occurred in the chromosome X 3 of Cytorace 1, a hydridization product of Drosophila nasuta nasuta male (2 n= 8) and Drosophila nasuta albomicans female (2 n= 6). Cytorace 1 (males 2 n= 7; females 2 n= 6) has inherited this chromosome from its D. n. albomicans parent. The chromosome X 3 of D. n. albomicans is a derivative of a centric fusion between the acrocentric chromosome 3 and the chromosome X of D. n. nasuta. The Fissioncytorace- 1 has crossed 200 generations from the time of its evolution in the laboratory environment. When this <b>centromeric</b> <b>fission</b> race was subjected to some of the morphophenotypic and fitness assessment to find its overall population fitness showed, increased body size, sternopleural bristle, ovarioles, lifetime fecundity and fertility with reduced interspecific competitive ability and hatching success when compared with its parent (Cytorace 1). These results suggest that the hybrid races must have encountered an early event of recombinational raciation during their evolution in the laboratory environment, which is a unique observation in animal system illustrating the increase in the tempo of evolution after the event of hybridization...|$|E
40|$|The {{origin of}} human {{chromosomes}} (HSA) 7, 16, and 19 was studied by comparing {{data obtained from}} chromosome banding, chromosome painting, and gene mapping in species belonging to 11 orders of placental mammals (Eutherians). This allowed us to propose the reconstruction of their presumed ancestral forms. The HSA 7 homologs were composed of two parts, the largest forming an acrocentric. The smallest formed one arm of a small submetacentric; the other arm was composed of sequences homologous to the short arm of HSA 16 (HSA 16 p). The sequences homologous to the long arm of HSA 16 (HSA 16 q) were associated with sequences homologous to the long arm of HSA 19 (HSA 19 q) and formed another submetacentric. From their origin, these chromosomes underwent the following rearrangements to give rise to current human chromosomes: <b>centromeric</b> <b>fission</b> of the two submetacentrics in ancestors of all primates (∼ 80 million years ago); fusion of the HSA 19 p and HSA 19 q sequences, originating the current HSA 19, in ancestors of all simians (∼ 55 million years ago); fusions of the HSA 16 p and HSA 16 q sequences, originating the current HSA 16 and the two components of HSA 7 before the separation of Cercopithecoids and Hominoids (∼ 35 million years ago); and finally, pericentric and paracentric inversions of the homologs to HSA 7 after the divergence of orangutan and gorilla, respectively. Thus, compared with HSA 16 and HSA 19, HSA 7 is a fairly recent chromosome shared by man and chimpanzee only...|$|E
40|$|In the {{alternative}} pathway of telomere lengthening (ALT), neoplastic cell growth is prolonged by telomere recombination. We show that ALT is unexpectedly characterized by {{high rates of}} ongoing pericentromeric chromosomal instability. Combined with telomeric recombination, ALT pericentromeric instability generates neoacrocentric chromosomes. In the present studies, we describe a subgroup of ALT neoacrocentric minute chromosomes, composed of DNA entities two to five times smaller in size than human chromosome 21. The frequencies of ALT minute chromosomes were increased by gamma-irradiation and suppressed by telomerase. Continuous growth after telomerase inhibition/depletion was followed by increased rates of telomeric sister chromatid recombination {{and the emergence of}} minute chromosomes. We show that ALT minute chromosomes were derived from true <b>centromeric</b> <b>fissions</b> and/or chromosomal breakage/fusion/bridge cycles. They exhibit a two-chromatid structure, carry genomic DNA, centromeric and telomeric repeats, and display regular mitotic functionality. These observations are important in understanding the global genomic instability that characterizes most human advanced malignancies...|$|R
30|$|The second {{main event}} {{took place between}} nodes 4 and 5, where an {{increase}} in the number of macrochromosomes from 7 [*]~[*] 9 to 12 pairs took place, accomplished by a change in chromosomal numbers from 2 n[*]=[*] 30 to 2 n[*]=[*] 40. The increase in diploid numbers may be explained by a series of five <b>centromeric</b> <b>fissions</b> that occurred in five pairs of metacentric macrochromosomes in the 2 n[*]=[*] 30 chromosome complement, which produced chromosomes of the 2 n[*]=[*] 40 karyotype. This is supported by the comparison of the shape of the macrochromosomes in the two karyotypic forms. Indeed, macrochromosomes are meta-submetacentric in karyotypes with a low diploid number (2 n[*]=[*] 28 [*]~[*] 30), while in karyotypes with a high diploid number (2 n[*]=[*] 40 [*]~[*] 42), macrochromosomes are almost all acro-submetacentric (Table  1). Moreover, some other differences between the 2 n[*]=[*] 28 [*]~[*] 30 and 2 n[*]=[*] 40 karyotypes are evident. In fact, the presently studied A. unilobatus had several submetacentric chromosomes probably obtained by pericentric inversions that followed chromosomal fissions. Interestingly, one species, A. grahami, showed an extensive chromosome number polymorphism (2 n[*]=[*] 30 [*]~[*] 37), probably due to multiple Robertsonian fission events in metacentric macrochromosomes (Blake 1986). The high chromosomal number found in A. nebuloides (2 n[*]=[*] 42) also seems to be due to fission events (Figure  4). In fact, the common ancestor of A. nebuloides and A. quercorum had a PL[*]=[*] 0.94 for a low number of macrochromosomes. The present observations concur with the hypothesis that chromosomal fission is a characteristic trait of Norops. Other similar studies should be planned to understand whether chromosomal fission is common throughout the genus Anolis. At the moment, it was suggested to occur in at least one more species of anole, Anolis monticola (Webster et al. 1972).|$|R
40|$|Abp 1, and the {{closely related}} Cbh 1 and Cbh 2 are {{homologous}} {{to the human}} centromere-binding protein CENP-B that has been implicated in the assembly of <b>centromeric</b> heterochromatin. <b>Fission</b> yeast cells lacking Abp 1 show an increase in mini-chromosome instability suggesting that Abp 1 is important for chromosome segregation and/or DNA synthesis. Here we show that Abp 1 interacts with the DNA replication protein Cdc 23 (MCM 10) in a two-hybrid assay, and that the Δabp 1 mutant displays a synthetic phenotype with a cdc 23 temperature-sensitive mutant. Moreover, genetic interactions were also observed between abp 1 + and four additional DNA replication initiation genes cdc 18 +, cdc 21 +, orc 1 +, and orc 2 +. Interestingly, we find that S phase is delayed in cells deleted for abp 1 + when released from a G 1 block. However, no delay is observed when cells are released from an early S phase arrest induced by hydroxyurea suggesting that Abp 1 functions prior to, or coincident with, the initiation of DNA replication...|$|R

The range of chromosome number was 2 n = 48 to 51. Female had 9 pairs bi-arm chromosomes (including the submetacentric X-chromosome), male, however, had 7 pairs and two unpaied bi-arm chromosomes. The number of acrocentric chromosome (excluding the two smallest pairs, B 1 and B 2, {{because of their}} numerical variability) was 26 in female and 27 in male. A different chromosome number was frequently observed among cells even in a same individual.

40|$|The <b>centromeric</b> DNA of <b>fission</b> yeast is {{arranged}} {{with a central}} core flanked by repeated sequences. The centromere-associated proteins, Mis 6 p and Cnp 1 p (SpCENP-A), associate exclusively with central core DNA, whereas the Swi 6 protein binds the surrounding repeats. Here, electron microscopy and immunofluorescence light microscopy reveal that the central core and flanking regions occupy distinct positions within a heterochromatic domain. An “anchor” structure containing the Ndc 80 protein resides between this heterochromatic domain and the spindle pole body. The organization of centromere-associated proteins in fission yeast {{is reminiscent of the}} multilayered structures of human kinetochores, indicating that such domain structure is conserved in eukaryotes...|$|R

40|$|The {{maintenance}} of <b>centromeric</b> heterochromatin in <b>fission</b> yeast {{relies on the}} RNA interference-dependent complexes RITS (RNA-induced transcriptional silencing complex) and RDRC (RNA-directed RNA polymerase complex), which cooperate in a positive feedback loop to recruit high levels of histone H 3 K 9 methyltransferase activity to centromeres and to promote the assembly and {{maintenance of}} centromeric heterochromatin. However, {{it is unclear how}} these complexes are targeted to chromatin. RITS comprises Chp 1, which binds K 9 -methylated histone H 3; Ago 1, which binds short interfering (siRNAs); the adaptor protein Tas 3, which links Ago 1 to Chp 1; and centromeric siRNAs. We have generated mutants in RITS to determine the contribution of the two potential chromatin-targeting proteins Chp 1 and Ago 1 to the centromeric recruitment of RITS. Mutations in Tas 3 that disrupt Ago 1 binding are permissive for RITS recruitment and maintain centromeric heterochromatin, but the role of Tas 3 's interaction with Chp 1 is unknown. Here, we define the Chp 1 interaction domain of Tas 3. A strain expressing a tas 3 mutant that cannot bind Chp 1 (Tas 3 Δ 10 - 24) failed to maintain centromeric heterochromatin, with a loss of centromeric siRNAs, a failure to recruit RITS and RDRC to centromeres, and high levels of chromosome loss. These findings suggest a pivotal role for Chp 1 and its association with Tas 3 for the recruitment of RITS, RDRC, and histone H 3 K 9 methyltransferase activity to centromeres...|$|R
40|$|AbstractBackground: Centromeric domains often {{consist of}} {{repetitive}} {{elements that are}} assembled in specialized chromatin, characterized by hypoacetylation of histones H 3 and H 4 and methylation of lysine 9 of histone H 3 (K 9 -MeH 3). Perturbation of this underacetylated state by transient treatment with histone deacetylase inhibitors leads to defective centromere function, correlating with delocalization of the heterochromatin protein Swi 6 /HP 1. Likewise, deletion of the K 9 -MeH 3 methyltransferase Clr 4 /Suvar 39 causes defective chromosome segregation. Here, we create fission yeast strains retaining one histone H 3 and H 4 gene; the creation of these strains allows mutation of specific N-terminal tail residues and their role in centromeric silencing and chromosome stability to be investigated. Results: Reduction of H 3 /H 4 gene dosage to one-third does not affect cell viability or heterochromatin formation. Mutation of lysines 9 or 14 or serine 10 within the amino terminus of histone H 3 impairs centromere function, leading to defective chromosome segregation and Swi 6 delocalization. Surprisingly, silent centromeric chromatin {{does not require the}} conserved lysine 8 and 16 residues of histone H 4. Conclusions: To date, mutation of conserved N-terminal residues in endogenous histone genes has only been performed in budding yeast, which lacks the Clr 4 /Suvar 39 histone methyltransferase and Swi 6 /HP 1. We demonstrate the importance of conserved residues within the histone H 3 N terminus for the maintenance of <b>centromeric</b> heterochromatin in <b>fission</b> yeast. In sharp contrast, mutation of two conserved lysines within the histone H 4 tail has no impact on the integrity of centromeric heterochromatin. Our data highlight the striking divergence between the histone tail requirements for the fission yeast and budding yeast silencing pathways...|$|R
40|$|Formation of <b>centromeric</b> {{heterochromatin}} in <b>fission</b> yeast {{requires the}} combined action of chromatin modifying enzymes and small RNAs derived from centromeric transcripts. Positive feedback mechanisms that link the RNAi pathway and the Clr 4 /Suv 39 h 1 histone H 3 K 9 methyltransferase complex (Clr-C) result in requirements for H 3 K 9 methylation for full siRNA production and for siRNA production to achieve full histone methylation. Nonetheless, {{it has been}} proposed that the Argonaute protein, Ago 1, is the key initial trigger for heterochromatin assembly via its association with Dicer-independent "priRNAs. " The RITS complex physically links Ago 1 and the H 3 -K 9 me binding protein Chp 1. Here we exploit an assay for heterochromatin assembly in which loss of silencing by deletion of RNAi or Clr-C components can be reversed by re-introduction of the deleted gene. We showed previously that a mutant version of the RITS complex (Tas 3 (WG)) that biochemically separates Ago 1 from Chp 1 and Tas 3 proteins permits maintenance of heterochromatin, but prevents its formation when Clr 4 is removed and re-introduced. Here we show that the block occurs with mutants in Clr-C, but not mutants in the RNAi pathway. Thus, Clr-C components, but not RNAi factors, play a more critical role in assembly when the integrity of RITS is disrupted. Consistent with previous reports, cells lacking Clr-C components completely lack H 3 K 9 me 2 on centromeric DNA repeats, whereas RNAi pathway mutants accumulate low levels of H 3 K 9 me 2. Further supporting the existence of RNAi-independent mechanisms for establishment of centromeric heterochromatin, overexpression of clr 4 (+) in clr 4 Δago 1 Δ cells results in some de novo H 3 K 9 me 2 accumulation at centromeres. These findings and our observation that ago 1 Δ and dcr 1 Δ mutants display indistinguishable low levels of H 3 K 9 me 2 (in contrast to a previous report) challenge the model that priRNAs trigger heterochromatin formation. Instead, our results indicate that RNAi cooperates with RNAi-independent factors in the assembly of heterochromatin...|$|R
