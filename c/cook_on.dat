5|$|Pollock's {{remaining}} time {{as governor}} was less eventful. While exploring Tonga in May 1923, he discovered a turtle {{which had been}} branded by Captain <b>Cook</b> <b>on</b> his expedition there in 1773. The turtle was thus known to have lived more than 150 years. He was ordered home on July 26, 1923.|$|E

5|$|Arctic Monkeys are a British indie {{rock band}} from Sheffield, England. Formed in 2002, Arctic Monkeys {{currently}} consists of Alex Turner on lead vocals and guitar, Jamie <b>Cook</b> <b>on</b> guitar, Matt Helders on drums and backing vocals, and Nick O'Malley on bass guitar and backing vocals, a position formerly held by Andy Nicholson. The band's initial popularity came from fan-made demo tapes and online file sharing, and were heralded {{as one of}} the first acts to come to the public attention via the Internet. Commentators suggested at the time that they represented the possibility of a change in the way in which new bands are promoted and marketed. The band eventually signed to the independent record label Domino Records.|$|E
5|$|Daniel Solander {{was living}} in Linnaeus' house during his time as a student in Uppsala. Linnaeus was very fond of him, {{promising}} Solander his oldest daughter's hand in marriage. On Linnaeus' recommendation, Solander travelled to England in 1760, where he met the English botanist Joseph Banks. With Banks, Solander joined James <b>Cook</b> <b>on</b> his expedition to Oceania on the Endeavour in 1768–71. Solander {{was not the only}} apostle to journey with James Cook; Anders Sparrman followed on the Resolution in 1772–75 bound for, among other places, Oceania and South America. Sparrman made many other expeditions, one of them to South Africa.|$|E
5|$|No. 1 Squadron {{returned}} to Australia on 5March 1919, and was disbanded. In 1921, the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) was {{established as a}} separate branch of the military, and on 1January 1922, the squadron was re-formed on paper. Its planned strength, approved by the Air Board in December 1921, was three officers and five airmen, operating four Airco DH.9s. Funding problems for the fledgling Air Force resulted in the disbandment on 1July of No.1 Squadron and other units established at the same time, their aircraft and personnel instead forming a single squadron of six flights {{under the control of}} No.1 Flying Training School (No.1 FTS) at Point Cook. No.1 Squadron was reactivated as an operational unit of the RAAF reserve, known as the Citizen Air Force (CAF), at Point <b>Cook</b> <b>on</b> 1July 1925. Its commanding officer was Flight Lieutenant Harry Cobby.|$|E

5|$|To get to Europe, Trotter {{posed as}} a seaman seeking work in New York, {{and got a}} job as a <b>cook</b> <b>on</b> the SS Yarmouth to gain passage to France. He arrived in Paris alone and with little more than his cook's clothing, only to find that the {{principal}} peace negotiations had already taken place. The powers did not include any statement of racial equality. Trotter attracted the French press in his accounts of racial mistreatment in the United States, but he could not gain access to any of the official delegations to the peace conference. He also missed Du Bois' Pan-African Congress, which was held in February 1919 while he was still seeking passage.|$|E
5|$|Under {{the present}} classification, Myrmecia {{is the only}} extant genus in the tribe Myrmeciini, {{subfamily}} Myrmeciinae. It {{is a member of}} the family Formicidae, belonging to the order Hymenoptera. The type species for the genus is M. gulosa, discovered by Joseph Banks in 1770 during his expedition with James <b>Cook</b> <b>on</b> the HMS Endeavour. M. gulosa is among the earliest Australian insects to be described, and the specimen Banks collected is housed in the Joseph Banks Collection in the Natural History Museum in London. M. gulosa was described by Fabricius in 1775 under the name Formica gulosa and later designated as the type species of Myrmecia in 1840.|$|E
5|$|A re-think was required. Cook had the unenviable task of {{explaining}} {{the failure to}} the government. Henceforth, he would take a tighter grip on the hydrogen bomb programme, gradually superseding Penney. The scientists and politicians considered abandoning Green Granite. The Minister of Defence, Duncan Sandys, queried <b>Cook</b> <b>on</b> the imperative to persist with thermonuclear designs, given that Orange Herald satisfied most military requirements, and the tests were very expensive. Cook replied that megaton-range fission bombs represented an uneconomical use of expensive fissile material; {{that they could not}} be built to produce yields of more than a megaton; and that they could not be made small enough to be carried by aircraft smaller than the V-bombers, or on missiles. Sandys was not convinced, but he authorised further tests, as did the Prime Minister, now Harold Macmillan following Eden's resignation {{in the wake of the}} Suez crisis. The earliest possible date was November 1957 unless the Operation Antler tests were cancelled; but the Foreign Office warned that a moratorium on nuclear testing might come into effect in late October.|$|E

5|$|With Petre {{on active}} duty, Harrison {{took on the}} main {{responsibility}} for providing basic flying training to the pilots {{of the first three}} squadrons to be formed in Australia for overseas service. Many of his students would go on to play a prominent role in the future Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF), including Bill Anderson, Harry Cobby, Adrian Cole, Frank McNamara, Lawrence Wackett, and Henry Wrigley. Having graduated twenty-four new pilots by the end of 1915, Harrison was able to establish the first AFC squadron, designated No.67 (Australian) Squadron, Royal Flying Corps; it was however commonly known as No.1 Squadron AFC from its inception, and officially so from 1January 1918. The unit departed for Egypt in March 1916 under the command of Lieutenant Colonel E.H. Reynolds. Nos. 3 and 4 Squadrons AFC were formed at Point Cook in late 1916 to operate in France following advanced training in England. In addition to his instructional and administrative duties, Harrison put his mechanical abilities to use initiating the building of aero engines in Australia and maintaining the CFS's complement of airframes; according to Wackett, only Harrison had the skill to keep the obsolescent machines in the air. He was appointed officer-in-charge of CFS in June 1917 with the temporary rank of major; this was made permanent in September 1918. The CFS was disbanded at Point <b>Cook</b> <b>on</b> 31December 1919.|$|E
5|$|A third ship, the Manantico also {{crashed into}} shore {{due to a}} {{combination}} of the storm and human error in which the captain confused Cape Henry with Cape Charles after spotting another schooner. The Manantico was also where the two deaths associated with the storm occurred. The first was when a <b>cook</b> <b>on</b> the ship was crushed to death by the cargo of lumber being hauled by the ship. The ship was then pushed towards a sand bar. The captain, who had stayed high on the starboard side for safety, began climbing down to slip the ship cables, but the ship made a sudden stop. This flung the captain into the water, and he drowned. Both bodies were found after the storm and were very disfigured. The captain was sent to Middletown, Connecticut for interment while the body of the cook was buried on the beach. The final ship was the Harriet Thomas, which was the schooner spotted by the Manantico. After beaching, the crew managed to get a rope to shore where fishermen had tied the other end. The crew were able to climb ashore, although the captain had to be rescued via alternate means due to being too heavy for this method. The ship was written off as a $7000 (1887 USD) loss. Although all four ships were beached, due to the loss of communications, only one wreck – that of the Mary D. Cranmer – was reported in the Norfolk Virginian newspaper. As a result, news of the two deaths from the Manantico were initially unreported.|$|E
