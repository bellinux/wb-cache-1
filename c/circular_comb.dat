50|$|The {{rectilinear}} comb uses a <b>circular</b> <b>comb</b> {{mounted on a}} drum to comb out the fringe and remove short fiber (set by a scale so fibers less than, for example, 25 mm are removed) not held by a clamping mechanism. The row of pins known as a top comb is a very fine tooth comb, for example 25 teeth per inch; it is inserted in cylindrical combed fringe {{to act as an}} impediment to contaminates (burr, seed etc.) flow. The top comb acts as an impediment to contamination moving into a combed sliver. On a next circular combing short finer and contaminates are removed. The circular combing without short fibers are placed on a moving belt in an overlapping motion. The circular combing and top comb insertion is repeated and combed fibers - now called tuft are overlapped. The overlapping produces some cohesion allowing the tuft then to be twisted to form a combed sliver. This sliver is weak and unsuitable for spinning. To allow spinning to take place additional gilling is required to introduce fiber end irregularity (Sokolov 1994).|$|E
40|$|This work {{presents}} a laterally rotating micromachined platform integrated under optical waveguides {{to control the}} in-plane propagation direction of light within a die to select one of multiple outputs. The platform is designed to exhibit low constant optical losses throughout the motion range and is actuated electrostatically using an optimized <b>circular</b> <b>comb</b> drive. An angular motion of ± 9. 5 ° using 180 V is demonstrated. To minimize the optical losses between the moving and fixed parts, a gap-closing mechanism is implemented to reduce the initial air gap to submicron values. A latch structure is implemented to hold the platform in place with a resolution of 0. 25 ° over the entire motion range. The platform was integrated with silicon nitride waveguides to create a crossbar switch and preliminary optical measurements are reported. In the bar state, the loss {{was measured to be}} 14. 8 dB with the gap closed whereas in the cross state it was 12. 2 dB. To the authors’ knowledge, this is the first optical switch based on a rotating microelectromechanical device with integrated silicon nitride waveguides reported to date...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} a {{magnetostrictive}} phased array sensor (MPAS) with a polycrystalline nickel patch of a <b>circular</b> <b>comb</b> shape {{in order for the}} use of the ultrasonic guided Lamb wave inspection technique. The MPAS was comprised of two main components of the surface-mounted nickel patch and a mobile magnetic circuit device enclosing six sensing coils and center-positioned cylindrical biasing magnets. The magnetic circuit device detects the magnetic property change induced by the elastic wave propagation through the magnetostrictive nickel patch bonded to a thin aluminum plate. The individual sensing coils were configured to have directional preferences specified along the perpendicular direction of the coil winding, and they were arranged in a hexagon with a radius of 0. 5 ” to form a compact-sized phased array sensor. Although the magnetic circuit device contains only six physical sensing coils, the MPAS enables to increase the total numbers of sensing positions by altering the orientation of the magnetic circuit device. The enhanced directional sensing capability of the presented MPAS was achieved as a result of the combined effect on the high magnetic shape anisotropy feature along the individual comb finger directions of the nickel patch and the directional sensitivity of the hexagon magnetic circuit device itself...|$|E
50|$|Combing is {{a method}} for {{preparing}} carded fiber for spinning. Combing is divided into linear and <b>circular</b> <b>combing.</b> The Noble comb {{is an example of}} <b>circular</b> <b>combing.</b> The French comb is an example of linear combing. The process of combing is accompanied by gilling, a process of evening out carded or combed top making it suitable for spinning. Combing separates out short fibers by means of a rotating ring or rectilinear row of steel pins. The fibers in the 'top' it produces have been straightened and lie parallel to each other. When combing wool, the discarded short fibers are called noils, and are ground up into shoddy.|$|R
50|$|The <b>circular</b> <b>combs</b> used {{have long}} metal teeth, and only barely {{resemble}} the comb used on hair. However, {{they are used}} {{in a similar fashion}} with one comb holding the fiber, which is slowly dubbed in by a brush, while the other is moved through, slowly transferring the fiber to the moving comb.|$|R
50|$|A ranchu's back (seen {{from the}} side) is {{compared}} to a traditional Japanese comb, which comes in two shapes. The first comb-shape (the nagate or long style) is long with rounded corners and {{is similar to the}} koban coin. While the second comb-shape (the marute or the round style) is shorter, round and is similar to a round coin viewed from the side, but still not as round as any modern-day <b>circular</b> coins. Both <b>comb</b> shapes are acceptable in ranchu exhibitions and competitions.|$|R
2500|$|At {{the time}} of its closure in April 1981, Coldharbour Mill still had its textile {{machinery}} in position. The majority of these machines have been preserved (though not all are exhibited), and have been augmented with weaving machines rescued from the closure of the Tonedale site. The lowest part of the site, the level 1 combing shed, dealt with the initial cleaning and combing of the unwashed wool. The process involved a number of separate stages, each with a specialised machine. The eight opening gill machines (made by Taylor Wadsworth & Co)opened up the fleeces and prepared the wool for washing in a large back-washer with steam heated rollers. Following the washing, further gill boxes produced successively combed fibres, which were passed to a <b>circular</b> Noble <b>combing</b> machine. [...] This machine separated the fibres into long [...] "Tops" [...] and the short poor quality fibres. Although these machines are preserved on site, they are no longer in use today. British wool tops are purchased in, dyed into standard colours, and then up to ten strands of tops are fed into the Intersecting Gill Box (manufactured by Prince Smith and Stells in 1959). [...] The gill box starts the process of drawing out the fibres, and also enables new colours to be created by blending together the standard colours. The output of the gill box is termed a sliver. This particular machine has a mechanism to ensure the weight of the sliver is constant, which is important to ensure the final yarn thickness is constant.|$|R

This particular machine has a mechanism to ensure the weight of the sliver is constant, which is important to ensure the final yarn thickness is constant. The next process is to draw the slivers out further, and to give the fibres a small twist to strengthen the resulting slubbing such that it can be wound onto a bobbin. At Coldharbour Mill, this is demonstrated on a Price Smith and Stells draw box of 1959. The bobbins from this machine are then placed in a further draw box by Prince Smith and Stells, this time an 1898 machine, and the thread from a pair of bobbins is drawn out to a seventh of its diameter, and given a light twist. If this output is to be used for Aran yarn production, it is termed a roving, and is sent on to the spinning frame. However, if the slubbing is for double knitting yarn, the slubbing must go through another reduction on a draw box.|$|R
