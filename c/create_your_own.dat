2500|$|The Seth Material {{says that}} all {{individuals}} create their own circumstances and experiences within the shared earthly environment, similar to the doctrine of responsibility assumption. This concept is expressed in the phrase [...] "you <b>create</b> <b>your</b> <b>own</b> reality", which may have originated with the Seth readings. The inner self, or inner ego, {{is responsible for the}} construction and maintenance of the individual's physical body and immediate physical environment, and the unfolding of events is determined by the expectations, attitudes and beliefs of the outer ego, that portion of the self that human beings know as themselves. [...] "If you want to change your world, you must first change your thoughts, expectations, and beliefs." [...] Or, more succinctly: [...] "You get what you concentrate upon. There is no other main rule".|$|E

2500|$|The term “open” in open theism {{involves}} {{two important}} ideas: (1) God {{is open to}} what creatures do (God is affected by creatures) and (2) the future is open in that there are multiple possible futures (the branching tree model of the future or like a <b>create</b> <b>your</b> <b>own</b> story book). [...] Because God is open to us, God enters into genuine give-and-receive relations with creatures. For example, God truly responds to our prayers. God responds to {{what we do and}} adjusts the divine plans, if necessary. For Sanders, God has flexible strategies for accomplish divine goals (there is more than one route to the destination). There is not a blueprint which God is following for the construction of the kingdom. Rather, it “is a lot like jazz, a melody with a good deal of improvisation.” Open theists are clear to affirm with other freewill theists, however, that even though God has changing emotions, plans, and actions, the divine nature does not change. God’s love, wisdom, power, faithfulness, etc. are unchangeable.|$|E
2500|$|Playing as {{a general}} manager {{is similar to the}} {{previous}} General Manager modes in the series, in which one has to choose a brand and act as its General Manager (Jonathan Coachman for Raw, Theodore Long for SmackDown!, Tommy Dreamer for ECW), draft a roster and make decisions to make it the most popular brand of the three. The General Manager is allowed to make staffing decisions, schedule workouts and events. This was also the last game in the Smackdown vs Raw series to have a General Manager mode. There is also an all-new Tournament Mode, which allows the player to control [...] a superstar through the various stages of the WWE tournament, such as Beat The Clock Sprint [...] and King of the Ring, as well as Money in the Bank tournament. The game also allows you to <b>create</b> <b>your</b> <b>own</b> tournament. (This feature is excluded from the Nintendo DS version.) Like previous games in the series, the game also allows players to challenge for and defend championships. The game includes championships used by the WWE in 2007, bringing back the branded championships from the previous game and for the first time, the ECW Championship.|$|E
