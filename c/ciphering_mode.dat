40|$|AbstractCiphering is very {{important}} operation to preserve the confidentiality of digital images transmitted over public network spatially with rapidly growth in communication techniques. Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) is a famous and strong encryption algorithm which has several advantages in data ciphering. However, AES suffer from some drawbacks such as high computations, pattern in ciphered images, and hardware requirement. Those problems are more complicated when AES algorithm willusefor images ciphering especially the HD images. Some modifications were proposed in this paper to enhance the performance of AES algorithm {{in terms of time}} ciphering and pattern appearance. First modification is decreasing the number of rounds to one while the second modification is replace the S-box with new S-box to decrease the hardware requirements. Applying AES in one of the <b>ciphering</b> <b>mode</b> solves the pattern appearance problems. The experimental results indicate that the proposed modifications make AES algorithm faster while fulfill the security requirements...|$|E

Sensor nodes are used {{in many areas of}} interest: from military fields to environment monitoring, from medical applications then to domotic uses. One of the most common radio communication protocol designed for Personal Area Network (PAN) is described by the IEEE 802. 15. 4 standard. Data communication among devices can be protected on a per frame basis, allowing to provide data authenticity and data con dentiality. With reference to the IEEE 802. 15. 4 MAC layer, the security sublayer was implemented, providing the main security features the standard describes. In particular, the TinyOS implementation for the TelosB mote was considered, as well as its CC 2420 chipset features. The main goal of this work is exploit the IEEE 802. 15. 4 security mechanisms for both sending and receiving ciphered frames, as well as integrate IEEE 802. 15. 4 security suite with the security features provided by the CC 2420 chipset. A two nodes network scenario was considered. Besides, <b>ciphering</b> <b>mode</b> only was used, while all security options and parameters were statically set up.

For the latter, it is assumed that key management has to be done on regular user hardware in the absence of any special security hardware like key tokens.
