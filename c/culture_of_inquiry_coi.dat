Responding to past criticism (e. g.

Analysis of input includes quantitative content analysis of discussions using the Community <b>of</b> <b>Inquiry</b> (<b>CoI)</b> framework. Analysis <b>of</b> outcomes looks at both the quality of student learning artifacts such as case studies using the Structure of Observed Learning Outcomes (SOLO) taxonomy as well as instructor assigned grades of specific related assignments.

40|$|ABSTRACT OF THE DISSERTATIONThe Struggle is Real: Student Perceptions of Quality in Online Courses {{using the}} Community <b>of</b> <b>Inquiry</b> (<b>CoI)</b> FrameworkbyBarbara TaylorDoctor <b>of</b> Education in Educational LeadershipUniversity of California, San Diego, 2016 California State University, San Marcos, 2016 Carolyn Huie Hofstetter, ChairCalifornia {{is in an}} {{educational}} drought and is facing a “college deficit” of college graduates. By 2030, it is anticipated that California will have a 1. 1 million shortage of college-educated workers (Diaz, 2015). The struggle is real {{for people who want}} to get into college and for those who are in college trying to complete their higher education degree. As learners progress through the higher education system, various obstacles may happen in their lives to derail and divert their path to degree completion. To fulfill that desire, an increasing number of students are taking online courses and/or participating in online degree programs. The number of students taking online courses has increased for the 13 th consecutive year (Allen & Seamans, 2016). This puts tremendous pressure on higher education faculty and administrators to demonstrate that online courses are equal to or better than face-to-face courses in terms of quality and student success due to the scrutiny about the quality of online courses by faculty, students, administrators, accrediting bodies, and legislatures. One of the ways to examine the quality of instruction is to evaluate levels of social, teaching, and cognitive presence in online courses. Using the Community <b>of</b> <b>Inquiry</b> (<b>CoI)</b> framework, this study looked at the perceptions of quality from the student viewpoint. The literature review revealed there is little research that looks at quality through the lens of a student. This is the first study to investigate all three elements of the Community <b>of</b> <b>Inquiry</b> (<b>CoI)</b> framework operationalized through the California State University (CSU) Quality Online Learning and Teaching (QOLT) instrument. The survey instrument measures undergraduate student perceptions of social, teaching, and cognitive presence in addition to accessibility, technology, and user support elements. The data from the 113 participants matriculating at a mid-sized, four-year university indicate that undergraduate students perceived the courses with all three elements of social, teaching, and cognitive presence to be high quality courses. The data from a single undergraduate instructor illustrates the importance of developing student-focused courses with social, teaching, and cognitive presence. Limitations, implications, and areas for future research are presented...|$|R

In the absence of a validated instrument for measuring the success of the community <b>of</b> <b>inquiry</b> design at a program level, the CoI survey for online courses was adapted and used with the second cohort of online students (n = 18). This article presents (a) an extension of the construct’s cognitive, teaching, and social presence for online programs, and (b) an instrument to measure student perceptions of a CoI that encompasses asynchronous and synchronous interactions, as well as course-specific and non-course-specific interactions in different learning spaces...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: To {{describe}} {{a model for}} infusing the generalized empirical method (GEM) into a Schoolwide Core Signature IPE Experience to create a <b>Culture</b> <b>of</b> <b>Inquiry.</b> Background: As we continue to develop and refine IPE experiential learning opportunities at Seton Hall University amongst the commonality identified across health science professionals {{is the need to}} use “inquiry” to promote and develop evidenced based patient-centered care plans. Creating a <b>culture</b> <b>of</b> <b>inquiry</b> within our IPE experiential learning opportunities is paramount as learning experiences are but an “invitation to an intellectual journey”. Bernard Lonergan who wrote on the “Generalized Empirical Method” (GEM), and self-appropriation suggests that one’s ability to get to know themselves in the deepest sense via true understanding is a means for knowing and understanding all other disciplines. As part of the interprofessional community of learners, educators must promote students intellectual journey with personal effort, involvement, and self-reflection to insure that transformation of one’s self emerges. Armed with deeper insight students can begin to engage in interprofessional dialogues which seeks to disperse academic “silos” for the emergence of a common ground for effective patient-centered care. This presentation will describe how the GEM was infused into a Schoolwide Core Signature IPE Experience to create a <b>culture</b> <b>of</b> <b>inquiry.</b> Preliminary Results: Qualitative data from faculty and student focused interviews exploring perceptions of GEM infused IPE Core Signature experience in promoting a <b>culture</b> <b>of</b> <b>inquiry</b> will be shared. Relevance and Recommendations: Developing rich and meaningful interprofessional learning opportunities is not only paramount for students, but for healthcare professions and the patients they serve. Interprofessional practice environments need insightful inquisitive healthcare professionals {{to meet the needs of}} our diverse populations. This model infuses the GEM to support student’s intellectual insight development, self-appropriation and thereby create an IP <b>culture</b> <b>of</b> <b>inquiry.</b> OBJECTIVES Upon completion of this presentation participants will be able to: Discuss the underlining tenets associated with GEM used in a Schoolwide Core Signature IPE Experience to create a <b>culture</b> <b>of</b> <b>inquiry</b> Describe options for GEM in their own IPE experiences to promote a <b>culture</b> <b>of</b> inquir...|$|R
