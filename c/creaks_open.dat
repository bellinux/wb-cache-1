5000|$|After the {{incident}} in the subway the films plot cuts to nine months later where Julia is shown hospitalized in a mental institution. Julia manages to convince a panel of psychiatrists including Dr. Booth that she has regained her sanity. She then sees one of the creatures climb through an air shaft in the ceiling but continues to deny their existence. She is finally released and proceeds to set up high powered lights all over her apartment room. The camera then pulls out of her bedroom as she is seen sitting on her bed. A door <b>creaks</b> <b>open</b> in her darkened hall and the film cuts to black. (This ending was shown to test audiences which was deleted and re-filmed after test audiences responded negatively to the ending, for some reason this ending is unavailable in any DVD.) ...|$|E
50|$|Chick and Wilbur {{deliver the}} crates after hours. They open {{the first one}} and find Dracula's coffin. When Chick leaves the room to {{retrieve}} the second crate, Wilbur reads aloud the Dracula legend printed on an exhibit card. The coffin slowly <b>creaks</b> <b>open.</b> Wilbur is so frightened that his attempts to call Chick result in helpless sputtering. Before Chick returns with the second crate, Dracula climbs unnoticed out of his coffin and hides in the shadows. Wilbur claims that the coffin opened, but Chick shows him {{that it is in}} fact empty. While the boys open the second crate containing the Monster, Chick leaves the room to greet McDougal and the insurance agent. Dracula now hypnotizes Wilbur and re-animates the Monster. They both leave, and by the time McDougal, the insurance agent, and Chick enter, both crates are empty. McDougal accuses the boys of theft and has them arrested.|$|E
50|$|The radio edit omits {{sound effects}} which are {{heard on the}} album version: door slowly <b>{{creaking}}</b> <b>open</b> at the beginning, {{and the sound of}} a gunshot at the end with the sound of the door slowly creaking closed.|$|R
60|$|The man {{left the}} room. They heard him {{withdraw}} the chain from the door. Bernadine wiped {{the sweat from}} his forehead as he listened. He still gripped the revolver in his hand. Peter had changed his position a little and was standing now behind a high-backed chair. They heard the door <b>creak</b> <b>open,</b> a voice outside, and presently the tramp of heavy footsteps. Peter nodded understandingly.|$|R
5000|$|Emily {{picks up}} Jesse from jail and drives {{him to the}} church, where Jesse informs her that he's quitting and will make an {{announcement}} on Sunday. Inside the church, Jesse sits on a pew, where he decides to ask for God's help one last time. Getting no response, he lights up a cigarette. The doors <b>creak</b> <b>open</b> and the pews move. A supernatural shadow, which reveals itself to be the [...] "comet", approaches Jesse and slams him to the ground.|$|R
5000|$|... "billie227" [...] then {{messages}} Blaire and Mitch, wanting them {{to confess}} who uploaded the video {{in the first}} place. Blaire tries to deny any involvement from Mitch but eventually reveals {{that he was to}} blame. Mitch immediately grabs a knife and stabs himself in the eye. [...] "billie227", now unveiled as Laura herself, asks for one more thing. Blaire desperately tries to remind Laura of their friendship while she was alive. Laura then uploads a different version of the video which caused her to commit suicide, revealing that Blaire is the one who recorded it. The video is then uploaded onto Facebook through Blaire's profile feed showing everyone what Blaire had done, resulting in people leaving angry and disgusted comments of Blaire's actions. Laura signs off and leaves her alone for a moment. Then Blaire's bedroom door <b>creaks</b> <b>open</b> and a pair of hands slam her laptop shut. Laura lunges at Blaire, presumably killing her. Afterward, Laura gives the camera an unleashed scream.|$|E
50|$|A {{telephone}} operator is walking {{out with a}} handsome police sergeant; her father insists that the husband for her is a plump, comfortable grocery store owner. The Lady picks up her jewels from the jewellery and brings them home, followed by a jewel thief on a stolen bicycle. She puts them in her safe, and goes to give the telephone girl a present of a necklace in thanks for her work. As the Lady answers the telephone and accepts the Telephone Girl's effusive thanks, the door <b>creaks</b> <b>open</b> - it is the masked thief! She tells {{the girl on the}} other end of the line that she's being robbed. While the thief grills the lady, the telephone girl calls the police, but there's a riot and calls about that prevent her getting through. She runs out of the exchange and spots the sergeant conveniently riding by. He lifts her onto his horse and they gallop to the rescue. Meanwhile, with an implicit rape threat the thief has forced the lady to reveal the safe concealed behind a picture. Just in time, the sergeant bursts in as the thief escapes with the jewels. After a rousing fight, helped by the feisty telephone girl and neighbours including a lady in a huge hat, the sergeant drags away the thief. The lady rewards the sergeant and the lovers fall into each other's arms.|$|E
60|$|Every {{one knows}} what a fascination there is in {{wandering}} {{up and down in}} a deserted old tenement in some warm, dreamy country; where the vacant halls seem echoing of silence, and the doors <b>creak</b> <b>open</b> like the footsteps of strangers; and into every window the old garden trees thrust their dark boughs, like the arms of night-burglars; and ever and anon the nails start from the wainscot; while behind it the mice rattle like dice. Up and down in such old specter houses one loves to wander; and so much the more, if the place be haunted by some marvelous story.|$|R
40|$|Affirmative action {{efforts have}} {{resulted}} in the recruitment of more women to junior faculty positions in schools of social work. However, the promo-tion and retention of women faculty members often depends on the women’s ability to write for publication in addition to all the other heavy demands of their positions. This article reports on a self-help group to increase the scholarly output of its three women members. It describes the development of the group, its structure and process, its areas of conflict, and the factors that contributed to its success. Suggestions are made for adapting the effort to other settings. Efforts by schools of social work {{to increase the number of}} female faculty members and promote them to tenure and senior rank have collided with a depressed economy, a political conservatism that has led national policy away from affirmative action, and severe budget cuts for institutions of higher learning. Just as the doors to the opportunity structure began to <b>creak</b> <b>open</b> for women in th...|$|R
60|$|A {{very little}} thing, he knew, {{would turn the}} scale, an effort made in delirium, a draught that struck too shrewdly on the fevered frame, and the issue, of stupendous {{importance}} {{as it was to}} both of them, lay in his daughter's hands. Seaforth and the doctor slept the sleep of exhaustion, and Deringham could have laughed with bitter mirthlessness at the irony of it all. Until she had quarrelled with her maid, Alice Deringham had apparently been incapable of putting on her own dresses unassisted, and it seemed that the grim, mysterious destiny which treated men as puppets and traversed all their schemes was the one factor to reckon with in that comedy. Deringham, however, found little solace in such reflections, and could not lie still, and rising, strained his ears to listen. There was nothing but the moaning of the wind, the ranch was very still, and the sound of his watch grew maddening. If Alton was sleeping now, Deringham knew it was ticking his last hold on good fame and fortune away. Twice he paced up and down the room with uncovered feet, and then, quivering a little when the floor <b>creaked,</b> <b>opened</b> the door that led into the one adjoining.|$|R

5000|$|Shaenon K. Garrity {{wrote for}} About.com that [...] "this {{may be the}} screwed-up manga of your dreams" [...] or a work that should be avoided {{depending}} on one's tates. Although it features [...] "disturbing adult material", she stated, [...] "His teen-girl protagonists are sexualized in a way that's so casual it's strangely inoffensive". Garrity praised its [...] "vibrantly sketchy art" [...] and its [...] "original take on zombie horror". In her words, [...] "Matsumoto twists the raw material of a straightforward zombie horror romp into a trippy, Donnie Darko-like plunge into the psychic darkness, peppering it with dark humor". Joseph Luster of Otaku USA praised how it [...] "manages to be both fun and sad", affirming [...] "Velveteen & Mandala will stay in your head and beg to be reread". He said it is sexual but [...] "not titillating"; it is [...] "a 'gross-out' book that plays with the reader, <b>creaking</b> <b>open</b> the door to hint at something more before slamming it shut on the reader's fingers and gleefully scooting along to more head-popping and scat humor." [...] David Brothers of ComicsAlliance said, [...] "Velveteen & Mandala is a funny, touching, scary, violent, and deeply uncomfortable comic" [...] and that [...] "the exact manga you need if you're a fan of Johnny Ryan's Prison Pit, Charles Burns's Black Hole, or seeing some good old-fashioned gross action." ...|$|R
60|$|The <b>{{creaking}}</b> lock-gates <b>opened</b> slowly, and {{the light}} boat passed in as soon as there was room enough, and the creaking lock-gates closed upon it, and it floated low down in the dock between {{the two sets of}} gates, until the water should rise and the second gates should open and let it out. When Riderhood had run to his second windlass and turned it, and while he leaned against the lever of that gate to help it to swing open presently, he noticed, lying to rest under the green hedge by the towing-path astern of the Lock, a Bargeman.|$|R
6000|$|The statue {{began to}} <b>creak,</b> then <b>opened</b> like a door, though very unwillingly, as though its hinges had been fixed for a long, {{long time and}} rusted in the damp, which was indeed the case. Inside of it, like a corpse in an upright coffin, {{appeared}} a figure, a square, strong figure, clad in a tattered monk's robe, surmounted by a large head with fiery red hair and beetling brows, beneath which shone two wild grey eyes. Emlyn, whose heart had stood still--for, after all, Satan is awkward company for a mortal woman--waited till it gave a jump in her breast and went on again as usual. Then she said quietly-- ...|$|R
60|$|The waiter {{handed it}} to him and {{extinguished}} the gas, and at the same moment all distinctly heard a step in the passage outside. It stopped at the door, and as they watched with bated breath, the door <b>creaked</b> and slowly <b>opened.</b> Malcolm fell back open-mouthed, as a white, leering face, with sunken eyeballs and close-cropped bullet head, appeared at the opening.|$|R
60|$|And when at dawn, {{the great}} copper gates did slowly swing <b>open,</b> <b>creaking</b> upon their massive hinges, {{it was as}} if the flood-gates of a mighty sea had been {{suddenly}} let loose. In they poured, thousands upon thousands of them, scrambling, pushing and jumping, scurrying and hurrying, falling and tumbling, as they pressed onwards through the wide doors and then dispersed in the vastness of the gigantic arena, like ants that scamper away to their heaps.|$|R
60|$|The horror ceased at last, {{and later}} {{we heard the}} door unlock and a man's foot upon the landing above. Hal beckoned to me, and swiftly we slipped out and down the <b>creaking</b> stairs. He <b>opened</b> the front door, and we waited in the evil-smelling little passage. The man came towards us whistling. He was a powerfully built fellow, rather good-looking, I remember. He stopped {{abruptly}} upon catching sight of Hal, who stood crouching {{in the shadow of}} the door.|$|R

60|$|Save for the {{dripping}} from the barrels, the rustling of such light fragments of destruction {{as the wind}} affected, and the dull <b>creaking</b> of the <b>open</b> doors, all was profoundly quiet: indeed, these sounds, like the ticking of the death-watch in the night, only made the silence they invaded deeper and more apparent. But quiet or noisy, it was all one to John. If a train of heavy artillery could have come up and commenced ball practice outside the window, {{it would have been}} all the same to him. He was a long way beyond surprise. A ghost couldn't have overtaken him.|$|R
5000|$|The program's {{familiar}} and famed audio trademark was the eerie <b>creaking</b> door which <b>opened</b> {{and closed the}} broadcasts. Himan Brown got the idea from a door in the basement that [...] "squeaked like Hell." [...] The door sound was actually made by a rusty desk chair. The program did originally intend to use a door, but on its first use, the door did not creak. Undaunted, Brown grabbed a nearby chair, sat in it and turned, causing a hair-raising squeak. The chair was used from then on as the sound prop. On at least one memorable occasion, a staffer innocently repaired and oiled the chair, thus forcing the sound man to mimic the squeak orally.|$|R
5000|$|Many of {{the townspeople}} feared that Chief Posey and his warriors would return {{and kill the}} {{settlers}} because Jane stood up to him. Some time later, he did return. Jane was in her kitchen cooking cornbread {{when she heard the}} door to her cabin <b>creaking</b> as it <b>opened.</b> Chief Posey's hat, {{on the end of a}} stick was pushed through the opening of the door. Within a few seconds, Posey stuck his head in the room and announced, [...] "me no mad, me want biscuit!" [...] Jane told him to wait in the corner and she'd fix him something to eat. From that day forward, Jane and the Indian Chief were good friends.|$|R

And {{suddenly}} the door <b>creaked</b> and flew <b>open,</b> and a great heavy chest was pushed in, and behind it came the step-daughter, radiant and beautiful, in a dress all glittering with silver and gold. For a moment the step-mother's eyes were dazzled. Then she called to her husband: 'Old man, yoke the horses at once into the sledge, and take my daughter to the same field and leave her on the same spot exactly; 'and so the old man took the girl and left her beneath the same tree where he had parted from his daughter.

50|$|Alicia wakes {{before sunrise}} with two golden feline eyes staring at her. She ignores {{the animal and}} thinks about her friends in the city, as she gets dressed. Max {{knocks on the door}} to tell her Roland has arrived.She joins the boys outside and there is an instant {{connection}} between Roland and Alicia, who are the same age. Knowing there is an extra bike in the garage, Max enjoys the flirtatious scene, and tells Alicia she will have to balance on Roland’s handlebars down to the beach.At the beach, Roland shows them his shack, where he sleeps during the summers. The inside is filled with trinkets and treasures that Roland has recovered from his dives down to the shipwreck just off shore.The boys prepare for their dive and Alicia waits on shore. Max is mesmerized by the experience of the cool water, and the serene silence {{beneath the surface of the}} ocean, but he leaves the deep diving to his friend.Roland discovers some new treasures, while Max observes from a distance, noticing the ship’s name inscribed on the bow, the Orpheus. Through the water, he dimly sees an old, tattered flag ebbing with the current. As it unfurls, horror seizes Max as he recognizes the symbol he had seen in the garden of a six-pointed star enclosed in a circle. He immediately swims back to the beach.When Roland joins the Carver children on the beach, Alicia begins collecting seashells, and once she is out of earshot, Max tells Roland about the symbol and the circus figures.Alicia returns to the boys and begins to ask Roland about his grandfather and the ship. Roland invites them into the cabin and promises to tell them the full story there.Meanwhile, back at the Carver home, we learn that Irina has been hearing voices in the house, and now hears them in her room, much like a whisper in the walls. It seems to be coming from her wardrobe, and as she approaches it, she sees there is a key in the lock. She hurriedly turns it to the locked position, and steps back. The sound continues, and hearing her mother calling her, Irina turns to run from the room. An icy breeze sweeps past her and slams the door shut, and she struggles with the handle, looking over her shoulder. She sees the key slowly turning; the voices become louder, and she hears laughter…Back in Roland’s shack, Roland tells Alicia and Max more about the Orpheus, retelling all that his grandfather, Victor Kray, has told him about the accident, and the events leading up to it.The Orpheus began as a cargo ship with a bad reputation, operated by a corrupt Dutchman who rented the ship out to anyone who would pay, including smugglers and criminals. The Dutchman was also a gambler, and he had accumulated a lot of debt, which made him desperate to gamble more. He lost a big card game to a man named Mr. Cain, who owned a travelling circus, known for employing shady criminals. Knowing the police were closing in on he and his group’s criminal activities, Mr. Cain charged The Dutchman with transporting his evil posse across the Channel on his ship, and the man agreed.Roland’s grandfather had the misfortune of knowing Mr. Cain for some time, and had unfinished business of some sort with him. He did not want Mr. Cain to leave the town without settling things with Victor first, so hearing of his plot to escape the town, he boarded the Orpheus as a stowaway, not even sure what he would do when he confronted Mr. Cain.He wouldn’t have to, as it turned out, as the ship crashed, and Mr. Cain and all of the other passengers on the ship were killed, save Victor, who was spared thanks to the hiding place he had chosen - a lifeboat.But they never found any bodies.Max and Alicia point out that something seemed to be missing from Victor Kray’s story, and Roland agrees…Back at the Carver house, Irina feels her hands go numb, and she continues to fumble with the door, and she watches in horror as the key turns in the lock, finally stops moving, and is then pushed out of the keyhole, falling to the floor. The wardrobe begins to <b>creak</b> <b>open,</b> and Irina tries to scream as a shape emerges from the wardrobe - the cat. She kneels to pick it up, but then notices something behind the cat, deeper in the wardrobe. The cat opens its jaws and hisses at her, then retreats back into the wardrobe, and a giant smile filled with light appears in the darkness with two glowing golden eyes, and all of the voices she has been hearing say “Irina” in unison. Irina screams and throws herself against the bedroom door, which gives away, and she stumbles into the hallway, and hurls herself down the stairs.Downstairs, Andrea Carver has heard her daughter’s scream, and runs to the base of the stairs just in time to see her child tumbling down to the bottom, a tear of blood escaping from her forehead. Mrs. Carver feels her pulse, and finding it is weak, calls the doctor. Holding her unconscious child, she looks up the stairs to see the cat watching her coldly.|$|R
6000|$|There was {{genius in}} his house, too, I thought, {{when we got}} there; there was {{imagination}} in the carpets and curtains, in the pictures and books, in the garden behind it, where certain old brown walls were muffled in creepers that appeared to me to have been copied from a masterpiece {{of one of the}} pre-Raphaelites. That was the way many things struck me at that time, in England; as if they were reproductions of something that existed primarily in art or literature. It was not the picture, the poem, the fictive page, that seemed to me a copy; these things were the originals, and the life of happy and distinguished people was fashioned in their image. Mark Ambient called his house a cottage, and I perceived afterwards that he was right; for {{if it had not been}} a cottage it must have been a villa, and a villa, in England at least, was not a place in which one could fancy him at home. But it was, to my vision, a cottage glorified and translated; it was a palace of art, on a slightly reduced scale,--it was an old English demesne. It nestled under a cluster of magnificent beeches, it had little <b>creaking</b> lattices that <b>opened</b> out of, or into, pendent mats of ivy, and gables, and old red tiles, as well as a general aspect of being painted in water-colors and inhabited by people whose lives would go on in chapters and volumes. The lawn seemed to me of extraordinary extent, the garden-walls of incalculable height, the whole air of the place delightfully still, private, proper to itself. [...] "My wife must be somewhere about," [...] Mark Ambient said, as we went in. [...] "We shall find her perhaps; we have got about an hour before dinner. She may be in the garden. I will show you my little place." ...|$|R
