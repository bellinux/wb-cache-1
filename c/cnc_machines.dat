In order to solve the above problem, the ergonomics and coupling bionics are adopted to study collaborative optimization design method for <b>CNC</b> <b>machine</b> tools based on the domestic and foreign machine tool design method research achievement. The <b>CNC</b> <b>machine</b> tools' "man-machine-environment" interaction mechanism can be built by combining with ergonomic, and then the CNC ergonomic design criteria is obtained.
