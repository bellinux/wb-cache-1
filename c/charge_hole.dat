We show that correlation effects, calculated within the self-consistent Born approximation, render the hole and electron case very different. An added electron forms a spin-polaron, which closely resembles the well-known cuprates, but the situation of a removed electron is far more complex. Many-body 5 d 4 configurations form which can be singlet and triplets of total angular momentum J and strongly affect the hole motion between AF sublattices. This not only has important ramifications for the interpretation of (inverse-) photoemission experiments of quasi- 2 D iridates but also demonstrates that the correlation physics in electron- and hole-doped iridates is fundamentally different.

In this thesis a series of exchange-correlation functionals are developed using new approaches based on exchange-correlation potentials and enhancement factors. The functionals are assessed {{for a wide range}} of molecular properties. Chapter 1 describes Hartree Fock theory, introducing the key concepts of exchange and correlation. Chapter 2 describes the fundamental ideas of DFT and the implementation of Kohn-Sham theory. Chapter 3 describes a new approach for determining exchange-correlation functionals solely from ab initio potentials. A series of functionals are developed and assessed. Chapter 4 investigates the performance of one of these functionals, which provides particularly high quality structural predictions. A challenging benchmark of sulfur-containing compounds and a new benchmark of diatomic molecules are considered. Results are assessed in terms of the enhancement factor. In Chapter 5, the enhancement factor is used to develop new functionals that satisfy several exact physical conditions. The potential energy curve of the Helium dimer is investigated, since this is known to be sensitive to the enhancement factor. In Chapter 6 a series of hybrid functionals are determined. Particular attention is paid to their performance for chemical reactions and the relationship of these results to self-interaction errors.

For this purpose, the electric discharge impulse crushing method was selected, with liquid nitromethane (NM) taken as the deflagration agent. Employing this technique, NM is set inside charge holes and initiated by electric discharge. The pressure generated by the deflagration of NM in a steel chamber was modeled using the Jones-Wilkins-Lee equation of state. The modeled and measured pressures agreed well and {{the applicability of the}} pressure model was validated. Then, assuming controlled splitting along the expected fracture surface in concrete, dynamic fracture process analysis (DFPA) based on two-dimensional dynamic finite element method was conducted. The results showed that fracture patterns predicted in the DFPAs agreed well with those obtained from experiments. The mechanism of fracture in concrete due to deflagration was then discussed in terms of the fracture process in the controlled splitting. Owing to stress interference from each <b>charge</b> <b>hole,</b> compressive stress zones (CSZs) formed above and below the middle regions between charge holes where maximum and minimum principle stresses were both in compression. The CSZs was found to be important in obtaining a flatter fracture surface in the case of controlled splitting.

40|$|This {{contribution}} {{deals with}} a computational study of hole transfer (HT) and excess electron transfer (EET) in complexes of a buckyball and a molecular catcher having two concave buckybowls as described by Sygula et al. (J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2007, 129, 3842). Three systems are considered:[*] (1) the inclusion complex consisting of the fullerene and catcher subunits, (2) a system formed by two catchers, and (3) a supermolecular system consisting of two fullerene and two catcher molecules. Such a type of organic system is of potential interest {{in the design of}} nanoelectronic devices. HT and EET electronic couplings of the subunits in the systems are calculated using the HF/ 6 - 31 G* method and the semiempirical INDO/S scheme; the calculation of the reorganization energy is carried out within the B 3 LYP/ 6 - 31 G* method. On the basis of the computed values of electronic couplings and reorganization energies, we predict that excess <b>charge</b> (<b>hole</b> or electron) should be strongly confined to a single subunit in the complexes. Then, we suggest that excess charge propagation within the fullerene-catcher system in the solid state occurs as superexchange mediated hopping; in this process, fullerene molecules function as stepping stones, while the catcher effectively mediates the charge transport between buckyballs. The properties of the buckycatcher, acting as a charge-transfer mediator from and to fullerenes, are found to be quite different for electron- and hole-transfer processes. We estimate the absolute rate of the hole and the excess electron hopping between fullerenes, kHT = 1. 28 1012 s- 1, while kEET = 1. 07 109 s- 1 and find that the HT is much faster than the EET because of (1) the stronger HT coupling between neighboring buckybowls of the catchers and (2) the smaller HT reorganization energy relative to that for EETThis work has been supported by Project No. CTQ 2005 - 04563 of the Spanish Ministerio de Educación y Ciencia (MEC...|$|E

In i), we showed that nanoscale (12 - 36 nm) CVD TiO₂ film deposited at 210 °C from our system obtains properties of conformal growth with ITO substrate, superior hole blocking ability, stoichiometric metal to oxide ratio, and close energetic alignment with electron acceptors, e. g., fullerenes. The introduction of CVD TiO₂ film as an electron transport layer (ETL) into organic solar cell significantly improves its J-V characteristics compared to bare ITO electrode. The optimum TiO₂ thickness in the OPV device applications {{was found to be}} 24 nm with a high fill factor (0. 58) and power conversion efficiency (3. 7 %) obtained. In ii), simple electrochemical methods, i. e., cyclic voltammetry, impedance spectroscopy have been used to evaluate sol-gel derived ZnO (sg-ZnO) and sputtered ZnO (sp-ZnO) porosity and pinhole density. We showed that sg-ZnO with high surface area porous structure allows the probe molecules and poly-thiophene (P 3 HT) thin layer to direct contact ITO substrate, whereas sp-ZnO with dense structural property efficiently eliminates the probe molecule diffusion and the penetration of P 3 HT layer to ITO substrate. This electrochemical property difference also directly reflects on the device shunt resistance (Rp), where we observed larger leakage current for the devices using sg-ZnO than that of devices using sp-ZnO. We envision these simple electrochemical characterizations can be applied into other similar metal oxide interlayers as well as on flexible TCO substrates, in which pinholes and physical imperfections, e. g., cracking may occur after multiple bending processes. In iii), we demonstrated low power (10. 5 watts) radio frequency (RF) O₂ and Ar plasma treatments have significant impacts on sg-ZnO near-surface chemical compositions, which in turn influence the onset potential of sg-ZnO electron injection from the underlying ITO substrate and its energetic alignment with electron acceptors, e. g., C₆₀. Using UPS, we found the presence of localized mid-gap states near the Fermi-level (Ef) of sg-ZnO, which induces the most favorable band bending and the largest vacuum level shift due to significant electron transfer from sg-ZnO to C₆₀. As a result, the resultant solar cells show the best device performance. Upon the plasma treatments, the passivation effects eliminate the mid-gap state. Therefore, we observed less degree of band bending at ZnO/C₆₀ interface and poorer device performance for the plasma treated sg-ZnO. The study demonstrates the importance of oxide/organics interface in operations of organic solar cells and provides a modification method to tune surface properties of oxide materials which can apparently be applied in other organic electronic devices, e. g., field effect transistors (FETs), organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs), etc...|$|E
