5|$|As a <b>cryogenic</b> <b>liquid,</b> liquid {{nitrogen}} {{can be dangerous}} by causing cold burns on contact, although the Leidenfrost effect provides protection for very short exposure (about one second). Ingestion of {{liquid nitrogen}} can cause severe internal damage. For example, in 2012, {{a young woman in}} England had to have her stomach removed after ingesting a cocktail made with liquid nitrogen.|$|E
25|$|Some {{additional}} precautions {{are necessary}} where ethane is stored as a <b>cryogenic</b> <b>liquid.</b> Direct contact with liquid ethane {{can result in}} severe frostbite. Until they warm to room temperature, the vapors from liquid ethane are heavier than air and can flow along the floor or ground, gathering in low places; if the vapors encounter an ignition source, the chemical reaction can flash back {{to the source of}} ethane from which they evaporated.|$|E
50|$|As {{described}} in the Physics of magnetic resonance imaging article, many MRI scanners rely on <b>cryogenic</b> <b>liquids</b> to enable the superconducting capabilities of the electromagnetic coils within.

More recently, closed-cycle cryocoolers, e.g., pulse tube refrigerators have gained considerable popularity as they eliminate <b>cryogenic</b> <b>liquids</b> which are both costly and require periodic refilling. Cryogenic cooling is also an advantage since it reduces the working environment's thermal noise.|$|R

25|$|On September 27, 1993 the {{cryogenic}} cooling {{system of the}} Tevatron Accelerator was named an International Historic Landmark by the American Society of Mechanical Engineers. The system, which provides <b>cryogenic</b> <b>liquid</b> helium to the Tevatron's superconducting magnets, was the largest low-temperature system in existence upon its completion in 1978. It keeps the coils of the magnets, which bend and focus the particle beam, in a superconducting state so that they consume only ⅓ of the power they would require at normal temperatures.|$|E
25|$|The {{device was}} called SHRIMP {{and had the}} same basic {{configuration}} (radiation implosion) as the Ivy Mike wet device, except with {{a different type of}} fusion fuel. SHRIMP used lithium deuteride (LiD), which is solid at room temperature; Ivy Mike used <b>cryogenic</b> <b>liquid</b> deuterium (D2), which required elaborate cooling equipment. Castle Bravo was the first test by the United States of a practical deliverable fusion bomb (hydrogen bomb), even though the TX-21 as proof-tested in the Bravo event was not weaponized. The successful test rendered obsolete the cryogenic design used by Ivy Mike and its weaponized derivative, the JUGHEAD, which was slated to be tested as the initial Castle Yankee. It also used a 7075 aluminium 9.5cm thick ballistic case. Aluminium was used to drastically reduce the bomb's weight and simultaneously to provide sufficient radiation confinement time and to raise yield, a departure from the heavy stainless steel casing (304L or MIM 316L) employed by contemporary weapon-projects.|$|E

Although the RS-25 can trace its heritage back to the 1960s, concerted development of the engine began in the 1970s, with the first flight, STS-1, occurring on April 12, 1981. The RS-25 has undergone several upgrades over its operational history to improve the engine's reliability, safety, and maintenance load.|$|E

500|$|Oxygen storage {{methods include}} high {{pressure}} oxygen tanks, cryogenics and chemical compounds. For reasons of economy, oxygen is often transported in bulk as a liquid in specially insulated tankers, since one liter of liquefied oxygen {{is equivalent to}} 840liters of gaseous oxygen at atmospheric pressure and [...] Such tankers are used to refill bulk liquid oxygen storage containers, which stand outside hospitals and other institutions that need large volumes of pure oxygen gas. Liquid oxygen is passed through heat exchangers, which convert the <b>cryogenic</b> <b>liquid</b> into gas before it enters the building. Oxygen is also stored and shipped in smaller cylinders containing the compressed gas; a form that is useful in certain portable medical applications and oxy-fuel welding and cutting.|$|E
500|$|The A-4 {{ballistic}} missile (referred {{to as the}} V-2 from September 1944) {{was developed by the}} Germans between 1939 and 1944. It was regarded by Adolf Hitler as a Wunderwaffe (wonder weapon) that he believed to be capable of turning the tide of the war. Its operational deployment was restricted by several factors. Large supplies of <b>cryogenic</b> <b>liquid</b> oxygen (LOX) were required as the oxidizer to fuel the missiles. LOX evaporates rapidly, necessitating a source reasonably close to the firing site in order to minimise loss through evaporation. Germany and the occupied countries did not at that time have sufficient manufacturing capacity for the amount of LOX required for a full-scale A-4 campaign; the total production capacity in 1941 and 1942 was about 215 tons daily, but each A-4 launch required about 15 tons.|$|E
500|$|The {{successful}} test of {{an atomic}} bomb represented an extraordinary scientific and technological achievement. Britain became the world's third nuclear power, reaffirming {{its status as a}} great power, although not a superpower, but hopes that the United States would be sufficiently impressed to restore the Special Relationship were soon dashed. On 1 November 1952, the United States conducted Ivy Mike, the first successful test of a true thermonuclear device (also known as a hydrogen bomb). Due to its physical size and use of <b>cryogenic</b> <b>liquid</b> deuterium, it was not suitable for use as a deliverable weapon, but the Castle Bravo test on 1 March 1954 used a much smaller device with solid lithium deuteride. Due to overlooking the nuclear fusion reaction in lithium-7, the [...] yield was more than twice what had been expected, and indeed was the largest detonation the Americans would ever carry out. This resulted in widespread radioactive fallout that affected 28 Americans, 236 Marshall Islanders, and the 23 crewmen of a Japanese fishing boat, the Daigo Fukuryū Maru (Lucky Dragon No. 5). Meanwhile, the Soviet Union tested Joe 4, a boosted fission weapon with a yield of [...] on 12 August 1953. This was followed by Joe 19, a true two-stage thermonuclear weapon on 20 November 1954.|$|E

2500|$|The 62-ton Ivy Mike device {{built by}} the United States and {{exploded}} on 1 November 1952, was the first fully successful [...] "hydrogen bomb" [...] or thermonuclear bomb. In this context, {{it was the first}} bomb in which most of the energy released came from nuclear reaction stages that followed the primary nuclear fission stage of the atomic bomb. The Ivy Mike bomb was a factory-like building, rather than a deliverable weapon. At its center, a very large cylindrical, insulated vacuum flask or cryostat, held <b>cryogenic</b> <b>liquid</b> deuterium in a volume of about 1000 liters (160 kilograms in mass, if this volume had been completely filled).
