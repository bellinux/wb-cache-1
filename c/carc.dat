500|$|In 1985, recent Salvadoran {{immigrants}} {{opened the}} Central American Refugee Center (CARECEN) to provide legal services for central American immigrants. Between 1988 and 1992 CARECEN {{cooperated with the}} Central American Refugee Committee (<b>CARC)</b> to publicize and advocate {{issues related to the}} Salvadoran Civil War and the immigration of Salvadorans to the United States. In 1988, various religious representatives created the Gulfton Area Religious Council (GARC) open for any Christian church to join. GARC advocated assistance for Gulfton residents and established focused programs. Taafe and Fisher suggest that GARC focused on relieving the symptoms of poverty instead of removing its causes. Representative Goodner, described as [...] "conservative" [...] by Fisher and Taafe, organized a March 3, 1989, town hall meeting which sparked the creation of an organization called the Gulfton Area Action Council (GAAC). The GAAC was made up of business owners who advocated the reduction of recreational drug use, local crime, and the improvement of the neighborhood, in an effort to restore property values.|$|E

The truck also can be equipped with weapon supports in the cab, cargo tie down hooks, folding troop seats, pioneer tools, winches, and other military accessories.

40|$|The AutoCad TO Gifts Translator program, ACTOG, was {{developed}} to facilitate quick generation of small finite element models using the CASA/Gifts finite element modeling program. ACTOG reads the geometric data of a drawing from the Data Exchange File (DXF) used in AutoCAD and other PC based drafting programs. The geometric entities recognized by ACTOG include POINTs, LINEs, ARCs, SOLIDs, 3 DLINEs and 3 DFACEs. From this information ACTOG creates a GIFTS SRC file which can then be read into the GIFTS preprocessor BULKM or can be modified and read into EDITM to create a finite element model. The GIFTS commands created include KPOINTs, SLINEs, <b>CARCs,</b> GRID 3 s and GRID 4 s. The SRC file {{can be used as}} is (using the default parameters) or edited for any number of uses. It is assumed that the user has at least a working knowledge of AutoCAD and GIFTS. ACTOG was written in Microsoft QuickBasic (Version 2. 0). The program {{was developed}} for the IBM PC and has been implemented on an IBM PC compatible under DOS 3. 21. ACTOG was developed in 1988...|$|R

50|$|Moto Guzzi has {{introduced}} {{a variant of the}} system, it named the Compact Reactive Drive Shaft system (patented and named <b>Ca.R.C.).</b> The main difference is that the driveshaft is free to float into its structure, providing much softer feedback from transmission. Additionally, the upper arm of the <b>Ca.R.C.</b> {{is not part of the}} structure but just a guide to close the geometry of the suspension (it means that, unlike the BMW version, the suspension will work also with a broken upper arm).|$|E

50|$|Motorcycles with {{shaft drive}} {{are subject to}} shaft effect where the chassis climbs when power is applied. This effect, which is the {{opposite}} of that exhibited by chain-drive motorcycles, is counteracted with systems such as BMW's Paralever, Moto Guzzi's <b>CARC</b> and Kawasaki's Tetra Lever.|$|E
