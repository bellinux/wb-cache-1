25|$|Following his judgment, Richard Mawrey ordered Lutfur Rahman {{to pay the}} petitioners' {{costs to}} be {{assessed}} on the standard basis if not agreed between the parties. An order for an interim payment of £250,000 to be paid within 14 days was also made pending agreement or assessment of costs, estimated at £500,000. Rahman was also ordered to pay the costs of John Williams, the Director of Public Prosecutions, the Metropolitan Police, and expenses incurred in the hosting of the election court. As {{a result of the}} cost order, Andy Erlam obtained interim charging orders on two investment properties registered solely in Rahman's name as security for the judgment debt. Rahman's wife Ayesha Farid filed objection to the charging orders claiming absolute beneficial interest on one of the two property, and 74% beneficial interest in the other. Despite the objection, Erlam was able to obtain a final <b>charging</b> <b>order</b> on the second property on 29 June 2015. Additionally, an interim <b>charging</b> <b>order</b> was then secured against a property registered solely in Farid's name on the argument that Rahman has a beneficial interest in it.|$|E
25|$|A hearing into Ayesha Farid's claim {{originally}} set for 30 September 2015 was {{rescheduled to}} 1–3 December.

As a result, proceedings in respect to the two properties without a final <b>charging</b> <b>order</b> was stayed pursuant to section 285 of the Insolvency Act 1986. Determination on Farid's claim of 74% beneficial interest on the remaining property continued at the court's discretion. The property was purchased in 2005 with a mortgage in Rahman's name, and all rental payments income and mortgage payments outgoing were handled by Rahman. As part of her evidence, Farid produced a declaration of trust dated May 2006 in support of her claim.|$|E
40|$|We {{study the}} {{extended}} Hubbard model away from half-filling on a two-dimensional square lattice using cluster dynamical mean field theory on clusters of size $ 8 $.

An analysis of the energetics of the <b>charge</b> <b>order</b> transition shows that the <b>charge</b> <b>ordering</b> transition mainly results in a rearrangement of local and non-local potential energy.

40|$|In this paper, we {{show that}} the theory of high T_c {{superconductivity}} based on a microscopic model with d-density wave (DDW) scenario in the pseudogap phase is able to reproduce {{some of the most}} important features of the recent experimentally discovered hidden <b>charge</b> <b>order</b> in several families of Cuprates. In particular, by computing and comparing energies of <b>charge</b> <b>orders</b> of different modulation directions derived from a full microscopic theory with d-density wave scenario, the axial <b>charge</b> <b>order</b> ϕ_X(Y) with wavevector Q=(Q_ 0, 0) ((0,Q_ 0)) is shown to be unambiguously energetically more favorable over the diagonal <b>charge</b> <b>order</b> ϕ_X± Y with wavevector Q=(Q_ 0,± Q_ 0) at least in commensurate limit, to be expected also to hold even to more general incommensurate case, in agreement with experiment. The two types of axial <b>charge</b> <b>order</b> ϕ_X and ϕ_Y are degenerate by symmetry. We find that within the superconducting background, biaxial (checkerboard) <b>charge</b> <b>order</b> is energetically more favorable than uniaxial (stripe) <b>charge</b> <b>order,</b> and therefore checkerboard axial <b>charge</b> <b>order</b> should be the one observed in experiments, assuming a single domain of <b>charge</b> <b>ordered</b> state on each CuO_ 2 plane.

40|$|Abstract. <b>Charge</b> <b>ordering</b> in {{strongly}} correlated 1 / 4 -filled systems, such as {{charge transfer}} organic conductors and transition metal oxides, is discussed from a theoretical point of view. Strong electron-electron Coulomb interaction especially that between neighboring molecules induces Wigner crystal-type <b>charge</b> <b>order,</b> which competes with another insulating state due to strong correlation in these systems, i. e., the dimer Mott insulating state. Based on such idea, new {{aspects of the}} <b>charge</b> <b>ordering</b> phenomenon are pointed out, where full quantum mechanical treatments are required. One case is the interplay between electron-phonon interaction leading to a novel co-existence of <b>charge</b> <b>order</b> and spin-Peierls lattice distortion, {{and the other is}} the effect of geometrical frustration resulting in a quantum melting of the <b>charge</b> <b>order.</b> Key words. <b>charge</b> <b>order,</b> strongly correlated electron system, electron-phonon interaction, geometrical frustration...|$|R

50|$|Given the {{historical}} framework of charging orders, {{it may be}} argued that their protection should not extend to single member LLCs (there are no other “partners” to protect from the creditor). However, neither the uniform acts nor any of the state <b>charging</b> <b>order</b> statutes make any distinction between single-member and multi-member LLCs. Some courts have held that the <b>charging</b> <b>order</b> protection would apply in a case where all of the partners of a limited partnership were the debtors of a single creditor.

40|$|Unconventional superconductors are {{characterized}} by various competing ordering phenomena in the normal state, such as antiferromagnetism, <b>charge</b> <b>order,</b> orbital order or nematicity.

In contrast, <b>charge</b> <b>order</b> {{is believed to be}} subdominant and compete with superconductivity. Here, we argue that fluctuating <b>charge</b> <b>order</b> in the (0,π) direction is a feature shared by the cuprates and the Fe based superconductors alike.

40|$|The {{possibility}} of <b>charge</b> <b>order</b> is theoretically examined for the Kondo lattice model in two dimensions, {{which does not}} include bare repulsive interactions.

The <b>charge</b> <b>ordered</b> ground state is an insulator exhibiting an antiferromagnetic order at charge-poor sites, while the paramagnetic charge-ordered state at finite temperatures is metallic with pseudogap behavior.

50|$|Similar to the {{traditional}} liability shield commonly associated with limited liability entities, {{the protection of the}} <b>charging</b> <b>order</b> may be pierced by a creditor.

50|$|To {{protect the}} non-debtor {{partners}} from the creditor of the debtor-partner {{it was necessary}} to keep the creditor from seizing partnership assets (which was also in line with the developing perception of partnerships as legal entities and not simple aggregates of partners) and to keep the creditor out of partnership affairs.

The rationale behind the <b>charging</b> <b>order</b> applied initially only to general partnerships, where every partner was involved in carrying on the business of the partnership; it did not apply to corporations because of their centralized management structure.

40|$|This paper reviews <b>charge</b> <b>ordering</b> in {{the organic}} conductors, β″-(BEDT-TTF) (TCNQ), θ-(BEDT-TTF) 2 X, and α-(BEDT-TTF) 2 X. Here, BEDT-TTF and TCNQ {{represent}} bis(ethylenedithio) tetrathiafulvalene and 7, 7, 8, 8 -tetracyanoquinodimethane, respectively. These compounds, {{all of which}} have a quarter-filled band, were evaluated using infrared and Raman spectroscopy in addition to optical conductivity measurements. It was found that β″-(BEDT-TTF) (TCNQ) changes continuously from a uniform metal to a charge-ordered metal with increasing temperature. Although charge disproportionation was clearly observed, long-range <b>charge</b> <b>order</b> is not realized. Among six θ-type salts, four compounds with a narrow band show the metal-insulator transition. However, they maintain a large amplitude of <b>charge</b> <b>order</b> (Δρ~ 0. 6) in both metallic and insulating phases. In the X = CsZn(SCN) 4 salt with intermediate bandwidth, the amplitude of <b>charge</b> <b>order</b> is very small (Δρ < 0. 07) over the whole temperature range. However, fluctuation of <b>charge</b> <b>order</b> is indicated in the Raman spectrum and optical conductivity. No indication of the fluctuation of <b>charge</b> <b>order</b> is found in the wide band X = I 3 salt. In α-(BEDT-TTF) 2 I 3 the amplitude of <b>charge</b> <b>order</b> changes discontinuously from small amplitude at high temperature to large amplitude (Δρmax~ 0. 6) at low temperature. The long-range charge-ordered state shows ferroelectric polarization with fast optical response. The fluctuation of multiple stripes occurs in the high-temperature metallic phase. Among α-(BEDT-TTF) 2 MHg(SCN) 4 (X = NH 4, K, Rb, Tl), the fluctuation of <b>charge</b> <b>order</b> is indicated only in the X = NH 4 salt. α′-(BEDT-TTF) 2 IBr 2 shows successive phase transitions to the ferroelectric state keeping a large amplitude of <b>charge</b> <b>order</b> (Δρmax~ 0. 8) over the whole temperature range.
