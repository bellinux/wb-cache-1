2500|$|In {{countries}} that permit {{the making of}} an administration order, the floating charge had another key benefit. [...] The holder of a floating charge could appoint an administrative receiver and block {{the appointment of a}} court-appointed administrator, and thus retain control of the distribution of the assets of the company. [...] Practice became such that companies were asked to give [...] "lightweight" [...] floating charges to secured lenders which had no <b>collateral</b> <b>value</b> purely to allow the holders to block administration orders, an approach that was approved by the courts in Re Croftbell Ltd [...] BCC 781.

2500|$|This {{analysis}} assumes, however, {{that the}} collateral does not {{increase in value}} after commencement of the case. If the collateral increases in value and the debtor (rather than the estate) keeps the collateral (e.g., where the asset is exempt or is abandoned by the trustee back to the debtor), {{the amount of the}} creditor's security interest may or may not increase.

40|$|Does a country’s {{ability to}} enforce debt {{contracts}} affect {{the sensitivity of}} economic activity to <b>collateral</b> <b>values?</b> To answer this question, we introduce a novel industry-specific measure of real asset redeployability - {{the ease with which}} real assets are transfered to alternative uses - as a proxy for <b>collateral</b> liquidation <b>values.</b> Our measure exploits the heterogeneity of expenditures in new and used capital and the heterogeneity in the composition of real asset holdings across U. S. industries. Using a cross-industry cross-country approach, we find that industry size and growth are more sensitive to <b>collateral</b> <b>values</b> in countries with weaker debt enforcement. Our estimates indicate that the differential effect is sizeable. The sensitivity of economic activity to <b>collateral</b> <b>values</b> is not affected by a country’s financial development once the quality of debt enforcement is accounted for. We then rationalize our empirical findings based on a model of credit under imperfect enforcement and discuss an important implication of our empirical result: macroeconomic volatility generated by fluctuations in <b>collateral</b> <b>values</b> is higher in countries with weaker debt enforcement institutions. ...|$|R

40|$|Banks and {{financial}} intermediaries that originate loans often sell {{some of these}} loans or securitize them in secondary loan markets and hold on to others. New issuances in such secondary markets collapse abruptly on occasion, typically when <b>collateral</b> <b>values</b> used to secure the underlying loans fall.

In this paper, we develop a dynamic adverse selection model in which small reductions in <b>collateral</b> <b>values</b> can generate abrupt inefficient collapses in new issuances in the secondary loan market. In our model, reductions in <b>collateral</b> <b>values</b> worsen the adverse selection problem and induce some potential sellers to hold on to their loans. Reputational incentives induce a large fraction of potential sellers to hold on to their loans rather than sell them in the secondary market.

5000|$|The {{most basic}} form of credit {{rationing}} occurs if the borrower cannot provide sufficient collateral. Collateral {{is important because}} repayment promises are not credible per se.

50|$|Theoretically, LGD is {{calculated}} in different ways, {{but the most}} popular is 'Gross' LGD, where total losses are divided by exposure at default (EAD). Another method is to divide Losses by the unsecured portion of a credit line (where security covers a portion of EAD). This is known as 'Blanco' LGD.

50|$|As {{a result}} of this agreement, a pre-tax charge of $45 million was {{recorded}} in the quarter ending June 30, 2011.

50|$|Consequently, {{this had}} an adverse impact on whole Japanese asset bubble. Firstly, cheap and easily {{available}} loans reduced the funding {{costs for the}} purpose of speculation. Second, stock rises, coupled by low interests rates, reduced the capital costs and aided financing the capital market (e.g. convertible bonds, bonds with warrants, etc.). Third, the combination of a rise in land and stock prices pushed up the value of assets held by corporations, which effectively increased their sources of funding since such these increased the <b>collateral</b> <b>value</b> of the assets.|$|E

30|$|Based on {{a unique}} data set of 909 {{defaulted}} customers in Germany, whose loans were originally made by 123 different banks, our {{study shows that}} the collateralization of a loan is the major driver of the recovery rate for retail and commercial customers in Germany; this confirms earlier research on recovery rates. We also find that an amicable agreement between the debtor and the bank (redemption) has a significant positive influence on the recovery rate. Furthermore, we find systematic biases between the realized and the expected <b>values</b> of <b>collateral</b> in real estate, even though the appraisal reports should have already considered all factors influencing this value. Adjusting the collateralization values for these recognized systematic biases significantly improves the explanatory power of our model for recovery rates. We compare our model to models applying flat haircuts to the <b>collateral</b> <b>values,</b> a fairly common practice in the banking industry. Our study demonstrates that <b>collateral</b> <b>values</b> {{should not be taken}} as given. In particular, systematic biases may influence estimated LGDs, and should be corrected by appropriate adjustments. While the results may hold for a greater universe, they are particularly relevant for savings banks and cooperative banks because of the focus of these banks on the customer segment analyzed here.|$|R

30|$|An {{interesting}} {{feature of}} the dynamics of large capital inflows is that during the run-up they push upwards estimates of potential GDP growth, which typically don’t consider external imbalances as an input for their computation. This is important as the speculative cycle increases the <b>collateral</b> <b>values</b> of the securities backing up the claims issued by the banking system, which in turn fuels additional inflows, reinforcing the cycle. It follows that estimates of potential GDP should take into account external imbalances because these contain information regarding the sustainability of the expansion.|$|R

50|$|Gross LGD is {{most popular}} amongst {{academics}} {{because of its}} simplicity and because academics only have access to bond market data, where <b>collateral</b> <b>values</b> often are unknown, uncalculated or irrelevant. Blanco LGD is popular amongst some practitioners (banks) because banks often have many secured facilities, and banks would like to decompose their losses between losses on unsecured portions and losses on secured portions due to depreciation of collateral quality. The latter calculation is also a subtle requirement of Basel II, but most banks are not sophisticated enough {{at this time to}} make those types of calculations.|$|R
50|$|Such {{a problem}} of {{excessive}} borrowing rooted on the pecuniary externality and market incompleteness can be much more severe when some financial amplification mechanism is present: For example, some negative shocks on the aggregate demand {{could lead to the}} real depreciation and the fall of domestic asset prices, which brings about the incipient adverse balance sheet effects that decrease the firm net worth and value of collateral. Consequently, the shrink of <b>collateral</b> <b>value</b> further constrains the private agents’ accesses to external borrowing through the binding borrowing constraint, which in turn results in the economy-wise spending cut and initial aggregate demand contraction is thus amplified. As shown in the graph depicting such a loop of effects, it is even striking that adverse shock on any step of this feedback loop could trigger this amplification of initial negative effects. Hence the overly large inflow of capital would potentially create a systemic risk and activate the amplification mechanism, which ultimately would generate large business cycle volatility, sudden collapse of the financial system and the economic recessions only given such a small incipient adverse shock on the feedback loop.|$|E

Second, default intensity and <b>collateral</b> <b>value</b> are negatively correlated. Third, the default intensity and <b>collateral</b> <b>value</b> are non-negative. To develop {{an explicit}} solution, we propose a square-root process for default intensity and an affine diffusion process for <b>collateral</b> <b>value.</b> Given these settings, we derive an explicit solution for the integrand of the expected recovery value within an extended affine model.
