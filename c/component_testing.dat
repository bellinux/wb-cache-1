5|$|Following the Austrian Grand Prix on 16 July, {{the teams}} {{conducted}} testing sessions at three circuits from 18–21 July {{to prepare for}} the Grand Prix. McLaren, Benetton, Jordan, Jaguar, Sauber and BAR went to Silverstone over three days. Olivier Panis, McLaren's test driver, set the fastest time {{on the first day of}} testing. Jaguar test driver Luciano Burti crashed at Stowe corner where his car's suspension, front and rear wings, and sidepod were damaged. The resulting incident caused a brief halt to testing and Jaguar shipped a spare car for the next day's testing. Panis remained fastest on the second day. Trulli damaged his suspension and rear wing, resulting in repairs which limited his team's testing time. Burti suffered another incident when he lost his right rear wheel. Fisichella topped the third and final day's running. Ferrari test driver Luca Badoer spent four days at the Fiorano Circuit where he concentrated on testing engine and aerodynamic development whilst Michael Schumacher did practice starts and <b>component</b> <b>testing</b> on the fourth day.|$|E

500|$|In {{terms of}} regular nuclear testing, Kittens {{represents}} bomb <b>component</b> <b>testing,</b> while Tims and Rats were early subcritical hydronuclear tests. [...] Vixen is [...] "safety testing" [...] of a bomb; assuring {{that the core}} would not accidentally undergo criticality {{in the event of}} a fire or unintended crash. These are always messy (see the US equivalent at Plutonium Valley in Project 56), for a successful test subjects the core fuel to high explosives in the hope that it simply scatters rather than undergoes criticality. The differences in the sort of dangers presented by major vs the minor tests is that there was no critical explosion in the minor tests. [...] In the major tests, the bomb cores reached critical mass; the plutonium or uranium fissile materials [...] "burned" [...] into highly radioactive fission products, and those, along with the unspent fuel and activated bomb case, tower and soil if the explosion was close to the ground, are lofted into the stratosphere to be dropped eventually as fallout globally. In Vixen, an equivalent amount of plutonium fuel was simply smashed by explosives and spread about much more locally. [...] In Kittens, Tims and Rats, smaller amounts of various materials were similar exploded locally and spread about.|$|E
2500|$|The {{basis of}} {{packaging}} design and performance is the component materials. [...] The physical properties, and sometimes chemical properties, {{of the materials}} need to be communicated to packaging engineers {{to aid in the}} design process. [...] Suppliers publish data sheets and other technical communications that include the typical or average relevant physical properties and the test method these are based upon. [...] Sometimes these are adequate. [...] Other times, additional material and <b>component</b> <b>testing</b> is required by the packager or supplier to better define certain characteristics.|$|E
2500|$|To {{make the}} vehicle ready for production, prototypes were {{subjected}} to extensive testing. According to Land Rover South Africa, [...] "The development of the Defender 2.8 i engine included high speed testing, off roading, wading, high impact durability, trailer towing, hot and cold climate testing, high altitude and sea level tests as well as intensive <b>component</b> <b>testing,</b> both in South Africa and in the United Kingdom. No less than six vehicles underwent more than 500 000 kms [...] of on and off road testing.” The new BMW M52 Defender performed better than the V8 Defender it replaced in nearly every test.|$|E
40|$|A {{sequential}} <b>component</b> <b>test</b> {{procedure is}} proposed. It {{is assumed that}} there is some knowledge of the initial failure rate parameter of each component. This knowledge is modified by the results of the first one or two <b>tests.</b> The remaining <b>component</b> <b>test</b> time is allocated adaptively (sequentially) to the components so as to maximize the system MTBF. In other words, the components will compete among themselves for limited test resources...|$|R

5000|$|Testing and Test Control Notation (TTCN), both TTCN-2 and TTCN-3, follows actor model rather closely. In TTCN, Actor {{is a test}} component: either {{parallel}} <b>test</b> <b>component</b> (PTC) or main <b>test</b> <b>component</b> (MTC). Test components {{can send}} and receive messages to and from remote partners (peer <b>test</b> <b>components</b> or <b>test</b> system interface), the latter being identified by its address. Each <b>test</b> <b>component</b> has a behaviour tree bound to it; <b>test</b> <b>components</b> run in parallel and can be dynamically created by parent <b>test</b> <b>components.</b> Built-in language constructs allow the definition of {{actions to be taken}} when an expected message is received from the internal message queue, like sending a message to another peer entity or creating new <b>test</b> <b>components.</b>|$|R
2500|$|The C-5 would undergo <b>component</b> <b>testing</b> {{even before}} the first model was constructed. The S-IVB third stage would {{be used as the}} second stage for the C-IB, which would serve both to {{demonstrate}} proof of concept and feasibility for the C-5, but would also provide flight data critical to development of the C-5. Rather than undergoing testing for each major component, the C-5 would be tested in an [...] "all-up" [...] fashion, meaning that the first test flight of the rocket would include complete versions of all three stages. By testing all components at once, far fewer test flights would be required before a manned launch.|$|E

40|$|In {{a program}} to {{investigate}} combustor noise, measurements were made with a YF- 102 engine of combustor internal fluctuating pressure and far field noise. The relationship of far field noise to engine internal measurement was ascertained. The relationships between combustor internal measurements obtained in an engine and those obtained in a <b>component</b> <b>test</b> facility were established by using a YF- 102 combustor, instrumented identically with that used in the engine tests. The combustor was operated in a <b>component</b> <b>test</b> facility over a range of conditions encompassing engine operation. A comparison of the directly measured spectra at corresponding locations in the two tests showed significant differences. The results of two point signal analyses within each combustor, were similar for both tests, indicating that the internal dynamics of the combustor as an acoustic source are preserved in a <b>component</b> <b>test</b> facility...|$|R
