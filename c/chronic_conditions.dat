5|$|Limiting the {{availability}} of paracetamol tablets has been attempted in some countries. In the UK, sales of over-the-counter paracetamol are restricted to packs of 32 x 500mg tablets in pharmacies, and 16 x 500mg tablets in non-pharmacy outlets. Pharmacists may provide up to 100 tablets for those with <b>chronic</b> <b>conditions</b> at the pharmacist's discretion. In Ireland, the limits are 24 and 12 tablets, respectively. Subsequent study suggests that the reduced availability in large numbers {{had a significant effect}} in reducing poisoning deaths from paracetamol overdose.|$|E
5|$|When {{suffering}} from sleep deprivation, active immunizations {{may have a}} diminished effect and may result in lower antibody production, and a lower immune response, than would be noted in a well-rested individual. Additionally, proteins such as NFIL3, which {{have been shown to}} be closely intertwined with both T-cell differentiation and our circadian rhythms, can be affected through the disturbance of natural light and dark cycles through instances of sleep deprivation, shift work, etc. As a result, these disruptions can lead to an increase in <b>chronic</b> <b>conditions</b> such as heart disease, chronic pain, and asthma.|$|E
5|$|A 2016 study led by Harvard University health {{economics}} professor Benjamin Sommers found that residents of Kentucky and Arkansas, which both accepted the Medicaid expansion, {{were more likely}} to receive health care services and less likely to incur emergency room costs or have trouble paying their medical bills than before the expansion. Residents of Texas, which did not accept the Medicaid expansion, did not see a similar improvement during the same period. Kentucky opted for increased managed care, while Arkansas subsidized private insurance. The new Arkansas and Kentucky governors have proposed reducing or modifying their programs. Between 2013 and 2015, the uninsured rate dropped from 42% to 14% in Arkansas and from 40% to 9% in Kentucky, compared with 39% to 32% in Texas. Specific improvements included additional primary and preventive care, fewer emergency departments visits, reported higher quality care, improved health, improved drug affordability, reduced out-of-pocket spending and increased outpatient visits, increased diabetes screening, glucose testing among diabetes patients and regular care for <b>chronic</b> <b>conditions.</b>|$|E

30|$|To {{better fit}} into the current online world and to {{overcome}} logistic barriers, the Op Koers program was further developed into online Op Koers group courses.

Peer support is suggested to {{have a positive effect on}} attitudes, beliefs and perceptions [21]. The first online Op Koers group course was developed for childhood cancer survivors (CCS) [15]. After establishing preliminary feasibility for CCS, the module was adapted for adolescents with a <b>chronic</b> <b>condition</b> (ages 12 – 18) and parents of children with a <b>chronic</b> <b>condition</b> (ages 0 – 18) [3]. In these online courses, participants log on to a chat box at a set time for eight weekly sessions led by two psychologists. Participants are taught coping skills and share experiences with each other about themes that are related to themselves or their child having a <b>chronic</b> <b>condition.</b>|$|R

The cohort's sample size was 8, 984 and participants were followed up through 2009. <b>Chronic</b> health <b>conditions</b> were defined by the 1997 parent questionnaire and the 2002 youth questionnaire. Educational attainment was defined by completion of high school by 21 years of age. Academic, psychosocial, neighborhood and school factors were examined and potential mediators and effect modifiers were identified. RESULTS: The odds of poor educational attainment for youth who reported ever having a <b>chronic</b> health <b>condition</b> were significantly higher compared to youth who never reported a <b>chronic</b> health <b>conditions,</b> OR: 1. 47 (95 % CI: 1. 22 - 1. 76). Specifically youth with cancer, diabetes or epilepsy had the highest odds of poor educational attainment, OR: 1. 96 (95 % CI: 1. 13 - 3. 37). There were similar associations for youth limited by a <b>chronic</b> health <b>condition,</b> OR: 1. 76 (95 % CI: 1. 33 - 2. 34) and for youth with early onset of a condition, OR: 1. 61 (95 % CI: 1. 29 - 1. 99). Academic and psychosocial variables attenuated these associations and mediators were present. Interactions with school-level factors and <b>chronic</b> health <b>conditions</b> were also found. CONCLUSIONS: Youth with <b>chronic</b> health <b>conditions,</b> specifically those with cancer, diabetes or epilepsy, youth limited by or have early onset of a <b>chronic</b> health <b>condition</b> are at particular risk of poor educational attainment.

In this study, we investigated the association between mental health disorders and <b>chronic</b> physical <b>conditions</b> among children, and we assessed whether having mental disorders is associated with increased health care costs for children with <b>chronic</b> physical <b>conditions,</b> using Medical Expenditure Panel Survey data from 2008 through 2013. MethodsChildren aged 5 to 17 with at least 1 <b>chronic</b> physical <b>condition</b> {{were included in the}} study. <b>Chronic</b> physical <b>conditions</b> and mental disorders were identified using International Classification of Diseases, 9 th Revision, Clinical Modification codes.
