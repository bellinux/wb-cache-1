40|$|We have {{performed}} a systematic molecular dynamics {{study of the}} competition between crack growth and dislocation emission from a crack tip. Two types of boundary conditions are adopted: either planar extension or boundary displacements according to the anisotropic mode-I asymptotic continuum solution. The effects of temperature, loading rate, crystal orientation, sharpness of the crack tip, atomic potential, and system size are investigated. Depending on the crystal orientation, dislocation nucleation can be driven either by the strain or by <b>concerted</b> <b>fluctuations</b> at the crack tip. In the latter case, crystal orientation and temperature have the largest influence {{on the process of}} dislocation nucleation. ...|$|E
40|$|Application of the 'essential dynamics' {{method to}} the NMR cluster of {{structures}} for the R 2 R 3 DNA-binding {{domain of the}} mouse c-Myb transcriptional activator is described. Using this method, large <b>concerted</b> <b>fluctuations</b> of atoms are extracted showing a hinge-bending motion between the two (R 2 and R 3) Myb repeats {{on the basis of}} NMR data alone. Molecular dynamics simulation of the same protein allowed quantitative comparison of the large concerted motions calculated from experimental and theoretical data, showing a significant degree of similarity. Detailed inspection of the motions reveals a conserved proline that {{plays a key role in}} determining hinge flexibility. The proline-to-alanine mutation at this position, which has previously been characterized biochemically, was subjected to molecular dynamics and subsequent essential dynamics analysis. The hingebending motion between the two repeats was found to be enhanced for the mutant. The approach described should have general applications, predicting the effect of mutations on protein dynamic properties of other proteins...|$|E
40|$|Seasonal {{changes in}} the {{abundance}} of exothermic organisms can be expected with climate change if warmer temperatures can induce {{changes in the}}ir phenology. Given the increased time for ectothermic organism development at lower temperatures, we asked whether population dynamics of the house mosquito, Culex pipiens s. l. (L.) (Diptera: Culicidae), in Jeju-do (South Korea), an island with a gradient of warming temperatures from north to south, showed differences in sensitivity to changes in temperature along the warming gradient. In addition, we asked whether synchrony, that is, the degree of <b>concerted</b> <b>fluctuations</b> in mosquito abundance across locations, was affected by the temperature gradient. We found the association of mosquito abundance with temperature to be delayed by 2 wk in the north {{when compared with the}} south. The abundance across all our sampling locations had a flat synchrony profile that could reflect impacts of rainfall and average temperature on the average of all our samples. Finally, our results showed that population synchrony across space can emerge even when abundance is differentially impacted by an exogenous factor across an environmental gradient...|$|E
40|$|Background. Patterns of <b>concerted</b> <b>fluctuation</b> in populations-synchrony-can reveal {{impacts of}} climatic {{variability}} on disease dynamics. We examined whether malaria transmission has been synchronous {{in an area}} with a common rainfall regime and sensitive to the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD), a global climatic phenomenon affecting weather patterns in East Africa. Methods. We studied malaria synchrony in 5 15 -year long (1984 - 1999) monthly time series that encompass an altitudinal gradient, approximately 1000 m to 2000 m, along Lake Victoria basin. We quantified the association patterns between rainfall and malaria time series at different altitudes and across the altitudinal gradient encompassed by the study locations. Results. We found a positive seasonal association of rainfall with malaria, which decreased with altitude. By contrast, IOD and interannual rainfall impacts on interannual disease cycles increased with altitude. Our analysis revealed a nondecaying synchrony of similar magnitude in both malaria and rainfall, as expected under a Moran effect, supporting a role for climatic variability on malaria epidemic frequency, which might reflect rainfall-mediated changes in mosquito abundance. Conclusions. Synchronous malaria epidemics call for the integration of knowledge on the forcing of malaria transmission by environmental variability to develop robust malaria control and elimination programs...|$|R
40|$|A {{fundamental}} goal in cellular signaling is {{to understand}} allosteric communication, {{the process by which}} signals originated at one site in a protein propagate dependably to affect remote functional sites. Here, we describe the allosteric regulation of the receptor tyrosine kinase KIT. Our analysis evidenced that communication routes established between the activation loop (A-loop) and the distant juxtamembrane region (JMR) in the native protein were disrupted by the oncogenic mutation D 816 V positioned in the A-loop. In silico mutagenesis provided a plausible way of restoring the protein communication detected in the native KIT by introducing a counter-balancing second mutation D 792 E. The communication patterns observed in the native and mutated KIT correlate perfectly with the structural and dynamical features of these proteins. Particularly, a long-distance effect of the D 816 V mutation manifested as an important structural re-organization of the JMR in the oncogenic mutant was completely vanished in the double mutant D 816 V/D 792 E. This detailed characterization of the allosteric communication in the different forms of KIT, native and mutants, was performed by using a modular network representation composed of communication pathways and independent dynamic segments. Such representation permits to enrich a purely mechanistic interaction-based model of protein communication by the introduction of <b>concerted</b> local atomic <b>fluctuations.</b> This method, validated on KIT receptor, may guide a rational modulation of the physiopathological activities of other receptor tyrosine kinases...|$|R
40|$|International audience; Multiple quantum {{relaxation}} in proteins reveals unexpected {{relationships between}} correlated or anti-correlated conformational backbone dynamics in alpha-helices or beta-sheets. The contributions of conformational exchange to the relaxation rates of C'N coherences (i. e., double- and zero-quantum coherences involving backbone carbonyl (13) C' and neighboring amide (15) N nuclei) {{depend on the}} kinetics of slow exchange processes, {{as well as on}} the populations of the conformations and chemical shift differences of (13) C' and (15) N nuclei. The relaxation rates of C'N coherences, which reflect <b>concerted</b> <b>fluctuations</b> due to slow chemical shift modulations (CSMs), were determined by direct (13) C detection in diamagnetic and paramagnetic proteins. In well-folded proteins such as lanthanide-substituted calbindin (CaLnCb), copper,zinc superoxide dismutase (Cu,Zn SOD), and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP 12), slow conformational exchange occurs along the entire backbone. Our observations demonstrate that relaxation rates of C'N coherences arising from slow backbone dynamics have positive signs (characteristic of correlated fluctuations) in beta-sheets and negative signs (characteristic of anti-correlated fluctuations) in alpha-helices. This extends the prospects of structure-dynamics relationships to slow time scales that are relevant for protein function and enzymatic activity...|$|E

40|$|G protein-coupled receptors are a {{large family}} of {{membrane}} proteins activated {{by a variety of}} structurally diverse ligands making them highly adaptable signaling molecules. Despite recent advances in the structural biology of this protein family, the mechanism by which ligands induce allosteric changes in protein structure and dynamics for its signaling function remains a mystery. Here, we propose the use of terahertz spectroscopy combined with molecular dynamics simulation and protein evolutionary network modeling to address the mechanism of activation by directly probing the <b>concerted</b> <b>fluctuations</b> of retinal ligand and transmembrane helices in rhodopsin. This approach allows us to examine the role of conformational heterogeneity in the selection and stabilization of specific signaling pathways in the photo-activation of the receptor. We demonstrate that ligand-induced shifts in the conformational equilibrium prompt vibrational resonances in the protein structure that link the dynamics of conserved interactions with fluctuations of the active-state ligand. The connection of vibrational modes creates an allosteric association of coupled fluctuations that forms a coherent signaling pathway from the receptor ligand-binding pocket to the G-protein activation region. Our evolutionary analysis of rhodopsin-like GPCRs suggest that specific allosteric sites play a pivotal role in activating structural fluctuations that allosterically modulate functional signals...|$|E
40|$|Nuclear spin {{relaxation}} is {{a powerful}} method for studying molecular dynamics at atomic resolution. Recent methods development in biomolecular NMR spectroscopy has enabled detailed investigations of molecular dynamics that are critical for biological function, with prominent examples addressing allostery, enzyme catalysis, and protein folding. Dynamic processes with similar correlation times are often detected in multiple locations of the molecule, raising {{the question of whether}} the underlying motions are correlated (corresponding to <b>concerted</b> <b>fluctuations</b> involving many atoms distributed across extended regions of the molecule) or uncorrelated (corresponding to independent fluctuations involving few atoms in localized regions). Here, we have used 13 Cα(i - 1) / 13 Cα(i) differential multiple-quantum spin relaxation to provide direct evidence for correlated dynamics of consecutive amino acid residues in the protein sequence. By monitoring overlapping pairs of residues (i - 1 and i, i and i + 1, etc.), we identified correlated motions that extend through continuous segments of the sequence. We detected significant correlated conformational transitions in the native state of the E 140 Q mutant of the calmodulin C-terminal domain. Previous work has shown that this domain exchanges between two major conformational states that resemble the functionally relevant open and closed states of the WT protein, with a mean correlation time of ≈ 20 μs. The present results reveal that an entire α-helix undergoes partial unraveling in a transient and cooperative manner...|$|E
