40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{quantitative}} importance of different savings motives on the distributions {{of wealth and}} consumption and aggregate capital accumulation by solving an overlapping generations model with intragenerational heterogeneity. Agents differ in age, ability, earnings shocks, and inherited bequests. In the baseline economy, there are uninsurable idiosyncratic risks associated with uncertain lifetime and earnings shocks. The model is calibrated to the U. S. economy and solved numerically. Then the allocations of the baseline economy are {{compared with those of}} an economy with <b>complete</b> <b>annuity</b> markets, one without earnings uncertainty, and one without altruism. ...|$|E
40|$|A new {{empirical}} {{study of}} the relation between money, nominal income, prices, and real output in postwar quarterly U. S. data rejects virtually all of the conclusions reached by Families provide individuals with risk sharing opportunities which may not otherwise be available. Within the family there is a degree of trust and a level of information which alleviates three key problems in the provision of insurance by markets open to the general public, namely, moral hazard, adverse selection, and deception. The informational advantages of pooling risk within families must be set against the inability of families to provide complete insurance because of the small size of the risk pooling group. This paper demonstrates how families can provide insurance against uncertain dates of death. Death risk sharing family arrangements effectively constitute an incomplete annuities market. Our analysis indicates that these arrangements even in small families can substitute by more than 70 % for <b>complete</b> <b>annuities.</b> Given the adverse selection problem and transactions costs in public annuity markets, risk pooling in families may well be preferred to purchasing market annuities. In the absence of organized public markets in annuities, these risk sharing arrangements provide powerful economic incentives for marriage and family formation. The paper suggests that inter-family transfers need {{have nothing to do with}} altruistic feelings; rather, they may simply reflect risk sharing behavior of completely selfish family members. ...|$|R
50|$|In 1829, a land cession {{treaty was}} called for at Rock Island, Illinois. The {{location}} was moved {{at the last minute}} to Prairie du Chien to please the Winnebago. The Potawatomi were not notified and Senachewine and the Peoria Potawatomi refused to attend. Because of the large number of other Potawatomi in attendance, land cessions of northern Illinois and southwestern Wisconsin were made. Senachewine protested that the signers of the treaty were not those individuals who had received guarantees for the land at the 1816 treaty. Because the sub-agent supported his protests, in 1831, William Clark at St. Louis investigated the claims and found them valid. Instead of invalidating the land cessions, he ruled that the annuity would be shared with the Lake Peoria villages. Senachewine and several others attended the Chicago annuity disbursement. He was displeased with the division, but died before he could protest to the government. His son Nauntay notified the government and obtain a promise from Clark that a census of the Potawatomi would be <b>completed</b> and the <b>annuity</b> paid proportionally.|$|R
40|$|Variable annuity {{prospectuses}} contain {{too much}} information, and the Author contends that usually the reader gives up {{using them to}} make buying decisions. This Article discusses the challenge of writing effective variable annuity prospectus disclosures that will drive more informed decision-making by unidentified consumers who span a diverse range relating to financial literacy. The Article also examines how a lack of uniformity in industry jargon hampers consumer comprehension. Communication within the financial industry has gravitated toward design-based disclosure rather than solution-based disclosure, adding further confusion. By utilizing literacy studies conducted by the Office of Investor Education and Advocacy and continued collaboration between the financial industry and its regulators, the financial industry can better understand the financial literacy of its intended audience and determine how to teach consumers {{what they need to}} know. The Author contends that while other industries have identified how to empower consumers with the working knowledge needed to make informed decisions, the financial industry has not done so. Plain English disclosures will help improve suitability and drive more informed decision-making. The Author recommends improving the Form N- 4 (variable annuity registration statement). Additionally, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority find that sales agents benefit from <b>completing</b> both basic <b>annuity</b> training as well as each product issuerâ€™s training. Further, the Author proposes that the use of technology will improve consumer decision-making. This technology includes interactive text and video interspersed prospectuses on handheld devices...|$|R
