I did that and I was quite successful. I think at the end of the tour I finished about fifth in the batting averages. But that didn't seem to make any difference. I was the only one who didn't play a Test match.|$|E
500|$|Parks and Recreation co-creator Michael Schur {{conceived}} {{the idea for}} Ron Swanson's jazz musician alter ego before they learned Nick Offerman actually played the saxophone in real life, and had for his entire life. Offerman praised the decision: [...] "When he <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> said, 'You're {{going to have an}} alter ego who plays jazz saxophone,' I go, 'How do you see inside me?'" [...] After the episode broadcast, NBC created an official [...] "Duke Silver" [...] website, which included a biography, discography, reviews, gallery, tour schedule and booking information for the fictional band.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{featured}} several elaborate CGI scenes. The {{first scene}} with the vertebrae was entirely computer generated by visual effects head John Wash. Alex Krycek {{was killed by a}} CGI bullet straight through the head, which again was Manners' idea. Extra money was budgeted for Krycek's death. Mitch Pileggi was very happy when he was told he would be killing Krycek; he explained, [...] "when they <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> told me that I was the one that was going to kill Krycek, I was elated. Not because I wanted Nick to go away or anything, it was just from a character stand-point; Skinner just wanted to kill Krycek so bad." [...] Manners later called it one of his [...] "favorite scenes [...] ever directed" [...] and one of the [...] "best scenes [...] {{seen in a long time}} on television." ...|$|E

Roger Waters and David Gilmour {{were in the process}} of completing Pink Floyd's Ummagumma album when they got involved with The Madcap Laughs that July and helped Barrett finish his album − [...] "in a two-day sprint", according to Pink Floyd biographer Rick Sanders. [...] "We had very little time," [...] Gilmour recalled in a May 2003 interview. [...] "Syd was very difficult, we got that very frustrated feeling: Look, it's your fucking career, mate. Why don't you get your finger out and do something? The guy was in trouble, and was a close friend for many years before then, so it really was the least one could do." ...|$|E
500|$|The first writers {{assigned}} to the script were twins Julius and Philip Epstein who, against the wishes of Warner Brothers, left at Frank Capra's request early in 1942 {{to work on the}} Why We Fight series in Washington, D.C. While they were gone, the other credited writer, Howard Koch, was assigned; he produced thirty to forty pages. When the Epstein brothers returned after about a month, they were re{{assigned to}} Casablanca and—contrary to what Koch claimed in two published books—his work was not used. The Epstein brothers and Koch never worked in the same room at the same time during the writing of the script. Koch later commented, [...] "When we began, we didn't have a finished script... Ingrid Bergman <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> said, 'Which man should I love more...?' I said to her, 'I don't know... play them both evenly.' You see we didn't have an ending, so we didn't know what was going to happen!" [...] In the final budget for the film, the Epsteins were paid $30,416, and Koch earned $4,200.|$|E

Speaking to Nick Levine of Digital Spy, Rihanna explained: [...] "I went into the studio making music my way. I found myself all at once." [...] In an interview on This Morning, Rihanna said that the song is not necessarily about a specific personal experience, but rather the general feelings of mental anguish, anxiety and confusion. Rihanna further explained {{that she wanted to}} record the song because she felt that listeners would be able to relate to the subject matter. When Good Girl Gone Bad was repackaged, Rihanna approached L.A. Reid, boss of Def Jam, suggesting to release [...] "Disturbia" [...] as a single and follow-up to [...] "Take a Bow". Speaking to MTV News, Reid said, [...] "It was the first time Rihanna actually <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> said, 'Here's the song I want to put out.' She played me the song. That was her taking control [...] She understands what hits are, and she knows what she wants to say. She's at that place where she can do that." ...|$|E

500|$|Sale el Sol is {{considered}} to be Shakira's return to her [...] "roots" [...] and is a [...] "fusion between rock and pop heavily influenced from Latino and Colombian music". Shakira said there are three [...] "directions" [...] of Sale el Sol: a romantic one, a [...] "very rock and roll" [...] one, and a [...] "Latino, tropical" [...] one. Explaining the romantic [...] "direction" [...] of the album, she said that it was something [...] "which I hadn't tapped into for the past three years, but it suddenly <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> I couldn't hold it back. So it’s [...] got songs that are very intense, very romantic [...] ". Examples include ballads like [...] "Antes de las Seis" [...] ("Before Six O'Clock") and [...] "Lo Que Mas" [...] ("The Most"); in the former Shakira delivers [...] "sad, emotional, and heartfelt vocals," [...] while in the latter she sings over a piano and string-supplemented melody. About the rock and roll [...] "direction" [...] of the album, Shakira said [...] "I started my career as a rock artist and then I kind of crossed over into pop, so it’s been fun to re-encounter that side of my artistic personality".|$|E
500|$|When {{the album}} was reissued, Rihanna {{approached}} L.A. Reid, the head of Def Jam Recordings and suggested {{that she wanted to}} release [...] "Disturbia" [...] as the next single.

[...] It was solicited to US contemporary hit radio on June 17, 2008, and was released as a CD single in the United Kingdom on July 22, 2008. [...] "Disturbia" [...] earned Rihanna an award for Best International Song at the 2009 NRJ Music Awards. It peaked at number one in Belgium (Flanders) and New Zealand and became a top-ten hit in over twenty countries worldwide. The single topped the US Billboard Hot 100 chart for two consecutive weeks, and became Rihanna's third number one single from Good Girl Gone Bad and fourth overall on the Hot 100 chart. The music video for [...] "Disturbia" [...] was directed by Anthony Mandler and portrays Rihanna in various locations such as in a prison cell and gas chamber.|$|E
500|$|Lennon's love of wordplay and {{nonsense}} {{with a twist}} found a {{wider audience}} when he was 24. Harry writes that In His Own Write (1964) was published after [...] "Some journalist who was hanging around the Beatles <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> I ended up showing him the stuff. They said, 'Write a book' and that's how the first one came about". Like the Daily Howl it contained a mix of formats including short stories, poetry, plays and drawings. One story, [...] "Good Dog Nigel", tells the tale of [...] "a happy dog, urinating on a lamp post, barking, wagging his tail—until he suddenly hears a message {{that he will be}} killed at three o'clock". The Times Literary Supplement considered the poems and stories [...] "remarkable... also very funny... the nonsense runs on, words and images prompting one another in a chain of pure fantasy". Book Week reported, [...] "This is nonsense writing, but one has only to review the literature of nonsense to see how well Lennon has brought it off. While some of his homonyms are gratuitous word play, many others have not only double meaning but a double edge." [...] Lennon was not only surprised by the positive reception, but that the book was reviewed at all, and suggested that readers [...] "took the book more seriously than I did myself. It just began as a laugh for me".|$|E

500|$|However, {{in a more}} mixed review, Randall Roberts of the Los Angeles Times {{felt that}} the song [...] "seems {{as if it were}} written by a ninth-grader imagining her rebellious college sister’s lifestyle" [...] and felt that it lacked {{creativity}} within Cyrus' catalog. Writing for Rolling Stone, Jon Dolan was skeptical of Cyrus' increasingly provocative image, stating that the lyrics in the chorus would be [...] "an odd fit for any singer" [...] and opining that [...] "there's still a bit too much Disney in her voice to fill the track." [...] Naomi Zeichner of The Fader praised the song, writing, [...] "Cyrus said in her recent MTV doc (...) , that she chose it to be her album's first single: 'Not everyone <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> said okay, you've got the first single. I had to say no, I know this is it and I'll go to battle if I have to, against anyone who doesn't believe in it. Now I have this freedom to do whatever I want, because people trust me.' She was right about this one. The song's straightforward party is now tied to a sordid universe of visuals- the official video and the VMA performance." [...] Common Sense Media gave the song two stars out of five saying that [...] "After listening to the weird intro to [...] "We Can't Stop" [...] you'll kind of wish the song did just stop right there." ...|$|E
500|$|... "I'm Your Pusher" [...] sees Ice-T dissing fellow rapper LL Cool J. Ice-T {{explained}} {{later that}} he felt that LL Cool J was [...] "at that time on his 'I'm the great rapper in the world' thing. Me being from L.A., I was trying to rep our entire city alone, so had to step to him". Ice-T also replied {{that he had no}} personal problem with him but just [...] "thought I could beat him rapping anyways". Ice-T stated that he recorded [...] "Girls L.G.B.N.A.F." [...] as a humorous response to LL Cool J's song [...] "I Need Love". Ice-T stated that: [...] "Girls <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> asked, 'Ice, why don't you write a ballad'? Now can you imagine saying, 'I need loooove?' That's a wimp. So I wrote ('Girls') as a joke." [...] LL Cool J later retaliated [...] dissing Ice-T in his song [...] "To da Break of Dawn" [...] from his album Mama Said Knock You Out (1990). Afrika Islam said their feud ended when a group meeting involving Flavor Flav, DJ Red Alert, Mike Tyson and Afrika Bambaataa persuaded them to stop fighting. Islam explained Tyson's role: [...] " [...] down with hip-hop and the Zulus and I've always considered rappers like boxers anyway". Ice-T commented on the feud in NME magazine in 2012, stating: [...] "You need a nemesis in hip hop. It's part of what fuels good rap. L was coming out of New York saying he was the best rapper in the world. I was trying to get my feet out of LA. You can't have someone saying they're the best if you're trying to. We had a little hip hop thing but it was never serious." ...|$|E
