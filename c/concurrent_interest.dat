5000|$|A {{partition}} is a {{term used}} in the law of real property to describe an act, by a court order or otherwise, to divide up a concurrent estate into separate portions representing the proportionate interests of the owners of property. It is sometimes described as a forced sale. Under the common law, any owner of property who owns an undivided <b>concurrent</b> <b>interest</b> in land can seek such a division. In some cases, the parties agree to a specific division of the land; if {{they are unable to}} do so, the court will determine an appropriate division. A sole owner, or several owners, of a piece of land may partition their land by entering a deed poll (sometimes referred to as [...] "carving out").|$|E
5000|$|In 1907 {{he was one}} of {{the first}} civilians to descend in a submarine. Two years later he became the thirteenth man to fly solo in an airplane, and helped found the Aero Club of America. He was elected to be its first secretary, a {{position}} he held for more than 20 years. In that capacity he served as official timer for Orville Wright’s historic 57 minute flight at Fort Myer, Virginia in 1908. The following year Post worked with Alexander Graham Bell’s Aerial Experiment Association where he represented the Aero Club and primarily helped testing gliders. Post then worked with fellow AEA alumn Glenn Curtiss, developing innovations and flight testing his planes. He was present for the historic flight of the Curtiss June Bug and co-authored The Curtiss Aviation Book in 1910. [...] Post's interest in aviation included balloons as well as aircraft. While working with Curtiss he also participated in the international Gordon Bennett Balloon Races from 1906-1910. In 1910 he set a distance and duration record in a free balloon, flying as aide to Allen Hawley in the balloon [...] "America II," [...] an American record that stood for 95 years. Post hiked and went hunting with friends, studied orienteering and woodcraft and was an original member of the Society of the Sons of Daniel Boone which merged to form the The Boy Scouts of America in 1910. At that time he became close friends with the Scouts’ founder, Daniel Carter Beard, and served on the group’s National Council from its inception. Post wrote and edited many articles for the Scouts’ Boys’ Life publication throughout his lifetime. In addition to his other pursuits Post maintained a <b>concurrent</b> <b>interest</b> in the arts. He wrote numerous nonfiction articles and books, as well as books of poetry, an opera, and original songs. He performed solo and with a variety of musical groups, and in 1914 he acted in 103 performances of the original production of Omar the Tentmaker on Broadway. During World War I Post was sent by Secretary of State Robert Lansing to Britain and France to train aviators on Curtiss planes and to evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of allied and enemy aircraft. Following the war he promoted U.S. investment in aviation. He predicted the possibility of transatlantic flight in 1914. Years later he approached hotel owner Raymond Orteig and presented an idea for encouraging a transatlantic flight between Paris and New York City. Post wrote the rules and secured the $25,000 prize money for the competition that was won by Charles Lindbergh in 1927. [...] In his later life Post devoted himself to the arts. He worked as part of the National Association for Music in Hospitals, performed with the New York Symphony Chorus and served many other civic organizations. He continued to support the causes and groups he had helped establish and was a sought after professional lecturer until his death in 1952 at age 78.|$|E
40|$|This study {{examined}} the developments in children’s externalizing problems and interest in reading during their first four years of school (Grades 1 – 4) and investigated whether this development predicted the children’s Grade 6 reading skills and educational aspirations. Data comprised (1) teachers’ ratings of externalizing problems and children’s (N = 642; 43 % girls) self-ratings of their interest in reading, collected between Grades 1 and 4, and (2) measures of reading fluency and comprehension, and children’s self-reports of educational aspirations, collected at Grade 6. First, latent growth modeling showed that {{a higher level of}} externalizing problems in Grade 1 was associated with a lower <b>concurrent</b> <b>interest</b> in reading. Second, a positive association between the initial level of interest in reading and a linear change in externalizing problems indicated that children with a lower interest in reading in Grade 1 were rated by teachers as exhibiting higher levels of externalizing problems, which nonetheless declined over the course of their first four years of school more than among other children. Third, a higher initial level of externalizing problems with a linear change in these problems across Grades 1 – 4 was a predictor of lower subsequent educational aspirations and poorer reading comprehension in Grade 6. Analysis of the indirect effects indicated that a higher level of externalizing problems was associated with a lower <b>concurrent</b> <b>interest</b> in reading, which, in turn, was related to poorer future reading fluency and lower educational aspirations. The findings imply that problem behaviors are interlinked with academic skill development and motivation across the first six years of school...|$|E

Her experimental work has a musical sensibility and her work in musical theater is quite experimental.

40|$|Following its {{extensive}} Australian Music on Radio Inquiry conducted between 1982 and 1988, the Australian broadcasting regulator {{concluded that}} commercial radio had {{a responsibility to}} support the development of Australian music but its own systems for ensuring they fulfilled that responsibility were insufficient.

40|$|Summary:- Modern Land Law offers {{fresh and}} {{contemporary}} {{coverage of a}} traditionally difficult subject. Mark Thompson {{moves away from the}} typically dense, black-letter approach adopted by many textbooks to take a more engaging look at the social context within which land law operates. The book is structured to reflect the key topics that are typically covered on the LLB making it ideal for use as a main textbook and the contextual approach and selective coverage ensure that it offers in-depth and rigorous analysis and discussion. The author excels in explaining difficult rules and concepts clearly but without oversimplification and guides students around the common pitfalls in areas where there is typically misunderstanding or confusion.

40|$|Sherman, 1955) as a {{potential}} commercial source ofaluminum has stimulated <b>concurrent</b> <b>interest</b> in the plants of these latosols. The major and closely related questions that arise concern (1) the role of plant species or plant communities as indicators of alumi-num, (2) the ecological significance of plant accumulators of aluminum, and (3) the role of aluminum in plant metabolism and its re-lation to plant tolerance and toxicity. It {{is the purpose of}} this paper to discuss data on a selection of H awaiian plants with emphasis on the latter two questions. The floristics and ecology of study sites on gibbsitic soils will be considered later. REVIEW OF LITERATURE Much of the early development of infor-mation concerning aluminum in plants was stimulated by the interest in plant materials as mordants for the dye industry. Aluminum is one of the most abundant elements in the soil and is almost universally present in plants but varies widely in amount. Robinson and Edin gton.

The reader encounters such a style, prominently manifest, in the work of some of Heaney’s poetic influences, especially Eastern European poets like Czeslaw Milosz and Zbigniew Herbert. This article argues, however, that Heaney’s stylistic shift was too slight to account for the enormity of his international success and asserts instead that his far-ranging appeal is a matter of tone: Heaney’s attitude toward his material, but more so, deep characteristics of his personality – what Ted Hughes refers to as “the ultimate suffering and decision” in him –occupy space below the surface of his work and imbue it with a quality to which readers around the world are drawn...|$|R
