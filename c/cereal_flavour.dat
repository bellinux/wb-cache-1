40|$|Gluten is {{the mixture}} of {{proteins}} remaining in wheat flour after starch and water soluble components have been extracted by washing. Its unique dough forming properties are due {{to the structure of}} the proteins. A feature of the protein is the high glutamine content, about 30 % of the total amino acids. A number of studies have shown that gluten's properties of insolubility and water-binding can be substantially modified by mild acid hydrolysis. The principal effect of the mild acid treatment is to hydrolyse the amide side chain of glutamine such that the amide group is replaced by a carboxyl group. In addition, it is known that hydrolysis of peptide bonds can have a large influence on the functional properties of proteins. The aims of this study were to determine the kinetics of the acid catalysed deamidation and peptide bond hydrolysis reactions, and to comment on the resultant changes in functional properties. A statistically designed experiment was used to determine the effect of temperature, hydrogen ion concentration and gluten concentration. An initial rate analysis of the results showed that reactions could be described by equations of the form: Rate of amide bond hydrolysis = k 1. [Amide][H+] and Rate of peptide bond hydrolysis = k 2 [Peptide] [H+] where k = koe -E/R. 1 /T A stoichiometric analysis of the experimental data confirmed that hydrogen ions were consumed in both reactions. A numerical solution was developed to predict the extent of reaction with time. A computer program incorporating the solution was used to simulate the reaction and test the solution. The simulation results appeared to overestimate the progress of the reaction with time. A series of ten gluten powders, hydrolysed to different extents was prepared at small pilot scale. The composition of the samples was determined and compared with the extent of hydrolysis predicted by the reaction simulation. Reasonable agreement was achieved. A selection of the functional properties of the prepared samples was examined. The quantity of alkali required to dissolve each preparation to the extent of its solubility at pH 7. 6 increased markedly with the extent of hydrolysis due to the additional carboxyl groups requiring neutralization. The flavour of each preparation was exanined. A <b>cereal</b> <b>flavour</b> was found to decrease with the extent of hydrolysis. A lingering bitter flavour was found to increase with the extent of hydrolysis. The solubility of all preparations at p H 7. 6 in 0. 1 M phosphate buffer increased with the extent of treatment so that the most hydrolysed samples were almost completely soluble. No (significant) difference was found between freeze dried and spray dried samples. Samples prepared without dialysis showed no solubility difference from those prepared with dialysis at a similar extent of hydrolysis. The hydrophobicity of the preparations was measured using two different fluorescent probes and was found to increase with the extent of hydrolysis. The emulsion-forming properties of the preparations were found to depend on the oil used in the test, as would be expected if hydrophobicity was equivalent to the hydrophile lipophile balance, which is commonly used to classify emulsifying agents. The preparations did not, however, show the additivity properties of emulsifiers. It was also shown that only the soluble portion of the preparations was responsible for emulsion formation. The possibility of achieving deamidation of gluten using the enzymes peptidoglutaminase I and II was examined. No activity against gluten or partially hydrolysed gluten was found...|$|E
50|$|Cinnamon bark {{is used as}} a spice. It is principally {{employed}} in cookery as a condiment and flavouring material. It is used in the preparation of chocolate, especially in Mexico, which is the main importer of cinnamon. It is also used in many dessert recipes, such as apple pie, doughnuts, and cinnamon buns, as well as spicy candies, coffee, tea, hot cocoa, and liqueurs. In the Middle East, cinnamon is often used in savoury dishes of chicken and lamb. In the United States, cinnamon and sugar are often used to <b>flavour</b> <b>cereals,</b> bread-based dishes, such as toast, and fruits, especially apples; a cinnamon-sugar mixture is even sold separately for such purposes. It is also used in Turkish cuisine for both sweet and savoury dishes. Cinnamon can also be used in pickling and Christmas drinks such as eggnog. Cinnamon powder has long been an important spice in enhancing the flavour of Persian cuisine, used in a variety of thick soups, drinks, and sweets.|$|R
40|$|The {{presented}} {{doctoral thesis}} {{is focused on}} the study of the biological effects of active compounds found in cereals, on the development of methods of analysis these effects, on the determination of the content of active substances and characterization of the relationship between composition and biological effects of cereals and cereal products. For the analysis several kinds of raw cereal samples (flakes, flour, germ, bran), flavored extruded cereal products and also samples of paddy and husked rice were chosen. To major types of analysed active compounds belong mainly phenolic compounds in the form of glycosides and aglycones, and also saccharides. Group parameters such as total polyphenols, flavonoids and total and reducing saccharides were determined spectrophotometrically, individual phenolics and saccharides were determined by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). TEAC, DPPH and CLAMS methods were used to determine the antioxidant activity. Indirect methods of determination of substances with antioxidant effect were used as well. Results of the total antioxidant activity were compared with values of antimutagenic/genotoxic activity obtained by several microbial test systems. Antimutagenic effect was expressed as a percentage of inhibition of effect of standard mutagen and could be considered as a potential preventive effect of cereals to DNA arising primarily by free radicals effect. The highest values of group and individual phenolics, antioxidant and antimutagenic activity were found in germs, bran, in buckwheat products and in coloured and raw rice. In <b>flavoured</b> <b>cereal</b> products addition of chocolate or fruit positively influences content of active phenolic substances as well as sugars, antixidant and antimutagenic activity. In a representative sample of Czech population, questionnairy study was performed to monitor interest in cereals and consumer preferences. The most of consumers consider <b>cereals</b> with chocolate <b>flavour</b> as less healthy than confirmed results of laboratory analyses. In this study some new food products were developed. Several types of model cereal products containing plant (fruit, vegetables) extracts were proposed. Extracts were added to cereals in freeze-dried and encapsulated form. The highest positive effect exhibited addition of local forrest fruit extract. Within preparation of encapsulated extracts several methods of preparing lipid or saccharides particles were also tested. The encapsulation efficiency of the methods and stability and size of particles were analysed. Optimal type of fortified cereal foods could be suggested based on the acquired results. Selected cereals were used as alternative carbon substrates (processed or raw) for the cultivation of microorganisms to produce enriched biomass usable in the feed industry. We can conclude that cereals in raw as well as processed form belong to universal foods and rich sources of biologically active substances. They can be processed by many ways. They can be used for direct consumption, as a part of new products and also undirectly as a substrate for feedstock...|$|R
40|$|The {{concept of}} learned satiety (LS) {{suggests}} that associations between the sensory quality and post-ingestive effects of foods {{may lead to}} acquired control of meal-size. Although a recent study appeared to support LS since participants learned to eat more of a <b>flavoured</b> <b>cereal</b> with lower energy density (ED) after repeated experience, suggesting that they adjusted voluntary intake to ensure adequate energy was consumed, the large serving portion used in training may have lead to over-satiation. To investigate this further, groups of 12 men were {{assigned to one of}} four conditions based on the trained serving portion (150 or 300 g) and presence or absence of cues to differentiate high and low ED versions. In the absence of sensory cues, neither mass consumed nor rated pleasantness differed between high and low ED conditions either before or after training, resulting in greater energy intake in the high ED condition. When sensory cues differentiated ED, intake increased significantly post-training in both the high ED condition trained with the small portion and low ED condition trained with the large portion, and flavour pleasantness changed similarly. Moreover hunger increased significantly after the food was tasted in both conditions where intake increased. These data provide further evidence that learning can moderate meal-size dependent on energy content, but suggest that these changes are driven by changes in flavour liking rather than LS...|$|R
40|$|Mainstream {{lager beer}} brewing using the {{tropical}} cereals sorghum, maize and rice, either as malt or as raw grain plus commercial enzymes, is becoming widespread. This review examines {{the differences in}} composition between these tropical cereals and barley {{and their impact on}} brewing processes and beer quality. All of these cereals have a starch gelatinization temperature some 10 [*]°C higher than barley. The sorghum prolamin proteins are particularly resistant to proteolysis owing to disulphide cross-linking involving γ-kafirin. Unlike barley, the major endosperm cell wall components in sorghum and maize are arabinoxylans, which persist during malting. The rice cell walls also seem to contain pectic substances. Notably, certain sorghum varieties, the tannin-type sorghums, contain considerable levels of condensed tannins (proanthocyanidins), which can substantially inhibit amylases, and probably also other brewing enzymes. Tropical cereal malts exhibit a similar complement of enzymic activities to barley malt, with the notable exception of β-amylase, which is much lower and essentially is absent in their raw grain. Concerning beer flavour, it is probable that condensed tannins, where present in sorghum, could contribute to bitterness and astringency. The compound 2 -acetyl- 1 -pyrroline, responsible for the popcorn aroma of maize and also the major aroma compound in rice, presumably affects beer flavour. However, much more research is needed into tropical <b>cereals</b> and beer <b>flavour.</b> Other future directions should include improving hydrolysis of prolamins into free amino nitrogen, possibly using prolyl carboxypeptidases and investigating tropical cereal lines with useful novel traits such as high amylopectin, high protein digestibility and low phytate[URL]...|$|R
60|$|We {{inspected}} {{the second or}} western fort, a similar battery of six 32-pounders, with two 10-inch mortars, fit only to pound 'fúfú,' or banana-paste; add a single brass field-piece, useful as a morning and evening gun for this highly military station. Then we came to Government House, apparently deserted, flying a frayed and tattered white and blue flag, {{which might have been}} used on board H.M.S. Dover, but which ought to have been supplanted on shore by a Union Jack. After waiting a quarter of an hour, we managed, with the assistance of a sentinel, whose feet were in slippers and whose artillery carbine was top-heavy with a fixed sword-bayonet, to arouse a negro servant, by whom we sent in our cards to H.E. the Administrator. An old traveller on the Gold Coast, and lately returned from a long expedition into the interior, [Footnote: Gambia: Expedition to the Upper Gambia. London: Eyre and Spottiswoode, 1882.] he had much to tell us. His knowledge of Ashanti-land, however, induced him to place the Kong Mountains in that meridian too far north; he held the distance from the seaboard to be at least 500 miles. But he quite agreed with us about the necessity of importing Chinese coolies. Here no free man works. The people say, 'When a slave gets his liberty he will drink rainwater'--rather than draw it from a well. The chief cargo of the S.S. Senegal was Chinese rice, when almost every acre of the lower Gambia would produce a <b>cereal</b> superior in <b>flavour</b> and bolder in grain. Hands, however, are wanting; and all the women are employed in loading and unloading ships.|$|R
40|$|Odour {{and taste}} are {{important}} factors in food selected and consumed by horses. Published trials in stabled horses using fifteen flavours presented at 1 % in standard meals of 100 g <b>cereal</b> by-product showed <b>flavour</b> affected diet acceptance, selection and consumption times in an otherwise identical base diet. The study reported here aimed to investigate {{the effects of a}} lower concentration of flavour i. e. 0. 5 % on initial acceptance in the same base diet. Eight novel flavours were presented to eight Thoroughbred horses (1 mare, 7 geldings) according to a Latin Square design to control for order effects. The flavours were presented at 0. 5 % in the base diet (i. e. 0. 5 g by weight in 99. 5 g) and were fed dry. The meals were presented to the horses in hanging door mangers, with a minimum of 24 hours between trial days. No more than six meals were presented in any 24 -hour period and a minimum of one hour was allowed between meals to approximate standard hunger levels. Quantity consumed, partial rejection, complete rejection and consumption times were recorded. Two flavours, agrimony and horehound were universally accepted and completely consumed by all participants. Although acceptance varied between the remaining flavours none were universally rejected. Burdock was rejected by two horses and orange by one individual. Variation in amount consumed was compared for all eight flavours using Kendall’s coefficient of concordance. This showed a significant difference existed between amount consumed (W = 0. 456, n = 8, p < 0. 001). Mean consumption times were affected by individual variation but were NS for the group overall (p = 0. 2). This trial showed flavour concentrations of 0. 5 % in a standard base diet significantly affected diet selection and acceptance, but not consumption times. These results may have practical implications in diet formulation for the equine feed industry...|$|R
40|$|The primary aim of {{this thesis}} {{was to assess the}} {{palatability}} to North Island brown kiwi (Apteryx australis mantelli) of a range of non-toxic baits and flavours used to lure baits. During the wild bait trials incubation patterns of nesting male kiwi, chick behaviour and the presence of predators at the nesting burrow were recorded. A new 'improved' ground laid 1080 paste was also tested on a range of non-target bird species. All ten captive kiwi fed at least once on at least one bait type (i. e. carrot, No. 7, RS 5, apple pulp, and paste) but did not prefer any to their usual artificial diet. Wild kiwi did not feed on any bait type placed outside the nest entrance, but may have ingested apple pulp, or paste when they probed these baits. Results indicate that cereal-based baits are the safest bait type to sow aerially in kiwi habitat, while apple pulp baits are highly acceptable to kiwi. Cinnamon, aniseed, orange and clove flavours did not significantly attract or deter captive kiwi from feeding on portions of their usual diet. Insufficient <b>flavoured</b> <b>cereal</b> No. 7 baits were eaten to determine whether any bait and flavour combination affected kiwi response to these baits. No wild kiwi fed on any cinnamon or orange <b>flavoured</b> No. 7 <b>cereal</b> baits placed outside the nesting burrow, but kiwi did probe these baits. Incubating male kiwi left the nest once each night, except for two kiwi which sometimes left the nest twice in a night. One of these sometimes made three trips from the nest in a night. The active period of kiwi {{did not appear to be}} influenced by the number of times they emerged in a night. Male kiwi tended to spend less time away from the nest when chicks were due to hatch, following which they increased the time spent away. Possums, rats and mice regularly visited kiwi nests, but did not deter males from incubating, or harm kiwi eggs or chicks. Five species - robin, saddleback, blackbird, pukeko and weka, fed on a non-toxic cinnamon-lured form of 1080 paste. Species other than those mentioned rarely landed on the ground and therefore encountered paste infrequently. Captive weka found the paste highly palatable, while 24 % of robins and possibly half of a pukeko family fed on the paste. All bird visits to the paste baits declined after the first day of exposure. Recommendations are made on the safe laying of paste baits in areas where robin, saddleback, weka or pukeko are present...|$|R
