The most prevalent {{aspects of his}} game were his skating speed, agility, and acceleration, which earned him his nickname the [...] "Russian Rocket". He {{was able to use}} his quickness to separate himself from defenders, to retrieve pucks before the opposition could in all zones of the ice, and to skate the length of the ice on many occasions. In a 1993 poll of NHL coaches conducted by hockey writer Bob McKenzie, Bure was named the league's best skater with eight of twenty-one votes, twice as many votes as any other player. One coach noted: [...] "Bure has the best combination of speed, agility and balance ... He can also use <b>change</b> <b>of</b> <b>speed</b> better than anybody in the league right now." ...|$|E
500|$|A {{generally}} {{negative reaction}} {{was given by}} critics to the Werehog concept and corresponding night-time sections, which contributed greatly to the lower than expected review scores. Some reviewers compared the Werehog sections to God of War. Complaints stemmed from the game's <b>change</b> <b>of</b> <b>speed,</b> from high-speed daytime sections to the slower, night-time sections; the [...] "pace-breaking combat levels" [...] were described as [...] "plodding", as well as [...] "lethargic" [...] and [...] "combat-heavy". Further to the change of pace, the new style of gameplay that accompanies the night-time levels was widely criticized, involving [...] "frustrating" [...] platform elements and combat described as not [...] "terribly interesting" [...] and [...] "boring", with [...] "awkward" [...] action sequences overall. Some reviewers felt that the Werehog as a concept did not mix well with the daylight areas and traditional Sonic gameplay; GamePros review described them as [...] "dreadfully out-of-place", while IGN stated that they have [...] "nothing to do with Sonic whatsoever", feeling that the Werehog was [...] "being slapped on" [...] to the Sonic experience.|$|E
2500|$|According to one source, {{the wind}} {{gradient}} is not significant for sailboats {{when the wind}} is over 6 knots (because a wind speed of 10 knots at the surface corresponds to 15 knots at 300 meters, so the change in speed is negligible over {{the height of a}} sailboat's mast). [...] According to the same source, the wind increases steadily with height up to about 10 meters in 5 knot winds but less if there is less wind. That source states that in winds with average speeds of six knots or more, the <b>change</b> <b>of</b> <b>speed</b> with height is confined almost entirely to the one or two meters closest to the surface. [...] This is consistent with another source, which shows that the change in wind speed is very small for heights over 2 meters and with a statement by the Australian Government Bureau of Meteorology according to which differences can be as little as 5% in unstable air.|$|E

In addition, {{the relationship among}} <b>speed,</b> <b>change</b> <b>of</b> direction <b>speed,</b> and reactive agility within the specific context of rugby league has not been determined. With this in mind, {{the purpose of this}} study was to investigate a wide range <b>of</b> <b>speed,</b> <b>change</b> <b>of</b> direction <b>speed,</b> and reactive agility tests commonly used by rugby league coaches to determine which, if any tests discriminated higher and lesser skilled players, and to investigate the relationship among <b>speed,</b> <b>change</b> <b>of</b> direction <b>speed,</b> and reactive agility in these athletes. Forty-two rugby league players completed tests <b>of</b> <b>speed</b> (5 m, 10 m, and 20 m sprint), <b>change</b> <b>of</b> direction <b>speed</b> (‘L’ run, 505 test, and modified 505 test), and reactive agility. The validity of the tests to discriminate higher and lesser skilled competitors was evaluated by testing first grade (N = 12) and second grade (N = 30) players. First grade players had faster speed, and movement and decision times on the reactive agility test than second grade players. No significant differences were detected between first and second grade players for <b>change</b> <b>of</b> direction <b>speed.</b> While movement times on the reactive agility test were significantly related to 10 m and 20 m sprint times and <b>change</b> <b>of</b> direction <b>speed,</b> no significant relationships were detected among measures of decision time and response accuracy during the reactive agility test and measures <b>of</b> linear <b>speed</b> and <b>change</b> <b>of</b> direction <b>speed.</b> These findings question the validity <b>of</b> preplanned <b>change</b> <b>of</b> direction <b>speed</b> tests for discriminating higher and lesser skilled rugby league players, while also highlighting the contribution of perceptual skill to agility in these athletes...|$|R

The <b>changes</b> <b>of</b> <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> sound are computed from combining two variations, time-of-flight (TOF) from a binary frequency shift-keyed (BFSK) ultrasonic signal and phase shift from two frequency continuous waves (TFCW). This technique can work in a wider range than using phase shift alone and is more accurate than TOF. In our experiment, in a temperature-controlled chamber, we placed two 40 kHz ultrasonic sensors {{face to face with a}} fixed distance in between. We use BFSK signals and TFCW of 40 kHz and 42 kHz. A single-chip microprocessor-based signal generator and phase detector are used to record and calculate TOF, phase shift and temperature. The calculated results of temperatures are then sent to either an LCD display or to a PC for calibration and examination. In a proof-of-concept experiment, it is accurate to ± 0. 3 ◦C from 0 ◦C to 60 ◦C with 0. 05 % resolution and temperature changes are instantly reflected within 100 ms.
