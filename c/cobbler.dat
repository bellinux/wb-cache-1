5|$|Animation enthusiasts {{have noticed}} {{similarities}} between Aladdin and Richard Williams' unfinished film The Thief and the <b>Cobbler</b> (also known as Arabian Knight under Miramax Films and The Princess and the <b>Cobbler</b> under Majestic Films International). These similarities include a similar plot, similar characters, scenes and background designs, and the antagonist Zig-Zag's resemblance in character design and mannerisms to Genie and Jafar. Though Aladdin was released prior to The Thief and the <b>Cobbler,</b> The Thief and the <b>Cobbler</b> initially began production much {{earlier in the}} 1960s, and was mired in difficulties including financial problems, copyright issues, story revisions and late production times caused by separate studios trying to finish the film after Richard Williams was fired from the project for lack of finished work. The late release, coupled with Miramax purchasing and re-editing the film, has sometimes resulted in The Thief and the <b>Cobbler</b> being labeled a rip-off of Aladdin.|$|E
5|$|A {{clock is}} {{documented}} in this tower since 1405, {{when a new}} bell was installed. The city accounts of 1438 mention the repair of the clockworks. The first mention of a dial is in 1443, and the first known image of the, much smaller first astrolabium dial (in the diary a <b>cobbler</b> journeyman from Ulm) is dated 1534. The jacquemart (bellstriker) is also documented in the same 1534 source.|$|E
5|$|Later {{structures}} that break the classical theme include the Gothic style boathouse, a Gothic Alcove – now a romantic ruin hidden amongst undergrowth – and a Gothic Chapel, once {{home of the}} village <b>cobbler</b> (and facetiously named St Crispin's) but later used as the estate kennels. A monument dedicated to Queen Elizabeth II was erected on her 60th birthday in 1986.|$|E
50|$|Although media usually {{classify}} Gent-Wevelgem as a <b>cobbled</b> classic, {{the route}} actually has very few sections of <b>cobbled</b> roads. Only the Kemmelberg {{and the upper}} stretches of the Kasselberg are <b>cobbled,</b> totaling a possible maximum of two kilometres of <b>cobbled</b> section, which is significantly less than the other <b>cobbled</b> races of Flanders and Northern France. Moreover, there are no flat sections of pavé and both <b>cobbled</b> climbs are in excellent condition, as {{they are part of}} a busy suburban traffic network.|$|R
5000|$|Within {{the widely}} used Krumbein phi scale of grain sizes, <b>cobbles</b> {{are defined as}} clasts of rock ranging from −6 to −8 φ. This {{classification}} corresponds with the Udden-Wentworth size scale which defines <b>cobbles</b> as clasts with diameters from 64 - 256 mm. On this scale, <b>cobbles</b> are larger than pebbles which measure 4 - 64 mm in diameter and smaller than boulders, whose diameters range from 256 - 4096 mm. On the Udden-Wentworth scale, an unlithified fraction of <b>cobbles</b> is classified as gravel while a lithified sample primarily composed of <b>cobbles</b> is a conglomerate. The Committee on Sedimentation of the US National Research Council has recommended that in situ <b>cobbles</b> be identified by their process of origination, if possible (e.g. <b>cobbles</b> by disintegration, by exfoliation, etc.).|$|R

5|$|William Calcraft (11 October 1800– 13 December 1879) was a 19th-century English hangman, one of {{the most}} {{prolific}} of British executioners. It is estimated in his 45-year career he carried out 450executions. A <b>cobbler</b> by trade, Calcraft was initially recruited to flog juvenile offenders held in Newgate Prison. While selling meat pies on streets around the prison, Calcraft met the City of London's hangman, John Foxton.|$|E
5|$|Calcraft {{was born}} in Baddow, near Chelmsford, in 1800. He was a <b>cobbler</b> by trade, but had also worked as a nightwatchman at Reid's brewery in Clerkenwell, London. While {{attempting}} {{to earn a living}} by selling meat pies on the streets around Newgate Prison he made the acquaintance of John Foxton, who was the City of London's hangman for 40years. That meeting led to his employment at Newgate to flog juvenile offenders, for which he was paid 10shillings a week.|$|E
5|$|Margaery Tyrell {{is brought}} to meet the High Sparrow, who warns her {{to stay away from}} her life of riches and sin, and recounts his past of how, as a proud <b>cobbler,</b> he learned his wealth-guided pursuits were lies and that the shoeless poor were closer to the truth than anyone. He then takes Margaery to see Loras, who is {{breaking}} under the Sparrows' torture, and is willing to do anything to make it stop. Margaery realises that the High Sparrow is trying to use Loras to break her, and tells him to remain strong.|$|E
50|$|A <b>cobble</b> (sometimes a cobblestone) is a clast of rock defined on the Udden-Wentworth {{scale as}} having a {{particle}} size of 64 - 256 mm, larger than a pebble and smaller than a boulder. Other scales define a <b>cobble's</b> size in slightly different terms. A rock made predominantly of <b>cobbles</b> is termed a conglomerate. Cobblestone is a building material based on <b>cobbles.</b>|$|R
50|$|Various {{attempts}} have been made to refine the Udden-Wentworth scale, including its definition of <b>cobbles.</b> In 1968, D. J. Doeglas proposed subdividing the <b>cobble</b> designation into two fractions, small <b>cobbles</b> (for particles with diameters from 64 - 125 mm) and large <b>cobbles</b> (for particles with diameters from 125 - 250 mm). A 1999 paper by Terence C. Blair and John G. McPherson argued that the Udden-Wentworth and Krumbein scales betrayed a historical emphasis on the study of sand grains while ignoring larger gravel grains. They proposed defining fine <b>cobbles</b> as those with diameters from 64 - 128 mm (−6 to −7 φ) and coarse <b>cobbles</b> as those with diameters from 128 - 256 mm (−7 to −8 φ). In 2012, Simon J. Blott and Kenneth Pye suggested that the <b>cobble</b> designation be eliminated altogether, replaced by very small boulder and small boulder designations equivalent in size to Blair and McPherson's fine and coarse <b>cobbles,</b> respectively.|$|R

5|$|The High Street retains various {{independent}} shops, {{including a}} <b>cobbler</b> and a butcher, but {{is seen as}} in need of improvement. Walsall Council's regeneration programme includes extensive redevelopment of the High Street; the council's view is that retail investment should be focussed on the existing shopping area rather than encouraging new developments outside this area as, based on consultants' studies, the council believes that the town could not support large-scale retail development. Specific development opportunities within {{the vicinity of the}} High Street have been identified, with particular focus on land on Silver Street, adjacent to the canal.|$|E
5|$|Manek Chowk {{is an open}} square {{near the}} centre of the city that {{functions}} as a vegetable market in the morning and a jewellery market in the afternoon. However, it is better known for its food stalls in the evening, which sell local street food. It is named after the Hindu saint Baba Maneknath. Parts of Ahmedabad are known for their folk art. The artisans of Rangeela pol make tie-dyed bandhinis, while the <b>cobbler</b> shops of Madhupura sell traditional mojdi (also known as mojri) footwear. Idols of Ganesha and other religious icons are made in huge numbers in the Gulbai Tekra area. The shops at the Law Garden sell mirror work handicraft.|$|E
5|$|Morrissey {{was born}} in the Kensington area of Liverpool, the son of Joe, a <b>cobbler,</b> and Joan, who worked for Littlewoods. He was their fourth child, {{following}} brothers Tony and Paul, and sister Karen Lane. The family lived at 45 Seldon Street, in the Kensington district of Liverpool. For National Museums Liverpool's Eight Hundred Lives project, Morrissey wrote that the house had been in his family since {{around the turn of the}} 20th century. His grandmother had been married there and his mother was born there. In 1971, the family moved to a larger, modern house on the new estates at Knotty Ash, and Seldon Street was later demolished.|$|E
5000|$|Historically, {{the common}} {{building}} {{material in the}} area has been brick or <b>cobbles</b> - extant buildings in brick date to {{as early as the}} late 17th century, alternatively large <b>cobbles</b> have also been used in the area for building construction - several structures of this type survive in the town, dating to the late 17th, 18th or 19th century, including some listed buildings, utilising <b>cobbles</b> or <b>cobbles</b> with brick. [...] The Old Hall in Hornsea Market Place dates to the early 17th century, and is built of brick on <b>cobble</b> foundations.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Cobble</b> are a {{race that}} appear in Phantom Hourglass. The <b>Cobble</b> once {{inhabited}} a prosperous land called the <b>Cobble</b> Kingdom. By the time the game takes place, the only <b>Cobble</b> that remain are ghosts of the soldiers and King Mutoh, who dress like Ancient Egyptians and reside within their respective temples, which are shaped like pyramids. The Isle of Ruins in the Northeastern Sea is {{all that remains of}} the once-mighty kingdom, and Link must visit there to retrieve the Aquanine, a pure metal entrusted to the <b>Cobble</b> by the Ocean King. There, he delves beneath Mutoh's Temple and destroys a corrupt <b>Cobble</b> war machine that has been disrupting the king's eternal rest. Also, Astrid, the fortune-teller living on the Isle of Ember, tells Link that she and her deceased assistant, Kayo, are part of the <b>Cobble</b> race.|$|R

5|$|Whale {{was born}} in Dudley, England, the sixth of seven {{children}} of William, a blast furnaceman, and Sarah, a nurse. He attended Kates Hill Board School, followed by Bayliss Charity School and finally Dudley Blue Coat School. His attendance stopped in his teenage years because the cost would have been prohibitive and his labor was needed to help support the family. Thought not physically strong enough to follow his brothers into the local heavy industries, Whale started work as a <b>cobbler,</b> reclaiming the nails he recovered from replaced soles and selling them for scrap for extra money. He discovered he had some artistic ability and earned additional money lettering signs and price tags for his neighbors. He used his additional income to pay for evening classes at the Dudley School of Arts and Crafts.|$|E
5|$|Decades later, {{during the}} {{production}} of Who Framed Roger Rabbit in 1987, the Disney studio resurrected Beauty and the Beast as a project for the satellite animation studio it had set up in London, England to work on Roger Rabbit. Richard Williams, who had directed the animated portions of Roger Rabbit, was approached to direct but declined in favor of continuing work on his long-gestating project The Thief and the <b>Cobbler.</b> In his place, Williams recommended his colleague, English animation director Richard Purdum, and work began under producer Don Hahn on a non-musical version of Beauty and the Beast set in 19th century France. At the behest of Disney CEO Michael Eisner, Beauty and the Beast became the first Disney animated film to use a screenwriter. This was an unusual production move for an animated film, which is traditionally developed on storyboards rather than in scripted form. Linda Woolverton wrote the original draft of the story before storyboarding began, and worked with the story team to retool and develop the film.|$|E
5|$|Names {{of three}} poets from the 11th century {{and some of}} their poems are available. Madara Chennaiah, a <b>cobbler</b> turned saint, is {{considered}} by H.S. Shiva Prakash as the first Vachana poet, and was held in high esteem by latter day poets of the 12th century, including Basavanna. Only ten of Chennaiah's poems, expressing his resentment of the caste system in metaphors taken from the cobblers' trade, are extant today. Dohara Kakkaiah is the second poet. A dalit by birth, his six available poems are confessional in nature, a theme seen in the later poems of Basavanna. Devara Dasimaiah (or Jedara Dasimaiah, 1040) is better known because a hundred and fifty of his poems are available. Written in a deft and concise language of proverbs and metaphors, his poems encourage monotheistic belief in the god Shiva. Dasimaiah's wife Duggale qualifies as Kannada's first women poet, though only a few of her poems are available.|$|E
5|$|Paris–Roubaix is {{sometimes}} {{compared to the}} other famous <b>cobbled</b> race, the Tour of Flanders in Belgium.

5000|$|<b>Cobble</b> {{conglomerates}} may be alluvial {{in origin}} or {{the product of}} [...] "stone avalanches", a type of debris flow resulting from unconsolidated <b>cobbles</b> and gravel. In such stone avalanches, well-rounded <b>cobbles</b> may travel the farthest on account of their low rolling friction. When the product of alluvial processes, the <b>cobble</b> conglomerate's matrix consists of gravel and coarse sand. In contrast, the matrices of flow-deposited conglomerates are primarily mud.|$|R
5|$|Elizabeth's case {{is brought}} to trial the {{following}} morning, {{with the assistance of}} the <b>cobbler</b> Richard Two-Shoes (Kaye). Elizabeth's daughter Sarah (Matthews) and son-in-law Thomas Nutter (Howick) testify that they have witnessed Elizabeth sucking from the teat of a furry creature, and speaking to a mouse (believed to be a demon). Elizabeth claims that Sarah and Thomas have falsely accused her, and want to be rid of her to make room in their house. George Waterhouse (Cooper) testifies against Elizabeth, and the accused is questioned. When others in the courtroom begin laughing at her responses, Warren declares that the next person to laugh will be executed as a witch. After an argument breaks out, the witch-finders and Pike decide that the rest of the trial should be conducted in private. Elizabeth is pricked with a needle to test her for the devil's mark. A remorseful Sarah tries to profess her mother's innocence, but Warren does not believe her. Elizabeth confesses that she has been prostituting herself to Two-Shoes, who wears a fur coat, but Two-Shoes denies this, and the trial is adjourned. Throughout proceedings, Warren is accusatory while Clarke is more cautious; Pike, meanwhile, is fascinated both by the lewd acts in which Elizabeth has supposedly engaged and by the witch-finders' torturous implements.|$|E
5|$|William Burke {{was born}} in 1792 in Urney, County Tyrone, Ireland, one of two sons to middle-class parents. Burke, along with his brother, Constantine, had a {{comfortable}} upbringing, and both joined the army as teenagers. Burke served in the Donegal Militia, until he met and married a woman from County Mayo, where they later settled. The marriage was short-lived; in 1818, after an argument with his father-in-law over land ownership, Burke deserted his wife and family. He moved to Scotland and became a labourer, working on the Union Canal. He settled in the small village of Maddiston near Falkirk, and set up home with Helen McDougal, whom he affectionately nicknamed Nelly; she became his second wife. After a few years, and when the works on the canal were finished, the couple moved to Tanners Close, Edinburgh, in November 1827. They became hawkers, selling second-hand clothes to impoverished locals. Burke then became a <b>cobbler,</b> a trade in which he experienced some success, earning upwards of £1 a week. He became known locally as an industrious and good-humoured man who often entertained his clients by singing and dancing to them on their doorsteps while plying his trade. Although raised as a Roman Catholic, Burke became a regular worshiper at Presbyterian religious meetings held in Grassmarket; he was seldom seen without a bible.|$|E
25|$|Freed of London {{currently}} employs 26 cobblers. Freed cobblers typically devote {{decades of}} their lives to handcrafting pointe shoes. Each <b>cobbler</b> makes about 50 shoes a day, {{most of which are}} custom made for individual dancers who order 20 pairs at a time from a specific, preferred <b>cobbler.</b> A letter or symbol is stamped on the sole of custom-ordered shoes to indicate the <b>cobbler</b> who made them.|$|E
50|$|The thick (two metres at bottom, tapered to one metre on top) {{outer walls}} of tulous were immune to arrows and gunfire. The lower one- to two-metre {{section of the}} outer wall was {{sometimes}} built with granite blocks or large river <b>cobbles.</b> This granite or <b>cobble</b> section was immune to digging, since the outer layer of <b>cobbles</b> was purposely laid with the smaller ends pointing outwards—it would be futile for any attacker to dig out such <b>cobbles.</b> Digging a tunnel under the wall was not possible either, because the <b>cobble</b> section wall was extended deep down more than one metre.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Cobbles,</b> {{also called}} cobblestones, derive their {{name from the}} word cob, meaning a rounded lump. The term is further related to the German , meaning head.

50|$|When {{occurring}} in streams, <b>cobbles</b> {{are likely to}} be found in mountain valley streambeds that are moderately steep. <b>Cobbles</b> are also transported by glaciers and deposited as with other grades of sediment as till. If the till is water-laid, finer particles like sand and pebbles may be entirely washed away, leaving a deposit of only boulders and <b>cobbles.</b> Glacially transported <b>cobbles</b> tend to share several identifying features including a tabular shape and downward diagonal striations on lateral facets.|$|R

The race culminates with 750m {{on the smooth}} {{concrete}} of the large outdoor Vélodrome André-Pétrieux in Roubaix. The route is adjusted {{from year to year}} as older roads are resurfaced and the organisers seek more <b>cobbles</b> to maintain the character of the race— in 2005, for example, the race included 54.7km of <b>cobbles.</b>|$|R
