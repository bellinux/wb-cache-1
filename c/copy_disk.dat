30|$|The {{file system}} state {{consistency}} during live migration within a local cloud environment is typically ensured by adopting well-established shared storage solutions, such as Network Attached Storage (NAS) and Storage Area Network (SAN). In {{this case the}} migrating VMs {{are attached to the}} same file system, available at both source and destination hosts, so that {{there is no need to}} <b>copy</b> <b>disk</b> images. Different is the case of live migration to a remote DC: the storage located at the destination must be synchronized with the one at the source, and this may require to perform large data transfers—in the worst case to copy an entire VM disk image. An efficient solution consists in: (i) executing the bulk storage data transfer before launching the actual VM live migration, (ii) recording all write operations happening during the transfer, and (iii) applying the changes at the destination when the VM is being migrated [23, 24]. Template disk images and write throttling mechanisms allow to reduce the amount of bulk storage data to be transferred and the number of changes to be applied, respectively.|$|E

50|$|ALF {{had some}} {{experience}} with floppy drives and hard drives, particularly with the S-100 systems, and began designing <b>disk</b> <b>copying</b> software and hardware for internal use. At computer industry conventions, ALF was often asked by other software and hardware companies how ALF was getting their <b>disks</b> <b>copied,</b> since this was a common problem in the industry. When they discovered ALF had designed their own equipment, many companies {{asked if they could}} buy the equipment or if ALF would <b>copy</b> their <b>disks.</b> ALF began <b>copying</b> <b>disks</b> for several software companies, at first largely as favors to the exhibitors ALF's employees had socialized with at the conventions. These casual arrangements soon evolved into a full-fledged <b>disk</b> <b>copying</b> service which ALF began advertising in computer magazines.|$|R

5000|$|This {{worked to}} block out {{illegally}} copied games, as when a game was conventionally copied to another CD (‘burnt’) it would not copy the RAC. However, the RAC also blocked legally <b>copied</b> <b>disks</b> [...] and games legally purchased from different regional codes.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the early}} days of the Amiga platform, about 16 disk copiers were created in a short amount of time (1985 - 1989) that enabled <b>copying</b> Amiga floppy <b>disks,</b> {{including}} Nibbler, QuickNibble, ZCopier, XCopy/Cachet, FastCopier, Disk Avenger, Tetra Copier (which enabled the user to play Tetris while <b>copying</b> <b>disks),</b> Cyclone, Maverick, D-Copy, Safe II, PowerCopier, Quick Copier, Marauder II (styled as [...] "Marauder //"), Rattle Copy, and BurstNibble.|$|R
50|$|Others were novel, {{including}} protocols for printer spooling, <b>copying</b> <b>disk</b> packs, page-level {{remote access}} to file servers, name lookup, remote management, etc. (although some of these capabilities had been seen before, e.g. the ARPANET already made heavy use of remote management for controlling the Interface Message Processors which made it up).|$|R

50|$|CPS {{also offered}} a {{hardware}} add-in expansion card, the Copy II PC Deluxe Board, which was bundled {{with its own}} software. The Copy II PC Deluxe Board was able to read, write and <b>copy</b> <b>disks</b> from Apple II and Macintosh computer systems as well. COPY II PCs main competitor was Quaid Softwares CopyWrite, which {{did not have a}} hardware component.|$|R
50|$|VGA-Copy was a MS-DOS {{software}} to <b>copy</b> floppy <b>disks.</b> It {{was able to}} read erroneous floppies.|$|R
50|$|GParted (acronym of GNOME Partition Editor) is a GTK+ {{front-end}} to GNU Parted and {{an official}} GNOME partition-editing application (alongside Disks). GParted {{is used for}} creating, deleting, resizing, moving, checking, and <b>copying</b> <b>disk</b> partitions and their file systems. This is useful for creating space for new operating systems, reorganizing <b>disk</b> usage, <b>copying</b> data residing on hard disks, and mirroring one partition with another (disk imaging).|$|R
5000|$|Later ALF {{began selling}} two related <b>disk</b> <b>copying</b> products. One was a {{software}} product that ran {{on a standard}} Apple II computer, but <b>copied</b> <b>disks</b> faster than Apple's software and much more reliably. The other was a product that combined that software with additional hardware to allow even faster copying. The software-only product was originally named [...] "PenultiCopy"; [...] "penulti" [...] from [...] "penultimate", meaning second best or second from the top (i.e. second compared to the hardware product), but unfortunately more often meaning next to last. This was soon changed to the more apt name of [...] "Total Accuracy Copy Program".|$|R
50|$|<b>Disk</b> <b>Copy</b> 6.0 {{added support}} for the New Disk Image Format (NDIF). Versions of <b>Disk</b> <b>Copy</b> in Mac OS X added {{support for the}} newer Universal Disk Format (UDIF) image format, {{introduced}} with DMG files in Mac OS X.|$|R
50|$|<b>Disk</b> <b>Copy</b> Fast and its professional/commercial version <b>Disk</b> <b>Copy</b> Plus were {{authored}} by Chang Ping Lee. The last known version is 5.3a released in 1996. This software does not run well under Windows XP or newer. This software may be abandonware.|$|R
50|$|Part of the Fast Hack'em <b>disk</b> <b>copy</b> {{software}} was a nibbler {{used to produce}} copies of copy protected Commodore 64 commercial software. When using the nibbler, <b>disk</b> <b>copying</b> was done on a very low level, bit-by-bit rather than using standard Commodore DOS commands. This effectively nullified the efficacy of deliberate disk errors, non-standard track layouts, and related forms of copy prevention. <b>Copying</b> a protected <b>disk</b> took approximately 60 seconds if being copied directly to another disk drive, or 3 minutes (plus several disk swaps) if performed using a single disk drive.|$|R
50|$|Other image formats {{supported}} by <b>Disk</b> <b>Copy</b> include DiskSet and raw disk images.|$|R
50|$|<b>Disk</b> <b>Copy</b> {{was also}} {{the name of an}} Apple utility {{distributed}} with some of the earliest versions of the classic Mac OS. In order to <b>copy</b> 400K floppy <b>disks</b> using as few disk swaps as possible on a machine with only 128K of RAM, the original <b>Disk</b> <b>Copy</b> used the screen buffer to store binary data from the disk being copied; as a result, the screen (other than a small area at the bottom displaying the GUI) filled with noise while copying was in progress. It was shipped with System 1.1 and System 2.0, probably as a reaction to a bug in the first version of Finder causing excessive disk swaps.|$|R
50|$|Fast Hack'em also {{included}} a superfast disk copier that could <b>copy</b> unprotected <b>disks</b> at even higher speeds. Only 35 seconds were required for a direct drive-to-drive copy, or 2 minutes plus swapping time for a single-drive copy.|$|R
50|$|This {{program was}} {{originally}} used to track a heart monitoring {{program for the}} IBM PC, and pirates were distributing illicit <b>copies</b> of the <b>disks.</b> This tracking program was supposed to stop and track illegal <b>copies</b> of the <b>disk,</b> however the program also sometimes used the last 5k on an Apple floppy, making additional saves to the disk by other programs impossible.|$|R
50|$|The technique, {{developed}} by Mark Duchaineau, involved writing {{the data on}} spiralling paths on the disk rather than in concentric circles. Initially, no commercial copying software or bit nibbler could successfully <b>copy</b> the <b>disks</b> it was applied to.|$|R
5000|$|The NIBTOOLS is a disk {{transfer}} {{program designed}} for <b>copying</b> original <b>disks</b> and converting them into G64 and D64 disk image formats on a PC. NIBTOOLS requires OpenCBM. NIBTOOLS {{is based on}} MNIB and was developed since 2005 by Pete Rittwage.|$|R
50|$|In Mac OS X v10.2.3, Apple {{introduced}} Compressed Disk Images and Internet-Enabled Disk Images for {{use with}} the Apple utility <b>Disk</b> <b>Copy,</b> which was later integrated into Disk Utility in 10.3. The <b>Disk</b> <b>Copy</b> application {{had the ability to}} display a multi-lingual software license agreement before mounting a disk image. The image will not be mounted unless the user indicates agreement with the license.|$|R
5000|$|On 8 November 2007, SlySoft {{claimed to}} have {{completely}} cracked BD+. However, {{this turned out to}} be incorrect, as subsequent versions of BD+ security code have caused SlySoft to re-design its software. On 3 March 2008, SlySoft updated AnyDVD HD allowing the full decryption of BD+, allowing for not only the viewing of the film itself but also playing and <b>copying</b> <b>disks</b> with third-party software. A third iteration of BD+ was released in November 2008, and was announced to be cracked by SlySoft with the release of AnyDVD HD 6.5.0.2 on 29 December 2008. [...] A fourth version of BD+ security code was discovered with the movie Australia on 17 February 2009, thwarting the effectiveness of SlySoft's software.|$|R

5000|$|Before Mac OS X Panther, the {{functionality}} of Disk Utility {{was spread}} across two applications: <b>Disk</b> <b>Copy</b> and <b>Disk</b> Utility. <b>Disk</b> <b>Copy</b> {{was used for}} creating and mounting disk image files whereas Disk Utility was used for formatting, partitioning, verifying and repairing file structures. The ability to [...] "zero" [...] all data (multi-pass formatting) on a disk was not added until Mac OS X 10.2.3. Further changes introduced in Mac OS X Tiger, specifically version 10.4.3, allowed Disk Utility {{to be used to}} verify the file structure of the current boot drive. Mac OS X Leopard added the ability to create, resize and delete disk partitions without erasing them, a feature known as live partitioning. In OS X El Capitan, Disk Utility has a different user interface and lost the ability to repair permissions due to obsolescence, create and manage disks formatted as RAID, burn discs and multi-pass format internal solid-state drives and encrypted external drives.|$|R

50|$|When ALF {{began selling}} music cards for the Apple II, floppy disk drives {{were not yet}} common on the Apple, so the {{software}} was supplied on cassette tape. ALF worked closely with a local cassette tape duplication company, helping them modify equipment designed for voice and music to copy cassettes with data in Apple's format. They asked ALF to design equipment to <b>copy</b> floppy <b>disks</b> so they could do business in that market as well, but ALF, wanting to focus on their own products, declined. When ALF later began offering the music card software on floppy disks, they quickly discovered that existing methods for <b>copying</b> the <b>disks</b> were slow and extremely unreliable. ALF {{went back to the}} cassette duplication company to work with them on creating floppy duplicators, but by that time the cassette company had decided not to enter the floppy business.|$|R
