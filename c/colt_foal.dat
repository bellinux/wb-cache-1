50|$|The Flying Dutchman {{was out of}} the 15-hand mare Barbelle. She was by the {{stallion}} Sandbeck, who won the 1823 Club Stakes at Doncaster and 1824 York's Fitzwilliam Stakes, {{and produced}} the colt Redshank. Her other offspring included Van Tromp (by Lanercost), who was quite successful on the turf and at stud. His success led to Lord Eglinton's decision to agree to purchase any of her future foals £1,000.

5000|$|Whizgig was {{retired from}} racing {{to become a}} broodmare at the Duke of Grafton's stud and {{produced}} nine foals between 1825 and 1839 with names {{that began with the}} letter [...] "O". Her union with Orville produced a <b>colt</b> <b>foal</b> named Omen in 1825 and two years later she produced a colt named Orbit, sire by Centaur. Neither colt made any impact on the racecourse, but Whizgig established her reputation as a broodmare with her third foal, a bay filly by Emilius foaled in 1828. Named Oxygen she won the Oaks for the Duke of Grafton in 1831 before becoming a successful broodmare. Her descendants included the Prix du Jockey Club winners Saint Germain and Jouvence. Whizgig died in 1840.|$|E
50|$|Pinza {{a massive}} bay colt {{standing}} over 16 hands was sired by Chanteur {{out of the}} mare Pasqua. He was officially bred by the notable trainer Fred Darling, but the mating which produced Pinza was actually arranged by Pasqua's previous owner, Mrs H. E. Morriss, who sent the mare in foal to the Newmarket sales in December 1949. Darling was impressed by Pasqua's pedigree and bought her for 2,000 guineas, acting through a representative as {{he was out of}} the country at the time. When Darling saw Pasqua, he was not impressed and sold her at a loss, but not before she had produced the <b>colt</b> <b>foal</b> who was later named Pinza. As a yearling, the colt was sent to the Newmarket Sales where he was bought for 1,500 guineas by the businessman and hotelier Sir Victor Sassoon. Sassoon named the colt after the Ezio Pinza after seeing the singer performing in South Pacific on Broadway.|$|E
5000|$|In November 1992, the <b>colt</b> <b>foal</b> was {{consigned}} by West to the Tattersalls sale {{where he}} attracted little interest and was bought for 1,150 guineas by J Halford. The sale {{does not appear}} to have been finalised as the foal returned to West's ownership. At Doncaster the following March he was again put up for auction and sold for 2,700 guineas to the trainer David Barron. Coastal Bluff was taken into training by Barron at Maunby, North Yorkshire and a three-quarter share was sold to David Sharp who raced the horse in the ownership of his wife. Barron's stable was known as a [...] "gambling yard" [...] which often landed big wins in the betting market: the trainer admitted [...] "If I can help an owner's expenses, I will. I'm not someone who gives out information easily, and I believe that if there is any money to be made, the man who's paying the bills should get the first chance to make it." [...] In his early career Coastal Bluff was always ridden by either Kevin Darley or Jimmy Fortune.|$|E

50|$|Nebbiolo was a strongly-built {{chestnut}} {{horse with}} a white blaze and white socks on his hind legs. He was sired by the Gimcrack Stakes winner Yellow God out of the German-bred mare Novara. The Danish businessman Niels Schibbye had owned Novara during a racing career which saw her win several good races in Germany, but sold her after an operation an ovarian cyst was thought to have rendered her useless as a broodmare. When Novara proved to be fertile, Schibbye bought her back for 11,000 guineas in December 1973. She was in foal (pregnant) to Yellow God {{at the time and}} the <b>colt</b> <b>foal</b> who would be named Nebbiolo was delivered the following spring. Schibbye sent Nebbiolo to the sales as a yearling in October 1975, but he failed to reach his reserve price of 3,000 guineas. He then turned down a private offer when he learned that the colt's prospective owners intended to have him gelded and trained for a National Hunt career. Schibbye instead decided to race the colt in his own colours and sent him to be trained in Ireland by Kevin Prendergast.|$|E
