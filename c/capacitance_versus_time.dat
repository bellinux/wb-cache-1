30|$|The above {{simulations}} {{are focused}} on the charge storage behaviors for internal EDL structures, while the external EDL structure can also affect the capacitance. As Varanasi et al.’s work [104] indicated, the curve of <b>capacitance</b> <b>versus</b> thickness of external fluid region exhibits an initial steep increase, followed by a stable region. Moreover, the addition of organic solvents affects the energy storage. On the one hand, it could slow down the oscillation of the curve of <b>capacitance</b> <b>versus</b> pore size after the first peak, resulting from modulating the polarity of solvent molecules (Fig.  7 d) [105, 106]. The addition of small amount of solvent can increase the capacitance, compared with pure RTIL electrolyte [107], but a non-monotonic variation of capacitance when mole fraction increases from 0 to 1 (Fig.  7 g) [108]. On the other hand, the presence of ACN molecules enhances the motions of RTIL ions (Fig.  7 f) [109, 110], ascribed to the weakened Coulombic interactions caused by the longer distance between the electrolyte ions. For water solvent, it can weaken the ionic effects, leading to almost identical capacitances for diverse ions with varying diameters and valences [111]. The affinity of impurity to the nanopore can affect the capacitive performance [112].|$|R

We observe that this length scale plays an important role when the tip to sample separation is less than about 10 nm. Its origin can be modeled as a tiny protrusion {{at the end of the}} tip. The protrusion causes deviation from a logarithmic increase of <b>capacitance</b> <b>versus</b> decreasing height of the probe above the sample.

40|$|Abstract—In a {{conventional}} parallel plate MEMS variable capacitor, the <b>capacitance</b> <b>versus</b> voltage response (C-V response) has been deterministic. In this work, the C-V response is tuned versatilely {{through the application}} of a control voltage to an additional electrode in order that the initial gap between the parallel capacitor plates is set by the control voltage. Then, the capacitor plates are lifted (capacitance decreases) as the actuation voltage applied to the levering actuator increases. In this manner, the shape of the C-V response can be controlled even after the device is fabricated. At a zero control voltage, the fabricated MEMS variable capacitor exhibited a convex shape in the C-V response (i. e. the capacitance decreases slowly in the low actuation voltage region and rapidly in the high actuation voltage region). When 3 V was applied to the control voltage, the capacitor exhibited an almost linear C-V response with a linearity factor of 0. 999. At 5 V of control voltage, the C-V response changed to a relatively concave shape (i. e. the capacitance decreases rapidly in the low actuation voltage region and slowly in the high actuation voltage region). The capacitance tuning ratio of the fabricated device exceeded 120 % at all control voltages. The proposed C-V response tuning capability is vital and amenable to various circuit demands.
