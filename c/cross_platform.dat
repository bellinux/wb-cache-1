25|$|The Victoria {{line was}} {{recommended}} in a 1949 report {{as it would}} reduce congestion on other lines. After some experimental tunnelling in 1959, construction began in 1963 and, unlike the earlier tubes, the tunnels {{did not have to}} follow the roads above. The line was originally approved to run from Walthamstow to Victoria station, the extension to Brixton being authorised later. As part of the works, Oxford Circus station was rebuilt to allow interchange with the Central and Bakerloo lines. <b>Cross</b> <b>platform</b> interchanges were built at Euston, Highbury & Islington and Finsbury Park. After running trains from Walthamstow, first to Finsbury Park and then to Warren Street in 1968, the line to Victoria was officially opened in March 1969. The extension to Brixton opened in 1971. Designed for automatic train operation, access to the platforms was by using magnetically encoded tickets collected by automatic gates.|$|E

25|$|Shellcode {{cannot be}} {{executed}} directly. In order to analyze what a shellcode attempts {{to do it}} must be loaded into another process. One common analysis technique is to write a small C program which holds the shellcode as a byte buffer, and then use a function pointer or use inline assembler to transfer execution to it. Another technique is to use an online tool, such as shellcode_2_exe, to embed the shellcode into a pre-made executable husk which can then be analyzed in a standard debugger. Specialized shellcode analysis tools also exist, such as the iDefense sclog project which was originally released in 2005 {{as part of the}} Malcode Analyst Pack. Sclog is designed to load external shellcode files and execute them within an API logging framework. Emulation based shellcode analysis tools also exist such as the sctest application {{which is part of the}} <b>cross</b> <b>platform</b> libemu package. Another emulation based shellcode analysis tool, built around the libemu library, is scdbg which includes a basic debug shell and integrated reporting features.|$|E
500|$|While {{developing}} the game, the production team sought to use elements of other games as influences {{on how to}} create a Star Trek based game that was along the same lines as the 2009 film. Digital Extremes creative director Sheldon Carter described this as [...] "It's like someone spliced Metroid Prime into my Uncharted". Miller explained that it was due {{to the success of the}} Mass Effect series of games that allowed for space-based adventure games such as Star Trek to be made, although they were not seeking to include the role-playing game elements seen in that series. Miller explained that there was a [...] "circular influence" [...] with each franchise influenced by the other. Further influences were found in The Original Series, as one level which pits Spock against Kirk was inspired by a similar scene in the episode [...] "Amok Time", originally broadcast on television just under 47years before the launch of the game. While it was intended to be a <b>cross</b> <b>platform</b> launch, the producers decided not to incorporate hands free gaming using either Kinect or the PlayStation Move.|$|E

Passengers enter the station building and have their admission ticket checked. They then enter a queue which takes them farther into the station building, under a split-flap departure board, and past London-related advertisements, several stacks of suitcases and a shop selling food. After ascending a flight of stairs, passengers find themselves between signs for King's <b>Cross</b> <b>Platform</b> 9 and Platform 10. They can see those ahead of them walking through the [...] "wall" [...] forming the entrance to Platform [...] This effect uses the Pepper's ghost illusion.
