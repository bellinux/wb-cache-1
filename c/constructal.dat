This activity has allowed producing a preliminary design method that applies to road vehicles, and has improved the EMIPS method by De Wulf with a more detailed evaluation of the losses and has produced today largest database of calculated data of energy efficiency and emissions. He has also introduced a method for evaluating the energy lost for moving the vehicle and the payload. The robustness of the data have been verified by Mittal and Singh, Centre for Public Policy of Indian Institute of Management Bangalore.|$|E

Throughout the school's history, Duke researchers have made breakthroughs, including the biomedical engineering department's development of the world's first real-time, three-dimensional ultrasound diagnostic system and the first engineered blood vessels and stents. In 2015, Paul Modrich shared the Nobel Prize in Chemistry. In 2012, Robert Lefkowitz along with Brian Kobilka, who is also a former affiliate, shared the Nobel Prize in chemistry for their work on cell surface receptors. [...] In the mechanical engineering department, Adrian Bejan developed the <b>constructal</b> theory, which explains the shapes that arise in nature. Duke has pioneered studies involving nonlinear dynamics, chaos, and complex systems in physics. In May 2006 Duke researchers mapped the final human chromosome, which made world news as the Human Genome Project was finally complete. Reports of Duke researchers' involvement in new AIDS vaccine research surfaced in June 2006. The biology department combines two historically strong programs in botany and zoology, while one of the divinity school's leading theologians is Stanley Hauerwas, whom Time named [...] "America's Best Theologian" [...] in 2001. The graduate program in literature boasts several internationally renowned figures, including Fredric Jameson, Michael Hardt, and Rey Chow, while philosophers Robert Brandon and Lakatos Award-winner Alexander Rosenberg contribute to Duke's ranking as the nation's best program in philosophy of biology, according to the Philosophical Gourmet Report.|$|E

50|$|The <b>constructal</b> law {{asks the}} question: Why does this design arise at all? Why can't the water just seep through the ground? The <b>constructal</b> law {{provides}} this answer: Because the water flows better with design. The <b>constructal</b> law covers {{the tendency of}} nature to generate designs to facilitate flow.|$|E
50|$|No {{criticism}} {{has been published}} in the peer reviewed literature against the <b>constructal</b> law as a law of physics. Strictly speaking refs. published after 1996 do not refer to the <b>constructal</b> law at all. There is one scholar who questioned the clarity of the language used in the <b>constructal</b> law. In ref., Kleidon wrote “It is as yet unclear how the term ‘access’ in the definition of the <b>constructal</b> theory (sic) can be quantified, but its original roots are undoubtedly in thermodynamics”. Bejan has responded by noting that one cannot prove a first principle based on other first principles. The <b>constructal</b> law is not about what flows, but about the physics phenomenon of how any flow system acquires its evolving configuration (design) over time. The <b>constructal</b> law is not about optimality (max, min, opt)—it is the definition of “life” in physics terms, and of the time direction of the changes in flow configuration.|$|E
50|$|The <b>constructal</b> law {{provides}} a unifying theory of evolution. It holds that inanimate and animate phenomena generate evolving configurations {{to move more}} easily. The <b>constructal</b> law also provides the physics definition of life, {{of what it means}} to be alive. It states that life means flow and the free generation of design. If the flows stop, the system is dead (in thermodynamic equilibrium). The <b>constructal</b> law is the physics law of life, design and evolution.|$|E
5000|$|In {{contrast}} to fractal models of observed objects in nature, the <b>constructal</b> law is predictive {{and thus can}} be tested experimentally. Many natural designs, animate and inanimate, have been explained and unified by the <b>constructal</b> law. For example: ...|$|E
5000|$|Bejan and Lorente {{expanded}} on this [...] {{by explaining}} {{the difference between}} a law of physics (e.g., the <b>constructal</b> law) and the many invocations of the law, which underpin many “theories” based on the law. In the section titled “The <b>constructal</b> law versus the second law of thermodynamics” they noted that the <b>constructal</b> law and the second law are first principles. The <b>constructal</b> law is a useful reminder not only of what was missing in physics and thermodynamics (the law of design and evolution) but also of what is present. For example, contrary to the critic’s view, the first and second laws of thermodynamics did not require any “proof based on simplified systems of statistical physics.” ...|$|E
5000|$|The <b>constructal</b> law was {{proposed}} in 1996 as {{a summary of}} all design generation and evolution phenomena in nature, bio and non-bio. The <b>constructal</b> law represents three steps toward making [...] "design in nature" [...] a concept and law-based domain in science: ...|$|E
50|$|In 2012 Doubleday {{published}} his book with Professor Adrian Bejan of Duke University titled “Design in Nature: How the <b>Constructal</b> Law Governs Evolution in Biology, Physics, Technology, and Social Organization.” It details Bejan’s {{discovery of the}} <b>constructal</b> law, a principle of physics which proclaims that shape and structure arises and evolves in nature to facilitate flow access.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Constructal</b> law is {{a theory}} in physics {{concerning}} the generation of design (configurations, patterns, geometry) in nature. According to this theory, natural design and the <b>constructal</b> law unite all animate and inanimate systems.The <b>constructal</b> law was stated by Adrian Bejan in 1996 as follows: [...] "For a finite-size system to persist in time (to live), it must evolve {{in such a way}} that it provides easier access to the imposed currents that flow through it.""Constructal" [...] was coined by Bejan to describe the natural tendency of flow systems (e.g. rivers, trees and branches,lungs, tectonic platesand engineered forms)to generate and evolve structures that increase flow access.|$|E

5000|$|Some authors {{observe that}} modular design has {{generated}} in the vehicle industry a constant increase of weight over time. Trancossi [...] advanced the hypothesis that modular design can be coupled by some optimization criteria derived from the <b>constructal</b> law. In fact, the <b>constructal</b> law is modular for his nature and can apply with interesting results in engineering simple systems. It applies with a typical bottom-up optimization schema: ...|$|E
50|$|There is {{also the}} claim that “the <b>constructal</b> law {{can be seen as}} a {{complement}} to MEP (maximum entropy production)”.|$|E
50|$|The <b>constructal</b> {{law is a}} law of physics—the law {{of design}} {{generation}} and evolution in nature. The natural phenomenon is not the elimination but the distribution (better and better over time) of imperfection. The distribution of imperfection generates the geometry (shape, structure) of the system. Today, optimization of many systems arising in thermal engineering such as conductive pathways (fins, cavities and highly conductive inserts), convective channels and radiative systems are inspired by <b>constructal</b> law.|$|E
50|$|This {{includes}} the seemingly “characteristic” sizes of organs, {{the shape of}} bones, the rhythm of breathing lungs and beating hearts, of undulating tails, running legs, and flapping wings. The <b>constructal</b> law proclaims that all these designs have arisen—and work together—to allow animals, like raindrops in a river basin, to move more easily across a landscape. Because human beings are not separate from but a part of nature, their designs are also governed by the <b>constructal</b> law.|$|E
5000|$|The physics {{principle}} [...] {{that accounts}} for the urge to have sustainability, and for the evolutionary design in general, is the <b>constructal</b> law.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>constructal</b> {{law is a}} {{statement}} of a natural tendency—the time direction of the phenomenon. It is as non-mathematical as the original statements of the second law: ...|$|E
50|$|Bejan and Lorente {{also argued}} that all the {{optimality}} (max,min) statements have limited ad-hoc applicability, and are unified under the <b>Constructal</b> law of design and evolution in nature.|$|E
50|$|Flow {{leads to}} better flow. Like any other law of physics, the <b>constructal</b> {{law is a}} concise summary of {{observed}} facts: the natural tendency of flow systems to evolve toward configurations that provide easier access over time. The word “access” means {{the ability to move}} through a confined space such as a crowded room. This is why “finite size” appears in the <b>constructal</b> law statement. This mental viewing covers all the flow design and evolution phenomena, animate and inanimate, because they all morph to enter and to flow better, more easily.|$|E
50|$|Finally, Reis has {{showed that}} MEP (maximum entropy production), like its {{complete}} opposite (minimum entropy production) {{is a special}} ad-hoc optimality principle that is covered by the <b>constructal</b> law.|$|E
50|$|Bejan and Lorente {{argued that}} {{complexity}} is modest (not maximum, not increasing), {{and is a}} feature of the natural phenomenon of design generation in nature, which is predicted by the <b>Constructal</b> law.|$|E
50|$|Bejan and Lorente (2010) {{claimed that}} all the {{proposed}} optimality statements (min, max, opt, and design) have limited ad-hoc applicability, and are unified under their own proposed <b>Constructal</b> law of design and evolution in nature.|$|E
50|$|Evolution never ends. Optimality {{statements}} (minimum, maximum, optimum, static, end design, destiny) {{have only}} local, limited applicability. The <b>constructal</b> law covers {{them because it}} is about the time direction of all the evolutionary design phenomenon.|$|E
50|$|For example, in point-area and point-volume flows, the <b>constructal</b> law predicts tree architectures, such flows {{displaying}} {{at least}} two regimes: one highly resistive and one with lower resistivity. The constructal-law tendency manifests itself at every scale.|$|E
50|$|One {{reservation}} {{toward the}} <b>constructal</b> law {{is that its}} formulation is vague. The <b>constructal</b> law states that “For a finite-size system to persist in time (to live), it must evolve {{in such a way}} that it provides easier access to the imposed currents that flow through it”, but there is neither a mention of what these “currents” are nor an explicit definition of what “providing easier access” means, nor precisely formulating the relationship with math. Without defining the physical quantities or their exact relationships, it is not physical or mathematical. There has been no attempt to prove it from first principles. Contrarily to alternative theories of non-equilibrium thermodynamics.|$|E
50|$|A new {{law does}} not have to be stated in {{mathematical}} terms. The mathematization of the second law statement (and of thermodynamics) came later. The <b>constructal</b> law underwent the same evolution. The 1996 statement was followed in 2004 by a complete mathematical formulation of constructal-law thermodynamics.|$|E
50|$|Adrian Bejan is an American {{professor}} who developed modern thermodynamics and the <b>constructal</b> law {{of design and}} evolution in nature. He is J. A. Jones Distinguished Professor of Mechanical Engineering at Duke University {{and author of the}} 2016 book The Physics of Life: The Evolution of Everything.|$|E
5000|$|Bejan [...] {{also noted}} that the {{phenomenon}} governed by the <b>constructal</b> law (design in nature) is macroscopic (finite size, not infinitesimal). It is the birth of design and evolution of design in all the parts together. It is dynamic, not static. The evolution never ends. There is no end design, no destiny (max, min, opt).|$|E
5000|$|The <b>constructal</b> law {{defines the}} time {{direction}} of all evolutionary design phenomena. It states that designs should evolve {{over time to}} acquire better configurations to provide more access for the currents that flow through them. It defines in physics terms {{what it means to}} be [...] "better", more [...] "fit", to [...] "survive", and to be efficient. Not all changes are improvements, but those that stick measurably enhance flow.|$|E
50|$|The two laws of {{thermodynamics}} do {{not account}} for nature completely. Nature is not made of black boxes. Nature’s boxes are filled with evolving, freely morphing configurations—even {{the fact that they}} have names (rivers, blood vessels) is due to their appearance, organization, or design. Where the second law commands that things should flow from high to low, the <b>constructal</b> law commands that they evolve in configurations that flow more and more easily over time.|$|E
50|$|Although treelike {{structures}} {{are a very}} common design in nature, they are only one manifestation of the <b>constructal</b> law. In a simple example, logs floating on a lake or icebergs at sea orient themselves perpendicular to the wind which increases the transfer of motion from the moving air body to the water body. A more complex example is the design of animals that have evolved to move mass more efficiently (to cover more distance per unit of useful energy) across the landscape.|$|E
50|$|The <b>constructal</b> law covers natural {{phenomena}} of organization, such as tree-shaped flows, round tubes and bones, scaling laws, etc. The lightning bolts that flash {{across the sky}} generate a tree-like structure {{because this is a}} good design for moving a current (electricity) from an area (the cloud) to a point (a church steeple or another cloud). The circulatory and nervous systems of biological creatures generate a similar tree-like design because they too are moving currents from a point to an area and from an area to a point.|$|E
50|$|The <b>constructal</b> law is {{proposed}} {{as a first}} principle of physics accounting for all design and evolution in nature. It holds that shape and structure arise to facilitate flow. The designs that happen spontaneously in nature reflect this tendency: they allow entities to flow more easily - to measurably move more current farther and faster per unit of useful energy consumed. Rain drops, for example, coalesce and move together, generating rivulets, streams and the mighty river basins of the world because this design allows them to move more easily.|$|E
50|$|<b>Constructal</b> design {{occurs at}} every scale. Each {{component}} of an evolving flow system—each rivulet, each tree, and each road—acquires evolving designs to facilitate flow access. As these elements coalesce into {{larger and larger}} structures (into evolving river basins, forests and transport networks), a hierarchy emerges such that the multi sized components and channels work together so that everything flows more easily. This {{is seen in the}} shape and structure of the neural networks in the brain, of the alveoli in the lung, the size and distribution of vegetation in the forest and of human settlements on the map.|$|E
