5|$|Another of Harrison's goals was {{to raise}} {{the morale of the}} {{workforce}} and locomotive engineers; crews were assigned to the same locomotives, and senior engineers were allowed to paint their names on their engines. When business declined in 1914 Harrison reduced his salary by 20percent, but introduced smaller and graduated <b>cuts</b> <b>for</b> other staff, with the smallest percentages at the lowest pay scales. Other efforts to improve morale included rewards for fuel efficiency and the improvement of safety, including stricter investigation of accidents.|$|E
5|$|Following an {{off-season}} {{marred by}} financial difficulties {{that resulted in}} wage <b>cuts</b> <b>for</b> a number of riders, the 2005 spring season was the strongest yet for CSC, with wins by Julich and Jens Voigt. Julich's victory in Paris–Nice made him the first rider to wear the leader's jersey in the new UCI ProTour. This was followed by three team stage wins in the Giro d'Italia, one by David Zabriskie and two by Basso, though the overall victory escaped from Basso when he was beset by a stomach ailment.|$|E
5|$|It was one {{of these}} prizes that, in the year 1986, was won by {{director}} Anja Breien, who decided to sell it through a newspaper advert, as a protest against that year's budget <b>cuts</b> <b>for</b> Norwegian film. The Swedish Film Institute, which had experienced similar cuts and sympathized, bought the sculpture. In 2005, as Breien was presented with an honorary award, she was also given back the original sculpture by former Minister of Culture and director of the Swedish Film Institute, Åse Kleveland.|$|E

2500|$|The {{film was}} {{initially}} {{slated to be}} released on 1 October 2013 to coincide with Nigeria's 53rd Independence anniversary, but it got postponed to February 2014 due to unfinished post production. The film was however not released on the specified date and several other release dates were subsequently posted on the internet including 25 April, May and June 2014. Golden Effects eventually announced that a release date for the film couldn't be specified, and that the several postponements were due to the other highly anticipated films that had been scheduled for release in 2014 including: Render to Caesar released in March, Half of a Yellow Sun in April (later shifted to August) and others like '76 and Dazzling Mirage without release dates yet; Afolayan {{pointed out that the}} films needed to be spaced in order to maximize box office returns. It was revealed that there will be more than one <b>cut</b> <b>for</b> the film; a <b>cut</b> <b>for</b> the local [...] audience, a <b>cut</b> <b>for</b> African audience, a <b>cut</b> <b>for</b> film festivals and probably another <b>cut</b> <b>for</b> international release.|$|R
5|$|While Clinton {{had a solid}} base {{of support}} in New York City, {{candidates}} and observers expected the race to be decided in upstate New York where 45 percent of the state's voters live. During the campaign, Clinton vowed to improve the economic picture in upstate New York, promising that her plan would deliver 200,000 New York jobs over six years. Her plan included specific tax credits {{with the purpose of}} rewarding job creation and encouraging business investment, especially in the high-tech sector. She called for targeted personal tax <b>cuts</b> <b>for</b> college tuition and long-term care.|$|E
5|$|After taking office, Booker voluntarily reduced his own salary twice, {{reducing}} {{his salary}} by 8% {{early in his}} first year as mayor. He also raised the salaries of many city workers. However, his administration imposed one-day-a-month furloughs for all non-uniformed employees from July through December 2010, as well as 2% pay <b>cuts</b> <b>for</b> managers and directors earning more than $100,000 a year. In 2008 and 2009 the City of Newark received the Government Finance Officers Association's Distinguished Budget Presentation Award. In an effort to make government more accessible, Booker held regular open office hours during which city residents can meet with him personally to discuss their concerns. In 2010, Booker was among the finalists for the World Mayor prize, ultimately placing seventh. He was an unsuccessful candidate for the 2012 award.|$|E
5|$|By Sesame Streets 40th anniversary, it {{was ranked}} the fifteenth most popular children's show on television. When the show premiered in 1969, 130 episodes a year were produced; in 2009, because of rising costs, twenty-six episodes were made. In 2000, the Children's Television Workshop, which had {{changed its name}} to the Sesame Workshop (SW) in June 2000 to better reflect its entry into non-television and {{interactive}} media, launched a website with a library of free video clips and free podcasts from throughout the show's history. The 2008–2009 recession, which led to budget <b>cuts</b> <b>for</b> many nonprofit arts organizations, severely affected Sesame Street; in spring 2009, the SW had to lay off 20% of its staff.|$|E

5|$|In {{the first}} ballot on November 2, 2004, Boustany and Mount {{garnered}} the most votes; Cravins {{was defeated by}} less than two thousand votes. As both fell short of a majority, a second ballot was mandated. In the subsequent campaign, Mount criticized Boustany for favoring tax <b>cuts</b> <b>for</b> the rich and being indifferent to health care, while Boustany rejected the attacks as false and stressed his willingness to work with Democrats and Independents. Boustany in turn portrayed Mount as liberal and favoring tax increases. Mount criticized Boustany for favoring the privatization of social security, an unpopular position in Louisiana, and as distant from the interests of individual voters. She received endorsements from U.S. Senator John Breaux, who had represented the 7th district for over fourteen years, and Governor Kathleen Blanco. Boustany was helped by Vice President Dick Cheney, who campaigned on his behalf in Lake Charles. Mount, however, was not endorsed by Democratic primary opponent Don Cravins, who complained about the state Democratic Party's endorsement of Mount in a partially party funded mailer that excluded him and which he believed contributed to his narrow loss. Cravins prepared a suit in federal court claiming that the state Democratic Party violated the Voting Rights Act.|$|E
5|$|The poor demand {{resulted}} in price <b>cuts</b> <b>for</b> various Windows RT products; in April 2013 {{the price of}} Dell's XPS 10 fell from US$450 US to $300, and Microsoft began offering free covers for its Surface tablet in some territories as a limited-time promotion—itself a US$130 value for the Type Cover alone. Microsoft also reportedly reduced the cost of Windows RT licenses for devices with smaller screens, hoping that this could spur interest in the platform. In July 2013, Microsoft cut {{the price of the}} first-generation Surface worldwide by 30%, with its U.S. price falling to $350. Concurrently, Microsoft reported a loss of US$900 million due to the lackluster sales of the device. In August 2013, Dell silently pulled the option to purchase the XPS 10 from its online store without a keyboard dock (raising its price back up to US$479), and pulled the device entirely in September 2013. Microsoft's discount on the Surface tablet did result in a slight increase of market share for the device; in late-August 2013, usage data from the advertising network AdDuplex (which provides advertising services within Windows Store apps) revealed that Surface usage had increased from 6.2 to 9.8%.|$|E
5|$|Yet {{again in}} Spring 1992, the CSU and UC systems were facing {{another round of}} severe budget cuts and {{dramatic}} student fee increases by the state government. Still a second time, SDSU President Thomas Day took the same deep and narrow approach for budget <b>cuts</b> <b>for</b> SDSU, but this time proposed elimination of not only full time faculty professors, but of entire majors such as Aerospace Engineering. In and attempt to alleviate fears of students in those majors, a large meeting by President Day was planned in the student center with hundreds of students and teachers. However, meeting quickly turned angry and chaotic with an overcapacity crowd pressing against the glass windows outside. Following the meeting, students feeling betrayed a 2nd time after 1991, about a dozen students held a temporary occupation of President Day's office. This occupation led to a 24 hour vigil {{in front of the}} Administration building, summer student bus trips to the state legislature in Sacramento, large campus student voter registration drive, and further student marches and protests in the Fall 1992. Under heavy student, teacher, and public pressure, the conclusion of these events ended with CSU Chancellor Barry Munitz eventually reversing President Day's deep and narrow approach, saving the majors and programs in Fall 1992.|$|E
