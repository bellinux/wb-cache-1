5000|$|The ropewalk at Chatham Dockyard (as {{part of the}} Ropery or Ropehouse) {{is still}} {{producing}} rope commercially and has an internal length of 1,135 ft (346 m). When it was constructed in 1790, it was the longest brick building in Europe. Before steam power was introduced in 1836, it took over 200 men to form and close a 20-inch (circumference) <b>cable</b> <b>laid</b> <b>rope.</b> [...] The rope walk is used to form and close the rope, these being the final stages in rope making. Before this the raw hemp, manila hemp or sisal has to be , spun into yarn, and tarred.|$|E
50|$|The shroud knot is a {{multi-strand}} {{bend knot}} used to join two ends of <b>laid</b> (or twisted) <b>rope</b> together. Shroud knots, in general, are {{a class of}} knots {{in which the individual}} strands of <b>laid</b> <b>rope</b> are knotted, but not woven, to the individual strands of another <b>laid</b> <b>rope.</b> This makes them more secure than a simple bend but less secure than a full splice.|$|R

50|$|A {{submarine}} communications {{cable is}} a <b>cable</b> <b>laid</b> {{on the sea}} bed between land-based stations to carry telecommunication signals across stretches of ocean. The first submarine communications <b>cables,</b> <b>laid</b> in the 1850s, carried telegraphy traffic. Subsequent generations of cables carried telephone traffic, then data communications traffic. Modern cables use optical fiber technology to carry digital data, which includes telephone, Internet and private data traffic.|$|R

50|$|The Ambrose Channel pilot cable, {{also called}} the Ambrose Channel leader cable, was a <b>cable</b> <b>laid</b> in Ambrose Channel at the {{entrance}} to the Port of New York and New Jersey that provided an audio tone for guiding ships in and out of port at times of low visibility.

40|$|Abstract. This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the development of techniques to the calculation of the thermal equivalent circuit parameters for the high-voltage <b>cable</b> line <b>laid</b> in the ground. The topology of the scheme was developed in author’s previous publication. This article discusses the parameters of the circuit which simulate the environment of the cable line. Calculation techniques of these parameters are described for <b>cables</b> <b>laid</b> in a plane and a trefoil pattern. The proposed scheme allows one to predict heating of cables on the day ahead in order to prevent thermal degradation of the insulation...|$|R
50|$|This HVDC-link is 73 km long in route, with 70 km {{between the}} two ends. The undersea section {{consists}} of eight 46 km long 270 kV submarine <b>cables,</b> <b>laid</b> between Folkestone (UK) and Sangatte (France), arranged as two fully independent 1,000 MW Bipoles, each operated at a DC voltage of ±270 kV. <b>Cables</b> are <b>laid</b> in pairs in four trenches so that the magnetic fields generated by the two conductors are largely cancelled. The landside parts of the link consist of 8 cables with lengths of 18.5 km in England, and 6.35 km in France.|$|R
5000|$|One {{property}} of <b>laid</b> <b>rope</b> is partial untwisting when used. This can cause spinning of suspended loads, or stretching, , or [...] {{of the rope}} itself. An additional drawback of twisted construction is that every fibre is exposed to abrasion numerous times {{along the length of}} the rope. This means that the rope can degrade to numerous inch-long fibre fragments, which is not easily detected visually.|$|R
50|$|In the 1950s, the RAN {{degaussing}} {{station was}} constructed over {{part of the}} Steel Point fortification. The degaussing station was a countermeasure against magnetic mines. Shark Island was {{used for this purpose}} during World War II. Naval ships would pass over <b>cables</b> <b>laid</b> under the harbour and were effectively demagnetized.|$|R

50|$|A trigger <b>cable</b> was <b>laid</b> {{across a}} road, when enough {{pressure}} {{was applied to}} the trigger cable two conductors inside the cable were forced together closing a circuit. The trigger cable consisted of two segments, requiring simultaneous pressure on both segments to trigger the mine. For wheeled vehicles, the <b>cable</b> was <b>laid</b> directly across the road so that wheels {{on both sides of the}} vehicle would touch the cable at the same instance, while for tracked vehicles the <b>cable</b> was <b>laid</b> at an angle of fifteen degrees to prevent the cable slipping between the treads on the tracks.|$|R

50|$|A {{year after}} the station came into operation, NESCo's {{original}} power station at Pandon Dene was closed and converted into a substation. The Pandon Dene station had originally supplied Newcastle city centre with electricity, but the new Neptune Bank station took over this supply, transmitting using high voltage <b>cables</b> <b>laid</b> in ducts, rendering the older station obsolete.|$|R
50|$|Allied defences at Jitra {{were not}} {{complete}} when the Pacific War broke out. Barbed wire lines had been erected and some anti-tank mines laid but heavy rains had flooded the shallow trenches and gun pits.

5000|$|HAW-1 (Hawaii No. 1) was {{the first}} {{submarine}} telephone <b>cable</b> <b>laid</b> between Hawaii and the mainland United States. HAW-1 was laid in 1957, and consisted of two cables, (one transmitting in each direction), each carrying 36 channels, with an individual length of 2,625 Nmi (4,862 km) each. The cable originates in Hanauma Bay, Oahu, Hawaii and lands at Point Arena, California.|$|R
40|$|CD-ROM includedCableAmp, a Windows based {{software}} {{has been}} developed to calculate the cable ampacity of medium voltage power <b>cables</b> <b>laid</b> in free air or directly buried in the ground. The highly graphical user interface allows easy usage. The user inputs the required data of the cable design {{as well as the}} cable installation method. CableAmp then calculates the continuous current rating (at 100 % load factor) of the power <b>cables</b> <b>laid</b> in free air or directly buried in the ground. It is applicable to extruded solid insulation, rated from 6 kV to 33 kV. An increased peak current rating, called the cyclic current rating, can also be obtained from the software package for a specified load profile. The calculation procedure is in accordance with International Standard IliC 287. The report presents the theory for the software, and also validates the results obtained b> the software by comparison with manufacturers current ratings for standard cables...|$|R
