40|$|European {{estuaries}} {{are characterized}} by high loads of nutrients and organic matter. They have therefore the potential to sustain high primary production rates as well as high bacterial activity, with the balance often tipping towards a net heterotrophic ecosystem (respiration exceeds primary production). Organic matter that is imported from upstream reaches and terrestrial origins is considered allochthonous, while organic matter derived from local, estuarine primary production is autochthonous. The ecological focus of this thesis is on the balance between autochthonous and allochthonous organic carbon sources for secondary production. Mesozooplankton, mostly comprising small crustaceans and larval stages of larger organisms between 0. 2 and 2 mm length, are an important link in the aquatic food <b>chain,</b> <b>grazing</b> smaller size fractions and serving as food for larger animals, including fish. We studied the contribution of autochthonous versus allochthonous food sources for mesozoo- plankton biomass in the Scheldt Estuary, Belgium and the Netherlands (chapter 4). Bacteria use dissolved organic matter (DOM) {{as a source of}} energy and biomass. They have the choice between allochthonous DOM, which is present in high concentrations but is rather refractory, and autochthonous DOM, which has a higher turnover rate and includes many compounds that are readily available for bacterial consumption, but whose concentration is lower and more variable. We studied interactions between bacteria and algae, the producers of autochthonous DOM, in two European estuaries: the Scheldt Estuary, the Netherlands (chapter 6), and Randers Fjord, Denmark (chapter 5). Besides the ecological aspect of the thesis, focusing on the microbial food web of estuaries, substantial effort has been put into the development of statistical and modeling techniques and their application in an ecological context. Bayesian statistics are fairly new to ecology, and have potential for parameter estimation, especially in non-linear models. They have been applied to simple food web models in the Scheldt Estuary (chapter 6), and formed the basis for two methodological chapters. Chapter 2 discusses a method to sample parameter distributions in underdetermined, linear systems, a type of models that is often encountered in food web ecology. Chapter 3 offers a Bayesian alternative to existing techniques that estimate taxonomic composition in ecological samples from molecular biomarkers, such as pigments or fatty acids. Stable isotopes of C and N have {{a central role in the}} unraveling of the estuarine microbial food web. Stable isotope ratios in different food web components are strong indicators for the origin of organic matter, based on the fact that the isotopic signature of allochthonous and autochthonous organic matter is significantly different (chapter 4). When this is not the case, or when one wants to study in detail short-term interactions between food web compartments, stable isotopes can be added deliberately to an experimental setup and food web fluxes can be derived from stable isotope incorporation into different food web components. We measured 13 C concentration in polar lipid-derived fatty acids (PLFA) using gas chromatography - combustion - isotope ratio mass spectrometry (GC-c-IRMS). The isotope composition of algae- or bacteria-specific PLFA can be used as a proxy for the isotopic composition of algae and bacteria, respectively, thus avoiding the need for physical separation of these groups. Calculations and model fitting have been done partly in FEMME, a FORTRAN environment providing tools for ecological modeling (chapter 5), and partly in R, a free software environment for statistical computing and graphics. The methods developed in the framework of this thesis (chapters 2 and 3) have been published as contributed packages for R, and are available for download on the R website...|$|E

30|$|Many of {{the current}} {{problems}} regarding hydrophobic substances such as polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans (PCDD/Fs; often collectively referred to as ‘dioxins’) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) under the EU Water Framework relate to sediments mostly originating from historical release and contamination (Nizzetto et al. [25]). PCDD/Fs, PCBs, and other mainly sediment-bound pollutants are migrating together with the sediments downstream and may overtime dominate the pollution load in downstream reaches (Verta et al. [26]). The impacts of sediment-bound pollutants are particularly aggravated during storm events, when these deposits may be mobilized (Wölz et al. [27]; Weber et al. [28]). In addition to increased exposure of aquatic organisms, such as fishes, these sediments can also be transferred to floodplains where they can contaminate the food <b>chain</b> via <b>grazing</b> cattle (Lake et al.

Lake Cilala has various genera of phytoplankton and zooplankton, 8 genera of benthos, 5 genera of aquatic plants, and 12 fish species including planktivore, herbivore, and carnivore fishes. Those organisms established food <b>chains,</b> by <b>grazing</b> and detritus food chain.

40|$|Chain {{formation}} is common among phytoplankton organisms but the underlying reasons and consequences are poorly understood. Here {{we show that}} chain {{formation is}} strongly impaired by waterborne cues from copepod grazers in the dinoflagellate Alexandrium tamarense. Chains of Alexandrium cells exposed to copepod cues responded by splitting into single cells or shorter chains. Motion analysis revealed significantly lower swimming velocities for single cells compared with chains, with two- to fivefold higher simulated predator encounter rates for two- and four-cell chains, respectively. In addition, the few remaining two-cell <b>chains</b> in <b>grazed</b> treatments were swimming at approximately half the speed of two-cell chains in treatments without grazers, which reduced encounter rates with grazers to values {{similar to that of}} single cells. Chain length plasticity and swimming behavior constitute unique mechanisms to reduce encounters with grazers. We argue that dinoflagellates can regulate the balance between motility and predator avoidance by adjusting chain length. The high predator encounter rate for motile chains {{may have contributed to the}} low prevalence of chain formation in motile phytoplankton compared with in nonmotile phytoplankton where chain formation is more common...|$|R
40|$|Forage base {{is a key}} {{concept in}} the matter of {{specific}} and numeric composition reconstruction of large herbivores.

Comparison of the established for-age reserve with their potential amount of intake by the large herbivorous testifies that forage reserves in the course of hoofed animals activity will steadily decrease.

40|$|We {{monitored}} the kinetics of grazer-induced {{responses in the}} marine dinoflagellate Alexandrium tamarense. Chemical cues from each of three calanoid copepods (Calanus sp., Centropages typicus, and Acartia induced increased toxicity and suppressed chain formation in A. tamarense. Both chemical and morphological responses augmented over 3 Toxicity subsequently averaged 299 % higher than controls, and average biovolume 24 % lower than controls because of suppression of <b>chain</b> formation in <b>grazed</b> treatments. Grazer-induced toxicity returned to control levels after approximately 11 d, equivalent to five cell divisions, and average biovolume returned to control levels within 1 4 d (one to two cell divisions). This suggests that dinoflagellates simultaneously reduce grazer encounter rates and increase chemical defense levels {{in the presence of}} copepod grazers. Media replacement experiments showed that the inducing cue(s) attenuate rapidly in seawater, which allows A. tamarense to adjust resource allocation to grazer-induced responses to follow fluctuations in grazer density. Grazer-induced responses, however, develop too slowly to be accounted for in short-term grazing experiments with laboratory cultures...|$|R

In this study, we measured PAH concentrations in grass exposed for 30 days and for 75 days using a standardised culture of Lolium perenne. This method allowed the comparison of the grass contamination between two sites of different daily traffic (highway and rural road) and two control sites: isolated pasture and climate chamber. The results showed that total PAH concentrations ranged from 18 ng/g DW to 414 ng/g DW (DW: dry weight). The highest concentration was detected along the rural road and appeared not to be directly linked to the vehicular flow but probably to the driving cycles of the vehicles. The PAH concentrations were not found to be time-dependent as the values remained similar for the ryegrass exposed for 30 days or 75 days...|$|R

40|$|In {{pursuing}} the boundary lubrication tribology of aluminium, we first explore {{the change in}} chain mobility and conformational order of alkylsilane monolayer self-assembled on aluminium surface with different <b>chain</b> length using <b>grazing</b> angle FTIR spectroscopy. In tribology, a point on a surface rubbing against another surface is subjected to contact heating and cooling till next contact. We thus track conformational order as monolayers are subjected to heating and explore reversibility on cooling back. We report here the friction generated in sliding the monolayer against a 2 mm diameter steel ball in a ball on disc arrangement in the 25 – 100 mN load and 1 mm/s velocity under dry conditions. The friction at the commencement of sliding is found to correlate directly with conformational order of the molecule which is varied by changing the chain length and heat treatment temperature. We find this friction to vary linearly with full width half maxima (FWHM) which {{is an expression of}} chain mobility and packing density. The initial coefficient of friction is independent of normal load but the dynamic friction which evolves with sliding is not, although the change in dynamic coefficient of friction with normal load does relate qualitatively with the a priori conformational order of the monolayers...|$|R
40|$|The {{food web}} {{structure}} in some high mountain lakes deviates from the established tendency of high heterotrophic bacteria: phyto-plankton biomass ratios in oligotrophic ecosystems. Thus, the microbial food web in La Caldera Lake is weakly developed, and bacteria constitute a minor {{component of the}} plankton community in terms of abundance, biomass and production. Autotrophic picoplankton is absent, and heterotrophic microbial food web is weakly developed compared to a <b>grazing</b> <b>chain</b> dominated by calanoid copepods and a phytoplankton community mainly composed of mixotrophic flagellates. In order to explain the singular food web structure of this lake, functional, stoichiometric and taxonomical approaches are followed to assess, on various temporal and spatial scales, the relevance of stressful abiotic factors (ultraviolet solar radiation and P-limitation) on the structure and func-tioning of this ecosystem. P-availability was the main factor controlling the algal biomass whereas bacterial P- limitation was a transient phenomenon. The algae-bacteria relationship was predominately commensalistic. In contrast to algae, full-sunlight radiation had no negative effect on bacterial growth but rather enhanced bacterial dependence on the carbon released by algae. The prevalence of the commensalistic-mutualistic relationship {{and the development of}} a more complex microbial food web were related to the stoichiometry of algae and bacteria (N:P ratios). The microbial food web only developed at balanced algal and bac-terial N:P ratios, with the appearance of ciliates after a nutrient pulse. However, mixotrophic algae dominated the planktonic com-munity under P-deficit conditions, and they were the main factor controlling bacterioplankton. Their regulatory effect has a dua...|$|R
40|$|Phosphorus (P) {{fertiliser}}s, {{which are}} the main fertiliser input for the economic production of legume-based pastures, are the largest source of F enrichment for pastoral soils. Excessive levels of soil fluorine (F) can result in adverse effects for soil quality, livestock health and food safety. The majority of fertiliser F applied to pastures continues to accumulate in the biologically active topsoil due to strong adsorption to soil constituents. Fluorine adsorption in soils increases with increased contents of iron and aluminium oxides, layer silicates and allophane in soils and increased soil pH. In most pastoral soils with near-neutral pH, the majority of F added in fertilisers remain in the topsoil and little moves below a depth of 20 - 30 cm and therefore is unlikely to contaminate ground waters. However, F may pose a risk to shallow ground waters in very acidic low P-fixing soils. Research is required both to test whether ground waters beneath farms (with long histories of P fertiliser use) are contaminated by F and also to examine the mechanisms of its movement. Fluorine intake by grazing livestock is mostly by soil ingestion. Ingestion of soil F with elevated F concentrations can result in chronic fluorosis in sheep and cattle. Reducing soil ingestion by maintaining good pasture cover especially during winter periods can reduce F accumulation in livestock. In grazing livestock, F accumulates mainly in bones and horns and not in products that enter the human food <b>chain.</b> Thus the <b>grazing</b> animal filters out excess soil F leaving animal products, such as milk and meat, with low F concentrations and low impact on food safety...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} thesis {{deals with}} uptake, accumulation and transformation of arsenic and selenium in plants growing on soils with different chemico-physical soil properties. The contents of arsenic were investigated in 99 wild plant species, coming from 27 different families and 6 different vegetables growing in arsenic contaminated soils. The {{results suggest that}} there are species-specific mechanisms which protects certain plants from the excessive uptake of arsenic from the soil. On the other hand, there are plants using a strategy of accumulation, which theoretically may increase the risk of arsenic entry into the food <b>chain,</b> whether through <b>grazing</b> cattle and wildlife or through consumption of vegetables growing on arsenic contaminated soils. The most prevalent arsenic compounds are AsV and AsIII. Other arsenic compounds occure as minor species. An important finding was detection of arsenobetaine in Plantago lanceolata L. and Carex praecox Schreb [...] The contents of selenium were examined in 73 species of wild plants, coming from 29 different families. The results suggest that naturally low levels of selenium in the soil of selected locations along with a low capability of selenium uptake via collected plant species lead to the low content of selenium in plant biomass which may contribute to selenium deficient throughout the food chain. Foliar application of selenate on wild plant communities and on some types of vegetables in our case Brassica oleracea var. italica can {{have a positive impact on}} increasing the selenium content in the aboveground biomass of these plants and by extension, increase the selenium content in the human diet.

40|$|The {{impacts of}} natural {{atmospheric}} variability and {{anthropogenic climate change}} on the spatial distribution, seasonality, structure, and productivity of North Pacific plankton groups are investigated {{by means of an}} Earth System Model (ESM) that contains a plankton model with variable stoichiometry. The ESM is forced with observed greenhouse gases for the 20 th century and with the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change A 1 B Emission Scenario for the 21 st century. The impacts of the two main modes of variability – connected with the Aleutian Low (AL) strength and with the North Pacific Oscillation (NPO) – are considered. When the AL is strong, primary productivity and chlorophyll concentrations are higher in the central Pacific, the seasonality of plankton is enhanced, and the classical <b>grazing</b> <b>chain</b> is stimulated, whereas in the Alaskan Gyre the model simulates a chlorophyll decrease and a shift toward smaller phytoplankton species. A stronger NPO increases productivity and chlorophyll concentration at ∼ 45 °N. In the anthropogenic climate change scenario, simulated sea surface temperature is 4 °C higher with respect to contemporary conditions, leading to reduced mixing and nutrient supply at middle-subpolar latitudes. The seasonal phytoplankton bloom is reduced and occurs one month earlier, the flow of carbon to the microbial loop is enhanced, and phytoplanktonic stoichiometry is nutrient-depleted. Primary productivity is enhanced at subpolar latitudes, due to increased ice-free regions and possibly to temperature-related photosynthesis stimulation. This study highlights that natural climate variability may act alternatively to strengthen or to weaken the human-induced impacts, and that in the next decades {{it will be difficult to}} distinguish between internal and external climate forcing on North Pacific plankton groups. Highlights ► A plankton model with variable stoichiometry has been used in a coupled climate study. ► Natural climate variations modify North Pacific plankton biomass by 10 – 30...|$|R
40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to 1) determine the effects of livestock grazing and periods of rest from grazing on infiltration and erosion rates of unchained woodland; chained, debris-in-place; and chained, debris-windrowed pinyon-juniper sites; and 2) utilize these measurements in developing guidelines for grazing management of pinyonjuniper rangelands that protect or improve the hydrologic condition of the watershed. The study was conducted on sandy loam soils in southeastern Utah during the summers of 1971 and 1972. Runoff and erosion were artificially induced from small plots by simulating rainfall with the Rocky Mountain infiltrometer. Infiltration rates, erosion rates, and selected vegetative and edaphic parameters were measured on each plot. Forage removal by clipping and soil compaction subtreatments were applied to randomly selected plots in an effort to simulate the forage removal and trampling activities of livestock. Analysis of variance techniques were used to determine the effect on infiltration and erosion rates of forage removal and soil compaction subtreatment, grazing and varying periods of rest from <b>grazing,</b> and <b>chaining</b> treatments with similar grazing histories. Multiple regression techniques were used to evaluate the influence of vegetative and edaphic factors on infiltration and erosion. Forage removal and soil compaction subtreatments had no consistent effect on infiltration rates. However, the clipping and compaction subtreatments were an instantaneous application of forage removal and soil pressure and thus may not adequately represent long term, accumulative conditions imposed by actual grazing. Areas rested from livestock grazing since 1967 had significantly higher infiltration rates than grazed areas on unchained woodland and <b>chained,</b> debris-in-place sites. <b>Grazed</b> plots consistently had the lowest infiltration rates although this lower rate was not significantly different from infiltration rates measured on areas protected from grazing since 1969 or 1971. Grazing did not consistently affect infiltration measured on chained, debris-windrowed sites. Infiltration rates increased on all three vegetative conditions as the period of rest from grazing increased. None of the 21 soil and vegetative variables included in this study were identified by multiple regression models as consistently explaining significant amounts of variation in infiltration rates. Results {{of this study indicate that}} the primary value of multiple regression models is not to predict changes that will occur in infiltration because one management alternative is selected over another, but to help explain significant differences measured between treatments. Erosion rates were not significantly affected by forage removal subtreatments, but a trend indicates that erosion increases on plots when above ground vegetation is removed by clipping. No consistent relationship between -erosion rates and soil compaction subtreatments was found. A trend toward increased erosion rates on grazed areas was found. No consistent relationship between erosion rates and the various periods of rest from grazing was recorded. Thus, any rest from grazing appears to reduce the erosion potential from pinyonjuniper sites. In summary, pinyon-juniper rangelands can be improved for livestock by chaining and seeding without causing a deterioration in watershed condition. However, to achieve these objectives, the sites to be treated must be carefully evaluated and the appropriate chaining, plant debris disposal, and seeding techniques identified. And following vegetative conversion, the areas must be properly grazed...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (MSc (Environmental Sciences)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2012. The Wonderfonteinspruit (WFS) {{flows through}} the richest gold mining region {{in the world and}} has {{subsequently}} been exposed to the related pollution for more than a century. In order {{to determine the extent of}} mining related pollution in the WFS, sediment, water, soil, grass and cattle tissue samples were collected, analysed and compared from an experimental group and a control group. This study identified cobalt, nickel, zinc, selenium, cadmium, gold, lead and uranium as elements of interest by comparing sediment samples from the WFS and the Mooi River (MR) (which served as a control or background site). The cobalt concentration was found to be 16. 37 times higher, the nickel concentration was 30. 4 times higher, the copper concentration was 3. 59 times higher, the zinc concentration was 103. 49 times higher, the selenium concentration was 7. 14 times higher, the cadmium concentration was 17. 88 times higher, the gold concentration was 4. 78 times higher, the lead concentration was 1. 32 times higher and the uranium concentration was 375. 78 times higher in the initial comparison with sediments from the MR. These results were all found to be significant. All these elements are by products of non-ferrous mining activities as was described in the literature review. The elevated concentrations of these elements, which were found in the streambed sediment of a site in the Lower-Wonderfonteinspruit, suggest that they could have resulted due to upstream gold mining activities. These gold mining activities were initiated more than a century ago and continue to this day. Analysis of the different particle size fractions (sand, silt and clay fractions) revealed that the highest elemental concentrations were found in the clay sized fractions. The clay sized fraction usually contains secondary soil minerals which have the ability to adsorb dissolved cations onto their surface areas. Further analysis revealed that the sand fraction of the WFS sediment contained a substantial concentration of cobalt, nickel, copper, zinc, lead and uranium which, upon initial inspection could not be explained. X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) analysis revealed that more than 90 % of the WFS sand, silt and clay fractions consisted of quartz, which was much higher than that of the MR. Due to the particle size of quartz, it generally dominates the sand and silt fractions, and finding it at levels above 90 % in the clay sized fraction is thought to be highly irregular. This could be explained by the extraction and processing of gold reefs from the goldfields in the catchment. The gold reefs consisted of quartz veins that were milled to a fine dust and pumped onto slime and sand dumps after the gold was extracted. The most abundant ore minerals found within these dumps were uraninite(UO 2), brannerite (UO 3 Ti 2 O 4), arsenopyrite (FeAsS), cobaltite (CoAsS), galena (PbS), pyrrhotite (FeS), gersdofite (NiAsS) and chromite (FeCr 2 O 4), which contain some of the elements of interest. These dumps are either located in close proximity to the WFS or connected to the WFs via canals or pipelines. Erosion of these dumps would then introduce this finely milled quartz into the stream system. Therefore, the elements found in the sediment of the WFS were not only introduced to the system in the dissolved form, but also in the particulate form. The water samples that were collected from the experimental site (WFS) were found to exceed the cobalt, nickel, copper, zinc, selenium and cadmium concentrations ranges which are normally found in natural waters. In addition to this, the cadmium, lead and nickel concentration in the WFS water samples were found to occasionally exceed the target water quality ranges for livestock water as set by DWAF (1996). Water samples that were collected from the control group were found to exceed only the selenium concentration found in natural water sources as found by Crittenden et al., (2005). Cattle in the experimental group drink directly from the WFS and may stir up the sediment and thereby increasing the elemental concentrations within the water prior to ingestion. The target water quality ranges (TWQR) for livestock watering, as set by DWAF 1996, were exceeded by the average nickel and lead concentrations found in the disturbed WFS water samples. Although the elemental concentrations in the respective water samples were fairly low there was a definite practical significant difference between the WFS water and the MR water samples, as well as the disturbed WFS water and the MR water samples. The WFS water quality seemed to have a very large standard deviation which could serve as an indication that the elemental concentrations are highly variable over time. The elemental concentrations that were found in soil samples from the respective sites were compared to elemental concentrations found in normal agricultural soil as presented by Bergman (1992), which revealed the following results. The cobalt concentrations in the soil samples from the soil along WFS site, soil along MR site and irrigation MR site exceeded the agricultural threshold value. The nickel concentrations in the soil samples from the soil along WFS site, soil along MR site, wetland WFS and irrigation MR site exceeded the agricultural threshold value. The zinc concentrations in the soil samples from the soil along WFS site exceeded the agricultural threshold value. Copper, selenium, cadmium and lead concentrations did not exceed the agricultural threshold values in any of the respective sites. The agricultural threshold value for uranium concentrations was exceeded in the soil samples from the soil along the WFS site and the wetland WFS site. The comparison between the elemental concentrations that were found in the soil samples from the irrigated soil WFS site and the irrigated soil MR site revealed a practically significant difference for the copper, zinc and uranium concentrations. The comparison between the elemental concentrations found in soil samples from the soil along the WFS site and the soil along the MR site revealed a practically significant difference for all elements of interest. The analysis of the elemental concentration in the different particle size fractions of soil samples from all the sites (excluding the irrigated pastures) displayed highest elemental concentrations in the clay sized fraction. The elemental concentrations that were found in this fraction are generally considered to be available for plant uptake, as most of them are usually bound to the surface of secondary soil minerals. The sites with the highest concentration of plant available elements were found to be the soil along WFS site and the wetland WFS site. The elemental concentrations found in the grass samples from the respective sampling sites were compared to elemental concentrations that are normally found in grass pastures (Underwood & Suttle, 2001). The cobalt, nickel, copper and concentrations that were found in the grass samples from most of the sites in both the control and experimental groups were all found to exceed the concentration ranges found in natural pastures. The cadmium and zinc concentrations in the grass samples from the soil along WFS site were found to exceed the respective concentration ranges found in natural pastures. The normal uranium concentration found in irrigated or natural grasses could not be found in an extensive search. Dreesen et al. (1982) reported 0. 16 mg/kg uranium in grasses and 1. 8 mg/kg uranium in shrubs that grew on soil-covered tailings material. All the sites in the experimental group, including the control WFS site, drastically exceeded these concentrations, which may suggest that the grasses in the experimental sites have been exposed to elevated uranium concentrations. The grass samples with the highest average elemental concentrations were found in the soil along WFS site and irrigated soil WFS site. Lead was to be the only element of interest to have the highest concentration in grass samples from the irrigated soil WFS site. The irrigated soil WFS site portrayed significant transfer factors for nickel, copper, zinc, lead and uranium. This could serve as an indication that the grasses under irrigation in the WFS site absorb and accumulate the highest concentration of elements in respect to the soil concentrations found in the various sites. Therefore, the irrigation from the WFS has a profound effect on the nickel, copper, zinc, lead and uranium concentration in the grass samples under irrigation. The results obtained from the comparative analysis of the elemental concentration in grass samples from the irrigation WFS and irrigation MR sites revealed that all elemental concentrations except for that of zinc had a difference that was practically significant, with the uranium concentration having the largest effect size. The results obtained from the comparative analysis of the elemental concentration in grass samples from the soil along WFS and soil along MR sites revealed that all elemental concentrations had a difference that was practically significant uranium, nickel and zinc concentrations having the largest effect sizes. Considering that a large effect size is achieved at a value equal to or greater than 0. 8, the uranium concentration therefore had a massive difference in both comparisons. The results obtained from the comparative analysis of the elemental concentration in grass samples from the wetland WFS and control WFS sites revealed that only the cobalt, nickel and uranium concentrations had differences that were practically significant, with the cobalt concentration having the largest effect size. The results obtained from the comparative analysis of the elemental concentration in the grass samples from the soil along WFS and control WFS sites revealed that all the elemental concentrations except for the lead concentration had a difference that was practically significant. The cobalt, nickel and zinc had the largest effect sizes. The elemental concentrations that were found in cattle liver, kidney and muscle tissue samples from both the experimental and control groups were compared to elemental concentrations normally found in cattle samples as found in Pulse (1994), ATSDR (2004), and ATSDR (2011). This comparison revealed the following results: The nickel, cadmium and lead concentration that were found in the cattle liver, kidney and muscle tissue samples from both the experimental and control groups were found to be within the ranges normally found in cattle. Cobalt concentrations found in the liver and muscle tissue samples of cattle from both the experimental and control groups exceeded the normal ranges, and the cobalt concentrations found in the kidney samples from the experimental group exceeded the normal range. The copper concentration found in the kidney samples from the cattle in the experimental group exceeded that of the normal concentration range. The zinc concentration found in the liver and kidney samples in the cattle from the experimental group, and the kidney samples from the cattle in the control group exceeded the normal range. The selenium concentration found in the liver, kidney and muscle tissue samples in the cattle from the experimental group, and the kidney samples from the cattle in the control group exceeded the normal range. The uranium concentration found in the liver, kidney and muscle tissue samples in the cattle from the experimental group exceeded the normal range. The comparison between cattle tissue samples from the experimental and control group revealed that nickel, zinc, selenium, lead and uranium concentrations all reveal a practically significant difference. Uranium, nickel and lead portrayed the largest differences between the two groups. The uranium concentration in the cattle samples from the experimental group was 126. 75 times higher in the liver, 4350 times higher in the kidney, 47. 75 times higher in the spleen, 31. 6 times higher in the muscle tissue, 60 times higher in the bone and 129 times higher in the hair than that of the cattle samples from the control group. In addition to this, the uranium did not only accumulate in the predicted tissue samples (bone, liver and kidney), but also in the muscle tissue samples. The nickel concentrations in the cattle samples were all found to be higher in the experimental group, with liver 1. 4 times higher, kidney 387. 5 times higher, spleen 2. 1 times higher, muscle tissue 2. 8 times higher, bone 167. 5 times higher and hair 76. 5 times higher than that of the cattle samples from the control group. The lead concentrations found in the cattle samples from the experimental group were found to be 3. 8 times higher in the liver, 17. 3 times higher in the kidney, 3. 3 times higher in the spleen, 3. 2 times higher in the muscle tissue, 9 times higher in the bone and 12. 2 times higher in the hair than the cattle samples from the control group. Furthermore, the study revealed that the major route of ingestion for all the elements of interest, excluding nickel and cobalt was via the ingestion of grass. The major route for nickel and cobalt ingestion was via soil ingestion. The elemental concentrations from water ingestion were found to be a less significant. It was shown that a predictive cattle consumption model was developed and calibrated from data gathered from a control and experimental group. Animal matter analysed for both groups were related to the cattle age of six years. Although good correlation between observed and simulated values was achieved, the exiting model fit is non-unique. To obtain a more precise model fit a similar dataset is required for both groups, but at a different age. The predictive model also showed that if only grass were to be used as input, there were no significant changes in the correlation between observed and simulated values. This has a huge advantage in terms of costs associated with laboratory analyses as the analysis of grass will be sufficient for using the model. A human health risk assessment was performed based on the results of the cattle consumption model. It was shown that no toxic risk exits for both the control and experimental groups if an intake rate of 0. 13 kg of meat per day was assumed. Furthermore, Figure 6 - 11 clearly indicates that an intake rate of up to 0. 38 kg of meat per day also has no toxic risk for both groups, which strongly suggests that there is no risk to the human food <b>chain.</b> The cattle <b>grazing</b> in the WFS appear to be in a good physical condition and according to the farmer; the reproduction rate is at desirable levels. Good farming practices would have also played a significant role to achieve this. Master...|$|R
