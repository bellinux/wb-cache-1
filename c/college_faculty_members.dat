500|$|As {{these reforms}} were being carried out, {{questions}} arose {{as to whether}} the decisions were truly made by Tkach himself or by others in the church leadership. The church leadership at that time included Mike Feazell, executive assistant and editorial advisor to Tkach, Greg Albrecht, editor of The Plain Truth, and Joseph Tkach, Jr., the son of Joseph W. Tkach, and church administration director. One conspiracy theory stated that the decisions did not come from Tkach himself but from the church leadership. Another stated that the ideas did originate from Tkach but he formed them early in his career, kept them hidden from Armstrong, and only allowed the ideas to come to fruition after Armstrong's death. Feazell claims that the reforms were initially driven by a re-examination of church literature that was mainly spurred by questions posed by church ministers and members. These examinations were done by Tkach and Feazell, but the final decisions and approval of materials for publication were made by Tkach. By 1990, Tkach authorized the formation of a [...] "Doctrinal Manual Group", consisting of thirteen ministers and Ambassador <b>College</b> <b>faculty</b> <b>members</b> with the mission of assuring doctrinal consistency, refinement, and advice to the Pastor General. Tkach reviewed and made the final decisions on all recommendations made by the group.|$|E

2500|$|This {{can be an}} {{important}} factor in some situations, sometimes a [...] "driving factor", since a college {{may be more likely to}} say yes to a student likely to matriculate. Accordingly, it has been advised to become knowledgeable about schools being applied to, and [...] "tailor each application accordingly." [...] College visits (including overnight ones), interviews, attending College Fair days, comments in the essay, contacting <b>college</b> <b>faculty</b> <b>members,</b> answering and opening emails, place position of the college on the FAFSA form or its FAFSA position, and other indications of interest can be a factor for many colleges concerned about their yield—the percent of students who accept an offer of enrollment. According to Andover's college counseling director Sean Logan, it is important to have numerous contact points with colleges to show demonstrated interest: visiting, phone contact, emailing, visits to websites (including number of clicks as well as length of time on the website), whether a college visit included a tour and interview, and whether a college-recommended off-campus personal interview was done. Schools such as Connecticut College and Emory University have been credited as [...] "popularizing the yield game" [...] by refusing well-qualified students who failed to show much real interest in attending, as a way to boost their yield scores.

5000|$|After {{receiving}} his PhD, Selsam {{served as}} an instructor and later as {{an assistant professor at}} Brooklyn College.
