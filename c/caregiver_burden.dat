25|$|The {{subjective}} {{burden is}} an important factor that influences the passing into the nursing home (institutionalization). Particularly the care of people with dementia is associated with challenging behavior and <b>caregiver</b> <b>burden.</b> Both increases the likelihood of institutionalization. In the care of people with dementia, there is consistent evidence: The higher the <b>caregiver</b> <b>burden,</b> the more likely is the institutionalization.|$|E

40|$|The {{present study}} was {{conducted}} to investigate depression in caregivers of the frail elderly with tumors. Approximately 70 % of caregivers were depressed. This rate was higher than the rates of caregivers of the frail elderly with home-visiting nurse service in our previous studies (47 - 56 %). Compared with lightly <b>burdened</b> <b>caregivers,</b> heavily <b>burdened</b> <b>caregivers</b> were more likely to attend female elderly and the frail elderly who had a greater number of behavioral disturbances. Heavily <b>burdened</b> <b>caregivers</b> were more likely to consult with physicians within one month, to be in ill health and to be depressed than lightly <b>burdened</b> <b>caregivers.</b> They spent more time with the elderly as well as on physical care than lightly <b>burdened</b> <b>caregivers</b> while they had more family members and tended to use more kinds of social services than lightly <b>burdened</b> <b>caregivers.</b> Caregivers of the frail elderly with tumors seem to need more support. Since the role of home-visiting nurses is not only caring for the frail elderly but also supporting family caregivers, they should help caregivers making an informal caregiving network system to reduce their burden...|$|R
40|$|Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a {{developmental}} disorder in children that cannot communicate and express {{their feelings and}} desires so that the behaviour of relationships with others is disrupted.

The result from pearson product moment test showed that there is a strong and positive relationship between burden and stress on autism caregiver (r corelation= 0, 878). These results indicate that the higher <b>caregiver</b> <b>burdens,</b> the higher stress of autism caregiver. Caregivers who have high stress and burden can lead to poor parenting, which can disturb the growth and development of children and worsen the autism severity.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 1991 This {{study was}} {{designed}} to test a model of the effects of selected social factors and caregiving tasks on caregiving outcomes for 100 adult children caring for frail, elderly parents or in-laws. Results are analyzed using path analysis. Social factors included relationship quality, duty, caregiver support upset, and caregiving satisfaction. Caregiving outcomes included <b>caregiver</b> perceived <b>burden,</b> <b>caregiver</b> mental health, and likelihood of nursing home placement. Care-receiver dementia and caregiver income were added during model testing. Both <b>caregiver</b> perceived <b>burden</b> and care-receiver dementia increased likelihood of nursing home placement while duty decreased it. Relationship quality, caregiver support upset, and caregiving tasks indirectly affected likelihood of nursing home placement through their effects on <b>caregiver</b> perceived <b>burden.</b> Relationship quality reduced perceived <b>burden,</b> while <b>caregiver</b> support upset and caregiving tasks increased it. Relationship quality also indirectly reduced the likelihood of nursing home placement by increasing duty. Higher income reduced perceived burden by decreasing caregiving tasks. Caregiver mental health, as measured by the Mental Health Inventory, had no effect on likelihood of nursing home placement when <b>caregiver</b> perceived <b>burden</b> was taken into account. Caregiving satisfaction was shown to be redundant and was dropped from the model. Relationship quality appeared to measure the same underlying construct and had stronger associations with the other variables. That caring for a parent can be burdensome is evidenced by the relatively low scores on the Mental Health Inventory and by the strong association between <b>caregiver</b> perceived <b>burden</b> and mental health. Subjects were also asked whether they were having problems with relatives over caregiving. Forty percent reported experiencing conflict or resentment toward another family member; in the majority of the cases (65 %) the relative was a brother or sister. The most frequently reported source of the problem was lack of sufficient caregiving assistance. Caregivers reporting conflict or resentment evidenced significantly poorer mental health, poorer relationship quality with their care-receivers, higher perceived burden, and {{were more likely to be}} considering nursing home placement for their care-receivers than were those not reporting conflict even when controlling for caregiving tasks. Those having conflict with relatives were also much more likely to prefer alternatives to family care for themselves should they become disabled. This study shows that, with the exception of duty, social factors in caregiving impact likelihood of nursing home placement through their effects on <b>caregiver</b> perceived <b>burden.</b> Family conflict also appears to have an important impact on caregiving outcomes...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: In Japan, the {{prevalence}} of depression {{has been reported to}} occur among 1 in 4 family caregivers. The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate the self-rated burden associated with mental health conditions among caregivers. Methods: We studied 95 caregivers aged 38 - 87 years in a cross-sectional study. The General Health Questionnaire (GHQ- 12) score of 4 or more was defined as poor mental health. Results: The proportion of caregivers with poor mental health was 24 %. Caregivers with a high GHQ- 12 score had the number of <b>caregiver</b> <b>burdens</b> increased by 2. 5 -fold compared to those with a low GHQ- 12 score (p = 0. 001). The proportion of caregivers with a high GHQ- 12 score was significantly higher with an increasing number of behavioral problems among care recipients (p = 0. 003). A mediational model was used to identify the underlying mechanism of the relationship between the number of behavioral problems and poor mental health in caregivers. Consequently, we found that mental health conditions in caregivers were associated with both the number of <b>caregiver</b> <b>burdens</b> and behavioral problems among care recipients. Conclusions: It is vital to provide support not only to the caregivers but also to their elderly relatives, paying particular attention to early identification of poor mental health in caregivers so as to administer effective interventions, and to offer useful advice concerning how to deal with behavioral problems...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Aims of the {{treatment}} of Parkinson's disease and Dementia ar symptoms control, maintaining functionality {{and quality of life}} in both patients and caregivers, as well as preventing the burnout syndrome. Occupational Therapy and education seem to be useful. Aims of the study: Measure the effect of a multidisciplinary intervention in quality of life in both patients and caregivers, {{as well as on the}} <b>caregiver's</b> <b>burden.</b> Materials and Methods: Quasi-experimental study, 29 patients with Parkinson's Disease and/or Dementia, in Vitacura and their caregivers. Quality of life in patients and caregivers was measured with the WHOQOLBREF and SF- 36 questionnaires respectively and the <b>caregivers</b> <b>burden</b> with the Zarit scale. A multidisciplinary intervention was conducted with educational sessions, selfhelp groups and integrative activities, Occupational therapy was carried out at home. Statistical analysis with SPSS® version 17. Results: <b>Caregiver's</b> <b>burden</b> decreased significantly (Mean difference of 22 points Zarit scale, p < 0. 001). No effect on quality of life of patients, except for a 22 % decrease of satisfaction in the domain "social relationships" (p 0. 001). Quality of life of caregivers increased significantly in the domain "Vitality" (p 0. 006), with a trend towards improved satisfaction in the Mental Health Component (p 0. 077). No differences in other domains. Discussion: Education and occupational therapy in the primary care setting contributes to improve vitality, helps to increase satisfaction in mental health of caregivers and alleviates the burden of care. The effect on quality of life of patients seems to be neutral.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Background: The {{purpose of}} this review is to explore how home {{technology}} care affects patients, family caregivers, {{and quality of life}} (QOL). Methods: A literature search was conducted to identify studies of home parenteral nutrition (HPN) and other technology prescribed home care. Results: Technology dependence influences health-related QOL. Patients and their family caregivers must balance the positive aspects of being in the home environment with the challenges of administer-ing complex therapies at home. Patients and caregivers need additional support to reduce the physical, emotional, social, and financial burdens they experience.

40|$|We {{study the}} {{economic}} cost of dementia in Chile, and its variation according to socioeconomic status (SES). We use primary {{data from a}} survey of 330 informal primary caregivers who completed both a RUD-Lite and a socio-demographic questionnaire to evaluate the severity of dementia and <b>caregiver's</b> <b>burden.</b> The costs of dementia are broken into three components: direct medical costs (medical care, drugs, tests); direct social costs (social service, daycare); and indirect costs (mostly associated to informal care). The average monthly cost per patient is estimated at US$ 1, 463. Direct medical costs account for 20 per cent, direct social costs for 5 per cent and indirect costs for 75 per cent of the total cost. The mean monthly cost {{is found to be}} inversely related to SES, a pattern largely driven by indirect costs. The monthly cost for high SES is US$ 1, 083 and US$ 1, 588 for low SES. A multivariate regression analysis suggests that severity of dementia and <b>caregiver's</b> <b>burden</b> account for between 49 and 70 per cent of the difference in the indirect cost across SES. However, between one-third and one-half of the variation across SES is not due to gradient in severity of dementia. Direct medical costs increase in higher SES, reflecting differences in purchasing power, while indirect costs are inversely related to SES and more than compensate differences in medical costs. Moreover, in lower SES groups, female caregivers, typically family members who are inactive in the labor market, mostly provide informal care. The average annual cost of dementia in Chile (US$ 17, 559) is lower in comparison to high-income countries (US$ 39, 595) and the proportion of cost related to informal cost is higher (74 per cent compared to 40 per cent). SES is a key determinant in the cost of dementia. In the absence of universal access to treatment, part of the social cost of dementia potentially preserves or increases income and gender inequality...|$|R
40|$|Personality {{of family}} {{caregiver}} {{is an important}} factor influencing the <b>caregiver's</b> <b>burden,</b> depression and distress. We now hypothesized that the personality is associated with specific strategies used by family caregivers to deal with the behavioral and psychological symptoms of demented relatives (BPSD). Participants were 98 consecutive persons with dementia and their family caregivers. Assessments included: Personality (NEO-FFI), Burden (ZBI), Depression (CES-D), Cognitive Function (MMSE), BPSD (NPI), Distress (NPI-D), and an open question to identify the strategies used by caregivers when faced with BPSD. Caregivers used different strategies to cope with their relatives' behavior: avoiding conflict; confronting; reassuring; orienting; responding coercively; distracting; colluding; medicating and restricting the movements. Extraversion was the only dimension of caregiver's personality that determined the use of caregiver strategies to deal with BPSD. Extroverted caregivers used the "confronting" strategy less often. Caregiver's personality should be taken into account when designing adapted intervention programs...|$|R

40|$|Objectives: Preferences of both Alzheimer {{patients}} and their spouse caregivers are related to a willingness-to-pay (WTP) measure {{which is used to}} test for the presence of mutual (rather than the conventional one-way) altruism. Methods: Identical contingent valuation interviews were conducted in 2000 - 2002 for 126 Alzheimer {{patients and}} their caregiving spouses living in the Zurich metropolitan area (Switzerland). We elicit WTP three hypothetical treatments of the demented patient. The treatment Stabilization prevents the worsening of the disease, bringing dementia to a standstill. Cure restores patient health to its original level. In No burden, dementia takes its normal course while <b>caregiver’s</b> <b>burden</b> is reduced to its level before the disease. Results: Different characteristics of therapies are reflected in differences in WTP values. Accepting WTP values as expression of preferences, one finds that patients do not rank Cure higher than No burden; implying that their WTP is entirely altruistic. Caregiving spouses rank Cure before Burden, some 40 percent of their WTP reflecting an altruistic motive again...|$|R
