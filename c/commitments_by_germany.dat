25|$|As of 2014, many {{detailed}} assessments {{show that}} the energy service needs of a world enjoying radically higher levels of wellbeing, can be economically met entirely through the diverse currently available technological and organisational innovations around wind, solar, biomass, biofuel, hydro, ocean and geothermal energy. Debate over detailed plans remain, but transformations in global energy services based entirely around renewable energy are in principle technically practicable, economically feasible, socially viable, and so realisable. This prospect underpins the ambitious <b>commitment</b> <b>by</b> <b>Germany,</b> one of the world's most successful industrial economies, to undertake a major energy transition, Energiewende.|$|R

40|$|Executive and {{supervisory}} {{boards of}} large companies in Germany are still dominated by men - to an extraordinary degree. Only 2. 5 % of all executive board {{members in the}} 200 largest companies (not including the financial sector) are women, and only 10 % of all seats on supervisory boards are occupied by women. The situation in the financial sector is similar: in the 100 largest banks, 2. 6 % of all executive board members are women, and in the 62 largest insurance companies, 2. 8 % of executive board members are women. The percentage of women on financial sector supervisory boards is higher than their percentage in the top 200 companies: 16. 8 % in banks and savings banks, and 12. 4 % in insurance companies. In total, about three-quarters of women with a seat on a supervisory board are appointed by employee representation bodies and therefore have their seat {{as a result of}} employee codetermination practices. Aside from a few positive examples, the situation on both types of management boards has hardly changed at all in the last few years. It {{remains to be seen whether}} the plan to gradually increase the number of women in management positions, as agreed upon in the German government's 2009 Coalition Agreement, will have more success than the voluntary <b>commitments</b> made <b>by</b> <b>Germany's</b> top business associations in their 2001 agreement with the German government. The implementation of the latter initiative private-sector companies can be considered a failure given the virtually unchanged gender composition of top management in large private-sector companies.
