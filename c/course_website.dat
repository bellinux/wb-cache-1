40|$|We have {{developed}} software for creating databases of course materials on the World-Wide Web. The {{goal is to}} allow instructors at different institutions to share materials and develop them jointly. Our first two databases, in computer architecture and object technology, comprise thousands of problems and lectures downloaded (with permission) from <b>course</b> <b>Websites</b> around the world. The database is searchable by classification or fulltext string. To populate the databases with up-to-date material, we started by building a list of <b>course</b> <b>Websites.</b> Using several sources, {{we came up with}} a list of 73 sites in computer architecture and 40 sites in object technology. However, only a minority of authors gave us permission to load their material.

The search engine that we have used finds <b>course</b> <b>Websites</b> by searching a filtered set of educational domains for sites containing keywords characteristic of course material in the target discipline.

5000|$|JiTT may be {{described}} as a method by which {{some or all of the}} time students spend in preparation for class is used to leverage the quality of the time spent in class. To accomplish this, JiTT relies on pre-class assignments completed by students 1-24 hours before class meetings. These assignments are known variously as [...] "Warmup exercises", [...] "Preflight checks", [...] "Checkpoints", and other names, depending on institutional settings. These assignments are usually completed online, either through a <b>course</b> <b>website,</b> or through a learning management system. The pre-class assignments cover the material that will be introduced in the subsequent class, and should be answered based on students' reading or other preparation. As a result, these assignments provide a strong incentive for students to complete the assigned reading or other preparatory work before class. For this reason, JiTT has been compared to the use of [...] "reading quizzes". However, there are important differences.|$|E
40|$|It is {{no longer}} a {{surprise}} to find that Higher Education is moving into the era of technology at an increasing rate. It has become vital that university instructors adapt instructional methods to include technology. An inventive way of including technology in the course room is by developing a course webpage.

This small-scale humanities study used a quantitative data collection method in order to answer the research questions involving whether <b>course</b> <b>websites</b> enhanced the instructional learning experience of course participants.

40|$|Abstract:- The present {{research}} {{looks at the}} complementary nature of traditional classroom delivery {{with the use of}} Internet as supporting material. Data was collected from second year business management students who are required to use the <b>course</b> <b>website</b> for their business research methods class. We used the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) developed by [1] as the model for investigating the usage of the <b>course</b> <b>website.</b> TAM proposes that perceived usefulness (PU) and perceived ease of use (PEU) are key determinants of usage of a particular technology or system. The regression analysis results indicate that the two constructs were able to explain 49 % of the variation in the usage of the <b>course</b> <b>website.</b> Perceived usefulness (β = 0. 423, p< 0. 01) was the more influential predictor of usage with perceived ease of use (β = 0. 371, p< 0. 01) also significant. Perceived ease of use was also positively related to perceived usefulness of the <b>course</b> <b>website.</b> Thus we can conclude that TAM is a valid model {{that can be used to}} explain usage of a <b>course</b> <b>website.</b> Key-Words:- Internet <b>course</b> <b>website,</b> perceived usefulness (PU), perceived ease of use (PEU), usage, and business management students...|$|E
40|$|There {{exists a}} plethora of technologies, {{including}} course websites that cater for the realization and expansion of eLearning {{in terms of its}} course-content delivery. Nevertheless, the technologies (i. e. <b>course</b> <b>website)</b> alone do not express the successful outcomes due to the implementation alone. Students ’ behavior and responses toward the technology (i. e. <b>course</b> <b>website)</b> will eventually determine whether the implementation is successful. Therefore, this paper seeks to highlight two important beliefs, i. e. perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness that has been widely applied to understand technology acceptance. More importantly, it remains the sole objective of this paper to validate the instrument of <b>course</b> <b>website</b> acceptance in a public institution of higher learning. Two main steps were involved in the validation of the instrument, which are 1) Exploratory validation of the initial R-type factor analysis and Cronbach Alpha reliability assessment, and 2) Confirmatory validation that includes convergent, discriminant and construct reliability assessment. The three constructs, i. e. <b>course</b> <b>website</b> usefulness, ease of use and usage were found to be just identified models that have sufficient regression weights. An item was dropped from <b>course</b> <b>website</b> usefulness, while three items each were dropped from the <b>course</b> <b>website</b> usefulness and ease of use constructs respectively. The findings suggest that the instrument that is in English might be the cause of these dropped items...|$|E

40|$|Since {{the advent}} of online {{education}} in 1994 by CALCampus, many improvements have been made for effectiveness of e-learning. Video/audio conferencing, synchronous education system and many such advances in multimedia communication have made this system more popular among the masses. However with many online education websites, competing {{to make the same}} course, it’s important for user to find course structure of his interest. What makes even more challenging for a learner is, to decide how good will be the learning from a course provided by a particular site. For example open online course sites like edx. org, canvas. net, coursera. org etc provide similar types of course but the course structure and outcome of the courses are different. Hence it is imperative to integrate such information, in order to get more relevance of similar courses. What gives more advantage is, if a student can find similar courses offered by his university on massive open online <b>course</b> <b>websites.</b> This will surely provide a student more details about the course apart from his college curriculum, making his learning experience more unique. So the objective of this project is, to gather semi-structured and unstructured data from MOOC (massive open online <b>course)</b> <b>websites.</b> Perform similarity check among the <b>courses</b> from these <b>websites</b> and provide likeness between the courses provided by the university and by the MOOC websites on mobile...|$|R

40|$|Abstract:- Course {{websites}} {{have been}} used to enhance the delivery of learning materials that is not bounded by time and space. Although the usage of course websites are common in the West, but in a developing country like Malaysia, it is not the norm but the exception. This research builds on previous research done in Malaysian by looking at the moderating role of prior experience in explaining usage of an Internet <b>course</b> <b>website.</b> Data was collected from second year business management students who are required to use the <b>course</b> <b>website</b> for their business research methods class. The Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) developed by Davis [I] was used as the model for investigating the usage of the <b>course</b> <b>website.</b> TAM proposes that perceived usefulness (PU) and per:ceived ease of use (PEU) are key determinants of usage of a particular technology or system. This research further extends the relationship to include prior experience as a moderator in this relationship. The regression analysis results indicate that the two constructs were able to explain 47. 8 % of the variation in the usage of the <b>course</b> <b>website.</b> Perceived usefulness (13 = 0. 45, p<O,Ol) was the more influential predictor of usage with perceived ease of use (13 = 0. 34, p<O. Ol) also significant. Perceived ease ofuse was also positively related to perceived usefulness of the <b>course</b> <b>website.</b> The findings of this study however did not support the moderating role on prior experience.
