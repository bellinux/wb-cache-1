40|$|International audienceTwo {{mechanisms}} are studied {{to explain the}} asymmetrical <b>chromium</b> <b>depletions</b> observed ahead of SCC crack tips in nickel-base alloys: diffusion-induced grain boundary migration (DIGM) and plasticity-enhanced diffusion.

The occurrence of grain boundary migration depends on the grain boundary character and misorientation. On the other hand, the effect of plasticity on chromium diffusion in nickel single-crystals is investigated by performing diffusion tests during creep tests at 500 and 350 °C. An enhancement of Cr diffusion is observed and a linear relationship between the diffusion coefficient and strain rate is evidenced.

40|$|Abstract Radiation-induced <b>chromium</b> (Cr) <b>depletion</b> at grain {{boundaries}} (GB) {{is known as}} one of the major phenomena to degrade corrosion resistance of austenitic stainless steel. Electron irradiation is commonly used as a simulation of neutron irradiation to study the mechanism of the Cr depletion fundament-ally. In this study, the availability of a high-voltage electron microscope (HVEM) and a transmission electron microscope with a field emission gun and an energy dispersive X-ray analyser (FEG-TEM/EDX) combination, is discussed as one of the simulation techniques for the radiation-induced segregation near GB due to the neutron irradiation under a boiling water reactor core environment. For the discussion, we investigated the effect of Ti and Nb addition on suppression of the Cr depletion in the temperatures of 523 - 673 K. Radiation-induced segregation (RIS) occurs in SUS 316 L irradiated with electrons at 523 K, and behaviour of the solute segregation obtained from the electron irradiation simulates RIS under neutron irradiation at 561 K. The tendency of the Cr depletion under the electron irradiation of 523 - 573 K, is similar to that from the neutron irradiation for the materials containing small amounts of Ti and Nb. It is confirmed that the combination of HVEM and FEG-TEM/EDX is one of the appropriate simulation techniques for the studies of radiation-induced segregation near GB...|$|R
40|$|A {{model has}} been {{developed}} for evaluating the effect of thermal aging on the repassivation potential of austenitic alloys. The model consists of two parts – a grain boundary microchemistry model for calculating the <b>chromium</b> and molybdenum <b>depletion</b> profiles {{in the vicinity of}} grain boundaries and an electrochemical model that relates the repassivation potential to the microchemistry and environmental conditions including temperature and solution chemistry. The grain boundary microchemistry model incorporates a thermodynamic para-equilibrium treatment of the formation of carbides and a kinetic treatment of the diffusion of Cr and Mo. With this model, experimental Cr and Mo depletion profiles can be reproduced for sensitized alloys 600, 825, and 316 L. The repassivation potential model accounts for the effects of solution chemistry and temperature by considering competitive dissolution, adsorption and oxide formation processes at the interface between the metal and the occluded site solution. Using a previously established relationship between the repassivation potential and alloy composition, a procedure has been established to calculate the observable repassivation potential by integrating its local values that reflect the alloy microchemistry in the depletion zone. The predicted repassivation potentials agree with experimental data for thermally aged alloys 600 and 825 in chloride solutions...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} degree of {{sensitization}} (DOS) of {{austenitic stainless steels}} (SS) is {{defined in terms of}} the characteristic parameters of the <b>chromium</b> <b>depletion</b> zones: coverage (proportion of the grain boundary length covered by <b>chromium</b> <b>depletion</b> zones), width, and depth (the minimum level of chromium in the depletion zones). A sample matrix was developed that provides heat-treated samples of Type 304 SS (UNS S 30400) having the same coverage developed at four different temperatures of heat treatments. The coverage was measured by quantitative metallography. The absolute value of depth was measured by the quantitative potentiostatic electrochemical test. Other electrochemical (potentiodynamic and potentiostatic) techniques were used to assess the depth of <b>chromium</b> <b>depletion</b> zones. New parameters have been developed to express the results of the potentiodynamic, potentiostatic, and electrochemical potentiokinetic reactivation (EPR) tests that reflect the contributions attributable to either coverage and depth or only the depth of <b>chromium</b> <b>depletion</b> zones. It has been shown that these new parameters are sensitive in the range of 7. 5 % to 13. 5 % Cr in the depletion zones.

40|$|This {{article was}} {{published}} in the journal, Corrosion Science [© Elsevier]. The definitive version is available at: [URL]. A new three dimensional modelling technique has been developed to predict <b>chromium</b> <b>depletion</b> from grain boundaries in Ni-Cr-Fe alloys. The technique is based on precipitation kinetics represented by the Zener’s Equation and the error function solution of the diffusion law. Unlike former models, the model predicts a natural transition from sensitization to desensitisation and time delay in reaching the minimum chromium concentration at grain boundaries. In addition, the whole prediction can be made using a single Excel worksheet, therefore provides a simple and effective tool for sensitization/desensitisation predictions and studies. Grain size effects and Temperature-Time-Concentration (TTC) maps can also be predicted.

40|$|With an {{increasing}} application of high temperature alloys, especially Ni-based superalloys in automobile and other industrial fields, {{the ability to}} predict components’ lifetime becomes a predominant demand from both safety and energy consumption aspects. In the present investigation, {{an attempt was made}} to develop a generalized oxidation lifetime model for chromia-forming FCC alloys that can be incorporated into alloy data sheets and easily understood and employed by component designers. The model captures the most important damaging oxidation effects relevant for component design: wall thickness loss, scale spallation and the occurrence of “breakaway” oxidation. The material used for development of the concept was the wrought NiCrW base alloy 230. For deriving modeling input parameters and for verification of the model approach, specimens of this alloy with different thicknesses were exposed cyclically for different times at temperatures in the range 950 - 1050 °C in static laboratory air. The studies concentrated on thin specimens (thickness 0. 2 - 0. 5 mm) to obtain data for critical subscale depletion processes resulting in “breakaway” oxidation within reasonably achievable test times up to 3000 h. The oxidation kinetics and oxidation induced subscale microstructural changes from the long term tests were combined with results from thermogravimetric analyses (TGA), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) with energy dispersive x-ray (EDX) spectroscopy and electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD), as well as glow discharge optical emission spectroscopy (GDOES). Oxidation induced microstructural changes as function of specimen thickness, time and temperature were estimated and modeled using the software packages Thermocalc and DICTRA. The modeling of the oxide scale spalling and re-formation was based on the cyclic oxidation spallation program (COSP), which was published previously. The program was modified to adapt the approach to the present experimental observations. A new model was developed to describe accelerated oxidation occurring after longer exposure times in case of the thinnest specimens. The calculated oxidation kinetics was correlated with the Cr reservoir equation, by means of which the relation between the consumption and the remained concentration of the scale forming element (Cr) in the alloys is established as a function of temperature and specimen thickness. The results obtained by the reservoir approach were compared with calculations of Cr concentration profiles using a finite difference model. Based on this approach, a generalized lifetime diagram is proposed in which wall thickness loss as function of time, specimen thickness and temperature as well as times to reaching a critical <b>chromium</b> subscale <b>depletion</b> are presented. The same approach was subsequently applied to the nickel base alloys X and NiCr 8020 as well as the austenitic steel Nicrofer 2020. Both Ni base alloys showed shorter times to critical subscale depletion than alloy 230; alloy X mainly due to higher scale growth rates, alloy NiCr 8020 due to poorer scale adherence and a lower initial Cr content. The austenitic steel showed the shortest lifetime mainly due to Mn and Ti induced high growth rates of the chromia scale and resulting low Cr interface concentrations...|$|R

The UHP alloy suffered severe cracking in CERT tests in water. Less cracking was found after CERT test of irradiated UHP+Por UHP+Si alloys, despite greater <b>chromium</b> <b>depletion.</b> This suggests a mitigating effect of phosphorus and silicon at grain boundaries.

40|$|Numerous chromia-forming {{austenitic}} steels and nickel-base alloys contain chromium-rich strengthening precipitates, e. g. chromium-base carbides. During {{high temperature}} exposure {{the formation of}} the chromia base oxide scale results in <b>chromium</b> <b>depletion</b> in the alloy matrix and consequently in dissolution of the strengthening phase in the sub-surface zone. The present study describes the oxidation induced phase changes in the <b>chromium</b> <b>depletion</b> layer in case of alloy 625, a nickel base alloy in which the strengthening precipitates contain hardly any or only minor amounts of chromium. Specimens of alloy 625 were subjected to oxidation up to 1000 h at 900 and 1000 degrees C and analyzed in respect to oxide formation and microstructural changes using light optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, energy and wavelength dispersive analysis, glow discharge optical emission spectroscopy, and X-ray diffraction. In {{spite of the fact that}} the alloy precipitates delta-Ni 3 Nb and/or (Ni, Mo) (6) C contain only minor amounts of chromium, the oxidation induced <b>chromium</b> <b>depletion</b> results in formation of a wide sub-surface zone in which the precipitate phases are depleted. However, in parallel, substantial niobium diffusion occurs towards the alloy surface resulting in formation of a thin layer of delta-Ni 3 Nb phase adjacent to the alloy/oxide interface. By modeling phase equilibria and diffusion processes using Thermo-Calc and DICTRA it could be shown that the phase changes in the sub-scale zone are governed by the influence of alloy matrix chromium concentration on the thermodynamic activities of the other alloying elements, mainly niobium and carbon. The delta-phase depletion/enrichment process is caused by a decreasing niobium activity with decreasing chromium concentration whereas the (Ni, Mo) (6) C dissolution finds its cause in the increasing carbon activity with decreasing chromium content...|$|E

In both cases, the performance is good however the morphology of corrosion attack is different which indicates different corrosion mechanisms. In {{waste incineration plants}} there is general attack and shallow pitting, {{and in some cases}} dendritic attack especially on the fins of waterwalls. The dendritic attack is in the dendritic core. The presence of pits or dendritic attack is linked to the temperature of the metallic surface and the molten salt composition.

40|$|Gasification {{of biomass}} and waste is {{promising}} {{for reducing the}} use of fossil fuels. While the operation conditions of superheaters and gas coolers in the gasifier are restricted by gas-side corrosion, scientific investigations are very scarce in this field. The corrosion of stainless steel (304 L) and low-alloy steel (T 22) in the 2 MW Chalmers gasifier was investigated. To understand corrosion in the real gasifier, simplified laboratory experiments were performed, focussing {{on the effect of}} H 2 and H 2 O on different high temperature alloys. While 304 L stainless steel showed protective behaviour in dry O 2 at 600 ˚C due to formation of a slow-growing (FexCr 1 -x) 2 O 3 oxide, it suffered rapid oxidation in H 2 + H 2 O + Ar environment at the same temperature. It is argued that “breakaway” oxidation was triggered by a deep <b>chromium</b> <b>depletion</b> of the alloy substrate. The <b>chromium</b> <b>depletion</b> was deeper in H 2 -H 2 O environment than it is in, e. g. dry O 2 because the pure chromia scale formed in H 2 -H 2 O environment grew faster that the (Cr 1 -xFex) 2 O 3 scale formed in air and dry O 2. The ability of stainless steel to resist corrosion at high temperature relies on selective oxidation of chromium to form a slow-growing (FexCr 1 -x) 2 O 3 layer, the protective behaviour being the result of slow transport of ions through the oxide and the availability of chromium in the alloy. It is argued that if the alloy substrate becomes exhausted in chromium, another, faster mode of oxidation starts which is characterized by oxidation of iron to Fe 2 +. The deep <b>chromium</b> <b>depletion</b> of the metal substrate is also accompanied by dissolution of oxygen into the metal and internal oxidation. The latter corresponds to a mixture of nm size FeCr spinel oxide particles and Fe,Ni metal. Compared to 304 L, the highly alloyed stainless steel Sanicro 28 and the FeCrAl alloy Kanthal APMT showed superior performance in H 2 + H 2 O + Ar environment. The corrosion resistance of Sanicro 28 is explained by its high Cr content which precluded a very deep Cr depletion of the alloy.

40|$|For {{its high}} creep {{resistance}} the commercial nickel-base alloy 625 relies on {{solid solution strengthening}} in combination with precipitation hardening by formation of delta-Ni 3 Nb and (Ni,Mo,Si) 6 C precipitates during high-temperature service. In oxidizing environments the alloy forms a slow growing, continuous chromia layer on the material surface which protects the alloy against rapid oxidation attack. The growth of the chromia base oxide scale results during exposure at 900 – 1000 °C in oxidation-induced <b>chromium</b> <b>depletion</b> in the subsurface zone of the alloy. Microstructural analyses of the cross-sectioned specimens revealed that this process results in formation of a wide subsurface zone in which the mentioned strengthening phases are dissolved, {{in spite of the}} fact that both phases do not contain substantial amounts of the scale-forming element chromium. The cross-sectional analyses revealed that, in parallel to the formation of a precipitate depleted zone, a thin, continuous layer of niobium-rich intermetallic precipitates formed in the immediate vicinity of the scale/alloy interface. The Subsurface Phase Enrichment (abbreviated as SPE) was shown to be the result of an uphill-diffusion of niobium, i. e. the element stabilizing the strengthening precipitates delta-Ni 3 Nb, in the chromium activity gradient and is thus a natural consequence of the oxidation-induced <b>chromium</b> <b>depletion</b> beneath the chromia scale. The thermodynamic calculations carried out using the Thermo-Calc/DICTRA software packages revealed that in alloy 625 the chemical activity of niobium decreases with decreasing chromium content. As chromium is being continuously removed from the alloy as the result of the chromia scale growth, the zone of lowest Nb-activity is formed in the location with the lowest chromium concentration, i. e. the scale/alloy interface. This creates a driving force for Nb to diffuse towards the scale/alloy interface against its own concentration gradient, which is known in literature as uphill-diffusion phenomenon. Also the M 6 C carbide is found to dissolve in the subsurface zone during high-temperature oxidation of alloy 625 although chromium is only a minor constituent in this (Ni 3 Mo 3) C base carbide The thermodynamic calculations revealed the carbide dissolution to find its cause in the increasing carbon activity with decreasing chromium content which forced carbon to diffuse back from the subscale zone towards the bulk alloy resulting in carbide dissolution beneath the chromia scale. SPE is experimentally found to be substantially less pronounced in thin foils than in thick specimens of alloy 625. It could be shown that this effect is related to the smaller reservoirs of the scale-forming element chromium as well as that of the delta-Ni 3 Nb phase stabilizing element niobium in the thin specimens. As the thinner specimens (thickness in the range of 0. 1 mm) become more rapidly depleted in chromium resulting in flatter <b>chromium</b> <b>depletion</b> profiles, a smaller driving force for uphill-diffusion of Nb towards the scale/alloy interface leads to a substantially less pronounced delta-phase enrichment/depletion than in specimens of a few mm thickness. Decreasing specimen thickness suppresses the enrichment/depletion process of the delta-Ni 3 Nb phase and results in complete dissolution of the M 6 C carbide after longer exposure times. SPE is not observed during oxidation of extremely thin-walled specimens, e. g. extremely thin foils or metal foam particles fabricated from alloy 625. During high-temperature oxidation of metal foams consisting of e. g. 20 - 60 µm diameter particles, the delta-Ni 3 Nb phase enrichment at the scale/alloy interface does not occur and can thus be virtually ignored when modelling the oxidation-induced lifetime limits of alloy 625 metal foams. The lifetime prediction based on the finite-difference calculation of the <b>chromium</b> <b>depletion</b> at the metal/oxide interface of a spherical metal foam particle showed a parabolic dependence of the time to breakaway from the foam particle radius. The predicted lifetimes were found to be in good agreement with the experimental results. A new analytical lifetime model to predict times to breakaway of thin-walled components (foils, wires, metal foams, etc.) was developed as an extension of the available lifetime models. The lifetime model derived is a simple mathematical expression which is able to substitute conventional robust equations thus making the lifetime prediction less time consuming and more efficient. The simplified lifetime treatment shows excellent agreement with the conventional lifetime models and is also in good agreement with the experimental breakaway results for alloy 625 metal foams...|$|E
40|$|The {{magnitudes}} of both void {{swelling and}} radiation-induced segregation (RIS) in iron-chromium-nickel alloys {{are dependent on}} bulk alloy composition. Because the diffusivity of nickel via the vacancy flux is slow relative to chromium, nickel enriches and chromium depletes at void surfaces during irradiation. This local composition change reduces the subsequent vacancy flux to the void, thereby reducing void swelling. In this work, the resistance to swelling from major element segregation is estimated using diffusivities derived from grain boundary segregation measurements in irradiated iron-chromium-nickel alloys. The resistance to void swelling in iron- and nickel-base alloys correlates with the segregation and both are functions of bulk alloy composition. Alloys that display {{the greatest amount of}} nickel enrichment and <b>chromium</b> <b>depletion</b> are found to be most resistant to void swelling, as predicted. Additionally, swelling is shown to be greater in alloys in which the RIS profiles are slow to develop...|$|E
40|$|International audienceAlloy 600, {{a nickel}} base alloy {{containing}} 15 % chromium, {{is used in}} primary circuit of Pressurized Water Reactor (PWR). This alloy is well known to be susceptible to Stress Corrosion Cracking (SCC) in PWR primary water. Despite {{the fact that many}} laboratory studies have been performed and that many models are proposed in the literature, the mechanisms involved are still not well known. In the proposed model, the transport of species (oxygen, hydrogen and chromium) is considered as playing a key role. Therefore, experiments and calculations are performed in order to study the transport of chromium, hydrogen and oxygen in Alloy 600 and in model alloys. The results lead {{to the conclusion that the}} transport of oxygen and hydrogen cannot be considered as the rate-controlling steps. The dissymmetric aspect of the crack tip and of the <b>chromium</b> <b>depletion</b> ahead of the crack lead to the conclusion that chromium diffusion could play a significant role in the mechanism...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{effect of}} water vapor on the {{oxidation}} {{behavior of a}} Ni- 25 wt. %Cr alloy in air was studied between 1000 and 1300 A degrees C by comparing, after test in dry air and in a humidified air, mass gain results and surface/sub-surface metallographic observations. It was found that, for the conditions studied, the transient oxidation {{at the beginning of}} the isothermal stage and the isothermal oxidation are both slightly slower in wet air than in dry air. The oxide formed in wet air over the surface tended to be less coarse and less thick than the one formed in dry air. The <b>chromium</b> <b>depletion</b> depths in the sub-surface were similar between the two atmospheres but the concentration at the oxide/alloy interface was higher for wet air than for dry air oxidation. The oxide scale formed in wet air seemed more resistant against spallation at cooling than the scale formed in dry air...|$|E
40|$|International audienceMarking is {{of prime}} {{importance}} {{in the field of}} biomaterials to allow the identification of surgical tools or implants. Markings are obtained under industrial conditions with a pulsed Nd:YAG laser on a X 30 C 13 martensitic stainless steel. Depending on laser parameters, two modes of marking are considered: a surface oxidisation mode and a matter photoablation mode. Electrochemical behaviour, i. e. passive state, corrosion rate, resistance to pitting, is evaluated in Ringer's saline solution. Results are then explained on the basis of metallurgical modifications regarding the phases composition and the distribution of alloying elements. In oxidative regime, laser treatment drastically affects both microstructure and chemical composition. Specially, <b>chromium</b> <b>depletion</b> is measured in subsurface, leading to a loss of passive ability. In ablative mode the surface is transformed into a thin favourable layer of austenite. Moreover, the overall chromium distribution is little modified. Therefore, the passive character is maintained, but with nevertheless a shorter passive domain than base material one...|$|E
40|$|Effect of a {{quenching}} medium (water, liquid nitrogen and block of brass) on a short-range ordering in Fe(100 -x) Cr(x) (x less than 19) alloys was studied with the Moessbauer spectroscopy. The distribution of Cr atoms was {{expressed in terms}} of the Cowley-Warren short-range order (SRO) parameters: alpha 1 for the first neighbor-shell, alpha 2 for the second neighbor-shell and alpha 12 for both neighbor-shells. It was revealed that none of the quenching media resulted in a random distribution of atoms, yet the degree of randomness was the highest for the samples quenched onto the block of brass. The quenching into water and liquid nitrogen caused a partial oxidation of samples surface accompanied by a <b>chromium</b> <b>depletion</b> of the bulk. Quantitative analysis of various phases in the studied samples both in their bulk as well as in pre surface zones was carried out. Comment: 18 pages, 6 figures, 4 tables, 33 reference...|$|E
40|$|The high {{chromium}} nickel {{base alloy}} 602 CA {{is used as}} construction material for high temperature components in aggressive environments such as gas burners or heat exchangers. The high temperature oxidation behaviour of this alloy is characterised by {{the formation of an}} external Cr 2 O 3 scale and internal precipitation of alumina. The main goal of the present investigation was to elucidate the effect of aluminum on the subscale <b>chromium</b> <b>depletion</b> phenomena. The chromium concentration profiles were found to be flat and sometimes even increasing towards the oxide-alloy interface. The experimental observations were interpreted in terms of alloy thermodynamics, i. e. effect of oxidation induced compositional changes on chemical potentials of the alloy constituents. The concentration profiles in alloy 602 CA observed during high temperature exposure were modelled using the CALPHAD approach for thermodynamic and kinetic calculations. Thermodynamic calculations revealed that the Al depletion in the alloy subsurface due to internal alumina precipitation leads to enhanced Cr diffusion towards the alloy surface...|$|E

The <b>chromium</b> <b>depletion</b> of the ferr ite phase result ing from the ~ ' precipitation causes corrosion of the ferr ite regions in A 262 E test.

40|$|Effect of {{different}} levels of oversize element, cerium, on radiation-induced segregation (RIS) in type 316 stainless steel was investigated. The effect of prior cold-work on RIS was also investigated. Samples with 0. 00, 0. 01, and 0. 04 wt. % cerium were irradiated to 0. 70 dpa using 4. 8 MeV protons at 300 A degrees C. Characterization of proton-irradiated specimens was carried out using electrochemical potentiokinetic reactivation (EPR) test followed by atomic force microscopic examination. The specimen with prior cold-work (without cerium addition) showed the lowest EPR values indicating the lowest <b>chromium</b> <b>depletion</b> in this material. The specimen with 0. 04 wt. % cerium showed the lower EPR value {{as compared to the}} specimen with 0. 01 wt. % Ce. The irradiated specimen with prior cold-work showed linear features after the EPR tests and such features were attributed to decoration of dislocations, generated due to prior cold-work, by point defects produced during irradiation. The resistance to RIS offered by cold-work (linear features) has been more effective as compared to that by the addition of oversize solute addition...|$|E
40|$|Improvement of {{the high}} {{temperature}} oxidation behavior of conventional EN 1. 4301 (AISI type 304) stainless steel was achieved by implanting cerium ions. Implantation was performed in samples with two different surface treatments: commercial 2 B mill finishing and preoxidation in synthetic air. One set of samples was annealed after implantation in order to recover the damage induced in the crystalline structure. Results show that the implantation of Ce greatly improves the oxidation resistance at 1173 K of the EN- 1. 4301 grade stainless steels and that the annealing treatment after the implantation is beneficial during the subsequent oxidation. Experiments confirm the presence of spinel-type compounds and Cr 2 O 3 and Fe-Cr mixed oxides with high Cr content in the scale, and martensite being the dominating metallic phase. <b>Chromium</b> <b>depletion</b> in the near-surface layers is also described. Results are compared to previously published data on surface modification using La and Ce by pyrolysis of aerosols.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{in detail the}} oxidation of two cast stainless steels in synthetic diesel and gasoline exhaust gases. One alloy was ferritic (Fe 18 Cr 1. 4 Nb 2. 1 Mn 0. 32 C) and one austenitic (Fe 20 Cr 9 Ni 1. 9 Nb 2. 7 W 0. 47 C). Polished sections were exposed, mostly for 50 h, at temperatures between 650 and 1, 050 degrees C. The oxidation product was characterized by means of SEM/EDX, AES, and XRD. Inter-dendritic non-Cr carbides initiated thick oxides. The ferritic steel formed a rather thin and adherent oxide scale at all temperatures. It consisted of (Mn, Cr) oxide on top of Cr 2 O 3 and, starting at 850 degrees C, a thin silica film at the metal-oxide interface. <b>Chromium</b> <b>depletion</b> triggered dissolution of carbides providing Cr to the oxide. Water vapor did not accelerate the attack since the outer (Mn, Cr) spinel oxide reduced the Cr evaporation. The austenitic grade was very sensitive to water vapor. Chromium segregation directed pitting to the dendrites up to 950 degrees C whereas uniform catastrophic oxidation occurred at 1, 050 degrees C...|$|E
