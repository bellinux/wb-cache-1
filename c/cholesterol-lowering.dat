5|$|The <b>cholesterol-lowering</b> drugs, the statins, were {{initially}} produced by fungi including Penicillium. The first commercial statin, lovastatin, was fermented by the mould Aspergillus terreus.|$|E
5|$|Biologically active {{mushroom}} polysaccharides {{have been}} a frequent research topic in recent decades due to their possible stimulatory effect on innate and cell-mediated immune responses, antitumor activities, and other activities. Immunostimulatory activity, antioxidant activity, <b>cholesterol-lowering,</b> and blood sugar-lowering effects have been detected in extracts of R.virescens fruit bodies, which are attributed to polysaccharides. A water-insoluble beta-glucan, RVS3-II, has been isolated from the fruit bodies. Sulfated derivatives of this compound have antitumor activities against sarcoma tumor cell lines. RVP, a water-soluble polysaccharide present in the mushroom, is made largely of galactomannan subunits and has antioxidant activity.|$|E
5|$|In the West, A.auricula-judae {{was used}} in folk {{medicine}} {{as recently as the}} 19th century for complaints including sore throats, sore eyes and jaundice, and as an astringent. Although it is not widely consumed in the West, it has long been popular in China, to the extent that Australia exported large volumes to China in the early twentieth century. Today, the fungus is a popular ingredient in many Chinese dishes, such as hot and sour soup, and also used in Chinese medicine. It is also used in Ghana, as a blood tonic. Modern research into possible medical applications has variously concluded that A.auricula-judae has antitumour, hypoglycemic, anticoagulant and <b>cholesterol-lowering</b> properties.|$|E
5|$|The {{human use}} of fungi for food {{preparation}} or preservation and other purposes is extensive {{and has a}} long history. Mushroom farming and mushroom gathering are large industries in many countries. The study of the historical uses and sociological impact of fungi is known as ethnomycology. Because of the capacity of this group to produce an enormous range of natural products with antimicrobial or other biological activities, many species have long been used or are being developed for industrial production of antibiotics, vitamins, and anti-cancer and <b>cholesterol-lowering</b> drugs. More recently, methods {{have been developed for}} genetic engineering of fungi, enabling metabolic engineering of fungal species. For example, genetic modification of yeast species—which are easy to grow at fast rates in large fermentation vessels—has opened up ways of pharmaceutical production that are potentially more efficient than production by the original source organisms.|$|E
5|$|While Wally goes to {{a funeral}} home to attend {{the wake of a}} former estate client, the client's son claims that his father was killed by Krayoxx, a <b>cholesterol-lowering</b> drug {{developed}} by the (fictional) pharmaceutical company Varrick Labs. Ecstatic at the possible monetary returns on the case, the firm finds several former clients who appear to have valid claims about Krayoxx. Oscar and Wally generate publicity in the Chicago Tribune with a picture of their filing; this induces an avalanche of communications and leads them to several additional claimants. However, Wally and his fellows are far out of their depth. None of the three Finley & Figg lawyers has ever argued in a United States federal court, and they have only a vague idea of what is involved in confronting a major corporation which is able to hire the best legal talent around - which turns out to be Zinc's old firm.|$|E

25|$|There {{are also}} some links between {{prostate}} cancer and medications, medical procedures, and medical conditions. Use of the <b>cholesterol-lowering</b> drugs known as the statins may also decrease prostate cancer risk.|$|E
25|$|Because Asians {{appear to}} process the drug differently, half the {{standard}} dose can have the same <b>cholesterol-lowering</b> benefit in those patients, though a full dose could {{increase the risk of}} side-effects, a study by the drug's manufacturer, AstraZeneca, indicated.|$|E
25|$|Atorvastatin {{may be used}} in {{combination}} with bile acid sequestrants and ezetimibe to increase the reduction in cholesterol levels. However, It is not recommended to combine statin drug treatment with certain other <b>cholesterol-lowering</b> drugs, particularly fibrates, because this may increase the risk of myopathy-related adverse effects.|$|E
25|$|These drugs include {{rosuvastatin}} (CRESTOR), lovastatin (Mevacor), atorvastatin (Lipitor), pravastatin (Pravachol), fluvastatin (Lescol), pitavastatin (Livalo), and simvastatin (Zocor). Red yeast rice extract, {{one of the}} fungal {{sources from}} which the statins were discovered, contains several naturally occurring <b>cholesterol-lowering</b> molecules known as monacolins. The most active of these is monacolin K, or lovastatin (previously sold under the trade name Mevacor, and now available as generic lovastatin).|$|E
25|$|Since the {{reaction}} catalysed by HMG-CoA reductase is the rate-limiting step in cholesterol synthesis, this enzyme represents the sole major drug target for contemporary <b>cholesterol-lowering</b> drugs in humans. The medical significance of HMG-CoA reductase {{has continued to}} expand beyond its direct role in cholesterol synthesis following the discovery that statins can offer cardiovascular health benefits independent of cholesterol reduction. Statins {{have been shown to}} have anti-inflammatory properties, most likely {{as a result of their}} ability to limit production of key downstream isoprenoids that are required for portions of the inflammatory response. It can be noted that blocking of isoprenoid synthesis by statins has shown promise in treating a mouse model of multiple sclerosis, an inflammatory autoimmune disease.|$|E
25|$|In 2016, the United States Department of Agriculture Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee {{recommended}} that Americans eat as little dietary cholesterol as possible. Increased dietary intake of industrial trans fats {{is associated with}} an increased risk in all-cause mortality and cardiovascular diseases. Trans fats have been shown to reduce levels of HDL while increasing levels of LDL. Based on such evidence and evidence implicating low HDL and high LDL levels in cardiovascular disease (see Hypercholesterolemia), many health authorities advocate reducing LDL-cholesterol through changes in diet in addition to other lifestyle modifications. Rats subjected to high-fat or fructose diets became dyslipidemic. However, well designed, adequately powered randomized controlled trials investigating patient-relevant outcomes of low-fat diets for otherwise healthy people with hypercholesterolaemia are lacking. Moreover, for familial hypercholesterolaemia, large, parallel, randomized controlled trials are still needed to investigate the effectiveness of a <b>cholesterol-lowering</b> diet and the addition of omega-3 fatty acids, soya protein, plant sterols or stanols.|$|E

2500|$|Clinical {{practice}} guidelines generally recommend {{people to}} try [...] "lifestyle modification", including a <b>cholesterol-lowering</b> diet and physical exercise, before statin use. Statins or other pharmacologic agents may be recommended {{for those who}} do not meet their lipid-lowering goals through diet and lifestyle changes. Statins appear to work equally well in males and females.|$|E
2500|$|Since 1990, Ravnskov has {{published}} over 80 scientific papers {{critical of the}} Diet-Heart Idea, proposing new hypotheses and also contending that [...] "the successful dissemination of the diet-heart idea is due to authors systematically ignoring or misquoting discordant (contradictory) studies". He {{was the first to}} suggest that the positive effect of the statins may be due to other effects than <b>cholesterol-lowering.</b>|$|E
2500|$|These tests {{suggest the}} Staphylococcus strains use staphyloxanthin as a defence against the normal human immune system. [...] Drugs {{designed}} to inhibit {{the production of}} staphyloxanthin may weaken the bacterium and renew its susceptibility to antibiotics. [...] In fact, because of similarities in the pathways for biosynthesis of staphyloxanthin and human cholesterol, a drug developed {{in the context of}} <b>cholesterol-lowering</b> therapy was shown to block S. aureus pigmentation and disease progression in a mouse infection model.|$|E
2500|$|Many {{types of}} drugs can cause liver injury, {{including}} the analgesic paracetamol; antibiotics such as isoniazid, nitrofurantoin, amoxicillin-clavulanate, erythromycin, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole; anticonvulsants such as valproate and phenytoin; <b>cholesterol-lowering</b> statins; steroids such as oral contraceptives and anabolic steroids; and highly active anti-retroviral therapy {{used in the}} treatment of HIV/AIDS. Of these, amoxicillin-clavulanate is {{the most common cause of}} drug-induced liver injury, and paracetamol toxicity [...] the most common cause of acute liver failure in the United States and Europe.|$|E

2500|$|HMG-CoA reductase (3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-coenzyme A reductase, officially {{abbreviated}} HMGCR) is the rate-controlling enzyme (NADH-dependent, NADPH-dependent, [...] ) of the mevalonate pathway, {{the metabolic}} pathway that produces cholesterol and other isoprenoids. Normally in mammalian cells this enzyme is suppressed by cholesterol {{derived from the}} internalization and degradation of low density lipoprotein (LDL) via the LDL receptor as well as oxidized species of cholesterol. Competitive inhibitors of the reductase induce the expression of LDL receptors in the liver, which in turn increases the catabolism of plasma LDL and lowers the plasma concentration of cholesterol, an important determinant of atherosclerosis. This enzyme is thus {{the target of the}} widely available <b>cholesterol-lowering</b> drugs known collectively as the statins.|$|E
2500|$|Placebos used in {{clinical}} trials have sometimes had unintended consequences. A report in the Annals of Internal Medicine that looked at details from 150 clinical trials found that certain placebos used in the trials affected the results. For example, one study on <b>cholesterol-lowering</b> drugs used olive oil and corn oil in the placebo pills. However, according to the report, this [...] "may lead to an understatement of drug benefit: The monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids of these 'placebos,' and their antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects, can reduce lipid levels and heart disease." [...] Another example researchers reported {{in the study was}} a clinical trial of a new therapy for cancer patients suffering from anorexia. The placebo that was used included lactose. However, since cancer patients typically face a higher risk of lactose intolerance, the placebo pill might actually have caused unintended side-effects that made the experimental drug look better in comparison.|$|E
2500|$|In October 2003, {{several months}} after its {{introduction}} in Europe, Richard Horton, {{the editor of the}} medical journal The Lancet, criticized the way Crestor had been introduced. [...] "AstraZeneca's tactics in marketing its <b>cholesterol-lowering</b> drug, rosuvastatin, raise disturbing questions about how drugs enter clinical practice and what measures exist to protect patients from inadequately investigated medicines," [...] according to his editorial. The Lancet's editorial position is that the data for Crestor’s superiority rely too much on extrapolation from the lipid profile data (surrogate end-points) and too little on hard clinical end-points, which are available for other statins that had been on the market longer. The manufacturer responded by stating that few drugs had been tested so successfully on so many patients. In correspondence published in The Lancet, AstraZeneca's CEO Sir Tom McKillop called the editorial [...] "flawed and incorrect" [...] and slammed the journal for making [...] "such an outrageous critique of a serious, well-studied medicine." ...|$|E
2500|$|There was ongoing {{contention}} {{about the}} results and meaning of intervention studies undertaken before the introduction of statins. A meta-analysis of <b>cholesterol-lowering</b> trials found that trials that were supportive of the lipid hypothesis were cited almost six times as often as those that were not, and {{although there was a}} similar number of trials unsupportive of the hypothesis, none of them were cited after 1970; some of the supportive reviews also exclude and ignore certain trials which were less favorable to the hypothesis. This meta-analysis, including the less-cited trials, found that mortality was not decreased by lowering cholesterol, and that the lowering of cholesterol was unlikely to prevent coronary heart disease. Uffe Ravnskov, director of [...] The International Network of Cholesterol Skeptics, maintains that [...] "prominent scientists have turned white into black by ignoring all conflicting observations; by twisting and exaggerating trivial findings; by citing studies with opposing results in a way to make them look supportive; and by ignoring or scorning the work of critical scientists." ...|$|E
50|$|It {{has been}} shown that high-cholesterol diets tend to {{increase}} Aβ pathology in animals.
