40|$|AbstractCalcium chloride-extracted histones were {{prepared}} from nuclei of the slime moulds, Physarum polycephalum and Dictyostellum discoideum, and phosphorylation by purified preparations of cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase (<b>cAMP-d</b> PK) and growth-associated H 1 histone kinase (HKG) examined and compared. Among the major histone fractions and other proteins {{in the two}} preparations, the H 1 histones from both organisms {{were found to be}} effective and exclusive substrates for HKG, <b>cAMP-d</b> PK, which phosphorylates mammalian H 1 histone and certain, in particular H 2 B, of the mammalian core histones, phosphorylated several of the core histones from both slime moulds but did not phosphorylate H 1 histone from either. The slime mould H 1 s remained ineffective substrates for <b>cAMP-d</b> PK even after extensive alkaline phsophatase treatment of the histone preparations. Additional studies demonstrated that the lack of slime mould H 1 phosphorylation by <b>cAMP-d</b> PK was not due to competition of the H 1 molecules with the core histones for the kinase. Our studies suggest that H 1 histones from these organisms, whilst clearly containing sites for phosphorylation by HKG, apparently lack phosphorylation sites recognised by <b>cAMP-d</b> PK. Thus, the mediation of specific nuclear functions by cAMP-dependent phosphorylation of H 1 in higher organisms may not occur or be required in these lower eukaryotes...|$|R

40|$|The vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP) is {{associated}} with actin filaments and focal adhesions, which form the interface between the cytoskeleton and the extracellular matrix. VASP is phosphorylated by both the <b>cAMP-</b> and cGMP-dependent protein kinases {{in a variety of}} cells, including platelets and smooth muscle cells. Since both the cAMP and cGMP signalling cascades relax smooth muscle and inhibit platelet activation, it was speculated that VASP mediates these effects by modulating actin filament dynamics and integrin activation. To study the physiological relevance of VASP in these processes, we inactivated the VASP gene in mice. Adult VASP-deficient mice had normal agonist-induced contraction, and normal <b>cAMP-</b> and cGMP-dependent relaxation of intestinal and vascular smooth muscle. In contrast, <b>cAMP-</b> and cGMP-mediated inhibition of platelet aggregation was significantly reduced in the absence of VASP. Other <b>cAMP-</b> and cGMP-dependent effects in platelets, such as inhibition of agonist-induced increases in cytosolic calcium concentrations and granule secretion, were not dependent on the presence of VASP. Our data show that two different cyclic, nucleotide-dependent mechanisms are operating during platelet activation: a VASP-independent mechanism for inhibition of calcium mobilization and granule release and a VASP-dependent mechanism for inhibition of platelet aggregation which may involve regulation of integrin function...|$|R

But no longer petrified in all their ignominious attitudes, the herded Titans now sprung to their feet; flung themselves up the slope; and anew battered at the precipice's unresounding wall.

60|$|On that lovely Italo-American morning no {{ghost of}} these old dead embarrassments lingered within {{or without the}} Goethe garden-house.

40|$|When {{cortical}} slices are incubated with adenine- 14 C, adenine nucleotides {{are labeled}} {{in a small}} and relatively stable pool. The ATP- 14 C of this pool is readily converted to <b>cAMP-</b> 14 C during incubations with depolarizing agents, such as K+, ouabain, veratridine, or batrachotoxin. During incubations with these agents, release of acetylcholine and of adenosine into the medium is enhanced. The increase in release of adenosine parallels the enhanced formation of <b>cAMP-</b> 14 C elicited by depolarizing agents, providing further evidence that adenosine may serve to couple electrical activity in {{the central nervous system}} with formation of cAMP. When adenosine or a depolarizing agent are incubated, together with a biogenic amine, such as histamine, serotonin, or norepinephrine, the combined effect on <b>cAMP-</b> 14 C formation in cortical slices is much more than additive. Extracellular levels of biogenic amines could in this manner modulate cAMP formation and biochemical responses in nervous tissue during electrical activity...|$|R
