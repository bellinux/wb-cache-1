40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the issue of}} <b>compensation</b> <b>payments</b> for farmers affected by an animal disease outbreak. Recent literature has questioned the scope for the widely used “single mechanism” of <b>compensation</b> <b>payments</b> to incentivise farmers both to undertake costly on-farm biosecurity and to comply with disease reporting requirements. This paper develops a simple theoretical model of the farmer’s decision environment in this situation and uses a numerical analysis to illustrate both {{the potential for a}} range of levels of <b>compensation</b> <b>payments</b> to achieve this dual incentivising, and how this range is affected by changes in the parameter values of the farmer’s decision environment. The findings of the paper are used to suggest a range of policy implications in relation to <b>compensation</b> <b>payments</b> in the UK...|$|R
40|$|The {{importance}} of <b>compensation</b> <b>payments</b> for biodiversity-enhancing land-use measures has grown {{over the past}} decade, particularly in connection with agri-environmental policy. Given that both the costs {{and the benefits of}} biodiversity-enhancing land-use measures are subject to spatial variation, the criterion of cost-effectiveness calls for spatially heterogeneous <b>compensation</b> <b>payments.</b> However, when deciding whether to implement uniform or heterogeneous <b>compensation</b> <b>payments,</b> the regulator has to compare the disadvantage of uniform payments in terms of cost-effectiveness with the disadvantages of spatially heterogeneous payments. To help resolve this issue, this paper provides a simple ecological-economic model that allows the reduced cost-effectiveness associated with uniform payments for biodiversity-enhancing land-use measures to be assessed for different types of benefit and cost functions.

25|$|A tax {{called the}} undistributed profits tax was enacted in 1936. This time {{the primary purpose}} was revenue, since Congress had enacted the Adjusted <b>Compensation</b> <b>Payment</b> Act, calling for {{payments}} of $2billion to World War I veterans. The bill established the persisting principle that retained corporate earnings could be taxed. Paid dividends were tax deductible by corporations. Its proponents intended the bill to replace all other corporation taxes—believing this would stimulate corporations to distribute earnings and thus put more cash and spending {{power in the hands}} of individuals. In the end, Congress watered down the bill, setting the tax rates at 7 to 27% and largely exempting small enterprises. Facing widespread and fierce criticism, the tax deduction of paid dividends was repealed in 1938.|$|E
25|$|In 1985, a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) {{was signed}} {{committing}} government and two companies (Reed Limited, and Great Lakes Forest Products Ltd.) to a one-time <b>compensation</b> <b>payment.</b> In 1986, the Government of Canada's Grassy Narrows and Islington Indian Bands Mercury Pollution Claims Settlement Act and the Government of Ontario's English and Wabigoon River Systems Mercury Contamination Settlement Agreement Act, facilitated {{the creation of}} the Mercury Disability Fund (MDF) and the Mercury Disability Board, based in Kenora, Ontario. The federal and provincial governments, as well as the two companies involved, paid a total of $16.67 million for the MOA compensation. Canada's contribution was $2.75 million. Part of the First Nations' MOA settlement ($2 million) was placed in a trust fund (which the Province of Ontario is responsible for replenishing when the balance drops below $100,000). The Board administers the trust as well as a benefits mechanism.|$|E

500|$|On leaving Filbert Street, Banks {{requested}} a loyalty bonus from Leicester, {{and was told}} by Matt Gillies [...] "We've decided not to pay you a penny. There's to be no <b>compensation</b> <b>payment</b> and that's final." [...] Banks then refused the move until Stoke boss Tony Waddington seemingly negotiated a £2,000 payment out of Leicester. It was only some years later that Banks was informed that Stoke had actually made the payment, not Leicester. Waddington valued good goalkeepers highly, and the two built up a close relationship. During this time, Banks moved to Madeley, Staffordshire. He replaced John Farmer as the club's number one, and kept goal {{in the last four}} games of the 1966–67 season, making his home debut at the Victoria Ground in a 3–1 win over his former club Leicester.|$|E
500|$|The Portuguese {{colony of}} Macau was also struck. While Portugal was neutral, the colony's {{government}} {{had been forced}} to accept the presence of Japanese [...] "advisers" [...] since 1943 and had traded weapons for food supplies. The main target of the raid was a stockpile of aviation fuel at the Macau Naval Aviation Center which the Allies had learned was to be sold to the Japanese. The fort of Dona Maria II was also attacked, possibly to destroy a radio station located within or near it, and some damage was inflicted on civilian areas and the city's harbor. An official court of inquiry was subsequently conducted to investigate this violation of Portugal's neutrality, and the US Government apologized for the incident. In 1950 the United States provided Portugal with a $US 20.3 million <b>compensation</b> <b>payment</b> for the damage caused to Macau's harbor on 16 January and other accidental raids on 11 and 25 June 1945.|$|E

For each group of measures, the logarithmic transformations of cumulative payments received (comp, org, int, for) were used to estimate the policy impacts on HNV.|$|R

2500|$|Even when a {{woman was}} convicted, the {{punishment}} was comparatively mild; the death penalty (for all crimes) was abolished in 40 AD, and adulteresses were flogged instead.
