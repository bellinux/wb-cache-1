Our empirical study is conducted through a multivariate analysis that shows the intensity of lobbying by considering participation in the three <b>consultation</b> <b>periods.</b> The results show that the intensity of lobbying is associated with size, profitability, age, industry and managerial ownership. The evidence can be used to predict lobbying behaviour. The research has implications for standard setters and contributes to prior lobbying research...|$|R

40|$|PURPOSE There are few {{valid data}} that {{describe}} {{the extent of}} multimorbidity in primary care patients. The {{purpose of this study}} was to estimate its prevalence in family practice patients by counting the number of chronic medical conditions and using a measure that considers the severity of these conditions, the Cumula-tive Illness Rating Scale (CIRS). METHODS The study was carried out in the Saguenay region (Québec, Canada) in 2003. The participation of adult patients from 21 family physicians was solicited during consecutive <b>consultation</b> <b>periods.</b> A research nurse reviewed medical records and extracted the data regarding chronic illnesses. For each chronic condition, a severity rating was determined in accordance with the CIRS scoring guidelines. RESULTS The sample consisted of 320 men and 660 women. Overall, 9 of 10 patients had more than 1 chronic condition. The prevalence of having 2 or more medical conditions in the 18 - to 44 -year, 45 - to 64 -year, and 65 -year and older age-groups was, respectively, 68 %, 95 %, and 99 % among women and 72 %, 89 %, and 97 % among men. The mean number of conditions and mean CIRS score also increased signifi cantly with age. CONCLUSIONS Whether measured by simply counting the number of conditions or using the CIRS, the prevalence of multimorbidity is quite high and increases signifi cantly with age in both men and women. Patients with multimorbidity seen in family practice represent the rule rather than the exception...|$|R
40|$|This article {{identifies}} 8 key {{lessons for}} those States contemplating {{a free trade}} agreement with the United States (U. S.) arising from Australia’s experience. The standards of intellectual property protection under the Australia-U. S. Free Trade Agreement and their impact on pharmaceutical prices in Australia are a particular focus. Prospective parties must first conduct a national interest self-assessment which reviews the desired strength of intellectual property protection under national law and their preference for using flexibilities available to them under the existing international intellectual property rights framework. The United States negotiates free trade agreements in light of previous ones, negotiating outcomes obtained in other fora and the decisions of international trade tribunals. Negotiations typically occur behind closed doors, which is a process having adverse implications for transparent decision-making, public <b>consultation</b> <b>periods</b> and contributions from interested non-governmental actors. A concluded agreement will build on prior treaties and influence the course of future international arrangements. But the impact of a United States free trade agreement is not always clear, including {{because of a lack of}} reliable data, and the extent of national legal change is a contested issue given existing reform agendas and external influences. The United States seek to redesign national health care systems in its own image and had little success in Australia’s case. National legal systems need not be harmonised: although there can be some convergence in intellectual property rights regimes, significant differences may also remain. Negotiators must reconcile competing cultures, philosophies and perspectives between States for {{a free trade agreement}} to be worthwhile...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background The Disease Burden Morbidity Assessment (DBMA) is a self-report {{questionnaire}} {{used to estimate}} the disease burden experienced by patients. The {{aim of this study}} was to test and to measure the properties of the French translation of the DBMA (DBMA-Fv). Methods The original version of the DBMA was translated into French (Canadian) and first assessed during cognitive interviews. In the validation study, patients recruited during consecutive <b>consultation</b> <b>periods</b> completed the DBMA-Fv questionnaire while they were in the waiting room of a primary care setting (T 1). Participants completed the same questionnaire mailed to their home two weeks later (T 2). Concomitant validity of the DBMA-Fv was assessed using the Cumulative Illness Rating Scale (CIRS). Patient medical records were reviewed to verify chronic diseases and past medical history. Results Ninety-seven patients were recruited and 85 (88 %) returned the mailed questionnaires; 5 (5. 9 %) were incomplete. DBMA-Fv scores of the 80 participants with a complete questionnaire at T 2 ranged from 0 to 30 (median 5. 5, mean 7. 7, SD = 7. 0). Test-retest reliability of the DBMA-Fv was high (ICC: 0. 86, 95 % CI: 0. 79 - 0. 92). The DBMA-Fv and the CIRS correlated moderately at T 1 (r = 0. 46, 95 % CI: 0. 26 - 0. 62, p p Conclusions The DBMA-Fv's properties are similar to its English counterpart as to its median sensitivity and specificity compared to chart reviews. It correlated moderately with an established index of multimorbidity. A high percentage of patients were able to complete the test correctly as a mail questionnaire and it showed high test-retest reliability. </p...|$|R

40|$|M. Tech. (Chiropractic) Aim: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the effects of chiropractic adjustment therapy (CAT) to the cervical spine on the reflex motorneuron excitability of C 5 and C 6 nerves on the biceps brachii muscle bilaterally. This study was also aimed at measuring the subsequent increase in strength of the biceps brachii muscle. Method: A selection of 30 participants, male or female and between the ages of 18 and 40 were recruited. Participants had to meet all the inclusion criteria and present with no contra-indications. Only one group was used as each participant served as their own control. Participants were seen seven times over a period of three weeks. The measurements were taken during the 1 st, 4 th and 7 th consultations. On the 2 nd, 3 rd, 5 th and 6 th consultations only treatment was applied. On the 7 th consultation only data was collected and no treatment was done. Results: Statistically significant improvement of dynamometry and electromyographic measurements were noted over the <b>consultation</b> <b>periods</b> on both sides. No conclusion could be made regarding the comparison of dynamometer and sEMG measurements of the biceps brachii between each consultation and between each side (left and right) over the study period. Conclusion: Based on the results obtained in this research it may be deduced that CAT may have an effect on the neurological system and further more an effect by increasing motorneuron excitability at sites distant to the spine itself. These results are important to the Chiropractic profession as it shows that CAT does not only produce a segmental response, but that there are wide spread effects on structures distant to the spinal column. The extent of the effects CAT can elicit on the nervous system requires further investigation...|$|R

40|$|Flood risk {{management}} is increasingly seeking to involve local stakeholders in decision-making, both to harness {{and benefit from}} their tacit knowledge and to devolve responsibility for delivering local-scale, individual and community responses. Current techniques used in flood {{risk management}} centre on a techno-scientific approach, which is well-suited to appraising and modelling hazard, but often inaccessible to those without specialist, technical expertise. This leads to participation that is often limited to infrequent <b>consultation</b> <b>periods,</b> keeping local stakeholders at {{the periphery of the}} decision-making process. Their absence from the more technical elements of the process can leave local stakeholders struggling to understand how different options have been identified, appraised and/or prioritised. This can in turn lead to dissatisfaction with process outcomes, lack of support for selected options, and foster distrust in expert practitioners. This thesis explores how participatory modelling techniques could complement current approaches, facilitating the co-production of models with local stakeholders that explore social constructions of risk, and the vulnerability of different receptors. It identifies the qualities that are sought from participation, including the need to remain highly accessible, yet sufficiently robust to capture the complexities encountered when working at the interface of social and physical systems. Reporting on two UK case studies, it exemplifies the benefits that two popular techniques, Bayesian networks and system dynamics, can deliver at different stages in the flood risk decision-making process. In each case, the effectiveness of the participatory approach is assessed using an evaluative framework that advances current approaches by including an early assessment of context, as well as a detailed exploration of substantive (user-defined goals), and social change outcomes. The holistic nature of the evaluation framework, and its population with practical criteria bespoke to flood risk management, enhance its transferability between different contexts. The thesis finds that participatory modelling techniques support the collating of diffuse tacit knowledge, building of consensus, strengthening of social networks, and the empowerment of local citizens to become volunteer risk managers; provided that process managers are willing to simplify the techniques to maintain accessibility, and be open to different metrics of success...|$|R
