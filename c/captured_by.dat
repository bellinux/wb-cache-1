40|$|In this paper, the {{methodology}} of non-equilibrium thermodynamics is introduced for kinetics research of CO 2 <b>capture</b> <b>by</b> ionic liquids, and the following three key scientific problems are proposed to apply {{the methodology}} in kinetics research of CO 2 <b>capture</b> <b>by</b> ionic liquids: reliable thermodynamic models, interfacial transport rate description and accurate experimental flux. The obtaining of accurate experimental flux requires reliable experimental kinetics data and the effective transport area in the CO 2 <b>capture</b> process <b>by</b> ionic liquids. Research advances in the three key scientific problems are reviewed systematically and further work is analyzed. Finally, perspectives of non-equilibrium thermodynamic research of the kinetics of CO 2 <b>capture</b> <b>by</b> ionic liquids are proposed. Validerad; 2012; 20120213 (xiajix...|$|R
