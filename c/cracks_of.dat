5|$|Cracked tooth {{syndrome}} {{refers to}} a highly variable set of pain-sensitivity symptoms that may accompany a tooth fracture, usually sporadic, sharp pain that occurs during biting or with release of biting pressure, or relieved by releasing pressure on the tooth. The term is falling into disfavor and {{has given way to}} the more generalized description of fractures and <b>cracks</b> <b>of</b> the tooth, which allows for the wide variations in signs, symptoms, and prognosis for traumatized teeth. A fracture of a tooth can involve the enamel, dentin, and/or pulp, and can be orientated horizontally or vertically. Fractured or cracked teeth can cause pain via several mechanisms, including dentin hypersensitivity, pulpitis (reversible or irreversible), or periodontal pain. Accordingly, there is no single test or combination of symptoms that accurately diagnose a fracture or crack, although when pain can be stimulated by causing separation of the cusps of the tooth, it's highly suggestive of the disorder. Vertical fractures can be very difficult to identify because the crack can rarely be probed or seen on radiographs, as the fracture runs in the plane of conventional films (similar to how the split between two adjacent panes of glass is invisible when facing them).|$|E

Compared with the thermal cracking process, the catalytic <b>cracking</b> <b>of</b> this microalga displayed higher selectivity for and greater yield of these olefins. The catalytic <b>cracking</b> <b>of</b> extracted lipids and the corresponding residues of the microalga was also examined, and the results showed that the lipids could be efficiently converted to light olefins. The catalytic <b>cracking</b> <b>of</b> lipids extracted by different solvents demonstrated that neutral lipids gave the highest yield of light olefins at 36. 7 %. The yields of light olefins obtained from catalytic <b>cracking</b> <b>of</b> the extraction residues were much lower than the yields obtained from lipids, and thus the lipids, especially the neutral lipids, are the primary contributors to the generation of light olefins. Isochrysis zhanjiangensis with an elevated neutral lipid content will therefore give the highest yield of light olefins through catalytic cracking.

25|$|The One Ring possessed {{something}} of a will of its own. Its only accepted master was Sauron himself, and it would seek to leave any other bearer when it would cause the greatest harm, or when it might return to Sauron. Bilbo warned Frodo of this, and Frodo kept it on a chain {{so that it would}} not slip off unnoticed. In the end, Gollum succumbs to the malevolent influence of the ring, defies Frodo, and takes the ring for himself. While dancing with joy over the recovery of the ring, Gollum falls into the <b>Cracks</b> <b>of</b> Doom in Orodruin, where the ring is destroyed.

When the Ring is destroyed, Sauron loses his power forever. The Nazgûl perish, and his armies are thrown into such disarray that Aragorn's forces emerge victorious.|$|E

Harrison's many pieces featuring clusters include Pacifika Rondo (1963), Concerto for Organ with Percussion (1973), Piano Concerto (1983–85), Three Songs for male chorus (1985), Grand Duo (1988), and Rhymes with Silver (1996).|$|E

500|$|E. H. Carr {{writes of}} Dostoevsky's {{character}} the young student Raskolnikov {{in the novel}} Crime and Punishment who decides to murder a 'vile and loathsome' old woman money lender {{on the principle of}} transcending conventional morals: [...] "the sequel reveals to us not the pangs of a stricken conscience (which a less subtle writer would have given us) but the tragic and fruitless struggle of a powerful intellect to maintain a conviction which is incompatible with the essential nature of man." [...] Hermann Hesse wrote his Siddhartha to describe how a young man in the time of the Buddha follows his conscience on a journey to discover a transcendent inner space where all things could be unified and simply understood, ending up discovering that personal truth through selfless service as a ferryman. J. R. R. Tolkien in his epic The Lord of the Rings describes how only the hobbit Frodo is pure enough in conscience to carry the ring of power through war-torn Middle-earth to destruction in the <b>Cracks</b> <b>of</b> Doom, Frodo determining at the end to journey without weapons, and being saved from failure by his earlier decision to spare the life of the creature Gollum. Conor Cruise O'Brien wrote that Albert Camus was the writer most representative of the Western consciousness and conscience in its relation to the non-Western world. Harper Lee's To Kill a Mockingbird portrays Atticus Finch (played by Gregory Peck in the classic film from the book (see To Kill a Mockingbird (film))) as a lawyer true to his conscience who sets an example to his children and community.|$|E
