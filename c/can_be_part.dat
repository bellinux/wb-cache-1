5|$|Survival horror is a subgenre {{of video}} games {{inspired}} by horror fiction {{that focuses on}} survival of the character as the game tries to frighten players with either horror graphics or scary ambience. Although combat <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>part</b> of the gameplay, the player is made to feel less in control than in typical action games through limited ammunition, health, speed and vision, or through various obstructions of the player's interaction with the game mechanics. The player is also challenged to find items that unlock the path to new areas and solve puzzles to proceed in the game. Games make use of strong horror themes, like dark maze-like environments and unexpected attacks from enemies.|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that lichen planus may respond to stress, where lesions may present during times of stress. Lichen planus <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>part</b> of Grinspan's syndrome.|$|E
25|$|In some situations, nudity {{is imposed}} on a person. For example, imposed nudity (full or partial) <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>part</b> of a {{corporal}} punishment or as humiliation, especially when administered in public. In fact, torture manuals have distinguished between {{the male and}} female psychological aversion to self-exposure versus being disrobed.|$|E
50|$|Activity therapies, {{also called}} {{recreation}} therapy and occupational therapy, promote healing through active engagement. Making crafts <b>can</b> <b>be</b> a <b>part</b> of occupational therapy. Walks <b>can</b> <b>be</b> a <b>part</b> of recreation therapy.|$|R

25|$|Semantically, resultative constructions <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>part</b> {{of one of}} {{four major}} classes: causative, non-causative, {{property}} or path resultatives. These classes are distinguished by {{the relation between the}} noun phrase undergoing the change expressed by the resultative (referred to as the host) and the resultative construction itself.|$|E
25|$|The new {{regional}} teams {{are allowed to}} recruit five players from the old department sides, of whom four <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>part</b> of the playing XI. In a bid to give bowlers exposure to internationally recognised cricket balls, the board has also made the use of Kookaburra balls mandatory for the tournament.|$|E
25|$|In some societies, {{especially}} tribal societies, cannibalism is {{a cultural}} norm. Consumption of a person from within the same community is called endocannibalism; ritual cannibalism of the recently deceased <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>part</b> of the grieving process or {{be seen as a}} way of guiding the souls of the dead into the bodies of living descendants.|$|E
30|$|The {{parts of}} the system <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>parts</b> in the {{physical}} sense or they <b>can</b> <b>be</b> processes. A system <b>can</b> <b>be</b> formed of both (i.e. different {{parts of the}} system; a reactor and a regenerator combined to form a fluid catalytic cracking unit) [16], each part having a number of processes taking place within its boundaries.|$|R

25|$|The {{capacity}} of a reliable renewable power supply, can be fulfilled {{by the use of}} backup or extra infrastructure and technology, using mixed renewables to produce electricity above the intermittent average, which may be utilised to meet regular and unanticipated supply demands. Additionally, the storage of energy to fill the shortfall intermittency or for emergencies <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>part</b> of a reliable power supply.|$|E
25|$|Mutual {{masturbation}} involves two or {{more people}} who sexually stimulate each other, usually with the hands. It can be practiced by people of any sexual orientation, and <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>part</b> of other sexual activity. It {{may be used as}} foreplay, or as an alternative to sexual penetration. When used as an alternative to penile-vaginal penetration, the goal may be to preserve virginity or to avoid risk of pregnancy.|$|E
25|$|In the Eucharist or Holy Communion service, the Book of Common Prayer {{specifies}} that {{bread and}} wine are consecrated for consumption by the people. A valid communion is made in either species, so those wishing for whatever reason to avoid alcohol can decline the cup and still make a valid communion. A Eucharist <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>part</b> of a wedding to celebrate a sacramental marriage and of a funeral as a thank offering (sacrifice) to God and for {{the comfort of the}} mourners.|$|E

25|$|One of {{the primary}} ways to improve energy {{conservation}} in buildings is to use an energy audit. An energy audit is an inspection and analysis of energy use and flows for energy conservation in a building, process or system {{to reduce the amount}} of energy input into the system without negatively affecting the output(s). This is normally accomplished by trained professionals and <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>part</b> of some of the national programs discussed above. In addition, recent development of smartphone apps enable homeowners to complete relatively sophisticated energy audits themselves.|$|E
25|$|It is {{possible}} for metal objects to be microwave-oven compatible, although experimentation by users is not encouraged. Microwaving an individual smooth metal object without pointed ends, for example, a spoon or shallow metal pan, usually does not produce sparking. Thick metal wire racks <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>part</b> of the interior design in microwave ovens (see illustration). In a similar way, the interior wall plates with perforating holes which allow light and air into the oven, and allow interior-viewing through the oven door, are all made of conductive metal formed in a safe shape.|$|E
25|$|The most {{frequent}} neurological origin of micropsia {{is a result}} of temporal lobe seizures. These seizures affect the entire visual field of the patient. More rarely, micropsia <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>part</b> of purely visual seizures. This in turn only affects one half of the visual field and is accompanied by other cerebral visual disturbances. The most common cause of seizures which produce perceptual disturbances such as micropsia and macropsia is medial temporal lobe epilepsy in which the seizures originate in the amygdala-hippocampus complex. Micropsia often occurs as an aura signalling a seizure in patients with medial temporal lobe epilepsy. Most auras last for a very short period, ranging from a few seconds to a few minutes.|$|E

25|$|ML-Rules {{is similar}} to React(C), but {{provides}} the added possibility of nesting: A component species of the model, with all its attributes, <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>part</b> of a higher-order component species. This enables ML-Rules to capture multi-level models that can bridge the gap between, for instance, a series of biochemical processes and the macroscopic behaviour of a whole cell or group of cells. For instance, Maus et al. have provided a proof-of-concept model of cell division in fission yeast that includes cyclin/cdc2 binding and activation, pheromone secretion and diffusion, cell division and movement of cells. Models specified in ML-Rules can be simulated using the James II simulation framework. A similar nested language to represent multi-level biological systems has been proposed by Oury and Plotkin.|$|E
25|$|Different {{positions}} on the field suit certain skill sets and body types, generally leading to players specialising in {{a limited number of}} positions. Each position has certain roles to play on the field, although most have been established through convention rather than law. During general play, {{as long as they are}} not offside, the players may be positioned anywhere on the field. It is during the set pieces, scrum and line-out, when the positions are enforced. At line-outs there must be at least two players from each team lined up five metres from where the ball crossed the side line. They form two straight lines next to each other and a player from the team awarded the line-out throws the ball between them. A player from each team stands two metres from the line-out and the opposing team must also have someone standing two metres from the player throwing the ball in. The remainder of the team not participating in the line-out must be positioned at least 10 metres back from the line-out. While anyone on the field <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>part</b> of a line-out, it is generally composed of forwards. The usual situation involves the hooker throwing the ball in, aiming for the locks that are lifted into the air by the props. The scrum-halves are usually positioned near the line-out ready to receive the ball once the forwards have gained possession.|$|E
