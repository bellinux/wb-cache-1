Emission factors for four pollutants (particulate matter, CO 2, total hydrocarbons, and NO x) were 2 - 4 times higher for bituminous coals than for anthracites.

40|$|The {{transport}} sector contributes significantly to global energy use and emissions {{due to its}} traditional dependency on fossil fuels. Climate change, {{security of energy supply}} and increasing mobility demand is mobilising governments around the challenges of sustainable transport. Immediate opportunities to reduce emissions exist through the adoption of new bus technologies, e. g. advanced powertrains. This thesis analysed energy use and carbon dioxide (CO 2) emissions of conventional, hybrid-electric, and plug-in hybrid-electric city buses including two-axle, articulated, and biarticulated chassis types (A total of 6 bus types) for the operation phase (Tank-to-Wheel) in Curitiba, Brazil. The systems analysis tool – Advanced Vehicle Simulator (ADVISOR) and a <b>carbon</b> <b>balance</b> <b>method</b> were applied. Seven bus routes and six operation times for each (i. e. 42 driving cycles) are considered based on real-world data. The results show that hybrid-electric and plug-in hybrid-electric two-axle city buses consume 30 % and 58 % less energy per distance (MJ/km) compared to a conventional two-axle city bus (i. e. 17. 46 MJ/km). Additionally, the energy use per passenger-distance (MJ/pkm) of a conventional biarticulated city bus amounts to 0. 22 MJ/pkm, which is 41 % and 24 % lower compared to conventional and hybrid-electric two-axle city buses, respectively. This is mainly due to the former’s large passenger carrying capacity. Large passenger carrying capacities can reduce energy use (MJ/pkm) if the occupancy rate of the city bus is sufficient high. Bus routes with fewer stops decrease energy use by 10 - 26 % depending on the city bus, because of reductions in losses from acceleration and braking. The CO 2 emissions are linearly proportional to the estimated energy use following from the <b>carbon</b> <b>balance</b> <b>method,</b> e. g. CO 2 emissions for a conventional two-axle city bus amount to 1299 g/km. Further results show that energy use of city bus operation depends on the operation time due to different traffic conditions and driving cycle characteristics. An additional analysis shows that energy use estimations can vary strongly between considered driving cycles from real-world data. The study concludes that advanced powertrains with electric drive capabilities, large passenger carrying capacities and bus routes with a fewer number of bus stops are beneficial in terms of reducing energy use and CO 2 emissions of city bus operation in Curitiba...|$|E

40|$|A growing {{literature}} is reporting {{on how the}} terrestrial carbon cycle is experiencing year-to-year variability because of climate anomalies and trends caused by global change. As CO 2 concentration records in the atmosphere exceed 50 years and as satellite records reach over 30 years in length, we are becoming better able to address carbon cycle variability and trends. Here we review how variable the carbon cycle is, how large the trends in its gross and net fluxes are, and how well the signal can be separated from noise. We explore mechanisms that explain year-to-year variability and trends by deconstructing the global carbon budget. The CO 2 concentration record is detecting {{a significant increase in}} the seasonal amplitude between 1958 and now. Inferential methods provide a variety of explanations for this result, but a conclusive attribution remains elusive. Scientists have reported that this trend is a consequence of the greening of the biosphere, stronger northern latitude photosynthesis, more photosynthesis by semi-arid ecosystems, agriculture and the green revolution, tropical temperature anomalies, or increased winter respiration. At the global scale, variability in the terrestrial carbon cycle can be due to changes in constituent fluxes, gross primary productivity, plant respiration and heterotrophic (microbial) respiration, and losses due to fire, land use change, soil erosion, or harvesting. It remains controversial whether or not there is a significant trend in global primary productivity (due to rising CO 2, temperature, nitrogen deposition, changing land use, and preponderance of wet and dry regions). The degree to which year-to-year variability in temperature and precipitation anomalies affect global primary productivity also remains uncertain. For perspective, interannual variability in global gross primary productivity is relatively small (on the order of 2 Pg-C y- 1) with respect to a large and uncertain background (123 +/- 4 Pg-C y- 1), and detected trends in global primary productivity are even smaller (33 Tg-C y- 2). Yet residual <b>carbon</b> <b>balance</b> <b>methods</b> infer that the terrestrial biosphere is experiencing a significant and growing carbon sink. Possible explanations for this large and growing net land sink include roles of land use change and greening of the land, regional enhancement of photosynthesis, and down regulation of plant and soil respiration with warming temperatures. Longer time series of variables needed to provide top-down and bottom-up assessments of the carbon cycle are needed to resolve these pressing and unresolved issues regarding how, why, and at what rates gross and net carbon fluxes are changing...|$|R
40|$|Summary We {{estimated}} carbon allocation to belowground {{processes in}} unfertilized and fertilized red pine (Pinus resinosa Ait.) plantations in northern Wisconsin {{to determine how}} soil fertility affects belowground allocation patterns. We used soil CO 2 efflux and litterfall measurements to estimate total below-ground carbon allocation (root production and root respiration) by the <b>carbon</b> <b>balance</b> <b>method,</b> established root-free trenched plots to examine treatment effects on microbial respiration, estimated fine root production by sequential coring, and devel-oped allometric equations to estimate coarse root production. Fine root production ranged from 150 to 284 g m- 2 year- 1 and was significantly lower for fertilized plots than for unfertilized plots. Coarse root production ranged from 60 to 90 g m- 2 year- 1 and was significantly lower for fertilized plots than for unfer-tilized plots. Annual soil CO 2 fluxes ranged from 331 to 541 g C m- 2 year- 1 and were significantly lower for fertilized plots than for unfertilized plots. Annual foliage litterfall ranged from 110 to 187 g C m- 2 year- 1 and was significantly greater for fertilized plots than for unfertilized plots. Total belowground carbon allocation ranged from 188 to 395 g C m- 2 year- 1 and was significantly lower for fertilized plots than for unfertilized plots. Annual soil CO 2 flux was lower for trenched plots than for untrenched plots but did not differ between fertilized and unfertilized trenched plots.

40|$|Air {{pollution}} measurements during April 1991 {{are reported}} from the Craeybeckx highway tunnel in Antwerp, Belgium. The tunnel was used daily {{by an average}} of 45, 000 vehicles, of which 60 % were gasoline fueled passenger cars, 20 % diesel cars, and 20 % trucks. Of the gasoline cars, only 3 % had three-way catalysts. Tunnel air concentrations of nitrogen oxides, sulphur dioxide, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, nonmethane hydrocarbons, volatile organic compounds, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, and lead are presented. The traffic emissions in the tunnel are calculated by the <b>carbon</b> <b>balance</b> <b>method,</b> which uses the increase of the total carbon concentration in the tunnel air as the reference quantity. Division of the concentration of any pollutant by the total carbon concentration gives emission factors per kilogram of carbon. These emission factors can be converted directly to emissions relative to fuel consumption or per kilometer. The fraction of diesel used in the tunnel was derived from sulphur to carbon ratios in tunnel air. A calculation procedure with breakdown of emission factors according to vehicle categories was used to estimate countrywide emissions. The estimated emissions were compared to results from the Flanders Emissions Inventory [Emissie Inventaris Vlaamse Regio (EIVR) ] and calculated emissions according to the emission factors proposed by the European Commissions CORINAIR Working Group. For NOx there is excellent agreement. For carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons, the tunnel data produced higher emissions than the CORINAIR model would predict but lower than the official EIVR statistics. The estimated lead emissions from traffic are found to be 22 to 29 % of the lead in gasoline. - Environ Healt...|$|E
40|$|We {{study the}} PM 2. 5 and {{ultrafine}} exhaust emissions {{from a new}} natural gas-fired turbine power facility to better understand air pollution in California. To characterize the emissions from new natural gas turbines, {{a series of tests}} were performed on a GE LMS 100 gas turbine. These tests included PM 2. 5 and wet chemical tests for SO 2 /SO 3 and NH 3, as well as ultrafine (less than 100 nm in diameter) particulate matter measurements. The turbine exhaust had an average particle number concentration that was 2. 3 x 103 times higher than ambient air. The majority of these particles were nanoparticles; at the 100 nm size, stack particle concentrations were about 20 times higher than ambient, and increased to 3. 9 x 104 times higher on average in the 2. 5 - 3 nm particle size range. This study also found that ammonia emissions were higher than expected, but in compliance with permit conditions. This was possibly due to an ammonia imbalance entering the catalyst, some flue gas bypassing the catalyst, or not enough catalyst volume. SO 3 accounted for an average of 23 % of the total sulfur oxides emissions measured. Some of the SO 3 is formed in the combustion process, {{it is likely that the}} majority formed as the SO 2 in the combustion products passed across the oxidizing CO catalyst and SCR catalyst. The 100 MW turbine sampled in this study emitted particle loadings similar to those previously measured from turbines in the SCAQMD area, however, the turbine exhaust contained far more particles than ambient air. The power consumed by an air conditioner accounts for a significant fraction of the total power used by hybrid and electric vehicles especially during summer. This study examined the effect of recirculation of cabin air on power consumption of mobile air conditioners both in-lab and on-road. Real time power consumption and vehicle mileage were recorded by an On Board Diagnostic monitor and <b>carbon</b> <b>balance</b> <b>method.</b> Vehicle mileage improved with increased cabin air recirculation.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the fate and toxicity of total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPH), polyacrylamide and acrylamide monomer in soil under aerobic conditions for mixtures of commercially available products that have application as an anti traction material (ATM) (Southwest Research Institute patent pending for ATM). The aerobic biodegradability of petroleum hydrocarbons in several formulations was determined using a simple microcosm/respirometric method based on carbon dioxide production and TPH depletion. The microcosms consisted of 1 L mason jars fitted with sealed rubber caps that allowed headspace gas samples to be collected in a sealed system. The analytical procedure included the detection of peaks for the compounds in TPH by gas chromatography and identification of peaks with a mass spectrometer (GCMS). Mole fractions of the major components in TPH (undecane, dodecane, tridecane and tetradecane) were calculated from the detected peaks. The extracted soil was analyzed for total organic carbon (TOC) content in order to examine the <b>carbon</b> <b>balance.</b> The <b>method</b> described here provides a simple and inexpensive method for determining the aerobic biodegradability of organics in soil. Results indicated that, for the polyacrylamide (PAM) treatments in soil, there was no significant CO 2 production in the headspace of the microcosm within the experimental time period. Total organic carbon values obtained for the initial and final soil showed no significant PAM biodegradation within a time period of 161 days. This confirms that PAM biodegradation is a slow process and may take several years...|$|R
40|$|To enable {{continued}} {{development and}} facilitate {{the adoption of}} new internal combustion engine technologies, the accuracy and repeatability of measurement methods used for verification need to be improved upon. A variety of methods are available for the measurement of fuel consumption based on the volumetric or gravimetric principle or by equating carbon in the fuel to carbon in the exhaust flow. Measurements of fuel consumption from five different experimental campaigns with varying engine set-ups are presented, highlighting discrepancies between gravimetric fuel balance and exhaust feed gas <b>carbon</b> <b>balance.</b> Differences were larger for cold-start tests and if all correction factors are neglected offsets can reach 7 per cent. The <b>carbon</b> <b>balance</b> and gravimetric <b>methods</b> have been considered independently to identify sources of inaccuracy and improvements have been suggested {{in the form of}} correction factors. The <b>carbon</b> <b>balance</b> estimate is dependent on a number of separate measurements, all taken at different conditions. To account for these, two correction factors were compared, the first proposed by the British Standards Institution and the second derived from the experimental conditions of each of the measurements. The gravimetric measurement was affected by changes in fuel temperature within the fuelling circuit and a corrective method was proposed based on the change in fuel density. When correction factors were applied to each of the measurement techniques for the five experimental campaigns, discrepancies were less than 1 per cent, which, in most cases, was small enough for there to be no statistically significant difference between measurements. In addition, in some cases the scatter of results was reduced, contributing to improved test-to-test repeatability. The improved performance when using correction factors was explained by including known disturbances, such as fuel temperature and ambient humidity, as inputs to the measurement system...|$|R
40|$|Mobile sources {{contribute}} significantly to air pollution problems. Relevant pollutants include numerous gaseous and particle-phase species that can affect human health, ecosystems, and climate. Accurate inventories of emissions from these sources are needed to help understand possible adverse impacts, and to develop effective air quality management strategies. Unfortunately large uncertainties persist {{in the understanding of}} mobile source emissions, and how these emissions are changing over time. There are more than two hundred million motor vehicles operating in the United States alone, and measurements of emissions from these sources are sparse. Pollutant emission factor distributions are becoming increasingly skewed, and this continually increases the needed vehicle sample size in studies that seek to quantify fleet-average vehicle emission rates. This dissertation aims to evaluate long-term trends in mobile source emissions in the United States, and to make detailed measurements of emissions from present-day fleets of on-road vehicles operating in California. Novel features of this work include studies of the in-use effectiveness of modern control technologies used to reduce diesel engine emissions, and application of advanced instrumentation to measure emissions from large numbers of on-road gasoline and diesel vehicles at high time resolution and {{with a high level of}} chemical and physical detail. Long-term trends in mobile source emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx) and fine particulate matter (PM 2. 5) in the United States were investigated through development of a fuel-based emission inventory. Annual emissions from on- and off-road gasoline and diesel engines were quantified for the years 1996 - 2006. Diesel engines were found to be the dominant mobile source of NOx and PM 2. 5, and on-road diesel vehicles were identified as the single largest anthropogenic source of NOx emissions in the United States as of 2005. The relative importance of diesel engines as a source of NOx grew over the ten-year time period considered here, while emissions from gasoline engines declined due to increased effectiveness and use of three-way catalytic converters. A comparison with national emission inventory estimates for 2005 found substantial differences in source contributions to overall mobile source emissions, with larger contributions from on-road diesel engines indicated in this study. The importance of diesel engines as a source of exhaust particulate matter emissions has led to the recent introduction of advanced emission control technologies in the United States, such as diesel particle filters (DPF), which have been required since 2007 for all new on-road heavy-duty (HD) diesel engines. In addition to national requirements for the use of such control devices on new engines, California has mandated accelerated clean-up of statewide emissions from older in-use diesel engines. This goal is to be achieved through filter retrofit and truck/engine replacement programs. This dissertation uses measurements of emissions from in-use HD diesel trucks at the Port of Oakland to evaluate the impacts of a DPF retrofit and truck replacement program. A plume capture method was developed to quantify black carbon (BC) and NOx emission factors for individual trucks and to characterize emission factor distributions. A comparison of emissions measured before and after the implementation of the truck retrofit/replacement rule shows a 54 ± 11 % reduction in the fleet-average BC emission factor, accompanied by a shift to a more highly skewed emission factor distribution. Although only particulate matter mass reductions were required in the first phase of the program, a 41 ± 5 % reduction in the fleet-average NOx emission factor was observed. These results provide an in-use/real-world assessment of the impact of DPF emission control systems, and a preview of emissions changes that may be expected from the extension of similar control programs to the entire HD truck fleet in California beginning in 2014. The plume capture method was further applied to measure emissions from a more diverse population of trucks observed at the Caldecott tunnel in summer 2010. Emissions from hundreds of individual trucks were measured, and emission factor distributions were characterized for nitric oxide (NO), nitrogen dioxide (NO 2), carbon monoxide (CO), formaldehyde, BC, as well as optical properties of the emitted particles. Emission factor distributions for all species were skewed, with a small fraction of trucks contributing disproportionately to total emissions. For example, half of the total measured NO 2 and BC were produced by only 10 % of the total measurements. Total NOx and formaldehyde showed less skewed emission factor distributions compared to CO and BC. Emission factors for NO 2 were found to be anti-correlated with all other pollutants considered here. Also, the fleet-average NO 2 emission factor increased 34 ± 18 % relative to the corresponding value measured at the same location in 2006. These findings confirm that the use of catalyzed DPF systems is leading to increased primary NO 2 emissions. Absorption and scattering cross-section emission factors were used to calculate the aerosol single scattering albedo (SSA, at 532 nm) for individual truck exhaust plumes, which averaged 0. 14 ± 0. 03. This value of aerosol SSA is very low compared to typical values (0. 90 - 0. 99) observed in ambient air studies. It is indicative of a strongly light-absorbing aerosol, due to the high BC emissions that are a characteristic feature of diesel exhaust PM emissions. Measurements at the Caldecott tunnel also included efforts to quantify light-duty (LD) gasoline vehicle emission factors, and further investigation of the relative contributions of on-road gasoline and diesel engines to air pollutant emissions. Measurements of CO, NOx, PM 2. 5, BC, and organic aerosol (OA) were made in a tunnel traffic bore where LD vehicles account for > 99 % of total traffic. Measured pollutant concentrations were apportioned between LD gasoline vehicles and diesel trucks, and fleet-average emission factors were quantified for LD gasoline vehicles using a <b>carbon</b> <b>balance</b> <b>method.</b> Diesel trucks contributed 18 ± 3, 22 ± 5, 44 ± 8 % of measured NOx, OA, and BC concentrations, respectively, despite accounting for < 1 % of total vehicles. Consequently, methods that do not explicitly account for diesel truck contributions tend to overestimate fleet-average LD gasoline vehicle emission factors for these species. Emission factors and overall fuel consumption for gasoline and diesel engines were used to describe the relative contributions of these sources to overall on-road vehicle emissions. Gasoline engines were found to be the dominant source of CO, an insignificant source of BC, and a relatively minor source of on-road OA emissions at urban, state, and national scales. Measurements at the Caldecott tunnel also featured use of a new high-resolution time-of-flight aerosol mass spectrometer, which was used to characterize the chemical composition of PM emitted by gasoline and diesel vehicles. Measurements of PM in the exhaust of individual HD trucks show a predominance of cyclyoalkane-derived ion signals relative to saturated alkane ion signals in the truck exhaust OA spectra, indicating that lubricating oil, rather than diesel fuel, was the dominant source of OA emitted by diesel trucks. This conclusion is supported by the presence of lubricant-derived trace elements in truck exhaust, emitted relative to total OA at levels that correspond to their weight fractions in bulk oil. Furthermore, comparison of mass spectra for sampling periods with varying levels of diesel influence found a high degree of similarity in the chemical composition of OA emitted by gasoline and diesel engines, suggesting a common lubricating oil rather than fuel-derived source for OA emissions...|$|E

40|$|Biomass burning (BB) is {{the second}} largest source of trace gases and the largest source of primary fine {{carbonaceous}} particles in the global troposphere. Many recent BB studies have provided new emission factor (EF) measurements. This {{is especially true for}} non methane organic compounds (NMOC), which influence secondary organic aerosol (SOA) and ozone formation. New EF should improve regional to global BB emissions estimates and therefore, the input for atmospheric models. In this work we present an up-to-date, comprehensive tabulation of EF for known pyrogenic species based on measurements made in smoke that has cooled to ambient temperature, but not yet undergone significant photochemical processing. All the emission factors are converted to one standard form (g compound emitted per kg dry biomass burned) using the <b>carbon</b> mass <b>balance</b> <b>method</b> and they are categorized into 14 fuel or vegetation types. We compile a large number of measurements of biomass consumption per unit area for important fire types and summarize several recent estimates of global biomass consumption by the major types of biomass burning. Biomass burning terminology is defined to promote consistency. Post emission processes are discussed to provide a context for the emission factor concept within overall atmospheric chemistry and also highlight the potential for rapid changes relative to the scale of some models or remote sensing products. Recent work shows that individual biomass fires emit significantly more gas-phase NMOC than previously thought and that including additional NMOC can improve photochemical model performance. A detailed global estimate suggests that BB emits at least 400 Tg yr− 1 of gas-phase NMOC, which is about 4 times larger than most previous estimates. Selected recent results (e. g. measurements of HONO and the BB tracers HCN and CH 3 CN) are highlighted and key areas requiring future research are briefly discussed...|$|R

40|$|Here, we {{evaluated}} how increased shading and declining net photosynthetic capacity regulate {{the decline in}} net <b>carbon</b> <b>balance</b> with increasing leaf age for 10 Australian woodland species. We also asked whether leaves {{at the age of}} their mean life-span have <b>carbon</b> <b>balances</b> that are positive, zero or negative. The net <b>carbon</b> <b>balances</b> of 2307 leaves on 53 branches of the 10 species were estimated. We assessed three-dimensional architecture, canopy openness, photosynthetic light response functions and dark respiration rate across leaf age sequences on all branches. We used YPLANT to estimate light interception and to model <b>carbon</b> <b>balance</b> along the leaf age sequences. As leaf age increased to the mean life-span, increasing shading and declining photosynthetic capacity each separately reduced daytime carbon gain by approximately 39 % on average across species. Together, they reduced daytime carbon gain by 64 % on average across species. At the age of their mean life-span, almost all leaves had positive daytime <b>carbon</b> <b>balances.</b> These per leaf carbon surpluses were of a similar magnitude to the estimated whole-plant respiratory costs per leaf. Thus, the results suggest that a whole-plant economic framework, including respiratory costs, may be useful in assessing controls on leaf longevity. 14 page(s...|$|R

40|$|The <b>carbon</b> <b>balance</b> of {{forestry}} {{depends on the}} management, assortment distribution of harvested wood, end use of products, harvesting and processing releases, and substitution effects. This study developed a simulation-optimization system in which all these elements were incorporated. The simulation model consisted of a typical tree stand growth simulator augmented with a decomposition model for calculating carbon releases from the decomposition of deadwood, cutting residues, and products. The model allows managers and policy makers to analyze the effects of carbon pricing, substitution rates and assortment distributions, among others, on the optimal stand management, and estimate the <b>carbon</b> <b>balances</b> of alternative management systems. The case study calculations showed that the long-term <b>carbon</b> <b>balance</b> of a managed forest is negative without substitution effects. Substitution effects may convert the balance from negative to positive. The <b>carbon</b> <b>balance</b> of pine forest is clearly better than that of spruce forest, which is {{mainly because of the}} poor <b>carbon</b> <b>balance</b> of spruce pulpwood. If there are no substitution effects, forest management is a carbon source with 0. 1 Â tÂ ha-Â  1 Â a-Â  1 of carbon releases from pine forestry, and 0. 5 Â tÂ ha-Â  1 Â a-Â  1 from spruce forestry. With low substitution rates (50 % of carbon in biofuel and 33 % of carbon in sawn wood replace fossil carbon), spruce is carbon-neutral and pine is a clear sink with 0. 38 Â tÂ ha-Â  1 Â a-Â  1 carbon sequestration. The same sink effect can be obtained in spruce forestry with a higher substitution rate (75 % of carbon in biofuel and 67 % of carbon in sawn wood replace fossil <b>carbon).</b> <b>Carbon</b> <b>balance</b> <b>Carbon</b> sequestration Carbon trade Decomposition model...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. We summed {{estimates}} of the <b>carbon</b> <b>balance</b> of forests, grasslands, arable lands and peatlands to obtain country-specific {{estimates of}} the terrestrial <b>carbon</b> <b>balance</b> during the 1990 s. Forests and grasslands were a net sink for carbon, whereas croplands were carbon sources in all Euro-pean countries. Hence, countries dominated by arable lands tended to be losing carbon from their terrestrial ecosystems, whereas forest-dominated countries tended to be sequester-ing carbon. In some countries, draining and extraction of peatlands caused substantial reductions in the net carbon bal-ance. Net terrestrial <b>carbon</b> <b>balances</b> were typically {{an order of magnitude}} smaller than the fossil fuel-related carbon emis-sions. Exceptions to this overall picture were countries where population density and industrialization are small. It is, how...|$|R
40|$|The {{accurate}} {{measurement of}} marine plankton production {{is required to}} constrain the global <b>carbon</b> <b>balance.</b> Traditional <b>methods</b> rely on bottle incubations, which are thought to underestimate plankton production. This study presents in situ measurements of gross oxygen production (G) derived from triple oxygen isotope analysis and of net community oxygen production (N) derived from O 2 /Ar ratios at station L 4, {{which is part of}} the Western English Channel Observatory (WECO) and a latitudinal transect through the subtropical gyres in the Atlantic Ocean in October/November 2010. G and N were determined at weekly intervals between September 2009 and September 2010 at station L 4. Annual N was positive (net autotrophic) at (0. 88 ± 0. 24) mol m- 2 a- 1 O 2. The triple oxygen isotope method overestimated G during winter months due to entrainment of waters from below the mixed layer. N of (3. 8 ± 3. 1) mmol m- 2 a- 1 O 2 in the North Atlantic Gyre (NAG) and (2. 9 ± 2. 4) mmol m- 2 a- 1 O 2 in the South Atlantic Gyre (SAG) show both gyres to be net autotrophic at the time of sampling. G values of (169 ± 106) mmol m- 2 a- 1 O 2 in the NAG and (250 ± 130) mmol m- 2 a- 1 O 2 in the SAG were higher than published results. Diapycnal mixing was found to contribute about 20 % to apparent mixed layer N in both gyres and to G in the NAG. In order to achieve these results, a gas extraction line was built and tested. A method to halt biological activity in triple oxygen isotope and discrete O 2 /Ar samples was assessed. Benzalkonium chloride was found to be a less toxic alternative to mercuric chloride on short time scales of three days. Our results of N agree with previous in situ productivity measurements in these regions and highlight the importance of including physical effects in the estimates of G...|$|R
