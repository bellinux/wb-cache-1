25|$|In 1956, the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad {{ordered a}} custom-built, six-car train set {{based on the}} RDC design named the Roger Williams. It {{consisted}} of two single-ended cab units and four intermediate cars to make a <b>complete</b> <b>train.</b> The units were fitted with third-rail shoes, electric traction motors, and associated gear for operation into Grand Central Terminal, though this was short-lived. In the New Haven's later years, the set was broken up, and used with regular New Haven RDCs, and by Amtrak into the 1980s.|$|E
500|$|... {{which might}} deter {{domestic}} passengers. Compounding {{the difficulties in}} providing a similar service are the Channel Tunnel safety rules, the major ones being the [...] "half-train rule" [...] and the [...] "length rule". The [...] "half-train rule" [...] stipulated that passenger trains {{had to be able}} to split in the case of emergency. Class 373 trains were designed as two half-sets, which when coupled form a <b>complete</b> <b>train,</b> enabling them to be split easily in the event of an emergency while in the tunnel, with the unaffected set able to be driven out. The half-train rule was finally abolished in May 2010. However, the [...] "length rule", which states that passenger trains must be at least 375 metres long with a through corridor (to match the distance between the safety doors in the tunnel), was retained, preventing any potential operators from applying to run services with existing fleets (the majority of both TGV and ICE trains are only 200m long).|$|E
60|$|Under Bulwana the waggons of the Boers {{and several}} hundred {{horsemen}} {{could be seen}} hurrying away. It was clearly our business to try to intercept them unless they had made good covering dispositions. Patrols were sent out in all directions, and a squadron of Thorneycroft's Mounted Infantry proceeded to Pieters Station, where a <b>complete</b> <b>train</b> of about twenty trucks had been abandoned by the enemy. While this reconnaissance was going on I climbed up Inniskilling Hill to examine the trenches. It was occupied by the East Surrey Regiment, and the soldiers were very eager to do the honours. They had several things to show: 'Come along here, sir; there's a bloke here without a head; took clean off, sir;' and were mightily disappointed that I would not let them remove the blanket which covered the grisly shape.|$|E

60|$|The {{army was}} drawn out, {{and in the}} act of forming column for march, or attack. The Duke was in the centre, nearly a mile from the place where Morton had passed the night. In riding towards the General, he had an {{opportunity}} of estimating the force which had been assembled for the suppression of the hasty and ill-concerted insurrection. There were three or four regiments of English, the flower of Charles's army--there were the Scottish Life-Guards, burning with desire to revenge their late defeat--other Scottish regiments of regulars were also assembled, and a large body of cavalry, consisting partly of gentlemen-volunteers, partly of the tenants of the crown who did military duty for their fiefs. Morton also observed several strong parties of Highlanders drawn from the points nearest to the Lowland frontiers, a people, as already mentioned, particularly obnoxious to the western whigs, and who hated and despised them in the same proportion. These were assembled under their chiefs, and made part of this formidable array. A <b>complete</b> <b>train</b> of field-artillery accompanied these troops; and the whole had an air so imposing, that it seemed nothing short of an actual miracle could prevent the ill-equipped, ill-modelled, and tumultuary army of the insurgents from being utterly destroyed. The officer who accompanied Morton endeavoured to gather from his looks the feelings with which this splendid and awful parade of military force had impressed him. But, true to the cause he had espoused, he laboured successfully to prevent the anxiety which he felt from appearing in his countenance, and looked around him on the warlike display as on a sight which he expected, and to which he was indifferent.|$|E

Six models of various EMD diesels made up the base of this initial offering through the 1980s. <b>Complete</b> <b>train</b> sets were first offered by Atlas in the 1970s, using the Roco-produced diesels and freight cars supplied by Athearn. Atlas later forged a partnership with Japanese manufacturer Kato Precision Railroad Models to release an Alco RS-3 in 1984 that raised standards in the hobby for fine scale fidelity.|$|E

For instance, it was simple to create a rule to make a train follow a straight segment of track but the number of rules quickly exploded when trying to have trains follow all combinations of turns and intersections. Semantic rewrite rules could interpret rules topologically. With a single rule a user could create a <b>complete</b> <b>train</b> that follows train track behavior.|$|E
50|$|In 1882, the F&PM {{railroad}} {{company had}} built two wooden freighters to replace John Sherman. They were numbered #1 and #2 and shuttled packaged freight, bulk grain, and passengers between Ludington and Milwaukee.

The railroad company fleet of steamers started carrying <b>complete</b> <b>train</b> freight cars in 1896 and became Pere Marquette Railroad's train ferry fleetâ€”largest in the world by 1905. This ultimately became the Chesapeake and Ohio's Lake Michigan fleet, the world's largest and fastest lake carferries.|$|E
50|$|Just {{before the}} service was finally withdrawn, it was {{estimated}} by one expert to The Sunday Times that only one European produced locomotive could have hauled and powered a fully laden Nightstar - and that the locomotive was not due into production for another two years, would not fit the British loading gauge, and would draw too much power from a single section, thus requiring it to have special clearance while operating. The article concluded that the only pair of locomotives available to power and move the <b>complete</b> <b>train</b> was the Eurostar modified TGV power car.|$|E
