60|$|As the man's hand {{approached}} his neck, White Fang bristled and snarled and crouched down. But while he eyed the approaching hand, he {{at the same}} time contrived {{to keep track of the}} club in the other hand, suspended threateningly above him. Matt unsnapped the chain from the <b>collar</b> and <b>stepped</b> back.|$|R
50|$|The notched lapel (American English), step lapel or <b>step</b> <b>collar</b> (British English) is sewn to {{the collar}} at an angle, {{creating}} a step effect. This {{is the standard}} on single-breasted suits, and is used on nearly all suit jackets, blazers, and sports jackets. The notched lapel double-breasted jacket is a rare setting. The size of the notch can vary, and a small notch is called fishmouth. This was the first type of lapel to appear.|$|R
50|$|Waistcoats may {{be either}} single-breasted with, or without, lapels or {{double-breasted}} with lapels. Single-breasted models with lapels usually feature a <b>step</b> <b>collar,</b> whilst double-breasted models commonly have either a shawl collar or a peak lapel. Sometimes a white slip is worn, {{which is a}} strip of fabric buttoned to the inside top of the waistcoat to simulate {{the effect of a}} paler under-waistcoat, though the actual wearing of two waistcoats was obsolete even for the late Victorians.|$|R
50|$|Steven M. Biskupic (born March 26, 1961) is {{a former}} U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Wisconsin serving under Attorneys General John Ashcroft, Alberto Gonzales and Michael Mukasey. He was {{appointed}} by George W. Bush in May 2002. Prior to his appointment, Biskupic served as an Assistant U.S. Attorney for 13 years, specializing in the prosecution of white <b>collar</b> crime. Biskupic <b>stepped</b> down in 2008. He is now a partner at Michael Best & Friedrich in Milwaukee.|$|R
40|$|The sodium monofluoroacetate (Compound 1080) Livestock Protection Collar is {{selective}} for individual predators attacking {{the throat of}} sheep or goats and is especially useful in taking coyotes (Canis latrans). However, fears of secondary and nontarget poisonings have resulted in restrictions on their use. They are registered {{for use in the}} United States only to kill coyotes. To satisfy U. S. Environmental Protection Agency requirements, the Texas Department of Agriculture provides training and testing for certifying collar applicators, and has monitored collar use from 1988 through 1990. During this period, 59 licensed applicators, 6 collar pools, and the Texas Animal Damage Control Service obtained collars. Information on effectiveness in taking coyotes and the fate of collars was collected through applicator reporting, inspections, surveys, and discussions with applicators. Sixty-two applicators used collars during the 3 -year period for a total of 89, 649 collar use-days. The number of coyotes killed by collars has been conservatively estimated to be 92. The only reported incident of suspected nontarget poisoning involved a lamb wearing a collar that was ruptured by an undetermined cause. Also described in the paper are targeting strategies, organization of <b>collar</b> pools, <b>steps</b> taken to reduce controversy, and the suitability of collars for combatting coyote predation on farm flocks in the eastern United States...|$|R
6000|$|Another warder put the [...] "lad before him" [...] {{into the}} room, and, both withdrawing, bolt crashed and chain clanged, as they {{replaced}} these ponderous obstacles to freedom. The boy was {{clad in a}} grey suit of the finest cloth, laid down with silver lace, with a buff-coloured cloak of the same pattern. His cap, which was a Montero of black velvet, was pulled over his brows, and, with the profusion of his long ringlets, almost concealed his face. He stood on the very spot where the warder had quitted his <b>collar,</b> about two <b>steps</b> from {{the door of the}} apartment, his eyes fixed on the ground, and every joint trembling with confusion and terror. Nigel could well have dispensed with his society, but it was not in his nature to behold distress, whether of body or mind, without endeavouring to relieve it.|$|R
50|$|The name {{originated}} from {{the practice of}} gentlemen {{in the nineteenth century}} riding a horse in the morning with a cutaway front, single breasted morning coat. The modern twentieth century morning dress was originally a more casual form of half dress, but as the nineteenth century progressed it gradually became acceptable to wear it in more formal situations instead of a frock coat. In the Edwardian era it took over in popularity from the frock coat as the standard daytime form of men's full dress. When it was regarded as a more casual coat, it was common to see it made with <b>step</b> <b>collars</b> (notched lapels in American English), but as it took over from the frock coat in formality it began to be made with the more formal pointed lapels (peaked lapels in American English).|$|R
50|$|The monument, a cenotaph form {{reminiscent}} of the Lutyens' Cenotaph (Whitehall, London), is the central focus of the park. Constructed from coursed pale grey quarry-faced granite, the monument is approximately 2.6m x 1.4m in plan, rising to a height of about 5m from a concrete plinth measuring about 4.6m x 3.7m. A band of dressed and polished granite forms a <b>collar</b> to the <b>stepped</b> crown of the cenotaph. A low protective painted metal rail is erected to {{the perimeter of the}} plinth. Within this protective fence stand decorative bollards linked by metal chains. Plaques to the long sides of the monument list those from the Sandgate district who fell in WWI, WWII and the conflicts in Malaya, Korea and Vietnam. A verse is inscribed to the obverse side:"They died, and yet in memory shall they live, That we may know the worth of sacrifice, Know that their death is freedom's cause, Stands as a beacon light to point the way To paths of peace".A large metal utility box located near a path to the north east of the memorial and a recently constructed wooden rotunda {{in a corner of the}} park are not considered to be culturally significant.|$|R
5000|$|The plant {{operated}} 10 washers. Among {{the other}} machinery were two large flat work ironers, an [...] handkerchief ironer, two drying tumblers, nine pressing machines, and a curtain dryer. The clothing was washed in revolving machines, in filtered water with pure soap, and rinsed five times. The wringers were centrifugal. The thermostatic control heater kept {{the water at}} all times less than 180 degrees, while the water filtering tanks removed the elements harmful to linens and other materials. The room next to that in which these tanks were located {{on the second floor}} was the store room, which contained barrels of starch, automobile tires, paper boxes, and almost a ton of twine. There was a large dryer, made especially for bath towels, which dried them by a hot air process. The flat work was protected in the mangles by canvas belts and aprons. Men's shirts were mended and the cuffs turned if worn along the fold. Stockings were dried and shaped at the same time on metal forms. A stiff <b>collar</b> required more <b>steps</b> {{in the process of being}} laundried than any other article. Two tanks, each of 1400 gallons capacity, contained soap flakes with the appropriate amount of water. These 2800 gallons lasted only two days at the most. The rough-dry work was done in a different part of the building, and the accounting for this department were kept separately. One person was employed for placing new satin ribbon of different colors in ladies' garments, and tying blankets with ribbon bows.|$|R
60|$|In the {{corridor}} Gale stopped {{long enough to}} pull {{on a pair of}} heavy gloves, to muss his hair, and disarrange his <b>collar.</b> Then he <b>stepped</b> into the restaurant, went through, and halted in the door leading into the saloon. His five feet eleven inches and one hundred and eighty pounds were more noticeable there, and it was part of his plan to attract attention to himself. No one, however, appeared to notice him. The pool-players were noisily intent on their game, the same crowd of motley-robed Mexicans hung over the reeking bar. Gale's roving glance soon fixed upon the man he took to be Rojas. He recognized the huge, high-peaked, black sombrero with its ornamented band. The Mexican's face was turned aside. He was in earnest, excited colloquy with a dozen or more comrades, most of whom were sitting round a table. They were listening, talking, drinking. The fact that they wore cartridge belts crossed over their breasts satisfied that these were the rebels. He had noted the belts of the Mexicans outside, who were apparently guards. A waiter brought more drinks to this group at the table, and this caused the leader to turn so Gale could see his face. It was indeed the sinister, sneering face of the bandit Rojas. Gale gazed at the man with curiosity. He was under medium height, and striking in appearance only because of his dandified dress and evil visage. He wore a lace scarf, a tight, bright-buttoned jacket, a buckskin vest embroidered in red, a sash and belt joined by an enormous silver clasp. Gale saw again the pearl-handled gun swinging at the bandit's hip. Jewels flashed in his scarf. There were gold rings in his ears and diamonds on his fingers.|$|R
