50|$|Hagmann et al. (2007) {{constructed}} a <b>connection</b> <b>matrix</b> from fiber densities measured between homogeneously distributed and equal-sized regions of interest (ROIs) numbering between 500 and 4000. A quantitative analysis of connection matrices obtained for approximately 1000 ROIs and approximately 50,000 fiber pathways from two subjects demonstrated an exponential (one-scale) degree distribution {{as well as}} robust small-world attributes for the network. The data sets were derived from diffusion spectrum imaging (DSI) (Wedeen, 2005), a variant of diffusion-weighted imaging that is sensitive to intra-voxel heterogeneities in diffusion directions caused by crossing fiber tracts and thus allows more accurate mapping of axonal trajectories than other diffusion imaging approaches (Wedeen, 2008).The combination of whole-head DSI datasets acquired and processed according to the approach developed by Hagmann et al. (2007) with the graph analysis tools conceived initially for animal tracing studies (Sporns, 2006; Sporns, 2007) allow a detailed study of the network structure of human cortical connectivity (Hagmann et al., 2008).

Hagmann et al. presented evidence for the existence of a structural core of highly and mutually interconnected brain regions, located primarily in posterior medial and parietal cortex.

40|$|Sets of {{orthogonal}} polynomials are {{bases for}} polynomial spaces Pn. As a result, polynomials {{can be expressed}} in coefficients relative to a particular family of orthogonal polynomials. The connection problem refers {{to the task of}} converting from coefficients in one of these bases to coefficients in another. The entries of the matrix that applies such a change of basis, known as the connection coefficients, are well-known values that can be computed via direct computation or matrix inversion; however this can be computationally expensive. Thus their accurate and efficient computation is a relevant topic of research in numerical linear algebra, and {{can be found in the}} current literature. The two manuscripts included in this thesis address the connection problem. In the first manuscript, a connection within the classical real orthogonal polynomials of a single parameter (Hermite, Laguerre, and Gegenbauer) is discussed. The spectral <b>connection</b> <b>matrix</b> related to a <b>connection</b> <b>matrix</b> is defined. It is also shown that this spectral <b>connection</b> <b>matrix</b> in each case within the single-parameter classical families is quasiseparable, with specific generators provided. Additionally this manuscript proposes an algorithm that efficiently computes the desired <b>connection</b> <b>matrix</b> given the generators of its corresponding spectral <b>connection</b> <b>matrix.</b> The second manuscript dramatically generalizes the result of the first. It addresses the structure of the spectral <b>connection</b> <b>matrix</b> associated with a much broader group of connections. The target family is allowed to be any of the classical types, including Jacobi. The source family is allowed to be any of the classical types or Bessel, which is not considered classical here.

40|$|<b>Connection</b> <b>matrices</b> for graph {{parameters}} with {{values in}} a field have been introduced by M. Freedman, L. Lovász and A. Schrijver (2007). Graph parameters with <b>connection</b> <b>matrices</b> of finite rank can be computed in polynomial time on graph classes of bounded tree-width. We introduce join matrices, a generalization of <b>connection</b> <b>matrices,</b> and allow graph parameters to take values in the tropical rings (max-plus algebras) over the real numbers. We show that rank-finiteness of join matrices implies that these graph parameters can be computed in polynomial time on graph classes of bounded clique-width. In the case of graph parameters with values in arbitrary commutative semirings, this remains true for graph classes of bounded linear clique-width. B. Godlin, T. Kotek and J. A. Makowsky (2008) showed that definability of a graph parameter in Monadic Second Order Logic implies rank finiteness. We also show that there are uncountably many integer valued graph parameters with <b>connection</b> <b>matrices</b> or join matrices of fixed finite rank. This shows that rank finiteness is a much weaker assumption than any definability assumption.

40|$|The results {{we present}} here concern geometrically {{continuous}} polynomial splines, {{in the sense}} that the left/right derivatives at the knots are linked by <b>connection</b> <b>matrices.</b> A classical sufficient condition for spaces of such splines to be suitable for either Approximation or Geometric Design is the total positivity of all their <b>connection</b> <b>matrices</b> (i. e., all their minors are non-negative) [1].

We can prove that our tau-functions satisfy Q-system relations by applying the famous "Desnanot-Jacobi identity" or by using "connection matrices", the latter of which gives rise to orthogonal polynomials. In this paper, we will provide the background information required for computing these tau-functions and obtaining the <b>connection</b> <b>matrices</b> and will then use the <b>connection</b> <b>matrices</b> to derive our difference relations and to find orthogonal polynomials.

40|$|The {{connection}} {{problem for}} orthogonal polynomials is, given a polynomial {{expressed in the}} basis of one set of orthogonal polynomials, computing the coefficients {{with respect to a}} different set of orthogonal polynomials. Expansions in terms of orthogonal polynomials are very common in many applications. While the connection problem may be solved by directly computing the change–of–basis matrix, this approach is computationally expensive. A recent approach to solving the connection problem involves the use of the spectral <b>connection</b> <b>matrix,</b> which is a matrix whose eigenvector matrix is the desired change–of–basis matrix. In Bella and Reis (2014), it is shown that for the connection problem between any two different classical real orthogonal polynomials of the Hermite, Laguerre, and Gegenbauer families, the related spectral <b>connection</b> <b>matrix</b> has quasiseparable structure. This result is limited to the case where both the source and target families are one of the Hermite, Laguerre, or Gegenbauer families, which are each defined by at most a single parameter. In particular, this excludes the large and common class of Jacobi polynomials, defined by two parameters, both as a source and as a target family. In this paper, we continue the study of the spectral <b>connection</b> <b>matrix</b> for connections between real orthogonal polynomial families. In particular, for the connection problem between any two families of the Hermite, Laguerre, or Jacobi type (including Chebyshev, Legendre, and Gegenbauer), we prove that the spectral <b>connection</b> <b>matrix</b> has quasiseparable structure.
