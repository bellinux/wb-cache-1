Archaeological features can be mapped when they are of higher or lower resistivity than their surroundings. A stone foundation might impede the flow of electricity, while the organic deposits within a midden might conduct electricity more easily than surrounding soils. Although generally used in archaeology for planview mapping, resistance methods also have a limited ability to discriminate depth and create vertical profiles (see Electrical resistivity tomography).

5000|$|Increased <b>corrosion</b> <b>potential</b> - Following {{operation}} or testing, dry-pipe {{sprinkler system}} piping is drained, but residual water collects in piping low spots, and moisture is also {{retained in the}} atmosphere within the piping. This moisture, coupled with the oxygen available in the compressed air in the piping, increases internal pipe corrosion, eventually leading to pin-hole leaks or other piping failures. The internal corrosion rate in wet pipe systems (in which the piping is constantly full of water) is much lower, {{as the amount of}} oxygen available for the corrosion process is lower. Corrosion can be combated by using copper or stainless steel pipe which is less susceptible to corrosion, or by using dry nitrogen gas to pressurize the system, rather than air. Nitrogen generators {{can be used as a}} permanent source of nitrogen gas, which is beneficial because dry pipe sprinkler systems require an uninterrupted supply of supervisory gas. These additional precautions can increase the up-front cost of the system, but will help prevent system failure, increased maintenance costs, and premature need for system replacement in the future.|$|E

50|$|The {{system can}} be fail-safe. If an {{electrical}} fault opens, the electrical circuit causes the indicator to show the tank as being empty (theoretically provoking the driver to refill the tank) rather than full (which would allow the driver {{to run out of}} fuel with no prior notification). Corrosion or wear of the potentiometer will provide erroneous readings of fuel level. However, this system has a potential risk associated with it. An electric current is sent through the variable resistor to which a float is connected, so that the value of resistance depends on the fuel level. In most automotive fuel gauges such resistors are on the inward side of the gauge, i.e., inside the fuel tank. Sending current through such a resistor has a fire hazard and an explosion risk associated with it. These resistance sensors are also showing an increased failure rate with the incremental additions of alcohol in automotive gasoline fuel. Alcohol increases the corrosion rate at the potentiometer, as it is capable of carrying current like water. Potentiometer applications for alcohol fuel use a pulse-and-hold methodology, with a periodic signal being sent to determine fuel level decreasing the <b>corrosion</b> <b>potential.</b> Therefore, demand for another safer, non-contact method for fuel level is desired.|$|E

Hamiltonians {{were used to}} predict the <b>corrosion</b> inhibition <b>potential</b> of nine amino acids grouped under three skeletons. Skeleton I consisted of cysteine (CYS), serine (SER) and amino butyric acid (ABU). Those in skeleton II included threonine (THR), alanine (ALA) and valine (VAL) while those in skeleton III are aromatic amino acids, which included phenylalanine (PHE), tryptophan (TRP) and tyrosine (TYR). Trends obtained from substituent constants were not entirely useful in predicting the <b>corrosion</b> inhibition <b>potentials</b> of the studied amino acids. However, the results obtained from quantum chemical parameters indicated that the trends for the variation of <b>corrosion</b> inhibition <b>potentials</b> of the studied amino acids in skeletons I, II and III are CYS>SER>ABU, THR>ALA>VAL and TRP>TYR>PHE, respectively.
