25|$|Security {{guarantees}} for political activities, {{through the creation}} of a <b>Comprehensive</b> <b>Security</b> System. These security guarantees would be aimed at protecting those who participate in politics by respecting their human rights and dignity, preventing violence and instilling a culture of tolerance and coexistence to prevent stigmatization and persecution of political leaders. The security guarantees, including the structure of the <b>Comprehensive</b> <b>Security</b> System, were fleshed out on June 23, 2016. The <b>Comprehensive</b> <b>Security</b> System, led by a high-level body and a technical committee, would implement a protection program to protect members of the new party or movement founded by the FARC. For such purposes, a dedicated sub-unit of the National Protection Unit (which would include demobilized members of the FARC) and a security and protection body (with members of the FARC's political movement in liaison with the National Police), would be created. A National Commission of Security Guarantees, chaired by the President, would design and monitor public and criminal policies aimed at the dismantlement of any organization contravening the agreement. The security guarantees would also extend to social movements, human rights defenders, Security and protection guarantees are particularly important for the FARC, whose greatest fear is a repeat of the extermination of the Patriotic Union (UP) in the 1980s, when over one thousand members of the left-wing political party (founded in 1985 with the FARC's participation following the La Uribe ceasefire agreement in 1984) were assassinated by paramilitaries and agents of the state.|$|E

25|$|Lincoln's {{assassination}} {{had taken}} place roughly sixteen years before in the closing stages of the Civil War. On the other hand, Garfield's term was marked (for the most part) by peacetime, and a general complacency with respect to presidential security had developed by this time. Garfield, like many other presidents, often preferred to interact directly with the public and although some form of security was almost certainly in place, a <b>comprehensive</b> <b>security</b> detail had not been seriously considered by either Congress or the president up to that point. Remarkably, {{it would not be}} until the assassination of William McKinley some twenty years later that Congress would finally task the United States Secret Service (founded to prevent counterfeiting) with the responsibility of ensuring the president's personal safety.|$|E
500|$|Rio de Janeiro's infrastructure, systems, {{management}} {{structures and}} staff readiness {{will be tested}} during the 2014 FIFA World Cup and during dedicated test events for the transport network in 2015. There will be 49,750 rooms to meet IOC requirements, of which some 1,700 are located in apartment hotels {{in the city and}} more than 13,000 in hotels throughout Rio de Janeiro and the football tournament host cities. Rio de Janeiro proposed the use of cruise ships and condominium apartments to overcome a possible shortage in the number of hotel rooms. Six modern cruise ships will provide more than 8,500 cabins. Media would be accommodated in a combination of media villages and hotels. Rio de Janeiro plans to implement [...] of Olympic lanes connecting the four Olympic zones and the Antônio Carlos Jobim International Airport. An existing corridor of high-capacity rail and metro systems as well as motorways and major roads links three of the four Olympic zones, and with the development of the western corridor, all four zones will be connected. Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) system {{is going to be the}} main solution to the city's topography. Security and disaster-related risks for the event will be mitigated by the implementation of a <b>comprehensive</b> <b>security</b> operation. Crime in parts of Rio de Janeiro was considered to be an issue for the safety of people attending the Games. Rio de Janeiro's experience in mounting security structures around highly mediatized and crowd-attracting events is a positive aspect. The Federal Government will be responsible for the security of the 2016 Summer Olympics and Paralympics.|$|E

These arguments tend to draw on two broad sets of literature that, although arguing to the same ends, are not usually combined or interrelated. First, there are analyses setting out the social and economic benefits of such a policy, focusing particularly on arguments of economic efficiency and affordability. Second, there has been much theoretical and normative work arguing (particularly) in favour of a basic income grant or other form of citizen's income.
