50|$|The engine {{featured}} Heron heads, {{which were}} milled flat and the combustion chamber is recessed in the piston crown, aiding combustion and returning excellent fuel economy. A fuel <b>consumption</b> <b>test</b> by Motorcycling Monthly at Britain's Motor Industry Research Association in 1976 returned {{a performance of}} 65 mpgimp while a 3½ bike carried rider and pillion passenger. The engine also incorporated one piece forged steel crankshaft, ball main bearings (first series motors), plain big end bearings (second series motors), and the conrods run on a common pin, desaxe, and offsetting the rear cylinder to the front by 50 mm. Front and rear barrels and heads are interchangeable. VBH Dell'Orto (25 mm VHB 25 BS) square slide carburettors were fitted to the 350, with air fed via air-box with two filters. Bore and stroke was 62 x 57 mm, respectively. The camshaft was driven by a small toothed belt, and was a revolutionary advance. They also included an electronic capacitor discharge ignition system designed by Ducati Elettronica. Early models had kick-start only but later ones also included a starter motor using three centrifugal friction shoes engaging the alternator rotor cover. The CDI ignition was powered by a coil in the alternator and using the kick-start a bike could be started and ridden with a flat battery.|$|E
50|$|The {{first part}} of the contest were {{technical}} trials, starting on August 4. Unlike the following Challenges, it was not too complicated and consisted of a technical evaluation, quick engine start test, quick wing folding test and fuel consumption trial only.The first was a technical evaluation of competing planes' construction. Such features, like twin controls, rich set of controls, wheel brakes, fire safety devices and a room for parachutes, could bring up to 18 points. Most points was given to the Italian Breda Ba-15s (11.75 to 12 pts) and German all-metal Junkers A50s (11.75 pts). Very good result of 11.25 points was obtained also by the Italian Fiat AS.1s and Romeo Ro-5s. The German BFW M.23b were given only 9.5 points, DH-60s - from 9.5 to 10.5 points, and the lowest result was 8 points (Caudron C.113).After quick wings' folding and quick engine starting tests, the classification leader was the Czech Josef Novak flying an Aero A.34 biplane, with 17.5 pts. Behind him, there were three Italians flying Romeo Ro-5 biplanes (17.25 pts), then the rest. The best German pilot, Wolf Hirth, had 16.25 pts (12th place, Klemm L.25), but most Germans had a few points less. Some planes were handicapped, not having folding wings. Some crews completed wings' folding trial on 6 August.The last was a fuel <b>consumption</b> <b>test,</b> on 6 x 50 km closed circuit, on 5 August. It could bring up to 20 points. The best result was obtained by the German Johannes Nehring flying a Darmstadt D-18 biplane (18.5 pts), then the Swiss Hans Wirth (Klemm L.25), three German Junkers A50 and two Czech Avia BH-11s, with 15-17 pts.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate the predictive validity of laboratory sensory tests on consumption. Thirty-six subjects (30 women, six men; mean age 21 years) participated in a taste-and-spit test, a taste-and-swallow test, a fixed quantity test in which an amount of 300 g was consumed, and an ad libitum <b>consumption</b> <b>test.</b> Subjects rated on a 10 -point category scale pleasantness and perceived sweetness intensity of yogurts varying in sucrose concentration (1, 5. 9, 10, 17. 6 and 30 % w/w). Consumption was measured in the ad libitum <b>consumption</b> <b>test.</b> Results showed that the optimal sucrose concentration as determined by the taste-and-spit test (10 % w/w) was higher than that determined from the taste-and-swallow test, the fixed quantity test and the ad libitum <b>consumption</b> <b>test</b> (5. 9 % w/w). The mean of within-subject's correlation coefficients between pleasantness ratings and amount of yogurt eaten in the ad libitum <b>consumption</b> <b>test</b> were 0. 45, 0. 62, 0. 75 and 0. 81 for the taste-and-spit test, the taste-and-swallow test, the fixed quantity test and the ad libitum <b>consumption</b> <b>test,</b> respectively. The perceived sweetness intensity did not change as function of the sensory test used.

40|$|Sea urchin {{aquaculture}} {{for human}} {{food is a}} major industry, and there are prospects for the industry in South Africa. Feeding preferences of the sea urchin Tripneustes gratilla were tested by two different methods; a touch-preference test and a 48 -hour <b>consumption</b> <b>test.</b> A touchpreference is established when the sea urchins' lantern teeth touched an algal species. The 48 -hour <b>consumption</b> <b>test</b> was performed with paired combinations using four species of fresh algae. It was hypothesized that the preferred species would be similar in the touch-preference test and the <b>consumption</b> <b>test.</b> Five algal species {{were used in the}} touch-preference test; namely, Ecklonia maxima (kelp), Gigartina polycarpa, Grateloupia capensi, Porphyra capensis, and U/va rigida. Four of these species were used in the paired consumption test; namely, E. maxima, G. polycarpa, P. capensis and U. rigida. We found that E. maxima was most preferred in the touch-test followed by P. capensis and U. rigida. This result did not correlate with our <b>consumption</b> <b>test.</b> Here, U. rigida was significantly most preferred followed by E. maxima. Overall, the result is significant in relation to the prospect of echinoculture in South Africa as Ulva may provide a valuable alternate feed or supplement to this new industry. Due to the increase in time provided for the paired <b>consumption</b> <b>test,</b> we found that the paired <b>consumption</b> <b>test</b> was more conclusive in providing a preference for Tripneustes gratilla. Our results agree with literature which suggests that Tripneustes gratilla is a genera list feeder; however, Tripneustes gratilla shows definite preferences. Ulva spp. has been grown on a number of abalone farms in South Africa. Integrated aquaculture using T. gratilla and U. rigida as a biofilter and alternate feed is a very promising idea for echinoculture in South Africa...|$|E

It enables calculation of the corrected fuel consumption out of a single fuel <b>consumption</b> <b>test</b> run in a single analytic post-processing step. An additional fuel <b>consumption</b> <b>test</b> run might be needed to obtain highly accurate results if ratio of the energy content deviation of the electric storage devices to the energy used for vehicle propulsion over the test cycle is high.

40|$|Animal-based {{measures}} of thirst are currently absent from animal welfare monitoring schemes {{due to the}} lack of a well-validated indicator applicable for on-farm use. In the present study, an on-farm test based on voluntary water consumption from an unfamiliar open drinker was validated in a (semi-) commercial setting. To investigate the effect of thirst on water consumption, we subjected 4 flocks of 1, 500 broilers to either 0 or 12 h of water deprivation and subsequently measured the amount of water that small subgroups consumed after the deprivation period (first experiment). Broilers that were water deprived before the test drank more than control broilers (P < 0. 001). In a second experiment, a similar test was performed using 20 commercial broiler flocks in Belgium and Brazil. After a pretreatment water <b>consumption</b> <b>test,</b> the birds were subjected to 0 or 6 h of water deprivation, and a posttreatment water <b>consumption</b> <b>test</b> was conducted. Only in Brazil, deprived birds drank significantly more than controls in the posttreatment water <b>consumption</b> <b>test</b> (P < 0. 001). A tendency for a difference was found in Belgium (P = 0. 083). Pre- and posttreatment water consumption was higher in Brazil than in Belgium (P < 0. 001). Stocking density and temperature influenced, respectively, the pretreatment and the control's posttreatment water consumption in Brazil, but not in Belgium. These results indicate that the water <b>consumption</b> <b>test</b> is sufficiently sensitive to discriminate between control and 12 h deprived flocks, and in Brazil even between control and 6 h deprived birds. The location of the test within the house did not affect the amount of water consumed in either experiment, suggesting that this variable does not have to be standardized. However, the amount of water consumed by broilers able to drink freely for a long period depended on indoor climatic variables (in Brazil only) and possibly genotype. This suggests that these variables need to be considered when interpreting the test outcome in terms of the thirst level experienced by the broilers...|$|E
