Sodium pumps in the renal tubules operate to reabsorb sodium. Potassium must be conserved also, but, because {{the amount of}} potassium in the blood plasma is very small and the pool of potassium in the cells is about thirty times as large, the situation is not so critical for potassium. Since potassium is moved passively in <b>counter</b> <b>flow</b> to sodium {{in response to an}} apparent (but not actual) Donnan equilibrium, the urine can never sink below the concentration of potassium in serum except sometimes by actively excreting water {{at the end of the}} processing. Potassium is excreted twice and reabsorbed three times before the urine reaches the collecting tubules. At that point, urine usually has about the same potassium concentration as plasma. At the end of the processing, potassium is secreted one more time if the serum levels are too high.|$|E

40|$|The {{industrial}} effluents {{and municipal}} wastewater plant effluents discharged into a stream {{are expected to}} undergo dilution in a short reach of the stream. To permit this, the devices used to discharge the effluent should ensure rapid mixing of the effluent in the stream. Jets act as simple and efficient devices that accomplish this task. <b>Counter</b> <b>flowing</b> wall jets located in closed conduits {{can also be used}} for efficient mixing of chemicals used in water and wastewater plants. The increased interest in the use of cross jets and <b>counter</b> <b>flowing</b> jets to ensure proper mixing of effluents in a stream {{can be traced to the}} larger scales of mixing achieved by these devices, as compared to the traditional co-flowing jet devices. Existing <b>counter</b> <b>flowing</b> wall jet studies are mostly limited to the determination of the mean flow characteristics of the jet. These include the determination of the functional relationship among the main jet parameters such as the jet velocity ratio, the width of the recirculation zone and the penetration length of the jet. In the present study, the mean and turbulent mixing characteristics of the <b>counter</b> <b>flowing</b> wall jets were determined experimentally using a Laser Doppler velocity meter (LDA). This information was used to find the dependence of the length scales and the velocity scales of the <b>counter</b> <b>flowing</b> wall jet on the basic parameters. To validate the experimental procedure, the mean velocity profiles, turbulent components and jet expansion angle of wall jets were determined. The validation was quite good.

The proposed method, however, smooths the trend of Z-bus method to reflect the counter-flows. For example, in time step 4 representing the system peak condition, the contribution of the generator at bus 1 into the power flow of the line 5 - 6, is 6.55 MW counter-flow under the Z-bus method, and is 1.99 MW counter-flow, under the proposed method. In the same time step, given the generator at bus 2, there exists a counter-flow contribution of the generator into the power flow of line 1 - 2, with 7.27 MW and 1.69 MW under the Z-bus and the proposed methods, respectively. Note that, higher <b>counter</b> <b>flows</b> with excessive rewards may result in unfair competition, and in turn, may distort the power market.|$|R
50|$|The basic {{principle}} of separating the cells inside CCE is {{the balance between}} centrifugal force and the <b>counter</b> <b>flow</b> drag force. When the cells enter the elutriation chamber, all the cells will stay at {{the outer edge of}} the chamber due to centrifugal force. Then when we increase the flow rate of the buffer solution, due to the special design of the CCE, the solution tends to push the cells towards the middle of the CCE: we call this <b>counter</b> <b>flow</b> drag force. As the flow rate of the buffer solution increase, when the <b>counter</b> <b>flow</b> drag force outweigh the centrifugal force the smaller cells will be driven by the net force and leave the chamber first. In contrast the larger cells will stay within the elutriation chamber. So the cells escape from the elutriation chamber can be collected in the exit of the system.|$|E

Among them, the behaviour of foam films during drainage has great significance as {{the thickness of the}} films is known to control the Ostwald ripening in foams, which in turn impacts liquid drainage. We propose a model relating the films' behavior to the liquid flow in foam channels. It is assumed that Marangoni driven recirculation <b>counter</b> <b>flows</b> take place in the transitional region between the foam channel and the adjoining films, and the Gibbs elasticity is therefore introduced as a relevant parameter. The velocity of these <b>counter</b> <b>flows</b> is found to be proportional to the liquid velocity in the channel.

40|$|This {{presentation}} {{will examine}} {{in detail the}} role of vibration-induced streaming flow {{in the context of}} float-zone crystal growth. It is very well known that during float-zone materials processing, the naturally occurring temperature gradients along the zone surface impose a thermocapillary flow in the zone. Under certain processing conditions, the thermocapillary flow can also become nonsteady (oscillatory). The presence of thermocapillary flow is detrimental to crystal quality, for it can promote non-uniform dopant distribution and crystal striations. To null this effect we have imposed a <b>counter</b> streaming <b>flow</b> in the zone, via end-wall vibration. This technique has been adapted to float-zone processing of Sodium Nitrate-Barium Nitrate eutectic alloys, under both steady and nonsteady thermocapillary flow conditions. The beneficial effects of <b>counter</b> streaming <b>flow</b> have been clearly brought out through the before and after comparisons of the crystal microstructure. In addition, we are also examining the theoretical underpinnings of the balancing of thermocapillary <b>flows</b> with vibration-driven <b>counter</b> <b>flows</b> in float-zones...|$|R

50|$|The {{design of}} inlet and outlet headers used to {{distribute}} {{hot and cold}} fluids in the matrix is much simpler in <b>counter</b> <b>flow</b> regenerators than recuperators. The reason behind this is that both streams flow in different sections for a rotary regenerator and one fluid enters and leaves one matrix {{at a time in}} a fixed-matrix regenerator. Furthermore, flow sectors for hot and cold fluids in rotary regenerators can be designed to optimize pressure drop in the fluids. The matrix surfaces of regenerators also have self-cleaning characteristics, reducing fluid-side fouling and corrosion. Finally properties such as small surface density and counter-flow arrangement of regenerators make it ideal for gas-gas heat exchange applications requiring effectiveness exceeding 85%. The heat transfer coefficient is much lower for gases than for liquids, thus the enormous surface area in a regenerator greatly increases heat transfer.|$|E

The Evershed effect, {{a nearly}} {{horizontal}} outflow of material {{seen in the}} penumbrae of sunspots in the photospheric layers, is a common characteristic of well-developed penumbrae, but is still not well understood. Even less is known about photospheric horizontal inflows in the penumbra, also known as <b>counter</b> Evershed <b>flows.</b> Aims. Here we present a rare feature observed in the penumbra of the main sunspot of AR NOAA 10930. This spot displays the normal Evershed outflow {{in most of the}} penumbra, but harbors a fast photospheric inflow of material over a large sector of the disk-center penumbra. We investigate the driving forces of both, the normal and the <b>counter</b> Evershed <b>flows.</b> Methods. We invert the spectropolarimetric data from Hinode SOT/SP using the spatially coupled version of the SPINOR inversion code, which allows us to derive height-dependent maps of the relevant physical parameters in the sunspot. These maps show considerable fine structure. Similarities and differences between the normal Evershed outflow and the <b>counter</b> Evershed <b>flow</b> are investigated. Results. In both the normal and the <b>counter</b> Evershed <b>flows,</b> the material flows from regions with field strengths of the order of 1. 5 - 2 kG to regions with stronger fields.

Conclusions. The anti-correlation of the gradients in the temperature and magnetic pressure between the endpoints of the filaments from the two distinct penumbral regions is compatible with both the convective driver and the siphon flow scenarios.

Initially, students learn a specific series of attacks, counters, and counter-attacks. As they advance they can add minor variations, change the footwork, or switch to completely different attacks; eventually the exercise becomes almost completely free-form. Palakaw, from the Balintawak style, are un-choreographed and random defensive and offensive moves. Palakaw in Cebuano means a walk-through or rehearsing the different strike angles and defenses. It may be known as corridas, or striking without any order or pattern. Disarms, take-downs, and other techniques usually break the flow of such a drill, but they are usually initiated from such a sequence of movements to force the student to adapt to a variety of situations. A common practice is to begin a drill with each student armed with two weapons. Once the drill is flowing, if a student sees an opportunity to disarm their opponent, they do, but the drill continues until both students are empty-handed. Some drills use only a single weapon per pair, and the partners take turns disarming each other.
