Regarding foreign direct investment, a {{study found that the}} intra-eurozone FDI stocks have increased by about 20% during the first four years of the EMU. Concerning the effect on <b>corporate</b> <b>investment,</b> there is evidence that the introduction of the euro has resulted in an increase in investment rates and that it has made it easier for firms to access financing in Europe. The euro has most specifically stimulated investment in companies that come from countries that previously had weak currencies. A study found that the introduction of the euro accounts for 22% of the investment rate after 1998 in countries that previously had a weak currency.|$|E

25|$|After independence, Tunisian {{economic}} policy had been primarily to promote light industry and tourism, and develop its phosphate deposits. The major sector remained agriculture with small farms prevailing, but these {{did not produce}} well. In the early 1960s the economy slowed down, but the socialist program did not {{prove to be the}} cure. In the 1970s the economy of Tunisia expanded at a very agreeable rate. Oil was discovered, and tourism continued. Foreign <b>corporate</b> <b>investment</b> increased. For example, Renault opened an auto manufacturing plant. City and countryside populations drew roughly equal in number. Yet agricultural problems and urban unemployment led to increased migration to Europe for work.|$|E

40|$|A firm can {{undertake}} <b>corporate</b> <b>investments</b> {{arising from}} growth opportunities {{only if it}} has the required level of liquidity. A {{clear understanding of the}} complex relationship between <b>corporate</b> <b>investments</b> and liquidity could help firms to gain benefits from growth opportunities. While the study supports several previous studies on the sensitivity of investments to liquidity, it more importantly contributes to the literature on working capital by showing the dual-role of working capital in relation to <b>corporate</b> <b>investments.</b> Drawing upon Shulman and Cox’s (1985) Net Liquidity Balance (NLB) and Working Capital Requirement (WCR) as proxy for net working capital, the study develops a model to test the two hypotheses. Using the data collected from listed service firms in the Thailand Stock Exchange, the study found that while NLB has a significant positive relationship with <b>corporate</b> <b>investments,</b> WCR has a significant negative relationship with <b>corporate</b> <b>investments.</b> The study also finds that firms manage WCR efficiently during growth opportunities in order to enhance NLB. 10 page(s...|$|R

In this context, Argentina, Uruguay, Paraguay and Brazil signed on 1 January 1994 in the city of Colonia del Sacramento, Uruguay, the Colonia Protocol for the Reciprocal Promotion and Protection of Mercosur Investments (Colonia Protocol). It was established in this protocol that investments under Mercosur by investors resident or domiciled in the territory of any member state will be entitled to treatment no less favorable than that accorded by the other member state to national investors or nonmember states.|$|E
2500|$|Achieving {{the goals}} of {{corporate}} finance requires that any <b>corporate</b> <b>investment</b> be financed appropriately. The sources of financing are, generically, capital self-generated by the firm and capital from external funders, obtained by issuing new debt and equity (and hybrid- or convertible securities). As above, since both hurdle rate and cash flows (and hence the riskiness of the firm) will be affected, the financing mix will impact the valuation of the firm.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the experience of}} corporate venturing activity in the United States. We present a history of corporate venture programs and the motivations for such programs. We then explore a detailed history of <b>corporate</b> venture <b>investments</b> {{over the past twenty}} years. We find that the majority of <b>corporate</b> venture <b>investments</b> go to investments in related technologies. These investments are made increasingly with experienced, independent venture capital groups. While <b>corporate</b> venture capital <b>investments</b> tend to be later stage investments done at higher valuations and greater capital contributions, the success rates of these investments are surprisingly high. Even after controlling for the later stage of <b>investment,</b> <b>corporate</b> <b>investments</b> have higher success rates than the investments of independent venture capital organizations. The results argue that <b>corporate</b> <b>investments</b> in emerging companies can {{play an important role in}} the development of new technologies.

2500|$|Global {{corporations}} consider {{local tax}} structures when making planning and capital investment decisions. Lower corporate tax rates and favorable transfer pricing regulations can induce higher <b>corporate</b> <b>investment</b> {{in a given}} locality. Such investment translates into higher economic growth. Ireland's real GDP growth was almost three {{times higher than the}} European Union average between 1991 and 2000. This is partly attributed to the fact that, during the decade, Ireland taxed corporate profits from manufacturing at 10%, the lowest in the EU. The United States currently has the highest combined statutory corporate income tax rate among OECD countries. [...] The FairTax would remove the corporate income tax, which supporters argue would make the United States the largest corporate tax haven in the world.|$|E

2500|$|Unlike corporations, {{investment}} funds typically don't {{have any}} employees to manage or lead. Corporate directors have more authority {{and a more}} complex set of duties to execute, such as approving major <b>corporate</b> <b>investment</b> and financial policies, monitoring diverse accounting systems, and selecting and terminating top corporate executives. Compared to hedge funds, the regulatory and competitive issues facing each company are highly idiosyncratic. Investment funds operate by appointing service providers under service agreements with the fund and each service provider is governed by its own governing body independently of the fund. [...] This means that fund directors {{do not have any}} authority to direct the affairs of the service providers to the fund other than under the contractual responsibilities outlined in the service agreement. [...] Day-to-day managerial responsibilities are typically delegated to the investment manager and fund administrator. Compared to large corporations, hedge funds are relatively homogenous, and the duties of their directors are relatively limited and standardized. These factors should reduce the required time investment and increase the scalability of the director's human capital such that it can be employed efficiently across many funds.|$|E
