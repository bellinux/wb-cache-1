5|$|The {{writings}} of Confucius and Chinese tradition recount that, in the 27th century BCE, a silk worm's <b>cocoon</b> {{fell into the}} tea cup of the empress Leizu. Wishing to extract it from her drink, the 14-year-old girl began to unroll the thread of the <b>cocoon.</b>|$|E
5|$|After {{completing}} all but {{its last}} moult, the caterpillar spins a <b>cocoon</b> out of silk. The <b>cocoon</b> {{can be in}} the tree crown or between two leaves, but is most often near the ground, between moss and bark. It is an open network <b>cocoon</b> with large and irregular mesh. In the warm season, the <b>cocoon</b> takes about 10 hours to spin, the metamorphosis takes place about 29 hours later and lasts about 6 minutes. These durations are slightly longer in the cold season. The chrysalis stage lasts 17 days in November, the warmest month, and 23 days in July, the coldest month. Five to six days before eclosion, the motifs of the wings start to become visible. The moth emerges during the night or in low light, by splitting the pupal case from the top. Once out of the pupal exuvia (the pupal exoskeleton), the moth finds a horizontal surface, from which it suspends itself by its four anterior legs. The wings are deployed in about 10 minutes, by pumping haemolymph into the wing veins. The moth then beats them a few times, waits 45 minutes to let them harden, then beats them lightly again. The moth finally takes flight between one and a half to two hours later.|$|E

40|$|Males in the cavity-nesting {{house wren}} (Troglodytes aedon) {{frequently}} add arthropod <b>cocoons</b> to their nests during building, possibly as an ornamental cue for female choice. We tested this hypothesis {{by comparing the}} time to pairing for males that did and did not add <b>cocoons</b> to their nests and for males in whose nests we manipulated the number of <b>cocoons</b> prior to pairing. We also tested the hypothesis that females acquire fitness-related benefits by selecting mates based on their use of <b>cocoons.</b> The use of <b>cocoons</b> by males was not consistently related to habitat, {{but the number of}} <b>cocoons</b> added per nest increased {{during the course of the}} breeding season. Contrary to prediction, the time to pairing for males adding <b>cocoons</b> was significantly longer than that for males without <b>cocoons</b> in their nests at both unmanipulated and experimental nests. There was also no consistent fitness-related benefit for females related to the use of <b>cocoons</b> by their mates. Therefore, we conclude that females did not prefer males that added <b>cocoons</b> to their nests, and that the increased time to pairing for males that add <b>cocoons</b> likely results in fitness-related costs brought about by delayed breeding. Nonetheless, male house wrens routinely use <b>cocoons,</b> and why they do so remains unknown. Copyright 2005. female choice; house wrens; nest building; sexual selection; Troglodytes aedon...|$|R

5|$|In Final Fantasy XIII-2, a 24-year-old Hope is {{leader of}} the {{scientific}} expedition group known as the Academy {{a decade after the}} events of Final Fantasy XIII. He helps Noel and Serah in their journey to find Lightning when they arrive in his time. Other than knowing that time travel is possible and wishing to undo events of the past, Hope is planning on reviving <b>Cocoon</b> with a different power source. Originally planning to create an artificial fal'Cie, he is dissuaded upon seeing a vision of Serah fighting his creation. He and his assistant Alyssa Zaidelle then use a time capsule to go 387 years into the future to oversee Hope's New <b>Cocoon</b> Project, a plan to build a man-made <b>Cocoon</b> in preparation for Cocoon's destined fall in the next century. When the old <b>Cocoon</b> does fall, Hope and Sazh manage to rescue Vanille and Fang from the crystal pillar before it crumbles.|$|E
5|$|On the Palamecia, {{the other}} members of the party reunite with Vanille and Sazh before they confront Galenth Dysley, the Sanctum's Primarch, who is the <b>Cocoon</b> fal'Cie ruler Barthandelus in disguise. Barthandelus tells the party that their Focus is to {{transform}} into the beast Ragnarok and slay the sleeping fal'Cie Orphan, who keeps <b>Cocoon</b> afloat above Pulse. Slaying Orphan will result in the destruction of <b>Cocoon.</b> The party flees and learns from Cid that the fal'Cie believe that Cocoon's destruction will summon the Maker, the creator of the worlds. The fal'Cie cannot harm Orphan themselves. Vanille and Fang reveal to the party that they were involved in the War of Transgression centuries earlier, and that their Focus then had been the same: to transform into Ragnarok and attempt to destroy Orphan. The party flies away to Pulse and journeys to Oerba, Vanille and Fang's hometown, where they hope to learn how to remove their l'Cie marks. The town is deserted, and they find no living people on the surface. The party is unsuccessful in removing their marks, and Barthandelus confronts them again. The party learns that Barthandelus has made Cid the new Primarch to create chaos in <b>Cocoon</b> to force the Cavalry to attack Cid and Orphan in a coup d'état.|$|E
5|$|Several {{hundred years}} before {{the events of the}} game, a battle known as the War of Transgression took place between Pulse and <b>Cocoon.</b> During the battle, l'Cie from Pulse {{attacked}} and ripped a large hole in <b>Cocoon.</b> Eventually, the l'Cie completed their focus and were turned to crystal. The hole was patched with material lifted from Pulse, and Cocoon's citizens have since lived in fear of another invasion; this fear is used by the Sanctum to remain in power. The Sanctum oversees two military branches: the Guardian Corps, responsible for keeping order on <b>Cocoon,</b> and the Public Security and Intelligence COMmand (PSICOM), the special forces in charge of dealing with any threat related to Pulse. The fal'Cie have given the humans advanced technology, including flying airships and mechanical creatures, and a form of magic also exists. This magic is normally only accessible to l'Cie, fal'Cie, and various monsters in <b>Cocoon</b> and Pulse, though distilled chemical forms can be used by normal humans through the use of Manadrives.|$|E

Ectoparasitic gnathiid isopods (Gnathiidae), which feed on the blood of fish, are removed by cleaner fish during the day; however, {{it is unclear how}} parrotfish and wrasse avoid gnathiid attacks at night. To test the novel hypothesis that mucous <b>cocoons</b> protect against gnathiids, we exposed the coral reef parrotfish Chlorurus sordidus (Scaridae) with and without <b>cocoons</b> to gnathiids overnight and measured the energetic content of <b>cocoons.</b> Fish without mucous <b>cocoons</b> were attacked more by gnathiids than fish with <b>cocoons.</b> The energetic content of mucous <b>cocoons</b> was estimated as 2. 5 per cent of the fish 2 ̆ 7 s daily energy budget fish.

The six were intended to cause the large, inhabited floating sphere named <b>Cocoon</b> to fall into the world below, named Gran Pulse, killing all of the humans of <b>Cocoon.</b> At the finale of the game, two of the l'Cie transformed into a crystal pillar to support <b>Cocoon,</b> preventing the catastrophe.|$|E

When the player spends enough {{time with a}} Chao in the Chao Garden, the Chao develops a cocoon; it hatches from this as an adult. Eventually it develops another <b>cocoon.</b> If the Chao has been treated well, the <b>cocoon</b> is pink and the Chao is reincarnated as an egg; the cycle then restarts and the Chao remembers the player.

Throughout the game, Lightning struggles to deal with her nature as a l'Cie, her anger at being made Cocoon's enemy, and her guilt at disbelieving Serah's story. After overcoming these issues, she acknowledges Snow's relationship with Serah and his faith that they will restore her.

5|$|Lightning Returns is set {{after the}} events of Final Fantasy XIII and Final Fantasy XIII-2. In XIII, Lightning is one of six people who are turned by a fal'Cie—one of a race created by the gods—into l'Cie, {{servants}} of the fal'Cie gifted with magical powers and a 'Focus'—an assigned task to be completed within a time limit; those that succeed in their Focus go into crystal stasis, while those that fail turn into monsters called Cie'th. The six were intended to cause the large, floating sphere named <b>Cocoon</b> to fall onto the world of Gran Pulse below, killing all the humans of <b>Cocoon.</b> At the finale of the game, two of the l'Cie transformed into a crystal pillar to support <b>Cocoon,</b> preventing the catastrophe. The remaining l'Cie were made human again by the Goddess Etro, the deity responsible for maintaining the balance between the mortal world and the Unseen Realm. In XIII-2, it is revealed that Etro's interference allowed Chaos, an energy trapped in the Unseen Realm, to escape and distort the timeline as written {{after the fall of}} <b>Cocoon.</b> Lightning was drawn to Valhalla, Etro's citadel, and decided to stay and act as her protector. Three years after Cocoon's fall, Lightning's sister Serah sets out to correct the distortions and reunite with Lightning, while the people of Gran Pulse construct a new <b>Cocoon,</b> since the old one is destined to collapse. The protagonists unwittingly end up instigating the death of Etro, which allows Chaos to spill into the mortal world and bring an end to time itself. Serah also dies, causing Lightning to nearly lose hope. Reassured by her sister's spirit, Lightning chooses to enter crystal stasis to preserve her sister's memory and keep hope alive.|$|E
5|$|Moving on to 300 AF <b>Cocoon,</b> {{the pair}} find Snow {{fighting}} a giant paradox-fueled monster that is dissolving the crystal pillar. After resolving the paradox, which delays {{the fall of}} <b>Cocoon</b> until 500 AF, Snow disappears again as an anomaly from another time. The pair {{then go to the}} city of Academia on Gran Pulse in 400 AF where they are attacked by the city's AI, which claims they were killed in 200 AF. Traveling to 200 AF, they discover a paradox whereby a man-made fal'Cie meant to re-levitate <b>Cocoon</b> was able to turn on its creators using the AI that designed it and take over the government. Resolving the paradox, Noel and Serah travel to an alternative 400 AF Academia. In this world, the pair find Hope and Alyssa again, who had put themselves in stasis. They explain their new plan to mechanically float a new <b>Cocoon</b> to hold humanity, which Serah and Noel help with before heading to 500 AF Academia. They are betrayed by Alyssa (revealed to be a living paradox doomed to disappear in the corrected timeline) and trapped by Caius in dream-worlds. Before being trapped, Serah meets the spirit of Yeul, who explains that she is the seeress of Paddra, continually reincarnated throughout history, while Caius is her immortal guardian, gifted with Etro's own heart.|$|E
