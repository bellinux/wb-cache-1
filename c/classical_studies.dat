5|$|Much of Havelock's {{work was}} devoted to {{addressing}} a single thesis: that all of Western thought is informed by a profound shift {{in the kinds of}} ideas available to the human mind at the point that Greek philosophy converted from an oral to a literate form. The idea has been very controversial in <b>classical</b> <b>studies,</b> and has been rejected outright both by many of Havelock's contemporaries and modern classicists. Havelock and his ideas have nonetheless had far-reaching influence, both in <b>classical</b> <b>studies</b> and other academic areas. He and Walter J. Ong (who was himself strongly influenced by Havelock) essentially founded the field that studies transitions from orality to literacy, and Havelock {{has been one of the}} most frequently cited theorists in that field; as an account of communication, his work profoundly affected the media theories of Harold Innis and Marshall McLuhan. Havelock's influence has spread beyond the study of the classical world to that of analogous transitions in other times and places.|$|E
5|$|On November 13, 1818, Hawes married Hetty Morrison Nicholas of Lexington. He pursued <b>classical</b> <b>studies</b> at Transylvania University, then studied law under Robert C. Wickliffe.

While there, he became part owner of a rope and bagging factory with Benjamin H. Buckner.|$|E

According to contemporary biographers Theodore Beza and Nicolas Colladon, Gérard believed that Calvin would earn more money as a lawyer than as a priest. After {{a few years of}} quiet study, Calvin entered the University of Bourges in 1529. He was intrigued by Andreas Alciati, a humanist lawyer. Humanism was a European intellectual movement which stressed <b>classical</b> <b>studies.</b> During his 18-month stay in Bourges, Calvin learned Koine Greek, a necessity for studying the New Testament.|$|E

His <b>classical</b> <b>studies</b> began in his home town; he moved to Paris after his father's death to study at the Collège Rollin in Paris—a residential school {{for the children of}} the French upper-class. In Paris he became interested in the evolution and history of manuscripts and books. During the Franco-Prussian War of 1870–1871 he was attached to a school at Richmond in England. Continuing with law studies, he abandoned this line of work when he came into an inheritance in 1872, allowing him to pursue his literary interests.|$|E
