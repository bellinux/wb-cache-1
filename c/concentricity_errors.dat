40|$|A {{brief summary}} of the design, {{integration}} and testing of a rotor alone nacelle (RAN) in NASA Glenn's 9 'x 15 ' Low Speed Wind Tunnel (LSWT) is presented. The purpose of the RAN system was to provide an "acoustically clean" flow path within the nacelle to isolate {{that portion of the}} total engine system acoustic signature attributed to fan noise. The RAN design accomplished this by removing the stators that provided internal support to the nacelle. In its place, two external struts mounted to a two-axis positioning table located behind the tunnel wall provided the support. Nacelle-mounted lasers and a closed-loop control system provided the input to the table to maintain nacelle to fan concentricity as thermal and thrust loads displaced the strut-mounted fan. This unique design required extensive analysis and verification testing {{to ensure the safety of}} the fan model, propulsion simulator drive rig, and facility, along with experimental consistency of acoustic data obtained while using the RAN system. Initial testing was used to optimize the positioning system and resulted in <b>concentricity</b> <b>errors</b> of +/- 0. 0031 in. in the horizontal direction and + 0. 0035 /- 0. 0013 in, in the vertical direction. As a result of successful testing, the RAN system will be transitioned into other acoustic research programs at NASA Glenn Research Center...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. This study {{aimed to}} {{determine}} the degree of eccentricity between different tungsten carbide bur manufacturing techniques and to study the effect of bur inaccuracy on dental enamel. Error in bur concentricity may arise from malalignment of the steel shaft and carbide head in a two-piece construction bur. Cutting blades rotate at multiple radii from the shaft axis, potentially producing vibrations and damage to the cut substrate. Techniques now allow for the manufacture of one-piece tungsten carbide burs with strength adequate to withstand lateral loading. A comparison of tungsten carbide dental cutting tools revealed the true extent of <b>concentricity</b> <b>errors.</b> Variation in alignment of the cutting head and shaft in the two-part constructions incurred between 20 and 50 pm of additional axial error. High-speed cutting interactions with dental enamel between carbide burs were studied {{by means of a}} video-rate confocal microscope. A cutting stage fitted to a Tandem Scanning Microscope (TSM) allowed for real-time dynamic image acquisition. Images were captured and retrieved by means of a low-light-level camera recording directly to S-VHS videotape. Videotape showing the interactions of high-speed rotary cutting instruments (at 120, 000 rpm) were taken under simulated normal wet-cutting environments, and the consequent damage to the tooth tissue was observed as it occurred. Concentrically engineered bur types produced a superior quality cut surface at the entry, exit, and advancing front aspects of a cavity, as well as less subsurface cracking. Imaging of the coolant water film local to recent cutting operations showed regular spherical cutting debris of 6 to 18 pm diameter from the concentric tools, whereas the less-well-engineered burs produced ragged, irregular chips, with 25 - 40 pm diameter debris, indicating far more aggressive cutting actions. This study has shown that there is reduced substrate damage with high-concentricity carbide burs...|$|E
40|$|The {{insertion}} loss of fiber-optic components {{is one of}} the most important parameters that determine the performance of fiber-optic transmission systems. Some of the most widely used components in fiber optics systems are fiber optic connectors. To achieve a low loss connection between two optical fibers, precise and accurate alignment of their cores is essential. To achieve good quality alignment in a typical connector, high accuracy and precision must be maintained with respect to all connector ferrule geometrical parameters such as concentricity error, outside diameter, micro-hole diameter and end radius. Having an accurate measurement method for these parameters is a fundamental need for the connector manufacturing industry to asses and control their manufacturing processes. Up to now, the industry was unable to directly measure ferrule concentricity because all current standard test methods measure a combination of ferrule outside diameter roundness error and concentricity error. However, it is important to distinguish between concentricity error and roundness error because the ferrules are inserted into a ceramic sleeve that mostly accommodates the roundness error of the ferrule. At the same time, ferrule roundness error is an important parameter of the ferrule and it should not be ignored. A clear separation between the measurement of ferrule concentricity and roundness error would improve the concentricity measurement accuracy, resulting in better process controls and a subsequent reduction of connector {{insertion loss}} in the field. The new method proposed in this thesis, allows the concentricity error to be separated from the roundness error. The mechanical configuration of the method is identical to the standard surface reference method but more sophisticated analysis is employed. In the proposed method, the concentricity and roundness errors are calculated using a discrete Fourier transform (DFT). Because the frequency components generated by the DFT are orthogonal, the roundness and <b>concentricity</b> <b>errors</b> are also orthogonal when calculated by this method, and thus are separate. The proposed method will yield a more accurate measurement of installed concentricity while providing an accurate roundness error measurement at the same time. This method will not only improve the industry's measurement capability but it will also serve as an invaluable tool for process control. Subsequently, the insertion loss of fiber optic connectors will improve. Thus the ultimate goal of the work described in this thesis. is to reduce the loss in optical fiber systems...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: In {{order to}} improve the {{automation}} of end-hole drilling process {{in the production of}} suture needles with thread, a high-precision subpixel-based drilling method is proposed. According to the edge detection principle in mathematical morphology, combined with the characteristics of the magnified images of the ends of suture needles to be drilled, the morphological edge detection operators with variable structural elements are constructed to achieve noise suppression and fully extract the detailed information of edges of images of needle end holes to be drilled. Then, the subdivision method of spatial moments is adopted to realize the subpixel positioning of pixel-level edges. Finally, least squares fitting method is used to achieve the high-precision positioning of center of needle end hole to be drilled. The experimental results of the 0. 5 mm needle samples show that, the drilling method proposed in this study has a <b>concentricity</b> <b>error</b> no more than ± 0. 2 µm and an average drilling time of 0. 65 S, boasting good real-time performance and stability and meeting the automated production needs of drilling process of suture needles with thread...|$|R
40|$|Composite {{spur gears}} were {{fabricated}} and then tested at NASA Glenn Research Center. The composite material {{served as the}} web of the gear between the gear teeth and a metallic hub for mounting to the torque-applying shaft. The composite web was bonded only to {{the inner and outer}} hexagonal features that were machined from an initially all-metallic aerospace quality spur gear. The Hybrid Gear was tested against an all-steel gear and against a mating Hybrid Gear. As a result of the composite to metal fabrication process used, the concentricity of the gears were reduced from their initial high-precision value. Regardless of the <b>concentricity</b> <b>error,</b> the hybrid gears operated successfully for over 300 million cycles at 10000 rpm and 490 in. *lbs torque. Although the design was not optimized for weight, the composite gears were found to be 20 % lighter than the all-steel gears. Free vibration modes and vibration/noise tests were also conduct to compare the vibration and damping characteristic of the Hybrid Gear to all-steel gears. The initial results indicate that this type of hybrid design may have a dramatic effect on drive system weight without sacrificing strength...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} the techniques, equipment, and {{results from the}} optimization of a two-axis traverse actuation system used to maintain concentricity between a sting-mounted fan and a wall-mounted nacelle in the 9 x 15 (9 Foot by 15 Foot Test Section) Low Speed Wind Tunnel (LSWT) at the NASA Glenn Research Center (GRC). The Rotor Alone Nacelle (RAN) system, developed at GRC by the Engineering Design and Analysis Division (EDAD) and the Acoustics Branch, used nacelle-mounted lasers and an automated control system to maintain concentricity as thermal and thrust operating loads displace the fan relative to the nacelle. This effort was critical to ensuring rig/facility safety and experimental consistency of the acoustic data from a statorless, externally supported nacelle configuration. Although the tip clearances were originally predicted to be about 0. 020 in. at maximum rotor (fan) operating speed, proximity probe measurements showed that the nominal clearance was less than 0. 004 in. As a result, the system was optimized through control-loop modifications, active laser cooling, data filtering and averaging, {{and the development of}} strict operational procedures. The resultant <b>concentricity</b> <b>error</b> of RAN was reduced to +/- 0. 0031 in. in the Y-direction (horizontal) and + 0. 0035 in. /- 0. 001 3 in. in the Z-direction (vertical), as determined by error analysis and experimental results. Based on the success of this project, the RAN system will be transitioned to other wind tunnel research programs at NASA GRC...|$|R
40|$|A strong need {{has existed}} {{to develop a}} hard turning process that can replace {{grinding}} as a finishing process, due to its huge benefits in surface integrity and manufacturing flexibility over finish grinding and superfinishing. Due to the significant advances in machine tool accuracy and cutting tool material properties, chucking, {{which has not been}} improved significantly over the last several decades, has become the weakest link in the whole machine processing system. However, the understanding of chucking accuracy is lacking, nor is any systematic research on the improvement of chucking accuracy is available in literature. In this study, methods which enable evaluating, and improving chucking accuracy of a cylindrical workpiece were developed. This study performed systematic error identification and the analyses of the characteristics of the factors that affect chucking accuracy. Then, the formulations of the relation between the measurable factors and the chucking error were carried out as well as a chucking error map. From these analyses and formulations, methods for compensating the error components on chucking accuracy were developed. The methods were tested using the rings of a taper-roller bearing. From the tests of the methods, it was proven that hard turning alone, without any other finishing process such as grinding, can satisfy the same level of form accuracy that is currently achieved by finish grinding. With the developed chucking methods and strategies, the <b>concentricity</b> <b>error</b> could be reduced significantly or eliminated. For the case studied, we achieved about 20 times improvement in concentricity and 30 times in repeatability. The knowledge, created by this research on the improvement of chucking accuracy, can be applied to other operations requiring precision holding of a workpiece or a tool, as well as to general turning operations. ...|$|R
40|$|Drilling of stacks poses great {{challenges}} due {{the heterogeneity}} and abrasiveness of the composites, the chip evacuation through the stack, {{in addition to}} the difference in properties between the metallic and the composite materials. The objective {{of this paper is to}} investigate the effect of drilling conditions such as tool material and geometry and lubrication mode on the hole quality as well as the tool wear in drilling of composite stacks (Carbon Fiber Reinforced Plastics CFRP-Aluminum). The thickness of each material was 19 mm. A 2 -flute uncoated drill was used. Four different cooling modes were applied namely dry, minimum quantity lubrication (MQL) with low pressure (< 1. 5 bar) and high flow rate (400 ml/hr), MQL with high pressure (4. 25 bars) and low flow rate (10 ml/hr), and finally flood cooling. The process control parameters, namely the forces and temperatures were measured using a special fixture design using a Kistler dynamometer and a reflective system with an infrared camera. The quality of the holes was compared in terms of delamination, surface roughness, circularity, <b>concentricity,</b> and diameter <b>errors.</b> The resultant cutting forces were found to be much lower than the thrust forces. The mean forces in the Aluminum were more than double those in the CFRP. Negligible tool wear was observed (less than 60 3 ̆bcm). No indication of thermal damage was found on the circumference of the holes in all the tested conditions. Due to the fact that the CFRP was supported by the Aluminum stack, the exit of the holes was mostly free from delamination. The dry and flood conditions produced holes free from entry delamination, while the holes drilled with MQL had delamination within 24...|$|R
