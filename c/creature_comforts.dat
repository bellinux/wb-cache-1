25|$|After Kunsan AB (K-8) South Korea was {{constructed}} with a suitable runway, the unit relocated there on 18 August 1951. The 808th Engineering Aviation Battalion (US Army) {{had built a}} 5,000-foot runway for the light bombers, but the conditions at the base were still relatively primitive. Many of the <b>creature</b> <b>comforts</b> such as latrines and showers were still under construction.|$|E

25|$|Stop frame {{animation}} {{films and}} commercials painstakingly produced by Aardman Animations and high quality television series {{focusing on the}} natural world have also brought fame and artistic credit to the city. Aardman films Wallace and Gromit, Chicken Run, <b>Creature</b> <b>Comforts</b> and Robbie the Reindeer were all produced in the city, and their premises in St Phillips Marsh hit the news in 2006, when a fire destroyed many of the sets from past productions.|$|E
25|$|During the Second World War American {{servicemen}} {{stationed in}} Europe began {{to experience the}} benefits of the nimble sports cars, particularly in Britain, and many shipped them home on their return. US automakers responded with a pair of home grown two-seat models, the sporting Chevrolet Corvette, a fiberglass-bodied 6-cylinder roadster with few <b>creature</b> <b>comforts</b> introduced in 1953, and the larger, more comfortable, existing component-based Ford Thunderbird. The Thunderbird was a softly sprung car, with a powerful V8 engine, that came both as a convertible and roadster with removable hardtop.|$|E
25|$|Rum {{became an}} {{important}} trade good in the early period of the colony of New South Wales. The value of rum was based upon the lack of coinage among {{the population of the}} colony, and due to the drink's ability to allow its consumer to temporarily forget about the lack of <b>creature</b> <b>comforts</b> available in the new colony. The value of rum was such that convict settlers could be induced to work the lands owned by officers of the New South Wales Corps. Due to rum's popularity among the settlers, the colony gained a reputation for drunkenness, though their alcohol consumption was less than levels commonly consumed in England at the time.|$|E

50|$|In {{the design}} of great 18th-century houses comfort and {{convenience}} were subservient to magnificence, and this is certainly the case at Blenheim. This magnificence over <b>creature</b> <b>comfort</b> is heightened as the architect's brief was to create not only a home but also a national monument to reflect the power and civilisation of the nation. To create this monumental effect, Vanbrugh chose to design in a severe form of Baroque, using great masses of stone to imitate strength and create shadow as decoration.|$|R

When he tells her this, Selma is devastated to {{have been used by}} yet another terrible husband. For a while, she attempts {{to go along with the}} ruse, if only for the <b>creature</b> <b>comforts</b> she can access. When Troy says they need to have a child to divert public attention from rumors of his fetish involving aquarium fish, Selma knows this is a line she will not cross, and they divorce.|$|E
500|$|Jim Suptic {{went on to}} form Blackpool Lights {{with former}} members of Butterglory and The <b>Creature</b> <b>Comforts.</b> The band {{released}} their debut album This Town's Disaster in 2006, consisted largely of songs Suptic wrote for The Get Up Kids but never recorded. The album was released on Curb Appeal Records, an independent label Suptic founded with former Get Up Kids collaborator and local musician Alex Brahl. The label released albums by Smoking Popes and The New Amsterdams, but dissolved sometime in 2008. The exact reasons why were never revealed, but Suptic said only that it [...] "blew up in [...] face." [...] After {{the closure of the}} label, Suptic began working at Home Depot to support his family.|$|E
500|$|Shortly {{after the}} 1977 Aldeburgh Festival, Imogen became seriously ill {{with what she}} {{described}} as [...] "a coronary angina". Thereafter, angina was a recurrent problem, although she continued to work and fulfil engagements. By early 1984 the deterioration in her health was noticeable to her friends. She died at home of heart failure on 9 March 1984 and was buried in Aldeburgh churchyard five days later in a plot next to Britten's. An obituary tribute in the magazine Early Music emphasised her long association with music in the Aldeburgh church, where she [...] " [...] iridescently to life facets of that tradition to which her own life had been dedicated and which she presented as a continuing source of strength and wonder". [...] Ursula Vaughan Williams wrote: [...] "Imogen had something of the medieval scholar about her... content with few <b>creature</b> <b>comforts</b> if there was enough music, enough work, enough books to fill her days. Indeed, she always filled her days, making twenty-four hours contain {{what most of us}} need twice that time to do".|$|E

"I make bold to ask," [...] {{replied the}} man, [...] "whether you {{would choose to}} partake of some <b>creature</b> <b>comfort,</b> before joining in prayer with the family and friends of our {{deceased}} sister?" [...] As he spoke, {{he pointed to a}} table, on which was a moderate-sized stone jug and two or three broken glasses; for then, as now, there were few occasions of joy or grief on which ardent spirits were not considered indispensable, to heighten the one or to alleviate the other.|$|R
50|$|November 1968 saw the {{introduction}} of the 800A, which replaced the 800. Improvements included more <b>creature</b> <b>comfort</b> options, a slightly different front end treatment, drivetrain upgrades (heavier rear axle and quieter Dana 20 transfer case) and the options of: 196 four-cylinder, 232 six-cylinder, 266 V8, or the 304 V8. The inline-six was only offered for a short period in early 1969. The 800A's grille was in three segments: the center grill and two matte black headlight bezels. The Light Line of pickup trucks received bodywork {{similar to that of the}} Scout in late 1969.|$|R
5000|$|Created {{partially}} {{in response}} to {{the state of the economy}} at the time and the resultant shrinkage of the high-end sports car market, the RX-01 undertook a back-to-basics approach of a compact, simple, fun-to-drive, yet inexpensive sports car much like the first generation RX-7. (By this time, the RX-7 had evolved into an uncompromising [...] "super sports car" [...] boasting ultra high performance with little <b>creature</b> <b>comfort</b> and a high price tag.) The RX-01 boasted a radical front end with a floating bumper/spoiler made possible by its compact rotary engine as well as a claimed true 2+2 seating arrangement.|$|R

The aluminum shift knob with reduced shift stroke is shared with the CR. While the CR {{is designed to be}} a pure track car, the Type S is designed for improved handling and retains some <b>creature</b> <b>comforts.</b> Only 1,755 copies of the Type S were made and sold exclusively in Japan.

Luggage space is nearly nonexistent, and you better be OK with the fact that anything short of a Razor scooter will tower over you on the road. But what is all this harping about <b>creature</b> <b>comforts?</b> This is a Caterham Seven after all, the fastest to ever leave the factory and maybe the quickest accelerating car on the planet. That counts more than cupholders any day." ...|$|E
5000|$|Her body {{continued}} to decline. For {{the last five}} years of her life she was unable to move, speak or feed herself. However she {{continued to}} fight her disease becoming an inspiration to everyone who knew her. Walter Hooper writes in his obituary and also Paul Ford notes it in his Companion to Narnia: [...] "As every <b>creature</b> <b>comfort</b> was taken from her, Lucy's faith in God grew and blessed not only her, but also those who knew her. Owen Barfield, touched by her humility, said many times, [...] "I could go down on my knees before my daughter." ...|$|R
5000|$|The Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra trucks {{have been}} {{essentially}} the same for their entire history. However, there are some trim and add-on option variations. Early models included variations in the engine and equipment, but the present differences are slight. The 1999 model year redesign included different grilles and interior trim, and certain features (e.g. Quadrasteer) were included at different times on the two trucks. The GMC Sierra has a luxury package known as [...] "Denali" [...] which adds tons of <b>creature</b> <b>comfort</b> features and design changes. Chevrolet's equivalent to the Denali trim level is the High Country Silverado which {{was introduced in the}} 2014 model year.|$|R
60|$|It {{was raining}} now in earnest {{adding to the}} ape-man's {{discomfort}} and disappointment. He was very angry; but as only direct necessity had ever led him to close in mortal combat with a lion, knowing as he did that he had only luck and agility to pit against the frightful odds of muscle, weight, fangs, and talons, he did not now even consider descending and engaging in so unequal and useless a duel for the mere reward of a little added <b>creature</b> <b>comfort.</b> And so he sat perched in the tree while the rain fell steadily and the lion padded round and round beneath, casting a baleful eye upward after every few steps.|$|R
2500|$|The {{concept of}} the Linux mascot being a penguin came from Linus Torvalds, the creator of Linux. Tux was created by Larry Ewing in 1996 after an initial {{suggestion}} made by Alan Cox and further refined by Linus Torvalds on the Linux kernel mailing list. Torvalds took his inspiration from an image he found on an FTP site, showing a penguin figurine looking strangely like the <b>Creature</b> <b>Comforts</b> characters made by Nick Park. The first person to call the penguin [...] "Tux" [...] was James Hughes, who said that it stood for [...] "(T)orvalds (U)ni(X)". However, tux is also an abbreviation of tuxedo, the outfit which often springs to mind when one sees a penguin.|$|E
2500|$|SRT offered two {{versions}} of the Viper; the SRT Viper and the GTS. [...] The GTS is the premium model offering more <b>creature</b> <b>comforts</b> over the base model. [...] The most notable exterior difference between the two models is the hood. [...] The base model has six functional hood vents while the GTS model only has two. [...] To commemorate the return of the Viper, in 2013 SRT offered a 'launch edition' package available on 150 GTS models. [...] All launch editions were painted in Viper Blue with twin white stripes, came with a serialized dash plaque placed inside their cabins, and their interiors are swathed in Black Laguna leather with contrast stitching.|$|E
2500|$|Throughout 1943–1944, Green {{was posted}} to the Land Headquarters Tactical School where he filled another {{instructional}} position before undertaking the senior officers' tactical course. In December 1944, he deployed to Aitape, New Guinea, as the 6th Division took over {{responsibility for the}} area from US forces. On 9 March 1945 Green was promoted to temporary lieutenant colonel and given command of the 2/11th Battalion; {{at the age of}} only 25 he was the youngest Australian battalion commander during the war. The battalion then took part in the attack on Wewak and operations around Boram during 1945. [...] Conditions were difficult, and during {{the early part of the}} campaign supply lines were constantly raided by the Japanese causing difficulty with rations and <b>creature</b> <b>comforts.</b> [...] Later the battalion suffered significant casualties, but still Green managed to maintain morale and efficiency—all objectives assigned to the unit during the campaign were achieved. As a result, he was later awarded the Distinguished Service Order.|$|E

Murdoch and Claude Burroughs thought there was sufficient time to grab street clothing from their dressing rooms − it was December and their stage costumes were flimsy. For want of <b>creature</b> <b>comfort</b> they became trapped and did not escape. Some actors and stage hands left by the utility doors exiting onto Johnson Street, but the fire on the stage soon became widespread, cutting those exits off.

2500|$|The satirist in Tsvetaeva plays second fiddle {{only to the}} poet-lyricist. Several satirical poems, moreover, {{are among}} Tsvetaeva's best-known works: [...] "The Train of Life" [...] ("Poezd zhizni") and [...] "The Floorcleaners' Song" [...] ("Poloterskaya"), both {{included}} in After Russia, and The Rat-catcher (Krysolov, 1925–1926), a long, folkloric narrative. The target of Tsvetaeva's satire is everything petty and petty bourgeois. Unleashed against such dull <b>creature</b> <b>comforts</b> is the vengeful, unearthly energy of workers both manual and creative. In her notebook, Tsvetaeva writes of [...] "The Floorcleaners' Song": [...] "Overall movement: the floorcleaners ferret out a house's hidden things, they scrub a fire into the door... What do they flush out? Coziness, warmth, tidiness, order... Smells: incense, piety. Bygones. Yesterday... The growing force of their threat is far stronger than the climax." [...] The poem which Tsvetaeva describes as liricheskaia satira, The Rat-Catcher, is loosely based on {{the legend of the}} Pied Piper of Hamelin. The Rat-Catcher, which is also known as The Pied Piper, is considered by some to be the finest of Tsvetaeva's work. It was also partially an act of homage to Heinrich Heine's poem Die Wanderratten. The Rat-Catcher appeared initially, in serial format, in the émigré journal Volia Rossii in 1925-1926 whilst still being written. It was not to appear in the Soviet Union until after the death of Joseph Stalin in 1956. Its hero is the Pied Piper of Hamelin who saves a town from hordes of rats and then leads the town's children away too, in retribution for the citizens' ingratitude. As in the other folkloric narratives, The Ratcatcher's story line emerges indirectly through numerous speaking voices which shift from invective, to extended lyrical flights, to pathos.|$|E
2500|$|In mid June 1885, the Western League disbanded, and a mad rush {{developed}} {{to sign the}} players on the Indianapolis roster, a line-up that included McGuire, Sam Thompson, Sam Crane, Chub Collins, Jim Donnelly, Mox McQuery, Gene Moriarty, and Dan Casey. [...] Sam Thompson later told the colorful story of the Detroit Wolverines' acquisition of the Indianapolis players. [...] Detroit sent two representatives (Marsh and Maloney) to Indianapolis, principally to sign the Hoosiers' battery of Larry McKeon and Jim Keenan. [...] The Wolverines were outbid by the Cincinnati Reds for McKeon and Keenan but wound up with the Hoosiers' manager (Bill Watkins) {{and the rest of the}} team's starting lineup. [...] The only catch was that a 10-day waiting period would allow other teams to outbid Detroit. Marsh and Maloney promptly sent the players to Detroit and quartered them in a hotel there. [...] The next morning, the players were told that the team had arranged a fishing trip for them. [...] The players boarded the steamship Annette and enjoyed the first day and night of successful fishing. After three days, the players became suspicious, but the ship captain laughed when asked when they would return to Detroit. [...] As the players became mutinous on the sixth day, the captain admitted he had been ordered to keep them [...] "out at sea" [...] for 10 days. [...] In another account, Thompson described his 10 days aboard the Annette as follows: [...] "We were prisoners, but well cared-for prisoners. Anything in the line of <b>creature</b> <b>comforts</b> you could find packed away on ice. [...] We lived on the best in the market, and spent the rest of the time in fishing and playing poker, chips having very thoughtfully been provided. On the night of the tenth day, at midnight, we were all taken ashore where Watkins met us and signed us to our contracts." ...|$|E

50|$|Boats tend to {{fall into}} the {{categories}} of (1) racer, (2) racer-cruiser, (3) cruiser-racer, and (4) cruiser; however, there is much subjectivity in the definitions and classifications. Cruising is sailing for the enjoyment of sailing and to reach destinations. Frequently cruisers spend much more time enjoying the amenities of their boats than the sailing aspects, so <b>creature</b> <b>comfort</b> is important. A large pure cruising boat would be likely to have solar panels, wind generated electricity, multiple heads (bathrooms), a complete galley (kitchen), comfortable cabins and even laundry facilities. Many cruiser designs are cutter rigged meaning they carry two headsails, and many have a second mast (mizzen), in the yawl or ketch configuration. Having more sails allows for having smaller individual sails; on a pure cruiser the boats do not change directions frequently, so manipulating multiple sails is not a factor.|$|R
60|$|The {{dinner on}} that day at The Cleeve was not very dull. Peregrine had some hopes {{that the idea of}} the {{marriage}} might be abandoned, and was at any rate much better disposed towards Lady Mason than he had been. He spoke to her, asking her whether she had been out, and suggesting roast mutton or some such <b>creature</b> <b>comfort.</b> This was lost neither on Sir Peregrine nor on Mrs. Orme, and they both exerted themselves {{to say a few words}} in a more cheery tone than had been customary in the house for the last day or two. Lady Mason herself did not say much; but she had sufficient tact to see the effort which was being made; and though she spoke but little she smiled and accepted graciously the courtesies that were tendered to her.|$|R
