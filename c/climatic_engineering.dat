40|$|Under {{the shadow}} of ‘Climate Change’ and ‘Global Warming’ effects and within the arising {{interest}} to sustainable development, this document presents the long-term framework for sustainable development, protecting the natural and historic environment and adapting cities to climate change through Green Infrastructure Planning (GIP). At the national level, the effect of climate change is overheating, with a more frequent sand storm, and major problem of water sacristy and drought. The Case Study Area is particularly vulnerable to, temperature increase, flooding, {{and to some extent}} drought conditions. Policies cover climate change mitigation and adaptation are various, starting from natural resource management, economic development, transportation plan, Green Infrastructure plan up to change of individual behaviour regarding energy consumption. In the course of the thesis framework, Climate Change adaptation is limited to Green Infrastructure application as an integral and important practice of the development process. Green Infrastructure Planning approach is an integration of planning at a different spatial level, so mainly two different special levels define the working environment, namely regional and metropolitan level. Also, Green Infrastructure provides a variety of ecosystem benefits. In the course of this study, the focus is on a certain function related to <b>climatic,</b> <b>engineering</b> and ecological benefits that will be used as the basic principal in developing the Green Infrastructure Plan at both Regional and City scale. The proposed GI Plan for Case Study Region (CSR) is an academic initiative at Regional level to identify and safeguard valued natural and cultural resources. The plan aims to bring together the region’s most important biodiversity areas, historical sites, and natural landscape including natural systems such as streams, Karez, watersheds, scenic landscape, and recreational site and to lesser extent working landscapes. In a dense conurbation like the Case Study City (CSC) where green spaces have to be multi-functional, the green infrastructure refers to the network of all green spaces that provides various benefits to the residents. Therefore the proposed GI Plan for Sulaimaniyah City (CSC) is an academic initiative at the municipal level to identify valued community green space resources. The plan aims to bring together the city most important green space resources with development of a new typology. With the provision of providing better <b>climatic</b> <b>engineering</b> function in and around the existing City, to improve the current climatic condition and as an adaptation strategy for climate change effects. So it is an initiative aiming to contribute to change the traditional conceptual understanding of green resource from something good to have, to an essential multifunctional resource that must be planned and developed in an integrated way...|$|E
40|$|Global {{climate change}} {{is one of the}} most {{important}} international problems of the 21 st century. The overall rapid increase in the dynamics of cataclysms, which have been observed in recent decades, is particularly alarming. Howdo modern scientists predict the occurrence of certain events? In meteorology, unusually powerful cumulonimbus clouds are one of the main conditions for the emergence of a tornado. The former, in their turn, are formed during the invasion of cold air on the overheated land surface. The satellite captures the cloud front, and, based on these pictures, scientists make assumptions about the possibility of occurrence of the respective natural phenomena. In fact, mankind visually observes and draws conclusions about the consequences of the physical phenomena which have already taken place in the invisible world, so the conclusions of scientists are assumptions by their nature, rather than precise knowledge of the causes of theorigin of these phenomena in the physics of microcosm. The latest research in the field of the particle physics and neutrino astrophysics, which was conducted by a working team of scientists of ALLATRA International Public Movement (hereinafter ALLATRA SCIENCE group) allatra-science. org, last accessed 10 April 2016., offers increased opportunities for advanced fundamental and applied research in <b>climatic</b> <b>engineering...</b>|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{influence}} of surface boundary conditions, varying <b>climatic</b> conditions and <b>engineering</b> material parameters on the collection performance of near surface interseasonal ground energy collection and storage systems are investigated. In particular, {{the performance of}} a proposed design of an interseasonal heat storage system which has also been investigated by others as part of a full scale demonstration project is considered. A numerical model is developed and validated against field data. It is then applied to undertake a series of simulations with varying system parameters. It is found that (i) higher values of thermal conductivity of the storage layer result in increased storage of thermal energy and lower peak temperatures, (ii) system heat losses are strongly influenced by the performance of insulation layers, (iii) warmer climatic conditions provide more thermal energy available to be stored; however, changes in the amplitude of seasonal air temperature variations {{have an effect on the}} rate of collection of thermal energy and (iv) the use of correct surface boundary conditions is critical in modelling the dynamics of these systems...|$|R
40|$|Climate {{change and}} climate {{variability}} is receiving much attention recently {{because it has}} significant effects on our power and energy sector and therefore on the socio-economic activities of the society especially in a developing country such as Nigeria. Approach: The aim {{of the study is}} to examine the influence of climate change on power generation. Literatures were identified for review through a comprehensive search by using electronic and non-electronic databases. Related published literature and documents were searched in a systematic way using a range of key words relating to climate change impacts and energy. Results: The literature review indicates that climate change undermine power and energy production by increasingly depleting renewable and non-renewable sources, creating resources scarcity as well as damage to infrastructure. The review also indicate that climate change undermine environmental dimensions by increasing sea-level rise, extreme weather events and land degradation and pollution. Conclusion: In reducing climate-induced threats on power sector, efforts should be geared towards ensuring that our energy sector withstand the changes to our climate that are already underway by optimizing energy mix, developing low carbon and renewable energy, formulating relevant law and regulations and promoting technology advancement and economic <b>engineering.</b> <b>Climatic</b> change, alternative energy, mitigating policy, renewable energy, coal-bed methane, united nations framework, power generation, mitigating policies, global climate models, Nigeria energy scene, Global warming...|$|R
40|$|The {{evapotranspiration}} (ET) flux {{accounts for}} approximately {{two thirds of}} terrestrial precipitation worldwide, and in grassland regions ET is equivalent in magnitude to precipitation. Regional contributions to the terrestrial hydrologic budget, however, have been far from constant {{in the past as}} distribution of vegetation changed dramatically. The rise of grass-dominated ecosystems {{is one of the most}} profound paleoecological changes in the Cenozoic. Why then, would grassland expansion not feature prominently in the record of Neogene hydrologic change? Despite numerous stable isotope paleoenvironmental studies in Neogene North America, the contributions of land cover change have been largely ignored. We present a compilation of 16 oxygen isotope studies of pedogenic carbonate and smectite from western North America, including 4 new records. Nearly all records from California, the Basin and Range, the Rocky Mountains and the Great Plains show increases in View the MathML source on the order of 2 – 6 ‰. In order to assess the role of ET in the hydrologic cycle, we developed an isotopic water vapor transport model wherein we manipulated ET parameters along a specified air mass trajectory. Grasslands lead to View the MathML source of precipitation (View the MathML source) values that are up to 5 ‰ greater than broadleaf and needleleaf vegetation at inland study sites. These results demonstrate that changes in vegetation played a critical role in establishing the modern hydrologic regime in western North America. We suggest that this isotopic increase is due to three primary reasons: 1) Increased evaporation and transpiration fluxes in grassland regions affect water balance, 2) Shallower rooting depths of grasses lead to the transpiration of soil water enriched in View the MathML source due to evaporation, and 3) Grasslands transpire View the MathML source-rich waters during a shorter, more punctuated growing season. We argue that the observed isotope signals are indicative of a feedback mechanism wherein grasslands not only respond to regional and global climatic trends, but also act as a driver of hydrologic change. By enhancing seasonality and aridity, grasslands transmit hydrologic disturbances downstream, <b>engineering</b> <b>climatic</b> conditions favorable for their expansion...|$|R
