25|$|The {{idea of a}} flood <b>control</b> <b>reservoir</b> like Benbrook Lake, is that floodwaters {{from heavy}} rains are {{retained}} above the dam. This reduces river flows downstream of the dam, and so prevents property damage and losses, but lake levels above the dam rise, and lands surrounding the lake are inundated. In other words, flooding is not eliminated, but its location is predetermined—it will be along the undeveloped lakeshore area upstream of the dam, rather than along the industrialized or populated downstream river valley.|$|E
500|$|Not {{far below}} the {{confluence}} with San Timoteo Creek, Lytle Creek enters from the north. Lytle Creek {{is one of the}} largest tributaries of the Santa Ana river, rising from three forks in the San Gabriel Mountains and flowing southeast, before emptying into the Santa Ana River as Lytle Creek Wash. From there, the river turns southwest, and after passing through western Riverside, it discharges into the normally dry flood <b>control</b> <b>reservoir</b> formed by Prado Dam. Two major tributaries of the river join in the reservoir area: Chino Creek from the north, and Temescal Creek from the south. Temescal Creek drains the largest area of all the tributaries, because it provides the outflow from Lake Elsinore, into which the San Jacinto River flows. It is also one of the longest, at [...] in length. Except during the wettest years when Lake Elsinore fills high enough to overflow, Temescal Creek contributes little to no water into the Santa Ana River.|$|E
2500|$|The creek then empties into Irvine Lake, {{which is}} also fed by Limestone Canyon, a left-bank tributary. The [...] {{reservoir}} is formed by the [...] Santiago Dam, located at its north end. Irvine Lake provides water to Villa Park and Orange via a pipeline and flume to Peters Canyon Reservoir. Because the flume diverts the creek's entire flow, the creek below the dam is dry except during floods. Below the dam the dry riverbed meets Fremont Canyon, a right bank tributary, and crosses underneath California State Route 241. It then flows northwest, bisecting Irvine Regional Park, and receives Weir Canyon Creek from the right. Near Villa Park, the Villa Park Dam forms a flood <b>control</b> <b>reservoir</b> to control spills from Irvine Lake. Below Villa Park, the creek is confined to a flood control channel for the remaining [...] of its course. Flowing roughly southwest between the cities of Orange and Santa Ana, it receives Handy Creek from the left, then crosses under California State Route 55 and 22, through Hart Memorial Park and Santiago Creek Park. Because the creek is dry most of the year, portions of the river bed are used as parking lots when conditions permit. The creek then crosses under Interstate 5 and continues west toward the Santa Ana River. Its confluence is on the river's left bank, inside the Riverview Golf Course. About [...] below the confluence with Santiago Creek, the Santa Ana River enters the Pacific Ocean at Huntington Beach.|$|E

This area has always been at risk of flooding, but the people who settled there probably did not know that or they just ignored that fact. Now is the plan to resolve this problem. There are plans to construct flood <b>control</b> <b>reservoirs</b> in municipalities Dobrova – Polhov Gradec and Horjul and to regulate river channels Mali graben in Mestna Gradaščica, which will provide flood safety from floods, which occur every 100 years or less.
