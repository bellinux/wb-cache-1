5|$|There are {{a variety}} of ways to {{approach}} the game's situations: players can use a violent approach and shoot their way through environments while using cover to hide from enemy fire. Alternately, Adam can take a stealthy approach, avoiding guards and security devices, again using cover to avoid enemy sight lines. Adam can move between <b>cover</b> <b>elements</b> and around corners while staying hidden. The melee takedown system offers lethal and non-lethal options, in addition to an assortment of lethal and non-lethal weapons. Adam can also move the bodies of enemies into hiding places, preventing them from being seen and raising an alarm. A key part of Adam's abilities are augmentations, which can be acquired and upgraded using Praxis Kits either bought from special vendors, found in the game environments, or are automatically unlocked by leveling up: higher-level augmentations require more Praxis Kits to unlock. Augmentation functions can range from passive enhancements to Adam's vision or damage resistance, to active upgrades such as allowing Adam to fall from great heights without being injured or increase his strength. Some augmentations are dependent on Adam's energy level, deactivating after an amount of energy has been drained.|$|E

It is exactly this asymmetry that makes LSB embedding easily detectable [14, 16, 17].

40|$|This paper proposes an {{optimized}} LSB matching steganography {{based on}} Fisher Information. The embedding algorithm {{is designed to}} solve the optimization problem, in which Fisher information is the objective function and embedding transferring probabilities are variables to be optimized. Fisher information is the quadratic function of the embedding transferring probabilities, and the coefficients of quadratic term {{are determined by the}} joint probability distribution of <b>cover</b> <b>elements.</b> By modeling the groups of elements in a cover image as Gaussian mixture model, the joint probability distribution of <b>cover</b> <b>elements</b> for each cover image is obtained by estimating the parameters of Gaussian mixture distribution. For each sub-Gaussian distribution in Gaussian mixture distribution, the quadratic term coefficients of Fisher information are calculated, and the optimized embedding transferring probabilities are solved by quadratic programming. By maximum posteriori probability principle, cover pixels are classified as the categories corresponding to sub-Gaussian distributions. At last, in order to embed message bits, pixels chose to add or subtract one according to the optimized transferring probabilities of the category. The experiments show that the security performance of this new algorithm is better than the existing LSB matching. </p...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we are going}} to learn about the {{minimization}} of distortion in steganography. For this purpose we use a general nonbinary embedding operation and discuss various system requirements. We assume every possible value of stego element by assigning a scalar which expresses the distortion of a embedding change done by replacing the cover element by this value. The total distortion is assumed to be a sum of per-element distortions. Both the payload-limited sender (minimizing the total distortion while embedding a fixed payload) and the distortion-limited sender (maximizing the payload while introducing a fixed total distortion) are considered. Nonbinary case is decomposed into several binary cases by replacing individual bits in <b>cover</b> <b>elements,</b> but there is no loss of performance. Using a novel syndrome-coding scheme, the binary case is approached and these are based on dual convolution codes equipped with the Viterbi algorithm. This fast and very versatile solution achieves state-of-the-art results in steganographic applications while having linear time and space complexity with respect to the number of <b>cover</b> <b>elements.</b> Practical merit of this approach is validated by constructing and testing adaptive embedding schemes for digital images.

40|$|By {{working with}} high-dimensional {{representations}} of covers, modern steganographic methods {{are capable of}} preserving {{a large number of}} complex dependencies among individual <b>cover</b> <b>elements</b> and thus avoid detection using current best steganalyzers. Inevitably, steganalysis needs to start using high-dimensional feature sets as well. This brings two key problems – construction of good high-dimensional features and machine learning that scales well with respect to dimensionality. Depending on the classifier, high dimensionality may lead to problems with the lack of training data, infeasibly high complexity of training, degradation of generalization abilities, lack of robustness to cover source, and saturation of performance below its potential. To address these problems collectively known as the curse of dimensionality, we propose ensemble classifiers {{as an alternative to the}} much more complex support vector machines. Based on the character of the media being analyzed, the steganalyst first puts together a high-dimensional set of diverse “prefeatures ” selected to capture dependencies among individual <b>cover</b> <b>elements.</b> Then, a family of weak classifiers is built on random subspaces of the prefeature space. The final classifier is constructed by fusing the decisions of individual classifiers. The advantage of this approach is its universality, low complexity, simplicity, and improved performance when compared to classifiers trained on the entire prefeature set. Experiments with the steganographic algorithms nsF 5 and HUGO demonstrate the usefulness of this approach over current state of the art. 1...|$|E
