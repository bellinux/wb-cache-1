Two experiments {{were designed to}} investigate the perceived optical flow in different driving environments using two driving simulators: 1) a fixed base simulator and 2) a turning cabin simulator whose turning cabin rotates around the y-axis. In the first experiment, the perception of optical flow when making left/right turns was studied using both simulators. Results revealed that subjects experienced a higher amount of optical flow when making right turns then left turns. In addition, the optical flow perceived by drivers in the fixed base simulator was greater than that in the turning cabin simulator. We designed the second experiment to investigate the optical flow perceived when driving straight ahead, driving on <b>circular</b> <b>curves,</b> and driving on curves with transitions (clothoids). Again, two simulators were used. The amount of optical flow was highest when driving on <b>circular</b> <b>curves,</b> and was lowest when driving straight ahead.

By comparing the surveyed versine figures to the design versines, this can then be used to determine what slues should be applied to the track {{in order to make the}} curve correctly aligned. This is often done using pegs which are driven into the ground in the cess beside the track to be aligned. The process of putting the pegs in the correct positions is known as 'setting out'.If the curve needs to be of a desired constant radius, which will usually be determined by physical obstructions and the degree of cant which is permitted, the versine can be calculated for the desired radius using this approximation. In practice, many track curves are transition curves and so have changing radii. In order to maintain a smooth transition, the differences in versines between consecutive half chords are measured and minimised.|$|E

Although the design policies of many countries encourage the use of spiral transition curves, questions still exist as to whether spiral transition curves have any benefit in roadway design. The findings of previous research based on simulation models and driver behavior on <b>circular</b> <b>curves</b> have produced varying conclusions. In addition, speed prediction models that have been developed in the United States do not account for the presence of spiral transitions. The objective of this research was to determine if the presence of spiral transition curves affected the speed in which vehicles traversed a horizontal curve. If spiral transitions were found to {{have a significant effect on}} vehicle speed, a parameter quantifying the effect would be created and included in speed-profile models. To accomplish the objective of this research vehicle speeds on curves with spiral transitions were compared to <b>circular</b> <b>curves</b> with similar geometric conditions. Using regression techniques and the full data set, the presence of spiral transitions was not found to significantly affect the 85 th percentile speed of drivers on horizontal curves. A model was created to predict 85 th percentile speed for both spiral transition <b>curves</b> and <b>circular</b> <b>curves</b> which had the same form as previous models using only <b>circular</b> <b>curves.</b> Analysis of the individual speed data categorized by curve radius showed that for a curve radius of 145 meters, speeds were slightly higher for curves with spiral transitions. Although no data were available to further test the hypothesis, it is believed that the presence of spiral transitions may have a greater affect on vehicle speeds as the curve radius decreases. Based on the results of this research, it was concluded that for the range of data analyzed, the presence of spiral transitions was not shown to produce any significant differences in operating speeds for passenger cars. Therefore, it is recommended that speed prediction models do not have to account for the presence of spiral transitions when used to estimate 85 th percentile speeds of passenger cars on horizontal curves...|$|R

Boardman also incorporated into {{the design of the}} new hotel part of the interior decoration of the former solicitor’s offices which had stood on the site. The offices had contained a particularly fine example of a plasterwork ceiling laid on oak lath measuring 17 ft by 30 ft. This section of ceiling had been very carefully removed and was installed in the new first floor drawing room in the hotel, along with French casements to the balcony. The Hotel was six storeys high which included a basement. Many of the front elevation windows were mullioned. Over the front entrance to the Hotel there is a balcony with intricately sculpted brick latticework. This exterior decorative brickwork is known as Costesseyware, with the materials for this work being supplied from the brick works of George Gunton in Costessey. These bricks are to be found on many building in and around Norwich and were used and promoted by local architects such as Boardman and George Skipper. This method of brickwork was easily rubbed and shaped to form intricate patterns and sculptures. The front elevation of the building is a built in a semi <b>circular</b> <b>curve</b> running from the top of Prince of Wales Road into Bank Plain and has three gable end incorporated into the curve all of which have further alternating brickwork decorative detailing.
