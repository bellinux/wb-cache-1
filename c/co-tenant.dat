25|$|These {{plans were}} revised after the Victory refused {{to commit to}} playing at such a small {{capacity}} stadium. On 23 May 2007, the club announced it had signed as a founding <b>co-tenant</b> of the new stadium, which would now be built to accommodate a maximum of 30,050 spectators with further renovations to 50,000 possible. However, further expansion in the near-term is unlikely as it was discovered during Australia's World Cup Bid process that to build such an expansion would be prohibitively expensive.|$|E
25|$|Through the 1990s {{there was}} a {{significant}} trend of Melbourne-based teams abandoning the use of their small (20,000–30,000 capacity) suburban venues for home matches in favour of the larger MCG and Waverley Park. The 1990s saw the last matches played at Windy Hill (Essendon), Moorabbin Oval (St Kilda), Western Oval (Footscray) and Victoria Park (Collingwood) and saw Princes Park abandoned by its long-term <b>co-tenant</b> Hawthorn. The transition to the use of only two venues in Melbourne was ultimately completed in 2005 when Carlton abandoned the use of Princes Park. In 1999, the league sold Waverley Park stadium and used the funds in a joint venture to begin construction of a brand-new stadium situated at Melbourne's Docklands. Representative state football came to an end, with the last State of Origin match held in 1999.|$|E
40|$|The article {{discusses}} {{the rules of}} tenancy and standard doctrine in relation to identity property. It explains the result for property law and suggests reforms that would decrease conflict among heirs to identity property to successfully own and manage the property. It states that <b>co-tenants</b> receive a proportional share of rents and profits earned and should pay taxes and mortgages. It informs that steps could be taken to encourage the interest of <b>co-tenants...</b>|$|R

25|$|For a long time, the Twins {{wished to}} move from Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome to a site behind Target Center within the next half decade, {{claiming}} that Metrodome generated too little revenue for the Twins to be competitive. In particular, the Twins received very little revenue from luxury suite leasing (as the majority are owned by the <b>co-tenant</b> Minnesota Vikings) and {{only a small percentage}} of concessions sales; also, the percentage of season-ticket-quality seats in Metrodome was said to be very low compared to other stadiums, and the capacity of the stadium is far too high for baseball. However, attempts to spur interest and push legislative efforts towards a new stadium repeatedly failed prior to 2006. The Dome was thought to be an increasingly poor fit for all three of its major tenants (the Twins, the Vikings and the University of Minnesota Golden Gophers football team).|$|E
25|$|The {{manufacture}} of blades, gun barrels, spades and spade handles {{as well as}} the grinding of knives, bayonets and axes, mainly at mills constructed at pools in Sutton Park and on the banks of Ebrook, became an important contributor to the town's economy in the 17th century. The blade mill at Bracebridge Pool fell out of use by 1678 and was destroyed, however, it was reconstructed by 1729. The creation of Longmoor Pool, caused by the damming of Longmoor Brook in Longmoor Valley, was approved in 1733 and carried about by John Riland, who built a mill there in 1754 with his <b>co-tenant</b> for the {{manufacture of}} buttons. Blackroot Pool was also constructed in around 1757 by Edward Homer and Joseph Duncomb. In 1772, the Warden and Society of the town gave a lease of 30 years to Thomas Ingram at the pool. The mill at Blackroot Pool was originally used for leather dressing, although later became a sawmill.|$|E
500|$|In 1996, as Seattle Seahawks owner Paul Allen {{worked with}} the city {{to build a new}} {{football}} stadium for his team, the potential of an MLS expansion team that could be a <b>co-tenant</b> helped drive public support for the effort. Many of the state's voters supported the referendum to construct Seahawks Stadium because it was also expected to be a professional soccer venue. While the stadium problem was being resolved, a new issue emerged. [...] By 2000, MLS was moving away from league-operated teams to investor-operated teams, so wealthy individuals would need to step forward for Seattle to obtain an MLS expansion team.|$|E

500|$|At Eynsford, with Moeran as his <b>co-tenant,</b> Heseltine {{presided over}} a bohemian {{household}} with a flexible population of artists, musicians and friends. Moeran had studied at the Royal College of Music {{before and after the}} First World War; he avidly collected folk music and had admired Delius during his youth. Although they had much in common, he and Heseltine rarely worked together, though they did co-write a song, [...] "Maltworms". The other permanent Eynsford residents were Barbara Peache, Heseltine's long-term girlfriend whom he had known since the early 1920s, and Hal Collins, a New Zealand Māori who acted as a general [...] Peache was described by Delius's assistant Eric Fenby as [...] "a very quiet, attractive girl, quite different from Phil's usual types". Although not formally trained, Collins was a gifted graphic designer and occasional composer, who sometimes assisted Heseltine. The household was augmented at various times by the composers William Walton and Constant Lambert, the artist Nina Hamnett, and sundry acquaintances of both sexes.|$|E

The rodeo is held three weeks in March, each year. During this time NRG Stadium also hosts an event on the Xtreme Bulls tour, the bull riding-only tour {{that is part of the}} PRCA, who also hosts the Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo.|$|E

50|$|As {{the season}} began, the Braves {{refused to sign}} the lease terms for Memorial Auditorium because Braves owner Paul Snyder felt it was unfair for the Braves to be held to {{different}} terms than their <b>co-tenant,</b> the Buffalo Sabres.

50|$|On March 31, 2015, the {{bankruptcy}} court approved a $160 million offer by the Standard General affiliate General Wireless, gaining ownership of 1,743 RadioShack locations. As {{part of the}} deal, the company entered into a partnership with Sprint, in which the company would become a <b>co-tenant</b> at 1,435 RadioShack locations and establish store within a store areas devoted to selling its wireless brands, including Sprint, Boost Mobile and Virgin Mobile. The stores would collect commissions {{on the sale of}} Sprint products, and Sprint would assist in promotion. Sprint stated that this arrangement would increase the company's retail footprint by more than double; the company previously had around 1,100 company-owned retail outlets, in comparison to the over 2,000 run by AT&T Mobility. Although they would be treated as a <b>co-tenant,</b> the Sprint branding would be more prominent in promotion and exterior signage than that of RadioShack. The acquisition did not include rights to RadioShack's intellectual property (such as its trademarks), rights to RadioShack's franchised locations, and customer records, which were to be sold separately.|$|E
