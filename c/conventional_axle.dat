50|$|Although hubless {{wheels are}} {{striking}} in appearance, their numerous practical disadvantages have precluded their widespread {{use as an}} alternative to conventional wheels. They are difficult and expensive to manufacture, requiring a great deal of precision machining, and the design leaves the bearings and other mechanical parts largely exposed to the elements. The drive system is especially problematic since a <b>conventional</b> <b>axle</b> and CV joint cannot be used; options include using chain or belt drive. Another solution, developed by Sbarro, is to house the entire propulsion system inside the wheel itself.|$|E

50|$|An {{advantage}} of the H-drive was the low overall body height as the hull could sit between the suspension units, rather than above axles; this is apparent because a derivative of the Daimler Dingo using <b>conventional</b> <b>axles</b> (the Canadian Lynx Scout Car) was a foot higher overall, (70 in vs 59 in).|$|R

50|$|The G.I had a {{conventional}} undercarriage with two mainwheels and a tailskid. Originally each wheel was {{mounted on a}} V-shaped pair of struts and a half axle attached to a central frame.

40|$|Condition {{changes at}} the rail surface due to the fallen tree leaves and/or other {{contaminations}} can cause the low adhesion levels which present a serious challenge for the traction/braking control systems to avoid the problem of wheel slip/slide. This paper presents a multiple model based method for {{the identification of the}} adhesion limit to overcome the problem of the wheel slip/slide in poor contact conditions. The proposed scheme is an indirect method that exploits the dynamic properties of the <b>conventional</b> solid <b>axle</b> wheelset in response to changes in contact condition at the wheel-rail interface avoiding difficult and expensive measurement requirements. A nonlinear model of lateral and yaw dynamics of a <b>conventional</b> solid <b>axle</b> wheelset is used for the study. The non-linearity and changes in the interaction with the rail are modelled by using a set of non-linear creep/slip curves. The scheme consists of a bank of Kalman filters based on the linearized wheelset models. Each Kalman filter in the filter bank is optimally tuned to operate in a specific contact condition. Normalized root mean square values from the residual of each filter calculated using time moving windows are assessed to identify the operating condition of the wheelset...|$|R
50|$|The {{front end}} of the 600 was {{virtually}} unchanged from the Isetta, but the 600's wheelbase was stretched to accommodate four seats. A <b>conventional</b> rear <b>axle</b> was added. BMW introduced the semi-trailing arm independent suspension on the 600. This suspension would be used on almost every new model for the next four decades. Because of the increased size and weight, the 600 had a more powerful engine than the Isetta. The 600 had the 582 cc twin engine from the R67 motorcycle. Top speed was 103 km/h.|$|R
50|$|For {{military}} applications {{the selection}} includes both <b>conventional</b> rigid <b>axles</b> {{as well as}} independent suspension systems, all of them being driven with planetary reduction. Both the steering and non-steering rigid axles are with 10-14 tonnes capacities and the tandem applications with double capacity, 20-28 tonnes. The brakes used on rigid axles are predominantly S-cam type; the heavier steering axles are equipped with wedge brakes. The independent suspension systems are for 6×6, 8×8 and 10×10 layouts with 6 to 8 tonnes capacity per axle. The brakes are either disc or wedge type.|$|R
5000|$|It was a two-seat single-engined trainer {{of single}} bay biplane layout. [...] The wings, which folded for {{transport}} had parallel chord, no sweep {{and very little}} stagger and there were ailerons on both planes. The upper wing had a rounded cut out for improved visibility from the rear cockpit; the forward cockpit was under the wing.

The exterior was painted white with a black stripe and the interior was painted bright orange.|$|R

40|$|Whilst <b>conventional,</b> rigid <b>axle</b> railway {{wheelsets}} {{are inherently}} simple, reliable and relatively inexpensive, they have well known limitations {{with regard to}} the competing requirements of steering and stability. A wide range of mechanical and mechatronic solutions have been proposed to overcome these limitations and to allow near-radial steering in sharp curves. This paper discusses some considerations in the design and development of wheelmotor active steering technology for light rail vehicles (LRVs), where each wheel incorporates a traction motor which can be driven independently of the other. This arrangement is considered to have some advantages over similar mechatronic approaches which use actuators in the primary longitudinal / yaw suspension...|$|R

50|$|In {{addition}} to the Iso Turismo not described above, Iso also built the Autocarro, a commercial version with full-width rear axle. The Autocarro was offered in several body styles, a flatbed pickup, enclosed truck, a tilt-bed, or even a fire engine, although some of these {{might not have been}} sold. The Autocarro was an extremely popular type of vehicle in Italy, and numerous manufacturers produced some variant of the type. Iso had previously produced a motorcycle-type Isocarro. The Iso Autocarro was larger than most, with its four-wheel layout, <b>conventional</b> rear <b>axle</b> with differential and leaf springs, and a large tubular frame. It could carry a 500 kg load. The name Isetta Autocarro was also used. It is thought that more than 4,000 Autocarros were built.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The hollow {{design of}} a railway axle {{is one of the}} most {{effective}} methods to reduce the weight of an <b>axle.</b> However, the <b>conventional</b> hollow <b>axle</b> has the limitation of a lightweight design because it has the same bore diameter along the axial position. The new type of railway axle, the tapered inner surface railway axle, has a different inner diameter between the journal bearing seat and wheel seat. This design method is one way to increase the weight reduction possibility. The purpose of the present study is to establish and evaluate the design of the tapered inner surface railway axle. The case study and Finite Element Method(FEM) are applied to evaluate the strength of the lightweight railway axle according to the European Norm(EN 13103). Finally, the best design case for reducing th...|$|R

5|$|General manager Kytölä {{travelled}} to France and West Germany in 1947 {{and early}} 1948 to buy military surplus {{materials from the}} Western Allies.

Trading was organised through the Ministry of Supply and the first delivery arrived in March 1948. The White Half-Track vehicles were without armour; Kytölä's idea was to equip them with superstructures for field or forest clearing, or to convert them into Four-wheel drive lorries by replacing the tracks with a <b>conventional</b> rear <b>axle.</b> In total, VAT sold 359 units as half-tracks, and 60 were converted into 4×4 or 4×2 vehicles. These lorries were sold as Vanaja VaWh. Some of the half-track vehicles were scrapped for parts; the last was sold in 1952.|$|R
50|$|The PWS-4 was a {{single-seater}} high-wing braced monoplane {{of wooden}} construction.

The rectangular wooden wings had two spars; were covered with plywood in front and fabric in the rear; and were supported with pairs of twin struts.

The bonnet was longer than the Oxford's to take the overhead camshaft, single SU carburettor, 2215 cc six-cylinder engine which produced [...] at 4800 rpm. The whole car was longer than the Oxford with a wheelbase of 110 in against 97 in. Suspension was independent at the front using torsion bars and at the rear there was a <b>conventional</b> live <b>axle</b> and semi elliptic springs. The steering was not by the rack and pinion method fitted to the Oxford but used a lower geared Bishop Cam system. The 10 in drum brakes were hydraulically operated using a Lockheed system. Production was delayed until March 1949 because of difficulties with metal fatigue in the bulkhead or scuttle's link to the front suspension.|$|R
