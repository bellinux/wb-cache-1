5|$|Meanwhile, Records {{found that}} the plane {{did not respond to}} his <b>control</b> <b>column.</b> Even with the <b>control</b> <b>column</b> turned {{all the way to the}} left, {{commanding}} maximum left aileron, and pulled all the way back, commanding maximum up elevatorinputs that would never be used together in normal flight, commanding a roll to the left and the aircraft's nose to risethe aircraft was instead banking to the right with the nose dropping. Haynes attempted to level the aircraft with his own <b>control</b> <b>column,</b> then both Haynes and Records tried using their control columns together, but the aircraft still did not respond. Afraid the aircraft would roll into a completely inverted position (an unrecoverable situation), the crew reduced the left wingmounted engine to idle and applied maximum power to the right engine. This caused the airplane to slowly level out.|$|E
5|$|The control {{surfaces}} operated {{in much the}} same way as other aircraft, with the exception of the innovative automatic pull-out system. Releasing the bomb initiated the pull-out, or automatic recovery and climb, upon the deflection of the dive brakes. The pilot could override the system by exerting significant force on the <b>control</b> <b>column</b> and taking manual control.|$|E
5|$|The {{offensive}} armament was two 7.92mm (.312in) MG 17 {{machine guns}} fitted {{one in each}} wing outboard of undercarriage, operated by a mechanical pneumatics system from the pilot's <b>control</b> <b>column.</b> The rear gunner/radio operator operated one 7.92mm (.312in) MG 15 machine gun for defensive purposes.|$|E

5|$|The pilots felt a jolt, and the {{autopilot}} disengaged. As Records {{took hold of}} his <b>control</b> <b>column,</b> Haynes focused on the tail engine, whose instruments indicated it was malfunctioning; he found its throttle and fuel supply controls jammed. At Dvorak's suggestion, a valve cutting fuel to the tail engine was shut off. This part of the emergency took 14 seconds.|$|E
5|$|Haynes asked Fitch {{to observe}} the ailerons through the {{passenger}} cabin windows to see if control inputs were having any effect. Fitch reported back that the ailerons were not moving at all. Nonetheless, the crew continued to manipulate their control columns {{for the remainder of}} the flight, hoping for at least some effect. Haynes then asked Fitch to take over control of the throttles so that Haynes could concentrate on his <b>control</b> <b>column.</b> With one throttle in each hand, Fitch was able to mitigate the phugoid cycle and make rough steering adjustments.|$|E
5|$|Reports {{into the}} crash by the Greek Air Force, and an {{independent}} investigator hired by Onassis, the Englishman Alan Hunter, concluded that it had occurred {{as a result of}} the reversing of the aileron connecting cables during the installation of a new <b>control</b> <b>column.</b> This cause was disputed by McGregor who believed that the wake turbulence from an Air France Boeing 727 that had taken off before them had caused the crash.|$|E

5|$|The Z-4 was {{designed}} as trainer. Although nearly identical to the Z-2 and Z-3, it featured several equipment changes optimised for blind flying training. The four-seat aircraft had a single <b>control</b> <b>column</b> with dual steering, which was achieved by a jib protruding to the right. Rudder pedals were in front of both seats. The defensive armament and bomb racks were reduced, or in most cases omitted to reduce weight.|$|E
5|$|Wind {{tunnel and}} flight {{simulator}} {{tests were conducted}} to help to understand the trajectory of the aircraft after the engine detached and the left wing slats retracted. Those tests established that {{the damage to the}} wing's leading edge and retraction of the slats increased the stall speed of the left wing from 124 knots (143mph) to 159 knots (183mph). The DC-10 incorporates two warning devices that might have alerted the pilots to the impending stall: the slat disagreement warning light, which should have illuminated after the uncommanded retraction of the slats, and the stick shaker on the captain's <b>control</b> <b>column,</b> which activates close to the stall speed. Both of these warning devices were powered by an electric generator driven by the number one engine. Both systems became inoperative after the loss of that engine. The first officer's <b>control</b> <b>column</b> was not equipped with a stick shaker; the device was offered by McDonnell Douglas as an option for the first officer, but American Airlines chose not to have it installed on its DC-10 fleet. Stick shakers for both pilots became mandatory in response to this accident.|$|E
5|$|MacLachlan {{reported}} to No. 1 Depot, RAF Uxbridge {{and two days}} later attended No. 2 Central Medical Board on 13 August. He was certified fit to fly and flew Supermarine Spitfire on 21 August. He moved to Bournemouth to see his brother Gordon who was now a pilot officer in No. 501 Squadron RAF. At Queen Mary's Hospital he was fitted with a new arm. MacLachlan explained to the doctors that he required an arm {{that would allow him}} to fly a Hurricane. They designed a limb that allowed him to operate the throttle while taking the <b>control</b> <b>column</b> and firing button with his right hand. They spent hours studying the cockpit layout. The medical staff produced an arm with four spring-loaded pins, like fingers, which enabled him to use the controls on the port side of the cockpit. They secured his left arm to the levers of the throttle quadrant: throttle, propeller pitch control, supercharger and mixture control. The landing gear controls were located on the right side. The artificial arm had to interact with the <b>control</b> <b>column</b> while the gear was being retracted or lowered. His new arm proved sufficient and in September 1941 he flew as many hours in Hurricanes as possible, though not without incident. On 7 September 1941 he force-landed in darkness during a searchlight co-operation exercise. On 28 September 1941 he nearly collided with a Bristol Blenheim in low-cloud. Nevertheless, he was cleared for operational flying on 15 October.|$|E
25|$|An {{investigation}} {{found that the}} cause of the accident was that the co-pilot's aileron controls had jammed due to a chain slipping off its sprocket. The difficulty of setting and inspecting the chains in the dual <b>control</b> <b>columns</b> was cited as a contributory factor in the accident.|$|R
40|$|We {{tested the}} {{efficacy}} of matrix-based fertilizers (MBFs) to reduce Escherichia coli and Enterococcus spp., NH₄, NO₃, dissolved reactive phosphorus (DRP), and total phosphorus (TP) in leachate and soil after dairy manure application in greenhouse column studies. The MBFs are composed of inorganic N and P in compounds that are relatively loosely bound (MBF 8) to more tightly bound (MBF 9) mixtures using combinations of starch, cellulose, lignin, Al₂(SO₄) ₃ 18 H₂O, and/or Fe₂(SO₄) ₃ 3 H₂O to create a matrix that slowly releases the nutrients. One day after the first dairy manure application, E. coli numbers were greater in leachate from <b>control</b> <b>columns</b> than in leachate from columns receiving MBFs. After three dairy manure applications, E. coli and Enterococcus spp. numbers in leachates were not consistently different between <b>controls</b> and <b>columns</b> receiving MBFs. When MBF 8 {{was applied to the}} soil, the total amount of DRP, TP, NH 4, and NO₃ in leachate was lower than in the <b>control</b> <b>columns.</b> Bermudagrass receiving MBFs had greater shoot, root, and total biomass than grass growing in the <b>control</b> <b>columns.</b> Grass shoot, root, and total biomass did not differ among columns receiving MBFs. Nitrogen and phosphorus bound to the Al₂(SO₄) ₃ 18 H₂O or Fe₂(SO₄) ₃ 3 H₂O–lignin–cellulose matrix become gradually available to plants over the growing season. The MBF 8 and MBF 9 formulations do not depend on organic or inorganic coatings to reduce N and P leaching and have the potential with further testing and development to provide an effective method to reduce N and P leaching from soils treated with animal waste...|$|R

5|$|At de Havilland he {{was awarded}} a salary of £1,500 in a company that had {{expanded}} enormously during the war. The number of employees rose from 5,000 to 38,000. The turnover of the company had gone from £1.5 million before the war to £25 million and was now supported by around 100 factories. Cunningham now took the title of chief test pilot of the de Havilland Engine Company {{under the supervision of}} Geoffrey de Havilland Jr. Cunningham served as a pilot and consultant in a series of deals with the Swedish Air Force and Swiss Air Force. Both countries were keen to employ him but Cunningham visited only to deliver and advise on the de Havilland Vampire and British airborne radar design. In 1990 the Swiss presented him with the spade-grip from the <b>control</b> <b>column</b> mounted on a wooden stand when they withdrew the last of their Vampires. When the Swedes retired the machine in 1997 he was invited to celebrate its 50 years of Swedish service.|$|E
5|$|The {{control systems}} {{also had some}} innovations. The <b>control</b> <b>column</b> was {{centrally}} placed and the pilot sat {{on the port side}} of the cockpit. The column had an extension arm fitted and had the ability to be swung over to the starboard side in case the pilot was incapacitated. The control instruments were located above the pilot's head in the ceiling, which allowed viewing and did not block the pilot's vision. The fuel instruments were electrical. The He 111 used the inner fuel tanks, closest to the wing root, first. The outer tanks acted as reserve tanks. The pilot was alerted to the fuel level when there was 100L (26US gal) left. A manual pump was available in case of electrical or power failure but the delivery rate of just 4½L (1.2US gal) per minute demanded that the pilot fly at the lowest possible speed and just below 3,048m (10,000ft). The He 111 handled well at low speeds.|$|E

40|$|Dedicated to Mom and Dad, {{for their}} love and support ABSTRACT Trichloroethene (TCE), a {{chlorinated}} ethene with three chlorine atoms, is not thought to occur naturally in the environment at significant concentrations. However, {{it has been found}} in the groundwater and other surface water sites as a result of manufacture, use and disposal of chemicals. Now it {{has become one of the}} most common water contaminants. People have paid much attention to the removal of TCE especially after it has been confirmed as a human carcinogen by the U. S. Department of Health and Human Services. The Maximum Contaminant Level (MCL) for TCE (5 micrograms/L) has been strictly regulated in drinking water by the USEPA. In the past several decades, in order to remove TCE and other chlorinated ethenes from water resources, various removal processes have been developed. Among them, biological and reductive processes are more favorable than abiotic and/or oxidative processes when considering the removal outcome and overall cost. Moreover, using biobarriers shows great potential due to its effectiveness, durability and environmental friendliness. For biological TCE removal, KB- 1 TM culture is a commercialized, reliable culture which can perform complete dechlorination from tetrachloroethene (PCE) to the harmless ethene, and it has both Geobacter and Dehalococcoides (Dhc) dechlorinators. In this research, a column study was done to observe and measure the dechlorinating performance of KB- 1 TM in simulated lab-scale biobarriers. Four mulch columns were set up to act as biobarriers and KB- 1 TM culture was inoculated into the columns to carry out the dechlorination. iii Previous research has shown that the presence oxygen or other alternative electron accepters like nitrate and sulfate could limit the performance of the dechlorinators. In previous work it was shown that mulch biobarriers inoculated with KB- 1 TM could completely dechlorinate 1 mg/L TCE even when influent water was saturated with oxygen. In this research, nitrate and sulfate were pumped into experimental columns to determine the impact on dechlorination ability. <b>Control</b> <b>columns</b> were intended to be identical, but without added nitrate or sulfate in their influents. Gas chromatography (GC) was used to detect methane and dechlorination products at locations along the columns, Polymerase Chain Reactions (PCR) (to detect denitrifiers, dechlorinators and methanogens) and gel electrophoresis were performed on DNA extracted from pore water samples from the columns, and Quantitative-PCR (qPCR) was run to quantify microorganisms of interest (methanogens and KB- 1 TM Dhc) in the columns. According to the GC results and qPCR reports, the KB- 1 TM Dhc populations in the experimental columns were smaller than those in the <b>control</b> <b>columns.</b> Moreover, the methane production rates and dechlorination rates in <b>control</b> <b>columns</b> were also lower than the rates in the <b>control</b> <b>columns.</b> Complete dechlorination to ethene was seen in <b>control</b> <b>columns</b> but with poor material balances. The presence of nitrate and sulfate as low as 0. 25 mM impacted dechlorination rates and end products. Though cis-DCE was seen in experimental columns after nitrate and sulfate were quartered, neither VC nor ethene was observed - suggesting that although the Geobacter population was activated, the Dhc populations were present but inactive. iv 2021 - 05 - 3...|$|R

25|$|The {{design of}} the man-carrying machine known as a Rotachute, {{also known as a}} Hafner H.8, evolved from November 1940 and {{throughout}} 1941. In September 1941, the Central Landing Establishment was renamed the Airborne Forces Establishment. The Rotachute Mark I design initially comprised a tubular steel framework with a single seat, rubber-mounted rotor hub, hanging <b>control</b> <b>column,</b> skid undercarriage, and a self-inflating rear fairing made of rubberised fabric with integral tailplane. The two rotor blades, of wooden construction, could achieve flapping and coning characteristics via hinges on the rotor hub. Fixed footrests were provided, plus fittings below the seat to accommodate a soldier's weapon, such as a Bren gun. The <b>control</b> <b>column</b> offered two-axis control, rolling and pitching, with turns made via controlled rolling movement. Air Ministry Specification No. 11/42 was issued retrospectively to describe the outline requirements. The Ministry of Aircraft Production sub-contracted construction of parts to specialist firms including F. Hills and Sons, Airwork General Trading, Dynaflex, Dunlop, and H. Morris & Co. Some full size rotor trials were carried out using a pivoting rig mounted on a Ford flatbed truck, and full-size unmanned airframes were used in ground-based and inflight trials.|$|E
