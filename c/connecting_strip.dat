50|$|Tom Green County has {{an unusual}} shape, with a long, {{narrow strip of}} land {{extending}} to the west. This feature is because Reagan County to the west used {{to be part of}} Tom Green County, and the state of Texas required that all counties have a contiguous land route to their county seat. Therefore, the small strip of land served to connect the two main regions. In 1903, the residents of the western section voted to form their own county (Reagan County), while in the same vote it was decided that the <b>connecting</b> <b>strip</b> would remain as part of Tom Green County.|$|E
50|$|Dearborn Heights was {{incorporated}} {{from the two}} discontinuous sections of Dearborn Township and a quarter-mile <b>connecting</b> <b>strip</b> of land {{from the village of}} Inkster. Incorporation petitions were filed on Friday, March 4, 1960, while Inkster officials delivered their petitions for incorporation on Monday, March 7, 1960. The residents approved Dearborn Heights incorporation on an election held June 20, 1960, which is the official date of incorporation. Inkster, a predominantly black community, filed a lawsuit, claiming that the shape of Dearborn Heights reflected a racial gerrymander. The Michigan Supreme Court held that Inkster had failed to demonstrate any legally cognizable harm and dismissed the lawsuit.|$|E
5000|$|Just as the Havelland {{forms the}} centre of Old Brandenburg, so the Luch in turn is {{the centre of}} the Havelland. It is about fifty square miles in size; within these fifty square miles the two and twenty square miles of the Luchs are like a nut in a shell. The shape of this nut is not round, however, nor even oval or elliptical, but {{mushroom}}-shaped; like a mushroom with a short, fat stem, wide umbrella-shaped cap and a large cone-shaped root. A longitudinal section through such a mushroom illustrates the shape formed by the Luch. The Luch consists of two halves: an umbrella-shaped, northern half and a cone-shaped, southern half; the two coming near to one another, where the short stalk of the mushroom runs. The umbrella-shaped half is called the Rhinluch, the cone-shaped one, the Havelland Luch (Havelländische Luch). The land between the two that links them has no special name. This relatively narrow <b>connecting</b> <b>strip</b> that corresponds to the stem of the mushroom arose when the sandy plateaux to the left and right of the Luch bottom (Luchgrund) were pushed into the swamps. These sand plateaux bear well known names; the eastern one belongs to the historically renown Ländchen Bellin, the western one is called Ländchen Friesack. These two Ländchen lands" [...] are old seats of culture, and their capitals, Fehrbellin and Friesack, were already named when both swamps still resembled lakes that, during the summer time, dried out into an unhealthy, unsafe swampland.|$|E

Here the complex impedance of such a device (35 KV, 2 nF) with 30 mm wide <b>connecting</b> <b>strips</b> has been measured by means of a vector network-analyser. A first series resonance caused by the unavoidable inductance of such <b>connecting</b> <b>strips</b> was identified between 15 and 20 MHz depending on the width of these strips. Independently a large number of cavity type resonances of the pillbox- like shaped capacitor where found starting at 98 Mhz. At frequencies corresponding to these cavity type resonances the real of the impedance has a very pronounced peak and thus would make the capacitor unusable as a wide-band RF bypass. All measured data are in good agreement with theoretical models forthe two types of resonances observed...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{proposes a}} novel type of {{stiffener}} designed to bear bending loads by exploiting internal pressure effects. The stiffener {{is made of}} two adjacent thin-walled pipes (r/t≥ 50) jointed with a <b>connecting</b> <b>strip.</b> Such a structure is shown to have higher performance against buckling failure compared to a single pipe and its geometry allows for good exploitation of internal pressurisation. The study is conducted by using the FEA software ANSYS and the analysis technique is the linear perturbation buckling analysis. Internal pressure ranges from 0 to 1. 4 MPa. The buckling mechanisms are observed {{for a set of}} models with different values of length, wall thickness and geometric variation of the cross-section. It is shown that two different buckling modes can take place. However, for a given geometry, the level of pressure can alter the behaviour and lead to one mode rather than the other one. Potential of the presented structure is maximised by the use of high performance materials and a possible aerospace engineering application is presented...|$|E

40|$|Grillage {{foundations}} {{consist of}} a series of structurally <b>connected</b> <b>strip</b> footings, often vertical plates or steel beams. They can be a beneficial foundation option for subsea infrastructure. For example, compared with an equivalent solid mudmat foundation, grillages may have reduced material requirements and allow easier handling offshore. Experiments have been undertaken using a six degreeof-freedom loading rig to investigate the capacity of grillage foundations under combined Vertical (V), Horizontal (H) and Moment (M) loading, as experienced in offshore conditions. Tests were performed on loose sand for both a single strip footing and a collection of strips, representing a grillage, over a range of spacings. The paper presents results of vertical and combined loading tests on these footings, which have been interpreted within the framework of V:H:M failure surfaces.

40|$|A new algorithm, Mesh Propagation, is {{presented}} for {{the generation of}} isosurfaces from three-dimensional discrete data sets. While producing the same surface mesh as that generated by a corrected Marching Cubes algorithm, its characteristic is that it constructs an isosurface using <b>connected</b> <b>strips</b> of dynamically triangulated polygons. This compact data structure speeds up surface construction and reduces surface storage requirements. The surface can also be displayed more quickly, particularly where there is hardware support for rendering triangle strips. With engineering as well as medical imaging applications in mind, the algorithm {{can be used with}} both irregular and rectilinear grids of data, the primitive volume elements need not be hexahedral only, and volumes of heterogeneous polyhedral elements are supported without traversal complications. The algorithm propagates through the cells in the grid and uses the same lookup table topologies as Marching Cubes to determine patches of surface-element intersection; additional tables are used for non-hexahedral elements. The surface patches are dynamically coded into triangle strips which are then concatenated and linked to construct the surface. The data structures used for propagating through the volume overcome the topological ambiguities associated with table-based methods of surface construction and no holes are generated in the final mesh...|$|R
