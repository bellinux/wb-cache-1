It is suitable for use in fully implanted cochlearimplant systems of the future which require decades of operation on a 100 -mAh rechargeable battery with a finite number of charge-discharge cycles. It may also be used as an ultra-low-power spectrum-analysis front end in portable speech-recognition systems. The power consumption of the processor includes the 100 W power consumption of a JFET-buffered electret microphone and an associated on-chip microphone front end. An automatic gain control circuit compresses the 77 -dB input dynamic range into a narrower internal dynamic range (IDR) of 57 dB at which each of the 16 spectral channels of the processor operate.

40|$|Objective: The {{primary goal}} {{of the present study}} was to {{determine}} how cochlear implant melody recognition was affected by the frequency range of the melodies, the harmonicity of these melodies, and the number of activated electrodes. The secondary goal was to investigate whether melody recognition and speech recognition were differentially affected by the limitations imposed by cochlear implant processing. Design: Four experiments were conducted. In the first experiment, 11 cochlear implant users used their clinical processors to recognize melodies of complex harmonic tones with their fundamental frequencies being in the low (104 – 262 Hz), middle (207 – 523 Hz), and high (414 – 1046 Hz) ranges. In the second experiment, melody recognition with pure tones was compared to melody recognition with complex harmonic tones in four subjects. In the third experiment, melody recognition was measured as a function of the number of electrodes in five subjects. In the fourth experiment, vowel and consonant recognition were measured as a function of the number of electrodes in the same five subjects who participated in the third experiment. Results: Frequency range significantly affected cochlear implant melody recognition, with higher frequency ranges producing better perfor-mance. Pure tones produced significantly better performance than complex harmonic tones. Increasing the number of activated electrodes did not affect performance with low- and middle-frequency melodies but produced better performance with high-frequency melodies. Large individual variability was observed for melody recognition, but its source seemed to be different from the source of the large variability observed in speech recognition.

40|$|One of the {{important}} research problems {{in the area of}} speech coding is to determine the sound quality of coded speech signals. This quality can best be evaluated by a subjective assessment which is often difficult to administer and time consuming. An objective measure which is consistent with subjective assessment could {{play a vital role in}} the evaluation as well as in the design of a low bit-rate speech coder. In this dissertation, we introduce two distortion measures for speech coder evaluation. Since the perceptual abilities of a human being determine the precision with which speech data must be processed, we consider the details of <b>cochlear</b> (inner <b>ear)</b> and other auditory processing. Using Lyon's auditory model, the time-domain signal is mapped onto a perceptual-domain (PD). Any speech utterance is communicated to the brain through a series of all-or-none electrical spikes (firings) and the PD representation provides information pertaining to the probability-of-firings in the neural channels. Our first measure, namely the cochlear discrimination information (CDI), evaluates the cross-entropy of the neural firings for the coded speech with respect to those for the original one. With this measure, we also compute the rate-distortion function determining the lowest bit-rate required for a specified amount of distortion. In the second measure, namely the cochlear hidden Markovian (CHM) measure, we attempt to capture the high-level processing in the brain with simple hidden Markov models (HMMs). We characterize the firing events by HMMs where the order of occurrence of PD observations and correlations among adjacent observations are modeled suitably. For computing the coder distortion, the PD observations of the coded speech are matched against the HMMs derived from the PD observations of the original speech. Experimental results show that these measures conform to subjective evaluation results in majority of the cases. Finally, the introduced measures are also ap...|$|R
30|$|Treatment {{methods have}} been {{developed}} to overcome deafness, namely hearing aids and cochlear implants. Hearing aids amplify and transform sounds so they may be detected by damaged <b>ears.</b> <b>Cochlear</b> implants are {{considered one of the most}} important technological advances in the rehabilitation of deafness (Eisenberg et al. 2006). They are surgically implanted electronic devices that enable individuals with severe to profound hearing loss to regain or access some hearing. It bypasses damaged portions of the inner ear and stimulates the auditory nerve, allowing the perception of sound and helping deaf people understand speech, though hearing through a cochlear implant is different from normal hearing and it takes time to learn/relearn. Nevertheless, a great variability remains between subject outcomes, as some cochlear implant recipients may obtain only a greater awareness of environmental sounds and others may achieve speech recognition, telephone use and can integrate easily into the hearing world (Zaidman-Zait 2010). Several factors may influence the final outcome of the implant, such as the aetiology of deafness, the age at which deafness is identified, age at the time of the implant, the presence of residual hearing, the process of the auditory rehabilitation and family participation in the therapeutic process (Duarte et al. 2014; Zaidman-Zait 2010).|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe paired box {{transcription}} factor, Pax 2, {{is important}} for cochlear development in the mouse inner ear. Two mutant alleles of Pax 2, a knockout and a frameshift mutation (Pax 21 Neu), show either agenesis or severe malformation of the cochlea, respectively. In humans, mutations in the PAX 2 gene cause renal coloboma syndrome that is characterized by kidney abnormalities, optic nerve colobomas and mild sensorineural deafness. To better understand the role of Pax 2 in inner ear development, we examined the inner ear phenotype in the Pax 2 knockout mice using paint-fill and gene expression analyses. We show that Pax 2 −/− ears often lack a distinct saccule, and the endolymphatic duct and common crus are invariably fused. However, a rudimentary cochlea is always present in all Pax 2 knockout inner <b>ears.</b> <b>Cochlear</b> outgrowth in the mutants is arrested {{at an early stage}} due to apoptosis of cells that normally express Pax 2 in the cochlear anlage. Lack of Pax 2 affects tissue specification within the cochlear duct, particularly regions between the sensory tissue and the stria vascularis. Because the cochlear phenotypes observed in Pax 2 mutants are more severe than those observed in mice lacking Otx 1 and Otx 2, we postulate that Pax 2 {{plays a key role in}} regulating the differential growth within the cochlear duct and thus, its proper outgrowth and coiling...|$|R
40|$|The latency of {{transient}} evoked otoacoustic emissions {{has been}} evaluated {{in a sample}} of 58 ears from 34 preterm neonates, to understand if the estimates of cochlear tuning based on the otoacoustic emission latency show signs of developmental changes. A previous study on the same otoacoustic emissions analyzed here [Tognola et al. (2005). "Cochlear maturation and otoacoustic emissions in preterm infants: A time-frequency approach,"Hear. Res., 199, 71 - 80] reported indeed a significant change in the otoacoustic emission latency with postconception age. This last result, which would imply a significant decrease of tuning, was partially biased by the presence of spontaneous emissions. In this study, the same neonate data are reanalyzed using a novel time-frequency algorithm, less sensitive to spontaneous emissions. Asymmetry between right and left ears has been found, with the left ears showing no significant change, whereas in the right ears and in the 1. 5 - 2. 5 kHz frequency range only, a slow decrease of latency with postconception age (0. 1 - 0. 2 ms/week) was observed.

40|$|Neurotrophins (NTs) {{and their}} signal transducing Trk receptors play a {{critical}} role in the development and maintenance of specific neuronal populations in the nervous system of higher vertebrates. They are responsible for the innervation of the inner <b>ear</b> <b>cochlear</b> and vestibular sensory epithelia. Neurotrophins and Trks are also present in teleosts but their distribution in the inner ear is unknown. Thus, in the present study, we used Western-blot analysis and immunohistochemistry to investigate the expression and cell localization of both NTs and Trk receptors in the inner ear of alevins of Salmo salar and Salmo trutta. Western-blot analysis revealed the occurrence of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and neurotrophin- 3 (NT- 3), but not nerve growth factor (NGF), as well as all three Trk receptors, i. e. TrkA, TrkB and TrkC, the estimated molecular weights of which were similar to those expected for mammals. Specific immunoreactivity for neurotrophins was detected mainly in the sensory epithelia. In particular, BDNF immunoreactivity was found in the maculae of the utricle and saccule, whereas NT- 3 immunoreactivity was present in the sensory epithelium of the cristae ampullaris. As a rule the sensory epithelia of the inner ear lacked immunoreactivity for Trks, thus excluding possible mechanisms of autocrinia and/or paracrinia.

The latter can be sub-divided into active implants in the external ear or middle <b>ear,</b> <b>cochlear</b> implants, and auditory brainstem implants (ABI). Indications for each group are determined by the type and location of the underlying condition as well as by the anatomic, functional, and social characteristics of each patient. It must be stressed that the selection and monitoring of the treatment is up to the specialist. Generally speaking, an attempt is made to facilitate the integration of the hypoacusic patients to their sound setting by enhancing their understanding of the spoken word and restoring binaurality, while at the same time, seeking to retain the plasticity of central auditory routes through the stimulation provided by any of these systems. In the course of this review, we refer to newly-emerging indications in both the field of cochlear implants (bimodal stimulation, implantation in patients with residual hearing, bilateral implants, etc) and in the area of ABI in patients with tumoural disease previously treated with radiosurgery or patients with non-tumour pathologies presenting malformations or bilateral cochlear ossification...|$|R
40|$|Introduction and objective: The A 1555 G {{mitochondrial}} DNA mutation of the MTRNR 1 gene {{is responsible}} for sensorineural hearing loss that is accentuated with exposure to aminoglycosides. Otosclerosis is common in our environment. Some patients with otosclerosis have severe impairment of the inner ear. We report a family that had association of otosclerosis and the A 1555 G mutation that initially were confused {{with the presence of}} a cochlear otosclerosis. Method:Ten members of a family with hearing loss, in several of them triggered by aminoglycosides exposition, were included in our study. A clinical and genetic study to rule out the most common mutations involve in hearing loss in Spanish population was carried out. Results: All of them were carriers of the A 1555 G mutation in homoplasmy. Three had normal audiometry test. Of the remainder, 4 had sensorineural hearing loss for high frequencies and the other 3 had mixed hearing loss that suggesed the presence of otosclerosis. A CT scan of the temporal bone was normal in those three patients. Two patients were treated with a cochlear implant. Discussion: CT is a help to get the difference between <b>cochlear</b> otosclerosis, middle <b>ear</b> otosclerosis and A 1555 G mutation, and that is very important because people who have this mutation is susceptible to aminoglycoside ototoxicity and besides if they have a severe deafness, the treatment could be a cochlear implant if there are not anatomical abnormalities. Conclusions: In patients with suspected cochlear otosclerosis and maternally history of hearing loss, with a normal CT scan of the temporal bone, the presence of the A 1555 G mitochondrial DNA mutation should be rudes out...|$|R
