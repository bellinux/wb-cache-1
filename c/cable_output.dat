50|$|Silicon vendors have {{developed}} complex Integrated Circuits that greatly {{reduce the cost}} of implementing the single cable distribution function. A Channel Stacking Switch IC is a multiple-input multiple-output device. It typically has N 1.2 GHz inputs that can be cascaded to additional chips as required (to expand output capacity). These inputs are fed into a large N-pole M-Throw switch that outputs to M mixers. Each mixer path then translates only the user requested transponder to a predetermined fixed frequency within the 950-2150 MHz band. This fixed frequency is unique for each tuner on the single <b>cable</b> <b>output.</b> Each tuner in the STB always stays at this fixed frequency while the CSS IC translates the user requested content down the cable to this exact frequency. This architecture requires no hardware change to the STB design. Communications protocol between the CSS IC and the STB is handled via the CENELEC EN50494 standard or proprietary systems.|$|E
40|$|We {{evaluated}} {{the potential of}} a fiber optic cable connected to distributed temperature sensing (DTS) technology to withstand wildland fire conditions and quantify fire behavior parameters. We used a custom-made ‘fire cable’ consisting of three optical fibers coated with three different materials—acrylate, copper and polyimide. The 150 -m cable was deployed in grasslands and burned in three prescribed fires. The DTS system recorded fire <b>cable</b> <b>output</b> every three seconds and integrated temperatures every 50. 6 cm. Results indicated the fire cable was physically capable of withstanding repeated rugged use. Fiber coating materials withstood temperatures up to 422 °C. Changes in fiber attenuation following fire were near zero (− 0. 81 to 0. 12 dB/km) indicating essentially no change in light gain or loss {{as a function of}} distance or fire intensity over the length of the fire cable. Results indicated fire cable and DTS technology have potential to quantify fire environment parameters such as heat duration and rate of spread but additional experimentation and analysis are required to determine efficacy and response times.

INTRODUCTION There are several issues of concern for the button-type BPMs in the PEP-II [1] vacuum chamber. First, the presence of BPMs in the vacuum chamber contributes significant impedances, broad-band and narrow-band. For broad-band impedance, the contribution of all the BPMs to the total impedance budget can be readily calculated. Narrow-band impedances arise from the [...] ...|$|R
50|$|As <b>cables</b> between line <b>output</b> {{and line}} input are {{generally}} extremely short {{compared to the}} audio signal wavelength in the cable, transmission line effects can be disregarded and impedance matching need not be used. Instead, line level circuits use the impedance bridging principle, in which a low impedance output drives a high impedance input. A typical line out connection has an output impedance from 100 to 600 Ω, with lower values being more common in newer equipment. Line inputs present a much higher impedance, typically 10 kΩ or more.|$|R

40|$|The vacuum-assisted, constant-force {{exercise}} device (VAC-FED) {{has been proposed}} to fill {{a need for a}} safe, reliable exercise machine that would provide constant loads that could range from 20 to 250 lb (0. 09 to 1. 12 kN) with strokes that could range from 6 to 36 in. (0. 15 to 0. 91 m). The VAC-FED was originally intended to enable astronauts in microgravity to simulate the lifting of free weights, but it could just as well be used on Earth for simulated weight lifting and other constant-force exercises. Because the VAC-FED would utilize atmospheric/vacuum differential pressure instead of weights to generate force, it could weigh considerably less than either a set of free weights or a typical conventional exercise machine based on weights. Also, the use of atmospheric/ vacuum differential pressure to generate force would render the VAC-FED inherently safer, relative to free weights and to conventional exercise machines that utilize springs to generate forces. The overall function of the VAC-FED would be to generate a constant tensile force in an <b>output</b> <b>cable,</b> which would be attached to a bar, handle, or other exercise interface. The primary force generator in the VAC-FED would be a piston in a cylinder. The piston would separate a volume vented to atmosphere {{at one end of the}} cylinder from an evacuated volume at the other end of the cylinder (see figure). Hence, neglecting friction at the piston seals, the force generated would be nearly constant equal to the area of the piston multiplied by the atmospheric/vacuum differential pressure. In the vented volume in the cylinder, a direct-force cable would be looped around a pulley on the piston, doubling the stroke and halving the tension. One end of the direct-force cable would be anchored to a cylinder cap; the other end of the direct-force cable would be wrapped around a variable-ratio pulley that would couple tension to the <b>output</b> <b>cable.</b> As its name suggests, the variable-ratio pulley would contain a mechanism that could be used to vary the ratio between the tension in the direct-force cable and the tension in the <b>output</b> <b>cable.</b> This mechanism could contain gears, pulleys, and/or levers, for example...|$|R
