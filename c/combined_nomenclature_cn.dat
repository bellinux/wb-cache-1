30|$|To {{calculate}} {{the concentration of}} Spanish exports, we have used the export transactions database, which is elaborated by the Customs and Excise Department of the Spanish Tax Agency. For each transaction, we know the firm’s identification code, the product according to the 8 -digit <b>Combined</b> <b>Nomenclature</b> (<b>CN)</b> classification 2, the destination of the export transaction, the free-on-board (FOB) value in euros of the transaction, and the exported quantity (in weight metric and/or units). 3 Every year, new CN 8 codes {{are added to the}} classification and some CN codes are dropped. Since some sections of the paper compare data for different years, we use the Van Beveren et al. (2012) algorithm to create a consistent product classification over the period of analysis. 4 Using this database, we first analyze, how export concentration varies by the number of top firms. Second, we study whether concentration also occurs in export flows, where a flow is defined as a particular 8 -digit product shipped to a particular destination. Finally, we analyze how sensitive concentration is to different product classifications.|$|E
40|$|The paper {{examines}} the EU government’s {{choice of a}} proper policy instrument given the cost structure of the foreign firms that are present at the EU market. The empirical model {{which is based on}} a 2 -digit <b>Combined</b> <b>Nomenclature</b> (<b>CN)</b> level sector data and information on the EU anti-dumping (AD) and production subsidy investigations from 1985 - 1995 supports the theoretical findings that the EU maximizes its social welfare if it imposes definitive AD measures on the foreign firm which enjoy location-specific and thus nontransferable cost advantage, and subsidizes domestic production if the foreign firm with transferable cost advantage can avoid AD duties by undertaking FDI. The overview of AD and production subsidy cases in the EU shows important changes in targeting sectors and countries in the observed period. Most of the AD cases that ended in imposition of definitive duties or negotiating price undertakings affected low-wage developing East-Asian countries and non-market economies. On a sectoral level, chemical products followed by capital-intensive sectors accounted for more than 70 percent of all affirmative cases. So called strategically important sectors that were highly privileged in the early 1980 s switched to an alternative form of protection: production subsidies. ...|$|E

40|$|Illegal Logging {{is one of}} {{the major}} global causes for {{deforestation}} and the degradation of forests. The further manufacturing of illegally logged wood and products made thereof as well as the associated trade has also negative social and economic effects on both sides of the wood markets, the producer and consumer countries. One of the key measures of the European Union (EU) to combat illegal logging is the EU Timber Regulation (EUTR). The EUTR came into effect on March 1, 2013 and it prohibits the placing of wood and wood products made of illegally logged wood on the EU internal market. This placement can either be done by selling removals from European forests or by importing wood and wood-based products into the EU. But for what kind of products does the regulation apply exactly? The EUTR refers to its An-nex where a list is provided with respective commodities. The products are structured ac-cording to the trade classification of the <b>Combined</b> <b>Nomenclature</b> (<b>CN).</b> The main focus is laid on wood and articles of wood (chapter 44 of the CN), on pulp of wood (chapter 47) and on paper and paperboard and articles made thereof (chapter 48).

40|$|The excel tool was {{developed}} as an {{implementation of a}} commodity-based hazard identification protocol for biological hazards in plants and animals {{in the form of}} a decision support tree. The content of the decision tree is based on the results of a systematic review of pest and pathogen characteristics, a review of risk assessment schemes and on expert judgement. Application of the protocol results in an indication of the level of likelihood of entry of animal and plant pathogens/pests in the area of destination associated with the commodity/pathway, and it guides the decision regarding potential actions to be undertaken in the search for existing and emerging pathogens/pests. The excel tools contains three worksheets representing three levels. Level 0 concerns whether the commodity itself can turn into a pest, whether it can contain pests and pathogens, and whether it contains additional material that can be contaminated. The likelihood that a commodity contains pests and pathogens depends on the likelihood of pest association and survival before the commodity is transported to the country of destination, and the likelihood that the pest/pathogen will come into contact with local hosts in that country. In level 1, the likelihood of pest association and survival is elaborated and assessed for each pest/pathogen category, whereas in level 2 the likelihood that a biological hazard comes into contact with local host is assessed in greater detail. The tool includes an extension with a [commodity list derived from <b>Combined</b> <b>Nomenclature</b> (<b>CN)</b> classification with relevant characteristics, and a pathway model which enables the risk assessor to provide and structure the relevant information.

40|$|Dual-use {{items are}} goods and {{technologies}} that have both civil and military uses. In the European Union their export is controlled and governed by an EC regulation since the year 2000. Its implementation, {{in terms of}} legislation, export authorisations and customs controls, remains the responsibility {{of each of the}} 27 Member States. For reasons linked to the non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, competition in trade and free market rules, it is ‘desirable to achieve a uniform and consistent application of controls throughout the EU in order to promote EU and international security and to provide a level playing field for EU exporters’ – as stated in the regulation. How far is the goal? Hard to say since no official data about the trade of dual-use items are shared among Member States, nor with the European Commission, Directorate General Trade, in charge of the dual-use regulation. This report presents sources of generic, statistical trade data and a methodology to create an approximate picture of extra-EU trade flows of dual-use items. The data stem from goods’ declarations made by exporters to customs authorities as part of the normal export process for any commodity. The data are collected at national level, aggregated by categories of goods, and made public in web data services on trade. The data are referred to a commodity classification system, the <b>Combined</b> <b>Nomenclature</b> (<b>CN),</b> in use for customs controls in the EU. However the CN is only indirectly related to dual-use items. Correspondence tables exist that map dual-use items to CN descriptors, but they introduce approximations in the description of the items traded. For this reason the CN trade data provide, in the general case, upper bounds to the real trade volume of dual-use items. Notwithstanding this limitation, the CN trade data may prove useful for a number of issues and assessments needed for export controls. One example is presented in this report. It concerns the estimation of extra-EU trade flows for dual-use chemicals under consideration for inclusion in a Union General Export Authorisation (EU GEA). EU GEAs define a framework valid in all EU Members States whereby the export of selected categories of dual-use items to specific destination countries with a low-risk of diversion is automatically authorised. An analysis of the volume of exports based on CN trade data allows estimating the impact expected for EU exporters by including given dual-use chemicals in an EU GEA. To facilitate the estimation of extra-EU trade flows, it is proposed to develop a dedicated Information Technology tool merging lists of export-controlled items with correspondence tables of CN items’ descriptors and export data. Such a tool can become a design and evaluation instrument to assess the economic impact of alternative policy options to regulate the European dual-use trade. JRC. E. 8 -Nuclear securit...|$|E

This is the point where former, current and future specialized engines of potential trade growth can be established.
