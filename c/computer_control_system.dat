25|$|On 1 April 1974, the Rivers Department and the Rivers Committee {{ceased to}} exist, when {{responsibility}} for the works passed from Manchester City Council to the newly formed North West Water Authority. The Authority built a new control room in 1981, which housed a <b>computer</b> <b>control</b> <b>system</b> for the site. Three years later, eight new sludge digesters were built, to enable all sludge dumped at sea to be digested first. Construction of the Mersey Valley Regional Sludge Pipeline began, linking Oldham to Davyhulme, and continuing to Sandon Dock in Liverpool. Davyhulme was able to treat sludge {{from a number of}} other sewage works to the east, and pump the digested product to Liverpool. Sludge boats ceased to use the ship canal, taking 15 minutes to transport sludge from Liverpool to a point {{to the north of the}} Bar Light in the Mersey, instead of over six hours required when using the canal.|$|E
500|$|The {{third phase}} saw the biggest changes; a new, more {{accurate}} bowl surface {{was constructed in}} front of the old surface, meaning that the telescope could be used on wavelengths as small as 6cm, and the central [...] "bicycle wheel" [...] support was added. A new <b>computer</b> <b>control</b> <b>system</b> was also installed (reusing the Ferranti Argus 104 computer from the Mark II); fatigue cracks in the cones connecting the bowl to the towers were repaired, and the central antenna was lengthened and strengthened. Tragically, in January 1972 the hoist carrying two engineers to the central antenna broke, gravely injuring two engineers and causing the death of one of them.|$|E
500|$|The {{caissons}} or gondolas {{always carry}} a combined weight of [...] {{of water and}} boats, with the gondolas themselves each weighing [...] Care is taken to maintain the water levels on each side, thus balancing the weight on each arm. According to Archimedes' principle, floating objects displace their own weight in water, so when the boat enters, {{the amount of water}} leaving the caisson weighs exactly the same as the boat. This is achieved by maintaining the water levels on each side to within a difference of [...] using a site-wide <b>computer</b> <b>control</b> <b>system</b> comprising water level sensors, automated sluices and pumps. It takes [...] to power ten hydraulic motors, which consume [...] per half-turn, roughly the same as boiling eight kettles of water.|$|E

2500|$|Gaia is able {{to channel}} the kinetic energy of its matter, a {{phenomenon}} Asimov calls transduction.

[...] It may also be capable of obliterating large sections of matter, though this ability is never discussed by Gaia; the Solarians (much more powerful transducers) were capable of destroying objects at least as large as space vessels.|$|E
2500|$|... 1982 saw {{the debut}} of the “Cross-Fire Injection” fuel {{delivery}} system. This TBI (Throttle Body Fuel Injection) was {{not the type of}} fuel injection installed previously in some C1 and C2 Corvettes. It utilized two throttle bodies combined with Chevrolet’s <b>computer</b> <b>control</b> <b>system.</b> The engine produced [...] and was mated to a new four-speed automatic transmission with torque converters bypass in the top three gears. Compared to the previous Turbo-Hydramatic 3-speed, the new 700-R4 transmission had a lower first and second gear for improved low-end acceleration, and a fourth gear overdrive that would reduce engine RPM by 30 percent at highway cruising speeds, resulting in better fuel economy. On the downside, the new transmission was not considered a strong unit and proved problematic. The final model C3 Corvette's published performance numbers were 0-60 in 7.9seconds-the quarter-mile in 16.1 @ [...] This was the last year for 8-track tape availability and new “cross-fire injection” emblems appeared on front fenders. Nose and fuel door crossed-flags emblems changed to a more squared design.|$|E
2500|$|In 1981, {{there was}} only one {{powerplant}} available, a [...] engine that, like the L-48 base engine the previous year, produced the , but was now designated the L81. The motor was certified in all states and available with manual or automatic transmissions. Chrome air cleaner lids and cast magnesium valve covers dressed up all engines. The stainless steel exhaust manifolds and <b>computer</b> <b>control</b> <b>system</b> introduced on the [...] California engines the previous year were now standard, as was an auxiliary electric engine cooling fan. This, the last C3 available with a manual transmission, so equipped, had a published 0-60mph in 8.1seconds. This model year was the first corvette to use a fiberglass rear leaf spring, now a Corvette trademark. The spring saved thirty-six pounds, but was limited to base suspensions with automatic transmission. When equipped with Delco's brand new optional ETR (Electronically Tuned Receiver) radio with a digital clock, the quartz analog instrument panel clock was replaced with an oil temperature gauge. The cast aluminum wheels, optional since ’76, were now ordered on 90 percent of the cars at a cost of $428. New options included a power adjustable driver’s seat and power remote outside mirrors. In mid-1981 production shifted from St. Louis, Missouri to Bowling Green, Kentucky, and several two-tone paint options were offered.|$|E
