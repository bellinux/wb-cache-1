5|$|The {{system worked}} as follows. The animal's sense organ is altered when it detects an object. This causes a perceptual <b>change</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> animal's seat of sensation, which Aristotle {{believed}} was the heart, not {{as we now}} think the brain. This in turn causes a <b>change</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> heart's heat, which causes a quantitative change sufficient to make the heart transmit a mechanical impulse to a limb, which moves, moving the animal's body. The alteration {{in the heat of}} the heart also causes a <b>change</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> consistency of the joints, which helps the limb to move.|$|E
