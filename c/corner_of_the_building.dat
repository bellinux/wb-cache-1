5|$|The {{outer walls}} of the church are {{constructed}} of red sandstone with grey ashlar dressings; the roofs are slate. The church plan consists of a nave, with a square tower {{to the west and}} a chancel and apsidal sanctuary to the east. There is a clergy vestry at the south-east <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>building.</b>|$|E
5|$|Another tragedy {{occurred}} {{on the morning of}} 16 May 1968 when Ronan Point, a 23-storey tower block in Newham, suffered a structural collapse due to a natural gas explosion. Four people were killed in the disaster and seventeen were injured, as an entire <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>building</b> slid away. The collapse caused major changes in UK building regulations and led to the decline of further building of high rise council flats that had characterised 1960s public architecture.|$|E
5|$|Additionally, {{city hall}} was {{partially}} destroyed. Along the northwest <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>building,</b> the exterior wall in its entirely collapsed, while {{the north tower}} was destroyed. The bay at the northeastern {{side of the building}} was removed. Additionally, the roof suffered complete destruction. As a result, Lake Worth was without a functional center for city government. A temporary city hall was established at the Lauriston building. Damage in Lake Worth reached approximately $4million. Three deaths occurred in Lake Worth, two from illnesses related to exposure to the storm; the other was a man who suffered from apoplexy, blamed on excessive exertion {{in the aftermath of the}} hurricane.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} {{there were}} servants quarters and spaces {{on the ground}} floor, and a library in the north room on the second floor, {{as well as a}} sitting room over the octagonal drawing room. According to Repton, the design should allow ground floor rooms where the garden is visible and directly accessible, meaning that servants quarters needed to be placed in their own wing, but without prominence so as to maintain the hierarchy. In the south-east <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>building</b> there was a gothic loggia which was glazed in the 19th century to create a conservatory, some time after the conservatory in the American Garden was removed.|$|E
5|$|In the 1920s, the old Butler Wright house {{became the}} golf house. It {{was at the}} center of the club's {{sporting}} operations, originally holding a pro shop, dining room, bar, and bedrooms. In 1931, it was refurbished with more showers and dressing rooms, an addition to the locker room to double its space and increase the lounge space, an enlarged kitchen, a new women's locker room and sitting room, a larger dining veranda, an enclosed porch on the northwest <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>building,</b> and a new porch on the building's east side. The club's first pool was constructed adjoining the house in 1930, necessitating the construction of the showers and dressing rooms. The building was demolished in 1967.|$|E
5|$|The cornerstone, {{located at}} the {{northeast}} <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>building,</b> bears the dates 1872, the start of construction, and 1878, the year of completion. The stone was opened during ceremonies November 15, 1978, the centennial of the building's completion. Various documents enclosed within the stone had been damaged by moisture, although several coins from the era remained intact. Officials closed and resealed with stone with 38 new items depicting Michigan's history, people, and lifestyles. At the lawn's southeast corner is the Grand Army of the Republic Memorial, a 1924-bronze plaque attached to a boulder as a memorial to American Civil War veterans who fought for the Union.|$|E

5|$|Aside {{from the}} transit room {{conversion}} to office space {{the building has}} seen other major work in the past. The southwest <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>building</b> was built in 1956, of cream colored brick, to house additional classrooms and office space. The addition of 1956 took special care to replicate nearly {{every aspect of the}} original building except for color. Another major addition occurred in 1966 with the construction of the large east wing. Of the same cream colored brick as the 1956 addition, it also tried to mimic the building's finer details. The 1966 east wing addition provided for, again, more office space, but this project also included space for a new darkroom and a radio telescope laboratory. The observatory basement and the dome housing the refractor are still in use by the astronomy department at U of I and the University of Illinois Astronomical Society, a student organization on campus.|$|E
5|$|By the 1330s, Southampton's {{prosperity}} {{was in a}} slow decline. In 1338 {{there was}} a successful French attack on the town, during which various buildings were burned and castle was damaged. The house {{may have been one}} of those damaged in the raid, as the south-western <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>building</b> collapsed around that time and had to be quickly rebuilt; other alterations, including the addition of a fireplace, may have been carried out at the same time. Southampton's economy collapsed {{in the aftermath of the}} attacks and never fully recovered. The character of FrenchStreet began to change, as many houses were sub-divided or redeveloped to fit in more buildings. The Medieval Merchant's House ceased to be used by major merchants and by 1392 appears to have been rented out to tenants by Thomas Fryke and John Barflet, the latter a descendent of John Fortin, for whom the house was originally built.|$|E
5|$|In 2002 the University of Leicester Archaeological Services {{decided to}} {{excavate}} the presumed {{location of the}} abbey's kitchens, to clarify the layout of that area of the abbey. These first excavations located both {{the north and south}} walls and a 15th–16th-century brick oven, confirming that it was indeed the kitchens. The area excavated was enlarged in 2003, with the south-west <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>building</b> and a second oven uncovered: this corner had not been entirely robbed of stone, with two courses of sandstone remaining. The second oven was found to contain charcoal, fragments of wheat and barley, fish-bones and hazelnuts. A drain identified in the 1930s excavation was also located, and found to contain small bones, fish-scales, and the bones of rats who had formerly lived in the drain.|$|E
25|$|The dome, in the middle, {{reflects}} both Indian and British styles. In {{the centre}} {{is a tall}} copper dome, surmounting a drum, which stands out from <b>the</b> rest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>building.</b> <b>The</b> dome is exactly in <b>the</b> middle <b>of</b> <b>the</b> diagonals between <b>the</b> four <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>building.</b> <b>The</b> dome {{is more than twice}} <b>the</b> height <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>building</b> itself.|$|R

5000|$|<b>The</b> monumental Neromantical <b>building</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> District Court {{dates from}} <b>the</b> {{beginning}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 20th century. Construction works started in 1906 and were finished in 1908. It has a dominant long facade {{along with the}} Begej river bank, cupolas at <b>the</b> <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>building.</b> <b>The</b> central risalit {{at the same time}} represents the most thoroughly modelled part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>building.</b>|$|R
5|$|At the {{southwest}} corner of the same intersection, the building housing Sidetrack Bar & Grillwhich has held a bar and restaurant continuously since at least 1850has an unusual shape resulting from a 1929 train derailment. On an early January morning, the twelfth car, laden with lumber, of an 85-car freight train came off the tracks and crashed into the <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>building.</b> The owner of the building, who lived just above the section that was hit, was uninjured but had most of her personal effects scattered into the street. There were only a few people near the railroad crossing when it derailed including an 18-year-old female who was knocked unconscious and a man who was sitting in his car, but was able to get away unharmed. When the current owners went to build a patio on the spot, they found some of the debris had been piled up underneath, which made it more difficult to dig post holes. In 1931, the entrance to the building was moved from the east side to its current position on the north side to accommodate a post-prohibition law requiring bar entrances to be at least 500 feet from any church. The back patio was constructed after the nearby church burned down. According to Sidetrack owner Linda French, the first-floor walls are three bricks deep, with the oldest remaining bricks dating to the 1850s.|$|E
25|$|During World War II, Nikita Khrushchev, {{concerned}} {{about the condition of}} the city, visited Odessa immediately after it was liberated. Khrushchev reported that only one <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>building</b> had been damaged by an enemy shell.|$|E
25|$|Another {{dominant}} {{building in}} the town is the historic Saint Eunan's College. Saint Eunan's is a three-storey castelated structure with four round towers at each <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>building.</b> It was constructed in the Edwardian version of the neo-Hiberno-Romanesque style.|$|E
50|$|The flats at <b>the</b> rear <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>building</b> {{offered an}} unusual {{scenario}} where the maid, {{working at the}} sink, looked out at Battersea Park and had one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> best views in the whole flat.|$|R

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>building</b> is {{decorated}} by sculptures and reliefs by Stanislav Sucharda, Josef Mařatka and Ladislav Šaloun. Saloun's sculptures are on <b>the</b> <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>building,</b> he is <b>the</b> same local sculptor {{who created the}} city's iconic Jan Hus Memorial.|$|R
25|$|Plans for the {{memorial}} include steel panels that wrap around the building, {{as well as}} upper and lower panels that will list {{the names of the}} victims and {{tell the story of the}} fire. A reflective steel beam will extend from the <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>building</b> to the eighth floor, the place of origin for the fire.|$|E
25|$|The History Building, {{once the}} Museum of Natural History, was {{designed}} for the Texas Centennial Exposition as a monolithic, rectangular box. The entrance features three vertical window bays with decorative aluminum mullions. Flanking it are paired pilasters with shell-motif capitals. The rest of the building is clad in limestone. In 1988, the northeast <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>building</b> was excavated, creating a series of landscaped terraces.|$|E
25|$|Bramante {{had envisioned}} {{that the central}} dome would be {{surrounded}} by four lower domes at the diagonal axes. The equal chancel, nave and transept arms were each to be of two bays ending in an apse. At each <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>building</b> was to stand a tower, so that the overall plan was square, with the apses projecting at the cardinal points. Each apse had two large radial buttresses, which squared off its semi-circular shape.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>building</b> {{contains}} a five-star hotel which occupies floors 49-70, with 603 rooms in total. The lower 48 floors contain shops, restaurants, clinics, and offices. <b>The</b> <b>building</b> contains two tuned mass dampers on the (hidden) 71st floor on opposite <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>building.</b>|$|R
50|$|With <b>the</b> opening-up <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Rua Nova da Alfândega around 1871, the {{fountain}} began to exist under <b>the</b> level <b>of</b> <b>the</b> road, and almost {{lost in a}} <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>buildings.</b> This was done to facilitate <b>the</b> access to <b>building</b> and new customhouse in Porto.|$|R
50|$|Two {{staircases}} in <b>the</b> north <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>building</b> {{reach to}} <b>the</b> third floor where a viewing gallery or balcony {{looked over the}} second floor courtroom. This gallery and the original courtroom ceiling have been obscured by a new drop ceiling making air conditioning possible.|$|R
25|$|The west facade {{consisted}} of a glass curtain wall which sloped slightly inward. The facade projected outward (imitating bays and turrets) at points, and at points it featured a gabled roof. On the south <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>building,</b> a circular street plaza sliced into the sidewalk in the west (providing a few parking spaces) while cutting an arc into {{the facade of the}} building. This helped create a transition from the flat southern facade to the more diverse western facade.|$|E
25|$|The RNA Council Stand {{is located}} {{to the south}} of Show Ring No.1, {{adjacent}} to the Ernest Baynes Stand, overlooking the show ring. It is a three-storey brick building with a double hipped roof. There is also a small, hip-roofed tower at the southeast <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>building.</b> At some early period the northern end of the building has been extended to incorporate an entrance to the seating in front of the stand. There is a later two-storey extension on the southern side. The three earlier facades retain their face brickwork with decorative rendered bands.|$|E
25|$|Diwan-i-Khas: the Diwan-i-Khas or Hall of Private Audience, is a plain square {{building}} with four chhatris on the roof. However it {{is famous for}} its central pillar, which has a square base and an octagonal shaft, both carved with bands of geometric and floral designs, further its thirty-six serpentine brackets support a circular platform for Akbar, which is connected to each <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>building</b> on the first floor, by four stone walkways. It is here that Akbar had representatives of different religions discuss their faiths and gave private audience.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> {{cross-section}} <b>of</b> a {{gambrel roof}} {{is similar to}} that of a mansard roof, but a gambrel has vertical gable ends instead of being hipped at <b>the</b> four <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>building.</b> A gambrel roof overhangs the façade, whereas a mansard normally does not.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> three-storey <b>building</b> {{is divided}} into five bays, with the central bay brought {{slightly}} forward.
