40|$|The {{operation}} of a reciprocating compressor is {{closely linked to the}} performance of its valves, in terms of both life and efficiency. To better understand the factors that affect reciprocating compressor valve performance and life, a Gas Machinery Research Council (GMRC) program has been initiated to systematically investigate the physical behavior of valve plates during compressor operation. A reciprocating compressor’s valve plate life is generally considered to be a function of the plate’s cyclic kinematics, transient stresses, and material properties. Thus, the valve research program aims to incorporate these fundamental factors into an analysis model that accurately predicts valve life for a given application, geometry, and plate material. The research will benefit users within the gas industry by providing a basis for improvements in applications engineering and operational decision-making related to reciprocating <b>compressor</b> <b>valves.</b> The analysis model developed by the research program is based on results from plate single impact tests, finite element (FE) calculations, optical valve plate 3 -D motion measurements, and material high cycle fatigue testing.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} three {{methods for}} estimating Weibull distribution parameters {{for the case}} of irregular interval group failure data with unknown failure times. The methods {{are based on the}} concepts of the piecewise linear distribution function (PLDF), an average interval failure rate (AIFR) and sequential updating of the distribution function (SUDF), and use an analytical approach similar to that of Ackoff and Sasieni for regular interval group data. Results from a large number of simulated case problems generated with specified values of Weibull distribution parameters have been presented, which clearly indicate that the SUDF method produces near-perfect parameter estimates for all types of failure pattern. The performances of the PLDF and AIFR methods have been evaluated by goodness-of-fit testing and statistical confidence limits on the shape parameter. It has been found that, while the PLDF method produces acceptable parameter estimates, the AIFR method may fail for low and high shape parameter values that represent the cases of random and wear-out types of failure.

40|$|The {{stack up}} of losses within a system gives an {{indication}} of its efficiency. In a refrigerator <b>compressor,</b> <b>valves</b> contribute to thermodynamic losses (pressure and cooling capacity) due to valve dynamics and mistiming. This paper proposes an improvement to an existing analytic closed form solution for efficiency estimation of such compressors by incorporating more detailed valve physics/ dynamics. For maximum energy efficiency ratio (EER), it is beneficial in certain variable capacity compressor architectures to drive the piston at a resonant frequency. In an oscillating system, this is typically determined by the mechanical spring-damper characteristics. This resonant frequency is usually a complex function of the geometry and operating conditions due to the gas-spring effect. A closed form solution for performance estimation of such a setup proposed earlier in literature (Choe 2 ̆ 6 Kim) {{does not account for}} the effect of valve dynamics. However, the timing of valve operation influences the in-cylinder pressure build-up transients and thus modulates the gas-spring stiffness. While an accurate estimation of the resonant frequency requires a multi-physics simulation of the compressor, a detailed simulation of such complexity is time intensive especially when performing design optimization studies and hence analytical models would be preferred. The current work presents an improved equivalent analytic model for such optimization. Uncertainty analysis of the present approach is also discussed by comparing different performance parameters against full nonlinear model estimates, as relevant...|$|E
30|$|At present, {{with the}} {{combination}} of various fields and remote sensing technology {{becoming more and more}} close, the demand for using remote sensing images to accurately distinguish geographical information is highlighted. Many deep learning models are used in remote sensing image processing, such as Zhang et al. [4] made a technical tutorial {{on the state of the}} art for deep learning about remote sensing data, and Das and Ghosh [5] presented a deep learning approach for spatiotemporal prediction of remote sensing data. Hinton et al. [6] gave deep neural networks for acoustic modeling in speech recognition. Badrinarayanan et al. [7] constructed a deep convolutional encoder-decoder architecture for image segmentation. Compared with traditional neural networks and support vector machines, the accuracy of recognition using convolutional neural networks was improved. Mou et al. [8] presented a convolutional neural network (CNN) extraction of visual features which is more suitable for image retrieval. From the above, it can be seen that the deep learning model shows a strong ability for learning and generalization of remote sensing data and can better facilitate remote sensing image classification and identification of features. Deep belief network (DBN) algorithm has high learning and generalization ability for data and has achieved a lot of achievements in the field of image processing and network applications. For example, Dahl et al. [9] improved context-dependent pre-trained deep neural networks for large vocabulary speech recognition. Chen et al. [10] made spectral-spatial classification of hyperspectral data based on deep belief network. Fischer and Igel [11] trained restricted Boltzmann machines. Tran et al. [12] proposed an approach to fault diagnosis of reciprocating <b>compressor</b> <b>valves</b> using deep belief networks.|$|E
30|$|Fault {{diagnosis}} of mechanical {{system based on}} ANN has some limitations. First, extraction and selection of features depend largely on the prior knowledge of signal-processing technique and diagnosis experience, and generalization is weak. Second, ANN adopts a shallow structure, which also limits ANN to learn complex nonlinear structures in fault diagnosis [32]. Deep neural network (DNN) is developed based on deep learning theory, which can enhance the accuracy of big data classification [33] and effectively overcome the preceding shortcomings. Deep learning was first introduced into the field of fault diagnosis by Tran, et al [34], who applied deep belief network (DBN) based on Teager energy operator to achieve fault {{diagnosis of}} reciprocating <b>compressor</b> <b>valves.</b> A multisensor health diagnosis method based on the DBN was presented in Ref. [35], which classified the sensor signals collected from a damaged structure. Guo, et al [36], developed a hierarchical adaptive {{deep convolutional neural network}} for bearing fault diagnosis. Jia, et al [32], used DNN for intelligence fault diagnosis in rotating machinery, especially in the case when the vibration data were massive. ELM has been extensively applied and popularized in the fault diagnosis of mechanical system in recent years. Yang, et al [37], proposed a multilayer ELM based on representational learning for fault diagnosis. The effectiveness of this method was successfully verified by applying a wind turbine system. Wei, et al [38], proposed a method based on local mean decomposition to identify the different fault types of gearbox, combining permutation entropy and ELM. More references on the applications of ELM in machine fault diagnostics were provided in Refs. [39 – 42].|$|E

30|$|Limitations above can be {{overcome}} by deep learning algorithms which follow an effective way of learning multiple layers of representations [19]. Essentially, a deep learning algorithm uses deep neural networks which contain multiple hidden layers to learn information from the input, but was not put into practice because of its training difficulty until Geoffrey Hinton proposed layer-wise pre-training algorithm to effectively train deep networks in 2006 [20]. Since then, deep learning techniques have been advanced significantly and their successful applications have been seen in various fields [21], including hand written digit recognition [22], computer vision [23 – 26], Google Map [27], and speech recognition [28 – 30]. In addition, For natural language processing (NLP), deep learning has achieved several successful applications and {{made significant contributions to}} its progress [31 – 33]. In the area of fault diagnosis, deep learning theory also has many applications. For example, deep neural network built for fault signature extraction was utilized for bearings and gearboxes [34], while a classification model based on deep network architecture was proposed in the task of characterizing health states of the aircraft engine and electric power transformer [35]. The deep belief network (DBN) was also used for identifying faults in reciprocating <b>compressor</b> <b>valves</b> [36]. Sparse coding was used to built deep architecture for structural health monitoring [37], and a unique automated fault detection method named “Tilear” using deep learning concepts was proposed for the quality inspection of electromotor [38]. Furthermore, auto-encoder based DBN model was successfully applied to quality inspection [39], while a sparse model based on auto-encoder was shown to form a deep architecture, which realized induction motor fault diagnosis [40].|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an approach to}} implement vibration, pressure, and current signals for fault diagnosis of the valves in reciprocating compressors. Due {{to the complexity of}} structure and motion of such compressor, the acquired vibration signal normally involves transient impacts and noise. This causes the useful information to be corrupted and difficulty in accurately diagnosing the faults with traditional methods. To reveal the fault patterns contained in this signal, the Teager–Kaiser energy operation (TKEO) is proposed to estimate the amplitude envelopes. In case of pressure and current, the random noise is removed by using a denoising method based on wavelet transform. Subsequently, statistical measures are extracted from all signals to represent the characteristics of the valve conditions. In order to classify the faults of <b>compressor</b> <b>valves,</b> a new type of learning architecture for deep generative model called deep belief networks (DBNs) is applied. DBN employs a hierarchical structure with multiple stacked restricted Boltzmann machines (RBMs) and works through a greedy layer-by-layer learning algorithm. In pattern recognition research areas, DBN has proved to be very effective and provided with high performance for binary values. However, for implementing DBN to fault diagnosis where most of signals are real-valued, RBM with Bernoulli hidden units and Gaussian visible units is considered in this study. The proposed approach is validated with the signals from a two-stage reciprocating air compressor under different valve conditions. To confirm the superiority of DBN in fault classification, its performance is compared with that of relevant vector machine and back propagation neuron networks. The achieved accuracy indicates that the proposed approach is highly reliable and applicable in fault diagnosis of industrial reciprocating machinery...|$|E

Reciprocating compressors are critical components in {{the oil and gas}} sector, though their maintenance cost is known to be relatively high. <b>Compressor</b> <b>valves</b> are the weakest component, being the most frequent failure mode, accounting for almost half the maintenance cost. One of the major targets in industry is minimisation of downtime and cost, while maximising availability and safety of a machine, with maintenance considered a key aspect in achieving this objective. The concept of Condition Based Maintenance and Prognostics and Health Management (CBM/PHM) which is founded on the diagnostics and prognostics principles, is a step towards this direction as it offers a proactive means for scheduling maintenance. Despite the fact that diagnostics is an established area for reciprocating compressors, to date there is limited information in the open literature regarding prognostics, especially given the nature of failures can be instantaneous. This work presents an analysis of prognostic performance of several methods (multiple linear regression, polynomial regression, K-Nearest Neighbours Regression (KNNR)), in relation to their accuracy and variability, using actual temperature only valve failure data, an instantaneous failure mode, from an operating industrial compressor. Furthermore, a variation for Remaining Useful Life (RUL) estimation based on KNNR, along with an ensemble technique merging the results of all aforementioned methods are proposed. Prior to analysis, principal components analysis and statistical process control were employed to create T^ 2 and Q metrics, which were proposed to be used as health indicators reflecting degradation process of the valve failure mode and are proposed to be used for direct RUL estimation for the first time. Results demonstrated that even when RUL is relatively short due to instantaneous nature of failure mode, it is feasible to perform good RUL estimates using the proposed techniques...|$|E

40|$|LectureThe {{operation}} of a reciprocating compressor is {{closely linked to the}} performance of its valves in terms of life and efficiency. Most operators report that the most significant cause of forced outages of reciprocating compressors is related to valve failures. In designing a reciprocating compressor valve, desirable functional attributes include good sealing, rapid opening and closing, sustained high flow area and low flow resistance, minimum bouncing upon impact, toleration of impact forces and high temperatures, and low flow resistance. Proper design choices, such as material, mass, spring constant, lift, and flow area will maximize the success of the design. However, simple passive valves do not tolerate wide operating ranges well, often suffering from valve leakage at low pressure ratios and reduced valve life at higher pressure ratios. Valve failures can be divided into two major categories, environmental and mechanical. As impact velocities increase due to higher valve lift or valve operation at off-design conditions, the velocities cause excessive impact stresses and an accelerated damage rate to the valve. Some mechanical causes can be controlled with a good design of the valve components, although the design of a valve is usually optimized for a single design point based on the fixed mass, stiffness, and damping of the design. To better understand the factors that affect reciprocating compressor valve performance and life, a research program was undertaken to systematically investigate the physical behavior of valve plates during compressor operation. The valve plate life of a reciprocating compressor is generally considered to be a function of the plate?s cyclic kinematics, transient stresses, and material properties. Thus, the valve research program aimed to incorporate these fundamental factors into an analysis model that accurately predicts valve life for a given application, geometry, and plate material.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to present a group of {{numerical}} experiments of the fluid flow through different suction mufflers geometries to analyse pressure and velocity behaviour in addition with acoustic pressure effect. The numerical results are oriented to compare how suction muffler geometry affects mas flow rate and compressor efficiency performance on one side and pressure pulsations, transmission losses and compressor noise on the other side (1). The CFD 2 ̆ 6 HT results have been obtained by means of TermoFluids code, a new unstructured and parallel object-oriented CFD 2 ̆ 6 HT code for accurate and reliable solving of industrial flows (2). In all studied cases a multi-dimensional explicit finite volume fractional-step based algorithm has been used with symmetry preserving discretization scheme. When turbulence modelling is needed, an extension of the Yoshizawa non-equilibrium fixed-parameter subgrid-scale (3) model to non-structured meshes is used. The pressure equation is solved by means of parallel Fourier Schur decomposition solver, which is an efficient direct solver for loosely coupled PC clusters (4). Different CFD analysis of compressor suction mufflers has been developed (5) mainly based on k-e RANS models. The present paper is oriented on Large Eddy Simulation (LES) models.

40|$|In {{the field}} of {{reciprocating}} compressors, the developing of reed type valves is a challenging task. The understanding of the fluid flow behaviour through the valve reed is essential to improve the valve design. Hence, this work attempts the dynamic simulation of this fluid-structure interaction (FSI) problem, taking into account valve movement due to piston displacement. In this work attends the in-house implemented CFD 2 ̆ 6 HT and moving mesh coupled code TermoFluids [1]. The CFD 2 ̆ 6 HT solver consists of a three-dimensional explicit finite volume fractional-step algorithm formulated in a second-order, conservative and collocated unstructured grid arrangement. The turbulence is modelled by means of large-eddy simulation. The moving mesh technique {{is based on a}} radial basis function interpolation method, which allows the dynamic deformation of the mesh according to the displacement of the valve [2, 3]. The CFD 2 ̆ 6 HT and moving mesh coupling is built by the space conservation law. The newly implemented FSI global solver is based on a partitioned coupled algorithm in which the dynamic action of the valve is modelled through a specific law based on modal analysis of valve reed theory [4]. In contrast to conventional CSD solvers, this alternative performs a fast prediction of the structure displacement. As a preliminary approach, a simplified geometry of an axial hole plus a rectangular diffuser with a piston based inlet condition is considered. An immersed body procedure is used to simulate solid parts inside the domain and, particularly, to reproduce the bottom and inlet boundaries. This strategy has been enhanced with respect to previous studies [5]; thus, the flow phenomena is now better captured specially when the opening of the valve is narrow. As an addition, a parametric study will be carried out in order to analyse the influence of the valve thickness. REFERENCES [1] O. Lehmkuhl, R. Borrell, C. D. Pérez-Segarra, M. Soria, A. Oliva.
