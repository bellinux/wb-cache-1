40|$|What role does {{attention}} to different object properties play in early vocabulary development? This longitudinal study using event-related potentials {{in combination with}} behavioral measures investigated 20 - and 24 -month-oldsâ€™ (n = 38; n = 34; overlapping n = 24) ability to use object shape and object part information in word-object mapping.

At 20 months, the N 400 to words primed by object shape varied in topography and amplitude depending on vocabulary size, and these differences predicted productive vocabulary size at 24 months. At 24 months, when most of the children had vocabularies of several hundred words, the relation between vocabulary size and the N 400 effect in a shape context was weaker. Detached object parts did not function as word primes regardless of age or vocabulary size, although the part-objects were identified behaviorally. The behavioral measure, however, also showed relatively poor recognition of the part-objects compared to the shape-objects. These three findings provide new support for the link between shape recognition and early vocabulary development...|$|E

However orientation of the research work concerning these materials has been mainly directed to qualitative analysis, thus a lack of data on the mechanical properties of these alloys, especially on fatigue behaviour, necessitates fhther research. The aim of the present research work is to study the shape-memory effect on Ti 1 and CuZn- 41 -yires. A tensile testing machine has thus been developped specidly adapted to such kiGd of investigations. The fatigue analysis of the shape memory was performed using wire specimens. The specimens were subjected to ranges of stresses under thermal cycles, thus the variation of transformation temperatures as well as the variation of strain between the high and low temperature phases was recorded.

40|$|Intelligent and {{adaptive}} material systems and structures {{have become very}} important in engineering applications. The basic characteristic of these systems {{is the ability to}} adapt to the environmental conditions. A new class of materials with promising applications in structural and mechanical systems is shape memory alloy (SMA). The mechanical behavior of shape memory alloys in particular shows a strong dependence on temperature. This property provides opportunities for the utilization of SMAs in actuators or energy dissipation devices. However, the behavior of systems <b>containing</b> <b>shape</b> memory components under random excitation has not yet been addressed in the literature. Such a study is important to verify the feasibility of using SMAs in structural systems. In this work a nondeterministic study of the dynamic behavior of a single-degree-of-freedom (SDOF) mechanical system, having a Nitinol spring as a restoring force element is presented. The SMA spring is characterized using a one-dimensional phenomenological constitutive model based on the classical Devonshire theory. Response statistics for zero mean random vibration of the SDOF under a wide range of temperature is obtained. Furthermore, nonzero mean analysis of these systems is carried out...|$|E
40|$|A {{significant}} amount {{of research in the}} last few years has greatly advanced the field of structural control through the use of smart materials. Smart materials have the ability to change shape, stiffness, natural frequency, damping and other mechanical characteristics in response to environmental condition changes. One of he new class of materials with promising applications in structural and mechanical systems are Shape Memory Alloys (SMAs). However, there are few studies where the random response of mechanical systems <b>containing</b> <b>shape</b> memory components has been conducted. Such study is important to verify the feasibility on the use of SMAs in structural components. The present contribution reports on the operator split technique applied to random vibration of single-degree-of-freedom (SDOF) mechanical system with a shape memory helical spring. A constitutive theory originally developed by Fremond with internal variables that must satisfy internal constrains is used to model the restoring force provided by the spring. The operator split technique has been used on the solution of well-posed nonlinear dynamic problem and its basic idea is to promote a partition of state space in sub-spaces that may be solved separately. Results in terms of root-mean-square for both zero and non-zero mean random vibration is presented for SDOF shape memory oscillator. Numerical simulations of the system under a wide range of white noise excitation are presented...|$|E
40|$|Space {{and shape}} are {{distinct}} perceptual categories. In language, perceptual information {{can also be}} used to describe abstract semantic concepts like a â€˜rising incomeâ€™ (space) or a â€˜square personalityâ€™ (shape). Despite being inherently concrete, co-speech gestures depicting space and shape can accompany concrete or abstract utterances. Here, we investigated the way that abstractness influences the neural processing of the perceptual categories of space and shape in gestures. Thus, we tested the hypothesis that the neural processing of perceptual categories is highly dependent on language context. In a two-factorial design, we investigated the neural basis for the processing of gestures <b>containing</b> <b>shape</b> (SH) and spatial information (SP) when accompanying concrete (c) or abstract (a) verbal utterances. During fMRI data acquisition participants were presented with short video clips of the four conditions (cSP, aSP, cSH, aSH) while performing an independent control task. Abstract (a) as opposed to concrete (c) utterances activated temporal lobes bilaterally and the left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) for both shape-related (SH) and space-related (SP) utterances. An interaction of perceptual category and semantic abstractness in a more anterior part of the left IFG and inferior part of the posterior temporal lobe indicates that abstractness strongly influenced the neural processing of space and shape information. Despite the concrete visual input of co-speech gestures in all conditions, space and shape information is processed differently depending on the semantic abstractness of its linguistic context...|$|E

40|$|The lateral {{occipital}} cortex (LOC) activates selectively {{to images}} of intact objects versus scrambled controls, is selective for the figure-ground relationship of a scene, and exhibits {{at least some}} degree of invariance for size and position. Because of these attributes, it {{is considered to be}} a crucial part of the object recognition pathway. Here we show that human LOC is critically involved in perceptual decisions about object shape. High-density EEG was recorded while subjects performed a threshold-level shape discrimination task on texture-defined figures segmented by either phase or orientation cues. The appearance or disappearance of a figure region from a uniform background generated robust visual evoked potentials throughout retinotopic cortex as determined by inverse modeling of the scalp voltage distribution. Contrasting responses from trials <b>containing</b> <b>shape</b> changes that were correctly detected (hits) with trials in which no change occurred (correct rejects) revealed stimulus-locked, target-selective activity in the occipital visual areas LOC and V 4 preceding the subject's response. Activity that was locked to the subjects' reaction time was present in the LOC. Response-locked activity in the LOC was determined to be related to shape discrimination for several reasons: shape-selective responses were silenced when subjects viewed identical stimuli but their attention was directed away from the shapes to a demanding letter discrimination task; shape-selectivity was present across four different stimulus configurations used to define the figure; LOC responses correlated with participants' reaction times. These results indicate that decision-related activity is present in the LOC when subjects are engaged in threshold-level shape discriminations...|$|E
40|$|Seeded {{emulsion}} polymerization {{is used to}} produce large quantities of shape anisotropic, amphoteric particles in a size range of about 1 ??m. Two different kinds of shape anisotropic particles are prepared for comparison to {{study the effects of}} incorporating pH-responsive groups on the properties of suspensions <b>containing</b> <b>shape</b> anisotropic colloidal particles. Copolymer dicolloids (CDC) containing pyridine groups are synthesized by swelling spherical, lightly cross linked polystyrene seeds with mixture of styrene and 2 -vinyl pyridine (2 VP) followed by secondary polymerization. Homopolymer dicolloids (HDC) are made in a similar procedure with only pure styrene swollen into seeds. To investigate the effects of weak attractions, the particles are coated with the nonionic surfactant hexaethylene glycol monododecyl ether (C 12 E 6). As confirmed by electrophoretic mobility measurements as a function of pH, the CDC particles continue to show amphoteric properties. States of aggregation of dilute suspensions are mapped as functions of ionic strength and pH. The CDC particles show amphoteric behavior with strong attractions in medium pH range, while HDC remain stable at all pH???s studied (3 0. 5) with small linear elastic modulus (G 0 ???*) above ??g at different pH conditions and ionic strengths up to 0. 5 M proving again that the particles experience repulsive or weakly-attractive conditions. The CDC particles behave in a similar manner at high or low pH at an ionic strength, [I] of 0. 001 M, but gel at a volume fraction of ??g< 0. 3 and display anomalously large G 0 ???* at the gel transition at intermediate pH or at pH= 9 and I= 0. 5 M. The modulus and yielding behavior of these suspensions indicate that even at pH= 9 or pH= 3. 7 and I= 0. 001 the CDC particles experience weak attractions that cannot be explained as arising from isotropic repulsions as experienced by the HDC particles. At pH= 9 and I= 0. 5 M or pH= 4. 6 and I= 0. 001 M, these anomalous attractions are accentuated. These anomalous attractions are understood as arising from the chemical anisotropy of the CDC particles where the protrusion created in the second polymerization step is rich in poly- 2 VP while the seed is rich in negatively charged sulfate groups. These chemical differences can give rise to directional interactions due to differences in charge or due to differences in hydrophobicity. A key conclusion drawn from this work is that the signature of directional interactions comes in the way gels and glasses yield when stressed. Gel points are shifted by anisotropic interactions but the same gel points can be generated with isotropic interactions if the attractions are strong enough. Instead, gel composed of particles experiencing anisotropic chemical interactions yield with multiple constraints under conditions where this is not seen for particles with isotropic interactions...|$|E
