Nine of 126 pools of <b>culled</b> <b>layer</b> hatching eggs, 2 of 126 pools of surplus layer hatching eggs, and one of 126 pools of early layer hatching eggs were contaminated with Salmonella. All 126 pools of broiler breeder surplus, and early and culled hatching eggs tested negative for Salmonella. All 168 pools of regular table eggs tested negative for Salmonella, whilst one of 84 pools of early table eggs contained Salmonella agona. The pools of <b>culled</b> <b>layer</b> hatching eggs and surplus layer hatching eggs that contained S. typhimurium were derived from the same breeder operation. Similarly, the pools of <b>culled</b> and early <b>layer</b> hatching eggs that contained S. heidelberg were derived from one breeder operation. Pools of culled hatching eggs were more frequently contaminated with Salmonella than other hatching or table eggs. Pools containing eggs that were both cracked and dirty were more frequently contaminated with Salmonella than all other pools of eggs. The overall Salmonella contamination rate of the table eggs was 0. 07 to 0. 4 %. Critical control points (macroscopic classification of the eggs as cracked and dirty) were validated microbiologically...|$|R
40|$|Aim: To {{determine}} the microbial quality of <b>culled</b> chicken <b>layers</b> in Penang, Malaysia. Materials and Methods: Samples {{were obtained from}} three layer farms (designated as Farm A, Farm B and Farm C). A total of 67 <b>culled</b> chicken <b>layer</b> samples consisting of egg wash water, chicken carcass rinse, drinking water, cloaca swab, feed and faeces were examined for enterobacteriaceae, total and faecal coliforms, and Escherichia coli using the procedures in the bacteriological analytical manual. Results: The total plate count for bacteria ranged from 2. 7 x 103 cfuml- 1 to 1. 8 x 107 cfug- 1 (Farm A), 1100. 0 Most probable number (MPN) ml- 1 / MPNg- 1 for Farm A, B and C. Similarly, E. coli count for all the three farms ranged from 1100. 0 MPNml- 1 /MPNg- 1. E. coli counts were very low {{for most of the}} samples examined except chicken carcass and faeces. Conclusion: In general, Farm A had higher bacterial count, followed by Farm C and Farm B. This work gives an indication that pathogenic foodborne pathogens such as E. coli, Salmonella, Citrobacter, Enterobacter, Klebsiella, Shigella and Yersinia spp. may be present in <b>culled</b> chicken <b>layers</b> and consequently pose the risk of causing food poisoning or outbreaks...|$|R
40|$|In 1949 the {{receipts}} from {{eggs and}} chickens amounted to 8. 6, 6. 0, and 13. 2 {{percent of the}} total cash receipts from farm marketings in Washington, Oregon, and Utah, respectively. About three fourths of these receipts were from sale of eggs and one fourth from the sale of chickens. Receipts from chicken sales, while less important than from eggs, amounted to about 21. 5 million dollars in 1949 in the three states. As would be expected, considering the importance of egg production in the three states, many of the chickens sold are <b>cull</b> <b>layers</b> and other chickens produced incidental to the egg enterprise. While exact data are not available, {{about a third of the}} chicken receipts in the three states in 1949 were from birds produced exclusively for meat and two thirds from other chickens. The percentage of receipts from meat birds was slightly higher than this in Washington and lower in Utah. Marketing agencies are not usually specialized as to type of chickens handled so it seemed desirable to study the marketing of all classes of chickens...|$|R

40|$|The {{present study}} was carried out to compare the {{productivity}} and profitability of two exotic commercial layer strains commonly raised for egg production in Nigeria. They are brown (Isa Brown) and black (Bovan Nera) feathered layer strains. Inputs such as feeds, labor and drugs as well as income generated from eggs produced including money realized from <b>culls</b> (spent <b>layers)</b> were considered for comparative economic analyses. In terms of egg production, brown feathered layers produced 326 ± 51. 3 eggs/week and black recorded 273. 12 ± 36. 9 eggs/week and the difference was statistically different (p< 0. 01). Brown layers produced more eggs/bird/week during the observed period than black layers. In terms of net returns, brown layers also recorded higher (p< 0. 01) profitability level than their black counterparts. The brown birds had $ 4, 345. 1 per farm and black recorded $ 2, 229. 5 per farm. The difference was $ 2, 115. 5 in favor of brown layers. The result showed that brown layers are good converters of feeds to eggs, consumed less than black layers and yet produced more eggs than the latter. Brown feathered strain therefore, appeared commercially productive and profitable than black feathered ones...|$|R
