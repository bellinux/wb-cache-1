40|$|Synergy for low {{temperature}} Hg 0 oxidation under {{selective catalytic reduction}} (SCR) atmosphere was achieved when <b>copper</b> <b>oxides</b> and cerium oxides were combined in a CuO-CeO 2 /TiO 2 (CuCeTi) catalyst. Hg 0 oxidation efficiency as high as 99. 0 % was observed on the CuCeTi catalyst at 200 °C, even the gas hourly space velocity was extremely high. To analyze the synergistic effect, comparisons of catalyst performance {{in the presence of}} different SCR reaction gases were systematically conducted over CuO/TiO 2 (CuTi), CeO 2 /TiO 2 (CeTi) and CuCeTi catalysts prepared by sol-gel method. The interactions between <b>copper</b> <b>oxides</b> and cerium oxides in CuCeTi catalyst yielded more surface chemisorbed oxygen, and facilitated the conversion of gas-phase O 2 to surface oxygen, which are favorable for Hg 0 oxidation. <b>Copper</b> <b>oxides</b> in the combination interacted with NO forming more chemisorbed oxygen for Hg 0 oxidation in the absence of gas-phase O 2. Cerium oxides in the combination promoted Hg 0 oxidation through enhancing the transformations of NO to NO 2. In the absence of NO, NH 3 exhibited no inhibitive effect on Hg 0 oxidation, because enough Lewis acid sites due to the combination of <b>copper</b> <b>oxides</b> and cerium oxides scavenged the competitive adsorption between NH 3 and Hg 0. In the presence of NO, although NH 3 lowered Hg 0 oxidation rate through inducing reduction of oxidized mercury, complete recovery of Hg 0 oxidation activity over the CuCeTi catalyst was quickly achieved after cutting off NH 3. This study revealed the synergistic effect of the combination of <b>copper</b> <b>oxides</b> and cerium oxides on Hg 0 oxidation, and explored the involved mechanisms.

5|$|In 1873, Willoughby Smith {{found that}} the {{electrical}} resistance of grey selenium was dependent on the ambient light. This led to its use as a cell for sensing light. The first commercial products using selenium were developed by Werner Siemens in the mid-1870s. The selenium cell {{was used in the}} photophone developed by Alexander Graham Bell in 1879. Selenium transmits an electric current proportional to the amount of light falling on its surface. This phenomenon was used in the design of light meters and similar devices. Selenium's semiconductor properties found numerous other applications in electronics. The development of selenium rectifiers began during the early 1930s, and these replaced <b>copper</b> <b>oxide</b> rectifiers because they were more efficient.

40|$|The {{intrinsic}} {{instability of}} underdoped <b>copper</b> <b>oxides</b> towards inhomogeneous states {{is one of}} the central puzzles of the physics of correlated materials. The influence of the Mott physics on the doping-temperature phase diagram of <b>copper</b> <b>oxides</b> represents a major issue that is subject of intense theoretical and experimental effort. Here, we investigate the ultrafast electron dynamics in prototypical single-layer Bi-based cuprates at the energy scale of the O- 2 p→Cu- 3 d charge-transfer (CT) process. We demonstrate a clear evolution of the CT excitations from incoherent and localized, as in a Mott insulator, to coherent and delocalized, as in a conventional metal. This reorganization of the high-energy degrees of freedom occurs at the critical doping p_cr≃ 0. 16 irrespective of the temperature, and it can be well described by dynamical mean field theory calculations. We argue that the onset of the low-temperature charge instabilities is the low-energy manifestation of the underlying Mottness that characterizes the p<p_cr region of the phase diagram. This discovery sets a new framework for theories of charge order and low-temperature phases in underdoped <b>copper</b> <b>oxides...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{discovery}} of high-temperature superconductivity in <b>copper</b> <b>oxides</b> was not accidental, but {{was based on}} the knowledge that the divalent copper ion, Cu 2 +, is one of the strongest Jahn–Teller ions. The Jahn–Teller effect is a consequence of the interplay between electronic degeneracy and coupling to the lattice, i. e. unconventional local electron–lattice interactions. The search for superconductivity in <b>copper</b> <b>oxides</b> was motivated by the idea that Jahn–Teller polaron formation could be a novel and much stronger glue for electron pairing than conventional Bardeen–Cooper–Schrieffer electron–phonon coupling.

25|$|Whilst arsenic {{was most}} likely {{originally}} mixed with copper {{as a result of}} the ores already containing it, its use probably continued for a number of reasons.
