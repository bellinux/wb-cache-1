50|$|The <b>Genesis</b> <b>Rock</b> is {{a sample}} of Moon rock {{retrieved}} by Apollo 15 astronauts James Irwin and David Scott in 1971 during their second lunar EVA, at Spur crater. It is currently stored at the Lunar Sample Laboratory Facility in Houston, Texas. It is sample number 15415.|$|R
50|$|It {{also makes}} {{up much of}} the lunar highlands; the <b>Genesis</b> <b>Rock</b> is made of anorthosite, which is {{composed}} largely of anorthite. Anorthite was discovered in samples from comet Wild 2, and the mineral is an important constituent of Ca-Al-rich inclusions in rare varieties of chondritic meteorites.|$|R
50|$|Perhaps {{the most}} notable of the samples stored at the {{facility}} is the <b>Genesis</b> <b>Rock,</b> a sample ultimately determined to be nearly {{as old as the}} moon itself. Also at the facility is the sample known as Big Muley, the largest sample returned from the moon by Apollo.|$|R
5000|$|Chemical {{analysis}} of the <b>Genesis</b> <b>Rock</b> indicated it is an anorthosite, composed mostly of a type of plagioclase feldspar known as anorthite. The rock was formed {{in the early stages}} of the Solar System, at least 4 billion years ago. It was recovered in a crater of the Moon, near other rocks of its kind.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Genesis</b> <b>Rock,</b> (Lunar sample 15415) {{obtained}} from the Moon by astronauts during Apollo 15 mission, has been dated at 4.08 billion years. During Apollo 16, older rocks, including Lunar sample 67215, dated at 4.46 billion years, were brought back. Lunar sample 67215 is the oldest known rock on Earth, even though it originated on the Moon.|$|R

50|$|Since {{the early}} {{emergence}} of Colombian {{rock in the}} 1960s and 1970s, bands like <b>Genesis</b> (Colombian <b>rock</b> band) began to experiment fusing traditional Colombian music with pop rock.

5000|$|Between July 26 and August 7, 1971 - as the Apollo 15 Lunar Module Pilot (LMP) - Irwin logged 295 {{hours and}} 11 minutes in space. His extravehicular {{activity}} (EVA) on the Moons surface amounted to 18 hours and 35 {{minutes of the}} mission time (an additional 33 minutes was used to do a stand-up EVA by opening the LMs docking hatch to survey the surroundings and take photographs). Irwin and David Scotts mission was more science-based than previous missions, which meant that they received intensive geological training to meet the demanding nature of the J-Mission profile. [...] This extra training is credited with allowing them to make {{one of the most}} important discoveries of the Apollo era, the <b>Genesis</b> <b>Rock.</b>|$|R

50|$|Even in the 19th century, geologists {{suspected}} {{there was}} a geological connexion between Sylt and Heligoland, whose rocks have a similar coloration but are considerably older and have a different <b>genesis.</b> The <b>rocks</b> that break off the Rotes Kliff - such as flint, rhomb porphyry or Rapakivi granite - still enable an accurate determination of their origin to be made.|$|R
5|$|The rocks {{collected}} from the Moon are extremely old compared to rocks found on Earth, as measured by radiometric dating techniques. They {{range in age from}} about 3.2 billion years for the basaltic samples derived from the lunar maria, to about 4.6 billion years for samples derived from the highlands crust. As such, they represent samples from a very early period {{in the development of the}} Solar System, that are largely absent on Earth. One important rock found during the Apollo Program is dubbed the <b>Genesis</b> <b>Rock,</b> retrieved by astronauts David Scott and James Irwin during the Apollo 15 mission. This anorthosite rock is composed almost exclusively of the calcium-rich feldspar mineral anorthite, and is believed to be representative of the highland crust. A geochemical component called KREEP was discovered by Apollo 12, which has no known terrestrial counterpart. KREEP and the anorthositic samples have been used to infer that the outer portion of the Moon was once completely molten (see lunar magma ocean).|$|R
40|$|We present new U-series isotope, 87 Sr / 86 Sr, 143 Nd/ 144 Nd {{and trace}} element data {{for a set}} of mafic, K-rich rocks from volcanoes in Central^Southern Italy.

40|$|International audienceBecause {{of their}} complex <b>genesis,</b> <b>rocks</b> and geomaterials are {{commonly}} polycrystalline heterogeneous systems, with various scale-level chemical and structural heterogeneities. Like most other μ-analytical techniques relying on scanning instruments with pencil-beam, the X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) technique allows elemental oxidation {{states to be}} probed with high spatial resolution but suffers from long acquisition times, imposing practical limits {{on the field of}} view. Now, regions of interest of sample are generally several orders of magnitude larger than the beam size. Here, we show the potential of coupling XANES and full-field absorption radiographies with a large hard X-ray beam. Thanks to a new setup, which allows both the acquisition of a XANES image stack and the execution of polarization contrast imaging, 1 to 4 mega-pixel crystallographic orientations and Fe oxidation state mapping corrected from polarization effects are obtained {{in a couple of hours}} on polycrystalline materials with submicrometric resolution. The demonstration is first carried out on complex metamorphic rocks, where Fe 3 +/Fetotal images reveal subtle redox variations within single mineralogical phases. A second application concerns a bentonite analogue considered for nuclear waste and CO 2 storage. Proportion mappings of finely mixed phases are extracted from hyperspectral data, imaging the spatial progress of reaction processes essential for the safety of such storage systems...|$|R

40|$|The {{intent of}} this {{dissertation}} {{is to examine}} the way <b>Genesis</b> retained progressive <b>rock</b> elements during its 1978 - 91 pop-rock period. Genesis began composing music in a pop-rock style in 1978, adapting to the changes in rock by incorporating progressive rock elements into a pop-rock style. This study analyzes thirty-four selected songs from six Genesis albums considered in the pop-rock genre, identifying some of the progressive rock elements in these songs. The project begins with a historical survey of Genesis, shedding light {{on the development of the}} band`s progressive style, its transition through personnel changes and in the music before and after the departure of Peter Gabriel, and the shift toward pop-rock beginning in 1978. A review of published literature and analyses addresses the progressive nature of <b>Genesis.</b> The progressive <b>rock</b> elements pertinent to this study are defined using scholarly literature and analyses of Genesis and other established progressive rock bands. Analytical charts that indicate form, harmony, and rhythm are used to examine the common progressive characteristics in each song addressed in this study...|$|R
