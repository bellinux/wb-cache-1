5|$|Schubert's last sonatas are {{sometimes}} compared to Mozart's last symphonies, as unique compositional achievements: both consist of trilogies with one tragic, minor-key work, and two major-key works; both were created during an astoundingly {{short period of}} time; and both creating a <b>culmination</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> composer's lifetime achievement in their respective genres.|$|E

5|$|Although {{contemporary}} historians vilified Domitian {{after his}} death, his administration provided {{the foundation for}} the peaceful empire of the 2nd century CE, and the <b>culmination</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 'Pax Romana'. His successors Nerva and Trajan were less restrictive, but in reality their policies differed little from Domitian's. Much more than a gloomy coda to the 1st century, the Roman Empire prospered between 81 and 96, in a reign which Theodor Mommsen described as the sombre but intelligent despotism of Domitian.|$|E

Disagreements over and difficulties with the assimilation of the eastern Ruthenian populations of the Commonwealth had become clearly discernible. At an earlier stage (from the late 16th century), they manifested themselves in the religious Union of Brest, which split the Eastern Christians of the Commonwealth, and on the military front, {{in a series of}} Cossack uprisings.|$|E

Mu'awiya, who had emerged in 661 as the ruler of the Muslim Arab empire following a civil war, renewed aggressive warfare against Byzantium after a lapse of some years and hoped to deliver a lethal blow by capturing the Byzantine capital, Constantinople.|$|E

5|$|According to the {{memoirs of}} Ken Flower, then the {{director}} of Rhodesia's Central Intelligence Organisation (CIO), Harper's downfall {{was the result of}} an extramarital affair with a young secretary in the Rhodesian civil service who the CIO discovered was an agent for MI6. Flower informed Smith of this on 3 July and the Prime Minister demanded Harper's resignation that afternoon; Harper acquiesced the next day. Because this was kept secret (presuming it is true), Harper's sudden departure from the Cabinet was interpreted by many observers at the time as the <b>culmination</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> personal and political rivalry between Smith and Harper, or the result of disagreements over the new constitution.|$|E

5|$|At mid-afternoon, as the chariot reaches alukalam, Aravan is {{stripped}} to his skeletal straw body. Most Aravanis have left and men wedded to Aravan also break their thalis and bangles and perform all the rites of widowhood (the vellikkal rites) before {{the image of}} Aravan. Meanwhile, a paratiyar (Mahabharata-reciter) {{tells the story of}} the <b>culmination</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> war, symbolic of Aravan fulfilling his wish of seeing the war. Hiltebeitel suggests that while the Aravanis weep for Aravan's kalappali, the villagers weep for the death of an ancestor, as life leaves Aravan's head at the end of the war.|$|E
5|$|Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor, {{agreed to}} an {{audience}} with the Electress Palatine in December 1711. He concluded that the Electress's succession brought no quandary, but added that he must succeed her. Cosimo and herself were abhorred by his reply. Realising how unforthcoming he had been, Charles wrote to Florence agreeing to the project, mentioning but one clause: the Tuscan state must not be bequeathed to the enemies of the House of Austria. At the <b>culmination</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> War of the Spanish Succession, at the Treaties of Utrecht and Rattstatt, Cosimo did not vie for international assurances for the Electress's succession. An inaction he would later grow to lament.|$|E

This plan included extremely ambitious goals {{for the expansion of}} Bahá'í communities and institutions, the translation of Bahá'í texts into several new languages, and the sending of Bahá'í pioneers into previously unreached nations. He announced in letters during the Ten Year Crusade that it would be followed by other plans {{under the direction of the}} Universal House of Justice, which was elected in 1963 at the <b>culmination</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Crusade.

30|$|Upon {{successful}} charge transfer, <b>the</b> <b>culmination</b> <b>of</b> all <b>the</b> photophysical processes on {{the semiconductor}} surface succeeds with an effective electrocatalytic process [1, 26, 88]. An efficient electrocatalyst is one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> most important parameters for achieving efficient photocatalytic water splitting in visible light. To achieve efficient water splitting under visible light irradiation {{where there is}} no significant overpotential for electrocatalysis, the electrocatalysts need to transfer the received electrons and holes to the relevant reactants in the water splitting redox reactions [1, 26].|$|R
