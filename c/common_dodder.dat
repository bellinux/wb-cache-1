50|$|The local Wildlife Trust has a fifteen-acre {{nature reserve}} at Collyweston Quarries where Lincolnshire {{limestone}} was quarried, {{to the north}} of the A43. This has the pyramidal orchid, <b>common</b> <b>dodder,</b> greater knapweed, common rock-rose, common bird's foot trefoil, and clustered bellflower. Birds found there include the European green woodpecker and glowworms are found there in the summer.|$|E
50|$|The main {{habitats}} are maritime heath and maritime grassland, heath, scrub, flush and deciduous woodland. The maritime heath {{is dominated}} by heather (Calluna vulgaris), bell heather (Erica cinerea) and western gorse (Ulex gallii). Maritime grassland occurs on the steeper cliff slopes and {{is dominated by}} red fescue (Festuca rubra), with spring squill (Scilla verna), wild carrot (Daucus carota), kidney vetch (Anthyllis vulneraria) and sea plantain (Plantago maritima). The Red Data Book western clover (Trifolium occidentale) and the nationally rare hare’s foot clover (Trifolium arvense) grow here as well as hairy bird’s-foot trefoil (Lotus subbiflorus) and bird's-foot fenugreek (Trifolium ornithopodioides).Large areas are covered by scrub, dominated by gorse (Ulex europaeus) and blackthorn (Prunus spinosa) and provide habitat for invertebrates and birds. <b>Common</b> <b>dodder</b> (Cuscuta epithymum) parasitises the gorse. A number of wet flushes occur along the coast dominated by common reed (Phragmites australis). A small area of woodland dominated by elm (Ulmus glabra) and sycamore has developed on abandoned horticultural plots.A description by Jean Lawman sums up the area eloquently: Also in June, many of the cliffs are bright with Oxeye Daisies Leucanthemum vulgare and they are particularly abundant around Logan Rock and Porth Curnow area where they mix with foxgloves and button like, mauve Sheepsbit Jasione montana. The spectacle of all these flowers strewn along the cliff edge, with the classically beautiful Pednevounder beach below and the rugged headland of Treryn Dinas in the distance, {{must be one of}} the loveliest in Cornwall.|$|E
40|$|Throughout western Europe, {{the area}} of dry {{heathland}} declined continuously during the last centuries, and the remaining heaths are severely fragmented. Consequently, species dependent on a particular phase of the heathland succession have severely decreased in abundance and distribution. One of these species is the endangered holoparasite <b>Common</b> <b>dodder</b> Cuscuta epithymum, which typically occurs in the pioneer phase of the heathland succession and currently is red listed in Flanders and in other European countries. This paper describes {{the results of a}} four-year research in which we aimed at determining the C. epithymum’s distribution pattern and its habitat requirements, at unraveling various demographic characteristics, and at assessing the long-term survival probabilities of its metapopulations under various management regimes. <b>Common</b> <b>dodder</b> can be described as a species that is strongly adapted for living in dynamic heathlands, but still is sensitive for local extinction. The occurrence and population dynamics of <b>Common</b> <b>dodder</b> are mainly controlled by the structure and dynamics of the vegetation, which in turn is heavily influenced by management events. It performs best in early successional heathland patches in which Calluna-stems were not older than seven years and have a canopy height between 10 and 30 cm. Better insight in the life-cycle of <b>Common</b> <b>dodder</b> provided guidelines for a more accurate conservation management which hopefully will prevent further loss of this interesting, dry heathland species. status: publishe...|$|E
50|$|Cuscuta californica is {{a species}} of dodder known by the <b>common</b> names Chaparral <b>dodder</b> and California dodder. It is native to western North America.|$|R
50|$|Cuscuta campestris, {{with the}} <b>common</b> names field <b>dodder,</b> golden dodder, large-seeded alfalfa dodder, yellow dodder and prairie dodder, is a {{parasitic}} plant which {{belongs to the}} family Convolvulaceae. It was formerly classified in the family Cuscutaceae.|$|R
50|$|Probably {{the most}} useful common names for Cassytha species are laurel dodder or dodder laurel, because they look like dodder and are {{fragrant}} members of the laurel family, Lauraceae. The name love vine has merit because some species, in particular C. filiformis, are regarded as aphrodisiacs in the Caribbean region. In practice, however, the confusion between the various species of Cassytha and Cuscuta is so unavoidable that their common names {{are more or less}} interchangeable. Practically all the <b>common</b> names for <b>dodder</b> accordingly are widely applied in error to Cassytha as well, but as a matter of convenience in Florida at least, where members of both groups of plants are present as agricultural pests, a publication of the Department of Agriculture adopts the names woe vine for Cassytha and dodder for Cuscuta.|$|R
40|$|Dodders {{are among}} the most {{important}} parasitic plants that cause serious yield losses in crop plants. In this report, we sought to unveil the genetic basis of dodder parasitism by profiling the trancriptomes of Cuscuta pentagona and C. suaveolens, two of the most <b>common</b> <b>dodder</b> species using a next-generation RNA sequencing platform. De novo assembly of the sequence reads resulted in more than 46, 000 isotigs and contigs (collectively referred to as expressed sequence tags or ESTs) for each species, with {{more than half of them}} predicted to encode proteins that share significant sequence similarities with known proteins of non-parasitic plants. Comparing our datasets with transcriptomes of 12 other fully sequenced plant species confirmed a close evolutionary relationship between dodder and tomato. Using a rigorous set of filtering parameters, we were able to identify seven pairs of ESTs that appear to be shared exclusively by parasitic plants, thus providing targets for tailored management approaches. In addition, we also discovered ESTs with sequences similarities to known plant viruses, including cryptic viruses, in the dodder sequence assemblies. Together this study represents the first comprehensive transcriptome profiling of parasitic plants in the Cuscuta genus, and is expected t...|$|E
50|$|Cuscuta approximata is {{a species}} of dodder known by the <b>common</b> name alfalfa <b>dodder.</b> It is native to Eurasia and Africa, {{but it is also}} found in North America, where it is an {{introduced}} species and uncommon noxious weed. It is a parasitic vine which climbs other plants and takes nutrition directly from them via a haustorium. The dodder resembles a pile of light yellow to orange-red straw wrapped tightly around its host plant. It is mostly stem; the leaves are reduced to scales on the stem's surface, since they are not needed for photosynthesis while the dodder is obtaining nutrients from its host. It bears clusters of tiny yellowish bell-shaped flowers which are only about 3 millimeters wide. The dodder reproduces by seed, with each plant capable of producing over 10,000 seeds at once. This plant is a weed of alfalfa, clover, and tomatoes, as well as other crop plants and native flora. This species is sometimes treated as a subspecies of Cuscuta epithymum.|$|R
