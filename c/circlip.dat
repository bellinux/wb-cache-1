40|$|Abstract — This {{paper is}} all about making and {{analysis}} of Coil Making Machine for <b>Circlips</b> Manufacturing industry. As demand for <b>Circlips</b> is increasing day by day thus the supplier {{wants to make the}} process more error proof and speedy. This paper focuses on the material and calculations for t he same which will help the manufacturers to increase their productivity. Key words — <b>Circlips,</b> Coiling Machine, Servo Feed, and Special Purpose Machines. <b>Circlips</b> are often used to secure pinned connections. <b>Circlips</b> are basically of Two types: Internal Rings for holes (referred as J, JK, B-type). External Rings for shafts (referred as A, AK, AS, AL-type) ...|$|R
50|$|A {{retaining}} ring is a fastener that holds components or assemblies onto a shaft or in a housing/bore when {{installed in a}} groove. Once installed, the exposed portion acts as a shoulder which retains the specific component or assembly. <b>Circlips</b> are a type of {{retaining ring}}.|$|R
50|$|The pin {{itself is}} of {{hardened}} steel and is fixed in the piston, but {{free to move}} in the connecting rod. A few designs use a 'fully floating' design that is loose in both components. All pins must be prevented from moving sideways and the ends of the pin digging into the cylinder wall, usually by <b>circlips.</b>|$|R
50|$|Circlips are {{designed}} to be removed with special <b>circlip</b> plier which can be reassembled for internal or external clips, but in field expedient situations, a pair of needle-nose pliers (for internal clips) or leverage with a flat-headed screwdriver (internal or external) is sometimes used.|$|E
50|$|Since {{circlips}} are stamped out of {{sheet metal}} {{there is a}} smooth side and a rough side. To prevent potential damage, circlips are installed with the smooth side facing the part and the rough side facing out. Wet or dry lubrication is recommended to reduce friction against the <b>circlip,</b> maintaining its function.|$|E
50|$|If a <b>circlip</b> (or any non {{preloaded}} system) is used, {{the force}} acting {{to separate the}} Piston Head and the Cylinder Shaft shoulder is the applied pressure multiplied by {{the area of the}} Piston Head. The Piston Head and Shaft shoulder will separate and the load is fully reacted by the Piston Head Retainer.|$|E
50|$|Between 1960 and 1997, Harden's biggest {{employer}} was Ellison <b>Circlips.</b> The huge factory adjoined another smaller factory producing similar products. On 24 February 1979, Ellison's Mill {{caught fire}} in the computer room and the resultant blaze gutted the timber floored mill. The outer stone walls stayed upright during the fire, {{but because of the}} threat of explosions from the acid baths if they came into contact with water, two houses were evacuated as a precaution.|$|R
50|$|Some <b>circlips</b> {{have two}} {{holes in the}} ends that are {{designed}} to be removed with specially shaped pliers tips. These are often referred to by their trade name; Tru-Arc clips or snap rings. They can be used as both external and internal retaining devices, hence, Tru-Arc pliers come in both compression (squeezing action) and expansion (spreading action) designs. Some Tru-Arc pliers are designed to be converted from one type to the other by simply moving the pliers screw in pivot point.|$|R
50|$|In {{the fully}} {{floating}} configuration, {{a bearing surface}} is created both between the small end eye and gudgeon pin and the journal in the piston. The gudgeon pins are usually secured with <b>circlips.</b> No interference fit is used in any instance and the pin 'floats' entirely on bearing surfaces. The average rubbing speed {{of each of the}} three bearings is halved and the load is shared across a bearing that is usually about three times the length of the semi-floating design with an interference fit with the piston.|$|R
5000|$|Common {{examples}} include e-clips (e-ring) and the (both internal and external) snap ring or <b>circlip</b> [...] These general types of fasteners are sized {{to provide an}} interference fit onto (or into, {{in the case of}} an internal fastener) a groove or land when in use, such that they must be elastically deformed in order to install or remove them.|$|E
5000|$|A canal {{cut in a}} hard material, usually metal. This canal can be round, oval or an arc {{in order}} to receive another {{component}} such as a boss, a tongue or a gasket. It can also be on the circumference of a dowel, a bolt, an axle or on the outside or inside of a tube or pipe etc. This canal may receive a <b>circlip</b> an o-ring or a gasket.|$|E
50|$|Bits or bumpabits are small, plastic circlips, {{the body}} of which passes between the maxilla and {{mandible}} of the beak and are {{held in place by}} the ends of the <b>circlip</b> being placed in the nostrils or nares. Some are held in place by a pin which pierces through the nasal septum. These devices make it difficult for the bird to completely close its beak and grasp the feathers of another individual.|$|E
50|$|In the 1960s, {{there was}} a {{shortage}} of workers in the area, consequently the Horsfall family had to recruit girls from Malta with a hostel being built to house them. In 1972, the mill was bought by Sirdar Wools Ltd and operated until 1995; it was mainly concerned with dyeing knitting wools. But in 1995 it was closed down again until it was bought in 1997-98 by Ellison's Holdings plc, which produced <b>circlips,</b> rings and fasteners for the automotive industry and who had previously been based in nearby Harden. After that it was bought by an American company TransTechnology (GB) Ltd. Now it is owned by Cirteq (GB) Ltd.|$|R
5000|$|Cannibalism may {{be reduced}} by fitting hens {{with a range of}} eyewear. Rose-tinted {{spectacles}} or contact lenses have been used. Opaque spectacles, or blinders, have also been used. For both spectacles and blinders, there are versions that are held in place by <b>circlips</b> into the nares of the bird, or others in which a pin pierces through the nasal septum: this latter method is illegal in the UK. [...] It is theorized that — as with placing red filters over windows, or keeping the birds in red light — the coloured lenses prevent the birds from recognising the blood or raw flesh of other hens, thereby diminishing cannibalistic behaviour.|$|R
50|$|The engine has a forged crankshaft, {{supported}} in changeable thin-wall bearing shells. The journals of the crankshaft and the connecting rods are polished and induction hardened. The counter-weights are screwed {{on the center}} and outer crank arms. The flywheel {{is connected to the}} power take-off side of the engine with screws. The gear drive side of the crankshaft is equipped with a gear, which drives the oil pump and the gear which drives the camshaft. The connecting rods are forged and weight-balanced. While the small connecting rod bore has a bearing pressed into the bore, the crank-sided bore of the connecting rod has a thin-wall bearing. For lubrication and cooling of the connecting rods they have small oil-ducts. Oil is pressed in the ducts from a nozzle at the upper side of the connecting rod. The piston journals are secured with two <b>circlips</b> and are bathed in oil. A heat resistant light-metal-alloy is used for the cast pistons. The combustion chamber is integrated into the piston. For compression, the pistons have two piston rings which slots are cast into the piston. The pistons are also equipped with an oil control ring. The cylinder liners are made of centrifugally cast iron, two rubber rings seal the liners off from the crankcase. The engine has two cast iron cylinder blocks with two cylinders; every block has a head, which makes two cylinder heads.|$|R
50|$|The guide cap {{is fixed}} {{with the help}} of a steel <b>circlip.</b> However in the new design of Axle box guide, the guide cap is welded with the guide {{assembly}} and hence the need of a guide cap has been eliminated. The complete guide and lower spring arrangement is covered with a dashpot cover also known as protective tube. The protective tube has a circular ring over it called the dust shield which prevents the ingress of the dust in the cylinder piston arrangement of the dashpot.|$|E
50|$|Spectacles or 'blinders' are {{pieces of}} plastic or metal shaped like opaque {{spectacles}} {{and attached to}} the bird's beak to block its vision. The devices are held in place either with a <b>circlip</b> which enters the nares or a pin which pierces through the nasal septum. These devices {{are based on the}} principle that by interfering with the vision of the bird, it is less able to visually locate the feathers of another bird and is therefore less able to grasp and pull the feathers.|$|E
50|$|A <b>circlip</b> (a {{portmanteau}} of {{circle and}} clip), {{also known as}} a C-Clip, Seeger ring, snap ring or Jesus clip, is a type of fastener or retaining ring consisting of a semi-flexible metal ring with open ends which can be snapped into place, into a machined groove on a dowel pin or other part to permit rotation but to prevent lateral movement. There are two basic types: internal and external, referring to whether they are fitted into a bore or over a shaft. Circlips are often used to secure pinned connections.|$|E
40|$|Innerhalb des ProKon-Projekts wurde der Kern eines proaktiven Konstruktionssystems auf Basis von Softwareagenten entwickelt. Zum Nachweis der grundlegenden Funktionsweise erfolgte darin ebenso die Ausrichtung dieses Kernsystems auf eine fiktive Anwendung, die in der Industrie evaluiert werden konnte. Zur Erbringung der Funktionalität müssen Softwareagenten generell Aufbau- und Ablaufstrukturen in einer Organisation repräsentieren, die sich jedoch nach Unternehmen, Branche und Produkt unterscheiden. Dem entsprechend kann ein proaktives Konstruktionssystem nicht alle Anwendungen gleichermaßen unterstützen. Das Kernsystem muss vielmehr auf eine spezifische Anwendung ausgerichtet werden. Unter Beachtung des Stands der Forschung ist dafür eine modellbasierte Vorgehensweise notwendig, die die Abgrenzung von Wissens- und Symbolebene berücksichtigt. Bisherige Vorgehensweisen zur Entwicklung von wissensbasierten Systemen und Agentensystemen konnten die aufgestellten Anforderungen nur punktuell erfüllen. Aus der Analyse des bereits existierenden Kernsystems aus dem ProKon-Projekt resultierte, dass ein Organisations-, ein Agenten- und ein Organisationsmodell von einem Wissensingenieur zu erarbeiten ist. Die Erarbeitung des Organisationsmodells als erstes Modell der Vorgehensweise hat das Ziel, den Einsatzkontext des proaktiven Konstruktionssystems anwendungsspezifisch zu analysieren und abzubilden. Generell leistet das auf eine Anwendung ausgerichtete, proaktive Konstruktionssystem besonders bei Variantenkonstruktionen Unterstützung. Dort werden geometrische Änderungen an einem bestehenden Produktmodell durchgeführt, was sich mit der Funktionalität des Systems deckt. Durch den Abgleich des so erhobenen Einsatzkontextes mit 31 vordefinierten Kriterien, ist es dem Wissensingenieur möglich, zu entscheiden, in wie fern der Einsatz des proaktiven Konstruktionssystems unter technischen und wirtschaftlichen Gesichtspunkten sinnvoll ist. Das Agentenmodell als zweites Modell in der Vorgehensweise beinhaltet die Agenten, die für die Unterstützung der spezifischen Anwendung notwendig sind. An dieser Stelle erfolgt der Einsatz des Contact and Channel Approaches (C&C²-A) als Möglichkeit zur systematischen Produktanalyse. Letztlich ist es die Aufgabe des Wissensingenieurs, ein Wissensmodell zu erarbeiten um den identifizierten Agenten das richtige Wissen zur Unterstützung der spezifischen Anwendung zuzuweisen. Das Wissensmodell wird durch semi-formale Wissensbeschreibungen in Form von Wissenskarten dargestellt, die in einen Zusammenhang gebracht und Agenten zugewiesen werden. Die Erarbeitung der drei Modelle befindet sich auf der informalen Wissensebene. Die Ergebnisse aus der Vorgehensweise werden dem Softwareingenieur zur formalen Entwicklung des proaktiven Konstruktionssystems übergeben, der auf der Symbolebene operiert. Die Anwendbarkeit und Nützlichkeit der Vorgehensweise konnte durch sechs Fachexperten bestätigt werden, wobei die Anwendbarkeit durch Untersuchungen mit Probanden zudem gesondert untersucht wurde. Eine Ergänzung fand durch die Evaluation des ProKon-Systems im industriellen Kontext statt, wobei acht Konstrukteure das ProKon-System testen konnten. Zur Entwicklung des Prototyps wurden zwei der drei Modelle erarbeitet und von einem Softwareingenieur umgesetzt. Die gesamte Evaluation ergab, dass 17 der 22 Anforderungen erfüllt wurden. Fünf Anforderungen wurden teilweise erfüllt. The ProKon project {{deals with}} the {{development}} of a multi-agent design system (MADS) as one form of knowledge based system, whereby the project served as a feasibility study. The basic functionality of the ProKon system comprises a consistency check of a product model in accordance with requirements, the function and Design for X-guidelines. If there are some inconsistencies, the ProKon system finds solutions and autonomously realises them into the product model. The ProKon system serves as a personal assistant to design engineers, whereby they get assisted and not overruled. The aim of the system is to increase the level of accordance with Design for X-guidelines. Besides that, the time for gathering, assessing and internalising knowledge and the time for improving and revising complex product models should decrease. Then, design engineers are able to concentrate more on the value-added activities. As a result, a core system has been developed which includes the basic functionality, the communication between the agents, the fundamentals of knowledge processing and the architecture. However, the core system is not aligned to a specific application and organisation. Therefore, it does not comprise neither application oriented agents nor organisational knowledge. But those are needed to really support design engineers. To align the core system to a specific application and organisation, the present work describes a model-based procedure. As foundations, the CommonKADS approach as well as the distinction between the knowledge level and the symbol level is used. Three models are intended: organisation model, agent model and knowledge model. They are located on the knowledge level without sparing a thought about computer aspects. First, the organisation model represents the ideal application within an organisation for the ProKon system. This application for the ProKon system is defined, inter alia, by an engineering design process in which the product is developed by changing geometrical dimensions and material configurations (variant design). Original designs and adaptive designs cannot be effectively supported by the ProKon system. Moreover, the engineering design process should be iterative and has to have different process owners with opposed goals. The product should not exceed a certain level of complexity and the organisation itself needs to be susceptible to methods in knowledge management. Within the organisation model, the approach of Hubka and Eder is used to figure out which success factors have to be considered in order to analyse organisations. By means of these success factors and subsequent criteria, knowledge engineers are empowered to identify the application in which the ProKon system can be used. Once a suitable application in an organisation has to be identified, the application specific agents have to be identified. This is done by carrying out a graphical product analysis by using the Contact and Channel Approach (C&C²-A). Knowledge engineers model the product by means of system boundaries, working surface pairs and channel structures in order to identify the force transmission. With an analogy, the needed object agents and specialist agents are identified and stored in the agent model. One specialist agent deals with one knowledge domain. Therefore, it has to be ensured that this agent can access formalised knowledge within this knowledge domain. In addition to specialist agents, knowledge for aspect agents has to be acquired. This is realised by five steps to achieve a knowledge model. The knowledge model finally stores knowledge on a semi-formal level by neglecting computer specific integration aspects. The specific outcomes of the knowledge model are ProKon-knowledge forms, knowledge distributions and knowledge-to-role structures. The knowledge engineer passes the models to software engineers. They operate on the symbol level and realise the ProKon system for an application. Both knowledge engineers and software engineers are the decisive roles in the development process of the ProKon system. Supporting roles are decision makers and leading design engineers. Within the ProKon project a fictive application has been developed. A gear shaft with spur wheels, bearings, sealings, <b>circlips</b> and one fitted key serves as the application scenario. Due {{to the fact that the}} ProKon project is publicly funded, the participation of industrial organisations is not common practice. The organisation model could not be used in this case. However, the agent model and the knowledge model were developed to build up the foundation of the prototype...|$|R
5000|$|The early {{engines that}} were {{produced}} before 1957 had a light alloy piston rod which is retained in its socket by a slotted steel retaining cup {{which in turn}} is held in place by a steel <b>circlip</b> located in a shallow groove in the interior piston wall. This arrangement (known as a three-piece piston) was abandoned as of 1957 in favour of a hardened steel rod which was swaged into a bearing cup formed integrally in the piston interior. The advantage of this latter set-up was that it simplified assembly and the bearing could be re-set to take up play using a suitable [...] "reset" [...] tool to re-swage the cup.|$|E
50|$|Universal joints let {{the shaft}} keep {{rotating}} while allowing for changes due to suspension movement, such as shaft length and horizontal angle, and shaft angle as the steering turns. Constant-velocity universal joints are normally used to transfer power smoothly between the components. The inner universal {{can be a}} plunge or tripod type joint. The tripod is splined to the intermediate shaft and held by a <b>circlip.</b> A ball, supported on needle roller bearings, is fitted to each post of the tripod, and these slide in a trunion inside the yoke. This caters for changes in shaft length and horizontal angle. The drive is transferred through the trunion and balls to rotate the shaft.|$|E
50|$|Blinders, {{also known}} as peepers, are devices fitted to, or through, the beaks of poultry to block their forward vision and assist in the control of feather pecking, {{cannibalism}} and sometimes egg-eating. A patent for the devices was filed as early as 1935.They are used primarily for game birds, pheasant and quail, but also for turkeys and laying hens. Blinders are opaque and prevent forward vision, unlike similar devices called spectacles which have transparent lenses. Blinders work by reducing the accuracy of pecking at the feathers or body of another bird, rather than spectacles which have coloured lenses and allow the bird to see forwards but alter the perceived colour, particularly of blood. Blinders are held in position with a <b>circlip</b> arrangement or lugs into the nares of the bird, or a pin which pierces through the nasal septum. They can be made of metal (aluminium), neoprene or plastic, and are often brightly coloured {{making it easy to}} identify birds which have lost the device. Some versions have a hole in the centre of each of the blinders, thereby allowing restricted forward vision.|$|E
5000|$|A Rzeppa joint (invented by Alfred H. Rzeppa in 1926) {{consists}} of a spherical inner shell with 6 grooves in it and a similar enveloping outer shell. Each groove guides one ball. The input shaft fits in the centre of a large, steel, star-shaped [...] "gear" [...] that nests inside a circular cage. The cage is spherical but with ends open, and it typically has six openings around the perimeter. This cage and gear fit into a grooved cup that has a splined and threaded shaft attached to it. Six large steel balls sit inside the cup grooves and fit into the cage openings, nestled in the grooves of the star gear. The output shaft on the cup then runs through the wheel bearing and is secured by the axle nut. This joint can accommodate the large changes of angle when the front wheels are turned by the steering system; typical Rzeppa joints allow 45°-48° of articulation, while some can give 54°. At the [...] "outboard" [...] end of the driveshaft a slightly different unit is used. The end of the driveshaft is splined and fits into the outer [...] "joint". It is typically {{held in place by}} a <b>circlip.</b>|$|E
30|$|<b>Circlip</b> grooves {{are made}} on the piston through {{subsystem}} K, a <b>circlip</b> grooving machine.|$|E
40|$|A failed {{collector}} pinion {{belonging to}} a helicopter {{was sent to the}} laboratory for analysis. Examination revealed chipping off of material at the <b>circlip</b> groove region. Fractographic study confirmed that the chipping off of material was by static overload. Metallurgical examination showed carburization of the entire collar of the <b>circlip</b> groove. Evidences suggest that there were localized contacts between the <b>circlip</b> face and the groove surface resulting in high loads at these contact points. Study shows that these localized contacts were due to inability of the hard carburized material to deform and make necessary adjustment for establishing contacts with the entire <b>circlip</b> face. It appears most probable that high notch sensitivity of the carburized material at the <b>circlip</b> groove in conjunction with the high localized load on the collar of the <b>circlip</b> groove was responsible for the failure. In view of this, it is recommended that suitable process modification be incorporated to avoid carburization in the <b>circlip</b> groove region...|$|E
30|$|From the {{comparative}} study of this paper, we have observed that the time-dependent availability of the system S 1 and system S 2 is affected by fixture seat machining (A) and <b>circlip</b> grooving (K), respectively. Therefore, {{it is recommended that}} management should pay more attention to fixture seat machining (A) and <b>circlip</b> grooving (K) in order to increase the time-dependent availability of the piston manufacturing plant. The conclusion drawn from the analysis is consistent with the actual performance of the manufacturing plant and will help the industry to improve its performance. The main advantage of this work is that we can examine the time-dependent analysis.|$|E
40|$|Fixtures are {{the work}} holding devices {{utilized}} in industries for manufacturing, inspection and assembly operations. This paper describes about designing an assembling fixture for mounting <b>circlip</b> to the groove {{provided in the}} piston pin hole. After careful study of assembly components, a few concepts of fixtures were designed. Among these concepts the best concept is developed by using concept scoring technique. The detail design of the selected concept is done by using 3 D software, Pro-E wildfire. Based on the detail design, 2 D draft drawings are generated and supplied for manufacturing of the fixture. The implementation of the fixture is able to assemble 2160 number of pistons with the <b>circlip</b> in a day...|$|E

30|$|Similarly, {{the repair}} rate {{fluctuations}} {{have been studied}} for the effect of maintenance on time-dependent availability {{in the case of}} system S 2 as well. We found that time-dependent availability of the system S 2 shows 0.5 % increase for <b>circlip</b> grooving with decrease in value of its repair rate parameter. In case of finish pin hole boring, the time-dependent availability of the system improved by 0.2 % when its repair rates decrease. The effect on time-dependent availability was found to be negligible in case of other subsystems and can be referred from Tables  8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13.|$|E
30|$|In {{the piston}} {{manufacturing}} plant, a {{gravity die casting}} process is {{carried out in the}} foundry to make the piston with the help of semiautomatic die machines without external pressures. The resultant pistons are sent for cleaning up the surface of the piston from the risers and runners and later, the strength, hardness, and other foundry defects are evaluated. Then a bunch of pistons is placed in the piston blank for its machining operations after which a fixture seat machine is used. Then, two rough grooves are made on the piston by using a carbide tool tip to fit a pin in them. Subsequently, another hole is drilled on the piston for oil passage and then finishing is given to the rough grooves using a diamond tool. Later, the piston is shaped into an oval to ensure its smooth movement within the cylinder using the carbide tool. In the next process, finish crown and cavity machines are used to put a rough cavity first and then a finish cavity on the piston. Further, valves are made on the piston using the diamond tool followed by a rounding-off operation on the corners of piston. Then, <b>circlip</b> grooves are made on the piston {{in the absence of any}} coolant and air pressure. After that, deburring, cleaning, and surface treatment operations are performed. Final inspections are carried out on the manufactured piston under some operational tests before packing.|$|E
30|$|Schilling (1994), {{has thrown}} {{light on the}} superiority of process control over the {{traditional}} sampling techniques. Locke (1994), stressed {{on the importance of}} process charts, cause and effect relationship and control charts. Lin (2004), had emphasized on process capability indices for normal distribution. Tong et al. (2004), focused on define–measure–analyze–improve–control (DMAIC) approach and its application for printed circuit board quality improvement. Li et al. (2008) adopted DMAIC approach to improve the capability of surface mount technology in solder printing process. Hwang (2006) employed the DMAIC procedure in context of application to manufacturing execution system. Gentili et al. (2006) applied the DMAIC process for a mechanical manufacturing process line, which manufactures both professional and simple kitchen knives. Sahay et al. (2011) used the DMAIC approach for analyzing the manufacturing lines of a brake lever at a Connecticut automotive component manufacturing company. Singh (2011) improved the process capability of polyjet printing for plastic components and charted the procedure for attaining the Cpk value attainment > 1.33, i.e., > 4 sigma level, which is considered as industrial benchmark. Lin et al. (2013) elaborated on the accurate yield assessment of the processes of multiple characteristics of the turbine blade manufacturing process. Kumaravadivel and Natarajan (2013) applied the cause and effect matrix and failure modes and effects analysis (FMEA) for solving problems associated with flywheel casting process. Mariajayaprakash et al. (2013) identified the CTQ characteristics of shock absorber manufacturing process and improved the process by minimizing the defects using Taguchi approach. Genetic algorithm was applied to optimize the parameters using Taguchi approach. Chen et al. (2013) applied Taguchi’s orthogonal array and analysis of variance (ANOVA) to find the optimal values for the nine process parameters namely, injection time, injection pressure, packing time, packing pressure, cooling time, cooling temperature, mold open time, melt temperature and mold temperature, in a plastic injection molding process. Lal et al. (2013) in their paper discussed about the performance of piston manufacturing plant through stochastic models. They concluded that the time-dependent availability of the piston manufacturing plant is affected by fixture seat machining and <b>circlip</b> grooving.|$|E
