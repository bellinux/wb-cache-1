A 30-metre-high rig (nicknamed the [...] "Grand Old Lady") {{made up of}} wooden derricks and <b>cable</b> <b>tool</b> <b>drilling</b> {{was used in the}} operation by Royal Dutch Shell. On 22 December 1910, oil was struck after 130 metres of drilling at the well. Royal Dutch Shell also founded a subsidiary company named Sarawak Oil Field Ltd, which now operated as Sarawak Shell Berhad. Since then, another 624 land wells have been drilled around Miri until 1972 which are collectively known as the [...] "Miri field". The Miri field is the only onshore field in Sarawak, because oil production has shifted offshore since the late 1950s. The first oil well on Canada Hill (Miri Well No. 1) produced a total of 0.65 million oil barrels for the next 60 years until its closure on 31 October 1972. The first oil refinery and submarine pipeline was built in Miri in 1914. The oil refinery has since been relocated to Lutong (11km to the north of Miri) in 1916.|$|E

5000|$|Reuben Carlton [...] "Carl" [...] Baker, Sr. (July 18, 1872 - September 29, 1957) was an American oil {{industry}} drilling pioneer. He established {{the forerunner of}} Baker International (ultimately Baker Hughes) in 1907 after developing a casing shoe that revolutionized <b>cable</b> <b>tool</b> <b>drilling.</b> In 1903, he introduced the offset bit for <b>cable</b> <b>tool</b> <b>drilling</b> to enable casing wells in hard rock and in 1912 the cement retainer that allowed casing to be cemented in the wells. Baker further improved the process with the float shoe in 1923. He is credited with obtaining more than 150 new or improved patents on oil drilling tools.|$|E
5000|$|Drilled wells are {{typically}} created using either top-head rotary style, table rotary, or <b>cable</b> <b>tool</b> <b>drilling</b> machines, {{all of which}} use drilling stems that are turned to create a cutting action in the formation, hence the term drilling.|$|E
50|$|<b>Cable</b> <b>tool</b> <b>drilling</b> was {{developed}} in ancient China and was used for drilling brine wells. The salt domes also held natural gas, which some wells produced and which was used for evaporation of the brine. Chinese well drilling technology was introduced to Europe in 1828.|$|E
50|$|Canada's pole-tool rig used rods or poles linked together, with a {{drilling}} bit {{fixed to the}} end of this primitive drilling “string.” Black-ash rods were the norm in early Petrolia. Iron rods came later. Like the <b>cable</b> <b>tool</b> system, pole-tool <b>drilling</b> used the weight of the drill string pounding into the ground from a wooden derrick to make hole.|$|R
50|$|They used {{a variety}} of unusual noise-making objects, {{including}} power <b>tools,</b> <b>drills,</b> and heavy machinery.|$|R
50|$|The {{earliest}} {{oil wells}} {{in modern times}} were drilled percussively, by repeatedly raising and dropping a <b>cable</b> <b>tool</b> into the earth. In the 20th century, <b>cable</b> <b>tools</b> were largely replaced with rotary drilling, which could drill boreholes to much greater depths and in less time. The record-depth Kola Borehole used non-rotary mud motor drilling to achieve a depth of over 12000 m.|$|R
5000|$|Although {{there were}} many efforts in the mid-19th century to drill for oil Edwin Drake's 1859 well near Titusville, Pennsylvania, is {{considered}} the first [...] "modern oil well". Drake's well touched off a major boom in oil production in the United States. [...] Drake learned of <b>cable</b> <b>tool</b> <b>drilling</b> from Chinese laborers in the U. S. [...] The first primary product was kerosene for lamps and heaters. Similar developments around Baku fed the European market.|$|E
50|$|Cable tool rigs are {{simpler and}} cheaper than {{similarly}} sized rotary rigs, although loud and very slow to operate. The world record cable tool well was drilled in New York {{to a depth}} of almost 12,000 ft. The common Bucyrus-Erie 22 can drill down to about 1,100 ft. Since <b>cable</b> <b>tool</b> <b>drilling</b> does not use air to eject the drilling chips like a rotary, instead using a cable strung bailer, technically there is no limitation on depth.|$|E
5000|$|The {{mechanical}} {{success of}} <b>cable</b> <b>tool</b> <b>drilling</b> has greatly depended on a device called jars, invented by a spring pole driller, William Morris, {{in the salt}} well days of the 1830s. Little is known about Morris except for his invention and that he listed Kanawha County (now in West Virginia) as his address. Morris received [...] for this unique tool in 1841 for artesian well drilling. Later, using jars, the cable tool system was able to efficiently {{meet the demands of}} drilling wells for oil.|$|E

5000|$|The oldest form of {{drilling}} machinery is the cable tool, still used today. Specifically designed {{to raise and}} lower a bit into the bore hole, the spudding of the drill causes the bit to be raised and dropped onto {{the bottom of the}} hole, and the design of the cable causes the bit to twist at approximately [...] revolution per drop, thereby creating a drilling action. Unlike rotary drilling, <b>cable</b> <b>tool</b> <b>drilling</b> requires the drilling action to be stopped so that the bore hole can be bailed or emptied of drilled cuttings.|$|E
5000|$|The {{well was}} financed by Charles B. Shaffer of Chicago, who hired Slick to drill wells at the Frank Wheeler farm using <b>cable</b> <b>tool</b> <b>drilling</b> techniques, {{which could not}} prevent gushers or blowouts. Three {{unsuccessful}} wells preceded the strike, which initially produced 400 barrels of high-grade oil a day from a depth of between 2319 ft and 2347 ft. Because no mechanism existed to control the flow, the oil was diverted into pits for collection and storage. The source of the oil was a sand zone in the Drumright Dome, a syncline. Slick attempted to keep the strike secret, hiring armed guards, [...] but eventually revealed the well's success in April 1912. A dugout built for the guards remains on the site, together with a commemorative plaque.|$|E
50|$|Baker International {{was formed}} by Reuben C. Baker, who {{developed}} a Casing shoe, that revolutionized <b>cable</b> <b>tool</b> <b>drilling.</b> In July 1907, R.C. Baker, a 34-year-old inventor and entrepreneur in Coalinga, California, was granted a U.S. patent for a casing shoe that enabled drillers to efficiently run casing and cement it in oil wells. This innovation launched the business that would become Baker Oil Tools and Baker Hughes Incorporated. Mr. Baker {{had arrived in the}} California oilfield in 1895 with 95 cents in his pocket and dreams of making his fortune in the Los Angeles oil boom. Subsequently, he hauled oil for drillers with a team of horses and became a drilling contractor and an oil wildcatter before achieving success as an innovator in oilfield equipment. In 1928, Baker Casing Shoe Company changed its name to Baker Oil Tools, Inc., to reflect its product line of completion, cementing and fishing equipment.|$|E

50|$|Drilled wells {{are usually}} cased with a factory-made pipe, {{typically}} steel (in air rotary or <b>cable</b> <b>tool</b> <b>drilling)</b> or plastic/PVC (in mud rotary wells, {{also present in}} wells drilled into solid rock). The casing is constructed by welding, either chemically or thermally, segments of casing together. If the casing is installed during the drilling, most drills will drive the casing into the ground as the bore hole advances, while some newer machines will actually allow for the casing to be rotated and drilled into the formation {{in a similar manner}} as the bit advancing just below. PVC or plastic is typically welded and then lowered into the drilled well, vertically stacked with their ends nested and either glued or splined together. The sections of casing are usually 6 m or more in length, and 6 to 12 in in diameter, depending on the intended use of the well and local groundwater conditions.|$|E
