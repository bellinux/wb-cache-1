30|$|Orthokeratology is a {{controversial}} technique for correcting myopia. It {{has been in}} use since the 1960 s. It uses contact lenses which are worn to flatten the cornea, reducing its refractive power. These lenses were originally made from polymethyl methacrylate, but are now made of rigid gas-permeable materials. Once the cornea reaches the desired shape, maintenance lenses are used overnight. The user can then see during the day {{without the need for}} corrective glasses or contact lenses. There are significant complications associated with orthokeratology, including corneal abscess, <b>corneal</b> epithelial <b>oedema,</b> <b>corneal</b> abrasions or staining, keratoconus, corneal thinning, corneal scarring, corneal warpage and induced astigmatism [2]. Damage to the corneal epithelium increases the risk of corneal infection. This damage is likely to be greatest at the central cornea, due to the relative curvature of the cornea and the lenses. Therefore, infections often occur centrally and have a severe effect on the patient's vision. The use of overnight lenses is also a risk factor for corneal infection [3]. This may be because of the higher temperature under the closed lid and the absence of blinking and tearing at night [4]. Due to the high risk of severe complications, the use of these lenses is very controversial.|$|R

Granulomatous keratic precipitates (KPs) delineated the involved endothelial area, and some deep stromal peripheral vessels were found. A corneal conus shape was also noticed. Javal’s keratometric readings were OD 40.00 / 46.25 [*]×[*] 10 ° and OS 44.00 / 45.00 [*]×[*] 5 °, he showed decreased corneal sensitivity, {{and there was}} no anterior chamber or vitreous inflammation. Prednisolone acetate was started again and his VA improved slightly to 20 / 200. Both the stromal and endothelial opacities diminished and so the corticosteroids were tapered during the next 2  months.|$|R

40|$|Dr Maggioni and {{associates}} have reported an interesting case of intermittent angle-closure glaucoma masquerading as retinal migraine (1). However, there are points {{with which we}} cannot concur. First, the most common manifestation of intermittent angle-closure glaucoma is not headache but rather visual disturbance (2). Classical visual disturbance is not mere blurring of vision. It is highly characteristic and described by patients as ‘seeing halos around lights’, which actually represents diffuse <b>corneal</b> epithelial <b>oedema</b> due to elevated intraocular pressure (2). A careful history taking with specific questioning on this unique symptom may sometimes help achieve an early diagnosis and proper ophthalmic referral. Second, the authors mention presentations of acute angle closure glaucoma, which they believe should include mydiasis (2). This is astonishing. It is well known to every ophthalmologist that pupil block and iris bombe are the essential elements for acute attack of angle closure glaucoma (3). Clinically, these will be reflected as a non-reactive 3 – 4 -mm pupil in ‘mid-dilated position’ with maximal irislenticular touch and pupil-blocking force (4). Physiologically speaking, this is completely different from the mydriatic pupil, which is devoid of pupilblocking force...|$|R
40|$|Aims: To {{study the}} long term toxic effects of intraocular {{benzalkonium}} chloride (BAC). Methods: 19 patients exposed to intraocular BAC preserved viscoelastic during cataract surgery in February 1999 developed severe striate keratopathy immediately postoperatively. 16 patients, including two who underwent penetrating keratoplasty, were studied in the period April to June 2000. Ocular symptoms, visual acuity, biomicroscopy, intraocular pressure, dilated funduscopy, specular endothelial microscopy, and corneal pachymetry findings were recorded. The corneal and iris specimens of the two patients who underwent keratoplasty were studied by light, transmission, and scanning electron microscopy. Results: Six males and 10 females, aged 64 – 98 years, were studied 14 – 16 months postoperatively. All patients were symptomatic. 12 patients had best corrected visual acuity of 6 / 12 or better and four patients of between 6 / 18 and 6 / 60. Five patients had <b>corneal</b> epithelial <b>oedema</b> and 11 had Descemet's membrane folds. The central corneal thickness, 620 (SD 71) µm, in affected eyes was significantly higher (p< 0. 005, two tailed paired t test) {{than that of the}} contralateral eyes, 563 (SD 48) µm. The endothelial cell density was significantly lower (p< 0. 0001, two tailed paired t test) in affected eyes: 830 (SD 280) cells/mm 2 v 2017 (SD 446) cells/mm 2. The mean average cell area was significantly higher in the BAC treated eyes: 1317 (SD 385) µm 2 v 521 (SD 132) µm 2. There {{was no significant difference in}} the coefficient of variation of cell size between the two eyes (p= 0. 3, two tailed paired t test). Two corneal specimens displayed morphological features of bullous keratopathy and other non-specific abnormalities. Extracellular melanosomes were present in a portion of the iris of one case. Conclusion: BAC is toxic to the corneal endothelium when used intraocularly, leading to severe striate keratopathy. This cleared in most cases but left varying degrees of residual stromal thickening in all eyes. If penetrating keratoplasty is required the results are excellent...|$|R
40|$|AbstractPurposePrimary {{pterygium}} is a fibrovascular proliferation {{over the}} nasal cornea, probably {{resulting from the}} limbal stem cell deficiency. Intraoperative mitomycin-C application seems to associate with reduced recurrences, however produced ocular surface problems and vision threatening complications. The present clinical study investigated the safety profile of autologous limbal conjunctival transplantation in terms of recurrence rate, as the main outcome measure and complications as the secondary outcome. MethodsThe present study was randomised, interventional and prospective clinical study conducted from a tertiary Hospital. Pterygium excision was performed with limbal conjunctival autograft availed from the affected eye. Secondary pterygia resulting from inflammation, trauma and other diseases were excluded. Patients were followed up for 18 months for recurrence and other complications. Microsoft Office Excel 2007 was used for statistical analysis. ResultsA total of 71 eyes of sixty-eight patients with primary pterygia included between November 2007 and October 2010. The study recruited 35 (51 %) males and 33 (49 %) females with mean age of 36. 9 with ± 12. 82 years standard deviation (mean, SD) ranging from 19 to 75 years. Age grouped by range intervals categorised into six groups. Pterygium was diagnosed in 32 (45 %) right eyes and 39 (55 %) left eyes. There were 65 (91. 55 %) nasal and 4 (5. 63 %) temporal pterygium and no case of double head pterygia found. Average horizontal extension of the pterygium measured was 1. 67 mm (± 4. 23) from the apex to the <b>corneal</b> limbus. Graft <b>oedema</b> in 1 (0. 71 %) patient, graft bleed in 2 (1. 42 %) cases and 1 (0. 72 %) case of granuloma observed. No recurrences encountered during 18 months follow up. ConclusionsPterygium occurred predominantly in the younger population group 36. 9 mm (± 12. 82) {{probably due to the}} increased outdoor activity with high exposure to sunlight and dusty atmosphere. Absence of recurrences was probably attributable to the smaller pterygium size of 1. 67 mm (± 4. 23), use of the autologous limbal conjunctival graft and treatable intra and post operative complications successfully...|$|R

Aim: To compare the frequency of <b>corneal</b> <b>oedema</b> in two age-matched groups of diabetics and non diabetic patients that underwent cataract surgery in the Ophthalmology Department of Xanthi General Hospital in Greece. Methods: A retrospective case control study was conducted in a retrospective fashion. Patients in the control and study groups were assessed regarding the severity of <b>corneal</b> <b>oedema</b> at three postoperative visits: days 1, 3 – 7, 10 – 14 after the operation.

40|$|SUMMARY Two {{cases of}} severe <b>corneal</b> <b>oedema</b> {{occurred}} after {{the use of}} intraocular pilocarpine. Experimental investigations were conducted with cultured bovine corneal endothelial cells exposed for 5 minutes to 1 % pilocarpine solutions of varying composition. Cells were destroyed in solutions not isotonic with aqueous humour, and calcium-free ionic solutions caused loss of cell adhesion without loss of viability. Low pH or the presence of 1 % pilocarpine had no detectable effects; 1 % acetylcholine chloride in 5 % mannitol (Miochol) also caused cell destruction, and this preparation {{was found to be}} considerably hypertonic. The minimum requirements for the formulation of intraocular miotics are discussed. <b>Corneal</b> <b>oedema</b> after operation for cataract is usually an iatrogenic disorder caused by mechanical and chemical injury to the endothelium of the cornea.

40|$|Previous {{studies have}} {{demonstrated}} that the prostaglandin-inhibitor naproxen can reduce post-surgical <b>corneal</b> <b>oedema,</b> which is largely due to an inflammatory process. To determine whether there is an inflammatory component in the oedematous response of the cornea to contact lens wear, we conducted a randomized, double-masked, placebo-controlled study on the effect of naproxen on contact lens-induced corneal swelling. This drug did not have a significant effect, suggesting that prostaglandins are not involved in the hypoxic oedema response. The discrepancy between the effect of naproxen on lens- and surgically-induced <b>corneal</b> <b>oedema</b> {{can be attributed to the}} different aetiologies of these oedema responses...|$|E

40|$|Background <b>Corneal</b> <b>oedema</b> is {{a common}} {{post-operative}} problem that delays or prevents visual recovery from ocular surgery. Honey is a supersaturated solution of sugars with an acidic pH, high osmolarity and low water content. These characteristics inhibit the growth of micro-organisms, reduce oedema and promote epithelialisation. This clinical case series describes {{the use of a}} regulatory approved Leptospermum species honey ophthalmic product, in the management of post-operative <b>corneal</b> <b>oedema</b> and bullous keratopathy. Methods A retrospective review of 18 consecutive cases (30 eyes) with <b>corneal</b> <b>oedema</b> persisting beyond one month after single or multiple ocular surgical procedures (phacoemulsification cataract surgery and additional procedures) treated with Optimel Antibacterial Manuka Eye Drops twice to three times daily as an adjunctive therapy to conventional topical management with corticosteroid, aqueous suppressants, hypertonic sodium chloride five per cent, eyelid hygiene and artificial tears. Visual acuity and central corneal thickness were measured before and at the conclusion of Optimel treatment. Results A temporary reduction in corneal epithelial oedema lasting up to several hours was observed after the initial Optimel instillation and was associated with a reduction in central corneal thickness, resolution of epithelial microcysts, collapse of epithelial bullae, improved corneal clarity, improved visualisation of the intraocular structures and improved visual acuity. Additionally, with chronic use, reduction in punctate epitheliopathy, reduction in central corneal thickness and improvement in visual acuity were achieved. Temporary stinging after Optimel instillation was experienced. No adverse infectious or inflammatory events occurred during treatment with Optimel. Conclusions Optimel was a safe and effective adjunctive therapeutic strategy in the management of persistent post-operative <b>corneal</b> <b>oedema</b> and warrants further investigation in clinical trials...|$|E

40|$|AIMS—To {{report the}} {{appearances}} of cornea guttata and Fuchs' endothelial dystrophy from white light confocal microscopy.  METHODS—Seven eyes of four consecutive patients with cornea guttata were prospectively examined. Of the seven eyes, three also had <b>corneal</b> <b>oedema</b> (Fuchs' dystrophy). In vivo white light tandem scanning confocal microscopy {{was performed in}} all eyes. Results were compared with non-contact specular microscopy.  RESULTS—Specular microscopy was precluded by <b>corneal</b> <b>oedema</b> in one eye. In the remaining six eyes, it demonstrated typical changes including pleomorphism, polymegathism, {{and the presence of}} guttae appearing as dark bodies, some with a central bright reflex. In all seven eyes, confocal microscopy revealed the presence of round hyporeflective images with an occasional central highlight {{at the level of the}} endothelium. Changes in cell morphology and size were readily appreciated.  CONCLUSION—By comparison with specular microscopy, the hyporeflective images with an occasional central highlight seen on confocal microscopy are consistent with the presence of guttae. Confocal microscopy may confirm the diagnosis of cornea guttata and Fuchs' endothelial dystrophy by demonstrating the presence of guttae. This technique is especially valuable in cases of <b>corneal</b> <b>oedema,</b> where specular microscopy may fail to visualise the endothelium. However, specular microscopy should remain the method of choice to evaluate the endothelium, principally because it is easier to use.    Keywords: confocal microscopy; cornea guttata; Fuchs' dystroph...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND OCT is an {{attractive}} modality for imaging the eye, because it can image both the anterior segment (cornea, angle, crystalline lens) and the posterior segment (retina) of the eye. OCT provides the cross-sectional retinal image in vivo. OCT has high image resolution (1 - 15 μm) 1 and is capable of scanning a large area (up to 20 mm scan diameter). It perfectly fits the eye’s size. Our study included patients suffering from various corneal pathologies who underwent routine ophthalmic checkup followed by OCT. A detailed quantitative cross-sectional imaging of the cornea was obtained {{with regards to the}} localisation, size, shape, depth, texture and surface of corneal ulcer and infiltrates, extent of <b>corneal</b> <b>oedema,</b> depth of corneal opacity, surface and texture of graft-host junction in patients who underwent penetrating keratoplasty. The study was done to find out whether OCT could be valuable in the diagnosis and prognosis of corneal disorders keeping in mind the various studies conducted so far. The aim of the study is to study the diagnostic and prognostic role of OCT in various corneal pathology. MATERIALS AND METHODS Study included 85 patients (males and females) visiting a tertiary healthcare centre with corneal pathologies diagnosed on slitlamp biomicroscopy following which OCT was done over 2 years period (February 2014 to February 2016). Design- Observational, cross-sectional, non-comparative study. RESULTS Corneal thickness is increased in <b>corneal</b> <b>oedema</b> (average 616 microns), while it is reduced in corneal ulcer (average 519 microns) and post keratoplasty patients (average 516 microns). The corneal thickness was normal in corneal degenerations (535 microns) and corneal opacity (545 microns). Texture was abnormal in 24 out of the 25 patients with <b>corneal</b> <b>oedema.</b> The corneal texture was abnormal in all 20 patients of corneal opacity and 18 out of 20 patients with corneal ulcer. All 5 patients post penetrating keratoplasty showed abnormal texture. Only 3 out of 15 patients with corneal degeneration showed abnormal texture. Depth assessment- Out of 20 patients with corneal ulcer, 12 were stromal and 8 were epithelial. Corneal surface was irregular in all 20 patients with corneal ulcer and 16 out of 20 cases of corneal opacity. In 8 patients of <b>corneal</b> <b>oedema</b> with bullous keratopathy, the corneal surface was irregular. CONCLUSION OCT provides objective documentation of corneal pathologies that cannot be provided by routine slit-lamp examination. Thus, OCT definitely plays an important role as far as the diagnosis and prognosis is concerned...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES [...] To {{assess the}} acute and chronic {{ophthalmological}} effects of triethylamine exposure among foundry workers. METHODS [...] Ocular effects on people currently, previously, and never exposed to triethylamine in a foundry cold box were studied at two points in time. The initial phase included an ocular examination with a slit lamp to assess corneal health, a visual acuity test, and a questionnaire to assess vision symptoms. The follow up included measurements of corneal thickness with an ultrasonic pachymeter and the vision symptoms questionnaire {{before and after}} the shift and {{at the beginning and end}} of the week. Personal air measurements for triethylamine were also obtained during the follow up. RESULTS [...] The vision symptoms of blurriness, halos around lights, and blue hazy vision occurred more often in currently exposed workers than those previously or never exposed to triethylamine. Air concentrations of triethylamine ranged from 10 mg/m 3 of triethylamine (odds ratio (OR) = 3. 0, 95 % confidence interval (95 % CI) 0. 35 - 25. 6). No differences in corneal thickness were found in currently or previously exposed workers and those never exposed. No increase in corneal thickness was found after v before the shift. CONCLUSION [...] Despite low concentrations of triethylamine and no <b>corneal</b> <b>oedema,</b> workers exposed to triethylamine reported vision symptoms. Possible explanations for these symptoms without <b>corneal</b> <b>oedema</b> are that triethylamine affects ciliary muscle function or that the <b>corneal</b> <b>oedema</b> was transient and not present when corneal thickness measurements were taken. No chronic effects were found in previously exposed workers.
