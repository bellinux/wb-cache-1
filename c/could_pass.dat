5|$|A central {{pledge of}} President Bill Clinton's {{campaign}} was {{to reform the}} welfare system, adding changes such as work requirements for recipients. However, by 1994, the Clinton Administration appeared to be more concerned with pursuing a universal health care program. Gingrich accused Clinton of stalling on welfare, and proclaimed that Congress <b>could</b> <b>pass</b> a welfare reform bill {{in as little as}} 90 days. He insisted that the Republican Party would continue to apply political pressure to the President to approve their welfare legislation.|$|E
5|$|In 1884 the French {{microbiologist}} Charles Chamberland {{invented a}} filter, {{known today as}} the Chamberland filter or Chamberland–Pasteur filter, that has pores smaller than bacteria. Thus he <b>could</b> <b>pass</b> a solution containing bacteria through the filter and completely remove them from the solution. In the early 1890s the Russian biologist Dmitri Ivanovsky used this filter to study {{what became known as}} the tobacco mosaic virus. His experiments showed that extracts from the crushed leaves of infected tobacco plants remain infectious after filtration.|$|E
5|$|Laws {{were made}} for British India by a Legislative Council under the Viceroy having wide powers of legislation. This Council <b>could</b> <b>pass</b> laws as {{important}} as any Acts by the British Parliament. The Legislative Council was made of six members besides the Viceroy. In addition, the governors served as extraordinary members when the Legislative Council met in their provinces. They also had an Executive Council of {{two members of the}} Indian Civil Service for 12years standing, appointed by the Crown.|$|E

5|$|Some pugs {{are also}} born with {{stenotic}} nares {{which can also}} inhibit their breathing. In serious cases, the pinched nostrils make breathing even more difficult for this breed and put added pressure on the larynx. In some cases, the dog <b>could</b> <b>pass</b> out from blocked airways. If this happens, one should inquire with their veterinarian whether or not surgery is needed to modify the breathing passages.|$|E
5|$|The Plebeian Council (concilium plebis) was the {{principal}} popular gathering of the Roman Republic. As the name suggests, the Plebeian Council was organized as a Council, and not as an Assembly. It functioned as a gathering through which the Plebeians (commoners) <b>could</b> <b>pass</b> laws, elect magistrates, and try judicial cases. This council had no political power until the offices of Plebeian Tribune and Plebeian Aedile were created in 494 BC, due to the Plebeian Secession that year.|$|E
5|$|A 19th-century ethnographic account {{from eastern}} Herzegovina {{describes}} a way through {{which a man}} who was not born as a zduhać could become one. Forty days after he ceased praying to God and washing his face, the man should go to some level ground, before he drew a circle on the ground and sat in its centre. Soon the Devil would come and ask the man whether he was willing to join his army, and what form he wanted to be transformed into. When the man stated the desired form, the Devil would turn him into that, making him a zduhać. In the region of Semberija, northeast Bosnia, а zduhać <b>could</b> <b>pass</b> his supernatural power on to his son.|$|E

5|$|It {{is often}} claimed {{that at the}} time, the pass of Thermopylae {{consisted}} of a track along {{the shore of the}} Malian Gulf so narrow that only one chariot <b>could</b> <b>pass</b> through at a time. In fact, as noted below, the pass was 100 metres wide, probably wider than the Greeks could have held against the Persian hordes. Herodotus reports that the Phocians had improved the defenses of the pass by channelling the stream from the hot springs to create a marsh, and it was a causeway across this marsh which was only wide enough for a single chariot to traverse. In a later passage, describing a Gaulish attempt to force the pass, Herodotus describes how the Gauls who fell into the marsh disappeared and were drowned.|$|E
5|$|Lochner's {{major works}} include three large polyptychs: the Dombild Altarpiece; the Last Judgement, which is broken apart {{and in several}} collections; and Nuremberg's Crucifixion. Only two {{attributed}} paintings are dated; the 1445 Nativity now in the Alte Pinakothek, Munich, and the Presentation in the Temple from 1447, now in Darmstadt. There is a smaller, earlier version of the presentation scene at the Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation, Lisbon, dated 1445. As secular works grew in demand and religious works became unfashionable in later centuries, 15th-century polyptychs were often broken up and sold as individual works, especially if a panel or section contained an image that <b>could</b> <b>pass</b> as a secular portrait.|$|E
5|$|Lorian, after {{considering}} {{his knowledge of}} events, believes that the wormhole must be avoided altogether. Archer and Lorian then disagree over whether to implement an engine modification to Enterprise, since there is a 22% chance it may cause {{the destruction of the}} ship. Archer then meets with old T'Pol on board old Enterprise, and considers a plan where his ship <b>could</b> <b>pass</b> through it safely, due to alternate modifications suggested by her. A frustrated Lorian then reveals a secret plan: to steal the newer plasma injectors from Enterprise to allow them to confront the Xindi in the place of their ancestors.|$|E

5|$|New Zealand {{units were}} to be capped in number and {{were to be}} {{allocated}} to participants either by grandparenting (gifting) or auctioning. Sectors of the economy were to have progressively entered the NZ ETS, with forestry the first from January 2008 and agriculture last in January 2013. Allocation rules varied between sectors. In general, participants who <b>could</b> <b>pass</b> on costs of the ETS, such as fuel companies, would not be allocated free units. Participants such as exporters with products that are priced internationally, would be allocated free units.|$|E
5|$|The canal was a centre for boatbuilding between 1858, when Richard Dunston {{moved his}} yard to Thorne from Torksey, and 1984 when the yard closed. Dunston's company were pioneers {{in the use}} of welded {{construction}} and innovative tug propulsion systems. The operation was always restricted by the size of Keadby Lock, although vessels longer than the lock <b>could</b> <b>pass</b> through when the river was level with the canal and both sets of gates could be opened. The largest ship to be built required Dunston's to build a dam across the canal, as the canal company feared that it might get stuck in the lock, resulting in flooding and draining of the canal.|$|E
5|$|UNITA forces {{attacked}} Camabatela in Cuanza Norte province on 8 February 1986. ANGOP alleged UNITA massacred {{civilians in}} Damba in Uíge Province later that month, on 26 February. The South African government agreed to Crocker's terms in principle on 8 March. Savimbi proposed a truce regarding the Benguela railway on 26 March, saying MPLA trains <b>could</b> <b>pass</b> through {{as long as}} an international inspection group monitored trains to prevent their use for counter-insurgency activity. The government did not respond. In April 1987, Fidel Castro sent Cuba's Fiftieth Brigade to southern Angola, {{increasing the number of}} Cuban troops from 12,000 to 15,000. The MPLA and American governments began negotiating in June 1987.|$|E

5|$|Under Section 8, the Secretary of State <b>could</b> <b>pass</b> a {{statutory}} instrument {{setting out}} {{the rules and}} limits surrounding compensation for the employee's dismissal after making a protected disclosure; until this is done, Section 9 provided interim remedies, which {{were the same as}} in other cases of unfair dismissal. The Secretary of State did pass such an instrument, the Public Interest Disclosure (Compensation) Regulations 1999, but Section 8 has now been repealed under Section 44 of the Employment Relations Act 1999. Under Section 10, the Act applies to crown servants, excepting under Section 11, those who are employees of MI5, MI6 or GCHQ. The Act does exclude, in Sections 12 and 13, serving police officers and those employed outside the United Kingdom.|$|E
5|$|A Greek {{force of}} {{approximately}} 7,000 men marched north {{to block the}} pass {{in the middle of}} 480 BC. The Persian army, alleged by the ancient sources to have numbered over one million, but today considered to have been much smaller (various figures are given by scholars, ranging between about 100,000 and 150,000), arrived at the pass in late August or early September. The vastly outnumbered Greeks held off the Persians for seven days (including three of battle) before the rear-guard was annihilated in one of history's most famous last stands. During two full days of battle, the small force led by Leonidas blocked the only road by which the massive Persian army <b>could</b> <b>pass.</b> After the second day, a local resident named Ephialtes betrayed the Greeks by revealing that a small path led behind the Greek lines. Leonidas, aware that his force was being outflanked, dismissed the bulk of the Greek army and remained to guard their retreat with 300 Spartans, 700 Thespians, and 400 Thebans, fighting to the death.|$|E
5|$|A {{ceremony}} of dedication {{was held on}} the afternoon of October 28, 1886. President Grover Cleveland, the former New York governor, presided over the event. On the morning of the dedication, a parade was held in New York City; {{estimates of the number of}} people who watched it ranged from several hundred thousand to a million. President Cleveland headed the procession, then stood in the reviewing stand to see bands and marchers from across America. General Stone was the grand marshal of the parade. The route began at Madison Square, once the venue for the arm, and proceeded to the Battery at the southern tip of Manhattan by way of Fifth Avenue and Broadway, with a slight detour so the parade <b>could</b> <b>pass</b> in front of the World building on Park Row. As the parade passed the New York Stock Exchange, traders threw ticker tape from the windows, beginning the New York tradition of the ticker-tape parade.|$|E

5|$|Although Captain Apolinar Calvo of the Corregidor {{had prior}} {{experience}} navigating the mined entrance to Manila Bay (the mines {{had been in}} place since July), the Navy had changed its procedures on that day. Rather than post a gunboat near the safe channel as they had in days previous, lighted buoys were used to guide boats through. As the Corregidor sailed close to the island of Corregidor {{to pass through the}} channel at around 01:00, the ship was observed turning toward the electrically-controlled minefield. Some officers posted at the Army's Seaward Defense Command headquarters on the island recommended that the mines be temporarily disarmed so that the ship <b>could</b> <b>pass</b> through the minefield. A number of accounts state that Seaward Defense Commander Colonel Paul Bunker ordered that the mines be kept active.|$|E
5|$|During one leg of {{the return}} trip, the men were stopped by the Hukbalahap, Filipino Communist guerrillas who hated both the Americans and the Japanese. They were also rivals to Pajota's men. One of Pajota's lieutenants conferred with the Hukbalahap and {{returned}} to tell Mucci {{that they were not}} allowed to pass through the village. Angered by the message, Mucci sent the lieutenant back to insist that pursuing Japanese forces would be coming. The lieutenant came back and told Mucci that only Americans <b>could</b> <b>pass,</b> and Pajota's men had to stay. Both the Rangers and guerrillas were finally allowed through after an agitated Mucci told the lieutenant that he would call in an artillery barrage and level the whole village. In fact, Mucci's radio was not working at that point.|$|E
5|$|Freda's {{ambition}} {{to make a}} horror film derived from his desire to make films in the fantastique style, feeling that only the Americans and German expressionists {{were able to make}} such films in the past. Freda approached film producer Luigi Carpentieri with the idea of the film despite not having a treatment ready. Promising them that he would have something for them by the next day, he returned with a tape of his treatment that was complete with sound effects. Carpentieri phoned Goffredo Lombardo to convince him further. Freda followed up his tape with the promise that his script <b>could</b> <b>pass</b> the censors and could be filmed in 12 days. This convinced the producer who allowed Freda to create what became I Vampiri. I Vampiri was a low-budget production with Donati and Capentieri of Athena and Lombardo's Titanus investing 32 million lire each initially into the film. The initial budget was 97 million Italian lire which increased to 142 million for its post-production and release after the films format was switched to panoramic CinemaScope.|$|E
