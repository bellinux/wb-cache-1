50|$|The {{timing was}} fortuitous: With the {{automobile}} gaining popularity, William Hoover {{was concerned about}} the market for his horse <b>collars</b> and <b>harnesses,</b> and was eager to diversify.

There is a need to assess the work outputs of different harnesses as there are currently no technical data on the efficiency of the various harnessing and hitching systems.

40|$|Harness in Antiquity: The Prestige of Scientific Error. The work of Commander Lefebvre des Noettes and {{particular}} his hypothesis of the defectiveness of ancient harnesses, was very influential {{even though his}} analysis was technically false. After having situated the commander- a local erudite who took advantage of his early retirement to specialize {{in an area that}} had been little explored up until that time- in historical context, this article takes up the refutations that began in 1960 and became especially forceful due to the work of J. Spruytte in 1977. There was not one, but rather several ancient harnesses and the evolution towards modern techniques (shafts, <b>collars,</b> and breast <b>harnesses)</b> began in Antiquity. The commander's theories were accepted for so long and their refutation so little recognized in France because they reinforced the idea of "antiquity's technical block". The paper investi gates the birth of this concept and the reasons why it encountered so much success in France. The evolution of different historical schools giving special place to ancient history allows us to better understand why people pondered the causes of "technical block" without throwing the concept itself into question. It is as if ancient history had to have particular status and could not be considered part of the long procession of history. Amouretti Marie-Claire. L'attelage dans l'Antiquité.

40|$|Animal-borne logging or {{telemetry}} {{devices are}} widely used for measurements of physiological and movement data from free-living animals. For such measurements to be relevant, however, {{it is essential that}} the devices themselves do not affect the data of interest. A recent meta-analysis reported an overall negative effect of these devices on the birds that bear them, i. e. on nesting productivity, clutch size, nest initiation date, offspring quality, body condition, flying ability, foraging behaviours, energy expenditure and survival rate. Method of attachment (<b>harness,</b> <b>collar,</b> glue, anchor, implant, breast-mounted or tailmount) had no influence on the strength of these effects but anchored and implanted transmitters had the highest reported rates of device-induced mortality. Furthermore, external devices, but not internal devices, caused an increase in ‘device-induced behaviour’ (comfort behaviours such as preening, fluffing and stretching, and unrest activities including unquantifiable ‘active’ behaviours). These findings suggest that, with the exception of device-induced behaviour, external attachment is preferable to implantation. In the present study we undertake a meta-analysis of 183 estimates of device impact from 39 studies of 36 species of bird designed to explicitly compare the effects of externally attached and surgically implanted devices on a range of traits, including condition, energy expenditure and reproduction. In contrast to a previous study, we demonstrate that externally attached devices have a consistent detrimental effect (i. e. negative influences on body condition, reproduction, metabolism and survival), whereas implanted devices have no consistent effect. We also show that the magnitude of the negative effect of externally attached devices decreases with time. We therefore conclude that device implantation is preferable to external attachment, providing that the risk of mortality associated with the anaesthesia and surgery required for implantation can be mitigated. We recommend that studies employing external devices use devices that can be borne for long periods, and, wherever possible, deploy devices in advance of the time period of interest. Craig R.
