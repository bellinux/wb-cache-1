50|$|Introduced in 1967, BRUIN was the Army's first area {{trunk network}} mounted in both wheeled and tracked vehicles, which {{connected}} formation headquarters and units using multi-channel UHF radios. BRUIN provided a partially secure and automatic {{system for the}} transmission of both voice and teleprinter traffic. It was the primary trunk communications system of the British Army of the Rhine from 1967 to 1982. During {{the years of the}} Cold War Royal Signals units in 1st British Corps trained with BRUIN, and deployed their equipment and vehicles among the woods and farms of northern West Germany, putting their skills to the test in an annual cycle of <b>command</b> <b>and</b> <b>signal</b> exercises.|$|E

With {{the entry of}} the Susa Battalion into the reactivated 3rd Alpini Regiment on 23 October 1993 the reorganization of the brigade was for the time completed.

50|$|During the 1990s the brigades {{structure}} fluctuated wildly as the Italian Army drew {{down its}} forces {{at the end}} of the Cold War. On 5 November 1990 the 11th Infantry (Training) Battalion Casale in Casale Monferrato joined the brigade, followed on 1 June 1991 by a medical battalion from the disbanded Goito Mechanized Brigade. On 1 July 1991 101st Tank Battalion joined the Garibaldi Bersaglieri Brigade and transferred to Persano in the south of Italy. In the following year the 1st Tank Battalion was renamed 31st Tank Regiment without changing the actual size or composition of the unit, similarly the 9th Self-propelled Field Artillery Group became the 131st Self-propelled Field Artillery Regiment. The Anti-tank company was disbanded and the Sapper company merged into the <b>Command</b> <b>and</b> <b>Signal</b> Battalion.|$|E

5000|$|After {{the end of}} the Cold War in 1989 the Italian Army {{had begun}} a massive down-sizing and the brigade soon changed {{composition}} repeatedly. On 1 December 1989 the 22nd Motorized Infantry Battalion Primaro was disbanded. On 1 November 1990 the brigade received the 4th Infantry (Training) Battalion Guastalla, which was disbanded and replaced by the 26th Infantry (Training) Battalion Bergamo on 30 April 1991. On 12 September of the same year the 1st Armoured Group Nizza Cavalleria left the brigade to become a corps level asset of the 3rd Army Corps. With the disbandment of many mechanized brigades the Cremona received surplus materiel to become a mechanized brigade: the infantry battalions received VCC-2 armoured personnel carriers, while the 7th Adria was equipped with M109 self-propelled howitzers. Accordingly the brigade changed its name to Cremona Mechanized Brigade. At the same time the brigades battalions returned to be named regiments for traditional reasons. In 1992 the Anti-tank Company was disbanded and the Engineer Company merged into the <b>Command</b> <b>and</b> <b>Signal</b> Battalion, which was renamed as Cremona Command and Tactical Support Battalion.

5000|$|With {{the end of}} the Cold War the Italian Army {{began to}} draw down its forces and it ordered the battalions to be called again regiments for {{traditional}} reasons.

The same year the 6th Tank Battalion was renamed as 4th Tank Regiment and on 9 October the regiment was transferred to Bellinzago Novarese were it joined the Legnano Mechanized Brigade. On 21 December 1995 the 13th Self-propelled Field Artillery Group was replaced by the 7th Self-propelled Field Artillery Group Cremona, which had come from the Cremona Motorized Brigade. However already on 15 May 1996 the 33rd Self-propelled Field Artillery Group Acqui joined the brigade when the Army decided to disband the Acqui Motorized Brigade and the 7th Self-propelled Field Artillery Group Cremona was transferred to Armys Artillery Command to become a NBC-defence unit. At the same time the 8th Cavalry Regiment Lancieri di Montebello entered the brigade and the 3rd Granatieri Regiment left the brigade.

The full functionality (wireless radio-frequency power, <b>command</b> <b>and</b> <b>signal</b> transmission) and the ability of the electrodes to record artificial neural signals even after 276 days of PBS soaking with little change (within 14 %) in signal/noise amplitude constitute a major milestone in long term stability and allow us to study and {{evaluate the}} encapsulation reliability, functional stability and its potential usefulness for a wireless neural interface for future chronic implants...|$|E
