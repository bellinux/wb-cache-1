40|$|In {{the field}} <b>of</b> <b>translation</b> studies, {{there is an}} {{emerging}} {{awareness of the need}} to obtain evidence for the quality of tests used to measure translation competence. To date, translation tests have been informed by practice rather than by empirical research and questions regarding the reliability of the assessment methods have remained unanswered. According to a recently developed method (Anckaert et al. 2006; Eyckmans et al. 2009) translation performance indicators can be related to the underlying translation competence in a psychometrically controlled way. This norm-referenced method is said {{to bridge the gap between}} language testing theory and the epistemological characteristics <b>of</b> <b>translation</b> studies by selecting text segments with discriminating power through a process of pre-testing and item calibration. The dissemination of this method ties in with the European call for test standardisation in the sense that it allows a reliable and valid <b>certification</b> <b>of</b> <b>translation</b> competence across Europe. It also permits an exploration of text robustness so that tests can be validated for different language combinations. In our paper we will report an experiment in which three methods for assessing translation competence are compared. The pros and cons of the different methods will be discussed. The central research question centers on the reliability and the validity of these methods with reference to each other and homes in on the quintessential issue of text independent measurement <b>of</b> <b>translation</b> competence. The results of the experiment clearly indicate that collaboration between translation teachers and test developers is indispensable if we want to rise to the methodological challenge of achieving equivalent standards across languages...|$|R
40|$|In {{the field}} <b>of</b> <b>Translation</b> Studies, {{there is an}} {{emerging}} {{awareness of the need}} to obtain evidence for the quality of tests used to measure translation competence. To date, translation tests have been informed by practice rather than by empirical research and questions regarding the reliability of the assessment methods have remained largely unanswered (Anckaert et al. 2008). Fortunately, researchers from the field <b>of</b> <b>Translation</b> Studies (Waddington 2001) as well as applied linguists (Eyckmans et al. 2009) are now taking up issues such as inter- and intra-rater reliability <b>of</b> <b>translation</b> assessment, and the construct validity <b>of</b> <b>translation</b> tests. Gradually the methodology of educational measurement together with the insights of language testing theory are being transferred to the field <b>of</b> <b>translation</b> studies in order to arrive at valid and reliable ways to measure translation competence. In this chapter we will argue for a collaboration between translation trainers and test developers in order to develop and disseminate methods that allow reliable and valid <b>certification</b> <b>of</b> <b>translation</b> competence across Europe so that equivalent standards can be achieved across languages. Such transnational collaboration will allow an exploration of test robustness so that tests can be validated for different language combinations and language-specific domains. European cooperation is also desirable because the construction of a reliable battery <b>of</b> <b>translation</b> tests is a time-consuming and demanding process – as {{it has been in the}} domain of language testing – which will require sufficiently large populations of test takers in order to safeguard item stability. In our chapter we will discuss the current state <b>of</b> affairs in <b>translation</b> assessment practice. We will also comment on the introduction of the European Norm for translation service requirements (CEN, 2006) which is an example of European collaboration in the sense that it is the result of a comparison of good practices in 28 countries, but which clearly prioritizes service quality over product quality. We will advocate the transfer of the EALTA guidelines for language assessment to translation assessment because this will contribute to what we would like to call translation assessment literacy by bridging the gap between language testing theory and the specific epistemological characteristics <b>of</b> <b>Translation</b> Studies. The feasibility of establishing a Common Framework <b>of</b> Reference for <b>Translation</b> Competence will be discussed in light of the definition of the construct <b>of</b> <b>translation</b> competence...|$|R
