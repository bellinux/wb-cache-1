40|$|BACKGROUND: Cannabis is {{a widely}} used drug {{associated}} with increased risk for psychosis. The dopamine hypothesis of psychosis postulates that altered salience processing leads to psychosis. We therefore tested the hypothesis that cannabis users exhibit aberrant salience and explored the relationship between aberrant salience and dopamine synthesis capacity. METHODS: We tested 17 cannabis users and 17 age- and sex-matched non-user controls using the Salience Attribution Test (SAT), a probabilistic reward-learning task. Within users, cannabis-induced psychotic symptoms were measured with the Psychotomimetic States Inventory (PSI). Dopamine synthesis <b>capacity,</b> <b>indexed</b> as the influx rate constant Kicer, was measured in 10 users and 6 controls with 3, 4 -dihydroxy- 6 -[18 F]-fluoro-l-phenylalanine positron emission tomography. RESULTS: There {{was no significant difference}} in aberrant salience between the groups (F 1, 32 = 1. 12, p=. 30 [implicit]; F 1, 32 = 1. 09, p=. 30 [explicit]). Within users there was a significant positive relationship between cannabis-induced psychotic symptom severity and explicit aberrant salience scores (r=. 61, p=. 04) and there was a significant association between cannabis dependency/abuse status and high implicit aberrant salience scores (F 1, 15 = 5. 8, p=. 03). Within controls, implicit aberrant salience was inversely correlated with whole striatal dopamine synthesis capacity (r=-. 91, p=. 01), whereas this relationship was non-significant within users (difference between correlations: Z=- 2. 05, p=. 04). CONCLUSIONS: Aberrant salience is positively associated with cannabis-induced psychotic symptom severity, but is not seen in cannabis users overall. This is consistent with the hypothesis that the link between cannabis use and psychosis involves alterations in salience processing. Longitudinal studies are needed to determine whether these cognitive abnormalities are pre-existing or caused by long-term cannabis use...|$|E

The phosphate capacity has {{a close relationship with}} the phosphate <b>capacity</b> <b>index,</b> whereas the logarithm of phosphate capacity is 12. 724 greater than that of phosphate <b>capacity</b> <b>index</b> at 1873 K (1600 degrees C). The developed phosphate capacity prediction model can be also used to predict the phosphate <b>capacity</b> <b>index</b> with reliable accuracy compared with the measured and the predicted phosphate <b>capacity</b> <b>index</b> of the slags by other models in literatures. The results from the IMCT phosphate capacity prediction model show that the comprehensive effects of iron oxides and basic components control the dephosphorization reaction with an optimal ratio of (pct FeO) /(pct Fe 2 O 3) as 0. 62. The determined contribution ratio of FetO, CaO+ FetO, MgO+ FetO, and MnO + FetO to the phosphate capacity or phosphate <b>capacity</b> <b>index</b> of the slags is approximately 0. 0 pct, 99. 996 pct, 0. 0 pct, and 0. 0 pct, respectively. The generated 2 CaO center dot P 2 O 5, 3 CaO center dot P 2 O 5, and 4 CaO center dot P 2 O 5 as products of dephosphorization reactions accounts for 0. 016 pct, 96. 01 pct, and 3. 97 pct of the phosphate capacity or phosphate <b>capacity</b> <b>index</b> of the slags, respectively...|$|R

Additionally, forearm strength (maximal volitional contraction MVC), endurance (force–time integral FTI at 40 % MVC), and forearm volume (FAV and ΔFAV) was assessed. MVC was significantly greater in boulderers compared to lead climbers (mean difference[*]=[*] 9. 6, 95 % CI 5. 2 – 14  kg). FDP and EDC oxidative <b>capacity</b> <b>indexes</b> were significantly greater (p[*]=[*]. 041 and. 013, respectively) in lead climbers and boulderers compared to controls (mean difference[*]=[*]− 1. 166, 95 % CI (− 3. 264 to 0. 931  s) and mean difference[*]=[*]− 1. 120, 95 % CI (− 3. 316 to 1. 075  s), respectively) with no differences between climbing disciplines.

Additionally, multiple regression suggested that the combined significant aerobic predictors accounted for 67 % of the variance in red-point climbing ability.

40|$|Over {{the years}} "S-shaped" {{evolutions}} have regularly been incorporated in economic models, and indeed in {{those of other}} sciences, {{by way of the}} logistic or Gompertz equations. However, both equations have noteworthy shortcomings when fitting some empirical features of economic growth: the logistic equation is characterized by strong symmetries, whilst the growth rate is decreasing in the case of both equations. In this paper, we have set out to overcome these limitations by defining a family of unimodal differential equations which includes the logistic and Gompertz equations and covers practically the whole spectrum of sigmoid curves. We have identified three sub-families of these differential equations, all offering good mathematical expressions. Using these, it is possible to obtain an acceptable fit for any S-shaped curve. The results are applied to various economic series, successfully replicating certain well-known economic phenomena. Mathematical analysis: Unimodal differential equations. Empirical analysis: Non-linear adjustment to the USA <b>Capacity</b> <b>Index</b> time series. We have defined a family of unimodal differential equations covering practically the whole spectrum of "S-shaped" curves. We have selected three sub-families mathematically manageable and which depend on five easily interpretable parameters. It is shown that any one of them may adequately replicate empirically relevant S-shaped phenomena (overcoming certain limitations of the logistic and Gompertz curves).
