Prepared mixes are used by some doughnut shops. Doughnut shops may prepare old-fashioned doughnuts by loading the batter into the hopper of a doughnut maker, which upon turning a hand crank, drops a formed doughnut into a deep fryer. Doughnut makers are also used for other doughnut varieties, such as cake doughnuts, yeast doughnuts, cream filled, and jelly filled doughnuts.|$|E

25|$|Although {{the winds}} {{often have a}} {{destructive}} nature, they have some benefits as well. They cause <b>cold</b> <b>water</b> <b>to</b> rise from below the surface layer of the ocean, bringing with it many nutrients that ultimately benefit local fisheries. As the winds blow over the ocean, sea surface temperatures drop about 4°C (7°F), indicating the upwelling. Chlorophyll concentrations in the surface water go from negligible, {{in the absence of}} winds, to very active at more than 1.5 milligrams per cubic meter {{in the presence of the}} winds.|$|E

25|$|Gibraltar's first tunnels were {{constructed}} by {{hand in a}} slow, backbreaking but remarkably long-lasting method of excavation. The first task was to fragment the limestone rock. This was done by {{using a variety of}} methods, including gunpowder blasting, fire setting (building a fire against the face of the rock to heat it, then quenching it with <b>cold</b> <b>water</b> <b>to</b> cause it to shatter), quicklime (used to fill boreholes which were then slaked with water, causing it to expand and so shattering the surrounding rock) and hammering in wooden wedges which were expanded by soaking them with water, again causing the rock to shatter. The fragments were then removed with crowbars and sledgehammers.|$|E
25|$|Pool {{designs for}} canine {{hydrotherapy}} vary, but most have generic elements. The pool {{tends to be}} smaller than a human swimming pool and is heated. (This is unlike equine hydrotherapy pools. Horses generate a lot of body heat when swimming, so equine pools use <b>cold</b> <b>water</b> <b>to</b> prevent the animal overheating.) A dog's muscles benefit from the warming effects of the heated water. Most pools have a ramp for entry and exit and some have harnesses to maintain the dog in position in the water. There may be a manual or electric hoist for lifting dogs {{in and out of}} the water. Water is chlorinated or treated with an alternative chemical. Some have jets to add resistance and make the dog swim more strongly.|$|E
500|$|Many {{species of}} {{freshwater}} and saltwater {{plants and animals}} are dependent on glacier-fed waters to ensure the cold water habitat {{to which they have}} adapted. Some species of freshwater fish need <b>cold</b> <b>water</b> <b>to</b> survive and to reproduce, and this is especially true with salmon and cutthroat trout. Reduced glacial runoff can lead to insufficient stream flow to allow these species to thrive. [...] Alterations to the ocean currents, due to increased freshwater inputs from glacier melt, and the potential alterations to thermohaline circulation of the World Ocean, may affect existing fisheries upon which humans depend as well.|$|E

500|$|Recommended steps by {{individuals}} {{to reduce the}} blood lead levels of children include increasing their frequency of hand washing and their intake of calcium and iron, discouraging them from putting their hands to their mouths, vacuuming frequently, and eliminating the presence of lead-containing objects such as blinds and jewellery in the house. In houses with lead pipes or plumbing solder, these can be replaced. Less permanent but cheaper methods include running water {{in the morning to}} flush out the most contaminated water, or adjusting the water's chemistry to prevent corrosion of pipes. Lead testing kits are commercially available for detecting the presence of lead in the household. As hot water is more likely than <b>cold</b> <b>water</b> <b>to</b> contain higher amounts of lead, use only cold water from the tap for drinking, cooking, and for making baby formula. [...] Since most of the lead in household water usually comes from plumbing in the house and not from the local water supply, using cold water can avoid lead exposure. Measures such as dust control and household education {{do not appear to be}} effective in changing children's blood levels.|$|E
500|$|A {{significant}} {{feature of}} the Genesis planet are the alien worms that rapidly evolve from microbes on Spock's coffin. The creatures start as small, slimy crawlers, then grow to lengths of [...] The small worms were created by injecting molten [...] "Hot-Melt" [...] vinyl into epoxy polymer molds that were immediately put into <b>cold</b> <b>water</b> <b>to</b> create a translucent product. The resulting hundred or so creatures were painted and coated with methacyl, a slippery, slimy coating. Each worm was attached to an elevated platform by a piece of fishing line; the lines were tied to rods underneath the set. Offscreen helpers pushed the rods or pulled fishing line to create motion; the scene required many takes because the fishing line would periodically flash at the camera. The larger worms proved more problematic, with filming taking place at ILM and Paramount Stage15. Similar to The Wrath of Khans parasitic Ceti eels, the worms featured cobra-like cowls and a ringed mouth of teeth. ILM built one of the worms with more articulation than the others; Ralston operated the creature {{through a hole in}} the set floor with his hand stuck inside the creature. The other worms were animated using pneumatic bladders that caused air to pass through hoses in sequence, creating an undulating motion. During the scene the worms attack Kruge, who kills one of them. The usual method for achieving the effect of the creature wrapping itself around Kruge would have been to film the sequence in reverse, but this posed problems: the slime coating Kruge would have been out of place with reverse filming, and multiple takes would ruin the Klingon makeup Lloyd wore. ILM's solution involved rigging the worm with fishing lines that were pulled in a choreographed fashion by multiple off-screen helpers to simulate the wrapping movement. When small pieces of the Klingon uniforms caught or snapped the fishing lines, Ralston resorted to steel cables.|$|E

40|$|Following {{the passage}} of {{hurricane}} Betsy (1965) through the Gulf of Mexico two flights were made five days apart aboard a research aircraft to collect sea-surface temperatures with an infrared radiometer.

Data from the first flight, which occurred one to two days after the hurricane passage, showed two cores of <b>colder</b> <b>water</b> <b>to</b> the right of the storm’s track and very little structure to the left.

2500|$|Hot {{water can}} cause painful, {{dangerous}} scalding injuries, especially {{in children and}} the elderly. Water at the outlet should not exceed 49 degrees Celsius.
