5|$|The Structure and Distribution of Coral Reefs, Being {{the first}} part of the geology of the voyage of the Beagle, under the command of Capt. Fitzroy, R.N. during the years 1832 to 1836, was {{published}} in 1842 as Charles Darwin's first monograph, and set out his theory of the formation of coral reefs and atolls. He conceived of the idea during the voyage of the Beagle while still in South America, before he had seen a <b>coral</b> <b>island,</b> and wrote it out as HMS Beagle crossed the Pacific Ocean, completing his draft by November 1835. At the time there was great scientific interest in the way that coral reefs formed, and Captain Robert FitzRoy's orders from the Admiralty included the investigation of an atoll as an important scientific aim of the voyage. FitzRoy chose to survey the Keeling Islands in the Indian Ocean. The results supported Darwin's theory that the various types of coral reefs and atolls could be explained by uplift and subsidence of vast areas of the Earth's crust under the oceans.|$|E

25|$|In 1971, after a tragedy, the Marine Spa was {{demolished}} to {{make way}} for the ill-fated <b>Coral</b> <b>Island</b> leisure complex. This was characterised by its concrete arches on its uppermost floor and sunbathing decks like those of a cruise liner. The site featured a hexagonal outdoor plunge pool surrounded by sunbathing terraces leading down to Beacon Cove beach. Inside the building were several lounges, a restaurant and a nightclub within the arches of the ancient swimming bath. All levels were served by a hydraulic passenger lift. <b>Coral</b> <b>Island</b> opened in 1977 and closed in 1988. The complex was demolished in 1997, 20 years after its construction. The site remained derelict until 2002 when the Living Coasts coastal zoo was built there.|$|E

25|$|While a few {{offshore}} anchorage {{spots are}} marked on maps, Jarvis island has no ports or harbors, and swift currents are a hazard. There is a boat landing {{area in the}} middle of the western shoreline near a crumbling day beacon, and another near the southwest corner of the island. The center of Jarvis island is a dried lagoon where deep guano deposits accumulated, which were mined for about 20 years during the nineteenth century. The island has a tropical desert climate, with high daytime temperatures, constant wind, and strong sun. Nights, however, are quite cool. The ground is mostly sandy and reaches 23 feet (7 meters) at its highest point. Because of the island's distance from other large landmasses, the Jarvis Island high point is the 36th most isolated peak in the world. The low-lying <b>coral</b> <b>island</b> has long been noted as hard to sight from small ships and is surrounded by a narrow fringing reef.|$|E

25|$|The main {{impact in}} Tonga {{was in the}} {{northern}} part of the island kingdom where there were deaths, injuries and extensive damage on Niuatoputapu, a flat <b>coral</b> <b>island</b> 500km north of the main island Tongatapu, and reportedly closest to the epicentre of the earthquake. The death toll on the island has risen to nine. A Tongan government spokesman Alfred Soakai said 90% of homes had been destroyed as well as serious damage to the hospital. An adviser to the prime minister, Lopeti Senituli, later said the amount of damage to buildings has been downgraded to 60%. There are three main villages on Niuatoputapu: Hihifo and Falehau, which were hit by three waves, some 6m high, and the village of Vaipoa, which received less damage. A new school building remained standing and provided some shelter. The island is isolated with a population of around 1,000 people. Approximately 192 families were left homeless and the homes of 143 additional families were damaged in the tsunami in the villages of Hihifo, Falehau and Vaipoa. 289 families lived in residences which escaped damage in the disaster.|$|E
25|$|Most of {{the western}} coast of the Red Sea was then {{formally}} claimed by the Khedivate of Egypt (under the notional rule of the Ottoman Turkish Empire, who held the eastern coast) but the region was thrown into chaos by major Egyptian defeats in the Ethio-Egyptian War and {{by the success of}} the Mahdi's uprising in the Sudan. In 1884, the British HewettTreaty promised the Bogos—the highlands of modern Eritrea—and free access to the Massawan coast to Emperor Yohannes IV in exchange for his help evacuating garrisons from the Sudan; In the vacuum left by the Egyptian withdrawal, though, British diplomats were concerned about the rapid expansion of French Somaliland, France's colony along the Gulf of Tadjoura. Ignoring their treaty with Ethiopia, they openly encouraged Italy to expand north into Massawa, which was taken without a shot from its Egyptian garrison. Located on a <b>coral</b> <b>island</b> surrounded by lucrative pearl-fishing grounds, the superior port was fortified and made the capital of the Italian governor. Assab, meanwhile, continued to find service as a coaling station. As they were not a party to the Hewett Treaty, the Italians began restricting access to arms shipments and imposing customs duties on Ethiopian goods immediately.|$|E
500|$|The <b>Coral</b> <b>Island</b> was {{an almost}} instant success, and was {{translated}} into almost every European language within fifty years of its publication. It was widely admired by its contemporary readers, although modern critics view the text as featuring [...] "dated colonialist themes and arguably racist undertones". Ballantyne's blend of blood-thirsty adventure and pious imperialism appealed not just to his target juvenile audience but also to their parents and teachers. He is today mainly remembered for The <b>Coral</b> <b>Island,</b> {{to the exclusion of}} much of his other work.|$|E

500|$|William Golding's 1954 novel Lord of the Flies {{was written}} as a {{counterpoint}} to (or even a parody of) The <b>Coral</b> <b>Island,</b> and Golding makes explicit references to it. At {{the end of}} the novel, for instance, one of the naval officers who rescues the children mentions the book, commenting on the hunt for one of their number, Ralph, as a [...] "jolly good show. Like the Coral Island". Jack also makes an appearance in Lord of the Flies as Jack Merridew, representing the irrational nature of the boys. Indeed, Golding's three central characters– Ralph, Piggy and Jack– are caricatures of Ballantyne's heroes. Despite having enjoyed The <b>Coral</b> <b>Island</b> many times as a child, Golding strongly disagreed with the views that it espoused, and in contrast Lord of the Flies depicts the English boys as savages themselves, who forget more than they learn, unlike Ballantyne's boys. Golding described {{the relationship between the two}} books by saying that The <b>Coral</b> <b>Island</b> [...] "rotted to compost" [...] in his mind, and in the compost [...] "a new myth put down roots". Neither is the idyllic nature of Ballantyne's <b>coral</b> <b>island</b> to be found on Stevenson's treasure island, which is unsuitable for settlement [...] "but exists merely as a site from which to excavate treasure, a view consistent with the late-Victorian imperial mission" [...] according to Honaker.|$|E
500|$|Ballantyne {{never visited}} the coral {{islands of the}} South Pacific, relying instead on the {{accounts}} of others that were then beginning to emerge in Britain, which he exaggerated for theatrical effect by including [...] "plenty of gore and violence meant to titillate his juvenile readership". His ignorance of the South Pacific caused him to erroneously describe coconuts as being soft and easily opened; a stickler for accuracy he resolved that in future, whenever possible, he would write only about things he had personal experience of. Ballantyne wrote The <b>Coral</b> <b>Island</b> while staying in {{a house on the}} Burntisland seafront opposite Edinburgh on the Firth of Forth in Fife. According to Ballantyne biographer Eric Quayle he borrowed extensively from an 1852 novel by the American author James F. Bowman, The Island Home. He also borrowed from John Williams' Narrative of Missionary Enterprises (1837), to the extent that cultural historian Rod Edmond has suggested that Ballantyne must have written one chapter of The <b>Coral</b> <b>Island</b> with Williams' book open in front of him, so similar is the text. Edmond describes the novel as [...] "a fruit cocktail of other writing about the Pacific", adding that [...] "by modern standards Ballantyne's plagiarism in The <b>Coral</b> <b>Island</b> is startling".|$|E
500|$|Robert Louis Stevenson's 1882 novel Treasure Island {{was in part}} {{inspired}} by The <b>Coral</b> <b>Island,</b> which he admired for its [...] "better qualities", as was J. M. Barrie's character Peter Pan; both Stevenson and Barrie had been [...] "fervent boy readers" [...] of the novel. Novelist G. A. Henty was also influenced by Ballantyne's audience-friendly method of didactism.|$|E
