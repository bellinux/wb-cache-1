Bellevue Shopping Square (now known as Bellevue Square) opened in 1946 in Bellevue, Washington, a suburb of Seattle. Town & Country Village also opened in 1946 in Sacramento, California. Then came the Broadway-Crenshaw Center (known today as the Baldwin Hills Crenshaw Plaza), which was dedicated, in the Crenshaw district of Los Angeles on November 10, 1947 as the first major shopping mall on the West Coast. Three more suburban shopping centers were completed in 1949.

25|$|Severe and non-severe {{thunderstorms}} peak {{in frequency}} from June through August but can occur at any time. Thunderstorms form from daytime convective heating and frontal activity; in the south, lake breeze convergences also intensify storms. Another severe type of thunderstorm {{is known as}} a Mesocyclonic Convective Complex or Derecho, which is a larger <b>cluster-type</b> thunderstorm mass with a more or less circular shape, often with a pronounced bow shape at its front or leading edge. During periods of hot weather in summer, they often develop in the afternoon west of the Great Lakes then strike Southern and Central Ontario at night with great forward motion, bringing severe straight-line winds over wide areas resulting in damage to forests, power interruption and infrastructure damage. The areas with the highest severe weather frequency in the province are Southwestern (Windsor, Chatham, Stratford corridor) and Central Ontario (Simcoe County including the city of Barrie, Lake Simcoe and the Kawartha Lakes region), both areas often getting amplified storms resulting from the Lake Breeze Front convergence. London has the most lightning strikes per year in Canada, averaging 34 days of thunderstorm activity per year. In a typical year, Ontario averages 15 confirmed tornado touchdowns, but this number has recently been increasing. These tornadoes, however, are rarely destructive (the vast majority are classified as F0 or F1 on the Fujita scale). In Northern Ontario, some tornadoes go undetected by ground spotters because of the sparse population and remote landscape; they are often discovered after the fact by aircraft pilots, where aerial observations of damaged forest confirm occurrences. All of Northern Ontario north of a line from Lake Nipigon to Timmins has no weather radar coverage by Environment Canada making it difficult to detect tornadoes in far northern Ontario when they occur. Tropical depression remnants can cause copious rains and winds in the south, but are rarely deadly. A notable exception was Hurricane Hazel in October 1954.|$|E

However, what is not well understood is whether and how the average economic status at the community level {{plays a role in}} the poverty–health relationship. The {{purpose of this study is}} to investigate the concentration of poverty at the community level in Tanzania and its association with the availability and quality of primary health care services, the utilization of services, and health outcomes among household categories defined by wealth scores. A principal component method has been applied to rank households separately by urban/rural location using reported levels of asset ownership and living conditions. The household wealth scores were also used to classify communities into three <b>cluster-types</b> based on the proportion of households belonging to the poorest wealth tercile. On average, all the wealth terciles living in low poverty concentration areas were found to have better health outcomes and service utilization rates than their counterparts living in high poverty concentration clusters. Consistent with the finding is that high poverty concentration areas were further away from facilities offering primary health care than low poverty concentration areas. Moreover, the facilities closest to the high poverty concentration areas had fewer doctors, medical equipment and drugs.

40|$|Dendritic spines {{have two}} major {{structural}} elements: postsynaptic densities (PSDs) and actin cytoskeletons. PSD proteins are proposed to regulate spine morphogenesis. However, other molecular mechanisms should govern spine morphogenesis, because {{the initiation of}} spine morphogenesis precedes the synaptic clustering of these proteins. Here, we show that synaptic clustering of drebrin, an actinbinding protein highly enriched in dendritic spines, governs spine morphogenesis. We immunocytochemically analyzed developing hippocampal neurons of low-density cultures. Filopodia-like dendritic protrusions were classified into two types: diffuse-type filopodia, which have diffuse distribution of drebrin, and <b>cluster-type</b> filopodia, which have drebrin clusters with filamentous actin (F-actin). Most <b>cluster-type</b> filopodia were synaptic filopodia. Postsynaptic drebrin clusters were found in both most synaptic filopodia and spines. Postsynaptic PSD- 95 clusters, however, were found in only one-half of synaptic filopodia but in most spines. These data indicate that <b>cluster-type</b> filopodia are not mature spines but their precursors. Suppression of the upregulation of drebrin adult isoform (drebrin A) by antisense oligonucleotides against it attenuated synaptic clustering of PSD- 95, as well as clustering of drebrin and F-actin. Furthermore, the restoration of drebrin A expression by injection of the expression vectors of drebrin A tagged with green fluorescent protein into the neurons treated with the antisense oligonucleotides induced synaptic reclustering of PSD- 95 on clusters of the labeled drebrin A. These data indicated that the synaptic clustering of drebrin is necessary for that of PSD- 95 in developing neurons.

40|$|Legacy mobile backhauls {{are based}} on Time Division Multiplexing. Due to the current {{evolving}} of mobile traffic, a major change to a packet-based network is seen as inevitable. This means that the TDM signal cannot be used as source of synchronization anymore. The packet-layer based approach of the IEEE 1588 v 2 protocol has experienced a successful diffusion, while the physical-layer based solution of Synchronous Ethernet is still under development. A new packet-based synchronization technique is presented along this thesis. It is based on applying the OpMiGua HPTS scheme over a mobile backhaul that is structured into a <b>cluster-type</b> topology. The proposed technique has been given the name of IEEE 1588 v 2 HPTS scheme. It consists of exchanging timestamps according to the synchronization algorithm standardized into the IEEE 1588 v 2 protocol but exploiting the switching capabilities of the OpMiGua HPTS node. Differently from the IEEE 1588 v 2 protocol, our scheme foresees the timestamps to be preprended to the train of time-slots traveling throughout each ring (i. e. the fundamental element of the <b>cluster-type</b> network topology). The presence of time-slots {{is due to the}} adoption of the OpMiGua HPTS scheme. Thanks to the hybrid switching capabilities of the OpMiGua HPTS node, it is assured a fixed end-to-end delay to the timestamps. Work done consists of proposing a structure for the OpMiGua HPTS node, allowing to forward and duplicate for processing the timestamps in the same time, and the format of all the messages foreseen into the new scheme. A header format is presented as well as the framing for the messages containing the timestamps. This is applied over the <b>cluster-type</b> topology since the latter is identified as a more suitable physical layer configuration compared to the tree structure of legacy backhauls. The proposed technique is able to improve the accuracy achievable, since the timestamps are made independent from the traffic load into the nodes. Also a saving in terms of bandwidth consumption is provided...|$|E
40|$|For {{the first}} time a {{secondary}} ion mass spectrum of diethyl ether was obtained at low temperature. The spectrum recording became possible by carefully selecting the range of experimental conditions for the production of a <b>cluster-type</b> spectrum. This range is specified by the threshold for spectrum appearance above the melting temperature of the frozen sample and a fairly short time span of existence of the liquid estimated as only a few minutes. The latter necessitates rather rapid spectrum detection. In practice, about 1 min was available for recording of the <b>cluster-type</b> spectra. The secondary emission mass spectrum of diethyl ether appeared to be rich in peaks: along with abundant protonated clusters M-n.

40|$|The {{development}} of a system for immunoassays using highly sensitive high-Tc superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDs) and magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) is described in this thesis. High-Tc SQUIDs were fabricated using pulsed laser deposition and photolithography. The sensors are planar YBa 2 Cu 3 O(7 -δ) (YBCO) dc SQUID gradiometers developed for operation inside a glass fibre liquid nitrogen cryostat operating at 68 - 80 K. The gradiometers, with baselines of 3 mm and 4 mm, were fabricated on SrTiO 3 (STO) bicrystal substrates. The flux noise of the best performing SQUID was 4. 6 μФ 0 /√Hz and the voltage modulation 40 μV. The extremely high magnetic field resolution of SQUIDs was used in combination with MNPs for sensitive detection of biomolecules. Two different measurement modalities were used: AC-susceptometry (ACS) and magnetorelaxometry (MRX) for frequency- and time-domain measurements, respectively. ACS provides high resolution information about the size distribution of the MNP-system and the fast MRX enables studies of the reaction kinetics {{as a function of}} time. The MNPs used were multi-core particles containing single domains of magnetic material. Two different types of MNPs were used: cobalt-ferrite (CoFe 2 O 4) and magnetite (Fe 3 O 4). The detection limit of the present setup at the noise floor of our SQUIDs was estimated to be 50 ng of MNPs, corresponding to roughly 10 ^ 8 MNPs (of CoFe 2 O 4) with diameter of 100 nm. The feasibility of the present system for biomolecule detection using prostate-specific antibodies/antigens is shown in this thesis. Two different assay protocols were investigated: a <b>cluster-type</b> assay and a one-step assay. The <b>cluster-type</b> assay requires more complicated preparations but the sensitivity is higher. The one-step assay is simple and fast but less sensitive. The extrapolated biomolecule sensitivity is 18 ng/ml (or about 4 x 10 ^ 10 molecules) using the <b>cluster-type</b> assay and 10 μg/ml (roughly 10 ^ 12 molecules) using the faster one-step protocol.
