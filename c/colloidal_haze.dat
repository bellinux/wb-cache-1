40|$|The {{contribution}} of wheat and wheat protein fractions {{to the desired}} permanent <b>colloidal</b> <b>haze</b> in Belgian white beers was investigated using two fractionation-reconstitution experiments. In the first approach, wheat was milled into flour and bran. The flour was separated into starch, gluten, and water-extractables. The bran was further fractionated into a major water-unextractable fraction and a minor water-extractable fraction. Different laboratory-scale brews were made with a grist containing barley malt (60 %) and either reconstituted wheat fractions or wheat itself (40 %). The nephelometrically determined haze of the all-malt (reference) beers {{was significantly higher than}} that of the beers brewed with wheat and reconstituted wheat. The gluten fraction, containing more than 80 % proteins, had a strong negative effect. In a second fractionation-reconstitution experiment, wheat whole meal was submitted to an Osborne type of fractionation. The haze readings of the experimental beers brewed with different combinations of the obtained fractions showed that the water-extractable fraction had a negative effect and the combination of the water- and ethanol-extractable fractions had an extremely negative effect on the haze intensity of the beer. It was concluded that, under the experimental process conditions used, including a 60 : 40 ratio of barley malt to wheat, wheat has a strong negative effect on the permanent haze intensity of Belgian wheat beers and that this effect is predominantly caused by water-soluble or (as a result of brewing) solubilized gluten proteins. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Producers of apple-based {{beverages}} {{are confronted}} with <b>colloidal</b> instability. <b>Haze</b> is caused by interactions between molecules {{that lead to the}} formation of aggregates. Haze composition in three apple-based beverages, namely, French sparkling cider, apple juice, and pommeau, was studied. Phenolic compounds, proteins, polysaccharides, and minerals were analyzed using global and detailed analytical methods. The results explained < 75 % (w/w) of haze dry mass. Polyphenols, represented mainly by procyanidins, were the main compounds identified and accounted for 10 - 31 % of haze. However, oxidized phenolic compounds were probably underestimated and, may represent a high proportion of haze. Proteins were present in all of the samples in proportions of < 6 % of haze except in two apple juice hazes, where they were the main constituents (18 and 24 %). Polysaccharides accounted for 0 - 30 % of haze. Potassium and calcium were the main minerals...|$|R
40|$|The {{shelf-life}} of a packaged beer {{is determined}} by its ability to resist detrimental changes to its flavour, aroma and clarity. The most common symptoms of beer deterioration are the development of <b>colloidal</b> (non-biological) <b>haze,</b> formation of offflavours, precipitation of sediment, and, in extreme cases, the growth of spoilage organisms. The susceptibility of a beer to spoilage by any of these mechanisms may be predicted by measurement of appropriate indicator compounds. The aim of this thesis was to develop new or improved liquid chromatographic methods for the determination of these compounds, using selective detection systems which allowed direct injection of samples following dilution and/or clarification. Where appropriate, these methods were applied {{to the development of}} optimised stabilisation protocols. The area studied in greatest detail was the application of analytical technology to the investigation of beer colloidal stability. Novel methods for the determination of flavanols in beer were developed, and new procedures for the isolation of flavanol standards were described. These methods were then applied to the detailed study of the role of these compounds in beer haze and flavour instability. The stabilisation process was also studied in detail, and optimised stabilisation protocols were recommended. Volatile phenolics in beer were also studied. Novel methods for the determination of phenolic-off-flavour (POF) causing compounds were developed, and were applied to the optimisation of brewing regimes {{as well as to the}} classification of POF-producing yeasts. Oxalate may cause hazes and sediments in beers. A method was therefore developed for the determination of soluble and insoluble oxalate in beer and beer sediments, and the factors leading to the formation of such sediments were examined with a view to recommending procedures which could prevent the incidence of oxalate complaints in beer. Novel analytical methods using electrochemical detection were also developed for the determination of carbohydrates in beers, worts and non-alcoholic beverages, and for the determination of ascorbic acid in beer and malt beverages. These methods were then applied to the assessment of beer quality in general...|$|R
40|$|Haze and tea cream {{generation}} {{is a serious}} problem in the production of ready-to-drink (RTD) black tea liquors. Such precipitates consist primarily of proteins and polyphenols. Tea protein and tea polyphenol have been separated successfully in this study. The interactions of (1) tea protein and mixed TF; and (2) tea protein and total tea polyphenol were studied by ITC. A series of techniques, including gel filtration chromatography, sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, CBB assay and fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), have been used to determine the quantity and properties of proteins isolated from black tea powder. The molecular mass of the tea protein was detected to be approximately 11 kD at pH 5. 0. The purity of this protein isolate was 51. 4 wt % and a possible beta-sheet secondary structure was indicated from FTIR spectra. The total phenols in the tea polyphenol sample separated by Zn 2 + precipitation under alkali conditions (pH 7. 5) was increased to approximately 65 wt % of the sample tested. The binding mechanism of tea protein and TF was somewhat different from that of tea protein and total tea polyphenol, although both interactions were successfully fitted using a sequential sites binding model. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS In black tea liquor production, polyphenols tend to interact with proteins, caffeine and metal cations to form <b>colloidal</b> suspensions of <b>haze</b> and "tea cream", which are detrimental to product appearance and taste. This is a key concern in the production of ready-to-drink (RTD; iced tea) beverages, which are typically made from reconstituted spray dried tea powders and stored at low temperatures (potentially leading to precipitation). Tea cream and haze are traditionally removed by dissolution through pH adjustment. The size of haze and tea cream aggregates means that membrane technology can offer an alternative nonchemical separation option. To facilitate the removal of haze and tea cream in commercial RTD tea production, it is important to increase the level of understanding of polyphenol or tea protein interactions that occur in black tea liquor. Such interactions are the focus of this paper...|$|R
