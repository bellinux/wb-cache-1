40|$|Abstract. <b>Covers</b> <b>for</b> finite groups, a {{generalization}} of logarithmic signatures, {{form the basis}} of the ElGamal-like public-key cryptosystem MST 2. A relevant and open problem about the practical use of covers is {{the question of how to}} generate random <b>covers</b> <b>for</b> groups of large order. In this paper we show the connection between this problem and the classical occupancy problem. As a consequence, we can solve the problem of generating random <b>covers</b> <b>for</b> arbitrarily large finite groups completely. We also present several experimental computer results about covers and uniform <b>covers</b> <b>for</b> some alternating groups. These results provide useful hints for generating uniform random covers...|$|R
