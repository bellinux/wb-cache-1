These mandatory reports must {{also include a}} Unique Transaction Identifier (UTI), legal entity identifier (LEI), information on the trading capacity of the counterparty, and the marked-to-market valuation of the position. The <b>counterparty</b> <b>data</b> in a report includes 26 fields for data and the common data includes 59 fields of data. These fields include an LEI, or a unique 20 digit alphanumeric code {{that may be used}} for eight of the 26 <b>counterparty</b> <b>data</b> fields, and the unique trade identifier, which are generated based on the report's LEI.|$|E
5000|$|After {{developing}} these indices, one {{can calculate}} both PIT and TTC PDs for counterparties {{within each of}} the covered sectors. To obtain PIT PDs, one introduces the relevant indices into the relevant default models, re-calibrate the models to defaults, and apply the models with current and projected changes in indices as inputs. If a PD model weren’t otherwise PIT, the introduction of the indices will make it PIT. The specific model formulation depends on the features important to each, distinguished class of <b>counterparties</b> and <b>data</b> constraints. Some common approaches include: ...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{consists}} of two independent essays on financial econometrics. The first study introduces a new family of portmanteau tests for serial correlation. Using the wavelet transform, we decompose the variance of the underlying process into the variance of its low frequency and of its high frequency components and we design a variance ratio test of no serial correlation {{in the presence of}} dependence. Such decomposition can be carried out iteratively, each wavelet filter leading to a rich family of tests whose joint limiting null distribution is a multivariate normal. We illustrate the size and power properties of the proposed tests through Monte Carlo simulations. The second study focuses on counterparty risk and its role as a determinant of corporate credit spreads. However, {{there are only a few}} techniques available to isolate it from other factors. In this paper we describe a model of financial networks that is suitable for the construction of proxies for <b>counterparty</b> risk. Using <b>data</b> on the U. S. supplier-customer network of public companies, we find that, for each supplier, counterparties 2 ̆ 7 leverage and jump risk are significant determinants of corporate credit spreads. Our findings are robust after controlling for several idiosyncratic, industry, and market factors...|$|R
40|$|Enhanced BIS {{statistics}} on credit risk transfer 1 From June 2011, the BIS credit derivatives statistics provide more granular {{information on the}} types of risks transferred through credit default swaps by different groups of <b>counterparties.</b> The new <b>data</b> suggest that reporting dealers have used some hard-tovalue credit derivatives to transfer credit risk to shadow banks, possibly exposing these counterparty groups to valuation risks. The data also show that some financial counterparties have sold protection against defaults in the same sector on a net basis. JEL classification: C 82, G 18. The BIS CDS statistics were enhanced in two phases First, a finer breakdown of financial counterparties was introduced Second, the types of risks exchanged with counterparties were decomposed Opacity about the location of exposures to failing financial institutions exacerbated the recent financial crisis. In particular, there was a shortage {{of information about the}} web of credit risk transfers through over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives. To reduce that data gap, the Committee on the Global Financial System (CGFS) proposed two sets of enhancements to the semiannual credit default swaps (CDS) statistics compiled by the BIS (CGFS (2009)). These have been implemented in two phases. The first set of enhancements, introduced with the June 2010 statistics, provides a finer classification of the counterparties of reporting derivatives dealers (Vause (2010)). The new data showed net credit risk transfers from hedge funds to reporting dealers and from reporting dealers to all other sectors. 2 This pattern persisted in December 2010 and June 2011 (Graph 1). The second set of enhancements, first applied to the June 2011 data, makes two further improvements. It decomposes total credit risk transfers with each counterparty group according to characteristics of the underlying debt (sector, rating and maturity). It also reveals the market values of credit risk transfers with counterparties in different sectors after netting of any bilateral CDS positions with offsetting market values. This identifies counterparty groups 1 The views expressed in this article are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of the BIS.
