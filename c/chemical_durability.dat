Poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-hexafluoropropylene) (PVDF-HFP) nanofibers, decorated with CeO 2 nanoparticles are directly electrospun onto gas diffusion electrodes. The nanofiber mesh is impregnated by inkjet-printed Nafion ionomer dispersion. This results in 12 µm thin multicomponent composite membranes.

2500|$|Fused quartz is a glass {{made from}} chemically-pure silica. It has {{excellent}} resistance to thermal shock, {{being able to}} survive immersion in water while red hot. [...] However, its high melting temperature (1723°C) and viscosity {{make it difficult to}} work with. [...] Normally, other substances are added to simplify processing. One is sodium carbonate (Na2CO3, [...] "soda"), which lowers the glass-transition temperature. The soda makes the glass water-soluble, which is usually undesirable, so lime (CaO, calcium oxide, generally obtained from limestone), some magnesium oxide (MgO) and aluminium oxide (Al2O3) are added to provide for a better <b>chemical</b> <b>durability.</b> The resulting glass contains about 70 to 74% silica by weight and is called a soda-lime glass.

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is to {{comprehensively}} investigate the possibility of partially substituting natural aggregates with Black/Oxidizing Electric Arc Furnace (EAF) slag in concrete production.

Results showed that high substitution ratios of coarse natural aggregates are possible without decreasing mechanical properties of concrete. Conversely, replacement of fine natural aggregates with recycled ones seems feasible at lower substitution ratios only.

30|$|Nowadays, cyanate ester resins (CERs) {{become more}} and more well known because they display a unique {{combination}} of high-performance characteristics, such as excellent thermal and <b>chemical</b> stability, <b>durability</b> at elevated temperatures, superior adhesion to various substrates, and low dielectric losses, in comparison with that of conventional thermosets [1 – 3].
