According to the beam parameters from preparatory experiments and theoretical simulations, the beam line is preliminarily designed.

40|$|Retrovirus {{replication}} requires specialized transport {{mechanisms to}} export genomic mRNA from the nucleus to the cytoplasm of the infected cell. This regulation is mediated {{by a combination}} of viral and/or cellular factors that interact with cis-acting RNA export elements linking the viral RNA to the cellular CRM 1 or NXF 1 nuclear export pathways. Endogenous type D murine LTR retrotransposons (musD) were reported to contain an RNA export element located upstream of the 3 ′-LTR. Although functionally equivalent, the musD export element, termed the musD <b>transport</b> <b>element,</b> is distinct from the other retroviral RNA export elements, such as the constitutive <b>transport</b> <b>element</b> of simian/Mason-Pfizer monkey retroviruses and the RNA <b>transport</b> <b>element</b> found in rodent intracisternal A-particle LTR retrotransposons. We demonstrate here that the minimal RNA <b>transport</b> <b>element</b> (musD <b>transport</b> <b>element)</b> of musD comprises multiple secondary structure elements that presumably serve as recognition signals for the cellular export machinery. We identified two classes of tertiary interactions, namely kissing loops and a pseudoknot. This work constitutes the first example of an RNA <b>transport</b> <b>element</b> requiring such structural motifs to mediate nuclear export...|$|R

A new discretisation strategy for domain boundaries was developed to apply boundary conditions for the coupled analyses.

The thesis is devoted particularly to the development during last two decades. The text analyses the causes of decline in volume of the railway transport and its structural difficulties. The European Community did not cover the <b>Common</b> <b>transport</b> policy effectively at that time, thus member states had {{to solve the problems}} their own way. Therefore, firstly national models of the reforms are introduced. These models were the pattern for the new coming European reforms. The crucial moments, which had formed the <b>Common</b> <b>Transport</b> Policy, are emphasized. The European legislative is analyzed in the thesis. The primary aims of <b>Common</b> <b>Transport</b> Policy have been: formation of the internal market, revitalizing and liberalization of railways and harmonization of technical standards.

40|$|The {{origin of}} the <b>common</b> <b>transport</b> policy was in 1957. Currently the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) of 2007 signed in Lisbon is legally binding {{concerning}} the <b>common</b> <b>transport</b> policy of the EU. The dynamic pace of {{the implementation of the}} <b>common</b> <b>transport</b> policy the EU was commenced {{from the beginning of the}} 1990 s’ of the last century. The recognition of the importance and the role of transport for the EU as a whole by the Member States has created opportunities for the development of this branch of the economy, which for almost thirty years of the European integration was being marginalized. In contemporary rules about the <b>common</b> <b>transport</b> policy most barriers to its functioning throughout the continent were eliminated. For the EU the Trans-European Transport Networks (TEN-T) importance stems also from the fact that it should contribute to the achievement of greater economic and spatial cohesion of the European Union. The task of the TEN-T network is to increase the technical standardization of individual national networks, improvement of transport infrastructures, access facilitation to infrastructure and fostering better connections between national networks and transport modes. Today we can say without hesitation, that there has been huge progress in the implementation of the <b>common</b> <b>transport</b> policy in the EU. Codification and harmonization of laws at EU level contributes to the development of specific sectors of transport and strengthens European identity in the world...|$|R

40|$|The use of RNA <b>transport</b> <b>elements</b> from {{different}} viruses can provide novel attributes to HIV- 1 -based gene delivery {{systems such as}} improved safety or Rev independence. We previously described an HIV- 1 based gene delivery system that utilized the simian immunodeficiency virus Rev-response element (RRE) {{in place of the}} HIV- 1 RRE. Despite the use of Rev for the production of vector stocks, we showed the utility of this system for delivery of Rev M 10, a dominant-negative mutant of HIV- 1 Rev, into T-cells. Here, we investigated the use of RNA <b>transport</b> <b>elements</b> from Mason-Pfizer monkey virus or MPMV for the creation of high-titered Rev-free HIV- 1 -based packaging systems. The HIV- 1 gag/pol expression constructs containing one or more copies of MPMV constitutive RNA <b>transport</b> <b>element</b> (CTE) were used to package similarly modified genetransfer vectors in {{the presence or absence of}} Rev. An inverse correlation between the number of CTE modules and Rev dependency was noted for vector stock production. While packaging systems containing multiple CTEs were resistant to exogenously expressed Rev M 10, the titers of vectors encoding Rev M 10 were nevertheless reduced in comparison to vectors encoding only green fluorescent protein (GFP). In contrast, a gene transfer vector encoding the Rev M 10 transgene and containing both RNA <b>transport</b> <b>elements</b> exhibited almost no loss in titer in comparison to a corresponding vector encoding only GFP. The optimized Rev-independent gene delivery system was used for delivery of Rev M 10 transgene into T-lymphocytes.
