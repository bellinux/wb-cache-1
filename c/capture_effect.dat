25|$|FM is {{also used}} at {{intermediate}} frequencies by analog VCR systems (including VHS) to record the luminance (black and white) portions of the video signal. Commonly, the chrominance component is recorded as a conventional AM signal, using the higher-frequency FM signal as bias. FM is the only feasible method of recording the luminance ("black and white") component of video to (and retrieving video from) magnetic tape without distortion; video signals have a large range of frequency components – from a few hertz to several megahertz, too wide for equalizers to work with due to electronic noise below −60dB. FM also keeps the tape at saturation level, acting {{as a form of}} noise reduction; a limiter can mask variations in playback output, and the FM <b>capture</b> <b>effect</b> removes print-through and pre-echo. A continuous pilot-tone, if added to the signal – as was done on V2000 and many Hi-band formats – can keep mechanical jitter under control and assist timebase correction.|$|E
2500|$|Aircraft {{communications}} {{radio operations}} worldwide use amplitude modulation, predominantly A3E double sideband with full carrier on VHF and UHF, and J3E single sideband with suppressed carrier on HF. Besides being simple, power-efficient and compatible with legacy equipment, AM and SSB permit stronger stations to override weaker or interfering stations. Additionally, this method does not {{suffer from the}} <b>capture</b> <b>effect</b> found in FM. Even if a pilot is transmitting, a control tower can [...] "talk over" [...] that transmission and other aircraft will hear a somewhat garbled mixture of both transmissions, rather than just one or the other. Even if both transmissions are received with identical signal strength, a heterodyne will be heard where no such indication of blockage would be evident in an FM system.|$|E
2500|$|As {{the name}} implies, {{wideband}} FM (WFM) requires a wider signal bandwidth than amplitude modulation by an equivalent modulating signal; this {{also makes the}} signal more robust against noise and interference. Frequency modulation is also more robust against signal-amplitude-fading phenomena. As a result, FM {{was chosen as the}} modulation standard for high frequency, high fidelity radio transmission, hence the term [...] "FM radio" [...] (although for many years the BBC called it [...] "VHF radio" [...] because commercial FM broadcasting uses part of the VHF band—the FM broadcast band). FM receivers employ a special detector for FM signals and exhibit a phenomenon known as the <b>capture</b> <b>effect,</b> in which the tuner [...] "captures" [...] the stronger of two stations on the same frequency while rejecting the other (compare this with a similar situation on an AM receiver, where both stations can be heard simultaneously). However, frequency drift or a lack of selectivity may cause one station to be overtaken by another on an adjacent channel. Frequency drift was a problem in early (or inexpensive) receivers; inadequate selectivity may affect any tuner.|$|E
40|$|Neutron <b>capture</b> <b>effects</b> in meteorites and {{lunar surface}} samples have been {{successfully}} {{used in the past}} to study exposure histories and shielding conditions. In recent years, however, it turned out that neutron <b>capture</b> <b>effects</b> produce a nuisance for some of the short-lived radionuclide systems. The most prominent example is the 182 Hf- 182 W system in iron meteorites, for which neutron <b>capture</b> <b>effects</b> lower the 182 W/ 184 W ratio, thereby producing too old apparent ages. Here, we present a thorough study of neutron <b>capture</b> <b>effects</b> in iron meteorites, ordinary chondrites, and carbonaceous chondrites, whereas the focus is on iron meteorites. We study in detail the effects responsible for neutron production, neutron transport, and neutron slowing down and find that neutron capture in all studied meteorite types is not, as usually expected, exclusively via thermal neutrons. In contrast, most of the neutron capture in iron meteorites is in the epithermal energy range and there is a significant contribution from epithermal neutron capture even in stony meteorites. Using sophisticated particle spectra and evaluated cross section data files for neutron capture reactions we calculate the neutron <b>capture</b> <b>effects</b> for Sm, Gd, Cd, Pd, Pt, and Os isotopes, which all can serve as neutron-dose proxies, either in stony or in iron meteorites. In addition, we model neutron <b>capture</b> <b>effects</b> in W and Ag isotopes. For W isotopes, the GCR-induced shifts perfectly correlate with Os and Pt isotope shifts, which therefore can be used as neutron-dose proxies and permit a reliable correction. We also found that GCR-induced effects for the 107 Pd- 107 Ag system can be significant and need to be corrected, a result that is in contrast to earlier studies...|$|R

40|$|Studies {{aimed to}} <b>capture</b> the <b>effects</b> of IT-innovations {{in health and}} social care have shown {{that there is a}} gap between {{expected}} and factual outcomes. Many decision makers feel the need to articulate an ideal end-state for their organiza-tions.

5000|$|The channel <b>capture</b> <b>effect</b> is a {{phenomenon}} where one user of a shared medium [...] "captures" [...] the medium for a significant time. During this period (usually 16 frames), other users are denied use of the medium. This effect was first seen in networks using CSMA/CD on Ethernet. Because of this effect, the most data-intense connection dominates the multiple-access wireless channel. This happens in Ethernet links {{because of the way}} nodes [...] "back off" [...] from the link and attempt to re-access it. In the Ethernet protocol, when a communication collision happens (when two users of the medium try to send at the same time), each user waits for a random period of time before re-accessing the link. However, a user will wait ("back off") for a random amount of time proportional to the number of times it has successively tried to access the link. The channel <b>capture</b> <b>effect</b> happens when one user continues to [...] "win" [...] the link.|$|E
