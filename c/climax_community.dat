5|$|In {{suitable}} environments, {{such as the}} Daintree Rainforest in Queensland, or {{the mixed}} podocarp and broadleaf forest of Ulva Island, New Zealand, forest is the more-or-less stable climatic <b>climax</b> <b>community</b> {{at the end of}} a plant succession, where open areas such as grassland are colonised by taller plants, which in turn give way to trees that eventually form a forest canopy.|$|E
5|$|The marls was colonized by pioneer species, then {{shrubs and}} trees, {{corresponding}} to a primary succession. Without human intervention, a <b>climax</b> <b>community</b> would be reached. This dynamic may {{eventually lead to}} the disappearance of related open environments, particularly heritage species. However woodlands can also {{play an important role}} in creating habitat for many species. The management plan is therefore to maintain patch dynamics.|$|E
5|$|In cool {{temperate}} regions, conifers often predominate; {{a widely}} distributed <b>climax</b> <b>community</b> {{in the far}} north of the northern hemisphere is moist taiga or northern coniferous forest (also called boreal forest). Taiga is the world's largest land biome, forming 29% of the world's forest cover. The long cold winter of the far north is unsuitable for plant growth and trees must grow rapidly in the short summer season when the temperature rises and the days are long. Light is very limited under their dense cover {{and there may be}} little plant life on the forest floor, although fungi may abound. Similar woodland is found on mountains where the altitude causes the average temperature to be lower thus reducing the length of the growing season.|$|E

500|$|The {{retreat of}} the glaciers exposed land areas {{and as a}} result “Plant {{communities}} and animal populations ranging from [...] "pioneer species" [...] in areas recently exposed by receding glaciers to <b>climax</b> <b>communities</b> in older coastal and alpine ecosystems” have emerged.|$|R
25|$|Ecological {{succession}} {{is generally}} {{defined as the}} successive occupation of a site by different plant communities. In an accreting mudflats the outer community along the sequence represents the pioneer community which is gradually replaced by the next community representing the seral stages and finally by a <b>climax</b> <b>community</b> typical of the climatic zone. Robert Scott Troup suggested that succession began in the newly accreted land created by fresh deposits of eroded soil. The pioneer vegetation on these newly accreted sites is Sonneratia, followed by Avicennia and Nypa. As the ground is elevated {{as a result of}} soil deposition, other trees make their appearance. The most prevalent, though one of the late species to appear, is Excoecaria. As the level of land rises through accretion and the land is only occasionally flooded by tides, Heritiera fomes begins to appear.|$|E
2500|$|A {{study of}} the fire scars present in tree ring samples {{indicates}} that forest fires occur in the ponderosa forests surrounding Mount Rushmore around every 27 years. Large fires are not common. Most events have been ground fires that serve to clear forest debris.

5000|$|Edaphic Climax: When {{there are}} more than one <b>climax</b> <b>communities</b> in the region, {{modified}} by local conditions of the substrate such as soil moisture, soil nutrients, topography, slope exposure, fire, and animal activity, it is called edaphic climax. Succession ends in an edaphic climax where topography, soil, water, fire, or other disturbances are such that a climatic climax cannot develop.|$|R
40|$|Extract] Disturbance is an {{integral}} component of ecology, responsible for re-setting successional clocks and preventing the dominance of <b>climax</b> <b>communities</b> (Grime, 1973; Connell, 1978). However, ecologists, environmentalists and resource managers {{are concerned that the}} diversity, frequency, intensity, and spatial extent of disturbances is increasing (Hoegh-Guldberg, 1999; Wooldridge et al., 2005), and communities are perpetually {{in the early stages of}} succession, or have 'flipped' to alternate stable states (Scheffer et al., 2001) ...|$|R
5000|$|Preclimax and Postclimax: In {{certain areas}} {{different}} <b>climax</b> <b>communities</b> develop under similar climatic conditions. If {{the community has}} life forms lower {{than those in the}} expected climatic climax, it is called preclimax; a community that has life forms higher than those in the expected climatic climax is postclimax. Preclimax strips develop in less moist and hotter areas, whereas Postclimax strands develop in more moist and cooler areas than that of surrounding climate.|$|R
5000|$|Early in the 20th century, Frederic Clements {{and other}} plant ecologists {{suggested}} that ecological communities develop in a linear, directional manner towards a final, stable end-point: the <b>climax</b> <b>community.</b> Clements {{indicated that a}} site's <b>climax</b> <b>community</b> would reflect local climate.

30|$|In the Everglades, forested tree patches or tree {{islands are}} an {{integral}} component of the landscape and are generally considered <b>climax</b> <b>communities.</b> Tree islands, which are prominent features in both the short- and long-hydroperiod wetlands of the Everglades, provide a network of refuges for forest-dwelling plants and animals and perform important biodiversity and nutrient cycling functions (Gaines et al. 2002, Meshaka et al. 2002, Jayachandran et al. 2004, Hanan and Ross 2009, D’Odorico et al. 2011) and are highly susceptible {{to the effects of}} fire and prolonged flooding.|$|R
40|$|We {{propose that}} {{microbes}} {{that have developed}} persistent relationships with human hosts have evolved cross-signalling mechanisms that permit homeostasis that conforms to Nash equilibria and, more specifically, to evolutionarily stable strategies.

40|$|A 2 -year {{study was}} {{conducted}} in Hong Kong {{to examine the effects of}} substratum, season and length of submersion on the development of a subtidal epibiotic community using four types of settlement panels (concrete, steel, wood and tyre). The season and length of submersion had a strong influence on the total biomass and on community structure while the type of substratum had very little impact on the total biomass or the structure of the epibiotic community. The season of submersion determined the species composition of the newly submerged surfaces. In the spring and summer, tubeworms were the most abundant. In the autumn and winter, barnacles and tunicates dominated. Community succession was not obvious in the first year of submersion as it was intermingled with strong seasonal settlement, growth and death of barnacles and tunicates. In the second year of submersion, green mussels and tunicates settled and grew to occupy most of the panel surfaces, forming an assemblage that was characteristic of <b>climax</b> <b>communities</b> in the local subtidal waters. The results suggest that the type of construction material has limited impact on the development of epibiotic communities on artificial reefs deployed in Hong Kong; the season of submersion may affect community structure in the early successional stage, but not the characteristics of the <b>climax</b> <b>communities.</b> This study indicates that the type of substratum should not be of concern when deploying artificial reefs in the subtidal waters in this region. The design of artificial reefs should focus more on other physical and economical aspects such as durability, flow dynamics, stability, cost, and effects on the ambient environment. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

5000|$|In ecology, <b>climax</b> <b>community,</b> or climatic <b>climax</b> <b>community,</b> is a {{historic}} term for a biological community of plants, animals, and fungi which, {{through the process of}} ecological succession in the development of vegetation in an area over time, have reached a steady state. This equilibrium was thought to occur because the <b>climax</b> <b>community</b> is composed of species best adapted to average conditions in that area. The term is sometimes also applied in soil development. Nevertheless, it has been found that a [...] "steady state" [...] is more apparent than real, particularly if long-enough periods of time are taken into consideration.

50|$|A seral {{community}} is an intermediate stage {{found in an}} ecosystem advancing towards its <b>climax</b> <b>community.</b> In many cases more than one seral stage evolves until climax conditions are attained.

5000|$|Climatic Climax: If {{there is}} only a single climax and the {{development}} of <b>climax</b> <b>community</b> is controlled by the climate of the region, it is termed as climatic climax.

Climatic climax is theoretical and develops where physical conditions of the substrate are not so extreme as to modify the effects of the prevailing regional climate.|$|E
5000|$|There {{has been}} a shift in thought {{regarding}} grassland ecology as a new theory of [...] "stable state ecology" [...] has been proposed by van Andel and Grootjans (2006).

50|$|Eucephalus vialis {{occurs in}} Douglas, Jackson, Josephine, Lane, and Linn Counties in Oregon and Del Norte and Humboldt Counties in California. Several of these occurrences are {{relatively}} recent discoveries {{and the plant}} was once {{considered to be an}} endemic of the Willamette Valley. It grows mainly on dry sites in temperate coniferous forest habitat. The forest is dominated by Pseudotsuga menziesii (Douglas-fir), Arbutus menziesii (Pacific madrone), Chrysolepis chrysophylla (golden chinquapin), and Quercus garryana (Oregon white oak). Populations occur in many types of habitat, in all stages of ecological succession, from recently disturbed sites to mature <b>climax</b> <b>communities.</b> The plants do better in sunny location, and are less vigorous in shady habitat; as canopy cover increases, the plants are less common and those that do occur produce fewer flowers. Most of the plants are found in thin forests, openings in the forest, gaps on the forest edges. The plant can sometimes be found on serpentine substrates.|$|R
5000|$|In the off {{chance of}} a {{phenomenon}} which effectively removes most of the lifeforms in these areas, the resultant landscape {{is considered to be}} a disclimax, where there is a loss of the previous <b>climax</b> <b>community.</b> Factors which interrupt succession include: human intervention (plagioclimax), change in relief of land (topoclimax), change in animal species (biotic climax) or change in soil such as an increase in acidity (edaphic climax) [...] In most cases, should the area be left to regenerate as normal when the limiting factor is removed, the area eventually becomes a <b>climax</b> <b>community</b> again (secondary succession).|$|E
50|$|The <b>climax</b> <b>community</b> is {{composed}} of the most “tolerant” species that can co-exist with other species in a more densely populated area. Eventually, dominant species replace or reduce pioneer species abundance through competition.|$|E
50|$|These {{forests are}} the result of {{ecological}} succession, a long progression of different plant species over centuries. One possible sere is from bare ground, it would start with weeds, then shrubs, weedy trees (such as mulberry), then coniferous trees (such as juniper) and additional types such as ash lead to a mixed mesophytic forest. Eventually, an oak-hickory forest develops. If the conditions allow, the final <b>climax</b> <b>community</b> for several different series is the beech-maple community. Even in a <b>climax</b> <b>community</b> dominated by two types of trees, there can be many different species of trees on the edges of the forest, in windthrow gaps or in microclimates.|$|E

40|$|The classic late Tournaisian plant-bearing {{locality}} at Oxroad Bay {{was investigated}} by detailed field mapping, lithological logging, studies of clast orientation, this-section petrography and analyses of bulk geochemistry. The lithologically and structurally complex, c. 45 m-thick includes eight plant-bearing exposures (each consisting {{of up to}} 16 phytofossiliferous horizons) that have yielded 43 anatomically-preserved organ-species and 19 adpressed organ-species. All floral assemblages are allochthonous s. l. and demonstrate {{a wide range of}} preservation states. They occur in five successive facies (braided flood-plain, shallow volcanigenic lacustrine, terrrestrial mass-flow/base-surge, shallow biogenic lacustrine, dominantly terrestrial reworked ashes) that reflect increasing influence of several basaltic tuff-ring volcanoes on an ocean-marginal lowland bordering the Southern Upland Massif. The variable local climate reflected proximity to the proto-North Sea and eruptive seeding of the atmosphere with ash particles. Base-surges, seismically initiated mass-flows and volcanically-induced wildfires restricted the development of mature soils and of edaphic <b>climax</b> <b>communities.</b> These disturbances created a sequence of mosaic palaeocatenas that supported a wide range of sub-communities at any one moment in time. At least some of the relatively k-selected species that occupied the preceding, fluvially dominated terrain were extirpated by the persistent volcanism, yielding to immigrants that were better pre-adapted to the unstable environment.
