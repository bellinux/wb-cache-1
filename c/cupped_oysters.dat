Refinement usually takes place in land-based systems where the oysters are fed with relatively high concentrations of microalgae. In this study the impact of feeding Skeletonema costatum and Rhodomonas baltica on the biochemical composition and sensory characteristics of Pacific <b>cupped</b> <b>oysters</b> (Crassostrea gigas) from the Eastern Scheldt during land-based refinement was studied. After a feeding period of four and seven weeks market-sized oysters were sampled {{for the analysis of}} fatty acids, free amino acids and volatile organic compounds and for a sensory evaluation by consumers and an expert panel. The algae Skeletonema costatum showed a lower ∑. PUFA, ∑. n. - 3, ∑. n. - 6, C 18 : 2 n 6, C 18 : 3 n 3, C 18 : 4 n 3, C 22 : 6 n 3 content as compared with Rhodomonas baltica. These differences were also reflected in the fatty acid profile of the oysters fed with the corresponding algae diets. Furthermore, general linear model and principal component analysis showed marked differences in free amino acids and volatile organic compound content between Skeletonema, Rhodomonas fed oysters and reference oysters. For example, threonine, glutamine, leucine, histidine, (E) - 2 -hexenal, (E) - 2 octenal, (E) - 2 -octen- 1 -ol, (E,E) - 2, 4 -octadien- 1 -ol, (E,Z) - 3, 6 -nonadien- 1 -ol and (Z,E) - 2, 6 -nonadienal contents were higher in Skeletonema fed oysters compared to Rhodomonas fed oysters. Sensory differences between the experimental oyster groups were shown. Skeletonema fed Pacific <b>cupped</b> <b>oysters</b> were characterized by a stronger seaweed flavor, higher perceived sweetness and a firmer texture in comparison with Rhodomonas fed oysters.

Here, we present a genome-wide screen of genetic variation that combines SNP genotyping and RADsequencing approaches. Our results, based on more than 18, 000 SNP markers, improve our comprehension of the population structure and provide a powerful subset of highly informative markers for stock assignment.

The effect of hatchery supplementation on the effective population size of a recipient wild population (Ryman-Laikre effect) is reviewed in light of the population biology of bivalve molluscs, and appears to be minimal. Deployment of selected enhancement stocks may be a valuable tool for improvement of degraded wild populations, reversing the negative effects of generations of selective harvesting.

A significantly higher contribution of the C. gigas males was revealed with the C. angulata females, but not with the C. gigas females, which might suggest early heterosis or interaction differences between gametes.

This novel factor, named oyster-gonadal-TGFbeta-like (og-TGFbeta-like), is synthesized as a 307 amino acid precursor and displays 6 of the 7 characteristic cysteine residues of the C-terminal, mature peptide. Sequence comparison revealed that og-TGFbeta-like has a low percentage of identity with other known TGF-beta superfamily members, suggesting that og-TGFbeta-like is a derived member of this large superfamily. Real-time PCR (RT-PCR) analysis in different oyster tissues showed that og-TGFbeta-like is specifically expressed in {{both male and female}} gonads, at distinct levels according to the reproductive stage.

The indigenous species Ostrea edulis was replaced fi rst with Crassostrea angulata, then Crassostrea gigas. France is now the top producer and consumer of oysters in Europe, producing around 130, 000 tonnes of the cupped oyster C. gigas annually and a remaining 1, 500 tonnes of the fl at oyster O. edulis. <b>Cupped</b> <b>oysters</b> are produced all along the French coast from natural (80 %) and hatchery spat. Various structures are used to collect spat from the wild. After a growing-on period, oysters can be cultivated by three main methods: (i) on-bottom culture in the intertidal zone or in deep water; (ii) off-bottom culture in plastic mesh bags in the intertidal zone; or (iii) suspended culture on ropes in the open sea. The principal development {{that has taken place}} in culture techniques is the use of oysters produced in hatcheries, especially triploids. Almost all French oyster production is sold fresh and eaten raw straight from the shell. There is a strong seasonality in sales, with the most being made during the Christmas and New Year period. The abundant production and the lack of market organisation induce strong competition between the different production areas, causing prices to fall. In order to overcome this difficulty, oyster farmers have developed strategies of sales promotion and regional quality labelling.

Previously, bacteriological analysis of moribund oyster juveniles yielded an isolate of a Vibrio splendidus biovar II strain, named TNEMF 6. This isolate was demonstrated to be pathogenic to Crassostrea gigas spat by experimental challenge. To study the association between summer oyster mortality and presence of TNEMF 6 cluster strains, Vibrionaceae fauna were isolated from infected spat along the French Atlantic coast between 1997 - 1998.

The modular composition and the conserved putative target site duplication sequence AA at the element termini are equivalent to the composition of several elements found in the <b>cupped</b> <b>oyster</b> Crassostrea virginica and in some insects. A unique featureof D. trunculus element is ordered array of core repeat variants,distinctive by diagnostic changes. Position of variants in the array is fixed, regardless of alterations in the core repeat copy number. Each repeat harbors a palindrome near the junction with the following unit, being a potential hotspot responsible for array length variations. As a consequence, variations in number of tandem repeats and variations in flanking sequences make every sequenced element unique. Core repeats may be thus considered as individual units within the MITE, with flanking sequences representing a “cassette” for internal repeats. Our results demonstrate that onset and spread of tandem repeats can be more intimately linked to processes of transposition than previously thought and suggest that genomes are shaped by interplays within a complex network of repetitive sequences...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{purpose of}} this study is to {{investigate}} summer mortality of the <b>cupped</b> <b>oyster,</b> Crassostrea gigas, in relation to culture practices in the traditional oyster production region of Marennes-Oléron (France). Four oyster rearing conditions, varying culture location ("on-" or "off-bottom"), and site depth (65 % to 80 % daily immersion termed "deep" or 45 % to 65 %, termed "shallow") were studied to compare biologic performance and maturation status of oysters, in relation to sediment and water column parameters. The most severe mortality occurred in June to July in "on-bottom" reared oysters (25 %), as compared with 10 % mortality in "off-bottom" cultured oysters. Oysters (shell and meat) grew significantly better when reared "off-bottom" than "on-bottom. " Reproductive effort was almost double in "off-bottom" reared oysters, compared with those "on-bottom"; thus, reproduction cannot be directly related to mortality in this summer mortality event. Low glycogen content recorded for both "on" and "off-bottom" reared oysters in summer, confirmed the probable lack of food and/or the overstocking in the Marennes-Oléron Bay, but did not discriminated among culture conditions. Whatever the immersion depth ("deep" or "shallow" conditions), "on-bottom" cultured oysters were adversely affected in growth, reproductive effort, and survival suggesting a direct effect of the mud (the so called "mud effect") on the biologic performance of oysters cultured on the bottom. Data from monitoring of sediment redox potential, organic content, and ammonium release did not support hypotheses that these parameters were alone responsible for the observed differences in mortality events...|$|R
40|$|International audienceMetallothioneins and vitellogenins are low {{molecular}} weight proteins {{that have been used}} widely in environmental monitoring as biomarkers of exposure and damage to metals and estrogenic compounds, respectively. In the present study, the responses of metallothionein and vitellogenin tissue concentrations were measured following acute (96 h) aqueous exposures to cadmium in Saccostrea sp., a tropical <b>cup</b> <b>oyster</b> native to the Western Pacific Ocean that has recently established itself in the Caribbean Sea. Adult oysters (1. 5 – 5. 0 cm shell length) collected from the municipal marina of Santa Marta, Colombia (Caribbean Sea) and acclimated for 5 days in the laboratory, were exposed to Cd at five concentrations (0, 1, 10, 100 and 1000 μg/L) and their tissues (gills, digestive gland and adductor muscle) were analyzed in pools of 5 individuals (3 replicates per concentration). Metallothioneins in digestive glands of oysters exposed to Cd concentrations ≥ 100 μg/L showed a significant increase, from 8. 0 to 14. 8 μg MT/mg total protein, whereas metallothionein concentrations in gills increased to lesser extent, and no differences were observed in adductor muscle. Metallothionein concentrations in digestive gland and gills correlated directly with whole soft tissue Cd concentrations (ranging from 2 to 297 μg/g dw Cd). Vitellogenin in homogenates of oyster gonad tissue, after 96 h of exposure to 1000 μg/L Cd, were significantly lower (0. 04 mg P/g gonad) compared to control oysters (0. 68 mg P/g gonad), suggestive of an anti-estrogenic effect of Cd at high concentrations, whereas no significant changes in vitellogenin concentrations were observed at intermediate Cd exposure concentrations. This study confirms acute responses of metallothionein and vitellogenin concentrations in tissues of Saccostrea sp. exposed to high concentrations of cadmium (Cd ≥ 100 μg/L, 96 h). The present results are first step towards validating the use of these two proteins as biomarkers of metal exposure in this species...|$|R
40|$|The Vibrio splendidus clade has {{previously}} been associated with epidemic outbreaks of various aquatic animals, {{as in the case}} of the <b>cupped</b> <b>oyster,</b> Crassostrea gigas. To investigate whether involved strains could present a clonal origin and to identify possible alternative background carriage animals or zooplankton, a large epidemiological survey was conducted on isolates of the splendidus clade. For this purpose, Vibrio strains were isolated from various samples including oysters, mussels, sediments, zooplankton, and sea water on the basis of a North/South gradient of the European sea water zone (Ireland, The Netherlands, France, Italy, and Spain). A total of 435 isolates were successfully associated to the V. splendidus clade using real time polymerase chain reaction with 16 S specific primers and probes. A multiple-locus variable-number tandem-repeat analysis (VNTR) was conducted on all isolates based on a multiplex PCR–VNTR with a set of primer pairs designed from the V. tasmaniensis LGP 32 genome. Preliminary validation of the primers on a set of collection strains from the V. splendidus clade confirmed that the former V. splendidus-related LGP 32 and relative strains were related to V. tasmaniensis rather than to the type strain V. splendidus LMG 4042. The VNTR analysis was then successfully conducted on 335 isolates which led to the characterization of 87 different profiles. Our results showed that (1) the high diversity of VNTR did not enlighten significant correlation between a specific pattern and the origin of collected samples. However, populations isolated from animal samples tend to differ from those of the background environment; (2) oyster mortality events could not be linked to the clonal proliferation of a particular VNTR type. However, few different patterns seemed successively associated with samples collected during peaks of oyster’s mortality. (3) Finally, no correlation could be seen between specific VNTR patterns and sequence phylogeny of the virulence factors vsm and ompU that were detected among strains isolated during as well as outside mortality events. These results, combined with incongruence observed between the ompU and vsm phylogenetic trees, suggested both large diffusion of strains and massive lateral gene transfer within the V. splendidus clade. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht...|$|R
40|$|Monthly {{variations}} of fatty acid {{composition of the}} two fractions polar lipids (PL) and neutral lipids (NL) in the adductor muscle of <b>cupped</b> <b>oyster</b> Crassostrea gigas, were studied from May 2005 until June 2006 in the Bizert lagoon, related to environmental parameters and reproductive events. C. gigas showed a clear cycle of energy storage and utilization in the site of study. Total PL and NL content varied significantly during the year and showed a negative and significant correlation with the gametogenic condition index which {{can be explained by}} transfer of fatty acids from the adductor muscle to gonads to support the gametogenic cycle. Nevertheless, PL and NL have no significant correlations either with temperature or chlorophyll a registered in the site of study. The adductor muscle proved to be less influenced by chlorophyll a richness of the farming environment. The dominance of total polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) over the saturated fatty acids (SFAs) and monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs) in both PL and NL fractions was established throughout the period of study. Oysters analyzed were characterized by high levels of PUFAs n− 3 and high n− 3 /n− 6 PUFAs ratio in both PL and NL fractions. PUFAs n− 3 and SFAs of PL and PUFAs and SFAs of NL, showed a negative and significant correlation between them. In fact, low temperature values produce generally an increase in the PUFAs percentages {{in order to maintain the}} fluidity of cell membranes. We deduce that annual {{variations of}} fatty acids content in PL and NL fractions of the adductor muscle of C. gigas seem to be in relation with the reproductive events. According to our results, the adductor muscle tissues were relatively poor in fatty acids (maximum values (% of dry weight) of PL and NL respectively were 2. 04  ±  0. 33 and 1. 75  ±  0. 9). Lipids fluctuations were not pronounced all over the period of study in the site of sampling due to low effects of the environment richness and phases of the sexual cycle which aspires the adductor muscle contents of fatty acids to support other organs in the gametogenic process. But this organ arrives despite its difficulties to maintain a high level of n− 3 /n− 6 PUFA and having a good nutritional quality...|$|R
40|$|French {{production}} of the Pacific <b>cupped</b> <b>oyster,</b> Crassostrea gigas, is currently threatened by two pathogens, OsHV- 1 and V. aestuarianus. While oysters selected for their higher resistance to OsHV- 1 are now available for the industry, the impact of V. aestuarianus on such oysters is unknown, especially for triploids. In addition, experimental infection has used the virus or the bacteria alone, {{but there have been}} no investigations of dual exposure to these pathogens. This study is the first report of single or dual exposure in spat (Spat 1 and Spat 2), juvenile and adult naïve oysters. For each of the two stocks evaluated, unselected oysters and oysters selected for their higher resistance to OsHV- 1 infection were tested, as well as their triploid siblings of the selected oysters produced using cytochalasin B. We confirmed that resistance to OsHV- 1 infection and susceptibility to V. aestuarianus increased with age and size, although selected oysters were not significantly impacted by OsHV- 1 whatever their ploidy, size or age. We found different mortality patterns depending on the pathogen tested. The mortality pattern was similar for oysters exposed to OsHV- 1 or to both pathogens in the Spat 1 trial (4 months old and 1. 9 g). The mortality pattern was similar for oysters exposed to V. aestuarianus or to both pathogens in the Adult trial (25 months old and 63. 1 g). Surprisingly, mortality was much higher (ranging from 75. 9 % to 100 %), in particular for the selected oysters, for the Spat 2 (8 months old/ 3. 9 g) and Juvenile trials (16 months old/ 18. 4 g) given a dual exposure, regardless of the level of selection for OsHV- 1 and the ploidy state. Our findings highlight an important threat for oyster farmers: oysters exposed to both pathogens could experience dramatic mortality rates, even in oysters selected for their higher resistance to OsHV- 1. Finally, our study demonstrated {{for the first time that}} triploid oysters were more susceptible to experimental challenges with V. aestuarianus at the spat stage than their diploid siblings. However, the difference in mortality between the triploids and diploids remained limited and ranged from 22. 9 % to 6. 6 % for spat and adults, respectively with a relatively regularly decrease in the difference with increased age...|$|R
40|$|Recent transcriptomic {{approaches}} {{focused on}} anti-viral immunity in molluscs {{lead to the}} assumption that the innate immune system, such as apoptosis, plays a crucial role against ostreid herpesvirus type 1 (OsHV- 1), infecting Pacific <b>cupped</b> <b>oyster,</b> Crassostrea gigas. Apoptosis constitutes a major mechanism of anti-viral response by limiting viral spread and eliminating infected cells. In this way, an OsHV- 1 challenge was performed and oysters were monitored at three times post injection to investigate viral infection and host response: 2 h (early after viral injection in the adductor muscle), 24 h (intermediate time), and 48 h (just before first oyster mortality record). Virus infection, associated with high cumulative mortality rates (74 % and 100 %), was demonstrated in haemocytes by combining several detection techniques such as real-time PCR, real-time RT PCR, immunofluorescence assay, and transmission electron microscopy examination. High viral DNA amounts ranged from 5. 46 × 104 to 3. 68 × 105 DNA copies ng- 1 of total DNA, were detected in dead oysters and an increase of viral transcripts was observed from 2, 24, and 48 hpi for the five targeted OsHV- 1 genes encoding three putative membrane proteins (ORFs 25, 41, and 72), a putative dUTPase (ORF 75), and a putative apoptosis inhibitor (ORF 87). Apoptosis was studied at molecular and cellular levels with an early marker (phosphatidyl-serine externalisation measured by flow cytometry and epifluorescence microscopy) and a later parameter (DNA fragmentation by terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling assay (TUNEL)). The down-regulation of genes encoding proteins involved in the activation of the apoptotic pathway (TNF and caspase 3) and the up-regulation of genes encoding anti-apoptotic proteins (IAP- 2, and Bcl- 2) suggested an important anti-apoptosis phenomenon in haemocytes from OsHV- 1 infected oysters at 24 and 48 hpi. Additionally, more phosphatidyl-serines were externalized and more cells with DNA fragmentation were observed in haemocytes collected from artificial seawater injected oysters than in haemocytes collected from OsHV- 1 infected oysters at 24 and 48 hpi, suggesting an inhibition of the apoptotic process in presence of the virus. In conclusion, this study is the first to focus on C. gigas haemocytes, cells involved in the host immune defense, during an OsHV- 1 challenge in controlled conditions by combining various and original approaches to investigate apoptosis at molecular and cellular levels...|$|R
40|$|Significance of {{fish for}} food webs in the Wadden sea Moritz Pockberger, Florian Kellnreitner, Harald Asmus The Wadden Sea, an UNESCO world {{heritage}} site since 2009, is widely known as a nursery ground for commercially important fish of the North Sea, and also provides a habitat for small-sized fish species. Recently the fish fauna of the North Sea shows profound alterations respecting species compositon, standing stocks and migration behavior. Therefore, {{in the frame of}} long term observations of biological parameters in the Sylt-Rømø Bight (=SRB), a fish survey was conducted since 2007, to document possible changes of species composition and stock size, considering the rise of temperature on a local scale. Sampling takes place monthly on seven locations inside SRB using a bottom trawl, which is designed to be deployed also as flyde trawl for pelagic fishing. On every location a benthic and on deeper sites additionally a pelagic haul is performed. To achieve a clear picture of trophic positions and interactions between fish species inside the SRB gut content analysis and feeding experiments are carried out. Most of the long term data will be used to portray a food web for the total SRB {{as well as for the}} particular habitats of this area. This food web will reflect certain scenarios of environmental conditions and biological status to give a holistic view of the current as well as the expected changes. Until now, fish species are underrepresented in this food web and due to the lack of basic data only eight fish species could be included. Increasing temperatures in summer may lead to immigration of lusitanian species, such as the sand smelt (Atherina presbyter), anchovy (Engraulis encrasicolus) and the striped red mullet (Mullus surmuletus) into the Wadden Sea. Additionally a higher proportion of thermophile species is expected to visit the Wadden Sea, whereas boreal species may move to more northern regions. During a warm summer period in 2003 a high immigration of small thermophile fish, such as sand smelt and anchovy and emigration of indigenous fish was observed in the SRB. Considering the above described changes and varying residence times during seasons, shifts in the food web can be expected. In winter, higher temperatures may delay the migration of fish species into depths that have more stable environmental conditions. Several findings indicate ongoing changes in the SRB, e. g. sand smelt was found rarely, but is now found regularly in summer during sampling and it is assumed that reproduction takes place inside the SRB. In autumn, hatchlings of grey mullets (Chelon labrosus) were caught both in beach seine and bottom trawl. This species was only recorded as a summer guest before. Furthermore, catches of black goby (Gobius niger), may be an example for ongoing faunal changes occurring in the area. To identify potential seasonal differences in species abundance and the role of southern species in the Wadden sea food web, an analysis of guild structures was conducted. Another subject of investigation will be the impact of new established habitats, like reefs of the Pacific <b>cupped</b> <b>oyster</b> (Crassostrea gigas) and Japanese Sargasso weed (Sargassum muticum) on fishes. These two species occur densely in high numbers and are able to change abiotic factors. Identification of feeding relationships and of key prey species provide important information for coastal area management and may help to explain structural variations of fish community in an area that is subject to constant change. ...|$|R
5000|$|Many Art critics, {{writers and}} Art historians {{have written about}} Solangi’s work, since his first solo {{exhibition}} ‘Sufficient Grounds’, there are various publications that covered Solangi’s work. Aasim Akhtar wrote: 'What makes his work so unique is its combination of rigorous structural control with the humanistically expressive power of colour. In this duality one may perhaps find a lingering reminiscence of the opposition between the language of pure ornament and the anthropocentric ideal of the perfectly proportioned figure. His work is typified by the artistic adaptation of visual experience from everyday life, which often serves as his initial source of inspiration. Thus the {{point of departure for}} a painting may be a reference to an architectural detail - a section of a façade, or an ancient dry-stone wall - or some other found element. These fragments of reality are then formally encoded and endowed with a new and specifically artistic dignity via the use of colour.' He further writes: 'A master of elision, Solangi lets the part stand for the whole in his graphic paintings that feature overlapping fragments of landscape, ellipses and drapes. The effect is dreamlike yet not quite surreal. Solangi’s work captures a world of ruin and decay where the urban debris mixes with peeling paint to suggest forms of foreboding beauty. His paintings imply landscape, but the elements are abstracted, manipulated, and disconnected: Solangi’s colour choices and compositional balance are often exquisite. But he overthinks his material, and his reworkings sometimes give the work an air of hesitancy.' Nafisa Rizvi writes:'Aqeel Solangi traverses the three essential landscapes upon which the blueprint of the universe as we experience it is sustained - the sensory, the terrestrial and the celestial. There are several familiar territories in his paintings like dark clouds looming over faltering shelters and unfamiliar, fantastical ones like cacti floating through inundated bridges. But they all point to the fragility and transience of human experience and the aspiration for divine sustenance. These are not just grandiloquent statements that the artist uses as esoteric formulae for visual production.'Marjorie Husain writes: 'In his work Solangi has mastered the complex processes by which an artist views the world; the system of signs and symbolic forms, a sense of place, art and beauty, and the grandeur and beauty of the natural world. Evident in his work is Solangi’s interest in the sublime aspects of nature, often appearing as a hymn of praise.The artist has walked a determined and often difficult path to follow his muse, and one finds the joy and humility of true creativity in his work. In his youth, the closest art activity found in his hometown in Sindh was the painter of signs and cinema hoardings, so as has been the case with several of the country’s most distinguished artists, he attached himself to those painters.'Dr Akbar Naqvi writes: 'While speaking of Solangi’s skill as a painter, which is what he is rather than a philosopher or historian of culture, his observation strikes one. Be it an apple, a kashkol or its versions as an empty <b>cup</b> or an <b>oyster</b> shell or periwinkles, what looks like shredded paper as an abstract collage, are painted with minute details, as if Solangi had training as a miniature painter. It is the multiplicity of details, including heavy and light brush strokes in some paintings, which designs his contrapuntal paintings and increases their scope. His uninhibited use of eclectic technique, including pasting papers and painting them over as a variation of collage, ought to be commended. Solangi has reached a stage where his own works challenge him to improve further while negotiating with two styles and cultures, while remaining firmly rooted not just in Sindh, but Pakistan.' [...] He further writes: 'Solangi’s painting or imagistic assemblage, as modern and contemporary as it can be, in which he uses various media and techniques, is dynamic without being kinetic art or action painting. It incorporates a paradox in which disconnection connects and movement is still with strong undercurrents and cross-currents below the surface. In the artist’s painting each is all and all each, a new permutation and combination of design in which geometry and numbers set up a new discourse of craft/art, and the self.' ...|$|R
