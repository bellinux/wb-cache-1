5|$|As {{the trade}} {{deadline}} approached, it was {{speculated that the}} Phillies would surrender older players to obtain younger ones. They made two deals, neither involving key components of the team. In August they had their best month of the season: a 14–13 record, thanks to strong pitching and adequate hitting. Although the Phillies began September with four pitchers combining for a no-hitter, their month deteriorated from there. The squad had an 11–15 record, finishing the season with 73 wins and 89 losses.

40|$|This {{experiment}} {{tested the}} general hypothesis that majority influence induces convergent processing, which stimulates attitude <b>change</b> <b>on</b> focal issues, whereas minority influence sometimes produces divergent processing, which might stimulate <b>change</b> <b>on</b> related attitudes. Results of a numerical support (majority vs. minority) by outcome involvement (high vs. low) experiment with attitude change and cognitive activity as dependent variables yielded partial support for these predictions. Majority arguments caused more attitude <b>change</b> <b>on</b> the focal issue than minority arguments, especially under high outcome involvement; no effects, however, {{were found for}} attitudes towards related issues. Consistent with expectations also was the result that, especially under high outcome involvement, cognitive activity predicted attitude <b>change</b> <b>on</b> the focal issue {{in the case of}} majority support, but generalization to related issues in the case of minority support for persuasive arguments. Results are interpreted as consistent with the general conclusion (a) that majority support is more effective than minority support in eliciting attitude <b>change</b> <b>on</b> focal issues, (b) that both majority and minority support elicit cognitive activity, which predicts attitude <b>change</b> <b>on</b> focal issues in the case of majority support, but generalization in the case of minority support and (c) that these processes are especially strong when there is motivation to engage in systematic processing of persuasive arguments...|$|R

Dangerous mass-formations, which involved interlocking interference, like the flying wedge resulted in serious injuries and deaths.

In response, sixty-two colleges and universities met in New York City to discuss rule <b>changes</b> <b>on</b> December 28, 1905, and these proceedings resulted {{in the formation of}} the Intercollegiate Athletic Association of the United States, later named the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA).|$|E

A demo featuring the battle against the Astral Titan was featured at E3 2016: while drawing on a part of the game, the fight was tailored for the demo so it could be completed within a ten-minute window, with the full version having different victory requirements. A Japan-exclusive commercial demo dubbed Judgement Disc was released on November 11.

5|$|From the outset, {{the school}} was run as an {{elementary}} school with an infants' department. In 1918, the Fisher Act raised the school leaving age to 14 and many schools subsequently split into junior and senior departments; to accommodate senior children at Sleaford Council School, the County Council proposed formally introducing separate departments, one for infants and junior pupils (those aged below 10), and another for the remaining (senior) pupils. The Board of Education approved these plans in 1922. In 1935 the County Council reorganised schooling in Sleaford so that the Council School's senior department received all the town's children in elementary education aged over 10. The Board of Education sanctioned these <b>changes</b> <b>on</b> the condition that new classrooms {{be added to the}} Council school to accommodate Senior pupils and a new Infants' department be erected at the site. Financial setbacks and delays over the purchasing of land meant that the new Infants' school was not completed until 1939.|$|E

Based in West Glacier, with the main headquarters in Bozeman, Montana, the U.S. Geological Survey has performed scientific research on specific climate change studies since 1992. In addition {{to the study of}} the retreating glaciers, research performed includes forest modeling studies in which fire ecology and habitat alterations are analyzed. Additionally, changes in alpine vegetation patterns are documented, watershed studies in which stream flow rates and temperatures are recorded frequently at fixed gauging stations, and atmospheric research in which UV-B radiation, ozone and other atmospheric gases are analyzed over time. The research compiled contributes to a broader understanding of climate changes in the park. The data collected, when compared to other facilities scattered around the world, help to correlate these climatic <b>changes</b> <b>on</b> a global scale.|$|E

Four members – Mykolas Biržiška, Steponas Kairys, Stanisław Narutowicz and Jonas Vileišis – resigned from the Council in protest. Chairman Antanas Smetona, who supported the Act of December 11, stepped down. Jonas Basanavičius, who would later be called the patriarch of independence, was elected chairman.|$|E
