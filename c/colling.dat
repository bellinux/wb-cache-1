2500|$|Christian's {{early work}} on {{churches in the}} 1840s had {{importantly}} led to the beginnings of this success. Soon after establishing himself in Bloomsbury Square he produced the winning design in the competition for St. John the Evangelist, Hildenborough, in Kent, his first church, completed in 1844. Notably, the church was in Christian's favourite Early English Gothic style, built in stone with tall, pointed lancet windows and was of a preaching church form, very broad, open and spacious inside, centring attention on the sermon during services. This reflected Christian's own preferences and strictly held belief, being a serious and rather forbidding low-church Anglican. His Evangelical religion was deeply woven into his life; he regularly worshipped at St. John's Chapel, Downshire Hill, in Hampstead, and was for more than 35 years a Sunday School teacher and superintendent there. He read Matthew Henry's (1662–1714) Exposition of the Old and New Testaments(1708–10) every day and always kept Sunday free of business. His fondness for incorporating into his designs improving mottoes, proverbs and biblical quotations perhaps expresses this aspect of him – 'Thwaitehead' the house he built for himself in Hampstead displayed his favourite, [...] "God's Providence Is Mine Inheritance", while his own office bore the motto [...] "Trust And Strive".After his success at Hildenborough Christian began work on Illustrations of Skelton Church, Yorkshire, his only book, published in 1846. The Church of St. Giles in Skelton, York, is a small perfect example of the Early English style of Gothic architecture which Christian so admired and was built about the year 1247 probably by the masons of York Minster's south transept. It {{must have been a}} delight for Christian when he was later appointed to restore the church, providing it with an impressive new open timber roof in 1882. Some of the drawings for the publication were done by J. K. <b>Colling</b> (1816–1905), a friend and fellow pupil from their time in Habershon and Brown's offices. <b>Colling</b> was a master draughtsman and later provided foliage designs for the interior decoration of Christian's National Portrait Gallery. Christian gained some recognition from these achievements, particularly from supporters of the Gothic Revival in architecture, and he {{went on to win the}} competition for the restoration of St. Mary's Church, Scarborough in 1847 which he called 'the cornerstone of success'. That year Christian was appointed Consulting Architect to the Lichfield Diocesan Church Building Society and also became a consulting architect to the Incorporated Church Building Society, a body established in 1818 for funding the building and restoration of churches throughout the country. Christian later became Chairman of its Architects Committee.|$|E

[...] Jayson Rodriguez of MTV News, commented [...] "Through six outfit changes, bombastic ballads, high-energy singles and a daring high-wire journey from the stage {{to the center of}} the arena, Beyoncé delivered over and over again." [...] A writer of Billboard magazine noted that Knowles [...] "brought all the fierceness" [...] on stage for the tour.

Comparing her performance with Michael Jackson's, Renee Michelle Harris of the South Florida Times writes, [...] " [...] owns the stage with her trademark swagger and intensity... showcasing her powerful vocals without missing a note, often while engaged in vigorous, perfectly executed dance moves...no one, not Britney, not Ciara and not Rihanna can offer what she does—a complete package of voice, moves and presence." [...] Tamara Hardingham-Gill of the Daily Mail awarded the performance five out of five stars and noted that Knowles' vocal abilities were showcased during the ballads of the show where she was [...] "note perfect throughout". She concluded her review by saying that although it was [...] "too early" [...] to compare Knowles with Michael Jackson, [...] "she certainly proved that she is one of the most exciting and talented performers around and may well go down in history as such." [...] Comparing her with Diana Ross and Tina Turner, Holly Burnes of The Daily Telegraph noted that Knowles proved she was the [...] "world's best female performed" [...] with her performance and added, [...] "Whether crumping, sweeping across the stage in towering heels, or simply standing still, Beyonce was dynamite, blasting the benchmark for concert performers forever... Good luck trying to follow that act whoever you are." [...] Simon <b>Colling</b> from The West Australian described the performance as [...] "powerhouse" [...] and added, [...] "Beyonce's high-energy, high-voltage mix of song (loud, commercial R) and dance recalled names like Tina Turner, Aretha Franklin and rapper Missy Elliott. Sometimes her booming vocals were so over the top she seemed to have come down with a case of Mariah Carey syndrome." [...] Writing that there were [...] "ska, reggae, girlish pop, jazz, rap, soul, gospel, Middle Eastern, rock and body-thumping club remixes", Joanna Horowitz of The Seattle Times added, [...] "The only thing is, while she can wrap her voice and body around just about any style, she doesn't really have her own signature, at least musically. And while all the variety kept the concert interesting, it came off a little unfocused... But for a show that's as much about style as music, you gotta hand it to Beyoncé. The evening played out like a hip-hop Cirque du Soleil — sequins galore, dramatic dance numbers, and Beyoncé at one point soaring". The Observers Barbara Ellen wrote, [...] "she is a performer who can shape-change at will. Whether charismatic and soulful, or teasing and flirty, Beyoncé is, above all, in charge. Probably the most 'in charge' of any female artist I've seen onstage... she is a force of nature – delivering one of the most enjoyable well-paced shows I've seen in years." [...] However, she noted that Knowles is [...] "so steeped in professionalism that what should be magical can become mechanical."

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{determine}} <b>Coll</b> 2 - 1, <b>Coll</b> 2 - 1 NO(2) and myeloperoxydase (MPO) {{levels in}} serum {{of patients with}} knee or hip osteoarthritis (OA) before the surgery, 3 months and 1 year after knee or hip replacement. METHODS: <b>Coll</b> 2 - 1, <b>Coll</b> 2 - 1 NO(2) and MPO were measured in 103 patients with isolated symptomatic knee or hip OA candidates for joint replacement. Sera were taken the day before surgery, 3 months and 1 year after hip or knee replacement. <b>Coll</b> 2 - 1 and <b>Coll</b> 2 - 1 NO(2) immunohistochemistry was performed on biopsies removed from cartilage lesions. RESULTS: Immunostainings revealed the extensive presence of <b>Coll</b> 2 - 1 and <b>Coll</b> 2 - 1 NO(2) in the superficial layer of fibrillated cartilage and around some chondrocytes clusters. Three months after joint replacement, <b>Coll</b> 2 - 1 and MPO serum levels were decreased and even reached the reference value for <b>Coll</b> 2 - 1. By contrast, <b>Coll</b> 2 - 1 NO(2) levels remained elevated. At 1 -year follow-up, <b>Coll</b> 2 - 1 levels remained at the reference value, MPO levels {{were similar to those}} measured at 3 months, and <b>Coll</b> 2 - 1 NO(2) levels were unchanged and comparable to the pre-surgery values. However, in patients with pre-surgery values above the median (more than 0. 42 nM), <b>Coll</b> 2 - 1 NO(2) levels significantly and progressively decreased post-operatively, but tended towards an increase in patients with pre-surgery <b>Coll</b> 2 - 1 NO(2) values below the median. CONCLUSIONS: The normalisation of <b>Coll</b> 2 - 1 levels 3 months after surgery indicates that <b>Coll</b> 2 - 1 is a disease-specific marker that is sensitive to the structural changes occurring in a single joint. Furthermore, the immunohistochemical findings are consistent with the concept that the major source of serum <b>Coll</b> 2 - 1 is the damaged articular cartilage. Finally, serum MPO levels decreased after joint replacement indicating that neutrophil activation occurs in OA joints, even in the late stage of the disease. Peer reviewe...|$|R

As a consequence, the ratio <b>Coll</b> 2 - 1 NO 2 /Coll 2 - 1 was 1. 6 times higher in RA than in OA subjects. No relationship was found between the radiological OA severity and the levels of <b>Coll</b> 2 - 1 and <b>Coll</b> 2 - 1 NO 2 in serum. <b>Coll</b> 2 - 1 NO 2, but not <b>Coll</b> 2 - 1, was correlated with C-reactive protein in the sera of OA and RA patients. Conclusions: The determination of both <b>Coll</b> 2 - 1 and <b>Coll</b> 2 - 1 NO 2 in serum of arthritic patients seems to be a promising useful tool for the detection of oxidative-related cartilage degradation episode. Further, these markers could be helpful for monitoring the effects of anti-inflammatory or antioxidant drugs on cartilage degradation. (c) 2004 OsteoArthritis Research Society International.
