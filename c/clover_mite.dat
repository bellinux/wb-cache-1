50|$|Perhaps {{the best}} known species is Bryobia praetiosa, the <b>clover</b> <b>mite</b> or brown <b>clover</b> <b>mite,</b> an {{economically}} important pest of over 250 species of plants. It occurs nearly worldwide. Like other bryobia mites, this species is herbivorous, {{but there have been}} occasional reports of it occurring as an ectoparasite on humans, particularly children. It causes an itchy skin irritation. There has also been an isolated case report of an infestation in a domestic cat.|$|E
40|$|This guide {{describes}} {{the life cycle}} of clover mites and offers strategies for controlling them. Clover mites are common nuisance pests in Nebraska, often invading homes and other properties in enormous numbers. These tiny pests are most troublesome in early spring and again in fall, especially on the east and south sides of buildings. Also, they frequently appear on window sills during the winter months, on relatively warm, calm, sunny days. The <b>clover</b> <b>mite</b> is not an insect but is a relative of spiders and ticks. The full-grown <b>clover</b> <b>mite</b> is slightly smaller than a pin head and has a reddish to reddish-brown body. They appear as dark red specks crawling around windows, drapes, curtains and furniture...|$|E
50|$|<b>Clover</b> <b>mites</b> {{can become}} a {{nuisance}} in and around houses. They generally enter houses close to thick vegetation and can infiltrate houses in very large numbers through cracks and small openings around windows and doors. Whether indoors or outside, <b>clover</b> <b>mites</b> are found more commonly in sunny areas than in darker areas. If squashed, they leave a characteristic red stain caused by their pigmentation.|$|R
50|$|<b>Clover</b> <b>mites</b> are 0.75 - 0.85 mm long, oval shaped arachnids {{with a pair}} of {{long legs}} {{pointing}} forward often mistaken for antennae. They are reddish brown; the younger ones and the eggs are a bright red. They are extremely common in late spring.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Clover</b> <b>mites</b> are polyphagous, {{feeding on}} a wide range of plants, {{including}} [...] "lawn grasses, ornamental flowers, clover, dandelion, shepherd's purse, strawberry, daffodil, Salvia, Alyssum, and primrose". They are especially numerous in lawns with a heavy growth of succulent, well-fertilized grass. They do not cause any apparent harm to turf grass, but their feeding activity can turn the grass a silvery color and may stipple plants when heavy populations are present.|$|R
40|$|The <b>clover</b> <b>mite,</b> Bryobia praetiosa Koch, {{is a tiny}} {{relative}} of spiders and ticks. Thousands of clover mites can appear during spring or fall, and they are often found crawling around windows or other areas of a house. Clover mites are distinguished from other species of household-invading mites by their reddish-green color and long front legs. The front legs are {{as long as the}} body and almost twice the length of the other legs. These distinguishing features can be seen {{with the aid of a}} magnifying glass. Vast numbers of clover mites can invade a house through cracks and tiny openings around windows and doors. Clover mites do not bite people or pets and do not damage the house or furniture, but they can stain light-colored walls, carpet, fabrics or papers when crushed...|$|E
