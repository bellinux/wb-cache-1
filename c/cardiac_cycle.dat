5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the <b>cardiac</b> <b>cycle,</b> in early diastole, both the atria and ventricles are relaxed. Since blood moves from areas of high pressure to areas of low pressure, when the chambers are relaxed, blood will flow into the atria (through the coronary sinus and the pulmonary veins). As the atria begin to fill, the pressure will rise so that the blood will move from the atria into the ventricles. In late diastole the atria contract, pumping more blood into the ventricles. This causes a rise in pressure in the ventricles. As the ventricles reach systole, blood will be pumped into the pulmonary artery (right ventricle) or aorta (left ventricle).|$|E

In this way, the overall magnitude and direction of the heart's electrical depolarization is captured at each moment throughout the <b>cardiac</b> <b>cycle.</b> The graph of voltage versus time produced by this noninvasive medical procedure is referred to as an electrocardiogram.|$|E
25|$|Heart murmurs are {{generated}} by turbulent flow of blood, which may occur {{inside or outside}} the heart. Murmurs may be physiological (benign) or pathological (abnormal). Abnormal murmurs {{can be caused by}} stenosis restricting the opening of a heart valve, resulting in turbulence as blood flows through it. Abnormal murmurs may also occur with valvular insufficiency (regurgitation), which allows backflow of blood when the incompetent valve closes with only partial effectiveness.

25|$|Ejection {{fraction}} (EF) is a parameter {{related to}} SV. EF is {{the fraction of}} blood ejected by the left ventricle (LV) during the contraction or ejection phase of the <b>cardiac</b> <b>cycle</b> or systole. Prior {{to the start of}} systole, during the filling phase or diastole, the LV is filled with blood to the capacity known as end diastolic volume (EDV).

500|$|The {{papillary}} muscles {{extend from}} {{the walls of the}} heart to valves by cartilaginous connections called chordae tendinae. These muscles prevent the valves from falling too far back when they close. During the relaxation phase of the <b>cardiac</b> <b>cycle,</b> the papillary muscles are also relaxed and the tension on the chordae tendineae is slight. As the heart chambers contract, so do the papillary muscles. This creates tension on the chordae tendineae, helping to hold the cusps of the atrioventricular valves in place and preventing them from being blown back into the atria.|$|E
500|$|The <b>cardiac</b> <b>cycle</b> {{refers to}} a {{complete}} heartbeat which includes systole and diastole and the intervening pause. The cycle begins with contraction of the atria and ends with relaxation of the ventricles. [...] Systole refers to contraction of the atria or ventricles of the heart. Diastole is when the atria or ventricles relax and fill with blood. The atria and ventricles work in concert, so in systole when the ventricles are contracting, the atria are relaxed and collecting blood. When the ventricles are relaxed in diastole, the atria contract to pump blood to the ventricles. This coordination ensures blood is pumped efficiently to the body.|$|E
500|$|The {{structural}} {{domain of}} cTnC (cCTnC) is anchored to troponin I and T, forming the so-called IT arm, {{made up of}} cTnC93-161, cTnI41-135 and cTnT235-286 (in the cardiac complex). cCTnC binds to helical cTnI41-60 via its large hydrophobic patch, stabilizing the Ca2+-bound open conformation of cCTnC and enhancing its affinity for Ca2+ (from Kd = 40 nM to Kd = 3 nM). cTnT235-286 forms a helical coiled coil with cTnI88-135 that binds to the opposite face of cCTnC. The IT arm is anchored to tropomyosin via adjacent segments of cTnT, so it is believed to move as a unit along with tropomyosin throughout the <b>cardiac</b> <b>cycle.</b> In the low calcium environment present during diastole (~100 nM), tropomyosin is anchored into the [...] "blocked" [...] position along the actin thin filament through the binding of the troponin I inhibitory (cTnI128-147) and C-terminal (cTnI160-209) regions. This prevents actin-myosin cross-bridging and effectively shuts off muscle contraction.|$|E

This study introduces a novel, efficient, accurate and robust technique for the spatiotemporal alignment of consecutive <b>cardiac</b> <b>cycles</b> with variable temporal characteristics. Furthermore, optimal acquisition parameters, such as the number of consecutive <b>cardiac</b> <b>cycles</b> used, are derived. The effect of the proposed implementation of temporal compounding on cardiac ultrasound images is quantitatively assessed (32 clinical data sets providing a representative range of image qualities and diagnostic values) using measures such as tissue signal-to-noise ratio, chamber signal-to-noise ratio, tissue/chamber contrast and detectability index, as well as a range of clinical measurements, such as chamber diameter and wall thickness, performed during routine echocardiographic examinations. Temporal compounding (as implemented) consistently improved the image quality and diagnostic value of the processed images, when compared with the original data by: (i) increasing tissue and cavity signal-to-noise ratios as well as tissue/cavity detectability index, (ii) improving the corresponding clinical measurement repeatability and inter-operator measurement agreement, while (iii) reducing the number of omitted measurements caused by data corruption...|$|R

There are normally two heart sounds, and abnormal heart sounds can either be extra sounds, or [...] "murmurs" [...] related to the flow of blood between the sounds. Murmurs are graded by volume, from 1 (the quietest), to 6 (the loudest), and evaluated by their relationship to the heart sounds, position in the <b>cardiac</b> <b>cycle,</b> and additional features such as their radiation to other sites, changes with a person's position, the frequency of the sound as determined {{by the side of the}} stethoscope by which they are heard, and site at which they are heard loudest.Phonocardiograms can record these sounds, and echocardiograms are generally required for their diagnosis. Murmurs can result from valvular heart diseases due to narrowing (stenosis), or regurgitation of any of the main heart valves, such as aortic stenosis, mitral regurgitation or mitral valve prolapse. They can also result from a number of other disorders, including atrial and ventricular septal defects. Two common and infective causes of heart murmurs are infective endocarditis and rheumatic fever, particularly in developing countries. Infective endocarditis involves colonisation of a heart valve, and rheumatic fever involves an initial bacterial infection by Group A streptococcus followed by a reaction against heart tissue that resembles the streptococcal antigen.|$|E

These changes are proportional to the velocity of the protons' movement through a magnetic field with a known gradient. When using velocity-encoded MRI, the result is two sets of images, one for each time point in the <b>cardiac</b> <b>cycle.</b> One is an anatomical image and the other is an image in which the signal intensity in each pixel is directly proportional to the through-plane velocity. The average velocity in a vessel, i.e., the aorta or the pulmonary artery, is quantified by measuring the average signal intensity of the pixels in the cross-section of the vessel then multiplying by a known constant. The flow is calculated by multiplying the mean velocity by the cross-sectional area of the vessel. This flow data {{can be used in a}} flow-versus-time graph. The area under the flow-versus-time curve for one <b>cardiac</b> <b>cycle</b> is the stroke volume.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{first stage}} in {{computerised}} processing of the electrocardiogram is beat detection. This involves identifying all <b>cardiac</b> <b>cycles</b> and locating {{the position of}} {{the beginning and end of}} each of the identifiable waveform components. The accuracy at which beat detection is performed has significant impact on the overall classification performance, hence efforts are still being made to improve this process. Methods A new beat detection approach is proposed based on the fundamentals of cross correlation and compared with two benchmarking approaches of non-syntactic and cross correlation beat detection. The new approach can be considered to be a multi-component based variant of traditional cross correlation where each of the individual inter-wave components are sought in isolation as opposed to being sought in one complete process. Each of three techniques were compared based on their performance in detecting the P wave, QRS complex and T wave in addition to onset and offset markers for 3000 <b>cardiac</b> <b>cycles.</b> Results Results indicated that the approach of multi-component based cross correlation exceeded the performance of the two benchmarking techniques by firstly correctly detecting more <b>cardiac</b> <b>cycles</b> and secondly provided the most accurate marker insertion in 7 out of the 8 categories tested. Conclusion The main benefit of the multi-component based cross correlation algorithm is seen to be firstly its ability to successfully detect <b>cardiac</b> <b>cycles</b> and secondly the accurate insertion of the beat markers based on pre-defined values as opposed to performing individual gradient searches for wave onsets and offsets following fiducial point location. </p...|$|R
