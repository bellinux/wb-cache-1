Vanvooren would do two more bodies alike, one (Chassis 57808) for the French government, who gave it, in 1939, as a marriage gift of Prince Reza and Princess Fawzia, and another one (Chassis 57749). These two cars are in private collections in the United States.|$|E
50|$|Minor {{change was}} given in 1978. This version of the Crown saw the {{introduction}} of disc brakes at both {{the front and rear}} axles with anti-lock brakes, speed sensitive power steering, and a 4-speed automatic transmission with overdrive. Originally, sedans and wagons had S80-series <b>chassis</b> <b>numbers,</b> while the two- and four-door hardtops received the S90-series <b>chassis</b> <b>numbers.</b> After 1976 and concurrent with the introduction of new stricter emissions regulations, all Japanese market Crowns used S100-series <b>chassis</b> <b>numbers.</b> Export models continued to use the previous codes.|$|R

It was auctioned in February 2009 at the Rétromobile motor show in Paris, France, fetching €3.4 million (~ US$5 million), {{becoming one of the}} highest valued cars in automotive history, owing much to its extremely low mileage, original condition and ownership pedigree.|$|E
25|$|HG {{commercial}} variants {{continued to}} be built and sold alongside the HQ series passenger vehicles until very late in 1971 when the HQ commercials were released. These HG commercials were upgraded to the newer specification HQ 173ci and 202ci 6cyl engines but retained the HG specification transmissions (cable kickdown 6cyl and V8 Trimatics and V8 M21 Saginaw) and V8 engines which {{are believed to have}} been stockpiled in sufficient quantity to cover expected requirements. These HG commercials can easily be identified by the A prefix on the <b>chassis</b> <b>number</b> appearing on the firewall and for vehicles built for sale inside Australia on the Safety Compliance Plate.|$|E
25|$|The 760 Fantasma is {{the fourth}} 760-series Zonda, after the 760RS, 760LH and 764 Passione, and is a rebuilt orange Zonda F which was badly damaged in an {{accident}} in Hong Kong during 2012. The car was originally commissioned by Peter Saywell, <b>chassis</b> <b>number</b> 53, who later sold it to a Chinese businessman in Hong Kong. After the car's accident it {{was sent back to}} the Pagani factory where it was repaired and received all the 760-series upgrades. The central monocoque is the same Zonda F chassis and finished in reddish maroon with the Italian flag running up from its nose like the Zonda Tricolore with the central section left unpainted. The only details remaining unchanged are wheels which are from the Zonda F and the interior.|$|E

25|$|AC Cars also {{produced}} a Le Mans coupé. The {{car was a}} one-off and was nearly destroyed after a high-speed tire blow-out at the 1964 Le Mans race. The car was qualified conservatively second in GT. The race started well with the AC, <b>chassis</b> <b>number</b> A98, maintaining {{its position in the}} top two in GT and even leading the class for a time. This was not to last as an act of sabotage (newspaper in the fuel tank) began to block the fuel filter. The car lost time until this was diagnosed and cleaned out. The car proceeded on at the predetermined conservative lap time and for the next stint remained trouble free. The car was able to match the Shelby Daytona's speed despite running a higher differential ratio (2.88 instead of 3.07) and a lower state of engine tune for reliability (355hp instead of the Daytona's 385hp).|$|E
25|$|As well {{as being}} a {{successful}} racer herself, Patsy Burt and her manager Ron Smith also ran a well-regarded race preparation garage. Their operation, PMB Garages Ltd. (PMB being Burt's initials), of Great Bookham, Surrey, prepared Arthur Owen's winning Cooper T53 car for the 1962 British Hill Climb Championship, and repeated their triumph eight years later with Sir Nick Williamson's F5000 specification McLaren M10A. PMB were, naturally, also responsible for Patsy Burt's own cars {{during the rest of}} her career. The car with which Burt became synonymous, her modified Cooper T59, was built up at PMB Garages in the winter of 1962-63. <b>Chassis</b> <b>number</b> C/PMB/1/63, originally supplied as a 1litre Formula Junior car, was adapted to accept a 2litre Coventry Climax FPF engine by moving the driving position forward. Burt's short stature allowed the larger engine, with its concomitantly larger fuel and oil tanks, to be mounted in the usual position without having to lengthen the car's wheelbase.|$|E
25|$|In 1929, {{during the}} 3rd World Scout Jamboree, he {{received}} as a present a new 20-horsepower Rolls-Royce car (<b>chassis</b> <b>number</b> GVO-40, registration OU 2938) and an Eccles Caravan. This combination well served the Baden-Powells in their further travels around Europe. The caravan was nicknamed Eccles and is now on display at Gilwell Park. The car, nicknamed Jam Roll, was sold after his death by Olave Baden-Powell in 1945. Jam Roll and Eccles were reunited at Gilwell for the 21st World Scout Jamboree in 2007. Recently it has been purchased on behalf of Scouting and is owned by a charity, B-P Jam Roll Ltd. Funds are being raised to repay the loan {{that was used to}} purchase the car. Baden-Powell also had a positive impact on improvements in youth education. Under his dedicated command the world Scouting movement grew. By 1922 there were more than a million Scouts in 32 countries; by 1939 the number of Scouts was in excess of 3.3million.|$|E

25|$|Pedro Rodríguez took a P261 {{back to the}} Tasman Series for {{one final}} time in the 1968 season, and he took second place at the Longford round. But with the {{widespread}} availability of the Cosworth DFV 3-litre V8 in the 1968 Formula One season there was little reason for running with an outclassed and underpowered old chassis in Europe beyond the end of 1967. Nevertheless, <b>chassis</b> <b>number</b> 2615 was fitted with the new BRM V12 engine, the H16's replacement, for a few non-Championship race entries. Its best result was third place in the Grand Prix de Madrid, although {{it was only the}} second race that the car managed to finish all year. Australian driver Frank Gardner attempted to qualify the V12 engined car for the 1968 Italian Grand Prix, but his time was too slow. Ian Mitchell's privateer P261 did appear in the British Formula 5000 Guards Trophy races in 1969, but he failed to finish a single race. Tony Dean drove a P261 in the 1969 Madrid Grand Prix at Jarama. Contemporary reports show that he finished second but only completed 39 out of 40 laps. Peter Gethin broke down on lap 40 and some later reports classify him as second.|$|E
25|$|The AC Ace LM Prototype was {{a single}} piece from the year 1958 with the unusual <b>chassis</b> <b>number</b> LM5000, which John Tojeiro {{designed}} {{on behalf of the}} brothers Hurlock specifically for the AC factory at the 24 Hours of Le Mans and for further long distance racing]. The vehicle was only 737-kilogram and differed fundamentally from the standard model: it had a load-bearing, lightweight, tubular steel frame without the massive ladder structure, a new front axle with single wheel suspension, this time in the form of upper and lower triangular steering with coil spring / shock units, and a newly designed pendulum axle at the rear. The open aluminium body was much flatter, with larger overhangs at the front and rear and aerodynamically rounded with a lowered down front and high tail. It was designed by the body builder Cavendish Morton. The engine/ transmission unit, a tuned production unit, came from the Bristol Type 100D2 / S. After a test ride on the Brooklands circuit, just a few kilometres from the AC factory, the prototype, which was not yet mature, completed two assignments in 1958: in June as a factory car in the Le Mans 24-hour race and in September in the Rudac Racing Team at the RAC Tourist Trophy at the Goodwood Circuit. Due to changes in the regulations, the car was no longer able to compete in the next-class category in the FIA - Sportscar World Championship. The 'Bristol' engine / gearbox unit went back there, the racing car was sold without drive and later rebuilt. It still exists today as a collector's item.|$|E
500|$|At {{the end of}} the 1965 season Tauranac {{was losing}} {{interest}} in this arrangement, reasoning that [...] "it {{was just a matter of}} a lot of effort for no real interest because I didn't get to go racing very much" [...] and [...] "I might as well get on with my main line business, which was selling production cars." [...] Although Brabham investigated using chassis from other manufacturers, the two men eventually agreed that Tauranac would have a greater interest in the Formula One team, which MRD eventually took over completely from BRO. This agreement was not reached until November 1965. Repco delivered the first example of the new engine to the team's headquarters in the United Kingdom in late 1965, just weeks before the first Formula One race to the new regulations, the non-championship South African Grand Prix on 1 January 1966. Rather than build a new car in the limited time available, BRO pressed <b>chassis</b> <b>number</b> F1-1-1965, the sole and unused BT19, into service.|$|E
