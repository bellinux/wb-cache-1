Theophrastus challenged the superstitious medicine employed by the physicians of his day, called rhizotomi, and also the control over medicine exerted by priestly authority and tradition. Together with Aristotle he had tutored Alexander the Great whose military conquests were carried out with all the scientific resources of the day, the Lyceum garden probably containing many botanical trophies collected during his campaigns as well as other explorations in distant lands.

The purposes of these experiments included the evaluation of storage, casting, and handling limits for the Y- 12 Plant and providing data for verification of calculation methods and cross-sections for nuclear criticality safety applications. These included solid cylinders of various diameters, annuli of various inner and outer diameters, two and three interacting cylinders of various diameters, and graphite and polyethylene reflected cylinders and annuli. Of the hundreds of delayed <b>critical</b> <b>experiments,</b> one experiment was comprised of a stack of approximately 7 -inch-diameter metal discs. The bottom of the stack consisted of uranium with an approximate height of 4 - 1 / 8 inches. The top of the stack consisted of beryllium with an approximate height of 5 - 9 / 16 inches. This experiment was performed on August 20, 1963 by J. T. Mihalczo and R. G. Taylor (Ref. 1) with accompanying logbook. Both detailed and simplified model specifications are provided in this evaluation. This fast-spectra experiment was determined to represent an acceptable benchmark.

The opening sentence of the Enquiry reads like a botanical manifesto: [...] "We must consider the distinctive characters and the general nature of plants {{from the point of view}} of their morphology, their behaviour under external conditions, their mode of generation and the whole course of their life". The Enquiry is 9 books of [...] "applied" [...] botany dealing with the forms and classification of plants and economic botany, examining the techniques of agriculture (relationship of crops to soil, climate, water and habitat) and horticulture. He described some 500 plants in detail, often including descriptions of habitat and geographic distribution, and he recognised some plant groups that can be recognised as modern-day plant families. Some names he used, like Crataegus, Daucus and Asparagus have persisted until today. His second book Causes of Plants covers plant growth and reproduction (akin to modern physiology). Like Aristotle he grouped plants into [...] "trees", [...] "undershrubs", [...] "shrubs" [...] and [...] "herbs" [...] but he also made several other important botanical distinctions and observations. He noted that plants could be annuals, perennials and biennials, they were also either monocotyledons or dicotyledons and he also noticed the difference between determinate and indeterminate growth and details of floral structure including the degree of fusion of the petals, position of the ovary and more.
