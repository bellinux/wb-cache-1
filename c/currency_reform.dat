5|$|On April 1, 1864, the <b>Currency</b> <b>Reform</b> Act of 1864 {{went into}} effect. This {{decreased}} the Southern money supply by one-third. However, because of Union {{control of the}} Mississippi River, until January 1865 the law was effective only east of the Mississippi.|$|E
5|$|In March 1948 Rau became {{chairman}} of the German Economic Commission (Deutsche Wirtschaftskommission or DWK), which during this period became the centralised administrative organisation for the Soviet Occupation Zone and the predecessor of the future East German government. The organisation existed {{during a time of}} very difficult challenges coming from different sides. A particularly momentous event during this time was the <b>currency</b> <b>reform</b> of 1948. On 20June 1948 the western German zones introduced a new currency, leaving the eastern zone to use the old common currency. In order to avoid inflation, the DWK under Rau's leadership, was forced to follow quickly with its own reform and issued an own currency too. In doing so, the DWK also exploited the <b>currency</b> <b>reform</b> to redistribute capital by using different exchange rates for private and state-run companies. The disagreement, which of the two new currencies should be used in Berlin, triggered the Berlin Blockade by the USSR and the western airborne supply of West Berlin.|$|E
50|$|On June 27, 1871, {{with the}} {{introduction}} of <b>currency</b> <b>reforms</b> after the Meiji Restoration, the ryō was abolished, and replaced one-for-one with the Yen.|$|R
50|$|In {{the short}} term, the <b>currency</b> <b>reforms</b> and {{abolition}} of price controls helped end hyperinflation. The new currency enjoyed considerable confidence and {{was accepted by}} the public as a medium of payment. The <b>currency</b> <b>reforms</b> had ensured that money was once more scarce, and the relaxation of price controls created incentives for production, sales and earning this money. The removal of price controls also meant shops filled up with goods again, which was a huge psychological factor in {{the adoption of the}} new currency.|$|R
25|$|In the {{immediate}} aftermath of World War II, post-war economic conditions compounded with the then-ongoing Chinese Civil War caused severe inflation across mainland China and in Taiwan, made worse by disastrous <b>currency</b> <b>reforms</b> and corruption. This gave way to the reconstruction process and new reforms.|$|R
5|$|The Zimbabwean dollar {{was first}} redenominated on 1 August 2006 under a <b>currency</b> <b>reform</b> {{campaign}} codenamed Operation Sunrise and involving the motto Zero to Hero. New-style bearer cheques {{of the second}} dollar (ISO 4217:ZWN) was introduced and replaced those of the first dollar (ZWD) at the ratio of 1000 to 1.|$|E
5|$|The Reserve Bank issued Special Agro (Agricultural) cheques from 15 May to 31 July 2008. Although of a {{different}} design and with the intention for use only by farmers, it had {{found its way into}} regular use because of the parallel functions with bearer Cheques and the exponential rise of food prices. Following the 2008 <b>currency</b> <b>reform,</b> Agro and bearer cheques were phased out on 1 January 2009.|$|E
5|$|In 1881, a <b>currency</b> <b>reform</b> {{introduced}} a bimetallic standard, which {{went into effect}} in July 1883. Unlike many precious metal standards the system was very decentralized: no national monetary authority existed and all control over convertibility rested with the five banks of issue. The period of convertibility lasted only 17 months: from December 1884 the banks of issue refused to exchange gold at par for notes. The suspension of convertibility was soon accommodated by the government, since, having no institutional power over the monetary system, there was little they could do to prevent it.|$|E
2500|$|Wang Mang was {{a nephew}} of the Dowager Empress Wang, In AD 9, he usurped the throne, and founded the Xin Dynasty. He {{introduced}} {{a number of}} <b>currency</b> <b>reforms</b> which met {{with varying degrees of}} success.

50|$|Chen Jintao (1870-1939) was a Chinese {{technocrat}} {{educated in}} America. He held various finance-related positions under {{a wide variety}} of Chinese governments. He was finance minister for warlords in Beijing, for Nationalists in Nanjing, and for the pro-Japanese Nanjing Regime. Chen was responsible for improvements in printing and engraving, as well as for various <b>currency</b> <b>reforms.</b>|$|R
50|$|In the Ottoman Empire, {{successive}} <b>currency</b> <b>reforms</b> {{had reduced}} {{the value of}} the Ottoman piastre by the late 19th century so as to be worth about two pence (2d) sterling. Hence the name piastre referred to two distinct kinds of coins in two distinct parts of the world, both of which had descended from the Spanish pieces of eight.|$|R
5|$|Recovery {{began with}} the mid-1948 <b>currency</b> <b>reform</b> in Western Germany, and was sped up by the {{liberalisation}} of European economic policy that the Marshall Plan (1948–1951) both directly and indirectly caused. The post-1948 West German recovery {{has been called the}} German economic miracle. Italy also experienced an economic boom and the French economy rebounded. By contrast, the United Kingdom {{was in a state of}} economic ruin, and although it received a quarter of the total Marshall Plan assistance, more than any other European country, continued relative economic decline for decades.|$|E
5|$|The Union Greenback {{convention}} had reconvened {{at nearby}} Farwell Hall and sent an emissary to the National Greenbackers. The delegates voted {{to join the}} other faction in a special conference committee to work for reunification, then adjourned until 7:30 that evening. While {{they waited for the}} committees to finish their work, the delegates listened to speeches by several prominent Greenbackers, including Denis Kearney, a California labor leader, and William Wallace, a Canadian parliamentarian and advocate for <b>currency</b> <b>reform.</b> Meanwhile, the Credentials Committee voted narrowly to admit the Union Greenbackers, as well as a delegation from the Socialist Labor Party. The Committee on Permanent Organization voted to recommend Richard F. Trevellick, a Michigan trade union organizer, as the permanent chairman of the convention. None of the reports were finished by the appointed time, so the convention adjourned again until 10:45 Thursday morning.|$|E
25|$|Notes {{are issued}} by the Transnistrian Republican Bank (Приднестровский Республиканский Банк) in 2000 {{as part of a}} <b>currency</b> <b>reform,</b> with 1 ruble equal to 1 million (1,000,000) of the old rubles. The notes come in {{denominations}} of 1-, 5-, 10-, 25-, 50-, 100-, 200 and 500 rubles.|$|E
5000|$|From 1944, the Allies printed {{occupation}} marks (also called military marks), decreeing {{that these}} were to be accepted at par with the [...] and the [...] Banknotes worth 15 to 18 bn military marks were issued for purchases by the occupying forces in Germany, and for soldiers' wages. In June 1948, military marks were demonetised {{as part of the}} West German and East German <b>currency</b> <b>reforms.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The [...] "Stonewall" [...] Five-Dollar Gold Coin {{was used}} from early in Confederate history {{until after the}} Great War, when {{hyperinflation}} resulted in the demonetization of Confederate currency. It carried the portrait of Stonewall Jackson. After the <b>currency</b> <b>reforms</b> of the 1920s, the five-dollar bill became known colloquially as a [...] "Stonewall." [...] During the Featherston Administration, the Stonewall was revived as a gold coin.|$|R
2500|$|In 1935, the Central Government enacted <b>currency</b> <b>reforms</b> {{to limit}} <b>currency</b> {{issuance}} to four major government controlled banks: the Bank of China, Central Bank of China, Bank of Communications {{and later the}} Farmers Bank of China. The circulation of silver dollar coins was prohibited, and private ownership of silver was banned. A new currency issued in its place was known as fabi ( [...] , pinyin: fǎbì) or [...] "legal tender".|$|R
25|$|On April 30, 2013, Ford Motor Co. {{launched}} their {{car and truck}} line in Myanmar. Previously, heavy importation taxes had stifled imported car purchases in Myanmar, but due to <b>currency</b> <b>reform,</b> lifting of previous import restrictions, and the abolishment of shadow currency, Myanmar's car market had grown in demand.|$|E
25|$|The Stokes household, {{despite its}} venerability, {{was not without}} its {{concerns}} about broader society. Graham's father {{was active in the}} causes of civil service reform, <b>currency</b> <b>reform,</b> and the replacement of protectionism with free trade. He was also a collector of art and books and a founder of the Metropolitan Museum of Art.|$|E
25|$|While Germany {{struggled}} {{to recover from}} the destruction of the War, the recovery effort began in June 1948, moving on from emergency relief. The <b>currency</b> <b>reform</b> in 1948 was headed by the military government and helped Germany to restore stability by encouraging production. The reform revalued old currency and deposits and introduced new currency. Taxes were also reduced and Germany prepared to remove economic barriers.|$|E
50|$|Before 1928, Chen {{was one of}} the few Chinese {{officials}} considered expert or competent by China’s foreign diplomats. He {{was responsible}} for significant improvements in printing and engraving. The <b>currency</b> <b>reforms</b> of the early Republican period may be credited to Chen. He was a technocrat who diligently served China, apparently indifferent as to whether the government was imperialist, militarist, Nationalist, or collaborationist. His views and motives remain elusive.|$|R

50|$|After the <b>currency</b> <b>reforms</b> of 1948, in the {{beginning}} of the 1950s, the first independent contractors had to build and deliver their goods directly to the department stores and large buying groups. This was the basis for the industrial production and the companies and workshops grew from year to year, even today. On top of that, an unimaginable pent-up demand for these goods was found in the cities bombed during the war and, therefore, sales increased steadily.|$|R
25|$|With {{the initial}} {{planning}} for the Marshall plan in mid 1947, a plan which depended on a reactivated German economy, restrictions placed on German production were lessened. The roof for permitted steel production was for example raised from 25% of pre-war production levels to 50% of pre-war levels. The scrapping of JCS 1067 {{paved the way for}} the 1948 <b>currency</b> <b>reform</b> which halted rampant inflation.|$|E
25|$|After {{the retreat}} of the Kuomintang to Taiwan, the silver yuan {{remained}} the de jure legal currency of {{account of the}} Republic of China, although only Taiwan dollars issued by the Bank of Taiwan were circulating in areas controlled by the ROC. After a <b>currency</b> <b>reform</b> in 1949 created the New Taiwan dollar, the statutory exchange rate was set at 1 silver yuan = NT$3.|$|E
25|$|The {{success of}} the <b>currency</b> <b>reform</b> angered the Soviets, who cut off all road, rail, and canal links between the western zones and West Berlin. This was the Berlin Blockade, which lasted from 24 June 1948 to 12 May 1949. In response, the U.S. and Britain {{launched}} an airlift of food and coal and distributed the new currency in West Berlin as well. The city thereby became economically integrated into West Germany.|$|E
25|$|As of 2015, Cuba {{remains one}} of the few officially socialist states in the world. Though it remains diplomatically {{isolated}} and afflicted by economic inefficiency, major <b>currency</b> <b>reforms</b> were begun in the 2010s, and efforts to free up domestic private enterprise are now underway. Living standards in the country have improved significantly since the turmoil of the Special Period, with GDP per capita in terms of purchasing power parity rising from less than US$2,000 in 1999 to nearly $10,000 in 2010. Tourism has furthermore become a significant source of prosperity for Cuba.|$|R
5000|$|After Wilson {{presented}} {{the bill to}} Congress, a group of Democratic congressmen revolted. The group, led by Representative Robert Henry of Texas, demanded that the [...] "Money Trust" [...] be destroyed before it could undertake major <b>currency</b> <b>reforms.</b> The opponents particularly objected {{to the idea of}} regional banks having to operate without the implicit government protections that large, so-called money-center banks would enjoy. The group almost succeeded in killing the bill, but were mollified by Wilson's promises to propose antitrust legislation after the bill had passed, and by Bryan's support of the bill.|$|R
50|$|The 1950s purges struck hardest at {{the party}} faithful, i.e., the most direct {{beneficiaries}} of the 1948 takeover. The upheaval of nationalization and collectivization efforts that went further {{than anywhere else in}} Eastern Europe, coupled with two <b>currency</b> <b>reforms,</b> signaled a flux in economic fortunes during the first decade of communist rule. A Czech, for example, who was a chief executive in industry in 1948, worked as a carpenter for several years thereafter, served a number of years in prison, and then retrained for a career in law was not exceptional.|$|R
25|$|In 2009, another <b>currency</b> <b>reform</b> was {{initiated}} to tackle hyperinflation and black market activities. Unlike previous reforms, the 2009 move sparked a nationwide panic {{when it was}} announced there would be a two-week waiting period between the withdrawal of the old currency and the introduction of the new currency, coupled with an exchange limit of only 500,000 old won for each person, effectively wiping out savings. The state eventually pulled back on most exchange limits; however, the revaluation proved to be a failure.|$|E
25|$|In June 1953, {{thousands}} of workers in Plzeň went on strike to demonstrate against a <b>currency</b> <b>reform</b> that was considered a move to solidify Soviet socialism in Czechoslovakia. The demonstrations ended without significant bloodshed, disappointing American Director of Central Intelligence Allen Dulles, who wished for a pretext to help the Czechoslovakian people resist the Soviets. For {{more than a decade}} thereafter, the Czechoslovak communist political structure was characterized by the orthodoxy of the leadership of party chief Antonín Novotný, who became president in 1957 when Zápotocký died.|$|E
25|$|In 2016, {{banknotes}} {{were introduced}} in denominations of 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 200, and 500 rubles. On 4 November 2015 the National Bank of the Republic of Belarus announced that the banknotes {{that has been in}} use at that time will be replaced by the new ones due to the upcoming redenomination. The redenomination will be made in a ratio of 1:10,000 (10,000 rubles of the 2000 series = 1 ruble of the 2009 series). This <b>currency</b> <b>reform</b> also brought the introduction of coins, {{for the first time in}} The Republic of Belarus.|$|E
40|$|The {{opening of}} foreign {{trade in the}} mid 19 th century, {{especially}} the opium trade, created a large outflow of silver from China, resulting in increased living costs. This situation, coupled with {{the large number of}} foreign silver flooding the Chinese market, seriously undermined the old minted silver system. At the same time, due to insufficient copper mining at Yunnan and expensive foreign copper, there arose the phenomenon of poor quality coinage flooding the market. Because this system led to a shortage of money, the Qing Viceroy Zhang Zhidong issued banknotes in order to improve upon inadequate coinage in Hubei province. Kuroda Akinobu discussed in his essay two <b>currency</b> <b>reforms</b> in Hubei Province during 1893 - 1902 and 1903 - 1908. He especially focused on currency reform; however he did not go into detail about the silver tickets and other forms of official paper money used in the <b>currency</b> <b>reforms.</b> Zhang Zhidong issued government notes in Hubei Province in 1896. Due to the rough printing technology however, the printed government notes were easily copied, and this quickly led to large scale forging. In order to combat this, Zhang Zhidong decided to customize paper government notes from Japan. This paper will clarify the specific manufacturing method of the bills and other issues imported from Japan by Zhang Zhidong. 研究ノー...|$|R
50|$|In spring 1944, Chiang Kai-shek asked Chang for a {{strategy}} {{as to how}} to prepare for the retrocession of Taiwan after the defeat of Japan. In December 1944, Chang was made Minister of Interior. After the Japanese surrendered in August 1945, he {{became a member of the}} KMT delegation to participate in the Political Consultative Conference to discuss with the Chinese Communist counterparts about China’s postwar reconstruction. In 1948, in the heat of the Chinese civil war, Chang became Vice Premier of the ROC government, burdened with such challenging and difficult tasks as national resources relocations, <b>currency</b> <b>reforms,</b> anti-inflations, and anti-corruptions.|$|R
50|$|It was {{speculated that}} Kim was ousted {{partly because of}} the failed <b>currency</b> <b>reforms</b> which took place in early 2010. According to the South Korean {{newspaper}} Chosun Ilbo, he reportedly apologized publicly for the mishaps before stepping down. Kim's departure and Choe's elevation coincided with the dismissal of various other ministers in the cabinet who were ostensibly blamed for the failed reforms. The event was seen by analysts as achieving two purposes: settling public outcry over the currency valuation fiasco and engineering a political climate more favourable towards the succession of Kim Jong-un, the supreme leader's youngest son.|$|R
