40|$|Thesis (M. Ed.) [...] University of Melbourne, Faculty of Education, 1998 This {{research}} {{investigated the}} extent to which culture learning and the development of cross-cultural skills were incorporated into the foreign language programmes at the Australian Defence Force School of Languages. Data relating to the provision of <b>cross-cultural</b> awareness <b>training</b> was collected through the administration of a questionnaire to selected students from the 1997 general language courses, the conduct of an interview schedule with a representative sample of the staff, and an examination of the School's Curriculum, Syllabuses, and materials used for the teaching of cross-cultural awareness. The research found that <b>cross-cultural</b> awareness <b>training</b> on the various language courses was not derived from an analysis of the needs of students, was concentrated on culture-specific awareness in the cognitive domain, and that there were only limited opportunities for development of cross-cultural awareness in the affective and behavioural domains. Additionally, the research found that course documentation did not provide sufficient guidance to staff on how <b>cross-cultural</b> awareness <b>training</b> was to be treated on the courses and that staff themselves had only a limited understanding of what cross-cultural awareness entailed. The implications of these findings for the School of Languages are threefold: firstly, the School needs to develop a culture-general <b>cross-cultural</b> awareness <b>training</b> programme as a means of enhancing staff cross-cultural. awareness; secondly, cross-cultural awareness programmes for students should be directed at students' needs and, where applicable, contain activities directed at their cross-cultural awareness in the affective and behavioural domains; thirdly, the School's Curriculum and Syllabuses need to provide greater guidance to staff on the manner in which <b>cross-cultural</b> awareness <b>training</b> is to be treated in the School.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the effects of <b>cross-cultural</b> counseling <b>training</b> as a short term treatment approach with master's students in rehabilitation counseling to increase cross-cultural counseling competence with Mexican American rehabilitation clients. Hispanics are projected to be the largest minority group in the United States by year, suggesting that Hispanics and Mexican Americans in need of mental health and rehabilitation counseling services will increase. Demographics studies find Hispanics to have characteristics that are generally correlated with increased prevalence of mental and physical health problems requiring psychotherapeutic services. Although there appears to be a need for counseling services by Mexican Americans, current counseling needs of Mexican Americans are not being adequately met. Cultural encapsulation of counselors-in-training has been identified as contributing to the difficulties experienced by mental health professionals in serving Mexican Americans. This issue of cultural encapsulation and its effects on ethnic minorities generated training recommendations from professional conferences. Using these recommendations as a foundation, the American Psychological Association Education and Training Committee of Division 17 developed minimal cross-cultural counseling competencies to be incorporated into counselor <b>training</b> programs. The <b>cross-cultural</b> counseling competency areas identified along three dimensions; awareness, knowledge and skills. This study investigated the efficacy of a <b>cross-cultural</b> counseling <b>training</b> program designed specifically to increase competence along the dimensions of awareness, knowledge, and skills. The study used a quasi-experimental pre-post test control group design. The study population consisted of 29 master' s students in rehabilitation counseling. Criterion measures were given to all subjects before and after the training. The experimental group received <b>cross-cultural</b> counseling <b>training</b> which combined World View, Intercultural Sensitizer, and Triad training models. Significant differences were not found between groups. However, the experimental group showed a significant within group difference in mean score gains on the dependent variables of skills beyond the. 05 level of confidence. The data suggested that <b>cross-cultural</b> counseling <b>training</b> is effective as a short term treatment approach with master's level students in rehabilitation counseling to increase cross-cultural counseling competence in the area of skills with Mexican American rehabilitation clients...|$|R
