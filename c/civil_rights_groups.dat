5|$|A {{coalition}} of <b>civil</b> <b>rights</b> <b>groups</b> began a court {{challenge of the}} bill in Indiana state courts, and the Daniels' administration defended {{the government in the}} case. The Indiana Supreme Court ruled in favor of the state in late 2007. The petitioners appealed the bill to the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, and that body upheld the State Supreme Court decision in the case of Crawford v. Marion County Election Board. Upon appeal the United States Supreme Court also ruled in favor of the state in April 2008, setting a legal precedent. Several other states subsequently enacted similar laws in the years following.|$|E
5|$|After the September 11, 2001, attacks, the MTA {{exercised}} {{extreme caution}} regarding anyone taking photographs or recording video inside {{the system and}} proposed banning all photography and recording in a meeting around June 2004. However, due to strong response from {{both the public and}} from <b>civil</b> <b>rights</b> <b>groups,</b> the rule of conduct was dropped. In November 2004, the MTA again put this rule up for approval, but was again denied, though many police officers and transit workers still confront or harass people taking photographs or videos. However, on April 3, 2009, the NYPD issued a directive to officers stating that it is legal to take pictures within the subway system so long as it is not accompanied with suspicious activity.|$|E
25|$|The {{wearing of}} blackface {{was once a}} regular part of the annual Mummers Parade in Philadelphia. Growing dissent from <b>civil</b> <b>rights</b> <b>groups</b> and the offense of the black {{community}} led to a 1964 city policy, ruling out blackface. Despite the ban on blackface, brownface was still used in the parade in 2016 to depict Mexicans, causing outrage once again among <b>civil</b> <b>rights</b> <b>groups.</b> Also in 1964, bowing to pressure from the interracial group Concern, teenagers in Norfolk, Connecticut, reluctantly agreed to discontinue using blackface in their traditional minstrel show that was a fund-raiser for the March of Dimes.|$|E

25|$|During the Civil Rights Movement in {{the late}} 1950s and through the 1960s, Louisville was affected, as it had {{maintained}} a segregated society. <b>Civil</b> <b>rights</b> <b>groups</b> had undertaken a variety of actions to challenge that. In addition, black neighborhoods had declined during the economic downturn of the city. Urban renewal efforts undertaken for ostensible improvements had adversely affected {{the center of their}} neighborhood.|$|E

25|$|Racial {{tensions}} in Cleveland were exacerbated {{as the city}} began busing African American children to all-white schools in order to racially desegregate its schools and to reduce overcrowding in minority-majority elementary schools. Black parents were outraged when they discovered that their children were not eligible to participate in arts, sports, and after-hours activities at these schools. In January 1964, the United Freedom Movement, a coalition of black <b>civil</b> <b>rights</b> <b>groups,</b> decided to march on the Murray Hill School in the city's Little Italy neighborhood. When city leaders learned that local white residents intended to stop the march, they feared a riot would break out. The black <b>civil</b> <b>rights</b> <b>groups</b> were persuaded to cancel their protest. But the white mob still formed, and throughout the day on January 30, 1964, white citizens threw rocks and bottles and assaulted any African American person they found on the streets. The Cleveland Police made no arrests.|$|E
25|$|Both Sweden and The Netherlands {{responded to}} the stories around the Mashhad executions by announcing that they would {{immediately}} halt extraditions of LGBT asylum claimants to Iran.

25|$|Although {{initially}} {{touted as}} an economic miracle, by the 1960s, Operation Bootstrap was increasingly hampered by a growing unemployment problem. As living standards and wages in Puerto Rico rose, manpower-intensive industries faced competition from outside the United States. It also faced criticism from <b>civil</b> <b>rights</b> <b>groups</b> and the Catholic Church, who perceived the government promoting birth control, encouraging surgical sterilization, and fostering the migration of Puerto Ricans to the United States.|$|E
25|$|While the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) {{had paid}} {{informants}} in the Klan, {{for instance in}} Birmingham in the early 1960s, its relations with local law enforcement agencies and the Klan were often ambiguous. The head of the FBI, J. Edgar Hoover, appeared more concerned about Communist links to civil rights activists than about controlling Klan excesses against citizens. In 1964, the FBI's COINTELPRO program began attempts to infiltrate and disrupt <b>civil</b> <b>rights</b> <b>groups.</b>|$|E
25|$|D. W. Griffith's 1915 film, The Birth of a Nation, glorified the {{original}} Klan as protecting southern women during Reconstruction, which he {{portrayed as a}} time of violence and corruption, following the Dunning School interpretation of history. The film aroused great controversy; it was popular among whites in the South, was protested against by the NAACP and other <b>civil</b> <b>rights</b> <b>groups,</b> who achieved banning it in some cities, and it garnered much national publicity.|$|E

25|$|On July 1, 1991, President George H. W. Bush {{nominated}} Clarence Thomas for the Supreme Court of the United States {{to replace}} Thurgood Marshall, who had announced his retirement. The nomination proceedings were contentious from the start, especially {{over the issue}} of abortion, and many women's groups and <b>civil</b> <b>rights</b> <b>groups</b> opposed Thomas {{on the basis of his}} conservative political views, as they had also opposed Bush's Supreme Court nominee from the previous year, David Souter.|$|E

25|$|It was {{reported}} in mid-August that some courts were advised by senior justice clerks to deal harshly with offences committed during the disturbances. The advice was said to tell the courts that they could ignore existing sentencing guidelines and hand down heavy sentences. David Cameron defended the courts for handing out tough sentences, while some Liberal Democrat MPs and <b>civil</b> <b>rights</b> <b>groups</b> criticised some sentences being handed down. Groups of lawyers complained that Crown Prosecutors were opposing bail in more cases than usual.|$|E
25|$|In the post-Cold War years, the FBI {{was worried}} more about {{possible}} Communist connections among anti-lynching groups {{than about the}} lynching crimes. For instance, the FBI branded Albert Einstein a communist sympathizer for joining Robeson's American Crusade Against Lynching. J. Edgar Hoover, head of the FBI for decades, was particularly fearful {{of the effects of}} Communism in the United States. He directed more attention to investigations of <b>civil</b> <b>rights</b> <b>groups</b> for communist connections than to Ku Klux Klan activities against the groups' members and other innocent blacks.|$|E
25|$|Moore's {{comments}} led to {{protests in}} front of the state judicial building and drew nationwide criticism from <b>civil</b> <b>rights</b> <b>groups</b> such as GLAAD, the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force, and the Human Rights Campaign. An official complaint with the Alabama Judicial Inquiry Commission was also filed by the Lambda Legal Defense & Education Fund. A year following the case, the United States Supreme Court struck down statutes such as and including the one Moore referred to (prohibiting same-gender sexual relations) as being unconstitutional in the landmark civil rights case Lawrence v. Texas.|$|E
