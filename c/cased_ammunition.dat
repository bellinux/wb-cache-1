50|$|The <b>cased</b> <b>ammunition</b> is more {{advanced}} in development, partially {{due to the}} fewer technical difficulties and the fewer differences with standard ammunition. It has already reached the required technology readiness level of 5. As of 2008, the <b>cased</b> <b>ammunition</b> has been tested {{for a wide range}} of operating temperatures, and it has had over 9000 rounds fired (approximately 6500 rounds of Spiral 1 ammunition, and over 2000 of Spiral 2). The second spiral version of the <b>cased</b> <b>ammunition</b> produced a 33% weight reduction (falling just short of the program goal), while the ongoing development of the third spiral of <b>cased</b> <b>ammunition</b> has achieved a roughly 40% reduction. The third spiral is also 30% smaller than standard ammunition. The improvement by the third spiral of <b>cased</b> <b>ammunition</b> over the second spiral was achieved partially by compacting and consolidating the propellant (thereby allowing a smaller cartridge case and round). Having reached a sufficient technology readiness level, the Spiral 2 ammunition is being prepared for a contracted 2000 round delivery. The <b>cased</b> <b>ammunition</b> has shown itself as a virtually risk free option, with present and potential ability grounded in success. In addition, development of the <b>cased</b> <b>ammunition</b> firing weapon has significantly improved understanding of the weapon action and requirements. Cased telescoped ammunition for the LSAT light machine gun reached technology readiness level 7 after 25,000 rounds were fired in trials in 2011.|$|E

50|$|The Mark 3 was trunnioned as the Mark 1 and Mark 2, but {{was built}} in three {{different}} caliber lengths, 30, 35, and 40, in eight different Mods, Mod 0 - Mod 6 and Mod's 8 and 9. Mod 0 was 30 caliber with Mod 1 being 35 caliber. All 30 and 35 caliber Mods had a liner, 10 hoops, and a jacket. Mod 2 was 40 caliber with only eight hoops. Mod 3 was again 30 caliber but introduced the use of <b>case</b> (semi-fixed) <b>ammunition.</b> The Mod 4 was experimental in that it eliminated the trunnions and used a threaded sleeve. Mod 5s were reworked Mod 1s making them capable of handling <b>case</b> <b>ammunition.</b> As with the Mod 5 the Mod 6 were Mod 2s reworked to handle <b>case</b> <b>ammunition.</b> The Mod 7 was skipped and no drawings exist for this Mod. The Mod 8 was another Mod 2 rework, this time removing the trunnions and using a threaded sleeve. The last Mod was the Mod 9, using a Mod 3 gun and giving it a full length liner.|$|R

50|$|The first cannon {{to contain}} all 'modern' {{features}} {{is generally considered}} to be the French 75 of 1897. It was the first field gun to include a hydro-pneumatic recoil mechanism, which kept the gun's trail and wheels perfectly still during the firing sequence. Since it {{did not need to be}} re-aimed after each shot, the crew could fire as soon as the barrel returned to its resting position. In typical use, the French 75 could deliver fifteen rounds per minute on its target, either shrapnel or melinite high-explosive, up to about 5 miles (8,500 m) away. Its firing rate could even reach close to 30 rounds per minute, albeit only for a very short time and with a highly experienced crew. These were rates that contemporary bolt action rifles could not match. The gun used <b>cased</b> <b>ammunition,</b> was breech-loading, had modern sights, a self-contained firing mechanism and hydro-pneumatic recoil dampening.|$|E

5000|$|Having {{replicated}} Dynamit Nobel's ACR ammunition, the HITP (High Ignition Temperature Propellant—it is hexogen/octogen based {{to decrease}} heat sensitivity) based ammunition was modified to a 5.56 mm round. Tests proved the ammunition's usability, {{and development of}} the weapon was advanced using knowledge gained from the <b>cased</b> <b>ammunition</b> version. The Alliant Techsystems ammunition production team has reduced the production time and costs by reducing from fourteen to two the number of steps used to complete processing. [...] The second spiral of caseless ammunition was rolled out in 2008, with the necessary facilities to produce the ammunition in bulk completed. [...] It has vastly reduced the weight and volume of standard ammunition (by 51% and 40%, respectively), and it has reached the verge of achieving Technology Readiness Level 5. The development of the third spiral was also initiated, with the goal of replacing the propellant binder with a binder more environmentally and cost friendly. [...] It also aims to reduce the heat ablation {{on the inside of the}} weapon by modifying the burn rate of the propellant, and by giving the round an exterior coating to absorb or prevent transferred heat. [...] Benefits the system has gained from using the caseless ammunition go beyond the unparalleled weight and volume reduction to, for example, the lack of ejected shells (which both improves the weapon's protection from dirt and removes any need to 'police' cases after firing). The ammo was still in development as of 2012.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} {{the effect of a}}n {{internal}} explosion of <b>cased</b> <b>ammunition</b> in RC magazine structures. By means of a numerical approach, the main differences between the effect of a bare and cased charge are illustrated. A bottom-up strategy has been implemented which is based on modeling the single fragment impact, and enables to compute a complete structure. The simulations confirm the fact that the cased charge has a more destructive and localized effect than the bare charge. The study shows that the numerical erosion has a small overall effect on the response. The numerical results are compared with preliminary test results...|$|E
40|$|Risk-NL is a Quantitative Risk Assessment (QRA) {{software}} {{tool for the}} external safety of ammunition storage sites. The Netherlands MoD has asked TNO to upgrade Risk-NL with improved models that have recently been developed, and a new user interface. The new models implemented in Risk-NL v 5. 0 are more physics-based, and have {{a higher level of}} detail resulting in a better quantitative discrimination of risks for different scenarios. The most important improvement is the possibility to distinguish between debris from walls and the roof of RC magazines, and between debris and primary fragments from <b>cased</b> <b>ammunition.</b> Also the new model for window failure is a major improvement and has a more sound basis than its predecessor. The combination of the new user interface and the new models in Risk-NL v 5. 0 give unique possibilities to analyze risk, and to investigate options for risk reduction. Risk-NL v 5. 0 also provides possibilities for optimization in the design of new types of magazines and ammunition storage sites. The paper gives a description of the new features and the new possibilities are illustrated with a case study...|$|E

50|$|Small arms {{ammunition}} sabotage {{had previously}} been employed by the United Kingdom against rebellious tribesmen during the Second Matabele War (1896-1897) and the Waziristan campaign (1936-1939). In both <b>cases,</b> <b>ammunition</b> sabotage had been effective because the tribesmen were heavily reliant on salvaged ammunition rather than an industrialized supply chain of newly manufactured ammunition.

At some point during 1971 the Marine Corps found that the small arms <b>ammunition</b> <b>case</b> with the divider flaps was acceptable and initiated acceptance procedures. On 31 January 1972, the army issued military specification MIL-C-28981(MC) and these small arms <b>ammunition</b> <b>cases</b> were type classified and assigned the Federal Stock Number 8465-464-2084.
