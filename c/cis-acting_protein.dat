40|$|We {{isolated}} the matrix attachment region-binding protein (MBP) DMBP- 1 from Dunaliella salina {{in our previous}} studies. MBPs {{are part of the}} <b>cis-acting</b> <b>protein</b> family cluster. The regulatory function possibly works through the interaction of the MBPs with each other. In the present study, DMBP- 1 was used as the bait in screening the D. salina cDNA library for DMBP- 1 interactors that could potentially mediate the DMBP- 1 -regulated functions. A novel MBP, namely, DMBP- 2, was identified as a DMBP- 1 binding partner. The cDNA of DMBP- 1 was 823 bp long and contained a 573 bp open reading frame, which encoded a polypeptide of 191 amino acids. The interaction between DMBP- 2 and DMBP- 1 was further confirmed through glutathione S-transferase pull-down assays...|$|E
40|$|The {{temperature-sensitive mutant}} CRT 46 of Escherichia coli K 12 {{is unable to}} {{initiate}} new rounds of DNA replication at 42 °C. Mutants of bacteriophage P 2 have been isolated, which, in the prophage state, allow mutant CRT 46 to grow at 42 °C. The lysogenic bacteria that grow at 42 °C are apparently replicating {{under the control of}} prophage P 2, which substitutes for the bacterial initiation system. The ability of prophage P 2 cause this suppression phenomenon depends on the position of the prophage on the bacterial chromosome. Those lysogenic strains that are able to grow at 42 °C all carry the prophage close to metE. The P 2 mutants that allow CRT 46 to grow at 42 °C have insertions in the early region of the P 2 genome. The suppression requires the <b>cis-acting</b> <b>protein</b> formed by gene A of P 2...|$|E
40|$|Rare conjugational progeny {{formed by}} {{crossing}} each of five Hfr strains with a recA-F- strain have been characterized. Selection {{was made for}} a proximal Hfr marker, taking strict precautions to prevent transfer of recA+ to the zygotes. Most of the progeny {{were found to be}} F' strains containing deletion mutant plasmids. With two exceptions, these mutant plasmids have lost all of the tra genes, which are required to confer conjugational donor ability upon a host. In addition, all but the exceptional mutant plasmids were found to be very poorly transmissible from transient heterozygotes which also contain a wild-type F' plasmid. The poor transmissibility is a cis-dominant transfer-defective phenotype which may result from deletion of {{all or part of the}} origin of transfer replication (ori), or of a gene determining a <b>cis-acting</b> <b>protein.</b> The two exceptional mutant plasmids may carry short deletions of some of the tra genes or polar tra mutations. The remaining progeny were nonmutant F' strains and F- strains. The frequency with which the F- strains were recovered permits us to estimate that the maximum amount of recombination possible in a recA 56 zygote is 10 (- 6) that of a recA+ zygote...|$|E
50|$|This gene encodes {{a member}} of the non-histone {{chromosomal}} high-mobility group protein family. The proteins of this family are chromatin-associated and ubiquitously distributed in the nucleus of higher eukaryotic cells. In vitro studies have demonstrated that this protein is able to efficiently bend DNA and form DNA circles. These studies suggest a role in facilitating cooperative interactions between <b>cis-acting</b> <b>proteins</b> by promoting DNA flexibility. This protein was also reported {{to be involved in the}} final ligation step in DNA end-joining processes of DNA double-strand breaks repair and V(D)J recombination.|$|R
40|$|AbstractMouse {{hepatitis}} virus (MHV), a coronavirus, generates defective-interfering (DI) RNAs {{of different}} sizes during passages at high multiplicities of infection. All MHV DI RNAs characterized so far contain an open reading frame (ORF) encoding a fused viral protein; in addition, DI RNAs with a long ORF have a competitive advantage over those with a shorter ORF. These findings suggest that DI RNA replication may require an ORF encoding a <b>cis-acting</b> viral <b>protein.</b> In this study, we used a naturally occurring DI RNA and inserted a 12 -nucleotide (nt) amber-mutation linker at various positions to truncate the ORF. Most of the mutants replicated {{as well as the}} wild-type DI RNA, irrespective of the presence or absence and the length of the ORF in the RNA. Sequence analysis showed that all of the mutants retained the insertional mutations even after two viral passages in tissue culture, establishing that the mutant DI RNAs replicated. We have further introduced two 3 -nucleotide substitutions of the first two AUG codons of the ORF, thus completely closing the ORF. This DI RNA replicated as well as the wild-type DL but, after a single passage, the majority of the mutant RNAs was replaced by recombinant RNAs which contain a restored functional ORF. However, an additional insertion of a 12 -nt amber-mutation linker downstream of the AUG substitutions prevented recombination, and the DI RNA still replicated. These data indicate that DI RNA replication does not require a DI-specific ORF encoding <b>cis-acting</b> viral <b>proteins</b> and that a 12 -nucleotide insertion could prevent or delay the occurrence of RNA recombination, suggesting the importance of direct or indirect RNA alignment in homologous RNA recombination...|$|R
40|$|To {{construct}} poliovirus defective interfering (DI) {{particles in}} vitro, we synthesized an RNA from a cloned poliovirus cDNA, pSM 1 (T 7) 1, which carried a deletion in the genome region corresponding to nucleotide positions 1663 to 2478 encoding viral capsid proteins, by using bacteriophage T 7 RNA polymerase. The RNA {{was designed to}} retain the correct reading frame in nucleotide sequence downstream of the deletion. HeLa S 3 monolayer cells were transfected with the deletion RNA and then superinfected with standard virus as a helper. The DI RNA was observed in the infected cells after three passages at high multiplicity of infection. The sequence analysis of RNA extracted from the purified DI particle clearly showed that this DI RNA had the same deletion in size and location as that in the RNA used for the transfection. Thus, we succeeded in construction of a poliovirus DI particle in vitro. To gain insight into the mechanism for DI generation, we constructed poliovirus cDNAs pSM 1 (T 7) 1 a and pSM 1 (T 7) 1 b that, {{in addition to the}} same deletion as that in pSM 1 (T 7) 1, had insertion sequences of 4 bases and 12 bases, respectively, at the corresponding nucleotide position, 2978. The RNA transcribed from pSM 1 (T 7) 1 a was not a template for synthesis of poliovirus nonstructural proteins and therefore was inactive as an RNA replicon. On the other hand, the RNA from pSM 1 (T 7) 1 b replicated properly in the transfected cells. Superinfection of the transfected cells with standard virus resulted in production of DI particles derived from pSM 1 (T 7) 1 b and not from pSM 1 (T 7) 1 a. These observations indicate that deletion RNAs that are inactive replicons have little or no possibility of being genomes of DI particles suggesting the existence of a nonstructural protein(s) that has an inclination to function as a <b>cis-acting</b> <b>protein(s).</b> The method described here will provide a useful technique to investigate genetic information essential for poliovirus replication...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we analyze {{the effect of}} {{mutations}} in three genes, ilvO, ilvA and rho, on {{the expression of the}} ilvEJGDA gene cluster of Escherichia coli K- 12. The ilvO 603 mutation causes a cis-dominant derepression of the ilvEJGDA genes. In particular, the ilvG gene, not expressed in the wild type, becomes expressed in the ilvO 603 strain. We have introduced ilvA mutations (ilvA 454 or ilvA 628) in the ilvO 603 strain and we show that ilvG expression requires the presence in cis of both an ilvO 603 mutation and of an ilvA+ allele. The ilvG gene is not expressed when in trans is present an ilvO+, ilvA+ genotype. However, it is expressed when the chromosome in trans is ilvO 603, ilvA+ (ilvG-). We suggest that ilvO 603 is part of ilvA, the structural gene for threonine deaminase, and that threonine deaminase from the ilvO 603 mutant binds the ilvO 603 site and not the ilvO+ site. Therefore, the ilvA gene product would be a <b>cis-acting</b> <b>protein.</b> Mutations in the rho gene cause derepression of the ilvEJGDA gene cluster without a concomitant expression of the ilvG gene. We show that introduction of either a rho- 218 or a rho- 115 mutation into the ilvO 603, ilvA 454 double mutant causes expression of ilvG. We therefore suggest that the ilvA gene product, threonine deaminase, is involved in termination of transcription as an antagonist of the rho gene product. Introduction of ilvA 454 into an ilvO 603 strain causes also a decrease in expression of the ilvE, ilvJ and ilvD genes. This effect is maximum {{in the case of the}} ilvD gene and we studied it in detail in isogenic strains containing also the rho- 218 mutation...|$|E
40|$|Initiation of R 1 plasmid {{replication}} {{is dependent on}} <b>cis-acting</b> repA <b>protein</b> and the 188 base-pair (bp) sequence, oriR. RepA protein synthesized in vitro preferentially activates oriR in cis, regardless of the orientation and location of oriR on the template DNA. RepA protein is not reusable after it activates oriR in the cis-position. Cis-action of repA protein is also dependent {{on the presence of}} CIS, a 170 bp sequence, between repA and oriR. CIS contains a rho dependent transcription terminator of the repA transcript, deletion of which results in decrease in transformation efficiency and rapid loss of plasmid in the absence of selection. The significance of transcription termination events in replication was indicated by decreased replication activity in vivo caused by premature termination of the repA transcript between repA and CIS. A model which may account for the role of CIS in mediating the cis-action of the repA protein is presented...|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} {{the development of}} an in vitro library selection system (CIS display) that exploits the ability of a DNA replication initiator protein (RepA) to bind exclusively to the template DNA from which it has been expressed, a property called cis-activity. A diverse peptide library is created by ligation of DNA fragments of random sequence to a DNA fragment that encodes RepA. After in vitro transcription and translation, a pool of protein–DNA complexes is formed where each protein is stably associated with the DNA that encodes it. These complexes are amenable to the affinity selection of ligands to targets of interest. Here we show that RepA is a highly faithful <b>cis-acting</b> DNA-binding <b>protein</b> and demonstrate that libraries encoding > 1012 random 18 -mer peptides can be constructed and used to isolate peptides that bind specifically to disparate targets. The use of DNA to encode the displayed peptides offers advantages over in vitro peptide display systems that use mRNA...|$|R
40|$|Replication of the IncB plasmid pMU 720 {{requires}} {{the synthesis of}} the <b>cis-acting</b> RepA <b>protein</b> {{and the presence of}} two DNA elements, ori and CIS. CIS is the 166 -bp sequence separating the RepA coding sequence from ori. To investigate how this organization of the pMU 720 replicon contributes to the mechanism of initiation of replication, mutations in the sequence and/or the length of CIS were introduced into the CIS region and their effects on the efficiency of replication of the pMU 720 replicon in vivo was determined. The CIS region was found to be composed of two domains. The repA-proximal domain, which showed strong transcription termination activity, could be replaced by equivalent sequences from I-complex and IncL/M plasmids, whose replicons are organized in the same fashion as pMU 720. Replacement by a trpA transcription terminator afforded only partial replication activity. The repA-distal domain was shown to be a spacer whose role was to position sequence(s) within ori on the correct face of the DNA helix vis-à-vis the repA-proximal portion of CIS. A model for the loading of RepA protein onto ori is discussed...|$|R
40|$|In {{the yeast}} Saccharomyces cerevisiae, a and α mating-type {{information}} {{is stored in}} transcriptionally silenced cassettes called HML and HMR. Silencing of these loci, maintained by {{the formation of a}} specialized type of heterochromatin, requires trans-acting <b>proteins</b> and <b>cis-acting</b> elements. <b>Proteins</b> required for silencing include the Sir 2 NAD+-dependent deacetylase, Sir 3, and Sir 4. Factors that bind to the cis elements at HMR and HML and that are important for silencing include the origin recognition complex (ORC). Mutations of any of these Sir proteins or combinations of cis elements result in loss of silencing. SUM 1 - 1 was previously identified as a dominant mutation that restores silencing to HMR in the absence of either the Sir proteins or some of the cis elements. We have investigated the novel mechanism whereby Sum 1 - 1 causes Sir-independent silencing at HMR and present the following findings: Sum 1 - 1 requires the Sir 2 homolog, Hst 1, for silencing and most probably requires the NAD+-dependent deacetylase activity of this protein. Sum 1 - 1 interacts strongly with ORC, and this strong interaction is dependent on HMR DNA. Furthermore, ORC is required for Sum 1 - 1 -mediated silencing at HMR. These observations lead to a model for Sum 1 - 1 silencing of HMR in which Sum 1 - 1 is recruited to HMR by binding to ORC. Sum 1 - 1, in turn, recruits Hst 1. Hst 1 then deacetylates histones or other chromatin-associated proteins to cause chromatin condensation and transcriptional silencing...|$|R
40|$|The gamma-herpesviruses persist as latent episomes in {{a dynamic}} {{lymphocyte}} pool. Their consequent need {{to express a}} viral episome maintenance protein presents a potential immune target. The glycine-alanine repeat of the Epstein-Barr virus episome maintenance protein, EBNA- 1, limits EBNA- 1 epitope presentation to CD 8 (+) T lymphocytes (CTLs). However, CTL recognition occurs in vitro, so the significance of such evasion for viral fitness is unclear. We used the murine gamma-herpesvirus- 68 (MHV- 68) to define the in vivo contribution of cis-acting CTL evasion to host colonisation. Although the ORF 73 episome maintenance protein of MHV- 68 lacks a glycine-alanine repeat, it was equivalent to EBNA- 1 in conferring limited presentation on linked epitopes. This was associated with reduced protein synthesis and reduced protein degradation. We bypassed the cis-acting evasion of ORF 73 by using an internal ribosome entry site to express in trans-a CTL target from the same mRNA. This led to a severe, MHC class I-restricted and CTL-dependent reduction in viral latency. Thus, despite MHV- 68 encoding at least two trans-acting CTL evasion <b>proteins,</b> <b>cis-acting</b> evasion during episome maintenance was essential for normal host colonisation...|$|R
40|$|Nos toe punctiforme is {{a member}} of the {{cyanobacteria}} that forms filaments of cells and is capable of cellular differentiation. Previous studies using differential display and GFP expression have shown that aet appears to be active during the process of vegetative cells differentiating into spore like cells called akinetes during periods of nutrient limitation. Bioinformatic analysis of the gene indicates that it is an ATP Binding Casette (ABC) type transporter based on conservation of conserved Walker A, Walker B, and signature sequence motifs. The domain organization of gene, which contains both a nucleotide binding domain and transmembrane domain within the same polypeptide, indicates it is of the exporter group of ABC transporters. GFP transcription studies using the full-length promoter region for the gene, as well as fragments of the promoter containing sequential deletions in their upstream regions, showed that as little as 43 base pairs upstream from the transcriptional start site was sufficient for expression. GFP transcriptional reporters containing the entire intergenic region or truncated versions lacking upstream sequences were all active at a constitutive low basal level in vegetative cells and pre-akinetes, but were not active in heterocysts. Phenotypic analysis demonstrated that the aet insetiional-mutant strain exhibited significantly slower than wild-type growth when exposed to chemicals and antibiotics that destabilize the outer membrane. Complementing the mutant with a wild-type copy of the aet gene in trans resulted in recovery of growth following treatment almost to near wild type levels. These findings indicate the aet gene encodes for an ABC transporter catalyzing cellular export, and that the mutation within this gene is responsible for the observed sensitivity to outer membrane stress. The data strongly indicate that the Aet transporter is responsible for transporting an as-yet undefined component of the bacterial envelope involved in the stabilization of the outer membrane. Transcriptional-reporter studies utilizing promoter-deletion clones indicates that upstream <b>cis-acting</b> transcriptional regulatory <b>proteins</b> are unlikely to be involved in transcriptional regulation of aet, supporting the hypothesis that regulation is achieved solely by developmentally regulated sigma factors associated with the RNA polymerase holoenzyme. Future studies identifying molecular components differing between the outer membrane of the wild type and aet mutant strain will be used to identify the allocrite actually transported by Aet...|$|R
