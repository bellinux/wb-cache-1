40|$|TA (toxin–antitoxin) {{systems are}} widely {{distributed}} amongst bacteria and {{are associated with}} the formation of antibiotic tolerant (persister) cells that may have involvement in chronic and recurrent disease. We show that overexpression of the Burkholderia pseudomallei HicA toxin causes growth arrest and increases the number of persister cells tolerant to ciprofloxacin or ceftazidime. Furthermore, our data show that persistence towards ciprofloxacin or ceftazidime can be differentially modulated depending on the level of induction of HicA expression. Deleting the hicAB locus from B. pseudomallei K 96243 significantly reduced persister cell frequencies following exposure to ciprofloxacin, but not ceftazidime. The structure of HicA(H 24 A) was solved by NMR and forms a dsRBD-like (dsRNA-binding domain-like) fold, composed of a triple-stranded β-sheet, with two helices packed against one face. The surface of the protein is highly positively <b>charged</b> <b>indicative</b> <b>of</b> an RNA-binding protein and His 24 and Gly 22 were functionality important residues. This is the first study demonstrating a role for the HicAB system in bacterial persistence and the first structure of a HicA protein that has been experimentally characterized...|$|R

In this work, a focused ion beam is used to implant antimony donors close to quantum dots. Ion detectors are integrated next to the quantum dots to sense the implants. The numbers of donors implanted can be counted to a precision of a single ion. In low-temperature transport measurements, regular coulomb blockade is observed from the quantum dots. <b>Charge</b> offsets <b>indicative</b> <b>of</b> donor ionization are also observed in devices with counted donor implants...|$|R

40|$|Metallo-β-lactamases are zinc {{containing}} {{enzymes that}} {{are able to}} hydrolyze and inactivate β-lactam antibiotics. The subclass B 2 enzyme CphA of Aeromonas hydrophila is a unique metallo-β-lactamase because it degrades only carbapenems efficiently and is only active when it has one zinc ion bound. A zinc titration experiment was used to study the zinc affinity of the wild-type and of several mutant CphA enzymes. It shows that a second Zn 2 + is also bound at high ion concentrations. All samples were analyzed using mass spectrometry in combination with an automated nanoESI source. The metal-free enzyme has a bimodal <b>charge</b> distribution <b>indicative</b> <b>of</b> two conformational states. A completely folded enzyme is detected when the apo-enzyme has bound the first zinc. Intensity ratios of the different enzyme forms were used to deduce the zinc affinities.

40|$|In {{contrast}} with common non-relativistic lore, the usual Sachs form factors {{are not the}} Fourier transforms of charge or magnetization densities. Instead, the two-dimensional Fourier transform of the electromagnetic $F_ 1 $ form factor is the charge charge density of partons in the transverse plane. An analysis of the available data for neutron form factors leads to the result that the neutron charge density is negative at the center, and that {{the square of the}} transverse charge radius is positive. This contrasts with many expectations. Additionally, the use of measured proton form factors leads to the result that the proton's central $u$ quark charge density is larger than that of the $d$ quark by about 80 %. The proton (neutron) charge density has a long range positively (negatively) <b>charged</b> component <b>indicative</b> <b>of</b> a pion cloud. Comment: 8 pages 4 figures.

40|$|The {{most common}} {{technological}} route for metallurgical silicon production is to feed quartz and a carbon source (e. g., coal, coke, or charcoal) into submerged-arc furnaces, which use electrodes as electrical conductors. We develop {{a mathematical model}} of a silicon furnace. A continuum approach is taken, and we derive from first principles the equations governing the time evolution of chemical concentrations, gas partial pressures, velocity, and temperature within a one-dimensional vertical section of a furnace. Numerical simulations are obtained for this model and are shown to compare favorably with experimental results obtained using silicon pilot furnaces. A rising interface is shown to exist {{at the base of}} the charge, with motion caused by the heating of the pilot furnace. We find that more reactive carbon reduces the silicon monoxide losses, while reducing the carbon content in the raw material mixture causes greater solid and liquid material to build-up in the <b>charge</b> region, <b>indicative</b> <b>of</b> crust formation (which can be detrimental to the silicon production process). We also comment on how the various findings could be relevant for industrial operations...|$|R
40|$|Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) of {{wind turbine}} blades is {{critical}} to improve the reliability of wind turbines. A health monitoring algorithm was developed that utilizes energy harvesters as sensors. An accumulated energy sensor is described in which an energy harvester mounted {{on the surface of}} the wind turbine blade converts low frequency vibrational strain energy from the blade to electrical charge, that is subsequently stored to power an RF transmitter. The premise of this sensing approach is that the timing of data output from the RF transmitter, which is tied to the <b>charging</b> time, is <b>indicative</b> <b>of</b> the structural health. The time between data transmission pulses will be reduced if the blade stiffness decreases. The SHM algorithm compares data transmission time for the three blades to identify the onset of blade damage. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm, an expected energy harvester signal transmission rate is established from blade strain data from a 2. 5 MW wind turbine. The transmission rates for the three blades are compared to establish a threshold for “healthy ” blades. Simulated damage corresponding to approximately 20 % increase in harvested energy can be detected by the SHM algorithm...|$|R
40|$|The {{three-dimensional}} conformation of {{a protein}} {{is central to}} its biological function. The characterisation of aspects of three-dimensional protein structure by mass spectrometry {{is an area of}} much interest as the gas-phase conformation, in many instances, can be related to that of the solution phase. Travelling wave ion mobility mass spectrometry (TWIMS) was used to investigate the biological significance of gas-phase protein structure. Protein standards were analysed by TWIMS under denaturing and near-physiological solvent conditions and cross-sections estimated for the charge states observed. Estimates of collision cross-sections were obtained with reference to known standards with published cross-sections. Estimated cross-sections were compared with values from published X-ray crystallography and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy structures. The cross-section measured by ion mobility mass spectrometry varies with charge state, allowing the unfolding transition of proteins in the gas phase to be studied. Cross-sections estimated experimentally for proteins studied, for <b>charge</b> states most <b>indicative</b> <b>of</b> native structure, are in good agreement with measurements calculated from published X-ray and NMR structures. The relative stability of gas-phase structures has been investigated, for the proteins studied, based on their change in cross-section with increase in charge. These results illustrate that the TWIMS approach can provide data on three-dimensional protein structures of biological relevance. Copyright (C) 2008 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. ...|$|R
40|$|A {{monoclonal}} IgG 2 b(K) antibody, G- 2 A 4, {{has been}} generated against bovine brain myo-inositol monophosphatase (EC 3. 1. 3. 25). The {{identity of the}} antigen recognized by the antibody was established by using e. l. i. s. a. and Western blotting procedures, and by immunoprecipitation of enzyme activity from crude brain supernatant. In addition, the hydrolysis of Ins 1 P by crude brain extract was inhibited by up to 83 % by the pure antibody. Under identical conditions, the hydrolysis of Ins(1, 4) P 2 was unaffected. An immunoadsorbent column containing monoclonal antibody G- 2 A 4 covalently attached to CNBr-activated Sepharose 4 B {{has been used for}} rapid purification of the brain enzyme. Elution conditions have been optimized to allow isolation of the enzyme in high yield (54 %) with full retention of column-binding capacity. The enzyme was electrophoretically homogeneous, Mr 30, 000 and of higher specific activity than that purified conventionally. Chromatography of the pure enzyme on high resolution ion-exchange columns revealed some <b>charge</b> heterogeneity, possibly <b>indicative</b> <b>of</b> some type of post-translational modification. The immunoadsorbent column has also been used to purify the bovine kidney cortex enzyme to homogeneity. Partial proteolytic fragmentation patterns of the brain and kidney enzymes using endoprotease glu-C were identical, suggesting that they are almost certainly products of the same gene...|$|R
40|$|X-ray {{photoelectron}} spectroscopy (XPS), {{secondary ion}} mass spectrometry (SIMS), {{scanning electron microscopy}} (SEM) and in situ electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) {{have been used to}} characterize the interfacial chemistry of the chalcogenide glass ferric (FeIII) ion-selective electrode (ISE). The effects of ferric ions (Fe 3 +) and hydroxide ions (OH-) on the FeIII ISE have been studied and a mechanism for their action is proposed. It has been shown that an elevated hydroxide ion concentration causes the chalcogenide glass FeIII ISE to experience accelerated corrosion. In particular, XPS detected the formation of various antimony and iron hydroxide/oxide species, whereas SIMS and SEM revealed extensive dissolution of germanium selenide from the chalcogenide glass in the presence of OH-. The EIS measurements demonstrated that the rate of charge transfer is facilitated under extreme alkaline conditions, and this is internally consistent with the XPS/SIMS results. By contrast, EIS and XPS aging studies in ferric ion solution revealed a mild passivation film symbolic of an oxide layer. Extended aging of the chalcogenide glass membrane demonstrated a decrease in the <b>charge</b> transfer impedance, <b>indicative</b> <b>of</b> a breakdown in the passive layer properties. It has been shown that a charge transfer reaction occurs between Fe 3 + and Ge 2 + selenide sites in the membrane and that the rate of reaction is strongly dependent on temperature...|$|R
