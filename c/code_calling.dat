50|$|Continuous redial, busy number redial, or repeat dial, is a {{vertical}} service <b>code</b> (<b>calling</b> feature) that allows callers to automatically redial a busy telephone number until a connection is made.

50|$|Also {{in the mid}} 90â€™s, {{researchers}} at AT&T were discussing {{the development of a}} new markup language that would enable the web to be accessed through regular phones. From 1995 to 1999, AT&T, Lucent, Motorola, and IBM all developed their own versions of phone and speech markup languages. These companies created the VoiceXML Forum, and jointly designed the Voice Markup Language, VXML, which was accepted by the W3C Committee in 2000. VXML is typically used to create hyperlinked speech applications. VXML pages include commands for prompting user speech input, invoking recognition grammars, outputting synthesized voice, iterating through blocks of <b>code,</b> <b>calling</b> local JavaScript, and hyperlinking to other remote VXML pages downloaded in a manner similar to the linking of HTML pages in the conventional Web.|$|E

If the caller does not reach, they mark the lead as [...] "no answer" [...] and the system programs it so they get called again a few days later. If the company does not have a large lead pool, they may get called as soon as 12 hours later. As with email spammers, they know that a certain proportion of their hits will score.|$|E

The existing back-end in Redis showed pathological behaviour in rare cases, and a replacement was sought. The baroque API of LMDB was criticized though, forcing a lot of coding to get simple things done however its performance and reliability during testing was considerably better than the alternative back-end stores that were tried.|$|E
50|$|The LC-3 {{provides}} both conditional and unconditional {{control flow}} instructions. Conditional branches {{are based on}} the arithmetic sign (negative, zero, or positive) of the last piece of data written into the register file. Unconditional branches may move execution to a location given by a register value or a PC-relative offset. Three instructions (JSR, JSRR, and TRAP) support the notion of subroutine calls by storing the address of the <b>code</b> <b>calling</b> the subroutine into a register before changing the value of the program counter. The LC-3 does not support the direct arithmetic comparison of two values. Computing the difference of two register values requires finding the negated equivalence of one register value and then, adding the negated number to the positive value in the second register. The difference of the two registers would be stored in one of the 8 registers available for the user.|$|E

5000|$|During his tenure, Margvelashvili came {{to public}} {{attention}} several times. In March 2013, {{he was accused}} by the opposition and student groups of political meddling in academia after his ministry revoked authorization of the Tbilisi-based Agrarian University, run by a foundation founded by Kakha Bendukidze, an entrepreneur and ex-minister in the Saakashvili government. Within two weeks, the authorization to the Agrarian University was renewed after the ministry said that the shortcomings had been addressed. In April 2013, Margvelashvili's announcement {{that the government would}} provide to country's 650,000 school students with text books free of charge was denounced by publishers as a blow to the publishing business and by political opponents as a populist move in violation of intellectual property rights.

50|$|Meller {{drafted the}} FE's {{analyses}} of the marriage regulation reform for the 1913 Hungarian Civil <b>Code,</b> <b>calling</b> for gender equality and equal treatment. She {{was also one of}} the lead organizers of the 1913 ISWA conference held in Budapest and the 1916 Feminist Conference, which officials banned because the women were urging pacifism. That same year, FE urged the Parliament to address the issue of women's employment and training, as there were so many widows and wives of those injured in the war who had become responsible for being family wager earners. When GlÃ¼cklich died in 1927, Szirmai took over her position as co-leader of FE, but had to withdraw due to a family situation, leaving sole leadership of FE under the direction of Meller. Melanie VÃ¡mbÃ©ry served as the secretary of the organization from around 1913 until she removed to the countryside in 1938 to hide from the Nazis; she died in a concentration camp during World War II.|$|E
