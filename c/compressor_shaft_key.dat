40|$|Gas turbine inlet fogging and {{overspray}} (high-fogging) {{have been}} considered the most cost-effective means of boosting a gas turbine’s total power output, especially under hot or dry weather conditions. The result of employing fogging or overspray is indisputably clear − total power output is increased; however, development of the theory and explanation of the phenomena associated with fogging and overspray are not always consistent and are sometimes misleading and incorrect. This paper focuses on reviewing several interesting features and commonly discussed topics, including (a) entropy production of water evaporation, (b) the effect of centrifugal force on water droplets, and (c) whether water droplets can survive the journey in the compressor and enter the combustor. Furthermore, three turbine myths: that fogging/overspray increases the air density in the compressor, reduces the compressor power consumption, and noticeably enhances the gas turbine efficiency, are examined and discussed.

40|$|Magnetic {{bearings}} {{are widely}} used as active suspension devices in rotating machinery, mainly for active vibration control purposes. The concept of active tip clearance control suggests a new application of magnetic bearings as servo-actuators to stabilize rotating stall in axial compressors. This paper presents a first-of-a-kind feasibility study of an active stall control experiment with a magnetic bearing servo-actuator in the NASA Glenn high-speed single-stage compressor test facility. Together with CFD and experimental data a two-dimensional, incompressible compressor stability model was used in a stochastic estimation and control analysis to determine the required magnetic bearing performance for compressor stall control. The resulting requirements introduced new challenges to the magnetic bearing actuator design. A magnetic bearing servo-actuator was designed which fulfilled the performance specifications. Control laws were then developed to stabilize the <b>compressor</b> <b>shaft.</b> In a second control loop, a constant gain controller was implemented to stabilize rotating stall. A detailed closed loop simulation at 100 % corrected design speed resulted in a 2. 3 % reduction of stalling mass flow which is comparable to results obtained in the same compressor by Weigl et al.

40|$|This {{research}} presents techniques {{developed for}} non-intrusive sensing and fault detection in reciprocating compressors driven by induction motors. These procedures are “non-intrusive” because they rely only on {{voltage and current}} signals measured on the compressor power cable. The electrical sensor based method allows for easy and non-intrusive determination of many fault sensitive signals that usually require complicated, expensive, and time consuming operations to measure. The electric signals are processed and used with the inverted dynamic motor model equations and motor parameters (which are also determined non-intrusively) to recover the instantaneous angular speed of the <b>compressor</b> <b>shaft,</b> {{as well as the}} torque of electromagnetic origin provided by the motor. These two intermediate signals and compressor parameters such as crank shaft inertia are then used to solve for the compressor load torque. This load torque signal has high fault diagnostic value because it is composed of pressure and friction torques, and these signals are close to mechanical phenomena of diagnostic interest in the compressor. All these signals are recovered at a fine resolution giving high level of detail on a sub-shaft revolution basis. The use of the load torque signal in determining faults and additional diagnostic information is also given. A procedure for determining the cylinder suction and discharge pressure from the load torque signal and knowable cylinder parameters such as cylinder volume, crank arm length, and gas coefficients is discussed. The load torque signal is also useful directly: for the two piston machine used in the research, symmetry of the twice per rotation peak of the load torque is a valuable diagnostic measure.
