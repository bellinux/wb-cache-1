50|$|In Tripod theory, Preconditions {{represent}} {{aspects of}} the working environment that organisations should try to manage, usually via good leadership, safety culture, and a well-documented and implemented safety management system. For example: fatigue of the workforce can be managed by adequate shift rotas, and policies on shift length and overtime; rushing in order to complete a job <b>quickly</b> <b>can</b> be <b>managed</b> by leaders not sending conflicting messages that prioritize productivity over safety, etc. These weaknesses or failures of leadership, culture or management systems are {{the underlying causes of}} accidents and incidents. They help create, or fail to correct, the Preconditions.|$|R

Improvements can always be made in speed, features, ease of use, etc. In the world of scientific computation, this is even more true. Often a single program must run on several different machines with possibly vastly different architectures. With several people working on a single body of code, things become even more complicated. Duplicate files or only slightly different files accumulate <b>quickly.</b> <b>Managing</b> this constantly growing mass of code <b>can</b> <b>quickly</b> turn into a difficult and time-consuming tas [...] ...|$|R

40|$|Acute vital {{crisis in}} {{end-of-life}} situations {{may result in}} hospitalization and intensive care without recognizable benefit in many cases. Advance directives regarding indications for resuscitation, hospitalization, and symptomatic treatment help ensure that acute complications <b>can</b> be <b>managed</b> <b>quickly</b> and satisfactorily in the patient’s customary surroundings. A plan was designed and implemented in Austrian nursing homes to provide emergency physicians with rapidly obtainable information on the patient’s current situation, and whether resuscitation attempts and hospitalization are advised or not. This palliative treatment plan is arranged by a physician together with caregivers, close relatives, and the patient or his court-appointed health care guardian or holder of power of attorney. Four years after implementation of the plan, a user satisfaction survey was carried out. The majority of participating nurses, emergency physicians and family doctors judged application and design of the palliative treatment plan positively. However, the low response rate of family doctors indicates nonconformity. In particular, the delegation of symptomatic treatment to nurses proved to be controversial. There is still a need to provide up-to-date information and training for health professionals {{in order for them}} to understand advance directives as extended autonomy for patients who have lost their ability to make their own decisions...|$|R
