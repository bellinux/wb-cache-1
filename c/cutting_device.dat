25|$|The {{other end}} of a {{pacemaker}} lead is actually implanted into the heart muscle. In addition leads that have been implanted {{for a decade or}} two will usually have attachments to the patient's body at various places in the pathway from device to heart muscle since the human body tends to incorporate foreign devices into tissue. In some cases such as a device that has been inserted for a short amount of time, removal may involve simple traction to pull the lead from the body. Removal in other cases is typically done with a <b>cutting</b> <b>device</b> which threads over the lead and is moved down the lead to remove any organic attachments with tiny cutting lasers or similar device.|$|E

2500|$|Wrecks {{may present}} {{a variety of}} {{site-specific}} hazards to divers. [...] Wrecks are often fouled by fishing lines or nets and the structure may be fragile and break without notice. [...] Penetration diving, where the diver enters a shipwreck is an activity exposing the diver to hazards of getting lost, entrapment and consequently running out of breathing gas. Management of these risks requires special skills and equipment. [...] Many attractive or well preserved wrecks are in deeper water requiring deep diving precautions. [...] Training agencies recommend {{that at least one}} <b>cutting</b> <b>device</b> be carried in case the diver is entangled with fishing lines, nets or ropes and to have a spare light source in case the primary light fails. [...] If penetrating a wreck, a guideline tied off before entering a wreck [...] and run out inside the wreck is advisable. [...] A guideline can help a diver to find the way out more easily in case of low visibility. [...] For penetration diving, a reserve of breathing gas sufficient to allow the diver to exit the wreck and make a safe ascent in the event of any reasonably foreseeable single failure of equipment is required by training agencies' protocols and scientific codes of practice. Most wreck divers use a minimum of the rule-of-thirds for gas management. This allows for 1/3 of the gas down and into the wreck, 1/3 for exit and ascent and 1/3 reserve. In addition, because of the potential fragility of the wreck, the likelihood of disturbing sediments or disturbing the many marine animals that take advantage of the artificial habitat offered by the wreck, extra care is required when moving and finning. Many divers are taught to use alternative finning methods such as frog kick or modified flutter kick which direct the thrust of the fins away from the bottom where most of the silt is likely to deposit. Good buoyancy control is necessary for safe and non-destructive diving in the environment of a wreck.|$|E

40|$|Limpets (Gastropoda) and chitons (Polyplacophora) feed on epi- and endolithic organisms {{by means}} of the radula, a {{specialized}} feeding apparatus located in the mouth cavity. The radula owes most of its abrasive capability to the presence of numerous mineralized teeth. Here we report on the shape, internal structure, wearing pattern, feeding position, and distribution of hardness and elastic properties of these teeth in an attempt to generate ideas for the innovation of industrial <b>cutting</b> <b>devices.</b> The teeth remain sharp during their entire working-life mainly {{due to the fact that}} wearing preferentially occurs along surfaces formed by the internal structure of the tooth. It is shown that shape, internal structure, positioning and material characteristics concertedly function in minimizing the rate at which the teeth wear down and in maintaining optimal cutting behaviour. Implementation of these self-sharpening characteristics into industrial <b>cutting</b> <b>devices</b> is discussed. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science S. A. All rights reserved...|$|R

50|$|Berry {{thinning}} {{is another}} operation {{performed on the}} grapes, and is used to enhance {{the market value of}} the grapes, increase the grapes' size, and facilitate the bunching process. For berry thinning, an end effector consists of an upper, middle, and lower part. The upper part has two plates and a rubber that can open and close. The two plates compress the grapes to cut off the rachis branches and extract the bunch of grapes. The middle part contains a plate of needles, a compression spring, and another plate which has holes spread across its surface. When the two plates compress, the needles punch holes through the grapes. Next, the lower part has a <b>cutting</b> <b>device</b> which can cut the bunch to standardize its length.|$|E
50|$|The labrum of the larval {{mouthparts}} is {{sharp and}} {{functions as a}} <b>cutting</b> <b>device,</b> with which they penetrate the integument of the selected host, possibly helped by enzymes in their saliva. Once established inside the hosts, the larvae feed on them, passing through second and third instars before pupation occurs. Larval development for tachinids may take between one and three weeks to complete, {{and the death of}} the host does not usually occur until the final stage, when the fly is ready to emerge for pupation. As such, Senostoma are considered koinobiont parasitoids, as they co-exist with a living, functional host during development and avoid feeding on vital organs or other critical tissues until it is necessary for their continued growth.|$|E

50|$|In the United States {{from about}} 1850 till end of 19th century export of ice was {{second only to}} cotton. The first ice box was {{developed}} by Thomas Moore, a farmer from Maryland in 1810 to carry butter in an oval shaped wooden tub. The tub was provided with a metal lining in its interior and surrounded by a packing of ice. A rabbit skin was used as insulation. Moore also developed an ice box for domestic use with the container built over a space of 6 cuft which was filled with ice. In 1825, ice harvesting by use of a horse drawn ice <b>cutting</b> <b>device</b> was invented by Nathaniel J. Wyeth. The cut blocks of uniform size ice was a cheap method of food preservation widely practiced in the United States. Also developed in 1855 was a steam powered device to haul 600 tons of ice per hour. More innovations ensued. Devices using compressed air as a refrigerants were invented.|$|E
