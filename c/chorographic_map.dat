50|$|Floriantschitsch de Grienfeld {{was born}} in Ljubljana. He served {{in a series of}} {{important}} church functions, finishing his career in 1757 as the archdeacon of Stična Abbey. In 1744, he published the first map of Carniola, titled Ducatus Carnioliae Tabula Chorographica (<b>Chorographic</b> <b>Map</b> of the Duchy of Carniola) at a scale of 1:111,000. He also wrote a book on gnomonics and a work on measuring time, and built his own observatory. From his writings it is clear that he was familiar with the methods of astronomy at the time. His two Latin manuscripts, which are held by the National and University Library of Slovenia in Ljubljana, preserve many essays on astronomy and mathematics, tables with instructions for making astronomical calculations, tables and a theory about the movement of the Sun and to some extent also the Moon and the planets for the Gregorian calendar for the Ljubljana meridian, a geometry manual, writings about squaring the circle, and his own observations on the Sun and Moon.|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} {{spans the}} origins of chorography in Greek classical cosmographical and geographical philosophies to contemporary interpretation by visual artists. Chorography is a pictorial map-like descriptor that visually codes the physical and metaphysical constituents of specified place. The art of chorography can be perceived and applied as a visual literacy of place to map and signify the inherent attributes and experience of place. This research investigates the history of chorography through two millenniums of creative imagery and the symbolism of mapped place in visual arts to examine and realise the actuality of a chorographic visual literacy in twenty-first century art praxis. In the Geographike Hyphegesis c. 149 AD, Ptolemy clearly defined the concept, method and purpose of chorography; a qualitative descriptor and interpreter that mapped the tangible and intangible elements of unmeasured place, and which was wholly dependent on artistic skills. By this definition, Ptolemy positioned chorography to be a visual language that communicated and mapped the nuances of place. This research argues that the language remained well recognised in artistic endeavour {{up to and including}} the medieval, Renaissance periods and seventeenth century in western art. Over the centuries and by artistic designation, the <b>chorographic</b> <b>map,</b> as a narrative of place and visual codes, has been a medium used to reflect on and elucidate the pertinent theology, humanist thought, politics and culture of each era. Today, chorography is a named and valid visual language of place, acknowledged, and practiced within fields of archaeology, philosophies of place, new media and humanist geographies. However, within twenty-first century visual art theory and practice, the role of chorography by name is almost unrecognised and forgotten. This research recognises the gap in knowledge and argues that the essence of chorographic intent remains very evident in current practice. In addition, this thesis argues that creative works where conceptual forms of coded maps relate to place can demonstrate chorographic attributes and continue to evoke Ptolemy’s premise. To position chorography as a valid visual literacy of place in theory and praxis within twenty-first century creative arts, key arguments are brought through interdisciplinary investigations to determine purposes and methods of chorography as a signifier of place. Created in either traditional media or the multimedia of today’s technological world, these qualitative mappings, albeit either real or allegorical, remain linked to place as visual interpreters of its values and issues. Moreover, the argument references artists who map place and appropriate and re-constitute the medieval, Renaissance and early modern chorographic semantics, symbols and iconic descriptors of place to visualise concerns related to modern culture and society. Additionally, this researcher viewed and considered medieval and Renaissance chorographs and mappings from contemporary studio practices on site in international and Australian repositories. This investigation begins with the examination of chorography’s evolvement through classical Greek philosophies of cosmographies. The study charts and discusses the symbolic authority of chorography as a visual literacy constructed for and conditioned by the changing beliefs, culture and political overtones of ancient to contemporary society. The discourse appraises the quite sophisticated and semiotic abstractions of place that reflect beliefs mapped by theological chorographs, the metaphysical T-O and mappaemundi. The research then explores and assesses the ways Renaissance chorographers, deeply influenced by Ptolemy’s Geographia, brought overt secular and political symbolism to this art of place. Discussed within this context too are chorography's affiliation with the invention of the printing press and reasons for chorography’s displacement as a descriptor of place within visual arts that began {{at the end of the}} early modern period. Results from this analysis provide a clear understanding of the visual literacy of chorography and the methods of symbolism used to delineate place and its intricate elements, both tangible and intangible. This determination allows for the selection of criteria to assess selected contemporary art works that well may be read as chorographic. In addition, this understanding underpins the researcher’s creation of chorographic artwork, an important correlation to the research. The researcher’s qualitative mappings present a particular region and its elements of North West Queensland by the use of chorographic principles and language, shaped by personal knowledge and experience. In this way, the practice-based component of the research, as a case study, argues for a way forward for the recognition of chorography as a contemporary language of place within contemporary art...|$|E
5000|$|The four <b>chorographic</b> <b>maps</b> of the [...] 1037 {{manuscript}} of al-Khwārizmī—including {{that of the}} Island of the Jewel—are the oldest surviving maps from the Islamic world. Al-Khwārizmī gave the Island of the Jewel as the easternmost point of the inhabited world. His gazetteer is divided by categories but altogether he provides coordinates for its coast, three cities, its surrounding chain of mountains, and two summits on the interior. It lies in the Sea of Darkness near the equator, east of his equivalent of Ptolemy's Golden Peninsula (Malaysia) and east of the still larger phantom peninsula—now usually known as the Dragon's Tail—which replaced Ptolemy's unknown eastern shore of the Indian Ocean. Its center was given at 173° east of al-Khwārizmī's prime meridian off west Africa and 2° north of the equator.|$|R
40|$|This article {{discusses}} {{the emergence of}} Italy as a discrete object in the Mediterranean {{in the history of}} Western cartography. In particular, it focuses on different coexisting Renaissance mapping traditions that rested on two opposed spatial understandings and experiences of the basin: on the one hand, as a functional region and a sequence of interconnected places grounded in an older Ancient and Medieval tradition of itineraries, mappae mundi and portolan charts; on the other, as a compact geographical area defined by forms and dimensions (through Ptolemaic <b>chorographic</b> <b>mapping).</b> These two different spatial understandings persist in contemporary debates {{about the nature of the}} Mediterranean region. The latter can be likened to the “great Mediterranean body,” or formal organic unit conceived by Braudel. The former is a vision “from the sea” in line with the “functional” approach recently proposed by Peregrine Horden and Nicholas Purcell, who portray the Mediterranean as a space made of coastal flows and connectivities between “microregions. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{subject of}} this {{dissertation}} {{is the nature of}} the environmental transformations, both symbolic and physical, that took place in Colombia between 1850 and 1930. This period begins with the attempt by the Colombian elite to leave behind colonial ties, overcome economic disorganization, and link Colombia to the international market. These efforts were part of a general project to “civilize” this tropical country. The period closes with the transition toward an industrialization and urbanization process led by the Colombian state during the 1930 s. ^ Frequently, environmental studies as an academic field are dominated by biological concerns. However, most environmental thinking accepts their interdisciplinary nature. Under this framework not only spatial but also symbolic concerns are key elements in understanding environmental transformations. ^ This study finds that despite several attempts to transform the Colombian landscape physically, most of the substantive changes were localized and circumscribed to the Andean region. Other changes were mainly symbolic. This dissertation thus uses the Amazon as one of several regions that did not experience significant changes in the forest canopy. While highlanders originally dreamed of the Amazon as an untapped El Dorado, their failed attempts to exploit the region caused them to imagine it as a nightmarish “green hell”. ^ This dissertation concentrates on three pairs of concepts: tropicality/civilization, landscape/territory, and symbolic/material changes. It presents both a general vision of Colombia and case studies of three regions: Cundinamarca, and Cauca Valley are used to compare with the Amazon region that is developed at length. Whereas mainstream Colombian histories have either fixated on the Andean highlands or, in a relegated second place, on the Caribbean region, this dissertation attempts to significantly contribute to the historiography of Colombia by focusing on the largely neglected Amazonian region. ^ To understand imageries about Colombia 2 ̆ 7 s landscape, the dissertation relies on travel writings, <b>chorographic</b> descriptions and <b>maps.</b> It also makes uses legal documents and other published primary sources, including literary pieces and memoirs. ...|$|R
