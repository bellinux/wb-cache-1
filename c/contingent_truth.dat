Scientific essentialism is a doctrine that seems to dissolve this puzzle, by showing that laws of nature are actually metaphysically necessary. I argue that even if the metaphysics of natural kinds and properties offered by scientific essentialism is correct, there are still some metaphysically <b>contingent</b> <b>truths</b> that share the modal character of the laws of nature. I argue that these <b>contingent</b> <b>truths</b> should be considered laws of nature. So even if scientific essentialism is true, at least some laws of nature are metaphysically contingent...|$|R

40|$|If {{we want to}} give {{an account}} of the {{relation}} between those truths which have truthmakers and those portions of reality which make them true, {{a good place to start}} is with the notion of necessitation, which can be defined thus: x necessitates p if and only if: x exists and (that x exists entails that p). It is then tempting to embrace a simple definition of truthmaking along the following lines [4]: (A) x makes p true if and only if: x necessitates p. This definition is, unfortunately, subject to two sorts of difficulties, which we can refer to as Restall’s refrigerator and John’s funeral. The first consists in the fact that the view of truthmakers as necessitators implies that every contingently existing entity is a truthmaker for every necessary truth: Restall’s refrigerator, in particular, is a truthmaker for ‘ 1 + 1 = 2 ’ [5]. The second consists in the fact that, if a portion of reality is a necessitator for some <b>contingent</b> <b>truth</b> p, then by the transitivity of entailment it is a necessitator also for all those contingent truths which are entailed by p. John’s funeral, in particular, is a truthmaker for ‘John i...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Bernard Williams {{has argued}} that, because belief aims at getting the truth right, it is a {{conceptual}} truth that we cannot directly will to believe. Many others have adopted Williams ’ claim that believers necessarily respect truth-conducive reasons and evidence. By presenting increasingly stronger cases, I argue that, on the contrary, believers can quite consciously disregard {{the demand for}} truth-conducive reasons and evidence. The irrationality {{of those who would}} directly will to believe is not any greater than that displayed by some actual believers. So, our inability to directly will to believe is a <b>contingent</b> <b>truth</b> (at best). It is more conformable to the ordinary wisdom of nature to secure so necessary an act of the mind, by some instinct or mechanical tendency, which may be infallible in its operations, may discover itself at the first appearance of life and thought, and may be independent of all the laboured deductions of the understanding. [...] David Hume 1 Hume famously argued that reason alone could never justify the acceptance of inductive judgments. But Hume coupled this skepticism with the observation that, fortunately, our nature ignores this limitation of rationality and instinctively forces us to accept such judgments anyway.

40|$|In 'Reference and Contingency', Monist 62 (1979) pp. 161 - 89, Gareth Evans {{tried to}} explain how a priori {{knowledge}} of contingent truths is possible by arguing that indexical features of the truths in question make them contingent only in a superficial sense. In 'The Contingent A Priori: Has it Anything to do with Indexicals?', ANALYSIS 46. 3, June 1986, pp. 113 - 7, I suggested that his explanation is inadequate, since a priori knowledge is also possible of deeply contingent truths with no relevant indexical features. Graham Oppy disagrees; in 'Williamson and the Contingent A Priori', ANALYSIS 47. 4, October 1987, pp. 188 - 93, {{he claims to have}} detected hidden indexicality in my examples. I argued that beliefs formed by the following method (M) constitute a priori knowledge: (M) Given a valid deduction from the premiss that someone believes that P to the conclusion that P, believe that P.

40|$|In {{this paper}} I {{undermine}} the Entailment Principle {{according to which}} if an entity is a truthmaker for a certain proposition and this proposition entails another, then the entity in question is a truthmaker for the latter proposition. I argue that the two most promising versions of the principle entail the popular but false Conjunction Thesis, namely that a truthmaker for a conjunction is a truthmaker for its conjuncts. One promising version of the principle understands entailment as strict implication but restricts the field of application of the principle to purely <b>contingent</b> <b>truths</b> (i. e. those that contain no necessary proposition at any level of analysis). But a conjunc-tion of purely <b>contingent</b> <b>truths</b> strictly implies its conjuncts. So {{this version of the}} principle is committed to the Conjunction Thesis. The same is true of the version of the principle where entailment is understood in the sense of systems T, R, and E of relevant logic, since in these systems conjunctions entail their conjuncts.

40|$|André Gallois ’ (1993) {{modified}} {{account of}} restrictedly rigid designators (RRDs) does indeed block the objection I made to his original account (Gallois 1986; Ramachandran 1992). But, as I shall now show, {{there is a}} deeper problem with his approach which his modification does not shake off. The problem stems from {{the truth of the}} following compatibility claim: (CC) A term’s restrictedly rigidly designating (RR-designating) an object x is compatible with it designating an object y in a world W where x exists but is distinct from y. 1 It follows from (CC) that the necessary (<b>contingent)</b> <b>truth</b> of a sentence of the form “α is identical with β”, where “α ” and “β ” are RRDs of objects x and y respectively, does not require the necessary (contingent) identity of x and y. This is borne out by Gallois’ original example (see 1986, p. 58 - 63). Taking W to be the actual world, we have: (1) “Mary is identical with Mary ” is necessarily true; yet “Mary ” RRdesignates Mary and Alice, which are only contingently identical. 1 I leave it to the reader to check that in Gallois ’ own example (1986, p. 58), on the view he defends (pp. 62 - 63), and despite his modified characterisation of restricted rigidity, RDC# (1993, p. xx), “Mary ” RR-designates Alice (as well as Mary) in W, but designates Mary and not A/ice in W 1. Gallois has accepted this in correspondence. In light of (CC), while I agree with Gallois (1993, p. 153) that: (7) (a=b & ◊(a≠b)) → (∃x) (∃y) (x=y & ◊(x≠y)) is a theorem given RDC#, I dispute his defence of it (on p. 153). For, if (CC) is correct, the antecedent of (7) could be true even though a and b are identical in every world (where either exists) ...|$|E
40|$|My {{main purpose}} {{in this article}} is to present an {{argument}} for the idea that necessity qua truth in all possible worlds, without other qualifications, leads us to contradiction. If {{we do not want to}} accept the contradiction, we will face a dilemma: or accepting that everything we take as contingent is in fact necessary, or accepting that we cannot translate some sentences – at least the indexed to worlds sentences – to the possible worlds vocabulary. We have an intuition – and we develop an argument for it – that if “P”, evaluated in w*, is a <b>contingent</b> <b>truth,</b> so it cannot be the case that “P in w*” is a necessary truth. Generally, the argument tries to show that “P”, evaluated in w*, and “P in w*” are made true by the same contingent fact. If we suppose that “P in w*” is necessary, we would have to suppose that the fact that makes it true is also necessary, which would be contradictory with the fact that makes “P” true in w*, if we accept that what makes “P” in w* and “P in w*” true is the same fact. I attain such an aim by presenting an argument that is divided in two parts, one to imply the contradiction and the other to show that there is no relevant difference between the indicated sentences, by showing how the dilemma arises, and by answering some possible objections. This is an important objective because the possible worlds vocabulary is the default vocabulary to treat the modalities of necessity and possibility. And if it is flawed, it is important that we identify the flaw and fix it – which is exactly what we intend to do at the end of this article, by suggesting some qualification at the necessity notion, that the necessity is the native truth in all possible worlds. And this would save the possible worlds vocabulary from the presented objection...|$|E
