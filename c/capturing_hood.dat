40|$|In this paper, a {{numerical}} method {{for the design}} of free opening hoods in industrial and domestic applications is presented. The method is based on a CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics) formulation for the capturing velocity assessment in capturing hoods which account for geometrical and viscous effects. Different hoods, which differ in shape (square and rectangular) and size, are created and their velocity field determined numerically. A comparison between the obtained numerical results and results obtained from empirical formula found in literature are presented and the discrepancy between them highlighted. Then, starting from the numerical results, a new equation, which takes into account viscous effects, is proposed, together with its range of applicability and its level of confidence. The suggested equation is simple in nature and it can be user friendly for the designer, in order to predict the air velocity in front of a <b>capturing</b> <b>hood,</b> and therefore to correctly and efficiently design the ventilation system...|$|E

Results were analyzed to quantify the impact of various device- and installation-dependent parameters on CE. Measured maximum airflows were 70 % or lower than values noted on product literature for 10 of the devices. Above-the-cooktop devices with flat bottom surfaces (no <b>capture</b> <b>hood)</b> – including exhaust fan/microwave combination appliances – were found to have much lower CE at similar flow rates, compared to devices with <b>capture</b> <b>hoods.</b> For almost all exhaust devices and especially for rear-mounted downdraft exhaust and microwaves, CE was substantially higher for back compared with front burner use. Flow rate, {{and the extent to which}} the exhaust device extends over the burners that are in use, also had a large effect on CE. A flow rate of 95 liters per second (200 cubic feet per minute) was necessary, but not sufficient, to attain capture efficiency in excess of 75 % for the front burners. A-weighted sound levels in kitchens exceeded 57 dB when operating at the highest fan setting for all 14 devices evaluated for sound performance...|$|R

40|$|The {{installed}} {{performance of}} cooking exhaust fans was evaluated through residential field experiments conducted on {{a sample of}} 15 devices varying in design and other characteristics. The sample included two rear downdraft systems, two under-cabinet microwave over range (MOR) units, three different installations of an under-cabinet model with grease screens across the bottom and no <b>capture</b> <b>hood,</b> two devices with grease screens covering {{the bottom of a}} large <b>capture</b> <b>hood</b> (one under-cabinet, one wall-mount chimney), four under-cabinet open hoods, and two open hoods with chimney mounts over islands. Performance assessment included measurement of airflow and sound levels across fan settings and experiments to quantify the contemporaneous capture efficiency for the exhaust generated by natural gas cooking burners. Capture efficiency is defined as the fraction of generated pollutants that are removed through the exhaust and thus not available for inhalation of household occupants. Capture efficiency (CE) was assessed for various configurations of burner use (e. g., single front, single back, combination of one front and one back, oven) and fan speed setting. Measured airflow rates were substantially lower than the levels noted in product literature for many of the units. This shortfall was observed for several units costing in excess of $ 1000. Capture efficiency varied widely (from < 5 percent to roughly 100 percent) across devices and across conditions for some devices. As expected, higher capture efficiencies were achieved with higher fan settings and the associated higher air flow rates. In most cases, capture efficiencies were substantially higher for rear burners than for front burners. The best and most consistent performance was observed for open hoods that covered all cooktop burners and operated at higher airflow rates. The lowest capture efficiencies were measured when a front burner was used with a rear backdraft system or with lowest fan setting for above the range systems that do not cover the front burners...|$|R

40|$|The {{emissions}} {{of various types}} ot greenhouse gases (GHGs) from natural and industrial sources are undergoing a great deal ot scrutiny around the world. The three main GHGs that are of most concern are carbon dioxide (CO 2), nitrous oxide (N 2 O) and methane (CH 4).

40|$|AbstractFume and hygiene hoods {{are widely}} used to prevent {{fugitive}} emissions from charge ports, tap holes and many other openings in mineral processing and smelting vessels. The highly buoyant nature of the fume combined with often complex geometries {{make the design of}} these hoods difficult with traditional engineering tools. However, by combining the traditional engineering approach with computational fluid dynamics (CFD) techniques, a clear understanding of the shortfalls of an existing system can be obtained, and an optimised hood design can be achieved. This paper reports on a combined engineering and CFD analysis of a fume extraction system for a zinc slag fumer charge port. The engineering model revealed that the existing plant components (bag house and fan) were not capable of capturing the required amount of fume, and that the original hood design was flawed. The CFD model was then used to predict the fume capture and emission from the existing hood. CFD model predictions showed that increasing the draft flow rate by an order of magnitude would only give a marginal improvement in fume capture. Using findings of both the models enabled a new fume <b>capture</b> <b>hood</b> to be designed. CFD analysis of the new hood revealed that a significant improvement in fume capture is possible. Construction and installation of the hood has been performed and a 65 % reduction in fume emission was achieved, thus significantly mitigating a long-standing emission problem...|$|R
40|$|This {{study is}} {{conducted}} {{to investigate the}} effect of the air flow rate of cassette ceiling air conditioning on the ventilation effectiveness in lecture room. This study was done by analyzing the measurement data based on experiments conducted in the lecture room using measuring equipments such as Velocicalc, Accubalance <b>Capture</b> <b>Hood</b> and Q-Trak. Parameters consider in this study is CO 2, CO, relative humidity (RH), air flow rate, air velocity and temperature. Nine points had been selected to calculate the average parameters value and the experiment was carried out repetitively with different air flow rates (low, medium and high). Despite of 80 students occupied the room with two out of ceiling cassette air-conditioning in these experiments were not unable to fully operate with its maximum performance, the result obtained shows that the lecture room’s concerning parameters for indoor air quality was still under the allowable limit suggested by ASHRAE for all investigated flow rate. The increase in flow rate should increase the ventilation effectiveness, since the indoor CO 2 concentration was oppositely decreased as the flow rate increased. However, through simple mass balance calculation, the ventilation effectiveness for pollutant removal was calculated only on pollutant dispersion. This is caused by the simple mass equation derived from 1 D steady state and cannot predict 3 D effect such as the recirculation and stagnation zone. It is suggested to investigate this study through CFD analysis to understand the 3 D effect for more accurate ventilation effectiveness analysis...|$|R

40|$|During {{the casting}} of {{ferromanganese}} alloys from electric arc furnaces into sand beds at temperatures {{of up to}} 1800 °C {{a considerable amount of}} very brown fumes are generated when the alloy fume is oxidized in the atmosphere. The fume is difficult to capture because of the large flux of gas that is generated. Possible reasons for this flux include the high evaporation rate of Mn at elevated temperatures, the large surface area of the casting beds and the large thermal plumes over the furnace tapholes and casting beds. It has been found that the use of fine water sprays {{along the edge of the}} roof that covers the casting bed resulted in a significant reduction in visible emissions. This paper describes research into the kinetics of the fume to improve the design of the <b>capture</b> <b>hoods,</b> as well as the mechanism of suppression by the water sprays by using CFD analysis. It is shown that the oxidation reaction produces less than 20 % of the energy content of the plume over the arc furnace taphole, and also that radiation heat transfer may play an important role in increasing the energy content of the taphole plume. The capture of fume particles by fine spray droplets is shown to have limited efficiency, while the heat sink that is caused by evaporation does not materially contribute to the circulation of fume through the spray. It is postulated that the increased moisture content of the air over the casting beds may be instrumental in reducing the oxygen partial pressure or in the formation of an oxide layer, both of which would reduce metal evaporation and, therefore fume formation. The exact mechanism requires further investigation. [URL]...|$|R

The fans for the wet system had been an ongoing maintenance problem with frequent outages due to build-up problems. The scrubber fans were approximately 20 years old while the dust collector was 14 years old. The two scrubber fans were rated at 50, 000 cfm at 55 in. wg (inches water gauge).
