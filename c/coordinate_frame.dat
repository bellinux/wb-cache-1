The position of a particle is defined as the coordinate vector from the origin of a <b>coordinate</b> <b>frame</b> to the particle. For example, consider a tower 50 m south from your home, where the <b>coordinate</b> <b>frame</b> is located at your home, such that East is the x-direction and North is the y-direction, then the coordinate vector {{to the base of the}} tower is r = (0, −50, 0).

25|$|In astronomy, Lagrangian {{points are}} five {{positions}} in the orbital plane of two large orbiting bodies where a small object affected only by gravity can maintain a stable position relative to the two large bodies. The first three Lagrangian points (L1, L2, L3) lie along the line connecting the two large bodies, while the last two points (L4 and L5) each form an equilateral triangle with the two large bodies. The L4 and L5 points, although they correspond to maxima of the effective potential in the <b>coordinate</b> <b>frame</b> that rotates with the two large bodies, are stable due to the Coriolis effect. The stability can result in orbits around just L4 or L5, known as Tadpole orbits, where trojans can be found. It can also result in orbits that encircle L3, L4, and L5, known as horseshoe orbits.|$|E
25|$|Apollonius of Perga, in On Determinate Section, {{dealt with}} {{problems}} {{in a manner that}} may be called an analytic geometry of one dimension; with the question of finding points on a line that were in a ratio to the others. Apollonius in the Conics further developed a method that is so similar to analytic geometry that his work is sometimes thought to have anticipated the work of Descartes by some 1800 years. His application of reference lines, a diameter and a tangent is essentially no different from our modern use of a <b>coordinate</b> <b>frame,</b> where the distances measured along the diameter from the point of tangency are the abscissas, and the segments parallel to the tangent and intercepted between the axis and the curve are the ordinates. He further developed relations between the abscissas and the corresponding ordinates that are equivalent to rhetorical equations of curves. However, although Apollonius came close to developing analytic geometry, he did not manage to do so since he did not take into account negative magnitudes and in every case the coordinate system was superimposed upon a given curve a posteriori instead of a priori. That is, equations were determined by curves, but curves were not determined by equations. Coordinates, variables, and equations were subsidiary notions applied to a specific geometric situation.|$|E

2500|$|A body in {{free fall}} (which by {{definition}} entails no aerodynamic forces) {{near the surface}} of the earth has an acceleration approximately equal to 9.8 m s−2 with respect to a <b>coordinate</b> <b>frame</b> tied to the earth.

2500|$|In {{mathematics}} and physics, the Christoffel symbols are {{an array of}} numbers describing a metric connection. The metric connection is a specialization of the affine connection to surfaces or other manifolds endowed with a metric, allowing distances to be measured on that surface. [...] In differential geometry, an affine connection can be defined without any reference to a metric, and many additional concepts follow: parallel transport, covariant derivatives, geodesics, etc. also do not require {{the concept of a}} metric. However, when a metric is available, these concepts can be directly tied to the [...] "shape" [...] of the manifold itself; that shape is determined by how the tangent space is attached to the cotangent space by the metric tensor. Abstractly, one would say that the manifold has an associated (orthonormal) frame bundle, with each [...] "frame" [...] being a possible choice of a <b>coordinate</b> <b>frame.</b> An invariant metric implies that the structure group of the frame bundle is the orthogonal group [...] As a result, such a manifold is necessarily a (pseudo-)Riemannian manifold.

Additional concepts, such as parallel transport, geodesics, etc. can then be expressed in terms of Christoffel symbols.|$|E
