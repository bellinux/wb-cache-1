40|$|In this paper, a linguistically {{rule-based}} letter-to-sound (LTS) {{conversion algorithm}} is described for Galician language. A {{complete set of}} phonological transcription rules regarding the Galician standard variety is presented. A SAMPA <b>computer</b> readable <b>phonetic</b> <b>alphabet</b> for Galician is also proposed. The algorithm was implemented and tested by using CORGA text materials. The obtained experimental results gave rise to 98. 5 % of accuracy rate. The main errors were identified and possible solutions are discussed {{in order to increase}} this value. It is also demonstrated in our work that there is a very good matching between Galician, European Portuguese and Brazilian Portuguese LTS conversion algorithms. Our purpose with this work is to develop a module that can improve synthetic speech naturalness in Galician. Other applications of this system can be expected like language teaching/learning. These results, have proved the dramatic importance of linguistic knowledge on the development of Text-to-Speech systems (TTS) ...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{identify}} the pronunciation problems faced by ESL learners and to investigate the effect of <b>phonetic</b> <b>alphabet</b> training on ESL learners’ pronunciation of English words. This study constitutes a pre-test, an intervention (<b>phonetic</b> <b>alphabet</b> training), and a post-test. At the pre-test, the participants were given a test to diagnose their pronunciation problems. At the intervention, the participants who have never received any instruction on <b>phonetic</b> <b>alphabets</b> were given <b>phonetic</b> <b>alphabet</b> training for nine weeks which emphasized on the drilling of the production of vowel and consonant sounds. After nine weeks, the participants were given a post-test to identify the effectiveness of the <b>phonetic</b> <b>alphabet</b> training. This study discovered that ESL learners had problems pronouncing vowel sounds and the <b>phonetic</b> <b>alphabet</b> training did not wholly positively enhance ESL learners’ English pronunciation. This seems to confirm Lenneberg’s (1967) theory that the stage before puberty is more successful for language learning. This study should raise the awareness of the importance of equipping ESL learners with <b>phonetic</b> <b>alphabet</b> training at the young age. This is because ‘age’ influences the acquisition of a second language and will impede learners’ success of acquiring <b>phonetic</b> <b>alphabet</b> knowledge when they learn it as adults. It is hoped that this study serves as a template for further research on <b>phonetic</b> <b>alphabet</b> training and persuade curriculum developers to include <b>phonetic</b> <b>alphabet</b> training in the school’s curriculum...|$|R
