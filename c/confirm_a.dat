5|$|A {{polymerase}} {{chain reaction}} test on a blood sample from affected animals will <b>confirm</b> <b>a</b> suspected case by identifying the viral DNA, though it is now common to start famciclovir treatment at the earliest possible moment rather than waiting for confirmation of the case. Prior {{to the development of}} the test, or in circumstances where it is not available, the disease may be misdiagnosed as any of a number of other conditions which have a quick onset leading to rapid death, including encephalomyocarditis and salmonellosis.|$|E
5|$|Concentrations of {{midazolam}} or {{its major}} metabolite, 1-hydroxymidazolam glucuronide, may {{be measured in}} plasma, serum, or whole blood to monitor for safety in those receiving the drug therapeutically, to <b>confirm</b> <b>a</b> diagnosis of poisoning in hospitalized patients, or to assist in a forensic investigation of a case of fatal overdosage. Patients with renal dysfunction may exhibit prolongation of elimination half-life for both the parent drug and its active metabolite, with accumulation of these two substances in the bloodstream {{and the appearance of}} adverse depressant effects.|$|E

5|$|Dilation and {{curettage}} or an {{endometrial biopsy}} {{are used to}} obtain a tissue sample for histological examination. Endometrial biopsy is the less invasive option, {{but it may not}} give conclusive results every time. Hysteroscopy only shows the gross anatomy of the endometrium, which is often not indicative of cancer, and is therefore not used, unless in conjunction with a biopsy. Hysteroscopy can be used to <b>confirm</b> <b>a</b> diagnosis of cancer. New evidence shows that D has a higher false negative rate than endometrial biopsy.|$|E
5|$|Mephedrone may be quantitated in blood, plasma or urine by gas chromatography-mass {{spectrometry}} or liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry to <b>confirm</b> <b>a</b> {{diagnosis of}} poisoning in hospitalised patients or to provide {{evidence in a}} medicolegal death investigation. Blood or plasma mephedrone concentrations {{are expected to be}} in a range of 50–100 μg/l in persons using the drug recreationally, >100 μg/l in intoxicated patients and >500 μg/l in victims of acute overdosage.|$|E
5|$|Metformin may be {{quantified}} in blood, plasma, or serum to monitor therapy, <b>confirm</b> <b>a</b> diagnosis of poisoning, or assist in a forensic death investigation. Blood or plasma metformin concentrations are {{usually in a}} range of 1–4mg/l in persons receiving therapeutic doses, 40–120mg/l in victims of acute overdosage, and 80–200mg/l in fatalities. Chromatographic techniques are commonly employed.|$|E
50|$|Next, Cardwell {{noted that}} bearish divergence: 1) only occurs in uptrends, and 2) mostly only {{leads to a}} brief {{correction}} instead of a reversal in trend. Therefore, bearish divergence is <b>a</b> sign <b>confirming</b> <b>an</b> uptrend. Similarly, bullish divergence is <b>a</b> sign <b>confirming</b> <b>a</b> downtrend.|$|R

5|$|Polonium-210 may be {{quantified}} in biological specimens by alpha particle spectrometry to <b>confirm</b> <b>a</b> diagnosis of poisoning in hospitalized patients or to provide {{evidence in a}} medicolegal death investigation. The baseline urinary excretion of polonium-210 in healthy persons due to routine exposure to environmental sources is normally {{in a range of}} 5–15 mBq/day. Levels in excess of 30 mBq/day are suggestive of excessive exposure to the radionuclide.|$|E
5|$|Selenium may be {{measured}} in blood, plasma, serum, or urine to monitor excessive environmental or occupational exposure, to <b>confirm</b> <b>a</b> diagnosis of poisoning in hospitalized victims, or investigate a suspected case of fatal overdose. Some analytical techniques are capable of distinguishing organic from inorganic forms of the element. Both organic and inorganic forms of selenium are largely converted to monosaccharide conjugates (selenosugars) in the body prior elimination in the urine. Cancer patients receiving daily oral doses of selenothionine may achieve very high plasma and urine selenium concentrations.|$|E
5|$|The 11 Canis-Minorids, {{also called}} the Beta Canis Minorids, are a meteor shower that arise near the fifth-magnitude star 11 Canis Minoris and were {{discovered}} in 1964 by Keith Hindley, who investigated their trajectory and proposed a common origin with the comet D/1917 F1 Mellish. However, this conclusion has been refuted subsequently {{as the number of}} orbits analysed was low and their trajectories too disparate to <b>confirm</b> <b>a</b> link. They last from 4 to 15 December, peaking over 10 and 11 December.|$|E

5|$|Alprazolam may be {{quantified}} in blood or plasma to <b>confirm</b> <b>a</b> diagnosis of poisoning in hospitalized patients, provide evidence in an impaired driving arrest, or {{to assist in}} a medicolegal death investigation. Blood or plasma alprazolam concentrations are usually {{in a range of}} 10–100 μg/L in persons receiving the drug therapeutically, 100–300 μg/L in those arrested for impaired driving, and 300–2000 μg/L in victims of acute overdosage. Most commercial immunoassays for the benzodiazepine class of drugs cross-react with alprazolam, but confirmation and quantitation is usually performed using chromatographic techniques.|$|E
5|$|At the secured facility, Fauxlivia is able {{to clear}} Peter, Astrid (Jasika Nicole) and Walter from the lab {{in order to allow}} Ray access to the lab. Ray {{continues}} to avoid shifting to a new body. Walter returns to the lab to <b>confirm</b> <b>a</b> theory and is interrupted by Ray. Ray successfully removes the data device, knocks out Walter, and flees to give it to Newton. When Ray requests to be able to return to his family, Newton kills him near his home, but by this time, the Fringe division has identified Ray and have converged on his address. On spotting Newton, they engage in a car chase, eventually damaging Newton's car. Fauxlivia recovers Van Horn's data disc from Newton and hides it before taking Newton into custody.|$|E
5|$|Boron was not {{recognized}} as an element until it was isolated by Sir Humphry Davy and by Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac and Louis Jacques Thénard. In 1808 Davy observed that electric current sent through a solution of borates produced a brown precipitate {{on one of the}} electrodes. In his subsequent experiments, he used potassium to reduce boric acid instead of electrolysis. He produced enough boron to <b>confirm</b> <b>a</b> new element and named the element boracium. Gay-Lussac and Thénard used iron to reduce boric acid at high temperatures. By oxidizing boron with air, they showed that boric acid is an oxidation product of boron. Jöns Jakob Berzelius identified boron as an element in 1824. Pure boron was arguably first produced by the American chemist Ezekiel Weintraub in 1909.|$|E
50|$|An {{increase}} in open interest {{along with an}} {{increase in}} price is said to <b>confirm</b> <b>an</b> upward trend. Similarly, an increase in open interest along with a decrease in price <b>confirms</b> <b>a</b> downward trend. An increase or decrease in prices while open interest remains flat or declining may indicate a possible trend reversal.|$|R

5|$|Genital herpes {{can be more}} {{difficult}} to diagnose than oral herpes, since most HSV-2-infected persons have no classical symptoms. Further confusing diagnosis, several other conditions resemble genital herpes, including fungal infection, lichen planus, atopic dermatitis, and urethritis. Laboratory testing is often used to <b>confirm</b> <b>a</b> diagnosis of genital herpes. Laboratory tests include culture of the virus, direct fluorescent antibody (DFA) studies to detect virus, skin biopsy, and polymerase chain reaction to test for presence of viral DNA. Although these procedures produce highly sensitive and specific diagnoses, their high costs and time constraints discourage their regular use in clinical practice.|$|E
5|$|Injury to the {{accessory}} nerve {{can result in}} neck pain and weakness of the trapezius muscle. Symptoms will depend on at what point along its length the nerve was severed. Injury to the nerve can result in shoulder girdle depression, atrophy, abnormal movement, a protruding scapula, and weakened abduction. Weakness of the shoulder girdle can lead to traction injury of the brachial plexus. Because diagnosis is difficult, electromyogram or nerve conduction studies {{may be needed to}} <b>confirm</b> <b>a</b> suspected injury. Outcomes with surgical treatment appear to be better than conservative management, which entails physiotherapy and pain relief. Surgical management includes neurolysis, nerve end-to-end suturing, and surgical replacement of affected trapezius muscle segments with other muscle groups.|$|E
5|$|Medical {{diagnosis}} of the onset of HD can be made following the appearance of physical symptoms specific to the disease. Genetic testing {{can be used to}} <b>confirm</b> <b>a</b> physical diagnosis if there is no family history of HD. Even before the onset of symptoms, genetic testing can confirm if an individual or embryo carries an expanded copy of the trinucleotide repeat in the HTT gene that causes the disease. Genetic counseling is available to provide advice and guidance throughout the testing procedure, and on the implications of a confirmed diagnosis. These implications include the impact on an individual's psychology, career, family planning decisions, relatives and relationships. Despite the availability of pre-symptomatic testing, only 5% of those at risk of inheriting HD choose to do so.|$|E

On 14 August, {{he made his}} debut {{in the first round}} of the League Cup away to Charlton Athletic, replacing David Mooney in the 64th minute of a 1–1 draw at The Valley and converting his attempt in the subsequent penalty shootout which his team won 4–3. Four days later on his league debut, he replaced Kevin Lisbie with 21 minutes remaining and scored a penalty consolation in a 3–1 loss at Tranmere Rovers. On 5 December, he scored his only other goal for the O's, another penalty to <b>confirm</b> <b>a</b> 3–0 win at Northampton Town in the second round of the Football League Trophy, seven minutes after replacing Mooney.|$|E
5|$|On his {{official}} debut {{for the club}} on 17 September, Marquinhos scored his first professional goal to <b>confirm</b> <b>a</b> 4–1 win against Olympiacos at the Karaiskakis Stadium in the group stage of the 2013–14 UEFA Champions League. Five days later, Marquinhos made his Ligue 1 debut as a starter in a 1–1 draw against Monaco. His first league goal for the club came on 28 September, {{the first in a}} 2–0 win over Toulouse. On 2 October, he scored the second goal in a 3–0 Champions League group victory against Benfica. Marquinhos, who was playing due to injury to Thiago Silva, expressed surprise at his goalscoring form at the start of his PSG career.|$|E
5|$|Other {{techniques}} {{may be used}} to <b>confirm</b> <b>a</b> particular diagnosis. X-rays {{are still}} used for head trauma, but evidence suggests they are not useful; head injuries are either so mild that they do not need imaging or severe enough to merit the more accurate CT. Angiography {{may be used to}} detect blood vessel pathology when risk factors such as penetrating head trauma are involved. Functional imaging can measure cerebral blood flow or metabolism, inferring neuronal activity in specific regions and potentially helping to predict outcome. Electroencephalography and transcranial doppler may also be used. The most sensitive physical measure to date is the quantitative EEG, which has documented an 80% to 100% ability in discriminating between normal and traumatic brain-injured subjects.|$|E
