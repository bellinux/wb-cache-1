5|$|Because {{the orbit}} of Phobos is below {{synchronous}} altitude, the tidal forces from the planet Mars are gradually lowering its orbit. In about 50 million years, it could either <b>crash</b> <b>into</b> Mars's surface or break up into a ring structure around the planet.|$|E
5|$|In New Jersey, {{high winds}} downed power lines, which killed two people. Along the coast, high waves damaged boardwalks and caused flooding. In {{neighboring}} Pennsylvania, Carol caused a tractor to <b>crash</b> <b>into</b> a train, resulting in two deaths. Damage {{in the state}} was estimated at $250,000.|$|E

50|$|As {{a rule of}} thumb, if the two {{vehicles}} {{have similar}} physical structure, <b>crashing</b> <b>into</b> another car is equivalent to <b>crashing</b> <b>into</b> a rigid surface (like a wall) at half of the closing speed. This means that rear-ending a stationary car while travelling at 50 km/h (30 mph) is equivalent, in terms of deceleration, to <b>crashing</b> <b>into</b> a wall at 25 km/h (15 mph). The {{same is true for}} the vehicle <b>crashed</b> <b>into.</b> However, if one of the vehicles is significantly more rigid (e.g. the rear of a truck) then the deceleration is more typically reflected by the full closing speed for the less rigid vehicle.|$|R
5|$|Jovian Europa Orbiter was an ESA Cosmic Vision concept {{study from}} 2007. Another concept was Ice Clipper, {{which would have}} used an {{impactor}} similar to the Deep Impact mission—it would make a controlled <b>crash</b> <b>into</b> the surface of Europa, generating a plume of debris that would then be collected by a small spacecraft flying through the plume.|$|E
5|$|The plot {{involves}} a couple, Annie and Alex, vacationing in the Caribbean aboard a luxury cruise ship, which is hijacked by a villain named Geiger.

5|$|In Metroid Fusion, Samus {{returns to}} SR388, where a {{parasitic}} organism infects and nearly kills her.

To prevent the now-dubbed X Parasites from spreading beyond SR388 and the space station orbiting above it, Samus sets the station to <b>crash</b> <b>into</b> the planet, during which she contends with the SA-X, an X Parasite that was born from her infected Power Suit pieces and possesses all of her abilities.|$|E

5|$|The crew {{notice that}} Geiger {{has set the}} ship to <b>crash</b> <b>into</b> an oil tanker {{off the coast of}} Saint Martin. Alex decides to stop the ship by diving {{underneath}} it and jamming the propeller with a steel cable. Geiger realizes Alex is trying to stop the ship, so he jams the cable winch while Alex is underwater, causing it to break off the ship and free the cable. Geiger takes Annie hostage and escapes with her on a boat from the ship's stern.|$|E
5|$|After Indiana {{returned}} to active duty, she {{participated in the}} invasion of Hollandia in western New Guinea. The ship then {{returned to}} the central Pacific and bombarded Truk, and subsequently took part in operations off the Marianas Islands. On 19 June 1944 a Japanese torpedo bomber attempted to attack the ship, but Indianas anti-aircraft gunners managed to destroy both the aircraft and the torpedo it had dropped, with no damage to the ship. Shortly thereafter, a second Japanese plane was shot down, but a third managed to <b>crash</b> <b>into</b> the ship. The aircraft disintegrated upon striking the side armor plates and scattered pieces of the plane across the stern. Five men were injured, but the ship suffered only very slight damage.|$|E
5|$|After much fanfare, Muhammad departs jannah airport, {{riding a}} buraq, or winged horse. The Archangel Gabriel accompanies him. On the way, they {{encounter}} a Soviet spacecraft.

Later, they pass Jakarta, which Gabriel describes as the most sinful place on Earth. Angered by Gabriel's statement that less than a million of Indonesia's 90 million Muslims are true believers, {{as well as the}} fact that it is the birthplace of Nasakom, Muhammad declares that Islam will never die and waits on the cloud.|$|E

The episodes ends with a description of the fates of each of the characters involved in the episode.|$|E
5|$|After the Cortex Vortex, a {{space station}} owned by Doctor Neo Cortex, is {{destroyed}} by Doctor Nitrus Brio's laser beam device, pieces of the station <b>crash</b> <b>into</b> a tropical mountain. This sets free an entity known as Uka Uka, the mastermind behind Cortex's previous schemes. He derides Cortex for failing to retrieve the crystals and gems, {{both of which are}} vast sources of world energy. However, feeling generous after being freed from prison, Uka Uka recruits Doctor Nefarious Tropy to join him and Cortex in their latest plan.

After arriving on the Auriga, Call infiltrates Number 8's cell to kill her and discovers that the Queen has been extracted. She is apprehended by Wren, who rounds up {{the crew of the}} Betty for execution, but they overpower the USM soldiers and try to escape with Wren in custody. Wren shoots Call, who falls to her apparent death, but she reappears and reveals her synthetic origin. Call orders the Auriga to <b>crash</b> <b>into</b> Earth. On the Betty, Call is confronted by the Newborn; she is saved by Number 8, who ejects it into space.|$|E

5|$|At {{the center}} of the station, the marines find the colonists cocooned, serving as {{incubators}} for the creatures' offspring. When the marines kill a chestburster, the other aliens are roused and ambush the troops, killing Frost, Crowe, Wierzboswki, and Drake while capturing Apone and Dietrich alive to be cocooned as hosts. When the inexperienced Gorman panics, Ripley assumes command, taking control of their armored personnel carrier, and rams the nest to rescue Corporal Hicks, Private Hudson and Private Vasquez, the only three survivors. Hicks orders the dropship to recover the survivors, but a stowaway alien kills the pilots Spunkmeyer and Ferro, causing it to <b>crash</b> <b>into</b> the station. The remaining group barricade themselves inside the colony command center.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, Homer, {{with the}} help of Ned Flanders, sets out to rescue the {{children}} (driving Ned's car and sawing off part of his roof to use as a snow plough) but crashes Flanders' car into a fire hydrant, which sprays water that freezes the car in place. Homer's repeated gunning of the accelerator causes carbon monoxide to flood the front of the car. Flanders and Homer get high from the fumes and wildly hallucinate. While the trapped children go wild with power, Skinner uses the school hamster, named Nibbles, to get a message to the outside world. Nibbles makes it to Ned and Homer, breaking the window and reviving them: they <b>crash</b> <b>into</b> a salt silo, melting the snow around the school and badly rusting the car but freeing the kids in the process.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, {{the shark}} attacks the other kids, hitting {{one of their}} boats, and causing most of them to capsize and <b>crash</b> <b>into</b> {{each other in the}} ensuing panic, {{throwing}} several of them, including Mike and Sean, into the water. The other teens help them out of the water while two of them pull Mike out as the shark goes for him and head back to get help. Sean and the others remain adrift on the wreckage of tangled boats. A Coast Guard marine helicopter that Brody contacted arrives to tow them to shore. Before the pilot can tow them, the shark attacks and sinks the chopper with the pilot at the controls. It then knocks Sean into the water, but Marge sacrifices herself to save him.|$|E
