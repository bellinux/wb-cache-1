25|$|Barrel {{burnishing}} {{is a type}} of barreling {{where no}} cutting action is desired. The goal is to reduce minute irregularities and produce a clean, smooth surface. The parts are usually tumbled against themselves or with steel balls, shot, rounded-end pins, or ballcones to achieve this. It is also usually a wet process that uses water and a lubricant or <b>cleaning</b> <b>agent,</b> such as soap or cream of tartar. The barrel is not loaded more than half full and if media is used then a 2:1 ratio of media to parts is maintained to keep the parts from rubbing.|$|E
25|$|Sweet {{orange oil}} is a {{by-product}} of the juice industry produced by pressing the peel. It is used for flavoring food and drinks {{and also in the}} perfume industry and aromatherapy for its fragrance. Sweet orange oil consists of approximately 90% D-limonene, a solvent used in various household chemicals, such as wood conditioners for furniture and—along with other citrus oils—detergents and hand cleansers. It is an efficient <b>cleaning</b> <b>agent</b> with a pleasant smell, promoted for being environmentally friendly and therefore, preferable to petrochemicals. D-limonene is, however, classified from slightly toxic to humans, to very toxic to marine life in different countries.|$|E
2500|$|Carbon tetrachloride, {{also known}} by many other names (the most notable being tetrachloromethane, also {{recognized}} by the IUPAC, carbon tet in the cleaning industry, Halon-104 in firefighting, and Refrigerant-10 in HVACR) is an organic compound with the chemical formula CCl4. It was formerly widely used in fire extinguishers, as a precursor to refrigerants and as a <b>cleaning</b> <b>agent.</b> [...] It is a colourless liquid with a [...] "sweet" [...] smell that can be detected at low levels. [...] It has practically no flammability at lower temperatures.|$|E
5000|$|Environmental {{impacts of}} <b>cleaning</b> <b>agents</b> are the {{consequences}} of chemical compounds in <b>cleaning</b> products. <b>Cleaning</b> <b>agents</b> can be bioactive with consequences ranging from mild to severe.

50|$|<b>Cleaning</b> <b>agents</b> are {{substances}} (usually liquids, powders, sprays, or granules) used {{to remove}} dirt, including dust, stains, bad smells, and clutter on surfaces. Purposes of <b>cleaning</b> <b>agents</b> include health, beauty, removing offensive odor, and avoiding {{the spread of}} dirt and contaminants to oneself and others. Some <b>cleaning</b> <b>agents</b> can kill bacteria, e.g. on door handles, worktops and other metallic surfaces, and clean at the solvent-containing and are then called degreasers.|$|R
50|$|Alkaline <b>cleaning</b> <b>agents</b> contain {{strong bases}} like sodium {{hydroxide}} or potassium hydroxide. Bleach (pH 12) and ammonia (pH 11) are common alkaline <b>cleaning</b> <b>agents.</b> Often, dispersants, to prevent redeposition of dissolved dirt, and chelants, to attack rust, {{are added to}} the alkaline agent.|$|R
2500|$|Sodium {{hydroxide}} {{is frequently}} {{used as an}} industrial <b>cleaning</b> <b>agent</b> where it is often called [...] "caustic". It is added to water, heated, and then used to clean process equipment, storage tanks, etc. It can dissolve grease, oils, fats and protein-based deposits. It is also used for cleaning waste discharge pipes under sinks and drains in domestic properties. Surfactants {{can be added to}} the sodium hydroxide solution in order to stabilize dissolved substances and thus prevent redeposition. A sodium hydroxide soak solution is used as a powerful degreaser on stainless steel and glass bakeware. It is also a common ingredient in oven cleaners.|$|E
2500|$|In {{order to}} {{circumvent}} the ban on GHB, do it yourself packages were put on the market with which oneself could easily make GHB. These contained the basic raw materials to be mixed as well as instructions in order (in the proper proportions). The main ingredients for homemade GHB are still (separately) freely available commercially in the Netherlands (GBL (gamma-butyrolactone) or 1,4-butanediol, which is used as the alkaline industrial <b>cleaning</b> <b>agent,</b> sodium hydroxide, {{which can be found}} in drain cleaner, and distilled water or ethanol). Since 2005, GHB is medically used under the brand name [...] Xyrem [...] for the treatment of narcolepsy with cataplexy. In 2011 the party drug was placed on the list of hard drugs by the Dutch government, making it illegal other than for medical use prescribed by a doctor. Also it is in addiction clinics used during detoxification of GHB in a reduction schedule to prevent severe withdrawal symptoms.|$|E

40|$|Cleaning {{validation}} procedures {{are carried out}} in order to assure that residues of <b>cleaning</b> <b>agents</b> are within acceptable limits after the <b>cleaning</b> process. <b>Cleaning</b> <b>agents</b> often consist of a mixture of various surfactants which are in a highly diluted state after the water rinsing procedure has been completed. This {{makes it difficult to}} find appropriate analytical methods that are sensitive enough to detect the <b>cleaning</b> <b>agents.</b> In addition, it is advantageous for the analytical methods to be simple to perform and to give results quickly. In this study, three different non-specific analytical methods are compared: visual detection of foam, pH and conductivity measurements. The analyses were performed on different dilutions of the <b>cleaning</b> <b>agents</b> Bactericidal Hydroclean and Tickopur R 33. The results demonstrated that the most appropriate method for these detergents are conductivity measurements, by which it is possible to detect concentrations of <b>cleaning</b> <b>agents</b> down to 10 µg/ml. In this case, pH is an inadequate method (non-linear) and visual detection of foam is a semi-quantitative method.

Methods: Six <b>cleaning</b> <b>agents</b> (water, water and soap, alcohol, bleach, a commercial glass cleaner, and a commercial decon-taminating agent) were analyzed for decontamination effective-ness {{for a wide range}} of surfaces (Formica, vinyl, vinyl–polyester, plastic, rubber, and polyester). Results: Within the experiment, the contamination was removed to radioactivity levels of less than 1 % of the original contamination level.

Although sodium hydroxide (NaOH) can cause corrosion on food contact surfaces such as stainless steel, it is the preferred <b>cleaning</b> <b>agent</b> for protein removal due to its efficacy in dissolving proteins and dispersing/emulsifying food soils.
