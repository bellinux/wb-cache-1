5|$|Immunology {{made a great}} advance {{towards the}} end of the 19th century, through rapid developments, in the study of humoral {{immunity}} and cellular immunity. Particularly important was the work of Paul Ehrlich, who proposed the side-chain theory to explain the specificity of the antigen-antibody reaction; his contributions to the understanding of humoral immunity were recognized by the award of a Nobel Prize in 1908, which was jointly awarded to the founder of <b>cellular</b> <b>immunology,</b> Elie Metchnikoff.|$|E
5|$|Following his {{resignation}} from the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute, Burnet was offered an {{office at the}} University of Melbourne in the School of Microbiology. While at the university, he wrote 13 books {{on a variety of}} topics including immunology, ageing and cancer, and human biology. He also wrote an autobiography entitled Changing Patterns: An Atypical Autobiography, which was released in 1968. In all, he wrote a further 16 books after his retirement from the Hall Institute. He was known for his ability to write quickly, often without a final draft, and his ability to convey a message to readers from a wide spectrum of backgrounds, but he was himself sceptical that his opinions had much influence. In 1969 he published <b>Cellular</b> <b>Immunology,</b> considered his magnum opus on immunity, attempted to show how various phenomena could be predicted by the clonal selection theory. The following year, he wrote Immunological Surveillance, which expounded his established opinion that mammals could immunise themselves through their ability to detect foreign patterns in the body. He continued to maintain an intense and focused work schedule, often shunning others to keep up a heavy writing load.|$|E

40|$|The {{complexity}} of a cancer, such as cell heterogeneity, {{and the existence}} of hypoxia, stromal cells and stem cells has so far prevented successful development and treatment of patients suffering from the later stages of cancers. At present, the use of conventional therapies, such as chemo/radio therapy is limited, and only therapies that are focused on utilizing the patient’s immune response to combat against the disease appear to be the most reliable and promising. Two decades ago, cytokines were discovered to be able to activate the immune systems and mount an anti-tumour response. Then, dendritic cells were hailed as the most significant regulators of immunity and are employed in a variety of cancer management schemes. This review introduces current development in the field, focusing on combination of the components of the rapidly growing fields of immunotherapy and gene transfer/therapy, providing useful and significant detailed information for readers of <b>cellular</b> and molecular <b>immunology.</b> <b>Cellular</b> & Molecular <b>Immunology.</b> 2005; 2 (5) : 351 - 357...|$|R

40|$|Cytokines like interferons (IFNs) play {{a central}} role in {{regulating}} innate and specific immunities against the pathogens and neoplastic cells. A number of signaling pathways are induced in response to IFN in various cells. One classic mechanism employed by IFNs is the JAK-STAT signaling pathway for inducing cellular responses. Here we describe the non-STAT pathways that participate in IFN-induced responses.
