This {{research focuses on}} the full plastic strength and collapse mechanisms of the offset beam-to-CFT column <b>connection</b> <b>panels,</b> and investigates the influence of difference in beam depth and width to thickness ratio on the elasto-plastic behaviors of the offset beam-to-CFT column <b>connection</b> <b>panels.</b> The feasibility of analytical models generated by MSC. Marc 2012 is verified {{by a set of}} experimental results presented in the companion paper. Parameters used in this analytical study includes: differences in beam depths, width to thickness ratio and loading directions. FEM results suggest that the assumed collapse mechanisms can predict the failure modes of FEM models reasonably. Owing to overlooking confined effect by steel tubes on concrete panels, the proposed formulae underestimated the full plastic shear strength of the offset panels. On the basis of experimental and analytical results, an enhancement coefficient formula is proposed, which is derived from regression analysis taking the effect of width to thickness ratio of steel tubes and beam depth ratio into consideration...|$|R

The main objective of this research is to establish the plastic strength calculation method for the panels based on the limit analysis. Four cruciform subassemblages are tested under the cyclic and monotonic loading in order to obtain fundamental data for the collapse mechanism of the panels.

The 4, 6 and 8 story older steel moment frames with clip angle and T-stub connections were designed and analyzed using 2 %/ 50 yrs ground motions in four cities of the Mid-America earthquake region. The probability density function and cumulative distribution function of PRCR and PZD were determined by the goodness-of-fit tests based on probabilistic parameters measured {{from the results of}} the nonlinear time-history analyses.

To clarify this problem the present paper investigates the seismic behaviour of a traditional precast structural frame for industrial buildings with {{a new type of}} connections system of the cladding panels. This system consists of a statically determined pendulum arrangement of panels, each supported with two hinges to the structure, one at the top and one at the bottom, so to have under seismic action a pure frame behaviour where the wall panels are masses without stiffness. Adding mutual <b>connections</b> between the <b>panels,</b> the wall cladding panels become part of the resisting structure, leading to a dual frame/wall system or to a wall system depending on the stiffness of the connections. The results of a parametric investigation based on non-linear static and dynamic analyses show how the main characteristics of the structural behaviour play their role within the structural assembly for different degrees of interaction between frame and panels, as well as for intermediate solutions with dissipative connections. The results of non-linear static and dynamic analyses under recorded and artificial accelerograms show the effectiveness of the dual frame/wall system with dissipative <b>connections</b> between <b>panels...</b>|$|R
