5|$|In 1935, Wolf Klaphake and {{his wife}} Maria emigrated to Australia. The Klaphakes' {{decision}} to emigrate was probably primarily the result of Maria's encounters with Nazi authorities; their decision to settle in Australia (rather than, say, in Britain) was influenced by Wolf's desire to develop a dew <b>condenser.</b> As a dry continent, Australia was likely to need alternative sources of fresh water, and the Premier of South Australia, whom he had met in London, had expressed an interest. Klaphake made a specific proposal for a <b>condenser</b> at {{the small town of}} Cook, where there was no supply of potable water. At Cook, the railway company had previously installed a large coal-powered active <b>condenser,</b> but it was prohibitively expensive to run, and it was cheaper to simply transport water. However, the Australian government turned down Klaphake's proposal, and he lost interest in the project.|$|E
5|$|In 1992 a {{party of}} French {{academics}} attended a condensed matter conference in Ukraine where physicist Daniel Beysens introduced them {{to the story of}} how ancient Theodosia was supplied with water from dew condensers. They were sufficiently intrigued that in 1993 they went to see for themselves. They concluded that the mounds that Zibold identified as dew condensers were in fact ancient burial mounds (a part of the necropolis of antic Theodosia) and that the pipes were medieval in origin and not associated with the mounds. They found the remains of Zibold's <b>condenser,</b> which they tidied up and examined closely. Zibold's <b>condenser</b> had apparently performed reasonably well, but in fact his exact results are not at all clear, and {{it is possible that the}} collector was intercepting fog, which added significantly to the yield. If Zibold's <b>condenser</b> worked at all, this was probably due to fact that a few stones near the surface of the mound were able to lose heat at night while being thermally isolated from the ground; however, it could never have produced the yield that Zibold envisaged.|$|E
5|$|The 2001 dive season {{concentrated}} on raising the ship's steam engine and <b>condenser.</b> Hull plates {{had to be}} removed to access the engine compartment and both the engine and the <b>condenser</b> had to be separated from the ship, the surrounding wreckage and each other. A Mini Rover ROV was used to provide visibility of the wreck and divers to the support staff above water. The engine was raised on 16 July and the <b>condenser</b> three days later by the crane barge Wotan. Saturation diving was evaluated by the Navy that dive season on Monitor and proved to be very successful, allowing divers to maximize their time on the bottom. The surface-supplied divers evaluated the use of heliox due to the depth of the wreck. It also proved to be successful once the dive tables were adjusted.|$|E

5|$|Between 1999 and 2000, {{the power}} station {{was given a}} turbine upgrade. In 2000, the station's {{condensers}} were also refurbished. The <b>condenser</b> refurbishment {{was carried out by}} Alstom. These improvements saw an increase in the station's generating capacity, thermal efficiency and MWh production.|$|E
5|$|Chaptal did not {{consider}} his experiment a success. When he retired in 1946, he put the <b>condenser</b> out of order, possibly {{because he did not}} want to leave an improper installation to mislead those who might later continue studies on air wells.|$|E
5|$|Later {{that same}} day, 17 February 1960, Triton {{experienced}} a serious leak with a main <b>condenser</b> circulating water pump, and a reactor warning alarm tripped {{because of a}} defective electrical connection.

5|$|The CIA hands Jodie over to Nathan, now {{executive}} director of the DPA, overseeing the DPA's newest <b>condenser,</b> code-named the Black Sun. He reveals that the CIA is willing to let Jodie go if she agrees to a final mission. Jodie and a CIA team led by Ryan destroy a facility housing a Chinese-developed <b>condenser</b> before it is used to attack the United States. Jodie then learns that Nathan built a miniature <b>condenser</b> to speak exclusively to his family, but without success. After showing Nathan that his refusal to let them go is only making them suffer, Jodie tries to leave, only to be held in captivity by the CIA—the organisation has deemed her too dangerous to be freed. Jodie is subjected to the same fate as her mother. Nathan appears and informs Jodie that he's decided to shut down the containment field to the Black Sun, merging the two worlds together and making death meaningless. Too weak to free Jodie, Aiden contacts Ryan and Cole, leading them to her. After Nathan shuts down the containment field, the three chase after him {{into the heart of the}} Black Sun, with the intent of destroying it.|$|E

5|$|At one point, Nathan {{asks for}} Jodie's {{help with the}} <b>condenser,</b> which has broken open. After braving hostile {{entities}} from the Infraworld, Jodie manages {{to shut down the}} <b>condenser</b> and warns Nathan not to build another. This gets the attention of the CIA, who send agent Ryan Clayton (Eric Winter) to forcibly recruit Jodie. After training, the now-adult Jodie goes on multiple missions as a field agent, often with Ryan, to whom she slowly becomes attracted. On one such mission in Somalia, Jodie learns that the target she killed was not a warlord, but the country's benign president. An enraged Jodie flees in disgust, despite Ryan's pleas. Branded a traitor, Jodie becomes a fugitive, evading pursuing CIA forces. Along the way, she befriends a group of homeless people, one of whom she helps give birth, and a family of Native Americans whom she saves from a malevolent entity. The CIA eventually recaptures Jodie after she attempts to reconnect with her catatonic biological mother, who has been held and forcibly drugged for decades in a military hospital.|$|E
50|$|In 1950, this sole Class 20 {{locomotive}} {{was modified}} to an experimental <b>condensing</b> locomotive, {{equipped with a}} <b>condensing</b> tender that was ordered from Henschel in Germany in 1948. Beginning in 1951, tests with the <b>condensing</b> Class 20 were conducted in the Eastern Transvaal and the Karoo. The positive results of the <b>condensing</b> trials proved the viability of <b>condensing</b> locomotives in South Africa {{and led to the}} introduction of the Class 25 4-8-4 <b>condensing</b> locomotive fleet in 1953.|$|R

5|$|In 1946, Hilliard {{took over}} as Vice President of Engineering due to Jim Lansing's leaving Altec {{to start a new}} {{enterprise}} which would become JBL. Hilliard remained VP Engineering at Altec until 1960 during which time he supervised the development of sectoral horns, significant reductions {{in the size of the}} <b>condenser</b> microphone, many amplifier and crossover designs, and a major reworking and improvement of the Altec Lansing Duplex 604, the well-known high-fidelity coaxial loudspeaker driver originally designed by George Carrington, Sr., who was then president of Altec Lansing.|$|E
5|$|No.A816 {{emerged from}} Eastleigh in August 1931 for trials, but was stopped when {{temperature}} variations within the condensing equipment caused water leakage. Modifications {{were made to}} improve the draughting of the locomotive, incorporating a box-like chimney attached to the <b>condenser</b> array by pipes. No.A816 was released for more trials, and produced performances well-below those displayed by the unmodified members of the class. The experiment was ended when the system's developers ran out of money, and the locomotive was converted back to standard form between May and August 1935, re-entering service as No.1816.|$|E
5|$|Admiral Reinhard Scheer, who {{had succeeded}} Admirals von Ingenohl and Hugo von Pohl as the fleet commander, {{immediately}} planned another {{attack on the}} British coast. However, the damage to Seydlitz and <b>condenser</b> trouble on several of the III Battle Squadron dreadnoughts delayed the plan {{until the end of}} May 1916. The German battlefleet departed the Jade at 03:30 on 31 May. Westfalen was assigned to the II Division of the I Battle Squadron, under the command of Rear Admiral W. Engelhardt. Westfalen was the last ship in the division, astern of her three sisters. The II Division was the last unit of dreadnoughts in the fleet; they were followed by only the elderly pre-dreadnoughts of the II Battle Squadron.|$|E

5|$|Ahead of the spar, the thick-skinned {{leading edge}} of the wing formed a strong and rigid D-shaped box, which took most of the wing loads. At the time the wing was designed, this D-shaped leading edge was {{intended}} to house steam condensers for the evaporative cooling system intended for the PV-XII. Constant problems with the evaporative system in the Goshawk led to the adoption of a cooling system which used 100% glycol. The radiators were housed in a new radiator-duct designed by Fredrick Meredith of the RAE at Farnborough. This used the cooling air to generate thrust, greatly reducing the net drag produced by the radiators. In turn, the leading-edge structure lost its function as a <b>condenser,</b> but it was later adapted to house integral fuel tanks of various sizes – a feature patented by Vickers-Supermarine in 1938.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} they were ready for their first {{practical}} installation, they heard that one of their members, Girja Sharan, had obtained a grant to construct a dew <b>condenser</b> in Kothara, India. In April 2001, Sharan had incidentally noticed substantial condensation on the roof of a cottage at Toran Beach Resort in the arid coastal region of Kutch, where he was briefly staying. The following year, he investigated the phenomenon more closely and interviewed local people. Financed by the Gujarat Energy Development Agency and the World Bank, Sharan and his team went on to develop passive, radiative condensers for use in the arid coastal region of Kutch. Active commercialisation began in 2006.|$|E
5|$|During {{the trek}} towards the Black Sun, Cole is injured by {{entities}} and Ryan sacrifices his own safety to keep Jodie alive. Eventually, Jodie confronts Nathan near the Black Sun. He commits suicide to reunite with his family. As Jodie shuts down the <b>condenser,</b> {{she has a}} vision—Aiden is her stillborn twin brother. Jodie must make a choice: {{go back to the}} world of the living, or go on to the Infraworld and be reunited with everyone she has lost. By the story's end, the Infraworld has become a widespread threat in the not-so-distant future. Jodie prepares to confront the threat.|$|E

5|$|Following the {{capitulation}} of Germany in November 1918, {{most of the}} High Seas Fleet's ships, {{under the}} command of Rear Admiral Ludwig von Reuter, were interned in the British naval base in Scapa Flow. Cöln was among the ships interned. On the voyage there, her captain radioed the fleet commander that one of the ship's steam turbines had a leaking <b>condenser.</b> Reuter dispatched another light cruiser to remain with the ship in the event that she needed to be towed. Despite the problematic turbine, Cöln managed to steam into port, the last ship in the German line.|$|E
5|$|From the hoppers, {{the waste}} falls onto the furnace-charging chute {{and from there}} onto the incinerating grate. Here it is burned at a {{temperature}} in excess of 1,200°C. This heat is then converted into super heated steam through the plant's boilers. This in turn powers steam turbines, much {{in the same way}} as a conventional thermal power station. Electricity is generated at 11 kilovolts. After exiting the turbines, the steam is condensed back to water. For the original two incinerating lines use river water from the Tees as a cooling medium, whereas in the third line, water is condensed through air cooled <b>condenser.</b> The cooled water is treated and reused in the boilers.|$|E
5|$|In July 1915, the Truxtun {{was on its}} way to Alaska when {{it broke}} down and was unable to {{continue}} its mission. Initially, the blame fell on Callaghan, who had apparently ordered incorrect parts for the <b>condenser.</b> He was suspended from duty and ordered to appear before a court-martial. Subsequent investigation, however, found that another man was responsible for the error and Callaghan received a full acquittal and was reinstated. A few months later, he was appointed as commanding officer of the Truxtun, but the stress of his trial appeared to have left its mark—at the age of 25 years, his hair had already turned gray.|$|E
