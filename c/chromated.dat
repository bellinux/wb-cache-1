5|$|Because {{of their}} toxicity, chromium(VI) salts {{are used for}} the {{preservation}} of wood. For example, <b>chromated</b> copper arsenate (CCA) is used in timber treatment to protect wood from decay fungi, wood-attacking insects, including termites, and marine borers. The formulations contain chromium based on the oxide CrO3 between 35.3% and 65.5%. In the United States, 65,300 metric tons of CCA solution were used in 1996.|$|E
25|$|As of 2002, US-based {{industries}} consumed 19,600 {{metric tons}} of arsenic. Ninety percent of this was used for treatment of wood with <b>chromated</b> copper arsenate (CCA).

In the United States, the voluntary phasing-out of arsenic in production of consumer products and residential and general consumer construction products began on 31 December 2003, and alternative chemicals are now used, such as Alkaline Copper Quaternary, borates, copper azole, cyproconazole, and propiconazole.|$|E
25|$|The {{toxicity}} of arsenic to insects, bacteria, and fungi {{led to its}} use as a wood preservative. In the 1930s, a process of treating wood with <b>chromated</b> copper arsenate (also known as CCA or Tanalith) was invented, and for decades, this treatment was the most extensive industrial use of arsenic. An increased appreciation of the {{toxicity of}} arsenic led to a ban of CCA in consumer products in 2004, initiated by the European Union and United States. However, CCA remains in heavy use in other countries (such as on Malaysian rubber plantations).|$|E

40|$|A {{study of}} the {{electrochemical}} oxidation of silver in <b>chromate</b> solutions, and the subsequent reduction of the silver <b>chromate</b> formed is described. In {{the absence of any}} <b>chromate,</b> only silver dissolution and deposition are observed.

At higher concentrations of <b>chromate,</b> the silver <b>chromate</b> formation peaks are fully resolved. The silver <b>chromate</b> grows as a film which, when formed from solutions with low <b>chromate</b> ion concentration (< 10 − 2 M), does not impede the silver dissolution reaction.

25|$|A main {{consideration}} regarding timber piles is {{that they}} should be protected from rotting above groundwater level. Timber will last for a long time below the groundwater level. For timber to rot, two elements are needed: water and oxygen. Below the groundwater level, dissolved oxygen is lacking even though there is ample water. Hence, timber tends to last for a long time below groundwater level. In 1648 the Royal Palace of Amsterdam was constructed on 13659 timber piles that still survive today since they were below groundwater level. Timber that is to be used above the water table can be protected from decay and insects by numerous forms of wood preservation using pressure treatment (alkaline copper quaternary (ACQ), <b>chromated</b> copper arsenate (CCA), creosote, etc.).|$|E
25|$|A {{variety of}} {{softwood}} and hardwoods timbers {{are used as}} ties, oak, jarrah and karri being popular hardwoods, although increasingly difficult to obtain, especially from sustainable sources. Some lines use softwoods, including Douglas fir; while they {{have the advantage of}} accepting treatment more readily, they are more susceptible to wear but are cheaper, lighter (and therefore easier to handle) and more readily available. Softwood is treated, while creosote is the most common preservative for railway ties, preservatives are also sometimes used such as pentachlorophenol, <b>chromated</b> copper arsenate and a few other preservatives. Sometimes non-toxic preservatives are used, such as copper azole or micronized copper. New boron-based wood preserving technology is being employed by major US railroads in a dual treatment process in order to extend the life of wood ties in wet areas. Some timbers (such as sal, mora, jarrah or azobé) are durable enough that they can be used untreated.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Cr(VI) (<b>chromate)</b> is a widespread, toxic and soluble {{environmental}} contaminant. Bacteria {{can reduce}} <b>chromate</b> to insoluble and less toxic Cr(III), and thus <b>chromate</b> bioremediation is of interest. Genetic and protein engineering of suitable enzymes can improve bacterial bioremediation. However, many fundamental parameters that define an organism’s capacity to remediate <b>chromate</b> have not previously been characterized. We have measured the innate {{ability of a}} wide range of bacteria to reduce <b>chromate.</b> All bacteria that we tested were able to reduce Cr(VI) through to stable Cr(III) end-products. One of these, Pseudomonas putida MK 1, is a promising candidate for <b>chromate</b> bioremediation, and we show that <b>chromate</b> transformation per mass unit increases in these cells as the environmental <b>chromate</b> concentration rises. However, bacterial growth is inhibited by <b>chromate</b> concentrations above 0. 8 mM. Furthermore, although cell extracts show increased <b>chromate</b> reductase activity under slow-growth conditions (mimicking nutrient-limited field conditions), the ability of the whole cells to transform <b>chromate</b> is greatly diminished. <b>Chromate</b> reduction by both whole cells and purified ChrR (a P. putida <b>chromate</b> reductase) is also inhibited by co-pollutants of chromate-contaminated sites. Thus, these studies identify several potential areas of improvement for generation of improved chromate-remediating bacteria...|$|R

40|$|<b>Chromate</b> is {{a common}} {{groundwater}} contaminant {{as a result of}} extensive industrial use. The fate and transport of <b>chromate</b> in subsurface environments are largely governed by adsorption to the surfaces of aluminum and iron oxides. Characterization of adsorption mechanisms is needed to constrain thermodynamic models, better predict the fate and transport of environmental pollutants, and expand our fundamental knowledge of surface geochemistry. However, the mechanisms of <b>chromate</b> adsorption in soils have remained unclear. This dissertation clarifies the mechanisms by which <b>chromate</b> adsorbs to aluminum and iron oxide minerals on the basis of molecular spectroscopy and quantum mechanical calculations. <b>Chromate</b> adsorption was first characterized on ferrihydrite using in situ attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR [...] FTIR) and theoretical frequency calculations. The effects of pH, aqueous <b>chromate</b> concentration, and ionic strength were investigated. It was determined that <b>chromate</b> primarily forms inner [...] sphere surface complexes on ferrihydrite. Monodentate complexes were observed to form at pH 3 ̆e 6 and at low surface coverage under acidic pH conditions. Bidentate complexes are dominant below pH 6 and at high surface coverage. Theoretical infrared frequencies are in close agreement with those observed experimentally. Characterization of the <b>chromate</b> adsorption on hematite was performed using in situ ATR [...] FTIR spectroscopy and extended X [...] ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectroscopy. The results were interpreted {{in the context of the}} optimized geometries and thermodynamics of the theoretical <b>chromate</b> [...] iron oxide cluster models. The results indicate that <b>chromate</b> binds to the surface of hematite in a similar manner as that of ferrihydrite; monodentate complexes dominate at high pH, and bidentate complexes dominate at low pH. The last system investigated was <b>chromate</b> adsorption on the surface of the aluminum oxyhydroxide boehmite. Both in situ ATR [...] FTIR and EXAFS spectroscopies were used to characterize <b>chromate</b> adsorption as a function of pH, ionic strength, and <b>chromate</b> and sulfate concentrations.
