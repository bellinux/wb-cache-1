25|$|Segestria florentina is {{the biggest}} European segestriid spider. Some common names are tube web spider or <b>cellar</b> <b>spider,</b> {{although}} neither are exclusive to this species.|$|E
25|$|To {{deal with}} predators such as birds, mammals, amphibians, and spiders, some species glue debris onto their bodies, while many play dead when disturbed. Many species {{practice}} autotomy; they detach their legs, which keep on moving {{for a period}} of time after, presumably to distract predators. Especially long-legged species vibrate their bodies ("bobbing"), probably also to confuse predators. This is similar to the behavior of the similar-looking but unrelated <b>cellar</b> <b>spider,</b> which vibrates wildly in its web when touched. Scent glands emit substances that can deter larger predators, but are also effective against ants.|$|E
500|$|The black house spider (Badumna insignis), the <b>cellar</b> <b>spider</b> (Pholcus phalangioides) and {{the giant}} daddy-long-legs spider (Artema atlanta) are known to prey on the redback spider, and redbacks are often absent if these species are present in {{significant}} numbers. [...] Agenioideus nigricornis, a spider wasp, is a parasitoid of the adult redback. Other wasps of the families Eurytomidae and Ichneumonidae parasitise redback eggs, and mantid lacewings (Neuroptera and Mantispidae) prey on redback eggs.|$|E
50|$|Uthina is a genus of Southeast Asian <b>cellar</b> <b>spiders</b> {{belonging}} to the subfamily Pholcinae, under the family Pholcidae. Like some other <b>cellar</b> <b>spiders,</b> Uthina spiders only have six eyes. The males of this genus also bear long eyestalks.|$|R

50|$|C. lyoni, {{like other}} <b>cellar</b> <b>spiders,</b> will violently gyrate {{their bodies in}} small circles when threatened. They can do this very rapidly, {{blurring}} their outline and making them very difficult to see. This behavior earned <b>cellar</b> <b>spiders</b> one of their common names - 'vibrating spiders' - and is presumed to be an antipredator adaptation. If this does not work, they will drop from their webs to the ground, or flee awkwardly with their characteristic long-legged gait.|$|R
25|$|Pholcidae, {{commonly}} known as <b>cellar</b> <b>spiders,</b> are a spider family in the suborder Araneomorphae. The family contains about 1500 species divided into about 80 genera.|$|R
50|$|Crossopriza lyoni is a {{widespread}} species of <b>cellar</b> <b>spiders</b> that prefer to live in or around human structures. They {{are commonly known as}} tailed <b>cellar</b> <b>spiders,</b> tailed daddy longlegs spiders, and sometimes box spiders. They all possess extremely long fragile legs that can reach up to 6 cm long and a body length of that ranges from 2.5 to 7 mm. Their abdomens are distinctly squarish when viewed from the side and their carapace is more or less circular when viewed from above. They also possess two kinds of sound-producing organs and have six eyes.|$|R

5000|$|They {{are small}} <b>cellar</b> <b>spiders</b> about 2 mm in maximum length. They have six eyes and usually spider type four pair of legs. Abdomen is {{globular}} and male has distinctive distal hinged sclerite on procursus in genitalia.|$|R
5000|$|Sihala is a genus of <b>cellar</b> <b>spiders</b> in {{the family}} Pholcidae, {{containing}} two species. The two species were once classified in the genus Pholcus, but were moved due {{to the absence of}} the characteristic sclerites shown in the bulb, and the unusually small and simple procursus.|$|R
5000|$|Micropholcus is a genus of long legged, {{relatively}} fragile, so-called <b>cellar</b> <b>spiders</b> of {{the family}} Pholcidae. The type species M. fauroti was first described by Simon in 1887. [...] The genus has a pantropical distribution. Micropholcus accepted a number of transfers from genus Leptopholcus in 2014, increasing its number of species to 15.|$|R

50|$|C. lyoni {{and other}} pholcids {{are often the}} subject of a popular urban legend about how they are the most venomous known animals except that 'their fangs are too small to {{penetrate}} human skin'. While they do possess potent venom against insects and other <b>spiders</b> (some <b>cellar</b> <b>spiders,</b> for example, prey on deadly redback spiders in Australia), their venom is not harmful to humans.|$|R
50|$|While doing no appreciable {{damage to}} humans, they are {{sometimes}} regarded as pests due to the large amounts of unattractive webs they construct inside houses. Unlike most spiders which consume their old webs before building new ones, <b>cellar</b> <b>spiders</b> simply abandon their old webs. There are often hundreds of individuals representing different generations living {{in close proximity to}} each other in a given area.|$|R
50|$|The {{cephalothorax}} is {{wider than}} it is long, greyish-white to pale amber in color. The carapace is subcircular. In {{the middle of the}} upper surface is a deep depression (called the thoracic fovea) and a darker longitudinal band of color. C. lyoni, like some other <b>cellar</b> <b>spiders,</b> only have six eyes. They are pearly-white in color and located {{at the tip of the}} cephalothorax in two groups of three.|$|R
