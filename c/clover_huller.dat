50|$|By {{the end of}} the 19th century, the Birdsell <b>Clover</b> <b>Huller</b> was {{the most}} popular <b>clover</b> <b>huller</b> in the United States. A farmer who {{invested}} a few hundred dollars in a Birdsell <b>Clover</b> <b>Huller</b> could use the seeds on his own farm as well as sell the excess to other farms. As the midwest replaced the east as the agricultural center of the United States, machines like the Birdsell <b>Clover</b> <b>Huller</b> (along with the Oliver Chilled Plow, the John Deere tractor, {{and a host of other}} new farm technologies) contributed towards Americaâ€™s shift from small, subsistence level farming to large, industrial farming.|$|E

50|$|The Birdsell <b>Clover</b> <b>Huller</b> {{was invented}} by John Comly Birdsell in 1855 in West Henrietta, New York (near Rochester). His machine both removed the hulls from the clover (threshing), removed the seeds from the hulls (hulling), and cleaned the seeds {{so they can be}} used or sold for animal feed and/or soil nutrients. Until the mid-18th century, this work was done by hand and by animal power, {{requiring}} a tremendous amount of manual labor for a relatively small reward.|$|E
