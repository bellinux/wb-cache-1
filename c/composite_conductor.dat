50|$|Al-Ca <b>composite</b> <b>conductor</b> {{was invented}} by Russell and Anderson at Ames Laboratory of the U.S. Department of Energy {{with the goal of}} {{developing}} the next generation power transmission cables. Al/Ca composite is produced by powder metallurgy and severe deformation processing (extrusion, swaging, wire drawing). This process would be roughly two to three times more expensive than conventional melt processing for ACSR. But the cost saving on tower construction is projected to be substantially larger than the extra cost of the conducting cables. During deformation processing, the Ca powder particles deform into filaments surrounded by the Al matrix, which avoids exposing calcium, a reactive element, to air and moisture.

40|$|International audienceThe aim of {{this work}} is to {{characterize}} the electrical conductivity of <b>composite</b> <b>conductors</b> deposited on an alumina substrate. Several half-wavelength coplanar resonators are realized using several pure conductors, silver (Ag), copper (Cu), gold (Au) and tin (Sn), to compare their quality factors (Q 0), related to losses, with those from analytical methods.

40|$|International audiencePurpose The paper {{deals with}} the {{development}} of an improved Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) –based numerical method for computing the effective properties of <b>composite</b> <b>conductors.</b> The convergence of the basic FFT-based methods is recognized to depend drastically on the contrast between the phases. For instance, the primal formulation is not suited for solving the problems with high conductivity whereas the dual formulation is computationally costly for problems with high resistivity. Consequently, it raises the problem of computing the properties of composites containing both highly conductive and resistive inclusions. Design/methodology/approach In the present work, the authors propose a new iterative shceme for solving that kind of problems which is formulated in terms of the polarization. FindingsThe capability and relevance of this iterative scheme is illustrated through numerical implementation in the case of composites containing suared inclusions. It is shown that the rate of convergence is increased and thus, particularly when the case of high contrasts is considered. The predominance of the polarization bazed iterative scheme over existing ones is also illustrated {{in the case of a}} composite containing both highly conductive and highly resistive inclusions. Originality/valueThe method is easy to implement and uses the same ingredients as the basic scheme: the FFT and the exact expression of the Green tensor in the Fourier space. Moreover, its convergence conditions do not depend on the conductivity properties of the constituents, which then constitutes the main difference with other existing iterative schemes. The method can then be applied for computing the effective properties of <b>composite</b> <b>conductors</b> with arbitrary contrasts...|$|R
