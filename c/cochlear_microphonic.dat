40|$|Background and Aim: Physiologic {{measures}} of cochlear and auditory nerve function {{may be of}} assis¬tance in distinguishing between hearing disorders due primarily to auditory nerve impairment from those due primarily to cochlear hair cells dysfunction. The goal of {{present study was to}} measure of co-chlear responses (otoacoustic emissions and <b>cochlear</b> <b>microphonics)</b> and auditory brainstem response in some adults with auditory neuropathy/ dys-synchrony and subjects with normal hearing. Materials and Methods: Patients were 16 adults (32 ears) in age range of 14 - 30 years with auditory neu¬ropathy/ dys-synchrony and 16 individuals in age range of 16 - 30 years from both sexes. The results of transient otoacoustic emissions, <b>cochlear</b> <b>microphonics</b> and auditory brainstem response measures were compared in both groups and the effects of age, sex, ear and degree of hearing loss were studied. Results: The pure-tone average was 48. 1 dB HL in auditory neuropathy/dys-synchrony group and the fre¬quency of low tone loss and flat audiograms were higher among other audiogram's shapes. Transient oto¬acoustic emissions were shown in all auditory neuropathy/dys-synchrony people except two cases and its average was near in both studied groups. The latency and amplitude of the biggest reversed co-chlear microphonics response were higher in auditory neuropathy/dys-synchrony patients than control peo¬ple significantly. The correlation between <b>cochlear</b> <b>microphonics</b> amplitude and degree of hearing loss was not significant, and age had significant effect in some <b>cochlear</b> <b>microphonics</b> measures. Audi-tory brainstem response had no response in auditory neuropathy/dys-synchrony patients even with low stim¬uli rates. Conclusion: In adults with speech understanding worsen than predicted from the degree of hearing loss that suspect to auditory neuropathy/ dys-synchrony, the frequency of low tone loss and flat audiograms are higher. Usually auditory brainstem response is absent in this patients and use of both otoacoustic emis¬sions and <b>cochlear</b> <b>microphonics</b> responses to measure cochlear hair cells function are suggested in them...|$|R

40|$|UNLABELLED: The aim of {{this work}} {{was to assess the}} hearing {{impairment}} in patients with hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy (HMSN). Elevation of pure tone thresholds in the presence of preserved inner ear function as suggested by <b>cochlear</b> <b>microphonics</b> (CM), absent or markedly abnormal brainstem auditory evoked potentials (BAEP), and elevation of speech perception out of proportion to the pure tone loss were found in the patients. From 28 members of a Gypsy family, we examined two siblings aged 31 and 30 years and their nephew aged 20 years, all suffering from HMSN that was associated with auditory neuropathy. All three affected members with difficulty of understanding speech had following investigations: pure tone and speech audiograms, BAEP, <b>cochlear</b> <b>microphonics,</b> and nerve conduction studies (NCV). RESULTS: the older two siblings had a flat 80 dB audiogram, whereas the younger one has flat 20 dB audiogram on the Lt. ear and 30 dB audiogram on the Rt. ear. All had no speech comprehension and no BAEP. Two patients had preserved <b>cochlear</b> <b>microphonics</b> on one ear. Peripheral nerves were electrically not elicitable, however, {{at the beginning of the}} disease nerve conduction was slow. CONCLUSION: in all three affected members with distinct clinical picture of HMSN their hearing impairment was proved to be due to severe auditory neuropathy in the presence of preserved inner ear function...|$|R
50|$|As the basilar {{membrane}} vibrates, the hair cells {{attached to this}} membrane are rhythmically pushed up against the tectorial membrane, bending the hair cell stereocilia. This opens mechanically gated ion channels on the hair cell, allowing influx of potassium (K+) and calcium(Ca2+) ions. The flow of ions generates an AC current through the hair cell surface, at the same frequency as the acoustic stimulus. This measurable AC voltage is called the <b>cochlear</b> <b>microphonic</b> (CM), which mimics the stimulus. The hair cells function as a transducer, converting the mechanical movement of the {{basilar membrane}} into electrical voltage, in a process requiring ATP from the stria vascularis as an energy source.|$|E

The FFR may have been accidentally discovered back in 1930; however, renewed interest in defining the FFR did not occur until the mid-1960s.

40|$|To {{clarify the}} {{pathogenesis}} of acute low-tone sensorineural hearing loss (ALHL), we retrospectively compared the electrocochleo-graphic findings from 20 patients with ALHL with those from 58 patients with Meniere's disease (MD) classified into 4 groups (MD 1 through MD 4) according to their pure tone average. The mean summating potential-action potential ratio in the ALHL group was 0. 35 ± 0. 13, which {{was significantly higher than}} the control ratio but similar to the ratio seen in the MDt group (pure tone average < 25 dB hearing level). The mean detection threshold of the <b>cochlear</b> <b>microphonics</b> in the ALHL group was 32. 0 ± 9. 4 dB normal hearing level, which was again similar to that seen in the MD 1 group. Moreover, more than 50 % of patients with ALHL had normal <b>cochlear</b> <b>microphonics</b> input-output curves. We therefore conclude that {{the pathogenesis of}} ALHL arises from an endolym-phatic hydrops with little or no impairment of hair cells that resembles early-stage MD.

40|$|The {{mechanism}} of hearing loss {{due to the}} administration of intravenous erythromycin was investigated in the albino guinea pig, and it was found {{for the first time}} that this drug causes cochlear dysfunction. The endocochlear potential (EP) and the <b>cochlear</b> <b>microphonics</b> (CM) recorded at the first cochlear turn transiently decreased when erythromycin was administered intravenously at dosages of 100 and 150 mg/kg. The averaged maximum decrease in EP was 16 mV (n = 5) and 33 mV (n = 5) for 100 and 150 mg/kg, respectively. The maximum decrease in the CM was about 25 % when the EP reached its lowest value with the injection of 150 mg/kg. A complete recovery of the EP and CM ensued within 20 minutes after each erythromycin dose. The perilymphatic perfusion of 3 mmol/L of erythromycin decreased the EP and CM; however, in contrast to the intravenous administration, the decrease of the CM was nearly complete and both the EPand CM were irreversible. Hearing loss due to intravenously administered erythromycin could likely be attributable to the transient dysfunction of the stria vascularis, although concomitant dysfunction of the central auditory pathway cannot be excluded.

40|$|Postnatal {{development}} of the mustached bat's cochlea was studied by measuring <b>cochlear</b> <b>microphonic</b> and compound action potentials. In adults, a cochlear resonance is involved in enhanced tuning to the second harmonic constant frequency component (CF 2) of their echolocation calls at ~ 61 kHz This resonance is present immediately after birth in bats that do not yet echolocate. Its frequency is lower (46 kHz) and the corresponding threshold minimum of <b>cochlear</b> <b>microphonic</b> potentials is broader than in adults. Long-lasting ringing of the <b>cochlear</b> <b>microphonic</b> potential after tone stimulus offset that characterizes the adult auditory response close to CF 2 is absent in newborns. In {{the course of the}} first 5 postnatal weeks, there is a concomitant upward shift of CF 2 and the frequency of cochlear threshold minima.

Between 2 and 4 wk of age, two <b>cochlear</b> <b>microphonic</b> threshold minima are found consistently in the CF 2 range that differ in their level-dependent dynamic growth behavior and are 1. 5 ¿ 5. 7 kHz apart from each other. In older animals, there is a single minimum that approaches adult tuning in its sharpness. The data provide evidence to show that during maturation of the cochlea, the frequency and the sensitivity of the threshold minimum associated with CF 2 increases and that these increases are associated with the fusion of two resonances that are partly dissociated in developing animals...|$|E

Both auditory nerve and brainstem activities recorded as far-field potentials are typically undetectable whereas cochlear outer hair activities (otoacoustic emissions and/or <b>cochlear</b> <b>microphonics)</b> are normal. We have recorded both receptor (summating potential [SP]; <b>cochlear</b> <b>microphonics</b> [CMs]) and auditory nerve (compound action potential [CAP]) activities by transtympanic electrocochleography (ECochG). We studied cochlear potentials bilaterally from eight {{children and adults}} with AN by an electrode placed on the promontory.

The results were compared with the ECochG results from 16 children who were tested because of a suspected hearing loss but {{were found to have}} normal thresholds of CAPs. Cochlear potentials were identified in all AN subjects and were prolonged in duration and reduced in amplitude compared to controls. CAPs were identified in 4 / 16 AN cochlea only to high intensity stimuli. In the remaining ears it was difficult to separately identify the CAP and the SP within the broad cochlear potential. In contrast, CMs were identified in all AN subjects and did not differ significantly in amplitude from controls. Also SPs when identified were of normal amplitude. We used rapid stimulus rates in six of the AN subjects to help distinguish the generator sources of the prolonged cochlear potentials by taking advantage of different amount of adaptation involving CAP and SP. We identified the presence of several different physiological abnormalities including preserved receptor and CAPs, preserved receptor and attenuated CAPs, and absence of CAPs.

40|$|The cochlea {{converts}} sound vibration into electrical impulses and amplifies the low-level sound signal. Urethane, {{a widely}} used anesthetic in animal research, {{has been shown}} to reduce the neural responses to auditory stimuli. However, the effects of urethane on cochlea, especially on the function of outer hair cells, remain largely unknown. In the present study, we compared the <b>cochlear</b> <b>microphonic</b> responses between awake and urethane-anesthetized rats. The results revealed that the amplitude of the <b>cochlear</b> <b>microphonic</b> was decreased by urethane, resulting in an increase in the threshold at all of the sound frequencies examined. To deduce the possible mechanism underlying the urethane-induced decrease in cochlear sensitivity, we examined the electrical response properties of isolated outer hair cells using whole-cell patch-clamp recording. We found that urethane hyperpolarizes the outer hair cell membrane potential in a dose-dependent manner and elicits larger outward current. This urethane-induced outward current was blocked by strychnine, an antagonist of the α 9 subunit of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor. Meanwhile, the function of the outer hair cell motor protein, prestin, was not affected.

When the frequency of the sound stimulus was progressively increased from 100 Hz to 4 kHz, the 'periodic' (a. c.) component of the receptor potential was attenuated with respect to the 'continuous' (d. c.) component. The characteristics of the inner hair cells could be described by two stages of low-pass filtering, with one of the filters having the same corner frequency as the electrical time constants which varied in different cells between 178 and 840 Hz. Receptor potentials recorded intracellularly from two morphologically identified outer hair cells were symmetrical about the resting membrane potential (about - 65 - 70 mV) and had a maximal amplitude of only 5 mV at frequencies and intensities which yield 20 - 30 mV voltage responses from inner hair cells. No d. c. component receptor potentials were recorded in response to high-frequency tones. Phase and amplitude measurements were made from receptor potentials from inner hair cells, and from 'cochlear microphonic potentials' which were recorded from the organ of Corti and scala tympani. The phase of depolarization in both potentials was associated with displacement of the basilar membrane towards the scala vestibuli. The phase of the intracellular receptor potentials leads the <b>cochlear</b> <b>microphonic</b> by about 90 degrees and the sound pressure by about 180 degrees at frequencies below 100 Hz. Above this frequency the phase lead progressively declines and at higher frequencies becomes a phase lag. These phase relationships indicate that inner hair cells respond to the velocity of the basilar membrane at frequencies below 200 - 600 Hz, and to its displacement above this, and that the voltage responses of the inner hair cells are limited by their membrane time constants. It is suggested that outer hair cells respond to basilar membrane displacement throughout their frequency range. It is shown that, with respect to frequency, the different growth rates of the <b>cochlear</b> <b>microphonic</b> potentials and inner hair cell receptor potentials, and the dominance of <b>cochlear</b> <b>microphonic</b> potentials in the organ of Corti, result in an effective electrical interaction between inner hair cells and <b>cochlear</b> <b>microphonic</b> potentials...|$|E
40|$|When special {{pseudo-random}} stimuli sequences (maximum length sequences: MLS) {{are combined}} with a deconvolution analysis technique, {{it is possible to}} derive new evoked potential components that are called kernels. The kernels give a measure of the temporal interactions that take place between the responses to successive stimuli. This may provide an objective neurophysiological test for the exploration of a dimension of hearing which has hitherto been limited to psychophysical methods. Until now, auditory short-latency kernels obtained by the MLS method have been related to the late portion of the brainstem auditory evoked potential (BAEP), suggesting that temporal interactions occur rather late in the auditory pathways. We report 4 children without any BAEP neural components, who all retained isolated <b>cochlear</b> <b>microphonic</b> potentials. Three of them produced click-evoked otoacoustic emissions and two of them demonstrated only moderately impaired audiometric thresholds. This combination of absent BAEP neural components with preserved otoacoustic emissions and <b>cochlear</b> <b>microphonic</b> potential corresponds to a peculiar pattern of auditory dysfunction recently coined 'auditory neuropathy'. All 4 children exhibited well-defined kernels at latencies consistent with the microphonic potential. These data indicate that the cochlea itself can generate kernels at a presynaptic level. They open up the question of the identification of the physiological site(s) responsible for the generation of MLS-evoked kernels. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Inland Ltd...|$|E

40|$|Introduction Auditory neuropathy/dyssynchrony (AN/AD) {{comprises}} {{a spectrum}} of pathology affecting the auditory pathways anywhere from the inner hair cells to the brainstem. It is characterized by an absent or atypical auditory brainstem response (ABR) with preservation of the <b>cochlear</b> <b>microphonics</b> and/or otoacoustic emissions (OAEs). Objective Retrospective analysis of patients with AN/AD. Methods Fifteen patients with AN/AD were {{included in this study}} and their records were retrospectively investigated. Results Possible etiology of AN/AD was neonatal hyperbilirubinemia in three patients, family history of hearing loss in three patients, consanguineous marriage in two patients, head trauma in two patients, mental motor retardation in one patient, cerebrovascular disease in one patient, and there was no apparent cause in three patients. Conclusion Otolaryngologists should keep in mind the diagnosis of AN/AD especially in patients complaining of difficulty in hearing and speech and audiological evidence of disassociation between pure tone and speech audiometry. ABR and OAE testing is recommended in these patients for AN/AD diagnosis...|$|R
40|$|Hearing loss in Varitint-waddler-J (VaJ) mice is {{of mixed}} origin with both cochleo-saccular and neuroepithelial components. Both VaJ/VaJ and VaJ/+ mutants show {{impaired}} cochlear function, but the homozygotes are more severely affected than heterozygotes. Neither group have any detectable compound action potential. <b>Cochlear</b> <b>microphonics</b> are only seen in {{half of the}} heterozygotes, at a reduced amplitude and raised threshold, and are not detected in any homozygotes. Summating potentials (SP) responses are seen {{in most of the}} heterozygotes, at high stimulus levels. The only responses in homozygotes were negative SPs seen in half of the mutants at very high sound levels, while the remaining homozygotes showed no responses to sound stimulation. Endocochlear potentials (EP) were often small or absent in both groups of mutants, with the homozygotes being more severely affected. Reduced pigmentation in the stria vascularis appears to be associated with a reduced EP, while a primary defect of the neuroepithelium, detectable by electron microscopy in hair cells of 14 day old mice, dramatically influences evoked potentials...|$|R
40|$|Using {{a simple}} {{model of the}} birds 2 ̆ 7 {{binaural}} pressure difference acoustic receivers {{it was predicted that}} the interaural delay achieved by birds at low frequencies is far greater than that of mammals with a similar head-size. This was upheld when interaural delay was recorded, between the <b>cochlear</b> <b>microphonics,</b> for six species. Stimulus positions were varied over the azimuthal range from the frontal midline to the interaural axis. Predicted delays were frequency dependent (higher frequency, smaller delay), as were the actual delays, and the magnitude of the measured delays were comparable with predictions. Delays measured at high frequencies were close to those expected from pathlength around the head, but delays measured at low frequencies could be more than three times this expectation. This finding raises the possibility that interaural delay may be a useful localization cue in birds, even for those species with very small heads, since the large delays at low frequencies are sufficient to provide a physiological cue to azimuth...|$|R
