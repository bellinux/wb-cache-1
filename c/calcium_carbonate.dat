5|$|In {{the first}} case, acetic acid reacts with the <b>calcium</b> <b>carbonate</b> (one {{of the main}} {{components}} of freshwater, marine and land shells, birds' eggs and other such specimens) producing calcium acetate, a salt. Formaldehyde can be oxidized by the oxygen in air to create formic acid, which then has basically the same effects as acetic acid, reacting with <b>calcium</b> <b>carbonate</b> to produce a salt. The salts (calcium acetate and calcium formate) crystallize through the specimen's outer surface, destroying its fine detail and exposing more areas for further reaction. As the condition progresses, the salt crystals build up over the specimen's surface, which becomes increasingly eroded.|$|E

5|$|One {{important}} element {{for the formation}} of skeletal material in marine animals is calcium, but <b>calcium</b> <b>carbonate</b> becomes more soluble with pressure, so carbonate shells and skeletons dissolve below its compensation depth. <b>Calcium</b> <b>carbonate</b> also becomes more soluble at lower pH, so ocean acidification is likely to have profound effects on marine organisms with calcareous shells, such as oysters, clams, sea urchins, and corals, because their ability to form shells will be reduced, and the carbonate compensation depth will rise closer to the sea surface. Affected planktonic organisms will include the snail-like molluscs known as pteropods, and single-celled algae called coccolithophorids and foraminifera. All of these are important parts of the food chain and a diminution in their numbers will have significant consequences. In tropical regions, corals are likely to be severely affected as it becomes more difficult to build their <b>calcium</b> <b>carbonate</b> skeletons, in turn adversely impacting other reef dwellers.|$|E

40|$|A {{combined}} approach using solid state electroanalysis (abrasive stripping voltammetry) and ESR spectroscopy {{was made to}} characterize the different species of manganese which are present in natural and synthetic <b>calcium</b> <b>carbonates.</b> Abrasive stripping voltammetry permits identifying Mn 02 and MnC 03, but the method fails {{when it comes to}} detecting unambiguously MnC 03 in the presenee of Mn 02. Neither can this method detect Mn 2 + ions in mixed crystals of Cal_xMIlxC 03 because of their low concentrations. ESR spectroscopy can show that Mn 2 + ions are present in calcite on Ca 2 + sites. Additionally, information about the state and symmetry of Mn 2 + site s and the local dynamics of the lattice can be obtained. In aragonite, only extremely small amounts of individual Mn 2 + ions are present and most of the manganese is found in the form of Mn 02 agglomerates.

5|$|Both {{groups have}} a shell {{consisting}} of two valves, but {{the organization of the}} shell is quite different in the two groups. In brachiopods, the two valves are positioned on the dorsal and ventral surfaces of the body, while in bivalves, the valves are on the left and right sides of the body, and are, in most cases, mirror images of one other. Brachiopods have a lophophore, a coiled, rigid cartilaginous internal apparatus adapted for filter feeding, a feature shared with two other major groups of marine invertebrates, the bryozoans and the phoronids. Brachiopod shells are often made of calcium phosphate as well as <b>calcium</b> <b>carbonate,</b> whereas bivalve shells are composed entirely of <b>calcium</b> <b>carbonate.</b>|$|E

5|$|Fossil Springs, {{the source}} of about 80percent {{of the water in}} Fossil Creek, issues from several vents in close {{proximity}} to one another {{at the base of the}} Mogollon Rim.

40|$|Cyanobacteria have {{affected}} major geochemical cycles (carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen) on Earth {{for billions of}} years. In particular, they have {{played a major role}} in the formation of <b>calcium</b> <b>carbonates</b> (i. e., calcification), which has been considered to be an extracellular process. We identified a cyanobacterium in modern microbialites in Lake Alchichica (Mexico) that forms intracellular amorphous calcium-magnesium-strontium-barium carbonate inclusions about 270 nanometers in average diameter, revealing an unexplored pathway for calcification. Phylogenetic analyses place this cyanobacterium within the deeply divergent order Gloeobacterales. The chemical composition and structure of the intracellular precipitates suggest some level of cellular control on the biomineralization process. This discovery expands the diversity of organisms capable of forming amorphous <b>calcium</b> <b>carbonates.</b> Cyanobacteria constitute a phylogenetical-ly diverse group of bacteria that can car-ry out oxygenic photosynthesis (1).

Here, using evolutionary crystal structure prediction method USPEX, we systematically explore the MgO-CO 2 and CaO-CO 2 systems at pressures ranging from 0 to 160 GPa to search for thermodynamically stable magnesium and <b>calcium</b> <b>carbonates.</b> While MgCO 3 is the only stable magnesium <b>carbonate,</b> three <b>calcium</b> <b>carbonates</b> are stable under pressure: well-known CaCO 3, and newly predicted Ca 3 CO 5 and CaC 2 O 5. Ca 3 CO 5 polymorphs are found to contain isolated orthocarbonate CO 44 - tetrahedra, and are stable at relatively low pressures (> 11 GPa), whereas CaC 2 O 5 is stable above 33 GPa and its polymorphs feature polymeric motifs made of CO 4 -tetrahedra. We further analyze chemical stability of Ca 3 CO 5 and CaC 2 O 5 in the environment typical of the Earth's mantle and find that only CaCO 3, but not Ca 3 CO 5 or CaC 2 O 5, can exist in the chemical environment of the Earth's mantle.

40|$|Dredging of ports, {{harbours}} and waterways generates {{vast amounts}} of sediments that find few applications {{and need to be}} disposed of. In the port of Antwerp, Belgium, each year 450. 000 t (dry matter) of dredging sediments are mechanically dewatered and stockpiled. This paper investigates flash calcination of the clay-rich dredged sediments as a sustainable solution to develop novel pozzolanic supplementary cementitious materials (SCM) for blended cement. The dredging sediments were mainly comprised of clay minerals (2 : 1 clays and kaolinite), quartz, <b>calcium</b> <b>carbonates</b> and an amorphous phase. Sulfur and chloride contents were relatively low. Flash calcination at 820, 865 and 905 °C reduced the total organic carbon fraction but did not alter the content of chloride and sulfate. The clay minerals in the dredged sediments were entirely dehydroxylated and <b>calcium</b> <b>carbonates</b> were largely decarbonated by the calcination treatment. Part of the CaO released in the decomposition of the <b>calcium</b> <b>carbonates</b> reacted with the dehydroxylated clays to form the main reactive amorphous component at 45 - 51 mass%. Another part of the CaO reacted with sulfate to form around 2 mass% of anhydrite. Electron microscopy showed that the Ca-rich reactive material partly consisted of spherical particles indicative for melt formation. Melt formation and sintering were more extensive at higher calcination temperatures (865 and 905 °C); they did not change the particle size distribution significantly, but led to a remarkable reduction in the BET specific surface area and related particle surface roughness. The calcined dredging sediments clearly demonstrated a pozzolanic reactivity superior to that of Class F fly ash, which demonstrates their high potential as a new pozzolanic SCM for the production of low-CO 2 blended cements. status: publishe...|$|R
