5000|$|Labour Cost: During {{installation}} MI cable {{must not}} be bent repeatedly as this will cause work hardening and cracks in the cladding and cores. A minimum bend radius must be observed and the cable must be supported at regular intervals. The magnesium oxide insulation is hygroscopic so MICC cable must be protected from moisture until it has been terminated. Termination requires stripping back the copper cladding and attaching a <b>compression</b> <b>gland</b> fitting. Individual conductors are insulated with plastic sleeves. A sealing tape, insulating putty or an epoxy resin is then poured into the <b>compression</b> <b>gland</b> fitting to provide a watertight seal. If a termination is faulty due to workmanship or damage then the magnesium oxide will absorb moisture and lose its insulating properties. Depending on the size and number of conductors, a single termination can take between 1 and 2 hours of labour (an electrician {{should be able to}} make a termination in 10 to 15 minutes on up to 4 core smaller sizes). Installation of a three-conductor MI cable (size No. 10 AWG — about 5 square mm) takes about 65% more time than installation of a PVC-sheathed armoured cable of the same conductor size. Installation of MICC is therefore a costly task. Certain PTFE, silicone or other polymer-insulated cables have been substituted in applications which require similar properties in terms of flame spread, which use less labour to terminate. MICC is still used in applications which are particularly suited to its combination of properties.|$|E
50|$|Apart from viral infection, other infections, such as bacterial, {{can cause}} {{parotitis}} (acute suppurative parotitis or chronic parotitis). These infections may cause blockage of the duct by salivary duct calculi or external <b>compression.</b> Parotid <b>gland</b> swellings {{can also be}} due to benign lymphoepithelial lesions caused by Mikulicz disease and Sjögren syndrome. Swelling of the parotid gland may also indicate the eating disorder bulimia nervosa, creating {{the look of a}} heavy jaw line. With the inflammation of mumps or obstruction of the ducts, increased levels of the salivary alpha amylase secreted by the parotid gland can be detected in the blood stream.|$|R
40|$|Acute {{suppurative}} parotitis is {{uncommon in}} children and is very rare in neonates. Most common organism isolated is Staphylococcus aureus. We present a 15 -day-old full-term breast-fed female neonate with left-sided acute parotid abscess. The baby presented with a left preauricular swelling, pain and redness. Pus was exuded from left Stensen's duct on <b>compression</b> of the <b>gland</b> externally. Early diagnosis and proper intravenous antibiotics are {{the keys to the}} treatment...|$|R
40|$|Intrathoracic goiters {{are defined}} as the {{extension}} of the thyroid gland into the mediastinum. Superior Vena Cava (SVC) syndrome due to the compression of major vessels can be seen in these patients. Most cases of SVC syndrome occur as a complication of malignancy. A 75 -year-old female, non-smoker, was admitted with complaints of the midline neck swell- ing for the past 45 years, mild puffiness of face, breathlessness on lying down and dry cough for last 5 years. On clinical examination, there was a massive grade IV thyromegaly. Neck computed tomography revealed a heterogeneous, hyper- trophic, nodular thyroid gland with multiple calcification and mediastinal extension with narrowed trachea. Intraoperatively, there was a huge retrosternal thyroid <b>gland</b> <b>compression</b> of the right brachiocephalic vein, the brachiocephalic trunk from behind the vessel and the right carotid artery along with the right internal jugular vein. Pathological examination showed a nodular colloid goitre without signs of malignancy. When SVC syndrome is secondary to benign thyroid disease, total thyroidectomy should be performed.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{investigate}} the visual evoked potentials (VEP) in patients with pineal gland cyst. The hypothesis is that patological changes of VEP can be used to detect compressive effect of pineal gland cyst on surrounding brain structures which are part of the visual pathway. Pattern-reversal checkerboard VEPs (PSVEP) were recorded in 68 patients (46 female and 22 male, mean age 28, 7 ± 17, 6 years) with pineal gland cyst detected on MR of the brain (subject group) and 68 control subjects with normal MR of the brain (control group). Amplitudes and P 100 latencies were collected and afterwards grouped as: 1.) normal VEP, 2.) prechiasmal, 4.) postchiasmal and 3.) prechiasmal and postchiasmal VEP disfunction. VEP findings differed significantly between subject and control group (p< 0, 001), mainly due to the postchiasmal disfunction frequency in the subject group. VEP findings differed significantly according to the volume of the pineal gland cyst (p= 0, 001) with more frequent pathological VEP findings among subjects with larger pineal gland cysts. Pathological VEP findings were significantly more frequent in patients with described <b>compression</b> of pineal <b>gland</b> cyst on surrounding brain structures (p= 0, 024). This study shows that VEP serve as a useful method to determine the functional impairment of visual pathway in patients with pineal gland cyst...|$|R
40|$|A {{hybrid gene}} {{comprising}} the bovine thyroglobulin gene promoter and the coding region for the simian virus- 40 large T- and small t-antigens {{was used to}} generate 30 transgenic mice by microinjection into the pronuclei of single cell embryos. All animals except three developed, as single primitive pathology, a dramatic enlargement of the thyroid <b>gland.</b> <b>Compression</b> of trachea and esophagus, accompanied by dyspnea, inspiratory stridor, and dysphagia, led to a progressive cachexia and premature death attributed to respiratory failure. Despite the large thyroid volume, T 4 levels were abnormally low, and the progression of the syndrome could be delayed by a substitutive treatment with thyroid hormones. The rapid evolution of the disease, leading {{to the death of}} most founder transgenic animals before the breeding age, prevented transmission of the transgene to their offspring. Only two transgenic lines are presently surviving. Immunohistochemical analysis of the tissues revealed a specific expression of the simian virus- 40 antigens in the thyroid cells. Hyperplasia was already obvious at birth. Older animals displayed moderately to poorly differentiated thyroid adenocarcinomas. Electron microscopy revealed, however, the persistence of cell polarity and the presence of microfollicles between the densely packed cells. Cell lines derived from these large T-expressing thyroids were shown to have lost expression of both thyroglobulin and thyroperoxidase, while expressing low levels of TSH receptors. These transgenic mice could constitute an interesting model of aggressive adenocarcinoma, sharing phenotypical similarities with the anaplastic type of human thyroid tumors.

40|$|Milk {{was added}} intraductally in 0 =. ml {{increments}} to previously emptied mammary glands in rats. Direct microscopic {{observations of the}} glands showed that each increment of milk did not distribute evenly either within a single lobule or among lobules. Increase of the intramammary pressure either by i. v. injection of oxytocin or by <b>compression</b> of the <b>gland</b> between thumb and forefinger, distributed the milk more evenly within the gland. These observations led to the routine injection of 1 =. - 3 =. mu. oxytocin in order to distribute each increment of milk evenly throughout the gland. The intramammary pressure response of the gland to different doses of oxytocin was then determined. The rises in intramammary pressure above equilibrium pressure in response to 0 =. and 1 =. mu. oxytocin increased fourfold on average with increasing gland volume over the compliant portion of the static pressure-volume curve. The slopes of the dose oxytocin-intra-mammary pressure response lines became progressively steeper and shifted to the left as {{the volume of the}} mammary gland increased, indicating a progressive reduction in the dose of oxytocin required to elicit a given response. No differences were noted between rats lactating for 9 - 13 days and those lactating for 20 - 24 days. In a related study the duct system ofthe rat gland was found to contain little fluid even after 8 h ofnon-suckling, though it became filled swiftly after a single i. v. injection of oxytocin. Non-suckling for 16 - 24 h was required to overcome passively the resistance to entry of milk from the alveoli...|$|R
