40|$|AbstractA {{new model}} for calculating the {{response}} of electrical <b>cables</b> <b>to</b> <b>bending</b> has been developed accounting for multi-order helical structure and frictional effects. Stresses occurring in wires {{and the number of}} slipping wires were suggested as key properties in terms of expectation of cable life time. The model was applied <b>to</b> chosen <b>cables</b> and the magnitudes of the mentioned key properties were calculated. Parametric study was also done to investigate how these values are affected by changing the properties of the cable. It has been shown that increasing the pressure from jacket or insulation material causes larger stress while it prevents the slippage of wires. Applying a tensile force <b>to</b> the <b>cable</b> produces the same result, whereas using larger lay angles for both conductors and wires decreases internal stress and prevents the slippage...|$|R
40|$|Aircraft {{fuel tank}} leakage {{is a very}} common {{maintenance}} problem. A continuum robot is designed for troubleshooting of leaks for fuel tank which has strong constraints and is also explosive. The biomimetic robot with several flexible sections applies actuation redundancy through pulling its four independent driving <b>cables</b> <b>to</b> realize <b>bending</b> motion of {{two degrees of freedom}} (DOF). The forward kinematics about the relations of cables lengths, angles and tip coordinates of single section is established using projection curvature method and coordinates transformation method. The decoupled multi-section kinematics function is deduced based on the kinematics analysis of single section. Simulations of single section motion are presented. We demonstrate finally the correctness of kinematics method through prototype experiments.  </p...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the factors}} in {{assessing}} the applicability of wire or cable on the lunar surface is its flexibility under extreme cold conditions. Existing wire specifications did not address their mechanical behavior under cold, cryogenic temperature conditions. Therefore tests were performed to provide this information. To assess this characteristic 35 different insulated wire and cable pieces were cold soaked in liquid nitrogen. The segments were then subjected <b>to</b> <b>bending</b> and the force was recorded. Any failure of the insulation or jacketing was also documented for each sample tested. The bending force tests were performed at room temperature to provide a comparison to the change in force needed <b>to</b> <b>bend</b> the samples due to the low temperature conditions. The results from the bending tests were plotted and showed how various types of insulated wire and <b>cable</b> responded <b>to</b> <b>bending</b> under cold conditions. These results were then used to estimate the torque needed to unroll the wire under these low temperature conditions...|$|R
40|$|A {{theoretical}} and {{experimental study of}} mechanical properties of electrical cables with multi order helical structure has been performed. Relations between applied deformations and local strains in the first order helical structure have been developed. The model is then generalized with a hierarchical approach where the strains at any order helical structure are expressed as functions of strains in the upper order helix {{under the assumption that}} all components are sticking to each other. The force balance between the strains and the friction forces is considered. When the <b>cable</b> is exposed <b>to</b> small <b>bending</b> curvature, the slippage of the component is prevented by the frictional force. At this stage, the components of the cable behave as solid beams. Slippage occurs between the components when the tensile force in the components overcomes the frictional force. This state occurs at sufficiently large bending curvatures and results in a variable bending stiffness varying with the magnitude of the applied bending curvature. The response of the <b>cable</b> <b>to</b> pure <b>bending</b> is measured and the data is evaluated using the theoretical model described above. Magnitudes of un- known properties of the cable are estimated by comparing the {{theoretical and}} experimental data. To utilize the model in terms of life time estimation, a number of parameters were suggested to relate the mechanical properties of the <b>cable</b> <b>to</b> wear and fatigue. A parametric study has been done to investigate how these parameters are affected by changing cable properties or the loading condition. QC 2010120...|$|R
50|$|The {{compound}} bow, not to {{be confused}} with a composite bow, is a modern bow that uses a levering system, usually of <b>cables</b> and pulleys, <b>to</b> <b>bend</b> the limbs.The limbs of a compound bow are much stiffer than those of a recurve bow or longbow. This limb stiffness makes the compound bow more energy-efficient than other bows, in conjunction with the pulley/cams. The typical compound bow has its string applied to pulleys (cams), and one or both of the pulleys have one or more <b>cables</b> attached <b>to</b> the opposite limb. When the string is drawn back, the string causes the pulleys to turn. When the draw commences, the archer has reduced mechanical advantage, but during the draw, as the pulley cams rotate, and the archer gains mechanical advantage over the bending limbs, more energy is stored, in comparison to other bows.|$|R
5000|$|The zip-line trolley is {{the frame}} or {{assembly}} {{together with the}} pulley(s) also known as sheave(s) inside that run along the cable. (The term [...] "trolley" [...] is more often used when this assembly consists {{of more than a}} single pulley with simple hanger and bearing.) Often more than one pulley is used to spread the load over more than one spot on the <b>cable,</b> <b>to</b> reduce <b>cable</b> <b>bending</b> stresses that may lead to metal fatigue and cable breakage. This also reduces any tendency of a pulley to twist sideways and run off the cable, with disastrous results. In addition, the trolley is usually shaped with guards <b>to</b> hold the <b>cable</b> in the groove(s) of the pulley(s).|$|R
40|$|A common coil {{design for}} a high-field {{accelerator}} dipole magnet using a Nb{sub 3 }Sn cable with the React-and-Wind approach is pursued by a collaboration between Fermilab and LBNL. The design requirements for the cable include a high operating current so that a field of 10 - 11 T can be produced, together with a low critical current degradation due <b>to</b> <b>bending</b> around a 90 mm radius. A program, using ITER strands of the internal tin type, was launched to develop the optimal cable design for React-and-Wind common coil magnets. Three prototype cable designs, all 15 mill wide, were fabricated: a 41 -strand cable with 0. 7 mm diameter strands; a 57 -strand cable with 0. 5 mm diameter strands; and a 259 strand multi-level cable with a 6 -around- 1 sub-element using 0. 3 mm diameter wire. Two versions of these cables were fabricated: one with no core and one with a stainless steel core. Additionally, {{the possibility of a}} wide (22 mm) cable made from 0. 7 mm strand was explored. This paper describes the first results of the cable program including reports on cable fabrication and reaction, first winding tests and first results of the measurement of the critical current degradation due <b>to</b> <b>cabling</b> and <b>bending...</b>|$|R
40|$|Safety of {{suspension}} {{bridges and}} stay-cable bridges is {{depending on the}} durability of the cables. The latter show an apparent healthy aspect over their observable lengths but in fact can be damaged in the hidden parts (anchorages). In this study, Acoustic Emission (AE) is used in order to detect and to locate broken wires in the anchorages areas. The acoustic activity {{in the presence of}} broken wires comes from interwire friction. When damaged, the reference cables are put in vibration and some acoustic parameters can be used to highlight difference between them. The main parameters of the acoustic signals are the total number of count and the cumulated energy. To better understand the interwire fretting mechanism, a study of the behaviour of a broken wire in a tight <b>cable</b> subject <b>to</b> dynamic <b>bending</b> has been carried out. This contributes to define the conditions of vibrating for AE detection. The interwire fretting mechanism and its detection are influenced by the change of roughness, lubrication and interwire contact strength.

40|$|The {{application}} of cable bolts as a secondary support system {{is an increasing}} trend in underground coal mines worldwide. The performances of cable bolts have been evaluated under both axial and shear loading conditions. Two methods of testing cables for shear, single and double shear, have been recognised. This paper examines the shear behaviour {{of a variety of}} cable bolts under different pre-tension loads by double shear testing. Plain, spiral and the combination of both cable types were used in this study. The initial axial load and the type of cable bolts are the main factors affecting their shear strength. By increasing the axial pre-tension load, the peak shear load occurs at lower shear displacement. The failure angle due <b>to</b> <b>cable</b> <b>bending</b> across the joint at different pre-tension loads varied between 41 ° and 49 °. This demonstrates that the ratio of axial and perpendicular displacements is almost constant and on average the failure occurs at about 45 °. A novel analytical model is proposed to evaluate the shear behaviour of pre-tensioned fully grouted <b>cable</b> bolts subjected <b>to</b> double shearing. Energy and Fourier Series methods were incorporated in the model to simulate the shear behaviour of cable bolts. The comparison of the experimental results with the proposed model shows a good agreement...|$|R

40|$|Both the Fred Hartman Bridge and the Veterans Memorial Bridge have {{experienced}} large-amplitude vibrations of the stay cables. A major concern resulting from these vibrations {{is the possibility}} of fatigue damage to the parallel, seven-wire, prestressing strand in the grouted stay cables – and the overall safety of the bridges. An experimental investigation was conducted to determine the susceptibility of grouted stay <b>cables</b> <b>to</b> fatigue damage. Two series of experiments were conducted: twelve stay-cable specimens were subjected <b>to</b> <b>bending</b> fatigue loads in the first series and three small-diameter specimens were subjected <b>to</b> <b>bending</b> fatigue loads in the second series. The test results indicate that fatigue damage is expected to be concentrated in the regions of highest bending stress: the ends of the stays and locations where a damper or restrainer induces local bending in the stay. The risk of fatigue damage was considered to be low at the tension ring, along the free length of the stay, and in the vicinity of unintentionally crossed strands. The acoustic monitoring systems installed on the Fred Hartman Bridge and the Veterans Memorial Bridge provided a reliable means of detecting wire breaks in the laboratory specimens. However, the actua...|$|R
