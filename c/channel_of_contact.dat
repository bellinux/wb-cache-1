A direct interview survey of 417 randomly selected backpackers who visited the inner Rattanakosin Island in Bangkok, Thailand is used. The statistical method used includes frequency, percentage, mean, standard deviation. The results indicated that most backpackers are men, age 20 - 30 years old, work as the employees in private companies, bachelor degree, annual income is more than 10, 000 to 50, 000 US$ and come from Europe. Accommodation service buying behavior includes daily rental expense is more than 10 to 20 US$, spend a week or less, prefer to stay in the reasonable price guesthouse located nearby tourist site, make decision by themselves, make a reservation and get the information from website. The important levels of marketing mix ranking respectively are 1) service personnel factor in having a good manner with the friendly personality, 2) physical evidence factor in having a clean place, 3) accommodation product and service factor in being {{able to go to the}} tourist sites conveniently, 4) <b>channel</b> <b>of</b> <b>contact</b> factor in being able to contact through agency, 5) process factor in having a convenient reservation process, 6) marketing promotion in having been advised in travel guidebook column, and 7) price factor in being suitable to their budgets...|$|E

The NCCCUSA viewed the SVM as primarily an interdenominational recruiting agency to work among students. As {{the organization of the}} National Council of Churches evolved, the SVM became the Missionary Services Department of the Joint Department of Christian Vocation of the Division of Christian Education in 1951.

The {{appearance}} {{of death in}} many cultures is met {{by a series of}} rituals which removes the dead gradually from a community, lessening the social and psychological disruptiveness of death. After burial, the dead are still considered a part of the community by the living, and at the place of burial the living can express their desire to maintain contact with them through artifactual and customary displays.

[...] During the period of early Newfoundland settlement, the living were able to choose the form <b>of</b> <b>contact</b> with the dead at the place of burial.

The location of new cemeteries and the orientation of the grave with respect to the cardinal points of the compass were dictated by the church.

Here live the Miao, Yao, Dong, Yi, Jingpo, Dai and Hani people, as well as cross-border ethnic groups named in a different way in other countries. Their long-term flow, migration, intermarriage and integration create differentiated highland civilizations within the region. Advanced water systems and hydrological conditions favorable for fisheries and irrigated agriculture are another feature of the region’s natural ecology. Rivers of different sizes in the Pearl River Basin link the Nanling Corridor with the South China Sea. Those originating in Southwest China, such as the Lancang, Nujiang and Red Rivers flow through Vietnam, Laos, Myanmar and Thailand in the Indochinese Peninsula and become the mother rivers of different ethnic groups in the region. The South China Sea connects South China, the Indochinese Peninsula and Southeast Asian islands, and various ethnic groups have actively traveled through maritime channels for business, migration and to encourage political contacts. This natural geographical environment, featuring connected mountains, rivers and oceans, provides common space for the survival of diverse ethnic groups in South China and Southeast Asia. The natural features are hereby highlighted in order to better render their relevance to the different populations and civilizations they have created. River civilization is an important bridge between highland civilization and marine civilization. Marine civilization facilitates the extension of highland and river civilizations and serves as an important <b>channel</b> <b>of</b> communication between South China and China and the world (Ma, 2014).|$|R

40|$|TalkInternational audienceRoutine {{clinical}} practice of Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) enters {{a new era}} where battery-related events are challenging. The important number of primary implantations and replacements pushed industrials to develop new generations of devices. We aimed to analyze the battery lifetime {{of different kinds of}} non-rechargeable devices, manufactured by a single company (Medtronic, USA) : the first generation of 4 -contact neurostimulator for one DBS-lead (1 channel; Soletra®) and 8 -contact neurostimulator for two DBS-leads (two <b>channels</b> <b>of</b> 4 contacts; Kinetra®); the second generation of advanced programming neurostimulator (Activa® PC, two <b>channels</b> <b>of</b> 8 <b>contacts,</b> and SC, 1 <b>channel</b> <b>of</b> 8 <b>contacts).</b> We retrospectively reviewed 281 consecutive patients operated on in a single institution (from 1995 to 2016) : 584 surgeries for primary implantation or replacement of neurostimulator (infection and traumatic etiologies of battery replacement were excluded). The battery lifetime was defined as the period between the surgical implantation and the removal at battery depletion. Two hundred and eighty eight battery-lifetimes were analyzed in 157 patients suffering of Parkinson disease (n= 129), essential tremor (n= 19), dystonia (n= 9). Exclusion criteria were: battery related, still operational (n= 217); patient related, died before battery depletion (n= 50); missing follow-up (n= 3); and other diseases treated by DBS (n= 2). Battery lifetime was analyzed using survival methods (univariate, Log-Rank test; multivariate, marginal cox model; two-sided tests) accounting for the following parameters: gender, neurological disease, age at the primary implantation, the UPDRS-score before DBS surgery, the deep brain target, battery model, mean voltage (low 4 V), location of battery (abdominal or sub clavicular) and presence of an adapter for replacement of first generation (Kinetra or Soletra) by second generation model (Activa). Results: The battery lifetime was shorter in male (p= 0. 03) and young (p< 0. 001) patients suffering of essential tremor (p< 0. 001) and dystonia (p< 0. 001). High voltage reduced battery lifetime (p< 0. 001). The second generation device, Activa models, had shorter lifetime than first generation, Soletra and Kinetra (p< 0. 001). Replacement of battery decreased lifetime independently of models (p< 0. 001). Patient and disease characteristics, high voltage, second generation devices and replacement seem to shorten lifetime of battery...|$|R

The increase in local current j is accompanied by the growth of local polarization voltages eta(a) and eta(c) of the anode and the cathode sides, respectively.
