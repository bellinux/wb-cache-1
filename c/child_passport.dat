50|$|A {{certificate}} of entitlement costs £272 when issued in the UK and £472 when issued outside the UK. This is considerably more expensive than obtaining a British passport (£77.50 for a 10-year adult passport, £49 for a 5-year <b>child</b> <b>passport</b> and free for a 10-year passport for those born on or before 2 September 1929 when issued inside the UK; £128 for a 10-year adult passport, £81.50 for a 5-year <b>child</b> <b>passport</b> and free for a 10-year passport for those born on or before 2 September 1929 when issued outside the UK).|$|E
50|$|A <b>child</b> <b>passport</b> has sixteen pages (unlike the regular’s 32), {{of which}} eleven are {{designated}} for stamping {{and the others}} are used for a title page, instructions and personal information. The first page features the words “Child's Passport” in three languages: German, English, and French.|$|E
50|$|A <b>child</b> <b>passport</b> serves {{just like}} any other passport, with the {{exception}} that it is not biometric (or e-Passport). As a result, travelling to the US, for example, requires a tourist visa in spite of Germany’s participation in the United States Visa Waiver Program. Alternatively, infants and children of any age are allowed to obtain a regular German passport (biometric) instead of a child's passport, which nevertheless has the advantages of low cost, short processing times and being issuable by honorary consuls (making them easier to obtain by German emigrants who live far away from a German embassy or consulate). Just like provisional passports, children's passports are issued without being sent to the Bundesdruckerei GmbH in Berlin, which is the main reason behind these advantages.|$|E

They are exposed to a greater variety of cultural influences. For adults who have had this experience as children, another term used is [...] adult third culture kid (ATCK).|$|R
50|$|If a court {{determines that}} a {{credible}} risk exists {{that the child}} will be abducted, it may then enter an order containing provisions and measures meant to prevent abduction. The act lists a number of specific measures that a court may order. These include imposing travel restrictions, prohibiting the individual from removing the child from the State or other set geographic area, placing the child’s name in the United States Department of State’s <b>Child</b> <b>Passport</b> Issuance Alert Program, or requiring the individual to obtain an order from a foreign country containing identical terms to the child-custody determination. An abduction prevention order is effective until the earliest of the order’s expiration, the child’s emancipation, the child’s 18th birthday, or until the order is modified, revoked, or vacated.|$|E
5000|$|A type of {{passport}} {{issued by}} Germany since 2006 is a <b>child</b> <b>passport</b> (in German: Kinderreisepass). Unlike a regular German passport, the Kinderreisepass {{does not include}} biometric features and lacks the inscription [...] "European Union" [...] {{at the top of}} the front cover. The exclusion of biometric information is due to the ongoing development of infants and young children and the low security risk they pose; nevertheless, the photo used in the passport does have to comply with biometric standards. All other features are similar to those of a regular passport: the burgundy red colour and the German coat of arms printed at the centre of the front cover. Children's passports are issued for children up to twelve years of age and are valid for a period of six years. When a child reaches the age of twelve, a regular passport must be obtained for international travel.|$|E
50|$|In the Republic of South Africa {{every citizen}} must apply for an Identity Document {{from the age}} of 16 years. The ID number is already {{allocated}} at the time the birth certificate is generated and required for <b>child</b> <b>passport</b> applications. This passport-size document contains only 8 pages - the first page containing the national identification number (also in barcoded format), name of bearer, district or country of birth, as well as a photograph of the bearer. The other pages are used for recording of voting participation, a page for driver's license information (although it is no longer used since the introduction of plastic card type licenses), as well as pages for fire arms licenses (also plastic card type now). The document is required to apply for a passport, car learner's license (over 17), motorcycle learner's license (over 16), driving license (over 18), motorcycle license (over 16 or 18 depending on cc) and to vote (over 18). The Identity Document is not used for international travel purposes (a separate passport is issued) but usually is acceptable photographic identification for internal flights, and mainly serves as proof of identification. Some authorities may accept the driver's license as proof of identity, but the Identity Document is the only universally accepted form of identification. The government has started issuing ID cards which contains a biometric chip which, in turn, holds biographical information which is unique to the holder of that specific card. The South African government wishes to phase out the old Green Barcoded ID book and replace it with the Identity Card. The Identity number is also used when the holder applies for a grant from the South African Social Security Agency (SASSA).|$|E

It {{is important to note that}} in Israel there is no separation of religion and state. If the mother is not Jewish by Orthodox standards then the child can not be registered as Jewish, nor can the child be married to a Jewish person inside of Israel without first undergoing an Orthodox conversion to Judaism. By the same token, a child born to a mother considered Jewish by Orthodox standards is automatically also registered as Jewish.|$|R

40|$|The Queensland Commission for Children and Young People and Child Guardian (the Commission) has {{released}} findings {{on health and}} wellbeing from its fourth biennial Views survey of {{children and young people}} living in foster care in Queensland. More than 2000 children and young people responded bringing the total number of surveys completed since 2006 to more than 13, 000. The surveys generate a rich source of cross-sectional longitudinal data on children’s and young people’s placement histories, perceptions of their health, wellbeing and school experiences, as well as  their views on many aspects of their care experience including their current placement and carer, support from the department, involvement in decision making, and preparation for leaving care. Analyses reveal that most respondents continue to report being better off since coming into care, with nearly all reporting they feel happy, safe, and well treated in their placement. Many children and young people emphasised how important their foster family is to them and specifically commented that they feel cared for, and loved by their foster family. Data also confirm steady improvements over the years in some aspects of the health and wellbeing of children and young people in foster care such as decreases in reports of unresolved health problems and increases in reports of having <b>Child</b> health <b>passports,</b> in having confidence in the Department of Child Safety, Communities and Disability Services and finding their Child Safety Officers more helpful.   However, the survey findings also highlight ongoing challenges for the child protection system in meeting the health and wellbeing needs of children and young people in care. Children and young people report high rates of anxiety, and many continue to experience considerable instability in their lives. Also some do not see their Child Safety Officer as often as they would like, feel excluded from decisions and still face problems in obtaining permissions for various activities.   The Commission’s report also identifies that children and young people in foster care have better outcomes when they have more stability in their lives and better quality relationships with their carers, peers, teachers and Child Safety Officers. Their wellbeing is also better when they are able to get help with their concerns, are involved in making decisions, can obtain permissions easily and are given opportunities to engage in activities enjoyed by their peers. The research shows that deficits in these areas do have a detrimental impact on the lives of children and young people in care.   This research is being used to inform policy and practice among stakeholders in the Queensland child protection system. The research also demonstrates to individual children and young people that they have an important voice in shaping the future directions and priorities within these systems.   The Views of Children and Young People in Foster Care Survey: Health and Wellbeing is available from the Commission’s website at [URL]   Further reports from the survey findings will be released in the coming months...|$|R
