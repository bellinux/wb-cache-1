40|$|One of {{the primary}} tasks of the mobile system {{designers}} {{in order to support}} high density of devices in a CDMA system is to create a <b>code</b> <b>sequence</b> with a capacity for large number of spreading <b>code</b> <b>sequences</b> having low cross-correlation values between them, in order to ensure accommodation of large number of users and to minimise the effect of multiple access interference. In this research, the design for a novel hybrid orthogonal very large set (HOVLS) <b>code</b> <b>sequence</b> is proposed for high density mobile application scenarios. The design and development of both fixed and variable spreading factor <b>code</b> <b>sequences</b> are presented in this thesis. Both type of <b>code</b> <b>sequences</b> have been implemented via simulation using Matlab/Simulink. The performance of the <b>code</b> <b>sequences</b> has been evaluated and compared with that of existing <b>code</b> <b>sequences.</b> The proposed <b>code</b> <b>sequences</b> are more advantageous for high density mobile networks. The unique feature of the fixed length HOVLS <b>code</b> <b>sequence</b> is that its ACF, CCF, and BER performances are similar to that of orthogonal Gold <b>code</b> <b>sequence</b> and orthogonal m-sequence under Rayleigh flat and frequency selective fading channel conditions while having a significantly higher capacity than those orthogonal <b>code</b> <b>sequences.</b> The proposed HOVLS <b>code</b> <b>sequence</b> could support 134 different cells which is more than twice than that of orthogonal Gold <b>code</b> <b>sequence</b> and orthogonal m-sequence. To the knowledge of the author, this is the largest reported family size in the literature for an orthogonal <b>code</b> <b>sequence</b> for CDMA applications. In order to support variable data rate, fixed length HOVLS <b>code</b> <b>sequence</b> was developed into orthogonal variable spreading factor <b>code</b> <b>sequence.</b> It is shown that the proposed OVSF <b>code</b> <b>sequence</b> has slightly better CCF than those of OVSF Gold <b>code</b> <b>sequence</b> and m-sequence in terms of CM (correlation margin). The ACF of the proposed OVSF <b>code</b> <b>sequence</b> is similar to those of OVSF Gold <b>code</b> <b>sequence</b> and m-sequence. The proposed OVSF <b>code</b> <b>sequence</b> possesses comparable BER performance to those of orthogonal Gold <b>code</b> <b>sequence</b> and orthogonal m-sequence under flat fading channel condition. Whereas, the BER performance of the proposed OVSF <b>code</b> <b>sequence</b> is slightly better than that of Gold <b>code</b> <b>sequence</b> and OVSF m-sequence under frequency selective fading channel. Therefore, the proposed HOVLS <b>code</b> <b>sequence</b> is appropriate <b>code</b> <b>sequence</b> in CDMA systems than those of orthogonal Gold <b>code</b> <b>sequence</b> and orthogonal m-sequence for both fixed and variable rate high density network applications...|$|R

Only O-glycosylation sites are found on glycoprotein B and these are linked via serine or threonine. Residues 80-100 of glycophorin A and 51-71 of glycophorin B are very similar. The intervening residues in contrast differ significantly. The antigenic determinant for the blood group Ss is located at residue 29 where S has a methionine and s a threonine.

On the other hand, most available exopeptidases can only remove the His-tag from the N-terminus; removing the tag from the C-terminus will require the use of other techniques. It is important to take into account that the computer simulation (by molecular dynamic) will help you to choose between options, for example, whether the His-tag must be digested or engineered to the N- or C-terminal.|$|E

40|$|As {{described}} in previous articles [1 - 5], code drafting traditionally {{is done in}} overshot.

The mechanism of code drafting simply translates a string of characters into a sequence of shaft numbers â the <b>code</b> <b>sequence</b> corresponding to the string. Any commemorative significance of the string is captured in the <b>code</b> <b>sequence.</b> This sequence {{can be used as a}} threading and treadling sequence in a variety of ways while still capturing the message of the string. While overshot tends to produce attractive patterns, there are other methods that do also. One is point twill. The key idea of code drafting for point twill is to interpret the <b>code</b> <b>sequence</b> as values connecting straight-draw segments of a threading sequence. For example, the <b>code</b> <b>sequence</b> 1, 6, 2, 5 becomes the threading sequence 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 3, 4, 5 where the code-sequence values are underlined. A grid plot illustrates the point-twill threading: If the <b>code</b> <b>sequence</b> has successive values in increasing or decreasing order, they are âabsorbed â in the point-twill threading; it is successive high and low values (inflection points) that count. For example, the <b>code</b> <b>sequence</b> 1, 3, 6, 5, 4, 2, 3, 4, 5 produces the same point-twill sequence as the previous example...|$|R

25|$|Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) do {{not occur}} {{homogeneously}} across the human genome. In fact, there is enormous diversity in SNP frequency between genes, reflecting different selective pressures on each gene as well as different mutation and recombination rates across the genome. However, studies on SNPs are biased towards coding regions, the data generated from them are unlikely to reflect the overall distribution of SNPs throughout the genome. Therefore, the SNP Consortium protocol was designed to identify SNPs with no bias towards coding regions and the Consortium's 100,000 SNPs generally reflect sequence diversity across the human chromosomes.The SNP Consortium aims to expand the number of SNPs identified across the genome to 300 000 {{by the end of}} the first quarter of 2001. Changes in non-coding sequence and synonymous changes in <b>coding</b> <b>sequence</b> are generally more common than non-synonymous changes, reflecting greater selective pressure reducing diversity at positions dictating amino acid identity. Transitional changes are more common than transversions, with CpG dinucleotides showing the highest mutation rate, presumably due to deamination.|$|E
25|$|S. cerevisiae was {{the first}} {{eukaryotic}} genome to be completely sequenced. The genome sequence was {{released to the public}} domain on April 24, 1996. Since then, regular updates have been maintained at the Saccharomyces Genome Database. This database is a highly annotated and cross-referenced database for yeast researchers. Another important S.cerevisiae database is maintained by the Munich Information Center for Protein Sequences (MIPS). The S. cerevisiae genome is composed of about 12,156,677 base pairs and 6,275 genes, compactly organized on 16 chromosomes. Only about 5,800 of these genes are believed to be functional. It is estimated at least 31% of yeast genes have homologs in the human genome. Yeast genes are classified using gene symbols (such as sch9) or systematic names. In the latter case the 16 chromosomes of yeast are represented by the letters A to P, then the gene is further classified by a sequence number on the left or right arm of the chromosome, and a letter showing which of the two DNA strands contains its <b>coding</b> <b>sequence.</b>|$|E
25|$|There is {{a diverse}} {{classification}} scheme {{for the various}} genomic changes that {{may contribute to the}} generation of cancer cells. Many of these changes are mutations, or changes in the nucleotide sequence of genomic DNA. There are also many epigenetic changes that alter whether genes are expressed or not expressed. Aneuploidy, the presence of an abnormal number of chromosomes, is one genomic change that is not a mutation, and may involve either gain or loss of one or more chromosomes through errors in mitosis. Large-scale mutations involve the deletion or gain of a portion of a chromosome. Genomic amplification occurs when a cell gains many copies (often 20 or more) of a small chromosomal region, usually containing one or more oncogenes and adjacent genetic material. Translocation occurs when two separate chromosomal regions become abnormally fused, often at a characteristic location. A well-known example of this is the Philadelphia chromosome, or translocation of chromosomes 9 and 22, which occurs in chronic myelogenous leukemia, and results in production of the BCR-abl fusion protein, an oncogenic tyrosine kinase. Small-scale mutations include point mutations, deletions, and insertions, which may occur in the promoter of a gene and affect its expression, or may occur in the gene's <b>coding</b> <b>sequence</b> and alter the function or stability of its protein product. Disruption of a single gene may also result from integration of genomic material from a DNA virus or retrovirus, and such an event may also result in the expression of viral oncogenes in the affected cell and its descendants.|$|E
