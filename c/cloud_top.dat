5|$|The {{depression}} slid slowly northwestward {{between the}} contiguous upper vortex {{and a large}} high-pressure region over the central Atlantic. A region of lighter wind shear ahead, {{as well as an}} anticipated weakening of the upper cyclone, prompted the NHC to introduce the possibility of a tropical transition. Later, satellite observations showed a rapid improvement in the depression's structure; convective banding wrapped completely around the broad inner wind field, which produced gusts to 65mph (105km/h). Accordingly, the NHC upgraded the depression to Subtropical Storm Otto at 21:00UTC on October6, about 215mi (345km) northeast of Grand Turk. Although satellite images continued to display a classical subtropical cyclone, with Otto's center and the vortex aloft nearly collocated, data from a Hurricane Hunters aircraft indicated a weak warm convective core was developing within the mid levels of the circulation—a feature normally present at the upper levels of tropical cyclones. Moreover, a contraction of the large wind field reaffirmed that Otto was entering the final stages of its tropical transition. Although convective activity briefly weakened overnight, weakening shear and considerably warmer sea surface temperatures permitted small patches of thunderstorms to refire on the morning of October7. As Otto meandered northward, temperature contrasts from forecast models indicated that the warm core within the circulation had ascended to the upper levels of the cyclone. In consequence, a burst of deep, tropical convection with extreme <b>cloud</b> <b>top</b> temperatures of approximately 112°F (80°C) occurred over the center. Having shed the last of its subtropical characteristics, Otto became a warm-core system and was operationally declared tropical at 1200UTC that day.|$|E

The cloud system extended from the northeast to southwest (35 °N- 50 °N) along the eastward-moving trough and passed over Shigaraki in the nighttime between 5 – 6 November 2004. Cloud-top altitude observed by the lidar was located at ∼ 10.6 km around 1900 LST 5 November, then gradually descended to ∼ 8.4 km around 0500 LST 6 November. The westerly wind observed by MUR with 12 -min and 150 -m resolutions showed a rapid increase with altitude around the <b>cloud</b> <b>tops</b> and was almost always larger than 25 m s− 1 above ∼ 1 km higher than the <b>cloud</b> <b>tops.</b> Objective reanalysis showed that a subtropical jet whose core existed to the south of Shigaraki caused a synoptic-scale vertical increase in the westerly wind around the <b>cloud</b> <b>tops.</b> Radiosondes observed a significant vertical increase of potential temperature (greater than 4 K within several hundred meters) around the <b>cloud</b> <b>tops.</b> MUR successfully observed fine time and altitude variations of winds which showed a good correspondence with the descending <b>cloud</b> <b>tops.</b>|$|R

25|$|Japan's {{planetary}} missions have so {{far been}} limited to the inner Solar System, and emphasis {{has been put on}} magnetospheric and atmospheric research. The Mars explorer Nozomi (PLANET-B), which ISAS launched prior to the merger of the three aerospace institutes, became one of the earliest difficulties the newly formed JAXA faced. Nozomi ultimately passed 1,000km from the surface of Mars. On 20 May 2010, the Venus Climate Orbiter Akatsuki (PLANET-C) and IKAROS solar sail demonstrator was launched by a H-2A launch vehicle. On 7 December 2010, Akatsuki was unable to complete its Venus orbit insertion maneuver. Akatsuki finally entered Venus orbit in 7 December 2015, making it the first Japanese spacecraft to orbit another planet, sixteen years after the originally planned orbital insertion of Nozomi. One of Akatsuki's main goal is to uncover the mechanism behind Venus atmosphere's super-rotation, a phenomenon in which the <b>cloud</b> <b>top</b> winds in the toposphere circulates around the planet faster than the speed that Venus itself rotates. A thorough explanation for this phenomenon has yet been found.|$|E
500|$|The RMW is {{traditionally}} measured by reconnaissance {{aircraft in the}} Atlantic basin.

[...] Using weather satellite data, the distance between the coldest <b>cloud</b> <b>top</b> temperature and the warmest temperatature within the eye, in infrared satellite imagery, is one method of determining RMW. [...] The reason why this method has merit is that the strongest winds within tropical cyclones tend to be located under the deepest convection, which is seen on satellite imagery as the coldest cloud tops.

40|$|NASA {{operates}} two Global Hawk {{unmanned aircraft}} systems for Earth Science research projects. In particular, {{they are used}} in the Hurricane and Severe Storm Sentinel (HS 3) project during 2012, 2013, and 2014 to take measurements from the environment around tropical cyclones, and from directly above tropical cyclones. There is concern that strict adherence to the weather avoidance rules used in 2012 may sacrifice the ability to observe important science targets. We have proposed modifications to these weather avoidance rules that we believe will improve the ability to observe science targets without compromising aircraft safety. The previous guidelines, used in 2012, specified: Do not approach thunderstorms within 25 nm during flight at FL 500 or below. When flying above FL 500 : Do not approach reported lightning within 25 NM in areas where <b>cloud</b> <b>tops</b> are reported at FL 500 or higher. Aircraft should maintain at least 10000 ft vertical separation from reported lightning if <b>cloud</b> <b>tops</b> are below FL 500. No over-flight of cumulus tops higher than FL 500. No flight into forecast or reported icing conditions. No flight into forecast or reported moderate or severe turbulence Based on past experience with high-altitude flights over tropical cyclones, we have recommended changing this guidance to: Do not approach thunderstorms within 25 nm during flight at FL 500 or below. Aircraft should maintain at least 5000 ft vertical separation from significant convective <b>cloud</b> <b>tops</b> except: a) When <b>cloud</b> <b>tops</b> above FL 500 : In the event of reported significant lightning activity or indicators of significant overshooting tops, do not approach within 10 - 25 nm, depending on pilot discretion and advice from Mission Scientist. b) When <b>cloud</b> <b>tops</b> are below FL 500, maintain 10000 ft separation from reported significant lightning or indicators of significant overshooting tops. No flight into forecasted or reported icing conditions. No flight into forecasted or reported moderate or severe turbulence The key changes have to do with overflight of high convective <b>cloud</b> <b>tops</b> and those producing lightning. Experience shows that most tropical oceanic convection (including that in tropical cyclones) is relatively gentle even if the <b>cloud</b> <b>tops</b> are quite high, and can be safely overflown. Exceptions are convective elements producing elevated lightning flash rates (more than just the occasional flash, which would trigger avoidance under the previous rules) and significant overshooting <b>cloud</b> <b>tops...</b>|$|R

Around 1800UTC, the JTWC estimated that the system intensified into a Category1 equivalent cyclone on the Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale. Early on October22, Giri further strengthened into a very severe cyclonic storm as it slowly moved towards the central coast of Myanmar. Throughout the day, the storm underwent explosive deepening, attaining winds of 240km/h (145mph 1-minute sustained) by 0900UTC.

[...] In most tropical cyclone basins, use of the satellite-based Dvorak technique is the primary method used to determine a tropical cyclone's maximum sustained winds. [...] The extent of banding and difference in temperature between the eye and eyewall is used within the technique to assign a maximum sustained wind and pressure.

500|$|As human analysts {{using the}} {{technique}} lead to subjective biases, {{efforts have been}} made to make more objective estimates using computer programs, which have been aided by higher-resolution satellite imagery and more powerful computers. [...] Since tropical cyclone satellite patterns can fluctuate over time, automated techniques use a six-hour averaging period to lead to more reliable intensity estimates. [...] Development of the objective Dvorak technique began in 1998, which performed best with tropical cyclones that had eyes (of hurricane or typhoon strength). [...] It still required a manual center placement, keeping some subjectivity within the process. [...] By 2004, an advanced objective Dvorak technique was developed which utilized banding features for systems below hurricane intensity and to objectively determine the tropical cyclone's center. [...] A central pressure bias was uncovered in 2004 relating to the slope of the tropopause and <b>cloud</b> <b>top</b> temperatures which change with latitude that helped improve central pressure estimates within the objective technique.|$|E
500|$|The initial {{development}} of this technique occurred in 1969 by Vernon Dvorak, using satellite pictures of tropical cyclones within the northwest Pacific Ocean. [...] The system as it was initially conceived involved pattern matching of cloud features with a development and decay model. [...] As the technique matured through the 1970s and 1980s, measurement of cloud features became dominant in defining tropical cyclone intensity and central pressure of the tropical cyclone's low-pressure area. [...] Use of infrared satellite imagery led to a more objective assessment {{of the strength of}} tropical cyclones with eyes, using the <b>cloud</b> <b>top</b> temperatures within the eyewall and contrasting them with the warm temperatures within the eye itself. [...] Constraints on short term intensity change are used less frequently than they were back in the 1970s and 1980s. [...] The central pressures assigned to tropical cyclones have required modification, as the original estimates were 5–10hPa (0.15–0.29inHg) too low in the Atlantic and up to 20hPa (0.59inHg) too high in the northwest Pacific. [...] This led to the {{development of}} a separate wind-pressure relationship for the northwest Pacific, devised by Atkinson and Holliday in 1975, then modified in 1977.|$|E

This means that, at the scarcely absorbed continuum of wavelengths (8 to 14 µm), the radiation emitted, by the earth's surface into a dry atmosphere, and by the <b>cloud</b> <b>tops,</b> mostly passes unabsorbed through the atmosphere, and is emitted directly to space; there is also partial window transmission in far infrared spectral lines between about 16 and 28 µm. Clouds are excellent emitters of infrared radiation. Window radiation from <b>cloud</b> <b>tops</b> arises at altitudes where the air temperature is low, but as seen from those altitudes, the water vapor content of the air above is much {{lower than that of}} the air at the land-sea surface. Moreover, the water vapour continuum absorptivity, molecule for molecule, decreases with pressure decrease. Thus water vapour above the clouds, besides being less concentrated, is also less absorptive than water vapour at lower altitudes. Consequently, the effective window as seen from the cloud-top altitudes is more open, with the result that the <b>cloud</b> <b>tops</b> are effectively strong sources of window radiation; that is to say, in effect the clouds obstruct the window only to a small degree (see another opinion about this, proposed by Ahrens (2009) on page 43).|$|R
