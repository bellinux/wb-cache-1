30|$|When {{sudden load}} or {{generation}} changes happen in microgrids, dynamic balancing strategy regulates setpoints of generators or <b>controllable</b> <b>loads</b> {{to reduce the}} mismatch during the transient state. This mitigates frequency and voltage oscillations in the system.

40|$|Abstract — From {{depletion}} of energy resources and consider-ation to natural environment, introduction {{of renewable energy}} facilities has been increasing annually. Moreover, introduction of photovoltaics has increased on the demand side. However, due to the fluctuating power from renewable energy sources, frequency and voltage fluctuations of power systems become problematic. At the same time, {{there has been a}} marked increase in the electrification of residential houses, as well as electric vehicles. Thus, capability for energy control has been increasing, with the load utilized as <b>controllable</b> <b>load.</b> This paper presents a methodology for grid frequency and voltage control by distributed controllable loads. The power system consists of diesel generators, wind generators, photovoltaics and loads. By applying power consumption control under droop characteristics, grid frequency and terminal voltage fluctuations are maintained around rated value.

40|$|Due to {{increasing}} uncertainties resulting from renewable energy penetration and variability in both supply and demand, {{the control and}} economic optimization for power networks will need to run on faster time-scales. Moreover, distributed and decentralized control architectures are necessary as power systems are distributed large-scale networks {{with a lot of}} complexity, which makes centralized control expensive, inefficient and hard to implement. In this paper, the problem of real-time active and reactive power regulation for power networks with <b>controllable</b> <b>loads</b> and tap-changing transformers is considered. First, the state-space model of a transmission level network under exogenous disturbances is obtained, which is decomposed into two subsystems, describing frequency and voltage dynamics respectively. For the subsystem describing frequency dynamics, an optimization problem relating to active power regulation is first formulated. A distributed controller is then proposed and its optimality, stability and delay robustness are studied. Also, nonlinear proportional actions for <b>controllable</b> <b>loads</b> are introduced to improve the performance of the subsystem. For the subsystem describing voltage dynamics, simple integral control is used for <b>controllable</b> <b>loads</b> and the asymptotic stability of the closed-loop subsystem is shown. To implement the reactive power regulation scheme, a method for local users to detect the tap position variation of the On-Load Tap Changer (OLTC) at the bus they are connected to is presented. Thus, the overall load control scheme is completely decentralized and can be applied easily. Numerical investigations illustrate the performance of the combined active and reactive power regulation scheme...|$|R

A control scheme is proposed for sub-transmission networks by coordinating electric spring (ES) aggregators which consist of ESs and <b>controllable</b> <b>loads</b> to implement frequency and voltage control simultaneously by adopting d-q transformation. On one hand, decentralized PI control is adopted for voltage regulation by adjusting the q component of the ES voltage. On the other hand, the d component of the ES voltage is adjusted to guarantee expected active power consumption of the ES aggregator. Simulation results show that the proposed control method can achieve expected active power compensation accurately and meanwhile maintain bus voltages within the acceptable range...|$|R
30|$|The {{main purpose}} of this {{research}} paper is to investigate {{the long-term effects of}} the proposed demand-side program, and its impact on annual peak load forecasting important for strategic network planning. The program comprises a particular set of demand-side measures aimed at reducing the annual peak load. The paper also presents the program simulations for the case study of the Electricity Distribution Company of Belgrade (EDB). According to the methodology used, {{the first step is to}} determine the available <b>controllable</b> <b>load</b> of the distribution utility/area under consideration. The <b>controllable</b> <b>load</b> is presumed constant over the analyzed time horizon, and the smart grid (SG) infrastructure available. The saturation of positive effects during intense program application is also taken into account. Technical and economic input data are taken from the real projects. The conducted calculations indicate that demand-side programs can bring about the same results as the energy storage in the grids with a strong impact of distributed generation from variable renewable sources (V-RES). In conclusion, the proposed demand-side program is a good alternative to building new power facilities, which can postpone investment costs for a considerable period of time.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a bi-level aggregator-utility optimization model to schedule an energy consumption pattern of <b>controllable</b> <b>loads</b> {{in a power}} system with a high penetration of renewables.

The utility's problem is a market-clearing model which provides a spot price to the aggregator's problem. We derive the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) optimality conditions of the lower-level utility's problem as the equilibrium constraint in the upper-level aggregator's problem. Therefore, the bi-level formulation is converted into a form of mathematical program with equilibrium constraints (MPECs) which can be solved analytically.
