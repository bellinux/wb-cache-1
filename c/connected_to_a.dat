5|$|Chest {{tubes are}} {{required}} in PSPs {{that have not}} responded to needle aspiration, in large SSPs (>50%), and in cases of tension pneumothorax. They are <b>connected</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> one-way valve system that allows air to escape, but not to re-enter, the chest. This may include a bottle with water that functions like a water seal, or a Heimlich valve. They are not normally <b>connected</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> negative pressure circuit, as this would result in rapid re-expansion of the lung and a risk of pulmonary edema ("re-expansion pulmonary edema"). The tube is left in place until no air is seen to escape from it {{for a period of}} time, and X-rays confirm re-expansion of the lung.|$|E

5|$|A {{waterspout}} is a columnar vortex forming {{over water}} that is, {{in its most}} common form, a non-supercell tornado over water that is <b>connected</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> cumuliform cloud.

5000|$|Games {{are written}} to the {{cartridge}} with a device called [...] "linker". Depending on the brand of flash cartridge, the linker either <b>connects</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> link port on the console and writes to the cartridge through the console, or <b>connects</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> mini-USB slot on the cartridge itself and writes directly to the flash cartridge. These linkers usually <b>connect</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> PC through a USB or parallel plug on the other end. Most linkers that <b>connect</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> link slot are capable of copying ROM information from commercial software cartridges. Some more recent flash cartridges use digital media cards (SD,MMC,CF, etc.) in which files are placed via a memory card reader.|$|R

5|$|A {{waterspout}} is {{an intense}} columnar vortex (usually appearing as a funnel-shaped cloud) that occurs over {{a body of}} water.

Pipe water is provided for 98% of the households primarily through a public network (97.5%), but some residents receive water through a private system (1.5%).

5|$|Chester {{station is}} served by the Bloor-Danforth line which {{operates}} between Kennedy and Kipling stations.

As it is the only station in the system that is not <b>connected</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> regular bus or streetcar route {{it is one of the}} least used subway stations in Toronto.

As many as 30,000 locomotives were hauled {{through the streets of}} Glasgow by Clydesdale horses, traction engines and diesel tractors, from the works at Springburn to the crane for export to the British Empire. The crane is (as of 1988) not in working order, but is retained {{as a symbol of the}} city's engineering heritage.|$|E
5|$|Dutch {{explorer}} Abel Tasman sighted New Zealand in 1642 {{and called}} it Staten Landt, supposing it was <b>connected</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> landmass {{of the same name}} at the southern tip of South America.

5|$|In 1913, the IRT, the Brooklyn Rapid Transit, and {{the city}} agreed to the Dual System of Rapid Transit to exp{{and the city}}'s transportation. As part of the agreement, the {{existing}} IRT subway would be split into two north-south lines and a shuttle along 42nd Street. The section of the line south of 42nd Street would be <b>connected</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> newly constructed line stretching from 41st Street and Park Avenue to the Bronx, running via Lexington Avenue, while {{the section of the}} line north of 42nd Street would be <b>connected</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> newly constructed line heading south under Seventh Avenue. The section along 42nd Street was left as a shuttle to connect the new East Side and West Side Lines.|$|E

5|$|In August 2010, Russian {{authorities}} arrested nine individuals <b>connected</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> ransomware Trojan {{known as}} WinLock. Unlike the previous Gpcode Trojan, WinLock {{did not use}} encryption. Instead, WinLock trivially restricted access to the system by displaying pornographic images, and asked users to send a premium-rate SMS (costing around US$10) to receive a code {{that could be used}} to unlock their machines. The scam hit numerous users across Russia and neighboring countries—reportedly earning the group over US$16 million.|$|E
5|$|In the {{fountain}} effect, a chamber is constructed which is <b>connected</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> reservoir of heliumII by a sintered disc through which superfluid helium leaks easily but through which non-superfluid helium cannot pass. If {{the interior of}} the container is heated, the superfluid helium changes to non-superfluid helium. In order to maintain the equilibrium fraction of superfluid helium, superfluid helium leaks through and increases the pressure, causing liquid to fountain out of the container.|$|E

The museum itself was built into the mountain, with 80percent of the building underground.|$|E
