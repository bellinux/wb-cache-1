40|$|The {{improvement}} of the primary energy structure has been considered {{as one of the}} important measures to achieve the <b>carbon</b> <b>emissions</b> <b>reduction</b> targets in China. This current paper constructed a Markov chain model, which was used to forecast the transition of primary energy structure. GM (1, 1) model and a linear regression model were used to predict the total energy consumption in 2020 and 2030. Then, the CO 2 emissions intensity was calculated, and the realization of <b>carbon</b> <b>emissions</b> <b>reduction</b> targets in China was analyzed. The findings indicated that (1) China’s nonfossil energy share in primary energy cannot be achieved naturally. (2) Part of the <b>carbon</b> <b>emissions</b> intensity in China’s commitments was not binding actually. (3) The realization of the <b>carbon</b> <b>emissions</b> peak and the <b>reduction</b> target of <b>carbon</b> <b>emissions</b> intensity in 2030 would need the policy intervention.

40|$|This paper {{evaluates the}} {{distributional}} implications of alternative permit allocations in a tradeable permit regime for <b>carbon</b> <b>emissions</b> <b>reductions</b> (20 % below baseline) in 2010 for a region consisting of Europe {{and the states}} of the former Soviet Union (FSU). Participation in such a regime is expected to hinge on the “fairness” of the distributional consequences. We find that initial permit allocations by populationand/or GDP are unlikely to induce participation by most countries of Eastern Europe and FSU because of the net costs involved. We identify a set of initial allocations that would at least compensate these countries. A fair treatment of the countries in Western Europe (WE) is here one which equalizes net costs perGDP. For a wide set of cost functions for <b>carbon</b> <b>emission</b> <b>reductions,</b> the cost gains that WE would reap from a tradeable permit system relative to unilateral reductions by WE as a group are found to be on the order of 85 percent. This would imply, among other things, a significant increase in WE'scapacity to make further <b>emissions</b> <b>reductions.</b> Copyright Kluwer Academic Publishers 1994 <b>Carbon</b> <b>emissions</b> <b>reductions,</b> tradeable permits, equity,...|$|R

40|$|Urban rail {{is widely}} {{considered}} to be a form of low-carbon green transportation, but {{there is a lack of}} specific quantitative research to support this. By comparing the mode, distance, and corresponding energy consumption of residents before and after the opening of rail transit, this paper establishes a carbon reduction method for rail transit. A measurement model takes the passenger <b>carbon</b> <b>emissions</b> before the line is opened as the baseline and compares them with the standard after the opening, determining the <b>carbon</b> <b>emissions</b> <b>reduction.</b> The model requires a combination of a large amount of research data, transit smart card data, and GIS network measurement tools as measured data and parameters. The model is then applied to rail transit lines that have opened in Beijing in recent years.

40|$|This paper {{employs the}} {{quadratic}} directional output distance function to derive shadow prices of China’s aggregate <b>carbon</b> <b>emissions</b> at the province level between 1997 and 2010. The empirical {{results indicate that}} the national weighted average shadow price presents an “N-shape” curve across the sample period, experiencing the initial phase of growth followed by a phase of deterioration, and then a further increase. This change trend implies that the cost of <b>carbon</b> <b>emissions</b> <b>reduction</b> is increasing. In addition, the shadow price varies significantly across provinces, which means that China should uphold the principal of “common but differentiated responsibilities” in regional <b>carbon</b> <b>emissions</b> <b>reduction.</b> Generally, the shadow price of the east provinces with high economic development is markedly higher than that of the west provinces with low economic development. The OLS regression {{results indicate that the}} shadow price positively connected with the regional economic development levels. Moreover, an inflection point exists in the relation curve between the shadow price and GDP per capita, that is, the increase rate of the shadow price becomes small when the GDP per capita is less than 18. 1 thousand Yuan, while it becomes large when the GDP per capita surpasses 18. 1 thousand Yuan. With the economic growth, the cost of <b>carbon</b> <b>emissions</b> <b>reduction</b> would be significantly increased. The empirical results can provide more insight for policymakers...|$|R
