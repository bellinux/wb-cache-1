To a lesser extent they also hunt or trap two to three species of lemur, feral cats, occasional wild boars, turtles and rodents using blowguns, spears and dogs, and use a hook and line to catch fish in saline inland lakes. Some Mikea raise animals for food or sale at market, including goats, <b>chickens</b> <b>and</b> guinea fowl; tree nuts also provide additional protein.|$|E

5|$|A few Macroolithus eggs {{preserve}} embryonic {{remains of}} oviraptorids inside. Two eggs containing embryos {{found in the}} Upper Cretaceous Nanxiong Formation near Ganzhou, Jiangxi were referred to M. yaotunensis in 2008. One of these embryos shows a much greater degree of bone development (ossification) than the other; it preserves ossified hind limbs and several vertebrae. The fact that the cervical vertebrae not only have ossified centra and neural arches, but also have ossified zygapophyses, led Cheng et al. to conclude that this embryo may in fact represent a hatchling, since in modern <b>chickens</b> <b>and</b> skuas these zygaphyses are cartilaginous until hatching. Also, the embryo's foot anatomy (specifically, the proportions of its metatarsals) resembles that of the oviraptorid Heyuannia huangi, indicating that these eggs belong to H. huangi or a similar species. The other egg has a much less developed embryo, with only the hind limbs preserved. While this does not permit comparison on the species level, the tibia (shinbone) confirms {{that it is an}} oviraptorosaur.|$|E
5|$|A foot pursuit {{in which}} Diesel, Brewster and Walker are chased across favela rooftops by Johnson {{and his team}} was filmed {{over the course of}} a week in the small {{hillside}} town of Naranjito, Puerto Rico. The scene was considered difficult to shoot, as pathways were slippery from moist tropical heat and the scene involved actors and stunt doubles running while avoiding dogs, <b>chickens</b> <b>and</b> other stray animals loose in the area. To capture the scene, a 420-foot cable-camera rig was used to allow for a fast moving, birds-eye view of the action, and cameras on cranes were set up on rooftops and in alleyways. Walker and Brewster made multiple takes of the conclusion of the scene, requiring them to jump nearly 30 feet from a building onto a waiting safety mat. In total the production employed 236 technicians, 13,145 extras, and generated 16,824 room nights at hotels, contributing $27 million to the Puerto Rican community.|$|E
5|$|At night, a carnivorous, shape-shifting alien named Kator {{lands in}} the woods of rural England. The vanguard of an {{invasion}} force, his mission is to evaluate the suitability of humans {{as a source of}} food for his species. Stumbling across Anderson and Sandy, a couple having a tryst in their parked car, he kills both and assumes the appearance of Anderson. The next morning, he encounters Jessica-Ann and Josephine, a lesbian couple who live in a nearby manor house. Although Jessica owns the property, having inherited it from her Canadian parents, the dominant of the pair is Jo, who is unusually possessive of Jessica and deeply suspicious of men.

5|$|Cooper grew rapidly {{after being}} established, with {{a post office}} built in the {{community}} in 1871. Cooper was incorporated into a town in 1881 and held its first government elections. That same year, Cooper constructed the county courthouse. The town became the main market center for Delta County, and by 1885, Cooper had a population around 300. The Texas Midland Railroad, which ran through Cooper, was chartered in 1892. The railroad helped promote {{the rapid growth of}} the town. By 1896, Cooper's population had passed 1,000 people, and contained two churches, a school, and 21 businesses, including a bank and a hotel. The town also had two weekly newspapers. Cooper continued to grow into the early 1900s, especially in the area of agriculture. From the early 1890s to around 1910, farms boomed both in number and in value, with the number of cash crops nearly tripling. The region produced over 70,000 <b>chickens</b> <b>and</b> almost 7,000 pigs yearly.|$|E
5|$|Khmer Loeu diets in Ratanakiri {{are largely}} {{dictated}} by the food that is available for harvesting or gathering. Numerous food taboos also limit food choice, particularly among pregnant women, children, and the sick. The primary staple grain is rice, though most families experience rice shortages during the six months before harvest time. Some families have begun to plant maize to alleviate this problem; other sources of grain include potatoes, cassava, and taro. Most Khmer Loeu diets are low in protein, which is limited in availability. Wild game and fish are major protein sources, and smaller animals such as rats, wild <b>chickens,</b> <b>and</b> insects are also sometimes eaten. Domestic animals such as pigs, cows, and buffaloes are only eaten when sacrifices are made. In the rainy season, many varieties of vegetables and leaves are gathered from the forest. (Vegetables are generally not cultivated.) Commonly eaten fruits include bananas, jackfruit, papayas, and mangoes.|$|E
5|$|One {{high-profile}} {{case that}} illustrated Bradley's opposition to racial violence {{was that of}} ex-slave George Dinning.

On January 27, 1897, a mob of 25armed white men came to Dinning's farm, accused him of stealing hogs and <b>chickens,</b> <b>and</b> demanded he leave the county within 10days. Dinning denied being a thief and insisted several people in the county would vouch for his good character. The mob, enraged by Dinning's resistance, began firing on his house and wounded him twice. Dinning retrieved a gun from his house and fired into the mob, killing one man. The mob fled, and the next day, Dinning turned himself in to local officials. While he was in their custody, the mob returned to his farm, drove his family from their house, looted it, and razed it to the ground.|$|E

The meats of Bali cattle, Kacang goat, native <b>chicken,</b> <b>and</b> local duck were used in this study. The meats were ground using food processor added with aquadest to obtain meat extract. The meat extracts were then hydrolyzed using protease enzymes to obtain hydrolysate of meat protein. Protein concentration of meat extract and hydrolysate of meat protein were determined, and were confirmed by sodium dodecyl sulfate - poly acrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). ACE inhibitory activity of hydrolysate of meat protein derived from Bali cattle, Kacang goat, native <b>chicken,</b> <b>and</b> local duck was also determined. The results showed that protein concentration of hydrolysate of meat protein of Bali cattle, Kacang goat, native <b>chicken,</b> <b>and</b> local duck meat {{was significantly higher than}} their meat extracts. SDS-PAGE analysis indicated that hydrolysate of meat protein of Bali cattle, Kacang goat, native <b>chicken,</b> <b>and</b> local duck had more peptides with lower molecular weight, compared to their meat extracts.
