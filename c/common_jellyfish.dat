40|$|Background: Over {{recent decades}} {{jellyfish}} have caused fish kill events and recurrent gill problems in marine-farmed salmonids. <b>Common</b> <b>jellyfish</b> (Aurelia spp.) {{are among the}} most cosmopolitan jellyfish species in the oceans, with populations increasing in many coastal areas. The negative interaction between jellyfish and fish in aquaculture remains a poorly studied area of science. Thus, a recent fish mortality event in Ireland, involving Aurelia aurita, spurred an investigation into the effects of this jellyfish on marine-farmed salmon. Methodology/Principal Findings: To address the in vivo impact of the <b>common</b> <b>jellyfish</b> (A. aurita) on salmonids, we exposed Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) smolts to macerated A. aurita for 10 hrs under experimental challenge. Gill tissues of control and experimental treatment groups were scored with a system that rated the damage between 0 and 21 using a range of primary and secondary parameters. Our results revealed that A. aurita rapidly and extensively damaged the gills of S. salar, with the pathogenesis of the disorder progressing even after the jellyfish were removed. After only 2 hrs of exposure, significant multi-focal damage to gill tissues was apparent. The nature and extent of the damage increased up to 48 hrs {{from the start of the}} challenge. Although the gills remained extensively damaged at 3 wks from the start of the challenge trial, shortening of the gill lamellae and organisation of the cells indicated an attempt to repair the damage suffered. Conclusions: Our findings clearly demonstrate that A. aurita can cause severe gill problems in marine-farmed fish. With aquaculture predicted to expand worldwide and evidence suggesting that jellyfish populations are increasing in some areas, this threat to aquaculture is of rising concern as significant losses due to jellyfish could be expected to increase in the future.

40|$|Jellyfish are {{effective}} predators on mesozooplankton and release {{large amounts of}} dissolved organic matter. Nevertheless, jellyfish initiated trophic cascades and bottom-up influences impacting lower trophic levels have received limited attention. We conducted a mesocosm experiment to quantify simultaneous top-down and bottom-up effects of a <b>common</b> <b>jellyfish,</b> Cyanea capillata, in a natural plankton community during autumn. Treatments were 0, 2 or 5 jellyfish per 2. 5 m 3 mesocosm, four replicates each, with initial additions of inorganic nutrients. Primary and bacterial production, species abundance and composition of several trophic levels and nutrient and carbon dynamics were followed during the 8 -day experiment. Multivariate statistics and generalized additive mixed modelling were applied to test whether jellyfish carbon concentration (0 – 1. 26 mg jellyC L− 1) in the mesocosms affected the variables monitored. Unexpected negligible predatory impact of jellyfish on mesozooplankton was observed, potentially related to jellyfish senescence. Community compositions of bacteria, phytoplankton and mesozooplankton changed with time, but did not differ between treatments. However, nutrient regeneration by jellyfish was evident, and jellyfish had {{a positive impact on}} total and specific bacterial production, total primary production and the > 10 µm chlorophyll a fraction. Bottom-up influences from abundant jellyfish could thus stimulate productivity in nutrient depleted autumnal surface waters...|$|E

40|$|Oxidative {{phosphorylation}} couples ATP synthesis to respiratory electron transport. In eukaryotes, this coupling {{occurs in}} mitochondria, which carry DNA. Respiratory electron transport {{in the presence}} of molecular oxygen generates free radicals, reactive oxygen species (ROS), which are mutagenic. In animals, mutational damage to mitochondrial DNA therefore accumulates within the lifespan of the individual. Fertilization generally requires motility of one gamete, and motility requires ATP. It has been proposed that oxidative phosphorylation is nevertheless absent in the special case of quiescent, template mitochondria, that these remain sequestered in oocytes and female germ lines and that oocyte mitochondrial DNA is thus protected from damage, but evidence to support that view has hitherto been lacking. Here we show that female gametes of Aurelia aurita, the <b>common</b> <b>jellyfish,</b> do not transcribe mitochondrial DNA, lack electron transport, and produce no free radicals. In contrast, male gametes actively transcribe mitochondrial genes for respiratory chain components and produce ROS. Electron microscopy shows that this functional division of labour between sperm and egg is accompanied by contrasting mitochondrial morphology. We suggest that mitochondrial anisogamy underlies division of any animal species into two sexes with complementary roles in sexual reproduction. We predict that quiescent oocyte mitochondria contain DNA as an unexpressed template that avoids mutational accumulation by being transmitted through the female germ line. The active descendants of oocyte mitochondria perform oxidative phosphorylation in somatic cells and in male gametes of each new generation, and the mutations that they accumulated are not inherited. We propose that the avoidance of ROS-dependent mutation is the evolutionary pressure underlying maternal mitochondrial inheritance and the developmental origin of the female germ line...|$|E
40|$|Limfjorden {{is a major}} Danish {{water system}} that connects the North Sea via Thyborøn Kanal {{in the west and}} to the Kattegat in the east. Limfjorden is heavily eutrophicated and certain areas suffer from oxygen {{depletion}} each summer. Bottom-dwelling fish have disappeared as the number of jellyfish and ctenophores has increased. The abundance and predation impact of jellyfish and ctenophores in Limfjorden have been described in a number of studies conducted during the last decade, and a mini-review of this literature is given here in Section 2. The <b>common</b> <b>jellyfish</b> Aurelia aurita may, in a few years, be very abundant and exert a considerable predatory impact on zooplankton and fish larvae. Abundance, species composition, and population dynamics of A. aurita may, at irregular time intervals, be strongly influenced not only by the water brought into Limfjorden from the North Sea, but also by competition with the invasive ctenophore Mnemiopsis leidyi that occurred {{for the first time in}} extremely high numbers in 2007, brought into the fjord system with North Sea water. It has been suggested that Limfjorden may function as an incubator for M. leidyi with the potential to further seed M. leidyi into the Kattegat and adjacent Danish waters, and recent observations seem to support this hypothesis. In Section 3, we report on two bloom events of ctenophores, Pleurobrachia pileus and M. leidyi, along with their predators (Beroe spp.) in Limfjorden in the autumns of 2012 and 2013, when the usually dominating A. aurita was absent. However, the present observation of B. ovata being M. leidyi’s native predator and a new species in Limfjorden may in the future reduce the abundance of M. leidyi...|$|E
40|$|Temperate {{estuaries}} are nursery {{areas for}} economically important fisheries resources. The <b>common</b> <b>jellyfish</b> Aurelia aurita is a resident species {{in many of}} these areas, where it can reach high abundances. This work aimed to determine the potential for predation of A. aurita on zooplanktonic organisms and early life stages of fishes, measuring feeding rates at concentrations that mimic those occurring for zooplankton, fish eggs and larvae in an estuarine nursery area. A set of experiments was aimed at determining the feeding selectivity of jellyfish when offered a mixture of fish eggs and larvae and wild plankton. Clearance rates varied markedly with prey availability and concentrations. When given mixtures of different prey types, jellyfish preferentially elected some taxa (copepods and fish eggs). Data obtained in the laboratory experiments were used to infer the potential impact of jellyfish predation upon zooplankton and ichthyoplankton in the Guadiana estuary (Southern Iberia). Repeated sampling of zooplankton, fish eggs and medusae was undertaken during the summer season of 2011. Abundance determinations were combined with experimentally estimated clearance rates of individual medusa to infer the potential jellyfish-induced mortality on prey in the area. In June and early August jellyfishinduced mortality rates were very high, and half-life times (t 1 / 2) were consequently short for the zooplankton and ichthyoplankton. Although the potentially overestimation of our feeding rates typical of confined laboratory experiments, the results show high ingestion and clearance rates at high temperatures, typical from summer condition, and results also suggest that either by predation on early life stages of fish, or by competition for food resources, jellyfish may {{have a significant impact on}} estuarine communities and its nursery function...|$|E

Therefore, {{it is important to}} identify causes for the enhancement of A. aurita populations to forecast likely outbreaks prior to the season of medusa blooms. In the population dynamics of scyphozoan jellyfish, the following two factors are important to determine the size of adult (medusa) population: (1) the abundance of benthic polyps, which reproduce asexually and undergo seasonal strobilation to release planktonic ephyrae, and (2) the mortality of ephyrae before recruitment to the medusa stage. Although much knowledge has been accumulated about physio-ecology of the polyp stage by previous studies, only few studies have been conducted for the ephyra stage...|$|R
40|$|In 2007, the {{invasive}} ctenophore Mnemiopsis leidyi {{was observed}} {{for the first}} time in Limfjorden (Denmark) where it exhibited mass occurrence in late summer while the indigenous and usually dominating <b>common</b> <b>jellyfish,</b> Aurelia aurita, was nearly absent. Both species were further studied in 2008 and 2009 and it was found that the additional predation pressure by M. leidyi caused the zooplankton stocks to be severely depressed. Here, we report on the population dynamics and predation impact of M. leidyi and A. aurita in Limfjorden in 2010 and 2011. In 2010, M. leidyi was observed in Limfjorden {{for the first time}} in August with the highest density and largest size in the central parts (Skive Fjord). The estimated half-life of zooplankton (copepods) was only important in Skive Fjord in mid August 2010 when the joint-predation impact of A. aurita and M. leidyi was 2. 3 d. In 2011, no M. leidyi were observed on the first cruise (3 August), while during the second cruise (17 November) it was observed in large numbers. The western most location (Venø Bugt) was dominated by large sized (≤ 60 mm) M. leidyi, while the average size decreased towards the central parts of the fjord-system. The proportion of cydippid larvae increased from west to the central parts thus suggesting rapid reproduction and population-size expansion. The bio-volumes of ctenophores were highest in the central part with 85 ml m- 3 in Løgstør Bredning, which may be compared to the greatest mean bio-volume of about 184 ml m- 3 observed in the Black Sea in 1989 when the zooplankton and fish stocks collapsed.

40|$|Background: Although the hydrozoan Olindias sambaquiensis is {{the most}} <b>common</b> <b>jellyfish</b> {{associated}} with human envenomation in southeastern and southern Brazil, information about the composition of its venom is rare. Thus, the present study aimed to analyze pharmacological aspects of O. sambaquiensis venom as well as clinical manifestations observed in affected patients. Crude protein extracts were prepared from the tentacles of animals; peptides and proteins were sequenced and submitted to circular dichroism spectroscopy. Creatine kinase, cytotoxicity and hemolytic activity were evaluated by specific methods. Results: We identified two novel cytolysins denominated oshem 1 and oshem 2 from the tentacles of this jellyfish. The cytolysins presented the amino acid sequences NEGKAKCGNTAGSKLTFKSADECTKTGQK (oshem 1) and NNSKAKCGDLAGWSKLTFKSADECTKTGQKS (oshem 2) with respective molecular masses of 3. 013 kDa and 3. 375 kDa. Circular dichroism revealed that oshem 1 has random coils and small a-helix conformation as main secondary structure whereas oshem 2 presents mainly random coils as its main secondary structure {{probably due to the}} presence of W (13) in oshem 2. The hemolysis levels induced by oshem 1 and oshem 2 using a peptide concentration of 0. 2 mg/mL were, respectively, 51. 7 +/- 6. 5 % and 32. 9 +/- 8. 7 % (n = 12 and p <= 0. 05). Oshem 1 and oshem 2 showed significant myonecrotic activity, evaluated by respective CK level measurements of 1890. 4 +/- 89 and 1212. 5 +/- 103 (n = 4 and p <= 0. 05). In addition, myonecrosis was also evaluated by cell survival, which was measured at 72. 4 +/- 8. 6 % and 83. 5 +/- 6. 7 % (n = 12 and p <= 0. 05), respectively. The structural analysis showed that both oshem 1 and oshem 2 should be classified as a small basic hemolytic peptide. Conclusion: The amino acid sequences of two peptides were highly similar while the primary amino acid sequence analysis revealed W (22 th) as the most important mutation. Finally oshem 1 and oshem 2 are the first cytolytic peptides isolated from the Olindias sambaquiensis and should probably represent a novel class of cytolytic peptides...|$|E
40|$|During recent years, {{jellyfish}} blooms {{have become}} in a passionate issue among marine scientists {{with a series}} of studies and reviews. The main concern about this blooms are related with ecosystem and socio-economic impacts and lately with the possibility of a global increase in these blooms. Jellyfish populations are known to follow periodic fluctuations in occurrence, abundance (biomass), where some regions, like the Mediterranean Sea, appear to sustain a long-term increase. The Mediterranean Sea has been largely and historically affected with blooms of several jellyfish species. Among them Pelagia noctiluca is the most abundant and the most problematic jellyfish species in the Western Mediterranean. Nevertheless, little information about the environmental restriction on the spatio-temporal dynamics of jellyfish blooms is available. In order to address these needs, this thesis has been structured covering two geographical areas reflecting two different approaches to understanding jellyfish spatio-temporal dynamics, bloom formation, impacts and analytical procedures. The first part of the thesis (Papers 1 - 3) deals with the outbreaks of the cubozoan Carybdea marsupialis along the coast of Denia (Alicante), including innovative work to develop experimentally based tools and analyses to generate scientifically-based recommendations for stakeholders. The second part of this thesis was done on the northern Mediterranean Spanish coast (Catalan coast) (Papers 4 - 6). This work is mostly based on stranded jellyfish data collected by the MEDUSA project in association with the Catalan Water Agency (ACA). The general objective of the Thesis was to understand the spatio-temporal dynamics of the jellyfish along the Spanish Mediterranean coast and the economic impacts of their blooms. Along the coast of Denia (Alicante), the coastal box jellyfish Carybdea marsupialis has caused major concern due to its painful sting and high abundances since 2008. The effects of environmental variables on the local (~ tens of kilometres) abundance of the cubomedusae showed that sea surface temperature (SST) and salinity were the main environmental variables, followed by those related to primary and secondary production and local retention or transportation to the coast. This conclusion led to our management recommendation that, to reduce the blooms of C. marsupialis, crop fertilizers and sewage discharges should be reduced in highly populated or industrialized areas. Most importantly, high amounts of nutrients reaching the coast (by rivers or ground water discharges) should be prevented, especially in early spring. The mauve stinger Pelagia noctiluca is the most <b>common</b> <b>jellyfish</b> in the Mediterranean Sea. Along the Catalan Coast, stranded P. noctiluca medusae occurred throughout the sampling period, but with highest abundances in spring and spatially correlated with submarine canyons. Bayesian analysis of the importance of stochastic versus deterministic drivers of jellyfish outbreaks along the Catalan Coast showed that jellyfish outbreaks were more frequent in May and June, particularly in the years 2009 and 2010. Results indicated that deterministic processes were more important than the stochastic component of environmental variation, suggesting that extreme events, visualized as the compound effects of environmental variables, did not affect the probability of an outbreak along the Catalan Coast. From a stated-choice questionnaire we calculated that the well-being gains associated with a reduction of jellyfish outbreaks in this area would range between € 312 and € 322 million annually, corresponding approximately to 19 % of the tourism expenditures of the Catalan population in 2012. Improvement in the beach water quality was, by far, the most valuable attribute for all types of respondents. Improvement in the beach infrastructure was ranked second and reduction in the risk of jellyfish outbreaks, third. This study confirms the urgency to provide daily information by use of the wide set of social media applications. Los impactos de las proliferaciones masivas (blooms) de medusas sobre las actividades humanas, han aumentado en el último tiempo. Uno de los ecosistemas más afectados es el Mar Mediterráneo donde en las últimas décadas la frecuencia de los blooms, así como el número de especies involucradas han aumentado. Así, la necesidad de entender la dinámica espacio temporal de los blooms de medusas a lo largo de la costa Mediterránea española y sus impactos económicos, es de primera importancia. La primera parte de la tesis se desarrolló en la zona central (costa de Alicante), donde el bloom del cubozoo Carybdea marsupialis en 2008 afectó negativamente hasta 185 personas diarias, impactando negativamente al turismo local. La asociación positiva de esta especie con bajos niveles de salinidad y altos niveles de producción primaria permite sugerir que efectos sinérgicos de las descargas fluviales ricas en nutrientes por actividades agropecuarias, asociado a la transformación y alteración de hábitat, han favorecido a esta especie. La segunda parte se desarrolló en la zona norte (costa de Cataluña), donde un programa de monitoreo basado en ciencia ciudadana, reveló que siete especies de medusas son las más comunes en esta zona con diferentes dinámicas espacio – temporales. La especie más importante es el escifozoo Pelagia noctiluca, que mostró las máximas abundancias durante primavera. Altas abundancias de esta especie estuvieron espacialmente asociadas a la presencia de cañones submarinos, permitiendo establecer una nueva hipótesis acerca de la migración vertical estacional en esta especie. Los análisis bayesianos mostraron que las proliferaciones de medusas fueron más frecuentes en Mayo y Junio, particularmente en los años 2009 y 2010 en la costa Catalana. Los resultados mostraron también que los componentes determinísticos fueron más importantes que los componentes aleatorios de la variabilidad ambiental, sugiriendo que los eventos extremos no afectaron la probabilidad de una proliferación de medusas en estas costas. Basado en un cuestionario realizado a usuarios de la playa, se calculó que los bienes y servicios asociados a la reducción en proliferaciones masivas de medusas en la zona de la Costa Catalana estuvo entre € 312 and € 322 millones anuales, correspondiendo aproximadamente al 19 % de los gastos en turismo en 2012. El mejoramiento en la calidad del agua fue el atributo más valorado, seguido por un mejoramiento en la infraestructura en las playas y la reducción en el riego de proliferaciones de medusas como el tercer atributo más valorado...|$|E

We investigated {{the relationship between the}} <b>common</b> semaeostome <b>jellyfish</b> Aurelia aurita and the ophiuroid Ophiocnemis marmorata at Ningaloo Reef in Western Australia. We assessed the prevalence of the association; described the relationship between medusa size and the number of ophiuroids they hosted; and used stable isotope analysis to determine whether O. marmorata were feeding on medusae hosts or planktonic prey. Seventy-nine per cent of the 92 medusae sampled hosted between 1 and 14 ophiuroids that ranged in size from 1 to 6 mm disc diameter. The number of ophiuroids hosted was positively correlated with medusa size and all medusae > 135 mm bell diameter hosted at least one ophiuroid. Stable Isotope Analysis in R modelling of δ 13 C and δ 15 N of the ophiuroids and their potential food sources indicated that ophiuroids derived their nutrition predominantly from mesozooplankton and seston and not from medusae. Ophiuroids were never observed filter feeding, so we suggest that the ophiuroids may be kleptoparasites that steal planktonic food from their host.

40|$|During last decades {{many studies}} {{highlighted}} cnidarian relevance in worldwide trophic chains, {{as well as}} the considerable frequency and size of outbreaks over the years. A high inter-specific variability, survival ability and harsh conditions resistance built a clear path for these animals to the top of trophic chains, with a corresponding raising impact on sea-related anthropogenic activities. Indeed, cnidarians possess efficient stinging characteristics and represent a threat to bathers and fishermen. Pelagia noctiluca (Forsskål, 1775), the “Mauve Stinger”, is a <b>common</b> Mediterranean scyphozoan <b>jellyfish.</b> It occurs mainly from March to May, but also throughout the year in South Tyrrhenian waters around Northeastern Sicily. The venomousness of this jellyfish is due to three main different kinds of nematocysts, which are known to contain toxins which at present are not exhaustively known. In this study, a first evaluation of the cytotoxic activity of heterotrichous microbasic eurytele nematocysts from Pelagia noctiluca is presented and discussed. Nematocysts were isolated from tentacles of Pelagia noctiluca and the content was extracted by sonication (aqueous extract). Cytotoxicity assays employing MTT assay and Trypan Blue dye exclusion were carried out on L 929 mouse lung fibroblasts. Aqueous extracts induced cytotoxicity to L 929 cells with 36. 9 % cell survival after 24 hours treatment with aqueous extract of 150 × 103 P. noctiluca nematocysts/ml, and 68. 9 % cell survival after treatment with extract of 75 × 103 nematocysts/ml.

40|$|Background: The phylum Cnidarians {{have over}} nine {{thousand}} species that approximately, one hundred species are dangerous for humans. Annually, {{a large number}} of deaths were reported due to jellyfish stings. The manifestations depend on their species and kind of venoms, and include the local and systemic manifestations. A number of methods and compounds were used and under investigation for management of injuries with jellyfishes. Due to the lack of an integrated systematic review, the current study was done. Materials and Methods: The PubMed data bank was searched for the term “Jellyfish”. A total of 1677 papers were found. These papers were divided into three categories: medical, biomedical and biotechnological fields. The medical category was further divided into three subcategories comprising systemic manifestations, cutaneous manifestations and treatments for the stings of jellyfishes. The biomedical category was further subdivided into genomics, proteomics, and biology of venoms, mechanisms of actions and products of biomedical significance. In this part of systematic review, the medical aspects of injuries with jellyfishes were evaluated. Results: The clinical manifestations in jellyfish envenomation depend on their species and the nature of venoms. The most common clinical manifestations of jellyfish stings are cutaneous presentations like urticasia, erythema, swelling, vesicles and severe dermonectoric manifestations. Systemic manifestations were seen in the stings of box jellyfishes, Portuguese man-of-war and in Irukandji syndrome. The most <b>common</b> recommendations for <b>jellyfish</b> envenomation managements include decreasing the local effects of venom, prevention of the venomous nematocysts release, and Controlling of systemic reactions. Application of commercial vinegar (4 - 6 % acetic acid), hot water immersion (HWI) (42 ° C for 20 minutes), ice packs, sea water rinsing for inactivating nematocysts, administration of topical and parenteral analgesics, corticosteroids, and antihistamines are the basics for treatments of jellyfish envenomations. The Anti-venom for jellyfishes can counteract the effects of venom. Conclusion: The cutaneous manifestations in jellyfish envenomation are the most common clinical presentation. There was no any conducted double-blind and controlled clinical trials for the management of jellyfish envenomation, the application of commercial vinegar (4 - 6 % acetic acid), hot water, ice packs and sea water rinsing are the fundamentals of treatments in the stings of the jellyfishes...|$|R
40|$|During {{the last}} decade, {{there has been}} a {{dramatic}} increase in jellyfish biomass all over the world. They are infamous for their negative effects on humans. Indeed, they interfere with the tourism by stinging swimmers, with the fishing by clogging nets, with the aquaculture by killing the fishes in net-pens and with the power plants by obstructing cooling-water intake railings. They also have indirect effects on fisheries by feeding on zooplankton and ichthyoplankton, and, therefore, are predators and potential competitors for fishes. The temporal and horizontal distributions of Medusae in the Bay of Calvi were investigated by an analysis of weekly planktonic time series (2003 - 2008) collected at STARESO, University of Liege’s Oceanographic field station located in Corsica (FRANCE). Firstly, our study showed similar seasonal standards throughout the year for the majority of jellyfish communities. However, we noticed an important fluctuation in quantity from year to year. Secondly, we focused on the two most <b>common</b> species of <b>jellyfish</b> found in this area; the calycophoran siphonophore, Chelophyes appendiculata (Eschscholtz, 1829) and the scyphozoan medusa Pelagia noctiluca (Forskal, 1775). The life cycle of Chelophyes appendiculata was established by using the different stages found during diverse periods into our samples and seemed to be correlated with the temperature of the water. The analysis of the spatial distribution of Pelagia noctiluca emphasizes the fact that during the 2006 bloom; most of the organisms were located far away from the coastlines where they were forming active swarms of 200 m of length with 5 to 10 individuals per m³. In the swarms, the individuals are healthy and swim actively in the upper layer (10 to 60 m) of the water with tentacles extended, probably in order to catch the food. The swarms are generally close to wind’s protected areas where the turbulences of the surface are reduced and zooplankton is accumulating. The year following a high zooplankton biomass was characterized by an increase of the number of jellyfishes. We can thus conclude that the overgrowth of adult jellyfishes seems to be related with the availability of zooplankton communities...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} investigated potential {{drivers of}} jellyfish-human interactions in North Carolina. Jellyfish populations and human use of coasts are increasing; therefore, jellyfish-human interactions {{are poised to}} become more frequent. This research investigated how abiotic variables (i. e. temperature and salinity) and wind-driven circulation in the Neuse River Estuary influenced the distribution and abundance of the sea nettle, Chrysaora quinquecirrha, at six recreational sites. Life history traits were also investigated to determine if jellyfish aggregations at the recreation sites could be linked to sexual reproduction. Finally, the human perspective on jellyfish was investigated. One hundred eighteen people were surveyed at 25 coastal locations prone to jellyfish occurrences. This survey used cultural consensus theory to gather perspectives of jellyfish ecology and how jellyfish influence society from four cultural groups: fishers (commercial and recreational), recreationists (surfers, swimmers, etc.), North Carolina coastal researchers, and jellyfish researchers in the United States. Results show: 1) southwest winds 3 to 8 meters per second that occurred 1 and 5 days prior to observations resulted in more sea nettles observed at the Neuse River Estuary recreation sites; 2) aggregations of sea nettles resulting from wind events could not be definitively linked to sexual reproduction based on jellyfish gonad analysis; 3) cultural perspectives of jellyfish ecology were different among groups; this was most obvious when the role of jellyfish in food webs was evaluated. All groups shared similar societal perspectives, including tolerance to specific numbers of jellyfish. Overall, this research has identified physical, ecological and societal factors that influence jellyfish-human interactions in North Carolina and these interactions appear to be mediated by several different factors. Understanding these factors will allow for management of jellyfish-human interactions. Recreational areas subjected to high sea nettle occurrences based on local oceanographic conditions may employ barrier nets to decrease the frequency of encounters. Further studies into the dominant mode of reproduction for sea nettles may indicate which life history stage, polyp or medusa, {{might be the best}} target for management to reduce jellyfish-human interactions. Finally, outreach education about <b>common</b> misconceptions concerning <b>jellyfish</b> may remove some confusion surrounding the role of these organisms in the environment.   Ph. D...|$|R
