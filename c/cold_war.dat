5|$|The <b>Cold</b> <b>War</b> {{continues}} to influence world affairs. The post-Cold War world {{is considered to}} be unipolar, with the United States the sole remaining superpower. The <b>Cold</b> <b>War</b> defined the political role of the United States after World WarII—by 1989 the United States had military alliances with 50 countries, with 526,000 troops stationed abroad, with 326,000 in Europe (two-thirds of which in west Germany) and 130,000 in Asia (mainly Japan and South Korea). The <b>Cold</b> <b>War</b> also marked the zenith of peacetime military–industrial complexes, especially in the United States, and large-scale military funding of science. These complexes, though their origins may be found as early as the 19th century, snowballed considerably during the <b>Cold</b> <b>War.</b>|$|E

5|$|However, the {{aftermath}} of the <b>Cold</b> <b>War</b> is not always easily erased, as many of the economic and social tensions that were exploited to fuel <b>Cold</b> <b>War</b> competition in parts of the Third World remain acute. The breakdown of state control {{in a number of areas}} formerly ruled by communist governments produced new civil and ethnic conflicts, particularly in the former Yugoslavia. In Central and Eastern Europe, the end of the <b>Cold</b> <b>War</b> has ushered in an era of economic growth and an increase in the number of liberal democracies, while in other parts of the world, such as Afghanistan, independence was accompanied by state failure.|$|E
5|$|In 1953, {{changes in}} {{political}} leadership {{on both sides}} shifted the dynamic of the <b>Cold</b> <b>War.</b> Dwight D. Eisenhower was inaugurated president that January.

5|$|The <b>Cold</b> <b>War</b> {{was a major}} political, {{economic}} and military endeavor for over four decades, but the confrontation between the two superpowers had decreased dramatically {{by the end of}} Reagan's presidency. The significance of Reagan's role in ending the <b>Cold</b> <b>War</b> has spurred contentious and opinionated debate. That Reagan played a role in contributing to the downfall of the Soviet Union is agreed, but the extent of this role is continuously debated, with many believing that Reagan's defense policies, economic policies, military policies and hard line rhetoric against the Soviet Union and Communism, as well as summits with General Secretary Gorbachev played a significant part in ending the <b>Cold</b> <b>War.</b>|$|E
