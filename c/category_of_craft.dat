40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{explores the}} historical creation <b>of</b> <b>craft</b> “traditions” in late 19 th and early 20 th century Western India. In this period, crafts became central to both critiques of British rule in South Asia and colonial proposals {{for how to}} modernize the subcontinent. What, exactly, had happened to crafts under colonial rule {{and what could be}} done to save them for national development: these were questions which became intricately involved in attempts to define Indian heritage, whether in imperial or nationalist terms. Examining exhibitions, schools, craft factories and stores which tried to reshape traditional crafts, I argue that crafts provided the context for often furious debates over the nature of Indian society, the direction of the Indian economy, and the need for a national culture in the face of rapidly changing tastes. Specifically, I examine four areas in which change was most evident in crafts: design, techniques of production, organization of production, and consumption. Through efforts in these areas, concerned outsiders—both British and Indian—drew together disparate practices and products into a single <b>category</b> <b>of</b> <b>crafts,</b> marked less by qualities inherent in objects themselves than by a distinctive relationship between artisanal labor and specific goods. The category “crafts” did not exist in actual fact: it was discursively and materially produced through attempts to define and shape objects and practices. Once produced, however, it had real power. Discursively, crafts had an important role in shaping nationalist arguments about Indian deindustrialization under colonial rule. More materially, the <b>category</b> <b>of</b> <b>crafts</b> influenced economic planning, driving and dividing development agendas to this day. By tracing the cultural creation of an economic category—crafts—this dissertation aims to draw new connections between economic and cultural history. Such connections not only help to explain the colonial-era attention to traditional crafts alongside more pressing concerns with modern industrialization. They also provide help to contextualize Mohandas Gandhi 2 ̆ 7 s influential khadi campaigns of the 1920 s—campaigns which, for all their striking innovations, were built on cultural and economic understandings of the “crafts question” built up over the previous seventy years. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{current study}} {{examines}} the definition, dimensional structure, and nomological network <b>of</b> job <b>crafting,</b> {{in addition to}} the ability profiles of job crafters. Job crafting is defined as the physical, cognitive, social, technological, and procedural changes to a job that a worker makes with the intention of improving the job for themselves. Two general <b>categories</b> <b>of</b> job <b>crafting</b> are proposed: an active and goal directed efficiency/effectiveness job crafting and a less active withdrawal oriented form <b>of</b> job <b>crafting.</b> Study one is a qualitative inquiry into the dimensional structure <b>of</b> job <b>crafting,</b> with analyses suggesting seven dimensions. <b>Categories</b> <b>of</b> efficiency/effectiveness job <b>crafting</b> include: work role expansion; implementing work organization; metacognition; adoption of knowledge and technology; and social expansion and facilitation. Withdrawal oriented job <b>crafting</b> includes <b>categories</b> <b>of</b> withdrawal and work role reduction. Study two is an examination of the descriptive characteristics and employees 2 ̆ 7 perceived outcomes of each type <b>of</b> job <b>crafting.</b> Results support the presence of general efficiency/effectiveness and withdrawal oriented <b>categories</b> <b>of</b> job <b>crafting.</b> They also show that elements <b>of</b> efficiency/effectiveness job <b>crafting</b> are perceived as requiring more effort, being engaged more frequently, and being more effective than some elements of withdrawal oriented job crafting. Study three is a quantitative examination of the antecedents and consequences of both types <b>of</b> job <b>crafting.</b> Results suggest that efficiency/effectiveness job crafting is predicted by contextual characteristics supporting job crafting; personal characteristics; and personal work objectives. Efficiency/effectiveness job crafting subsequently predicts outcomes of performance, development, and work experience. Withdrawal oriented job crafting is predicted by personal characteristics and contextual characteristics supporting job crafting. Study four is a quantitative examination of the structure and outcomes of individuals 2 ̆ 7 job crafting ability profiles. Results suggest the presence of five distinct clusters of job crafters. High ability crafters tend to have higher rankings of performance and development than low ability job crafters and some intermediate ability job crafters. However, intermediate and low ability job crafters tend to experience less strain than high ability job crafters. Results, limitations, future directions and managerial implications are discussed. ...|$|R

40|$|Worldwide, {{externally}} supported craft development initiatives aim {{to enhance}} the capability of local craft producers to succeed in globalized markets. However, the contribution that these organizations make towards the abilities of local actors remains unclear. Following a hermeneutic reflection on literature, empirical field experience derived from the African and South Pacific contexts and a multiple case study analysis of craft development organizations, the research investigates the pre-conceptions that lie behind approaches adopted in craft development initiatives. Two emerging elements of particular importance have been identified. Firstly, the Western ideological notion of craft, influenced particularly by the Arts and Crafts movement, and secondly the ethos of social design, built on {{the legacy of the}} appropriate technology movement. It is argued that both of these have a constraining impact on the development of indigenous design skills that underpin successful participation in global markets. Noting that craft covers a wide range of practices, the research at hand furthermore identifies a <b>category</b> <b>of</b> <b>craft</b> that has become the epitome of Non-Western craft. These decorative and exotic artifacts are labor-intensive to produce, making them only marginally profitable for the makers. Yet there is an apparent emphasis on the promotion of this category within international craft development initiatives. The research concludes that the current practice of craft development initiatives cannot fully {{contribute to the development of}} the response capability of the local craft producers. Enhancing the impact of these initiatives would require serious reconsideration of product strategies and a re-think of the premises under which initiatives are undertaken. A new approach is suggested, one that examines design within a framework of social, economic and ecological sustainability, taking into consideration such socio-cultural issues as the peoples’ right to economic freedoms and the use of capabilities, building on the work of the economist and Nobel Laureate Amartya Sen.

The aim is to explore significance of knowing certain craft, in my case pottery and to exclude craft product from the <b>category</b> <b>of</b> <b>craft</b> and elevate it to the sublime contemporary artistic level {{with the help of}} artistic theory. I discuss problems through the definition of craft, art and their role. To understand, why in contemporaneity we divide craft and art between two fields, we have {{to get to know the}} meaning of aesthetics and its history. In this part, I focused especially on Kant's Aesthetic Theory, by which we must pay attention to his philosophical style and to our interpretation of his text. I continue my diploma work with short summary of important turning points in the history of ceramics, which are crucial for discussed topic. I research relationship between the craft and art, what are the differences and what they have in common in the central part of my diploma paper. This is my starting point for searching for problems and solutions in the field of pottery. I compare artists in the field of contemporary art and ceramics on the basis of artistic variables. With this I try to show pottery turning as a process for completion of artistic object and pottery vessel as a work of art. I conclude the theoretical part in the field of ceramics with the presentation of my own works with the media of pottery. In pedagogical part I discuss about the meaning and importance of gaining craft knowledge and skills by children and their development of motoric functions. I try to expose the importance of developing the technique, getting acquainted with craft work and learning the technique. By this I qoute developmental theories, which are dealing with the importance of physical activities and development of motoric functions. I expose the Piaget's Theory of Cognitive Develpoment as one of the most distinctive theories. I complete pedagogical part with two chapters about the importance of knowing craft skills and themes about encouraging of gaining motoric skills in school. ...|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{attempts to}} explain the organization of pottery production on the ancient Chengdu Plain during the early and middle Bronze Age (ca. 1800 - 800 BC) and its relationship with social complexity. It investigates the formation of production controls and traditions in different dimensions and at various manufacturing stages of pottery production, and compares and classifies ceramics mainly from three site clusters, Sanxingdui, Shi'erqiao, and Jinsha, using a series of analyses. First, metric measurement and coefficients of variation are {{used to assess the}} degree of standardization in vessels and whether the metric dimensions form specific model values. The results suggest that different production loci, while producing the same type of pottery vessels, had varying degrees of production control over these metric dimensions and distinctive concerns about production details. Second, mineralogical and chemical analyses show that, under the same cultural influence, potters in different locations processed and fabricated their generally available raw materials in distinctive fashions and according to unique formulae. If we broaden our point of comparison to the Sichuan Basin and beyond, the cultural idiosyncrasy of these social groups is even clearer, which forces us to consider the circumstances of individual production traditions. The spatial arrangements and use contexts <b>of</b> multiple <b>categories</b> <b>of</b> <b>craft</b> production in these settlements reveal that the production activities of the Chengdu Plain were loosely organized at co-residential households or at the community level in response to local subsistence and social needs. Despite such loose organization and the lack of managing supervision, working groups in different loci interacted to some degree and shared manufacturing ideas. Production norms and traditions, on such occasions, were thus most likely shaped by repetitive practices of routine production procedures, rather than by institutionalized power. The accumulation of local communications allowed these domestic economies to produce intensively and distribute products across a large geographic area, signaling mutual influence across the Chengdu Plain and its neighboring regions. Through this intensive communication, social relations were created, altered, and integrated into complex networks...|$|R

40|$|Fresh {{approaches}} to design emerging in design art and new craft present intersections between the conventionally distinct <b>categories</b> <b>of</b> visual art, <b>craft,</b> and design. In {{spite of their}} stated aim to cross-over disciplines, debates within design art and new craft characterise the term integration in different ways according to the value they attribute to conceptualisation, decoration, function, and context. While advocates of specialisation criticise hybrid design because they believe it produces only an homogenising blurring of distinctive practices, what is compelling in the new discourses is that although they intersect they are dissonant and serve to highlight the gaps between visual art, craft and design. While design art acknowledges the influences of design on art {{of the second half}} of the twentieth century, and new craft links craft with design’s technology and distribution systems, both reveal the culturally sanctioned parameters of visual art and craft. Rather than blur the boundaries of the fields <b>of</b> visual art, <b>craft</b> and design practice, the concept of integration reveals a number of prevailing conventions that each field produces.

Leisure may play a particularly important role for them. The purpose of this investigation was to compare the recreation patterns of selected nonworking women in a homogeneous residential community with the socio-economic characteristics of age, educational attainment, income, personal motivation, and special interest. The field of investigation included the communities of Encino and Tarzana, which are part of the Los Angeles metropolitan area. The participants in this research included nonworking {{women between the ages of}} 20 and 54. The inquiry used was a descriptive survey. The survey sample was selected using a stratified cluster method which is a form of random selection. The questionnaire was of a uniformed closed type devised to retrieve information on the recreation habits and socio-economic characteristics of the respondents. The sample included 200 respondents. The recreation information obtained was put into eleven categories for statistical analysis. Five statistical tests were used; they were: frequency distribution; stepwise regression; factor analysis; factor analysis using stepwise regression; and analysis of variance. All of the data was treated by the SPSS (Statistical Package for the Social Sciences) program through electronic data processing. The results showed that age was inversely related to the <b>categories</b> <b>of</b> arts and <b>crafts</b> and <b>of</b> sports and games. The <b>categories</b> <b>of</b> acquisitiveness and entertainment were somewhat related to education, while the <b>category</b> <b>of</b> socializing was somewhat related to income.

40|$|Crafts in Canada have persisted {{and grown}} {{over the past}} century, despite being marginalised by industrialism and globalism. Crafts {{practice}} and the education of craftspeople has matured into a broad, expressive, cultural phenomenon. This {{has been accompanied by}} the blossoming of scholarship directed at illuminating the essential and distinctive character <b>of</b> <b>crafts</b> practices and objects. This growth has been supported in part by the relationship <b>of</b> <b>crafts</b> to creative visual arts production in the realms of fine arts and design. However, assimilation into the <b>category</b> <b>of</b> visual arts has distorted how crafts activity is understood, valued, and taught. In crafts degree programmes in Canada’s four independent visual arts schools, the legitimate interests of craftspeople in the particular character, challenges, and import of their practices has been undermined by a dominant visual arts paradigm that has imposed ill-fitting curricula structures based on flawed underlying assumptions about crafts as a contemporary art form. This thesis examines the literature pertaining to crafts and its scholarship. It also provides a valuable portrayal of the historical and current situation <b>of</b> post-secondary professional <b>crafts</b> education at the degree level in the four Canadian art schools offering Bachelor degree in crafts education—Emily Carr University of Art and Design, Alberta College of Art and Design, Ontario College of Art and Design University, and Nova Scotia College of Art and Design University. It then offers a practitioner’s perspective <b>of</b> the <b>crafts</b> world and the nature <b>of</b> <b>crafting</b> activity and creation. Finally it makes an impassioned plea for more concerted efforts to develop crafts scholars and scholarship, and for a well-grounded theoretical basis on which to base an appropriate craft education system tailored to the concerns <b>of</b> the contemporary <b>crafts</b> world. To further this goal, it proposes a framework based on material culture approaches to foster discussion and guide future developments and improvements in crafts education. ...|$|R
