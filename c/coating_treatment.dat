A fully plasma-sprayed TBC system was studied as well. Several bond <b>coat</b> <b>treatments</b> such as smoothing, annealing in vacuum or air, and grit blasting were employed in order to study their effects on TBC life, and particularly the underlying mechanisms of thermally grown oxide (TGO) formation.

Mechanical scarification provided rapid and highest imbibitions, germination percentage and seedling establishment, and also the highest values of early seedling growth characteristics.

Minimally processed vegetables provide convenience, fresh characteristics and human health benefits. Some fresh carrots are minimally processed by abrasive peelers and washed to remove cellular fluids to produce carrot sticks, mini peeled carrots and grated carrots. Shelf life and acceptability of packaged minimally processed carrots is sometimes limited by a white discoloration that develops on abraded surfaces during storage, and poor flavor. This study was undertaken to investigate the effects of genotype, minimal processing and edible <b>coating</b> <b>treatment</b> on quality of mini-peeled carrots. Genotypic variations in total terpenoids, sugars, phenolics, total carotenoids and sensory attributes were observed (P> 0. 05). Among experimental hybrids evaluated TX 30129 had the highest sugar and carotenoid levels. White surface discoloration on mini-peeled carrots was noted 7 days after processing. Total sugars, sucrose, total carotenoids and volatile terpenoid levels decreased during storage. Total soluble phenolics increased up to 14 days storage and then declined. Edible <b>coating</b> <b>treatment</b> effectively retarded white surface discoloration without diminishing microbial or chemical quality of mini-peeled carrots. Sensory scores for fresh carrot flavor, fresh carrot aroma and overall acceptability were higher for coated carrots.

Seeds of each lot were divided into seven sub-lots and were <b>coated</b> with <b>coating</b> <b>treatments</b> 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, plus one un-coated control. The first study was conducted in the growth chamber to evaluate viability and vigor of the seeds coated with the above treatments.

The CST was used to evaluate seed performance of coated seeds in both species. The second study was conducted in the greenhouse to compare the effect of seed treatments on seed and seedling performance under two irrigation regimes: water stress, plants watered every 10 -days, and normal watering, every 3 -days. The third study was conducted in the field to evaluate seed treatments under field conditions. When coated with combinations of biochar, lime, hydrophilic polymers and macronutrients, seed from both lots of both species showed equal or slightly higher germination over the untreated control. No consistent pattern was observed for increasing or decreasing final germination, speed of germination, length of seedlings or dry matter contents of any of the treatments over the untreated controls in both crops under 3 - or 10 -day watering regime.

The browning {{on the surface of}} lotus root slices was prevented by chitosan-based <b>coating</b> and MAP <b>treatment.</b> L* values of coated + MAP and control samples were 68. 8 and 48. 9 after 8 days storage, respectively. For a* and b* values, samples of <b>coated</b> + MAP <b>treatment</b> had the slowest increasing trends among all the treatments. At the end of storage, the coated + MAP samples exhibited the lowest polyphenol oxidase (PPO) activity and malondialdehyde (MDA) content. Its highest overall visual quality (OVQ) scores (> 7) demonstrated that chitosan-based <b>coating</b> + MAP <b>treatment</b> could provide a better inhibitory effect on the browning and extend the shelf life of fresh-cut lotus root. Industrial relevance: Fresh-cut vegetables have drawn the attention of industry as a novel lightly processed product. Both edible <b>coating</b> and MAP <b>treatment</b> cause changes in atmosphere composition and respiration rate of lotus root slices. This combined treatment could be used to control the browning and improve the storage life of this fresh-cut vegetable. This information could be useful for the development of novel application to edible coating and MAP design for lightly processed lotus root. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd...|$|R
