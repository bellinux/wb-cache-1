40|$|Purpose: The {{aim of the}} {{investigation}} was to verify if published data for calculation of the hardenability <b>of</b> <b>steel</b> {{can be used for}} calculation <b>of</b> hardenability <b>of</b> <b>cast</b> <b>steel</b> and the optimal selection of these data for obtaining the best agreement between calculated and experimental data. Design/methodology/approach: The analysis of the hardenability <b>of</b> low alloy <b>cast</b> <b>steel</b> was carried out using Jominy test and analytical Grossmann method. The optimal data for calculation of ideal critical diameter,Di and Jominy curve were selected. Findings: The hardenability curves <b>of</b> <b>cast</b> <b>steel</b> measured on different planes of Jominy test show scatter on the contrary to forged steelPractical implications: Results of investigations prove that data for calculation of hardenability parameters used for steel can be applied with sufficient accuracy for calculation the hardenability <b>of</b> <b>cast</b> <b>steel.</b> The hardenability <b>of</b> <b>cast</b> <b>steel</b> shows scatter <b>of</b> results.

50|$|During the 1800s the Stannington area {{together}} with the nearby Loxley Valley became an important producer of refractory bricks for the expanding Sheffield steel industry. The bricks were used to line the furnaces and were made from ganister, a sort of sandstone and from fireclay from the Stannington pot clay seam which was prevalent in the area. Many ganister and fireclay mines and quarries existed in the area with the major ones being owned by the local firms of Siddons Brothers. (High Matlock Road ganister quarry) and J & J Dyson (firebrick works, Griff's Works, Stopes Road) which sprang up in the district. Refractory production ceased in 2012.

50|$|Wollastonite has {{industrial}} importance worldwide. It {{is used in}} many industries, {{mostly by}} tile factories which have incorporated it into the manufacturing of ceramic to improve many performance parameters, and {{this is due to}} its fluxing properties, freedom from volatile constituents, whiteness, and acicular particle shape. In ceramics, wollastonite decreases shrinkage and gas evolution during firing, increases green and fired strength, maintains brightness during firing, permits fast firing, and reduces crazing, cracking, and glaze defects. In metallurgical applications, wollastonite serves as a flux for welding, a source for calcium oxide, a slag conditioner, and to protect the surface of molten metal during the continuous <b>casting</b> <b>of</b> <b>steel.</b> As an additive in paint, it improves the durability of the paint film, acts as a pH buffer, improves its resistance to weathering, reduces gloss, reduces pigment consumption, and acts as a flatting and suspending agent. In plastics, wollastonite improves tensile and flexural strength, reduces resin consumption, and improves thermal and dimensional stability at elevated temperatures. Surface treatments are used to improve the adhesion between the wollastonite and the polymers to which it is added. As a substitute for asbestos in floor tiles, friction products, insulating board and panels, paint, plastics, and roofing products, wollastonite is resistant to chemical attack, inert, stable at high temperatures, and improves flexural and tensile strength. In some industries, it is used in different percentages of impurities, such as its use as a fabricator of mineral wool insulation, or as an ornamental building material.|$|E
5000|$|The {{fire brick}} company Thomas Wragg & Sons owned a Pot Clay mine {{immediately}} to the south east of the hamlet. Pot Clay is the impure version of Ganister and was in demand in the Sheffield steel industry to make bricks for the lining of furnaces. In the early 1970s the mine was producing 15,000 tons of clay per year, with the company quoting, “The mine can be worked at the present rate for 100 years”. A refractory brick works stood {{at the entrance to}} the mine. However the Ughill mine had drainage problems and although powerful pumps had been installed in the 1950s to pump between 600 and 800 gallons per minute from the mine, the mine closed on 17 November 1977. It had become uneconomic to mine the clay due to water problems and the owners found it more profitable to bring in clay from the Midlands. The site of the mine has been landscaped and returned to agricultural use. [...] J&J Dyson mined fireclay at their open cast quarry at Wheatshire between Ughill and Sugworth. The quarry is closed but can still be seen from the nearby road. Thos. Wragg had small firebrick works at Load Brook (closed 1957) and Brookside (Stopes Road, Stannington, closed 1960) the former previously owned by the Trickett family, the latter by the Drabble family and a major works (Old Wheel Brick Works) in the nearby Loxley Valley. Wraggs along with its local competitors, J&J Dyson of Griffs Works, Stannington and Thos. Marshall of Storrs Bridge Works, Loxley, mined the Stannington Pot Clay seam and manufactured fireclay-based casting pit holloware refractories for use in steel making worldwide. All three plants are closed following a collapse in demand for casting pit refractories of the type made locally mainly because of the introduction of continuous <b>casting</b> <b>of</b> <b>steel</b> worldwide and the general demise of the British steel industry.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. A finite-element model, CON 2 D, {{has been}} {{developed}} to simulate temperature, stress, and shape development during the continuous <b>casting</b> <b>of</b> <b>steel,</b> both in and below the mold. The stress model features an elastic-viscoplastic creep constitutive equation that accounts for the different responses of the liquid, semi-solid, delta-ferrite, and austenite phases. Temperature and composition-dependent functions are also employed for properties such as thermal linear expansion. A contact algorithm is developed to prevent penetration of the shell into the mold wall due to the internal liquid pressure. An efficient two-step algorithm {{has been developed}} to integrate these highly non-linear equations. An inelastic strain damage criterion is developed to predict hot tear crack formation, which includes the contribution of pseudo-strain due to {{the flow of the}} liquid during feeding of the mushy zone. The model is validated with an analytical solution for both temperature and stress in a solidifying slab. It is then applied to predict the maximum casting speed to avoid crack formation due to bulging below the mold during <b>casting</b> <b>of</b> <b>steel</b> billets...|$|E
