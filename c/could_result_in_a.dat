5|$|According to Perry Link, {{pressure}} on Western institutions also takes more subtle forms, including academic self-censorship, whereby research on Falun Gong is avoided because it <b>could</b> <b>result</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> denial of visas for fieldwork in China. Ethan Gutmann {{also noted that}} media organizations and human rights groups also self-censor on the topic, given the PRC government's attitude toward the practice, and the potential repercussions that may follow for making overt representations on Falun Gong's behalf.|$|E
5|$|Another {{quantum effect}} that predicts the {{occurrence}} of faster-than-light speeds is called the Hartman effect; under certain conditions the time needed for a virtual particle to tunnel through a barrier is constant, regardless of {{the thickness of the}} barrier.

Hitler's foreign minister and former Ambassador to London, Joachim von Ribbentrop, assured him that neither Britain nor France would honour their commitments to Poland. Accordingly, on 22 August 1939 Hitler ordered a military mobilisation against Poland.|$|E

5|$|In 2009 {{there were}} 2,340 armed forces {{personnel}} stationed in Dorset including the Royal Armoured Corps at Bovington, Royal Signals at Blandford and the Royal Marines at Poole. The military presence {{has had a}} mixed effect on the local economy, bringing additional employment for civilians, but on occasion having {{a negative impact on}} the tourist trade, particularly when popular areas are closed for military manoeuvres. Plans to relocate the Royal School of Signals from Blandford to South Wales <b>could</b> <b>result</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> loss of up to £74million GVA for the area.|$|E
5|$|The {{consequences}} of a persistent biotic crisis have been predicted to last {{for at least five}} million years. It <b>could</b> <b>result</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> decline in biodiversity and homogenization of biotas, accompanied by a proliferation of species that are opportunistic, such as pests and weeds. Novel species may also emerge; in particular taxa that prosper in human-dominated ecosystems may rapidly diversify into many new species. Microbes are likely to benefit from the increase in nutrient-enriched environmental niches. No new species of existing large vertebrates are likely to arise and food chains will probably be shortened.|$|E
5|$|The {{members of}} 2 Live Crew responded to these efforts by suing the Broward County sheriff in federal {{district}} court. The sheriff had previously told local retailers that selling the album <b>could</b> <b>result</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> prosecution for obscenity violations. While they were granted an injunction because law enforcement actions were an unconstitutional prior restraint on free speech, {{the court ruled}} that the album was in fact obscene. However, an appellate court reversed the obscenity ruling, because simply playing the tape was insufficient evidence of the constitutional requirement that it had no artistic value.|$|E

5|$|The HTC One is {{equipped}} with a 4.0-megapixel rear-facing camera module that contains a custom image sensor marketed as UltraPixel, which is composed of pixels that are 2.0µm in size. Most high-end smartphones {{at the time of its}} release used 8- or 13-megapixel cameras with pixel sizes ranging from 1.4 to 1.0µm, both of which are considerably smaller in size than the pixels found in the One’s UltraPixel sensor. Although these smaller pixel sizes were typically necessary to ensure that the camera sensor did not compromise the design of the phone, there were concerns that this <b>could</b> <b>result</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> loss of dynamic range and sensitivity, and also result in poor performance in low-light environments. As such, HTC stated that its camera design with larger sensor pixels could notably increase overall image quality, especially in low-light environments. The camera also includes optical image stabilization, and is further enhanced by improvements to the Sense camera software and the ImageChip 2 image processor.|$|E
5|$|Unknown biotoxins, pathogens, and the {{impairment}} of feather waterproofing {{can lead to}} hypothermia and avian cholera. Since this grebe usually winters on the coast, it is also vulnerable to oil pollution. Large-scaled deaths (such as 150,000 birds on the Salton Sea in 1992) from erysipelas, avian cholera and avian botulism have been recorded {{in the past and}} could threaten the species. These and other factors, such as human disturbance, including collisions with power transmission lines, contribute to declining populations in certain areas. This species used to be threatened in North America by the millinery industry, which helped facilitate the hunting of the birds, and egg collectors. Although this is true, this grebe is hunted in the Gilan Province in Iran, for both commercial and recreational purposes. However, there is no evidence suggesting that these threats <b>could</b> <b>result</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> significant risk for the overall population.|$|E
5|$|At the 1886 general election, Samuel Allsopp {{held his}} seat in {{parliament}} unopposed for the Conservative Party. In April 1887, his father, Henry Allsopp, 1st Baron Hindlip, died. As a result of this, Samuel Allsopp succeeded, entering the House of Lords as a peer. This left the parliamentary consistency of Taunton vacant. The Conservative Party offered Samuel Allsopp's brother, Alfred Percy Allsopp (commonly known as Percy Allsopp) the chance to contest the vacancy. Initially {{it was reported that}} the Liberal Party would not contest the seat if Percy Allsopp was the only Conservative candidate, but a meeting of the local executive could not reach a consensus: some believed that as the area was so strongly Conservative, a large loss would be damaging to the party, while others wanted to generate a debate on Home Rule. Despite the Taunton executive of the Conservative Party selecting Percy Allsopp as their preferred candidate, the town's Mayor, Samuel Farrant, declared that he would also stand for the Conservatives, which led to concern within that party that a split of the votes <b>could</b> <b>result</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> Liberal candidate being elected. Farrant later withdrew his candidacy, leaving Allsopp as the Conservative's sole representative. After their initial uncertainty, the Liberals opted to give the Taunton electorate the opportunity to show their views on Home Rule, and chose James Harris Sanders, of London, as their candidate.|$|E

5|$|In 2009, a {{newly elected}} {{government}} in Greece revealed the falsification of its national budget data, {{and that its}} fiscal deficit for the year was 12.7% of GDP {{as opposed to the}} 3.7% espoused by the previous administration. This news alerted markets to the fact that Greece's deficit exceeded the eurozone's maximum of 3% outlined in the Economic and Monetary Union's Stability and Growth Pact. Investors concerned about a possible sovereign default rapidly sold Greek bonds. Given Greece's prior decision to embrace the euro as its currency, it no longer held monetary policy autonomy and could not intervene to depreciate a national currency to absorb the shock and boost competitiveness, as was the traditional solution to sudden capital flight. The crisis proved contagious when it spread to Portugal, Italy, and Spain (together with Greece these are collectively referred to as the PIGS). Ratings agencies downgraded these countries' debt instruments in 2010 which further increased the costliness of refinancing or repaying their national debts. The crisis continued to spread and soon grew into a European sovereign debt crisis which threatened economic recovery {{in the wake of the}} Great Recession. In tandem with the IMF, the European Union members assembled a €750 billion bailout for Greece and other afflicted nations. Additionally, the ECB pledged to purchase bonds from troubled eurozone nations in an effort to mitigate the risk of a banking system panic. The crisis is recognized by economists as highlighting the depth of financial integration in Europe, contrasted with the lack of fiscal integration and political unification necessary to prevent or decisively respond to crises. During the initial waves of the crisis, the public speculated that the turmoil <b>could</b> <b>result</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> disintegration of the eurozone and an abandonment of the euro. German Federal Minister of Finance Wolfgang Schäuble called for the expulsion of offending countries from the eurozone. Now commonly referred to as the Eurozone crisis, it has been ongoing since 2009 and most recently began encompassing the 2012–13 Cypriot financial crisis.|$|E
