40|$|Abstract—In this paper, a loading {{technique}} for improving pulse radiation from bow-tie antennas is introduced. This technique al-lows transmission of short transient pulses with very small late-time ringing and relatively high radiation efficiency. It {{makes use of}} a combination of a constant resistive loading along the antenna and a <b>capacitive</b> <b>loading</b> with linearly increasing reactance toward the antenna ends. The constant resistive loading is applied using volumetric microwave absorbers to cover one side of the antenna and the linear <b>capacitive</b> <b>loading</b> is realized by constructing narrow slots on the antenna surface. Relatively high radiation efficiency is achieved by choosing the location of the slot nearest to the feed point {{in such a way that}} radiation from it combines constructively with radiation from the feed point. Using a 0. 8 -ns monocycle for ex-citation, the technique results in a level of late-time ringing of lower than 40 dB and at the same time the peak value of the transmitted pulse is 54 % higher than that of the same antenna without loading.
