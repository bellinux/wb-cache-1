40|$|Charges {{for parking}} in the {{countryside}} pose a particular dilemma in Scotland as they are seen by many outdoor groups as a backdoor approach to restricting the public's newly acquired right of responsible access to the countryside. The issue is particularly sensitive {{in the case of}} the Cairngorms National Park (CNP) where charging has spread to a number of key car parks across the area. Based on the results of a survey of over 300 visitors this paper investigates visitors' attitudes and perceptions towards car park charging in the CNP, and explores the conditions under which they would find charging legitimate; in particular, the notion <b>of</b> <b>hypothecation</b> (i. e. the practice of declaring where and how monies contributed will be spent). We find that the vast majority of visitors surveyed are supportive of charging but that support is conditional on: the nature of the charging system, the type of location in question, and the landowners' commitment to hypothecating user fees for reinvestment in visitor facilities and preservation of the environment. We conclude by proposing a CNP-wide charging policy, fundamentally based on the principle <b>of</b> <b>hypothecation...</b>|$|R

5000|$|Hypothec ( [...] or 16th century, from Fr. hypothèque, from Lat. hypotheca, from Gk. : hypothēkē), {{sometimes}} tacit hypothec, is a {{term used}} in mixed legal systems (e.g. Scots law, South African law, Ukrainian law (Іпотека)) to refer to an express or implied non-possessory real security over corporeal movable property. This real right in security operates by way <b>of</b> <b>hypothecation,</b> often arises by operation of law (generally statute), and gives a creditor a preferential right to have claims paid out of the hypothecated property as last recourse when the debtor is in default. At common law it is equivalent to an American non-possessory lien or English legal charge.|$|R
50|$|The {{main purpose}} <b>of</b> <b>hypothecation</b> is to {{mitigate}} the creditor's credit risk. If the debtor cannot pay, the creditor possesses the collateral and therefore can claim its ownership, sell it and thus compensate the lacking cash inflows. In a default of the obligor without previous hypothecation, the creditor cannot be sure that it can seize sufficient assets of the debtor. Because hypothecation {{makes it easier to}} get the debt and potentially decreases its price; the debtor wants to hypothecate as much debt as possible - but the isolation of 'good assets' for the collateral worsens the quality {{of the rest of the}} debtor's balance sheet and thus its credit quality.|$|R
