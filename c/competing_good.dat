50|$|The problem {{continues}} to bedevil efforts by antitrust agencies to define markets. Defining markets by cross-elasticity of demand requires a reference price: If I raise my price by 5% from some base level, will people {{switch to a}} <b>competing</b> <b>good?</b> The problem is that a firm that actually does have a monopoly power still faces constraints {{on its ability to}} charge whatever price it wants; those constraints are set by consumers’ willingness to pay. If a monopolist already charges the profit-maximizing price, an increase above that price will cause consumers to stop buying the product; that’s why the lower price was already profit-maximizing. So we can’t just use the price a company already charges as the base level, or we will conclude that even monopolists lack market power.|$|E

40|$|Smart {{polymers}} are {{a modern}} class of polymeric materials that often exhibit unpredictable behavior in mixtures of solvents. One such phenomenon is co-non-solvency. Co-non-solvency occurs when two (perfectly) miscible and <b>competing</b> <b>good</b> solvents, {{for a given}} polymer, are mixed together. As a result, the same polymer collapses into a compact globule within intermediate mixing ratios. More interestingly, polymer collapses when the solvent quality remains good and even gets increasingly better {{by the addition of}} the better cosolvent. This is a puzzling phenomenon that is driven by strong local concentration fluctuations. Because of the discrete particle based nature of the interactions, Flory-Huggins type mean field arguments become unsuitable. In this work, we extend the analysis of the co-non-solvency effect presented earlier [Nature Communications 5, 4882 (2014) ]. We explain why co-non-solvency is a generic phenomenon that can be understood by the thermodynamic treatment of the competitive displacement of (co) solvent components. This competition can result in a polymer collapse upon improvement of the solvent quality. Specific chemical details are not required to understand these complex conformational transitions. Therefore, a broad range of polymers are expected to exhibit similar reentrant coil-globule-coil transitions in <b>competing</b> <b>good</b> solvents...|$|E

40|$|It is {{well known}} that poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAm) {{exhibits}} an interesting, yet puzzling, phenomenon of co-non-solvency. Co-non-solvency occurs when two <b>competing</b> <b>good</b> solvents for PNIPAm, such as water and alcohol, are mixed together. As a result, the same PNIPAm collapses within intermediate mixing ratios. This complex conformational transition is driven by preferential binding of methanol with PNIPAm. Interestingly, co-non-solvency can be destroyed when applying high hydrostatic pressures. In this work, using a large scale molecular dynamics simulation employing high pressures, we propose a microscopic picture behind the suppression of the co-non-solvency phenomenon. Based on thermodynamic and structural analysis, our results suggest that the preferential binding of methanol with PNIPAm gets partially lost at high pressures, making the background fluid reasonably homogeneous for the polymer. This is consistent with the hypothesis that the co-non-solvency phenomenon is driven by preferential binding and is not based on depletion effects...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis paper {{builds up}} a two-firm, two-product model, {{in order to}} analyze the effects of {{bundling}} on the competitor's profit, consumer surplus, and social welfare, when the bundler is a high- or low-quality firm. There are firms A and B as well as independent products 1 and 2 in the market. Product 1 as the monopoly good is produced only by firm A, while vertically differentiated products 2 as the competing goods are produced by both firms A and B. The findings of this paper are as follows: When the bundling firm produces the high-quality competing product, bundling will reduce the consumer surplus while may increase the competitor's profit and social welfare. On the contrary, when the bundling firm produces the low- quality <b>competing</b> <b>good,</b> then bundling has a foreclosure effect, making the market structure turn from a duopoly to a monopoly, hence decreasing the competitor's profit, consumer surplus, and social welfare...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to formalize the notion of general trading costs in pure theory of {{international}} trade. We start from the basic Heckscher-Ohlin-Samuelson(HOS) model of trade and explicitly bring in a trading sector which processes trading or transaction in the economy. The trading cost is modeled as the typical iceberg type of cost whereby a fraction of the value of output to be transacted is lost in the process if there are no traders in the system. We highlight the total value of trade that is transacted in an economy which, by definition, must include total value of production in exportables and demand for the import <b>competing</b> <b>good.</b> Resources are needed to carry out trading and the lost value of trade goes towards compensating the traders. The general equilibrium approach we adopt identifies traders with potential workers and therefore in equilibrium with perfect intersectoral labor mobility, trading remuneration must coincide with the wage. The economy then divided into two segments, one where production takes place by using capital and labor a la the standard 2 x 2 model and the other where trading takes place by using labor alone. Such a system is related to the hybrid structure accommodating the HOS and the specific-factor model as analyzed in earlier works b...|$|E

40|$|Embodied in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights is the evocative {{proposition}} that [e]veryone {{has the right}} to freedom of opinion and expression. But beneath that level of abstraction there is anything but universal agreement. Modern democratic societies disagree on the text, content, theory, and practice of this liberty. They disagree on whether it is a privileged right or a subordinate value. They disagree on what constitutes speech and which speech is worthy of protection. They disagree on theoretical foundations, uncertain if the right is grounded in libertarian impulses, the promotion of a marketplace of ideas, or the advancement of participatory democracy. In short, the freedom of expression is a universal value that is fraught with cultural contingencies. There are various responses to this ideological pluralism. One response is to seek normative uniformity. That approach represents the unusual circumstance in which almost all countries have balanced competing interests and uniformly concluded that a particular government practice need not be pursued. Far more common is the situation - evident in the free speech context - in which one human right is balanced against other <b>competing</b> <b>goods</b> on a country-by-country basis. The precise balance achieved in each country will differ. This book review argues that the dissonance between countries need not be challenged in pursuit of uniformity. Indeed, in those cases in which the differences reflect an appropriate balance of <b>competing</b> <b>goods,</b> it should be celebrated. Constitutional exceptionalism recognizes and celebrates each country 2 ̆ 7 s attempt to optimize the general welfare of that country by balancing <b>competing</b> <b>goods</b> {{in a manner consistent with}} that country 2 ̆ 7 s constitutional text, structure, history, precedent, and national experience. The point of constitutional exceptionalism is not to deny the existence or importance of any particular right. Rather, it is to accept the legitimacy of each modern democracy 2 ̆ 7 s attempt in its constitutional order to balance competing rights and interests as an expression of their cultural and national identity. Ronald Krotozynski counts himself among the proponents of weak transjudicial dialogue who celebrates this free speech pluralism. His recent book, The First Amendment in Cross-Cultural Perspective, offers a useful guide to the comparative experiences of five modern democracies (United States, Canada, Japan, Germany, and the United Kingdom). He outlines the free speech guarantees of each country in light of text, structure, history, precedent, and national experience. He emphasizes how each factor is critical in understanding the free speech guarantees of that country. This book review essay also considers the difficulties of a truly comprehensive free speech analysis. The essay argues that comparative constitutional analysis suffers from the curse of dimensionality. A comparison of one speech variant (i. e., hate speech) in a few countries using one contextual factor (i. e., precedent) is easy. A comparison of multiple speech variants in numerous countries using several contextual factors is exceedingly difficult. But only comparisons undertaken in such high dimensional space can reveal whether or not there are free speech clusters and outliers as is often asserted. This curse of dimensionality raises serious questions about the feasibility of comparative constitutional analysis. The essay does not question Krotozynski 2 ̆ 7 s serious and scholarly attempt at a narrow and deep comparison of free speech guarantees in five modern democracies. But it does cast doubt on the narrow and shallow comparisons that are often undertaken by constitutional jurists...|$|R
40|$|In {{the present}} paper we provide {{sufficient}} conditions for existence of competitive equilibrium with NE and indivisibilities combined. The key conditions are {{a large number of}} consumers and dispersion in their income distribution. A Network Exter-nality arises when the satisfaction that a consumer obtains from the consumption of a given good depends (usually positively) on the number of consumers that consume the same good. A common feature of markets where NE are present is the phenomenon called “tipping”, which is the tendency of one of the <b>competing</b> <b>goods</b> or protocols to win a substantial share of the market. We argue that for tipping to occur there must be an underlying indivisibility in the consumption space. In addition to the problems for existence of equilibrium posed by externalities, indivisibilities create discontinuous demand behavior (not merely a nonconvexity). ∗I am deeply indebted to Ross Starr for many helpful discussions and to Roger Gordon, Robert Lieli and Joel Sobel for useful comments.
