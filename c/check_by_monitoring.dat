The study area covers 2450 km 2 in western Tuscany (Province of Pisa, Italy). This region {{is characterized by a}} typical Mediterranean climate and is subject to fire damage during the dry summer season. Damage is mitigated where a natural rapid regrowth of vegetation prevents soil erosion, supporting the return to a natural pre-fire state. The Vegetation Resilience After Fire (VRAF) index is based on the vegetation association, soil type and geology, and on morphological features such as slope and aspect. The results are proposed as georeferenced maps defining areas with different vegetation resilience for both high and medium burn severity. The VRAF maps estimate the natural ability of vegetation to recover after fire, and suggest where human intervention is required to improve this capability. The VRAF index was <b>checked</b> <b>by</b> <b>monitoring</b> vegetation regrowth after fire in three burnt areas over a five-year period using spectral signatures, the feature space and the NDVI derived from remote sensing data.

Ten of the 384 assayed flowering ashes (Fraxinus ornus) showed symptoms on branches and apical stems, similar to those observed for European ash. Isolation and molecular analysis proved the presence of the fungus on both symptomatic European and flowering ashes.

40|$|Abstract. Activation and {{deactivation}} by inelastic collisions {{have been}} extensively studied at unimolecular reactions in gas phase {{where they are}} crucial for equilibration. As equilibration means an increase of entropy, the mechanism {{can also be considered}} responsible for entropy production. The numerous results of theoretical treatments show a remarkable agreement with experimental data. Analysis of the statistical physicochemical argumentation reveals the stochasticity of quantum transitions as the essential assumption. Under this premise, master equations have been used that are known to deliver equilibria and entropy production. Here we examine the hypothesis that the ubiquitous inelastic interactions in gas and liquid phase may represent a source of entropy beyond chemical reactions, rotational activation/deac-tivation being the prevailing mechanism in gas dynamics at room temperature. For a quantum mechanical two-state model the master equations are formulated which yield entropy produc-tion and equilibration in translational degrees of freedom until, at conserved energy, a station-ary Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution is reached. The relaxation rates show features that can be <b>checked</b> <b>by</b> <b>monitoring</b> thermal relaxation in gas phase. Depending on the composition, first or second order processes are predicted. The temperature dependence of relaxation rates is determined by the activation energy of the dominating quantum transition.

The Moon shadow is an important tool to determine the performance of an air shower array. Indeed, the westward displacement of the shadow center, due to the bending effect of the geomagnetic field on the propagation of cosmic rays, allows {{the setting of the}} absolute rigidity scale of the primary particles inducing the showers recorded by the detector. In addition, the shape of the shadow permits to determine the detector point spread function, while the position of the deficit at high energies allows the evaluation of its absolute pointing accuracy. In this paper we present the observation of the cosmic ray Moon shadowing effect carried out by the ARGO-YBJ experiment in the multi-TeV energy region with high statistical significance (55 standard deviations). By means of an accurate Monte Carlo simulation of the cosmic rays propagation in the Earth-Moon system, we have studied separately the effect of the geomagnetic field and of the detector point spread function on the observed shadow. The angular resolution {{as a function of the}} particle multiplicity and the pointing accuracy have been obtained. The primary energy of detected showers has been estimated by measuring the westward displacement as a function of the particle multiplicity, thus calibrating the relation between shower size and cosmic ray energy.

Our tool performs monitoring of web service applications, and, when violations are discovered, we automatically propose and rank recovery plans which users can then select for execution. Properties, specified using property patterns, are transformed into finitestate automata. Finite execution traces of web services described in BPEL are checked for conformance at runtime. For some property violations, recovery plans essentially involve“going back” – compensating the executed actions until an alternative behaviour of the application is possible. For other violations, recovery plans include both “going back” and “re-planning ” – guiding the application towards a desired behaviour.

40|$|This thesis {{research}} {{focused on}} biological applications of ultra-thin weak polyelectrolyte multilayers with specific emphasis on cell patterning, drug delivery, and antibacterial coatings. All {{of these very}} different applications were studied using three different polymers - polyacrylic acid (PAA), poly(allylamine hydrochloride) (PAH), polyacrylamide (PAAm). The {{first part of this}} thesis focuses on patterning polyelectrolyte multilayers found to resist mammalian cell adhesion, with ligands that promote specific interactions for adhesion. It was found that by patterning PAH on polyelectrolyte multilayers, the patterned functional group density and thickness could be tuned through ink pH adjustment. By changing the surface density of amine groups in the PAH patterns, the ligand density could also be altered using specific chemistry to attach peptides containing the tri-peptide sequence, RGD, which is known to promote cell adhesion in a number of cell types. The RGD density in the patterned regions determined the number of cells attached and the amount of cytoskeletal protein organization. The second part is an evaluation of porous polyelectrolyte multilayers as a delivery system for controlled release of small molecule drugs. The loading and releasing properties of porous PAH/PAA multilayers were investigated using the two drugs, ketoprofen and cytochalasin D. It was determined that the amount of drug released was proportional to the number of porous layers. Nanoporous films showed zero-order release, whereas microporous films displayed Fickian diffusion. The efficacy of the released drugs was <b>checked</b> <b>by</b> <b>monitoring</b> the effect of released cytochalasin D on fibroblasts' division. (cont.) In the final part of this thesis, the antibacterial properties of both silver-loaded polyelectrolyte multilayers and superhydrophobic multilayers are examined.

Superhydrophobic films showed excellent anti-fouling properties for proteins, mammalian cells, and bacteria. by Michael C. Berg. Thesis (Ph. D.)

Data collection in this study was to be carried out by the practical use of non-invasive methods (polymerase chain reaction for DNA extraction and enzyme immunoassays), using faecal samples for analysis. The first method, polymerase chain reaction, was used for sex determination in juveniles, because of their coat colour and visual similarity of secondary sex characteristic in both sexes; {{it is not possible to}} determinate sex without handling the animal. Another main purpose of this study is to try and answer the hypothesis regarding the ovarian cycle of females, factors influencing their hormone concentration and also the onset of sexual maturity in females and the timing of their fur colour change.

Physical {{incorporation of the}} major zinc binding protein into the proteoliposomes was <b>checked</b> <b>by</b> SDS–PAGE, which showed a single band on silver staining. The structural integrity of the proteoliposomes was assessed by phase contrast microscopy, which revealed the proteoliposomes as globular structures and intact boundaries. Further structural integrity/leakiness of the proteoliposomes was <b>checked</b> <b>by</b> <b>monitoring</b> efflux of Zn 2 + from the pre-loaded proteoliposomes {{in the presence of}} either 2 mM Ca 2 + or Cd 2 + or Zn 2 +. It was observed that even after 2 h of the initiation of efflux, 85 – 95 % of Zn 2 + was retained in the proteoliposomes, thereby indicating that proteoliposomes were not leaky and maintained structural integrity during the uptake study. Zinc uptake into the proteoliposomes followed Michaelis–Menten kinetics with affinity constant (Km) of 1. 03 mM and maximal velocity (Vmax) of 1333 nmol/mg protein per min. The uptake process followed first-order kinetics with a rate constant (k) of 1. 09 × 10 − 3 s− 1. The specificity of zinc transport system was determined by studying the interaction of divalent cations viz. Ca 2 + and Cd 2 + with the zinc uptake. It was observed that Cd 2 + competitively inhibited the zinc uptake process with inhibitory concentration (Ki) of 2. 9 mM. Kinetic analysis of inhibitory effect of Cd 2 + on zinc uptake revealed an increase in Km to 1. 74 mM without influencing Vmax. Zn 2 + uptake into the proteoliposomes was found to be temperature sensitive and Arrhenius plot showed a breakpoint at 27 °C. The apparent energies of activation (Ea) were found to be 7. 09 and 2. 74 kcal/mol below and above the breakpoint, respectively. The initial velocity of Zn 2 + uptake increased with the increase in outwardly directed proton gradient ([H]i greater than [H]o). The Zn 2 + uptake was inhibited by DCCD, thereby suggesting the involvement of –COOH groups in the translocation of Zn 2 + across the lipid bilayer. The ratio of acidic to basic amino acids (1. 26) strongly indicates that it is an acidic protein. The cysteine content in this protein was insignificant, which further corroborates the possibility that the acidic amino acids might be prominent candidates for binding to zinc. The findings of the present study confirms that 40 kDa major zinc binding glycoprotein purified from renal BBM is a zinc transporter involved in the influx of Zn 2 + into the epithelial cells of the renal tubular system...|$|R

Failure or anomaly’s behaviour which is not <b>checked</b> for <b>by</b> the <b>monitoring</b> scripts will go undetected. This impacts the failure recovery method as only simple failures which have been anticipated as potential failure can be detected. Unexpected failures which do not have scripts to detect them and failures that are not solved by swapping out VMs cannot be detected or recovered from. cloudinit.d is however notable as {{being one of the}} few monitoring tools which integrates into a deployment and management tool {{and is one of the}} few tools which include a failure recovery mechanism.|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of silent road surfaces demands {{a detailed analysis}} of the tire/road interaction mechanisms basically determining the noise radiation of flowing traffic. Such an analysis is of significant importance to identify and characterize the relevant effects which affect the acoustic properties of the pavements. This paper reviews the approaches pursued within the interdisciplinary research project "Quiet Road Traffic 3 " including an adequate expansion of the SPERoN model for the quantitative prediction of the tire/road noise. A variety of novel materials and road constructions is investigated to validate the model, to design optimized pavements, and to explore their application potential. The practical use of the results will be finally <b>checked</b> <b>by</b> implementing and <b>monitoring</b> test tracks. The research activities cover asphalt as well as concrete construction techniques and focus in particular on measures to reduce the noise nuisance in agglomerations. In total, the approaches within the project "Quiet Road Traffic 3 " are intended to lower the road traffic noise level by 4 to 6 dB(A) as compared to {{the current state of the}} art...|$|R

By introducing the runtime synchronization, GSN {{can be regarded as}} a program where its validity is <b>checked</b> <b>by</b> applying runtime contexts. In this fast abstract, we introduce Assure-It, a novel tool that enforces administration scripts with assurance cases guidance and runtime synchronization...|$|R
40|$|Assessing the {{composition}} of an area's bat fauna is typically accomplished by using captures or <b>by</b> <b>monitoring</b> echolocation calls with bat detectors. The two methods may not provide the same data regarding species composition. Mist nets and harp traps may be biased towards sampling low flying species, and bat detectors biased towards detecting high intensity echolocators. A comparison of the bat fauna of Fazenda Intervales, southeastern Brazil, as revealed by mist nets and harp trap captures, <b>checking</b> roosts and <b>by</b> <b>monitoring</b> echolocation calls of flying bats illustrates this point. A total of 17 species of bats was sampled. Fourteen bat species were captured and the echolocation calls of 12 species were recorded, three of them not revealed by mist nets or harp traps. The different sampling methods provided different pictures of the bat fauna. Phyllostomid bats dominated the catches in mist nets, but in the field their echolocation calls were never detected. No single sampling approach provided a complete assessment of the bat fauna in the study area. In general, bats producing low intensity echolocation calls, such as phyllostomids, are more easily assessed by netting, and bats producing high intensity echolocation calls are better surveyed by bat detectors. The results demonstrate that a combined and varied approach to sampling is required for a complete assessment of the bat fauna of an area...|$|R
