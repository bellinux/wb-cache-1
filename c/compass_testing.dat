At a rural community college in the southeastern United States, students who tested into developmental education courses have struggled more with persistence and completion than have their college-ready counterparts. The purpose of this causal-comparative study was to evaluate the influence that student coaching had on student success in developmental math at this community college. Tinto 2 ̆ 7 s dropout theory and Astin 2 ̆ 7 s engagement theory provided the theoretical framework for a study of 62 developmental math students who were offered student coaching services during the course. Multiple one-way ANOVAs were performed to determine if student coaching had any influence on the dependent <b>COMPASS</b> <b>test</b> scores based on students 2 ̆ 7 level of participation with the service.

40|$|Introduction. The {{goal of this}} {{systematic}} review and meta-analysis was to identify the best screening tools for fitness-to-drive after stroke. Methods. Eleven electronic databases, 5 abstract databases and 4 current trials registries were searched, from inception of database until May 1, 2010. The search identified 3264 citations. Original studies were scanned in duplicate for eligibility. The fitness-to-drive outcome was a pass – fail decision on an on-road test. Methodological quality was assessed by Newcastle-Ottawa scores. Weighted mean effect sizes (Dw) of determinants were calculated using fixed-effects models. Statistical heterogeneity was estimated with the I² statistic. Random-effects models were performed when the assumption of homogeneity was not met. Cut-off scores of valid determinants were determined via receiver operating characteristic curves (ROC). Results. Thirty studies {{were included in the}} {{systematic review}} and 27 in the meta-analysis. Out of 1728 stroke patients, 938 (54 %) passed the on-road evaluation. The most valid determinants were road sign recognition test (Dw, 1. 22; 95 % Confidence Interval [CI], 1. 01 - 1. 44; I², 72 %), <b>compass</b> <b>test</b> (Dw, 1. 06; 95 % CI, 0. 74 - 1. 39; I², 82 %), and Trail Making Test, part B (TMT B; Dw, 0. 81; 95 % CI, 0. 48 - 1. 15; I², 0 %). Cut-off values of 8. 5 points for road sign recognition, 25 points for compass, and 90 seconds for TMT B were identified to correctly classify unsafe drivers with an accuracy of 84 %, 85 % and 80 %, respectively. Conclusion.

LRO ACS sensors were carefully installed, tested, and maintained over the 18 month I&T and prelaunch timeline. Care was taken with the optics of the Adcole Coarse Sun Sensors (CSS) to ensure their critical role in the Safe Hold mode was fulfilled. The use of new CSS stimulators provided the means of testing each CSS sensor independently, in ambient and vacuum conditions as well as over a wide range of thermal temperatures. Extreme bright light sources were also used to test the CSS in ambient conditions. The integration of the two SELEX Galileo Star Trackers was carefully planned and executed.

40|$|Many recent {{high school}} {{graduates}} remain inadequately prepared for college and are required to enroll in remedial or developmental education courses in mathematics or English upon enrollment in college. High rates of college remediation are associated with lower progression and college completion rates. To address this problem, some states, districts, and individual high schools have introduced “transition courses” {{to prepare students for}} college-level math and English coursework. Transition courses are typically offered to high school seniors who have been assessed as being underprepared for college math or English. This study uses a regression discontinuity design to estimate the effect of participation in a mathematics transition course on college-level math outcomes in West Virginia for the 2011 – 12 and 2012 – 13 high school senior cohorts. Our findings suggest that, among students who scored very close to the cutoff score on an assessment used to decide what students took the course, the math transition course had no statistically significant effect on improving college readiness (as measured by exemption from remedial education upon college entry due to a passing score on a placement test) and in fact had a negative impact on students’ likelihood of passing a college gatekeeper math course. Possible explanations for these outcomes include that (1) the transition course may have displaced traditional senior-year courses that were in practice more rigorous than the transition course or that provided positive impacts from inclusion of higher performing peers, and that (2) the transition course curricula may not have been well aligned to the skills required for success on the <b>COMPASS</b> placement <b>test.</b> Most students who took the transition course did not pass the COMPASS, which was taken {{at the conclusion of the}} course.

40|$|This paper uses student-level {{data from}} a statewide {{community}} college system to examine the validity of placement tests and high school information in predicting course grades and college performance. It considers the ACCUPLACER and <b>COMPASS</b> placement <b>tests,</b> using two quantitative and two literacy tests from each battery. The authors find that placement tests do not yield strong predictions of how students will perform in college. Placement test scores are positively—but weakly—associated with college grade point average (GPA). The correlation disappears when high school GPA is controlled for. Placement test scores are positively associated with college credit accumulation even after controlling for high school GPA. After three to five semesters, a student with a placement test score in the highest quartile has on average nine credits more than a student with a placement test score in the lowest quartile. In contrast, high school GPAs are useful for predicting many aspects of students' college performance. High school GPA has a strong association with college GPA; students' college GPAs are approximately 0. 6 units below their high school GPAs. High school GPA also has a strong association with college credit accumulation. A student whose high school GPA is one grade higher will have accumulate approximately four extra credits per semester. Other information from high school transcripts is modestly useful; this includes number of math and English courses taken in high school, honors courses, number of F grades, and number of credits. This high school information is not independently useful beyond high school GPA, and collectively it explains less variation in college performance. The authors also calculate accuracy rates and four validity metrics for placement tests. They find high "severe" error rates using the placement test cutoffs. The severe error rate for English is 27 to 33 percent; i. e., three out of every ten students is severely misassigned. For math, the severe error rates are lower but still nontrivial. Using high school GPA instead of placement tests reduces the severe error rates by half across both English and math...|$|R

40|$|A {{fiber optic}} system for {{measuring}} magnetic heading and pitch {{of one or}} more compass heads in a towed acoustic array has been developed as a cooperative effort between engineers at Fiber Dynamics, Inc., and faculty and graduate students at Texas A&M. An unconventional photolithographic process for producing a bar-code pattern on a curved (spherical) surface was successfully implemented. First, an absorption process for applying a thin layer of photoresist uniformly to the gold-coated surface of a glass sphere was perfected. Then, a system for defining the patterns in the metal was assembled. A LabView computer program controlled the system as required to define the bar code pattern in the metal. High-quality bar code patterns were produced on floating spheres by this method. The data acquisition/signal processing system digitized and processed the raw data returning from the compass heads, and computed magnetic heading and pitch from the data. Processing of the signal from a single compass head required readout of a 7 -bit binary code giving coarse heading, using timing information to obtain fine heading, and measuring the apparent width of an analog bar to determine pitch. When monitoring multiple compass heads distributed along the fiber, a time-division demultiplexing technique was used for separating the data from the individual <b>compass</b> heads. For <b>testing</b> the system, the cylindrical sensor head was mounted on a machinist's table for rotating it through 360 ?? in the horizontal plane to vary the heading, and through ?? 10 ?? about a horizontal axis to vary pitch.

Alternatively, birds may orient their nest entrance relative to conspecific individuals around them, especially if the acoustic properties of cavities permit nesting birds to better hear individuals {{in front of their}} nest. We measured the cavity entrance orientation of 132 nests and 234 excavations in a colour-banded population of black-capped chickadees Poecile atricapillus for which the reproductive behaviour of nesting females was known. Most chickadees excavated cavities in rotten birch Betula papyrifera, aspen Populus tremuloides and maple Acer saccharum. Nest cavities snowed random compass orientation around 360 ° demonstrating that chickadees do not orient their cavities relative to the sun or prevailing winds. We also presented chickadees with nest boxes arranged in groups of four, oriented at 90 ° intervals around the same tree. Nests constructed in these nest box quartets also showed random <b>compass</b> orientation. To <b>test</b> the acoustic properties of nest cavities, we conducted a sound transmission experiment using a microphone mounted inside a chickadee nest. Re-recorded songs demonstrate that chickadee nest cavities have directional acoustic properties; songs recorded with the cavity entrance oriented towards the loudspeaker were louder than songs recorded with the cavity entrance oriented away from the loudspeaker. Thus, female chickadees, who roost inside their nest cavity in the early morning during their fertile period, should be better able to hear males singing the dawn chorus in front of their nest cavity. Using GIS analyses we tested for angular-angular correlation between actual nest cavity orientation and the azimuth from the nest tree to the territories and nest cavities of nearby males. In general, nest cavity entrances showed no angular-angular correlation with neighbourhood territory features. However, among birds who followed a mixed reproductive strategy and nested in the soft wood of birch and aspen trees, nest cavity entrances were oriented towards their extra-pair partners. We conclude that nest cavity orientation in birds may be influenced by both ecological and social factors...|$|R
40|$|Migratory birds use {{multiple}} {{compass systems}} for orientation, including a magnetic, star and sun/polarized light compass. To keep these compasses in register, birds have to regularly update them {{with respect to}} a common reference. However, cue-conflict studies have revealed contradictory results on the compass hierarchy, favoring either celestial or magnetic compass cues as the primary calibration reference. Both the geomagnetic field and polarized light cues present at sunrise and sunset have been shown {{to play a role in}} compass cue integration, and evidence suggests that polarized light cues at sunrise and sunset may provide the primary calibration reference for the other <b>compass</b> systems. We <b>tested</b> whether migratory garden warblers recalibrated their compasses when they were exposed to the natural celestial cues at sunset in a shifted magnetic field, which are conditions that have been shown to be necessary for the use of a compass reference based on polarized light cues. We released the birds on the same evening under a starry sky and followed them by radio tracking. We found no evidence of compass recalibration, even though the birds had a full view of polarized light cues near the horizon at sunset during the cue-conflict exposure. Based on a meta-analysis of the available literature, we propose an extended unifying theory on compass cue hierarchy used by migratory birds to calibrate the different compasses. According to this scheme, birds recalibrate their magnetic compass by sunrise/sunset polarized light cues, provided they have access to the vertically aligned band of maximum polarization near the horizon and a view of landmarks. If polarized light information is not available near the horizon at sunrise or sunset, the birds temporarily transfer the previously calibrated magnetic compass information to the available celestial compasses. Once the stars appear in the sky, the birds then recalibrate the star compass with respect of the recalibrated magnetic compass. If sunrise and sunset information can be viewed from the same location, the birds average the information to get a true geographic reference. We conclude that the type of cue-conflict manipulation and the availability of stars can explain the discrepancies between studies...|$|R

This suggests that domestic chickens may use the sun as a time-compensated compass, rather than as a beacon. An alternative explanation is that the birds might use the earth's magnetic field. In this study, we investigated the role of the sun compass in a spatial orientation task using a clock-shift procedure. Furthermore, we investigated whether domestic chickens use magnetic <b>compass</b> information when <b>tested</b> under sunny conditions. Ten ISA Brown chicks were housed in outdoor pens. A separate test arena comprised an open-topped, opaque-sided, wooden octagonal maze. Eight goal boxes with food pots were attached one to each of the arena sides. A barrier inside each goal box prevented the birds from seeing the food pot before entering. After habituation, we tested in five daily 5 -min trials whether chicks were able to find food in an systematically allocated goal direction. We controlled for the use of olfactory cues and intra-maze cues. No external landmarks were visible. All tests were done under sunny conditions. Circular statistics showed that nine chicks significantly oriented goalwards using the sun as the only consistent visual cue during directional testing. Next, these nine chicks were subjected to a clock-shift procedure to test for the role of sun-compass information. The chicks were housed indoors for 6 days on a light-schedule that was 6 h ahead of the natural light-dark schedule. After clock-shifting, the birds were tested again and all birds except one were disrupted in their goalward orientation. For the second experiment, six birds were re-trained and fitted with a tiny, powerful magnet on the head to disrupt their magnetic sense. The magnets did not affect the chicks' goalward orientation. In conclusion, although the strongest prediction of the sun-compass hypothesis (significant re-orientation after clock-shifting) was neither confirmed nor refuted, our results suggest that domestic chicks use the sun as a compass rather than as a beacon. These findings suggest that hens housed indoors in large non-cage systems may experience difficulties in orientation if adequate alternative cues are unavailable. Further research should elucidate how hens kept in non-cage systems orient in space in relation to available resources. © 2008 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|The {{main purpose}} of the LHC Beam Loss Monitoring (BLM) system is the active {{protection}} of the LHC accelerators' elements against the quench of superconducting magnets and the damage of equipment caused {{by the loss of}} circulating protons. The lost protons initiate a shower of secondary particles, which deposit their energy in the equipment and partly in a radiation detector. If thresholds in the BLM system are exceeded, the circulating LHC beam is directed towards a dump to stop the energy deposition in the fragile equipment. The LHC BLM system will use ionization chambers as standard detectors, and in the areas with very high dose rates Secondary Emission Monitor (SEM) chambers will be employed to increase the dynamic range. The SEM is characterized by a high linearity and accuracy, low sensitivity, fast response and a good radiation tolerance. The emission of electrons from the surface layer of metals by the passage of charged particles is only measurable in a vacuum environment. This requirement leads together with the foreseen operation of 20 years to an ultra high vacuum preparation of the components and even to an additional active pumping realized by a getter pump (NEG). The signal and bias electrodes are made of Ti to make use of its Secondary Emission Yield (SEY) stability and favorable vacuum properties. The sensitivity of the SEM was modeled in GEANT 4 via the Photo-Absorption Ionization module together with a custom parameterization for the very low energy secondary electron production using the modified Sternglass formula. The simulations were validated by comparative measurements of several prototypes with proton beams of the CERN PS Booster dump line, the SPS transfer line, the PSI Optis line and by a muon beam in the <b>COMPASS</b> beam line. <b>Tests</b> of the complete acquisition chain were performed in the LHC test collimation area of the SPS and compared to the combined Fluka and GEANT 4 simulations. The linearity and long term stability was also tested in the high energy beam dump area of the SPS. A dedicated fixed target experiment was designed in the CERN H 4 secondary beam line for testing all the 400 detectors produced in IHEP Protvino. The simulations were also used for the prediction of the signal levels expected in the LHC and for an absolute dose calibration. The comparison of simulations and measurements and of SEM and ionisation chamber measurements resulted in the relative difference range between 8 and 43 % for different setups and radiation fields...|$|R
40|$|During this Master Thesis {{work has}} been made on the Arduino robot to improve its general capabilities. Work has also been made to further explore the {{possibilities}} of the sensors used on all robots in the system. A hardware fault with the wheel armature cogs {{on the left side}} of the robot was discovered. This problem lead to the robot faultily estimating its position and be unable to drive in a straight line. This caused the robot to often drive into walls and not give reliable information about the mapping due to its corrupted position estimation. This problem was solved using a metal plate mounted on the armature to improve its stability and the tightness of each cog on the left side, so the cogs could not slip on each other. This solution completely removed the aforementioned problem and the robot now registers the correct wheel rotation. We do not expect a similar problem to occur on the right side as the work on the armature on that side is significantly better. Each sensor was searched for faults and tested for accuracy. The encoders were tested mainly by the wheel factor; the number converting encoder "ticks" to distance moved. This number was found to be adequate, however caution must be made as to the possibility of differing wheel factors depending on the surface. The surface tested on was room B 333, "Slangelabben" at NTNU. The gyroscope was tested during rotation and compared to the encoder and the real-world value using the OptiTrack reflector-camera system. The gyroscope was found to be slightly off the real value each test. It was decided to poll for mean value more frequently to remove bias on the gyroscope on a more consistent basis. This seemed to improve the rotation estimation during our final <b>tests.</b> The <b>compass</b> was also <b>tested</b> during rotation and found to be very lacking. The noise factor on the sensor proved too great to adequately filter out during rotation. Due to this, the compass values had a negative impact on the heading estimation, and was removed from the system. It is advised that more work be done to explore the possibilities of filtering the compass and use it to reset gyroscope off-set. The accelerometer was found to give valuable, but very noisy data. Attempts were made at filtering and using the data, however none proved usable enough to directly implement on the current position estimation. It was decided to not be included in the software. More work is advised as the data is valuable and could potentially be used to detect slippage of the wheels and crashes. As the old navigation algorithm was not based on coordinates, but rather on distance and heading, it was decided that a new navigation algorithm be implemented in the robot. This algorithm is based on converting the heading and distance commands the server sends into specific coordinates, then use a similar controller to minimize the distance to the target. This controller is a two-step algorithm, which first rotates to the target, then drives forward while continuously controlling the heading towards the coordinates. A lot of focus was also put on smoother movements, as we witnessed a lot of overshoot on the robot both during rotation and forward movement due to the robot's mass. This new algorithm showed much greater results than expected and has almost eliminated the navigation error. During the final testing with the other robots it was shown to work well even if it showed some expected faults. The navigation is smoother and more reliable than before, and the position estimation is adequate based on its current algorithm...|$|R
