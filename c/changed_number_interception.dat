30|$|CH <b>change</b> <b>number</b> is {{the number}} of {{vehicles}} that shift from being CH to other roles. The analysis shows that the cost of selecting CHs and modifying cluster structure is expensive [28]. Consequently, clustering algorithms must attempt to reduce the changing of CHs to decrease the reselection of CHs and the reassociation of CMs. Thus, CH <b>change</b> <b>number</b> is a significant measurable indicator.|$|R

40|$|A sign pattern (matrix) is {{a matrix}} whose entries {{are from the}} set {+, −, 0 } and a sign vector is a vector whose entries are from the set {+, −, 0 }. A sign pattern or sign vector is full {{if it does not}} contain any zero entries. The minimum rank of a sign pattern matrix A is the minimum of the ranks of the real {{matrices}} whose entries have signs equal to the corresponding entries of A. The notions of essential row sign <b>change</b> <b>number</b> and essential column sign <b>change</b> <b>number</b> are introduced for full sign patterns and condensed sign patterns. By inspecting the sign vectors realized by a list of real polynomials in one variable, a lower bound on the essential row and column sign <b>change</b> <b>numbers</b> is obtained. Using point-line confiurations on the plane, it is shown that even for full sign patterns with minimum rank 3, the essential row and column sign <b>change</b> <b>numbers</b> can differ greatly and can be much bigger than the minimum rank. Some open problems concerning square full sign patterns with large minimum ranks are discussed...|$|R

40|$|A {{perching}} bird {{is able to}} rapidly decelerate at a high angle of attack while maintaining lift and control. However, the underlying aerodynamic mechanism is poorly understood. We perform a study on a simultaneously decelerating and pitching airfoil section as a simple perching model. First, we use analytic arguments to establish the inertial non-circulatory force on a wing section, and its dependence on the shape <b>change</b> <b>number,</b> ? ??, the ratio between {{the rate of change}} of frontal dimension and the initial translational velocity. Next, we report that forces measured on a towed and pitched airfoil at Re = 22000, and forces from simulations at Re = 2000, are found to be well above non-circulatory predictions, exhibiting high lift and drag. Flow-field visualizations, both from Particle Image Velocimetry and simulations, reveal strong coherent vortical structures in the wake and near the body. At a higher shape <b>change</b> <b>number,</b> vortices in the wake convect more quickly than at a lower shape <b>change</b> <b>number,</b> generating higher drag. Additionally, separation of the LEV and positive vorticity near the body is reduced at a higher shape <b>change</b> <b>number,</b> increasing lift. Thus wake manipulation through rapid area change provides a means through which a {{perching bird}} can maintain high lift and drag simultaneously while slowing to a controlled stop...|$|R

40|$|Interstate {{highways}} {{are one of}} {{the most}} important components of the transportation infrastructure in America. Freeway ramps play an important role in the whole interstate transportation system. This paper researches the traffic flow characteristics of four typical exit ramps in USA, which are tapered one-lane exit, tapered two-lane exit, parallel one-lane exit and parallel two-lane exit. Computer simulation software, such as CORSIM and HCS are applied as the main tools in this research. ANOVA and Tukey are used for statistical purpose. It compares the maximum capacity, average running speed and the total lane <b>change</b> <b>number</b> of those four exit ramps. It is found that no matter in terms of traffic discharging rate or total lane charging number; the tapered two-lane exit has the best operational performance. Tapered one-lane exit ramp has the least capacity. Parallel one-lane exit and parallel two-lane exit have very limited traffic operational difference in terms of capacity and running speed. It is recommended that parallel two-lane exit ramp should not be designed along the freeway if the right of way along arterial road is enough. It is observed from the simulation data that the grade of freeway, truck percentage, restricted to the truck use of certain lane(s) and the location of exit sign have significant impact on the running speed and total lane <b>change</b> <b>number.</b> An uphill can decrease the running speed dramatically while more truck brings more lane change, causing safety concerns. It is found that when trucks are restricted to the right two most lane, there will be less lane <b>change</b> <b>number</b> comparing with trucks are not restricted. Location of exit sign operates well at the distance between 4000 ft to 5000 ft. does have a significant impact on the operational speed and total lane <b>change</b> <b>number</b> before, within or after functional area of an exit, based on the data analysis of simulation runs...|$|R
