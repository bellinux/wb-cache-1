5|$|Dean's other {{dream is}} a major {{turning point in the}} character's storyline, after which he starts gaining self-respect and realizes that he truly wants to live.

When they learned that Morgan was busy filming Watchmen, the writers instead found inspiration in the junkyard scene from the film Superman III, in which good and evil versions of Superman confront one another. Kripke noted, however, that the <b>conversation</b> <b>between</b> the two Deans still focuses on John.|$|E
