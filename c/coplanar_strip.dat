40|$|A {{method to}} design a low cost, small size antenna for {{operation}} within the 902 - 928 MHz frequency band is developed. As an example, a Printed Circuit Board (PCB) topology has been selected using an inexpensive FR- 4 grade board material. A single patch antenna cannot be used because the resonant frequency varies due to the process variation of the PCB material. A wider bandwidth, <b>coplanar</b> <b>strip</b> antenna is designed {{to compensate for the}} PCB material variation. The Finite Difference Time Domain (FDTD) Method is used to simulate different <b>coplanar</b> <b>strip</b> combinations. A final topology selection is based on impedance bandwidth, average return loss, radiation bandwidth, and relative gain. A three <b>coplanar</b> <b>strip</b> antenna is the selected final design. The impedance bandwidth of this antenna is 46 MHz, approximately twice the impedance bandwidth of a single patch antenna of similar dimensions. The relative gain reduction of the three <b>coplanar</b> <b>strip</b> antenna is only 2 dB with respect to the single patch antenna. Also, the simulated gain variation over the expected permittivity variation is only ± 2. 6 dB. No significant relative gain reduction is expected over the predicted loss tangent variation...|$|E

40|$|The loss in superconducting {{microwave}} resonators at low-photon {{number and}} low temperatures {{is not well}} understood but has implications for achievable coherence times in superconducting qubits. We have fabricated single-layer resonators with a high quality factor by patterning a superconducting aluminum film on a sapphire substrate. Four resonator geometries were studied with resonant frequencies ranging from 5 to 7 GHz: a quasi-lumped element resonator, a <b>coplanar</b> <b>strip</b> waveguide resonator, and two hybrid designs that contain both a <b>coplanar</b> <b>strip</b> and a quasi-lumped element. Transmitted power measurements were taken at 30 mK {{as a function of}} frequency and probe power. We find that the resonator loss, expressed as the inverse of the internal quality factor, decreases slowly over four decades of photon number in a manner not merely explained by loss from a conventional uniform spatial distribution of two-level systems in an oxide layer on the superconducting surfaces of the resonator.
