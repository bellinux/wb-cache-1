5|$|The Round Church {{featured}} {{marble and}} limestone <b>cornices.</b> These included {{a large number}} of intertwined ornaments and details, such as palmettes, grape clusters, leaves, and chamfers. Besides classic ornamental shapes, the <b>cornices</b> feature some that are entirely new in character or well-known yet redesigned motifs. Floral decoration dominates the <b>cornices.</b> Tiles found inside the church ruins depict birds and other animals in addition to geometric shapes and floral motifs, all glazed in either brown, yellow, green, blue, or blue-green. The walls were covered in polished marble facing with encrusted shapes.|$|E
5|$|Finds include Corinthian capitals, Doric friezes and {{modillion}} <b>cornices.</b> The motifs {{featured on}} the fragments found occasionally match patterns witnessed in other Second-Temple era public buildings unearthed in the region, while others reflect unique architectural characteristics. These include floral motifs, rosettes, cable patterns similar to finds in the Hauran region of southern Syria and acanthus leaves featured in Roman architecture.|$|E
5|$|Internally, {{a number}} of rooms feature period wall and ceiling decorations {{including}} the entrance hall, which dates from the original 1730s building and features moulded panelling and <b>cornices,</b> a marble fireplace and ornamental plaster ceiling and an arabesque frieze. The stairwell is lit from above with a roof light and features a cantilevered stair with iron balusters from the 1825 adaptation with a later brass handrail.|$|E
50|$|Additional more-obscure {{varieties}} of <b>cornice</b> include the architrave <b>cornice,</b> bracketed <b>cornice,</b> and modillion <b>cornice.</b>|$|R
5000|$|A <b>cornice</b> [...] (from the Italian <b>cornice</b> meaning [...] "ledge") is {{generally}} any horizontal decorative molding that crowns a building or furniture element - the <b>cornice</b> over a door or window, for instance, or the <b>cornice</b> {{around the top}} edge of a pedestal or along the top of an interior wall. A simple <b>cornice</b> may be formed just with a crown molding.|$|R
50|$|Tuscan {{columns and}} pilasters divide the hallway into a vestibule, central {{circulation}} and stair area. A common <b>cornice</b> with bead and reel molded <b>cornice</b> {{set off by}} a simple chair rail and dado paneling unites all areas. Decoration continues above the <b>cornice</b> with cyma recta moldings in egg-and-dart and Greek fret and foliated patterns below carved modillions on the <b>cornice.</b> Above the <b>cornice</b> is a triple fascia. The rooms are entered through portals with sliding doors. Each {{is surrounded by a}} shouldered architrave and topped with a projecting molded <b>cornice</b> surrounded by foliate consoles.|$|R
5|$|The {{building}} was altered in 1890, with two additions of Victorian architecture, the first being the main entrance, above the fanlight, is an arched awning with incised consoles. The other addition was the octagonal cupola {{on the roof}} over the original bell tower which dates from 1830. The exterior of the school has complementary colors. The walls are painted a cream color while the foundation, doors, window trims, and <b>cornices</b> are a chocolate-brown.|$|E
5|$|The {{entrance}} to the house is {{on the north side}} through a single storey portico. The north façade features tall sash windows on the ground and first floors of 12 panes; the second floor windows to the central section are shorter and of nine panes. moulded stucco <b>cornices</b> run above the ground and first floor windows. The east and west façades are five bays wide with a two-storey projecting bay on the east end and a single-storey projecting bay on the west end.|$|E
5|$|As of 2005, the {{building}} still retained {{a number of}} original features, including its gold brocade seats, wall friezes, <b>cornices,</b> and ceiling roses. However, the fabric of {{the building}} remained in a poor state of repair, and in January 2008 it was announced once again that the building was to be demolished, and scaffolding was erected at the front in preparation. The building, once considered amongst the most iconic in Manchester, was not regarded as architecturally interesting, and was demolished in the spring of 2008. The pair of stone piers in the forecourt of the building, which were Grade II listed in 1998, remain.|$|E
40|$|<b>Cornice</b> fall {{avalanches}} endanger {{life and}} infrastructure in Nybyen, {{a part of}} Svalbard's main settlement Longyearbyen, located at 78 ° N in the High Arctic. Thus, <b>cornice</b> dynamics – accretion, cracking and eventual failure – and their controlling meteorological factors were studied along the ridgeline of the Gruvefjellet plateau mountain above Nybyen in the period 2008 – 2010. Using two automatic time-lapse cameras and hourly meteorological data in combination with intensive field observations on the Gruvefjellet plateau, <b>cornice</b> process dynamics were investigated for larger detail than previously possible. <b>Cornice</b> accretion starts directly following the first snowfall in late September and October, and proceeds throughout the entire snow season under {{a wide range of}} air temperature conditions that the maritime winter climate of Svalbard provides. <b>Cornice</b> accretion is particularly controlled by distinct storm events, with a prevailing wind direction perpendicular to the ridge line and average wind speeds from 12 m s− 1 . Particularly high wind speeds in excess of 30 m s− 1 towards the plateau ridgeline lead to <b>cornice</b> scouring and reduce the <b>cornice</b> mass both vertically and horizontally. Induced by pronounced air temperature fluctuations, tension cracks develop between the <b>cornice</b> mass and the plateau. Our measurements indicate a linear crack opening due to snow creep and tilt of the <b>cornice</b> around a pivot point. Four to five weeks elapsed between the first observations of a <b>cornice</b> crack until <b>cornice</b> failure. Throughout the two snow seasons studied, 180 <b>cornice</b> failures were recorded, of which 70 failures were categorized as distinctive <b>cornice</b> fall avalanches. A clear temporal pattern with the majority of <b>cornice</b> failures in June was found. Thus only daily air temperature could determine avalanche from non-avalanche days. Seven large <b>cornice</b> fall avalanches reached the avalanche fans on which the Nybyen settlement is located. The size of the avalanches was primarily determined {{by the size of the}} <b>cornice</b> that detached. The improved understanding of the <b>cornice</b> dynamics process provides a first step towards a better predictability of this natural hazard...|$|R
50|$|In an open <b>cornice,</b> {{the shape}} of the <b>cornice</b> {{is similar to that of}} a wide box <b>cornice</b> except that both the lookouts and the soffit are absent. It is a lower-cost {{treatment}} that requires fewer materials, and may even have no fascia board, but lacks the finished appearance of a box <b>cornice.</b>|$|R
50|$|The term <b>cornice</b> {{may also}} be used to {{describe}} a form of hard window treatment along the top edge of a window. When used in this context, a <b>cornice</b> represents a board (usually wood) placed above the window to conceal the mechanism for opening and closing drapes. If covered in a layer of cloth and given padding, it is sometimes called a soft <b>cornice</b> rather than a hard <b>cornice.</b>|$|R
5|$|Platform A6 {{encloses}} {{the western}} extreme of the Group A plaza. The platform has two levels, the upper {{of which has}} a vertical cornice. The platform faces east onto the plaza; access was via two stairways flanked by balustrades terminating in vertical <b>cornices.</b> Platform A6 was built over an older {{version of the same}} building; this earlier construction phase was smaller and its stairways were destroyed in order to build the stairways of the final version. During restoration work carried out by archaeologists the back wall and a section of the facade were left exposed. Four funerary urns were found associated with the platform, mostly interred under the front of the building.|$|E
5|$|Platform B5 {{possesses}} two stepped {{levels with}} <b>cornices</b> and encloses {{the northern part}} of the west side of the Group B plaza. The lower level possesses a single inset stairway, while the upper terrace has two stairways flanked by balustrades, with a third balustrade dividing the two. The platform provides a broad view across the Pancaco River valley to the west. Structure B5 was built on top of an earlier construction phase, which is exposed along the upper portion of the back wall because restoration of the building only rebuilt the lower portion. It was built from stone slabs and was originally taller than the final version of the platform but was cut back to the reduced height of the new building.|$|E
5|$|Structure E4 is a {{platform}} located behind Pyramid E1 and encloses {{the eastern side}} of the Group E plaza. It faces west onto the plaza and has two access stairways, both flanked by ramps built from small slabs of stone and with <b>cornices</b> at the top. The platform walls are of fine workmanship, being built with well-cut and carefully fitted pumice. The front portion of the upper platform was paved with stone slabs, and a bench ran the entire length of the back of the platform. The clay floor between the paving and the bench was found to have been burnt. An offering was excavated from the central axis of the platform's base, it consisted of two ring-shaped clubs placed on either side of a stone ball.|$|E
6000|$|... § I. We have lastly to {{consider}} {{the close of the}} wall's existence, or its <b>cornice.</b> It was above stated, that a <b>cornice</b> has one of two offices: if the wall have nothing to carry, the <b>cornice</b> is its roof, and defends it from the weather; if there is weight to be carried above the wall, the <b>cornice</b> is its hand, and is expanded to carry the said weight.|$|R
50|$|Additional {{characters}} include Ivan Vishnevski (Philip Voss), Harold <b>Cornice</b> (Stephen Moore), Sarah <b>Cornice</b> (Jill Baker) and Jess Taylor (Daniela Denby-Ashe).|$|R
50|$|The {{elaborate}} <b>cornice</b> of {{the sanctuary}} was removed in 1990. This removal of the <b>cornice</b> still affects {{the appearance of the}} building today.|$|R
5|$|The {{building}} is {{designed in the}} Italianate style, with the specialty leanings demanded by a schoolhouse. The front facade, which faces southwest today, is adorned with three doorways—left, right, and center— which span a front porch beneath the bell tower. When the school was open, {{the use of the}} doors was restricted. The left and right doors were used by boys in first through eighth grades while the middle door was earmarked as an entry for girls of all ages. Each of the doors feature transoms topped with <b>cornices.</b>|$|E
5|$|Being one of {{the tallest}} {{buildings}} in Singapore in the early 20th century, the Great Southern Hotel was an important landmark of Chinatown. Designed by Swan and Maclaren, the architectural style of the Nam Tin Building {{was that of the}} Modern Movement. The building was designed to be strictly functional. The grey-coloured façade of the Great Southern Hotel seemed to consist only of the bare essentials, with ordinary designs like strong horizontal lines with angular arches and simple <b>cornices.</b> The building was fitted with steel frame windows, with metal railings and grills, which were considered fashionable in the 1930s. The loggia on the uppermost floor was a little lighter in colour with the use of cast iron balustrades and brackets, and there was extensive use of green glass. The building was {{one of the}} first in Singapore to be built as an integral structure of reinforced concrete slab and beam with infill brick wall.|$|E
5|$|By 1683 the College {{part of the}} {{structure}} was finished. The new building was built out of plain bricks of three storeys, with basement and attic levels in addition. The College consists of an extensive range of quadrangular buildings. Apart from the hall, a porter's lodge and a public office, {{the rest of the}} building was given over to the heralds as accommodation. To the east and south sides three terraced houses were constructed for leases, their façade in keeping with the original design. In 1699 the hall, which for some time had been used as a library, was transformed into the Earl Marshal's Court or the Court of Chivalry; it remains so to this day. In 1776 some stylistic changes were made to the exterior of the building and some details, such as pediments and <b>cornices</b> were removed, transforming the building to the then popular but austere Neo-Classical style.|$|E
25|$|Building at 127 Main Street. This more {{elaborate}} Renaissance Revival building, with brick pilasters and a metal <b>cornice</b> with intermediate <b>cornice,</b> dates to 1885.|$|R
60|$|The <b>cornice</b> is cut to pieces, {{gathered}} together, {{and becomes}} {{the capital of}} the column. Do not be alarmed at the new word, it does not mean a new thing; a capital is only the <b>cornice</b> of a column, and you may, if you like, call a <b>cornice</b> the capital of a wall.|$|R
5000|$|The {{principal}} facade {{is framed}} by soclo with stonework {{and decorated with}} <b>cornice</b> where the triangular frontispiece sits, marked by an axial doorway and two windows {{at the level of}} the high-choir. The soclo and <b>cornice</b> encircle the buildings spaces. The door, with triple lintel, has pilasters flanking the framed entranceway with pedestals and capitals. Over the capitals are corbels that frame the upper lintel and support the <b>cornice.</b> Over the <b>cornice</b> is a triangular apex flanked by pinnacles and over this a cartouche inscribed with: ...|$|R
5|$|In 1730, Vaccarini {{arrived in}} Catania as the {{appointed}} city architect and immediately impressed on the architecture the Roman Baroque style. The pilasters lose their rustication and support Roman type <b>cornices</b> and entablatures, or curved pediments, and free-standing columns support balconies. Vaccarini also exploited the local black lava stone as a decorative feature {{rather than a}} general building material, using it intermittently with other materials, and spectacularly for an obelisk supported {{on the back of}} the Catanian heraldic elephant, for a fountain in the style of Bernini in front of the new Town hall. Vaccarini's principal façade to Catania's cathedral, dedicated to Santa Agata, shows strong Spanish influences even at this late stage of Sicilian Baroque. Also in the city is Stefano Ittar's Church of the Collegiata, built around 1768. It is an example of Sicilian Baroque at its most stylistically simple.|$|E
5|$|In {{the ensuing}} period many {{thousands}} of country houses of great architectural value were demolished, or had whole wings razed to the ground. In 1955 alone one house was demolished every five days. In this respect Belton was fortunate to survive at all, as {{in addition to the}} family's problems, the house deteriorated {{to such an extent that}} in 1961 the 6th Baron employed the architect Francis Johnson to oversee a large restoration program lasting three years. Not only was the roof repaired but much of the panelling taken down and repaired, and new <b>cornices</b> installed. Also attempts were made to curtail serious infestations of dry rot. By the time of the death of the 6th Baron in 1978, the resultant death duties, coupled with the rising costs of the upkeep, made Belton too much for the Brownlow family.|$|E
5|$|The convent, {{which was}} built around 1854, {{was used as the}} central {{residence}} of Jesuit missionaries in Bohol. It was built parallel to the transept and was an unusual three-storey structure, with a two-storey outdoor gallery (called a volada) and thick walls. It is the only convent in the Philippines with three storeys. An extension perpendicular to the convent was built {{in the middle of the}} 19th century. The convent was also adorned with paintings on its walls and ceilings, and with colored glass on its windows and <b>cornices</b> on the kitchen. The roof was replaced with galvanized iron in 1888. The third floor of the convent is now used as an ecclesiastical museum (known as Loboc Museum), containing several religious artifacts, such as a 1786 silver missal and 18th century wooden Santo Niño.|$|E
50|$|Pendants {{support the}} {{brackets}} at the roofline <b>cornice</b> above the tripartite window; {{all the other}} brackets on that <b>cornice</b> are identical to those on the bay windows. Above the tripartite window an engaged turret rises. The lower of its two stages has round-arched one-over-one double-hung sash. Another bracketed <b>cornice</b> above it supports the flared, conical roof.|$|R
50|$|A pair {{of short}} towers stand {{alongside}} the centre bay. They {{each have a}} simple straight-headed entrance with pilasters, a <b>cornice</b> and a pediment at ground-floor level, and two more windows and a door above. A wide dentil <b>cornice</b> runs around each tower, and on the inside an extra section projects inwards and upwards beyond the <b>cornice</b> line. Elaborate single-storey entrance bays flank the towers, with chamfered arches, ornate mouldings, Ionic columns and a <b>cornice.</b> Above the frieze is a scroll-moulded cartouche which is framed by the upper sections of the columns.|$|R
50|$|A <b>cornice</b> {{return is}} an {{architectural}} detail that occurs where the horizontal <b>cornice</b> of a roof {{connects to the}} rake of a gable. It is a short horizontal extension of the <b>cornice</b> that occurs {{on each side of}} the gable end of the building (see picture of the Härnösands rådhus with two of these). The two most common types of <b>cornice</b> return are the Greek return and the soffit return (also called a boxed or box soffit return). The former includes a sloped hip-shape on the inside of the <b>cornice</b> under the eaves which is sheathed or shingled like the rest of the roof above it and is considered very attractive; the latter is a simple return without these features.|$|R
5|$|The {{interior}} was lavishly decorated with colourful Byzantine-style mosaics, <b>cornices,</b> and ceramics. With {{the exception of}} the Corinthian and Doric column capitals, which are of Roman or Byzantine origin, the rest of the decoration was created specifically for and during the church's construction. Vlasto finds a Proto-Bulgarian flavour in the church's interior and a relationship with the art of Persia or Central Asia. Thus, he believes that it is not based on Byzantine examples of that age. Of a contrary opinion is Miyatev, who points out significant similarities between the decoration of the Round Church and that of the Church of the Mother of God (now part of the Fenari Isa Mosque) from 908 in Constantinople. Mavrodinov goes a step further to claim that the architect of the Round Church was directly inspired by ancient examples, citing in particular the rich sculptural decoration.|$|E
5|$|Delta caused {{considerable}} {{damage in the}} Canary Islands. The storm claimed nineteen lives and caused a total of €312million ($364million 2005 US dollars) damage throughout the archipelago. Eighteen died when a boat sank off the Canary Islands; twelve of the bodies were never found. The nineteenth man was killed when while trying to repair his roof during the storm; winds threw him from his ladder. The islands of Tenerife and La Palma were hardest hit, with many uprooted trees and landslides reported. The peak gust recorded at La Palma was 95mph (152km/h), and at Tenerife the maximum gust was 90mph (147km/h). Some patients at Tenerife's University Hospital were evacuated to a safer {{part of the building}} when paneling from the hospital's heliport was torn free and smashed some of the building's windows. Off Santa Cruz's southern quay a tug boat broke its ties, collided with another vessel, and sank. Passengers at Tenerife North Airport, who were stranded when their flights canceled, witnessed parts of the new international terminal's roof tear off in the wind. In La Palma a falling palm tree, trunk snapped by the wind, injured the leg of a German tourist. Many palm trees along the Avenida Marítima were also blown down. The storms winds blew out windows and collapsed <b>cornices,</b> although other structural damage was minimal. Metal plates that had been used to board up buildings were strewn all over the island.|$|E
5|$|Sicilian church exteriors {{had been}} {{decorated}} in elaborate styles {{from the first}} quarter of the 17th century, with profuse use of sculpture, stucco, frescoes, and marble (Illustration 14). As the post-earthquake churches were becoming completed in the late 1720s, interiors also began to reflect this external decoration, becoming lighter and less intense (compare illustration 14 to the later interior of illustration 15), with profuse sculpted ornamentation of pillars, <b>cornices,</b> and pediments, often in the form of putti, flora, and fauna. Inlaid coloured marbles on floors and walls in complex patterns are one of the most defining features of the style. These patterns with their roundels of porphyry are often derived from designs found in the Norman cathedrals of Europe, again demonstrating the Norman origins of Sicilian architecture. The high altar is usually the pièce de resistance: in many instances a single block of coloured marble, decorated with gilt scrolls and swags, and frequently inset with other stones such as lapis lazuli and agate. Steps leading to the altar dais are characteristically curving between concave and convex and in many cases decorated with inlaid coloured marbles. One of the finest examples of this is in the church of St Zita in Palermo.|$|E
50|$|The <b>cornice</b> {{is split}} into the soffit, the corona, and the cymatium. The soffit {{is simply the}} exposed underside. The corona and the cymatium are the {{principal}} parts of the <b>cornice.</b>|$|R
50|$|The columns have Corinthian order capitals and {{bases and}} support a large frieze and <b>cornice.</b> The <b>cornice</b> {{has a large}} central convex surface on which is a simple, deeply carved {{curvilinear}} pattern.|$|R
