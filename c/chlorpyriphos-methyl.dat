40|$|The insecticidal {{effects of}} deltamethrin, <b>chlorpyriphos-methyl,</b> pirimiphos-methyl, and {{spinosad}} were evaluated against adults of Prostephanus truncatus (Horn) (Coleoptera: Bostrychidae) and larvae of Ephestia kuehniella (Zeller) (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae). Spinosad was applied at 1 and 0. 5 ppm, deltamethrin at 0. 5 ppm, <b>chlorpyriphos-methyl</b> at 2. 25 ppm, and pirimiphos-methyl at 4 ppm. All tests {{were carried out}} on wheat for E. kuehniella and in maize for P. truncatus, at three temperature levels, 20, 25, and 30 A degrees C. Mortality of the exposed individuals of P. truncatus was measured after 7, 14, and 21 days of exposure, and 60 days later, the progeny production in the treated and untreated substrate was recorded. In the case of Ephestia kuehniella, mortality was assessed after 25 days. Spinosad was highly effective against P. truncatus adults, even at 0. 5 ppm, but 1 ppm provided a better "speed of kill" and a higher suppression of progeny production. Mortality of the exposed P. truncatus adults after 21 days of exposure on maize treated with 0. 5 ppm of spinosad was 100 %, regardless of the temperature level tested. A complete (100 %) mortality level was also noted {{in the case of}} maize treated with deltamethrin and pirimiphos-methyl, while in the case of <b>chlorpyriphos-methyl,</b> mortality at the 21 day exposure ranged between 61 and 90 %. Progeny production was completely suppressed only on maize treated with deltamethrin. In contrast, pirimiphos-methyl was the most effective grain protectant for E. kuehniella, since mortality was usually < 99 %. In general, for both species tested, temperature had a significant effect on mortality, but this trend was different at different insecticides...|$|E

Limits of detection (LOD) and quantitation (LOQ) values in the range 0. 1 – 14. 3 lg/L and 0. 2 – 43. 3 lg/L, respectively, were obtained. The LOQ values are below the maximum residue levels (MRLs) established by European Regulation for grapes, {{with the exception of}} methidathion.

40|$|A {{series of}} {{experiments}} were carried out between 2007 and 2009 to test the efficacy of selected insecticides against several stored-product psocids. Three {{series of experiments}} were conducted against Liposcelis spp. (Psocoptera: Liposcelididae) and Lepinotus reticulatus (Psocoptera: Trogiidae). In the first series of tests, contact insecticides were evaluated in the laboratory as grain protectants. Among these insecticides, diatomaceous earth (DE), natural pyrethrum, and the insect growth regulator methoprene were unable to control psocid populations on wheat, rice, and maize. For the same commodities, spinosad was effective against L. reticulatus, but was effective for Liposcelis entomophila only on maize; spinosad was not effective against Liposcelis bostrychophila and Liposcelis paeta. <b>Chlorpyriphos-methyl</b> + deltamethin and pirimiphos-methyl were very effective for all species tested. In the second series of tests, sulfuryl fluoride (SF) was tested against L. paeta eggs, nymphs, and adults, and Liposcelis decolor eggs and adults.

40|$|Silvering of {{nectarine}} {{fruit is}} a kind of damage caused by thrips feeding on ripening fruit. It is due to thrips infestation occurring during a month before presumed harvest. This damage is more frequent and serious on brightly coloured varieties which ripen between the end of June and the end of July. A study of the control of thrips infestation on nectarines was carried out over a 3 -year period in Emilia-Romagna Region (northern Italy). Thrips populations on sprouts were monitored starting from May up until the harvest in July. Over the last two years thrips populations were also sampled on fruit during the harvest. A significant correla-tion between the density of thrips populations on fruits and fruit damage was found. The thrips species recorded was Frankliniella occidentalis (Pergande), along with a variable percentage (0 - 55 %) of other Thrips spp. over the 3 -year period. A total of five pesticides were evaluated (Acrinathrin, <b>Chlorpyriphos-methyl,</b> Ethofenprox, Phosmet and Spinosad). Acrinathrin and Spinosad proved to be most effective against thrips, particularly when a high relative abundance of thrips was present...|$|E
40|$|This {{bulletin}} summarizes nearly 10 {{years of}} research related to wheat stored on farms and in elevators in Kansas. It describes on-farm equipment and pest control practices and typical storage conditions that affect grain quality. The cost-effectiveness of aeration, grain protectants, and fumigation was evaluated. Grain cooling by aeration was the most effective insect-control technique and had the lowest variable cost but often was managed poorly. Automatically controlled fans increased the efficiency and convenience of aeration for insect control. Malathion protectants performed poorly. Applying Reldan ® (<b>chlorpyriphos-methyl)</b> protectant was more costly than other techniques but was generally effective. Treatment of farm-stored wheat with phosphine fumigants was shown to be often unsuccessful, and methods of making fumigation more effective in farm bins were tested. The relationships between producer, buyer, wheat quality (especially factors affected during storage), and price were investigated, and wheat marketing practices are summarized. Discounting practices at Kansas elevators appeared to provide a weak and mixed message relative {{to the importance of}} insect control in farm storage. Elevator-level storage and marketing practices also are reported. A detailed summary and recommendations for maintaining quality in farm storag...|$|E
40|$|Plant {{ingredients}} and {{processed animal proteins}} are alternative feedstuffs for fish feeds in aquaculture. However, their use can introduce contaminants like pesticides that are not previously associated with marine Atlantic salmon and gilthead sea bream farming. This study covers the screening of around 800 pesticides by gas chromatography (GC) and liquid chromatography (LC) coupled to high resolution time-of-flight mass spectrometry in matrices throughout the entire marine food production chain. Prior to analysis of real-world samples, the screening methodology was validated for 252 pesticides to establish the screening detection limit. This was 0. 01 mg kg− 1 for 113 pesticides (45 %), 0. 05 mg kg− 1 for 73 pesticides (29 %) and > 0. 05 mg kg− 1 for 66 pesticides (26 %). After that, a quantitative methodology based on GC coupled to tandem mass spectrometry with atmospheric pressure chemical ionization source (GC-APCI-MS/MS) was optimized for the pesticides found in the screening. Although several polar pesticides, of which pirimiphos methyl and <b>chlorpyriphos-methyl</b> were most dominant, were found in plant material and feeds based on these ingredients, {{none of them were}} observed in fillets of Atlantic salmon and gilthead sea bream fed on these feeds.

40|$|Abstract: Pesticide {{residues}} {{are found}} in oilseeds and crude oils: they are mainly organophosphate insecticides (pirimiphos-methyl, dichlorvos, malathion) used in empty storage facilities and for appli-cation to stored cereal grains. Even if pests {{are found in}} stored oilseeds, French regulation does not permit use of these insecticides on stored oilseeds, as they have affinity for these lipophilic subtances. These residues arise from cross-contamination during mechanical contact with storage bins and grain handling equipment, and not from illegal use. This uptake of insecticide residues from their storage environment by oilseeds can lead to levels that exceed regulatory limits.

40|$|In recent years, several {{researches}} on {{the acute}} laboratory {{toxicity of pesticides}} to bumblebees have been carried. However, only a few researches on the toxicity of pesticides to bumblebees in semi-field and field-tests have bee conducted, and thus little {{information on this subject}} is available. The Italian Ministry of Agricultural Resources and Forestry financed the “AMA” Project (Ape-Miele-Ambiente) with the aim to intensify researches on toxicological impacts of pesticides on Apoidea. Within this project, we tried to develop an extended laboratory bioassay to evaluate the effects of insecticides and acaricides on bum-blebees. In order to record the behaviour and mortality of bumblebee workers after exposure to plants sprayed with pesticides, special cages offering the bees ample flying space, were built. Prior being transferred into the cages, potted flowering cucumber (Cu-cumis sativus) plants were sprayed with different pesticides at the field rate. Three different classes of pesticides were tested: phosphorganics (<b>chlorpyriphos-methyl,</b> dichlorvos, dimethoate, heptenophos and quinalphos), azotorganics (ethiofencarb and imidacloprid) and pyrethroids (acrinathrin and bifenthrin). In a first test, in each cage, thirty bumblebees were put into contact with the plants 1 hour after the treatment. For the next three days, every 24 hours, abnormal behaviour and bumblebee mortal-ity were recorded. In a second test, the introduction of the bumblebees into the cages was delayed up to 24 hours after the treatment; behaviour and mortality were recorded over the next two days. The cages were housed in a greenhouse and tem...|$|E

40|$|The “potato trap” {{technique}} {{was applied for}} the fi rst time in Italian (Sicily) vineyards {{in an attempt to}} assess: a) the impact of the kairomonal activity of the vine mealybug sex pheromone (S) -(+) -lavandulyl senecioate (LS) on the parasitism of mealybugs by the encyrtid Anagyrus sp. near pseudococci, b) the influence of two commonly used insecticides on the parasitization activity of A. sp. near pseudococci towards mealybugs, and c) the efficiency of the release of A. sp. near pseudococci in enhancing parasitism rates of mealybugs. The number of captured A. sp. near pseudococci females in LS baited traps was significantly higher than that in unbaited traps. The minimal number of days for the first parasitoid emergence in LS baited traps was almost 3 days earlier, compared to unbaited control, suggesting a faster host detection by the encyrtid when LS is applied. These findings resulted in a significant increase in parasitism of mealybugs by A. sp. near pseudococci in LS baited traps relative to unbaited traps suggesting that the LS is used by the encyrtid as kairomone to ensure greater potential for host searching activity. Insecticide treatments significantly affected parasitization activity of A. sp. near pseudococci on mealybugs when compared to an untreated control with parasitoid release. The buprofezin, <b>chlorpyriphos-methyl</b> and untreated control with no parasitoid release treatments had statistically similar numbers of emerged parasitoids from exposed mealybugs. The obtained results provide evidence that, in the absence of conventional insecticides applications, the use of the LS could be a promising tool to improve and strengthen biological control of mealybugs by A. sp. near pseudococci within Sicilian vineyard conditions...|$|E

40|$|Pesticide {{residues}} {{are found}} in oilseeds (rapeseed and sunflower) and crude oils: they are mainly organophosphate insecticides (pirimiophos-methyl, malathion when authorized) used in empty storage facilities and for direct application to stored cereal grain. Even if some secondary pests {{are found in}} stored oilseeds, French regulations do not allow use of these insecticides on stored oilseeds. These residues arise from cross-contamination from storage bins and grain handling equipment of grain stores, and not from illegal use. This uptake of insecticide residues from their storage environment by oilseeds may lead to residue contents that exceed regulatory limits. A three-year investigation in grain storage companies allowed us to follow the course of sunflower batches and rapeseed batches during storage seasons 2006 - 2007, 2007 - 2008 and 2008 - 2009, from reception at the storage facility to outloading. Each of these batches was sampled at outloading, and was analyzed for insecticide residues. Traceability of oilseeds established by grain-store managers allowed us to identify cross-contamination sources. The insecticides that were most commonly detected were pirimiophos-methyl, malathion, and dichlorvos (in sunflower 2006 - 2007), plus <b>chlorpyriphos-methyl</b> and deltamethrin. Pirimiophos-methyl was the most commonly detected active substance, and caused the most cases of non-accordance with regulatory levels in rapeseed. Cross-contamination could have occurred when cereal grains were treated upon receipt, when rapeseed was also delivered, especially when treatments were done systematically to the cereal grains. For sunflower, the main cross-contamination hazard resulted from treatment of cereals at the period of receipt or at their outloading, just before sunflower seeds batches were outloaded.

The last article presented the results obtained by an investigation on stored sunflower seeds, and this new work presents results on stored rapeseed. Pesticide residues are found in oilseeds and crude oils: they are mainly organophosphate insecticides (pirimiphos-methyl, malathion) used in empty storage facilities and for application to stored cereal grains. French regulation does not allow use of these insecticides on stored oilseeds. These residues arise from cross-contamination from storage bins and facilities, and not from illegal use. This uptake of insecticide residues from their storage environment by oilseeds can lead to levels that can exceed regulatory limits. An investigation in 13 grain storage companies allowed us to follow the course of 21 rapeseed batches, from their receipt at the storage facilities to outloading. Samples from each of these batches, made at outloading, were analysed by ITERG, looking for insecticide residues. Traceability of rapeseed established by storers allowed us to identify cross-contamination sources. Results are slightly different from those obtained the previous year on sunflower seeds.

40|$|Background: Malaria is endemic in sub-Saharan Africa with {{considerable}} burden for human health. Major insecticide resistance mechanisms such as kdr(R) and ace- 1 (R) alleles constitute a hindrance to malaria vector control programs. Anopheles gambiae bearing both kdr and ace- 1 resistant alleles are increasingly recorded in wild populations. In {{order to maintain}} the efficacy of vector control strategies, the characterization of concomitant kdr and ace- 1 resistance, and their pleiotropic effects on malaria vector phenotype on insecticide efficacy are important. Methods: Larval and adult bioassays were performed with different insecticide classes used in public health following WHO standard guidelines on four laboratory Anopheles gambiae strains, sharing the same genetic background but harboring distinct resistance status: KISUMU with no resistance allele; ACERKIS with ace- 1 (R) allele; KISKDR with kdr(R) allele and ACERKDRKIS with both resistance alleles' ace- 1 (R) and kdr(R). Results: Larval bioassays indicate that the homozygote resistant strain harboring both alleles (ACERKDRKIS) displayed slightly but significantly higher resistance level to various insecticides like carbamates (bendiocarb, p < 0. 001; propoxur, p = 0. 02) and organophosphates (<b>chlorpyriphos-methyl,</b> p = 0. 002; fenitrothion, p < 0. 001) when compared to ACERKIS strain. However, no differences were recorded between ACERKDRKIS and KISKDR resistance level against permethrin (Pyrethroid, p = 0. 7) and DDT (Organochlorine, p = 0. 24). For adult bioassays, the percentages of mosquitoes knocked down were significantly lower for ACERKDRKIS than for KISKDR with permethrin (p = 0. 003) but not with deltamethrin. The percentage of mortality from adult bioassays was similar between ACERKDRKIS and ACERKIS with carbamates and organophosphates, or between ACERKDRKIS and KISKDR with pyrethroid and DDT. Concerning acetylcholinesterase enzyme, ACERKDRKIS strain showed similarAChE 1 activity than that of ACERKIS. Conclusion: The presence of both kdr(R) and ace- 1 (R) alleles seems to increase the resistance levels to both carbamate and organophosphate insecticides and at operational level, may represent an important threat to malaria vector control programs in West Africa...|$|E
