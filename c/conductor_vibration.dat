40|$|Aeolian {{vibrations}} {{of power}} lines are induced by Von Karman vortex shedding. Vortex shedding {{is characterized by}} vibration frequencies in the approximate range of 3 - 100 Hz (sometimes higher) and by amplitudes that can reach conductor diameter for the lower range of frequencies, under very slow to medium wind speed (0. 5 m/s to about 7 m/s). <b>Conductor</b> <b>vibration</b> causes localized bending, which may cause fatigue failure of the conductor strands. The amplitude of vibration very much depends on conductor self damping, which may be very low.

A statistical overview of measurements is presented and Lifetime is estimated. Peer reviewe...|$|E

40|$|The present paper {{describes}} experiments {{carried out}} on IREQ laboratory cable test bench. Test span arrangement is a 63. 15 m cable span with termination ends designed so as to minimize energy dissipation. A shaker provides a vertical alternating force to the conductor. During the experiments, a maximum of information on mode shape is collected: location of nodes, antinode amplitude of vibration, relative displacement at 44. 5, 89, and 178 mm from the last point of contact with the metallic clamp. Several configurations are studied: span equipped with an homogeneous steel cable, span equipped with an ACSR Crow conductor, sometimes {{in combination with other}} equipments such as a vibration damper or a local mass, to investigate how the presence of such devices impacts <b>conductor</b> <b>vibrations.</b> It results from these experiments an interesting comparison of two widely used fatigue indicators, the relative displacement Yb 2 (also called “bending amplitude”) and fymax (the product of antinode amplitude of vibration by frequency). Also, collected data gives indirect information on conductor variable bending stiffness. Peer reviewe...|$|R

40|$|Capricornia Electricity has an {{extensive}} Single Wire Earth Return (SWER) rural distribution network. As this SWER network ages, service problems resulting from excessive uncontrolled aeolian vibration are becoming apparent. In some SWER schemes {{the failure of}} hand ties and associated hardware is widespread. In the worst affected areas, {{there is evidence of}} damage to the aluminium wires in the ACSR conductor. As the current accepted practice is to reconductor these damaged lines, Capricornia Electricity is faced with major refurbishment costs. This thesis describes the investigative work undertaken to address the question of whether it is possible to reliably extend the service life of the vibration damaged lines without the need for reconductoring. In addition, the suitability of high tension line designs utilising small diameter conductors in terrain conducive to aeolian vibration is evaluated. While aeolian vibration is a well recognised and researched problem on transmission lines, relatively little work has been carried out on highly tensioned small diameter conductors in the range 5 -lOmm. Furthermore, no specific work which addresses vibration problems in composite outer layer ACSR conductors could be located. In this research project, the current knowledge on <b>conductor</b> <b>vibration</b> and fatigue in transmission line conductors was reviewed, and the applicability of this knowledge to small diameter conductors was examined. It was established that field data on vibration modes and duration needed to be collected to allow for a satisfactory analysis of the vibration problem. Subsequent investigative work included the collection and analysis of a large volume of field data {{on the nature of the}} vibration problem, the establishment of the residual life of damaged conductors through laboratory testing, as well as experimental work to ascertain the effectiveness of various damping devices. Based on the available data, it was concluded that the application of appropriate damping systems would ensure the mechanical integrity of lines even where fatigue damage has occurred...|$|E

Barehand working provides the lineman with greater dexterity than the hot stick method, and may be the preferred option if conditions permit it.

Silicone is also a robust material (especially when compared to the cheap, unsafe jelly rubber that many dildos are made of) that can be sterilized by boiling or bleaching (using a bleach solution, diluted: 10% bleach 90% water).|$|R
40|$|Abstract : Aeolian {{vibrations}} {{of transmission}} line conductors may cause fretting fatigue failure {{at or near}} the location of clamped devices. At these locations, the bending stiffness variation of the conductor has a large influence on its deformed shape and hence on its fatigue mechanics. Variable bending stiffness models could be integrated in non-linear finite element programs to obtain better mechanical behaviour predictions. However, there is very little data available in the literature to validate such numerical models. The objective {{of this paper is to}} present experimental data for the deformed shape of two types of ACSR <b>conductors</b> undergoing <b>vibrations.</b> The tests were performed on a 5. 83 m test bench for various tensions, displacement amplitudes and frequencies. The displacement amplitude was measured at the vibration anti-node and at five locations near the squarefaced bushing. The results suggest a large stiffness variation near the bushing. This experimental study provides valuable data to compare with a numerical model of a vibrating conductor that includes variable bending stiffness...|$|R
40|$|Original {{scientific}} paper In {{electrical power}} system, variety of solid, liquid and gaseous materials {{are used for}} insulation target to protect the incipient failure inside the high voltage power transformers. The insulation is practically ended when the insulation system has become fragile enough to flourish cracks under the electrical and mechanical stresses {{to which it is}} subjected. The electrical and mechanical stresses are induced by short circuit currents, thermal expansion and contraction of the <b>conductors</b> and <b>vibration.</b> The dielectric strength of insulation is not vitally diminished by brittleness alone, but electrical breakdown will rapidly follow the improvement of ensuing cracks. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to briefly cover the methods favourable for determining the insulating value of the insulation on high voltage power transformer windings and bushings. Many failures of insulation are caused by the entrance of moisture. Insulating materials used on high voltage power transformer windings have a high affinity for moisture from the surrounding atmosphere or oil. Effects of the stressed oil volume and stressing time on the breakdown stress of high voltage power transformer insulation were experimentally investigated. The factors influencing the effects and the results obtained based on them were statistically analysed and systematized by the Weibull distribution method. A Four-dimensional volume theory allowing good estimation of breakdown stress in terms of specific probable values has bee...|$|R
50|$|What ensued was {{a series}} of events that {{occurred}} within minutes yet took investigators months to reconstruct. The tyre embedded in the rail car was seen by Jörg Dittmann, one of the passengers in Coach 1. The tyre went through an armrest between where his wife and son sat. Dittmann took his wife and son out of the damaged coach and went to inform a conductor in the third coach. The <b>conductor,</b> who noticed <b>vibrations</b> in the train, told Dittmann that company policy required him to investigate the circumstances before pulling the emergency brake. The conductor took one minute to go to the site in Coach 1. According to Dittmann, the train had begun to sway from side to side by then. The conductor did not show a willingness to stop the train immediately at that point and wished to investigate the incident more thoroughly. The crash occurred just when Dittmann was about to show the armrest puncture to the conductor.|$|R
40|$|International audienceOverhead power {{transmission}} lines, their supporting towers, insulators {{and other elements}} create a highly distributed system that is vulnerable to damage. Typical damage scenarios cover cracking of foundation, breakage of insulators, loosening of rivets, as well as cracking and breakage of lines. Such scenarios may result from various factors: groundings, lightning strikes, floods, earthquakes, aeolian <b>vibrations,</b> <b>conductors</b> galloping, icing, and also include sabotage or terrorist attacks. It is impossible to monitor every kilometer of power lines, especially when they pass through inaccessible areas like mountains or swamps. This implies {{that many of the}} damage scenarios mentioned remain unnoticed or are detected too late. In most cases damage of the power system leads to instantaneous blackouts of small regions, but huge blackouts are also possible. Every power outage causes a great financial loss, threats to hospital patients, public transport or even national security. The paper presents a brief introduction to the field of damage detection in transmission towers, emphasizing indexes calculated by simple processing and using artificial neural networks. Problem of line sag monitoring is also mentioned. The paper ends with a short report on possible financial impacts of an SHM system for electric energy transmission and distribution system...|$|R
40|$|A Space Shuttle Columbia {{main engine}} {{controller}} 14 AWG wire short circuited during {{the launch of}} STS- 93. Post-flight examination divulged that the wire had electrically arced against {{the head of a}} nearby bolt. More extensive inspection revealed additional damage to the subject wire, and to other wires as well from the mid-body of Columbia. The shorted wire was to have been constructed from nickel-plated copper conductors surrounded by the polyimide insulation Kapton, top-coated with an aromatic polyimide resin. The wires were analyzed via scanning electron microscope (SEM), energy dispersive X-Ray spectroscopy (EDX), and electron spectroscopy for chemical analysis (ESCA); differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) were performed on the polyimide. Exemplar testing under laboratory conditions was performed to replicate the mechanical damage characteristics evident on the failed wires. The exemplar testing included a step test, where, as the name implies, a person stepped on a simulated wire bundle that rested upon a bolt head. Likewise, a shear test that forced a bolt head and a torque tip against a wire was performed to attempt to damage the insulation and <b>conductor.</b> Additionally, a <b>vibration</b> test was performed to determine if a wire bundle would abrade when vibrated against the head of a bolt. Also, an abrasion test was undertaken to determine if the polyimide of the wire could be damaged by rubbing against convolex helical tubing. Finally, an impact test was performed to ascertain if the use of the tubing would protect the wire from the strike of a foreign object...|$|R
5000|$|Conductor gallop {{analysis}} overlaps several academic disciplines. Mechanical vibrations {{covers the}} laws of motion of the conductor and the long conductor acts as a mass suspended by an elastic spring obeying Hooke's law. Within the discipline of Mechanical <b>vibration,</b> <b>conductor</b> gallop is categorized as a self-excited vibration because the forces which generate conductor gallop are generated by the motion itself. One of the early leaders in modern mechanical vibrations, J. P. Den Hartog, described conductor gallop in a chapter on self-excited vibrations in his text book Mechanical Vibrations, copyrighted in 1956 and reprinted by Dover Publications, where he develops general stability criteria for conductor gallop but without a complete mathematical solution. However, conductor gallop analysis also relates to Civil engineering because the electric conductors are carried by towers {{and the study of}} wind influences on structures, including any kind of vibration, has been much studied, especially {{after the collapse of the}} Tacoma Narrows bridge due to Karman vortex shedding from the structural members. In fact, perfectly round electrical conductors experience vortex shedding in certain ranges of the Reynolds number. The underlying behavior in the conductor gallop phenomenon also applies to other civil engineering structural elements such as cables and stays on bridges. A more recent reference related to the analysis of conductor gallop is Flow-Induced Vibrations, An Engineering Guide, by Eduard Naudascher and Donald Rockwell copyrighted in 1994 and still published by Dover Publications in 2005, in which experimental data related to vortex shedding frequencies as well as the aerodynamic forces on various structure shapes including cylinder models for a conductor or cable. Another book titled Flow-Induced Vibration by Robert D. Blevins, 2nd Edition published by Van Nostrand-Reinhold in 1990, also treats conductor gallop while reporting experimental data related to vortex shedding and aerodynamic forces on various structural shapes. Both of the last-mentioned works include references to scientific and engineering journal articles, many of which directly relate to conductor gallop. In aeronautical engineering the term [...] "flutter" [...] is used to describe conductor gallop and analogous other phenomena involving aerodynamic forces interacting with elastic structures having inertial mass.|$|R
40|$|D. Ing. (Mechanical Engineering) This {{research}} {{proposed to}} develop a mathematical model for the prediction of aeolian vibration levels on overhead transmission lines {{in order to be}} able to ensure that damping systems are designed optimally in future. In order to enhance the understanding of aeolian and wake-induced vibration further, it also proposed to implement and apply the fluid flow simulation technique of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) to both single conductors and conductor bundles. The Introduction of the CFD tool to the field of transmission line vibration, will ensure that bundles could be optimally designed for future applications. Wind-induced vibrations are known to cause expensive damage to the conductors and related hardware through fatigue or clashing of the bundled conductors. The primary cause of <b>conductor</b> aeolian <b>vibration</b> is the alternate shedding of wind-induced eddies from the top and bottom sides of the conductor, whereas wake-induced oscillations is peculiar to bundled conductors and arises from effects of the shielding of leeward conductors in bundles by windward ones. In order to study the phenomenon of aeolian vibration, research was undertaken utilising a full scale transmission line test station close to Kroonstad in the Orange Free State. Commercially available computer based packages were used for the development and simulation of both the mathematical model and fluid flow. During the flow simulations, an actual Zebra conductor and Zebra bundle configuration were utilised. For the development of the mathematical model, the pratical results, as measured at the Kroonstad transmission line test station during Phase I, were utilised. From the tests performed during Phase I, it was concluded that the damping solutions, currently used by Eskom as tested during Phase I, are all effective in controlling the aeolian vibration. The Stockbridge damper proved to be avery effective damper. Two models for the prediction of aeolian vibration levels were derived. Results showed that the vibration levels could be estimated to the correct order of magnitude and in many cases the precise values. The accuracy of the model was further improved by the inclusion of the Strouhal number as a function of windspeed. It has been decided by the author 10 develop and design a low cost vibration activity indicator for aeolian vibration measurements. The T-R-I-V-A-I has shown that it is a repeatable, reliable device, Ideally suited for line vibration detection. A new device, the W-I-V-I, has also been designed and implemented by the author for the detection and quantification of wake-induced vibration. During the simulation of the flows around a conductor in the steady state, it was established that the flow around as smooth cylinder and a Zebra conductor, is very similar, however, it was established that the rough outer surface of the Zebra conductor acts as a vortex generator. It has been found that a stability relationship exists between the degree of symmetry of the pressure cell, directly in front of the leeward conductor and the wake-induced vibration. Results for the unsteady flow situation showed the initiation and dispersion of the vortices as they are generated alongside the conductor. It is recommended that the developed model's accuracy be further enhanced. It should be established if. there are families of curves and data that belong together and that contribute to the amount of scatter in the parameters measured such as vibration amplitude, Strouhal number, etc. The applicability of CFD to the transmission line field should be enhanced, with the view of increasing bundle performance, both from an electrical and mechanical point of view...|$|R
