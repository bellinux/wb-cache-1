25|$|In April 2013, Salt Lake City {{launched}} a bike share program known as GREENbike. The program {{allows users to}} pay $5 per day to access bicycles, with the option of purchasing a weekly or annual pass. As of {{the launch of the}} program, there were 10 stations in the downtown core. By October 2014, the number of stations had expanded to 20.

2500|$|Although {{visitors}} may {{be surprised}} by the apparently large number of cycle parking facilities in Copenhagen, there {{is in fact a}} severe lack of available cycle stands, and among the subjective indicators measured by the <b>city,</b> <b>bicycle</b> parking fares worst, with only 29% being satisfied with the facilities. There are approximately 560.000 bicycles in the city of Copenhagen, more bicycles than people, yet they share only 48.000 bicycle stands. With a view to remedying the situation, in 2008 the Danish Cyclists Federation published a [...] "Bicycling Parking Manual" [...] with a number of guidelines. They are of immediate practical use to today's users but they also offer advice for city planners wishing to improve facilities in the future. A number of projects have been launched to ease Copenhagen's notorious shortage of bicycle parking spaces, particularly at transport hubs. While the city expects there will always be more bicycles in Copenhagen than parking spots, it hopes to increase satisfaction with bicycle parking significantly by 2025, through a coordinated effort to improve conditions and facilities.|$|E
