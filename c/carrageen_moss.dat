Says he, 'You ought to try <b>Carrageen</b> <b>moss.</b> It's an old drug, but it's a good one.' There was a drawer full of it to his hand; had been lying there any time this ten years: I go to open it; but what was my {{feelings}} when he goes on, as cool as a cucumber--'And there's bushels of it here,' says he, 'on every rock; so if you'll come down with me at low tide this afternoon, I'll show you the trade, and {{tell you how to}} boil it.' I thought I should have knocked him down." ...|$|E
6000|$|Go down at low spring-tide to {{the nearest}} ledge of rocks, and with a hammer and chisel chip off {{a few pieces of}} stone covered with growing sea-weed. Avoid the common and coarser kinds (fuci) which cover the surface of the rocks; for they give out under water a slime which will foul your tank: but choose the more {{delicate}} species which fringe the edges of every pool at low-water mark; the pink coralline, the dark purple ragged dulse (Rhodymenia), the <b>Carrageen</b> <b>moss</b> (Chondrus), and above all, the commonest of all, the delicate green Ulva, which you will see growing everywhere in wrinkled fan-shaped sheets, as thin as the finest silver-paper. [...] The smallest bits of stone are sufficient, provided the sea-weeds have hold of them; for they have no real roots, but adhere by a small disc, deriving no nourishment from the rock, but only from the water. Take care, meanwhile, that there be as little as possible on the stone, beside the weed itself. Especially scrape off any small sponges, and see that no worms have made their twining tubes of sand among the weed-stems; if they have, drag them out; for they will surely die, and as surely spoil all by sulphuretted hydrogen, blackness, and evil smells.|$|E
5000|$|Seafood {{remained}} {{an important part}} of the diet in coastal cities like Galway and Dublin. In Dublin the fish seller is celebrated in the traditional folk song [...] "Molly Malone", and in Galway the international Galway Oyster Festival is held every September. An example of a modern Irish shellfish dish is Dublin Lawyer (lobster cooked in whiskey and cream). Salmon and cod are perhaps the two most common types of fish eaten. <b>Carrageen</b> <b>moss</b> and dulse (both types of red algae) are commonly used in Irish seafood dishes.|$|E
5000|$|Chondrus crispus—commonly called Irish moss or <b>carrageen</b> <b>moss</b> (Irish carraigín, [...] "little rock")—is {{a species}} of red algae which grows abundantly along the rocky parts of the Atlantic coast of Europe and North America. In its fresh {{condition}} this protist is soft and cartilaginous, varying in color from a greenish-yellow, through red, to a dark purple or purplish-brown. The principal constituent is a mucilaginous body, made of the polysaccharide carrageenan, which constitutes 55% of its weight. The organism also consists of nearly 10% protein and about 15% mineral matter, and is rich in iodine and sulfur. When softened in water it has a sea-like odour {{and because of the}} abundant cell wall polysaccharides it will form a jelly when boiled, containing from 20 to 100 times its weight of water.|$|E
50|$|Rabbits abound around Fahamore, as do rats, {{mice and}} the odd fox and badger.Local birds include seabirds (several species of seagull, shags, cormorants, gannets to name but a few), larks, starlings, curlews, crows, ravens, garden birds such as sparrows, robins and finches, and wading birds such as the heron. The swallow is a {{frequent}} visitor in the summer months.Marine mammals including seals and dolphins are frequently seen.Fish include sea bass, mullet, pollack, wrasse, dogfish, sea trout, flounder, plaice and ray.Shellfish found in the intertidal zone at Fahamore include mussels, limpets, periwinkles and whelks, {{as well as several}} species of crab, including shore, velvet and hermit.Lugworms are found extensively in the sand and their casts may be seen at low tide. They are frequently dug by local anglers and used as bait for bass fishing.Seaweeds include kelp, several varieties of wrack (including bladder and serrated), dilisc (or dulse), agar, sea grass, sea lettuce and <b>carrageen</b> <b>moss.</b>|$|E
30|$|Algae {{that are}} used for the {{production}} of natural substances are e.g. Caulerpa taxifolia, Chlorella vulgaris, Chondrus crispus (Irish moss or <b>carrageen</b> <b>moss),</b> Corallina officinalis, Delesseria sanguinea, Fucus serratus, Laminaria digitata, Laminaria japonica, Palmaria palmate (dulse), and Ulva lactuca (sea lettuce). The extract of the brown algae Fucus vesiculosus (bladderwrack algae) has the greatest number of notifiers (123).|$|E

The present study aimed to evaluate the potential of Hsp 70 as a biomarker of stress produced by increased temperature, osmotic pressure, and exposure to cadmium and sodium chloride in marine macroalgae and fresh water plant species. An indirect competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (IC-ELISA) was developed with a working range of 0. 025 - 10 μg ml- 1 using a monoclonal antibody raised against purified Hsp 70 of Phaseolus aureus (mung bean). Fucus serratus (toothed wrack), Chondrus crispus (Stackhouse or <b>Carrageen</b> <b>moss),</b> Ulva lactuca (sea lettuce) and Lemna minor (common duckweed) sample extracts were stressed for up to 24 h and then tested in the IC-ELISA. The presence of Hsp 70 and cross-reactivity of the monoclonal antibody was confirmed by Western blot. The heat shock response was confirmed in each species using a 2 -h 42 °C treatment. Following heat shock, Hsp 70 concentrations increased to a peak at 2 h (F. serratus) or 4 h (L. minor), after which concentrations decreased. Osmotic and cadmium stresses also resulted in elevated Hsp 70 concentrations in samples of F. serratus and L. minor when compared with unstressed controls. In both, osmotic and metal stress, the production of Hsp 70 increased to a maximum and subsequently decreased as the stressor levels increased. Results suggest that Hsp 70 IC-ELISA could potentially be applied to the detection of stress in these aquatic species, although it would probably be most effective when used in conjunction with other measurements to provide a stressor-specific biomarker profile or fingerprint...|$|E
