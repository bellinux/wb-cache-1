50|$|The {{main effect}} of the Directive is to {{stipulate}} that <b>cable</b> <b>retransmission</b> must be {{on the basis of}} contractual, not statutory, licences with copyright holders, although existing statutory licence schemes were permitted to remain in force until the end of 1997 (Art. 8). These licences may only be granted or refused by collecting societies 9(1), which effectively makes such societies compulsory: a collecting society may be deemed to be mandated to manage the <b>cable</b> <b>retransmission</b> <b>rights</b> of a copyright holder {{in the absence of any}} expressive agreement 9(2). Broadcasting organisations are free to exercise their own related rights to licence or prohibit the <b>cable</b> <b>retransmission</b> of their own broadcasts (Art. 10). The Directive also provides for mediation in disputes between cable operators and collecting societies (Art. 11) and for measures to prevent abuse of monopoly powers (Art. 12).|$|R
50|$|The {{retransmission}} {{agreement between}} the Sinclair Broadcast Group and Comcast was set to expire on February 5, 2007. An extension was granted twice so the sides could negotiate. During the talks, Comcast stated {{that it would not}} pay cash for <b>retransmission</b> <b>rights</b> but was willing to give free commercial time to WSMH in exchange for carriage. On March 9, Sinclair and Comcast signed a new deal to extend <b>retransmission</b> <b>rights</b> for four years to expire on March 1, 2011.|$|R

Comcast stated {{that it would not}} pay cash for <b>retransmission</b> <b>rights,</b> but was willing to barter, for example, promoting Sinclair stations on cable channels carried by Comcast devoid of any advertising payments by the company. On March 9, Comcast and Sinclair jointly announced a four-year deal for <b>retransmission</b> <b>rights,</b> expiring on March 1, 2011.|$|R
50|$|SIAE {{exercises}} the author's {{right on}} behalf of their legitimate owners. Authors' right has two distinct components: economic and moral. Italian law does not require a deposit since Berne Convention provides that the rights are first acquired upon creation of the work and therefore it is possible to prove the ownership by other means such as Copyzero. According to Article 180 bis, subscription is mandatory only for <b>cable</b> <b>retransmission</b> (not such a widespread technology in Italy), while broadcasting, both via radio and television, is not included.|$|R

This section of the law contains a full power of attorney, which GEMA also invokes: [...] "If a rights-holder has not transferred to any collecting society the exercise of his <b>rights</b> of <b>cable</b> <b>retransmission</b> in accordance with Article 20b, Paragraph 1, Sentence 1 of the Urheberrechtswahrnehmungsgesetz, then the collecting society that exercises rights of this sort will be considered to be entitled to exercise these rights." ...|$|R
50|$|Cable {{companies}} {{are required by}} the 1992 Cable Television Consumer Protection and Competition Act to negotiate for retransmission consent, usually paying broadcasters {{for the right to}} carry their signals. Broadcasters argued that Aereo was a threat both to their business model, by undermining the <b>cable</b> <b>retransmission</b> fees and the size of their audience. Because the fees cable companies pay for broadcast content can comprise up to 10% of a broadcaster's revenue, broadcasters object to Aereo's re-distribution of this content without paying any fees. Broadcasters have also identified Aereo as part of the cord-cutting trend among television audiences that poses a threat to broadcasters' advertising revenue.|$|R
50|$|ALCS's Ordinary Members sign {{a mandate}} that authorizes the Society to license and collect {{royalties}} on their behalf. ALCS is granted authority to exercise rights on each author's behalf {{as part of}} schemes for the collective administration of royalties in the UK and abroad. The rights range from photocopying, scanning and <b>cable</b> <b>retransmission</b> in the UK and internationally to reproduction in journals. The authority entitles ALCS in agreed circumstances to permit or forbid the exercise of the rights, grant licences, collect fees for use and damages for misuse and take action to defend and protect the rights.

40|$|This article {{examines}} the legislative and economic history of the retransmission consent provision in the 1992 <b>Cable</b> Act. <b>Retransmission</b> consent provisions in the 1992 Cable Act allow broadcasters {{to enter into negotiations}} with <b>cable</b> operators regarding <b>retransmission</b> of their broadcast signal. The 1992 Cable Act requires broadcasters to choose between retransmission consent and must-carry provisions every three years. The first election period ended in October 1996 and a new election period begins January 1, 1997. Retransmission consent has had a noticeable effect on the evolution of cable television broadcasting, although it is arguably unclear whether retransmission consent has addressed the issues its proponents claimed it would address...|$|R
40|$|Digital technologies, {{especially}} broadband technology, create {{opportunities for}} new services to emerge. A {{good example of}} such a new service in the market of audiovisual content is the so-called «Digital Cloud Recorder» (DCR). How should such a new «device» or service be perceived from a –Belgian– copyright point-of-view? Does the actual legal framework offer the right level of clarity to answer business-relevant questions? In this paper I will discuss the difficult relation of the DCR with traditional copyright concepts: the exceptions for private copying and temporary technical copies, <b>cable</b> <b>retransmission</b> and communication to the public and conclude that not all questions asked can be resolved with a simple yes or no answer. As with many copyright-related issues, the DCR and the entrepreneur wishing to bring it to the market will have to face the considerable risk of legal uncertainty. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{seeks to}} answer one central question: do the US <b>cable</b> and {{satellite}} <b>retransmission</b> statutory licences {{comply with the}} TRIPS minimum standard? When solving a legal problem, law is applied {{to a set of}} given facts to yield an outcome. In solving the legal problem set out above, the "Iaw" is provided by TRIPS, in particular the incorporated article 11 bis from the Berne Convention. It provides that national Iaw must recognise in copyright owners an exclusive right to authorise the retransmission of works included in broadcasts, when a party other than the original broadcaster does the retransmission. However, it also permits that exclusive right to be limited (such as by a statutory licence) so long as copyright owners are at least assured of a right to "equitable remuneration". The "facts" are the US <b>cable</b> and satellite <b>retransmission</b> satellite licences themselves, which are found in sections 111, 119 and 122 of the US Copyright Act 1976. The "outcome" to the problem is a conclusion whether these provisions comply with or violate TRIPS. As with most legal problem solving, the resolution of ambiguity provides the challenge. In this regard, by far the greatest challenge is created by {{the use of the term}} "equitable remuneration" in Berne article 11 bis. Resort will be had to not only the drafting history of the Berne Convention, but also to the discipline of economics and to the field of restitutionary monetary awards in common Iaw countries, to seek to provide a meaning for that term. Another ambiguity relates to the very nature of the <b>retransmission</b> <b>right,</b> in particular, whether the <b>right</b> includes <b>retransmissions</b> to members of the public for which the primary broadcast was intended. Reference will be made to the provision's drafting history to seek to clarify this matter. Further ambiguity arises in the relationship between Berne article 11 bis and TRIPS article 13, the latter which makes the general "three-step test" applicable to copyright "limitations or exceptions" to exclusive rights under TRIPS. Finally, the US retransmission statutory licences themselves are arcane and present challenges to an understanding of both their provenance and their current operation. In order to apply the international retransmission copyright norm to the US requires a detailed exposition of these statutory licences.

40|$|Digital {{streaming}} capabilities {{have enabled}} real-time Internet transmission of video signals. The advent of 2 ̆ 2 Webcasting 2 ̆ 2 will potentially {{change the way}} in which programming reaches audiences-increasing diversity in content as well as customer choice. Currently, cable and satellite systems secure <b>retransmission</b> <b>rights</b> to broadcast programming through statutory copyrights, and debate has ensued over whether online retransmitters should benefit from the same. This Article describes the evolution of streaming video over the Internet and examines the economic exploitation of such technology. After offering an overview of the compulsory copyright system, the Article analyzes the applicability of statutory licenses to Internet retransmissions of broadcast video signals. It concludes that compulsory copyrights and attendant regulatory restrictions should extend to real-time secondary transmissions of over-the-air broadcast programming (Internet TV). However, a free market system of negotiation would be more appropriate for Webcasting in a pay-per-view video library model...|$|R
40|$|The Cable Act of 1992 required, for {{the first}} time, that cable systems receive the consent of {{broadcast}} stations to retransmit their signals. While the fees that some stations had hoped to extract from the cable systems have generally not materialized, broadcasters {{may be able to}} use their expertise in the provision of local news and programming to gain additional cable channel space for this local-interest programming. The Author explores the historical interaction and conflict between cable systems and local broadcasters over <b>retransmission</b> <b>rights.</b> The Author also examines the courts 2 ̆ 7 and FCC 2 ̆ 7 s responses to the copyright issues surrounding retransmission.

5000|$|In {{a matter}} that {{dominated}} early discussion of the Candidates, Agon controversially tried to claim that only approved broadcasters were able to put forth the game moves in real time. However, a similar restriction was attempted by Sofia organizers first for the Topalov-Kamsky match in 2009 and then the World Chess Championship 2010, with the end result that ChessBase was found non-culpable in a resulting lawsuit. The judge in that case took only {{half an hour to}} reject all demands from the Bulgarian Chess Federation (BCF), while ChessBase relied on the legal definition of a database. The most important aspect was that the judge did not agree that a chess game {{can be seen as a}} database, and therefore the BCF could not refer to their rights as database producers. The president of the BCF, Silvio Danailov, estimated the loss at 1 million euros in a Forbes interview, though they had only asked 15000 euros from ChessVibes for <b>retransmission</b> <b>rights,</b> and crucially only spent 8000 euros themselves, which the judge found insufficiently substantiated as a realistic amount toward a database endeavor.|$|R
40|$|The thesis decscribes the {{philosophical}} foundations {{and the historical}} developments {{which led to the}} current state of law in both countries. It evaluates the substantive provisions of the two laws, its distinct aspects as well as its divergences which are a result of different philosophies underlying each national copyright system. The thesis concentrates on the following areas: definition of film, persons qualifying for authorship, duration of copyright, economic and moral rights, defences and remedies for infringement of film copyright. The impact of digitisation on copyright law and its positive and negative effects are explained. Besides, the thesis devotes itself to digital management systems. The thesis also focuses on film distribution and community policies. It describes the European provisions on free movement of goods and services and on competition law as well as the opposing influence of national copyright law. Relevant case law of the European Court of Justice is evaluated and European programmes for the audiovisual sector are described. Furthermore, international and European law, such as the Berne Convention, the Rental and Lending Right Directive, the Satellite Broadcasting and <b>Cable</b> <b>Retransmission</b> Directive, the Directive Harmonising the Term of Protection, the Information Society Directive and the Enforcement Directive are critically examined. Their influence on and the consequential changes to United Kingdom and German copyright law are analysed while special regard is taken to whether national legal understandings are appropriately appreciated.

5000|$|In September 2016, Bell Media {{issued a}} {{cease and desist}} order to Vmedia over its Roku-based IPTV service, {{demanding}} the removal of all of its networks. Canadian copyright law allows [...] "retransmitters", defined as [...] "a person who performs a function {{comparable to that of}} a <b>cable</b> <b>retransmission</b> system", to redistribute local and distant broadcast stations as part of their services. However, this only applies to IPTV services operating over private networks, because the law's definition of a retransmitter does not apply to services operating on new media platforms that are not regulated by the CRTC. Vmedia argued that its permission to redistribute these stations fell under its CRTC licensing as a television provider. Bell argued that the over-the-top service did not fall within this definition, or the formal licensing for the IPTV service offered in conjunction with its internet, and thus is a violation of their copyrights. Vmedia representative George Burger disputed Bell's arguments, stating that Canadian copyright law was [...] "technologically neutral", and that broadcasters were [...] "happy to provide that content" [...] to similar, U.S.-based services such as Sling TV. However, he also warned that VMedia {{may not be able to}} afford litigation on the matter, stating that [...] "Bell has untold millions of dollars that it can afford to spend on litigation. We're a startup. We're trying to find our way to profitability." [...] Pending the result of the lawsuit, VMedia removed CTV and CTV Two from the service.|$|R
