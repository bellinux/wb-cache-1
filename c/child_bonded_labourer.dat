50|$|In 1997, RIDE’s {{research}} {{indicated that}} the number of child labourers in the silk-weaving industry in the district of Kanchipuram exceeded 40,000. This included <b>children</b> who were <b>bonded</b> <b>labourers</b> to loom owners. RIDE undertook many activities to improve the situation of child labourers. Examples include: conducting surveys, providing information, organizing demonstrations, seminars and workshops, the support of financial alternatives and the establishment of RIDE’s Bridge School Center’s and evening schools. Working collaboratively, RIDE brought down the number of child labourers to less than 4,000 by 2007.|$|R

50|$|In 2012, a German news investigative report {{claimed that}} {{in states like}} Karnataka, {{non-governmental}} organisations had found up to 15,000 children working in the 1,100 silk factories in 1998. In other places, thousands of <b>bonded</b> <b>child</b> <b>labourers</b> were present in 1995. But today, after UNICEF and NGOs got involved, child labour figure is drastically lower, with the total estimated to be fewer than a thousand child labourers. The released children were back in school, claims the report.|$|R
5000|$|Siddartha Kara finds about 20% of carpets {{manufactured}} in India could involve child labour. He notes, [...] "determining {{the extent to}} which the hand-made carpet supply chain from India to the U.S.A. is tainted by slavery and child labour requires an additional exercise in supply chain tracing." [...] Kara's study also finds variation in child labour practices between ethnic and religious groups. Kara and colleagues report highest level of child labour in Muslim community carpet operations, and the presence of debt <b>bonded</b> <b>child</b> <b>labourers</b> in Muslim villages.|$|R

50|$|The Government of Nepal outlawed the {{practice}} of bonded labour prevalent under the Kamaiya system in July 2000, which prohibits anyone from employing any person as a <b>bonded</b> <b>labourer,</b> and declared {{that the act of}} making one work as a <b>bonded</b> <b>labourer</b> is illegal.Though democracy has been reinstated in the country, the Tharu community has called for a more inclusive democracy as they are fearful of remaining an underprivileged group.|$|R

40|$|A {{new system}} of {{employing}} girl children as `bonded labourers' in cottonseed field has come into practice {{in recent years in}} the rural South India. The main reason for this is the introduction of hybrid seed product in this area in the early 1970 s. In no other industry does one find such a high employment of girl children. Hybrid cottonseed production is concentrated in South India particularly in the Telangana and Rayalaseema regions of A. P. and Northern districts of Karnataka. The present study `Girl <b>Child</b> <b>Bonded</b> Labour in Cottonseed Fields’ shows new forms of exploitation of girl children in cottonseed farms.

50|$|A {{number of}} Javanese {{also came to}} Singapore {{with the help of}} the pilgrim brokers. They came voluntarily and a {{majority}} of them were young men who stayed in the lodgings of the pilgrim brokers until they found work. They worked as food sellers, gardeners and provided labour for the pilgrim brokers to build lodging homes for them. The pilgrim brokers also took in <b>bonded</b> <b>labourers</b> who worked for Malay or Javanese employers to clear forests to set up settlements in Johore, Malaya (Roff, 1967:37). The activities with these <b>bonded</b> <b>labourers</b> continued until the 1920s. From 1886 till 1890, as many as 21,000 Javanese became <b>bonded</b> <b>labourers</b> with the Singapore Chinese Protectorate, an organisation formed by the British in 1877 to monitor the Chinese population. They performed manual labour in the rubber plantations. After their bond ended, they continued to open up the land and stayed on in Johore.|$|R

50|$|Estimates of {{bonded labour}} in India vary widely, {{depending}} on survey methods, assumptions and sources. Official Indian government estimates claim {{a few hundred}} thousand <b>labourers</b> are <b>bonded</b> labourers; while a 1978 estimate placed bonded labour in India to be 2.62 million. The 32nd National Sample Survey Organisation survey in India estimated 343,000 <b>bonded</b> <b>labourers</b> in 16 major states, of which 285,379 were located and freed by 1996. The major employment sectors for debt bonded labour include: agriculture, stone quarries, brick kilns, religious and temple workmen, pottery, rural weaving, fishing, forestry, betel and bidi workers, carpet, illegal mining and fireworks. Child labour has been found in family debt bonded situations. In each survey, debt <b>bonded</b> <b>labourers</b> have been found in unorganised, unincorporated sector.|$|R

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{highlight}} that child labour is complementary to adult labour in the brick kiln industry. Design/methodology/approach – The paper presents a case study of <b>bonded</b> <b>labourers</b> in the brick kiln industry of Southeast India. Findings – The paper finds that child labour is used by parents in the moulding process in order to avoid falling into debt bondage. In this industry, brick making is organized as a home-based enterprise. Thus, child labour increases the family productivity and consequently its income. In case of a ban on <b>child</b> labour <b>bonded</b> parents will be worse-off. NGOs can play an essential role by preventing families from falling into bondage and by improving their living standards. Originality/value – The results may help the NGOs address child labour issues in the developing world. Children (age groups), India, Labour, Poverty...|$|R

40|$|Nepal is a {{landlocked}} mountainous {{country with}} immense diversity of caste/ethnicity and cultures. It {{consists of a}} multilingual multi-religious and multi-ethnic society. Among the 103 caste/ethnic groups, the Tharu of the Hindu caste is considered an indigenous community which is still socially, economically and educationally deprived and marginalized. It is evident that the Tharus have been surviving on agricultural labour for centuries. They have occupied only 6. 75 percent share in {{the total population of}} Nepal (CBS, 2001) These Tharus of the Tarai region have been working as the <b>bonded</b> <b>labourers</b> (kamaiyas) in the house of landlords. The overwhelming majority of the bonded labours are from the Tharu ethnic group (Awasthi, 2005, Ojha, 1982). The Tharu <b>bonded</b> <b>labourers</b> are mainly concentrated in the Tarai region of Nepal and they constitute more than 98 percent of the total Kamaiyas (INSEC 1990). The vast majority of labourers are from the native community of the mid and far western Tarai religions of Nepal. This native group used to transmit bondage from one generation to another (Subedi 1999). The Tharus had emigrated from India during the Muslim invasion in the twelfth century.
