5|$|I {{certainly}} don't see gay {{and lesbian}} history starting with Stonewall... and I don't see resistance starting with Stonewall. What I do see is a historical coming together of forces, and the sixties changed how human beings endured things in this society and what they refused to endure... <b>Certainly</b> <b>something</b> special happened on that night in 1969, and we've made it more special in our need to have what I call a point of origin... it's more complex than saying that {{it all started with}} Stonewall.|$|E
500|$|The {{album was}} re-released in a 40th anniversary edition on 31 October 2011. The release {{contains}} a new stereo and 5.1 surround remix {{of the album}} by British musician and producer Steven Wilson, and comes in two different editions—a [...] "collector's edition" [...] containing the album on LP and two CDs, as well as DVD and Blu-ray discs and a hardback book; and a [...] "special edition" [...] containing the two CDs and an abridged version of the book. Justifying the remix, Steven Wilson said: [...] "Jethro Tull's Aqualung is... a masterpiece, but was sonically a very poor-sounding record. So, some didn't rate it as highly as they should have. What we did with Aqualung was really make that record gleam {{in a way it}} never gleamed before. I think a lot of people, including myself, have come around to thinking that the album is a lot better than they even gave it credit for previously. So, there is <b>certainly</b> <b>something</b> very gratifying about being able to polish what was already a diamond and making it shine in a way it never has before". Additionally, according to mastering engineer Steve Hoffman there were tape stretching problems with the original session mixdown master, implying that many editions of the album used multigeneration copies as their source.|$|E
500|$|The song {{received}} overwhelming critical acclaim, subsequently being {{cited as}} one of the greatest songs of the 2000s. Chris True from AllMusic picked the song as a highlight of Fever, commenting that it [...] "pulses and grooves like no other she's [...] recorded." [...] Jason Thompson from PopMatters described Minogue's vocals as a [...] "sexual come on" [...] and called the song [...] "trim and funky, <b>certainly</b> <b>something</b> that couldn't miss anywhere." [...] Dominique Leone from Pitchfork Media praised the commercial prospect of the song, saying that it [...] "exudes a catchiness that belies its inherent simplicity, so reassuring during an era when chart acts sound increasingly baroque and producers race to see who can ape electronic music trends first." [...] Jim Farber from Entertainment Weekly said that the song [...] "fully lives up to its title" [...] with [...] "every sound a hook," [...] and compared it to the works of Andrea True. Michael Hubbard from MusicOMH labelled the song [...] "one of 2001's best singles," [...] saying that it [...] "predictably beat off lesser 'competition.'" [...] In 2012, The Guardian critic Everett True defined [...] "Can't Get You Out of My Head" [...] as [...] "one of those rare moments in pop: sleek and chic and stylish and damnably danceable, but with a darker element hidden in plain sight." [...] Billboards Jason Lipshutz felt that [...] "the metallic production wouldn't carry quite as much of its impact if Minogue had attempted to outshine it; wisely, her voice operates alongside it, finding renewed power in its drive", concluding that [...] "almost 15 years after its release, it still sounds fresh, forward-thinking and alive".|$|E

2500|$|The RAAF {{has shown}} {{interest}} in acquiring armed unmanned drones. Air Marshal Geoff Brown stated that [...] "it is <b>certainly</b> <b>something</b> {{we have put}} forward" [...] and that the Reaper {{was one of the}} force's highest priorities. As of February 2015 six ADF personnel are currently training on the General Atomics MQ-9 Reaper in two USAF bases. The RAAF is willing to spend A$300million on the platform and is believed to be preparing to purchase eight drones and two ground stations. In March 2017, it was reported that the acquisition program had been singled down to two UAV platforms: the MQ-9 Reaper and the IAI Heron. In September 2017, IAI accused the Australian government of giving preferential treatment to General Atomics.|$|E
2500|$|People in the {{community}} seem to take pride in Teaneck's high rate of Aliyah to Israel. It's <b>certainly</b> <b>something</b> to be proud of. But we make {{no mention of the}} equally high rates (maybe even higher rates) of [...] "yerida" [...] from Israel to Teaneck. My feeling is these 'yordim' should not be accorded honors in our synagogues or schools. These people are the antithesis of what we want to teach our children, of how we want to live. For most religious Zionists, of which Teaneck has more than a few, the goal is to end up in Israel. Having [...] "yordim" [...] as community leaders here is bad public policy. Recently, one of the largest synagogues in town installed a [...] "yored" [...] as its president. Our schools honor [...] "yordim" [...] on a regular basis at their dinners. [...] "Yordim" [...] make up a large percentage of our school's Hebrew teachers.|$|E
2500|$|Michael Billington {{reviewing}} in The Times {{was much}} more favourable to the ITV coverage. He said they had [...] "seized the initiative" [...] off the BBC. [...] "In the past {{it has always been}} the BBC that has been ready to abandon its schedules to suit historic public events: yesterday, however, the traditional roles were reversed and it was the BBC that persevered with Dr. Finlay's Casebook and The Black and White Minstrel Show while independent television showed itself far more flexible and enterprising." [...] He praised Frost for the way he [...] "chaired the proceedings with his usual unflappable professionalism" [...] and Burnett for [...] "combining straight news with personal comment", though he said [...] "the combination of news and variety is more debatable. There is <b>certainly</b> <b>something</b> a bit strange about going straight from a discussion about the orbit of Luna 15 to hearing Cilla Black singing her latest recording. On balance, I think this type of juxtaposition is justified, if only because some point of rest is needed in a programme of this length. The danger is that the viewer will be so saturated with information that his responses will be blunted {{when it comes to the}} moments of real excitement: pop music, however, provides the necessary let-up and fulfills much the same function as comic relief in a five-act drama.|$|E

2500|$|In {{at least}} one case, Chang Wang, the {{president}} of Acu-Gen, has phoned a pregnant woman one month after giving her the sex prediction to inform her that her test indicated an [...] "excess of genetic material in her blood" [...] and advised her to see her doctor in order [...] "to rule out problems like Down's syndrome or Trisomy 18". Wang explains this means [...] "with a certain possibility, that her fetus {{has a kind of}} genetic problem. Of course later on, we had used our technology to prove that she has a chromosome problem: Trisomy 18. That means that this baby [...] going to have a developmental problem and is going to probably cease to exist right after the birth." [...] Dr. Diana Bianchi of Tufts disputes the possibility of the test being used for such a diagnosis. She says, [...] "The test involves looking at genetic sequences on the X chromosome and the Y chromosome. If he gave a diagnosis of Trisomy 18, that involves a different chromosome, Chromosome 18. That is <b>certainly</b> <b>something</b> that is not advertised in the packaging associated with the test. [...] "It is possible that, upon being told of a problem by Acu-Gen, a woman may seek to have an amniocentesis or other invasive procedure which may be an unnecessary risk if the Acu-Gen diagnosis was in error. In this case, the woman delivered a healthy baby free from both Trisomy 18 and Down syndrome.|$|E

6000|$|Wilson's blood warmed a little, and he {{wondered}} if he had been played upon by those strangers; it <b>certainly</b> had <b>something</b> of that look. But what could they gain by it? He threw out that suggestion. Tom replied: ...|$|R
