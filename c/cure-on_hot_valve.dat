5000|$|The band {{comprised}} vocalist and guitarist Willie Gardner (previously in <b>Hot</b> <b>Valves),</b> and ex-PVC2 members, bassist Russell Webb, keyboardist Billy McIsaac {{and drummer}} Kenny Hyslop. Their next single, [...] "Sign of the Times" [...] was released shortly afterwards in Arista Records.|$|R
50|$|His {{earliest}} known {{band was}} The <b>Hot</b> <b>Valves,</b> formed in 1976. The band {{was influenced by}} Bill Nelson and Mick Ronson, and their name was taken from a Be-Bop Deluxe EP. They were Gardner on guitars and lead vocals, Coling King on drums, and Danny Mitchell on keyboards (the latter two later of Modern Man and Messengers), and split up in 1977.|$|R
40|$|The {{vortex tube}} or Ranque–Hilsch vortex tube {{is a simple}} device used in {{industry}} for generation of cold and hot air streams from a single compressed air supply. It consists of nozzle, vortex chamber, separating cold plate, <b>hot</b> <b>valve,</b> <b>hot</b> and cold end tube without any moving parts. As the temperature difference decreases as the nozzle aspect ratio increases some research used the dry air as working fluid. Compare the CFD model with the experimental measurement uses different diameter D, 2 D, 0. 5 D, 0. 25 D, 0. 125 D from that they conclude that for small diameter has worst performance...|$|R
5000|$|Subsequently, in October 1976, [...] "Maid in Heaven" [...] reached number 36 in the UK singles charts as {{the lead}} track on the <b>Hot</b> <b>Valves</b> EP. The American market was harder to break for British acts during the 1970s due to the {{hangover}} from the 1960s and problems with availability of records in the US for breaking acts such as Be-Bop Deluxe, whose first album Axe Victim was only available as an import.|$|R
50|$|Gibson {{produced}} Epiphone amplifiers in the 1960s. These {{were basically}} copies or variations of Gibson and Fender amplifiers. They used a tube design, and some had reverb and tremolo. Gibson decided {{to launch a}} new line of Epiphone amplifiers in 2005 with many different models, including the So Cal, Blues Custom, and the Epiphone Valve Junior. The <b>Valve</b> <b>Hot</b> Rod and <b>Valve</b> Senior were released in 2009. The <b>Valve</b> <b>Hot</b> Rod is a 5 watt amp like the Valve Junior, but has a gain and reverb control. The Valve Senior offers 20 watts of power, with a full equalizer, gain, volume, reverb, and presence control.|$|R

50|$|Valve burn (overheating) {{is another}} problem. It causes {{excessive}} valve wear and defective sealing, {{as well as}} engine knocking (the <b>hot</b> <b>valve</b> causes the fuel to prematurely ignite). It can be solved by valve cooling systems that use water or oil as a coolant. In high performance or turbo charged engines sometimes sodium filled valve stems are used. These valve stems then act as a heat pipe. A major cause of burnt valves {{is a lack of}} valve clearance at the tappet; the valve cannot completely close. This reduces its ability to conduct heat to the cylinder head via the seat, and may allow hot combustion gases to flow between the valve and its seat. Burnt valves will cause a low compression in the affected cylinder and loss of power.|$|R
50|$|Some VAV boxes {{also have}} <b>hot</b> water <b>valves</b> and an {{internal}} heat exchanger. The <b>valves</b> for <b>hot</b> and cold water are opened or closed {{based on the}} heat demand for the spaces it is supplying. These heated VAV boxes are sometimes used on the perimeter only and the interior zones are cooling only.|$|R
50|$|An {{optional}} high-performance 4-barrel Sprint version featured high-compression pistons, <b>hotter</b> cam, dual <b>valve</b> springs, split/dual exhaust manifold, stronger coil, and {{the then}} new Quadrajet carburetor.|$|R
50|$|Analog outputs {{control the}} speed or {{position}} of a device, such as a variable frequency drive, an I-P (current to pneumatics) transducer, or a valve or damper actuator. An example is a <b>hot</b> water <b>valve</b> opening up 25% to maintain a setpoint. Another example is a variable frequency drive ramping up a motor slowly to avoid a hard start.|$|R
5000|$|Carbon {{deposits}} form a {{heat barrier}} {{and can be}} a contributing factor to pre-ignition. Other causes include: An overheated spark plug (too hot a heat range for the application).

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{the design of}} an Egg machine Controller for an egg washing machine. It is capable of controlling <b>hot</b> water <b>valve</b> and speed of the conveyer belt. The control depends on dirt level and the quantity of the eggs loaded on conveyer belt; the machine does it automatically in absence of an operator using Fuzzy Logic Controller. The machine is controlled with two fuzzy controllers. First fuzzy controller controls the <b>hot</b> water <b>valve</b> {{and it is an}} open loop with no feedback signal. For the dirty eggs, more pressured hot water will be applied. The speed of the belt also will be reduced to increase the time to apply water. The second fuzzy controller is designed to operate in three speeds automatically adjusted depending on the quantity of the eggs on the belt fed ready to be washed and tracked to maintain the desired speed under varying damping conditions because of the load...|$|R
50|$|Tetraethyl lead {{works as}} a buffer against microwelds forming between the <b>hot</b> exhaust <b>valves</b> and their seats. Once these valves reopen, the microwelds pull apart and leave the valves with a rough surface that would abrade the seats, leading to valve recession. When lead began to be phased out of motor fuel, the {{automotive}} industry began specifying hardened valve seats and upgraded exhaust valve materials to prevent valve recession without lead.|$|R
5000|$|The less {{efficient}} type of air-handler is a [...] "constant volume air handling unit," [...] or CAV. The fans in CAVs {{do not have}} variable-speed controls. Instead, CAVs open and close dampers and water-supply valves to maintain temperatures in the building's spaces. They heat or cool the spaces by opening or closing chilled or <b>hot</b> water <b>valves</b> that feed their internal heat exchangers. Generally one CAV serves several spaces.|$|R
40|$|The vortex tube, {{invented by}} G. J. Ranque, {{is a simple}} device which {{separates}} a flow of compressed gas into a hot and a cold stream {{by means of a}} high speed vortex. It may have useful applications as a refrigerator and one of the aims of the present investigation was to widen the field of application by increasing the vortex tube's cooling performance. The tests, described in this report, determined the effect of the <b>hot</b> <b>valve</b> setting, the cold outlet diameter, the inlet nozzle size and the inlet pressure ratios, upon the temperature drop ratio characteristics of a vortex tube. The results show that, by matching the inlet nozzles and cold outlet diameter to the inlet pressure ratio, it is possible to obtain, over a wide pressure range, a temperature drop which is 0. 50 of the isentropic temperature drop. The optimum cold outlet area is almost independent of the inlet pressure, whilst the optimum inlet area decreases as the pressure ratio increases.

50|$|This {{design was}} {{developed}} by Malcolm Beare of Australia. The technology combines a four-stroke engine bottom end with an opposed piston in the cylinder head working at half the cyclical rate of the bottom piston. Functionally, the second piston replaces the valve mechanism of a conventional engine. Claimed benefits include a 9% increase in power, and improved thermodynamic efficiency through an increased compression ratio enabled by {{the elimination of the}} <b>hot</b> exhaust <b>valve.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{combustion}} chamber formed with the sleeve {{at the top}} of its stroke is ideal for complete, detonation-free, combustion of the charge, as it does not have to contend with compromised chamber shape and <b>hot</b> exhaust (poppet) <b>valves.</b>|$|R
30|$|This {{apparently}} surprising {{result can}} be explained by the opening mechanisms of both valves, and the operation principles of the Stark decelerator. The NPV is activated using only small voltages, and a moderate power of about 1 W is dissipated in the valve. This results in only a modest change of the beam’s mean speed during the opening of the valve, i.e., the beam that is formed when the valve just opens is about the same as the mean speed that is found at later times. This behavior is very different for the JV. Here, large currents are needed to open the valve, resulting in significant power dissipation (about 20 W) and a <b>hot</b> <b>valve</b> body. Moreover, as the valve opens, gas flows through the hot current conductors, locally cooling the conductors. As a result, the mean speed of the beam shows a strong gradient during the valve opening time [42]. When the valve just opens, the beam is very fast. The later the molecules leave the valve, the lower their mean speed will be. The slowest mean speeds are found when the valve is almost fully closed. Here, beam speeds that are expected for room temperature expansions are found [42].|$|R
5000|$|The Johnson Electric Service Company was {{established}} in 1885 in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Johnson’s most notable contribution to temperature control was the automatic multi-zone temperature control system - a pneumatic system that used a bi-metal thermostat to control air flow through a nozzle and thereby operate a pilot regulator. The amplified air signal from the regulator was then used to control a steam or <b>hot</b> water <b>valve</b> on a heat exchanger, or to control a damper of a forced air system. He received a patent for the system in 1895.|$|R
5000|$|In 1926, Delage {{introduced}} the DM, with a [...] (75 by 120 mm) six, {{which made it}} emblematic of the era for the marque. The high-performance DMS had <b>hotter</b> cam, twin <b>valve</b> springs, and other improvements. A DR, {{with a choice of}} 2.2- and 2.5-liter sidevalve engines, also briefly appeared.|$|R
40|$|The {{vortex tube}} is device, which {{produces}} {{hot and cold}} air streams simultaneously at its two ends from a source of compressed air without any moving part. Literature review {{of this paper is}} to understand the effect of various parameters like inlet pressure of air, number of nozzles, cold orifice diameter and <b>hot</b> end <b>valve</b> angle on the performance of vortex tube. Also by the literature review it is clear that there is no theory so perfect, which gives the satisfactory explanation of the vortex tube phenomenon. Due to this reason researcher conduct the series of experimentation to understand the effect of various parameters mentioned above on the performance of vortex tube...|$|R
50|$|In 1936 and 1937, the Indian Four had {{the valve}} {{positions}} reversed, with the exhaust valve {{in the head}} and the inlet valve in the block. In theory, this would improve fuel vaporization, and the engine was actually more powerful. However, the new system made the cylinder head very <b>hot.</b> The exhaust <b>valve</b> linkage required frequent adjustment. The design was returned to the original IOE configuration in 1938.|$|R
40|$|We have {{developed}} off-line experimental techniques and apparatuses that permit direct measurement of effusive-flow delay-times and ionization efficiencies for nearly any chemically reactive element in high-temperature target/ion sources (TISs) commonly used for on-line radioactive ion beam (RIB) generation. The apparatuses include a <b>hot</b> Ta <b>valve</b> for effusive-flow delay-time measurements, a cooled molecular-injection system for determination of ionization efficiencies and a gas-flow measurement/control system for introducing very low, well-defined molecular {{flows into the}} TIS. Measurements are performed on a test-stand using molecular feed compounds containing stable complements of the radioactive nuclei of interest delivered to the TIS at flow-rates commensurate with on-line RIB generation. In this report, the general techniques are described and effusive-flow delay-times and ionization efficiency measurements are reported for fluorine in an electron-beam-plasma target/ion source (EBPTIS) developed for RIB generation and operated in {{both positive and negative}} ion extraction modes...|$|R

50|$|The {{rationale}} behind the single sleeve valve design was two-fold: to provide optimum {{intake and exhaust}} gas flow in a two-row radial engine, improving its volumetric efficiency; and to allow higher compression ratios, thus improving its thermal efficiency. The arrangement of the cylinders in two-row radials made {{it very difficult to}} utilise four valves per cylinder, consequently all non-sleeve valve two- and four-row radials were limited to the less efficient two-valve configuration. Also, as combustion chambers of sleeve-valve engines are uncluttered by <b>valves,</b> especially the <b>hot</b> exhaust <b>valves,</b> being comparatively smooth they allow engines to work with lower octane number fuels using the same compression ratio. Conversely, the same octane number fuel may be utilised while employing a higher compression ratio, or supercharger pressure, thus attaining either higher economy, or power output. The downside was the difficulty in maintaining sufficient cylinder and sleeve lubrication.|$|R

The existing cooling system is oversized and uneffective. This gave opportunity to create a brand new system, that would lower operating expenses. The {{first part of the}} thesis is dedicated to comparsion between both systems from the point of the total pressure loss. The second part of the thesis deals with hydraulic optimisation of the new system. Computations are modelled in CFD...|$|R
50|$|Engine {{bleed air}} is {{admitted}} through a {{flow control valve}} to a heat exchanger. The cabin temperature is controlled by regulating {{the temperature of the}} pressure bleed air that is routed through the cabin. The bleed air is cooled in the heat exchanger by ram air entering the dorsal fin inlet and passing through the heat exchanger. The amount of bleed air cooling at the heat exchanger can be controlled by the <b>hot</b> air bypass <b>valve</b> (H-valve). The H-valve position can be adjusted by the crew to increase or reduce the amount of bleed air cooling at the heat exchanger.|$|R

This spin-valve transistor employs hot-electron transport across a Ni 81 Fe 19 /Au/Co spin <b>valve.</b> <b>Hot</b> electrons are injected into the spin valve across a Si–Pt Schottky barrier. After traversing the spin <b>valve,</b> these <b>hot</b> electrons are collected using a second Schottky barrier (Si–Au), which provides energy and momentum selection.

5000|$|In {{response}} to the growing interest in aviation in France after the Wright brothers' visit in 1908, Anzani produced {{the first of a}} series of three-cylinder fan flight engines. The cylinders were each a single iron casting and the one-piece crankcase was aluminium. [...] Pistons were steel with cast rings. In most of these the outer cylinders were at 60° to the central one, though a contemporary diagram shows one, described as the cross channel engine, with a 55° angle. They were all air-cooled side-valve engines; each exhaust valve was controlled from below by a cam in the crankcase. Each was mounted in a cell to the side of the cylinder, with the automatic, atmospheric pressure -driven spring-loaded inlet valve immediately above it, partly to minimise volume and partly to help cool the <b>hot</b> exhaust <b>valve.</b> Most contemporary and pre-1921 sources agree that the bores of these early engines were between 100 and 105 mm (3.93 and 4.13 in), but strokes between 120 and 150 mm (4.72 and 5.90 in) are quoted. Most put the output of these engines at about 18 kW (24 hp) at around 1,400-1,600 rpm.|$|R
40|$|Opposed to a {{conventional}} approach of using ethanol in a spark-ignition engine, this study demonstrates a potential of ethanol utilization in a diesel engine using dual-fuel combustion strategy where ethanol is {{injected into the}} intake manifold and diesel is directly injected into the combustion chamber. The main focus {{of this study is}} the effect of ethanol port fuel injector (PFI) sprays on dual-fuel combustion and emissions. Firstly, details of temporal and spatial development of ethanol PFI sprays were studied using Mie-scattering and high-speed shadowgraph imaging techniques. Momentum flux-based injection rate measurement was also performed. The influences of fuel flow-rate, injection duration, and ambient air cross-flow are of particular interest in an effort to understand ethanol PFI spray characteristics that are relevant to automobile engines. Ethanol sprays are also studied for various PFI positions to examine the potential effect of droplets-airflow interaction and wall wetting. With the clear understanding on ethanol PFI sprays, dual-fuel engine experiments were conducted for various ethanol energy ratios and PFI positions. It is found that the effect of PFI position on global phenomena such as in-cylinder pressure, apparent heat release rate and mean effective pressure is much less significant than the effect of ethanol energy fraction. However, the misfiring limit shows measurable difference such that the PFI position closer to the intake valves results in 10 % higher ethanol energy fraction than that of the further upstream position. Reduced wall-wetting due to surface boiling occurring on the <b>hot</b> <b>valve</b> seat is suggested as a possible cause, which is consistent with 30 % lower carbon monoxide and 64 % lower unburnt hydrocarbon emissions. Detailed investigation for various ethanol energy fractions was also conducted. From the in-cylinder pressure measurements, it is found that the increased ethanol energy fraction increases the engine efficiency up to 10 % until it is limited by misfiring. The results are compared to diesel-only operation with varying injection timings in order to explain whether the increased efficiency is due to the combustion phasing or improved combustion associated with fast burning of ethanol. Further analysis of the data reveals that the latter is the primary cause for the efficiency gain. By advancing the diesel injection timing, it is found that the maximum ethanol fraction can be extended to 70 % without the misfiring problem but 20 % increase in nitrogen oxide emissions is also observed, which raises a question on the advantages of utilizing ethanol in a diesel engine. However, negligible smoke emissions are measured at ethanol energy ratio of 20 % or higher suggesting that optimization of these emissions is much easier compared with conventional diesel combustion...|$|R
30|$|If {{a person}} {{short-circuited}} the secondary tract, {{he would be}} shocked until the current interrupter or fuse tripped, or somebody switched off the system. According to Table  3, currents normally used for diagnostic systems would often be larger than the fibrillation thresholds shown in Tables  1 and 2. Also, smaller systems—designed for maximum currents of a few tens of mA—might have easily exceeded these thresholds when short-circuited [37]. The transformer current could be limited when a person came in series with a Coolidge tube or a <b>hot</b> cathode rectifying <b>valve.</b> In the first case, the maximum current was {{equal to that of}} the X-ray tube, in the second case the current would be likely slightly larger than the maximum current the system could deliver under normal circumstances.|$|R
40|$|The H-Canyon at Savannah River Site {{is a large}} {{concrete}} structure designed for chemical separation processes of radioactive material. The facility requires a large ventilation system to maintain negative pressure in process areas for radioactive contamination control and personnel protection. The ventilation exhaust is directed through a concrete tunnel under the facility which is approximately five feet wide and 8 feet tall {{that leads to a}} sand filter and stack. Acidic vapors in the exhaust have had a degrading effect {{on the surface of the}} concrete tunnels. Some areas have been inspected; however, the condition of other areas is unknown. Experience from historical inspections with remote controlled vehicles will be discussed along with the current challenge of inspecting levels below available access points. The area of interest in the exhaust tunnel must be accessed through a 14 X 14 inch concrete plug in the floor of the <b>hot</b> gang <b>valve</b> corridor. The purpose for the inspection is to determine the condition of the inside of the air tunnel and establish if there are any structural concerns.

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the improved cold deck settings under current mechanical conditions {{as well as the}} optimal cold deck settings when the current mechanical problems are solved. Improvements to the cold deck setting can be made prior to any mechanical repairing. The improved cold deck setting can reduce annual energy cost by $ 101, 400 /yr. Terminal reheat leakage and excessive air flow are the major problems in this building. These problems caused excessive energy consumption as well as personal comfort complaints. We recommend that the air flow be balanced and repairs to the leaking <b>hot</b> water <b>valves</b> in the terminal boxes be made.

40|$|Controllable solid {{propulsion}} systems have distinctive combustion and acoustic environments that require enhanced testing and analysis techniques to progress {{this new technology}} from development to production.
