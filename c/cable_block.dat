These components must respect geometrical tolerances of ± 30 micrometers. Non-nominal copper wedge dimensions change the position of <b>cables</b> <b>blocks</b> and therefore affect field quality. In this paper we present the measurements of the copper wedges used in the main LHC dipoles. We then evaluate the influence of copper wedge dimensions on field quality, comparing it to the warm magnetic measurements of the collared coils.

40|$|Studies {{have shown}} that the {{connection}} details used for <b>cable</b> anchorage <b>blocks</b> on cable-stayed bridges have the potential for fatigue damage due to fluctuating stresses generated by the cyclic traffic loads passing over the bridge. To investigate the fatigue damage and determine the remaining fatigue life of a <b>cable</b> anchorage <b>block</b> used on a cable-stayed bridge, finite element (FE) analyses were undertaken by using the Fatigue Load Model 4 (FLM 4) proposed by the Eurocodes to identify the most fatigue-critical locations within the details. One of the main objectives of this research was to identify the critical area prone to fatigue in the anchorage block due to the response in traffic loads. Therefore, two types of numerical models of a typical <b>cable</b> anchorage <b>block</b> were analysed as a three dimensional sub-model which was driven by global cable forces obtained from the global analysis of a three-span cable-stayed bridge. These models are of the <b>cable</b> anchorage <b>block</b> without the longitudinal girder modelled and the <b>cable</b> anchorage <b>block</b> with the longitudinal girder modelled. The <b>cable</b> anchorage <b>blocks</b> without the longitudinal girder model were classified into three categories of model types namely; model types 0, A and B. Similarly, the <b>cable</b> anchorage <b>blocks</b> with the longitudinal girder model were classified as model types A-G, B-G and C-G. These model classifications are based on several boundary conditions simulated in the analyses. In addition to this, the fatigue behaviour of the <b>cable</b> anchorage <b>block</b> was analysed by using three different approaches namely; by using the nodal stresses at the location of the stress concentration (node stress concentration), by using a stress averaged over an area {{in the vicinity of the}} stress concentration (average elements) and by using the hot-spot method, in order to identify the stress ranges that adversely affect the remaining fatigue life of cable anchorages. Each approach was analysed with three different mesh sizes; 5 mm by 5 mm, 10 mm by 10 mm and 20 mm by 20 mm in order to carry out a mesh sensitivity analysis of the resulting stresses and associated stress ranges. The 10 mm by 10 mm mesh size was found to be most appropriate for this fatigue appraisal. This finding is supported because the 10 mm by 10 mm mesh size is specified in several code of practices such as the International Institute of Welding (IIW) and BS 7608 as guidance for use when determining hot-spot stress when using the hot-spot method for the fatigue analyses of a welded detail. The critical stresses from model type C-G were used in the fatigue appraisal as the behaviour of this model represented more accurately the actual <b>cable</b> anchorage <b>block</b> on the cable-stayed bridge compared to the other types of models used. Model type C-G were selected for further fatigue appraisal as this model include the correct boundary conditions and applied load that represented the actual condition of the anchorage behaviour on the cable-stayed bridge. This included the movement of the top anchorage block due to the displacement of the cable and in addition the deck movement. Also, non-uniform pressure was applied on the bearing plate which was included to model possible construction tolerances which was one of the important properties of the model type C-G. In evaluating the possible fatigue damage in the <b>cable</b> anchorage <b>block,</b> the cumulative model for fatigue failure expressed in terms of Miner’s rule was used. In addition to this, the condition of the structural detail due to fatigue with increasing traffic loading was determined by projecting traffic volume increases of up to 20...|$|R

40|$|Cables {{that are}} not {{longitudinally}} water blocked are vulnerable to water ingress over long lengths of hundreds of meters or more. In these events, electric utilities and/or cable producers may suffer high cable replacement costs or delays caused by long cable lead times or right-of-way problems. Conversely, properly water <b>blocked</b> <b>cables</b> limit water ingress to a distance of typically less than 1 meter. Recently, <b>cable</b> and water <b>blocking</b> material producers have witnessed and reacted to a clear industry trend towards complete longitudinal water <b>blocking</b> of power <b>cables,</b> including the conductor, rather than the traditional requirement for “screen only ” water blocking.
