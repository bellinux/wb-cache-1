25|$|The {{spacecraft}} carries two computer systems: the Command and Data Handling {{system and}} the Guidance and <b>Control</b> <b>processor.</b> Each of the two systems is duplicated for redundancy, {{for a total of}} four computers. The processor used for its flight computers is the Mongoose-V, a 12 MHz radiation-hardened version of the MIPS R3000 CPU. Multiple redundant clocks and timing routines are implemented in hardware and software to help prevent faults and downtime. To conserve heat and mass, spacecraft and instrument electronics are housed together in IEMs (integrated electronics modules). There are two redundant IEMs. Including other functions such as instrument and radio electronics, each IEM contains 9boards. The software of the probe runs on Nucleus RTOS operating system.|$|E

The main goal of Central <b>Controlling</b> <b>Processor</b> is synchronizing the process at optimal using of the resources. In this paper we call the Central <b>Controlling</b> <b>Processor</b> as a leader many different algorithms have been presented for leader election. The most important leader election algorithms are the Bully and Ring algorithms. Ring election algorithm is one of the classic method which is used to virtual ring and determine the process with highest number as the coordinator, {{and one of the most}} important leader election algorithm is the Bully algorithm. In this paper we will describe novel approaches with fault tolerant method to improve the Bully and Ring algorithms. Our simulation shows that our algorithm is more efficient rather than the Ring algorithm in number of message passing. By doing this, performance and behavior will be improved and message passing will be reduced. 1...|$|R

The backup <b>control</b> <b>processor</b> had {{suffered}} a previously undetected anomaly, and PanAmSat {{was not able to}} regain control of the spacecraft. Galaxy IV was declared a loss on May 20, 1998. Failure of the primary <b>control</b> <b>processor</b> was attributed to tin whisker growth, a phenomenon in which tendrils grow from solder, causing an electrical short circuit. Engineers believe that a hole developed in the conformal wax coating over the solder, allowing whiskers to develop. The satellite manufacturer, Hughes, has replaced pure tin plating with nickel to alleviate the problem in newer designs, adding 45 to 90 kg per payload.|$|E
