40|$|International audienceConsiderable {{progress}} has been made recently to promote glue-laminated beams of European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) for load-bearing structures in engineering. However, further investigations into the bond durability are required. The objective {{of the present study was}} to analyse material and manufacturing factors and their combination to improve the resistance in delamination tests as required for the use in building service class 1. * In the experimental work, the influence of selected wood properties, manufacturing conditions, and the effect of a hydroxy-methylated resorcinol primer on the delamination resistance of beech glulams bonded under laboratory and industrial conditions with a melamine-urea-formaldehyde adhesive were investigated. * The highest delamination resistance of the laboratory samples was achieved with the smallest lamellae thicknesses of 29 mm. A <b>closed</b> <b>assembly</b> <b>time</b> of more than 30 min and the use of the primer further enhanced the bond durability. Higher delamination rates observed in glulams manufactured industrially were related to the relatively thick (38 mm) and often twisted beech lamellae used. * The results suggested that bond durability required for service class 1 can be attained by restricting lamella thickness in beech glulam to a maximum of 30 mm and by using a minimum <b>closed</b> <b>assembly</b> <b>time</b> of 40 min...|$|E
40|$|A {{feasibility}} study of glulam {{was carried out}} in French Guiana using local wood species. The aim was to determine gluing parameters affording satisfactory behaviour to manufactured glulam in a tropical climate. Three abundant wood species, with special properties, were selected for the study and resorcinol-phenol-formaldehyde resin was used for bonding. Three industrial parameters were considered: adhesive spread rate, <b>closed</b> <b>assembly</b> <b>time</b> and gluing pressure. Delamination and shearing tests were carried out in accordance with European Standards. The tests revealed the influence of wood properties and manufacturing parameters on joint resistance. In fact, the results showed that specific gravity and the shrinkage coefficient greatly influenced the gluing step. Indeed, wood with a medium specific gravity needed more adhesive and more pressure than wood with a high specific gravity. In addition, planing and lamella thickness were found to affect glue joint resistance. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|E
40|$|Two {{methods for}} {{performing}} statistical tolerance analysis of mechanical assemblies are compared: the Direct Linearization Method (DLM), and Monte Carlo simulation. A selection of 2 -D and 3 -D vector models of assemblies were analyzed, including problems with <b>closed</b> loop <b>assembly</b> constraints. <b>Closed</b> vector loops describe the small kinematic adjustments that occur at <b>assembly</b> <b>time.</b> Open loops describe critical clearances or other assembly features. The DLM uses linearized assembly constraints and matrix algebra {{to estimate the}} variations of the assembly or kinematic variables, and to predict assembly rejects. A modified Monte Carlo simulation, employing an iterative technique for <b>closed</b> loop <b>assemblies,</b> {{was applied to the}} same problem set. The results of the comparison show that the DLM is accurate if the tolerances are relatively small compared to the nominal dimensions of the components, and the assembly functions are not highly nonlinear.

40|$|Abstract. The {{purpose of}} this paper is to assess the impact of timer-based burst {{assembly}} algorithms for TCP traffic. We present an analysis for short, medium and long <b>assembly</b> <b>times</b> and investigate segment and flow distribution over the assembled bursts. Further, we also analyze their impact on the congestion window evolution and on the effective throughput achieved. It has been found out that short <b>assembly</b> <b>times</b> are ideally suitable for sources with small congestion windows, allowing for a speed up, while large <b>assembly</b> <b>times</b> yield a lower throughput variation among the individual assembled flows. For long <b>assembly</b> <b>times,</b> the transfer of more segments from the same source is trading off the increase of the burstification delay but no throughput gain is obtained. However, large <b>assembly</b> <b>times</b> smooth out individual flow performance and provide a significant lower variation of throughput. To this end, in this paper, we propose a new adaptive burst assembly algorithm that dynamically assigns flows to different burstifiers based on their instant window size...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{the research and}} development of two <b>assembly</b> <b>time</b> estimation techniques for the automotive industry. Both of these techniques are capable of being implemented early in the product life-cycle of a vehicle and require information available in this phase. Currently, <b>assembly</b> <b>time</b> estimation is performed after production has begun and is a tedious manual process requiring hours of motion-time method studies for each assembly activity. The techniques proposed in this thesis can both be performed {{prior to the start of}} production and are capable of being performed automatically after the initial mapping. The first <b>assembly</b> <b>time</b> estimation technique maps the complexity of the product connectivity graph to an <b>assembly</b> <b>time.</b> Twenty-nine metrics have been proposed for the complexity measurement of product connectivity graphs.

40|$|<b>Assembly</b> <b>time</b> {{estimation}} {{is traditionally}} a time-intensive manual process that requires detailed geometric and process information, {{which is often}} subjective and qualitative in nature. As a result, <b>assembly</b> <b>time</b> estimation is rarely applied during early design iterations. In this paper, the authors explore the possibility of automating the <b>assembly</b> <b>time</b> estimation process while reducing the level of design detail required. In this approach, they train artificial neural networks (ANNs) to estimate the <b>assembly</b> <b>times</b> of vehicle sub-assemblies using either assembly connectivity or liaison graph properties, respectively as input data. The effectiveness of estimation is evaluated based {{on the distribution of}} estimates provided by a population of ANNs trained on the same input data using varying initial conditions.

40|$|Abstract. DNA tile {{self-assembly}} {{has emerged}} as a rich and promising primitive for nano-technology. This paper studies the problems of minimizing <b>assembly</b> <b>time</b> and error rate by changing the tile concentrations because changing the tile concentrations is easy to implement in actual lab experiments. We prove that setting the concentration of tile Ti proportional to the square root of Ni where Ni is the number of times Ti appears outside the seed structure in the final assembled shape minimizes the rate of growth errors for rectilinear tile systems. We also show that the same concentrations minimize the expected <b>assembly</b> <b>time</b> for a feasible class of tile systems. Moreover, for general tile systems, given tile concentrations, we can approximate the expected <b>assembly</b> <b>time</b> with high accuracy and probability by running only a polynomial number of simulations {{in the size of the}} target shape...|$|R

40|$|A chip shooter {{machine for}} {{electronic}} component assembly has a movable feeder carrier, a movable X–Y table carrying {{a printed circuit}} board (PCB), and a rotary turret with multiple assembly heads. This paper presents a hybrid genetic algorithm (HGA) to optimize the sequence of component placements and the arrangement of component types to feeders simultaneously for a chip shooter machine, that is, the component scheduling problem. The objective of the problem is to minimize the total <b>assembly</b> <b>time.</b> The GA developed in the paper hybridizes different search heuristics including the nearest-neighbor heuristic, the 2 -opt heuristic, and an iterated swap procedure, which is a new improved heuristic. Compared with the results obtained by other researchers, the performance of the HGA is superior in terms of the <b>assembly</b> <b>time.</b> Scope and purpose When assembling the surface mount components on a PCB, it is necessary to obtain the optimal sequence of component placements and the best arrangement of component types to feeders simultaneously in order to minimize the total <b>assembly</b> <b>time.</b> Since {{it is very difficult to}} obtain the optimality, a GA hybridized with several search heuristics is developed.

40|$|Abstract: We study magnetic-field {{directed}} self-assembly {{of magnetic}} nanoparticles onto templates recorded on {{perpendicular magnetic recording}} media, and quantify feature width and height {{as a function of}} <b>assembly</b> <b>time.</b> Feature widths are determined from Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) images, while heights are obtained with Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM). For short <b>assembly</b> <b>times,</b> widths were ~ 150 nm, while heights were ~ 14 nm, a single nanoparticle on average with a 10 : 1 aspect ratio. For long <b>assembly</b> <b>times,</b> widths approach 550 nm, while the average height grows to 3 nanoparticles, ~ 35 nm; a 16 : 1 aspect ratio. We perform magnetometry on these self-assembled structures and observe the slope of the magnetic moment vs. field curve increases with time. This increase suggests magnetic nanoparticle interactions evolve from nanoparticle–nanoparticle interactions to cluster–cluster interactions as opposed to feature–feature interactions. We suggest the aspect ratio increase occurs because the magnetic field gradients are strongest near the transitions between recorded regions in perpendicular media. If these gradients can be optimized for assembly, strong potential exists for using perpendicular recording templates to assemble complex heterogeneous materials...|$|R
