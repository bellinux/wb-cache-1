50|$|DJ Tonka (born June 24, 1973 in Mainz, West Germany; {{real name}} Thomas-René Gerlach), is a German {{electronic}} music artist. He {{is also known}} as Tonka, <b>Chip</b> <b>Tunes,</b> and Thomastic.|$|R
50|$|His early {{releases}} {{were largely}} guitar based songs described variously as indie, folk, and anti-folk.

50|$|<b>Chip</b> <b>tuning</b> {{refers to}} {{changing}} or modifying an erasable programmable {{read only memory}} chip in an automobile's or other vehicle's electronic control unit (ECU) to achieve superior performance, whether it be more power, cleaner emissions, or better fuel efficiency. Engine manufacturers generally use a conservative electronic control unit map to allow for individual engine variations as well as infrequent servicing and poor-quality fuel. Vehicles with a remapped electronic control unit may {{be more sensitive to}} fuel quality and service schedules.|$|E
50|$|This {{was done}} with early engine {{computers}} in the 1980s and 1990s. Today, the term <b>chip</b> <b>tuning</b> can be misleading, as people will often use it to describe ECU tuning that does not involve swapping the chip. Modern electronic control units can be tuned by simply updating their software through a standard interface, such as On Board Diagnostics. This procedure is {{commonly referred to as}} engine or electronic control unit tuning. Electronic control units are a relatively recent addition to the automobile, having first appeared in the late 1970s.|$|E
5000|$|Changing the tuning {{characteristics}} electronically, {{by changing}} the firmware of the EMS. This <b>chip</b> <b>tuning</b> often works because modern engines are designed to produce more power than required, which is then reduced by the EMS to make the engine operate smoothly over a wider RPM range, with low emissions. This is called de-tuning and produces long-lasting engines {{and the ability to}} increase power output later for facelift models. Recently emissions have played a large part in de-tuning, and engines will often be de-tuned to produce a particular carbon output for tax reasons.|$|E

50|$|Engine tuning is {{the process}} of modifying the {{operating}} characteristics of an engine. In a typical engine set-up, there are various mechanical and electronic elements such as the intake manifold, spark plugs, Mass air flow/ Volume air flow, etc. Modern engines employ the use of an ECM to provide the best balance between performance and emissions. Via the OBD communications protocol, the electronically controlled aspects of the engine can be modified in the process known as 'mapping'. Mapping can either be performed by changing the software within the ECU (<b>chip</b> <b>tuning</b> via firmware modification), or by providing false data via plug-in hardware. Mechanical components can also be replaced, such as turbochargers or superchargers.|$|E

40|$|In recent years, Silicon Photonics {{has emerged}} as a {{promising}} technology for cost-effective fabrication of photonic components and integrated circuits, the application of which is recently expanding in technological fields beyond tele- and data-communications, such as sensing and biophotonics. Compact, energy-efficient laser sources with precise wavelength control are crucial for the aforementioned applications. However, practical, efficient, electrically-pumped lasers on Silicon or other group IV elements are still absent, owing to the indirect bandgap of those materials. Consequently, the integration of III-V compounds on Silicon currently appears to be the most viable route to the realization of such lasers. In this thesis, I present and explore the potential of an External Cavity (EC) hybrid III-V/Silicon laser design, comprising a III-V-based Reflective Semiconductor Optical Amplifier (RSOA) and a Silicon reflector chip, based on a two-dimensional Photonic Crystal (PhC) cavity vertically coupled to a low-refractive-index dielectric waveguide. The vertically coupled system functions as a wavelength-selective reflector, determining the lasing wavelength. Based on this architecture mW-level continuous-wave (CW) lasing at room temperature was shown both in a fiber-based long cavity scheme and die-based short cavity scheme, with SMSR of > 25 dB and > 40 dB, respectively. Furthermore, by electrically modulating the refractive index of the PhC cavity in the reflector <b>chip,</b> <b>tuning</b> of the emitted wavelength was achieved in the die-based short cavity EC laser configuration. In this way, I demonstrated the suitability of the examined EC configuration for direct frequency modulation. The proposed scheme eliminates the need for wavelength matching between the laser source and a resonant modulator, and reveals the potential of employing low-power-consumption resonant modulation in practical Silicon Photonics applications...|$|E
