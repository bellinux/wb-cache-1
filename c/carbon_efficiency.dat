We used a high resolution biogeochemical model resolving various scales from small to high, spatially and temporally, in order to quantify and better understand this variability. We find that phytoplankton C:N ratio is highly variable at all spatial and temporal scales (5 - 12 molC/molN), from meso- to regional scale, and is mainly driven by nitrogen supply. <b>Carbon</b> fixation <b>efficiency</b> varies accordingly at all scales (± 30 %), with higher values under oligotrophic conditions and lower values under eutrophic conditions.

40|$|This paper {{employs a}} three-stage {{approach}} to estimate low <b>carbon</b> economy <b>efficiency</b> {{in the largest}} twenty CO 2 emitting countries from 2000 to 2012. The approach includes the following three stages: (1) use of a data envelopment analysis (DEA) model with undesirable output to estimate the low <b>carbon</b> economy <b>efficiency</b> and calculate the input and output slacks; (2) use of a stochastic frontier approach to eliminate the impacts of external environment variables on these slacks; (3) re-estimation of the efficiency with adjusted inputs and outputs to reflect {{the capacity of the}} government to develop a low carbon economy. The results indicate that the low <b>carbon</b> economy <b>efficiency</b> performances in these countries had worsened during the studied period. The performances in the third stage are larger than that in the first stage. Moreover, in general, low <b>carbon</b> economy <b>efficiency</b> in Annex I countries of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) is better than that in Non-Annex I countries. However, the gap of the average efficiency score between Annex I and Non-Annex I countries in the first stage is smaller than that in the third stage. It implies that the external environment variables show greater influence on Non-Annex I countries than that on Annex I countries. These external environment variables should be taken into account in the transnational negotiation of the responsibility of promoting CO 2 reductions. Most importantly, the developed countries (mostly in Annex I) should help the developing countries (mostly in Non-Annex I) to reduce carbon emission by opening or expanding the trade, such as encouraging the import and export of the energy-saving and sharing emission reduction technology...|$|R
