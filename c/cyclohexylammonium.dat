40|$|The {{biosynthesis}} of polyamines {{from the}} diamine putrescine {{is not fully}} understood in higher plants. A putrescine aminopropyltransferase (PAPT) enzyme activity was characterized in alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.). This enzyme activity was highly specific for putrescine as the initial substrate and did not recognize another common diamine, 1, 3 -diaminopropane, or higher-molecular-weight polyamines such as spermidine and spermine as alternative initial substrates. The enzyme activity was inhibited by a general inhibitor of aminopropyltransferases, 5 [prime]-methylthioadenosine, and by a specific inhibitor of PAPTs, <b>cyclohexylammonium</b> sulfate. The initial substrate specificity and inhibition characteristics of the enzyme activity suggested {{that it is a}} classical example of a PAPT. However, this enzyme activity yielded multiple polyamine products, which is uncharacteristic of PAPTs. The major reaction product of PAPT activity in alfalfa was spermidine. The next most abundant products of the enzyme reaction using putrescine as the initial substrate included the tetramines spermine and thermospermine. These two tetramines were distinguished by thin-layer chromatography to be distinct reaction products exhibiting differential rates of formation. In addition, the uncommon polyamines homocaldopentamine and homocaldohexamine were tentatively identified as minor enzymatic reaction products but only in extracts prepared from osmotic stresstolerant alfalfa cultivars.

Coated wire Polymer Membrane Ion-Selective Electrodes (PMISEs) based on dinonylnapthalenesulfonic acid (DNNS) were prepared for several alkylammonium ions and pharmaceuticals. Selectivity coefficients and other operational characteristics were predictable from calculated distribution constants. Specifically, Log k ᵖᵒᵗ(i) (j) values increased linearly with carbon number in a homologous series of alkylammonium ions. Among cations of the same carbon number, interference increased tenfold with each additional substitution in going from quaternary, tertiary, secondary and primary alkylammonium ions. Addition of hydrophilic subtituent groups to <b>cyclohexylammonium</b> interferents further diminished electrode response. Electrodes for several important pharmaceuticals, namely cocaine, methamphetamine, methadone, protriptyline, cimetidine, lidoflazine, verapamil, acebutalol, diltiazem, and nicardipine, displayed nearly theoretical response down to micromolar concentrations. Their selectivity was consistent with calculated distribution constants. Selectivity was independent of sensitivity, suggesting that the magnitude of each was determined by the distribution of both the free cation and the association complex of this cation with DNNS. The polymerization of phenol derivatives onto copper rendered the resulting films responsive to counter-ions of the electroactive species present in the polymerization medium. Those incorporating Aliquat 336 (tricaprylmethylammonium chloride) showed response to various anions, while others prepared using a sulfonated phenol derivative (m-hydroxybenzenesulfonic acid) responded to tributylammonium. The films had short lifetimes due to poor adhesion to the copper substrate.

The development of the synthetic route to [11 C] carbon disulfide is described. The preferred synthesis method for the main body of this work was to pass [11 C] methyl iodide over sulfur at high temperature. Other methods of [11 C] carbon disulfide production were also explored including synthesis from [11 C] methane and also direct synthesis in the cyclotron target. Following the improved and robust synthesis of [11 C] carbon disulfide a series of radiolabelled thiourea compounds were synthesised from the reaction of [11 C] carbon disulfide and amines. This thiourea production method was further developed into the synthesis of 2 potential radiotracers. The progestin inhibitor tanaproget, and the CXCR 4 inhibitors IT 1 a and IT 1 t which are still undergoing synthetic development. As well as [11 C] carbon disulfide, [11 C] ammonium thiocyanate was also explored as a potential [11 C] radiolabelling reagent, with interest paid to its nucleophilic properties. Ammonium thiocyanate formed from the reaction of carbon disulfide with ammonia in solution. A series of [11 C] phenacyl thiocyanate compounds were synthesised from the reaction of [11 C] ammonium thiocyanate and acetophenone precursors. These [11 C] radiolabelled phenacyl thiocyanates were reacted on to form a series of analogous radiolabelled thiazole compounds. Once a more comprehensive understanding of the chemistry surrounding [11 C] carbon disulfide had been established, a series of experiments were carried out in order to trap [11 C] carbon disulfide on a cooled microfluidic device (MFD) before passing a droplet of precursor along the reaction channel of the MFD to react with the trapped [11 C] carbon disulfide, forming the desired product, in this case monocyclohexyldithiocarbamate <b>cyclohexylammonium</b> salt.
