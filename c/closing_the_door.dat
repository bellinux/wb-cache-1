Moore sees Donovan as well. The {{remainder of the}} segment consists of Donovan's fantasized sexual encounters with Moore throughout the house intercut with shots of Donovan sniffing poppers and penetrating himself with a large black dildo. The segment ends following Donovan's climax with the dildo, with the real Moore coming inside the house and <b>closing</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> behind them.|$|E
5|$|Mulder and Ludwig {{venture into}} the {{volcanic}} caves to find Trepkos. When they find Firewalker, Trepkos shoots Ludwig {{in the back with}} a flare gun, killing him. He then burns Ludwig's body, as he was infected with the spore as well. Trepkos tells Mulder that after Firewalker returned from its first descent, Erickson pulverized a rock in one of its samples, resulting in his death and the infection of all the scientists immediately surrounding him. Trepkos says that the spore is parasitic in nature, making its hosts pass itself on to others. Meanwhile, in the lab, an infected O'Neil handcuffs herself to Scully to expose her to the spore, forcing Scully to use a hammer to split the chains but to no avail, so she instead protects herself by throwing O'Neil into a sealed chamber and <b>closing</b> <b>the</b> <b>door.</b> A protrusion then bursts out of O'Neil's throat, killing her without spreading the spore to Scully.|$|E
5|$|After Skinner and Scully {{find and}} {{retrieve}} Praise, Skinner takes {{him to the}} nearest hospital, where his friend Thea visits him, <b>closing</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> behind her. In search for Mulder in the desert, Scully sees a bright light in the sky which she thinks is a spaceship, but which is later revealed to be a helicopter. The helicopter lands and Doggett insists Scully travel {{with him to the}} hospital; she reluctantly accepts. At the hospital, two other FBI agents assure the two agents that nothing has happened to Praise; however, they soon discover that he has vanished. Scully leaves to search for Praise, while Doggett stays in an attempt to catch the intruder. He checks the ceiling space, where he finds Skinner badly injured. Meanwhile, Scully finds Praise, along with Skinner, who claims to be protecting the boy. Skinner, who is actually the Alien Bounty Hunter, attempts to kill her but Scully grabs her gun and shoots him in the neck, killing the Bounty Hunter. After Doggett reports the case to Kersh, he is assigned to the X-File division with Scully. The episode ends showing Mulder still held in captivity as six Alien Bounty Hunters look on.|$|E

5|$|The {{next day}} at the tavern, Morrison meets Brown's wife (Agi Szirtes), and tells her that Brown is under {{suspicion}} for the theft and for the murder at the quayside. He asks for her help in finding him and repeats to her Mitchell's offer to Brown, but she remains silent. At home, Henriette tells Maloin she found a man in their hut at the seaside, and in fear locked the door and ran home. An agitated Maloin tells her not to tell anyone, and leaves for the hut. He unlocks the door, and receiving no response to his calling Brown's name, steps inside, <b>closing</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> behind. Minutes later he re-emerges, breathing heavily. After pausing to compose himself, he locks the door and leaves. In the next scene, Maloin presents the briefcase to Morrison in the tavern, and asks him to arrest him, confessing to having killed Brown an hour ago. Morrison leaves with Maloin for the hut, dismissing the frenzied inquiries of Brown's wife about her husband and handing the briefcase to the barkeep on the way out. Brown's wife follows the men to the hut, and emerges weeping with Morrison moments later. Back at the tavern, Morrison prepares two envelopes with {{a small portion of}} the recovered money in each. One he leaves with the grieving widow to whom he apologizes and wishes well, while the other he gives to Maloin, telling him that his case was one of self-defense. As he is preparing to leave, Morrison advises Maloin to go home and forget the whole affair. The camera focuses on the expressionless face of Brown's wife momentarily before fading to white.|$|E
5|$|The video {{starts at}} the Clarksons' household. There, {{she and her husband}} are engaged in a heated {{argument}} and he threatens to smash down a picture of the family at one point. Time freezes still and her husband becomes immobile; Clarkson, however, is immune to this. Looking around her house, she sees her younger self. Hand in hand, the younger and older versions of Clarkson relive her troubled childhood as various painful memories are seen, such as the younger Clarkson making a picture for her father who tosses it into the sink while talking on the phone, and Clarkson's mother making an unappreciated dinner for her father as she puts the father's dinner into the bin. These events drive her mother to the point of taking pills before <b>closing</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> in the younger Clarkson's face, so that she doesn't see her starting to cry. The breaking point is finally seen when Clarkson's parents have a physical fight and throw objects at each other. Soon after, Clarkson's father packs his bags and leaves despite the younger Clarkson's pleas for him to stay. The older Clarkson runs back in time to the present, and instead of fighting with her husband, they make up. They then see that their daughter in the video had seen them fight, and they embrace her and each other. Throughout the music video, Clarkson is shown singing on the front porch, her mother's bed and a room full of mirrors, reflecting an image of her younger self. Note that Kelly is holding Kennedy's hand in the scene where the childhood memories are revealed.|$|E
25|$|After having {{protected}} the Argentine north for a year, the Army of the North received orders {{for a third}} campaign to Upper Peru (present-day Bolivia). The objective this time was to occupy all of Upper Peru, <b>closing</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> on the royalists and therefore establishing {{the sovereignty of the}} United Provinces of the Río de la Plata. Afterward they planned to continued the advance to Lima to try to liberate the capital of the Viceroyalty of Peru.|$|E

25|$|Tanala social {{structure}} {{is characterized by}} a harmonious interrelationship between the nobles of the Tanala who migrated into the forest where they settled, and the commoner chiefs {{of the people who were}} already settled there. This relationship is traditionally reinforced through marriage between the groups and particular roles given to each in the governance of the community. The Tanala speak a dialect of the Malagasy language and adhere to numerous fady such as a prohibition against visiting a nobleman when he is ill, or <b>closing</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> to the house during mealtimes to prevent others from watching one eat. Their main livelihoods are the cultivation of coffee and rice.|$|E
25|$|After unsuccessfully {{attempting}} to entice Schaefer into their van with alternate offers {{of marijuana and}} a lift home, Bittaker and Norris drove further ahead and parked alongside a driveway. Norris then exited the vehicle, opened the passenger-side sliding door, and leaned into the van, with his head and shoulders obscured from view behind the door. When Lucinda Schaefer passed the van, Norris exchanged a few words with her before dragging her into the van and <b>closing</b> <b>the</b> <b>door.</b> Using a ruse they would repeat in most of their subsequent murders, Bittaker turned the radio to full volume as Norris bound the victim's {{arms and legs and}} gagged her with duct tape as Bittaker drove Schaefer to the fire road in the San Gabriel Mountains where, in April, the pair had previously switched the locks.|$|E
25|$|During the FFA's {{administration}} of the club, they indicated an openness to changes to the Perth Glory name and colours. Even though this move was welcomed by many long time supporters who remember the original motives of the Nick Tana led consortium in the mid 1990s to purchase the naming and livery rights and all other historical assets related to the oldest (albeit with a non-continuous history) Western Australian football club, Perth City FC, resulting in being rebuffed at the final minute, this was still not a popular move amongst the bulk of paid-up Perth Glory members who have grown accustomed to the current name and colours thus <b>closing</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> on any popular compromise. Thankfully for said members, the new ownership triumvirate consisting of Messrs Sage, Spence and McKeon stated that the colours will certainly not be changed under their reign.|$|E

This ATO system was upgraded in 2015 to replace outdated software and relays. The tunnels, [...] in total length, run from West Portal Station in the southwestern part of the city to Embarcadero Station {{in the heart of the}} Financial District. Three lines, the K Ingleside, the L Taraval, and the M Ocean View feed into the tunnel at West Portal, while two lines, the J Church and N Judah, enter at a portal near Church Street and Duboce Avenue in the Duboce Triangle neighborhood.

On April 27, 1998 Raw Is War and Nitro both took place in the Hampton Roads area of Virginia, a mere 19 miles apart. D-Generation X traveled from the WWF show in Hampton to The Scope in Norfolk and shouted insults against WCW through a bullhorn, as well as mentioning the fact that WCW gave out free tickets to fill up arenas for television while sporting black armbands with the acronym POWCW (Prisoner of WCW), which referenced Kliq members Scott Hall and Kevin Nash. They then tried to enter the arena via a loading dock, in their army jeep before being stopped by someone <b>closing</b> <b>the</b> <b>door.</b> They also attempted to forcibly secure meetings with Nitro's executive producer Eric Bischoff and WCW owner Ted Turner at WCW headquarters in Atlanta, Georgia.

2500|$|In {{the first}} two rounds of the [...] season, the Renault was not as {{competitive}} as it had previously been. Alonso finished fourth and eighth in Australia and Malaysia respectively, fuelling rumours that Alonso would leave the team because he was disappointed with his Renault and was either moving to BMW Sauber, Honda or Toyota. BMW boss Mario Theissen was keen to get Alonso to replace Nick Heidfeld {{in order to get the}} team their first win. Honda rumours started when Alonso said in an interview that he felt there was something about Honda and he wanted to drive for them in [...] and switching to Ferrari in [...] Toyota said they were eager to give a top driver their seat. But the most likely place that Alonso would go was to replace Felipe Massa at Ferrari in , especially in light of the general belief that there was an [...] "out clause" [...] in Fernando Alonso's contract with Renault which would give him the freedom to move to another team for the next season should he be able to secure a deal. However Ferrari president Luca Cordero di Montezemolo stated that Massa's seat in the team was secure and would stay that way until the end of his contract in 2010. Räikkönen was also given a two-year contract extension to partner Massa until the end of 2010, essentially <b>closing</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> on Alonso for a possible move to Ferrari.

2500|$|The {{music video}} was {{directed}} by Emil Nava and was premiered on 30 January 2011. The video begins closing up on a giant teddy bear that is missing an eye and an arm, accompanied by a musical box-rendering of Johann Strauss II's The Blue Danube, before zooming out to show a child version of Jessie J sitting next to it, who then {{gets up and walks}} around the bear, turning her into her full-sized self. Jessie J is then shown standing and holding out her hands, and as the lyrics suggest, a coconut man and a moonhead appear on her outstretched hands (this is a reference to the two individuals who co-wrote the song with her: Dr. Luke is coconut man and Kelly is moonhead in reference to his large head) and pointing to herself (referring to herself as pea because of her small head). The video then goes back to Jessie J in the lap of the large teddy bear and shows various scenes of Jessie J holding up items that relate to the lyrics, including a huge price tag and pointing to left and the right. As the chorus begins, Jessie J is shown dancing under a money tree with dollar bills covering its branches. A scene of Jessie J is then shown of her as an oversized ballerina in a jewelry box. As Jessie J says the words [...] "video hoes", a scene of her wearing the same outfit as in her [...] "Do It Like a Dude" [...] video and dancing holding her crotch, suggesting that she does not approve of video hoes. Jessie J is next shown riding around on a small tricycle. As the song progresses into the second chorus, Jessie J and two background dancers are shown as marionettes, with Jessie J wearing a Pinocchio hat, dancing to the song. The video then moves to B.o.B as his verse begins, showing him dancing in front of a beat up car, that starts jumping and moving to the beat. He is then shown {{standing in the middle of}} four large, toy green army men. As his verse ends, Jessie J is shown squeezed into a doll house and holding a glass doll that is missing part of its head. As the video goes into its final chorus, scenes of Jessie J are shown her dancing with B.o.B, laying on the floor missing a leg, sitting in an oversized chair, dressed up as a doll in a blue and white dress, and dancing with her younger self. The video ends with Jessie J <b>closing</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> to her doll house; with her still inside it, the camera carries on zooming out.|$|E
