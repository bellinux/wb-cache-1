Structurally related tetrapyrroles also possess in vitro anti-genotoxic activity and may prevent mutation prior to malignancy. Furthermore, few data suggest that tetrapyrroles exert anti-carcinogenic effects via induction of cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. To further investigate whether tetrapyrroles provoke DNA-damage in human cancer cells, they were tested in the single cell gel electrophoresis assay (SCGE). Eight tetrapyrroles (unconjugated bilirubin, bilirubin ditaurate, biliverdin, biliverdin-/bilirubin dimethyl ester, urobilin, stercobilin and protoporphyrin) were added to cultured Caco 2 and HepG 2 cells and their effects on <b>comet</b> <b>formation</b> (% tail DNA) were assessed. Flow cytometric assessment (apoptosis/necrosis, cell cycle, intracellular radical species generation) assisted in revealing underlying mechanisms of intracellular action. Cells were incubated with tetrapyrroles at concentrations of 0. 5, 5 and 17 μM for 24 h. Addition of 300 μM tertiary-butyl hydroperoxide to cells served as a positive control. Tetrapyrrole incubation mostly resulted in increased DNA-damage (<b>comet</b> <b>formation)</b> in Caco 2 and HepG 2 cells. Tetrapyrroles that are concentrated within the intestine, including protoporphyrin, urobilin and stercobilin, led to significant <b>comet</b> <b>formation</b> in both cell lines, implicating the compounds in inducing DNA-damage and apoptosis in cancer cells found within organs of the digestive system...|$|E

Six hours after the last lycopene supplementation, the gerbils received Fe/NTA (0. 16 mmol/ 10 mL/kg BW) and were killed 3 h later.

40|$|The {{proto-oncogene}} c-Src {{is involved}} in a variety of signaling processes. Therefore, c-Src spatiotemporal localization is critical for interaction with downstream targets. However, the mechanisms regulating this localization have remained elusive. Previous studies have shown that c-Src trafficking is a microtubule-dependent process that facilitates c-Src turnover in neuronal growth cones. As such, microtubule depolymerization lead to the inhibition of c-Src recycling. Alternatively, c-Src trafficking was also shown to be regulated by RhoB-dependent actin polymerization. Our results show that c-Src vesicles primarily exhibit microtubule-dependent trafficking; however, microtubule depolymerization does not inhibit vesicle movement. Instead, vesicular movement becomes both faster and less directional. This movement was associated with actin polymerization directly at c-Src vesicle membranes. Interestingly, it has been shown previously that c-Src delivery is an actin polymerization-dependent process that relies on small GTPase RhoB at c-Src vesicles. In agreement with this finding, microtubule depolymerization induced significant activation of RhoB, together with actin <b>comet</b> tail <b>formation.</b> These effects occurred downstream of GTP-exchange factor, GEF-H 1, which was released from depolymerizing MTs. Accordingly, GEF-H 1 activity was necessary for actin <b>comet</b> tail <b>formation</b> at the Src vesicles.

40|$|Abstract: The {{structure}} and composition of planets, small bodies of the Solar system is essentially different. Therefore {{it is difficult to}} explain an origin of all celestial bodies of the Solar system due to smooth evolution of the protoplanet cloud. An alternative to the evolutionary one is the hypothesis of the explosive origin of some celestial bodies. It is supposed, that on the solid inner core of a planet the active layer is formed from particles of uranium and thorium oxides (or carbides), weighed in liquid iron of the outer core of the planet. The explosion in such a layer might take place at fast and deep transition of the system in a supercritical condition, for example as a result of collision of a planet with an asteroid. Collision of the protoplanet with an asteroid, the subsequent explosion in an active layer and partial or full fragmentation of the planet in conditions of gravitation is numerically simulated. Modeling was conducted within the framework of hydrodynamical approach for two-dimensional non-stationary motion of the compressible medium on the basis of laws of conservation of mass, pulse and energy in cases of plane and axial symmetry. The hypothesis that some bodies of the Solar system might be formed as a result of nuclear explosions in the protoplanet core, including large enough fragments mainly iron-nickel, stone-silicate or dust-ice structure is numerically confirmed in the paper.

The majority of the B 5 R ectodomain consists of four domains with homology to short consensus repeat domains followed by a stalk. Previous {{studies have shown that}} polyclonal antibodies raised against the B 5 R ectodomain inhibit EEV infection. In this study, our goal was to elucidate the antigenic structure of B 5 R and relate this to its function. To do this, we produced multimilligram quantities of vaccinia virus B 5 R as a soluble protein [B 5 R(275 t) ] using a baculovirus expression system. We then selected and characterized a panel of 26 monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) that recognize B 5 R(275 t).

30|$|The {{presence}} of crystalline silicates in comets was first identified by infrared spectra of {{dust in the}} coma of comet 1 P/Halley (Bregman et al., 1987). Since then, infrared features of crystalline silicate have been observed {{in a number of}} comae, but the origin of crystalline silicates is a matter of debate. Experimental studies on thermal annealing of amorphous magnesium silicate smokes show that a dust temperature in a coma of a typical comet is too low for amorphous silicate 1 to crystallize in situ (Hallenbeck et al., 1998, 2000). Therefore, thermal annealing of amorphous silicates in the hot inner solar nebula and incorporation of crystalline silicate into comet nuclei are suggested (see a review by Hanner, 1999). In contrast, the interstellar composition of gas in the comae indicates the preservation of interstellar volatiles in the cold outer nebula (Biermann et al., 1982; Mumma, 1996). To reconcile hot and cold materials, crystalline silicates are considered as being transported from the inner solar nebula to the outer comet-formation region (Bockel’ee-Morvan et al., 2002). Nuth et al. (2000) claim that the fractional abundance of crystalline silicate in the solar nebula increases with time and thus can be used to date a <b>comet’s</b> <b>formation</b> age. Harker and Desch (2002) considered in-situ annealing of silicate at elevated temperatures by nebular shocks that could proceed with crystallization up to 20 AU, depending on the model parameters (Nakamoto and Miura, 2005). Without the outward transport, however, the in-situ annealing mechanism predicts no crystalline silicate in the Kuiper Belt comets, contrary to observations (Watanabe, 2004). As noticed by Huebner (2002), none of the thermal mechanisms allow comets to retain the interstellar composition of ices in their nuclei.|$|R

40|$|Background: Phosphatidylinositol 4, 5 -bisphosphate (PIP 2) {{has been}} implicated in the {{regulation}} of the actin cytoskeleton and vesicle trafficking. It stimulates de novo actin polymerization by activating the pathway involving the Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (WASP) and the actin-related protein complex Arp 2 / 3. Other studies show that actin polymerizes from cholesterol–sphingolipid-rich membrane microdomains called ‘rafts’, in a manner dependent on tyrosine phosphorylation. Although actin has {{been implicated in}} vesicle trafficking, and rafts are sites of active phosphoinositide and tyrosine kinase signaling that mediate apically directed vesicle trafficking, {{it is not known}} whether phosphoinositide regulation of actin dynamics occurs in rafts, or if it is linked to vesicle movements. Results: Overexpression of type I phosphatidylinositol phosphate 5 -kinase (PIP 5 KI), which synthesizes PIP 2, promoted actin polymerization from membrane-bound vesicles to form motile actin comets. Pervanadate (PV), a tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor, induced comets {{even in the absence of}} PIP 5 KI overexpression. PV increased PIP 2 levels, suggesting that it induces comets by changing PIP 2 homeostasis and by increasing tyrosine phosphorylation. Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) enhanced PV-induced <b>comet</b> <b>formation,</b> and these stimuli together potentiated the PIP 5 KI effect. The vesicles at the heads of comets were enriched in PIP 5 KIs and tyrosine phosphoproteins. WASP-Arp 2 / 3 involvement was established using dominant-negative WASP constructs.

Extraction of cholesterol with methyl-β-cyclodextrin reduced comets, establishing that rafts promote <b>comet</b> <b>formation.</b> Conclusions: Sphingolipid-cholesterol rafts are preferred platforms for membrane-linked actin polymerization.

40|$|Current cometary orbits provide {{information}} on their recent dynamical history. However, determining a given <b>comet's</b> <b>formation</b> region from its current dynamical state alone is complicated by radial migration in the proto-planetary disk and by dynamical interactions with the growing giant planets. Because comets reside {{for long periods of}} time in the outer Solar System, the ices contained in their nuclei (native ices) retain a relatively well-preserved footprint of when and where they formed, and this in turn can provide clues to conditions in the formation epoch. As a comet approaches the Sun, sublimation of its native ices releases parent volatiles into the coma where they can be measured spectroscopically. The past to - 15 years have seen the advent of infrared spectrometers with high sensitivity between about 2. 8 and 5. 0 micron, enabling a taxonomy among comets based on abundances of parent volatiles (e. g., H 2 O, CO, CH 4, C 2 H 6, HCN, CH 30 H, H 2 CO, NH 3). Such molecules are of keen interest to Astrobiology, as they include important pre-biotic species that likely were required for the emergence of life on Earth and perhaps elsewhere. Approximately 20 comets have thus far been characterized, beginning with C/ 1996 82 (Hyakutake) in 1996. Molecular production rates are established through comparison of observed emission line intensities with those predicted by quantum mechanical fluorescence models.

WzzO 139 from Vibrio cholerae O 139 and WzzST from Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium were fully functional in Shigella flexneri, resulting in LPS with either very short (VS) type Oag chains (2 – 7 Oag RUs) or long (L) type Oag chains (19 – 35 RUs), respectively. In the absence of VL-type Oag chains, the VS-, S- and L-type Oag chains were permissive for plaque and F-actin <b>comet</b> tail <b>formation.</b> However, {{in the presence of}} LPS with VL-type Oag chains, the VS- and S-type Oag chains but not the L-type Oag chains were permissive for plaque and F-actin <b>comet</b> tail <b>formation.</b> These data, and the results of a previous investigation, show that IcsA function in ABM requires LPS Oag chains with at least two but less than 18 RUs when VL-type Oag chains are co-expressed on the cell surface. However, {{in the absence of the}} VL-type Oag chains, LPS Oag chains with at least two but less than 90 RUs are able to support IcsA function in ABM. Indirect immunofluorescence staining of IcsA on the cell surface of the S. flexneri strains did not correlate with the observed effect of Oag chain length on plaque and F-actin <b>comet</b> tail <b>formation.</b> However, when intracellular bacteria lacking VL-type Oag chains were examined, an inverse correlation between Oag modal chain length and detection of IcsA was observed, i. e. staining decreased with increased modal length. It is hypothesized that Oag chains can mask IcsA and interfere with its function in ABM, and a model is presented to explain how LPS Oag and IcsA may interact. It is suggested that S. flexneri 2 a has evolved to synthesize LPS with two Oag modal chain lengths, as S-type Oag chains allow IcsA to function in ABM in the presence of VL-type Oag chains that confer resistance to serum.
