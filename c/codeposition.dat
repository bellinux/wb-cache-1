50|$|NREL {{developed}} another {{process that}} involves three deposition steps and produced the current CIGS efficiency record holder at 20.3%. The {{first step in}} NREL's method is <b>codeposition</b> of In, Ga, and Se. This is followed by Cu and Se deposited at a higher temperature to allow for diffusion and intermixing of the elements. In the final stage In, Ga, and Se are again deposited to make the overall composition Cu deficient. Würth Solar began producing CIGS cells using an inline coevaporation system in 2005 with module efficiencies between 11% and 12%. They opened another production facility and continued to improve efficiency and yield. Other companies scaling up coevaporation processes include Global Solar and Ascent Solar. Global Solar used an inline three stage deposition process. In all of the steps Se is supplied in excess in the vapor phase. In and Ga are first evaporated followed by Cu and then by In and Ga to make the film Cu deficient. These films performed quite favorably {{in relation to other}} manufacturers and to absorbers grown at NREL and the Institute for Energy Conversion (IEC). However, modules of Global Solar’s films did not perform as well. The property in which the module most obviously under-performed was a low VOC, which is characteristic of high defect density and high recombination velocities. Global Solar’s absorber layer outperformed the NREL absorber in carrier lifetime and hall mobility. However, as completed cells the NREL sample performed better. This is evidence of a poor CIGS/CdS interface, possibly {{due to the lack of}} an ODC surface layer on the Global Solar film. Disadvantages include uniformity issues over large areas and the related difficulty of coevaporating elements in an inline system. Also, high growth temperatures raise the thermal budget and costs. Additionally, coevaporation is plagued by low material utilization (deposition on chamber walls instead of the substrate, especially for selenium) and expensive vacuum equipment. A way to enhance Se utilisation is via a thermal or plasma-enhanced selenium-cracking process, which can be coupled with an ion beam source for ion beam assisted deposition.|$|E

Zeta potential measurements confirm that Co 2 + has a stronger tendency to adsorb on Al 2 O 3 particles surface than Ni 2 + does in sulfamate electrolytes.

Mullite will be employed as the inner (base) layer and the composition of the film will be continuously changed to a layer of pure alumina, which will function as the actual protective coating of the component. Chemical vapor deposition reactions of silica, alumina, and aluminosilicates (mullite) through hydrolysis of aluminum and silicon chlorides in the presence of CO{sub 2 } and H{sub 2 } will be employed to deposit compositionally graded films of mullite and alumina. Our studies will include the kinetic investigation of the silica, alumina, and aluminosilicate deposition processes, characterization of the composition, microstructure, surface morphology, and mechanical behavior of the prepared films, and modeling of the various deposition processes. During this reporting period, the construction and development of the chemical vapor deposition system was completed, and experiments were conducted on the deposition of alumina, silica, and aluminosilicates (such as mullite) from mixtures of AlCl{sub 3 } and CH{sub 3 }SiCl{sub 3 } in CO{sub 2 } and H{sub 2 }.

The apparent activation energy values extracted from the deposition rate vs. temperature curves in the high temperature region were similar for the three deposition processes, having a value around 20 kcal/mol.

Although the electroplating of some composite coatings like Ni-SiC, Ni-PTFE, and Co-Cr 2 O 3 are nowadays common industrial practice, the modelling of the <b>codeposition</b> process is still far from being well-developed. The present paper intends to give a survey on the understanding of the mechanism of electrolytic <b>codeposition</b> and on the mathematical models developed over the years to describe the incorporation of solid particles in electrodeposited metals. Finally some trends and expected future developments of composite plating are presented. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|In this study, the {{kinetics}} of Zn-Fe <b>codeposition</b> {{was investigated}} in chloride acidic solution using cyclic voltammetry. Anomalous <b>codeposition</b> is detected and this mechanism depends on the Zn(II) / Fe(II) concentration ratio in the electrolytic bath. The study of early stages of electrodeposition showed that Zn- Fe follows a theoretical response to instantaneous nucleation evolves into a progressive nucleation according to the model of Scharifker and Hills. The morphology {{and structure of the}} coatings is discussed using characterization techniques. Dense, uniform, and singlephased Zn-Fe coatings could be obtained with a Zn-Fe ratio of 1 / 3.
