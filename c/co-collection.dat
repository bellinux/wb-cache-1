40|$|This report gives a {{technological}} {{description of the}} four common collection and recycling schemes that have been tested in the Netherlands {{as part of the}} pilot beverage cartons in 2013. During this pilot the collection and recycling of beverage cartons was tested in 37 different municipalities, with various separate collection systems and 2 recovery facilities. The pilot demonstrated that it is technically possible to collect and recycle Dutch beverage cartons. The recycled pulp from all tested collection methods is relatively similar in properties. Also, the fibres are relatively strong and the microbiological load is relative high, this limits the applicability. Hence, corrugated boxes are a well-suited application for these pulps. Four different collection and recycling schemes were tested; separate collection, <b>co-collection</b> with plastics, <b>co-collection</b> with paper & board and recovery. The efficiency of most schemes is limited by the net collection yields and for some schemes also the sorting yield. The net collection yields are determined by different factors, such as the percentage of high rise buildings, the execution of the collection system (service level, communication, etc.) and the space inside the houses to store and keep beverage cartons separate until collection. The recovery recycling chains were most efficient, although one of the two chains suffered from a relative low sorting yield. Nevertheless, this sorting step can be improved. Two different <b>co-collection</b> chains with plastic packages were studied; the Milieuzakken and the Kunststof Hergebruik chains. The Milieuzakken-chain is already established for several years and the collection retrieves almost all the beverage cartons that are expected to be present in its collection area. However, the collected material contains also relative large amounts of residual waste, which hampers the sorting and recycling and reduces the overall efficiency. The Kunststof Hergebruik <b>co-collection</b> chain was set-up specially for this pilot and suffered from low collection yields and low sorting yields. Although the rural area around Deventer already reached a near complete collection of all beverage cartons, for most other collection areas more time is necessary to mature the collection system and obtain higher collection yields. For improved sorting ideally an investment is required which would make the sorting process much more efficient, since the current facility was not designed and equipped for the efficient sorting of beverage cartons. The separate collection scheme suffered from relative low net collection yields, varying from 3 % to 57 % with a weight-averaged mean of 20 %. This collection system needs time to mature and obtain higher net collection yields. For a few municipalities (with relatively low collection yields) some adjustments to the system are necessary. Also, the <b>co-collection</b> scheme with paper & board in general suffered from low net collection yields. Although in the high-rise area of Etten-Leur the largest net collection yield for a high-rise area was recorded of 50 %. The subsequent sorting was inefficient, due to the similarity of the materials. In the future, an ideal <b>co-collection</b> chain would be constructed without a sorting facility. The mixture would be integrally pulped and recycled as is now the current operation in a new facility in Nortrup (Germany) ...|$|E

40|$|The {{collection}} of source segregated household food waste {{is becoming increasingly}} popular, because of its potential to divert biodegradable materials from landfill, increase recycling rates and provide a contaminant-free feedstock for anaerobic digestion. Various types of kerbside household food waste collection systems are operating in the UK and in Europe; however, studies on the energy consumption of integrating source separated food waste with {{collection of}} other waste fractions are very limited. A mechanistic model was developed in this research as a waste collection assessment tool (WasteCAT) for scoping and assessment of collection systems. Data collected from six local authorities in England was applied to verify and validate the modelling tool. Fuel consumption and other parameters such as total distance travelled (a proxy for vehicle lifespan), total time spent (a proxy for staffing costs), number of collection vehicles required (a proxy for capital costs), and arrangement of waste types and compartments were also assessed in this research, as these factors may also influence the selection of kerbside waste collection systems. A typical hypothetical town of 25, 000 households was chosen to study the performance of separate, <b>co-collection,</b> kerbside-sorted and partially-sorted collection of household waste by different sizes and types of single and compartmentalised collection vehicles at different collection frequencies. Comparing {{the performance of the}} four collection systems, kerbside partially-sorted collection required the least fuel, while <b>co-collection</b> of household waste always had the best performance in terms of total travelling distance, time spent and number of collection vehicles required. The difference between the best and the worst systems was up to 156 % for fuel use, 131 % for distance travelled, 63 % for time spent and 141 % for vehicles required. Besides that, inappropriate allocation of compartment and waste type could increase fuel use by up to 1. 1 times in <b>co-collection,</b> 2. 27 times in kerbside-sorted and 3. 08 times in kerbside partially-sorted collection. The research shows WasteCAT could provide a powerful tool for exploring alternative options. Keywords: Waste collection, collection vehicles, fuel consumption, food waste...|$|E
30|$|One of {{the motivations}} in {{building}} a position-controlled easel that moves the artwork rather than the detection system is {{to take advantage of}} multiplexing. That is, <b>co-collection</b> of multiple point-based imaging spectroscopy modalities is more efficient if the spectral collection time of each modality is long. For example, scanning an area of 1  m 2 at 1  mm 2 spatial sampling, and 100  ms integration time would take approximately 28  h. Each additional point-based modality would require an additional 28  h if collected at the same spatial sampling and integration time. By collecting data from each point-based modality at the same time, the total collection time is significantly reduced.|$|E
40|$|The Multi-Compartment Vehicle Routing Problem {{involves}} {{clients with}} {{a demand for}} different products and vehicles with several compartments to co-transport these commodities. We present a local search procedure that explores well-known moves (2 -opt, cross, exchange, relocate), and exploits the mechanisms of neighbour lists and marking {{to speed up the}} searches. We combine the procedure with the Guided Local Search meta-heuristic to improve solution quality. Extensive computational results are reported to uncover when co-distribution by vehicles with multiple compartments is better than separate distribution with un-partitioned trucks. Sensitivities in key problem parameters including, client density and location of the depot, vehicle capacity, client demand and number of commodities are investigated.

30|$|We finally {{stress that}} our {{artificial}} model, although simple, reproduces several features {{observed in the}} real Yelp data. We used the model {{to show that the}} newly defined metrics are sensitive to the proportion of links driven by social interactions, but the original metrics fail in this respect. Given the level of agreement between the model and real data, the model itself can be used in the future to further our understanding and measurements of friends’ influence as well as to study related aspects such as the presence and impact of influential users. In this work we have entirely neglected the time difference between the <b>co-collection</b> behavior of users. It is well possible that this information can be used to improve the measurement of friends’ influence among the users.|$|E

Audio, ultrasound, and articulometry data were recorded from 11 North American English speakers reading 10 blocks of 25 sentences, speaking for 2 minutes at a time, spanning a recording time of 45 minutes. The 95 % confidence interval for ultrasound probe roll relative to head motion was 1. 35, and 2. 12 mm for lateral displacement, such that ultrasound probe displacement is within acceptable rotational and translational parameters {{as described in the}} HOCUS paper [9]. The proper use of this probe holder could also allow for adequate ultrasound probe stabilization without external marker tracking for post-processing correction, making this probe holder suitable for field researc...|$|E
40|$|Source {{separated}} {{food waste}} {{is a valuable}} feedstock for renewable energy production through anaerobic digestion, {{and a variety of}} collection schemes for this material have recently been introduced. The aim {{of this study was to}} identify options that maximize collection efficiency and reduce fuel consumption as part of the overall energy balance. A mechanistic model was developed to calculate the fuel consumption of kerbside collection of source segregated food waste, co-mingled dry recyclables and residual waste. A hypothetical city of 20, 000 households was considered and nine scenarios were tested with different combinations of collection frequencies, vehicle types and waste types. The results showed that the potential fuel savings from weekly and fortnightly <b>co-collection</b> of household waste range from 7. 4 % to 22. 4 % and 1. 8 % to 26. 6 %, respectively, when compared to separate collection. A compartmentalized vehicle split 30 : 70 always performed better than one with two compartments of equal size. Weekly food waste collection with alternate weekly collection of the recyclables and residual waste by two-compartment collection vehicles was the best option to reduce the overall fuel consumption...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{increase}} {{awareness of the}} limitations of high-risk human papillomavirus (hrHPV) laboratory-developed testing (LDT) widely used in US cervical cancer screening. METHODS AND RESULTS: A young woman in her 30 s was diagnosed and treated for stage 1 B 1 cervical squamous cell carcinoma in which HPV 16 DNA was detected using polymerase chain reaction testing. Both 1 month before and 42 months before cervical cancer diagnosis, the patient had highly abnormal cytology findings; however, residual SurePath™ (Becton, Dickson and Company, Franklin Lakes, NJ) vial fluid yielded negative Hybrid Capture 2 (HC 2; Qiagen NV, Hilden, Germany) hrHPV LDT results from each of the two specimens. This prompted questions to be asked concerning the performance characteristics of hrHPV LDT. A review of the available data indicates that (1) purification of DNA from SurePath specimens requires complex sample preparation due to formaldehyde crosslinking of proteins and nucleic acids, (2) HC 2 -SurePath hrHPV testing had not been Food and Drug Administration-approved after multiple premarket approval submissions, (3) detectible hrHPV DNA in the SurePath vial decreases over time, and (4) US laboratories performing HC 2 -SurePath hrHPV LDT testing are not using a standardized manufacturer-endorsed procedure. CONCLUSION: Recently updated cervical screening guidelines in the US recommend against the use of hrHPV LDT in cervical screening, including widely used HC 2 testing from the SurePath vial. The manufacturer recently issued a technical bulletin specifically warning that use of SurePath samples with the HC 2 hrHPV test may provide false negative results and potentially compromise patient safety. <b>Co-collection</b> using a Food and Drug Administration-approved hrHPV test medium is recommended for HPV testing of patients undergoing cervical screening using SurePath samples...|$|E
40|$|Your {{school is}} {{participating}} in the Minnesota Source-Separated Composting Pilot Project which is being coordinated by a broad coalition of private and public partners. All the partners believe that organic composting is beneficial for two reasons: 1) A large amount of material can be diverted from disposal facilities (up to 70 %) when composting is combined with traditional recycling; and 2) The final product {{can go back to}} the land, replenishing depleted and eroded soils and restoring ecological health. Restaurants, grocery stores, hospitals, and other businesses will be {{participating in the}} project with your school. Your school’s current waste service provider, Waste Management, will collect sorted organic materials, (primarily food and soiled or other paper that cannot be recycled or reused), and transport the material to the Wright County Compost facility near Buffalo, Minnesota. This state-of-the-art facility will process the organic material, then compost, screen and cure it to produce a high quality soil additive. I This pilot project provides for the <b>co-collection</b> of organic material and corrugated cardboard, with the organic material bagged separately to prevent contamination of the cardboard. During the three to six months following the implementation of the project, feasibility and cost studies will be undertaken to determine the long term viability of the program. This will be a great opportunity to teach your students about the composting process and the characteristics of common items {{that are part of the}} waste stream at your school. You can reinforce which items are already part of the school’s recycling program, and determine which additional items can now be composted, using services that are now available to your school. Enclosed you will find several lesson activities to cover these topics. If you have any questions or would like me to speak to your class you can contact m...|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1999 In 1996, Beach et al. first {{proposed}} {{the idea of}} mounting an echo-sounder on a Waverunner to measure nearshore beach profiles. This thesis discusses the Coastal Profiling System, {{an extension of the}} original work, which has been utilized to measure nearshore bathymetry at selected sites along the coasts of North Carolina, Oregon, and Washington. Position of the Coastal Profiling System is accurately measured five times per second using a differential global positioning system (DGPS), while depth below the hull is measured by an acoustic echo-sounder. Surveys can be conducted in waves up to 3 m and in depths of 1 - 15 m. The effects of waves, tides, and set-up are eliminated by the <b>co-collection</b> of position and depth data. In October 1997, extensive testing of the system took place at the SandyDuck ' 97 field experiment in Duck, NC. Nearshore bathymetric surveys were taken simultaneously by the Coastal Research Amphibious Buggy (CRAB) and the Coastal Profiling System (CPS). Comparison of the CPS with CRAB measurements interpolated to the same locations showed a mean bias of 4. 6 cm too shallow in the vertical and standard deviations about the bias of 5. 5 cm. The largest differences occur over the steeply sloping flanks of sand bars. The bias statistic, of central interest to these tests, is confused by the potential of boat tilt and by possible errors in the CRAB data itself. In July & August 1998, the system was tested as a tool for long-term coastal monitoring by the Southwest Washington Coastal Erosion Study in a regional morphology monitoring program (Ruggiero et al., 1997). A 2 - 3 km section in approximately the center of each of the four sub-cells of the Columbia River littoral cell, and an anomalous fifth site, was surveyed to map the morphology of each region. Alongshore-averaged profiles were decomposed into underlying AX[superscript m] profiles and deviations from this equilibrium profile. The mean of the exponents was close to 2 / 3 with m= 0. 70, but ranged between sites from 0. 56 to 0. 79. Shape parameters between 0. 027 and 0. 038 were estimated. Nearshore slopes (0 - 1 km cross-shore) were calculated from the exponential profile in the dissipative range with a minimum of 0. 0067 and a maximum of 0. 0089. However, no correlation was seen between the shape parameters and the 1 km nearshore slopes. An analysis of the deviations of the alongshore-averaged profiles from the equilibrium profile provided an objective method to determine sand bar positions from zero-down-crossings. Each site was characterized by a minimum of two sand bars in 2 - 6. 5 m (NAVD 88) depths with heights of 0. 2 - 2 m, lengths of 164 - 949 m and volumes of 48 - 534 m³/m. An additional bar in the swash zone between the + 1 m elevation and 1 m depth contour was resolved in some cross-shore profiles. The crest of the bar largest in height was located at 3 - 4. 5 NAVD 88 m at four of the five sites suggesting the profiles vary on similar cross-shore length scales amongst the sub-cells. A series of surveys in April, June, and October 1998 at the northern most site in Ocean City, WA demonstrated onshore bar migration and seaward accretion of the foreshore. This seasonal response was further quantified between August and October at Fort Canby. Three nearshore profiles surveyed by Willard Bascom et al. (1954) in the 1940 s were reoccupied to compare the shape of the morphology 50 years ago to present. These profiles demonstrate accretion of approximately 2 m elevation gains in the nearshore and 26 - 165 m of shoreline change. Although the Coastal Profiling System is a highly accurate, mobile and efficient method to obtain nearshore profiles, several improvements have been suggested. Future modifications to the system should include an increase in the precision of the echo-sounder measurements, higher sampling rates, and improvement of the user interface. Additional components may include an onboard navigation system, a thermister to measure temperature and salinity, and a motion sensor to measure roll and pitch of the vehicle...|$|E
