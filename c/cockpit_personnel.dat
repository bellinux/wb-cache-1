500|$|At the time, Crossair {{operated}} 17 Saab-340 type planes, {{but eventually}} phased {{them out with}} Embraer ERJ-145 regional jets. The crash came about {{in the midst of}} a bitter labor-management dispute between Crossair and its pilots over a possible pay raise and work rules changes. The pilots' union had just canceled pay agreements with Crossair in December 1999, with a termination effective in summer 2000. [...] In addition, and prior to the accident, two Crossair pilots told Swiss media that some foreign pilots employed by Crossair posed a safety risk because of an insufficient knowledge of English. These two pilots were fired by Crossair, but were then elected to head the pilots' union, [...] "Crossair <b>Cockpit</b> <b>Personnel</b> (CCP)". An investigation of the accident later revealed that the pilot Gruzin and copilot Koles√°r were only able to communicate with each other in English, but Gruzin's ability to speak English was too limited to hold more than a basic conversation.|$|E

There are studies reporting cancer risk in about ten cohorts of airline cabin crew and a similar number of studies in <b>cockpit</b> <b>personnel.</b> The cabin crew cohorts support the strong evidence o...|$|E
40|$|More than 60 % of all {{accidents}} in commercial jet operation {{can be attributed}} to errors of the flight crew. The existing redundancy in the multi-crew cockpit if often not used to increase performance effectively. The crew-induced accidents show as causal factors deficiencies regarding the exchange of information, the interpersonal interaction, decision-making and stress resistance. Therefore, crew resource management courses train the behavioural potential with respect to communication, leadership and teamwork, judgment and decision-making as well as stresscoping. This work summarizes the existing models and methods of training and gives recommendations concerning their optimization. In a special chapter the transfer of the concepts originally developed for <b>cockpit</b> <b>personnel</b> into air-traffic control is discussed. Peculiarities of this area are reported. (orig.)

On operational sorties, {{the crew is}} minimized to just pilots, navigator, and special-equipment operators, to reduce radiation exposure to mission-essential personnel only.|$|R

The interactions between pilots and management, and communication among crew members are examined.
