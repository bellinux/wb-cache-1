40|$|A major gap in most {{experimental}} research on framing effects is that stimuli often contain only one frame. In this between-subjects post-test only experiment, {{a representative sample}} of the Belgian population (N = 1000) rated four versions of a professionally designed campaign on combatting child poverty. In two conditions, only a single deproblematizing <b>counterframe</b> was present. In the two other conditions, the deproblematizing <b>counterframe</b> was combined with a problematizing frame. The results show that all versions were equally strong. One <b>counterframe</b> had remarkable significant effects, even when controlling for ten background variables. The <b>counterframe</b> The alarm clock increased societal attributions of poverty, rendered attitudes towards welfare more favorable and motivated people to actually donate money. Juxtaposition nullified the effects of The alarm clock, but also decreased blaming poverty on bad luck. This supports the assumption that the combination of multiple frames can lead to unique effects. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|This study {{analyzes}} the Denver Post’s reportage {{on the frame}} contest between the dominant narrative of the September 11 terrorist attacks set out by President Bush and a challenge to that narrative in an Internet essay by Professor Ward Churchill. The authors find that by refusing to interrogate Churchill’s sociopolitical argument, reducing it to the offensive rhetorical trope “little Eichmanns” he {{used to describe the}} victims of the attacks, and pillorying Churchill as a person and scholar, the Post assured his <b>counterframe</b> would not achieve parity with the dominant frame. The authors interpret this as an example of media hegemony and situate the Post’s coverage within a crisis of hegemony that left the “sacred core” of the Bush frame—American innocence and moral exceptionalism—vulnerable to contestation. Because the Churchill <b>counterframe</b> flagrantly transgressed that “sacred core,” it became the irresistible target of media hegemony strategies by the Denver Post...|$|E
40|$|After {{many years}} of climate negotiations, a universally binding {{agreement}} has become the main objective for many scientists and politicians {{in the field of}} international climate negotiations. The highly anticipated climate conference in Paris 2015 has been portrayed as a success by politicians, newspapers and international organisations worldwide. It seems reasonable to assume that the binding part of the agreement {{is one of the reasons}} to its perceived significance given the fact that a binding agreement, historically, has been difficult to achieve. Although the agreement has been celebrated and praised by several influential organisations such as the UN, this perspective has not been uncontradicted. Organisations such as Greenpeace and Friends of the Earth challenge the assumption that this is a milestone for humanity. This thesis seeks to explore this disagreement with a framing analysis. It is possible to identify two separate frames combatting for their beliefs to become perceived as the truth. The ”Successframe” is illustrated by the Swedish government. The successframe is challenged by the environmental organisations in what can be referred to as a <b>counterframe,</b> in this essay the <b>counterframe</b> is called the ”failureframe”. This thesis uses a theoretical framework inspired by Benford and Snow (2000), to explore why the successframe has become the dominating frame in the public discourse when discussing the Paris agreement. ...|$|E

The aim of the study is to gain insight in the prevailing frames in order to develop <b>counterframes.</b> <b>Counterframes</b> are less problematizing and are meant to be applicable in organizations’ internal communication, as {{it is possible that the}} problematizing nature of the dominant discourse can demotivate employees. First, an inductive framing analysis was conducted, using newspapers articles and texts from various stakeholders.

50|$|The {{abolitionist}} {{faction of}} the Animal Rights Movement often faces <b>counterframing</b> by dominant reformist organizations of the movement that frame radical advocacy as idealistic and schismatic. These reform-oriented nonhuman rights organizations direct resources to countering abolitionist claims and blocking abolitionists' access to discursive spheres. Another example of <b>counterframing</b> from opposition movement actors is found in Switzerland's 1998 referendum cycle, in which antivivisectionists' claims that animal research should be abolished were contested with claims that mobilized the public more. Antivivisection claims, which framed animal research as facilitating the genetic engineering of foods in hopes of seizing on public fear of genetic engineering, were countered by scientists and animal researchers, who framed vivisection as medically necessary to ensure human wellbeing.|$|R
40|$|Since 2003, the West and Central African (WCA) cotton {{initiative}} in the World Trade Organization has stood as an ambitious case of Africa's {{desire to be}} integrated into the trading system and yet also receive reparations for past injuries. This article seeks to explore how and why the initiative debuted through close attention to the interdependence between power and language in diplomatic practice. It takes the concept of cognitive framing to explore the relationship between political legitimacy and mobilisation capacities. The genesis of cotton as 'an issue' is critically examined, focusing on how the WCA countries constructed a novel 'competitive victim' frame to define themselves and the problem. While this opening move was effective, it also featured tensions that were exploited by Northern actors who were threatened by the campaign. I argue that what followed was the introduction of a politically driven 'counterframe', which divided the problem into a 'trade-related' component and a 'development-related' component. It is important to understand why and how this distinction was constructed and monitored. By scrutinising the relationship between framing and institutional power, I suggest that the <b>counterframe</b> won over the original frame, leading to a re-positioning of the demanders and a re-calibration of their expectations...|$|E
40|$|Public {{debates on}} nuclear {{technology}} are multifaceted and complex, {{especially when it}} comes to risks and benefits. Mass media play an important role in depicting the technology, by framing it as a problem or as a solution to their audience. Method: Framing is making some aspects of an issue more salient, while minimizing or omitting others. Nuclear fission, for example, can be presented as a very polluting source of energy (when considering nuclear waste) or a very clean one (when considering CO 2 -output). Frames seek to problematize an issue, since problems are more likely to draw attention. As such, problematized issues have a higher news value and a higher chance to get on the public agenda. However, (constant) problematization can also be problematic, leading to negative stereotypes or stigma. <b>Counterframes</b> aim to present the issue as non-problematic. Purpose: This research aims to investigate the frames and <b>counterframes</b> of nuclear energy technology. The <b>counterframes</b> of this technology have rarely been studied. This study also takes into account new views on and perceptions of nuclear energy, such as its possible role in combatting climate change, and the Fukushima nuclear accident. It uses examples from the Belgian context to illustrate frames and <b>counterframes.</b> Findings and conclusions: Based on an overview of media framing analyses, this paper gives a theoretical background for an in-depth analysis of the contemporary media presentations of nuclear energy technology. Further, this study indicates the importance of a well-balanced risk/benefit public communication for a more nuanced image of the effects of ionizing radiation, which could possibly lead to changes in public policy. Future research: Similar framing/counterframing-analyses for other nuclear technologies, such as medical applications and nuclear fusion, can be conducted to give insight in how differently (or similarly) they are presented to the public. The results of this study and future framing analyses could additionally be used in studies regarding framing effects, as a way to give the frames used in experiments more external validity. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Starting {{point of}} this study was the {{assumption}} that Alzheimer's disease is made worse for the person who has the disease by the negative regard in which the illness is held by society. The aim was to test by means of a campaign advertisement whether more nuanced <b>counterframes</b> could have an impact while remaining credible and comprehensible to the public. A sample of thousand people living in Belgium evaluated the campaign in an experimental design. This revealed that all the versions tested achieved a high average evaluation. The ad in which the heading referred to the fear of death and degeneration was judged to be most attention-grabbing, easier to understand, and more credible than the alternative heading with the idea that someone with Alzheimer's could still enjoy playing cards. Together, these findings provided a basis for the use of <b>counterframes</b> to generating a more nuanced image of Alzheimer's disease. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: This study {{discusses}} the frames {{that were used}} in the public debate about raising the retirement age in Belgium from 65 years to 67 years. The aim of the study is to gain insight into the prevailing frames in order to develop <b>counterframes,</b> that are less problematizing and can be used to bring more nuance to the debate. Design/methodology/approach: An inductive framing analysis was conducted, using articles from Flemish newspapers and magazines, published in a two-year period (March 2013 - March 2015). This sample was complemented by a convenience sample of texts by various stakeholders. The total sample consisted of 182 texts. Findings: The analysis yielded four problematizing frames and six deproblematizing <b>counterframes.</b> They cover both the meaning of work for the individual, and the effect that working longer has on society. Practical implications: The overview of the frames {{can be used as a}} tool to analyze existing communication, and to bring more nuance to future communication by introducing deproblematizing perspectives into the debate regarding the need to work for a longer period of time. Originality/value: In addition to giving an overview of existing frames, the study also constructed alternatives which can be used to deproblematize the issue of having to work longer. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|This article {{reports on}} the {{quantitative}} findings of a study that straddles the applied linguistic field of critical discourse analysis and a sociolinguistic field recently referred to as “queer linguistics”. Drawing on a quantitative method of analysis, the study investigates the linguistic framing of LGBT mobilisation in two South African newspapers, City Press and the Mail & Guardian, across a period of almost 30 years. It aims to identify {{the characteristics of the}} discourses that topicalise the gay [1] liberation movement in order to investigate the ways in which linguistic means have been used in articulating the need and the right to liberation and how arguments against the gay liberation movement have been framed, reframed and <b>counterframed</b> in South African media. The study’s findings revealed that a number of frames, including ‘liberation’, ‘rights’ and ‘victimisation’, reoccurred in the framing of arguments for the gay liberation movement throughout the data collection period in both corpora, and while City Press primarily used these frames to express anti-gay sentiments, the Mail & Guardian primarily used these frames to express pro-gay sentiments. The findings also revealed that a number of frames, including ‘religion’, ‘morality’ and ‘nature’, reoccurred in the framing of arguments against the gay liberation movement, and again while City Press primarily used these frames to express anti-gay sentiments, the Mail & Guardian primarily used these frames to express pro-gay sentiments. Finally, the findings revealed that a single frame such as “religion” was typically used to express both pro- and anti-gay sentiments, bringing to light the important role that <b>counterframing</b> plays in bringing about social transformation. [1] The word “gay” is used as a hypernym in this article as this {{is a reflection of the}} way in which the liberation movement was typically topicalised in the data. </div...|$|R
40|$|When cities host mega-events, {{such as the}} Olympic Games, {{these events}} change {{the context in which}} {{conventionally}} local political decisions are considered and made. This article follows Islamic movement Tablighi Jamaat’s proposed plans to build the large Abbey Mills Mosque in Newham, East London, and the controversy that followed. The analysis builds from media accounts, interviews with a leading mosque opponent, and ethnographic observation from religious gatherings at the Abbey Mills site. Taking a scalar politics approach, we investigate how the ‘mega’ scale of the mosque was framed and debated in media and opposition campaign accounts, and how Tablighi Jamaat belatedly responded with <b>counterframes</b> of its own. The ‘Olympics mega-mosque’ controversy would grow to encompass an increasingly broad public sphere and larger anxieties about national identity, government competence, and the integration of Muslims in Britain.

40|$|There were 7 {{assassination}} attempts on U. S. presidents between 1973 and 2001. In this article, we critically examine {{coverage of}} each attack in The New York Times and The Washington Post, describing how the coverage employs therapeutic discourse frames that position {{the president as}} vulnerable and portray the attackers as lonely and demented outsiders. Noticing contradictions in this pattern, we also identify <b>counterframes,</b> including those acknowledging the political motivations of the assassins, the diminished public sphere that is a context for those actions, and the contradictions in a legal system that denies the insanity pleas of those framed so extensively as mentally ill. Political science, psychology, and law enforcement researchers have recognized that assassination attempts are often driven by rational political and economic concerns. Our analysis thus {{points to the need}} for further research exploring therapeutic framing techniques of other instances of political violence that may discourage publics from thinking critically about protest, violence, and tragedy in the United States...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to grasp the {{influence}} of the newsroom on frame-building processes. First, journalists’ own understanding of “frames” and “framing” is discussed. Second, from an academic interpretation of these concepts, journalists’ framing practices are studied. To this end an ethnographic study was conducted at two newsrooms, one in Belgium and one in the Netherlands. The findings reveal that while the noun “frame” is sporadically used as a tool, the verb “framing” is considered as something from which a journalist should refrain. This is explained by the associations journalists make with strategic framing from sources as well as by the newspapers’ explicit attempt to no longer view the world from a single ideological frame. It is argued that the studied newsrooms have replaced ideology by, respectively, a <b>counterframing</b> strategy that strives to disprove existing frames (deframing) and a narrative approach that, one the one hand, sharpens existing frames but, on the other hand, offer more opportunities to create alternative frames (reframing) for events. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|In December 2008 {{the killing}} of a {{teenager}} by a Greek policeman in central Athens set off the ﬁercest social unrest the country has witnessed in recent decades. For almost three weeks, thousands of angry youths participated in mass demonstrations, in many cases resulting in rioting, looting and violent clashes with the police. Although new media technologies were heavily used by protesters, their role in the December 2008 events has not been systematically studied. This paper explores how the “Greek Riots” in 2008 were reported in the alternative news network Indymedia Athens. A key question the study addresses is whether grassroots reporting in Indymedia Athens served activists’ need for communication and solidarity building (“politics of identity”) or functioned also as an “out-group” communication channel that could counter negative mainstream reporting and communicate protesters’ messages to a wider population (“politics of inclusion”). The ﬁndings show that during the ﬁrst eight crucial days of the protests, the alternative outlet functioned ﬁrst and foremost as a tool for coordination and creation of identity, through the exchange of mobilization information and direct action news. A frame analysis of thematic posts shows that compelling <b>counterframes</b> are created by protesters’ narrations, but their potential to effectively challenge mainstream discourses and inﬂuence wider publics is unclear...|$|R
40|$|This study {{builds on}} the "community studies " {{tradition}} in urban sociology by examining the interconnec-tions among political opportunities, mobilizing structures, and strategic framing in the emergence and outcome of a locally-based movement. Traditional urban analyses contend {{that there must be}} an intimate bond of com-munity identity among individuals for them to engage in neighborhood collective action and political mobiliza-tion. This article challenges this assumption and examines "community identity " as a political strategy used by neighborhood coalitions and civil rights groups to contest public policies, neutralize <b>counterframes</b> and opposi-tion, and mobilize constituents. I examine the emergence of an anti-expressway movement in Kansas City, Mis-souri during the 1960 s and 1970 s to illustrate the structural relationship between political opportunities, mobilization, and identity. Political opportunities not only create motivations for mobilization through "struc-tural " changes (e. g., public policies, cycles of protest, and presence of external allies, etc.), but they also set in motion "ideational " shifts in political culture, expanding the cultural reservoir of strategic frames and enhanc-ing the potency of movement framing. This article explores the interconnections among political opportunities, mobilizing struc-tures, and strategic framing in the emergence of a locally-based movement.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{explores the}} oppositional framing techniques used by {{actors in the}} United States anti-human trafficking (AHT) campaign. Theoretically based in symbolic interactionism, I conduct a frame analysis of 12 years of newspaper articles (2000 - 2012), which comprises the official discourse of the AHT campaign in the United States. I unpack three frame disputes, where claims are challenged and the challenges are rebutted in three primary disputes: 1) the characteristics and experiences of human trafficking victims, 2) the credibility of quantitative estimates of the prevalence of human trafficking, and 3) the justification {{for the development of}} new AHT policy tools. Using inductive data analysis methods, I analyze the frames, <b>counterframes,</b> and reframes as they are embedded in the official anti-human trafficking discourse. 	I reveal a campaign where dominant actors use reframing strategies in concert to accomplish three larger discursive goals: 1) to veil inconsistencies and contradictions in their claims; 2) to insulate their claims from further scrutiny; and 3) to justify the continued interventions on the campaign’s behalf. By identifying how reframing strategies are used in concert with each other to serve as damage control functions, I contribute to a greater understanding of oppositional framing strategies.

In this dissertation, I illustrate the interactive nature of strategic framing {{processes of the}} American pro-life and pro-choice movements and the process whereby movements borrow and co-opt language and imagery from opposing movements. Illustrated by two case studies of reactive and strategic <b>counterframing</b> in the pro-choice and pro-life movements, I show how such framing complicates the boundaries between these movements' ideologies. What was once demarcated as progressive becomes a champion of conservative causes and vice versa. I extend social movement theories of interactive framing processes and boundary demarcation by contributing an analysis of instances where activists blur ideological boundaries between movements and risk weakening the collective identification of movement adherents. I have identified two "cases"� that exemplify this interactive framing process and the subsequent blurring of ideological boundaries between the pro-life and pro-choice movements [...] 1) pro-choice activists framing abortion as "good mothering" � and 2) pro-life activists framing abortion as "Black genocide". � I argue that as each movement responds to countermovement threats by borrowing and co-opting language and imagery from the opposing movement, the ideological boundaries between the pro-life and pro-choice movements are blurred. Blurred boundaries threaten the stability of each movement by weakening collective identity ties and risk marginalizing and alienating certain movement adherents...|$|R
40|$|While social {{movement}} scholars have added immeasurably {{to our knowledge}} of activist framing, few researchers analyze the circumstances leading to variation in the frames articulated by movement actors. In this study, I explore an important and understudied form of frame variation, whether activists use more moderate or more radical frames. Using framing data from the early twentieth-century U. S. women’s jury movements, I first show that activists offered both a more traditional and moderate difference frame, arguing that women should be permitted on juries because they would provide a unique female perspective in jury deliberations, and a more radical equality frame, stating that women had an equal right to sit on juries and they were as intellectually capable as men to do so. Second, I demon-strate {{that a combination of}} circumstances explains whether the jury activists were likely to articulate more moderate or more radical arguments. I find that frame variation is driven by activist organizational identities, a cultural and political resonance process, and a <b>counterframing</b> process. Findings from multinomial and binary logistic regression analyses reveal that all three processes influenced jury activist framing. Keywords: {{social movement}}s; women rights; legal rights; framing; juries.

40|$|Translation is power. As {{agents of}} power {{experienced}} translators can create powerful action frames that challenge the established routines. Iindividual beliefs that are sanctioned through ‘mutual awareness’ evolve into ‘collective beliefs’. The latter then are further shaped by properly translated frames {{to emerge as}} a social force. In this research paper, I explore how the collective action frames are restructured, specifically {{the role of the}} printed and electronic media in shaping the public discourse. The research is supported by the Bulgarian nuclear case, where an antinuclear collective action frame for less than ten years, was restructured into ‘national pride’ pro-nuclear frame through the translation of the media and what were the economic and political implications of such development. Structure of the Paper: In the first section of the paper, I explore in detail how global collective action frames develop and the three aspects involved in this processs-illegitimate inequality, identity and agency. Then I am interested what are the common beliefs that shape the collective identity of antinuclear movements and what is their collective action frame. Then briefly the Bulgarian case is introduced, wher by late 1980 ’s the frame over nuclear issues was overlapping with the global ‘sustainable frame’ that prevailed in most Western societies by that time. In the second section I explore what is what is the collective frame over the nuclear issues in the late 90 ’s and how the newly-emerged ‘national pride’ frame is a classical example for restructuring of a collective action frame. In the third section I explore the agents of the reframing process and more closely the role of the media in shaping the collective beliefs. In the final part I elaborate on the question how the process of mass media’s translation in the Bulgarian case was crucial for the complete shift of the frame from ‘sustainability’ to ‘national pride’. I conclude with the question of authorities, losing their legitimacy, because of their lack of creating <b>counterframes.</b> ...|$|R
40|$|This thesis investigates how and to {{what extent}} it is {{possible}} to mobilize citizens across ethnic boundaries in a deeply divided society. It focuses on one case in point, that of Bosnia-Herzegovina. The thesis first develops the analytical concept of postethnic mobilization as an alternative to similar but less precise terms such as multicultural, civic mobilization or anti-nationalist mobilization. Bosnia-Herzegovina is a crucial case with regard to postethnic mobilization, as it is a post-conflict society where deep divisions remain and where local politicians often mobilize national and religious allegations. Moreover, it is a consociationalist democracy, where ethnic divisions have been institutionalized at all levels of governance. The analysis, based on more than fifty qualitative interviews with activists, knowledgeable observers and analysts, takes a two-pronged approach. One the one hand it scrutinizes postethnic mobilization from the perspective of activists framings: which symbols and references do they use to mobilize and how do they relate to the cultural environment. On the other hand, it investigates these types of mobilizations from the perspective of political opportunity structure, consistentbut not necessarily formal or permanentdimensions of the political struggle that encourage people to engage in contentious politics (Tarrow, 2002). In addition, two cases of postethnic mobilization are analyzed in-depth: the case of the Sarajevo protests in 2008, and the case of Nasa Stranka, a new postethnic and multi-ethnic party. The thesis concludes that postethnic mobilization has more chances to develop in places where ethnic elites are less dominant, support groups such as labour organizations and religious organizations are not politicized and/or tied to nationalist parties and where the media are not ethnically divided. Rich social networks and absence of repression will further enhance the possibilities for postethnic mobilization, but they affect civil society in general and not postethnic mobilization specifically. -Secondly, resistance to postethnic mobilization will be lower in a state that is not a nationalizing state, i. e. a state that is an un-realized nation state and that strives to be one by promoting language, culture, demographic, disposition and political hegemony of the state-bearing nation. -Thirdly the emergence of postethnic mobilization in cities is influenced by three mutually constitutive factors:*The collective multi-ethnic identity of the city, i. e. a widespread attitude of tolerance among all the ethnic groups that is shared by the citys inhabitants, and which is promoted by the citizens and by its institutions and which is based in local history*The presence of a critical mass of people sharing that collective identity, enabling mobilization on a larger scale*The importance of the city for (multi-) ethnic elites. The absence of powerful ethnic elites who regard the city as an example for their national-based policies willstimulate postethnic mobilization, as will the presence of a multi-ethnic eliteTable of contents List of Tables	i List of Figures	ii List of Figures	ii List of Abbreviations	iii Acknowledgements	v Introduction	 1 CHAPTER 1 : THE CRUCIAL CASE OF BOSNIA-HERZEGOVINA	 5 1.
