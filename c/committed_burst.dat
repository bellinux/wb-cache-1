RFC 2697 proposes {{a more precise}} classification, with three [...] "colors". In this document, the contract is described through three parameters: Committed Information Rate (CIR), <b>Committed</b> <b>Burst</b> Size (CBS), and Excess Burst Size (EBS). A packet is [...] "green" [...] if it doesn't exceed the CBS, [...] "yellow" [...] if it does exceed the CBS, but not the EBS, and [...] "red" [...] otherwise.|$|E

40|$|Introduction The goal of {{this test}} was to verify the {{precision}} of traffic shaping as implemented by Cisco routers used in our CESNET 2 network and to check the influence of traffic shaping on the router load. The precision indicates how much we can rely on {{the shape of the}} processed traffic being compliant to the traffic shaping specification. Precision is an important parameter in large-scale diffserv-based networks with many aggregation points where incorrectly shaped traffic can cause congestions within the diffserv domain. The work was done {{as a part of the}} TF-NGN project Support of Delay and Jitter Requirements. Traffic shaping is specified by two parameters: CIR (Committed Access Rate) and Bc (<b>Burst</b> <b>Committed).</b> The shaped traffic can be sent at the maximum rate of CIR measured over any interval (called a shaping interval) equal to or greater than Bc/CIR. Within the shaping interval, the instantenous output rate can be higher, possibly up to the output link rate. The inpu...|$|R
40|$|To {{analyze the}} {{transcriptional}} activity of retroviral enhancer sequences in hematopoietic lineages, we determined {{the effect of}} enhancer sequences on {{the expression of the}} neomycin resistance gene transferred by two retroviral vectors to primary hematopoietic lineages. We constructed the vector pFr-SV(X). The Moloney murine leukemia virus enhancer region of a vector, pZIP-SV(X), was replaced by a 380 -nucleotide-long fragment containing the enhancer sequences of the Friend murine leukemia virus. The enhancer sequences of Friend murine leukemia virus were used because these sequences have been shown to target the disease specificity of the virus to the erythroid lineage. Hematopoietic progenitors in murine continuous marrow cultures were infected with identical numbers of pure defective, infectious viral vector particles of either pFr-SV(X) or pZIP-SV(X). Expression of the transferred neomycin resistance gene in multipotential stem cells and their differentiated progeny was assayed as the ability of infected progenitors to form colonies (greater than 50 cells) in G 418. Expression of the neomycin resistance gene in multipotential progenitor cells during the entire 11 weeks of the cultures was independent of the vector used to transfer the gene. Conversely, <b>committed</b> hemoglobinized erythroid <b>bursts</b> and myeloid colonies resistant to G 418 were consistently produced by pFr-SV(X) -infected cultures but not pZIP-SV(X) -infected cultures. These results demonstrate that both pFr-SV(X) and pZIP-SV(X) were stably integrated and expressed in more primitive, multilineage, hematopoietic progenitor cells and suggest that the enhancer sequences of a vector affects expression of the transferred neomycin resistance gene when these cells differentiate to committed myeloid and erythroid cells...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — Marking in DiffServ at {{the edge}} of the network often follows a demand side policy. It meters a traffic stream and marks its packets {{according}} to some predefined traffic parameters as Committed Information Rate, <b>Committed</b> <b>Burst</b> Size, Excess Burst Size and so on. Such marking based on traffic characteristics is irrespective to network dynamics, which causes collision and QoS degradation in DiffServ. This paper proposes flow-based Reservation Marking as a supply side marking at the network edge, which marks stream packets reserved or unreserved according to flow-specific reservation in a distributed resource reservation environment. When conges-tion occurs, anticipant per flow QoS is secured by protecting reserved packets on core routers without any per flow or per trunk management. It provides a simple, scalable and adaptive mechanism of implementing quantitative end-to-end QoS by mapping per flow in IntServ into per class in DiffServ. A “once reserve, no more manage ” framework is constructed to eliminate flow state, avoiding unexpected collision and flow management simultaneously on core routers. Performance evaluation reveals that it affords controllable and quantitative QoS, keeps networks core-stateless and achieves high link utilization at the same time. I...|$|E
