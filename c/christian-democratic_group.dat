40|$|Main Content of this Work is to {{describe}} in detail Part of political Trials in Czechoslovakia during the first Part of 1950 's, focused against political Opponents coming from Czechoslovak People's Party (ČSL) or Roman Catholic. The Topic - political Trial with "Leaders of illegal anti-state <b>Group</b> <b>Christian-Democratic</b> Party (KDS) " in 1955 and related Trials - is almost unprocessed. The Goal of this Work is to sketch long-lasting "crusade", managed by the communist Power, against "virtual political Entity KDS". This "crusade" should culminate by public political Trial with Leaders of KDS. I'd like to focus on Secret state Police (StB) and its searching of Leaders of KDS, showing the Mechanism of anti-state Groups' Construction too. During the final Part I'd like to show continuance of struggle against other Groups of KDS after the Year 1955 until 1960 's and introduce real activities of KDS' Leaders...|$|R
50|$|Active in {{the fields}} of charity, culture and religion, Roca earned most prestigious {{position}} in the realm of Catalan sport. Though not a sportsman himself, already in the mid-1930s he grew into the presidency of Federación Catalana de Fútbol and became secretary general of the football club FC Barcelona. Due to his sensitive political standing he was not in position to resume the duties during initial decades of Francoism, but in the early 1960s he re-entered the executive of Mutua del C. de F. Barcelona. In 1963 he is first reported as vice-president of the already iconic Catalan club and retained this position at least until the very late 1960s; in the early 1970s he was noted as elected to Junta Directiva of the club, though not as a VP anymore.In 1967 Roca replaced Pau Romeva as head of Commissió Permanent. This change coincided with revision of the hitherto party's alliance strategy. Though Unió recurrently defended attempts to create more unitary platforms of political opposition, it remained highly cautious about entering initiatives which hosted also parties of extreme left; under the new Roca leadership UDC joined ranks with PSUC in Commisió Coordinadora de Forces Politiques de Catalnuya. Apart from traditional Catalanist and <b>Christian-democratic</b> profile, the <b>grouping</b> adopted also some social-democratic tones and assumed a decisively pro-EEC stand. During late Francoism UDC emerged as one of more popular Catalan groupings, its moderate Christian-democratic and nationalist profile appealing to Catalan bourgeoisie. At that time already advanced in age and suffering from deteriorating health, Roca ceded many roles to his son, Miquel. He was unable to attend the first official national congress of UDC, staged in 1976 and passed away shortly afterward due to pulmonary edema.|$|R
