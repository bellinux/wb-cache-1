40|$|To {{improve our}} {{understanding}} of the mechanism of chilling injury in chill-sensitive callus (Cornus stolontfera), early changes in cell permeability and respiratory activity were studied. Partial leakage of amino acids and an abrupt increase in permeation and oxidation of added dopamine were characteristic of chilled callus in the late stage of chilling at 0 °C (48 hr), when most of the callus sustained severe injury. However, little or no change in cell permeability was observed in the early stage of chilling (within 24 hr), when calli retained their viability for growth after transfer to a warm temperature. These results suggest that changes in the cell membranes per se are by no means the pri-mary step in cell injury. Temporary depression of respiratory activity was detected soon after chilling for 12 hr, but activity appeared to return to the original level on further <b>chilling</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> 24 hr. An irreversible dysfunction, however, occurred in the respiratory system on prolonged <b>chilling</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> 48 hr. This implies that irreversible impairment of mitochondrial functions may not be involved in the early stage of the cell injury. A possible relationship between these observed changes and ultrastructural changes in chilled cells is discussed...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to compare two {{chilling}} methods, combined (aerosol) and water chilling, {{in terms of their}} effectiveness in chilling of different weight categories of broiler chickens. At the same time microbial associations of different weight categories of broiler chickens were evaluated. Samples were collected in an approved establishment and poultry carcasses were divided according to weight and chilling methods into five categories. The first four categories were chilled using combined chilling method and fifth category was chilled with water. The temperature of the breast muscle before and after chilling and microbiological parameters (total viable count, Enterobacteriaceae, Salmonella) was measured. By comparing the temperature of the breast muscle after combined chilling method was not achieved in the breast muscles temperature below 4 °C in all weight categories. In any case, the lowest average temperature has been reached in the weight category < 1. 2 kg (4. 9 °C) and with increasing weight, the average temperature was rising, and the highest was in weight category 1. 8 to 2. 5 kg (10. 8 °C). Poultry carcasses were subsequently divided into portions and after cutting were <b>chilled</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> a temperature below 4 °C. In poultry carcasses chilled by water, the average temperature of the breast muscle after 20 minutes in the water bath was even higher (19. 6 °C) compared to combine chilling. Thus chilled poultry carcasses were frozen <b>up</b> <b>to</b> - 18 °C in a core of muscles. Comparing the microbiological contamination in different weight categories and chilling techniques, we found that the lowest total viable count (TVC) before and after chilling was in the lowest category and the difference before chilling was significantly lower comparing with all other categories. Conversely TVC after chilling by water was decreased. In comparing the number of Enterobacteriaceae before and after chilling, a similar pattern of contamination as above was found.

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{chilling}} on photosystem II (PSII) efficiency was {{studied in the}} variegated leaves of Calathea makoyana, {{in order to gain}} insight into the causes of chilling-induced photoinhibition. Additionally, a relationship was revealed between (chilling) stress and variation in photosynthesis. Chilling treatments (5 degrees C and 10 degrees C) were performed for different durations (1 - 7 d) under a moderate irradiance (120 mu mol m(- 2) s(- 1)). The individual leaves were divided into a shaded zone and two illuminated, chilled zones. The leaf tip and sometimes the leaf base were not chilled. Measurements of the dark-adapted F-v/F-m were made on the different leaf zones {{at the end of the}} chilling treatment, and then for several days thereafter <b>to</b> monitor recovery. <b>Chilling</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> 7 d in the dark did not affect PSII efficiency and visual appearance, whereas chilling in the light caused severe photoinhibition, sometimes followed by leaf necrosis. Photoinhibition increased with the duration of the chilling period, whereas, remarkably, chilling temperature had no effect. In the unchilled leaf tip, photoinhibition also occurred, whereas in the unchilled leaf base it did not. Whatever the leaf zone, photoinhibition became permanent if the mean value dropped below 0. 4, although chlorosis and necrosis were associated solely with chilled illuminated tissue. Starch accumulated in the unchilled leaf tip, in contrast to the adjacent chilled irradiated zone. This suggests that photoinhibition was due to a secondary effect in the unchilled leaf tip (sink limitation), whereas it was a direct effect of chilling and irradiance in the chilled illuminated zones. The PSII efficiency and its coefficient of variation showed a unique negative linearity across all leaf zones and different tissue types. The slope of this curve was steeper for chilled leaves than it was for healthy, non-stressed leaves, suggesting that the coefficient of variation may be an important tool for assessing stress in leaves...|$|R

40|$|Woody {{perennial}} plants including blackberries (Rubus subgenus Rubus Watson) require certain amounts of chilling or rest hours below 7 T during the dormant season for successful bud break the following year. Blackberry cultivars developed in Arkansas are being grown in various climates worldwide, and all cultivars need chilling requirement estimates for accurate recommendations of adaptation. Determining chilling requirements using stem cuttings collected from field-grown plants rather than whole plants is a desirable system. We {{conducted a study}} to evaluate both artificial- and field-chilling of six cultivars. For the artificial-chilling study, 12 -node stem cuttings were collected 2 days after the first killing frost. These were then placed in a moist medium in a walk-in cooler at 30 C. At- 100 hour chilling intervals, five cuttings of each cultivar were placed under an intermittent mist system. For the field-chilling study, a biophenometer {{was placed in the}} field to measure chill, and ten 12 -node stem cuttings of each cultivar were collected at 100 -lwur intervals of <b>chilling</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> 1000 hours below 72 ̆ 7 C and placed under intermittent mist. For both studies the mist bench was located in a heated greenhouse (min. temperature of 15 T), and cuttings were placed according to a completely random design. Bud break was recorded weekly. Studies were analyzed separately by SAS. Results for Study One, artificial chilling, were inconclusive {{due to a lack of}} clear differentiation among the cultivars and their chilling intervals. Study Two, using field-chilling, showed a significant chilling-interval x cultivar interaction. 2 ̆ 7 Arapaho 2 ̆ 7 appeared to have a chilling requirement of 400 to 500 hours, 2 ̆ 7 Kiowa 2 ̆ 7 200 hours, 2 ̆ 7 Shawnee 2 ̆ 7 400 to 500 hours. and 2 ̆ 7 Chickasaw 2 ̆ 7 probably near that of Shawnee.

40|$|Graduation date: 1992 Dormancy of 'Pinot Noir' grapevines was characterized. Primary buds {{required}} ca 300 cumulative chilling hours (CCH) {{to initiate}} the transition from endodormancy to ecodormancy, which occurred in mid November. Additional <b>chilling,</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> 1000 CCH, improved budbreak. Changes in bud water content were estimated by gravimetric and spectroscopic methods. Total, intra-, and extracellular water were measured gravimetrically. The total water and the intracellular fraction increased during the ecodormant period. A method to evaluate bud water status by proton-nuclear magnetic resonance was developed. Grape buds present anisotropic behavior. Using this method, water content was partitioned into free and bound fractions. Free water was always larger than bound water. Furthermore, bound water reached its peak in January when ecodormant plants were exposed to colder temperatures. These results support former evidence that bound water is composed of one population with restricted mobility, and another in a transient state. Respiration pattern of overwintering buds was investigated using differential scanning calorimetry. Endodormant buds decreased their respiration. In February, an increase in respiration, typical of the period preceding budbreak, was observed in ecodormant buds. Ecodormant and breaking buds were classified into four developmental stages. Those stages were: ecodormant, initial swelling, fully swollen, and broken buds. Isothermal experiments at 25 °C were done to evaluate metabolic heat rate, CO₂ evolution rate, and metabolic efficiency. Also, buds were scanned from 1 to 60 °C (7 °C/hr) to estimate activation energy and Q₁₀ values. Metabolic heat rates were 5, 17, 28, and 29 μW/mg dw, respectively, for the four bud developmental stages listed above. In the same order, CO₂ evolution increased from 2 to 3, 6, and 7 /μW/mg dw. The efficiency of metabolism, however, decreased during the initial swelling stage. High apparent activation energy values for ecodormant and initial swelling buds showed that metabolism at those stages is slow, mostly because it is energetically expensive. As the buds developed, activation energy decreased, indicating a more favorable condition from a thermodynamic standpoint. Q₁₀ values demonstrated that grapevines are highly responsive to temperature. Water content and respiration activity are useful indicators of metabolic activity...|$|R

Swordfish landed alive, {{and to a}} lesser extent prerigor, have better quality when unloaded. Warmer fishing waters did not lead to poorer quality at unloading. There was a serious loss of quality during long fishing trips. Sex had no influence on swordfish quality. Three methods of chilling were evaluated: refrigerated seawater (RSW) <b>chilling</b> for <b>up</b> <b>to</b> 2 days followed by storage under ice, refrigerated brine (seawater with extra salt added) for <b>up</b> <b>to</b> 2 days followed by storage in a freshwater ice slurry, and ice slurry (freshwater ice mixed with seawater) for <b>up</b> <b>to</b> 2 days followed by storage under ice only. Two fishing trips were monitored for each method. The freshness indicator K value was used to determine which method produced the best quality swordfish when unloaded at the factory. Storage method played a larger role in quality loss than capture conditions. Refrigerated brine produced the best quality swordfish when the machinery functioned properly closely followed by RSW. Ice slurry chilling of large fish such as swordfish exhibited initial delays in the reduction of core temperature which led to lower quality. This method could be improved with the addition of mechanical circulation. Mechanical problems, which resulted in minor increases of temperature during brine storage, led to a much larger loss of quality than would be expected...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe {{effect of}} rapid and slow {{chilling}} on survival and nisin sensitivity {{was investigated in}} Escherichia coli. Membrane permeabilization induced by cold shock was assessed by uptake of the fluorescent dye 1 -N-phenylnapthylamine. Slow chilling (2 degrees C min(- 1)) did not induce transient susceptibility to nisin. Combining rapid chilling (2, 000 degrees C min(- 1)) and nisin causes a dose-dependent reduction in the population of cells in both exponential and stationary growth phases. A reduction of 6 log of exponentially growing cells was achieved with rapid chilling {{in the presence of}} 100 IU ml(- 1) nisin. Cells were more sensitive if nisin was present during stress. Nevertheless, addition of nisin to cell suspension after the rapid <b>chilling</b> produced <b>up</b> <b>to</b> 5 log of cell inactivation for exponentially growing cells and 1 log for stationary growing cells. This suggests that the rapid chilling strongly damaged the cell membrane by disrupting the outer membrane barrier, allowing the sensitization of E. coli to nisin post-rapid chilling. Measurements of membrane permeabilization showed a good correlation between the membrane alteration and nisin sensitivity. Application involving the simultaneous treatment with nisin and rapid cold shock could thus be of value in controlling Gram negatives, enhancing microbiological safety and stability...|$|R

Performing the warming treatment at {{the period of time}} before chilling injury is irreversible during storage, and it is the first prerequisite for a successful IW treatment. In order to determine the fruit physiochemical changes and time of irreversible chilling injury incidence during cold storage of pomegranate fruit (cv. Rabab-e-Neyriz), this research was conducted. Fruits were stored at 2 ± 0. 5 °C and 90 ± 5 % relative humidity for 90 days. At 15 -day intervals, 40 fruits (four replicates and 10 fruits in each replicate) were sampled and further stored at 20 °C for 3 days (shelf life). Chilling injury (CI) index and weight loss (WL) in intact fruits, electrolyte leakage (EL) and K leakage (KL) in peel samples, total soluble solids (TSS), titratable acidity (TA), TSS/TA ratio and pH in fruit juice were measured.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Large blood-based {{epidemiological}} studies require simple, cost-effective sample collection methods. Immediate sample separation or rapid transport of chilled blood samples {{to a central}} laboratory may be impractical or prohibitively expensive. To assess the feasibility and reliability of transporting blood samples over several days at ambient temperature (e. g. by mail), we evaluated the stability of various plasma analytes in samples stored at room temperature or chilled. METHODS: Multiple vacutainers of blood, containing EDTA and aprotinin as preservative, were drawn from 12 volunteers and stored at 21 degrees C or 4 degrees C. Immediately after collection and 1, 2, 3, 4, and 7 days later, vacutainers stored at each temperature were centrifuged, and the plasma was aliquoted and stored at - 80 degrees C. Subsequently, all aliquots from each individual were analysed in one analytical run {{for a range of}} chemistries. RESULTS: In whole blood stored at room temperature for <b>up</b> <b>to</b> 7 days, concentrations of albumin, apolipoproteins A 1 and B (apoA 1 and apoB), cholesterol, high density lipoprotein (HDL), total protein, and triglycerides changed by less than 4 %, and low density lipoprotein (LDL) by less than 7 %. Whilst alanine transaminase (ALT), creatine kinase (CK), creatinine, and gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) concentrations changed substantially at room temperature, there was less than 4 % change during <b>chilled</b> storage <b>up</b> <b>to</b> 7 days. By contrast, aspartate transaminase (AST) concentrations increased markedly under both conditions.

40|$|Extreme {{temperatures}} cause spikelet sterility in {{rice and}} thus yield losses. Predicting sterility {{is difficult because}} organ temperature may differ from air temperature. Four rice genotypes were planted under irrigated flooded conditions in a similar replicated design in four environments: the relatively humid dry season in the Philippines, the summer season in southern France and the cold-dry and hot-dry seasons in northern Senegal. Panicle temperature was measured by IR photography on ca. 4000 images, complemented with simultaneous monitoring of micro-climatic variables on the floodwater-canopy-air continuum. Spikelet sterility was observed at the population scale at grain maturity, and canopy morphology was also characterized (plant height, leaf area index, panicle position within the canopy and panicle exertion). The period and time of day of anthesis (TOA) was estimated using a model developed on the same experiments as described in a previous paper. Panicle temperature varied between 9. 5 ?C below and 2 ?C above air temperature at 2 m. During TOA it was on average slightly warmer than {{the air in the}} Philippines and significantly colder in Senegal. Spikelet sterility was disaggregated into three components caused by chilling at microspore stage, incomplete panicle exertion at anthesis and high panicle temperature at anthesis. <b>Chilling</b> caused <b>up</b> <b>to</b> 100 % and heat <b>up</b> <b>to</b> 40 % sterility, the former mainly in the Senegal cool-dry season and the latter in the Philippines. All genotypes avoided heat sterility in the hot-dry season in Senegal despite air temperatures <b>up</b> <b>to</b> 40 ?C, by a combination of escape (early TOA) and avoidance (transpiration cooling). Only one genotype had no chilling induced sterility due to physiological tolerance. It is concluded that heat stress causing sterility is more likely to occur in warm-humid than hot-arid environments due to humidity effects on transpiration cooling. Models predicting global warming effects on sterility losses need to consider microclimate and organ temperature, and research is now needed on the genetic control of panicle transpiration cooling.

The survive ability of sperm in fresh semen is very limited therefore reducing the temperature to - 5 °C (chilled semen) or - 196 °C (frozen semen) could be done to maintain its survive ability. Optimalization of frozen semen could be done by diluting in Tris extender with 6 % glycerol, equilibrating for 4 hours and cooling for 4 – 5 minutes above surface of LN 2 before stored in LN 2 (- 196 °C).

60|$|He {{stood with}} poised spear {{above his head}} waiting for the instant that would expose a {{vulnerable}} part of the ape-man's body and still not endanger one of the blacks. Closer and closer he edged about, following {{the movements of the}} twisting, scuffling combatants. The growls of the ape-man sent cold <b>chills</b> <b>up</b> the warrior's spine, causing him to go carefully lest he miss at the first cast and lay himself open to an attack from those merciless teeth and mighty hands.|$|R
5000|$|On January 7, 2015, Parnell and the Mets {{agreed to}} a one-year deal worth $3.7 million, and avoided arbitration. Parnell made {{his return to the}} Major Leagues in a June 13 win against the Atlanta Braves at Citi Field. Parnell pitched well in the relief {{appearance}} and said of his return, [...] "It sent <b>chills</b> <b>up</b> my spine." [...] However, Parnell's fastball velocity was noticeably lower than before his surgery and manager Terry Collins described Parnell as looking [...] "rusty." ...|$|R
5000|$|Paul Verna from Billboard {{called this}} song a [...] "gorgeous duet." [...] Chuck Taylor from Billboard {{reviewed}} [...] "The Prayer", calling it [...] "a breathtaking, ultra-lush song, and {{the tour de}} force combination of Dion and Bocelli which will send a half-dozen <b>chills</b> <b>up</b> your spine." [...] Although {{he felt that the}} song is [...] "an unorthodox track for the radio," [...] Taylor called it [...] "affecting," [...] "heartwarming," [...] "absolutely exquisite" [...] and [...] "one of Dion's most radiant performances ever." ...|$|R
40|$|Aqueous extract of mate (dried {{leaves of}} Ilex paraguariensis) added to {{drinking}} water for broilers {{for the last}} 14 days prior to slaughter did not affect performance at 25 days of age, but improved oxidative stability of the chicken meat. Oxidative stability of precooked breast meat made from control meat (CON) and from meat of broilers raised on water with mate added was investigated during <b>chill</b> storage for <b>up</b> <b>to</b> 7 days. The use of mate showed no influence {{on the content of}} lipids in chicken breast meat; however, lipid oxidation measured as thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS) was significantly lower for meat from broilers raised on water with mate extracts in different concentrations (MA 0. 1, MA 0. 5, and MA 1. 0 corresponding to 0. 1, 0. 5, and 1. 0 % of mate dried leaves). The relative effect was largest at 1 day of storage with more than 50 % reduction on TBARS; the result was still significant after 3 days, but almost vanished after 7 days, when oxidative rancidity was very high in all samples. In meat from broilers raised on water with mate extract, vitamin E was protected during cooking, although in the very rancid meat balls at 7 days of storage, the protection almost disappeared. Nevertheless, mate can be an interesting natural alternative to be used in chicken diets to improve lipid stability of the meat...|$|R
