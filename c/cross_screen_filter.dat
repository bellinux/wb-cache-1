40|$|The {{present study}} aimed to {{evaluate}} the proper cylindrical <b>screen</b> <b>filters</b> are manufacturing locally in Egypt. The cylindrical <b>screen</b> <b>filter</b> materials are available locally. The evaluations are test under different sources of water (surface water and ground water). The operating characteristics of cylindrical <b>screen</b> <b>filters</b> predicated by knowledge of different mesh per linear inch, some hydraulic properties and effect of water quality on the operation age. The study reveals that some cylindrical <b>screen</b> <b>filters</b> can be used after sand filters when the source of water is surface water and located directly after pump station when the source of water is ground water. <b>Screen</b> <b>filters</b> are best selected for water source with low solid's concentration as insurance for (clean water) or as secondary filter downstream of a pre-filter. This is especially valuable because it can help identify faults in any micro irrigation system. The construction, measuring theory, operation, tests results and applications of two different sites will be described herein...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, a {{research}} {{that deals with}} the problem of determining of the visibility of the alphanumeric presentation on CRT and LCD screens is presented, in conditions when the <b>screen</b> <b>filters</b> are used, and when they are not used.

It is determined the existence of differences in visibility of alphanumeric presentations when <b>screen</b> <b>filters</b> are used, compared to conditions when they are not used. This difference was statistically significant, while the visibility of the presented alphanumeric symbols on CRT and LCD screens that use <b>screen</b> <b>filters</b> is lower than when they are not used.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the head loss through disc and <b>screen</b> <b>filters</b> installed in trickle irrigation control head using data acquisition and analysis system. Basically, the acquisition system is composed by pressure and flow transducers connected to signal conditioner, A/D converter and controlled by a PC microcomputer. The results showed that the mathematical behavior of the head loss for both type of filters could be explained significantly at level of 1 %, by the power function H-f=a. Q(b). Despite the mesh and flow used, the disc filters had higher values of head loss when compared to <b>screen</b> <b>filters.</b> For the disc filters, the mesh 155 had head loss values higher than the mesh 120, and for the <b>screen</b> <b>filters</b> the difference of the head loss values between the two meshes was not significant. The developed acquisition system showed a good performance during the tests, having no failure or misfunctioning which could lead to misunderstanding the acquisition and the analysis of data...|$|R
