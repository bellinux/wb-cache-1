5|$|As {{its first}} {{enforcement}} legislation, Congress passed the <b>Civil</b> <b>Rights</b> <b>Act</b> of 1866, guaranteeing black Americans citizenship and {{equal protection of}} the law, though not the right to vote. The amendment was also used as authorizing several Freedmen's Bureau bills. President Andrew Johnson vetoed these bills, but Congress overrode his vetoes to pass the <b>Civil</b> <b>Rights</b> <b>Act</b> and the Second Freedmen's Bureau Bill.|$|E

50|$|In the 1860s, Americans adapted this usage to newly freed blacks. Congress enacted <b>civil</b> <b>rights</b> <b>acts</b> in 1866, 1871, 1875, 1957, 1960, 1964, 1968, and 1991.|$|R

5|$|In the 1950s, the Civil Rights Movement {{increased}} {{pressure on the}} federal government to protect the voting rights of racial minorities. In 1957, Congress passed the first civil rights legislation since Reconstruction: the <b>Civil</b> <b>Rights</b> <b>Act</b> of 1957. This legislation authorized the Attorney General to sue for injunctive relief on behalf of persons whose Fifteenth Amendment rights were deprived, created the Civil Rights Division within the Department of Justice to enforce civil rights through litigation, and created the Commission on Civil Rights to investigate voting rights deprivations. Further protections were enacted in the <b>Civil</b> <b>Rights</b> <b>Act</b> of 1960, which allowed federal courts to appoint referees to conduct voter registration in jurisdictions that engaged in voting discrimination against racial minorities.|$|E
5|$|The Citizenship Clause {{overruled}} the Supreme Court's Dred Scott {{decision that}} black people were not citizens and could not become citizens, nor enjoy the benefits of citizenship. Some members of Congress voted for the Fourteenth Amendment in order to eliminate doubts about {{the constitutionality of the}} <b>Civil</b> <b>Rights</b> <b>Act</b> of 1866, or to ensure that no subsequent Congress could later repeal or alter the main provisions of that Act. The <b>Civil</b> <b>Rights</b> <b>Act</b> of 1866 had granted citizenship to all persons born in the United States if they were not subject to a foreign power, and this clause of the Fourteenth Amendment constitutionalized this rule.|$|E
5|$|The Freedmen's Bureau {{enforced}} {{the amendment}} locally, providing {{a degree of}} support for people subject to the Black Codes. Reciprocally, the Thirteenth Amendment established the Bureau's legal basis to operate in Kentucky. The <b>Civil</b> <b>Rights</b> <b>Act</b> circumvented racism in local jurisdictions by allowing blacks access to the federal courts. The Enforcement Acts of 1870–1871 and the <b>Civil</b> <b>Rights</b> <b>Act</b> of 1875, in combating the violence and intimidation of white supremacy, were {{also part of the}} effort to end slave conditions for Southern blacks. However, the effect of these laws waned as political will diminished and the federal government lost authority in the South, particularly after the Compromise of 1877 ended Reconstruction in exchange for a Republican presidency.|$|E

50|$|Consistent {{with the}} {{political}} and social concerns of Reform Judaism, the RAC {{played a key role in}} important political events of the American <b>civil</b> <b>rights</b> movement, the struggles of Soviet Jewry, as well as the ongoing humanitarian crisis in Darfur. It hosted several meetings at which the groundwork for the various pieces of legislation, including the <b>Civil</b> <b>Rights</b> <b>Acts</b> and Voting <b>Rights</b> <b>Acts,</b> were laid. It also shielded <b>civil</b> <b>rights</b> marchers who were attacked by District of Columbia police.|$|R
5|$|Abolition of untouchability: Article 17 of the {{constitution}} abolishes the practice of untouchability. Practice of untouchability is an offence and anyone doing so is punishable by law. The Untouchability Offences Act of 1955 (renamed to Protection of <b>Civil</b> <b>Rights</b> <b>Act</b> in 1976) provided penalties for preventing a person from entering a place of worship or from taking water from a tank or well.|$|E

Many of {{the organizers of the}} Nashville sit-ins went on to become important leaders in the Civil Rights Movement.|$|E
5|$|Congress overrode a Johnson veto to {{pass the}} <b>Civil</b> <b>Rights</b> <b>Act</b> of 1866 (also {{introduced}} by Trumbull), granting African-Americans citizenship and equality before the law, and forbidding any action by a state to the contrary. Johnson made the gap between him and Congress wider when he accused Stevens, Sumner, and Wendell Phillips of trying to destroy the government.|$|E
40|$|The <b>Civil</b> <b>Rights</b> Movement {{is deeply}} {{intertwined}} with Lyndon B. Johnson. Throughout his career, Johnson supported the quest of African-Americans {{for political and}} <b>civil</b> <b>rights.</b> They found in him an ally whose role was fundamental in fullfilling the goals of Martin Luther King, Jr, and the <b>Civil</b> <b>Rights</b> Movement. This paper will examine {{the role of the}} Johnson presidency in the passage of the <b>Civil</b> <b>Rights</b> <b>Acts</b> of 1957 and 1964...|$|R
50|$|During the <b>Civil</b> <b>Rights</b> <b>Acts</b> and Native American {{self-determination}} {{movements in}} 1960s and 1970s, tribal leaders decided {{there was a}} need for change in failed federal education policy to improve education for American Indian students to serve their communities, leading to the creation of tribal colleges and universities (TCUs).|$|R
25|$|Following these events, the North Carolina {{legislature}} {{passed a}} new constitution with voter registration requirements for poll taxes and literacy tests that effectively disfranchised black voters, following {{the example of the}} state of Mississippi. Blacks were essentially disfranchised until after Congressional passage of the <b>civil</b> <b>rights</b> <b>acts</b> of the mid-1960s.|$|R
5|$|King {{organized}} and led marches for blacks' right to vote, desegregation, labor rights, and other basic civil rights. Most of these rights were successfully enacted into {{the law of}} the United States {{with the passage of the}} <b>Civil</b> <b>Rights</b> <b>Act</b> of 1964 and the 1965 Voting Rights Act.|$|E
5|$|On December 21, 1865, {{two days}} after the {{announcement}} that the States had ratified the Thirteenth Amendment, which abolished slavery, Wilson introduced a bill to protect the civil rights of African Americans. Although Wilson's bill failed to pass Congress it was effectively the same bill as the <b>Civil</b> <b>Rights</b> <b>Act</b> of 1866 that passed Congress over Johnson's veto on April 9, 1866.|$|E
5|$|Passage of the {{national}} <b>Civil</b> <b>Rights</b> <b>Act</b> of 1964 had {{paved the way for}} an even stronger civil rights bill in the 1966 legislative session. The Assembly easily passed the Kentucky <b>Civil</b> <b>Rights</b> <b>Act</b> opening all public accommodations to people of every race and prohibiting racial discrimination in employment by firms that employed eight or more people. The act applied to many kinds of businesses not covered by the federal statute, and approximately ninety percent of the businesses in Kentucky were affected, compared to only sixty percent that were covered by the federal statute. The act was {{the first of its kind}} passed in a southern state. In 1966, Breathitt was presented with the Lincoln Key Award for his leadership in the bill's passage. In 1966 and 1967, he was chair of the Southern Governors' Conference's Committee on Regional and Interstate Cooperation. He was also the only state governor named to the President's Council on Human Rights.|$|E
50|$|An {{amendment}} {{offered by}} Democrats {{would have required}} the proposal to state clearly {{that it would not}} interfere with the protections offered by Michigan's past <b>civil</b> <b>rights</b> <b>acts.</b> That, along with other amendments, failed. Varying opinions exist as to if the proposal would give an out to those anti-discrimination laws.|$|R
50|$|The {{hospital}} {{served only}} African Americans until the <b>Civil</b> <b>Rights</b> <b>Acts</b> of 1964. From 1967 it accepted all races and nationalities. In 1978 Mayfield Cottage {{was sold to}} the Caudle family, who moved the structure a mile away to save it from demolition and opened it as a bed-and-breakfast in 1986.|$|R
50|$|The {{decision}} that the Reconstruction-era <b>Civil</b> <b>Rights</b> <b>Acts</b> were unconstitutional has not been overturned; on the contrary, the Supreme Court reaffirmed this limited reading of the Fourteenth Amendment in United States v. Morrison, , in which it held that Congress {{did not have the}} authority to enact parts of the Violence Against Women Act.|$|R
5|$|Stevenson opposed {{almost every}} effort to expand blacks' rights beyond the {{minimums}} assured by federal amendments and legislation. The <b>Civil</b> <b>Rights</b> <b>Act</b> of 1866 guaranteed that blacks could testify against whites in federal courts, but he opposed New Departure Democrats when they insisted that Kentucky amend its laws to also allow black testimony against whites in state courts, and the measure failed in the 1867 legislative session. Later that year, the Kentucky Court of Appeals declared the <b>Civil</b> <b>Rights</b> <b>Act</b> unconstitutional, but a federal court soon overturned that decision. Stevenson backed Bourbon Democrats' appeal of that decision to the Supreme Court of the United States. By 1871, however, he had {{changed his mind and}} supported blacks' right to testify. Despite Stevenson's support, the measure failed in the General Assembly again in 1871, but it passed the following year, after Stevenson had left office.|$|E
5|$|U. S. v. Rhodes (1866), one of {{the first}} Thirteenth Amendment cases, tested the Constitutionality of {{provisions}} in the <b>Civil</b> <b>Rights</b> <b>Act</b> of 1866 that granted blacks redress in the federal courts. Kentucky law prohibited blacks from testifying against whites—an arrangement which compromised the ability of Nancy Talbot ("a citizen of the United States of the African race") to reach justice against a white person accused of robbing her. After Talbot attempted to try the case in federal court, the Kentucky Supreme Court ruled this federal option unconstitutional. Noah Swayne (a Supreme Court justice sitting on the Kentucky Circuit Court) overturned the Kentucky decision, holding that without the material enforcement provided by the <b>Civil</b> <b>Rights</b> <b>Act,</b> slavery would not truly be abolished. With In Re Turner (1867), Chief Justice Salmon P. Chase ordered freedom for Elizabeth Turner, a former slave in Maryland who became indentured to her former master.|$|E
5|$|In , (1872) the Supreme Court {{heard another}} <b>Civil</b> <b>Rights</b> <b>Act</b> case {{relating}} to federal courts in Kentucky. John Blyew and George Kennard were white men visiting the cabin {{of a black}} family, the Fosters. Blyew apparently became angry with sixteen-year-old Richard Foster and hit him twice {{in the head with}} an ax. Blyew and Kennard killed Richard's parents, Sallie and Jack Foster, and his blind grandmother, Lucy Armstrong. They severely wounded the Fosters' two young daughters. Kentucky courts would not allow the Foster children to testify against Blyew and Kennard. But federal courts, authorized by the <b>Civil</b> <b>Rights</b> <b>Act,</b> found Blyew and Kennard guilty of murder. When the Supreme Court took the case, they ruled (5–2) that the Foster children did not have standing in federal courts because only living people could take advantage of the Act. In doing so, the Courts effectively ruled that Thirteenth Amendment did not permit a federal remedy in murder cases. Swayne and Joseph P. Bradley dissented, maintaining that in order to have meaningful effects, the Thirteenth Amendment would have to address systemic racial oppression.|$|E
