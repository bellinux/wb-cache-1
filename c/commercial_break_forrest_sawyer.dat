In addition, a senior at the University of Maryland and a junior at the University of California, Berkeley, present their own ideas about student rights {{and how best to}} deal with on-campus alcohol abuse and the associated issues of crime and unsafe sex...|$|R

For five years, Northrop was a producer for the CBS Morning News, planning, coordinating and executing {{the program on}} a daily basis.

50|$|Dr. Kamler's {{radio and}} {{television}} appearances include NPR's Fresh Air, CBS' 48 Hours, Dateline NBC, ABC's 20/20, Fox News, NBC News, Bloomberg News, Today Show, Larry King Live, and multiple specials on National Geographic, Discovery, and History channels.

5000|$|Turning Point was {{an hour-long}} {{documentary}} program {{focused on a}} single topic, making it similar to CBS' 48 Hours, which it ran directly opposite for some of its run. The program tended toward sensational topics, such as former members of Charles Manson's [...] "Family" [...] and much coverage of the O. J. Simpson murder case, which was current {{for much of the}} program's run. ABC News figures appearing regularly on the program included Diane <b>Sawyer,</b> <b>Forrest</b> <b>Sawyer,</b> Meredith Vieira, Peter Jennings and Barbara Walters.|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} number (0, 3, 6) and {{placement}} (natural, unnatural) of <b>commercial</b> <b>breaks</b> on perception, comprehension and memory were examined. Eighty-eight college students were shown {{one of two}} films and then asked to complete six tasks: (1) estimation of film's duration, (2) rating of film's comprehensibility, (3) summarization of story plot and theme, (4) scene recognition, (5) temporal ordering of scenes, and (6) identifying the location of <b>commercial</b> <b>breaks.</b> Overall, results suggest that an unnatural placement of <b>commercial</b> <b>breaks</b> has an adverse effect on cognitive processing and that performance increasingly deteriorates with more <b>commercial</b> <b>breaks.</b> Conversely, <b>commercial</b> <b>breaks</b> appearing at natural breakpoints led to a higher overall performance that was less affected {{by the number of}} <b>commercial</b> <b>breaks</b> that occurred. An effect of film was also found, suggesting that a film with a more organized plot structure can integrate natural <b>commercial</b> <b>breaks</b> more beneficially than a less-structured film...|$|R
5000|$|On the Money Extra: The day's trivia {{question}} {{was asked by}} the anchor before the <b>commercial</b> <b>break,</b> with the answer revealed after the <b>commercial</b> <b>break.</b>|$|R
50|$|The series {{consists}} of six hour-long episodes. Each episode is introduced by <b>Forrest</b> <b>Sawyer</b> and narrated by Edward Herrmann. Period photographs and location filming are intercut with stage and screen actors in appropriate period costume reading as {{figures of the}} time, including Campbell Scott (Thomas Jefferson), Philip Bosco (Benjamin Franklin), Victor Garber (John Dickinson), Alex Jennings (King George III), Roger Rees (Thomas Paine), Philip Seymour Hoffman (Joseph Plumb Martin), Terrence Mann (Gen. John Burgoyne), Colm Feore (Alexander Hamilton), Sebastian Roché (The Marquis de Lafayette), Donna Murphy (Abigail Adams), Austin Pendleton (Benjamin Rush) and Peter Donaldson (John Adams). Stephen Lang read the words of George Washington, but is not seen on camera.|$|R
5000|$|Production of {{the program}} was moved to ABC's {{headquarters}} in the Lincoln Square district of New York City on July 11, 1988, when <b>Forrest</b> <b>Sawyer</b> and Paula Zahn debuted as co-anchors. In mid-1992, production of World News This Morning was combined with that of the network's then recently launched overnight news program World News Now, with the same anchor team appearing on both programs. Initially, some elements from World News Now were brought over to World News This Morning including the [...] "Morning Papers" [...] segment and that program's Yanni-composed theme music (played over the original World News This Morning opening graphics) as well as the laid-back attitude.|$|R
50|$|MTG {{said they}} weren't {{allowed to use}} <b>commercial</b> <b>breaks</b> in the {{terrestrial}} network. The <b>commercial</b> <b>break</b> were replaced by captions. Kanal 5 did however continue broadcasting their <b>commercial</b> <b>breaks</b> as they did on satellite. In January 2001, MTG introduced an extra fee of 115 SEK for TV3, ZTV and TV8 to cover the losses made as they didn't broadcast advertising.|$|R
50|$|In Greece, {{where most}} {{television}} stations and channels do not remove their logo before a <b>commercial</b> <b>break,</b> it is mandatory for public and commercial TV stations {{to separate the}} advertisements {{from the rest of}} the program with each station's ident. Subliminal advertising, tobacco and medication advertisements are not allowed. Most programmes (series, documentaries, etc.) can have one <b>commercial</b> <b>break</b> every 20 minutes. Advertisements must not exceed the 15% of the broadcasting day or 20% if there are direct advertisements for buying or renting products (like informercials). A <b>commercial</b> <b>break</b> must not exceed the length of 4 minutes with the exceptions of movies/telefilms with the length exceeding the 45 minutes, which can have one <b>commercial</b> <b>break</b> for 9 minutes and of the movies/telefilms that exceed the length of 110 minutes which can have more than one <b>commercial</b> <b>break</b> every 45 minutes for 9 minutes.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the choice of}} <b>commercial</b> <b>breaks</b> by a television network in both monopoly and duopoly settings. Viewers dislike commercials in the model, while the networks seek to maximize the total audience for these commercials through their choice of the number, length, and timing of <b>commercial</b> <b>breaks.</b> The model’s prediction of a network’s optimal choice seems to match what we observe in reality; in particular, <b>commercial</b> <b>breaks</b> appear more frequent {{toward the end of}} the program, and the optimal length of breaks is single-peaked. In duopoly equilibrium, <b>commercial</b> <b>breaks</b> on two networks must have the same length and appear at the same time. Compared to monopoly, the breaks in a duopoly equilibrium are longer and/or appear later...|$|R
50|$|In 1978, Muffie Meyer and Ellen Hovde formed Middlemarch Films, Inc. As Middlemarch, they {{produced}} and directed {{a variety of}} series and specials for PBS, {{most of which were}} written and co-produced by Ronald Blumer. One was the Emmy Award-winning film, An Empire of Reason. Hosted by Cokie Roberts, it featured performances by Mario Cuomo, Ed Koch, Walter Cronkite, John Chancellor, William F. Buckley, Andrea Mitchell, Phil Donahue, <b>Forrest</b> <b>Sawyer,</b> Robert MacNeil, Al Roker, and many others. Meyer also co-directed (with Ellen Hovde) Enormous Changes at the Last Minute: Virginia's Story, a feature film for ABC, based on stories by Grace Paley. The film was written by Oscar nominee John Sayles, and starred Emmy Award-winning actress Ellen Barkin, Oscar nominee David Strathairn, Ron McLarty, and Kevin Bacon.|$|R

50|$|Fox, {{who started}} {{covering}} NASCAR in 2001, resisted {{the use of}} the technology for many years. By about 2010, however, executives began exploring the concept. In 2011, they conducted one experimental <b>commercial</b> <b>break</b> with a split-screen format. Through 2011, Fox has preferred to air traditional, full-screen commercials, and if any action occurs during the break, their policy is to interrupt the commercial and return to the live action (e.g. at the 2013 Auto Club 400, the broadcast was in a <b>commercial</b> <b>break</b> when Clint Bowyer blew an engine and spun, so the feed immediately cut the <b>commercial</b> <b>break</b> right away; at the 2013 Aaron's 499, the feed was in <b>commercial</b> <b>break</b> when a crash occurred on lap 43). FOX returned to using the side-by-side coverage during the 2012 Daytona 500.|$|R
