5|$|The scheme {{presented}} in the table {{is known as the}} impedance analogy. <b>Circuit</b> <b>diagrams</b> produced using this analogy match the electrical impedance of the mechanical system seen by the electrical circuit, making it intuitive from an electrical engineering standpoint. There is also the mobility analogy, in which force corresponds to current and velocity corresponds to voltage. This has equally valid results but requires using the reciprocals of the electrical counterparts listed above. Hence, M → C, S → 1/L, D → G where G is electrical conductance, the inverse of resistance. Equivalent circuits produced by this scheme are similar, but are the dual impedance forms whereby series elements become parallel, capacitors become inductors, and so on. <b>Circuit</b> <b>diagrams</b> using the mobility analogy more closely match the mechanical arrangement of the circuit, making it more intuitive from a mechanical engineering standpoint. In addition to their application to electromechanical systems, these analogies are widely used to aid analysis in acoustics.|$|E
5|$|In the {{synthesis}} of CMOS circuits, the function to be synthesized is represented as a formula in Boolean algebra. Then this formula is translated into two series-parallel multigraphs. These graphs {{can be interpreted as}} <b>circuit</b> <b>diagrams</b> in which the edges of the graphs represent transistors, gated by the inputs to the function. One circuit computes the function itself, and the other computes its complement. One of the two circuits is derived by converting the conjunctions and disjunctions of the formula into series and parallel compositions of graphs, respectively. The other circuit reverses this construction, converting the conjunctions and disjunctions of the formula into parallel and series compositions of graphs. These two circuits, augmented by an additional edge connecting the input of each circuit to its output, are planar dual graphs.|$|E

500|$|The <b>circuit</b> <b>diagrams</b> in {{this article}} follow the usual {{conventions}} in electronics; lines represent conductors, filled small circles represent junctions of conductors, open small circles represent terminals for connection to the outside world. [...] In most cases, impedances are represented by rectangles. [...] A practical circuit diagram would use the specific symbols for resistors, inductors, capacitors etc., but topology is not concerned {{with the type of}} component in the network so the symbol for a general impedance has been used instead.|$|E
500|$|The {{topology}} of {{an electronic}} circuit is the form {{taken by the}} network of interconnections of the circuit components. [...] Different specific values or ratings of the components are regarded as being the same topology. [...] Topology is not concerned with the physical layout of components in a circuit, nor with their positions on a circuit diagram. [...] It is only concerned with what connections exist between the components. [...] There may be numerous physical layouts and <b>circuit</b> <b>diagrams</b> that all amount to the same topology.|$|E
500|$|Bridge {{topology}} is {{an important}} topology with many uses in both linear and non-linear applications, including, amongst many others, the bridge rectifier, the Wheatstone bridge and the lattice phase equaliser. [...] There are several ways that bridge topology is rendered in <b>circuit</b> <b>diagrams.</b> [...] The first rendering in figure 1.8 is the traditional depiction of a bridge circuit. [...] The second rendering clearly shows the equivalence between the bridge topology and a topology derived by series and parallel combinations. [...] The third rendering is more commonly known as lattice topology. [...] It is not so obvious that this is topologically equivalent. [...] It {{can be seen that}} this is indeed so by visualising the top left node moved {{to the right of the}} top right node.|$|E
