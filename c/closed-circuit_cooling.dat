50|$|Crystal Lagoons’ {{has focused}} efforts on {{developing}} industrial applications {{that would help}} solving key issues, such as water and energy scarcity, as well as environmental damage.Some of these applications are: sustainable close-circuit cooling systems for industrial processes (used in power plants, datacenters, foundries, solar power plants); air conditioning and heating; sustainable sea water purification systems for desalination processes; and mining (infiltration of underground aquifers to mitigate {{the negative effects of}} draughts, water treatment for Pump Storage).As result, Crystal Lagoons’ sustainable <b>closed-circuit</b> <b>cooling</b> applications generate high-quality water at very high temperatures. The latter can be potentially used for additional industrial processes, such as thermal desalination, material drying, residential heating, greenhouse heating, and a wide variety of membrane distillation processes that can desalinate water without using additional energy, thus saving water and energy. These applications avoid environmental damage and they are able to capture and later use energy currently wasted.Crystal Lagoons’ sustainable cooling system for thermal power plants was successfully applied to Endesa’s San Isidro combined-cycle thermal power plant for more than a year. The project proved mathematical models, validating sustainability and optimal heat and cold transfer rates. This technology is currently being commercialized.Crystal Lagoons has recently created an alliance with a well renowned European scientific research institution in order to develop its first desalination plant. The latter will dramatically reduce the consumption of energy when obtaining fresh water.|$|E
40|$|Climate {{variability}} {{and change}} affect electricity generation in several ways. Electricity generation is directly dependent on climate/weather parameters like wind (wind power generation) or air temperature and resulting water temperature (thermal power plants). River discharge {{as a result}} of precipitation and temperature, the latter being one main factor influencing evapotranspiration, is important for hydro power generation and cooling of thermal power plants. In this study possible effects of climate variability and change on electricity generation in Germany are analyzed. Considered is electricity generation by thermal power plants, wind power plants and hydro power plants. While hydro power plants and thermal power plants are affected negatively due to declining river discharge or higher water temperatures, for wind power generation no clear tendency was found. The reduction for hydro power generation could be leveled out by a slight increase in installed capacity and modernization of turbines and generators. By a replacement of old once-through cooling systems by <b>closed-circuit</b> <b>cooling</b> systems for new thermal power plants the negative impacts on electricity generation can be reduced significantly. The planned increase of installed capacity for wind power generation clearly surpasses the changes arising from climate change...|$|E
40|$|The {{availability}} of electric power {{is an important}} prerequisite for the development or maintenance of high living standards. Global change, including socio-economic change and climate change, is a challenge {{for those who have}} to deal with the long-term management of thermoelectric power plants. Power plants have lifetimes of several decades. Their water demand changes with climate parameters in the short and medium term. In the long term, the water demand will change as old units are retired and new generating units are built. The present paper analyses the effects of global change and options for adapting to water shortages for power plants in the German capital Berlin in the short and long term. The interconnection between power plants, i. e. water demand, and water resources management, i. e. water availability, is described. Using different models, scenarios of socio-economic and climate change are analysed. One finding is that by changing the cooling system of power plants from a once-through system to a <b>closed-circuit</b> <b>cooling</b> system the vulnerability of power plants can be reduced considerably. Such modified cooling systems also are much more robust with respect to the effects of climate change and declining streamflows due to human activities in the basin under study. Notwithstanding the possible adaptations analysed for power plants in Berlin, increased economic costs are expected due to declining streamflows and higher water temperatures...|$|E
40|$|The project {{involved}} the design, construction {{and testing of}} a 3000 kW converter-fed synchronous motor as a development prototype with - HTS rotor windings, - <b>closed-circuit</b> <b>cooling</b> system, - stator air-gap winding and -high-gradient HTS magnetic bearing. The project objective was to create the conditions necessary {{for the construction of}} an application-oriented model(#approx# 2 MW) that would be suitable for field tests and provide a starting point for subsequent series expansion. The main focus was fixed on feasibility and function issues relating to the various components, particularly during operation of the overall system in the test bay. These ambitious targets were achieved within the scope of project-based cooperation. This has been demonstrated especially in test bed operation of the machine since spring 2001, in the course of which the motor produced a maximum continuous rating of 450 kW - significantly above the specified value - while the short-time rating could be increased up to 600 kW. Throughout testing the motor demonstrated excellent performance characteristics that are markedly indifferent to load fluctuations and indicative of important operating advantages to subsequent users of such HTS motors. Loss calculations showed that, in terms of efficiency, this prototype already represents an approximately 1 % improvement over the conventional motors or generators currently available. The robustness of the cooling concept developed as part of the project was also convincingly demonstrated during the comprehensive test phase, which has been ongoing since spring 2001. The innovative pulse-tube coolers developed by our partner companies Leybold and TransMIT promise further advantages over current commercial GM-coolers. Despite considerable problems with materials the team successfully built and operated a contactless HTS magnet bearing (based on YBCO stator cylinders from partner company ATZ) that is currently one of the world's largest in terms of bearing capacity. A bearing of this type functions passively; in other words, it does not require any actively controlled electronic components and could therefore be an important development for high-speed machines in future. In the light of these positive results, additional questions were investigated in connection with the scaling-up of findings and procedures in the application-relevant power range of several MW and with the analysis of critical components (including winding technique, torque transmission, cooling). This further improved the prerequisites for successor projects and for subsequent implementation of the development results. (orig.)

40|$|This project {{addresses}} three {{closely related}} and similarly complex questions: First, using currently available simulation software, what methods might {{be appropriate for}} comparing slabintegrated radiant cooling to more conventional alternatives, such that the results are sufficiently fair and comprehensive to support system selection and design? Second, what is the relative performance of representative system configurations across a set of climates that test presumed strengths and limitations? Third, what useful conclusions {{can be drawn from}} such comparisons to inform the selection, application, design, and control of hydronic radiant cooling? The particular approach taken to answering these questions is rooted in the contention that useful results must effectively capture five essential aspects of slab-integrated hydronic radiant cooling: a) radiant heat transfer between surfaces; b) the effects of thermal capacity, lag, and decrement in the chilled slab; c) the limitations of evaporative cooling water sources; d) the potential of various control strategies for maintaining thermal comfort while minimizing energy consumption and peak loads; and e) the challenges and benefits of integrating the operation and control of hydronic and airside space conditioning systems. This report describes whole-building simulations of slab-integrated hydronic radiant cooling with mechanical ventilation, plus a more conventional all-air cooling system as a point of reference.  Simulations are performed using Virtual Environment (VE) —an interconnected set of building performance-modeling tools from Integrated Environmental Solutions (IES). Methods are described for the modeling of hydronic radiant cooling slabs. Among these, THERM, a simple two-dimensional finite-element heat transfer tool from Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, is used for determining properties of the heat transfer path between the hydronic circuits and cooling surfaces. Attention is also given to modeling limitations of evaporative cooling as a supply water source for the radiant system and waterside economizer for the all-air baseline system. In preparing the models, emphasis was placed on achieving similar degrees of equipment and controls optimization for both systems using methods that could be replicated in the context of practical design processes. Cooling-season performance is evaluated in terms of system dynamics, thermal comfort, peak loads, and energy consumption for a prototypical office building in Denver, Sacramento, Los Angeles, and San Francisco. The Denver climate was used to optimize system dynamics and performance for minimum energy consumption and peak power. Sacramento—the hottest of the four—was the focus for optimizing and evaluating thermal performance with aggressive hydronic slab nighttime precooling. For the San Francisco climate, added emphasis was placed on optimizing the economizer controls and performance for the all-air baseline system. In all cases, equipment, airflow, and other key parameters were evaluated and re-sized accordingly. The slab-integrated hydronic radiant cooling is augmented by a dedicated outside air system (DOAS) for conditioning of ventilation air. The hydronic cooling and DOAS utilize only indirect evaporative cooling sources. The supply water source for the hydronic slabs and cooling coils is a <b>closed-circuit</b> <b>cooling</b> tower. The DOAS also incorporates a heat exchanger for sensible energy recovery and indirect-evaporative cooling of ventilation air via a spray chamber in the exhaust air stream. The reference baseline is a modern variable-air-volume system with an efficient watercooled chiller and fully integrated control resets for supply air temperature and airsideeconomizer operation. A waterside economizer or waterside “free cooling” (WSFC) —essentially the same cooling water source as is used for the hydronic radiant system—and nighttime precooling cycle were modeled as an additional scenario for the baseline system. The DOAS and VAV system use identical high-efficiency fans and motors (differing only in size). Simulation results (Figures 1 – 4) suggest strong energy-saving potential for radiant cooling systems in both Colorado and California climates. In Denver (Figure 1), the simulated radiant cooling plus dedicated outside air system (Radiant+DOAS) with precooling uses an estimated 71 % less energy than the standard VAV baseline system and 62 % less than the same VAV system using waterside free cooling and a nighttime precooling control strategy. This comparison includes heating for cool mornings, which must be coordinated with the nighttime slab precooling strategy. In Sacramento (Figure 2), the Radiant+DOAS uses an estimated 59 % less energy relative to the baseline VAV system and 56 % less than the VAV with waterside free cooling, regardless of the inclusion of precooling controls. For this hot but relatively dry climate, the added fan energy for precooling with the all-air VAV system, given its capacity for WSFC is sized for chiller heat rejection, offsets the savings from reduced daytime chiller operation. In Los Angeles (Figure 3), where daytime temperature are more moderate and nighttime temperatures tend not to dip quite as low, precooling—in this case used only for the Radiant+DOAS—confers a lesser net benefit. For San Francisco (Figure 4), where cooling loads are reduced and airside “free cooling” is readily available through economizer operation (which still requires the use of fans), total energy for both systems is considerably lower. However, the effectiveness of waterside free cooling in this climate contributes to even greater reduction of energy consumption for the otherwise already very efficient hydronic radiant system...|$|E
