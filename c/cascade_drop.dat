50|$|Most {{parts of}} the {{navigation}} are canal sections such as this - most only receive flow from opening of locks, small field ditches and rainfall. However a re-engineered brook (the Old Rive Ditch) alongside the Basingstoke Canal at West Byfleet make all sections {{up to a point}} near Sheerwater Bridge, Woking receive a light minimum flow. The tallest non-ecclesiastical/civic building in South-East of England outside London pre-dating about 1880 is the east of the former mill blocks, which are now apartments. A tree-lined towpath and lakeside path run to the lock as does a cul-de-sac for vehicles leading to the apartments. The Mill Pond at Coxes Lock is the largest on the Wey Navigation and helps to control the water depth above an engineered rapid 8 ft millstream <b>cascaded</b> <b>drop,</b> which was originally one drop with a turning waterwheel. In some 19th-century sources, Cox's Lock is recorded.|$|R

2500|$|To {{the west}} rising from {{a patch of}} white gravel next to the hōjō and {{extending}} up the hillside lies the [...] which has been laid out in 1806 and designated as Place of Scenic Beauty. From {{the center of the}} garden a <b>cascade</b> <b>drops</b> down ending in a small pond. On the top of an artificial hill {{at the back of the}} garden is the tea house known as [...] It was donated in 1814 by the Tomishima family, a wealthy merchant family from Mukaishima across the strait. According to unconfirmed history, this tea house was originally found inside Fushimi Castle from where it was moved to Hongan-ji, Kyoto until it was disassembled in the late 16th/early 17th century and became property of the Tomishima family. Roteki-an is a single-storied, irimoya style structure with thatched roof. Inside it has a three-mat space for guests and a temaeza (seat for host) in the daime style (3/4 mat). There is a (shōbanseki, 相伴席) mat for additional or special guests.|$|R

50|$|A {{demultiplexer}} can {{be achieved}} by <b>cascading</b> multiple <b>drop</b> sections of the OADM, where each drop element uses an FBG set to the wavelength to be demultiplexed. Conversely, a multiplexer {{can be achieved}} by cascading multiple add sections of the OADM. FBG demultiplexers and OADMs can also be tunable. In a tunable demultiplexer or OADM, the Bragg wavelength of the FBG can be tuned by strain applied by a piezoelectric transducer. The sensitivity of a FBG to strain is discussed below in fiber Bragg grating sensors.|$|R

50|$|The {{first three}} waterfalls on the Black River as it {{approaches}} Lake Superior are Narrows Falls, Chippewa Falls, and Algonquin Falls. They {{are the three}} smallest named waterfalls on the river. Narrows and Algonquin Falls are technically rapids or <b>cascades.</b> Chippewa Falls <b>drops</b> nearly 10 ft over boulders and dead tree limbs. These area have limited access and are not often visited.|$|R
5000|$|The falls (more {{accurately}} {{described as}} a chute or <b>cascade,</b> since the <b>drop</b> in water level is more horizontal than vertical) are created by a narrowing {{in the flow of}} water between Lovesick Lake and Lower Buckhorn Lake on the west and Stoney Lake to the east. [...] At one time the landform was known as the [...] "Burleigh chute".|$|R
5000|$|Twister Falls (also {{known as}} Crossover Falls, Crisscross Falls, Bowtie Falls, and Eagle Creek Falls) is a {{prominent}} waterfall that is formed as Eagle Creek cascades 140 ft {{into a narrow}} canyon and forms two streams that appear to [...] "twist" [...] around each other, hence the name [...] "twister". The falls begin with a small sliding <b>cascade</b> that <b>drops</b> 5 ft over a rocky slope into a pool, followed by some rapids. The next tier is the twisting tier, which plunges 50 ft. Before this point, {{a small portion of}} the stream splits off and makes a sheer plunge of approximately equal height down the canyon. Then, the waters combine and form a final drop of 80 ft.|$|R
40|$|We {{report and}} {{experimentally}} demonstrate {{the generation of}} impulse radio ultrawideband (UWB) pulses using a photonic chip frequency discriminator. The discriminator consists of three add-drop optical ring resonators (ORRs) which are fully programmable using thermo-optical tuning. This discriminator chip in combination with a phase modulator forms a temporal differentiator where phase modulation is converted to intensity modulation (PM-IM conversion). By means of tailoring the discriminator response using either the individual or the <b>cascade</b> of <b>drop</b> and through responses of the ORRs, first-order or second-order temporal differentiations are obtained. Using this principle, the generation of UWB monocycle, doublet and modified doublet pulses are demonstrated. The use of this CMOS-compatible discriminator is promising for the realization of a compact and low cost UWB transmitter...|$|R
40|$|Using <b>cascades</b> and <b>drops</b> {{existing}} in flow path {{has a history}} of 3000 years. Particularly, Roman engineers employed stepped spillways with the same idea in several countries; however, there are few information about the hydraulic performance of aqueducts. Most of these channels have flat long cross sections with low torsions (variable slope) such that they can encompass cascade and steep spillways or dopshaft. Given that there are few studies conducted on dropshafts, the present paper attempted to discuss about such structures in flow path and water transmission lines as well as introducing the existing principles and relations and present, the obtained results of designing though Flow 3 D. The obtained error percentage was about 20 % which is acceptable for numerical studies...|$|R

40|$|Flow {{visualization}} {{techniques were}} used to show {{the behavior of the}} horseshoe vortex in a large scale turbine stator <b>cascade.</b> Oil <b>drops</b> on the end wall surface flowed in response to local shear stresses, indicating the limiting flow streamlines at the surface. Smoke injected into the flow and photographed showed time averaged flow behavior. Neutrally bouyant helium filled soap bubbles followed the flow and showed up on photographs as streaks, indicating the paths followed by individual fluid particles. Preliminary attempts to control the vortex were made by injecting air through control jets drilled in the end wall near the vane leading edge. Seventeen different hole locations were tested, one at a time, and the effect of the control jets on the path follwed by smoke in the boundary layer was recorded photographically...|$|R

50|$|In case of {{continuously}} operated ball mill, {{the material}} to be ground is fed from the left through a 60° cone and the product is discharged through a 30° cone to the right. As the shell rotates, the balls are lifted up on the rising side of the shell and then they <b>cascade</b> down (or <b>drop</b> down on to the feed), from {{near the top of the}} shell. In doing so, the solid particles in between the balls and ground are reduced in size by impact.|$|R
5000|$|Vitruvius {{recommends}} a low gradient of {{not less than}} 1 in 4800 for the channel, presumably to prevent damage to the structure through erosion and water pressure. This value agrees well with the measured gradients of surviving masonry aqueducts. The gradient of the Pont du Gard is only 34 cm per km, descending only 17 m vertically in its entire length of 50 km: it could transport up to 20,000 cubic metres a day. The gradients of temporary aqueducts used for hydraulic mining could be considerably greater, as at Dolaucothi in Wales (with a maximum gradient of about 1:700) and Las Medulas in northern Spain. Where sharp gradients were unavoidable in permanent conduits, the channel could be stepped downwards, widened or discharged into a receiving tank to disperse {{the flow of water}} and reduce its abrasive force. The use of stepped <b>cascades</b> and <b>drops</b> also helped re-oxygenate and thus [...] "freshen" [...] the water.|$|R

40|$|We {{propose a}} model which {{explains}} how power-law crossover behaviour can arise {{in a system}} which is capable of experiencing cascading failure. In our model the susceptibility of the system to cascades is described by a single number, the propagation power, which measures {{the ease with which}} cascades propagate. Physically, such a number could represent the density of unstable material in a system, its internal connectivity, or the mean susceptibility of its component parts to failure. We assume that the propagation power follows an upward drifting Brownian motion between <b>cascades,</b> and <b>drops</b> discontinuously each time a cascade occurs. Cascades are described by a continuous state branching process with distributional properties determined by the value of the propagation power when they occur. In common with many cascading models, pure power law behaviour is exhibited at a critical level of propagation power, and the mean cascade size diverges. This divergence constrains large systems to the subcritical region. We show that as a result, crossover behaviour appears in the cascade distribution when an average is performed over the distribution of propagation power. We are able to analytically determine the exponents before and after the crossover...|$|R
