5|$|Millennium Park {{is built}} {{on top of a}} large {{underground}} parking garage. Construction started before the park's design was completed, and in January 2000, 17 additional <b>caissons</b> had {{to be added to the}} partially built garage to support the weight of Gehry's pavilion. In April the tops of all these <b>caissons</b> had to be rebuilt for changes in the pavilion's foundation.|$|E
5|$|The <b>caissons</b> are {{required}} to turn with the wheel {{in order to remain}} level. Whilst the weight of the <b>caissons</b> on the bearings is generally sufficient to rotate them, a gearing mechanism using three large identically sized gears connected by two smaller ones ensures that they turn at precisely the correct speed and remain correctly balanced.|$|E
5|$|Shinanos launch on 8 October 1944, with Captain Toshio Abe in command, was {{marred by}} what some {{considered}} an ill-omened accident. During the floating-out procedure, one of the <b>caissons</b> {{at the end of}} the dock unexpectedly lifted as the water rose to the level of the harbor (no one had checked to ensure that all the <b>caissons</b> were properly ballasted with seawater). The sudden inrush of water into the graving dock pushed the carrier into the forward end, damaging the bow structure below the waterline and requiring repairs in drydock. These were completed by 26 October.|$|E
50|$|The {{four main}} types of <b>caisson</b> are box <b>caisson,</b> open <b>caisson,</b> compressed-air <b>caisson</b> and {{monolith}} <b>caisson.</b>|$|R
40|$|The Space System <b>caisson</b> (SS <b>caisson)</b> {{foundation}} is the open <b>caisson</b> method. This method reduces frictional force of <b>caisson</b> wall surface using the gravel. In this paper, frictional force of <b>caisson</b> wall surface {{was measured in}} the field. Construction case of open <b>caisson</b> method and SS <b>caisson</b> {{foundation is}} compared. And, the case as {{the shape of the}} SS <b>caisson</b> foundation differs from the construction region is shown.

40|$|Space System <b>caisson</b> (SS <b>caisson),</b> {{which is}} the {{operation}} method of constructing <b>caisson</b> foundation, is one of open <b>caisson</b> foundations. The skin friction is reduced by filling space between <b>caisson</b> wall and soil with boulder. Therefore, SS <b>caisson</b> can be sinking by own weight. The skin friction of SS <b>caisson</b> is smaller, but it cannot be quantitatively estimated. So, model tests were carried out to know the tendency of skin friction. In this time, DEM (Distinct Element Method) 　analysis was performed to examine legitimacy these experiments...|$|R
5|$|Later, when {{technological}} advances allowed {{the use of}} pressurization of mines and <b>caissons</b> to exclude water ingress, miners were observed to present symptoms of what would become known as caisson disease, compressed air illness, the bends, and decompression sickness.|$|E
5|$|Without the docking-pit, the <b>caissons</b> and {{extremities}} of {{the arms}} of the wheel would be immersed in water at the lower canal basin each time the wheel rotated. The buoyancy of the lower caisson would {{make it more difficult to}} turn the wheel.|$|E
5|$|By {{the late}} 19th century, as salvage {{operations}} became deeper and longer, an unexplained malady began afflicting the divers; they would suffer breathing difficulties, dizziness, joint pain and paralysis, sometimes leading to death. The problem was already well known among workers building tunnels and bridge footings operating under pressure in <b>caissons</b> and was initially called caisson disease; {{it was later}} renamed the bends because the joint pain typically caused the sufferer to stoop. Early reports of the disease had been made {{at the time of}} Charles Pasley's salvage operation, but scientists were still ignorant of its causes.|$|E
40|$|The SS <b>caisson</b> (SPACE SYSTEM <b>CAISSON)</b> method {{fills the}} space (gap) between <b>caisson</b> {{circumference}} surface and rock {{with the space}} gravel {{and it is the}} open <b>caisson</b> method which gently installs the <b>caisson</b> only by the dead weight at the good accuracy by reducing skin friction resistance which depends on <b>caisson</b> circumference surface, while the stability of country rock is attempted. 　The result of numerical value using DEM and model experiment of SS <b>caisson</b> model with exhaust slot was mainly compared in the previous report. In this report, SS <b>caisson</b> model with exhaust slot and SS <b>caisson</b> model without exhaust slot were analyzed numerically using analysis method equal to the previous report. In this report, the result of comparing experimental value with numerical value is reported...|$|R

50|$|The word <b>caisson</b> is {{also used}} as a synonym for the moving trough part of <b>caisson</b> locks, canal lifts and {{inclines}} in which boats and ships rest whilst being lifted from one canal elevation to another; the water is retained {{on the inside of}} the <b>caisson,</b> or excluded from the <b>caisson,</b> according to the respective operating principle.|$|R
5|$|HNTB, of Kansas City, Missouri, was the {{designer}} and consulting engineer {{for both the}} new bridge {{as well as the}} original Benjamin G. Humphreys Bridge. The federal government provided $110 million to begin building {{the main part of the}} bridge consisting long spans supported by cables. The main superstructure construction began in December 2001. Massman Construction Company in a joint venture with Traylor Brothers, Inc. received the contract to construct two large piers in the river; these were built using both floating <b>caissons</b> and open caisson construction. The construction on the last main span section of the bridge was finished in April 2006.|$|E
5|$|Just {{two and a}} {{half months}} later, though, the MTA stated that it was unable to open the subway {{extension}} for service until April to July 2015, due to the failure to get the inclined elevators to work properly. Problems with the security and fire alarm systems were also blamed for the delays. A December 2014 New York Post article attributed the delay to Hudson Yards' developer, The Related Companies', need to dig <b>caissons</b> for the foundations, just above the subway station, and the foundation work needed to be complete before the MTA could open the station. Continuing trouble with the fire and security alarms in March 2015 would delay the opening until summer.|$|E
5|$|Taller, heavier {{buildings}} such as skyscrapers {{also required}} stronger foundations than smaller buildings. Earlier buildings had typically rested their foundations on rubble, {{which was in}} turn laid down on the soft top layer of the ground called the overburden. As buildings became taller and heavier, the overburden could not support their weight, and foundations increasingly needed to rest directly on the bedrock below. In both New York and Chicago this required digging down a considerable distance through soft soil and often below the water table, risking the hole filling up with water before the foundations were complete. The deeper the foundations needed to be, the greater the challenge. Special water-tight boxes called <b>caissons</b> were invented {{to deal with this}} problem in England in 1830 and adopted in the U.S. during the 1850s and 1860s.|$|E
5000|$|The north-west <b>caisson</b> was towed {{into place}} in December 1884, but an {{exceptionally}} low tide on New Year's Day 1885 caused the <b>caisson</b> {{to sink into}} the mud of the river bed and adopt a slight tilt. When the tide rose, it flooded over the lower edge, filling the <b>caisson</b> with water, and when the tide fell but the water did not drain from the <b>caisson,</b> its top-heaviness caused to tilt further. Plates were bolted on by divers to raise {{the edge of the}} <b>caisson</b> above water level, and the <b>caisson</b> was reinforced with wooden struts as water was pumped out, but pumping took place too quickly and the water pressure tore a hole between 25 and 30 ft long. It was decided to construct a [...] "barrel" [...] of large timbers inside the <b>caisson</b> to reinforce it, and it was ten months before the <b>caisson</b> could be pumped out and dug free. The <b>caisson</b> was refloated on 19 October 1885, and then moved into position and sunk with suitable modifications.|$|R
5000|$|Construction of {{the first}} <b>caisson</b> started in 1947 after the [...] "wet season". As each <b>caisson</b> rose in height, sand {{was removed from the}} centre of the <b>caisson</b> to make it sink into the sand bed. To get such a {{tremendous}} mass to sink gradually and evenly was difficult. To add to the difficulties, often a <b>caisson</b> became stuck and a diver had to be sent down to find the problem and remedy it. Another difficulty was that each <b>caisson</b> had to be sunk to a secure depth before the [...] "wet season". If a <b>caisson</b> was not firmly anchored deep enough, a flood could have swept it away.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe finite {{difference}} {{method and}} the volume of fluid (VOF) method were used to develop a three-dimensional numerical model to study wave interaction with a perforated <b>caisson.</b> The partial cell method was adopted to solve this type of problem for the first time. The validity of the present model, with and without the presence of <b>caisson</b> structures, was examined by comparing the model results with experimental data. Then, the numerical model was used to investigate the effects of various wave and structure parameters on the wave force and wave runup of the perforated quasi-ellipse <b>caisson.</b> Compared with the solid quasi-ellipse <b>caisson,</b> the wave force on the perforated quasi-ellipse <b>caisson</b> is significantly reduced with increasing porosity of the perforated quasi-ellipse <b>caisson.</b> Furthermore, the perforated quasi-ellipse <b>caisson</b> can also reduce the wave runup, and it tends to decrease {{with the increase of}} the porosity of the perforated quasi-ellipse <b>caisson</b> and the relative wave height...|$|R
5|$|The cavalry charge gave Ney {{enough time}} to place Desperrières' brigade in line of battle to meet the first shock. Ney's {{division}} included 8,200 infantry, 1,100 cavalry, and 14 cannons, {{but one of his}} three brigades was detached to the south at Wasserburg am Inn. Desperrières conducted an able defense, counterattacking when the 13th Dragoons rode to his support. Meanwhile, Ney directed the fighting on a second brigade front. At noon, a horse artillery battery led by Jean Baptiste Eblé arrived and its accurate fire quickly dismounted four Austrian guns and destroyed three <b>caissons.</b> Later, two pieces were overrun by Austrian hussars, but the French gunners rallied and recaptured the pieces in a horseback charge.|$|E
5|$|The first {{recorded}} experimental work related to decompression {{was conducted by}} Robert Boyle, who subjected experimental animals to reduced ambient pressure by use of a primitive vacuum pump. In the earliest experiments the subjects died from asphyxiation, but in later experiments, signs of what was later to become known as decompression sickness were observed. Later, when technological advances allowed the use of pressurisation of mines and <b>caissons</b> to exclude water ingress, miners were observed to present symptoms of what would become known as caisson disease, the bends, and decompression sickness. Once it was recognized that the symptoms were caused by gas bubbles, and that recompression could relieve the symptoms, further work showed {{that it was possible}} to avoid symptoms by slow decompression, and subsequently various theoretical models have been derived to predict low-risk decompression profiles and treatment of decompression sickness.|$|E
5|$|During the Second World War {{the running}} of Gibb and Partners fell largely to Paton and James Guthrie Brown. Gibb and Partners gained {{a large number of}} {{government}} contracts and within a few weeks of {{the start of the war}} in September 1939 the workforce increased by 2000. Paton designed and sited several Royal Ordnance Factories; and in March 1940 travelled to Turkey to construct an iron and steel works there. Whilst in Turkey he was contracted to build emplacements to contain guns from mothballed battleships in the Dardanelles. The construction of the emplacements was completed but the guns would later be prevented from reaching the site by the Axis occupation of Greece. Paton made his way back to Britain via Greece, Italy and France and arrived home two days prior to the Italian declaration of war against the Allies on 10 June 1940. He also constructed a plant at Barry in South Wales for the extraction of Magnesium Hydroxide from the sea, a turbine factory for British Thomson-Houston Company and a £7 million underground aircraft engine factory. From 1943-44 Paton supervised the construction, in London Docks, of the precast concrete <b>caissons</b> required for the construction of Mulberry Harbours following the Normandy Landings. From 1944-45 he was in charge of the rebuilding of houses damaged by V-2 rockets in the London districts of Wanstead and Woodford.|$|E

50|$|Pier 2 {{supporting}} the main bridge spans {{is founded on}} a concrete <b>caisson.</b> The cutting foot of the <b>caisson</b> was cast on a barge in sheltered water and then floated out and sunk to the river bed within its own cofferdam. Jetting with compressed air {{and the addition of}} further sections of <b>caisson</b> then further sank the <b>caisson.</b> At one point the <b>caisson</b> accidentally slid under its own weight to below the water line. To recover this situation a further section had to be added by divers and the <b>caisson</b> pumped out, which is reputed to have taken a total of 9 months to recover. The final <b>caisson</b> extends 241 ft below low water level, just 8 in short of the world record depth for a bridge foundation at that time, held by the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge.|$|R
25|$|The bridge's {{two towers}} were built by {{floating}} two <b>caissons,</b> giant upside-down boxes made of southern yellow pine, {{in the span}} of the East River, and then beginning to build the stone towers on top of them until they sank {{to the bottom of the}} river. Compressed air was pumped into the <b>caissons,</b> and workers entered the space to dig the sediment, until the <b>caissons</b> sank to the bedrock. The whole weight of the bridge still sits upon a 15-foot thickness of southern yellow pine wood under the sediment.|$|E
25|$|The Austrians {{reported}} {{losses of}} 798 killed, 3,687 wounded, and 7,195 prisoners, with 50 cannons and 85 artillery <b>caissons</b> captured. Bavarian casualties numbered only 24 killed and 90 wounded, but their losses also included 1,754 prisoners, 26 artillery pieces, and 36 <b>caissons.</b> In round numbers, {{this amounts to}} 4,600 killed and wounded, plus 8,950 soldiers and 76 guns captured. The French admitted casualties of 1,839 soldiers, one cannon, and two <b>caissons.</b> Since several units failed to turn in reports, Moreau's army probably lost at least 3,000 men. Bastoul was mortally wounded.|$|E
25|$|The Trustees {{asked their}} Chief Engineer, Edward Leader Williams, {{to draw up}} plans for a boat lift. He settled on a design {{involving}} a pair of water-filled <b>caissons</b> that would counterbalance one another and require relatively little power to lift boats up and down. A similar boat lift on the Grand Western Canal, completed in 1835, used chains to connect the <b>caissons</b> via an overhead balance wheel. It had a solid masonry superstructure to support {{the weight of the}} loaded <b>caissons.</b> Leader Williams realised that if he used water-filled hydraulic rams to support the <b>caissons</b> their weight would be borne by the rams and their cylinders, buried underground and a much lighter superstructure could be used. He may have been inspired by inspecting a hydraulic ship lift and graving dock at the Royal Victoria Dock in London, designed by experienced hydraulic engineer Edwin Clark.|$|E
50|$|No {{external}} power is needed: the lift lock functions by gravity alone using the counterweight principle. One <b>caisson</b> always ascends {{and the other}} always descends during each locking cycle. When one <b>caisson</b> reaches the top position, it stops 12 in below the water level of the upper reach, and the control valve is closed; Siemens ultrasonic sensors are used to help determine the differential. The upper reach and top <b>caisson</b> gates open, and water flows into the top <b>caisson</b> until the level equalizes. The weight of the extra foot of water is 144 ST, making the total weight of the upper <b>caisson</b> 1844 ST. Any vessels that just ascended in the top <b>caisson</b> exit into the upper reach, and any new vessels making a transit of the lock then enter the bottom or top <b>caisson</b> from the lower or upper reach respectively. Once the vessels are secured, all gates are closed and the crossover valve in the connecting pipe between the ram shafts is opened. Since the upper <b>caisson</b> weighs more than the lower <b>caisson</b> (1,844 vs 1,700 tons), it pushes down on its ram, forcing out water from its shaft via the connecting pipe into the shaft of the bottom <b>caisson.</b> The force pushes up on the bottom caisson's ram, raising the <b>caisson</b> {{up to the top}} position. When the gate of the newly descended top <b>caisson</b> and lower reach gates open at the bottom, the extra foot of water flows out and equalizes with the water level in the lower reach of the canal, and any descended vessels exit, allowing the cycle to start over again.|$|R
50|$|A suction <b>caisson</b> can {{effectively}} {{be described as}} an upturned bucket that {{is embedded in the}} marine sediment. This embedment is either achieved through pushing or by creating a negative pressure inside the <b>caisson</b> skirt; both of these techniques have the effect of securing the <b>caisson</b> into the sea bed. The foundation can also be rapidly removed by reversing the installation process, applying an over air pressure inside the <b>caisson</b> skirt.|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{the results of}} a {{numerical}} study on the behaviour of <b>caisson</b> foundations subjected to various combinations of loading are presented. A typical <b>caisson</b> has been used in this study with a length-to-diameter ratio of 2. The <b>caisson</b> is assumed to be embedded in a homogeneous soil deforming under undrained conditions. The performance of the <b>caisson</b> under separate axial, lateral and torsional forces was investigated first, followed by the interaction of these forces with each other. The ultimate capacity of the <b>caisson</b> under combined loading is presented in the form of failure envelope in the axial-torsional loading plane and axial-lateral, and lateral-torsional loading surfaces along the skirt of the foundation. It is shown that, although lateral capacity of the <b>caisson</b> is dependent on the location of the padeye, a unique normalised failure surface can be used to represent the capacity of the <b>caisson</b> under all combinations of axial, lateral and torsional loads regardless of the location of the padeye.

25|$|The Plane was {{designed}} by Gordon Cale Thomas, after a large-scale prototype was built at the company's Bulbourne yard and he had assessed the 75ft climb. It had two tanks, or <b>caissons,</b> each capable of holding two narrowboats or a barge. The <b>caissons</b> were full of water, and so balanced each other. The caissons' vertical guillotine gates created a watertight seal. The lift was powered by a 25-horsepower (19kW) stationary steam engine. The land for the Plane was purchased for £1,595 and total expenses for the project came to £39,244 by 24 June 1900.|$|E
25|$|In October 1849 the Committee of Management of the Forth and Clyde Canal (which had by {{now taken}} over the Monkland Canal) gave {{instructions}} to James Leslie to proceed, and the work was completed by July 1850. The <b>caissons</b> for the boats were made of malleable iron; they were 70 feet long by 13ft 4in by 2ft 9in high (21.3 by 4.1 by 0.84 metres). The <b>caissons</b> were profiled {{to conform to the}} hull of the boats, so as to contain as little excess water as possible, to a depth of , and were only to convey empty boats.|$|E
25|$|After {{conversion}} to electrical operation the boat lift was operated successfully for 75 years. Regular maintenance was still necessary; for example, the wire ropes supporting the <b>caissons</b> suffered from fatigue from the repeated {{bending and straightening}} as they ran over the overhead pulleys {{and had to be}} replaced frequently. However, maintenance was simpler than before the conversion because the mechanism of the electrical lift was above ground. Maintenance was also less expensive because the <b>caissons</b> were now designed to be run independently, allowing most maintenance to be carried out while one caisson remained operational and thus avoiding the need to close the lift entirely.|$|E
40|$|Suction <b>caisson</b> {{foundations}} {{have been}} very popular in {{oil and gas industry}} and the current trend is to extend their use to offshore wind farms. A suction <b>caisson</b> is an upturned ‘bucket’ of cylindrical shape made from steel. Seepage conditions play a pivotal role in suction <b>caisson</b> installation process in sand. Pressure gradients generated by the imposed suction inside the <b>caisson</b> cavity cause an overall reduction in the soil resistance around the <b>caisson</b> wall and tip. This transient soil loosening around the <b>caisson</b> wall helps <b>caisson</b> penetration into the seabed. However, these effects must be controlled to avoid soil failure due to critical conditions such as piping or loss of soil shear strength. In this paper, we endeavour to study the role of seepage on the suction <b>caisson</b> installation process in sand. We investigate the effect of seepage conditions on soil resistance to <b>caisson</b> penetration with a particular focus on how frictional and tip resistance are differently affected. For this purpose a series of finite difference simulations of suction <b>caisson</b> installation process are performed using FLAC 3 D models. The required suction is predicted using an explicit strategy which consists of updating current suction based on displacement history available after the previous prescribed displacement increment. The results of FLAC 3 D models show that this approach provides an insight on how soil resistance evolves under suction during the installation process and confirm the effect of seepage on total reduction of shear resistance around the <b>caisson</b> wall during installation in sand...|$|R
