50|$|The <b>Child</b> <b>Murderess</b> (German: Die Kindermörderin) is a play in six acts by German author Heinrich Leopold Wagner and {{an example}} of a Bürgerliches Trauerspiel (bourgeois tragedy). It takes place in Wagner's {{hometown}} Strasbourg and concerns a young girl who kills her child which had been conceived in a rape.|$|E
5000|$|According to {{the actress}} Nathansen, {{only a few}} days after filming, Henrettelsen premiered with great success at the Panotikonhallen in Copenhagen. It is {{possible}} that it had another title, Barnemordersken (<b>Child</b> <b>Murderess),</b> but it is listed in Elfelt's protocol of negatives as Henrettelsen. When Elfelt was asked in 1926 if he had ever filmed a drama, he remembered being reluctant about this film.|$|E
50|$|The Allisons {{were major}} {{characters}} in the 1996 miniseries Titanic. The subplot regarding them was highly fictionalized and filled with historical inaccuracies: for example, it added {{the story of the}} long-standing myth that Alice (portrayed by Felicity Waterman) was a <b>child</b> <b>murderess</b> who stole Trevor in a fit of panic, thus forcing {{the rest of the family}} to remain on the ship looking for him until it was too late. Their other servants (Sarah, Mildred, and George) were not featured in it - the only one travelling with them was Alice.|$|E
40|$|Infanticide {{emerged as}} a major topic of public concern in Germany during the Storm and Stress period. Goethe and Schiller took up this issue and altered its social and {{historical}} reality by focusing solely on the bourgeois mother as perpetrator of infanticide. By concentrating on {{the figure of the}} bourgeois woman seduced by a nobleman and by criminalizing her actions and condemning her to death, many authors denounced interclass relationships and asserted traditional, rigid class divisions. In my dissertation, I show how competing discourses sought to demonize or even convict the mother while perpetuating patriarchal and social systems of power in order to regulate behavior. My project confronts the issues of power, gender, and class as underlying components of the construct of the <b>child</b> <b>murderess</b> in German literature and culture. My work contributes new and critical insights as I analyze texts outside the traditional literary canon by Therese Huber, Benedikte Naubert, Marianne Ehrmann, Friedrich Maler-Müller and August Gottlieb Meißner and bring them into dialogue with conservative contemporaries. By describing the social misery and depicting the severity of the laws to which these women were subjected, the works demonstrate that infanticide impacted the discussion of the death penalty and provided a more complex and nuanced view of the woman as <b>child</b> <b>murderess</b> in her social, political, and legal contexts. Drawing on the poststructuralist theories of the philosopher and critic Michel Foucault, my dissertation demonstrates that these female criminals were not transgressing some “natural” condition, as the works of Goethe and Schiller insinuated; rather, these women were made into criminals by competing social and political agendas. Thus, my research focuses on how power structures stigmatized women who acted on their sexual desires, thereby violating social morals, as outcasts and deviants. My study of literary works reveals that authors commonly depicted their fictional female murderers as driven to crime by forces beyond their control, such as factors of class, financial standing, and psychological impairment. My work provides a more refined and holistic understanding of the competing interests throughout history and in literature, which sought to construct and define the <b>child</b> <b>murderess...</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis is to analyse how judicial texts concerning guilty and innocent mothers were constructed {{during the period of}} c. 1680 - 1800. The two crimes of infanticide and overlaying have been examined. Source materials have primarily consisted of proceedings from the appeals court, courts of first instance, and parish meetings. The aim has been to survey the judicial discourse, that is to say the background ways of reasoning,values and moral outlook, which, alongside the law, governed the construction of portrayals regarding guilt and innocence. Sweden in the early-modern period can be characterised as a religious culture. Religion was interwoven with, and had fundamental significance for societal morality, norms, values and legislation. The institution of marriage had been bestowed with increased status following the Reformation and represented the foundation of societal order. Morality was rigorously controlled during the era of Lutheran orthodoxy and sexual offences severely punished. In my analysis of constructions of guilt and innocence, two contradictory images emerge - one an ideal, corresponding to the female optimum, or norm of the good, Christian motherhood, and the other its antithesis. The ideal character corresponded to the innocent infant overlayer; her antithesis to the beyond-all-doubt guilty <b>child</b> <b>murderess.</b> It should be added that in practice these images often were more composite and complex. During the 1700 s the spheres of maternity care (obstetrics), child care (paediatrics) and, not least, post-mortem examinations were professionalized. The science of forensic medicine developed and gained influence in the judicial discourse, primarily in connection with infanticide. Alongside this transformation a masculinisation took place. Science was a male field, and those women who had earlier been responsible for child-birth assistance and examining the dead became marginalized. The gender aspect is very clear in this study. Society was patriarchal and women held a subordinate, inequitable position. Laws concerning infanticide and overlaying affected female criminals exclusively. Legislation, investigation and the administration of justice surrounding these crimes were a male sphere, while the accused were, in principle, women alone. I have ascertained that the value of a child, and that of life itself, which was based upon Christian ethics and morality, was fairly constant during a very long period of time. During {{the latter part of the}} 1700 s, however, a change took place in the judicial discourse, whereby the child's value was expressed with more clarity. I interpret this as a consequence of utilitarian thinking and mercantilistic population politics, in co-operation with medico-scientific developments. The judicial rhetoric relating to infanticide was directed by a discourse characterised by the demand for publicization of pregnancy, as well as birth and death, good Christian motherhood, and the principle that children should be conceived within the marriage structure...|$|E
