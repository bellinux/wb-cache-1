50|$|Since the {{establishment}} of the War on Drugs, the United States and European countries have provided financial, logistical, tactical and military aid to the government of Colombia in order to implement plans to combat the illegal drug trade. The most notable of these programs has been the Plan Colombia which also intended to combat leftist organizations, such as the FARC guerrillas, who have controlled many <b>coca-growing</b> regions in Colombia over the past decades.|$|E
50|$|With {{the fall}} of the two main drug {{trafficking}} cartels of Medellín and Cali in the 1990s, some of organizations that inherited their drug routes were members of the newly formed Norte del Valle Cartel. The FARC and ELN guerrillas came to control the <b>coca-growing</b> regions in the Colombian Amazon and to tax the income from the sale of coca-paste. The right-wing para-military groups initially grew out of the private armies of cocaine cartels.|$|E
50|$|In contrast, the Cali Cartel {{adopted a}} much more subtle and non-confrontation attitude. Many of its bosses were from already wealthy and {{influential}} families, and they tended to invest their earnings from the cocaine trade in legitimate businesses.

50|$|To counter this development, the U.S. government, {{through its}} foreign aid agency USAID, has {{promoted}} {{a policy of}} crop substitution, whereby coca cultivation is replaced by coffee, banana, pineapple, palm heart, and other crops suitable for a tropical climate.

50|$|The Bolivian {{government}} has since 2004 implemented {{a policy of}} voluntary participation of farmers from all <b>coca-growing</b> regions in Bolivia. For instance, farmers in Chapare are allowed to grow one cato of coca per year. Any coca grown beyond that limit, or any cultivation outside of approved coca-cultivation regions such as Chapare, is subject to elimination. The strategy relies on coca growers federations’ ability to enforce the agreement. Such federations are influential, and penalties for violations by farmers or lax enforcement by federations can be stern (including seizure of lands). As a result, coca cultivation in Bolivia fell to 27,200 hectares in 2011 from 31,000 hectares in 2010 - a 12 per cent decrease.|$|E
5000|$|The {{government}} of Bolivia has also taken similar steps {{to ban the}} DEA from operating in the country. In September 2008, Bolivia drastically reduced diplomatic ties with the United States, withdrawing its ambassador from the US and expelling the US ambassador from Bolivia.

The Bolivian government claimed {{that it could not}} protect the agents, and Morales further accused the agency of helping incite the violence, which claimed 30 lives. National agencies were to take over control of drug management. Three years later, Bolivia and the US began to restore full diplomatic ties.

50|$|Bolivia's {{most lucrative}} crop and {{economic}} {{activity in the}} 1980s was coca, whose leaves are notoriously processed clandestinely into cocaine. The country was the second largest grower of coca in the world, supplying approximately 15 percent of the United States cocaine market in the late 1980s. Analysts believed that exports of coca paste or cocaine generated from US$600 million to US$1 billion annually in the 1980s, depending on prices and output. Based on these estimates, coca-related exports equaled or surpassed the country's legal exports. Coca has been grown in Bolivia for centuries.

50|$|President Morales has {{continued}} to maintain relations with the US government, including on counter-narcotics issues.

Its strategy is based on the voluntary participation of farmers from all <b>coca-growing</b> regions in the country. For instance, farmers in Chapare are allowed to grow one cato (1,600 square meters) of coca per year, as part of policy formally introduced in Bolivia in 2004. Any coca grown beyond that limit, or any cultivation outside of approved coca-cultivation regions such as Chapare, is subject to elimination.

5000|$|Coca {{eradication}} is {{a controversial}} strategy strongly {{promoted by the}} United States government starting in 1961 {{as part of its}} [...] "War on Drugs" [...] to eliminate the cultivation of coca, a plant whose leaves are not only traditionally used by indigenous cultures but also, in modern society, in the manufacture of cocaine. The strategy was adopted in place of running educational campaigns against drug usage. The prohibitionist strategy is being pursued in the <b>coca-growing</b> regions of Colombia (Plan Colombia), Peru, and formerly Bolivia, where it is highly controversial because of its environmental, health and socioeconomic impact. Furthermore, indigenous cultures living in the Altiplano, such as the Aymaras, use the coca leaf (which they dub the [...] "millenary leaf") in many of their cultural traditions, notably for its medicinal qualities in alleviating the feeling of hunger, fatigue and headaches symptomatic of altitude sicknesses. The growers of coca are named Cocaleros and part of the coca production for traditional use is legal in Peru, Bolivia and Chile.|$|E
50|$|Along with an {{increase}} in worldwide coca production, the program contributed to a decline in the real standard of living of Chapare peasants leading to protests and violent social unrest (where both demonstrators and police were slain). The Bolivian government's use of the military in <b>coca-growing</b> regions during the unrest brought criticism from NGOs such as Human Rights Watch. Promises of alternative development for farmers stagnated because of worsening external economic conditions. These conditions caused social mobilization among coca farmers like Evo Morales who {{called for an end to}} forced eradication and other measures enacted with the intent of countering narcotics. From 2000 forward, the Bolivian government made several agreements with coca grower federations to end confrontations, but they failed to follow through on their promises causing further opposition to these governments. Morales rose to national attention by leading the political opposition to eradication and this position is a central reason for his election to the Bolivian Congress. His association with anti-eradication forces caused his expulsion from Congress in 2002 which led to his Presidential campaign with its surprising showing that same year.|$|E

The trace to her arrest was established after the 1995 Bucharest capture of Yukiko Ekita with a false Peruvian passport.

50|$|The scandal {{behind the}} aerial {{eradication}} strategy in Colombia raises many issues. One {{point is the}} most important of whether or not it has been successful. In 2004, according to Robert Charles, {{assistant secretary of state for}} the INL, aerial eradication efforts were getting close to the point that continued suppression of the drug crops would convince growers that continued cultivation will be futile. However, statistics show that sharp reductions in growing caused by fumigation in 2002-2003 did not reduce cultivation levels back to their numbers in 1998, and on top of that, Colombia still remains the largest <b>coca-growing</b> country in the world. Another reason to remain skeptical of the success of this program is the “balloon effect”. This means that when aerial eradication halted drug cultivation in one area, it would simply appear in another area, which would in turn reverse the intended effects of fumigation. As a result, coca farming has spread throughout Colombia, and the Colombian government even reported that between 1999 and 2002, the number of provinces where coca was being grown rose from twelve to twenty-two. The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) also presented research on coca cultivation in Colombia which showed this crop’s high degree of mobility and its increases of cultivation in ten provinces. For example, in the province Guaviare, coca cultivation moved south toward Caquetá and Putumayo as a result of aerial eradication in the 1990s, and thus cultivation rose 55 percent.|$|E
40|$|Traditional coca uses {{have taken}} place in Peru and Bolivia from three {{thousand}} years. International organizations have urged the implementation of “zero-coca” growing policies in those countries, although without tangible results. Supply-side harm reduction strategies are currently being implemented in Bolivia, which rely on social control to limit, although not totally abolish coca growing. In this article, the different motivations for traditional coca growing are extensively reviewed, and the data from a survey conducted with 496 farmers in an indigenous community is examined, in order to provide a comprehensive overview of the <b>coca-growing</b> problem and to evaluate if social control could potentially influence the scale of coca growing in Peru. The results suggest that social control variables, such as attachment, involvement, and beliefs, seem to limit <b>coca-growing</b> areas. Those factors have been largely overlooked and may offer an opportunity to reduce coca areas if explicitly considered in anti-drug policy design...|$|E

The experiences in Bolivia and Peru indicate that effective alternative development demands a strong host government commitment to a comprehensive array of counternarcotics measures and years of sustained U.

40|$|This essay {{presents}} {{the prospects of}} the alternative crops to the coca leaf, promoted by the `Programa de Desarrollo Alternativo´ (PDA), that {{has been carried out}} since 1996 in the <b>coca-growing</b> valleys, and that currently faces a difficult situation. Although during the 199599 period an important increase in the prices and production of coffee and cacao was observed, this situation has reverted ever since, and a large increase of the price of the coca leaf, as well as a significant decrease of the prices of coffee and cacao, have been observed. As a consequence, the small producers of the <b>coca-growing</b> valleys are abandoning so-called legal crops, among them coffee and cacao, and strongly retaking the production of the coca leaf. In the current situation, characterized by the lack of funding to develop alternative crops to the coca leaf, the possibility that growers agree to finance alternative crops with the profits obtained from the production of he coca leaf should be considered, and, on the other hand, the government and the international cooperation would agree to provide training, technical assistance, as well as to build up communications and other infrastructure. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{peace treaty}} of Colombia {{has promised to}} end over fifty years of armed conflict, which has been {{significantly}} financed by the cultivation and processing of illicit crops. The treaty contemplates a substitution policy that offers financial incentives and social investment to the <b>coca-growing</b> communities to replace their illicit crops by legal alternatives. This study examines the substitution policy tradeoffs in the Putumayo-Caquetá and the Catatumbo regions, by applying Life Cycle Assessment framework coupled with socioeconomic indicators, to four scenarios. Implications of coca cultivation and its derivatives (Business-as-Usual scenario) were evaluated and contrasted with the successful implementation of the policy (Policy Success scenario), a partial substitution of the illegal crops (Conservative scenario) and the geographical displacement of coca cultivation (Balloon Effect scenario). Compared to the Business-as-Usual scenario, Policy Success, and Conservative scenarios mitigate photochemical oxidation, ozone layer and abiotic resources depletion environmental impacts in both regions. In contrast, acidification and eutrophication in the Catatumbo region and toxicity impacts in the Putumayo-Caquetá region worsen. For both regions, Balloon Effect scenario increases the environmental burden in almost all the categories evaluated. The socioeconomic analysis reveals that for the Catatumbo region farmers, successful implementation of the policy implies a reduction on their income. For <b>coca-growing</b> farmers of Putumayo-Caquetá region, Policy Success scenario has {{a positive impact on}} the income and job generation, while Conservative and Balloon Effect reduce the profit. In general, it was observed that the dynamics of the illegal chain varies from region to region, influencing the environmental and socioeconomic outcome of the substitution policy.

40|$|This thesis {{discusses}} the post-Middle Horizon archaeology {{of one of}} the smaller central coast valleys of Peru. It focuses on a zone between 400 and 1000 metres above sea level and analyses data collected over several field seasons. There are two appendices dealing with ceramic analysi 8 and excavations. An introduction defines the problems raised by previous work and discusses field procedures. There is a full treatment of the environment in order to show the potential self-sufficiency of the zone and its importance as a <b>coca-growing</b> area. Over 100 sites are described and dated to one or more periods, from the Early Horizon to the Colonial Period, {{on the basis of the}} pottery found in surface collections and excavations. Reasons are given for the shift in 8 ettlement location between early and late periods. There follows a treatment of the late architecture, which is divided into three types:- domestic, ritual and community. It is shown that the population lived scattered along the hill slopes or behind the ritual structures located on the alluvial fans of lateral quebradas. The purpose of these ritual structures was to house rites connected with the well-being of ancestor-worshipping groups and as a repository for their dead. Ethnohistorical sources yield further information on the economic, political and social organisation of the valley inhabitants. They confirm relationships between coastal Yungas and highland Yauyos, that the ceramic analysis suggested. During the Late Horizon the Incas established themselves in the upper part of the study area in order to control communications and to enjoy access to coca. The most important changes they made were to build a major road linking the coastal and highland centres of Pachacamac and Jauja and to establish a tambo, whose location is identified in this study. Villages close to the tambo underwent particular Inca influence because they provided the bulk of labour for building and servicing it...|$|E
40|$|Drawing on ethnographic {{fieldwork}} {{undertaken in}} Bolivia’s <b>coca-growing</b> Yungas region, this thesis {{is concerned with}} how, on the most practical level, development projects might hold more relevance {{to the lives of}} their target groups than they have hitherto tended to do, as well as how the power imbalances that characterise the relationships between development organisations and local people may be understood and addressed. Beginning with the concept of ‘communicative ecology’ (Tacchi et al 2003) as a framework for exploring the multifariousness of communicative avenues and the interconnectedness of these within a system, I focus my analysis on the ecosystem of coca communications. I argue, however, that the concept of communicative ecology on its own has little meaning without adopting a political economy approach, which incorporates the work of attempting to understand the social and power relations that surround the production, distribution and consumption of resources, both material and cultural. As a way of analysing the strategies and potentials of people within the ecosystem of coca communications, I utilise Bourdieu’s (1990) notions of field, habitus and forms of capital, where the coca field characterises itself by virtue of the fact that all those who are a part of it are linked in some way through the production, exchange and consumption of both the coca leaf, and the values, meanings and discourses that surround it. It is concluded that the ecosystem of coca communications is linked intrinsically to the coca production system, in that individuals and groups have differential access to, inclination to use, and success in influencing the discourse via different communicative media, depending on their situation within the coca field. This refers to land ownership, labour, organisational participation, exchange and consumptive practices, which is translated into a system of capital accumulation and exchange. The thesis argues that development organisations will do well to consider a given locality in these terms in order to facilitate the implementation of ICT projects that are relevant and compatible with local social and communicational systems, and further, that these organisations must reflect upon their own role as ‘introduced organisms’ within local communicative ecologies.
