40|$|Expression of the alkane {{degradation}} pathway {{encoded in}} the OCT plasmid of Pseudomonas putida GPo 1 is induced {{in the presence}} of alkanes by the AlkS regulator, and it is down-regulated by <b>catabolic</b> <b>repression.</b> The <b>catabolic</b> <b>repression</b> effect reduces the expression of the two AlkS-activated promoters of the pathway, named PalkB and PalkS 2. The P. putida Crc protein participates in <b>catabolic</b> <b>repression</b> of some metabolic pathways for sugars and nitrogenated compounds. Here, we show that Crc has {{an important role in the}} <b>catabolic</b> <b>repression</b> exerted on the P. putida GPo 1 alkane degradation pathway when cells grow exponentially in a rich medium. Interestingly, Crc plays little or no role on the <b>catabolic</b> <b>repression</b> exerted by some organic acids in a defined medium, which shows that these two types of <b>catabolic</b> <b>repression</b> can be genetically distinguished. Disruption of the crc gene led to a six- to sevenfold increase in the levels of the mRNAs arising from the AlkS-activated PalkB and PalkS 2 promoters in cells growing exponentially in rich medium. This was not due to an increase in the half-lives of these mRNAs. Since AlkS activates the expression of its own gene and seems to be present in limiting amounts, the higher mRNA levels observed in the absence of Crc could arise from an increase in either transcription initiation or in the translation efficiency of the alkS mRNA. Both alternatives would lead to increased AlkS levels and hence to elevated expression of PalkB and PalkS 2. High expression of alkS from a heterologous promoter eliminated <b>catabolic</b> <b>repression.</b> Our results indicate that <b>catabolic</b> <b>repression</b> in rich medium is directed to down-regulate the levels of the AlkS activator. Crc would thus modulate, directly or indirectly, the levels of AlkS...|$|E
40|$|Expression of the alkane {{degradation}} pathway encoded by the OCT plasmid of Pseudomonas putida GPo 1 {{is regulated}} by two control systems. One {{relies on the}} transcriptional regulator AlkS, which activates expression of the pathway {{in the presence of}} alkanes. The other, which is a dominant global regulation control, represses the expression of the pathway genes when a preferred carbon source is present in the growth medium in addition to alkanes. This catabolite repression control occurs through a poorly characterized mechanism that ultimately regulates transcription from the two AlkS-activated promoters of the pathway. To identify the factors involved, a screening method was developed to isolate mutants without this control. Several isolates were obtained, all of which contained mutations that mapped to genes encoding cytochrome o ubiquinol oxidase, the main terminal oxidase of the electron transport chain under highly aerobic conditions. Elimination of this terminal oxidase led to a decrease in the <b>catabolic</b> <b>repression</b> observed both in rich Luria-Bertani medium and in a defined medium containing lactate or succinate as the carbon source. This suggests that <b>catabolic</b> <b>repression</b> could monitor the physiological or metabolic status by using information from the electron transport chain or from the redox state of the cell. Since inactivation of the crc gene also reduces <b>catabolic</b> <b>repression</b> in rich medium (although not that observed in a defined medium), a strain was generated lacking both the Crc function and the cytochrome o terminal oxidase. The two mutations had an additive effect in relieving <b>catabolic</b> <b>repression</b> in rich medium. This suggests that crc and cyo belong to different regulation pathways, both contributing to <b>catabolic</b> <b>repression...</b>|$|E

30|$|Production of inulinase {{has been}} {{extensively}} investigated in K. marxianus (Cruz-Guerrero et al. 1995; Kalil et al. 2001; Singh et al. 2007). The investigation was mainly focused on optimization of its production under various conditions including operating parameters such as pH, temperature, agitation and aeration {{in addition to the}} culture medium, but the results were not sufficient to provide a clear picture of its regulation mechanism. As a consequence, conflicting opinions regarding expression of the enzyme have accumulated. It was demonstrated that inulinase synthesis is under the control of induction by its substrate with <b>catabolic</b> <b>repression</b> in K. fragilis and K. bulgaricus (Grootwassink and Fleming 1980; Grootwassink and Hewitt 1983), of induction without <b>catabolic</b> <b>repression</b> in K. marxianus UCD (FST) 55 - 82 (Parekh and Margaritis 1985) or of induction with <b>catabolic</b> <b>repression</b> in K. marxianus CBS 6556 (Rouwenhorst et al. 1988). On the other hand, other strains in the same species exhibit no induction by a substrate (Cruz-Guerrero et al. 1995; Schwan et al. 1997). Furthermore, Gupta et al. (1994) reported that glucose is responsible for <b>catabolic</b> <b>repression,</b> whereas sucrose and fructose act as weaker inducers than inulin in K. fragilis. However, all of these reports focused on the enzymatic activity of inulinase in the culture medium or cell wall fraction but not on expression at the transcriptional level. KmMIG 1 has been cloned and characterized in K. marxianus SGE 11 (Cassart et al. 1997), revealing that its physiological role {{is similar to that of}} ScMIG 1 in S. cerevisiae; that is, KmMig 1 p represses the expression of KmINU 1 as a counterpart of ScSUC 2 in S. cerevisiae and was shown to be fully functional when expressed in S. cerevisiae.|$|E
40|$|Background: The yeast Xanthophyllomyces dendrorhous {{produces}} carotenoids {{of commercial}} interest, including astaxanthin and beta-carotene. Although carotenogenesis in this yeast and the expression {{profiles of the}} genes controlling this pathway are known, the mechanisms regulating this process remain poorly understood. Several {{studies have demonstrated that}} glucose represses carotenogenesis in X. dendrorhous, suggesting that this pathway could be regulated by <b>catabolic</b> <b>repression.</b> <b>Catabolic</b> <b>repression</b> is a highly conserved regulatory mechanism in eukaryotes and has been widely studied in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Glucose-dependent repression is mainly observed at the transcriptional level and depends on the DNA-binding regulator Mig 1, which recruits the co-repressor complex Cyc 8 -Tup 1, which then represses the expression of target genes. In this work, we studied the regulation of carotenogenesis by <b>catabolic</b> <b>repression</b> in X. dendrorhous, focusing {{on the role of the}} co-repressor complex Cyc 8 -Tup 1. Results: The X. dendrorhous CYC 8 and TUP 1 genes were identified, and their functions were demonstrated by heterologous complementation in S. cerevisiae. In addition, cyc 8 (-) and tup 1 (-) mutant strains of X. dendrorhous were obtained, and both mutations were shown to prevent the glucose-dependent repression of carotenogenesis in X. dendrorhous, increasing the carotenoid production in both mutant strains. Furthermore, the effects of glucose on the transcript levels of genes involved in carotenogenesis differed between the mutant strains and wild-type X. dendrorhous, particularly for genes involved in the synthesis of carotenoid precursors, such as HMGR, idi and FPS. Additionally, transcriptomic analyses showed that cyc 8 (-) and tup 1 (-) mutations affected the expression of over 250 genes in X. dendrorhous. Conclusions: The CYC 8 and TUP 1 genes are functional in X. dendrorhous, and their gene products are involved in <b>catabolic</b> <b>repression</b> and carotenogenesis regulation.

40|$|The red yeast X. dendrorhous {{is one of}} the few natural {{sources of}} astaxanthin, a {{carotenoid}} used in aquaculture for salmonid fish pigmentation and in the cosmetic and pharmaceutical industries for its antioxidant properties. Genetic control of carotenogenesis is well characterized in this yeast; however, little is known about the regulation of the carotenogenesis process. Several lines of evidence have suggested that carotenogenesis is regulated by <b>catabolic</b> <b>repression,</b> and the aim of this work was to identify and functionally characterize the X. dendrorhous MIG 1 gene encoding the catabolic repressor Mig 1, which mediates transcriptional glucose-dependent repression in other yeasts and fungi. The identified gene encodes a protein of 863 amino acids that demonstrates the characteristic conserved features of Mig 1 proteins, and binds in vitro to DNA fragments containing Mig 1 boxes. Gene functionality was demonstrated by heterologous complementation in a S. cerevisiae mig 1 - strain; several aspects of <b>catabolic</b> <b>repression</b> were restored by the X. dendrorhous MIG 1 gene. Additionally, a X. dendrorhous mig 1 - mutant was constructed and demonstrated a higher carotenoid content than the wild-type strain. Most important, the mig 1 - mutation alleviated the glucose-mediated repression of carotenogenesis in X. dendrorhous: the addition of glucose to mig 1 - and wild-type cultures promoted the growth of both strains, but carotenoid synthesis was observed only in the mutant strain. Transcriptomic and RT-qPCR analyses revealed that several genes were differentially expressed between X. dendrorhous mig 1 - and the wild-type strain when cultured with glucose as the sole carbon source. The results obtained in this study demonstrate that <b>catabolic</b> <b>repression</b> in X. dendrorhous is an active process in which the identified MIG 1 gene product plays a central role in the regulation of several biological processes, including carotenogenesis...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Glucose is the {{preferred}} carbon and energy source for Bacillus subtilis and Escherichia coli. A complex regulatory network coordinates gene expression, transport and enzymatic activities, {{in response to the}} presence of this sugar. We present a comparison of the cellular response to glucose in these two model organisms, using an approach combining global transcriptome and regulatory network analyses. Results Transcriptome data from strains grown in Luria-Bertani medium (LB) or LB+glucose (LB+G) were analyzed, in order to identify differentially transcribed genes in B. subtilis. We detected 503 genes in B. subtilis that change their relative transcript levels in the presence of glucose. A similar previous study identified 380 genes in E. coli, which respond to glucose. <b>Catabolic</b> <b>repression</b> was detected in the case of transport and metabolic interconversion activities for both bacteria in LB+G. We detected an increased capacity for de novo synthesis of nucleotides, amino acids and proteins. A comparison between orthologous genes revealed that global regulatory functions such as transcription, translation, replication and genes relating to the central carbon metabolism, presented similar changes in their levels of expression. An analysis of the regulatory network of a subset of genes in both organisms revealed that the set of regulatory proteins responsible for similar physiological responses observed in the transcriptome analysis are not orthologous. An example of this observation is that of transcription factors mediating <b>catabolic</b> <b>repression</b> for most of the genes that displayed reduced transcript levels in the case of both organisms. In terms of topological functional units in both these bacteria, we found interconnected modules that cluster together genes relating to heat shock, respiratory functions, carbon and peroxide metabolism. Interestingly, B. subtilis functions not found in E. coli, such as sporulation and competence were shown to be interconnected, forming modules subject to <b>catabolic</b> <b>repression</b> at the level of transcription. Conclusion Our results demonstrate that the response to glucose is partially conserved in model organisms E. coli and B. subtilis, including genes encoding basic functions such as transcription, translation, replication and genes involved in the central carbon metabolism. </p...|$|E

40|$|The Crc {{protein is}} {{involved}} in the repression of several catabolic pathways for the assimilation of some sugars, nitrogenated compounds, and hydrocarbons in Pseudomonas putida and Pseudomonas aeruginosa when other preferred carbon sources are present in the culture medium (<b>catabolic</b> <b>repression).</b> Crc appears to be a component of a signal transduction pathway modulating carbon metabolism in pseudomonads, although its mode of action is unknown. To better understand the role of Crc, the proteome profile of two otherwise isogenic P. putida strains containing either a wild-type or an inactivated crc allele was compared. The results showed that Crc {{is involved in}} the <b>catabolic</b> <b>repression</b> of the hpd and hmgA genes from the homogentisate pathway, one of the central catabolic pathways for aromatic compounds that is used to assimilate intermediates derived from the oxidation of phenylalanine, tyrosine, and several aromatic hydrocarbons. This led us to analyze whether Crc also regulates the expression of the other central catabolic pathways for aromatic compounds present in P. putida. It was found that genes required to assimilate benzoate through the catechol pathway (benA and catBCA) and 4 -OH-benzoate through the protocatechuate pathway (pobA and pcaHG) are also negatively modulated by Crc. However, the pathway for phenylacetate appeared to be unaffected by Crc.

30|$|In this work, an {{evolutionary}} engineering approach {{was applied to}} select a spontaneous mutant with higher specific xylose consumption rate. For this, the recombinat xylose-fermenting strain expressing xylose isomerase from B. cenocepacia was submitted to sequential batch cultivations in YNB-medium supplemented with 2 % xylose. According to some authors (Ha et al. 2011), the delay in the xylose consumption caused by glucose {{is related to the}} <b>catabolic</b> <b>repression</b> phenomenon. To investigate the effect of this engineering approach on the capacity of cells to consume xylose in the presence of glucose, cells were pre-grown on YNB-media containing different glucose-xylose mixtures and subsequently transferred to a fermentation medium containing 2 % xylose and 2 % glucose. Similarly to a previous report (Stambuk et al. 2008), our fermentation processes used high yeast cell densities and media poor in nutrients to increase ethanol yield, in detriment of cell growth rate. According to Table  1, the evolved strain showed a substantially higher xylose consumption rate when compared to the un-evolved strain (around 10 -fold higher). Furthermore, the rate of xylose consumption by cells pre-grown under higher glucose concentrations was more than 80 % of the rate of glucose consumption. Interestingly, the beneficial effect of glucose on xylose consumption was observed in both strains, strongly indicating that xylose metabolism is not subjected to <b>catabolic</b> <b>repression.</b> These results lead {{to the conclusion that the}} success of evolutionary engineering should not relate to the selection of unrepressed derivatives, which no longer respond to the presence of glucose, as previously suggested in the literature (Ha et al. 2011).|$|E

40|$|Recent {{studies have}} {{suggested}} that the onset of synthesis of actinomycin D in Streptomyces parvulus is due to a release from L-glutamate <b>catabolic</b> <b>repression.</b> In the present investigation we showed that S. parvulus has the capacity to maintain high levels of intracellular glutamate during the synthesis of actinomycin D. The results seem contradictory, since actinomycin D synthesis cannot start before a release from L-glutamate <b>catabolic</b> <b>repression,</b> but a relatively high intracellular pool of glutamate is needed for the synthesis of actinomycin D. Utilizing different labeled precursors, D-[U- 13 C]fructose and 13 C- and 15 N-labeled L-glutamate, and nuclear magnetic resonance techniques, we showed that carbon atoms of an intracellular glutamate pool of S. parvulus were not derived biosynthetically from the culture medium glutamate source but rather from D-fructose catabolism. A new intracellular pyrimidine derivative whose nitrogen and carbon skeletons were derived from exogenous L-glutamate was obtained as the main glutamate metabolite. Another new pyrimidine derivative that had a significantly reduced intracellular mobility and that was derived from D-fructose catabolism was identified in the cell extracts of S. parvulus during actinomycin D synthesis. These pyrimidine derivatives may serve as a nitrogen store for actinomycin D synthesis. In the present study, the N-trimethyl group of a choline derivative was observed by 13 C nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy in growing S. parvulus cells. The choline group, as well as the N-methyl groups of sarcosine, N-methyl-valine, and the methyl groups of an actinomycin D chromophore, arose from D-fructose catabolism.

30|$|For the {{production}} of biofuels, so far the mesophilic engineered organisms or enzymes have been the favored choices. The reasons for this choice are mainly the deep knowledge of their metabolic pathways and genetic tools that have been established to engineer those. But {{in the last few}} years, due to stoutness and versatility of thermophilic organisms some alternative approaches have also been made on these organisms and their enzymes (Barnard et al. 2010). It has been observed in most of the fungi that the expression of xylanolytic enzymes is subjected to specific induction in xylan or xylose presence and to carbon catabolite repression that is mediated by the catabolite repressible entities (CreA) repressor (Prathumpai et al. 2004). The transcription activator XlnR also mediates the regulation of β-Xylosidases that regulates the expression of different genes which are involved in the degradation of xylan (Stricker et al. 2008). The transcription and repression of xlnR gene is controlled by carbon sources and CreA respectively (Tamayo et al. 2008) therefore, a balance between transcription of XlnR factor and CreA repressor is responsible for transcription regulation of xylanolytic enzymes such as β-Xylosidases. From T. emersonii the gene encoding β-Xylosidase (bxl 1) was isolated and cloned in E. coli (Reen et al. 2003). The inferred amino acid sequence reveals homology with β-Xylosidase gene products from T. reesei, A. nidulans and A. niger and with some β-Xylosidase genes belonging to GH family 3. It was found that β-Xylosidase gene was induced by xylan, d-xylose and also by methyl-β-d-xylopyranoside but not with high concentrations. There are six CreA binding sites in the promoter of β-Xylosidase (bxl 1) gene and the observed repression by d-glucose was suggested to be mediated by this catabolite repressor. To regulate and secrete inducible enzymes the <b>catabolic</b> <b>repression</b> plays a vital role. The <b>catabolic</b> <b>repression</b> of β-Xylosidases at molecular level has been related with the presence of CreA binding sites in their promoters and this carbon catabolite repression that is mediated by CreA has also been reported in other fungal genes (Knob et al. 2010).|$|E

This differed considerably from previous studies that reported cellobiose fermentation from other D. bruxellensis strains (Blomqvist et al. 2010; Galafassi et al. 2011). The GDB 248 strain preferred glucose as a carbon source to cellobiose, and {{this resulted in a}} higher rate of ethanol production and fermentation efficiency. This preference could be attributed either to the <b>catabolic</b> <b>repression</b> exerted by the glucose or to its limited capacity for cellobiose assimilation, i.e. a deficiency in The transporter.|$|E
40|$|We {{identified}} in all sequenced Staphylococcus aureus genomes a single ORF that is strongly similar to ArcR {{a member of}} the Crp/Fnr family of bacterial transcriptional regulators. The arcR gene encoding ArcR forms an operon with the arginine deiminase (ADI) pathway genes arcABDC that enable utilization of arginine as a source of energy for growth under anaerobic conditions. In this report we show that under anaerobic conditions S. aureus growth is subject to glucose <b>catabolic</b> <b>repression</b> and is enhanced by arginine. Likewise, glucose and arginine have reciprocal effects on transcription of the arcABDCR genes. Further, we show using a mutant deleted for arcR, that transcription of the arc operon under anaerobic conditions strictly depends on a functional ArcR. These findings are supported by proteome analysis which shows that in anaerobic conditions expression of the ADI catabolic proteins depends on ArcR. Bioinformatic analysis of the S. aureus ArcR predicts a N-terminal nucleotide binding domain and a C-terminal helix-turn-helix DNA binding motif. We show that ArcR binds to a conserved Crp-like sequence motif TGTGA-N 6 -TCAC...|$|E

Bacteriol. 84 : 23 – 30. 1962 —The hybrid Saccharomyces fragilis × S. dobzhanskii produced a constitutive β-glucosidase when grown in succinate synthetic medium. Upon addition of β-glucosides, thio-β-glucosides, or low concentrations of glucose, a further induction of enzyme synthesis was observed. Studies with other sugars revealed some specificity {{in response to}} hexose induction. Phenyl-thio-β-d-glucoside did not affect constitutive synthesis nor induction by glucosides, thio-glucosides, or glucose. Repression of β-glucosidase synthesis is brought about by high concentrations of glucose and other carbon compounds. Preinduction does not confer resistance to <b>catabolic</b> <b>repression</b> of enzyme synthesis; {{this leads to the}} conclusion that two sites of control for β-glucosidase synthesis are present in yeast. Multiplicity of control is further suggested from: (i) the properties of the inducing system; (ii) semiconstitutive nature of enzyme synthesis; (iii) the repression of constitutive synthesis by glucose; (iv) the elevated derepressed rates of enzyme synthesis after glucose inhibition; and (v) the selection of a family of low constitutive mutants with variable inducibility...|$|E
40|$|Improved {{productivity}} and costs reduction in fermentation processes may be attained by using flocculating cell cultures. The production of extracellular heterologous β-galactosidase by recombinant flocculating Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells, expressing the lacA gene (coding for β-galactosidase) of Aspergillus niger under the ADHI promotor and terminator in a bioreactor was studied. The effects of lactose concentration and yeast extract concentration on β-galactosidase production in a semi-synthetic medium were analysed. The extracellular β-galactosidase activity increased linearly with increasing initial lactose concentrations (5 – 150 g dmˉ³). β-Galactosidase production also increased with increased yeast extract concentration. During the entire fermentation, no accumulation of the hydrolysed sugars, glucose and galactose, was observed. The <b>catabolic</b> <b>repression</b> of the recombinant strain when cultured {{in a medium}} containing equal amounts of glucose and galactose was confirmed. In complete anaerobiosis, the fermentation of lactose resulted in a very slow fermentation pattern {{with lower levels of}} β-galactosidase activity. The bioreactor operation together with optimisation of culture conditions (lactose and yeast extract concentration) led to a 21 -fold increase in the extracellular β-galactosidase activity produced when compared with preliminary Erlenmeyer fermentations...|$|E
40|$|Lactose {{metabolism}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} important areas of research on Lactic Acid Bacteria (LAB). In rapidly acidifying industrial Lactococcus lactis strains, lactose is transported by a lactose-specific phosphotransferase system (PTS) encoded by a plasmid. However, an alternative lactose catabolic pathway was evidenced in the plasmid-cured, and thus initially lactose-negative L lactis IL 1403. We showed that in this strain the chromosomally-encoded cellobiose-specific PTS system comprising the celB, ptcB and ptcA genes is also able to transport lactose. By expression studies in the wild type IL 1403 strain and IBB 550, its ccpA-deficient derivative, we demonstrated that celB, ptcB and ptcA are tightly regulated by the general catabolite repression system, whereas celB additionally requires the presence of cellobiose to be fully induced. The comparison of expression levels of sugar catabolic genes indicated that the efficiency of CcpA-mediated <b>catabolic</b> <b>repression</b> depends on conservation of the cre sequence, and that in the case of perfect matching with the cre consensus. CcpA still drives a strong repression even under non-repressing conditions. (C) 2010 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|The SNF 1 gene product, a serine/threonine protein kinase, is {{a global}} {{regulatory}} protein which has been isolated from several organisms. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae the SNF 1 gene product {{is essential for the}} derepression of glucose repression since snf 1 strains are unable to utilize sucrose, galactose, maltose, melibiose, or nonfermentable carbohydrates. Moreover, the SNF 1 gene product was suggested to interact with additional regulatory pathways and to affect the expression of multiple target genes as reflected by the pleiotropic nature of the snf 1 mutation. Here we report the characterization of the SNF 1 homolog of Candida glabrata, a pathogenic yeast phylogenetically related to S. cerevisiae. The carbon utilization spectrum of C. glabrata is considerably narrower than that of other pathogenic yeasts, and the majority of the strains utilize solely glucose and trehalose from among 20 of the most commonly tested carbohydrates. Disruption of the C. glabrata SNF 1 homolog resulted in the loss of the ability to utilize trehalose, indicating that even in an organism with such a limited carbon utilization spectrum, the regulatory mechanism governing <b>catabolic</b> <b>repression</b> is preserved...|$|E
40|$|Solid-state {{fermentation}} (SSF) is a {{fermentation process}} which uses moist solid supports (mainly, agro-industrial residues) as substrate. This process has many advantages {{when compared with}} submerged fermentation (SmF) and is being successfully exploited {{for the production of}} enzymes and secondary metabolites. Its advantages include higher fermentation productivity, higher concentration of the products, less <b>catabolic</b> <b>repression,</b> low water and energy demanding, less effluent generation, and requirement of simple fermentation equipments [1]. This research group has been working in the production of fungi enzymes using SSF. Recently, we reported the production, isolation and purification of an ochratoxin A (OTA) hydrolytic enzyme [2]. This enzyme was produced by SSF on wheat germ and purified from the culture filtrate by acetone precipitation and anion exchange chromatography. The isolated enzyme is a metalloenzyme which can degrade OTA at pH 7. 5 and 37 ºC, allowing its detoxification. OTA is a mycotoxin produced by several fungi in some agricultural commodities being present in food and feed products. Presently, we are assessing the application of this enzyme on detoxification processes for some agricultural commodities...|$|E

Bacteriol. 89 : 1082 – 1085. 1965. —Escherichia coli was grown in continuous culture at various rates in a defined medium with either glucose of (NH 4) 2 SO 4 as the rate-limiting substrate. Cellular content of polysaccharide (“glycogen”) is greater in cells grown under nitrogen limitation with glucose available in excess, and is greater in rapidly grown than in slowly grown cells. The ability of cells {{to carry on}} endogenous respiration, as measured by tetrazolium reduction, can be correlated with their glycogen content. In carbon-limited cultures, the proportion of substrate glucose diverted to glycogen production is least for cells grown slowly, which may reflect greater energy requirements for cell maintenance in such cultures. The activity of glucose- 6 -phosphate dehydrogenase (indicating function of a C- 1 preferential pathway for glucose degradation) is greater in rapidly grown cells, confirming earlier observations in batch cultures. Activity of this enzyme is also greater in nitrogen-limited than in carbon-limited cells, suggesting {{that there may be}} <b>catabolic</b> <b>repression</b> of the Embden-Meyerhoff pathway when glucose is available in excess...|$|E
40|$|AbstractLactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris CECT 8666 (formerly GE 2 - 14) is a dairy {{strain that}} catabolizes agmatine (a decarboxylated {{derivative}} of arginine) into the biogenic amine putrescine by the agmatine deiminase (AGDI) pathway [1]. The AGDI cluster of L. lactis is composed by five genes aguR, aguB, aguD, aguA and aguC. The last four genes {{are responsible for}} the deamination of agmatine to putrescine and are co-transcribed as a single policistronic mRNA forming the catabolic operon aguBDAC [1]. aguR encodes a transmembrane protein that functions as a one-component signal transduction system that senses the agmatine concentration of the medium and accordingly regulates the transcription of aguBDAC [2], which is also transcriptionally regulated by carbon <b>catabolic</b> <b>repression</b> (CCR) via glucose, but not by other sugars such as lactose and galactose [1, 3]. Here we report the transcriptional profiling of the aguR gene deletion mutant (L. lactis subsp. cremoris CECT 8666 ∆aguR) [2] compared to the wild type strain, both grown in M 17 medium with galactose as carbon source and supplemented with agmatine.
