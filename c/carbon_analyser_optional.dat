These optical measurements are sometimes used to apply the technique of absorption photometers.

Application of the calibration to an independent data set of MAAP and OC/EC observations for the same location shows that the calibration is applicable to other observation periods. Because of simultaneous measurements of light absorption properties of the aerosol and elemental carbon, variation in the mass absorption efficiency (MAE) can be studied.

40|$|A new {{approach}} to autonomously determine concentrations of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and its carbon stable isotope ratio (δ 13 C–DIC) at high temporal resolution is presented. The simple method requires no customised design. Instead it uses two commercially available instruments currently used in aquatic carbon research. An inorganic <b>carbon</b> <b>analyser</b> utilising non-dispersive infrared detection (NDIR) is coupled to a Cavity Ring-down Spectrometer (CRDS) to determine DIC and δ 13 C–DIC based on the liberated CO 2 from acidified aliquots of water. Using a small sample volume of 2  mL, the precision and accuracy of the new method was comparable to standard isotope ratio mass spectrometry (IRMS) methods. The system achieved a sampling resolution of 16  min, with a DIC precision of ± 1. 5 to 2  µmol kg − 1 and δ 13 C–DIC precision of ± 0. 14  ‰ for concentrations spanning 1000 to 3600  µmol kg − 1.

A single calibration to the Multi-Angle Absorption Photometer (MAAP), which is in our study used as a reference method, is needed to link the attenuation by aerosol on the filter to the absorption coefficient of the aerosol in ambient air.

Two sites were in London—a Central London site (CL, St Pauls Cathedral) and a suburban North London site (NL, Bounds Green); the other two sites were in Porto, Portugal and Vienna, Austria. TSP was collected using a low volume sampler. Organic carbon (OC) and elemental carbon (EC) concentrations were measured using a thermal–optical <b>carbon</b> <b>analyser.</b> Parallel samplers collected TSP for subsequent GC-MS analysis of thirty-nine combustion-associated organic compounds; 16 polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and 23 n-alkanes.

Seasonal patterns of OCEC ratios were similar at the London and Vienna sites, with highest ratios in autumn and winter, and annual mean OCEC ratios were identical at these sites. The Carbon Preference Index (CPI) indicated vehicle emissions to have a stronger influence over particulate concentrations at the Vienna and central London sites; there was a stronger biogenic signature in north London and Porto.

40|$|RATIONALE Quantifying the {{processes}} that control dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) dynamics in aquatic systems is essential for progress in ecosystem carbon budgeting. The development of a methodology that allows high-resolution temporal data collection over prolonged periods is essential and is described in this study. METHODS A novel sampling instrument that sequentially acidifies aliquots of water and utilises gas-permeable ePTFE tubing to measure the dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) concentration and δ 13 CDIC values at sub-hourly intervals by Cavity Ring-down spectrometry (CRDS) is described. RESULTS The minimum sensitivity of the isotopic, continuous, automated dissolved inorganic <b>carbon</b> <b>analyser</b> (ISO-CADICA) system is 0. 01 [*]mM with an accuracy of 0. 008 [*]mM. The analytical uncertainty in δ 13 CDIC values {{is proportional to the}} concentration of DIC in the sample. Where the DIC concentration is greater than 0. 3 [*]mM the analytical uncertainty is ± 0. 1 ‰ and below 0. 2 [*]mM stability is[*]<[*]± 0. 3 ‰. The isotopic effects of air temperature, water temperature and CO 2 concentrations were found to either be negligible or correctable. Field trials measuring diel variation in δ 13 CDIC values of coral reef associated sea water revealed significant, short-term temporal changes and illustrated the necessity of this technique. CONCLUSIONS Currently, collecting and analysing large numbers of samples for δ 13 CDIC measurements is not trivial, but essential for accurate carbon models, particularly on small scales. The ISO-CADICA enables on-site, high-resolution determination of DIC concentration and δ 13 CDIC values with no need for sample storage and laboratory analysis. The initial tests indicate that this system can offer accuracy approaching that of traditional IRMS analysis...|$|R

40|$|The {{measurements}} of {{dissolved organic carbon}} (DOC) and total dissolved nitrogen (TDN) in seawater are key in global change and coastal eutrophication studies. Nowadays, the high-temperature combustion (HTC) technique is a widely used method for DOC and TDN analysis. However, uncertainties exist about {{the operation of the}} catalyst in the conversion process of DOC and TDN in the HTC method. In this study, five different 'catalyst' materials were tested for their blanks, calibration slopes, and conversion efficiency of DOC and TDN using the Shimadzu TOC 5000 A total organic <b>carbon</b> <b>analyser</b> coupled to a Sievers NCD 255 nitrogen chemiluminescence detector. The materials included four metallic catalysts (Shimadzu and Johnson 0. 5 % Pt-alumina, 13 % Cu(II) O-alumina, 0. 5 % Pd-alumina) and quartz beads. The results indicated that DOC blank signals for the HTC approach using metallic catalysts with an alumina support are higher compared with quartz beads, {{as a result of the}} amphoteric nature of the alumina. However, the slopes of the standard calibration graphs were lowest for DOC and TDN determinations on the quartz beads. The DOC recoveries for the metallic catalysts were close to 100 % for all compounds tested, with the exception of ammonium pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate. Using quartz beads, poor recoveries were obtained for a range of organic compounds, including the commonly used calibration compounds potassium hydrogen phthalate and glycine. The TDN recoveries for all compounds were typically > 90 %, with the exception of NaNO 2. Furthermore, analysis using the CuO-alumina and Pd-alumina catalysts and quartz beads showed low recoveries for NH 4 Cl. This study showed that catalyst performance should be verified on a regular basis using model compounds and blank checks made during every run, and that the Shimadzu 0. 5 % Pt-alumina material was an efficient catalyst for DOC and TDN analyses using the coupled total organic carbon-nitrogen chemiluminescence detector (TOC-NCD) analyser...|$|R

40|$|Globally, {{dissolved}} {{inorganic carbon}} (DIC) {{accounts for more than}} half the annual flux of carbon exported from terrestrial ecosystems via rivers. Here, we assess the relative influences of biogeochemical and hydrological processes on DIC fluxes exported from a tropical river catchment characterized by distinct land cover, climate and geology transition from the wet tropical mountains to the low-lying savanna plains. Processes controlling changes in river DIC were investigated using dissolved organic carbon, particulate organic carbon and DIC concentrations and stable isotope ratios of DIC (C- 13 (DIC)) at two time scales: seasonal and diel. The recently developed Isotopic Continuous Dissolved Inorganic <b>Carbon</b> <b>Analyser</b> was used to measure diel DIC concentration and C- 13 (DIC) changes at a 15 -min temporal resolution. Results highlight the predominance of biologically mediated processes (photosynthesis and respiration) controlling diel changes in DIC. These resulted in DIC concentrations varying between 3. 55 and 3. 82 mg/l and C- 13 (DIC) values ranging from - 19. 7 +/- 0. 31 parts per thousand to - 17. 1 +/- 0. 08 parts per thousand. In contrast, at the seasonal scale, we observed wet season DIC variations predominantly from mixing processes and dry season DIC variations due to both mixing processes and biological processes. The observed wet season increases in DIC concentrations (by 6. 81 mg/l) and C- 13 (DIC) values of river water (by 5. 4 parts per thousand) largely result from proportional increases in subsurface inflows from the savanna plains (C- 4 vegetation) region relative to inflows from the rainforest (C- 3 vegetation) highlands. The high DIC river load during the wet season resulted in the transfer of 97 % of the annual river carbon load. Therefore, in this gaining river, there are significant seasonal variations in both the hydrological and carbon cycles, and there is evidence of substantial coupling between the carbon cycles of the terrestrial and the fluvial environments. Recent identification of a substantial carbon sink in the savannas of northern Australia during wetter years in the recent past {{does not take into account}} the possibility of a substantial, rapid, lateral flux of carbon to rivers and back to the atmosphere...|$|R

40|$|A {{series of}} 7 -week {{sampling}} campaigns {{were conducted in}} urban background sites of six European cities as follows: Duisburg (autumn), Prague (winter), Amsterdam (winter), Helsinki (spring), Barcelona (spring) and Athens (summer). The campaigns were scheduled to include seasons of local public health concern due to high particulate concentrations or findings in previously conducted epidemiological studies. Aerosol samples were collected in parallel with two identical virtual impactors that divide air particles into fine (PM 2. 5) and coarse (PM 2. 5 - 10) size ranges. From the collected filter samples, elemental (EC) and organic (OC) carbon contents were analysed with a thermal-optical <b>carbon</b> <b>analyser</b> (TOA); total Ca, Ti, Fe, Si, Al and K by energy dispersive X-ray fluorescence (ED-XRF); As, Cu, Ni, V, and Zn by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP/MS); Ca 2 +, succinate, malonate and oxalate by ion chromatography (IC); and the sum of levoglucosan+galactosan+mannosan (&#x 2211;MA) by liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC/MS). The campaign means of PM 2. 5 and PM 2. 5 - 10 were 8. 3 - 29. 6 µg m - 3 and 5. 4 - 28. 7 µg m - 3, respectively. The contribution of particulate organic matter (POM) to PM 2. 5 ranged from 21 % in Barcelona to 54 % in Prague, while that to PM 2. 5 - 10 ranged from 10 % in Barcelona to 27 % in Prague. The contribution of EC was higher to PM 2. 5 (5 - 9 %) than to PM 2. 5 - 10 (1 - 6 %) in all the six campaigns. Carbonate (C(CO 3), that interferes with the TOA analysis, was detected in PM 2. 5 - 10 of Athens and Barcelona but not elsewhere. It was subtracted from the OC by a simple integration method that was validated. The CaCO 3 accounted for 55 % and 11 % of PM 2. 5 - 10 in Athens and Barcelona, respectively. It was anticipated that combustion emissions from vehicle engines affected the POM content in PM 2. 5 of all the six sampling campaigns, but a comparison of mass concentration ratios of the selected inorganic and organic tracers of common sources of organic material to POM suggested also interesting differences in source dominance during the campaign periods: Prague (biomass and coal combustion), Barcelona (fuel oil combustion, secondary photochemical organics) and Athens (secondary photochemical organics).

40|$|Treatment {{of surface}} {{water in the}} {{presence}} of natural organic matters (NOM) becomes a challenging issue to meet stringent rules of Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA). Ultrafiltration (UF) membrane is emerging as an efficient technology for the purpose of potable water production. However, membrane fouling, ageing and chemical cleaning affect its performance and properties. The effects of ageing and chemical cleaning on performance and properties of the membrane were studied using UF membrane from full scale drinking water membrane filtration plant and simulated chemical cleaning sequences in laboratory. Organic and inorganic foulants, and membrane properties such as tensile strength, membrane morphology and surface functional groups were characterized using various analytical tools. The results from simulated chemical cleaning experiments were consistent with those from a full-scale plant, in terms of the effects of chemical cleaning on membrane properties. The results show that membrane ageing deteriorated the tensile strength and membrane integrity, and led to accumulation of foulants. Hypochlorite cleaning resulted in a decrease in membrane tensile strength, while citric acid cleaning had limited effect on membrane tensile strength. The decrease in membrane tensile strength correlated to a decrease in intensity of functional groups measured by FTIR. The results suggest that hypochlorite concentration and cleaning time should be minimized to reduce their impacts on membrane properties. Additionally, membrane cleaning strategies (cleaning agents? concentration, cleaning time, pH, backwash frequency, and production time) currently used in Bare Point Water Treatment Plant were studied using a ZW- 1000 pilot scale plant. The membrane performance in terms of permeability recovery was assessed using the recorded data; and organic and inorganic foulants were analyzed using Total Organic <b>Carbon</b> <b>analyser</b> (TOC) and Inductively Coupled Plasma-Atomic Emission Spectroscopy (ICP-AES). In sodium hypochlorite (NaClO) cleaning, lower concentrations combined with longer soak time achieved higher permeability recovery, with TOC results indicating that the major foulants responsible for permeability decrease were organic. Similarly, the results of citric acid cleaning suggest that lower pH was more effective in permeability recovery. Furthermore, the effect of production cycle or backwash frequency on the membrane performance was also studied to optimize water recovery; the results revealed that the membrane performances, fouling rate in terms of rate of change of TMP, recovery (%), and organic fouling depended on permeate cycle length or back wash frequency. This research concludes with the hypothesis that membrane fouling and ageing deteriorate membrane performance, whereas chemical cleaning agent (NaClO) enhances membrane performance and properties, respectively...|$|R
40|$|A {{series of}} 7 -week {{sampling}} campaigns {{were conducted in}} urban background sites in the six European cities as follows: Duisburg 4 October&ndash; 21 November 2002 (autumn), Prague 29 November 2002 &ndash; 16 January 2003 (winter), Amsterdam 24 January&ndash; 13 March 2003 (winter), Helsinki 21 March&ndash; 12 May 2003 (spring), Barcelona 28 March&ndash; 19 May 2003 (spring) and Athens 2 June&ndash; 21 July 2003 (summer). The campaigns were scheduled to include seasons of local public health concern due to high PM concentrations or findings in previously conducted epidemiological studies. Aerosol samples were collected in parallel with two identical virtual impactors (VI), which divide air PM into two size fractions, PM 2. 5 and PM 2. 5 - 10 . The filter samples were analysed with a microbalance, an energy dispersive X-ray fluorescence (ED-XRF), an ion chromatograph (IC) and a thermo-optical <b>carbon</b> <b>analyser</b> (TOA). The PM 2. 5 and PM 2. 5 - 10 campaign means ranged 8. 3 &ndash; 29. 6 &micro;g&nbsp;m- 3 and 5. 4 &ndash; 28. 7 &micro;g&nbsp;m- 3 , respectively. The ''wet and cool'' seasons favoured low coarse PM concentration and high fine PM concentration, whereas {{the spring and summer}} led to low fine and high coarse PM concentrations. The contribution of particulate organic matter (POM) to PM 2. 5 - 10 was highest (27 %) in Prague and the lowest (10 %) in Barcelona, while those to PM 2. 5 were generally higher, ranging from 21 % in Barcelona to 54 % in Prague. The contribution of elemental carbon (EC) to PM 2. 5 - 10 were relatively low (1 &ndash; 6 %) in all the six European cities but it contributed somewhat higher (5 &ndash; 9 %) to PM 2. 5 . The differences are most likely due to variable contributions of local emission sources and seasonal factors such as domestic heating, vehicle exhausts and photochemical reactions. Carbonate, which interferes with carbon analysis by evolving stage at 900 &deg;C, was detected in the coarse particles of Athens and Barcelona and it could be separated reliably from OC by a simple integrating method. The calcium carbonate in Athens and Barcelona accounted for 56 % and 11 % of coarse PM masses, respectively. Carbonate was not found in other cities or in PM 2. 5 . The mean PM 2. 5 mass portions of five OC thermal fractions (OC 1, OC 2, OC 3, OC 4 and OCP) varied in the range 26 &ndash; 33 %, 6 &ndash; 10 %, 7 &ndash; 10 %, 9 &ndash; 22 % and 29 &ndash; 50 %, respectively, in six cities. The differences in the mass portion profiles were relatively small between the cities...|$|R
40|$|Black carbon (BC) aerosol {{plays an}} {{important}} role in climate forcing. The net radiative effect is strongly dependent on the physical properties of BC particles. A single particle soot photometer and a <b>carbon</b> monoxide <b>analyser</b> were deployed during the Chinese Lunar Year (CLY) and on weekdays at Xi’an, China, to investigate the characteristics of refractory black carbon aerosol (rBC). The rBC mass on weekdays (8. 4  μg·m− 3) exceeds that during the CLY (1. 9 μg·m− 3), presumably due to the lower anthropogenic emissions during the latter. The mass size distribution of rBC shows a primary mode peak at ~ 205 nm and a small secondary mode peak at ~ 102 -nm volume-equivalent diameter assuming 2 g·cm− 3 in void-free density in both sets of samples. More than half of the rBC cores are thickly coated during the CLY (fBC = 57. 5 %); the percentage is slightly lower (fBC = 48. 3 %) on weekdays. Diurnal patterns in rBC mass and mixing state differ for the two sampling periods, which are attributed to the distinct anthropogenic activities. The rBC mass and CO mixing ratios are strongly correlated with slopes of 0. 0070 and 0. 0016 μg·m− 3 ·ppbv− 1 for weekdays and the CLY, respectively...|$|R
40|$|Environment Canterbury has a {{proposed}} plan to address elevated wintertime particle concentrations in Christchurch and other Canterbury towns. The proposed plan sets out air quality objectives for Canterbury and specifically targets {{the main source}} of wintertime particles, residential heating. Environment Canterbury is reliant on the plan strategies to meet the targets specified, and to meet the recently established National Environmental Standard for PM₁₀. The contribution of residential heating, relative to other sources, has been quantified by emission inventory (coupled with a box model). The appropriateness of measures contained in the proposed plan is debated by some, who are sceptical of the inventory results. Progress in air quality management in Christchurch would be facilitated by improving the understanding of PM ₂. ₅ and its sources by undertaking an alternative approach to source attribution. A source apportionment study was therefore conducted during 2001 / 2002 to address these issues. This aimed to determine the chemical composition of fine particles (PM ₂. ₅) in Christchurch, investigate and trial a receptor model, identify the main sources contributing to PM ₂. ₅ and estimate relative source contributions with a view to using the technique to monitor plan strategy effectiveness. This {{is the first time that}} the Positive Matrix Factorisation (PMF) receptor model has been applied to seasonal PM ₂. ₅ data in New Zealand. PM ₂. ₅ samples were collected at St Albans, Christchurch during 2001 and 2002. The filters were analysed for gravimetric mass, elemental species and inorganic ions (24 -hour averages). Organic and elemental carbon were measured using an automatic <b>carbon</b> <b>analyser.</b> The final dataset comprised 159 observations and 15 chemical species. PM ₂. ₅concentrations were seasonally distributed with maximum concentrations occurring in winter. Major elemental constituents were organic and elemental carbon, sulphate, nitrate, sodium, chlorine and sulphur. Combustion-related species were highest in winter and those derived from natural sources (e. g. marine aerosol) predominant in summer. Five factors were resolved using the PMF receptor model: these were identified as wood combustion, marine aerosol, motor vehicles, secondary particulate and aged aerosol. On average, 92 % of PM ₂. ₅mass was explained by the resolved factors. The most important source of PM ₂. ₅, on average, during summer was aged aerosol and in winter was wood combustion. The results were evaluated against inventory-derived data; both methods clearly identified wood combustion as being the predominant source of peak wintertime PM ₂. ₅ (92 % and 89 %, respectively). These results provide independent verification that residential heating is the greatest contributor to wintertime particles, adding to the "weight of evidence" required to justify strategies adopted in Environment Canterbury's proposed plan. Further use of receptor models was recommended as they provide source information unavailable from emission inventories/including contributions from natural sources and secondary particulate, and may be used to track effectiveness of policy implementation...|$|R
40|$|Fifty lung {{function}} laboratories in England and Wales analysed test gas mixtures {{of carbon monoxide}} and helium. Most of them also analysed mixtures of oxygen and carbon dioxide in nitrogen. The percentage accuracy of the results was within 1 % of the expected value in only 14 % of determinations of carbon monoxide concentration, 28 % for carbon dioxide, 37 % for helium, and 48 % for oxygen. The accuracy of ratios of two concentrations of helium and carbon monoxide was better {{than that of the}} individual gas samples. Overall the variation in results between laboratories was wide, the coefficient of variation ranging from about 3 % for analysis of helium to 9 % for carbon dioxide. This variation affected the values calculated for carbon monoxide transfer factor, where 20 % were in error by more than 5 %, and for the calculated value of the respiratory exchange ratio, where the interlaboratory coefficient of variation was about 10 %. Errors in analysis were due to unsatisfactory calibration of analysers; five oxygen analysers had large zero errors; five <b>carbon</b> monoxide <b>analysers</b> and one helium analyser had notably curvilinear calibration curves. Insufficient information was obtained to ascertain the nature of the errors in analysis of carbon dioxide. Given the improvements in instrumentation, these results are evidence for deterioration in analytical standards in {{lung function}} laboratories from the standards of 20 years ago...|$|R
40|$|This study {{presents}} a data set comprising estimated permeabilities of 22 natural mudstones which {{also have been}} characterised {{in terms of their}} pore size distribution, porosity, grain density and Total Organic Carbon (TOC) content. Pore size distribution and grain density were determined using mercury porosimetry and pycnometer method. TOC was determ ined by direct combustion of the organic carbon in LECO RLS- 100 <b>Carbon</b> Sulphur <b>analyser.</b> Permeabilities were estimated based on the measured pore throat size distribution plus assumed pore alignment and pore shape using the model of Yang and Aplin. TOC and grain density ranges from 3. 44 - 9. 98 % and 2. 61 - 2. 70 g/cm 3, respectively. Porosity decreases from ~ 24 - 3 % between the depth range of 1515 - 4781 m. The pore size distribution data show that the m ean pore radius decreases from ~ 36 - 2 nm within the same depth range, the shift to smaller mean pore radii is driven primarily by the collapse of pores larger than 10 nm with increase in consolidation. These values represent some of the smallest pore sizes known for rocks and in part provide a qualitative explanation for the low shale permeabilities. Estimated vertical permeabilities range from 9. 5 × 10 - 23 to 8. 6 × 10 - 21 m 2. In general, permeability decreases logarithmically with porosity...|$|R
40|$|International audienceOrgano-Clay Interactions (OCIs) are {{a poorly}} {{investigated}} topic despite {{the potential benefits}} in both fundamental and industrial studies fields. Indeed, Organic Matter (OM) sorption on clays is a mechanism involved in several research areas: past and actual environmental problematics, hydrocarbons sources rocks or soil sciences considerations. In actual environmental issues, new research axes are emerging on OCIs applications on organic pollutants treatments. In the actual environmental management field, OCIs are investigated in order to characterize the role of clay minerals on landfill barriers strengthening (Sánchez-Jiménez et al., 2011). OCIs investigations in paleoenvironmental field are primordial for the calibration of climatical and paleoecological biomarkers proxies. On the topic of formation and evolution of hydrocarbon source rocks, OCIs {{play an important role}} on the early steps of diagenetic processes. Several models of OM preservation paths are already admitted (Boussafir and Lallier-Verges, 1997). However, those schemes do not consider the function of the mineral fraction and particularly the role of the clayey fraction on sedimentation and preservation of organic matter. In order to test the role of clays on early stages of petroleum source rocks genesis, our study aims to investigate the efficiency of three clays on OM sorption in a marine productive water column. This study was carried out off the eastern Pacific upwelling (Antofagasta bay, Chile) which is considered as one of the four most productive up-welling areas of the South American coast. A combined system of upwelling and surface currents (Humboldt current) sustains a proliferating biomass. Natural and synthetic montmorillonites and natural kaolinite samples have been disposed along the oceanic water column at three depths corresponding to different water oxygenic conditions (oxic, transition and anoxic). After different times of exposure, the samples have been removed and characterized via different analytical methods (Py-GC-MS, Dissoveld Organic <b>Carbon</b> <b>Analyser,</b> XRD and infrared spectroscopy). The contributions of this work can be declined in three points: (i) we observed an increase of the dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations in the water of clay traps compared to marine ones. This evidence has been detected in the traps water after 2 days of interactions, demonstrating a good attraction effect of clays on ambient organic material. Drouin (2007) observed similar result in lacustrine area. (ii) The py-GC-MS molecular results show that fatty acids are the preferentially adsorbed molecular lipids family during the interaction process. The anoxic zone of the water column has been defined as the most propitious area for the organo-clay aggregation process. (iii) X-ray analysis have highlighted an extension of montmorillonites (001) plans spacing suggesting the intercalation of some organic compounds. However, previous studies (Drouin et al., 2010) and some of our results suggest that clays specific surfaces play a major role on the organic sorption. A comparison between theoretically absorbable amount of organic material and effectively quantified ones permitted us to conclude that organic molecules occupied a little part of external clay surface area...|$|R
40|$|In {{the urban}} area of Guangzhou, {{observations}} on aerosol light extinction effect were conducted at a monitoring {{site of the}} South China Institute of Environmental Sciences (SCIES) during April 2009, July 2009, October 2009 and January 2010. The main goal of these observations is to recognise the impact of relative humidity (RH) and particles number distribution on aerosol light extinction. PM 2. 5 was sampled by Model PQ 200 air sampler; ions and OC/EC in PM 2. 5 were identified by the Dionex ion chromatography and the DRI model 2001 <b>carbon</b> <b>analyser,</b> respectively; particles number size distribution was measured by TSI 3321 APS, while total light scattering coefficient was measured by TSI 3563 Nephelometer. Chemical composition of PM 2. 5 was reconstructed by the model ISORROPIA II. As a result, possible major components in PM 2. 5 were (NH 4) 2 SO 4, Na 2 SO 4, K 2 SO 4, NH 4 NO 3, HNO 3, water, POM and EC. Regarding ambient RH, mass concentration of PM 2. 5 ranged from 26. 1 to 279. 1 μg m − 3 and {{had an average of}} 94. 8, 44. 6, 95. 4 and 130. 8 μg m − 3 in April, July, October and January, respectively. With regard to the total mass of PM 2. 5, inorganic species, water, POM, EC and the Residual accounted for 34 – 47 %, 19 – 31 %, 14 – 20 %, 6 – 8 % and 8 – 17 %, respectively. Under the assumption of "internal mixture", optical properties of PM 0. 5 – 20 were estimated following the Mie Model. Optical refractive index, hygroscopic growth factor and the dry aerosol density required by the Mie Model were determined with an understanding of chemical composition of PM 2. 5. With these three parameters and the validated particles number size distribution of PM 0. 5 – 20, the temporal variation trend of optical property of PM 0. 5 – 20 was estimated with good accuracy. The highest average of b ep,pm 0. 5 – 20 was 300 Mm − 1 in April while the lowest one was 78. 6 Mm − 1 in July. Regarding size distribution of b ep,pm 0. 5 – 20, peak value was almost located in the diameter range between 0. 5 and 1. 0 μm. Furthermore, hygroscopic growth of optical properties of PM 0. 5 – 20 largely depended on RH. As RH increased, b ep,pm 0. 5 – 20 grew and favoured a more rapid growth when aerosol had a high content of inorganic water-soluble salts. Averagely, f bep,pm 0. 5 – 20 enlarged 1. 76 times when RH increased from 20 % to 90 %. With regard to the temporal variation of ambient RH, f bep,pm 0. 5 – 20 was 1. 29, 1. 23, 1. 14 and 1. 26 on average in April, July, October and January, respectively...|$|R
