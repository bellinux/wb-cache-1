40|$|Abstract: Experiments were {{performed}} to determine guidelines for the placement of multiple reference microphones for NAH measurements on weakly correlated source regions. It was found that multiple references {{are not required to}} image the same source, and thus the number of references should approximate the expected number of source regions. It was also found that reference microphones should be placed as close to the source as possible, but should be sufficiently separated from each other that they provide independent information.

However, Mormann's emphasis on the entanglement that characterizes topology and its associated metrics is not misplaced. It poses questions about limits of empirical inquiry. For Carnap, to pose a question is to give a statement {{with the task of}} deciding its truth.

This paper analyses and simulates the construction of cognitive social structures in the process of decision making with multiple actors. In this process it is argued that the agent's rational choices may be assessed by its motivations, according to different patterns of social interactions. We first construct an abstract model of social dependence between agents, and define a set of social structures that are easily identifiable according to potential interactions.

The various sources of information must be better attuned to one another, and distribution should be more even. A relatively large amount of prior knowledge is needed before signposting can be used effectively. The amount of information which drivers have to assimilate must be kept within realistic limits. This applies both to information to be assimilated before the journey and to information fed to drivers en route.
