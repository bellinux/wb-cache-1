40|$|Abstract – A {{number of}} European fishing fleets have been {{regulated}} {{through a combination}} of quota and effort (sea days) controls since 2004. These two regulation schemes are, however, interrelated, i. e. a given quota limit will neces-sarily determine the effort used and vice versa. A bioeconomic feedback model is presented which takes this causality between effort and harvest control into account, and switches back and forth between these two regulation schemes depending on which is the binding rule. The model is based on biological stock projection, and quotas are set using the Pope approximation while an economic production function is used to estimate the harvest when the effort is binding. The economic response of <b>the</b> <b>fleet</b> is modelled through a dynamic investment/disinvestment module which evaluates <b>the</b> <b>change</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>fleet</b> capacity given <b>the</b> economic outcome of the fishery. A simple example is presented for the Danish seiners catching cod <b>in</b> <b>the</b> North Sea.

A key challenge for these systems is to develop an overall control system architecture that can perform optimal coordination of <b>the</b> <b>fleet,</b> evaluate <b>the</b> overall <b>fleet</b> performance <b>in</b> real-time, and quickly reconfigure to account for <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> environment or <b>the</b> <b>fleet.</b> <b>The</b> optimal <b>fleet</b> coordination problem includes team composition and goal assignment, resource allocation, and trajectory optimization. These are complicated optimization problems 1 for scenarios with many vehicles, obstacles, and targets. Furthermore, these problems are strongly coupled, and optimal coordination plans cannot be achieved if this coupling is ignored.

Also, this approach permits some steps to be distributed between parallel processing platforms for faster solution. This algorithm estimates the cost of various trajectory options using the distributed platforms and then solves a centralized assignment problem to minimize the mission completion time. The detailed trajectory planning for this assignment can then be distributed back to the platforms.

DPM is essentially the carbonaceous aerosol emitted by diesel engines, with a primary particle size of 10 - 30 nm, though which rapidly agglomerates to form 100 - 300 nm aerosols. Most guidelines limit occupational exposure to DPM (measured as elemental carbon) to 100 μg/m 3, on an 8 -hr averaged basis.

Passenger cars were found to be responsible for the major part of most air pollutants emissions except from nitrogen oxides and particulates emissions. Heavy duty vehicles contribute more than 66 % to nitrogen oxides and particulates emissions. For the whole time period, all calculated pollutants present a decreasing trend, with the exception of carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide which increase constantly, ranging from - 96 % for sulphur dioxide to - 1 % for PM 10. © Springer Science+Business Media B.

40|$|This {{study shows}} the {{short-term}} potential of Intermediate Stop Operations (ISO) {{from an individual}} airline’s perspective. The concept of ISO aims at reducing the fuel consumption on long-haul flights by refueling the aircraft at an intermediate airport. The reduction of the fuel weight at take-off leads to an increase <b>in</b> <b>the</b> overall fuel efficiency. Thus, on longhaul flights with two legs, aircraft with a shorter design range can be operated. The potential of ISO is analyzed by modeling the airlines’ operations based on <b>the</b> route and <b>fleet</b> structure. <b>The</b> substitution of long-haul aircraft by existing, short or medium range aircraft is considered, assuming that flights are performed in two stages. Corresponding block fuel and travel time values are calculated based on EUROCONTROL’s BADA data to identify the most fuel efficient operating mode and airport. Also {{a model for the}} Cash Operating Cost of an airline is set up and applied to calculate the actual cost benefit induced by ISO. <b>The</b> <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> airline’s <b>fleet</b> utilization and schedule feasibility due to longer flight-times are considered <b>in</b> <b>the</b> assessment of the ISO concept. The identified intermediate airports are clustered and their suitability as dedicated ISO hubs is investigated. It is found that an exemplary European hub airline can save up to 11, 400 t per month under real operational conditions, corresponding to 430, 000 t CO 2 per year. This amount can be even multiplied up to tenfold by applying different cabin comfort levels. Whereas the theoretic fuel saving potential is high even for existing aircraft, the study also reveals that with a current fuel price of about 0. 97 USD/kg the cost savings for airlines due to ISO are still little. Anyhow, the attractiveness of the concept grows when the fuel price increases or additional environmental charges are imposed...|$|R
40|$|A formulaÃÃo de polÃticas pÃblicas para o ordenamento da pesca da lagosta Ã papel do Governo Federal, visando compatibilizar interesses diversos na cadeia produtiva da lagosta. Esta Tese de Doutorado apresenta um estudo sobre a pesca de lagostas no Estado do CearÃ, Brasil, uma atividade tradicional desde meados dos anos de 1950, e que representa um importante produto pesqueiro de exportaÃÃo do Brasil, motivado pela escassez de informaÃÃes sobre pesquisa, estatÃstica, monitoramento e avaliaÃÃo. A situaÃÃo histÃrica do setor pesqueiro cearense apresentou alteraÃÃes mÃnimas na frota, nos tipos de embarcaÃÃes, nos aparelhos e mÃtodos de Pesca, assim como nas espÃcies capturadas. Houve um crescimento no contingente de pescadores de lagosta e do seguro-desemprego como benefÃcio social. Foram identificadas algumas lacunas existentes desde a concepÃÃo Ã aplicaÃÃo de parte da legislaÃÃo que envolve a lagosta, seja na identificaÃÃo de Ãreas de criadouros protegidas, no uso do tamanho das malhas e na alteraÃÃo no coeficiente de entralhe das malhas. Para otimizar o processo de comercializaÃÃo e {{posterior}} anÃlise de biologia pesqueira, foi proposta uma padronizaÃÃo internacional para classificaÃÃo da lagosta inteira relacionada ao crescimento coerente das gramaturas e dos tipos. Foram discutidos os vÃrios sistemas de bancos de dados existentes e empregadas por diversos ÃrgÃos no paÃs. No entanto, nÃo foi verificada a integraÃÃo necessÃria para agilizar os procedimentos de monitoramento e avaliaÃÃo, dificultando sobremaneira o processo de gestÃo das polÃticas pÃblicas. Os bancos de dados de embarcaÃÃes pesqueiras presentes nos mais diversos ÃrgÃos - Sisemb/DPC, MPA, SINE, MTE - deveriam se tornar Ãnico e com leitura biomÃtrica do proprietÃrio da tripulaÃÃo, evitando perda de tempo tanto para os usuÃrios, quanto para funcionÃrios pÃblicos que alimentam e atualizam diversas informaÃÃes anualmente. AlÃm disso, recomendaÃÃes ou sugestÃes foram apresentadas para a continuidade e o aprofundamento de temas para o desenvolvimento de futuros estudos empregados na gestÃo da cadeia produtiva da lagosta, ao identificar lacunas e Ãbices que impedem a implantaÃÃo, o monitoramento e a avaliaÃÃo da polÃtica de desenvolvimento da pesca de lagosta por ÃrgÃos pÃblicos. Os 21 cursos de graduaÃÃo em Engenharia de Pesca existentes no Brasil em 2013 e os tecnolÃgicos em Pesca & Aquicultura poderiam contribuir com sua infraestrutura, corpo discente e docente necessÃrios para atingir algumas metas do MPA, como estatÃstica e extensÃes pesqueiras. The role {{of public}} policies application {{for the development}} of lobster fishing is from the Federal Brazilian Government, aiming to reconcile various interests <b>in</b> <b>the</b> productive chain of the lobster fisheries. This D. Sc. thesis presents a study about lobster fishing <b>in</b> <b>the</b> State of CearÃ, Northeast region of Brazil, a traditional activity since the mid of the 1950 &# 769;s, and represents an important fishing product of Brazil's exportation, driven by the lack of information on research, statistics, monitoring and evaluation. The history of <b>the</b> fishing <b>in</b> CearÃ has shown minimal <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>fleet,</b> <b>the</b> types of vessels, the equipment and fishing methods, as well as <b>in</b> <b>the</b> species caught. There was a growing contingent of lobster fishermen and unemployment insurance as a social benefit. Some gaps were identified from design to application of the legislation involving lobster fisheries, since the identification of breeding areas protected, use the size of the meshes to the change on coefficient of the meshes. To optimize the process of commercialization and further analysis of Fisheries Biology, an international standardization was proposed for the classification of the entire lobster growth- related task to consistent weights and types. The various systems of existing databases and employed by various organs <b>in</b> <b>the</b> country were discussed. However, has not been verified the necessary integration to streamline monitoring and evaluation procedures, greatly hindering the process of management of public policies. The databases of fishing vessels present <b>in</b> <b>the</b> most diverse organs - Sisemb/DPC, MPA, SINE, MTE - should become single and with biometric reading by the boat owners, avoiding waste of time for both users, as for civil servants who feed and update information annually. In addition, recommendations or suggestions were presented to continuation and deepening of themes for the devel opment of future studies employed in productive chain management of lobster, and also to identify gaps and obstacles that hinder the implementation, monitoring and evaluation of development policy of lobster fishing by public agencies. The 21 undergraduate programs in Fishing Engineering existing in Brazil <b>in</b> 2013 and <b>The</b> Fishing Technology Colleges could contribute with their infrastructure, student body and teaching staff needed to achieve some goals of the MPA, as statistics and fishing extensions...|$|R
40|$|There is {{increasing}} interest both in Europe and further afield in moving beyond traditional TAC based approaches to fishery management, towards effort and/or capacity based management regimes. This paper {{presents the results}} of a case study on effort and capacity metrics <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Scottish pelagic <b>fleet.</b> Data from 2003 to 2006 were used to model the activities of this fleet to create a series of linked process models that simulate the trip by trip activity of vessels exploiting the mackerel, herring and blue whiting fisheries <b>in</b> <b>the</b> North Sea and Western Atlantic. Scaling the predicted port departure probabilities for the 2003 - 2006 period allows <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> effort within <b>the</b> <b>fleet</b> to be simulated. This suggests that fleet capacity would be 260, 000 tonnes for mackerel with mean days at sea per vessel of 119 days, <b>in</b> comparison with <b>the</b> mean over the 2003 - 2006 period of 126, 900 tonnes which corresponds to 58 days at sea per vessel. Likewise the capacity of <b>the</b> <b>fleet</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> herring fishery would be 151, 700 tonnes with a mean of 53 days at sea per vessel, in comparison to 57, 310 tonnes and 20 days at sea per vessel for the 2003 - 2006 period. Simulations also suggest that days at sea limitations are likely to be a more effective management measure to regulate landings than closed seasons and that, at least for the mackerel fishery, vessel reduction schemes would result in a proportionate decrease in landings that would not vary greatly regardless of which vessels were removed from <b>the</b> <b>fleet.</b> Trends <b>in</b> vessel specifications since 1980 are likely to have increased the capacity of <b>the</b> <b>fleet</b> within <b>the</b> mackerel fishery by approximately 46 %.
