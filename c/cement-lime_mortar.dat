The constituents of the investigated mortar samples are: cement, slaked lime, sand and water. They were mixed to achieve a flow spread of 10 cm. These types of mortars are usually suitable for historical masonry maintenance, but they can also be used for modern buildings, or even for concrete structures coatings to prevent concrete carbonation. All nuclear magnetic resonance relaxation experiments were performed at 20 °C using a low-field nuclear magnetic resonance instrument operable at 20 MHz proton resonance frequency. A slowing down of the hydration kinetics is demonstrated for the samples kept in closed atmosphere conditions.

40|$|The {{formation}} of cured mortar structure in masonry was studied using multiple experimental techniques. Starting with fresh mortar, {{nuclear magnetic resonance}} (NMR) {{was used to measure}} the water extraction during brick laying. After curing, the composition of cured mortar was investigated with polarizing and fluorescent microscopy (PFM) and X-Ray diffraction (XRD). Two typical mortars were investigated: a <b>cement-lime</b> <b>mortar</b> and a cement mortar with air entraining agent. The measurements indicate that the mortar composition (i. e. the contents of sand, cured binder and voids) and the contents of chemical substances of the cured binder (i. e. the contents of calcite and portlandite) change with distance to the brick-mortar interface. For the cement mortar with air entraining agent, the observations are explained by the enrichment of binder towards the brick-mortar interface, resulting from the local compaction and compression of the fresh mortar. In the <b>cement-lime</b> <b>mortar</b> such an enrichment of binder hardly occurs and the observations are explained by the intense carbonation that takes place. As a result, the chemical composition of the binders is very much different in both mortars. In the cement mortar with air entraining agent, near the brick-mortar interface the enrichment of cement and the low water content (resulting from the low water retentivity of this mortar), lower the water-to-cement ratio and as a consequence the cement is not fully hydrated. In the <b>cement-lime</b> <b>mortar,</b> because the Ca(OH) 2 content and the water content is higher, near the brickmortar interface, a carbonated zone is formed which is hardly permeable for CO 2 (and probably water). The latter does not occur in the cement mortar, it remains permeable. The analysis of the experimental results have lead to the formulation of a conceptual model for the {{formation of}} cured mortar structure in masonry. Such a model may be helpful in analysing and predicting the durability of mortars. Applied Science...|$|E

40|$|Blended lime-cement mortars are {{commonly}} used in conservation practices {{even though they may}} show lack of adequate strength and durability for certain cement-lime compositions. This paper focuses on understanding the hardening reactions and their influence on the strength development, microstructure and porosity for the <b>cement-lime</b> <b>mortars</b> in various compositions. Mortars composed of 30 %, 50 % and 70 % ce-ment replacement with lime hydrate and lime putty by mass were studied. Cement hydration has been found to contribute to the early stage strength development while carbonation is mostly favoured after 3 days and con-tributes to the strength development until 180 days. The degree of carbonation is much more pronounced with increasing lime content and porosity of the mortars and the reaction is still in progress at 90 days. All the blended mortars revealed lower compressive and flexural strength than that of the reference cement mortar due to their lower cement content and higher porosity. Long-term compressive strength development has been achieved after 180 days while flexural strength for certain mortar compositions does not increase beyond 28 days. Unlike cement mortar, the mortars blended with lime hydrate and lime putty exhibit an elastic-plastic deformation before failure occurs, which is preferred for repair mortars to adapt to differential settlements and to allow more deformation under critical stresses in the masonry. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Lime-based mortars {{composed}} of calcium silicate binders harden {{as a resu}} lt of a combined reaction of hydration and carbonation. Understanding th is combined reaction mechanism and the consequences on the hardened mort ar properties are essential while assessing how they affect the overall durability of historic masonry. In this research, this combined reaction is studied in mortars with lime-pozzolana, hydraulic lime and cement-li me binders, and the consequences on the physical properties, mechanical properties and microstructure of the mortars are discussed. In-depth res earch has been performed on the hydration and carbonation reactions to p rovide fundamental insight on the reaction mechanisms. Carbonation reaction of calcium hydroxide proceeds as initial carbonatio n at the early stage and increased carbonation at the later stage. Durin g initial carbonation, CO 2 molecules are rapidly absorbed by the alkalin e water, resulting in the precipitation of calcite crystals instantly. T his phase involves a dormant {{period in which the}} reaction controlling fa ctor is the dissolution rate of calcium hydroxide and CO 2 in the pore wa ter. Increased carbonation starts once open pore space is created with t he evaporation of the water, allowing diffusion paths for CO 2 through th e pore structure. Therefore, at later stage diffusion of CO 2 is the rate controlling factor in the carbonation process. CO 2 concentration, relat ive humidity conditions and physical properties of the lime particles ar e found to have an important impact on the habit, size and morphology of the calcite by altering calcium and carbonate ions concentration in the pore water. The consequence of this on the mechanical properties of the mortar is negligible. Hydration reactions are the first reaction order in hydraulic lime and l ime-pozzolana mortars, which proceed more gradually when compared with f ast cement hydration. Carbonation is the complementary reaction in the s trength gain of the mortars and starts once pore structure is formed to allow CO 2 diffusion. Competitive reaction order between hydration and ca rbonation can occur in lime-pozzolana mortars depending on the pozzolani c reactivity of the pozzolana. As a consequence of the consumption of th e calcium hydroxide by the carbonation reaction, the degree of the pozzo lanic reactions is lowered. The consequence of this on the mechanical pr operties is remarkable while the same impact is not observed on the poro sity. The degree and the order of hydration and carbonation reactions ar e strongly influenced by the moisture content. Hydration reactions are p romoted under moist conditions while carbonation reaction is retarded. H ydraulic lime and lime-pozzolana mortars require at least 28 -day moist c uring to improve the hydration reactions and to ensure sufficient streng th development. In <b>cement-lime</b> <b>mortars,</b> an interaction has been found between the unhydr ated or hydrated calcium aluminates and calcium carbonate originating fr om the addition of lime. Complementary effect of the carbonation reactio n of free lime on the strength development of these mortars is more pron ounced than the lime mortars. Competitive reaction order between cement hydration and carbonation of lime does not occur under atmospheric condi tions because the fast cement hydration is always the first-reaction ord er building up a sound hydrated microstructure.

40|$|Masonry is a layered {{composite}} consisting of mortar and the masonry unit. Perfect {{bond between the}} masonry unit and the mortar {{is essential for the}} masonry to perform as one single entity in order to resist the stresses due to various loading conditions. Nature of stresses developed in the masonry unit and the mortar and the failure pattern of masonry subjected to compression greatly depends upon the relative stiffness of the masonry unit and the mortar. The thesis is focused on (a) some issues pertaining to masonry unit – mortar bond strength and its influence on masonry compressive strength, and (b) developing a finite element (FE) model to predict the compressive strength of masonry. Importance of masonry bond strength and masonry behaviour is highlighted in chapter 1. Characteristics of masonry units and mortars used in the investigations are presented in Chapter 2. Two types of soil-cement blocks with widely varying strength and elastic properties and <b>cement-lime</b> <b>mortars</b> of two different proportions were used in the investigations. Results of stress-strain relationships and other characteristics were determined for the blocks as well as for mortars. Block-mortar combinations were selected to have block modulus to mortar modulus ratio of 1. 0. Different artificial methods of enhancing the shear bond strength of masonry couplets have been discussed in chapter 3. Shear bond strength of the masonry couplets was determined through a modified direct shear box test apparatus. Without altering the block and mortar properties, bond strength values for three block-mortar combinations were generated through experiments. Effect of pre-compression on shear bond strength has also been examined for certain block-mortar combinations. Considering five different bond strength values and three block-mortar combinations, compressive strength and stress-strain characteristics of masonry was obtained through the tests on masonry prisms. A detailed discussion on influence of shear bond strength on masonry compressive strength is presented. Major conclusions of the investigation are: (a) without altering the block and mortar characteristics shear bond strength can be enhanced considerably through the manipulation of surface texture and surface coatings, (b) masonry compressive strength increases linearly as the shear bond strength increases only for the combination of masonry unit modulus less than that of mortar modulus, (c) masonry compressive strength is not sensitive to bond strength variation when the modulus of masonry unit is larger than that of the mortar. Chapter 4 is dedicated {{to the development of a}} 3 D FE model to predict the masonry compressive strength. Literature review of empirical methods/formulae and some failure theories developed to predict masonry strength are presented. Existing FE models for masonry dealing with both macro and micro modelling approaches are reviewed.

40|$|AbstractA facial wall {{is defined}} as an element used outside or inside which should have an {{attractive}} look. It is built from attractive wall elements using standard way of execution and joints filled with mortar appropriate {{for this type of}} wall element. From {{the point of view of}} durability, the mortar is a wall element which not only binds bricks but also takes part in humidity transport. It is associated with mortar microstructure which in comparison to clinker is characterized with high percentage of pores causing capillary flow and wall drying abilities. Mortars belong to the group of chemically active materials for which both internal as external factors are essential. The reason for internal corrosion are mortar components (binder, sand, water, additions). External corrosion includes all cases where mortar is threatened with external factors (CO 2 gas, acid rain, temperature changes exceeding zero point, solution of soluble mineral salts originating from surrounding elements). The factors mentioned essentially influence mortar microstructure changes. This process is distributed in time. This work concerns the analysis of changes in quantity and distribution of pores resulting from many years of functioning of mortar in facial wall threatened with external factors.

Paper I deal with a new method of measuring moisture diffusivity at high moisture levels. Papers II to IV present methods of measuring moisture storage capacity as well as results from such measurements. Paper V evaluates the use of thermal imaging to measure transient moisture profiles. Paper VI shows how the measured moisture properties {{can be used in}} calculations The contents of the six papers are as follows: This paper presents measured moisture diffusivities for several different porous building materials. The diffusivities were calculated from the relation between the water sorption coefficients and the initial water content. The method is based on Boltzmann transformation. Knowledge of moisture storage capacity over the hygroscopic range is essential when calculating the moisture content. Generally storage capacity is represented by water retention curves, in which suction is plotted against moisture content. The pressure plate and pressure membrane technique is often used to measure water retention curves. There are, however, various ways of carrying out such measurements. This paper compares two different methods of presaturating the specimens before testing, namely capillary and vacuum saturation. It also examines the effect of different beddings between the specimen and the ceramic plate. Sorption properties, i. e. information about how much water a porous material holds in different environments, are of interest in many applications. This paper reports on the use of four different methods to measure the sorption isotherm of sandstone. The first method involved equilibrating samples over saturated salt solutions. The second involved weighing small samples in a sorption balance as they were exposed to different relative humidity. The third method was the pressure membrane and pressure plate technique. In the fourth method a newly developed micro-calorimetric technique was used. Despite the differences in the methods, satisfactory agreement was found in the measured sorption isotherm. This paper presents measurements of the moisture storage capacity of several different porous building materials. The storage capacity was measured with a sorption balance in the hygroscopic range and with pressure plate and pressure membrane extractors in the superhygroscopic range. Moisture profiles reveal much about the moisture behavior of a material or combination of materials. One possible method of measuring these profiles is thermal imaging. This paper evaluates this technique on bricks with and without <b>cement-lime</b> <b>mortar</b> attached. Degradation of historical buildings and monuments is an increasing problem in most countries around the world. In order to take the correct measures to preserve the buildings, the process causing the degradation must be identified.

The technique is based on moisture transport calculations and is exemplified using sedimentary calcareous sandstone. The calculations were made at very high moisture levels, both under and over capillary saturation...|$|E
40|$|Fly ash is a {{waste product}} from thermal power plants where {{pulverised}} coal {{is used for the}} generation of electricity. Fly ash is being utilised in the blended cements, additive for concrete and manufacturing of concrete blocks and bricks. Fly ash-lime-gypsum bricks are being manufactured and marketed throughout the country. The literature review on fly ash-lime-gypsum (FALG) mixtures as intended to manufacture bricks or blocks for masonry applications indicates several gaps in understanding the various aspects of the technology. The present thesis is an attempt to understand the behaviour of compacted stabilised fly ash mixtures for the manufacture of fly ash bricks and characteristics of masonry using such bricks. A brief introduction to the technology of compacted stabilised fly ash bricks for structural masonry is provided. Review of the literature on fly ash-lime and fly ash-lime-gypsum mixtures, and fly ash bricks is provided in chapter 1. Chapter 2 gives details of the experimental programme, properties of raw materials used in the experimental investigations, methods of preparing different types of specimens and their testing procedures. Chapter 3 deals with the strength and absorption characteristics of compacted stabilised fly ash mixtures in greater detail. The main focus of the investigations is on arriving at the optimum stabilizer-fly ash mixtures considering density, stabilizer-fly ash ratio, curing conditions, etc. as the variables. Therefore the parameters/variables considered in the investigation include: (a) density of the compacted fly ash mixture, (b) stabilizer-fly ash ratio, (c) curing duration (normal curing and steam curing) and (d) dosage of additives like gypsum. Some of the major conclusions of the investigations are (a) compressive strength of compacted stabilised fly ash mixtures is sensitive to dry density of the specimens and the strength increases with increase in density irrespective of stabiliser content and type of curing, (b) Optimum limefly ash ratio yielding maximum strength is 0. 75, (c) addition of gypsum accelerates rate of strength gain for compacted fly ash-lime mixtures (d) for 28 days wet burlap curing optimum gypsum content yielding maximum strength is 2 % and maximum compressive strength is achieved for lime contents in the range of 10 – 17 %, (e) steam curing (at 80 °C for 24 hours) gives highest compressive strength for compacted fly ash-lime mixtures. Characteristics of compacted fly ash-lime, fly ash-lime-gypsum and fly ash-cement bricks and their masonry are presented in chapter 4. Compressive strength, elastic modulus, water absorption, initial rate of absorption, dimensional stability and durability of the bricks were examined. Compressive strength, flexure bond strength and stress strain relationship for the fly ash brick masonry using <b>cement-lime</b> <b>mortar</b> were evaluated. The investigations clearly show the possibility of producing bricks of good quality using compacted fly ash-lime gypsum mixtures. Wet compressive strengths of 8 - 10 MPa was obtained for compacted fly ash-lime-gypsum bricks at the age of 28 days. Wet strength to dry strength ratio for these bricks is in the range of 0. 55 – 0. 67. Initial tangent modulus for the fly ash-lime-gypsum bricks in saturated condition is in the range of 8000 – 12000 MPa. There is a large scope for selecting optimum mix ratios of fly ash, sand, lime and other additives to obtain a specific designed strength for the brick.
