40|$|We have {{previously}} {{established that the}} anti-cancer lysophospholipid edelfosine (1 -O-octadecyl- 2 -O-methyl-rac-glycero- 3 -phosphocholine, Et- 18 -OCH 3) induces cell death in yeast by selective modification of lipid raft composition at the plasma membrane. In this study we determined that α-tocopherol protects cells from the edelfosine cytotoxic effect, preventing the internalization of sterols and the plasma membrane proton pump ATPase, Pma 1 p. Two non-mutually exclusive hypotheses were considered to explain the protective effect of α-tocopherol: (i) its classical antioxidant activity is necessary to break progression of lipid peroxidation, despite the fact Saccharomyces cerevisiae does not possess polyunsaturated fatty acids and (ii) due to its <b>complementary</b> <b>cone</b> shape, insertion of α-tocopherol could correct membrane curvature stress imposed by edelfosine (inverted cone shape). We then developed tools to distinguish between these two hypotheses and dissect the structural requirements that confer α-tocopherol its protective effect. Our results indicated its lipophilic nature and the H donating hydroxyl group from the chromanol ring are both required to counteract the cytotoxic effect of edelfosine, suggesting edelfosine induces oxidation of membrane components. To further support this finding and {{learn more about the}} early cellular response to edelfosine we investigated the role that known oxidative stress signaling pathways play in modulating sensitivity to the lipid drug. Our results indicate the transcription factors Yap 1 and Skn 7 as well as the major peroxiredoxin, Tsa 1, mediate a response to edelfosine. Interestingly, the pathway differed from the one triggered by hydrogen peroxide and its activation (measured as Yap 1 translocation to the nucleus) was abolished by co-treatment of the cells with α-tocopherol...|$|E
40|$|The Carlingford {{volcanic}} complex has {{an intense}} swarm of minor intrusions associated with it. Field work {{demonstrates that the}} swarm is composite, having involved the repeated injection of magma as dykes, cone sheets and <b>complementary</b> <b>cone</b> sheets {{in at least three}} rythmic cycles. Three major rock series are represented in these bodies: the tholeiitic basalt - craignurite series, the alkali basalt series and the high alumina basalt series, other rock types such as felsites, quartz feldspar porphyries and lamprophyres are present in minor proportions. Analysis of the structure of individual swarms suggests that basaltic magma was injected into the crust as an elongate ridge like body culminating in a cupola beneath the complex, from which cone sheet and radial dyke swarms emerged; linear dyke swarms arose from the ridge crest. Detailed geochemical investigations show, that the main magma series were derived by fractionation from basaltic parents; that two fractionation paths are represented in the alkali basalt series (the trachy basalt - tristanite series and hawaiite - mugearite - benmorite series); that craignurites represent a true fractionation product of tholeiitic magma and are petrochemically distinct from icelandites. Basalt fractionation at Carlingford was dominated by the separation of olivine and plagioclase at low pressure while the petrochemistry of the rocks suggests that the three parental stems - tholeiitic basaft, alkali basalt and high alumina basalt, were derived from a common parent by fractionation at higher pressure. Time relations indicate that common parent to be olivine tholeiite magma which it is suggested was formed at depths in excess of 60 km. Miscellaneous rock types, including felsites,lamprophyres and quartz feldspar porphyries are shown to have been derived by melting of crustal rocks during the injection of basic magma within the complex...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{relationship}} {{between the number of}} solutions to the complementarity problem, w = Mz + q, w⩾ 0, z⩾ 0, wTz= 0, the right-hand constant vector q and the matrix M are explored. The main results proved in this work are summarized below. The number of solutions to the complementarity problem is finite for all q ϵ Rn if and only if all the principal subdeterminants of M are nonzero. The necessary and sufficient condition for this solution to be unique for each q ϵ Rn is that all principal subdeterminants of M are strictly positive. When M⩾ 0, {{there is at least one}} complementary feasible solution for each q ϵ Rn if and only if all the diagonal elements of M are strictly positive; and, in this case, the number of these solutions is an odd number whenever q is nondegenerate. If all principal subdeterminants of M are nonzero, then the number of complementary feasible solutions has the same parity (odd or even) for all q ϵ Rn which are nondegenerate. Also, if the number of complementary feasible solutions is a constant for each q ϵ Rn, then that constant is equal to one and M is a P-matrix. In the cartesian system of coordinates for Rn, an orthant is a convex cone generated by a set of n-column vectors in Rn, {A. 1,…,A. n}, where for each j = 1 to n,A. j is either the jth column vector of the unit matrix of order n (denoted by I. j) or its negative - I. j. There are thus 2 n orthants in Rn, and they partition the whole space. It is interesting to know what properties these orthants possess if we obtain them after replacing - I. j by some given column vector - M. j for j = 1 to n. Orthants obtained in this manner are called <b>complementary</b> <b>cones,</b> and their spanning properties are studied...|$|R
