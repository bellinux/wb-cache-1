5|$|Mahshi (pl. mahshi) {{dishes are}} {{composed}} of rice stuffed vegetables such as, eggplants, baby pumpkins, potatoes, <b>carrots</b> <b>and</b> marrows {{as well as a}} variety of leaf vegetables, primarily grape leaves, cabbage leaves and less often chard. Mahshi requires delicacy and time—the main reason it is prepared before the day it is cooked and served. Many female family members participate in the rolling and stuffing of the vegetables, relaxing the amount of individual effort required, with great attention to detail.|$|E

40|$|Methods are {{described}} by which ribosomal DNA can be enriched in subcellular fractions of <b>carrot</b> <b>and</b> soybean. With both <b>carrot</b> <b>and</b> cucumber {{it was possible}} to obtain a distinct satellite DNA which contained the rDNA. Hybridization values greater than 0. 49 % were necessary before a satellite component was observed. Saturation hybridization values for soybean, <b>carrot,</b> <b>and</b> cucumber DNA were 0. 2, 0. 49, and 1. 14 %, respectively. These values were increased 1. 6 - and 2 -fold in soybean <b>and</b> <b>carrot,</b> respectively, but enrichment was not obtained for cucumber...|$|R

5|$|The art of card {{throwing}} generally {{consist of}} throwing standard playing cards with excessively high speed and accuracy, {{powerful enough to}} slice fruits like <b>carrots</b> <b>and</b> even melons. Like flourishing, throwing cards {{are meant to be}} visibly impressive and does not include magic elements. Magician Ricky Jay popularized throwing cards within the sleight of hand industry with the release of his 1977 book entitled Cards as Weapons, which was met with large sales and critical acclaim. Some magic tricks, both close-up and on stage, are heavily connected to throwing cards.|$|E
5|$|Adler's throat closes {{up during}} the MRI due to an {{allergic}} reaction to gadolinium, prompting two members of House's team, Dr. Robert Chase (Jesse Spencer) and Dr. Allison Cameron (Jennifer Morrison), to perform a tracheotomy. Working in the hospital's clinic, House's first patient {{is a man who}} is orange because of an over-consumption of <b>carrots</b> <b>and</b> mega-dose vitamins (niacin). House also treats a ten-year-old boy whose mother allows him to use his asthmatic inhaler only intermittently instead of daily as prescribed. House criticises the mother for making such a drastic medical decision without first learning more about asthma. During his monologue, House stumbles on an idea and leaves quickly to treat Adler; he diagnoses her with cerebral vasculitis, despite having no proof. House treats Adler with steroids, which improves her condition greatly for a time, until she starts seizing and has heart failure. The team brings her back with a defibrillator.|$|E

5|$|After the E.coli outbreak, Odwalla {{improved}} {{the safety of}} several of its production processes. Before the fruit enters the factory, it is washed, sorted and sanitized. Once it has reached the plant, the apples, <b>carrots,</b> <b>and</b> citrus fruits are separated and washed again. The fruit is pressed to get the juice, which is then flash pasteurized and bottled. A sample undergoes quality testing, and, if it passes, the batch is shipped in refrigerated trucks to various distribution centers in the United States. Odwalla juice has a relatively short shelf life compared to other beverages and thus must be refrigerated. However, after the introduction of flash pasteurization in 1996 and a new plastic bottle in 2001, the shelf life has been considerably extended. Generally, Odwalla products are sold in special Odwalla-brand displays at grocery and convenience stores, instead of being intermixed with other products.|$|E
5|$|Waraq Dawali (stuffed grape leaves), is a mahshi meal {{reserved}} for large gatherings. The grape leaves are normally wrapped around minced meat, white rice and diced tomatoes, however meat {{is not always}} used. Dawali is an excellent representation of the attention to detail commonly found in Palestinian and Levant cuisine, with each piece being tightly wrapped {{to the size of}} cigarette morsels (some families differ in their structure).It is then cooked and served as dozens of rolls on a large plate usually accompanied by boiled potato slices, <b>carrots</b> <b>and</b> lamb pieces. Kousa mahshi are zucchinis stuffed with the same ingredients as waraq al-'ainib and usually served alongside it heavy meals.

40|$|Purpose: Drying {{characteristics}} of the sliced <b>carrot</b> <b>and</b> green pumpkin were investigated by using the waste heat dryer. Methods: The effects of drying temperature () and slice thickness affecting drying time were analyzed. Mathematical models for the drying curves were determined with statistical analysis of drying data. Effective diffusivity was determined for the slices of <b>carrot</b> <b>and</b> green pumpkin under various drying conditions. Results: Drying time was reduced at the drying conditions of thinner slice and higher drying temperature. Moisture ratio () according to drying time () was well presented as an exponential function at all of drying conditions for the slices of <b>carrot</b> <b>and</b> green pumpkin with the determination coefficient () of> 0. 99. The values of effective diffusivity () of the slices for <b>carrot</b> <b>and</b> green pumpkin were increased with increasing the drying temperature. The relationship between Ln() and 1 / was linear with the determination coefficient () of> 0. 97. Conclusions: Drying model was well established as an exponential function at all of drying conditions for drying samples...|$|R
