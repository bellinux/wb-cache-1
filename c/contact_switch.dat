50|$|The Self Winding Clock Company (SWCC) {{was a major}} {{manufacturer}} of electromechanical clocks from 1886 until about 1970. The Self Winding Clock Company clock mechanisms were truly revolutionary because the spring that powers the clock was not wound by hand but with an electric motor. The SWCC of New York {{was one of the}} first companies in the United States to successfully employ electric energy to power a clock. The winding motor is attached to, and mounted below, the conventional clock works. The unique feature of their patented clock mechanism is the automatic rewinding of the main spring each hour by the small electric motor. A <b>contact</b> <b>switch</b> mounted on the clock's center shaft is activated after the clock has run for one hour and the main spring is rewound one revolution. This rewinding occurs each hour. The power for the motor is supplied by batteries and the batteries last about one year before needing to be replaced. This clock mechanism never needed to be wound by hand and this eliminated the concern that someone may forget to wind the clock. Hence the company name, The Self Winding Clock Company.|$|E

Radio Frequency RF) Micro Electro Mechanical Systems (MEMS) with its low power consumption and excellent RF characteristics has a potential of creating new, flexible and cost efficient wireless systems for these markets. In this thesis a set of methods to analyze the characteristics of a novel series resistive <b>contact</b> <b>switch</b> concept are presented. The switch concept is based on the fabrication of a laterally actuated cantilever beam using Deep Reactive Ion Etching (DRIE) and a conformal metal deposition process. The majority of methods presented are analytical but different modules of CoventorWare® and especially ARCHITECT have also been used for verification and supporting analyses. The switch concept offers the possibility to fabricate complex switch geometries with few process steps and potentially no stiction problems during release. The resulting cross-section of the fabricated cantilever beam consists of a single crystal silicon core with a metal cladding layer. This makes the beam less sensitive to residual stress in the metal film. The layered beam can also potentially improve characteristics such as switching time. However, the fabrication process has several disadvantages that for instance apply unfortunate limitations to certain geometric dimensions of the switch. As a result of the lateral actuation configuration, the switch can be incorporated into a coplanar transmission line structure. This offers the possibility to design a switch with good matching to its surrounding circuitry and improved high frequency characteristics. The switch concept is also compared to the more traditional layered surface micromachining approach.
