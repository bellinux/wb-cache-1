50|$|The No. 58 car {{competed in}} all 20 of the 2015 ARCA Racing Series events {{utilizing}} eight different drivers. Michael Lira, the initial primary {{driver of the}} car, did not meet age requirements to compete at four races {{during the first half}} of the ARCA Racing season. John Lowinski-Loh drove the <b>car</b> <b>at</b> Daytona in February. Cole Powell drove the <b>car</b> <b>at</b> Talladega Superspeedway in May and Michigan International Speedway in June. Ryan Reed drove the car to the teams first ARCA Series win at Chicagoland Speedway in June. After Lira raced the No. 58 <b>car</b> <b>at</b> the next three races (Winchester 6/28, Iowa 7/17, Lucas Oil 7/24), the team switched drivers multiple times in the remaining 2015 races. Jairo Avila Jr. drover the <b>car</b> <b>at</b> Pocono Raceway (8/1), Blake Jones raced the <b>car</b> <b>at</b> Berlin Raceway (8/8) and again at Salem Speedway (9/19). Tyler Dippel drove the No. 58 <b>car</b> <b>at</b> the Illinois State Fairgrounds (8/23) and the DuQuoin State Fairgrounds (9/7). Brandon Lynn drove the No. 58 <b>car</b> <b>at</b> Kentucky Speedway (9/26) and Kansas Speedway (10/16). The best finish for the No. 58 car during the stretch between Ryan Reed's win at Chicagoland and the end of the season was by Blake Jones, who started 11th and finished 8th in the Federated Auto Parts 200 at Berlin Raceway.|$|R
5|$|The DB9 is {{the first}} model to be built at Aston Martin's Gaydon {{facility}} in Warwickshire, England. In a 2007 interview, Aston Martin CEO Dr. Ulrich Bez stated that, though Aston Martin was traditionally a maker of more exclusive automobiles, he believed Aston Martin needed to be more visible and build more <b>cars.</b> <b>At</b> launch, Aston Martin planned to build between 1,400 and 1,500 DB9s per year.|$|E
5|$|Amtrak ordered 140 Superliner II {{cars from}} Bombardier Transportation in 1991; Bombardier had {{acquired}} the Superliner patents after Pullman-Standard's closure. The order consisted of 55 sleeping cars, 38 coaches, 20 dining cars, 15 lounges, and 12 transition-dormitory cars. The initial order cost $340 million, and included {{an option for}} 39 additional cars. In late 1993 Amtrak exercised the option for 55 <b>cars</b> <b>at</b> a cost of $110 million, bringing the total order of Superliner II cars to 195. The option included ten dining cars, ten lounges, and 35 transdorms. Bombardier built the order in Barre, Vermont.|$|E
5|$|Amtrak ordered another seven Turboliner trainsets, {{which were}} {{delivered}} between 1976 and 1977. These were manufactured by Rohr Industries, and {{were known as}} RTL Turboliners. They {{were based on the}} earlier RTG series, but had American-style Janney couplers throughout and a different design of power car cab. The standard configuration of each set was five cars: power <b>cars</b> <b>at</b> either end, a food service car, and two coaches. In that configuration, each trainset could carry 264 passengers. At times, Amtrak operated Turboliners with an additional coach cut into the consist. These were the final gas turbine trainsets purchased by Amtrak; conventional diesel locomotive-hauled trains proved cheaper to operate.|$|E

5|$|By 1880 {{the railway}} had six {{locomotives}} at its disposal. No. 1–2 were Class 14 that were intended as helping {{power to get}} trains up the steep climb from Gudå to Storlien. No. 3–6 were Class 9 locomotives that would do the main haulage from Gudå into Trondheim. In 1883, NSB's other two Class 14 locomotives were transferred from the Smaalenene Line. The initial fleet consisted of 24 passenger and nine breaking cars, all from Skabo. The line featured the first bogie cars in the country, with a single entrance {{at the end of}} each car, instead of individual doors for each compartment. There were also 37 closed freight cars, 40 lumber cars, 20 boxcars, 100 flatcars and three milk <b>cars.</b> <b>At</b> first all trains were mixed freight and passenger.|$|E
5|$|DiCaprio's {{career began}} with his {{appearance}} in several commercials and educational films. After being {{removed from the}} set of children's television series Romper Room for being disruptive {{at the age of}} five, he followed his older stepbrother Adam Farrar into television commercials, landing an ad for Matchbox <b>cars</b> <b>at</b> 14. In 1990, he got his break on television when he was cast in the short-lived series based on the movie Parenthood. After Parenthood, DiCaprio had bit parts on several shows, including The New Lassie and Roseanne, as well as a brief stint on the soap opera Santa Barbara, playing the young Mason Capwell. His involvement in Parenthood and the daily soap earned him a nomination for the Young Artist Award for Best Young Actor each.|$|E
5|$|During the 20th century, Bristol's {{manufacturing}} activities {{expanded to include}} aircraft production at Filton by the Bristol Aeroplane Company and aircraft-engine manufacturing by Bristol Aero Engines (later Rolls-Royce) at Patchway. Bristol Aeroplane was known for their World War I Bristol Fighter and World War II Blenheim and Beaufighter planes. During the 1950s they were a major English manufacturer of civilian aircraft, known for the Freighter, Britannia and Brabazon. The company diversified into automobile manufacturing during the 1940s, producing hand-built, luxury Bristol <b>Cars</b> <b>at</b> their factory in Filton, and the Bristol Cars company was spun off in 1960. The city also gave its name to Bristol buses, which were manufactured in the city from 1908 to 1983: by Bristol Tramways until 1955, and from 1955 to 1983 by Bristol Commercial Vehicles.|$|E

5|$|During the December 2014 {{press conference}} announcing {{the start of}} filming, Aston Martin and Eon {{unveiled}} the new DB10 as the official car for the film. The DB10 was designed in collaboration between Aston Martin and the filmmakers, with only 10 being produced especially for Spectre as {{a celebration of the}} 50th anniversary of the company's association with the franchise. Only eight of those 10 were used for the film, however; the remaining two were used for promotional work. After modifying the Jaguar C-X75 for the film, Williams F1 carried the 007 logo on their <b>cars</b> <b>at</b> the 2015 Mexican Grand Prix, with the team playing host to the cast and crew ahead of the Mexican premiere of the film.|$|E
5|$|Many local-level American racetracks host {{their own}} season championships. In Wisconsin, {{numerous}} locations held dirt and asphalt short track racing. Kulwicki started racing stock <b>cars</b> <b>at</b> {{the local level}} at the Hales Corners Speedway and Cedarburg Speedway dirt oval tracks. In 1973, he won the {{rookie of the year}} award at Hales Corners Speedway in the Milwaukee suburb of Franklin, and the next year started racing late models– the fastest and most complicated type of stock cars raced at the local level– at the same track. That season, he won his first feature race, at Leo's Speedway in Oshkosh.|$|E
5|$|The Blue Line was {{originally}} planned {{to follow a}} slightly different route. The plan would have sent Blue Line trains to Huntington, with Yellow Line trains serving Franconia–Springfield. This was changed due to a shortage of rail <b>cars</b> <b>at</b> {{the time of the}} completion of the line to Huntington. Because fewer rail cars were required to operate Yellow Line service than would be required to run Blue Line service out to Huntington – due to the Yellow Line's shorter route – the line designations were switched. From 1999 to 2008, the Blue Line operated to Huntington on July 4, as part of Metro's special Independence Day service pattern.|$|E

5|$|The FIA {{introduced}} {{more stringent}} {{tests on the}} <b>cars</b> <b>at</b> the Malaysian race to ensure floor mounting systems used by Ferrari and BMW Sauber were not in breach of the regulations. After the first race {{of the season in}} Australia, the McLaren team had requested clarification of the rules regarding systems that allowed the front of the car's undertray to move upwards under aerodynamic loading at high speed. Autosport magazine reported that this movement would potentially increase straight line speed. Massa and Räikkönen said the performance of the Ferrari F2007 car would not be compromised in any way by the required modifications.|$|E
5|$|The Yellow Line was {{originally}} planned {{to follow a}} slightly different route in Virginia.

5|$|The {{character}} of this stage changed drastically after the dramatic injury sustained by Pedro Horrillo the day before brought attention to safety conditions on this and other courses in the Giro. With the course passing over numerous different surfaces, including tram tracks and cobblestones, the peloton collectively protested racing this course, and as such it was neutralized, with everyone receiving {{the same time as}} the stage winner and no points were awarded for the points classification as had been planned. There were also parked <b>cars</b> <b>at</b> the side of the road in many places, forcing the riders into narrow tunnels to get through them.|$|E

5|$|The {{funeral of}} Caoimhín Mac Brádaigh (né Kevin Brady), {{the third and}} last of the Milltown attack victims to be buried, was {{scheduled}} for 19 March. As his cortège proceeded along Andersontown Road, a car being driven by two British Army corporals, David Howes and Derek Wood, entered the street and sped past two teams of stewards, who were attempting to direct traffic out of the procession's path. As the corporals continued along Andersontown Road, they came across the cortège, and mounted the footpath to avoid colliding with it. They continued until blocked by parked <b>cars,</b> <b>at</b> which point they attempted to reverse, but were blocked by vehicles from the cortège and a hostile crowd surrounded their vehicle.|$|E
5|$|At the start, Hamilton, Massa and Kovalainen all {{maintained}} their grid positions. Hamilton quickly {{began to pull}} away from the other <b>cars,</b> <b>at</b> the rate of about half a second per lap. Behind the leading trio, Kubica passed Räikkönen off the grid, and went on to pass both Alonso and Trulli at the hairpin (turn 4), when Alonso's own attempted pass on Trulli delayed both drivers. The fight for fourth position continued {{in the early stages of}} the race. Kubica ran wide at the final corner on lap four, impeding Trulli and therefore allowing Alonso to attempt an overtaking manoeuvre on the Toyota down the main straight. However, Trulli held on to his position, and Alonso was instead passed by Räikkönen, moving him down to sixth position. At the back of the field, Nakajima spun his Williams but recovered back onto the track and continued in the race.|$|E
5|$|Big Hill {{was first}} used for the 1916 Winter Carnival, in which Nelsen set a hill record at 56meters (183ft). He beat his own record several times and kept the hill record until 1921. The tournament was {{gradually}} expanded, and by 1921 it cost $5,800 to arrange. That year, Henry Hall set a world length record in the hill, jumping 70meters (229ft). Three thousand spectators watched the games, in which many of the world's elite skiers competed. To accommodate the extra spectators, Canadian Pacific Railway stationed sleeping <b>cars</b> <b>at</b> Revelstoke to supplement the hotels. In 1922, Isabel Coursier debuted as Big Hill's first women jumper. In 1923, the tournament climaxed with 99 participating ski jumpers. In 1925, while sick with the flu, Nelsen beat Hall's world record by jumping 73meters (240ft). The record would remain until 1930.|$|E
