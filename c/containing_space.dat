40|$|Subjects of {{this paper}} are: (a) {{containing}} spaces constructed in [2] for an indexed collection S of subsets, (b) classes consisting of ordered pairs (Q,X), where Q is a subset of a space X, which are called classes of subsets, and (c) the notion of universality in such classes. We show that if T is a <b>containing</b> <b>space</b> constructed for an indexed collection S of spaces and for every X ϵ S, QX is a subset of X, then the corresponding <b>containing</b> <b>space</b> TIQ constructed for the indexed collection Q ={QX : X ϵ S} of spaces, under a simple condition, {{can be considered as}} a specific subset of T. We prove some “commutative” properties of these specific subsets. For classes of subsets we introduce the notion of a (properly) universal element and define the notion of a (complete) saturated class of subsets. Such a class is “saturated” by (properly) universal elements. We prove that the intersection of (complete) saturated classes of subsets is also a (complete) saturated class. We consider the following classes of subsets: (a) IP(Cl), (b) IP(Op), and (c) IP(n. dense) consisting of all pairs (Q;X) such that: (a) Q is a closed subset of X, (b) Q is an open subset of X, and (c) Q is a never dense subset of X, respectively. We prove that the classes IP(Cl) and IP(Op) are complete saturated and the class IP(n. dense) is saturated. Saturated classes of subsets are convenient to use for the construction of new saturated classes by the given ones...|$|E

40|$|International audienceNon-destructive {{methods for}} {{measuring}} electric charge and polarization in solid dielectric materials {{have been set}} up in recent years. Their common principle is related to the influence charges which appear at the electrodes of a sample <b>containing</b> <b>space</b> charge. When the material is submitted to an external disturbance, the influence charges vary, giving birth to a transient current or voltage signal, from which charge density and electric field distributions across the sample can be calculated. The use of adapted stimuli, which do not alter the electrical state of the sample, allows monitoring the time evolution of the charge. The most employed methods, based on pressure or thermal stimuli, are briefly reviewed in this paper. A thermal technique, namely the Thermal Step Method, is brought in sharper focus. Results obtained on materials and structures for electrical and electronic applications are presented...|$|E

40|$|A {{method for}} the {{analysis}} of thermal-pulse experiments is developed. An approximation for the electric-field distribution is calculated from the thermal-pulse data in a simple way, avoiding mathematical instabilities. The heart of the method is a set of appropriately constructed differential operators. It is shown that the thermal-pulse-response equation is exactly solved by the application of these differential operators. The application of the first-order differential operator suffices to reconstruct to a very good approximation the field distributions within electrets <b>containing</b> <b>space</b> charges or dipoles. The method of analysis is especially suitable for the probing of electric-field distributions near the sample surface. Furthermore, the technique allows an on-line analysis of thermal-pulse data. The merit of the method is demonstrated with measured thermal-pulse data obtained with a negatively corona-charged Teflon polyfluoroethylene propylene sample and with an electron-beam-charged Teflon sample. Additionally, the thermal diffusivity of the electret film is measurable with the thermal-pulse technique if the field distribution within the sample is known...|$|E
