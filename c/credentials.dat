With most <b>credentials</b> battles settled in McKinley's favor, {{the roll of}} delegates drawn up by the RNC heavily favored the Ohioan, though Reed, Allison, Morton and Quay remained in the race. The <b>credentials</b> report served as a test vote, which the McKinley forces won easily. Hanna, who was a delegate from Ohio, was in full control of the convention.|$|E

5|$|The Democratic nominating {{convention}} {{began on}} June 20, at the Music Hall on Market Street in Louisville. The {{first order of}} business was to nominate a convention chairman. Ollie M. James, a supporter of Stone, nominated Judge David Redwine. When Woodson seconded the nomination, the deal between Stone and Goebel became apparent to all. Hardin supporters nominated William H. Sweeney, but the Stone-Goebel alliance elected Redwine. The membership of several county delegations was challenged; these cases would be decided by the <b>credentials</b> committee. This committee was also stacked against Hardin; his supporters made up just four of the thirteen members. Prolonged deliberations by the <b>credentials</b> committee caused the delegates to become restless, and hundreds of people—both delegates and non-delegates—entered the Music Hall attempting to disrupt the convention. When Redwine summoned Louisville city police to the hall to maintain order, Hardin supporters accused him of using intimidation tactics. The <b>credentials</b> committee finally issued its report on June 23. Of the twenty-eight cases where delegates were contested, twenty-six of them were decided in favor of Goebel or Stone supporters.|$|E

Our scheme preserves the properties in <b>credential</b> system: unforgeability and unlinkability.

Transferability of a <b>credential</b> from an organization is retained so that different pseudonyms can be converted into single pseudonym in a t-out-of-n threshold <b>credential...</b>|$|R

While she originally stated she would step down as premier if she {{decided to run for}} the leadership after announcing her candidacy Dunderdale said she will only step down if someone challenges her for the leadership. On January 10, 2011, an hour before nominations were set to close in the leadership election Brad Cabana, a blogger and a former mayor in Saskatchewan, filed his nomination papers becoming Dunderdale's only challenger. The next day however the PC Party's <b>credentials</b> committee announced that Cabana was ineligible to enter the race because he was unable to collect the 50 signatures needed by PC party members to be nominated. Cabana appealed the party's decision but it was announced on January 27, 2011, that the rules committee upheld the previous ruling by the <b>credentials</b> committee. With Cabana being ineligible to run Dunderdale was officially named the leader-designate, she was sworn in as leader at the party's convention on April 2, 2011.|$|E
