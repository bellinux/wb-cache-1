5|$|Nicholas Tucker {{described}} the early Harry Potter books as {{looking back to}} Victorian and Edwardian children's stories: Hogwarts was an old-style boarding school in which the teachers addressed pupils formally by their surnames and were most concerned with the reputations of the houses {{with which they were}} associated; characters' personalities were plainly shown by their appearances, starting with the Dursleys; evil or malicious characters were to be crushed rather than reformed, including Filch's cat Mrs Norris; and the hero, a mistreated orphan who found his true place in life, was charismatic and good at sports, but <b>considerate</b> and protective towards the weak. Several other commentators have stated that the books present a highly stratified society including many social stereotypes. However Karin Westerman drew parallels with 1990s Britain: a class system that was breaking down but defended by those whose power and status it upheld; the multi-ethnic composition of Hogwarts' students; the racial tensions between the various intelligent species; and school bullying.|$|E

These data are compared to check local variations, long term trends, and correlation with mean annual temperature. The ultimate goal of this work is to understand long term climatic changes in this geographic area. The classes of event <b>considerated</b> are hydrogeological phenomena, sun irradiation, seismic, volcanic, meteorological and climatological event. Only event occurred between 1990 and 2014 are <b>considerated.</b> The analysis is performed using a statistical approach. A particular care is used to minimize any effect due to prejudices in case of lack of data. Finally, we calculate the annual average from the monthly ones.
