5|$|Since so {{many new}} sets had to be created, the {{production}} commenced filming with location photography. Four days were spent in the Titan Missile Museum, south of Tucson, Arizona—the disarmed nuclear missile was fitted with a fiberglass <b>capsule</b> <b>shell</b> to stand in for the Phoenixs booster and command module. The old missile silo provided a large set that the budget would have prohibited building from scratch, but the small size created difficulties. Each camera move was planned in advance to work around areas where the lighting would be added, and electricians and grips donned rock-climbing harnesses to move down the shaft and attach the lights. To give greater dimension to the rocket and lend the missile a futuristic appearance, Leonetti chose to offset the missile's metallic surface with complementary colors. Using different-colored gels made the rocket appear longer than it actually was; to complete the effect, shots from the Phoenixs nose downwards and from the engines up were filmed with a 30mm lens to lengthen the missile.|$|E
5000|$|Dosage forms (also {{called unit}} doses) are {{pharmaceutical}} drug {{products in the}} form {{in which they are}} marketed for use, with a specific mixture of active ingredients and inactive components (excipients), in a particular configuration (such as a <b>capsule</b> <b>shell,</b> for example), and apportioned into a particular dose. For example, two products may both be amoxicillin, but one is in 500 mg capsules and another is in 250 mg chewable tablets. The term unit dose can also sometimes encompass non-reusable packaging as well (especially when each drug product is individually packaged), although the FDA distinguishes that by unit-dose [...] "packaging" [...] or [...] "dispensing". Depending on the context, multi(ple) unit dose can refer to distinct drug products packaged together, or to a single drug product containing multiple drugs and/or doses. The term dosage form can also sometimes refer only to the pharmaceutical formulation of a drug product's constituent drug substance(s) and any blends involved, without considering matters beyond that (like how it is ultimately configured as a consumable product such as a capsule, patch, etc.). Because of the somewhat vague boundaries and unclear overlap of these terms and certain variants and qualifiers thereof within the pharmaceutical industry, caution is often advisable when conversing with someone who may be unfamiliar with another person's use of the term.|$|E
40|$|AbstractPharmaceutical {{tests for}} hard shell {{capsules}} {{are designed for}} orally administered capsules. The use of capsules in dry powder inhalers is widespread and increasing and therefore more appropriate tests are required to ensure quality and determine if these capsules are fit for purpose. This study aims to determine the flexibility, reproducibility and sensitivity of a quantitative method {{that is designed to}} evaluate the puncture characteristics of different <b>capsule</b> <b>shell</b> formulations under different climatic conditions. A puncture testing method was used to generate force displacement curves for five capsule formulations that were stored and tested at two different temperatures (5 °C and 19 °C). Force-displacement puncture profiles were reproducible for individual <b>capsule</b> <b>shell</b> formulations. The methodology was able to discriminate between capsules produced using different primary materials i. e. gelatin versus hypromellose, as well as more minor changes to capsule formulation i. e. different material grades and excipients. Reduced temperature increased the forces required for capsule puncture however further work is required to confirm its significance. Results indicate the method provides a reproducible and sensitive means of evaluating capsule puncture. Future studies should validate the methodology at different test sites, using different operators and with different <b>capsule</b> <b>shell</b> formulations...|$|E

In this work, a mathematical model was developed that incorporates both the dissolution of the <b>capsule</b> <b>shell</b> and the slug within the <b>capsule</b> <b>shell.</b> <b>Capsule</b> <b>shell</b> dissolution was modeled with the assumption that the shell undergoes an erosion process only. The capsule slug dissolution model incorporated mass transfer principles, Markov chain theory, and the influence of hydrodynamics on capsules dissolution using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) -predicted velocity profiles. To complete the model, the mass transfer coefficients (determined experimentally and theoretically) were incorporated. The model was validated by statistically comparing the simulated profiles to the experimental data using the similarity factor. In addition, this model can provide insights into the dissolution mechanism where a drug product may either disintegrate or erode during dissolution testing. This capsule slug dissolution model has the potential to reduce substantially the number of time-consuming physical dissolution experiments and maximize the efficiency of process development...|$|E

The purpose of the current work was to determine the potential for interaction between <b>capsule</b> <b>shell</b> material and a green tea extract and the impact it can have on the release. MethodsA green tea extract was formulated into simple powder-in-capsule formulations of which the <b>capsule</b> <b>shell</b> material was either of gelatin or HPMC origin. The disintegration times were determined together with the dissolution profiles in compendial and biorelevant media. ResultsAll formulations disintegrated within 30 [*]min, meeting the USP criteria for botanical formulations. An immediate release dissolution profile was achieved for gelatin capsules in all media but not for the specified HPMC formulations. Dissolution release was especially impaired for HPMCgell at pH 1. 2 and for both HPMC formulations in FeSSIF media suggesting the potential for food interactions. ConclusionsThe delayed release from studied HPMC capsule materials is likely attributed to an interaction between the catechins, the major constituents of the green tea extract, and the <b>capsule</b> <b>shell</b> material. An assessment of in vitro dissolution is recommended prior to the release of a dietary supplement or clinical trial investigational product to ensure efficacy...|$|E

40|$|Microencapsulation is {{the generic}} term for {{numerous}} technologies, {{which are often}} used when the release rate of an active substance in a medium has to be controlled and/or contact between the active substance and the medium has to be prevented. This is achieved by wrapping the tiny particles or droplets of the active substance (capsule core) with a thin layer, or membrane, of another material (<b>capsule</b> <b>shell).</b> The permeability of the membrane determines whether, how fast and under which conditions the active material will be released and/or {{the components of the}} medium will enter the inner part of the capsule. Insofar as application is concerned, premature release of an active substance from microcapsules during storage is a very common problem. Prevention of diffusion of an active component or components of the outer medium through the capsule membrane is a complex challenge, which so far cannot be considered as solved. This review briefly covers the theoretical aspects of release kinetics from microcapsules and discusses how such parameters as capsule average size, <b>capsule</b> <b>shell</b> thickness as well as the chemical composition of active material and medium can influence the release profiles.

The first PIE activities included non-destructive examination of the test train, followed by disassembly of the test train and individual capsules and detailed inspection of the capsule contents, including the fuel compacts and the graphite fuel holders. Dimensional measurements of the compacts, graphite holders, and steel <b>capsules</b> <b>shells</b> were performed using a custom vision measurement system (for outer diameters and lengths) and conventional bore gauges (for inner diameters). Gamma spectrometry of the intact test train gave a preliminary look at {{the condition of the}} interior components. No evidence of damage to compacts or graphite components was evident from the isotopic and gross gamma scans. Neutron radiography of the intact Capsule 2 showed a high degree of detail of interior components and confirmed the observation that there was no major damage to the capsule. Disassembly of the capsules was initiated using procedures qualified during out-of-cell mockup testing. Difficulties were encountered during capsule disassembly due to irradiation-induced changes in some of the capsule components’ properties, including embrittled niobium and molybdenum parts that were susceptible to fracture and swelling of the graphite fuel holders that affected their removal from the <b>capsule</b> <b>shells.</b> This required various improvised modifications to the disassembly procedure to avoid damage to the fuel compacts. Ultimately the capsule disassembly was successful and only one compact from Capsule 4 (out of 72 total in the test train) sustained damage during the disassembly process, along with the associated graphite holder. The compacts were generally in very good condition upon removal. Only relatively minor damage or markings were visible using high resolution photographic inspection. Compact dimensional measurements indicated diametrical shrinkage of 0. 9 to 1. 4 %, and length shrinkage of 0. 2 to 1. 1 %. The shrinkage was somewhat dependent on compact location within each capsule and within the test train.
