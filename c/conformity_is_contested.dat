25|$|The {{first major}} area of social {{influence}} <b>is</b> <b>conformity.</b> <b>Conformity</b> <b>is</b> {{defined as the}} tendency to act or think like other members of a group. The identity of members within a group, i.e. status, similarity, expertise, as well as cohesion, prior commitment, and accountability to the group help to determine the level of conformity of an individual. Individual variation among group members {{plays a key role}} in the dynamic of how willing people will <b>be</b> to conform. <b>Conformity</b> <b>is</b> usually viewed as a negative tendency in American culture, but a certain amount of <b>conformity</b> <b>is</b> adaptive in some situations, as is nonconformity in other situations.|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Informed {{consent for}} {{research}} has emphasized information provision over support to people making a difficult decision. We assessed {{the extent to}} which existing informed consent documents (ICDs) conform to the International Patient Decision Aid Standards for supporting decision making. STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: One hundred thirty-nine ICDs for trials registered with ClinicalTrials. gov were obtained from study investigators. Using a four-point scale, two raters assessed each ICD on 32 items. RESULTS: Overall agreement between raters was 95. 1 % (linear weighted kappa- 0. 745). For 12 items focused on providing enough information, <b>conformity</b> <b>was</b> above 50 % for three, and 0 % for another four. For all eight items focused on how to present outcome probabilities, <b>conformity</b> <b>was</b> below 20 %. For two items focused on clarifying and expressing values, <b>conformity</b> <b>was</b> below 10 %. For two items focused on improving structured guidance, <b>conformity</b> <b>was</b> below 5 %. For four items focused on using evidence, one item showed conformity of 74 %; all others showed conformity below 5 %. For four items focused on transparency, <b>conformity</b> <b>was</b> high (above 60 % for two, above 80 % for the others). CONCLUSIONS: Existing ICDs do not meet most validated standards for encouraging good decision making. These standards make clear predictions about how one might improve ICDs ensure that research participants are fully informed...|$|R

40|$|Abstract <b>Conformity</b> <b>is</b> {{an often}} criticized feature of human belief formation. Although {{generally}} regarded as a negative influence on reliability, {{it has not been}} widely studied. This paper attempts to determine the epistemic effects of conformity by analyzing a mathematical model of this behavior. In addition to investigating the effect of conformity on the reliability of individuals and groups, this paper attempts to determine the optimal structure for <b>conformity.</b> That <b>is,</b> supposing that <b>conformity</b> <b>is</b> inevitable, {{what is the best way}} for conformity effects to occur? The paper finds that in some contexts <b>conformity</b> effects <b>are</b> reliability inducing and, more surprisingly even when it is counterproductive, not all methods for reducing its effect are helpful. These conclusions contribute to a larger discussion in social epistemology regarding the effect of social behavior on individual reliability...|$|R
