30|$|After {{information}} {{of the patient}} or next of kin, patients receiving norepinephrine for shock were allocated to QC or SIP <b>changeovers.</b> QC <b>changeovers</b> were performed by a nurse, who started a new loaded pump when the previous syringe was nearly empty. SIP <b>changeovers</b> were managed automatically by SIP workstations. The primary outcome was the proportion of <b>changeovers</b> followed by a ≥ 20  % drop in mean arterial pressure (MAP).|$|R

5|$|The last {{experimental}} {{flight was}} flown in 1971, {{due to a}} lack of candidate storms and a <b>changeover</b> in NOAA's fleet. More than a decade after the last modification experiment, Project Stormfury was officially canceled. Although a failure in its goal of reducing the destructiveness of hurricanes, Project Stormfury was not without merit. The observational data and storm lifecycle research generated by Stormfury helped improve meteorologists' ability to forecast the movement and intensity of future hurricanes.|$|E
5|$|Brooks then {{won gold}} {{as part of}} the winning 4100m {{freestyle}} relay, anchoring the team of Fasala, Delany and Graeme Brewer to a victory by almost three seconds, putting in a split of 50.56s. The shaven-headed quartet was dubbed the Mean Machine. He collected another gold in the medley relay, combining with David Orbell, Evans and Jon Sieben, this time completing his freestyle anchor leg in 50.44s. Canada had finished the race far ahead of the Australians, but were disqualified for an early <b>changeover.</b> After the games, Brooks completed the American college season before returning to Australia. He was named as Western Australia's Sportsman of the Year.|$|E
5|$|The <b>changeover</b> {{period during}} which the former currencies' notes and coins were {{exchanged}} for those of the euro lasted about two months, from 1 January 2002 until 28 February 2002. The official date on which the national currencies ceased to be legal tender varied from member state to member state. The earliest date was in Germany, where the mark officially ceased to be legal tender on 31 December 2001, though the exchange period lasted for two months after that. Even after the old currencies ceased to be legal tender, they continued {{to be accepted by}} national central banks for ten years or more.|$|E

30|$|We {{expected}} an MAP drop ≥ 20  % {{to occur}} within 15  min after 20  % of QC procedures [7]. To detect a 10  % {{decrease in the}} primary outcome in the SIP group, with α set at 0.05 and 80  % power, 200 <b>changeovers</b> were required in each group. All <b>changeovers</b> in each patient {{were included in the}} study. Patients on norepinephrine therapy usually require about 10 <b>changeovers</b> in all [7]. Therefore, about 40 patients in all (20 per group) were required. Because some patients require fewer than 10 <b>changeovers</b> and missing data may occur for some <b>changeovers</b> (e.g., those performed on an emergency basis), we planned to include 50 patients in all. The number of relays was checked during the enrollment phase of the study. After inclusion of 36 patients (18 in each group), 193 relays were available for analysis in the Quick Change Method compared to only 141 in the Smart Infusion Pump group. At this point, we decided to include all subsequent patients in the Smart Infusion Pump group until the required number of <b>changeovers</b> was reached.|$|R
5|$|As a {{response}} to recent obesity trends in the United States and other nations, Burger King modified its menu and food preparation practices. In addition to offering lower-fat menu item such as salads, the company has updated its nutrition guides to include dietary guidelines and other nutritional data. One of its reactions to the concerns over trans-fats was to initiate a program in January 2008 to phase out added trans-fat in its products, and to switch to pure vegetable oils that are free of hydrogenated fats. The program ended in early 2009 with a complete <b>changeover</b> to the new oils. Most, but not all, of the products contain no added trans-fats; some products, such as the beef used in the hamburgers, still contain naturally occurring trans-fats.|$|E
5|$|Morgan {{was then}} {{overhauled}} and passed by Nancy Simons. With 25 metres left, Morgan took {{her head out}} of the water, and seeing the American a body length in front, dug deep to re-establish a lead of 0.7 of a second going into the final <b>changeover.</b> Crapp then extended the lead over the United States to 2.2 seconds to secure gold in a world record time of 4 minutes 17.1 seconds. The Melbourne Olympics was the only time that Australia has made a clean sweep of the 100-metre freestyle and the relay events for both men and women. This feat has only been equalled by the Americans at the 1920 Summer Olympics. The victory was Australia's only victory in a female swimming relay at the Olympics until the 2004 Summer Olympics.|$|E
5|$|Northcott {{headed the}} BCOF from December 1945 until June 1946. As such, he {{negotiated}} the Northcott-MacArthur agreement with General of the Army Douglas MacArthur, which governed {{the terms and}} conditions under which the BCOF would occupy part of Japan. The BCOF would serve under American command, with American policy being followed. Northcott was offered, and accepted, the post of Governor of New South Wales in April 1946. He remained in Japan until June though, because Prime Minister Ben Chifley wanted the <b>changeover</b> to coincide with his own visit to Japan in May, and because he needed to obtain consent of the other governments concerned for the appointment of Lieutenant General Horace Robertson as Northcott's successor. Northcott's lack of experience in command once again showed, and his command was again overhauled by Robertson.|$|E

5|$|O'Brien {{completed}} a hat-trick of breaststroke doubles at the 1965 Australian Championships, {{but in a}} year with no international competition, he swam much slower times of 1min 11.1s and 2min 38.6s respectively. He {{completed a}} fourth consecutive medley relay win with New South Wales. At the 1966 Australian Championships, his times were again slower, at 1min 11.8s and 2min 41.6s respectively, more than 4% slower than his personal bests, {{but it was still}} enough to retain his titles and qualify for the 1966 British Empire and Commonwealth Games in Kingston, Jamaica. Critics had written him off, because just six weeks before the competition, he was 16kg overweight. However, he returned to his peak form by the time the team reached Jamaica, where he won both breaststroke events with times of 1min 8.2s and 2min 29.3s respectively. His winning run in the 4100m medley relay came to an end when the Australians were disqualified for an illegal <b>changeover.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Australian Swimming Union (ASU) did not {{recognise}} {{times that}} had been recorded in short-course pools in the United States, so Evans was forced to return for the Australian Championships {{to qualify for the}} 1982 Commonwealth Games held in Brisbane. Despite winning neither of the breaststroke events, Evans successfully earned selection and lined up at the Commonwealth Games in the 100m and 200m breaststroke and the 4×100m medley relay. In his favoured 100m event, Evans won bronze, having been led home by Adrian Moorhouse of England and Canada's Victor Davis. In the 200m event, Evans came fourth, almost four seconds behind the victorious Davis. He then combined with David Orbell, Jon Sieben and Brooks to win the medley relay in a Commonwealth Games record time. Canada reached the wall far ahead of Australia, but were disqualified for a premature <b>changeover.</b>|$|E

By multivariate analysis, two factors were independently associated with a significantly decreased risk of ≥ 20  % MAP drops during <b>changeovers,</b> namely, SIP (odds ratio, 0.47; 95  % confidence interval, 0.22 – 0.98) and norepinephrine dosage > 0.5  μg/kg/min (odds ratio, 0.39; 95  % confidence interval, 0.19 – 0.81).|$|R
30|$|Norepinephrine {{is a key}} {{drug for}} {{treating}} shock but has a short half-life that requires continuous intravenous administration to maintain the constant plasma concentration needed to obtain a stable blood pressure. The small volume of the syringes used in power infusion pumps requires frequent <b>changeovers,</b> {{which can lead to}} norepinephrine flow interruptions responsible for hemodynamic instability. <b>Changeovers</b> from the nearly empty to the full syringe can be performed manually using the quick change technique (QC) or automatically using smart infusion pumps (SIP) that link two syringes. The purpose of our study was to evaluate the hypothesis that, compared to QC, SIP for norepinephrine <b>changeovers</b> was associated with less hemodynamic instability.|$|R
5|$|Virgin America {{announced}} in January 2011 a firm order for sixty new Airbus A320 aircraft, including thirty new Airbus A320neos, {{that would be}} delivered starting in 2016, as a formal expansion of an initial commitment made by Richard Branson at the Farnborough Airshow in July 2010. In April 2011, Virgin America's hub at San Francisco International Airport relocated to the newly remodeled Terminal 2, sharing the gates with American Airlines. In late October 2011, the airline migrated to Sabre's global distribution system (GDS) that handles reservations, frequent-flier accounts, flight operations data and crew scheduling. Difficulties with the <b>changeover</b> sparked widespread customer complaints, due to early technical malfunctions surrounding the program. On December 12, 2012, Virgin America opened their first airport lounge, the Virgin America Loft, at Los Angeles International Airport. Virgin America had its first public offering at the NASDAQ stock exchange on November 14, 2014, selling 13.3M shares to raise $307 million for the company.|$|E
5|$|During 1929, most of {{the major}} European filmmaking {{countries}} began joining Hollywood in the <b>changeover</b> to sound. Many of the trend-setting European talkies were shot abroad as production companies leased studios while their own were being converted or as they deliberately targeted markets speaking different languages. One of Europe's first two feature-length dramatic talkies was created in still a different sort of twist on multinational moviemaking: The Crimson Circle was a coproduction between director Friedrich Zelnik's Efzet-Film company and British Sound Film Productions (BSFP). In 1928, the film had been released as the silent Der Rote Kreis in Germany, where it was shot; English dialogue was apparently dubbed in much later using the De Forest Phonofilm process controlled by BSFP's corporate parent. It was given a British trade screening in March 1929, as was a part-talking film made entirely in the UK: The Clue of the New Pin, a British Lion production using the sound-on-disc British Photophone system. In May, Black Waters, a British and Dominions Film Corporation promoted as the first UK all-talker, received its initial trade screening; it had been shot completely in Hollywood with a Western Electric sound-on-film system. None of these pictures made much impact.|$|E
5|$|During the 1920s and 1930s, Japan {{was one of}} the world's {{two largest}} {{producers}} of motion pictures, along with the United States. Though the country's film industry {{was among the first to}} produce both sound and talking features, the full <b>changeover</b> to sound proceeded much more slowly than in the West. It appears that the first Japanese sound film, Reimai (Dawn), was made in 1926 with the De Forest Phonofilm system. Using the sound-on-disc Minatoki system, the leading Nikkatsu studio produced a pair of talkies in 1929: Taii no musume (The Captain's Daughter) and Furusato (Hometown), the latter directed by Kenji Mizoguchi. The rival Shochiku studio began the successful production of sound-on-film talkies in 1931 using a variable-density process called Tsuchibashi. Two years later, however, more than 80 percent of movies made in the country were still silents. Two of the country's leading directors, Mikio Naruse and Yasujirō Ozu, did not make their first sound films until 1935 and 1936, respectively. As late as 1938, over a third of all movies produced in Japan were shot without dialogue.|$|E

50|$|The {{size of the}} reels {{can vary}} based on the projectors, but {{generally}} films are divided and distributed in reels of up to 2000 feet (610 m, about 22 minutes at 24 frames/sec). Some projectors can even accommodate up to 6000 feet (1,830 m), which minimizes the number of <b>changeovers</b> (see below) in a showing. Certain countries also divide their film reels up differently; Russian films, for example, often come on 1000-foot (305 m) reels, although it's likely that most projectionists working with <b>changeovers</b> would combine them into longer reels of at least 2000 feet (610 m), to minimize <b>changeovers</b> and also give sufficient time for threading and any possibly needed troubleshooting time.|$|R
5|$|Female {{macaroni}} penguins {{can begin}} breeding at around {{five years of}} age, while the males do not normally breed until at least six years old. Females breed {{at a younger age}} because the male population is larger. The surplus of male penguins allows the female penguins to select more experienced male partners as soon as the females are physically able to breed. Commencing a few days after females arrive at the colony, sexual displays are used by males to attract partners and advertise their territory, and by pairs once together at the nest site and at <b>changeover</b> of incubation shifts. In the 'ecstatic display', a penguin bows forward, making loud throbbing sounds, and then extends its head and neck up until its neck and beak are vertical. The bird then waves its head from side to side, braying loudly. Birds also engage in mutual bowing, trumpeting, and preening. Monitoring of pair fidelity at South Georgia has shown around three-quarters of pairs will breed together again the following year.|$|E
5|$|The Australian {{team made}} a poor {{start in the}} final after Fraser almost stopped during the first leg, believing that a false start had {{occurred}} after mistakenly hearing a second gunshot. She finished her leg in 1 minute 4.0 seconds, almost two seconds slower than her personal best, but enough for a 2.3-second lead over the United States' Sylvia Ruuska. Swimming the second leg, Leech maintained {{the lead in the}} first 50 metres but faded in the second half and finished with a split of 1 minute 5.1 seconds; the Australian lead was thus cut to 0.9 s. Morgan dived in for the third leg and was then overhauled and passed by American Nancy Simons. With 25 metres left, Morgan took her head out of the water—a fundamental error—and seeing the American a body length in front, responded with a surge to regain a 0.7-second lead heading into the final <b>changeover.</b> Crapp then extended the margin to 2.2 seconds to secure an Australian victory in a world-record time of 4 minutes 17.1 seconds. The victory {{was the first time that}} Australia had swept the 100-metre freestyle relay and individual events for both men and women. The only other time that this has been achieved was by the Americans in 1920 in Antwerp. The win would be Australia's only triumph in a female swimming relay at the Olympics until the 2004 Games in Athens. The victory made Morgan Australia's youngest-ever gold medallist; this record still stands.|$|E
