30|$|Model {{parameters}} determined through informal {{interviews were}} as follows: small stock reproduction parameters, milk production levels {{and the value}} of milk. The value of milk was converted from Kenya shillings to US dollars. This information was collected from 30 livestock and 10 women milk traders selected purposively across the study area. Milk production and losses were estimated as described by Barasa et al. (2008), by asking the milking person to show her milking container and mark the level of milk produced by healthy goat and sheep. Water was filled to the marked level shown and then measured by a <b>calibrated</b> <b>container.</b> The milking women were then asked to show and mark the level of milk produced by goat and sheep which were sick with PPR. Water was again filled in the container to level of production of the sick animal and measured with a <b>calibrated</b> <b>container.</b>|$|E
40|$|Accurate {{estimation}} of blood loss {{is central to}} prompt diagnosis and management of post-partum hemorrhage (PPH), which remains {{a leading cause of}} maternal mortality in low-resource countries. In such settings, blood loss is often estimated visually and subjectively by attending health workers, due to inconsistent availability of laboratory infrastructure. We evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of weighed blood loss (WBL) versus changes in peri-partum hemoglobin to detect PPH. Data from this analysis were collected as part of a randomized controlled trial comparing oxytocin with misoprostol for PPH (NCT 01866241). Blood samples for complete blood count were drawn on admission and again prior to hospital discharge or before blood transfusion. During delivery, women were placed on drapes and had pre-weighed sanitary towels placed around their perineum. Blood was then drained into a <b>calibrated</b> <b>container</b> and the sanitary towels were added to estimate WBL, where each gram of blood was estimated as a milliliter. Sensitivity, specificity, negative and positive predictive values (PPVs) were calculated at various blood volume loss and time combinations, and we fit receiver-operator curves using blood loss at 1, 2, and 24 hours compared to a reference standard of haemoglobin decrease of > 10 %. A total of 1, 140 women were enrolled in the study, of whom 258 (22. 6 %) developed PPH, defined as a haemoglobin drop > 10 %, and 262 (23. 0 %) had WBL ≥ 500 mL. WBL generally had a poor sensitivity for detection of PPH (85 %) in high prevalence settings when WBL exceeds 750 mL. WBL has poor sensitivity but high specificity compared to laboratory-based methods of PPH diagnosis. These characteristics correspond to a high PPV in areas with high PPH prevalence. Although WBL is not useful for excluding PPH, this low-cost, simple and reproducible method is promising as a reasonable method to identify significant PPH in such settings where quantifiable red cell indices are unavailable...|$|E
30|$|In total, ten pore volumes {{were applied}} to each column— 1 PV per day. The {{displacement}} of the saline solution was vertical and downward. The collection of the column effluents started {{with the beginning of}} drainage, splitting each PV into three equal aliquots using <b>calibrated</b> <b>containers.</b> The aliquots were filtered through a 0.45 -μm membrane. The concentration of P was determined according to Murphy and Riley (1962). Once the leaching stopped, the columns with the soil were dried in an oven at 50  °C and sliced evenly into 5 -cm sections. The soil of each section was crushed, homogenized, and sieved through a 2 -mm mesh. Finally, WEP values were obtained.|$|R

40|$|Constant {{water tables}} (CWT) in pots {{have been used}} in the {{determination}} of plant water-use. While the CWT systems eliminate the labour required in watering-to-weight systems, they may be overly wet with the constant water table within the pot itself. A valve in our Pot-In-Bucket (PIB) system maintains the water table at a nominated constant height above, within or below the contents of each test pot. In the latter configuration, the CWT supplies water to an upper ANOVApot® through a capillary tape draped over an upturned pot within the bucket which encloses the valve and supports the upper ANOVApot®. This valve is connected to a remotely located 5 L container of water via a medical infusion set. Water-use by a plant/s growing in the ANOVApot® is monitored as changes in water level in the <b>calibrated</b> 5 L <b>container.</b> Real time (2 - 20 minute delay) variation in rate of water-use from plants can be observed (as drips (0. 066 mL) per second) in the sight glass of the infusion set. Having groups of containers located remotely from the pots they supply, greatly facilitates the ease and speed of the refilling operation and drip rate measurements. Changes in pot weight provide a measure of whole plant biomass and when coupled with water-use enables the non-destructive measurement of water-use efficiency during the crop’s lifecycle. This system has worked well in water-use experiments in wheat and rice...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} role of water in urban {{landscape}} architectural design and identifies strategies that will conserve and optimise the use {{of water in the}} built environment. This is done through selecting a site in Pretoria at the intersection of the Apies River channel and Nelson Mandela drive and designing an Urban Water Centre that explores; exposes and celebrates water in the urban context. The design creates opportunities for kids from nearby schools, students from TUT, residents from the area, pedestrians and tourists to interact on a physical and emotional level with water. Educating people about water conservation is an important aspect of the project and raising awareness is the first step. The design addresses the city-wide need for green public open space and provides opportunities for urbanites to connect with water and the Apies River. This connection is established through the facilitation of significant encounters with water. These include physical contact play with water, creating interest and anticipation around rain events and through translating some of the associated attributes of water into a solid surface. The design approach is influenced by studying the Sustainable Sites Initiative’s ecosystem service approach. Green Star SA is investigated for a possible application to landscape architecture. The findings from the Sustainable Sites Initiative are enhanced by General Systems Theory and then used to generate systems that supports the desired experiences. The first and largest system lifts some of the base flow from the Apies River channel with a waterwheel, where after it is purified in a constructed wetland and a chlorine-free disinfecting process. The clean water is then displayed in a play pond that partially drains through a gravity driven vortex generator. The vortex generator aerates and cools down the water while adding movement; sound and a sense of the passage of time to the human experience. From the vortex, water flows into a constructed pebble lined stream that children can play in and experience stream ecology. The pebbles and vegetation refers back to the Apies River before it was lined with concrete. From the stream the water rejoins the channel. The second on site water system addresses rainwater. The design creates anticipation and curiosity associated with rain events. Rainwater from one of the on site buildings are harvested and displayed in a rain-meter garden. A first-flush system intercepts the first dirty water where after it drizzles down a rain-curtain into a rain-meter system. The rain-meters are large bullet resistant glass tank-like <b>containers,</b> <b>calibrated</b> to show how many millimetres of rain have fallen during the shower. A rain-sensor drains the water into a temporary wetland and lets in percolate into the underground storage tank. The third on site water system treats grey water from buildings through a stepped constructed wetland and displays the cleaned water in a jubilant motion activated display at one of the pedestrian entrances. Water from the rain-meter system; the grey water system and harvested surface runoff all contributes towards meeting the water needs of irrigation and buildings. Other eco-system service strategies identified in the study are applied in the design. These include the protection of on site biomass along with the introduction of region appropriate planting; design for- and use of waste reducing materials and the integration of on site systems to enrich the experience.
