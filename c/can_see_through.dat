5|$|Back on the ship, the Doctor and {{his companions}} find several {{additional}} time windows and learn that each leads to a different moment in Madame de Pompadour's life. In one of them, the Doctor sees another clockwork creature menacing her and steps through the window to defend her. The Doctor tells Reinette to give the android orders, and it obeys her. It tells her {{that it is a}} repair android and that their spaceship was damaged in an ion storm. The androids did not have the parts necessary to repair the ship and killed the crew to use their organs for parts. The androids need one last part; Reinette's brain. Confused, the Doctor creates a telepathic link with Reinette, but is startled to find that she can also see into his mind. The androids capture Rose and Mickey and are about to harvest them for parts when the Doctor rescues them. The Doctor discovers that the androids plan to open a time window to Reinette's life at the age of 37, believing that her brain at that age will be compatible with the ship's systems. The clockwork androids appear at a costume ball and take Reinette and her guests hostage. At one end of the room is an enormous mirror, which is actually a time window. The Doctor {{and his companions}} <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>through</b> it, but they cannot enter without smashing the window and breaking the connection as the androids locked it after the Doctor's previous interruptions.|$|E
500|$|The {{nostrils}} are not {{divided by}} a septum, but rather are perforate; {{from the side}} one <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>through</b> the beak. The wings are broad but relatively short. The bases of the primary feathers are white, producing a white patch {{on the underside of}} the wing's edge, which is visible in flight. The tail is short and square, barely reaching past the edge of the folded wings. The subspecies differ in size according to Bergmann's Rule, and the amount of white underwing coloration also varies.|$|E
500|$|A common {{criticism}} amongst many reviewers {{was that}} in spite of its title, no connection is made between Fermat's Last Theorem and the alien invasion. Alex Kasman at Mathematical Fiction complained about errors in some of the author's descriptions of the mathematical problems, and in particular their unfair treatment of Wiles's proof of Fermat's Last Theorem. Some reviewers felt that the characters had not been developed sufficiently. Michael Sims of The Washington Post said that [...] "these characters are so thin you <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>through</b> them." [...] The aliens are depicted as cartoon-like figures, and Ranjit {{does not appear to be}} affected by his lengthy incarceration, interrogation and torture. Some critics also felt that the book ended [...] "somewhat precipitously", that after the aliens arrived, the crisis was resolved too quickly, giving the impression [...] "that there was at least a good, long chapter missing." ...|$|E

Rosa's influence <b>can</b> be <b>seen</b> <b>through</b> dark landscapes and elements of the Gothic.|$|R
2500|$|In 2015, two of {{his films}} were premiered at 65th Berlin International Film Festival in February. First he {{appeared}} in Werner Herzog's adaptation of Gertrude Bell's biopic film Queen of the Desert alongside Nicole Kidman and James Franco. Pattinson appeared as T. E. Lawrence aka Lawrence Of Arabia in the film, which Geoffrey Macnab of The Independent described as [...] "comic and {{a very long way}} removed from Peter O'Toole. He plays Lawrence Of Arabia as a sharp-tongued, sardonic figure who <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>through</b> the pretensions of his bosses and colleagues." [...] David Rooney of The Hollywood Reporter called his role [...] "brief but significant" [...] and concluded that [...] "the easy camaraderie in his scenes with Kidman is appealing." [...] Sam Adams of Indiewire said that, [...] "Robert Pattinson gets relatively high marks for his brief turn as the bonafide T.E. Lawrence." ...|$|E
2500|$|Slug also dislikes some of {{the songs}} that he wrote before and does not perform them live, such as [...] "Vampires" [...] from 2002 album God Loves Ugly. Daley has stated, [...] "when I did get my phase of trying to figure myself out, {{there was a lot}} of tug-of-war inside of me between wanting to hate a {{particular}} woman and then feeling guilty about that. And there’s certain songs that I won’t perform anymore, because the game of tug-of-war is over and I know where I’m at". Furthermore, Slug has criticized Atmosphere's first album Overcast!, saying: [...] "It's obvious that I’m trying so fucking hard on Overcast and you <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>through</b> it and tell it's not a person it's more of an attempt at trying to fill the niche, it was like I was trying to prove to myself that I was a rapper." ...|$|E
2500|$|Murray {{writes in}} his article, {{through the use of}} Richard Lanham’s The Electronic World: Democracy, Technology, and the Arts, how “discursive text is in the center of {{everything}} we do," [...] going on to say how students coexist in a world that “includes blogs, podcasts, modular community web spaces, cell phone messaging…”, urging for students to be taught how to compose through rhetorical minds in these new, and not-so-new texts. “Cultural changes, and Lanham suggests, refocuses writing theory towards the image”, demonstrating how there is a change in alphabet-to-icon ratios in electronic writing. One of these prime examples <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>through</b> the Apple product, the iPhone, in which “emojis” are seen as icons in a separate keyboard to convey what words would have once delivered. Another example is Prezi. Often likened to Microsoft PowerPoint, Prezi is a cloud-based presentation application that allows users to create text, embed video, and make visually aesthetic projects. Prezi’s presentations zoom the eye in, out, up and down to create a multi-dimensional appeal. Users also utilize different media within this medium that is itself unique.|$|E

2500|$|Nomura did {{not want}} Noctis to have a {{personality}} like Squall Leonhart or Cloud Strife, the respective protagonists of Final Fantasy VIII and VII, defining their personality type as that of [...] "a silent, gloomy little boy". Instead, Nomura {{wanted to create a}} realistic character type not seen in the Final Fantasy series before. Because of this, he was wary about him as he was so new to the series that he might fall [...] "out of bounds". Whereas previous protagonists did not have strong personalities to avoid interfering with player empathy, Nomura wanted Noctis to have [...] "an overabundance of idiosyncrasy", {{which was one of the}} ways he would leave an impression on the player. Nomura also wanted the character to have traits and perform actions that bore both heroic and villainous traits, creating someone akin to an anti-hero. He thought that these qualities would match the game's themes very well. While naturally shy, Noctis hides this under a cold exterior, though his close friends <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>through</b> this. A key scene that demonstrated his personality in Versus XIII was his first meeting with Stella Nox Fleuret, the original heroine of Final Fantasy Versus XIII.|$|E
