5000|$|A {{cafeteria}} tray is {{used for}} carrying items in a cafeteria. It is typically made of plastic or fiberglass. A <b>compartment</b> <b>tray</b> or mess tray is a cafeteria tray designed to be used directly, without dishes - it incorporates shallow compartments in which different types of food are placed.|$|E
5000|$|Abigail (Abbey) M. Fleck is an American {{inventor}} from St. Paul, Minnesota, {{noted for}} her 1993 invention, Makin' Bacon, a microwavable bacon cooking plate. The device, which she created {{at the age}} of 8, is an inch-deep, dual <b>compartment</b> <b>tray</b> made of microwave-safe plastic, containing three T-shaped beams protruding up from the center. Abbey and her father Jonathan Fleck founded the A. de F. Ltd. company to manufacture the product, and in 1996 their [...] "microwave cooking vessel" [...] was granted a U.S. Patent. Following a successful endorsement from Armour, Fleck embarked on promotional tour of her product, which included appearances on The Oprah Winfrey Show, Late Night with David Letterman, and two features on Dateline NBC.|$|E
50|$|Saratoga trunks {{were the}} premium trunks of many makers (or the {{exclusive}} design of many premium trunk makers) and actually can encompass nearly every other style of trunk manufactured if loosely defined, although generally they {{are limited to}} before the 1880s. The most readily recognizable feature of Saratogas are their myriad (and generally very complex) <b>compartments,</b> <b>trays,</b> and heavy duty hardware.|$|R

5000|$|Cabin trunks, {{which are}} {{sometimes}} called [...] "true" [...] steamer trunks, were today's equivalent of carry-on luggage. They were low-profiled and {{small enough to}} fit under the berths of trains or in the cabin of a steamer, hence their name. Most were built with flat-tops and had inner <b>tray</b> <b>compartments</b> to store the owner's valuables deemed too precious to keep stowed away in the main luggage train or berth.|$|R
50|$|Home theater seating {{consists}} of chairs or sofas specifically engineered and designed for viewing movies {{in a home}} theater. Some home theater seats have a cup holder built into the chairs' armrests and a shared armrest between each seat. Some seating has movie-theater-style chairs like those seen in a movie cinema, which feature a flip-up seat cushion. Other seating systems have plush leather reclining lounger types, with flip-out footrests. Available features include storage <b>compartments,</b> snack <b>trays,</b> tactile transducers for low-frequency effects that can be felt through a chair (without creating high volume levels which could disturb other family members), and electric motors to adjust the chair. Home theater seating {{tends to be more}} comfortable than seats in a public cinema.|$|R
2500|$|Several smaller {{companies}} had conceived of frozen dinners earlier (see Invention section below), {{but the first}} to achieve success was Swanson. The first Swanson-brand TV Dinner was produced in the United States and consisted of a Thanksgiving meal of turkey, cornbread dressing, frozen peas and sweet potatoes packaged in a tray like those used at the time for airline food service. Each item was placed in its own <b>compartment.</b> The <b>trays</b> proved to be useful: the entire dinner could {{be removed from the}} outer packaging as a unit; the aluminum tray could be heated directly in the oven without any extra dishes; and one could eat the meal directly from the same tray. The product was cooked for 25 minutes at [...] and fit nicely on a TV tray table. The original TV Dinner sold for 98 cents, and had a production estimate of 5,000 dinners for the first year.|$|R
25|$|The {{production}} process of TV dinners is highly automated and undergoes three major steps. Those steps are food preparation, tray loading, and freezing. During food preparation, {{vegetables and fruits}} are usually placed on a movable belt and washed, then are placed into a container to be steamed or boiled for 1â€“3 minutes. This process {{is referred to as}} blanching, and is used as a method to destroy enzymes in the food that can cause chemical changes negatively affecting overall flavor and color of the fruit and vegetables. As for meats, prior to cooking, they are trimmed of fat and cut into proper sizes. The fish is usually cleaned and cut into fillets, and poultry is usually washed thoroughly and dressed. Meats are then seasoned, placed on trays, and are cooked in an oven for a predetermined amount of time. After all the food is ready to be packaged, it is sent to the filling lines. The food is placed in its <b>compartments</b> as the <b>trays</b> pass under numerous filling machines; to ensure that every packaged dinner gets an equal amount of food, the filling devices are strictly regulated.|$|R
40|$|A robust {{nonlinear}} {{control law}} {{is designed to}} reject unknown feed composition disturbances with overall stability. Implementation to real columns as well as comparisons with classical control strategies, show the robustness and flexibility improvements of the method. Key Words [...] Control applications; distillation columns; disturbance rejection; model reduction; nonlinear control systems; overall stability; quality control; singular perturbations. Almtracq [...] Using singular perturbation techniques on a physical model of distillation column, an aggregated model is proposed for control purposes. Nonlinear perturbation rejection techniques via static feedback are then applied to this model to reject the feed composition disturbances: around every slowly varying reference trajectory, {{the existence of such}} a control aw and the stability of the overall closed-loop system are proven. Moreover, the obtained control aw can be synthesized with measurements commonly available on distillation columns: the product compositions and two inner temperatures. An industrial implementation on a refinery depropanizer of 42 trays is presented. Simulation comparisons with linear and nonlinear geometric control laws, both using the physical model of high dimension, show the robustness and flexibility improvements provided by our method.
