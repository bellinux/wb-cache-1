50|$|There are {{a number}} of {{differences}} between structural metal and fiber-reinforced composites. For example, metals in general exhibit yielding and plastic deformation, whereas most fiber-reinforced composites are elastic in their tensile stress-strain characteristics. However, the dissimilar nature of these materials provides mechanisms for high-energy absorption on a microscopic scale comparable to the yielding process. Depending on the type and severity of external loads, a <b>composite</b> <b>laminate</b> may exhibit gradual deterioration in properties but usually does not fail in a catastrophic manner. Mechanisms of damage development and growth in metal and composite structure are also quite different.

40|$|ABSTRACT: This paper {{investigates the}} {{responses}} of glass/epoxy <b>composite</b> <b>laminates</b> subjected to impact loading. It presents a new technique to characterize the impact properties and to correlate them with the damage process of the <b>composite</b> <b>laminates.</b> The technique, called the energy profiling technique, is based on instrumented impact tests and the least-squares method. The technique gives specific definitions of the penetration and perforation thresholds of the <b>composite</b> <b>laminates.</b> It also defines {{the range of the}} penetration process and quantifies the energy absorption efficiency of the <b>composite</b> <b>laminates.</b> The primary damage modes in the damage process of the <b>composite</b> <b>laminates</b> can also be correlated with the impact properties by using the energy profiling technique. The advantages of using this technique to analyze the experimental data obtained from impact tests are demonstrated by investigating the glass/epoxy <b>composite</b> <b>laminates</b> with various impactor sizes, laminate thicknesses, fiber orientations, and a sandwich construction. Results from the energy profiling technique show that the penetration and perforation thresholds increase nearly linearly with the size of the impactor while they increase nonlinearly with the thickness. A sandwich composite made of two glass/epoxy laminates and a foam material is found to have higher energy absorption efficiency than a bonded laminate.

5000|$|Going into 2002, LGarde was {{developing}} polyurethane resins for a 3-ply <b>composite</b> <b>laminate</b> {{that could be}} used in the fabrication of rigidizable structures suitable for use in space. [...] In a paper submitted to the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics (AIAA), engineers found that such composites can be used to fabricate ultra-lightweight deployable rigidizable structures for space applications and that polyurethane was chosen because it could become rigid when exposed to the low temperatures of space. The paper goes on to observe that under NASA's SSP program (Space Solar Power Truss), a 24-foot long inflatable-rigidizable truss using polyurethane composites withstood a compression load of 556 pounds, 10% above its designed compression strength while reducing mass of comparable mechanical structures by a factor of 4.It had been long theorized that solar sails could reflect photons streaming from the sun and convert some of the energy into thrust. The resulting thrust, though small, is continuous and acts for the life of the mission without the need for propellant. In 2003, LGarde, together with partners JPL, Ball Aerospace, and Langley Research Center, under the direction of NASA, developed a solar sail configuration that utilized inflatable rigidized boom components to achieve 10,000 m2 sailcraft with a real density of 14.1 g/m2 and potential acceleration of 0.58 mm/s2. The entire configuration released by the upper stage has a mass of 232.9 kg and required just 1.7 m3 of volume in the booster.
