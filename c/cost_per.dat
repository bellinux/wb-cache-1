40|$|STUDY OBJECTIVES: To {{calculate}} cost-effectiveness of scenarios concerning lung transplantation in The Netherlands. DESIGN: Microsimulation model predicting survival, {{quality of}} life, and costs {{with and without}} transplantation program, based on data of the Dutch lung transplantation program of 1990 to 1995. SETTING: Netherlands, University Hospital Groningen. PATIENTS: Included were 425 patients referred for lung transplantation, of whom 57 underwent transplantation. INTERVENTION: Lung transplantation. RESULTS: For the baseline scenario, the <b>costs</b> <b>per</b> life-year gained are G 194, 000 (G=Netherlands guilders) and the <b>costs</b> <b>per</b> quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained are G 167, 000. Restricting patient inflow ("policy scenario") lowers the <b>costs</b> <b>per</b> life-year gained: G 172, 000 (<b>costs</b> <b>per</b> QALY gained: G 144, 000). The supply of more donor lungs could reduce the <b>costs</b> <b>per</b> life-year gained to G 159, 000 (G 135, 000 per QALY gained; G 1 =US 0. 6, based on exchange rate {{at the time of}} the study). CONCLUSIONS: Lung transplantation is an expensive but effective intervention: survival and quality of life improve substantially after transplantation. The <b>costs</b> <b>per</b> life-year gained are relatively high, compared with other interventions and other types of transplantation. Restricting the patient inflow and/or raising donor supply improves cost-effectiveness to some degree. Limiting the extent of inpatient screening or lower future costs of immunosuppressives may slightly improve the cost-effectiveness of the program...|$|R

40|$|As {{state governments}} shrink their budgets, more {{school districts are}} debating consolidation. In {{considering}} school consolidation, governments must evaluate <b>costs</b> <b>per</b> pupil and student achievement. Factors associated with <b>costs</b> <b>per</b> pupil include schools per district, district enrollment, income per individual, percent of pupils eligible for free lunch, pupil-teacher ratio, and average teacher salary. Factors associated with achievement include school enrollment, percent of pupils eligible for free lunch, suspension/expulsion rates, pupil-teacher ratio, and average teacher salary. This paper presents a regression model that analyzes the effects of school enrollment and schools <b>per</b> district on <b>costs</b> <b>per</b> pupil and standardized test passing rates in Indiana elementary and secondary schools.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an application of}} the Bayesian inference to estimate health care expenses by health insurance companies in the Czech Republic and Slovakia. In particular, the Buhlmann-Straub model is applied onto real data, covering time period 2010 - 2015, from all seven Czech and three Slovakian health insurance companies in order to calculate the credible health care <b>costs</b> <b>per</b> person and the corresponding credibility factors for each company. Computed credible health care <b>costs</b> <b>per</b> person are compared with the real estimations of health care <b>costs</b> <b>per</b> person quoted by analyzed health insurance companies. These real estimates are not available for all the Slovakian health insurance companies and two Czech health insurance companies. The results of Buhlmann-Straub model show that while the largest insurance companies can reliably predict the health care costs for the subsequent time period based on its own statistical data, the smaller companies can find out credible estimation of health care <b>costs</b> <b>per</b> person, taking into account data from all comparable healthcare insurance companies...|$|R

5|$|The casting {{equipment}} and the metal dies represent large capital costs and this tends to limit the process to high-volume production. Manufacture of parts using die casting is relatively simple, involving only four main steps, which keeps the incremental <b>cost</b> <b>per</b> item low. It is especially suited for a large quantity of small- to medium-sized castings, which is why die casting produces more castings than any other casting process. Die castings are characterized by a very good surface finish (by casting standards) and dimensional consistency.|$|E
5|$|A British Wind Energy Association report {{gives an}} average {{generation}} cost of onshore wind power of around 3.2 pence (between US 5 and 6 cents) per kW·h (2005). <b>Cost</b> <b>per</b> {{unit of energy}} produced was estimated in 2006 to be 5 to 6 percent above the cost of new generating capacity in the US for coal and natural gas: wind cost was estimated at $55.80 per MW·h, coal at $53.10/MW·h and natural gas at $52.50. Similar comparative results with natural gas were obtained in a governmental study in the UK in 2011. In 2011 power from wind turbines could be already cheaper than fossil or nuclear plants; {{it is also expected}} that wind power will be the cheapest form of energy generation in the future. The presence of wind energy, even when subsidised, can reduce costs for consumers (€5 billion/yr in Germany) by reducing the marginal price, by minimising the use of expensive peaking power plants.|$|E

The company was still going into debt and having a difficult time paying for the miners' benefits. To avoid losing more money, Pittston doubled health deductibles, lowered the coverage from 100% to 80%, and discontinued benefits to miners who retired before 1974. This change {{in the health care}} plan was still not enough for the company to gain a profit, so they decided to keep the mines running 24hours a day and seven days a week, with no overtime for the workers. Pittston also did away with successorship clauses, which meant that the miners of Pittston would not have job security or transfer of job rights in mines that were leased or sold. Miners were now working longer hours with more expensive health care plans, while the mine was losing no production time because it was never closed.|$|E
5|$|Integer sorting {{algorithms}} {{are usually}} {{designed to work}} in either the pointer machine or random access machine models of computing. The main {{difference between these two}} models is in how memory may be addressed. The random access machine allows any value that is stored in a register to be used as the address of memory read and write operations, with unit <b>cost</b> <b>per</b> operation. This ability allows certain complex operations on data to be implemented quickly using table lookups. In contrast, in the pointer machine model, read and write operations use addresses stored in pointers, and it is not allowed to perform arithmetic operations on these pointers. In both models, data values may be added, and bitwise Boolean operations and binary shift operations may typically also be performed on them, in unit time per operation. Different integer sorting algorithms make different assumptions, however, about whether integer multiplication is also allowed as a unit-time operation. Other more specialized models of computation such as the parallel random access machine have also been considered.|$|E
5|$|Methods used {{to prevent}} malaria include medications, {{mosquito}} elimination and the prevention of bites. There is no vaccine for malaria. The presence of malaria in an area requires a combination of high human population density, high anopheles mosquito population density and high rates of transmission from humans to mosquitoes and from mosquitoes to humans. If any of these is lowered sufficiently, the parasite will eventually disappear from that area, as happened in North America, Europe {{and parts of the}} Middle East. However, unless the parasite is eliminated from the whole world, it could become re-established if conditions revert to a combination that favors the parasite's reproduction. Furthermore, the <b>cost</b> <b>per</b> person of eliminating anopheles mosquitoes rises with decreasing population density, making it economically unfeasible in some areas.|$|E
