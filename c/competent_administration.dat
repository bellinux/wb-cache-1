The village was considered key to opening {{the north of the}} province and linking Ba Ria to Xuan Loc in Long Khanh, yet it was dominated by the Viet Cong, and with a population of 2,100 the operation would be complex. 5 RAR sealed off Binh Ba before first light on 9 August, supported by two companies from 6 RAR, as well as APCs, engineers and artillery. Accompanied by South Vietnamese police, they methodically searched the area while the inhabitants were provided with food and medical aid, followed by further searches of Duc My and Duc Trung. By 10 August Binh Ba and its approaches had been cleared and the Australians commenced searching the areas east and west of Route 2. Although little contact occurred, one Australian was killed on 14 August during a brief fire-fight after a group of Viet Cong approached their harbour. Route 2 was opened to civilian traffic on 18 August. By the conclusion of the operation 17 Viet Cong had been apprehended and a further 77 suspects detained, destroying the Binh Ba guerrilla platoon, crippling the infrastructure of the insurgency and bringing the village under government influence, with an ARVN commando company later stationed there to maintain control. Achieved at little cost, it was believed a significant success.

40|$|Simple {{neoliberal}} approaches {{ignore the}} importance and power {{that the state has}} in making decentralization effective. This is shown through a critical analysis of local economic development in which evidence, from three projects in a second-rank Turkish industrial centre, Kayseri, was used. Turkey’s recent moves from highly centralized systems of governance to neoliberal policies of economic devolution reveal a poor understanding of how the roles of state and its institutions operate. The findings illustrate that the control of narrow political interests distorts local priorities and projects, and many civil society groups remain ineffective in the face of local initiatives. The author concludes that decentralization without <b>competent</b> state <b>administration</b> is likely to aggravate social fracturing and to foster inequalities while, at the same time, failing to ameliorate public service and economic development. ...|$|R

At the same time, the slow but steady reforms of the restricted trade policies in the Spanish Empire encouraged the establishment of new trade houses and private projects.

Morton's pursuit of credit for and profit from the administration of ether was complicated by the furtive and sometimes deceptive tactics he employed during its development, as well as the competing claims of other doctors, most notably his former mentor, Dr. Jackson. Morton's own efforts to obtain patents overseas also undermined his assertions of philanthropic intent. Consequently, no effort was made to enforce the patent, and ether soon came into general use.|$|E

40|$|Human {{intervention}} {{on the coast}} has been intense, due {{to the source of}} wealth that the coastal areas represent, especially in the form of tourism, which has resulted in a rapid erosion of its beaches. This paper discusses the current state of beach management in the various <b>competent</b> public <b>administrations</b> on the Costa Blanca (SE Spanish-Mediterranean), in relation to urban development and regression on the waterfront. To this end, an analysis has been carried out of the responses to a survey of those responsible for managing each of the 19 coastal municipalities of the Alicante coast, covering 244 km of coastline, 91 beaches and their personnel. Also, an investigation has been conducted as to whether this management’s aim is to protect the coastline and maintain the flora and fauna or just to manage recreation as the main economic activity is tourism. The analysis shows that the beach is simply regarded as a product or service offered to the user thereof. However, local authorities have not detected problems, possibly for two reasons: they do not have sufficient knowledge and this is understandable, given their lack of responsibilities in this area. This causes many beaches to have a high occupancy rate and there is a shift of users towards natural beaches. The study gives us information about the complex administrative process in the coastal system that often proves ineffective on this narrow strip of land...|$|R

40|$|This chapter {{describes}} {{current trends}} in the global media environment, {{with a focus on}} their implications for the management of public agendas and political processes. It assesses the extent to which trends such as the growth of the blogosphere, "citizen journalism," and other forms if user-generated content, have complicated and problematized news and agenda management as engaged in by both media and political elites. It argues that, in large part due to the rise of the internet and the proliferation if online producers of information and commentary, alongside 24 -hour news channels such as CNN and Al Jazeera, political and social actors today face a much more complex, chaotic communication environment than ever bifore, an environment characterized as one of cultural chaos. Having outlined the roots of this trend in the emergence of an expanded, globalized public sphere, the chapter goes on to ask if elite control over the political agenda has been eroded, and if it has, what the consequences for governmmt and the exercise if power might be. Can authoritarian regimes in China, the Middle East, and elsewhere survive the onset if internet-fueled global journalism, for example? In a political environment where public opinion is driven and buffeted by news coverage if unprecedented speed and volume, can democratic governments retain sufficient control over decision- and policy-making processes to enable <b>competent</b> social <b>administration</b> al'ld political management?

In his valedictory speech, retiring judge Alan Wilson indicated that the Court was suffering from a 'lack of leadership'.

Further, he alleged that the Chief Justice had sought to 'contest the automatic operation of [a] protocol' for {{the constitution of the}} Court of Disputed Returns, 'in the teeth of a possible contest about the outcome of the election in Ferny Grove'. Reports have also emerged about the Chief Justice's workload, suggesting that he is allocated many fewer sitting days than his predecessor.

At the time of the formal application, the firms should have already signed (and communicated to the <b>competent</b> <b>administration)</b> the new contract with the eligible worker. Importantly, they could not make the contract conditional on the actual receipt of the incentive. Given that the funds were limited, employers could check online before making an application to see whether the number of requests made until then had already used up the total budget. However, if the funds terminated on the day of application, requests would be funded on a first-come-first-served basis, and those {{who turned out to be}} excluded could not cancel the conversion. On the 2 nd of November, the National Institute for Social Security (INPS) announced that the number of requests received until then would terminate the funds, and therefore the agency discouraged new applications. Some requests arrived after the 2 nd of November. This happened because it was not clear if all the applications already presented were actually eligible. Therefore, some employers might have applied, notwithstanding the INPS warning, hoping that they could still receive funding.|$|E

40|$|Ph. D. University of Hawaii at Manoa 2014. Includes bibliographical references. Competent {{and safe}} nursing care is {{essential}} in professional nursing practice. This {{is especially true in}} the area of medication administration. Nursing students are particularly vulnerable to making medication errors due to inexperience and anxiety when taking care of patients. To lessen anxiety and increase competence, nursing students are required to practice medication administration prior to performing this skill in the clinical setting. Nursing students benefit from many educational techniques, but different training methods in medication administration may affect students differently in regards to competence and levels of anxiety. This study measures differences in state anxiety level from pre-training to post-training, prior to administering oral medications in the clinical setting. The {{purpose of this study is}} to compare the use of high-fidelity simulation (HFS) training, low-fidelity simulation (LFS) training, and video training (VT) to learn the skill of safe and <b>competent</b> medication <b>administration.</b> The null hypothesis is there will be no significant difference in state anxiety pre-training or post-training between HFS, LFS, and VT for medication administration. Forty-four first year undergraduate nursing students completed this investigatory research study. Participants were randomly assigned to HFS, LFS, or VT groups and had an hour of reading to complete prior to training. On the first day of training, participants filled out a demographic form and the State Trait Anxiety Inventory for State Anxiety (STAI-SA). All participants watched a 20 minute video about oral medication administration and then the participants experienced a three hour training session in HFS, LFS, or VT. Two to six weeks post-training, participants filled out the STAI-SA a second time. This was immediately prior to administering oral medication in the clinical facility. Results were analyzed using two way repeated analysis of variance (ANOVA). The results of this study supported the null hypothesis. There were no significant differences in state anxiety levels between the three methods of simulation training. Although the results did not reach significance, there was a trend in scores that suggested that HFS and LFS methods decreased state anxiety from pre-training to post-training. The VT method increased state anxiety from pre-training to post-training. Further research is required to substantiate those findings...|$|R
40|$|The {{creation}} of the safe traffic zone is a long term issue requiring often significant investments, which municipalities or regional governments {{are not able to}} cover within their own budget. Despite complex programs to initiate measures on increasing of the road safety have not been launched yet. One of significant parameters of the safe traffic zone is occurrence of solid obstacles in the immediate vicinity of a road (such as tall trees, billboards placed without a permit etc.), which afterwards influence the seriousness of consequences of the accident. The content and the aim of this diploma written assignment is to find out the actual impact of the transport and technical conditions of the first-class road No. 3 in the Český Krumlov District on the occurrence of incidents in the road traffic which can be found out by analysis of the causes and the effects of the incidents in the specific accidents sites and mapping of the current transport and technical conditions of this relatively loaded road due to heavy traffic. To fulfill the aim of the written assignment, the method of critical analysis, which studies the problem in more complex way and is not satisfied with the simple explanation, was used. With its application I tried to find an answer to the question whether the mentioned road fulfills the forgiving and the self-explanatory road function in all aspects and at those to propose an optimal solution to prevent eventually to mitigate of incidents. In case that the achieved goals of this diploma written assignment will be by the owner of the mentioned road respectively the property administrator and the <b>competent</b> road <b>administration</b> office used to make certain measures leading to lowering of the amount of accidents then the elaboration has fulfilled its purpose. By my opinion every driver has a right to move in the safe traffic zone. Duration and development of the state that we live in will not do without a functioning road system and that is why the current system should be first of all maintained by the state, renewed, expanded and made to perfection because feeling safe on roads is a right and a responsibility of each and one of us...|$|R
