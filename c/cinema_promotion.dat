Examples are: other situations in the recreation and leisure business, cultural events (theatre, <b>cinema)</b> and sales <b>promotions</b> (e. g. weekend offerings) for products in supermarkets.

With this procedure, ways to readjust the advertising policy were found: by allocating the budget differently over media and time and by changing the overall budget level. Several recommendations were made to the management of the park, a number of which have already been implemented...|$|R
