5|$|Since {{the early}} 19th century the Everglades {{have been a}} subject of {{interest}} for agricultural development. The first attempt to drain the Everglades occurred in 1882 when a Pennsylvania land developer named Hamilton Disston constructed the first canals. Though these attempts were largely unsuccessful, Disston's purchase of land spurred tourism and real estate development of the state. The political motivations of Governor Napoleon Bonaparte Broward resulted in more successful attempts at <b>canal</b> <b>construction</b> between 1906 and 1920. Recently reclaimed wetlands were used for cultivating sugarcane and vegetables, while urban development began in the Everglades.|$|E
5|$|An earlier canal {{had been}} built in the Middle Ages to supply Glastonbury Abbey and the town with stone and produce. In the early 19th century a new canal was {{proposed}} to improve commerce in Glastonbury and help with drainage of the surrounding area of the Somerset Levels. Several alternative routes were considered and costed before obtaining an Act of Parliament and issuing a prospectus to raise funds for the building of the <b>canal.</b> <b>Construction</b> commenced in the 1820s; however it was more expensive than envisaged and further funds had to be raised. It finally opened in 1833 but was only prosperous for a short period. The shortfall in income and engineering problems with water supply and waterlogged peat causing the clay puddling to fracture meant that it was sold to the Bristol and Exeter Railway. They used the canal to transport materials for the construction of the new Somerset Central Railway which opened in 1854.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of efforts to control water {{resources}} in Florida and projects to drain the Everglades during the early and mid-20th century, water flow into Biscayne Bay has been altered by the construction of canals. These canals channel water from portions of the southeastern Everglades now used for agriculture into the bay. Prior to <b>canal</b> <b>construction,</b> most fresh water inflow came from rain and groundwater, but the canals are now altering the salinity profile of the bay, conveying sediment and pollutants and leading to saltwater intrusion into the Biscayne aquifer. The Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan (CERP) was established in 2000 to mitigate the effects of human intervention into the natural water flow of the Everglades. Primarily aimed at the restoration of historical patterns of water flow into Everglades National Park, the project will also deal with issues arising from the diversion of {{water out of the}} southern Everglades into Biscayne Bay. The Biscayne Bay Coastal Wetlands Project (BBCW) is a CERP component specifically intended to redistribute water flow so that fresh water is introduced gradually through creeks and marshes rather than short, heavy discharges through drainage canals.|$|E

50|$|King William {{ordered the}} {{planning}} of the <b>canal,</b> and <b>construction</b> started in 1823. The canal was completed in 1826 and named for the king. The 123 km-long canal runs through the Belgian province of Limburg, the Dutch province of Limburg and, for the largest part, through the Dutch province of North Brabant. At {{the time of the}} <b>canal's</b> <b>construction,</b> all of these regions were part of the United Kingdom of the Netherlands (1815 - 1830/39).|$|R
25|$|The Auburn and Syracuse Railroad was {{incorporated}} in 1834 to provide {{easy access to}} and from Syracuse and the Erie <b>Canal.</b> <b>Construction</b> was begun in 1835; however, was delayed during the Panic of 1837. Although the economic downturn lingered until 1843, the railroad was completed by January 1838.|$|E
25|$|In April 1920 the Chilean Compañía Sud Americana de Vapores (CSAV) {{ordered a}} pair of {{passenger}} and cargo liners for service between Valparaíso and New York via the Panama <b>Canal.</b> <b>Construction</b> was delayed, the ships were not completed until {{the latter part of}} 1922, and CSAV lost money as a result.|$|E
25|$|The company {{built the}} north and south {{sections}} of the mill first, in 1844 and 1846 respectively. The houses were built across a new street named for company agent Charles A. Olmstead, who had supervised the original power <b>canal</b> <b>construction.</b> By 1847 the Ogden Mills were the city's leading producer of woven cotton.|$|E
50|$|While it {{is likely}} that some of the canals were {{engineered}} and constructed by the local inhabitants of the Safford Basin, the Hohokam presence does suggest that Hohokam migrants may have at least in part assisted in engineering the later more sophisticated <b>canal</b> <b>constructions.</b>|$|R

25|$|Construction of {{the canal}} was preceded by cutting a small fresh-water canal called Sweet Water Canal from the Nile delta along Wadi Tumilat to the future canal, with a {{southern}} branch to Suez and a northern branch to Port Said. Completed in 1863, these brought fresh water to a previously arid area, initially for <b>canal</b> <b>construction,</b> and subsequently facilitating growth of agriculture and settlements along the canal.|$|E
25|$|Kingston's {{location}} at the Rideau Canal entrance to Lake Ontario {{made it the}} primary military and economic centre of Upper Canada after <b>canal</b> <b>construction</b> was completed in 1832. Incorporated as a town in 1838, the first mayor of Kingston was Thomas Kirkpatrick. Kingston had the largest population of any centre in Upper Canada until the 1840s. Kingston was incorporated as a city in 1846.|$|E
25|$|The {{state capital}} of Chang'an (Daxing), while {{situated}} in a military-secured heartland of Guanzhong, was remote from the economic centers {{to the east and}} south of the empire. Emperor Wen initiated the construction of the Grand Canal, with completion of the first (and the shortest) route that directly linked Chang'an to the Yellow River (Huang He). Later Emperor Yang would enormously enlarge the scale of the Grand <b>Canal</b> <b>construction.</b>|$|E
5000|$|In 1907, the Isthmian Canal Commission hired {{photographer}} Ernest [...] "Red" [...] Hallen {{to photograph}} {{the progress of the}} canal, in order to satisfy both Washington and the American public. Hallen would go on to document the entirety of the <b>Canal's</b> <b>construction</b> and everyday life for the following 30 years.|$|R
50|$|Wootton Rivers Bottom Lock {{was built}} during the <b>canal's</b> <b>construction</b> between 1794 and 1810 under the {{supervision}} of the engineer John Hore of Newbury. The lock has a rise/fall of 8 ft 0 in (2.43 m). The parish of Wootton Rivers has three more locks upstream: Heathy Close, Brimslade, and Wootton Top Lock.|$|R
50|$|Railroads {{began to}} emerge as a more {{efficient}} form of transportation in the 1830s, midway in the <b>canal's</b> <b>construction.</b> In spite of the appointment of former Confederate general Armistead Lindsay Long as Chief Engineer following his service in the Civil War (1861-1865), damage which the canal incurred during the conflict was never completely repaired.|$|R
25|$|Until 1918, {{when all}} {{employees}} {{began to be}} paid in US dollars, gold roll employees were paid in gold, in American currency, while their silver roll counterparts were paid in silver coin, initially Colombian pesos. Through the years of <b>canal</b> <b>construction,</b> silver roll workers were paid with coins from various nations; in several years, coin was imported from the United States because of local shortages. Even after 1918, both the designations and the disparity in privileges lingered.|$|E
25|$|Lord {{was forced}} to abandon the Middle Ground because of the <b>canal</b> <b>construction.</b> The {{decision}} on the route was made by Parliament in 1813. Lord approached the Eyre family {{who were willing to}} lease him another plot nearby in St John's Wood, but at an increased rent of £100 per annum. Lord accepted and again removed and relaid his turf in time {{for the start of the}} 1814 season. This third ground was the present Lord's, now home to MCC for over 200 years.|$|E
25|$|Construction {{started in}} 1613 and {{proceeded}} from west to east, across {{the breadth of}} the layout, like a gigantic windshield wiper as the historian Geert Mak calls it – and not from the centre outwards, as a popular myth has it. The <b>canal</b> <b>construction</b> in the southern sector was completed by 1656. Subsequently, the construction of residential buildings proceeded slowly. The eastern part of the concentric canal plan, covering the area between the Amstel river and the IJ bay, has never been implemented. In the following centuries, the land was used for parks, senior citizens' homes, theatres, other public facilities, and waterways without much planning.|$|E
50|$|In 1905, the Isthmian Canal Commission sought {{engineers}} {{for work}} on the <b>canal's</b> <b>construction,</b> and since Claybourn {{was considered one of}} the best for such work, he accepted a position as superintendent of all floating equipment of the U.S. government property on the Canal Zone. He oversaw a staff of about 500 men and was paid $3,000 per year.|$|R
5000|$|The Act of Parliament authorising {{the canal}} was passed on 14 May 1766. This created [...] "The Company of Proprietors of the Staffordshire and Worcestershire Canal Navigation", which was {{empowered}} to raise an initial £70,000 (equivalent to £ in [...] ),, with a further £30,000 (equivalent to £ in [...] ), if needed, {{to fund the}} <b>canal's</b> <b>construction.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The US {{intention}} {{to influence the}} area, especially the Panama <b>Canal's</b> <b>construction</b> and control, led to the separation of Panama from Colombia in 1903 and its establishment as a nation.

25|$|The Eastern Zhejiang Canal (simplified Chinese: 浙东运河; {{traditional}} Chinese: 浙東運河; pinyin: zhè dōng yùn hé; a.k.a. 杭甬運河 (Hangyong Canal)) {{is located}} in Zhejiang province, China. Its west end is in Xixing Street, Binjiang District, Hangzhou City, crossing Cao'e River and Shaoxing City to its east end, the Yong River estuary in Ningbo City. The canal is 239 kilometres (149 mi) long. Early <b>canal</b> <b>construction</b> {{took place in the}} Shanyin old canal in Shaoxing City, in the Spring and Autumn period (approximately 771 to 476 BC). In the third century AD, an official named He Xun supervised the construction of Xixing Canal, establishing the complete Eastern Zhejiang Canal.|$|E
25|$|With the {{increasing}} popularity of canals, the ironworks quickly became popular for manufacturing canal bridges, {{mainly in the}} local vicinity. Canal bridges made by the ironworks include the Engine Arm Aqueduct (1825), two roving bridges at Smethwick Junction (1828), Galton Bridge (1829), and Braunston Towpath Bridges (1830). By {{the end of the}} <b>canal</b> <b>construction</b> era, Horseley Ironworks had {{emerged as one of the}} most prolific manufacturers of canal bridges in the West Midlands region, especially in Birmingham. This was a result of their signature bridge design which had become popular amongst canal constructors. The design has been replicated more recently, for example in Birmingham during the regeneration of Gas Street Basin where Worcester Bar is linked to Gas Street.|$|E
25|$|By the 1820s a {{national}} network was in existence. <b>Canal</b> <b>construction</b> served {{as a model for}} the organisation and methods later used to construct the railways. They were eventually largely superseded as profitable commercial enterprises by the spread of the railways from the 1840s on. The last major canal to be built in the United Kingdom was the Manchester Ship Canal, which upon opening in 1894 was the largest ship canal in the world, and opened Manchester as a port. However it never achieved the commercial success its sponsors had hoped for and signalled canals as a dying mode of transport in an age dominated by railways, which were quicker and often cheaper.|$|E
50|$|New ethnic Irish {{communities}} {{formed in}} some towns along its route after completion, as Irish immigrants were {{a large portion}} of the construction labor force. Earth extracted from the canal was transported to the New York city area and used as landfill in New York and New Jersey. A plaque honoring the <b>canal's</b> <b>construction</b> is located in Battery Park in southern Manhattan.|$|R
50|$|One of the {{greatest}} challenges facing the builders of the Panama Canal was dealing with the tropical diseases rife in the area. The health measures taken during the construction contributed greatly {{to the success of the}} <b>canal's</b> <b>construction.</b> These included general health care, the provision of an extensive health infrastructure, and a major program to eradicate disease-carrying mosquitoes from the area.|$|R
50|$|The Cumberland Visitor Center for the C&O Canal National Historical Park {{is located}} at Canal Place, and {{features}} interactive and educational displays {{about the history of}} the canal and the city of Cumberland. Exhibits tell the story of the <b>canal's</b> <b>construction,</b> cargo, mules, locks, and crew. The exhibit is operated by National Park Service and is located on the first floor of the railway station.|$|R
25|$|Construction work {{started on}} 27 September 1793, at Heath Common, near the {{junction}} with the Aire and Calder Canal. Samual Hartley was the engineer, and John Pinkerton was contracted {{to build the}} <b>canal.</b> <b>Construction</b> was difficult, with Pinkerton unexpectedly encountering rock in the cutting at Cold Hiendley, and inflation pushed up the costs. There were disputes between Hartley and Pinkerton, which lasted until long after the canal was opened, and were finally settled in 1812, after a lawsuit. The northern section to Barnsley opened on 8 June 1799, while the Barnsley to Barnby section was not started until late 1798, and did not open until early 1802. The Dearne and Dove Canal was completed in late 1804.|$|E
25|$|Some {{fragments}} of the original <b>canal</b> <b>construction</b> may be discerned along {{the route of the}} railway. Within Aberdeen these include where the railway runs parallel to Elmbank Terrace, Kittybrewster (at the foot of which road is an elderly bridge carrying the road diagonally over the railway), and again where the railway runs parallel to Great Northern Road in Woodside. Dyce and Dalwearie also have obvious remains. Woodside still has a canal bridge which is in use for the road only with nothing now running underneath; the railway is slightly to the north at this point. It was once well outside the bounds of the city proper, and so both that area and Old Aberdeen still boast roads named Canal Street, which sometimes leads to confusion.|$|E
25|$|The canal {{was a very}} {{efficient}} way of moving large amounts of heavy goods cheaply and with minimal labor. But White and Hazard had single-handedly spurred <b>canal</b> <b>construction</b> {{up and down the}} East Coast by taming the Lehigh River with navigations in less than two years, and four years ahead of promises to investors. Unfortunately, the northern canals would freeze in the winter, and their towpaths were muddy in spring and late fall. This made it impractical for a burgeoning mill town that needed year-round freight transportation, but if LC Co. was putting monies into railroads, other businessmen {{were going to have to}} take a hard careful look. With steamboat tugs proven on the Merrimack and Middlesex Canal themselves, and news of railroads building in Europe and now, the United States, investors would need to adopt new techniques sooner or miss opportunities.|$|E
50|$|As {{deputy head}} of the OGPU, Yagoda {{organized}} {{the building of the}} White Sea-Baltic Canal using forced labor at breakneck speed between 1931 and 1933 at the cost of huge casualties. For his contribution to the <b>canal's</b> <b>construction</b> he was later awarded the Order of Lenin. The construction of the Moscow-Volga Canal was also started under his watch, but only completed after his fall by his successor Nikolai Yezhov.|$|R
50|$|The {{building}} of the final section of the canal saw the government expropriate the eastern section of his land, taking everything east of modern Elgin Street (then known as Biddy's Lane). While losing some of his land, this proved a benefit for Sparks as {{the location of the}} canal greatly increased the value of his other holdings. Sparks donated about 20 acres of land towards the <b>canal's</b> <b>construction.</b>|$|R
50|$|After the {{incorporation}} of Holstein into the Danish crown by the 1773 Treaty of Tsarskoye Selo, geopolitical conditions at last permitted a <b>canal's</b> <b>construction</b> and operation. Surveying and planning for the canal began in 1773, with a preliminary plan for the canal proposed in February 1774. On 14 April 1774, King Christian VII of Denmark issued a cabinet order establishing a Canal Commission to oversee the construction, led by Heinrich Carl von Schimmelmann.|$|R
