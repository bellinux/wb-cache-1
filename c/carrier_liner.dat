40|$|Less-than-truckload (LTL) carriers, which {{operate on}} thin margins, have {{significant}} negative impacts due to empty trips, idled capacity on lots, and rising energy costs. The impacts can cascade to other industries; for example, empty trips may affect global food prices. Recent advances in Internet and information communication technologies (ICT) foster {{the possibility of}} innovative new business and operational paradigms within the small- to medium-sized LTL industry to address these concerns. One promising innovation {{is the concept of}} LTL carrier-carrier collaboration, which provides opportunities for LTL carriers to exploit synergies in operations (such as excess capacity), reduce costs associated with fleet operation, decrease lead times, increase asset utilization (power units), and enhance overall service levels. LTL carrier-carrier collaboration is a relatively unexplored concept within the freight domain, where past studies have focused on collaboration within the truckload (TL) <b>carrier,</b> <b>liner</b> shipping, airline, and rail industries. This research seeks to understand and develop LTL collaborative paradigms from the supply and demand perspectives, thereby filling a key gap in the current freight collaboration literature. From the supply perspective, three models were developed. First, a static single carrier collaboration problem (SCCP) was addressed to gain insights on the effects of single and multiple products with fixed and variable transfer costs on the LTL collaborative paradigm from a planning perspective. Second, we extend the SCCP to a deterministic dynamic single carrier collaboration problem (DDSCCP) that captures the impacts of the time dimension on the costs associated to congestion effects (such as holding costs). Then, we extend the single carrier problem to a time-dependent multiple carrier collaboration problem (TD-MCCP) to gain insights on the effect of multiple carriers collaborating. From the demand perspective, a survey was conducted to capture the LTL trucking industry’s propensity to collaborate. Using the survey data, a mixed (random parameters) logit model methodology was developed to better understand the factors that may induce carriers to collaborate. The aforementioned models provide an analytical foundation for exploring the LTL carrier collaboration paradigm. ...|$|E

40|$|Many {{real world}} systems {{operate in a}} {{decentralized}} manner, where individual operators interact with varying degree of cooperation and self motives. In this paper, we study transportation networks that operate as an alliance among different carriers. In particular, we study alliance formation among <b>carriers</b> in <b>liner</b> shipping. We address tactical problems such as the design of large scale networks (which result from integrating the service networks of different carriers in an alliance) and operational problems such as the allocation of limited capacity on a transportation network among the carriers in the alliance. We utilize concepts from mathematical programming and game theory and design a mechanism to guide the carriers in an alliance to pursue an optimal collaborative strategy. The mechanism provides side payments to the carriers, as an added incentive, to motivate them {{to act in the}} best interest of the alliance while maximizing their own profits.

Problems related to both multi-user terminals, where the terminal operator and <b>liner</b> <b>carriers</b> are different parties, and dedicated terminals, where <b>liner</b> <b>carriers</b> lease the terminal, are considered. A lower bound and an effective meta-heuristic algorithm are proposed for a dynamic {{variant of the}} Berth Allocation Problem (BAP). The Multiple Berth Allocation Problem (MBAP) is also introduced. Different crane scheduling methods used by terminal operators are analyzed and a tabu search algorithm is designed for a new variant of the Quay Crane Scheduling Problem (QCSP). The Simultaneous Berth and Quay Crane Scheduling Problem (BQCSP) is introduced with a lower bound analysis and an efficient solution method. A computational analysis is performed which exposes the substantial benefit of simultaneous planning over the hierarchical approach currently used by terminal operators. The tactical level Voyage and Berth Scheduling Problem (VBSP) is defined and a mathematical model based on multi-commodity network flow is presented.

40|$|Cooperation in {{the ocean}} liner {{shipping}} industry has always been important to improve liner shipping networks (LSN's). As tight cooperations like alliances are challenged by antitrust laws, looser forms of cooperation among <b>liner</b> <b>carriers</b> might become a reasonable way to increase efficiency of LSN's. Our goal is to facilitate a loose form of cooperation among <b>liner</b> <b>carriers.</b> Therefore, we introduce a coordination mechanism for designing a collaborative LSN based on a multi round combinatorial auction. Via the auction, carriers exchange demand triplets, i. e. orders which describe the transport of containers between ports. A standard network design problem which includes ship scheduling and cargo routing decisions is used as isolated network design problem of an individual carrier. A carrier has to solve this isolated problem repeatedly during the auction so that the carrier is able to decide which demand triplets to sell, on which demand triplets to bid, and what prices to charge. To solve these problems we propose a variable neighborhood search based matheuristic. The matheuristic addresses the isolated planning problem in four phases (construct ship cycles, modify cycles, determine container flow, and reallocate ships to cycles). Our computational experiments {{on a set of}} 56 synthetic test instances suggest that the introduced combinatorial auction increases profits on average compared to isolated planning significantly by four percent. The more diverse the original assignment of demand triplets and ships to carriers is, the higher the potential for collaboration; for 18 diverse instances, the profits increase on average by ten percent...|$|R
40|$|In {{maritime}} transportation, {{liner shipping}} accounts for over 60 % {{of the value}} of goods shipped. However, very limited literature is available on the study of various problems in liner shipping. In this thesis we focus on problems related to this industry. Given a set of cargo to be transported, a set of ports and a set of ships, a common problem faced by <b>carriers</b> in <b>liner</b> shipping is the design of their service network. We develop an integrated model to design service network for the ships and to route the available cargo, simultaneously. The proposed model incorporates many relevant constraints, such as the weekly frequency constraint on the operated routes, and emerging trends, such as obtaining benefits from transshipping cargo on two or more service routes, that appear in practice but have not been considered previously in literature. Also, we design exact and heuristic algorithms to solve the integer program efficiently. The proposed algorithms integrate the ship scheduling problem, a tactical planning level decision, and the cargo routing problem, an operational planning level decision, and provide good overall solution strategy. Computational experiments indicate that larger problem instances, as compared to the literature, can be solved using these algorithms in acceptable computational time. Alliance formation is very common among global <b>liner</b> <b>carriers</b> however a quantitative study of liner alliances is missing from literature. We provide a mathematical framework for the quantitative study of these alliances. For the formation of a sustainable alliance, carriers need to agree on an overall service network and resolve issues concerning distribution of benefits and costs among the members of the alliance. We develop mechanisms to design a collaborative service network and to manage the interaction among the carriers through the allocation of profits in a fair way. The mechanism utilizes inverse optimization techniques to obtain resource exchange costs in the network. These costs provide side payments to the members, on top of the revenue generated by them in the collaborative solution, to motivate them to act {{in the best interest of}} the alliance while satisfying their own self interests.

40|$|Macroeconomic freight {{transport}} models serve as decision support for transport policy development. To evaluate infrastructure investments or policy measures these tools need {{to capture the}} underlying complexity of {{freight transport}} networks in a sufficient way. Recent developments in this field outline possibilities to combine aggregated and disaggregated approaches in freight transport modelling in order to integrate more realistic freight agent behaviour. In contrast to aggregated models, disaggregated approaches are able to simulate the decision behaviour on the microlevel of an individual decision maker. In maritime container supply chains <b>liner</b> <b>carriers</b> or their brokers/agents and freight forwarders face a variety of interconnected logistical choices such as carrier, port, mode, route, shipment, or inventory choice.

The economic mechanism consisting of demand and supply factors which drives the liner freight market are identified for analysis. Demand factors such as world trade volumes and favourable currency exchange rates may increase the freight rates in a particular trade lane but unexpected political or social events are also found to cause the freight rates to dip. On the supply side, advances in ship technology have greatly increase the ship capacity up to 14, 000 TEU and constant pressure by the EU on the shipping industry's competitiveness. Using the demand and supply factors, a simplified shipping model is developed to help forecast the freight rates for liners. The quantitative analysis yielded results that showed that the liner freight rate is largely related to the import volumes. Shippers will only ship when there is cargo required and freight rates are not speculative in nature and can be used as a tool to assist in making decisions.

H 577 P LMS 2017 Xiaviii, 103 pages :color illustrationsLiner {{shipping}} network {{design is}} a comprehensive decision problem for the carrier to plan their service operations. A series of related decisions from tactical and operational levels are coordinated to maximize the profits. In this thesis, we study two network design problems for <b>carriers</b> in <b>liner</b> shipping. The first work focuses on the joint decision makings for the network design, in which a general fuel consumption function is assumed. The second work studies the solution to a compact optimization model for the network design, in which the transshipment cost is taken into account. In this thesis, we have developed novel optimization techniques to solve both problems. In the first study, we develop a mathematical programming model that addresses fleet deployment, speed optimization, and cargo allocation jointly, so as to maximize total profits for carriers at the strategic level. To capture fuel costs precisely, our model adopts a general fuel consumption function that depends on both vessel speed and vessel load. To overcome intractability caused by nonlinear terms in the model, we separate fuel consumption costs into two terms associated with ship speed and ship load, respectively, so as to obtain a mixed integer linear programming formulation for approximation. Based on column generation techniques, we develop an iterative search algorithm that adaptively reorganizes the approximated formulation. We conduct extensive experiments using generated data sets from actual liner shipping services in {{different regions of the}} world to show the effectiveness of our approach as well as the significant impact of speed-load factors on fuel consumptions. Managerial insights are obtained by testing the model under different scenarios, which may greatly assist decision makers in the liner shipping industry. In the second study, we study a problem that aims at creating a set of regular services for a designated fleet of oceangoing ships to transport the containerized cargos among seaports. Containers can be transshipped from one ship to another at an intermediate port in order to improve the transportation efficiency. The objective of the problem is to maximize the revenues from the satisfied demands while minimizing the operating cost including the transshipment cost. For this issue, many solution methods known to be effective for problems assuming zero transshipment cost cannot directly apply, because the calculation of transshipment cost has significantly complicated the problem and its mathematical formulation. To tackle this challenge, we develop for this problem a new compact mixed-integer linear programming model. However, the new model may contain exponentially many variables and constraints, making its solution very challenging. Therefore, we propose a novel application of simultaneous column-and-row generation to solve the linear programming relaxation of the new model, so as to derive an upper bound for the profit of an optimal network design. Based on this, we have developed a branch-and-price to find optimal or near-optimal integer solutions for this problem. Results from experiments have shown the effectiveness and efficiency of our models and solution methods. Department of Logistics and Maritime StudiesPh.
