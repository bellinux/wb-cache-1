40|$|This thesis {{consists}} of four parts: 	Part 1, comprised of Chapters I and II, {{consists of}} this introduction and some background information. It aims to provide the reader with the context necessary to obtain a workable understanding of the Canadian marine Arctic, the NWP, the shipping that occurs therein and some basic information on ice breaking. However, spatial considerations only allow for minimal coverage. Possible terminology clarification and definitions are also provided. 	Part 2, comprised of Chapter III, focuses on the first research question. Namely, it explores aspects of the international legal framework for Arctic shipping relevant in respect of ice breaking in the NWP. Again, spatial considerations do not permit an in-depth examination, so the author has selectively presented only those aspects deemed essential {{for the purposes of}} this thesis. 	Part 3, comprised of Chapters IV and V, focuses on the second and third research questions. First, Chapter IV provides a presentation of the laws, regulations and practices in relation to ice breaking in the NWP. From this presentation, the author establishes the instances in which a vessel navigating in the NWP is legally required to obtain icebreaker assistance. Second, Chapter V contains an analysis of the consistency of Canadian practice in relation to ice breaking in the NWP (presented in Chapter IV) with international law in light of the aspects of the international framework for Arctic shipping (presented in Chapter III). 	Part 4, comprised of Chapter VI, attempts to conclude on the adequacy of the Canadian practice in relation to ice breaking in light of the challenges for the NWP related to climate change, marine environmental security, and <b>creeping</b> <b>jurisdiction...</b>|$|E

In this framework, a “fourth”, legal leg of sustainable development has been envisioned as a necessary complement to realise the 2030 Agenda, through the role of inclusive and effective institutions. The role of tribunals and of access to justice assumes a significance insofar as it guarantees the respect {{of the rule of law}} that has been highlighted as the fundamental aspect for achieving sustainable development. In this regard, experiences of national implementation of the principle of sustainable development in the field of human rights are crucial for understanding current developments and for studying legal systems that are mutually influencing and reinforcing each other. Concerning the guarantee of environmental rights, three main strategies can be outlined: the maintenance of general jurisdictions; the establishment of “green benches” as sections of ordinary tribunals dealing with environmental cases; the creation of specialised tribunals, with experts in scientific subjects and judges specifically trained in this field. In light of its experience of “low-yielding” judicial institutions, characterised by delays, backlogs and insufficient capacities of case management, India undoubtedly constitutes one of the leading cases for assessing the validity of institutional measures aimed at the application of the concept of sustainable development in the legal field. In this regard, the Parliament of India chose to pursue the third path and enacted the National Green Tribunal Act in 2010. The experience of India is thus analysed considering, on the one hand, the constitutional framework embodied in the protection of environmental rights within the right to life enshrined in Article 21 of the Constitution, with Articles 48 A and 51 A(g) and, on the other hand, the interpretation of the courts regarding international law principles (sustainable development, polluter pays and precautionary principle), that are statutorily applied by the National Green Tribunal. The thesis thus analyses the advantages brought forward by the newly established tribunal - expanded access to tribunals, through new rules and a more flexible procedure; enhanced expertise due to the change in the composition of courts; consistency in decisions, thanks to the specialisation - as well as possible drawbacks caused by the resort to <b>creeping</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> and by the monopolisation of the interpretation of sustainable development by a single environmental court...|$|E
40|$|Access to {{environmental}} justice {{is a key}} component to ensure just and equitable outcomes for sustainable development. This paper aims to assess the present judicial structures that offer access {{to environmental}} justice in India. The initiative, presented below has wider international purchase {{as it is a}} case study of a growing judicial development. India’s policies and laws have sought to become comprehensive and stringent particularly {{as a consequence of the}} Bhopal tragedy in 1984. The ‘command and control approach’ is supplemented by new regulatory techniques such as environment impact assessments and public hearings. However, contradictions and gaps in institutional mechanisms have resulted in ineffective implementation of legislation. Factors such as slack performance by enforcement authorities, multi-layered corruption, political interference and personal gain are the root causes for this failure. As a consequence, the role of India’s judiciary in securing the enforcement of rights through Public Interest Litigation [PIL] outside statute law but within the constitutional mandate has promoted new and unique environmental jurisprudence. PIL is an innovative and powerful judicial tool making human rights meaningful and effective. PIL has revolutionised the judicial procedure by introducing three procedural innovations: namely, expanded standing, non-adversarial procedure and attenuation of rights from remedies as a result of expanded frontiers of fundamental rights, particularly the right to life under Article 21 of the Constitution of India. The right to a healthy environment finds its genesis through the right to life. The state is under a duty to enforce this constitutional right by devising and implementing a coherent and coordinated programme for the well-being of the citizenry. Failure on the part of state have prompted the judges to issue short interim directions entitled ‘continuing mandamus ‘. The proactive judiciary has also declared and promoted the principles of sustainable development, the precautionary and the polluter pays principles. However, concerns such as the rapidly increasing number of petitions, expensive and delayed disposal of petitions, complex technical and scientific issues, inconsistent approach by the courts based upon individual judicial preferences, unrealistic directions and the issue of <b>creeping</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> have created doubts about the current effectiveness of PIL in environmental matters. In seeking a balanced judicial forum that advances a distinctively green jurisprudence, the Parliament of India enacted the National Green Tribunal Act 2010. The National Green Tribunal [NGT] is one element of a reformist approach to environmental governance. The Tribunal aims to adjudicate environmental protection and forest conservation cases in an effective and expeditious manner. This includes enforcement of any legal right relating to the environment together with available relief and compensation for damages to persons and property. The NGT started functioning from 4 th July 2011. The Principal Bench is based at New Delhi with circuit benches at Chennai, Bhopal, Pune and Kolkata so that it can reach remoter parts of India. The principal bench and the regional benches are active. India has joined a handful of forward looking countries including Australia and New Zealand to have a dedicated green court. The creation of NGT is an important initiative. NGT’s potential is being realised in terms of type and volume of cases coming before it. The ‘multi-faceted and multi-skilled’ NGT with a wide jurisdiction is gradually earning the reputation of being a ‘fast-track court’. It aims to strike a right balance between environment and development. The nature of cases which have come before the NGT include environmental clearances for developmental projects including dams, steel plants, hydro- electric projects and thermal power plants; coastal zone regulations; encroachments on the floodplains; issues relating to pollution and imposition of environmental fines. The principles of inter-generational equity, precautionary and polluter pays principle, public trust doctrine underpinning the international environmental law have been foundational norms in deciding the matters before the NGT. The institutional redesigning of this judicial structure is unlikely to be the panacea for all environmental ills but it can provide a lead in terms of new forms of environmental dispute resolution. This positive initiative must be seen within the broader context of balancing competing values of environment protection and sustainability on one hand and resource driven growth on the other...|$|E
40|$|The {{controversy}} between Japan and Russia {{over the}} ownership of the Kuril Islands is a significant barrier to improved diplomatic relations in the Far Eastern region. Because of this dispute, Japan and Russia have not yet signed a peace treaty to formally end {{the second world war}} and neither side seems willing to make any significant concessions to reach a compromise. The issue of ownership of these islands has been a continuing focal point of Russo-Japanese relations since the two nations first made contact in the late eighteenth century. The various aspects of this dispute are complex and have continued to evolve over time with changes in international law, <b>creeping</b> maritime <b>jurisdiction</b> and the dynamic nature of the breakup of the former Soviet Union. This study analyses the historical and legal facts surrounding the issue of sovereignty and concludes by suggesting how this controversy may be settled...|$|R
40|$|The phrase ‘creeping jurisdiction’ {{has been}} applied {{by a number of}} publicists to the gradual {{extension}} of state jurisdiction offshore in {{the law of the sea}} through the course of the 20 th century. Under the current United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (LOSC), and confirmed by international practice, the territorial sea is 12 nautical miles wide. It might have been thought that jurisdictional creep had ended with the conclusion of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (LOSC) in 1982. This chapter examines whether contemporary practice may lead to a further <b>creeping</b> of <b>jurisdiction,</b> not in a further grab for resources, but in an effort by states to provide themselves with greater security from threats from the sea. It examines contemporary and emerging practice in respect of maritime security, and discusses whether seeking greater control over security — which covers military security and environmental security — is the next generation of jurisdictional creep. Beyond the territorial sea, the LOSC also confirms that there is freedom of navigation for all vessels. This is essentially applicable for the exclusive economic zone and high seas areas beyond it...|$|R
