It is near to zero for the groups based on the area of residence, gender and level of education, while it is even negative according to the behaviour looking/not looking for a job. Anyway, the most disadvantaged group consists in the residents in the South, where this component represents more than the 60 % of the total probability gap, followed by gender, where it represents 45 %. In the other cases, this component ranges from 8 % (corresponding to the groups according to the parents’ educational level) to 16 % (with reference to the personal educational level).|$|E
30|$|Hou {{proposes a}} {{residual}} spectrum saliency model {{from the perspective}} of information theory [22]. He believes that human visual processing mechanism can be interpreted with efficient encoding. From {{the point of view of}} information theory, efficient coding decomposes images into two parts. One is the new information, and the other is priori information. The prior information belongs to the redundant information and should be suppressed in the encoding of the system. For the image scene, these redundant information represent the statistical invariant attribute in the environment. By means of removing the remaining components from the image, the detection algorithm of residual spectrum significant <b>component</b> <b>highlights</b> the new information in the image, that is, the image of the significant components. The main idea is to see the image as multi-object projection accumulated under the uniform background and represents it with the image of the two-dimensional Fourier transform. The amplitude spectrum is usually affected by the characteristics of object regardless of its position, so the original object image is decomposed into weighted sum of complex fundamental waves. If regarding these fundamental waves as a set of features, the amplitude spectrum shows the weight of these features in the image. Using the residual spectrum algorithm is to suppress the larger proportion of features to a larger extent and to enhance the smaller proportion of features.|$|E

40|$|Two {{datasets}} of turbulence velocities {{collected over}} different bedform types under contrasting experimental conditions show similarity {{in terms of}} velocity-intermittency characteristics and suggest a universality to the velocity-intermittency structure for flow over bedforms. One dataset was obtained by sampling flow over static bedforms in different locations, {{and the other was}} based on a static position but mobile bedforms. A flow classification based on the velocity-intermittency behaviour is shown to reveal some differences from that based on an analysis of Reynolds stresses, boundary layer correlation and turbulent kinetic energy. This may be attributed to the intermittency variable, which captures the local effect of individual turbulent flow structures. Locations in the wake region or the outer layer of the flow are both shown to have a velocity-intermittency behaviour that departs from that for idealized wakes or outer layer flow because of the superposition of localized flow structures generated by bedforms. The combined effect of this yields a velocity-intermittency structure unique to bedform flow. The use of a time series of a single velocity <b>component</b> <b>highlights</b> the potential power of our approach for field, numerical and laboratory studies. The further validation of the velocity-intermittency method for non-idealized flows undertaken here suggests that this technique can be used for flow classification purposes in geomorphology, hydraulics, meteorology and environmental fluid mechanics. © 2014 The Authors...|$|E
40|$|When {{reviewing}} the various fish-based community indicators aiming at assessing the ecological status of marine communities and/or ecosystems, a typology consisting of three major components emerges. The first <b>component</b> <b>highlights</b> {{the choice of}} relevant metrics associated {{with a level of}} organization (e. g. population or community). The second relies on the method used to combine the metrics (an aggregated indicator or a synoptic table). The third refers to the type of analysis (direct or indirect) that is used to establish the link between the metrics and a given pressure. In this paper we use the Vilaine coastal-estuarine fish communities as a case study to discuss and relate two different approaches to the suggested typology. The first approach (time-trend approach) is based on historical series of data,whereas the second approach (multi-metric index, MMI) is based on a geographic series including various French estuaries. They were developed or adapted from French studies but are representative of the approaches used in Europe. When applied to the case study, they differed in their diagnosis: the time-trend approach indicated that the bay of Vilaine habitat was deteriorating, whereas the MMI, which compares many French estuaries, indicated a good environmental state. Differences and complementarities between the approaches are thoroughly discussed with respect to the three mains components of the typology. This work appears at a particular moment, when several fish-based indicators are being developed in France and the rest of Europe. It intends to serve as an element of the ongoing reflection concerning the limitations of the various approaches {{that can be used to}} develop such indicators...|$|E
40|$|Young adult (YA) {{fiction is}} a fast-growing area of {{literature}} that is constantly responding to commercial pressures {{and the demands}} of its growing audience. Although it has a large commercial popularity, the critical focus on YA literature is lacking in some areas. As YA literature expands and increasingly engages with more complex issues, such as mental illness, {{there is a need for}} rigorous analysis of the ethical issues and questions raised by this fiction. In answering recently scholarly calls for critical analysis of YA literature, this thesis considers two novels that fall under the often-used label of the “problem novels”—Neal Shusterman’s Challenger Deep (2015) and Sophie Kinsella’s Finding Audrey (2015) —in order to explore ethical representation of mental illness in YA fiction. The discussion is informed by the scholarship of Wayne C. Booth, whose The Company We Keep: An Ethics of Fiction foregrounds the ethical responsibilities of both writer and reader, and Mike Cadden, who seeks to improve the power dynamic between reader and writer through the use of double-voiced discourse theory. This thesis is a creative practice thesis and the exegesis will be followed by a YA novella narrated by a teenage girl attempting to recover from an anxiety disorder and regain control of her life. The creative component is closely linked to the exegesis not only in terms of genre and theme, but also in its engagement with ethical issues. The creative <b>component</b> <b>highlights</b> that ethical representation is possible and beneficial, but also reveals that double-voiced discourse is a challenging theory to apply as it requires the writer to constantly step back from the narrative in a way that disrupts immersion in the creative process...|$|E

The growing amount of data contains valuable information which organizations in a more digitized society need to manage. It is a major challenge to visualize data, both in a static and interactive way. Through visualization of big data follows several opportunities containing risk assessment and decision basis. Previous research indicates a lack of standards and guidelines considering the development of interactive dashboards. By studying factors of success from a user-centered perspective we proceeded with a qualitative approach using semi-structured interviews. In addition to this we performed a thorough examination of existing literature in this particular field of research. A total of eight interviews were held, all eight respondents had experience from using or developing dashboards. The results indicates that user experience is an important yet not a sufficiently used principle. They also indicates challenges concerning the management of big data and particularly visualizing it. The results developed into a model which illustrates guidelines and vital components to orchestrate when developing a dashboard. A user-centered approach should pervade the entire developing process. Interactive functionalities are rather a necessity than a recommendation. With interactiveness comes drill-down functionalities {{which leads to a}} more intuitively practice.

The VLE guides {{students and teachers}} {{in the production of}} collaborative research papers to summarize their inquiry-based activities. This thesis details the formative evaluations carried out on the VLE and provides empirical evidence to support the hypothesis that the initial version of the VLE successfully supported inquiry-based science investigations. The VLE evaluations also provided an opportunity to assess the eectiveness of each of the VLE components toward our educational objectives. This thesis describes the shortfalls identied in the original version of the VLE, which has lead to the encapsulation of team management, collaborative writing and image-based data collection into the VLE. This thesis also details the initial trials of the collaborative components of the VLE and provides evidence to support the contention that collaboration has been successfully introduced into the VLE. Finally, this thesis provides a technical description of the underlying architecture of the EVE Portal and describes the implementation details of the EVE imaging component. This thesis makes contributions to e-Learning by providing empirical evidence that an amalgamation of software tools can support an inquiry-based scientic process with schoolchildren and teachers. The encapsulation of team allocation and team-based writing presents an innovative method for supporting inquiry-based learning within schools.

40|$|Bibliography: pages 105 - 113. This {{study is}} a description, {{from the vantage point}} of a {{participant}} observer, of the development of a new, and probably unique, method of writing, teaching and learning about an oral tradition - a method which is grounded in ways of knowing, thinking and learning inherent in that tradition. It arose in the course of a co-operative venture - between two lecturers in African Religion and myself - to write a text for South African schools on African Religion (sometimes called African Traditional Religion). Wanting to be true to our subject within the obvious constraints, we endeavoured to write within an oral mode. The product, African Religion and Culture, Alive!, is a transcript of taped oral interchanges between the three authors within a simulated, dramatised format. The simulation provided the context for using the teaching and learning strategies employed in an oral tradition, but within a Western institution. We hoped in this way to mirror and mediate a situation in which many South African students find themselves: at the interface between a home underpinned by an oral tradition, and a school underpinned by a written tradition. In the book, knowledge is presented through myth, biographical and autobiographical stories, discussion, question, and comment. The choice of this mode of knowledge-presentation has been greatly influenced by the work of Karen McCarthy Brown. A further important requirement for us was to produce a text that would be acceptable to all the particular varieties of African religious practice. This need was met in a way that became the most important aspect of the method - the device of setting, as a core part of the work for students, a primary research component. Students are required to seek out traditional elders within their community and learn from them, as authorities on African religion and culture, the details of particular practice. This is a way of decentering the locus of control of knowledge and education, as well as of restoring respect for African Religion and preserving information in danger of being lost. The primary research <b>component</b> <b>highlights</b> fundamental issues relating to the 'ownership' of religion, knowledge, power, reality which are explored in the study. Also considered are the implications of writing about an oral mode while trying to preserve as much of the character of that mode - writing by means of speaking. Text as a metaphor provides a frame for examining the process and the product - in terms of text as document, as score, as performance, as intertextual event, and as monument and site of struggle. Suggestions are made for further research, both on the particular method of text-production under consideration, and also on the approach to teaching and learning about African Religion. Also considered is the relevance of this particular learning and teaching approach to the values inherent in the proposed new curriculum for education in South Africa...|$|E
