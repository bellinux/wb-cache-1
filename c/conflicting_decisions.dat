25|$|In 1878 Hobhouse {{was made}} {{arbitrator}} under the Epping Forest Act and in 1881 he succeeded Sir Joseph Napier on the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council. There without salary he did useful judicial work for twenty years. He delivered {{the decision of}} the committee in 200 appeals, of which 120 were from India. Several cases were of grave moment. In Merriman v. Williams (7 Appeal Cases 484), an action between the bishop and dean of Grahamstown, Hobhouse set forth fully the history of the relationship of the Anglican Church of Southern Africa with the Church of England, and decided that the South African Church is independent of it. In the consolidated appeals in 1887 by several Canadian banks (12 Appeal Cases, 575) against the decisions of the Court of Queen's Bench for Quebec, which involved the respective limits {{of the power of the}} dominion and provincial legislatures to regulate banks, Hobhouse's judgment upheld the right of the province to tax banks and insurance companies constituted by Act of the dominion legislature. In a case from India in 1899 (26 Indian Appeals, Law Reports 113) which necessitated the review of a number of <b>conflicting</b> <b>decisions</b> of the Indian courts, Hobhouse settled a long disputed point in Hindu law and decided, contrary to much tradition, that when an individual person was adopted as an only son, the fact of adoption should be legally recognised and the parents' plenary powers admitted.|$|E

The aim {{of the study was}} to identify and assess the relationship between the Five-Factor Wellness Model and work-related factors such as interpersonal conflicts, organizational constraints, workload, work-family <b>conflict,</b> <b>decision</b> latitude, transformational leadership, psychological job characteristics and perceived organizational support. The subjects of the study were 177 employees of a call center. Healthy lifestyle was measured applying a Five-Factor Wellness questionnaire (Myers, Sweeney 2005 b). Physical symptoms, interpersonal conflicts, organizational constraints and workload were measured using respective scales designed by Spector and Jex (2007). Decision latitude was measured employing Karasek (1985) questionnaire. Work-family conflict was measured referring to a subscale of negative work-home interaction (Geurts et al. 2005). A transformational leadership style was measured using General Scale of transformational leadership (Carless et al. 2000). Perceived organizational support was measured using a short version of Perceived Organizational Support scale (Eisenberger et al. 1986). Research findings show that healthy lifestyle as measured by the Five-Factor Wellness Model was predicted by lower work-family conflict, whereas physical symptoms - by marked work-family <b>conflict,</b> <b>decision</b> latitude and gender (female) ...|$|R

In our setting, two groups compete for the right to allocate society’s resources, and we allow for costly inter-group mobility. The winning group offers an allocation, that the opposition can either accept, or reject and wage conflict. Agents can also choose to switch group membership. Expropriating a large share of resources increases political strength by attracting opposition members, but also implies a higher threat of conflict. Our main finding is that the option of inter-group mobility in fact increases the likelihood of conflict.
