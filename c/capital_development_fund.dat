40|$|Until now, the United Nations <b>Capital</b> <b>Development</b> <b>Fund’s</b> (UNCDF) Gender Equitable Local Development (GELD) {{programme}} has {{not been}} presented within an explicit human rights framework. This is strange given that the human rights based approach to development (HRBAD) aims {{to ensure that all}} human beings can live their lives fully and with dignity. HRBAD is fundamentally about the healthy and full development of individuals and communities. In addition, one of human rights’ central concerns is that people have equal access to the benefits of society. Initiatives to realize human rights therefore give priority to the most marginalized - the poorest - in a society. It is those individuals who have most difficulty in securing the basics that are essential to living their lives with dignity. Women in all communities are disproportionately represented among the poor. Thus, human rights have gender equity as a central focus. Put another way, we are dealing with the feminization of poverty. We are dealing with the concept of equal access (to development). In short, we are dealing with those who need (and deserve) greater priority in access to infrastructure and supporting services in order to reach a point of equality...|$|R
