5|$|Red, {{white and}} blue have been the colours of every jersey design in the club's history; however, the jersey design has {{undergone}} several alterations. The red, {{white and blue}} colour scheme has traditionally been the <b>colour</b> <b>combination</b> of sporting teams representing Sydney's Eastern Suburbs. Eastern Suburbs Rugby League club adopted these colours in 1908, with its predecessor Rugby Union club, also known as Eastern Suburbs in the Sydney club Rugby Union, having played in the tri-colours. The jersey worn in the first premiership season consisted of several hoops; red stripes dominated over consecutive smaller white and blue stripes. Although the width and the order of these stripes have changed, the basic design has always been maintained.|$|E
5|$|The club colours {{have not}} always been sky blue. The {{predecessor}} club BK Idrott wore blue and white striped shirts and white shorts, and this kit was still used {{for the first six months}} of 1910 after Malmö FF was founded. This was later changed to red and white striped shirts and black shorts to show that Malmö FF was a new, independent club. This <b>colour</b> <b>combination</b> has on occasion been used in modern times as the away kit. The present sky-blue kit was introduced in 1920. Since 2010 a small Scanian flag is featured on the back of the shirt just below the neck.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} and {{effective}} colours are red, yellow, black and white. These colours provide strong contrast with green foliage, resist changes in shadow and lighting, have strong contrast, are highly chromatic, and provide distance dependent camouflage. Some forms of warning colouration provide this distance dependent camouflage by having an effective pattern and <b>colour</b> <b>combination</b> that do not allow for easy detection by a predator from a distance, but are warning-like from a close proximity, allowing for an advantageous balance between camouflage and aposematism. Warning colouration evolves in response to background, light conditions, and predator vision. Visible signals may be accompanied by odours, sounds or behaviour to provide a multi-modal signal which is more effectively detected by predators.|$|E

40|$|Although {{there is}} a large body of {{literature}} on research into colour in human-computer interaction, {{the overwhelming majority of the}} literature emphasises the cognition by computer users. However, colour is also important in this interaction when users manually type data into a computer. This paper investigates the effect of <b>colour</b> <b>combinations</b> on manual data typing. To this end, three experiments were conducted where the subjects were requested to read several texts with different <b>colour</b> <b>combinations</b> and re-type them in the same screen. Typing accuracy and speed is measured as the dependent variable across different <b>colour</b> <b>combinations.</b> Three experiments were conducted as such. In the first experiment, display and input windows were close to each other and in the second one they were located in the opposite ends of the screen. The third experiment was a subset of the first one with reversed foreground and background colours. It was found that different <b>colour</b> <b>combinations</b> had varying effects on data typing performance and proximity of the display and input windows was not a significant factor for typing accuracy in a 17 -inch screen. The effect of reversing the foreground and background colours was inconclusive with the <b>colour</b> <b>combinations</b> used...|$|R

5|$|The Welsh Springer Spaniel is a {{breed of}} dog {{and a member}} of the spaniel family. Thought to be {{comparable}} to the old Land Spaniel, they are similar to the English Springer Spaniel and historically have been referred to as both the Welsh Spaniel and the Welsh Cocker Spaniel. They were relatively unknown until a succession of victories in dog trials by the breed increased its popularity. Following recognition by The Kennel Club in 1902, the breed gained the modern name of Welsh Springer Spaniel. The breed's coat only comes in a single <b>colour</b> <b>combination</b> of white with red markings, usually in a piebald pattern. Loyal and affectionate, they can become very attached to family members and are wary of strangers. Health conditions are limited to those common among many breeds of dog, although they are affected more than average by hip dysplasia and some eye conditions. They are a working dog, bred for hunting, and while not as rare as some varieties of spaniel, they are rarer than the more widely known English Springer Spaniel with which they are sometimes confused.|$|E

25|$|At {{the start}} of the new 1912–13 Southern League Division One season, Portsmouth changed to a 'new' military-looking theme of navy blue shirts, white shorts and black socks. This was to become Portsmouth's home strip <b>colour</b> <b>combination</b> until {{the start of}} the 1947–48 season, when the socks were changed to red; this coincided with the club's most {{successful}} period and has remained the favoured colours {{for the majority of the}} time since.|$|E
25|$|The {{uniform of}} the Gendarmerie has {{undergone}} many changes since {{the establishment of the}} corps. Throughout most of the 19th century a wide bicorne was worn with a dark blue coat or tunic. Trousers were light blue. White aiguillettes were a distinguishing feature. In 1905 the bicorne was replaced by a dark blue kepi with white braiding, which had increasingly been worn as a service headdress. A silver crested helmet with plume, modelled on that of the French cuirassiers was adopted as a parade headdress until 1914. Following World War I a relatively simple uniform was adopted for the Gendarmerie, although traditional features such as the multiple-cord aiguillette and the dark blue/light blue <b>colour</b> <b>combination</b> were retained.|$|E

40|$|A {{common goal}} for {{designers}} is to deliver an intentional {{message from the}} sender to the intended receivers via design. !e design can be constructed to be a crystal-clear and interesting model that viewers can easily and immediately understand. However, some designs are intricate, complex, and layered in detail, and these require more e"ort {{on the part of}} the viewer if they are to understand the design messages. During the design process, designers pass through several stages that a"ect the design outcome. One of these key stages is the colouring process. Colour has the power to make or break the design intention. In addition, colour can either add complexity to the design by the use of di"erent colour contrasts, or help simplify a complex design form. !is research investigates the e"ect of <b>colour</b> <b>combinations</b> on simple and complex design appearance, with regard to the e"ects of contrast when colours are juxtaposed in a design. !e aim of the research is to identify which colour contrast a"ects the simplicity and complexity of a design’s appearance. !e research demonstrates how design form could be evaluated di"erently in terms of the use of di"erent <b>colour</b> <b>combinations.</b> !e research uses applied experimental methods to analyze participant responses to <b>colour</b> <b>combinations.</b> It reveals the result of the study by describing the signs of simple and complex <b>colour</b> <b>combinations</b> and the e"ect of colour on di"erent designs. !e research also proposes methods for increasing or decreasing the level of complexity of a design solution by using di"erent <b>colour</b> <b>combinations</b> with their associated e"ects on the diversity of colour contrast. All of this information is used to create a design tool which will help designers and students to make colour choices which are more suited to the design solution...|$|R

25|$|Since the team's inception, {{the same}} <b>colour</b> <b>combination</b> for home shirts {{have been used}} each year. The colour scheme of orange shirts, shorts and socks was {{selected}} to reflect the famous local product of Shizuoka Prefecture; the mikan. The current bright orange hue, named S-Pulse Orange by the club, {{is the result of}} a gentle evolution from a more yellow/orange shade during the team's early years. At the advent of the J. League, S-Pulse were the only top division club in the country to wear orange, a distinction which is now shared with other top flight mainstays, such as Albirex Niigata and Omiya Ardija. There is currently no third kit. Goalkeeping colours have changed more over the seasons, with the current first choice kit all black, and all green being the second choice.|$|E
25|$|There are six central pieces {{which show}} one {{coloured}} face, twelve edge pieces which show two coloured faces, and eight corner pieces which show three coloured faces. Each piece shows a unique <b>colour</b> <b>combination,</b> {{but not all}} combinations are present (for example, if red and orange are {{on opposite sides of}} the solved Cube, there is no edge piece with both red and orange sides). The location of these cubes relative to one another can be altered by twisting an outer third of the Cube 90°, 180° or 270°, but the location of the coloured sides relative to one another in the completed state of the puzzle cannot be altered: it is fixed by the relative positions of the centre squares. However, Cubes with alternative colour arrangements also exist; for example, with the yellow face opposite the green, the blue face opposite the white, and red and orange remaining opposite each other.|$|E
25|$|Donegal play {{since their}} {{foundation}} in {{green and gold}} kits, which are also the colours of the board's logo and of the county crest because they recall the gold of the sandy beaches of the county and the green of the well known Hills of Donegal. Despite the colours have been always the same during the years, their disposal has been very different {{for much of the}} team's history. The classic Donegal kit was indeed composed by a green shirt with a golden hoop, white shorts and green and yellow socks (identical to Kerry). In 1966 the board opted for golden shirts but they turned green after only a short period, in the 80's also often with green shorts. In 1992, when they reached the semifinal against Mayo, they had to use a change kit which was a yellow shirt with green sleeves and green shorts. Due to the unexpected victory against the favorite Connacht side, they decided to retain this <b>colour</b> <b>combination</b> for the final against Dublin. Donegal won their first All-Ireland title and since then they have favoured a yellow/gold shirt and green shorts.|$|E

25|$|All {{ambulances}} are to {{be equipped}} with highly reflective green and yellow 'checkerboard' markings (the English term is 'Battenburg' pattern), of specified proportions, running {{the entire length of}} the vehicle. The intent of this measure was to provide specific 'visual identities' for emergency vehicles, by reserving this pattern for ambulances, blue and yellow Battenburg for police cars, and red and yellow Battenburg for fire service vehicles. In addition, all lettering on the vehicle is required to be highly reflective, in order to boost vehicle visibility in all conditions. The <b>colour</b> <b>combination</b> selected was chosen for specific reasons. Under night time conditions, green is among the most visible (exceeded only by blue) of colours, creating high visibility (and safety) for ambulance vehicles. Unfortunately, for many of those who suffer from colour-blindness, neither green nor red is visible, washing out to shades of grey or dark yellow. In fact, almost 99 percent of all colour vision deficiency involves some form of red-green colour blindness, and includes an estimated 7-10 percent of all males, depending on location. However, even for these individuals, the colour yellow is always visible (see diagram). The resulting pattern is both high visibility and eye-catching for the average person, provides improved night time visibility for most, and provides a combination which is identifiable, at least in part, by the majority of the population.|$|E

2500|$|The {{national}} team's home kit {{has always}} been a white shirt, black shorts, and white socks. The colours are derived from the 19th-century flag of the North German State of Prussia. Since 1988, many of the home kit's designs incorporate details patterned after the modern German flag (with the noted exception of the 2002 World Cup kit, which was a reversal to the pure black-and-white scheme). For the 2014 World Cup, the German team used white shorts rather than the traditional black due to FIFA's kit clashing rule for the tournament. The away shirt colour has changed several times. Historically, green shirt with white shorts is the most often used alternative <b>colour</b> <b>combination,</b> derived from the DFB colours– though it is often erroneously reported that the choice is in recognition of the fact that Ireland, whose home shirts are green, were the first nation to play Germany in a friendly game after World War II.
