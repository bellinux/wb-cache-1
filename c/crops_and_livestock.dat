Maize, potatoes, {{sweet potatoes and}} manioc were the key crops that spread from the New World to the Old, while varieties of wheat, barley, rice and turnips traveled from the Old World to the New. There had been few livestock species in the New World, with horses, cattle, sheep and goats being completely unknown before their arrival with Old World settlers.

With {{much of the}} island's <b>crops</b> <b>and</b> <b>livestock</b> washed away, including 40 percent of the season's banana produce, the agricultural sector suffered J$576.5 million (US$6.8million) in losses. The storm had a discernible impact on the environment, which {{plays a crucial role}} in the Jamaica's economy and tourism sectors. Surface runoff and spills along industrial zones and sewage systems infiltrated large stretches of land, leading to soil contamination, coastal erosion, and deteriorated ecosystems.

5|$|Throughout Cape Verde, Hurricane Fred {{displaced}} {{more than}} 50families and caused CVE$250million ($2.5million) in damage, {{mostly to the}} agricultural and private sectors of the Barlavento region. It was the first hurricane {{to move through the}} islands with documented impacts, as well as the nation's only record of onshore hurricane-force winds. Although there were no casualties on land, two fishermen navigating through the storm never returned to port in Boa Vista and were presumed dead. Despite the losses in <b>crops</b> <b>and</b> <b>livestock,</b> rainfall from Fred had a generally positive effect on the larger-scale agriculture of the islands, refilling many rivers and dams and irrigating drought-stricken farmland across the Sotavento region.|$|E
5|$|Flooding and {{landslides}} in Jamaica {{took their}} toll on property, agricultural interests, and infrastructure; fruit growers on the island sustained about $2.5 million (1935 USD) in losses. Just off the coast, an unidentified vessel went down with her entire crew in the hostile conditions. Strong winds buffeted coastal sections of Cuba, notably in and around Santiago de Cuba. There, the hurricane demolished 100 homes and filled streets with debris. Only four {{people died in the}} country, thanks to the extensive pre-storm preparations. The storm did the most damage along the Tiburon Peninsula of southwestern Haiti, where catastrophic river flooding took the lives of up to 2,000 individuals, razed hundreds of native houses, and destroyed <b>crops</b> <b>and</b> <b>livestock.</b> The heaviest destruction took place around the towns of Jacmel and Jérémie; one early report estimated that 1,500 had been killed at the latter.

5|$|Making {{landfall}} {{near the}} border between Mexico and British Honduras, the latter colony's Corozal and Orange Walk districts, containing a population of 15,500at the time, experienced severe devastation from Janet. Strong hurricane winds knocked down and damaged numerous trees across British Honduras, particularly in the Freshwater Creek Forest Preserve. There, an estimated 30%of all trees had been damaged, especially mahogany and sapodilla trees. Hurricane Janet also caused extensive damage to crops, with an estimated $2.631million in damages. Fruit trees, maize, and sugar cane crops suffered the most damage. Sugar cane was {{expected to have a}} 20%decrease in yield due to the damage sustained after the storm. Pineapple <b>crops</b> <b>and</b> <b>livestock</b> experienced less significant losses. To a lesser extent, the hurricane also affected the Belize District and several of British Honduras' offshore cayes.

5|$|The soils {{in which}} plants grow are {{inhabited}} by microbial communities, with one gram of soil containing around 109-1010 microbial cells which comprise about one gigabase of sequence information. The microbial communities which inhabit soils {{are some of}} the most complex known to science, and remain poorly understood despite their economic importance. Microbial consortia perform a wide variety of ecosystem services necessary for plant growth, including fixing atmospheric nitrogen, nutrient cycling, disease suppression, and sequester iron and other metals. Functional metagenomics strategies are being used to explore the interactions between plants and microbes through cultivation-independent study of these microbial communities. By allowing insights into the role of previously uncultivated or rare community members in nutrient cycling and the promotion of plant growth, metagenomic approaches can contribute to improved disease detection in <b>crops</b> <b>and</b> <b>livestock</b> and the adaptation of enhanced farming practices which improve crop health by harnessing the relationship between microbes and plants.|$|E
5|$|Under {{threat from}} the {{hurricane}}, all of Cape Verde was placed under a hurricane warning {{for the first time}} in the nation's history. Gale-force winds battered much of the Barlavento region throughout August31, downing trees and utility poles. On the easternmost islands of Boa Vista and Sal, Fred leveled roofs and left several villages without power or phone services for a few days. About 70percent of the houses in Povoação Velha suffered light to moderate damage. Across the northernmost islands, rainstorms flooded homes, washed out roads, and ruined farmland; São Nicolau endured great losses of <b>crops</b> <b>and</b> <b>livestock.</b> Material damage across Cape Verde totaled US$2.5million, though the rain's overall impact on agriculture was positive and replenishing. Swells from the hurricane produced violent seas along the West African shoreline, destroying fishing villages and submerging swaths of residential areas in Senegal. Between the coasts of West Africa and Cape Verde, maritime incidents related to Fred resulted in nine deaths.|$|E

40|$|Despite {{the fact}} that many {{smallholder}} farming systems in developing countries revolve around the interactions of <b>crop</b> <b>and</b> <b>livestock</b> enterprises, the modelling of these systems using combinations of detailed <b>crop</b> <b>and</b> <b>livestock</b> models is comparatively underdeveloped.

Even where there is adequate understanding of the biophysical processes involved, integrated crop-livestock models may be constrained by lack of reliable data for calibration and validation. The construction from scratch of simulation models that meet the needs of one particular case is generally too costly to countenance. As for all modelling activity, {{the most efficient way to}} proceed depends on the nature of the systems under study and the precise questions that have to be addressed.

40|$|This study {{measured}} the economic impacts {{of climate change}} on <b>crop</b> <b>and</b> <b>livestock</b> farming in Africa based on a cross-sectional survey of over 8000 farming households from 11 countries in east, west, north and southern Africa. The response of net revenue from <b>crop</b> <b>and</b> <b>livestock</b> agriculture across various farm types and systems in Africa to changes in climate normals (i. e. mean rainfall and temperature) is analysed. The analyses controlled for effects of key socioeconomic, technology, soil and hydrological factors influencing agricultural production. Results show that net farm revenues are in general negatively affected by warmer and drier climates. The small-scale mixed <b>crop</b> <b>and</b> <b>livestock</b> system predominantly typical in Africa is the most tolerant whereas specialized crop production is the most vulnerable to warming and lower rainfall. These results have important policy implications, especially for the suitability of the increasing tendency toward large-scale mono-cropping strategies for agricultural development in Africa {{and other parts of}} the developing world in light of expected climate changes.

5|$|While Nicole was intensifying offshore, {{its outer}} bands {{produced}} heavy downpours over drought-stricken Cuba. Rain quantities were particularly high along the southeastern coast; a 48-hour total of 9.22inches (235mm) fell at Cape Cruz, in the mountainous Granma Province. The region also briefly observed gale-force winds, with gusts to 53mph (85km/h) at Guantánamo Bay. Throughout eastern Cuba, nearly 300people sought {{refuge from the}} storm. As the rivers in Granma overflowed, eighthouses collapsed and more than 300others were inundated in the coastal town of Pilón. The flooding obstructed several roads, with sections of the highway between Granma and Santiago de Cuba destroyed. The storm resulted in 5,000lbs (2.5tons) of lost <b>crops</b> <b>and</b> <b>livestock.</b> These effects were nevertheless considered to be minor when viewed against the alleviation of a persistent dry spell provided by the rains.|$|E

40|$|In West Africa, crop-livestock {{mixed farming}} is {{emerging}} from the currently predominant nomadic pastoralism and agropastoralism.
