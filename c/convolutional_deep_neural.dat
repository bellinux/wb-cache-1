One {{of the main}} challenges in training these networks is data imbalance, which is particularly problematic in medical imaging applications such as lesion segmentation where the number of lesion voxels is often {{much lower than the}} number of non-lesion voxels. Training with unbalanced data can lead to predictions that are severely biased towards high precision but low recall (sensitivity), which is undesired especially in medical applications where false negatives are much less tolerable than false positives. Several methods have been proposed to deal with this problem including balanced sampling, two step training, sample re-weighting, and similarity loss functions.

Significant {{advancement}} {{of research on}} image classification and object detection has been achieved in the past decade. <b>Deep</b> <b>convolutional</b> <b>neural</b> networks have exhibited superior performance in many visual recognition tasks including image classification, object detection, and scene labeling, due to their large learning capacity and resistance to overfit. However, learning a robust deep CNN model for object recognition is still quite challenging because image classification and object detection is a severely unbalanced large-scale problem. In this dissertation, we aim at improving the performance of image classification and object detection algorithms {{by taking advantage of}} <b>deep</b> <b>convolutional</b> <b>neural</b> networks by utilizing the following strategies: We introduce <b>Deep</b> <b>Neural</b> Pattern, a local feature densely extracted from an image with arbitrary resolution using a well trained <b>deep</b> <b>convolutional</b> <b>neural</b> network. We propose a latent CNN framework, which will automatically select the most discriminate region in the image to reduce the effect of irrelevant regions. We also develop a new combination scheme for multiple CNNs via Latent Model Ensemble to overcome the local minima problem of CNNs. In addition, a weakly supervised CNN framework, referred to as Multiple Instance Learning Convolutional Neural Networks is developed to alleviate strict label requirements. Finally, a novel residual-network architecture, Residual networks of Residual networks, is constructed to improve the optimization ability of very <b>deep</b> <b>convolutional</b> <b>neural</b> networks. All the proposed algorithms are validated by thorough experiments and have shown solid accuracy on large scale object detection and recognition benchmarks.

Each Crescendo block contains independent convolution paths with increased depths. The numbers of convolution layers and parameters are only increased linearly in Crescendo blocks. In experiments, CrescendoNet with only 15 layers outperforms almost all networks without residual connections on benchmark datasets, CIFAR 10, CIFAR 100, and SVHN. Given sufficient amount of data as in SVHN dataset, CrescendoNet with 15 layers and 4. 1 M parameters can match the performance of DenseNet-BC with 250 layers and 15. 3 M parameters. CrescendoNet provides {{a new way to}} construct high performance <b>deep</b> <b>convolutional</b> <b>neural</b> networks without residual connections.
