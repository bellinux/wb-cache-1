50|$|The {{protection}} of sources, sometimes {{also referred to}} as the <b>confidentiality</b> <b>of</b> <b>sources</b> or in the U.S. as the reporter's privilege, is a right accorded to journalists under the laws of many countries, as well as under international law. It prohibits authorities, including the courts, from compelling a journalist to reveal the identity of an anonymous source for a story. The right is based on a recognition that without a strong guarantee of anonymity, many would be deterred from coming forward and sharing information of public interests with journalists. As a result, problems such as corruption or crime might go undetected and unchallenged, to the ultimate detriment of society as a whole. In spite of any such legal protections, the pervasive use of traceable electronic communications by journalists and their sources provides governments with a tool to determine the origin of information. In the United States, the federal government legally contends that no such protection exists for journalists.|$|E

The Commission also recommended that a provision be added to the legislation which requires all agencies to act only in accordance with human rights values when exercising their search and surveillance powers. A purpose clause was included by the Justice and Electoral Committee to ensure that existing rights found in the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990, the Privacy Act 1993 and the Evidence Act 2006 are all recognized.

This study investigates protections Hong Kong residents feel should be extended to the media all the time. First, protections such as joumalistic criticism of political leaders and the military, <b>confidentiality</b> <b>of</b> <b>sources,</b> and other specific situations are tested. Second, commercial (advertising) free speech protections are tested including advertising of false or misleading claims, illegal products, pornographic or obscence material, and legal but potential harmful products. Third, protection of media programming dealing with sexual themes, showing sexual acts, showing nudity, and promoting drug use are tested.

40|$|Executive summary The {{enduring}} {{success of}} Australia’s democracy rests on many vital foundations including a free press, informed and diverse debate, {{the rule of}} law, free and fair elections, active civil society and the checks and balances provided by courts and other institutions. Yet, despite Australia’s strong democratic history, {{there is a clear}} and disturbing trend of new laws and practices eroding many of these foundations. Federal and state governments have stepped up efforts to avoid scrutiny, reduce transparency and limit accountability in order to expand government power, advantage political elites and advance the interests of business. Governments are using a range of funding levers to stifle advocacy by non-government organisations that represent vulnerable minorities. Environmental groups who challenge the fossil fuel industry are facing threats to their financial viability though attempts to remove their charity tax concessions. A number of states have enacted excessive and unnecessary anti-protest laws that prioritise business and political interests over protest rights. Whistleblowers who expose even the most serious human rights abuses against children now face unprecedented risks of reprisals including prosecution and jail. Press freedom is being eroded by new laws and policies jeopardising journalists’ ability to maintain the <b>confidentiality</b> <b>of</b> <b>sources</b> and to report on matters of public interest. All the while, in critical areas governments are undermining or sidelining the courts and institutions like the Australian Human Rights Commission, the nation’s human rights watchdog, that were created to keep them in check. The success of Australia’s democracy relies on much more than the ability of adults to cast a free vote on election day. For our democracy to thrive, we need free speech, the free flow of information and a free press to hold government accountable and to inform peoples’ voting decisions. We {{need to be able to}} organise and protest on issues that concern us. We need an environment in which civil society can effectively participate. We need institutions, organisations and practices to prevent and expose misconduct and abuse of power; to ensure that government and elected representatives act in the best interests of the Australian public instead of prioritising powerful business and political interests; and to ensure that the interests of vulnerable minority groups are represented in policy debates. These are not only our human rights but they are vital preconditions to the health and prosperity of our democracy and our nation. We must arrest this trend that is eroding many of the vital foundations of our democracy and we must strengthen these foundations. This report outlines a way forward...|$|E

40|$|EXECUTIVE SUMMARY In Task 4. 2, {{entitled}} “Citizens’ Involvement and Ethics”, COSMIC {{seeks to}} examine the opportunities, risks (threats), and ethical issues that are brought about by utilization of new media technologies during crises. Additionally, through this task, COSMIC aims to detail the potential consequences, for individuals and the society, of the threats and ethical issues that arise from utilization of new media technologies during crisis. With respect to the opportunities that new media technologies present in crisis management, this report (chapter 2) argues that such technologies can potentially enhance mobilization of and coordination among various stakeholders during a crisis. The report also argues that realization of this potential hinge {{on the extent to}} which new media technologies are consistently and widely adopted during emergencies. Namely, the report recommends, 	Development of industry efforts oriented towards increasing the interoperability of new media solutions for emergency response. 	Increasing the extent to which technological solutions to crisis management trickle down to local response units and the public by prioritizing the development of technology solutions that are compatible with existing consumer-grade devices, such as smart phones or tablets. 	Enhancing stakeholders’ understanding of the mechanisms through which use of new media technologies can enhance community resilience. Regarding the threats that the use of new media technologies during crises may bring to various stakeholders, this report (chapter 3), focuses on three types of threats. First the report discusses threats to security of citizens that may result from their being recorded in ways that lead to invasion of their privacy and exposure of their identity. Second, the report outlines how citizen journalists may put themselves in harm’s way while trying to capture a noteworthy moment during a crisis. Third, the report argues that sharing sensitive information about tactical choices made by response units may threaten not only effectiveness of emergency response efforts but also the safety of the responders. In this light, COSMIC’s recommendations emphasize two related goals: 	More education and training of stakeholders, including citizens, in order to increase awareness of threats created by sharing information in online networks, and awareness of methods that can be used to protect the privacy and physical safety of individuals, as victims, witnesses, and journalists, involved in a crisis. 	Making sure that stakeholders, and particularly mass and online media outlets, develop universally accepted guidelines that prevent the publication or transmission of content that puts individuals and the public at risk. The chapter on ethical concerns that arise from utilization of new media technologies for information dissemination during crises (chapter 4) focuses on several related issues. First, using two brief case studies from Istanbul (one from 1955 and one from 2013), we illustrate how the use of mass media and/or social media to exploit public’s sentiments at times of crisis may lead to increased animosity within a society. Second, using a case from Virginia Tech Shootings, we discuss how a rush for providing coverage of an emergency may create ethical problems when journalists (or citizen journalists) exploit their position to quickly reach conclusions about the events. Third, we discuss censorship and surveillance as mechanisms that may impede the ability of citizens to share and have access to information. Fourth, we further extend the discussions provided in the previous sections of chapter 4 to provide an indepth focus on two ethical issues concerning citizen journalism: 1) reliability of information and 2) confidentiality of news sources. The discussion of these ethical issues concerning the use of new media technologies for information dissemination at times of crisis underlines several important measures that need to be taken: 	Promotion of the widespread use of tools that can help individuals counter surveillance and bypass censorship. This can be achieved by standardizing and simplifying such tools for the general public. 	Adoption of detailed verification practices both before disseminating information and while consuming it. 	Dissemination of information verification guidelines to the wider public. 	Enhancing collaboration between citizen journalists and traditional journalism institutions to improve information verification processes for citizen journalists. 	Developing policies that will help recognize citizen journalism as a form of journalism that is entitled to privileges, such as <b>confidentiality</b> <b>of</b> <b>sources,</b> that professional journalists are entitled to. Concerning the potential consequences of the threats and ethical issues discussed in the report, chapter 5 of the report focuses on three main topics. First, we discuss how misinformation and rumours increase the level of panic in public during times of crisis. This may, in turn, increase political and economic volatility as well as threatening the safety of citizens. Second, we focus on implications of lateral surveillance and vigilante activities and argue that such activities will disproportionately harm certain segments of the population, like racial minorities. Third, we detail the potential implications of utilization of social media, which enhance individuals’ ability to engage in selective exposure. Namely, we describe how use of social media may contribute to the increased polarization of factions within a society. In the light of these discussions regarding the implications of the ethical issues and threats related to use of new media technologies during crises, we recommend the following: 	Information provided by formal sources regarding the progress that is being made about an incident and suggestions about how the public may protect themselves from a potential risk may help mitigate the adverse impact of rumours. 	Particularly at times of political conflicts, increasing the availability of media outlets that can play a mediating role between different factions is a necessary condition for reducing polarization in a given society...|$|E
40|$|As sensor-driven {{applications}} {{become increasingly}} integrated into our lives, {{issues related to}} sensor privacy will become increasingly important. Although many privacy-related issues can be addressed by security mechanisms, one sensor network privacy issue that cannot be adequately addressed by network security is <b>confidentiality</b> <b>of</b> the <b>source</b> sensor’s location. In this paper, we focus on protecting the source’s location by introducing suitable modifications to sensor routing protocols to {{make it difficult for}} an adversary to backtrack to the origin of the sensor communication. In particular, we focus on the class of flooding protocols. While developing and evaluating our privacy-aware routing protocols, we jointly consider issues of location-privacy as well as the amount of energy consumed by the sensor network. Motivated by the observations, we propose a flexible routing strategy, known as phantom routing, which protects the source’s location. Phantom routing is a two-stage routing scheme that first consists of a directed walk along a random direction, followed by routing from the phantom source to the sink. Our investigations have shown that phantom routing is a powerful technique for protecting the location <b>of</b> the <b>source</b> during sensor transmissions...|$|R
40|$|In {{the digital}} age, {{the news media}} gives voice to {{anonymous}} speakers in two ways: reporters may extend confidentiality to sources in exchange for newsworthy information, or a news website may host an online comment function that allows readers to post their reactions to content pseudonymously.

The reporter's privilege has always been legally defined as the professional privilege of a reporter to maintain the <b>confidentiality</b> <b>of</b> his <b>sources.</b> Yet as with all evidentiary privileges, the reporter's privilege serves {{both private and public}} ends. Historically, state statutes and state common law have protected the private arrangement that enables sources to disclose information without fear of reprisal, and journalists to gain newsworthy content, because this relationship furthers the free flow of information to the public.

40|$|The {{thought of}} going to jail for doing nothing more than your job is not an “attractive proposition,” and given the {{important}} role the media plays in Australia’s democratic system, the imprisonment of journalists sits uncomfortably with law makers and the public, but is the risk Australian journalists take when compiling news stories on an ‘off the record’ basis.

40|$|Usability {{testing methods}} are {{nowadays}} {{integrated into the}} design and development of health-care software, {{and the need for}} usability in health-care information technology (IT) is widely accepted by clinicians and researchers. Usability assessment starts with the identification of specific objectives that need to be tested and continues with the definition of evaluation criteria and monitoring procedures before usability tests are performed to assess the quality of all services and tasks. Such a process is implemented in the p-medicine environment and gives feedback iteratively to all software developers in the project. GCP (good clinical practice) criteria require additional usability testing of the software. For the p-medicine project (www. p-medicine. eu), an extended usability concept (EUC) was developed. The EUC covers topics like ease of use, likeability, and usefulness, usability in trial centres characterised by a mixed care and research environment and by extreme time constraints, <b>confidentiality,</b> use <b>of</b> <b>source</b> documents, standard operating procedures (SOA), and quality control during data handling to ensure that all data are reliable and have been processed correctly in terms of accuracy, completeness, legibility, consistence, and timeliness.

40|$|Digital {{technologies}} have fundamentally altered how journalists {{communicate with their}} sources, enabling them to exchange information through social media as well as video, audio, and text chat. Simultaneously, journalists are increasingly concerned with corporate and government surveillance {{as a threat to}} their ability to speak with sources in confidence and to conduct basic reporting. In response, some U. S. journalists are learning information security techniques as well as nontechnical approaches to source protection and slowing surveillance. I conducted thirty interviews with journalists and press advocates to learn about their information security practices and their perceptions of the impediments that government and corporate surveillance impose on their ability to complete their work. I found that most of the time, journalists had routine sources who did not require strict confidentiality. However, journalists expressed deep concerns regarding the <b>confidentiality</b> <b>of</b> their <b>sources</b> when working on sensitive stories and when their sources place themselves at risk. While I found the journalists shared widespread concerns about surveillance, they also had diverse and inconsistent approaches to their digital security. When conducting sensitive work, some journalists shared experiences about speaking with their sources over encrypted channels, avoiding cell phones, or avoiding commercial phone and Web services that could be subpoenaed for their user data. To minimize their electronic records {{and for the sake of}} convenience, many of the journalists have been meeting sensitive sources in person whenever possible. However, unless absolutely necessary, many journalists preferred to speak with sources through the most convenient communication channels—for example, text messages and phone calls—even when they were concerned about issues <b>of</b> <b>confidentiality.</b> Even in stereotypically sensitive reporting (e. g., national security), the journalists would often forgo comprehensive security measures to speak with their sources.

In contrast, previous research has been based on small, nonrepresentative samples, usually in one or a few locations or limited to visits to either private doctors or clinics, but not both; been limited to teenagers; or had no multivariate analysis. This study overcomes those limitations. When other variables were controlled, race, income, and insurance coverage had important effects on provider choice; marital status was important for white women, but not for black women. Contraceptive method, insurance coverage, and race were important determinants of the frequency of family planning visits, independent of other variables. It is suggested that relative costs or ability to pay, <b>confidentiality,</b> knowledge <b>of</b> alternative <b>sources,</b> and convenience <b>of</b> location affect choice of provider and visit rates...|$|R

In 1631, The´ophraste Renaudot launched the first periodical paper, La Gazette. The first daily newspaper appeared in 1777 : Le Journal de Paris. In 1830 s, France became {{known as one of the}} three pioneers of the modern daily press in Europe. At that time, the newspaper industry was very innovative. For instance, the French penny press based on a new business model was introduced by journalist entrepreneurs Emile de Girardin and Armand Dutacq. They founded La Presse and Le Sie`cle in June and July 1836 respectively. These mass newspapers offered a content mixing news, romanfeuilleton and commercials. Due to the mass production, they could offer a lower subscription price (Eveno, 2003). In 1863, Moı¨se Millaud launched Le Petit Journal. It used an innovative business model based on the use of modern printingmachine (de la Motte and Przyblyski, 1999). In the turmoil after World War II (1944 – 1947), the evolution of the printed press was influenced by the intervention of the French government. The government decided to set conditions on the structure of the newspaper market with strong constraints. Although France played an important role in the development of the press and freedom of the press for centuries, it does not have a leading position anymore. France is ranked 38 th in the world regarding the press freedom index (Reporters Sans Frontières, 2015). The main reason for this position is that France does not provide effective protection for the <b>confidentiality</b> <b>of</b> journalists’ <b>source...</b>|$|R
