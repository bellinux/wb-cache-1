5|$|On July 14, 2017, McCain {{underwent}} a minimally invasive <b>craniotomy</b> at Mayo Clinic Hospital in Phoenix, Arizona, {{in order to}} remove a blood clot above his left eye. His absence prompted Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to delay {{a vote on the}} Better Care Reconciliation Act. Five days later, Mayo Clinic doctors announced that the laboratory results from the surgery confirmed the presence of a glioblastoma, which is a very aggressive brain tumor. Standard treatment options for this tumor include chemotherapy and radiation, although even with treatment, average survival time is approximately 14 months. McCain is a survivor of previous cancers, including melanoma.|$|E
5|$|Pituitary tumors require {{treatment}} {{when they}} are causing specific symptoms, such as headaches, visual field defects or excessive hormone secretion. Transsphenoidal surgery (removal of the tumor by an operation through the nose and the sphenoidal sinuses) may, apart from addressing symptoms related to the tumor, also improve pituitary function, although the gland is sometimes damaged further {{as a result of}} the surgery. When the tumor is removed by <b>craniotomy</b> (opening the skull), recovery is less likely–but sometimes this is the only suitable way to approach the tumor. After surgery, it may take some time for hormone levels to change significantly. Retesting the pituitary hormone levels is therefore performed 2 to 3 months later.|$|E
5|$|Surgery (by <b>craniotomy,</b> open brain surgery) may {{be offered}} {{based on the}} risks of {{treatment}} {{as determined by the}} Spetzler–Martin scale (grade I-V); this score is higher in larger lesions that are close to important brain structures and have deep venous drainage. High grade lesions (IV and V) have an unacceptably high risk and surgery is not typically offered in those cases. Radiosurgery (using targeted radiation therapy such as by a gamma knife) may be used if the lesion is small but close to vital structures. Finally, embolization may be used on small lesions that have only a single feeding vessel.|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{determine}} {{the rate of}} surgical-site infections (SSI) in neurosurgical procedures involving a shared-resource intraoperative magnetic resonance imaging (ioMRI) scanner at a single institution derived from a prospective clinical quality management database. METHODS: All consecutive neurosurgical procedures that were performed with a high-field, 2 -room ioMRI between April 2013 and June 2016 were included (N = 195; 109 <b>craniotomies</b> and 86 endoscopic transsphenoidal procedures). The incidence of SSIs within 3 months after surgery was assessed for both operative groups (<b>craniotomies</b> vs. transsphenoidal approach).

40|$|Electroencephalogram (EEG) entropy is {{a widely}} used monitor of depth of anaesthesia. We present a series of two cases of frontal <b>craniotomies</b> in which entropy {{monitoring}} was unreliable due to wide fluctuations.

We conclude that caution should be exercised in interpreting frontal EEG derived indices of the depth of anaesthesia in frontal <b>craniotomies...</b>|$|R
5|$|If a {{cerebral}} aneurysm is identified on angiography, two measures {{are available to}} reduce the risk of further bleeding from the same aneurysm: clipping and coiling. Clipping requires a <b>craniotomy</b> (opening of the skull) to locate the aneurysm, followed by the placement of clips around the neck of the aneurysm. Coiling is performed through the large blood vessels (endovascularly): a catheter is inserted into the femoral artery in the groin and advanced through the aorta to the arteries (both carotid arteries and both vertebral arteries) that supply the brain. When the aneurysm has been located, platinum coils are deployed that cause a blood clot to form in the aneurysm, obliterating it. The decision as to which treatment is undertaken is typically made by a multidisciplinary team consisting of a neurosurgeon, neuroradiologist, and often other health professionals.|$|E
5|$|Yang expresses {{difficulty}} {{connecting with}} the children on pediatrics, to Robbins' disappointment. Tom becomes frightened when he notices Lexie is not wearing a name tag, so she attacks her and runs away. His mother is subsequently diagnosed with an abdominal aortic aneurysm, for which requires surgery, and Tom falls down the stairs, for which also requires surgery. Dr. Callie Torres (Sara Ramirez) returns to the hospital, and informs Robbins that Yang is just sucking up. The Crawley's are uneasy about agreeing to surgery, but Dr. Miranda Bailey (Chandra Wilson) convinces them {{that it is the}} right thing to do. An obstetrics and gynecology resident accidentally cuts off a baby's arm during a caesarian section, but it is healed by plastic surgeon Dr. Mark Sloan (Eric Dane), Robbins, and Yang. Stevens assists Shepherd with a five-hour <b>craniotomy,</b> and Karev is fearful that she cannot handle it, although she is ultimately able to complete the surgery. At the conclusion of the episode, human resources sends out an email notifying Olivia Harper (Sarah Utterback) and Dr. Steve Mostow (Mark Saul)'s wife Megan (Molly Kidder), that they have been fired.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Craniotomies</b> {{were also}} used by {{surgeons}} to find the cause of death. This practice {{dates back to the}} thirteenth century. The Medicis, a powerful family in Florence during the Renaissance, had skulls that revealed <b>craniotomies</b> and autopsies had been performed. The procedure was also done on illegitimate members of the family and children. Every skeleton of the Medici family shows signs of embalming, a practice only done for the elite.|$|R
30|$|In addition, in a {{study by}} Korniek AM et al. {{including}} 4578 patients undergoing <b>craniotomies,</b> prophylactic antibiotics (cloxacillin or amoxicillin-clavulanate) decreased the incidence of SSI from 9.7 % to 5.8 % (p <[*] 0.0001) mainly by decreasing the incidence in clean <b>craniotomies</b> from 10.0 % to 4.6 % (p[*]<[*] 0.0001). The results supports our study though we used different antibiotics and the number of patients was much lower to detect a statistical significance (Korinek et al. 2005).|$|R
40|$|The main {{challenges}} for patients undergoing awake <b>craniotomies</b> include anxiety and fears, terrifying noises and surroundings, immobility, loss of control, {{and the feeling}} of helplessness and being left alone. In such situations, psychological support might be more helpful than the pharmacological approach. With adequate therapeutic communication, patients do not require any sedation and no or only low-dose opioid treatment during awake <b>craniotomies,</b> leaving patients fully awake and competent during the entire surgical procedure without stress. This approach can be termed "awake-awake-awake-technique"...|$|R
25|$|Depending on {{the size}} and deterioration, age of the patient, and {{anaesthetic}} risk posed, subdural hematomas occasionally require <b>craniotomy</b> for evacuation; most frequently, simple burr holes for drainage; often conservative treatment; and rarely, palliative treatment in patients of extreme age or with no chance of recovery.|$|E
25|$|Surgical {{clipping}} {{was introduced}} by Walter Dandy of the Johns Hopkins Hospital in 1937. It consists of a <b>craniotomy</b> to expose the aneurysm and closing the base or neck of the aneurysm with a clip. The surgical technique has been modified and improved over the years.|$|E
25|$|On January 1, 2014, she was {{diagnosed}} with grade 2 astrocytoma, a form of brain cancer, and had a partial <b>craniotomy</b> and a partial resection of her temporal lobe.

40|$|The {{effectiveness}} of antibiotic prophylaxis (AP) in <b>craniotomies</b> has been clarified through {{the accumulation of}} evidence and increased antibiotic knowledge. This paper focuses {{on the use of}} AP in <b>craniotomies</b> during different historical periods and collects highly relevant evidence on this issue. This review surveys different AP guidelines and explains why cefazolin was selected by most guidelines. Recent prominent topics, including strategies to update and implement guidelines and antibiotic efficacy in postoperative meningitis and surveillance and decolonization therapies for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, are discussed...|$|R
30|$|Nashimoto et al. further {{elaborated}} that lesions with concomitant supra-tentorial extension {{were associated}} with poorer prognosis and should ideally be managed with surgery (i.e., sub-occipital <b>craniotomies</b> and clot evacuation) [11].|$|R
40|$|Pediatric {{patients}} when undergoing <b>craniotomies</b> and craniofacial surgery may potentially {{have significant}} blood loss. The amount and extent will be {{dictated by the}} nature of the surgical procedure, the proximity to major blood vessels, and the age, and weight of the patient. The goals should be to maintain hemodynamic stability and oxygen carrying capacity and to prevent and treat hyperfibrinolysis and dilutional coagulopathy. Over transfusion and transfusion-related side effects should be minimized. This article will highlight the pertinent considerations for managing massive blood loss in pediatric patients undergoing <b>craniotomies</b> and craniofacial surgery. North American and European guidelines for intraoperative administration of fluid and blood products will be discussed...|$|R
25|$|Once diagnosed, {{the gap in}} the {{temporal}} bone can be repaired by surgical resurfacing of the affected bone or plugging of the superior semicircular canal. These techniques are performed by accessing the site of the dehiscence either via a middle fossa <b>craniotomy</b> or via a canal drilled through the transmastoid bone behind the affected ear. Bone cement has been the material most often used, in spite of its tendency to slippage and resorption, and a consequent high failure rate; recently, soft tissue grafts have been substituted.|$|E
25|$|Treatment of a {{subdural}} hematoma {{depends on}} its size and rate of growth. Some small subdural hematomas can be managed by careful monitoring until the body heals itself. Other small subdural hematomas can be managed by inserting a temporary small catheter through a hole drilled through the skull and sucking out the hematoma; this procedure can {{be done at the}} bedside. Large or symptomatic hematomas require a <b>craniotomy,</b> the surgical opening of the skull. A surgeon then opens the dura, removes the blood clot with suction or irrigation, and identifies and controls sites of bleeding. Postoperative complications include increased intracranial pressure, brain edema, new or recurrent bleeding, infection, and seizure. The injured vessels must be repaired.|$|E
25|$|Primidone and {{the other}} enzyme-inducing {{anticonvulsants}} can cut the half-life of antipyrine roughly in half (6.2 ± 1.9 h vs. 11.2 ± 4.2 h), and increases the clearance rate by almost 70%. Phenobarbital reduces the half-life to 4.8 ± 1.3 and increases the clearance by almost 109%. It also interferes with the metabolism of dexamethasone, a synthetic steroid hormone, {{to the point where}} its withdrawal from the regimen of a 14-year-old living in the United Kingdom made her hypercortisolemic. Tempelhoff and colleagues at the Washington University School of Medicine's Department of Anesthesiology reported in 1990 that primidone and other anticonvulsant drugs increase the amount of fentanyl needed during <b>craniotomy</b> based on the patient's heart rate.|$|E
40|$|Summary: Median nerve {{somatosensory}} evoked potentials {{were recorded}} from exposed cerebral cortex during <b>craniotomies.</b> This technique is valuable when knowledge ofthe motor cortex location can influence surgical decisions about resection limits or biopsy sites. Two different recording techniques were compared: strips of electrodes and arrays of electrodes. The arrays recorded electrical potentials suitable for topographic mapping. We found that motor cortex {{could be identified}} more quickly when using the topographic mapping of SEPs from arrays. We conclude that opographic mapping of SEP from sensorimotor regions during <b>craniotomies</b> works well in general and can be done more quickly than the traditional e ectrode strip technique...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the incidence of seizures during the intraoperative monitoring of motor evoked potentials (MEPs) elicited by electrical brain stimulation in a wide spectrum of surgeries such as those of the orthopedic spine, spinal cord, and peripheral nerves, interventional radiology procedures, and <b>craniotomies</b> for supra- and infratentorial tumors and vascular lesions. METHODS The authors retrospectively analyzed data from 4179 consecutive patients who underwent surgery or an interventional radiology procedure with MEP monitoring. RESULTS Of 4179 patients, only 32 (0. 8 %) had 1 or more intraoperative seizures. The incidence of seizures in cranial procedures, including <b>craniotomies</b> and interventional neuroradiology, was 1. 8 %. In <b>craniotomies</b> in which transcranial electrical stimulation (TES) was applied to elicit MEPs, the incidence of seizures was 0. 7 % (6 / 850). When direct cortical stimulation was additionally applied, the incidence of seizures increased to 5. 4 % (23 / 422). Patients undergoing <b>craniotomies</b> for the excision of extraaxial brain tumors, particularly meningiomas (15 patients), exhibited the highest risk of developing an intraoperative seizure (16 patients). The incidence of seizures in orthopedic spine surgeries was 0. 2 % (3 / 1664). None of the patients who underwent surgery for conditions of the spinal cord, neck, or peripheral nerves or who underwent cranial or noncranial interventional radiology procedures had intraoperative seizures elicited by TES during MEP monitoring. CONCLUSIONS In this largest such study to date, the authors report the incidence of intraoperative seizures in patients who underwent MEP monitoring during a wide spectrum of surgeries such as those of the orthopedic spine, spinal cord, and peripheral nerves, interventional radiology procedures, and <b>craniotomies</b> for supra- and infratentorial tumors and vascular lesions. The low incidence of seizures induced by electrical brain stimulation, particularly short-train TES, demonstrates that MEP monitoring is a safe technique that should not be avoided due to the risk of inducing seizures...|$|R
25|$|In 1919, Weed and McKibben, {{biomedical}} {{researchers at}} Johns Hopkins Medical School, {{were the first}} ones to document the use and effect of osmotically active substances on brain mass. While studying transfer of salt solutions from blood to Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF), they first noted that concentrated sodium chloride intravenous (IV) injection led to collapse of the thecal sac which prevented them from withdrawing CSF from the lumbar cistern. In order to further study the effect, they conducted lab experiments on anesthetized cats which underwent <b>craniotomy.</b> They observed changes to the convexity of cat's brain upon IV injection, specifically, they noted that Hypertonic Saline IV injection resulted in maximum shrinkage of the brain in 15-30 mins, while administration of hypotonic solutions resulted in protrusion and rupture of the brain tissue. By 1927, use of osmotic agents in IV delivery became official.|$|E
25|$|If {{a patient}} with {{epilepsy}} is being considered for resective surgery, it is often necessary to localize the focus (source) of the epileptic brain activity with a resolution greater than what is provided by scalp EEG. This is because the cerebrospinal fluid, skull and scalp smear the electrical potentials recorded by scalp EEG. In these cases, neurosurgeons typically implant strips and grids of electrodes (or penetrating depth electrodes) under the dura mater, through either a <b>craniotomy</b> or a burr hole. The recording of these signals {{is referred to as}} electrocorticography (ECoG), subdural EEG (sdEEG) or intracranial EEG (icEEG)--all terms for the same thing. The signal recorded from ECoG is on a different scale of activity than the brain activity recorded from scalp EEG. Low voltage, high frequency components that cannot be seen easily (or at all) in scalp EEG can be seen clearly in ECoG. Further, smaller electrodes (which cover a smaller parcel of brain surface) allow even lower voltage, faster components of brain activity to be seen. Some clinical sites record from penetrating microelectrodes.|$|E
25|$|Secondary {{headaches}} {{are classified}} {{based on their}} cause and not on their symptoms. According to the ICHD-2 classification, the main types of secondary headaches include those that are due to head or neck trauma such as whiplash injury, intracranial hematoma, post <b>craniotomy</b> or other head or neck injury. Headaches caused by cranial or cervical vascular disorders such as ischemic stroke and transient ischemic attack, non-traumatic intracranial hemorrhage, vascular malformations or arteritis are also defined as secondary headaches. This type of headaches may also be caused by cerebral venous thrombosis or different intracranial vascular disorders. Other secondary headaches are those due to intracranial disorders that are not vascular such as low or high pressure of the cerebrospinal fluid pressure, non-infectious inflammatory disease, intracranial neoplasm, epileptic seizure or other types of disorders or diseases that are intracranial but that are not associated with the vasculature of the central nervous system. ICHD-2 classifies headaches that are caused by the ingestion of a certain substance or by its withdrawal as secondary headaches as well. This type of headache may result from the overuse of some medications or by exposure to some substances. HIV/AIDS, intracranial infections and systemic infections may also cause secondary headaches. The ICHD-2 system of classification includes the headaches associated with homeostasis disorders {{in the category of}} secondary headaches. This means that headaches caused by dialysis, high blood pressure, hypothyroidism, and cephalalgia and even fasting are considered secondary headaches. Secondary headaches, according to the same classification system, can also be due to the injury of any of the facial structures including teeth, jaws, or temporomandibular joint. Headaches caused by psychiatric disorders such as somatization or psychotic disorders are also classified as secondary headaches.|$|E
30|$|Postoperative {{meningitis}} {{and surgical}} site infections (SSI) is a challenging issue {{that may result}} in serious morbidity and mortality. This study aims at decreasing the incidence and identifying the causative pathogens of postoperative meningitis and SSI in patients undergoing <b>craniotomies.</b>|$|R
30|$|Surgical site {{infection}} (SSI) after <b>craniotomies</b> is {{a serious}} complication. The incidence is quiet variable between 0 and[*]>[*] 9.0 % (McClelland 2008; Bellusse et al. 2015).

40|$|Early archaeological records {{indicate}} that awake craniot-omies {{in the form}} of trephination were successfully prac-ticed long before the advent of general anesthesia.

500|$|Surgery can be {{performed}} on mass lesions or to eliminate objects that have penetrated the brain. Mass lesions such as contusions or [...] hematomas causing a significant mass effect (shift of intracranial structures) are considered emergencies and are removed surgically. For intracranial hematomas, the collected blood may be removed using suction or forceps {{or it may be}} floated off with water. Surgeons look for hemorrhaging blood vessels and seek to control bleeding. In penetrating brain injury, damaged tissue is surgically debrided, and <b>craniotomy</b> may be needed. <b>Craniotomy,</b> in which part of the skull is removed, may be needed to remove pieces of fractured skull or objects embedded in the brain. Decompressive craniectomy (DC) is performed routinely in the very short period following TBI during operations to treat hematomas; part of the skull is removed temporarily (primary DC). DC performed hours or days after TBI in order to control high intracranial pressures (secondary DC) has not been shown to improve outcome in some trials and may be associated with severe side-effects.|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} written by co-executive {{producer}} Tony Phelan and Joan Rater, while filmmaker Julie Anne Robinson directed it. Featured music includes Psapp's [...] "King of You", The Whitest Boy Alive's [...] "Fireworks", Iain Archer's [...] "Canal Song", Miho Hatori's [...] "Barracuda" [...] and Sybarite's [...] "Runaway". Rater described that she got the idea after being told {{that her husband had}} to undergo a <b>craniotomy.</b> She noted that the plan for the episode was to focus on Ellis' inner feelings, mainly her fright, frustration and stress. [...] "The concept of someone with this disease having a lucid day is real. The disease varies for everyone, but experts we talked to said that patients have bad days and good days and then sometimes they have great days where it seems like they are their old selves. Maybe it's a moment, maybe an hour, for some a whole afternoon, but we were fascinated with the idea of getting this time, this gift, and knowing that it's only temporary. What would you do with that one day? And what would it mean for Meredith?", stated Rater, explaining the premise of the episode. She also stated that [...] "the cool idea" [...] to have Meredith and Ellis connect again had been considered for almost a year before the actual concept of the episode was written, after numerous attempts to include the storyline in other episodes that [...] "didn't feel quite right": [...] "If you're going to give Meredith her mother back and then take her away again, you'd better have a pretty good reason." [...] Rater also explained that, in her vision, the episode introduces a new period in the interns' lives, focusing on their finding an identity as surgeons, becoming more central than {{in the beginning of the}} season, which revolved around the aftermath of Denny Duquette (Jeffrey Dean Morgan)'s death and Meredith's involvement in the love triangle between her, Shepherd and Finn Dandridge (Chris O'Donnell).|$|E

40|$|Neuroanaesthesia {{continues}} {{to develop and}} expand. It is a speciality where the knowledge and expertise of the anaesthetist can directly influence patient outcome. Evolution of neurosurgical practice is accompanied by new challenges for the anaesthetist. Increasingly, we must think not only as an anaesthetist {{but also as a}} neurosurgeon and neurologist. With the focus on func-tional and minimally invasive procedures, there is an increased emphasis on the provision of optimal operative conditions, preservation of neurocognitive function, minimizing interference with electrophysiological monitoring, and a rapid, high-quality recovery. Small <b>craniotomies,</b> intraoperative imaging, stereotactic interventions, and endoscopic procedures increase surgical precision and minimize trauma to normal tissues. The result should be quicker recovery, minimal perioperative morbidity, and reduced hospital stay. One of the peculiarities of neuro-anaesthesia has always been that as much importance is attached to wakening the patient as sending them to sleep. With the increasing popularity of awake <b>craniotomies,</b> there is even more emphasis on this skill. However, despite high-quality anaesthetic research and advances in drugs and monitoring modalities, many controversies remain regarding best clinical practice. This review will discuss some of the current controversies in elective neurosurgical practice, future perspectives, and the place of awake <b>craniotomies</b> in the armamentarium of the neuroanaesthetist...|$|R
