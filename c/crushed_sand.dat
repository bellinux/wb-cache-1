ECC is a micromechanically-based designed high-performance polymer fiber reinforced concrete with high ductility which exhibits strain-hardening and micro-cracking behavior in tension and flexure. The relative high cost remains an obstacle for wider commercial use of ECC. The replacement of cement by SCMs, {{and the use of}} local sand aggregates can lower cost and enhance greenness of the ECC. The main variables of this study were: type and size of aggregates (local crushed or standard silica sand), type of SCMs (fly ash “FA” or slag), SCM/cement ratio of 1. 2 or 2. 2, three fatigue stress levels and number of fatigue cycles up to 1 million. The study showed that ECC mixtures produced with <b>crushed</b> <b>sand</b> (with high volume of fly ash and slag) exhibited strain hardening behavior (under static loading) with deformation capacities comparable with those made with silica sand. Class F-fly ash combined with <b>crushed</b> <b>sand</b> was the best choice (compared to class CI fly ash and slag) in order to enhance the ECC ductility with slag–ECC mixtures producing lowest deflection capacity.

In search of alternatives, sustainable and economical, this study proposes characterize <b>crushed</b> <b>sand</b> from quarries in the Fortaleza metropolitan region (RMF) and evaluate its implementation, as fine aggregate, in conventional concrete, {{as a replacement for}} natural sand. The experimental study is divided into two stages. The first one is the characterization of the physical, chemical and petrographical properties of eight kinds of <b>crushed</b> <b>sand</b> from RMF through the grading, density, water absorption, pulverulent material content, bulk density, grain shape analysis, alkali-aggregate reaction, petrographic analysis, X-ray fluorescence spectrometry (XRF) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) tests. The second step is the properties evaluation of the concretes produced with <b>crushed</b> <b>sand</b> incorporation. The tool "design and analysis of experiments" was used. The crushed sands were rated into three groups and a representative sand for each group was used in the concrete production, where two independent factors (water/cement ratio and <b>crushed</b> <b>sand</b> replacement content) were determined by ranging in three levels each one of them. The measurement variables analyzed were the additive consumption, compressive strength, diametral tensile strength, shrinkage, water absorption, void ratios, density and natural carbonation. The results suggest the viability of using <b>crushed</b> <b>sand</b> to replace natural sand in conventional concrete by 75 %, given that the workability can be achieved with the use of plasticizing additives, and in general, there is an increase in the compression resistance, reduced water absorption and void ratios, in other properties the <b>crushed</b> <b>sand</b> incorporation produces no significant effects, therefore their use is considered to be technically feasible.

There is no consensus about standards and rules for testing aggregates, the lack of methodology to prepare and conduct tests may produce incorrect results, which do not satisfactorily represent the aggregate characteristics. One way to perform these analyzes is the use of images obtained with magnifying glasses or similar equipment. To contribute to this, three experiments were prepared with samples of <b>crushed</b> <b>sand</b> from the city of Passo Fundo. The fixed and evaluated parameters were: samples preparation, zoom used for image acquisition and number of grains representative of the shape parameters. The results were statistically analyzed and significant differences were obtained to the shape factor regarding the fixed parameters, except for the number of grains needed to characterize it, which differs from the currently literature used by academic studies.

The results show that inclusion of fines improves CSC compressive strength and reduces frost durability of C 30 CSC when fines content reaches 10 %, whereas it has little negative influence on frost durability of C 60 CSC. Increasing MB value does not negatively affect compressive strength of C 30 CSC but decreases compressive strength of C 60 CSC and frost durability of CSC, and the reduction is more pronounced when MB value exceeds 1. 0. Lithology has no prominent influence on frost durability and compressive strength of CSC within the lithologies (dolomite, limestone, granite, basalt, and quartz) studied.

40|$|Abstract—Fly ash-based Geopolymer {{concrete}} is a {{new material}} that does not need the presence of Portland cement as a binder {{and the role of}} Portland cement is replaced by low calcium fly ash. This material is being studied extensively as a greener substitute for OPC concrete in some applications. Geopolymers are generally believed to provide good fire resistance due to their ceramic-like properties. This paper presents the results of a study on the effect of elevated temperatures on geopolymer mortar and concrete for different types of coarse and fine aggregates. Also these results are compared with the OPC concrete of M 20 grade. The geopolymer was synthesized with fly ash, sodium silicate and sodium hydroxide solutions. Coarse aggregates used for concrete specimens are basalt and granite aggregates while natural river sand and <b>crushed</b> <b>sand</b> are used as fine aggregates for mortar specimens. The study identifies that the geopolymer concrete gives better performance than OPC concrete, in both ambient and elevated temperatures. In case of concrete specimens granite aggregates have better strength than basalt aggregates while for mortar <b>crushed</b> <b>sand</b> has better strength than natural river sand. Also, loss in compressive strength and weight due to thermal changes is less in geopolymer concrete as compared to OPC concrete...|$|E
