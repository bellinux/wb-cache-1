40|$|Abstract. Compared to the bond-type anchor, the <b>compression-type</b> anchor, whichanchors the CFRP tendon by {{applying}} a compressive force on its surface, presents {{the advantages of}} not needing a curing period for the filler and to reduce the sleeve length by more than 30 %. The fabrication of the <b>compression-type</b> anchor proceeds by changing {{the dimensions of the}} steel sleeve by hydraulic pressure, which means that the anchoring performance varies according to the region subjected to the compressive force at the surface of the CFRP tendon. Since the fabrication of the <b>compression-type</b> anchor is generally done uni-directionally, there is naturally some difference in the performance at the loaded end and free end. Accordingly, it is necessary to design the stress softening region to secure uniform anchoring performance at both ends. This study performs finite element analysis on 7 different shapes of sleeves with two types of taper based upon the dimensions of existing sleeves. From the analysis results, the design of the stress softening region of the free end is not possible by adjusting only the stress softening region but needs also to adjust the inner diameter of the sleeve so as to obtain similar stress softening regions in both loaded and free ends. For the sleeve with two tapers, similar stress softening regions could be achieved after compression by securing a stress softening region longer than 30 mm at the free end. This disposition was also seen to secure longer iso-stres...|$|E

40|$|Rail {{corrugation}} occurring on tracks {{fitted with}} Egg fasteners {{has become a}} serious problem on the newly operated lines of the Beijing metro in recent years. Investigations and field measurements show that the dominant wavelengths of corrugation are 63 – 100 [*]mm, inducing dominant frequencies of vibration on the rail in the frequency range of 160 – 310 [*]Hz for train speeds at 60 – 70 [*]km/h. Due {{to the influence of}} the dynamic behaviour of tracks on the formation of rail corrugation, various options for changing the dynamic behaviour of the track structure can be considered as possible solutions to treat corrugation. Four treatment measures have been considered: rail grinding, adding a rubber pad within the fastener, replacing the fastener with a <b>compression-type</b> fastener, and installing rail dampers on the rail. Field experiments have been carried out {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} these rail corrugation treatment measures on two lines of the Beijing metro. Frequency response functions, track decay rates, and pass-by acceleration on the rail were measured, and the development of rail roughness was monitored. Experimental results show that all the four measures are effective to control or at least slow down the development of rail corrugation on tracks with Egg fastener. Rail grinding is mostly used to limit the effects of corrugation; here, it was noted that low-amplitude corrugation on some straight lines did not reappear after rail grinding. After adding a rubber pad within the fastener, the existing corrugation reduced in amplitude, while corrugation did not reappear on a newly ground rail. Replacing the fastener with a <b>compression-type</b> fastener and installing rail dampers on the rail were found to slow down the development of corrugation...|$|E

40|$|The geometrically {{nonlinear}} Donnell shell {{theory is}} applied to the problem of stable bending of thin-walled circular cylinders. Responses are computed for cylinders with a radius-to-thickness ratio of 50 and length-to-radius ratios of 1 and 5. Four laminated composite cylinders and an aluminum cylinder are considered. Critical moment estimates are presented for short cylinders for which <b>compression-type</b> buckling behavior is important, and for very long cylinders for which the cross-section flattening, i. e., Brazier effect, is important. A finite element analysis is used to estimate the critical end rotation in addition to establishing the range of validity of the prebuckling analysis. The radial displacement response shows that the character of the boundary layer is significantly influenced by the geometric nonlinearities. Application of a first ply failure analysis using the maximum stress criterion suggests that in nearly all instances material failure occurs before buckling. Failure of the composite cylinders can be attributed to fiber breakage. Striking similarities are seen between the prebuckling displacements of the bending problem and axial compression problem for short cylinders...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{centers on}} a well-studied cohort of 100 patients, which {{received}} a treatment regimen of initial rehabilitation and activity modification to cope with Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL) injury. The data, collected prospectively and longitudinally, cover a span of 15 years after initial injury. The overall aim of this thesis is to describe {{the course of an}} ACL injury treated with rehabilitation and activity modification and to identify early prognostic factors of both short- and long-term outcome. The methods for evaluating outcome include patient-reported outcome scores — such as Lysholm, Tegner, and KOOS — and plain radiographs to assess radiographic findings of osteoarthritis. Further assessments include clinical laxity tests — such as Lachman and pivot-shift tests — to evaluate clinical instability as a predictor for later ACL reconstruction, as well as lateral radiographs to explore the influence of posterior-inferior tibial slope in ACL injury. The main findings show that approximately 60 % of ACL-injured patients can manage without ACL reconstruction by following the treatment algorithm. Most patients in this study were able to resume pre-injury activity level, and their long-term outcome proved comparable to studies of ACL reconstruction. The study also shows that Lachman and pivot-shift tests performed at 3 months post-injury are important prognostic factors regarding the need for reconstruction; however, it is not recommended to use these tests for making decisions about ACL reconstruction in the acute phase. Another prognostic factor is the slope of the medial tibial plateau, which proved steeper in patients injured when participating in contact sports and led to a fourfold increased risk for later reconstruction in flat-sloped knees. Finally, the acute injury mechanism — with a <b>compression-type</b> injury as opposed to a distraction-type injury — appears to influence both the risk for meniscal injuries, not only at index injury but even later, and the need for ACL reconstruction. A <b>compression-type</b> injury further appears to increase the risk for future osteoarthritis, although the presence of multiple confounding factors may blur its true effect. Our results suggest the initial injury mechanism, along with anthropometric variables and clinical laxity tests, can help in predicting the outcome of ACL injury. The high percentage of copers in our study makes the decision of early reconstruction in the clinical setting questionable. Based on the data presented, we recommend at least a 3 -month rehabilitation period prior to making a decision about ACL reconstruction...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to compile {{specific}} foot injuries occurring in pediatric patients that result from equestrian sports and to highlight the importance of wearing adequate riding boots to protect the feet. During a 12 -year period, 258 children were admitted to Children's Hospital of Geneva for injuries resulting from horseback riding. Amongst these children, 8 sustained foot lesions that required hospital admission. Four children had <b>compression-type</b> fractures of the cuboid (nutcracker fracture of the cuboid) associated with other complex midfoot fractures, 2 had Lisfranc fracture dislocations, 1 had a fracture of the talus with associated intern malleolar fracture, and the last had a fracture of the 5 metatarsals with lateral displacement. All the noted lesions complied with the same traumatic mechanisms. The horse fell on the patient, and the child's foot, entrapped in the stirrup, was caught in between the animal and the ground. The forefoot was bent by indirect violence in abduction by the stirrup, which acted as a fulcrum. Serious foot injuries may occur in children during equestrian activities. These lesions may be very disabling. Therefore, it is important for doctors, instructors, and parents to promote the use of appropriate safety equipment, including strengthened riding boots and safety stirrups...|$|E
40|$|Stress {{fractures}} {{are becoming}} a common diagnosis in today’s increasingly active population. They occur {{as a result of}} repetitive loading that leads to mechanical failure and fracture of the bone. 8 Femoral neck stress fractures account for 5 % of all stress fractures and are seen prima-rily in runners, military recruits, and the older adult pop-ulation. 11 Stress fractures of the femoral neck have been classified as either compression sided, tension sided, or dis-placed. 4 Historically, treatment has been highly dependent on the fracture type. Displaced stress fractures were con-sidered an orthopaedic emergency that required prompt surgical intervention. Tension-sided fractures were consid-ered unstable and were stabilized with internal fixation screws to prevent disastrous complications if a displaced fracture were to occur. <b>Compression-type</b> fractures of the femoral neck were considered more stable and were treated nonoperatively. Early accurate diagnosis of these fractures is vital, as missed or misdiagnosed fractures increase the risk of fracture displacement that can lead to avascular necrosis of the femoral head, nonunion, or varus deformity. 7 The use of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has led to earlier and more refined diagnosis of femoral neck stress fractures that could change conventional classification and treatment parameters. 9 We present 3 cases of military recruits with atypical tension-sided stress fracture of the femoral neck diagnosed with MRI. Their clinical presenta-tion, imaging characteristics, and outcomes are discussed, as well as our rationale for treating them conservatively. We also propose a modified classification scheme of femoral neck stress fractures...|$|E
40|$|An uplift of {{the ocean}} bottom caused by a {{submarine}} earthquake can generate Acoustic-Gravity Waves (AGW), progressive <b>compression-type</b> waves that travel at near {{the speed of sound}} in water. Recent studies indicate that as AGW travel they leave measurable bottom pressure signatures, which can act as tsunami precursors. In this regard, it is anticipated that such utilization of AGW would enhance current early tsunami detection systems. To this end, there is an increasing need to characterize the spatio-temporal evolution of the pressure field induced by AGW in more realistic scenarios. We analyze and simulate the fundamental AGW modes generated by the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake. We consider the first five AGW modes and show that they may all induce comparable temporal variations in pressure at different water depths in regions far from the epicenter. An example for the dynamic pressure induced by AGW is given in Figure 1. We show that the pressure field depends on the presence of the leading AGW modes. Each AGW mode becomes evanescent at a critical time, at which energy is transferred to the next higher modes. Consequently, the frequency associated with the most energetic mode changes as the leading mode varnishes. Correspondingly, the main pattern of the pressure field changes as the leading mode change. As an example, for a reference point located at 1000 Km from the epicenter, and 4 km deep, the first five AGW become evanescent after 1. 6, 4. 6, 7. 7, 10. 8 and 13. 8 hours, respectively. Our analysis and simulations shed light on the spatio-temporal evolution of the pressure field induced by AGW that radiate during submarine earthquakes. Practically, this can assist in the implementation of an AGW early tsunami detection system, starting from applying the appropriate earthquake models, to identifying the relevant measurement equipment and their optimal locations...|$|E
40|$|An uplift of {{the ocean}} bottom caused by a {{submarine}} earthquake can generate Acoustic-Gravity Waves (AGW), progressive <b>compression-type</b> waves that travel at near {{the speed of sound}} in water. The role of AGW for oceans hydrodynamics has recently became a topic of increasing scientific interest. Kadri [Deep ocean water transport by acoustic-gravity waves, J. Geo. Res. Oceans, 119, (2014) ] showed theoretically that AGW can contribute to deep ocean currents and circulation. We analyze and simulate the fundamental AGW modes generated by a submarine earthquake. We consider the first five AGW modes and show that they may all induce comparable temporal variations in water particle velocities at different depths in regions far from the epicenter. Results of temporal variations of horizontal and vertical fluid parcel velocities induced by AGW confirm chaotic flow trajectories at different water depths. A realistic example based on the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake shows that vertical water particle displacements of O(10 - 2) m can be generated at 1 Km depth in a 4 km water depth ocean. We show that the velocity field depends on the presence of the leading AGW modes. Each AGW mode becomes evanescent at a critical time, at which energy is transferred to the next higher modes. Consequently, the main pattern of the velocity field changes as the leading mode change. As an example, for a reference point located at 1000 Km from the epicenter, the first five AGW become evanescent after 1. 6, 4. 6, 7. 7, 10. 8 and 13. 8 hours, respectively. Our analysis and simulations shed light on the spatio-temporal evolution of the deep water velocities and particle displacements induced by AGW that radiate during submarine earthquakes.

40|$|In the {{beginnings}} of mechanical refrigeration, {{at the end of}} the nineteenth century, carbon dioxide was one of the first refrigerants to be used in <b>compression-type</b> refrigerating machines, later gaining widespread application mainly onboard refrigerated ships, but common in other sectors of refrigeration as well. It was only immediately after World War II that CO 2 was rapidly eclipsed as a refrigerant, due to the advent of the synthesised halogenated working fluids, addressed as safe and ideal refrigerants at that time. Because of the stratospheric Ozone depletion environmental issue, CFC and HCFC working fluids are now in the process of being phased out of use under the Montreal Protocol. The Global Warming environmental issue casts concern over the use of the new HFC fluids as substitute refrigerants, because of their high GWP values, which make them subject to regulations under the Kyoto Protocol. In this mixed situation, CO 2 is being revisited as a fully environmentally friendly and safe refrigerant. An intense research activity on its prospective applications is underway in many research establishments in Europe, Japan and North America, and important results have already been reached in exploiting the peculiar characteristics of this high-pressure fluid operated with a transcritical cycle. In some applications CO 2 systems have already been commercialised; this applies to heat pump water heaters, as a brine in indirect systems and in the low temperature stage of cascade systems. The paper critically analyses the prospects for the future return of CO 2 as a working fluid, or sometimes as a brine with change of phase, in important application areas. These include air conditioning and heat pump systems in the residential and commercial sectors, commercial and transport refrigeration and mobile air conditioning...|$|E

Solar energy {{is available at}} the same time when there is need to cool rooms, so Solar Cooling systems are suitable also for Latvian conditions. In Latvia such systems are not used yet, so it is important to assess the potential of these systems. The sunlight duration and intensity depends on the season, weather conditions and geographical position of a country. As compared with the annual global solar radiation incident on horizontal surfaces in sunny regions (2200 kWh/m 2), in the northern Europe is half as much (1100 kWh/m 2). The solar energy potential defined for Latvia as technically achievable by 2020 is: for electricity 0. 01 TWh and for heat 0. 04 TWh. As shown by experimental studies, the application of solar collectors in Latvia can give good results. The energy of solar radiation can be employed for 1700 - 1900 hours annually. Due to a gradual increase in the comfort level, the demand for space cooling will grow in the near future. Solar cooling can be an alternative for electrically-powered <b>compression-type</b> chillers that currently are the most common in the Baltic States. The solar cooling system installed in the Institute of Physical Energetic is the first of the type in EU which is built at the latitudes higher than 55 degrees of north. Taking into account {{the fact that there were}} no systems plants of this type at so “cold” latitudes, first of all the models in PolySun were to be validated, and a dynamic simulation program containing the five-years meteorological data was to be developed. The solar cooling system has been optimized using multiple simulations. The influence of the system's different elements on its operation is evaluated. The optimal model developed for the given climatic conditions is described...|$|E
40|$|Resonance {{interactions}} of waves play {{a prominent role}} in energy share among the different wave types involved. Such interactions may significantly contribute, among others, to the evolution of the ocean energy spectrum by exchanging energy between surface-gravity waves; surface and internal gravity waves; or even surface and <b>compression-type</b> waves, that can transfer energy from the upper ocean through the whole water column reaching down to the seafloor. A resonant triad occurs among a triplet of waves, usually involving interaction of nonlinear terms of second order perturbed equations. Until recently, it has been believed that in a homogeneous fluid a resonant triad is possible only when tension forces are included, or at the limit of a shallow water, and that when the compressibility of water is considered, no resonant triads can occur within the family of gravity–acoustic waves. However, more recently it has been proved that, under some circumstances, resonant triads comprising two opposing surface-gravity waves of similar periods (though not identical) and a much longer acoustic–gravity wave, of almost double the frequency, exist [Kadri and Stiassnie 2013, J. Fluid Mech. 735 R 6]. Here, I report on a new resonant triad involving a gravity wave and two acoustic waves of almost double the length. Interestingly, the two acoustic waves propagate in the same direction with similar wavelengths, that are almost double of that of the gravity wave. The evolution of the wave triad amplitudes is periodic and it is derived analytically, in terms of Jacobian elliptic functions and elliptic integrals. The physical importance of this type of triad interactions is the modulation of pertinent acoustic signals, leading to inaccurate signal perceptions. Enclosed figure: presents an example spatio-temporal evolution of the wave triad amplitudes. The gravity wave (top) remains almost unaltered, while the envelope slowly displaces to the left. However, the prescribed acoustic envelope (middle) travels relatively fast to the right minimising the interaction time. Consequently, the resultant acoustic wave envelope (bottom) might be significantly smaller. As the two acoustic beams concurrently move away from the gravity wave, with disparate group velocities, the resonant interaction gradually vanishes...|$|E
40|$|The figure shows {{several aspects}} of an {{experimental}} robotic manipulator that includes a housing from which protrudes a tendril- or tentacle-like arm 1 cm thick and 1 m long. The arm consists of two collinear segments, each {{of which can be}} bent independently of the other, and the two segments can be bent simultaneously in different planes. The arm can be retracted to a minimum length or extended by any desired amount up to its full length. The arm can also be made to rotate about its own longitudinal axis. Some prior experimental robotic manipulators include single-segment bendable arms. Those arms are thicker and shorter than the present one. The present robotic manipulator serves as a prototype of future manipulators that, by virtue of the slenderness and multiple- bending capability of their arms, are expected to have sufficient dexterity for operation within spaces that would otherwise be inaccessible. Such manipulators could be especially well suited as means of minimally invasive inspection during construction and maintenance activities. Each of the two collinear bending arm segments is further subdivided into a series of collinear extension- and <b>compression-type</b> helical springs joined by threaded links. The extension springs occupy the majority of the length of the arm and engage passively in bending. The compression springs are used for actively controlled bending. Bending is effected by means of pairs of antagonistic tendons in the form of spectra gel spun polymer lines that are attached at specific threaded links and run {{the entire length of the}} arm inside the spring helix from the attachment links to motor-driven pulleys inside the housing. Two pairs of tendons, mounted in orthogonal planes that intersect along the longitudinal axis, are used to effect bending of each segment. The tendons for actuating the distal bending segment are in planes offset by an angle of 45 from those of the proximal bending segment: This configuration makes it possible to accommodate all eight tendons at the same diameter along the arm. The threaded links have central bores through which power and video wires can be strung (1) from a charge-coupled-device camera mounted on the tip of the arms (2) back along the interior of the arm into the housing and then (3) from within the housing to an external video monitor...|$|E
