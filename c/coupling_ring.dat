40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} coupling delays on the synchronization properties of several network motifs. In particular, we analyze the synchronization patterns of unidirectionally <b>coupled</b> <b>rings,</b> bidirectionally <b>coupled</b> <b>rings,</b> and open chains of Kuramoto oscillators. Our approach includes an analytical and semianalytical study of the existence and stability of different in-phase and out-of-phase periodic solutions, complemented by numerical simulations. The delay is found to act differently on networks possessing different symmetries. While for the unidirectionally <b>coupled</b> <b>ring</b> the <b>coupling</b> delay is mainly observed to induce multistability, its effect on bidirectionally <b>coupled</b> <b>rings</b> is to enhance the most symmetric solution. We also study the influence of feedback and conclude that it also promotes the in-phase solution of the coupled oscillators. We finally discuss the relation between our theoretical results on delay-coupled Kuramoto oscillators and the synchronization properties of networks consisting of real-world delay-coupled oscillators, such as semiconductor laser arrays and neuronal circuits.

40|$|Although many {{properties}} of the Earth's magnetosphere have been measured and quantified in the past 30 years since it was discovered, one fundamental (for a zeroeth order magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equilibrium) measurement was made infrequently and with poor spatial coverage: the global electric field. This oversight is {{in part due to}} the difficulty of measuring a plasma electric field, and in part due to the difficulty of measuring a plasma electric field, and in part due to the neglect of theorists. However, there is renewed interest in the convection electric field, since it has been realized that it is vital for understanding many aspects of the magnetosphere: the global MHD equilibrium, reconnection rates, Region 2 Birkeland currents, magnetosphere-ionosphere <b>coupling,</b> <b>ring</b> current and radiation belt transport, substorm injections, acceleration mechanisms, etc. Unfortunately the standard experimental methods {{have not been able to}} synthesize a global field (excepting the pioneering work of McIlwain's geostationary models), and we are left with an overly simplistic theoretical field, the Volland-Stern electric field mode. Again, single point measurements of the plasma pause were used to infer the appropriate amplitudes of the model, parameterized by Kp (Maynard & Chen, JGR 1975). Although this result was never intended to be the definitive electric field model, it has gone nearly unchanged for 15 years. However, the data sets being taken today require a great deal more accuracy than can be provided by the Volland-Stern model. Nor has the variability of the electric field shielding been properly addressed, although effects of penetrating magnetospheric electric fields has been seen in mid- and low-latitude ionospheric data sets. The growing interests in substorm dynamics also requires a much better assessment of the electric fields responsible for particle injections. Thus, we proposed and developed algorithms for extracting electric fields from particle data taken in the earth's magnetosphere. As a test of the effectiveness of these techniques, we analyzed data taken by the AMPTE/CCE spacecraft in equatorial orbit between 1984 - 1988.

Unidirectional ring lasers have the advantages that, in the favoured emission direction, they can have up to double the quantum efficiency of bidirectional lasers and do not suffer from spatial hole burning. In this work, this operation was realised by incorporating an "S"-crossover waveguide into the ring cavity {{in a manner that}} it introduces non reciprocal loss and gain in the counter-clockwise (CCW) and clockwise (CW) directions respectively. The measured result showed higher quantum efficiency in the CW. In fact at 1. 5 times the threshold current, 90 % of the light was emitted in the favoured CW.
