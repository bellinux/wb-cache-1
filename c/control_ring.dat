5|$|By {{the time}} Vashyron and his comrades learn the full tale from Juris, Rowen {{is in the}} midst of a crisis of faith due to his control over the Zenith System through his ring. During the party's {{confrontation}} with Sullivan where he threatens to destroy Leanne's quartz, Rowen shoots Sullivan to try and prove the existence of a higher power through Leanne's survival. The three then confront Rowen directly and fatally wound him, but Rowen's control of the Zenith System preserves his life. Vashyron calls Zephyr and Leanne off, seeing further fighting is pointless. During the game's credits, Rowen uses his power to resurrect the Cardinals, then leaves the <b>control</b> <b>ring</b> on Frieda's grave, and Sullivan is seen reuniting with Rebecca. In a post-credit scene, Leanne, Zephyr and Vashyron explore the now-clean world beyond Basel, and Leanne's quartz is revealed to have been safely embedded in her hand.|$|E
25|$|After {{completion}} at Burbank, the CL-475 {{was taken}} to Rosamond Lake on Edwards Air Force Base in the Mojave Desert for testing. It was first flown on 2 November 1959, but the pilot reported severe vibrations. For six months, Lockheed experimented with three and four-bladed wooden rotors, but stability was finally achieved by using metal blades in a three-blade configuration {{and the addition of}} a gyroscopic <b>control</b> <b>ring</b> connected directly to the swashplate. In the mid-1960s, the helicopter was test flown by a number of government and military agencies and the military. The stability offered by the rigid rotor control system made the helicopter easy to fly, and the lessons learned from the CL-475 rigid rotor were later used to develop the XH-51 and AH-56A Cheyenne.|$|E

40|$|To {{assess whether}} aortic vessels of rats with {{cirrhosis}} and ascites possess an enhanced vascular response to endothelium-derived, nitric oxide-dependent vasodilators, we performed relaxation studies in isolated aortic <b>rings</b> of 21 <b>control</b> rats and 24 rats with carbon tetrachloride-induced cirrhosis and ascites. We carried out studies after contracting the vessels with norepinephrine. We measured endothelium-dependent vasodilator response by administering increasing concentrations of acetylcholine (10 (- 6) to 10 (- 2) mol/L) and ADP (10 (- 7) to 10 (- 4) mol/L). We evaluated endothelium-independent response by giving increased concentration of sodium nitrite (10 (- 5) to 10 (- 2) mol/L). The maximal absolute tension developed {{in response to}} norepinephrine was significantly decreased in cirrhotic rings (816 +/- 72 mg, p < 0. 025) compared with control (1, 425 +/- 75 mg) rings. Dose-response curves for endothelium-dependent vasodilators were shifted to the left in aortic rings of cirrhotic rats, and EC 50 for acetylcholine and ADP were significantly decreased in cirrhotic (0. 8 +/- 0. 15 mmol/L and 0. 42 +/- 0. 16 mumol/L, p < 0. 025 and p < 0. 01, respectively) than in <b>control</b> <b>rings</b> (1. 91 +/- 0. 33 mmol/L and 3. 09 +/- 0. 82 mumol/L). In both acetylcholine- and ADP-stimulated vessels, differences between cirrhotic and <b>control</b> <b>rings</b> disappeared after nitric oxide synthesis inhibition with N omega-nitro-L-arginine (10 (- 4) mol/L). No difference in the relaxing effect of sodium nitrite was observed between cirrhotic and <b>control</b> <b>rings.</b> These results therefore demonstrate {{for the first time}} enhanced in vitro vascular responsiveness to nitric oxide-dependent vasodilators in rats with cirrhosis and ascites, giving further support to the concept that nitric oxide activity is increased in cirrhosis...|$|R

50|$|Where the RC30 {{had used}} roller {{bearings}} on the camshafts, the RC45 used more conventional plain bearings. The RC30 {{had used a}} piston with one compression ring and oil <b>control</b> <b>ring</b> to reduce friction. This was very effective for racing but resulted in increased oil consumption in the road-going bikes. The RC45 changed to the more conventional two compression ring system, also with an oil <b>control</b> <b>ring.</b> It used low friction rings and a molybdenum disulphide coating on smaller piston skirts to reduce friction. One huge change in engine architecture was the change from centre gear drive mechanism to crank/camshaft drive, which was located {{on the end of}} the crankshaft (another NR750 follow on). This reduced the number of engine crankshaft bearings by one and camshaft bearings by four with an associated reduction in friction. This overall reduction in friction also allowed the engine to see the higher engine revolutions Honda desired without losing horsepower. The RC45 also followed the RC30 in using titanium connecting rods in a revised format, made lighter and stronger, to help cope with the extra rpm the moving parts of a race engine were expected to see.|$|E

40|$|Figure 1 : Snapshots of a {{real-time}} virtual {{martial arts}} warrior, illustrating quadratic Bézier action curves {{hooked up with}} single springs, sinusoidal fusiform muscles and final skin deformation via smooth skinning. Abstract- We propose significant simplifications in muscle modeling and simulation to facilitate real-time anatomical skin deformation for full-body articulated characters. The muscle shape {{is a function of}} an animated quadratic Bézier action curve and <b>control</b> <b>rings</b> derived from it. The action curve is uniformly sampled to derive <b>control</b> <b>rings</b> driven by a scaled sinusoidal equation to model fusiform shapes. A single spring is attached between the central control point and the midpoint vector between the extreme control points of the Bézier action curve. Care is taken to stabilize local coordinates for each muscle vertex to enable glitch-free skin deformation. The character's polygonal mesh is smooth-skinned using a twolayered approach: first to the joints, and then to the muscle vertices. Lastly we show how different prominent muscles can be reasonably approximated with the proposed fusiform model. A typical 4000 -vertex character skinned with sixty four 72 -vertex muscles is able to run on average CPUs at 60 - 80 fps. Our main contribution is the simplified dynamics driven curved action-axis, which enables economical and expressive muscle animation. Keywords: Muscle-based deformation, real-time dynamics, appealing characters. ...|$|R
