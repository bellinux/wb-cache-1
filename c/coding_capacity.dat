40|$|In this work, {{we study}} two models of {{arbitrarily}} varying channels, when causal side {{information is available}} at the encoder in a causal manner. First, we study the arbitrarily varying channel (AVC) with input and state constraints, when the encoder has state information in a causal manner. Lower and upper bounds on the random <b>code</b> <b>capacity</b> are developed. A lower bound on the deterministic <b>code</b> <b>capacity</b> is established {{in the case of a}} message-averaged input constraint. In the setting where a state constraint is imposed on the jammer, while the user is under no constraints, the random code bounds coincide, and the random <b>code</b> <b>capacity</b> is determined. Furthermore, for this scenario, a generalized non-symmetrizability condition is stated, under which the deterministic <b>code</b> <b>capacity</b> coincides with the random <b>code</b> <b>capacity.</b> A second model considered in our work is the arbitrarily varying degraded broadcast channel with causal side information at the encoder (without constraints). We establish inner and outer bounds on both the random <b>code</b> <b>capacity</b> region and the deterministic <b>code</b> <b>capacity</b> region. The capacity region is then determined for a class of channels satisfying a condition on the mutual informations between the strategy variables and the channel outputs.

We also determine the capacity of the AVC with constraints on the transmitted codewords {{as well as on the}} channel state sequences, and demonstrate that it may be positive but less than the corresponding random <b>code</b> <b>capacity.</b> A special case of our results resolves a weakened version of a fundamental problem of coding theory...|$|R

40|$|In {{this work}} the {{arbitrarily}} varying wiretap channel AVWC is studied. We derive a lower bound on the random <b>code</b> secrecy <b>capacity</b> {{for the average}} error criterion and the strong secrecy criterion {{in the case of}} a best channel to the eavesdropper by using Ahlswede's robustification technique for ordinary AVCs. We show that {{in the case of a}} non-symmetrisable channel to the legitimate receiver the deterministic <b>code</b> secrecy <b>capacity</b> equals the random <b>code</b> secrecy <b>capacity,</b> a result similar to Ahlswede's dichotomy result for ordinary AVCs. Using this we can derive that the lower bound is also valid for the deterministic <b>code</b> <b>capacity</b> of the AVWC. The proof of the dichotomy result is based on the elimination technique introduced by Ahlswede for ordinary AVCs. We further prove upper bounds on the deterministic <b>code</b> secrecy <b>capacity</b> in the general case, which results in a multi-letter expression for the secrecy capacity in the case of a best channel to the eavesdropper. Using techniques of Ahlswede, developed to guarantee the validity of a reliability criterion, the main contribution of this work is to integrate the strong secrecy criterion into these techniques.

40|$|This paper {{continues}} {{the study of}} algebraic <b>code</b> <b>capacities,</b> which were introduced by Ahlswede (1971). He states an upper bound for the rates of codes which have the property that the code words form a linear space and the decoding procedure is arbitrary. It was asked (problem 5) whether this upper bound is actually the capacity if we deal with average errors. We answer this question in the affirmative for binary discrete memoryless channels. For nonbinary discrete memoryless channels we obtain slightly weaker result: If we allow those codes which have as code words a coset of a group which is a linear space, then the upper bound is again the capacity. An example shows that the result is not true for maximal error.

5000|$|Self-complementary {{adeno-associated virus}} (scAAV) is a viral vector {{engineered}} from the naturally occurring adeno-associated virus (AAV) {{to be used}} as a tool for gene therapy. Use of recombinant AAV (rAAV) has been successful in clinical trials addressing a variety of diseases. This lab-made progeny of rAAV is termed [...] "self-complementary" [...] because the coding region has been designed to form an intra-molecular double-stranded DNA template. A rate-limiting step for the standard AAV genome involves the second-strand synthesis since the typical AAV genome is a single-stranded DNA template. However, this is not the case for scAAV genomes. Upon infection, rather than waiting for cell mediated synthesis of the second strand, the two complementary halves of scAAV will associate to form one double stranded DNA (dsDNA) unit that is ready for immediate replication and transcription. The caveat of this construct is that instead of the full <b>coding</b> <b>capacity</b> found in rAAV (4.7-6kb) scAAV can only hold about half of that amount (â2.4kb).|$|E
50|$|A-to-I editing is {{the main}} form of RNA editing in mammals and occurs in regions of {{double-stranded}} RNA (dsRNA). Adenosine deaminases acting on RNA (ADARs) are the RNA-editing enzymes involved in the hydrolytic deamination of Adenosine to Inosine (A-to-I editing). A-to-I editing can be specific (a single adenosine is edited within the stretch of dsRNA) or promiscuous (up to 50% of the adenosines are edited). Specific editing occurs within short duplexes (e.g., those formed in an mRNA where intronic sequence base pairs with a complementary exonic sequence), while promiscuous editing occurs within longer regions of duplex (e.g., pre- or pri-miRNAs, duplexes arising from transgene or viral expression, duplexes arising from paired repetitive elements). There are many effects of A-to-I editing, arising {{from the fact that}} it behaves as if it is G both in translation and when forming secondary structures. These effects include alteration of <b>coding</b> <b>capacity,</b> altered miRNA or siRNA target populations, heterochromatin formation, nuclear sequestration, cytoplasmic sequestration, endonucleolytic cleavage by Tudor-SN, inhibition of miRNA and siRNA processing, and altered splicing.|$|E

Kapitonov and Jurka investigated the <b>coding</b> <b>capacity</b> of Helitrons in A. thaliana, Oryza sativa, and Caenorhabditis elegan using in silico studies of repetitive DNA of these organisms, computational analysis and Monte Carlo simulation.

Their survey of the genome of these organisms showed that Helitron activity could contribute to a significant fraction (â¼ 2%) of the plant and invertebrate genomes where they were found, but the extent of their distribution elsewhere was not clear.|$|E
