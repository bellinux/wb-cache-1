From the analysis of these two movements, we identify a shared managerial willingness to adopt the two principles.

5000|$|During the 1940s and 1950s, Portugal {{experienced}} {{economic growth}} {{due to increased}} raw material exports to the war-ravaged and recovering nations of Europe. Until the 1960s, however, the country remained very poor and largely underdeveloped due to its disadvantaged starting position and lack of effective policies to counter that situation. Salazar managed to discipline the Portuguese public finances, after the chaotic First Portuguese Republic of 1910-1926, but consistent economic growth and development remained scarce {{until well into the}} 1960s, when due to the influence {{of a new generation of}} technocrats with background in economics and technical-industrial know-how, the Portuguese economy started to take off with visible accomplishments in the people's quality of life and standard of living, as well as in terms of secondary and post-secondary education attainment. During the early period of Salazar's rule, a brand new road system was built, new bridges spanned the rivers, and an educational program was able to build a primary school in each Portuguese town (an idea developed and begun during the democratic First Republic). Some liberal economic reforms advocated by elements of the ruling party, which were successfully implemented under similar circumstances in neighboring Spain, were rejected out of fear that industrialization would destabilize the regime and its ideological base and would strengthen the Communists and other left-wing movements. In 1958, when the Portuguese government announced the 1959-64 Six-Year Plan for National Development, a decision had been reached to accelerate the country's rate of economic growth, a decision whose urgency grew with the outbreak of guerrilla warfare in Angola in 1961 and in Portugal's other African territories thereafter. Salazar and his policy advisers recognized that additional military expenditure needs, as well as increased transfers of official investment to the [...] "overseas provinces", could only be met by a sharp rise in the country's productive capacity. Salazar's commitment to preserving Portugal's [...] "multiracial, pluricontinental" [...] state led him reluctantly to seek external credits beginning in 1962, an action from which the Portuguese treasury had abstained for several decades.Beyond military measures, the official Portuguese response to the [...] "winds of change" [...] in the African colonies was to integrate them administratively and economically more closely with the mainland. This was accomplished through population and capital transfers, trade liberalization, and the creation of a common currency, the so-called Escudo Area. The integration program established in 1961 provided for the removal of Portugal's duties on imports from its overseas territories by January 1964. The latter, on the other hand, were permitted to continue to levy duties on goods imported from Portugal but at a preferential rate, in most cases 50 percent of the normal duties levied by the territories on goods originating outside the Escudo Area. The effect of this two-tier tariff system was to give Portugal's exports preferential access to its colonial markets. The economies of the overseas provinces, especially those of both the Overseas Province of Angola and Mozambique, boomed.The liberalization of the Portuguese economy gained a new impetus under Salazar's successor, Prime Minister Marcello José das Neves Caetano (1968-1974), whose administration abolished industrial licensing requirements for firms in most sectors and in 1972 signed a free trade agreement with the newly enlarged European Community. Under the agreement, which took effect at the beginning of 1973, Portugal was given until 1980 to abolish its restrictions on most <b>community</b> <b>goods</b> and until 1985 on certain sensitive products amounting to some 10 percent of the EC's total exports to Portugal. Starting in 1960, EFTA membership and a growing foreign investor presence contributed to Portugal's industrial modernization and export diversification between 1960 and 1973. Caetano moved on to foster economic growth and some social improvements, such as the awarding of a monthly pension to rural workers who had never had the chance to pay social security. Some large scale investments were made at national level, such as the building of a major oil processing center in Sines. Notwithstanding the concentration of the means of production in the hands of a small number of family-based financial-industrial groups, Portuguese business culture permitted a surprising upward mobility of university-educated individuals with middle-class backgrounds into professional management careers. Before the 1974 Carnation Revolution, the largest, most technologically advanced (and most recently organized) firms offered the greatest opportunity for management careers based on merit rather than by accident of birth. In 1960, at the initiation of Salazar's more outward-looking economic policy, Portugal's per capita GDP was only 38 percent of the European Community (EC-12) average; by the end of the Salazar period, in 1968, it had risen to 48 percent; and in 1973, under the leadership of Marcelo Caetano, Portugal's per capita GDP had reached 56.4 percent of the EC-12 average. On a long term analysis, after a long period of economic divergence before 1914, and a period of chaos during the First Republic, the Portuguese economy recovered slightly until 1950, entering thereafter on a path of strong economic convergence with the wealthiest economies of Western Europe, until the Carnation Revolution in April 1974. Portuguese economic growth in the period 1960 to 1973 under the Estado Novo regime (and even with the effects of an expensive war effort in African territories against independence guerrilla groups), created an opportunity for real integration with the developed economies of Western Europe. Through emigration, trade, tourism and foreign investment, individuals and firms changed their patterns of production and consumption, bringing about a structural transformation. Simultaneously, the increasing complexity of a growing economy raised new technical and organizational challenges, stimulating the formation of modern professional and management teams.|$|E

40|$|An {{institution}} {{found in}} many traditional societies is the extended family system (kin system), an informal system of shared rights and obligations among extended family {{for the purpose of}} mutual assistance. In predominantly non-market economies, the kin system is a valuable institution providing critical <b>community</b> <b>goods</b> and insurance services in the absence of market or public provision. But what happens when the market sector grows in the process of economic development? How do the members of kin groups respond, individually and collectively, to such changes? When the kin system"meets"the modern economy, does the kin system act as a"vehicle of progress"helping its members adapt, or as an"instrument of stagnation"holding back its members from benefiting from market development? In reality, the consequences of membership in a kin group have been varied for people {{in different parts of the}} world. Hoff and Sen characterize the conditions under which the kin system becomes a dysfunctional institution when facing an expanding modern economy. The authors first show that when there are moral hazard problems in the modern sector, the kin system may exacerbate them. When modern sector employers foresee that, they will offer employment opportunities on inferior terms to members of ethnic groups that practice the kin system. These entry barriers in the market, in turn, create an incentive for some individuals to break ties with their kin group, which hurts members of the group who stay back in the traditional sector. The authors then show in a simple migration model that if a kin group can take collective action to raise exit barriers, then even if migrating to the modern sector and breaking ties increases aggregate welfare (and even if a majority of members are expected to gain ex post, after the resolution of uncertainty about the identity of the winners and losers), a majority of agents within a kin group may support ex ante raising the exit barrier to prevent movement to the modern sector. This result is an example of the bias toward the status quo analyzed by Raquel Fernandez and Dani Rodrik in the context of trade reform. The authors do not claim that all kin groups will necessarily exhibit such a bias against beneficial regime changes. But they provide a clear intuition about the forces that can lead to the collective conservatism of a kin system facing expanding opportunities in a market economy-forces that can lead the kin group to become a poverty trap for its members.

40|$|Extended SummaryINTRODUCTIONThe general aim of an {{education}} system is to raise individuals equipped with the qualifications required by the age {{in line with the}} predefined long, general and special goals. The outcomes of {{an education}} system are students' behaviors. When these behaviors are examined, it is observed that some of these behaviors are desired but insufficient while some are no desired (Baykul, 2000). One of the no desired behaviors is academic dishonesty which includes cheating and plagiarism. Cheating is defined in the Turkish Dictionary of Turkish Linguistic Society (1997) as “copy of an artistic work or a script” and “a prepared paper to be peeked during an examination in contravention of the rules” while the act of cheating is defined as “peeking a resource to answer the questions in contravention of the rules” generally in written tests. Plagiarism is defined in the Grand Turkish Dictionary (1998) as “appropriating a work partially or totally, theft of words and script, literal theft”. According to Kibler, Nuss, Paterson and Pavela (1988), academic dishonesty consists of behaviors such as cheating and plagiarism which include assistance received or given in an academic study without permission by students or borrowing another one's study by students (cited: Aluede, Omoregie and Osa-Edoh, 2006). Pavela (1978) defines plagiarism as “reproduction or adaptation of thoughts, words or statements of another author without reference as one's own original work” (cited: Aluede, Omoregie and Osa-Edoh, 2006) while Hawley (1984) defines as “a series ranging from citation without attention to translation word by word without reference” (cited by Larkham and Manns, 2002), and Harvey (1995) defines as “the act of lying, copying and theft by using the information, thoughts or words of another author without using quotation marks as one's own sentences”, and Isserman (2003) defines as “a kind of dishonesty, intellectual theft and breaking the intellectual values”, and Park (2003) defines as “literal theft and use of another's thoughts or scripts without reference (cited: Iyer and Eastman, 2006). When the research results are taken into account, why students display dishonesty behaviors becomes a significant question because academic dishonesty influences individuals' future behaviors and the level to reach the goals defined by educational institutions (Harding et. al., 2003). The reasons for academic dishonesty can be the perception of anything on internet as <b>community</b> <b>goods</b> by some students and not knowing what plagiarism or copyright means by new generation students according to Bricault (1998); considering cheating as acceptable in a society and finding refusal of a demand from a peer for cheating difficult by some students according to Schulman (1998) (cited: Moeck, 2002 : 483); ambition for grades and, thus with the pressure caused by this, {{hope to be able to}} satisfy parents according to Wein (1994); thinking to be academically accepted with high grades according to Aubrecht (1990); and considering courses not directly related to the future professional field is waste of time by some students and believing if the course is not related to the subject courses, that course is unimportant according to Harris (2001) (cited: Moeck, 2002 : 483). When the studies on academic dishonesty are examined, it is seen that academic dishonesty is not new; it frequently occurs and gradually increases in recent years (Whitley, 1998). Thus, the institutions must take precautions about academic dishonesty at the institutional and individual level and put these into implementation The Aim of the StudyAlthough there are many studies on determining at which level academic dishonesty occurs at which education level and at which countries (Iyer ve Eastman, 2006; de Lambert ve diğ, 2006; Chun-Hua ve Ling-Yu, 2007) there is no study on determining the tendency of students to the defined dishonesty behaviors in the literature. While the studies on the level of academic dishonesty behavior in related institutions are valuable, it is considered that studies on predetermining the individuals with a tendency to display such behaviors is of the same importance. From this point of view, this study tries to develop a scale to determine the tendencies of students to academic dishonesty behavior who study in universities which is one of educational institutions academic dishonesty is frequently observed. METHODScale Development Process Generating Tryout Items Firstly, the studies on academic dishonesty in the literature were examined. Then a group of students (n= 15) were asked to write an essay about academic dishonesty. As a result of the surveys, totally 40 statements, 20 of which represent high tendency (+ oriented) and 20 of which represent low tendency (- oriented), covering all dimensions of the concept of academic dishonesty were written. These statements were submitted to specialists to be examined in terms of context, clarity and similarity of statements and following the arrangements asked by the specialists, the number of statements was reduced to 25 to represent 14 high tendency (+) and 11 low tendency (-). Preparation and Implementation of Tentative Form For preparation of the tentative form of the scale, likert type scale format was taken into account. In this framework, 5 point scale was used as “completely agree”, “agree”, “indecisive”, “disagree”, “completely disagree” as choices in answers. The tentative form was applied to a group of 300 students studying in Abant İzzet Baysal University during 2006 – 2007 academic years. 38 students found to have not answered some statements or answered randomly were excluded from the study. 49, 20 % of the subjects (n= 262) were female (f= 129) while 50, 80 % were male (f= 133). 20, 99 % of the subjects were in the first grade (n= 55), 25, 95 % in the second grade (n= 68), 26, 72 % in the third grade (n= 54) and 26, 34 % in the fourth grade (n= 69). 42, 75 % of the subjects studied in the Faculty of Education (n= 112), 24, 05 % studied in the Faculty of Economic and Administrative Sciences (n= 63), 20, 60 % in the Faculty of Arts and Sciences (n= 54) and 12, 60 % in the School of Physical Education and Sport (n= 33). Process and Analysis of Data The answers of the subjects to the statements given in the tentative form were scored and processed into SPSS 15. 0 package programme. During processing of answers, the positive statements were scored from 5 to 1 from “completely agree” to “completely disagree” choices while negative statements from 1 to 5 from “completely disagree” to “completely agree” choices. For determining the qualified items to be included in the final scale, two different item analysis method was used which is recommended to be used in the process of development of likert type scale (Tezbaşaran, 1997; Tavşancıl, 2006). These are the item analysis based on item-scale correlation and the item analysis based on difference of the sub-superior group averages. The construct validity of the scale was tested with explanatory and confirmatory factor analysis. The reliability of the scale was tested with internal consistency reliability estimating method (Cronbach alpha) and test-retest reliability. FINDINGSItem Analysis Item Analysis based on Item-Scale Correlation The correlation coefficients of the item score of each item and scale scores range between 0, 47 (m 9) and 0, 68 (m 23) and all the coefficients are statistically significant at a level of 0, 01. Item Analysis based on Difference of Sub-Superior Group Averages There is a statistically significant difference in score averages of answers to items of students in sub and superior groups at a level of 0, 01 for all items. Findings Related to the Validity of the ScaleConstruct Validity The construct validity of the scale was tested with the explanatory and confirmatory factor analysis. The results are given below. Explanatory Factor Analysis There are 4 factors whose eigen value is over 1. Since the eigen value difference between the first factor and other factors in terms of the eigen values is big (Kline, 1994), it is possible to say that the scale measures a certain construct as a whole. On the other hand, the values gained after conversion show that the scale has 4 factors. The total variance explained by the four factors is 53, 157 %. The number of the items in factors is 8, 7, 4 and 6 respectively. After analysis of the items in the contexts, the first factor was named “tendency towards cheating”, the second factor “tendency towards dishonesty in assignments, and studies such as projects – general”, the third “tendency towards dishonesty in the process of research and report” and the fourth factor “dishonesty tendency towards ascriptions”. Confirmatory Factor Analysis While explanatory factor analysis ensured determination of main factor related to the scale of tendency to academic dishonesty, the confirmatory factor analysis facilitated determination of the data related to the quality of the defined factors, general structure of the scale and to which level the scale explained the tendency to academic dishonesty. As a result of the analyses, the level of representation of own implicit variable of all items (observed variable) except for the 6 th, 7 th and 8 th items in the first factor was found to be meaningful at a level of 0, 05. The t values measured for these three items was lower than 1, 96 which was the critical value determined for the value of 0, 05. Therefore, considering that these three items which had a lower t value than the defined critical t value failed to represent own implicit variable, these items were removed from the model and the analyses were reiterated for 22 items taking into consideration the defined 4 factors. The analyses carried out following the removal of the related items showed that the level of representation of own implicit variable of all the items (observed variable) was statistically significant at a level of 0. 05. The t values measured for the total 22 items were higher than 1, 96. This means each item represents its own implicit variable well and thus can be included in the scale. After parameter estimations, goodness of fit indexes were reviewed which ensure evaluation of a model as a whole. It was observed that all the indexes used in this study were very close to or at the desired level. Findings Related to the Reliability of the Scale Cronbach Alpha Internal Consistency Reliability The Cronbach alpha reliability coefficients, which reveal whether all the items in each factor within the scale measured or not the desired qualification to be measured with the related factor and thus all the items under the scale as a whole, are given in table below. Alpha Reliability Coefficients of Each Factors and the Whole Scale 1 st Factor 2 nd Factors 3 rd Factor 4 th FactorWhole ScaleNumber of Items 574622 Cronbach α 0, 710, 8210, 7850, 7760, 90 According to the values given in Table, the Cronbach α internal consistency reliability coefficient of the scale is 0, 71 for the first factor; 0, 821 for the second factor; 0, 785 for the third factor; 0, 776 for the fourth factor and 0, 90 for the scale as a whole. Test-Retest Reliability The final form of the scale consisting of 22 items was applied to a group of 20 students twice at an interval of 15 days to determine the test-retest reliability level of the scale. The correlation coefficient between the results obtained from two applications was found to be 0, 88. CONCLUSIONAs a result of the item analysis carried out in line with the item-scale correlation (r) on the data obtained from the tentative implementation, all items were found to be significant at a level of 0. 01. This finding can be interpreted as that the qualification measured by each item within the scale is the same as the one measured by the scale as a whole. Accordingly, all the items subjected to tentative implementation may be included in the final scale. As a result of the item analysis carried out based on the differences of sub-superior group averages (t test) over the data obtained from the tentative implementation, all the items showed a meaningful difference at a level of 0, 01. This finding means that each item can well differentiate between the ones which have the qualifications and those which do not have the qualifications desired to be measured with that item. According to these results, all the items subjected to tentative implementation may be included in the final scale. The explanatory factor analysis carried out to test the construct validity of the scale show that the scale has 4 factors. The first factor includes 8 items, the second includes 7, the third includes 4 and the fourth factor has 6 items. After review of the structures of the items of the defined factor, these factors were named “tendency towards cheating”, “tendency towards dishonesty in assignments and studies such as projects – general”, “tendency towards dishonesty in the process of research and report” and “dishonesty tendency towards ascriptions” respectively. The total variance explained by the defined four factors is at an acceptable level of 53, 157 %. The main factors related to the scale of tendency to academic dishonesty were defined with the explanatory factor analysis while the confirmatory factor analysis facilitated determination of the data related to the quality of the defined factors, general structure of the scale and to which level the scale explained the tendency to academic dishonesty. As a result of the analyses, 6 th, 7 th and 8 th items in the first factor were removed from the scale since they did not have the required qualifications. The final scale consisted of 22 items, 5 of which in the first factor, 7 of which in the second, 4 of which in the third and 6 of which in the fourth factor. The internal consistency reliability coefficients of the scale is at an acceptable level both for each factor and the scale as a whole and it is possible to say that the scale has the internal consistency reliability. The coefficient obtained for the test-retest reliability shows that the scale yielded stable measurement results. In line with these results, it is possible to say that the developed scale can measure the tendencies of university students to academic dishonesty...|$|E

5000|$|... "Ubuntu" [...] as {{political}} philosophy has aspects of socialism, propagating the redistribution of wealth. This {{is similar to}} redistributive policies in liberalism. This socialisation is a vestige of agrarian peoples as a hedge against the crop failures of individuals. Socialisation presupposes a community population with which individuals empathise and concomitantly, {{have a vested interest}} in its collective prosperity. Urbanisation and the aggregation of people into an abstract and bureaucratic state undermines this empathy. African Intellectual historians like Michael Onyebuchi Eze have argued however that this ideal of [...] "collective responsibility" [...] must not be understood as absolute in which the <b>community's</b> <b>good</b> is prior to the individual's good. On this view, ubuntu it is argued, is a communitarian philosophy that is widely differentiated from the Western notion of communitarian socialism. In fact, ubuntu induces an ideal of shared human subjectivity that promotes a <b>community's</b> <b>good</b> through an unconditional recognition and appreciation of individual uniqueness and difference [...] Audrey Tang has suggested that Ubuntu [...] "implies that everyone has different skills and strengths; people are not isolated, and through mutual support they can help each other to complete themselves." ...|$|R
