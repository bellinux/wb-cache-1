50|$|The Wiz was the {{predecessor}} to the da Vinci Classic <b>color</b> <b>corrector</b> and {{was built in}} 1982 by VTA Technologies in Ft. Lauderdale. It was built on an Apple computer, the program was stored in EPROM and the list could be backed up to mini cassettes. The Wiz was the first color correction system to have a customized external control panel and {{was also the first}} <b>color</b> <b>corrector</b> with internal primary and secondary processing. Prior to that, the primaries in the telecine were used. The Wiz had 10 vector patented secondary color correction. The first two systems were bought by Editel, Chicago, which at the time used the <b>color</b> <b>corrector</b> on Bosch Fernseh's FDL60 telecine.|$|E

50|$|ACEScct (ACES color {{correction}} space with toe): A color space definition that is {{slightly larger than}} the ITU Rec.2020 color space and logarithmically encoded for improved use within <b>color</b> <b>correctors</b> and grading tools that resembles the toe behavior of Cineon files.|$|R
50|$|Although {{the basic}} {{controls}} of most color correction systems are similar, they differ somewhat in specific implementation and detail. The ASC CDL {{is a common}} standard that <b>color</b> <b>correctors</b> can translate their proprietary settings to and from. The ASC CDL functions are mathematically orthogonal primitives {{that can be used}} to represent vendor-specific corrections. ASC CDL correction functions also in some cases can appear in the user interface and be used directly.|$|R
50|$|For {{high-end}} systems many telecines {{are controlled}} by a Da Vinci Systems <b>color</b> <b>corrector</b> 2k or 2k Plus, which is also called color grading.|$|E
5000|$|... 1970-1971: <b>Color</b> <b>Corrector</b> {{which can}} provide color {{uniformity}} between television picture segments and scenes shot and recorded under different conditions {{at different times}} and locations ...|$|E
50|$|The da Vinci 2K <b>Color</b> <b>Corrector,</b> {{manufactured}} {{starting in}} 1998, {{was a completely}} revised color correction system that supported HDTV, SDTV, and 2K formats. The later system, the 2K Plus with improved <b>color</b> <b>corrector</b> tools was used on high-end DataCines and telecines like Thomson-Grass Valley's Spirit Datacine and Cintel's C-Reality & ITK Millennium. The 2K operated with a 4:2:2, 4:4:4 or 8:4:4 input in NTSC or Pal. In HDTV it operated with either 4:2:2 or 4:4:4 inputs. Many were interfaced to the Spirit DataCine.|$|E
5000|$|... da Vinci Systems was {{a digital}} cinema company founded in 1984, based in Coral Springs, Florida and wholly owned by JDSU. It {{was known for}} {{products}} like the 888, 2K and 2K Plus (hardware based <b>color</b> <b>correctors),</b> TLC, Resolve (GPU-based color grading and digital mastering systems) and Revival (film restoration and remastering systems) and its innovations include the color control panel based on trackballs and other discrete controls that enable colorists to control the software that manipulates motion picture images.|$|R
50|$|The {{evolution}} of digital color grading tools has {{advanced to the}} point where the colorist can use geometric shapes (such as mattes or masks in photo software such as Adobe Photoshop) to isolate color adjustments to specific areas of an image. These tools can highlight a wall in the background and color only that wall, leaving the rest of the frame alone, or color everything but that wall. Subsequent <b>color</b> <b>correctors</b> (typically software-based) have the ability to use spline-based shapes for even greater control over isolating color adjustments. Color keying is also used for isolating areas to adjust.|$|R
50|$|The {{line between}} {{hardware}} and software is blurring as many software-based <b>color</b> <b>correctors</b> (e.g. Pablo , Mistika, SCRATCH, Autodesk Lustre, Nucoda Film Master and Filmlight Baselight) use multi processor workstations and a GPU (graphics processing unit) {{as a means of}} hardware acceleration. As well, some newer software-based systems use a cluster of multiple parallel GPUs on the one computer system to improve performance at the very high resolutions required for feature film grading. e.g. Blackmagic Designs' DaVinci Resolve. Some color grading software like Synthetic Aperture's Color Finesse runs solely as software and will even run on low-end computer systems.|$|R
50|$|The Platinum Edition of Movie Studio has {{powerful}} {{color correction}} tools {{similar to the}} version on Vegas Pro, including a three-wheel <b>color</b> <b>corrector.</b> It also adds HDV and AVCHD-editing capabilities, but does not support SD or HD-SDI formats.|$|E
50|$|The 2000 movie O Brother, Where Art Thou? was scanned with Spirit DataCine, color {{corrected}} with a VDC-2000 and a Pandora Int. Pogle <b>Color</b> <b>Corrector</b> with MegaDEF. A Kodak Lightning II {{film recorder}} {{was used to}} output the data back on to film.|$|E
5000|$|A concealer or <b>color</b> <b>corrector</b> {{is a type}} of {{cosmetic}} that is used to mask dark circles, age spots, large pores, {{and other}} small blemishes visible on the skin. It is similar to foundation, but thicker and used to hide different pigments by blending the imperfection into the surrounding skin tone.|$|E
5000|$|... 1992 - In a {{significant}} development {{in addition to}} vector grading, Custom Curves {{were introduced to the}} Renaissance 888. 1994 - da Vinci Systems wholly acquired the TLC product line from Time Logic. The TLC is still viewed today as the de facto standard edit control interface between telecines, <b>color</b> <b>correctors,</b> VTRs and DDRs. TLC (Time Logic Controller) is an edit controller for telecines, vision mixers (switchers), and VTRs. It provides accurate 2:3 editing when transferring 24fps film in a 30fps video environment. TLC 1 was originally made in Moorpark, CA (started in Redondo Beach, then Simi Valley). The TLC 2 was released later that year under the da Vinci brand.|$|R
50|$|Most Spirit DataCines are {{controlled}} by a Da Vinci Systems <b>color</b> <b>corrector,</b> 2K or 2K Plus. Some {{are controlled}} by Pandora Int.'s Pogle, some with a their MegaDEF or a Pixi color grading system. A Spirit DataCine comes with a full function control panel {{that can be used}} for control and color grade.|$|E
5000|$|... 2003 - da Vinci Systems' parent company, Acterna, {{filed for}} Chapter 11 {{bankruptcy}} protection while reorganizing its business and emerged after just 5 months. da Vinci business was not affected and during this year while developing {{the concept of}} non linear grading from its Sierra Labs and 2K experience, the Resolve software <b>color</b> <b>corrector</b> has its first public showing.|$|E
50|$|In Hollywood, O Brother, Where Art Thou? was {{the first}} film to be wholly {{digitally}} graded. The negative was scanned with a Spirit DataCine at 2K resolution, then colors were digitally fine-tuned using a Pandora MegaDef <b>color</b> <b>corrector</b> on a Virtual DataCine. The process took several weeks, and the resulting digital master was output to film again with a Kodak laser recorder to create a master internegative.|$|E
5000|$|... da Vinci {{also made}} the da Vinci Light. This was not marketed, so not many were sold. It is a da Vinci DUI 888 without the digital 888 cards. The {{telecine}} interface card controlled the telecine's internal <b>color</b> <b>corrector.</b> This came in two configurations: {{the first was the}} DUI with an SGI Indy workstation; the second DUI system used an SGI O2 workstation. These systems supported da Vinci's new control panels.|$|E
50|$|Color {{correction}} {{control systems}} {{started with the}} Rank Cintel TOPSY (Telecine Operations Programming SYstem) in 1978. In 1984 Da Vinci Systems introduced their first <b>color</b> <b>corrector,</b> a computer-controlled interface that would manipulate the color voltages on the Rank Cintel MkIII systems. Since then, technology has improved to give extraordinary power to the digital colorist. Today there are many companies making color correction control interfaces including Da Vinci Systems, Pandora International, Pogle and more.|$|E
5000|$|... 1990 - Under {{direction}} from the parent company, da Vinci introduces a low cost <b>color</b> <b>corrector</b> for broadcasters and small post facilities. To reduce cost the stripped down telecine-only programmer, called Leonardo, used a flat plate (vision mixer style) control panel and provided only scene-by-scene control of a telecine (similar to Cintel's Amigo). Leonardo did not offer da Vinci color processing and was not successful in the market, with only one unit sold.|$|E
5000|$|For Clerc's second film, {{a sequel}} to Mousetrap {{entitled}} Mousetrap 2, he tripled his fundraising goal and raised $1,776. [...] After writing the script and shooting the film, Clerc worked with an international team of people for pre- and post-production. A VFX studio in Algeria handled special effects, color correction was performed by a <b>color</b> <b>corrector</b> from Florida, and a storyboard artist who worked with Breaking Bad created the storyboard. [...] The film premiered in November 2014.|$|E
5000|$|... 1983 - Public {{introduction}} to The Wiz. The system controlled early telecines (RCA FR-35, Bosch FDL60) and offered basic {{primary and secondary}} color correction. The Editel group of post production facilities in the US evaluated the technology and asked that VTA build multiple systems for them. About 15 units were made and subsequently purchased by other post facilities across the US. The Wiz was essentially the prototype for {{what would become the}} da Vinci <b>color</b> <b>corrector.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The 1998 movie Pleasantville was {{the first}} digital {{intermediate}} film scanned on a Spirit DataCine. This process produced the mix of B&W and color pictures. A movie released in 2000, O Brother, Where Art Thou? was scanned with Spirit Datacine, color corrected with a VDC-2000 using a Pandora Int. Pogle <b>Color</b> <b>Corrector</b> with MegaDEF. A Kodak Lightning II film recorder was used to put the data output back to film. This process changed the greens to a green-yellow color for the complete film.|$|E
5000|$|In 1999 the SDC 2001 {{replaced}} the SDC 2000, the SDC 2001 had {{the addition of}} an optional 6 vector resolution independent <b>color</b> <b>corrector.</b> An optional RGB resolution independent film grain reducer also became available for both the SDC 2000 and SDCs 2001 called the Scream film grain reducer. [...] Scream film grain reducer is a resolution independent three channel RGB grain reducer. Scream {{can be used on}} the Spirit DataCine and the VDC. [...] Also in 2000 the first D6 HDTV VTR is shown.|$|E
5000|$|... 1984 - The da Vinci Classic analog {{grading system}} was {{released}} {{and became the}} most popular <b>color</b> <b>corrector</b> for the Fernseh FDL 60 and Rank Cintel telecines (Mark 3 and URSA). It had a customized external control panel with internal primary and secondary processing and also an internal NTSC encoder. The Classic operated on a Motorola 68000 Multi Bus 1 system computer. The program and color correction list were stored on a 20MB MMF hard disk, with backup to a 5.25" [...] floppy disk.|$|E
5000|$|... 1984 - VTA Technologies, the R&D {{division}} of VTA Post, became da Vinci Systems, Inc. Development of the da Vinci <b>color</b> <b>corrector</b> continued. Other products {{added to the}} line included an editor, machine control system, and routing system. The da Vinci was the only film-to-tape or tape-to-tape color correction system on the market that offered the capability to create a basic rectangular window shape isolating a secondary color correction. As the da Vinci product line evolved, the original da Vinci {{became known as the}} da Vinci Classic.|$|E
5000|$|... 1995 - The 8:8:8 DUI (da Vinci User Interface) was {{introduced}} to the market. The DUI offered the same color processing as the Renaissance 8:8:8 but featured a new Windows style user interface, an SGI hosted operating system, a migration of the external TLC controller into the DUI, and EDWIN, an extension of the industry renowned Power Windows. The telecine interface card controlled the telecine's internal <b>color</b> <b>corrector.</b> The 888 DUI came in two configurations: the first was the DUI with an SGI Indy workstation; the second 888 DUI system used an SGI O2 workstation (affectionately called the Toaster). These systems also supported da Vinci's new control panels which became the industry standard. The panel layout and configuration is still in use today.|$|E
5000|$|A Spirit DataCines outputing DPX files {{was used}} in the 2000 movie O Brother, Where Art Thou?. The DPX files were color {{corrected}} with a VDC-2000 and a Pandora Int. Pogle <b>Color</b> <b>Corrector</b> with MegaDEF. [...] A Kodak Lightning II film recorder was used to put the data output to back to film. To output the movie the Spirit Datacine’s Phantom Transfer Engine software running on an SGI computer is used to record the DPX files from the Spirit DataCine. These files are stored in the virtual telecine or on a SAN hard disk storage array. The Phantom Transfer Engine has been replaced with Bones software running on a Linux-based PC. First generation of DPX interface for data files was the optical fiber HIPPI cables (up to 6 frame/s at 2K), the next generation interface is GSN-Gigabit Ethernet fiber Optic (up to 30 frame/s at 2K). GSN is also called HIPPI-6400 and was later renamed GSN (for Gigabyte System Network). The SAN hard disks are interfaces to by dual FC-Fibre Channel, cables. The newest DPX output interface is infiniband.|$|E
50|$|The video source {{could be}} from: a telecine, a video tape {{recorder}} (VTR), a motion picture film scanner, virtual telecine or a Direct to Disk Recording (DDR) or the older system called a film chain. A high end broadcast color suite may use a Da Vinci Systems or Pandora Int.'s <b>color</b> <b>corrector.</b> If a VTR is the source for the video the room is often called a tape to tape suite. Many suites are designed to operate as a telecine suite or a tape to tape suite by changing {{the configuration of the}} suite. The operator of the suite is usually called a Colorist. If a telecine is the source this is called a Film to Tape operation. A color suite may use one video standard or be able to change configuration to a number of standards like: high-definition video, NTSC, or PAL or a DI workflow. Color suites are sometime placed in digital cinema movie theaters with a video projector for color correction to that display format.|$|E
5000|$|Philips-BTS {{eventually}} evolved the FDL 60 {{into the}} FDL 90 in 1989 and then updated to the Quadra in 1993. These units {{were able to}} support super 35mm, super 16mm and super 8. The units were able to zoom and position the picture. The units outputted 4:4:4 digital video to feed a <b>color</b> <b>corrector</b> like the Da Vinci Systems 888. The units also had an optional analog output. The film path {{was similar to the}} Spirit Datacine, but this was the only similarity. FDL 90 and Quadra used a three Fairchild CCD 181 CCDs. Both had an optional Pal/NTSC switchable option. Both were 3/4 perf switchable. Many FDL-90 were updated to have the Quadra electronic circuit cards improvements. A true Quadra had a new capstan position closer to the film gate and with a blue color deck. [...] A line of stand alone SDTV Noise/Grain Reducers were made for use on the FDL 90, later telecines and tape to tape use, models: DNR7, MNR9, MNR10, MNR11 and the VS4.|$|E
5000|$|These {{are able}} to play out 2k data files in {{non-linear}} real time. Size, rotation and color correction-color grading are all able {{to be done in}} real time controlled by a telecine <b>color</b> <b>corrector.</b> A Silicon Graphics-SGI computer, a Origin 2000, is used to play the data files to [...] "Spirit DataCine hardware". The Virtual DataCine can output SDTV (NTSC or PAL) and HDTV-high definition or Data files DPX (or TIF), the same as the Datacine. First generation input/output interface for data files as the optical fiber HIPPI cables (up to 6 frame/s at 2k), the next generation interface is GSN-Gigabit Ethernet fibre Optic (up to 30 frame/s at 2k). GSN is also called HIPPI-6400 and was later renamed GSN (for Gigabyte System Network). The SAN hard disk are interfaces to the Virtual DataCine by dual FC-Fibre Channel, cables.Real time 2k Color Correction is done by a Pandora International's Pogle with a MegaDEF. Input and output 3D LUT-Look up tables are also used to control the look and standard of the clips.|$|E
5000|$|The Robert Bosch GmbH, Fernseh Div., {{which later}} became BTS inc. - Philips Digital Video Systems, Thomson's Grass Valley {{and now is}} DFT Digital Film Technology {{introduced}} the world's first CCD telecine in 1979, the FDL-60. The FDL-60 was designed and made in Darmstadt West Germany, {{this was the first}} all solid state Telecine. [...] FDL is short for Film Digital Line. The FDL-60 uses a three CCD single-line array system, whereby three lines, Red Green Blue (RGB) each with 1,024 pixels per line to record a single line of the film image. FDL60A uses three Fairchild Semiconductor CCD 133 CCDs for the image pickup. FDL60A released in 1979 used a 115 Volt lamp to light the film. The FDL60B released in 1982 added improve video quality features to the FDL60. The FDL60C released in 1987 used a Fairchild CCD 134 and a 24 volt light source. In 1983 an optional Grain Reduce was introduced by Bosch for the FDL-60, model FDGR 60. This was the first all digital noise reducer. The FDL 60 could operate stand alone or with a color grade system. Bosch made a scene by scene <b>color</b> <b>corrector,</b> model FRP 60, as an option for the FDL-60. About 568 FDL-60 telecines were manufacture from 1979 to 1989. FDL 60 were ordered in PAL or NTSC or Secam, a few were multi standard by changing a few electronic circuit cards.|$|E
50|$|Spirit DataCine is a {{telecine}} {{and/or a}} motion picture film scanner. This device {{is able to}} transfer 16mm and 35mm motion picture film to NTSC or PAL television standards or one of many High-definition television standards. With the data transfer option a Spirit DataCine can output DPX data files. The image pick up device is a solid state charge-coupled device. This eliminated the need for glass vacuum tube CRTs used on older telecines. The units can transfer negative film, primetime, intermediate film and print film, stock. One option is a Super 8 gate for the transfer of Super 8 mm film. With a sound pick up option, optical 16mm and 35mm sound can be reproduced, also 16mm magnetic strip sound. The unit can operate stand alone or be controlled by a scene by scene <b>color</b> <b>corrector.</b> Ken Burns, {{the creator of the}} The Civil War documentary film included in the DVD release, a short documentary on how he used the Spirit DataCine to transfer and remaster this film. The operator of the unit is called a Colorist or Colorist Assistant. The Spirit DataCine has become the standard for high-end real-time film transfer and scanning. Over 370 units are used in post production facilities around the world. Most current film productions are transferred on Spirit DataCines for TV, Digital television, Cable television, Satellite television, Direct-to-video, DVD, blu-ray Disc, pay-per-view, In-flight entertainment, Stock footage, Dailies, Film preservation, digital intermediate and digital cinema. The Spirit DataCine is made by DFT Digital Film Technology GmbH in Darmstadt, Germany.|$|E
5000|$|The MTV {{music video}} for the track was {{released}} in 1991 and was directed by Paul Rachman, who later directed {{the first version of}} the [...] "Sea of Sorrow" [...] music video for the band and the 2006 feature documentary American Hardcore. The music video was nominated for Best Heavy Metal/Hard Rock Video at the 1991 MTV Video Music Awards. The video is available on the home video releases Live Facelift and Music Bank: The Videos. The video shows the band performing in what is supposedly a barn, where throughout the video, a mysterious man wearing a black hooded cloak is shown roaming around the barn. Then, after the unknown hooded figure is shown, he is shown again looking around inside a stable where many animals live where he suddenly discovers and shines his flashlight on a man (Layne Staley) that he finds sitting {{in the corner of the}} barnhouse. At the end of the video, the hooded man finally pulls his hood down off of his head, only to reveal that his eyelids were sewn together with stitches the whole time. This part of the video depicts on the line of the song, [...] "Feed my eyes, now you've sewn them shut".The music video was shot on 16mm film and transferred to tape using a FDL 60 telecine. At the time this was the only device that could sync sound to picture at film rates as low as 6FPS.This is how the surreal motion was obtained. The sepia look was done by Claudius Neal using a daVinci <b>color</b> <b>corrector.</b>|$|E
