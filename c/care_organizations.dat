25|$|Overall, {{data are}} old with few studies {{published}} {{in the past few}} years, providing a limited picture of beneficiary experiences since the Affordable Care Act (ACA) was passed in 2010.

25|$|In addition, the law explores some {{programs}} intended to increase incentives to provide quality and collaborative care, such as accountable <b>care</b> <b>organizations.</b> The Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation {{was created to}} fund pilot programs which may reduce costs; the experiments cover nearly every idea healthcare experts advocate, except malpractice/tort reform. The law also requires for reduced Medicare reimbursements for hospitals with excess readmissions and eventually ties physician Medicare reimbursements to quality of care metrics.|$|E
25|$|For {{a health}} care institution, {{disclosing}} an unanticipated event should be made as soon as possible. Some health <b>care</b> <b>organizations</b> may have a policy regarding the disclosure of unanticipated events. The amount of information presented to those affected {{is dependent on the}} family's readiness and the organization's culture. The employee disclosing the event to family requires support from risk management, patient safety officers and senior leadership. Disclosures are objectively documented in the medical record.|$|E
25|$|The {{move into}} health care was {{particularly}} risky. The National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) of 1935 originally included {{health care workers}} from the protection of federal labor law, but the Taft-Hartley Act amendments exempted workers employed by non-profit health <b>care</b> <b>organizations</b> from the law in 1947. Since nearly all health <b>care</b> <b>organizations</b> {{at the time were}} non-profit, this effectively excluded the vast majority of health care workers from federal labor law. In 1962, Congress passed legislation allowing workers in health care institutions owned by the federal government to engage in collective bargaining. Publicly owned hospitals were covered by the NLRA in 1967, and non-profit nursing homes in 1970. Congress amended the Taft-Hartley Act in 1974 to bring non-profit hospitals back under the NLRA's coverage. BSEIU had organized its first hospital workers in San Francisco in the 1930s. Hardy's push into health care proceeded very slowly. Nationwide, only 2.3 percent of all health care institutions had a union in 1970. Despite a sharp upturn in the number of dismissals of health care workers for union activity in the 1950s and 1960s, Hardy had organized one of the largest pockets of unionized health care workers outside New York City by the late 1960s.|$|E

25|$|The IOM {{called for}} a broad {{national}} effort to include establishment of a Center for Patient Safety, expanded reporting of adverse events, development of safety programs in health <b>care</b> <b>organizations,</b> and attention by regulators, health care purchasers, and professional societies. The majority of media attention, however, focused on the staggering statistics: from 44,000 to 98,000 preventable deaths annually due to medical error in hospitals, 7,000 preventable deaths related to medication errors alone. Within 2 weeks of the report's release, Congress began hearings and President Clinton ordered a government-wide study of the feasibility of implementing the report's recommendations.|$|E
25|$|Medicare {{also has}} an {{important}} role driving changes in the entire health care system. Because Medicare pays for a huge share {{of health care in}} every region of the country, it {{has a great deal of}} power to set delivery and payment policies. For example, Medicare promoted the adaptation of prospective payments based on DRG’s, which prevents unscrupulous providers from setting their own exorbitant prices. Meanwhile, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act has given Medicare the mandate to promote cost-containment throughout the health care system, for example, by promoting the creation of accountable <b>care</b> <b>organizations</b> or by replacing fee-for-service payments with bundled payments.|$|E

25|$|Founded in 1951, the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations (JCAHO) is an independent, not-for-profit {{organization}} that evaluates and accredits nearly 15,000 health <b>care</b> <b>organizations</b> and {{programs in the}} United States. An organization must undergo an on-site survey by a Joint Commission survey team at least every three years. The scope of reviews by JCAHO is broad, including hospitals, home care agencies, medical equipment providers, nursing homes, rehabilitation facilities, surgical centers and medical laboratories. Passing a survey is crucial for most organizations, since accreditation by JCAHO is required for participation in Medicare and some state and private health care programs. Since the accreditation rate is over 90%, there have been questions raised regarding {{the effectiveness of these}} surveys.|$|E
25|$|Metrics {{applicable}} to the ED can be grouped into three main categories, volume, cycle time, and patient satisfaction. Volume metrics including arrivals per hour, percentage of ED beds occupied and age of patients are understood at a basic level at all hospitals as an indication for staffing requirements. Cycle time metrics are the mainstays of the evaluation and tracking of process efficiency and are less widespread since an active effort is needed to collect and analyze this data. Patient satisfaction metrics, already commonly collected by nursing groups, physician groups and hospitals, are useful in demonstrating the impact of changes in patient perception of care over time. Since patient satisfaction metrics are derivative and subjective, they are less useful in primary process improvement. Health information exchanges can reduce nonurgent ED visits by supplying current data about admissions, discharges, and transfers to health plans and accountable <b>care</b> <b>organizations,</b> allowing them to shift ED use to primary care settings.|$|E
