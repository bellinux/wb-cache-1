Professor of {{literature}} Basil Willey commented in 1956, [...] "In 'Ulysses' {{the sense that he}} must press on and not moulder in idleness is expressed objectively, through the classical story, and not subjectively as his own experience.

500|$|The company {{contemplated}} {{purchasing the}} Argonauts of the CFL at least twice, with minority partner Tanenbaum keen {{to add the}} team to his list of franchises, but concluded that the cost and effort {{that would be required}} to make the team profitable was not worth the minimal financial upside. [...] In 2013, it was reported that the company was again considering purchasing the team and having them play at a renovated BMO Field, with the asking price reportedly $20 million, but later coming down to $10 million. [...] A vote by MLSE's board on purchasing the team was called in December 2013, but they were unable to come to an agreement on the issue. [...] On May 20, 2015 it was announced that two of the three ownership partners of MLSE, Bell Canada and Tanenbaum's Kilmer Group, had acquired ownership of the Argos, with the deal to close {{at the end of the}} year, and would move the team to BMO Field for the 2016 season. It has been speculated that Rogers was not interested in investing in the team since Bell has exclusive rights to broadcast all CFL games. It is thought that control of the Argos by MLSE will enhance Toronto's chances of acquiring an NFL franchise, with Peddie saying [...] "the NFL is telling them that if you want an NFL team, you better make sure the Argos are okay." [...] Leiweke has said that moving into a renovated BMO field [...] "will help turn [...] around" [...] and that [...] "there's no way the NFL <b>comes</b> <b>here</b> without the CFL being unbelievably successful first." ...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an investigation of}} the acoustic correlates of the semantic phenomenon of focus. Focus By the term focus roughly the following phenomenon is intended. In a normal declarative sentence what is asserted by the sentence can be controlled by a change of stress. Consider the following examples, where the word that is stressed is italicized. (1) Bill <b>came</b> <b>here</b> in a car. (2) Bill <b>came</b> <b>here</b> in a car. (3) Bill <b>came</b> <b>here</b> in a car. The same effect can be achieved syntactically by clefting. (4) It was Bill who <b>came</b> <b>here</b> in a car. (5) It was a car Bill <b>came</b> <b>here</b> in. In (1) we are asserting about Bill that he <b>came</b> <b>here</b> in a car. In (2) and (3) something different is asserted; in (2) we know that someone came here: what is asserted is that it was Bill, in (3) we know that Bill <b>came</b> <b>here</b> in some fashion and assert that it was in a car.
