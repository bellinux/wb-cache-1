5|$|Blancornelas {{covered the}} rise of Mexico's drug {{trafficking}} organizations for more than thirty years, but his best {{work in the field}} took place during the 1990s. During this period, Mexico experienced {{the rise of}} three powerful drug cartels: the Tijuana <b>Cartel</b> in the west; the Juárez <b>Cartel</b> in Ciudad Juárez; and the Gulf <b>Cartel</b> in the east. Blancornelas' stories are considered so crucial that almost every written account of the Tijuana <b>Cartel</b> cites him.|$|E
5|$|Both of the Gulf <b>Cartel</b> leaders {{ignored the}} command, and Treviño Morales moved swiftly to avenge {{the death of}} his former comrade. On 30 January 2010, Treviño Morales kidnapped and {{slaughtered}} 16 Gulf <b>Cartel</b> members in Reynosa, Tamaulipas, marking the start of the <b>cartel</b> war between the Gulf <b>Cartel</b> and Los Zetas in the Mexican states of Tamaulipas, Nuevo León, and Veracruz that has led to thousands of deaths. Los Zetas used violent and intimidatory tactics to expand, forging a reputation as Mexico's most violent drug trafficking organization. It managed to take control of most of the territories owned by the Gulf <b>Cartel</b> when they had essentially served as a single organization. With Treviño Morales as the second-in-command of the criminal organization, Los Zetas began killing Gulf <b>Cartel</b> members and other rival drug traffickers en masse and winning their territories.|$|E
5|$|Antonio Ezequiel was {{succeeded by}} Costilla Sánchez {{and his brother}} Mario Cárdenas Guillén, arrested on 3 September 2012. His nephew Rafael Cárdenas Vela became the {{regional}} leader of the Gulf <b>Cartel</b> in Matamoros but he was displaced by Costilla Sánchez and was arrested on 20 October 2011. A month later on November 2011, Antonio Ezequiel's son Ezequiel Cárdenas Rivera was arrested by the Navy along with for other Gulf <b>Cartel</b> members in Matamoros. Since Antonio Ezequiel was killed, the Gulf <b>Cartel</b> separated into two different factions: Los Rojos, a group loyal to the Cárdenas Guillén family; and Los Metros, a group started by Costilla Sánchez.|$|E
50|$|A {{survey of}} {{hundreds}} of published economic studies and legal decisions of antitrust authorities found that the median price increase achieved by <b>cartels</b> in the last 200 years is 25%. Private international <b>cartels</b> (those with participants from two or more nations) had an average price increase of 28%, whereas domestic <b>cartels</b> averaged 18%. Less than 10% of all <b>cartels</b> in the sample failed to raise market prices.|$|R

Javier and Salazar's efforts begin to cripple the Obregón brothers' cocaine outfit, but Javier soon discovers Salazar is a pawn for the Juárez <b>Cartel,</b> the rival of the Obregón brothers. That entire portion of the Mexican anti-drug campaign is a fraud, as Salazar is wiping out one <b>cartel</b> because he has aligned with another for profit.|$|E
5|$|By 2006, the Gulf <b>Cartel</b> and Los Zetas {{managed to}} defeat {{the forces of the}} Sinaloa <b>Cartel</b> in Nuevo Laredo. The latter <b>cartel</b> {{concentrated}} its efforts in northeastern Mexico, becoming dominant there. Los Zetas started to expand into other criminal activities beyond drug trafficking. Under Treviño Morales, the organization smuggled immigrants to the United States, carried out extortions and kidnappings, sold bootlegged CDs and DVDs, and intimidated and/or killed residents who failed to cooperate with them. Treviño Morales remained in charge of Los Zetas in the state of Nuevo León and in Piedras Negras, Coahuila, until March 2007. He was reassigned to the coastal state of Veracruz, shortly after high-ranking Zetas leader Efraín Teodoro Torres (alias Z-14) was killed in a gun battle at a local horse race. Though Cárdenas Guillén was imprisoned in 2003, he reportedly directed the Gulf <b>Cartel</b> and Los Zetas behind bars; when he was extradited to the United States in 2007, Treviño Morales and Heriberto Lazcano Lazcano pushed for Los Zetas' independence from the Gulf <b>Cartel.</b>|$|E
5|$|Cárdenas Guillén {{was arrested}} in Matamoros, Tamaulipas, in 2003 and extradited to the United States in 2007. While in prison in Mexico, he {{reportedly}} coordinated the Gulf <b>Cartel</b> and Los Zetas from his prison cell. But with his extradition, Treviño Morales's organization experienced a leadership crisis. La Compañía (The Company), a name {{used to describe the}} Gulf <b>Cartel</b> and Los Zetas as a conglomerate, remained in a loose cooperation until early 2010, when violence erupted between both groups. On 18 January 2010, several members of the Gulf <b>Cartel</b> kidnapped Víctor Peña Mendoza (alias Concord 3), a leader of Los Zetas and close associate and friend of Treviño Morales. When he was held captive, Peña Mendoza was asked to switch alliances and join the Gulf <b>Cartel,</b> but he refused, earning a beating followed by execution, presumably carried out by Samuel Flores Borrego.|$|E
2500|$|The 2010 NPR {{report also}} stated that Sinaloa was {{colluding}} with the government to destroy other <b>cartels</b> and protect itself and its leader, 'Chapo'. Mexican officials denied any corruption in the government's treatment of drug <b>cartels.</b> <b>Cartels</b> had previously been reported as difficult to prosecute [...] "because members of the <b>cartels</b> have infiltrated and corrupted the law enforcement organizations {{that are supposed to}} prosecute them, such as the Office of the Attorney General." ...|$|R
50|$|Over {{the past}} few decades drug <b>cartels</b> have become {{integrated}} into Mexico’s economy. Approximately 500 cities are directly engaged in drug trafficking and nearly 450,000 people are employed by drug <b>cartels.</b> Additionally, the livelihood of 3.2 million people is dependent on the drug <b>cartels.</b> Between local and international sales, such as to Europe and the United States, drug <b>cartels</b> in Mexico see a $25-30bn yearly profit, a great deal of which circulates through international banks such as HSBC. Drug <b>cartels</b> are fundamental in local economics. A percentage of the profits seen from the trade are invested in the local community. Such profits contribute to the education and healthcare of the community. While these <b>cartels</b> bring violence and hazards into communities, they create jobs and provide income for its many members.|$|R
25|$|Mexican <b>cartels</b> control large {{swaths of}} Mexican {{territory}} {{and dozens of}} municipalities, and they exercise increasing influence in Mexican electoral politics. The <b>cartels</b> are waging violent turf battles over control of key smuggling corridors from Matamoros to San Diego. Mexican <b>cartels</b> employ hitmen and groups of enforcers, known as sicarios. The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration reports that the Mexican drug <b>cartels</b> operating today along the border are far more sophisticated and dangerous than any other organized criminal group in U.S. law enforcement history. The <b>cartels</b> use grenade launchers, automatic weapons, body armor, Kevlar helmets, and sometimes unmanned aerial vehicles. Some groups have also been known to use improvised explosive devices (IEDs).|$|R
5|$|Francisco Rafael Arellano Félix (24 October 1949 – 18 October 2013) was a Mexican drug {{lord and}} former {{leader of the}} Tijuana <b>Cartel,</b> a drug {{trafficking}} organization. He was the oldest of seven brothers and headed the criminal organization early in the 1990s alongside them. Through his brother Benjamín, Francisco Rafael joined the Tijuana <b>Cartel</b> in 1989 following the arrest of Miguel Ángel Félix Gallardo, {{one of the most}} prominent drug czars in Mexico during the 1980s. When the Arellano Félix took control of the organization in the early 1990s, tensions with the rival Sinaloa <b>Cartel</b> prompted violent attacks and slayings from both fronts.|$|E
5|$|In 2003, Osiel {{was arrested}} in Matamoros {{following}} a shootout with the Mexican military, and was extradited to the United States in 2007. In exchange for a life sentence, Osiel cooperated with the U.S. authorities by supplying information on {{the workings of the}} Gulf <b>Cartel</b> and Los Zetas. When Osiel was arrested, Antonio Ezequiel inherited the Gulf <b>Cartel</b> along with Jorge Eduardo Costilla Sánchez, a former policeman in Matamoros. He and other Gulf <b>Cartel</b> leaders were responsible for trafficking multi-ton drug shipments of cocaine and marijuana from Mexico to the United States. Antonio Ezequiel received a federal indictment in 2008 in the District of Columbia for drug trafficking violations. He also directed the flow of narcotics through land, sea, and air from Venezuela and Colombia to Guatemala and the U.S-Mexico border. When Osiel was imprisoned, several high-ranking lieutenants in the Gulf <b>Cartel</b> got together to appoint leaders and their turfs. According to the declarations of Zeta leader Mateo Díaz López (alias Comandante Mateo), Antonio Ezequiel was given the turf of Matamoros, one of the leading smuggling routes for the <b>cartel.</b> But Antonio Ezequiel never had the edge; one of his most trusted men, Ramiro García Hernández (alias El Mati), {{was arrested in}} 2004. Deemed inexperienced, Costilla Sánchez, Lazcano, and high-ranking leader Víctor Manuel Vázquez Mireles (alias El Meme Loco) moved Antonio Ezequiel to command the Gulf <b>Cartel</b> in Cancún. But after failing to meet the Gulf Cartel's demands, he was replaced.|$|E
5|$|In November 2007, {{the city}} of Laredo, Texas, issued an arrest warrant for Treviño in {{connection}} with a 2006 double homicide in Texas. In 2008, Treviño Morales and Lazcano Lazcano, the two leaders of Los Zetas, forged an alliance with the Beltrán Leyva <b>Cartel.</b> It had just gone to war with the Sinaloa <b>Cartel,</b> believing that El Chapo Guzmán, their leader, had betrayed them. Treviño Morales subsequently joined them to kill the leader of the Sinaloa <b>Cartel.</b> Government sources said Los Zetas were fighting for control against La Federación (The Federation), an alliance of several drug trafficking groups led by Joaquín El Chapo Guzmán and Ismael El Mayo Zambada, two drug lords who used to work for the Beltrán Leyva <b>Cartel.</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{enforcement}} {{record of}} the 1990 s has demonstrated that international private <b>cartels</b> are neither relics of the past nor do they always fall quickly {{under the weight of}} their own incentive problems. Of a sample of forty <b>cartels</b> prosecuted by the United States and European Inion in the 1990 s, twenty-four <b>cartels</b> lasted at least four years. And for the twenty of the <b>cartels</b> in this sample where sales data are available, the annual worldwide sales in the affected products exceeded US$ 30 billion. Prevailing national competition policies are oriented towards addressing harm done in domestic markets, and in some cases merely prohibit <b>cartels</b> without taking strong enforcement measures. In this paper we propose a sequence of reforms to national policies and to international cooperation that will strengthen the deterrents against international <b>cartels.</b> Furthermore, aggressive prosecution of <b>cartels</b> must be complemented by vigilance in other areas of competition policy. If not, firms will respond to the enhanced deterrents to cartelisation by merging or by taking other measures that lessen competitive pressures. Copyright Blackwell Publishers Ltd 2001. ...|$|R

5|$|In {{the early}} 2000s, Ramírez Treviño {{was a close}} {{associate}} of Jaime González Durán (El Hummer), a founder and top leader of Los Zetas drug <b>cartel.</b> In 2008, González Durán was arrested and sentenced to 35 years in prison; by 2010, Los Zetas, who were working as the armed wing of the Gulf <b>Cartel,</b> separated from the organization to operate independently. Both criminal organizations went to war with each other, but Ramírez Treviño remained in the Gulf <b>Cartel.</b> Under the tutelage of Samuel Flores Borrego (El Metro 3), he worked as the second-in-command for the criminal organization in Reynosa, Tamaulipas. In an apparent power struggle within the Gulf <b>Cartel,</b> however, El Metro 3 was killed, and he became the regional kingpin in September 2011.|$|E

5|$|The {{death of}} Ramírez Treviño's boss {{triggered}} a war within the Gulf <b>Cartel,</b> {{resulting in the}} deaths and arrests of several high-ranking drug traffickers from 2011 to 2013. When the Gulf Cartel's top leaders Mario Cárdenas Guillén and Jorge Eduardo Costilla Sánchez were arrested in early September 2012, Ramírez Treviño decided to step up for the job and become the undisputed leader of the <b>cartel.</b> In efforts to keep the Gulf <b>Cartel</b> under a single command structure, he ordered the assassination of high-ranking drug trafficker El Metro 4 on 15 January 2013 in Reynosa.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article is to survey recent {{experimental}} studies on leniency programs, which have been introduced in competition policies around the world. Some theoretical studies show that leniency programs are effective to dissolve <b>cartels,</b> but they are not strong enough to deter new <b>cartels</b> from being formed. Although one empirical study confirms that leniency programs are effective to dissolve <b>cartels,</b> it is hard to judge from field data whether leniency programs deter <b>cartels</b> and how they influence market prices. To solve these issues, experimental economics studies on leniency programs have been conducted. Most of them also discovered that leniency programs are effective to dissolve <b>cartels.</b> However, it is still necessary to continue to carry out experimental studies to examine the effects on the stability of <b>cartels</b> and market prices, in terms of institutional parameters, such as the investigation frequency, timing of whistle blowing, and the number of firms which can receive leniency...|$|R
