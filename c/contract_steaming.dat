50|$|In his autobiographical journal, ‘Ten Years of Gentleman Farming’, {{published}} in 1874, Lawson humorously alluded to his three big mistakes; {{the purchase of}} a steam plough; the procurement of low priced guano; and the elevation of his father's coachmen to the position of headman. All of these occurred upon his possession of Blennerhasset Farm in 1862; an estate his father had previously purchased for the sum of £17,000. The estate comprised 333 acre, and incorporated a water wheel, a group of cottages, and a number of derelict farm buildings. In the weeks before assuming control of the farm Lawson travelled extensively throughout Britain seeking agricultural advice, visiting many good farms and farming districts; particularly those that applied ‘model farming’ techniques. Lawson began a programme of improvement. He bought an additional 87 acre of land. He changed the title to the ‘Model Farm’, then to Mechi, and later back to the Blennerhasset Farm. He removed miles of unwanted fences, thousands of tons of stone, constructed miles of new roads, and drained the waterlogged land. Besides the farming scheme, he also established a market garden, artificial manure works, a laboratory, a free library, a free school, a gas works, a medical dispensary and several grocery stores. He also <b>contracted</b> the <b>steam</b> cultivator, and founded a flax business.|$|R
40|$|An {{acoustic}} {{leak detection}} facility was completed {{and used to}} evaluate the capability of piezoelectric sensors, accelerometers, and capacitance microphones to detect and locate gas and water leaks in underground district heating and cooling (DHC) piping. Leak detection sensitivity and location capabilities for DHC systems were estimated from laboratory data and from data obtained from the underground DH system in Scranton, Pennsylvania, where acoustic background noise levels and acoustic signals from field-induced steam leaks were acquired. Acoustic detection of leaks with flow rates of less than 10 gpm is possible at a distance of several hundred meters, with a location accuracy of a few meters. Although steam leaks of comparable mass loss can be detected over a similar range with transducers mounted on the pipe outer wall, location accuracy of a few meters over this range may only be possible with transducers in direct <b>contract</b> with the <b>steam.</b> Intrusive sensors may also be necessary to detect and locate leaks in plastic pipe...|$|R

Podane zostały względne wartości produkcji dla rozpatrywanych przypadków wzbogacania. ABSTRACT: Stabilization of coal quality {{parameters}} is {{an important}} technological problem especially {{in the presence of}} variable raw coal characteristics such as coal size distribution and its washability. Local control systems for gravitational preparation processes have been introduced (the control of the density of separation in heavy media vessels and the refuse discharge in jigs) to compensate the influence of various disturbances on the performance of technology. The main task of these local control systems is to stabilize technological chosen parameters on the desired level, which makes it easier to keep the quality of coal within the limits of declared price and allows to control final products parameters according to the terms of the <b>contract.</b> Concentrates of <b>steam</b> or coking coal are often produced in a system of parallel processes of coal separation in heavy media vessels, jigs and flotation. In such a system there usually exists an optimal point of work (global extremum) for which the maximum amount of the final concentrate with desired ash content can be obtained. The final product of desired quality (ash content) can be produced for various set values of the densities of separation in both processes so that the blending of two components would give product of desired quality. Further analysis will show that the considered system has the characteristic of the extreme object i. e. that for the desired ash content in the product it is possible to choose optimal separation densities for which the system produces the maximum amount of the blend or the maximum value of the product [1]. In the paper an application of computer simulation program for coal preparation processes analysis and their control has been presented. The integral part of this software is an algorithm of searching the function algorithm of control target, i. e. the maximum production function of preset quality. In the paper is presented results of analysis part of coal preparation system, that is two jigs. These results relate detailed analyses one of certain of plant reviewed in the study [11]. Value of separation density was desired in one jigs, but in second jigs the value of separation density was calculated as optimum value. The density of separation in jigs can be changed indirectly, for instance by the adjustment of the float position linked with refuse removal gate. Relative values were given to the production for examined cases of enriching. KEYWORDS: coal jigging, control of technological processes, optimization of coal preparation processes, parallel processes of coal separation.
