First indication of Crew's realization {{of the presence of}} bad weather en route to Kinshasa was evident at 12:37, when the aircraft was between position GURUT and UDRID, over 100 NMs from Kinshasa. The crew got this indication through their on-board weather radar. At 12:38, the crew again discussed the weather when the <b>Captain</b> <b>said</b> that the (radar) beam was clearly showing the clouds. extended communication amongst the crew of extreme bad weather being present at and around Kinshasa and the way to avoid it, is heard on the CVR. The co-pilot exclaimed at 12:45 that the weather return being picked up on their radar was very big. Crew also discussed that the clouds were moving, so in next 10 minutes needed to reach the airfield, the clouds would have moved off the airfield. They also seemed to have a doubt whether the returns being picked up on the weather radar were ground echoes or were severe weather (Magenta) indications. The co-pilot confirmed that the returns were not ground echoes but were radar returns (Magenta) from very severe weather.|$|E

2500|$|Mallow Racecourse, {{now known}} as Cork Racecourse, became an {{emergency}} airfield on 18 April 1983, when a Mexican Gulfstream II business jet piloted by Captain Reuben Ocaña made a precautionary landing. A temporary tarmacadam runway of 910 m (3,000ft) in length which was {{paid for by the}} plane's insurers was laid to enable the aircraft to leave five weeks later, whereas in the meantime Captain Ocaña became a local celebrity. On 23 May 1983 just before the plane departed, the <b>Captain</b> <b>said</b> his farewell to the people of Ireland in the Irish language. [...] The runway was subsequently utilised for parking during race meets and was a popular facility for learner driving. Light aircraft have occasionally landed at the racecourse on the grass area. The F3A World Model Aircraft Aerobatic Championship was held there in 2001. The 1983 incident formed the basis of the 2010 film The Runway.|$|E
2500|$|E. Gorynov (another Tu-144 test pilot) {{stated that}} he is {{completely}} sure that usage of these experimental technologies was not decided by the crew.

[...] This is further supported by the fact that after a meeting held in the evening before the flight, G. N. Bazhenov (the navigator on the flight) went to speak with E. Gorynov, who stated in the documentary that Bazhenov was very worried, and said the leadership had [...] "come up with something", but {{that he would not be}} able to disclose anything in detail.

At 15:30 the operational management of the shipping company inquired about the situation and it was decided that company would contact the maritime rescue co-ordination centre (MRCC) which, in turn, would later contact the ship. When MRCC Turku contacted Herakles-Bulk at 15:51, the <b>captain</b> <b>said</b> that he was not sure if the bow could be kept facing the wind. He then decided to send half of the crew off the ship because there would be a danger of the vessel capsizing if the combination turned broadside to the wind.|$|E
2500|$|During {{the last}} few seconds, the {{aircraft}} climbed to 3,090 feet. The Captain put in 52 degrees of bank to turn the aircraft, and also made some nose down inputs. Therefore, the aircraft pitched down, speed increased and auto thrust commanded the engines to spool down to keep airspeed on the target speed. The aircraft started to descend at a high rate. Unfortunately in his panic, the Captain continued to move the heading knob without actually looking at it, but failed to pull the knob to activate it. When he did activate it, the aircraft turned towards the heading knob that had been rotated too far, to 25 degrees, and stayed on that course until end of recording. At 04:40:49 the <b>Captain</b> <b>said</b> to the First Officer [...] "Why the aircraft is not turning left?" [...] The aircraft then slammed into Margala Hills and exploded. The First Officer's last words could be heard saying to the Captain [...] "Sir we are going down! Sir we are going do—".|$|E

He moved to Belfast after marrying a girl from Northern Ireland. As early as 2005, when he finished top of the Northern Cricket Union batting averages and was named Northern Ireland Player of the Year, there was speculation that West might play for Ireland. At the end of the 2005 season, West moved back to Instonians where he was a local player rather than a professional, stating [...] "I enjoyed my two years at Bangor and made a lot of friends there, however, now that I am working full time [...] and living in Belfast it seemed a natural move to come back to Instonians". During his second stint with Instonians, West was occasionally suffered disciplinary problems, and on his departure from the club to join Civil Service North at the end of 2007, West said [...] "I don't want to see another disciplinary committee room.
