A numerical and analytical model was constructed to determine the resultant stress state imposed on a Rock Melt Drill produced <b>liner.</b> <b>The</b> {{purpose of this study was}} to determine if <b>the</b> <b>liner</b> produced would possess the strength required to prevent a failure in the borehole wall.

40|$|AbstractLining {{internally}} {{a carbon}} steel pipe {{with a thin}} layer of corrosion resistant material is an economical method for protecting offshore tubulars from the corrosive ingredients of hydrocarbons. In applications involving severe plastic bending, such as in the reeling installation process, <b>the</b> <b>liner</b> can detach from the outer pipe and develop large amplitude buckles that compromise the flow. This paper outlines a numerical framework for establishing the extent to which lined pipe can be bent before <b>liner</b> <b>collapse.</b> <b>The</b> modeling starts with the simulation of the inflation process through which the two tubes develop interference contact pressure. Bending the composite structure leads to differential ovalization and eventually separation of part of <b>the</b> <b>liner</b> from <b>the</b> outer pipe. The unsupported strip of <b>the</b> <b>liner</b> on <b>the</b> compressed side first wrinkles and at higher curvature buckles and collapses in a diamond shaped mode. The sensitivity of <b>the</b> <b>collapse</b> curvature to <b>the</b> various parameters of the problem is studied, and amongst other findings <b>the</b> onset of <b>collapse</b> is shown to be very sensitive to small geometric imperfections in <b>the</b> <b>liner.</b> It is also demonstrated that bending the pipe under modest amounts of internal pressure can delay liner collapse to curvatures that make it reelable...|$|R
40|$|In {{addition}} to its various military applications, shaped charges {{have been used in}} oil industry as an oil well perforator (OWP) to connect oil and gas to their reservoirs. <b>The</b> <b>collapse</b> of <b>the</b> <b>liner</b> material under <b>the</b> explosive load produces a hypervelocity jet capable of achieving a deep penetration tunnel into the rock formation. The achieved penetration depends on the OWP design, which includes the geometry and the material of the explosive and <b>the</b> <b>liner</b> as well as the initiation mode and the casing of the shaped charge. The main purpose of this research is to assess the performance of OWP with different design aspects in terms of its penetration depth into concrete material. This research employed the Autodyn finite difference code to model the behaviour of OWPs in <b>the</b> stages of <b>liner</b> <b>collapse,</b> jet formation and jet penetration. The design parameters of OWPs were studied quantitatively to identify the effect of each individual parameter on the jet characteristics and the jet penetration depth into concrete material according to the API-RP 43 standard test configuration. In order to validate the Autodyn jetting analysis, this research compared the jetting simulation results of copper OWP liners with those obtained from flash x-ray measurements while the numerical jet penetration into the laminated concrete target was validated experimentally by the static firing of OWPs. Above-mentioned experiments were designed and performed in this project. The validated hydrocode was implemented in this research to study the effects of the concrete target strength, <b>the</b> <b>liner</b> material and <b>the</b> <b>liner</b> shape on <b>the</b> jet penetration depth into concrete targets. For the target strength, the traditional virtual origin (VO) penetration model was modified to include a strength reduction term based on Johnson’s damage number and the effect of the underground confinement pressure using Drucker-Prager model. The VO analytical model is also implemented in <b>the</b> <b>liner</b> material study to account for the jet density reduction phenomena and its induced reduction of jet penetration capability. The jets obtained from machined copper and zirconium liners and from copper-tungsten powder <b>liner</b> all exhibited <b>the</b> density reduction phenomena. The modified VO model considers the non-uniform distribution of jet density based on the jet profile analysis using Autodyn and the experimental soft recovery for some tested <b>liners.</b> <b>The</b> results lead to a modified VO penetration model including the non-uniform jet density effect. For zirconium liner material, numerical and analytical studies were conducted for different flow velocities and different collapse angles {{in order to determine the}} boundaries between the jetting and non-jetting phases and whether a coherent or a non-coherent jet will form. This study indicated that the suggested four different liner shapes (i. e. the conical, the biconical, the hemispherical and the bell) will produce coherent jet when the zirconium is used as OWP <b>liner.</b> <b>The</b> validated Autodyn hydrocode is also used in this thesis to calculate the velocity difference between two neighbouring zirconium jet fragments. The velocity difference is related directly to the breakup time of an OWP jet, and thus, it is calculated for a range of zirconium liners with different <b>liner</b> wall thicknesses. <b>The</b> calculated values of velocity difference gave a clear insight for the breakup time formulae for zirconium jet in terms of <b>the</b> <b>liner</b> thickness and <b>the</b> charge diameter.

The Ultra Super Low and the Extreme Low pressure-indicating films were tested on two types of artificial teat. The experiments were performed with a conventional milking cluster equipped with round silicone liners. For each teat and film type, 30 repetitions were performed. Each repetition was performed with a new piece of film. Kruskal-Wallis tests were performed to detect differences between the pressure values for the different teats. The area of regions where pressure-indication color developed was calculated to determine the most suitable film type.

A parametric study is undertaken to determine the effect of the geometrical parameters (e. g. liner thickness to radius ratio, imperfection size, ovality and size of gap between <b>the</b> <b>liner</b> and <b>the</b> host pipe). A comparison is made with experimental data available for circular liners, and there is good agreement with the numerical solution.;It is shown that critical external fluid pressure depends heavily on <b>the</b> ratio of <b>liner</b> thickness to radius. Thick liners experience a modest stability increase as a result of host pipe support compared to the significant stability increase for thin liners. Local geometrical imperfections have a very substantial effect on the buckling strength.

Stability of loosely fitted liners degrades seriously if a significant gap exists between <b>the</b> <b>liner</b> and <b>the</b> host pipe, particularly when <b>the</b> <b>liner</b> is thin.

It uses a material liner to compress and contain a magnetized plasma. For practical applications, standoff drivers to deliver the imploding momentum flux to the target plasma remotely are required. Spherically converging plasma jets have been proposed as standoff drivers for this purpose. The concept involves the dynamic formation of a spherical plasma <b>liner</b> by <b>the</b> merging of plasma jets, {{and the use of}} <b>the</b> <b>liner</b> so formed to compress a spheromak or a field reversed configuration (FRC). For the successful implementation of the scheme, plasma jets of the requisite momentum flux density need to be produced. Their transport over sufficiently large distances (a few meters) needs to be assured. When they collide and merge into a liner, relative differences in velocity, density and temperature of the jets could give rise to instabilities in the development of <b>the</b> <b>liner.</b> Variation in <b>the</b> jet properties must be controlled to ensure that the growth rate of the instabilities are not significant over the time scale of <b>the</b> <b>liner</b> formation before engaging with the target plasma.
