40|$|In this paper, {{we explore}} motivations for {{political}} participation within a community-based energy initiative, Clean Energy Resource Teams (<b>CERTs).</b> Using both {{quantitative and qualitative}} approaches, we examine what types of selective incentives citizens receive for working within <b>CERTs,</b> and which incentives are likely to prove most powerful over the long term. We surveyed members of the various regional teams one year into the program and then again two years later, asking about motivations for participation, recruitment, technical knowledge of energy issues, and measures of success within <b>CERTs.</b> We also asked citizens about the perceived impact of the organization, which, along with measures of success, is a crucial but difficult element to assess. Our analysis also includes six focus groups, one in each region, involving the most active of the <b>CERTs</b> members. Driving across the state to conduct focus groups allowed for an additional dimension to be considered, that is, the connection between meeting attendance, geography, {{and a sense of}} ownership within <b>CERTs.</b> The great geographical distances involved in getting citizens together for face-to-face meetings in certain regions are a genuine concern and potential irony for members of community-based energy initiatives. ...|$|R

40|$|Group A rotaviruses (RVAs) are {{the primary}} cause of acute {{gastroenteritis}} (AGE) in young children worldwide. Several commercial tests including latex agglutination, enzyme-linked assays (ELISA) and immunochromatographic tests (ICT) have been developed for the diagnosis of RVA infection. In the present study, the performance of two commercially available one-step chromatographic immunoassays, <b>CerTest</b> Rotavirus + Adenovirus (Biotec S. L, Zaragoza, Spain) and Vikia Rota-Adeno (bioMerieux SA, Lyon, France) were retrospectively evaluated using Real-time PCR as reference test. Re-testing by Real-time PCR of 2096 stool samples of children hospitalized with AGE previously screened by ICTs (1467 by <b>CerTest</b> and 629 by Vikia) allowed to calculate higher sensitivity for Vikia (94 % vs 85 % of <b>CerTest)</b> and higher specificity for <b>CerTest</b> (93 % vs 89 % of Vikia). Accordingly, higher Positive Predictive Values (87 % vs 78 %) and Positive Likelihood Ratios (12. 32 vs 8. 8) were found for <b>CerTest</b> and lower Negative Predictive Values (91 % vs 97 %) and Negative Likelihood Ratios (0. 16 vs 0. 06) for Vikia. However, both <b>CerTest</b> and Vikia showed a substantial agreement (κ =  0. 79) with the Real-time PCR. A correlation between false negative results by ICTs and high Cycle Threshold values of Real-time PCR, indicative of low viral load, was observed. False positive results by the two ICT assays were not related to Norovirus, Adenovirus or Astrovirus infections, therefore the risk of cross-reactions was excluded. Both <b>CerTest</b> and VIKIA were able to detect the wide range of RVA genotypes circulating over the study period (including G 1 P[8], G 2 P[4], G 3, G 4, G 9 and G 12 P[8]).
