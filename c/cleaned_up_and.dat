5|$|The tomb of Archimedes {{carried a}} {{sculpture}} illustrating his favorite mathematical proof, {{consisting of a}} sphere and a cylinder of the same height and diameter. Archimedes had proven that the volume and surface area of the sphere are two thirds that of the cylinder including its bases. In 75BC, 137 years after his death, the Roman orator Cicero was serving as quaestor in Sicily. He had heard stories about the tomb of Archimedes, {{but none of the}} locals were able to give him the location. Eventually he found the tomb near the Agrigentine gate in Syracuse, in a neglected condition and overgrown with bushes. Cicero had the tomb <b>cleaned</b> <b>up,</b> <b>and</b> was able to see the carving and read some of the verses that had been added as an inscription. A tomb discovered in the courtyard of the Hotel Panorama in Syracuse in the early 1960s was claimed to be that of Archimedes, but there was no compelling evidence for this and the location of his tomb today is unknown.|$|E

Western-style residential complexes, modern nightclubs, classy restaurants and prestigious hotels opened in the centre. And most importantly, with the easing of the visa rules in 2005, Ukraine is positioning itself as a prime tourist attraction, with Kiev, among the other large cities, looking to profit from new opportunities. The centre of Kiev has been <b>cleaned</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> buildings have been restored and redecorated, especially Khreshchatyk and Maidan Nezalezhnosti. Many historic areas of Kiev, such as Andriyivskyy Descent, have become popular street vendor locations, where one can find traditional Ukrainian art, religious items, books, game sets (most commonly chess) as well as jewellery for sale.|$|E
25|$|The J75 was {{somewhat}} {{larger than the}} J57 in the F-102A, and had greater mass flow. This demanded changes to the inlets to allow more airflow, and {{this led to the}} further refinement of using a variable-geometry inlet duct to allow the intakes to be tuned to best performance across a wide range of supersonic speeds. This change also led to the ducts being somewhat shorter. The fuselage grew slightly longer, and was <b>cleaned</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> simplified in many ways. The wing was slightly enlarged in area, and a redesigned vertical tail surface was used. The engine's 2-position afterburner exhaust nozzle was also used for idle thrust control. The nozzle was held open reducing idle thrust by 40% giving slower taxiing and less brake wear.|$|E

25|$|The {{accident}} was the 333 Squadron's third fatal accident with the Catalinas. It {{was the first}} aviation accident in Svalbard and remained the deadliest aviation accident of a civilian nature in the territory until Vnukovo Airlines Flight 2801 in 1996, which killed 141 people. The air force continued on the postal service until 1959. By then a winter airport had been built in Adventdalen outside Longyearbyen and Braathens SAFE took over the postal flights. A memorial plaque with {{a part of the}} aircraft's propeller was erected at the station at Bjørnøya on 1 November 1984. The 333 Squadron commemorated the accident on its 50th anniversary in 2004 by flying two Lockheed P-3 Orion aircraft over Bjørnøya and dropping flowers over the site. The wreckage has never been <b>cleaned</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> is still located at the crash site.|$|E
25|$|Vomiting, in particular, transmits {{infection}} effectively, {{and appears}} to allow airborne transmission. In one incident, a person who vomited spread infection right across a restaurant, suggesting that many unexplained cases of food poisoning may have their source in vomit. In December 1998, 126 people were dining at six tables; one woman vomited onto the floor. Staff quickly <b>cleaned</b> <b>up,</b> <b>and</b> people continued eating. Three days later others started falling ill; 52 people reported a range of symptoms, from fever and nausea to vomiting and diarrhea. The cause was not immediately identified. Researchers plotted the seating arrangement: more than 90% {{of the people at}} the same table as the sick woman later reported becoming ill. There was a direct correlation between the risk of infection of people at other tables and how close they were to the sick woman. More than 70% of the diners at an adjacent table fell ill; at a table {{on the other side of}} the restaurant, the attack rate was still 25%. The outbreak was attributed to a Norwalk-like virus (norovirus). Other cases of transmission by vomit were later identified.|$|E
25|$|The film flashes back to 21 {{years earlier}} during {{military}} era as Tamuno narrates their ordeal {{to the public}} via Kristy's camera. Ebiere (Mbong Amata) is born in Warri during the Military era; she concludes high school and is offered scholarship by Western Oil to study oversea. A few years later, an oil pipe in the Niger Delta bursts {{and the people of}} the community go to fetch petrol from the pipe, Dede (Hakeem Kae-Kazim), a fisherman discovers that fishes in the river have been killed by the oil spillage. The police arrive at the spillage site and demand that the Villagers vacate the area, but no one listens to them. Ebiere arrives in the village — her home, and is told her mother and siblings are getting fuel from a spillage site. On her way to the site, the site explodes killing her mother and siblings. The explosion appears to have been an accident, caused after one of the police officers sent to disperse the oil collectors lights a cigarette after having failed to do so. He is killed as well. Ebiere speaks up at a consolation visit of Western Oil staff (An oil rig American company based in Warri) and is applauded by members of the Community. This establishes her as one of the speakers for the Niger Delta Community, she is approached by Kate Summers (Sarah Wayne Callies), a reporter who likes her speech and says Ebiere is {{different from the rest of}} the community people, Kate becomes one of Ebiere's friends and supporters. Ebiere starts to organize peaceful protests and mass rallies for their voice to be heard, fighting for the Niger Delta to be <b>cleaned</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> well maintained — they are sometimes beaten, killed and/or arrested by the Military in the process. Ebiere is offered bribes severally by Western Oil representatives to stop her from instigating the people, but she always declines.|$|E

500|$|In Harlem, Bandy had {{witnessed}} a black woman's arrest for disorderly conduct {{in a hotel}} and sought to have her released. According to the police, Bandy hit the officer, who shot the soldier as {{he was trying to}} flee from the scene. A crowd of about 3,000 people gathered at police headquarters, after a smaller crowd had followed Bandy and the officer to a hospital for treatment. When someone in the crowd at police headquarters incorrectly stated that Bandy had been killed, a riot ensued in the community that lasted for two days and resulted in six deaths and hundreds injured, with nearly 600 arrests. The riot had a pattern mostly of vandalism, theft, and property destruction of white-owned businesses in Harlem, resulting in monetary damages, rather than attacks on persons. New York City Mayor Fiorello H. La Guardia ultimately restored order in the borough on August 2 with the recruitment of several thousand officers and volunteer forces to contain the rioters. City units <b>cleaned</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> repaired buildings. The mayor also supplied food and goods afterward to compensate for the closed businesses.|$|E

40|$|Abstract <b>Clean</b> <b>up</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} steps to remove co-extractives and undesired interfering substances from the sample before analysis in pesticide residue analysis. Some advanced, sophisticated and efficient methods of <b>clean</b> <b>up</b> have emerged out which is able to save time as well as amount of solvents. These are Solid Phase Extraction (SPE), Gel Permeation Chromatography (GPC) and Supercritical Fluid Chromatography (SFC). They are very much efficient for <b>clean</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> extraction of pesticide samples. SPE method is successfully used for <b>clean</b> <b>up</b> of pesticide residue from soil and water samples. GPC is now widely used in sample preparation in many residue laboratories and is effectively used for multi-residue analysis. SFC is by far the best method of <b>clean</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> extraction, though it involves high cost. Thus, various suitable <b>clean</b> <b>up</b> methods can free pesticide residues from extraneous co-extractive materials in an efficient manner and helps to prepare a good sample for further analysis...|$|R
