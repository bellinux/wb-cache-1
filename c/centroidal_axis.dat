40|$|The geometrically {{nonlinear}} {{formulation of}} three-dimensional (3 D) curved beam elements with large rotations has recently aroused much interest. The element geometry is usually constructed using coordinates of the nodes of the <b>centroidal</b> or reference <b>axis</b> and the orthogonal nodal vectors representing the principal bending directions. The element displacement field is described using three translations at the element nodes and three rotations about the local axes. These types of 3 D beam element formulations are, however, restricted to small nodal rotations between two successive load increments. The beam element formulation {{presented in this}} paper removes such restrictions; this is accomplished by defining beam geometry using nodal displacements and tangent vectors instead of rotation angles at the two ends of the curved beam element. The fact that, unlike rotation angles, vectors can be added without difficulty, allows large rotations be made within a load increment. Removing all the transcendental trigonometrical cosine and sine functions, the formulation has the advantage of being simple and purely algebraic. © 1992. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|The present {{dissertation}} elucidates {{the problem}} of determining if a given I-shaped cross-section is properly proportioned to accommodate sufficient plastic hinge rotation capacity to facilitate the redistribution of moments in a structural system as needed to accommodate {{the formation of a}} collapse mechanism. It might be tempting to believe that application of the limiting flange plate slenderness value for the case of major axis flexure are applicable in this case; since the pervasive belief is that this approach ought to be conservative. However, the present research study indicates {{that this is not the}} case and thus more sophisticated analysis techniques are required to better understand this case. Most current design specifications employed throughout the world prescribe the use of so-called interaction equations for the design of beam-columns. Most often these interaction equations are optimized for use with the members possessing I-shaped cross-sections that are bent about the major principal <b>centroidal</b> <b>axis</b> while simultaneously being subjected to compressive thrust.

Alterations to the existing AISC interaction equations are suggested for improving on strength predictions relative to this case.

40|$|Most dynamic {{analyses}} of planar curved beams {{found in the}} literature are carried out based on a curved beam model which assumes that the neutral axis coincides with the <b>centroidal</b> <b>axis</b> of the curved beam. This assumption leads to governing equations of motion which are relatively simple with analysis results that have acceptable accuracy for shallow curved beams. However, when a curved beam is not shallow and/or its cross section is not doubly symmetric, the offset distance between the neutral and centroidal axes may be large enough to influence the in-plane dynamics of the curved beam even for small motion. In this paper, the validity of this underlying assumption for modeling a linear curved beam is examined. To this end, two sets of equations of motion governing the in-plane dynamics of a planar curved beam are derived, in a consistent manner for comparison, based on the linear strain–displacement relations and Hamilton’s principle. The first set of equations is derived from the displacement components measured with reference to the neutral axis of the curved beam while the second set is derived with respect to the <b>centroidal</b> <b>axis</b> of the cross section. The curved beam is considered extensional and the effects of rotary inertia and radial shear deformation are included. In addition to the curvature parameter that characterizes the wave motion for both curved beam models, an eccentricity parameter is introduced in the first model to account for the offset between the neutral and centroidal axes. The dynamic behavior predicted by each curved beam model is compared in terms of the dispersion relations, frequency spectra, cutoff frequencies, natural frequencies and modeshapes, and frequency responses. In order to ensure that the comparison is accurate, the wave propagation technique is applied to obtain exact wave solutions. It is shown that, when the curvature parameter is not small, the underlying assumption has a substantial impact on the accuracy of the linear dynamic analysis of a curved beam...|$|E

We use a mixed 3 -dimensional variational {{principle}} to derive 2 -dimensional equations for an anisotropic plate-like piezoelectric body and one-dimensional equations for an anisotropic beam-like piezoelectric body. The formulation accounts for double forces without moments which {{may change the}} thickness of the plate and deform the cross-section of the rod. The dependence of the bending rigidities of a transversely isotropic plate upon the angle between the normal to the midsurface and the direction of transverse isotropy is exhibited. The plate equations are used to study the cylindrical deformations of a transversely isotropic plate due to equal and opposite charges applied to its top and bottom surfaces. It is also found that a piezoelectric circular rod with axis of transverse isotropy not coincident with its <b>centroidal</b> <b>axis</b> and subjected to electric charges at the end faces is deformed into a non-prismatic body.

40|$|A {{nonlinear}} stability analysis {{based on}} an analytical approach of elastic type is performed {{for the first time}} on a simple two-bar frame. In order to obtain an exact determination of its buckling and postbuckling behavior the effect of compressibility of the bar <b>centroidal</b> <b>axis</b> is taken into account. This effect implies very slight increase in the buckling load which can be safely ignored. Moreover, it is found that even in the most extreme cases of geometry and stiffness, the critical buckling displacements are of negligibly small magnitude contrary to existing results obtained by the nonlinear kinematic stability analysis. The two foregoing findings enable us to replace the limit point by a bifurcation point. Such a simplification, being correct in an asymptotic sense, allows the application of a stability analysis of frames by considering their bars as incompressible. A variety of numerical results shows the degree of accuracy and the range of applicability of the aforementioned nonlinear kinematic stability analysis by comparing it with the exact method of stability analysis proposed herein. © 1986 Springer-Verlag...|$|E

One end of the beam is pinned, while the other end {{is attached to a}} roller support. Two approaches have been used in this study. The first approach is based on the elastica theory. The governing equations are derived and solved analytically for the exact closed form solutions that include the equilibrium configurations of the beam, equilibrium paths, and bending moment distribution of the beam. The exact solutions take the form of elliptic integrals of the first and second kinds. In the second approach, the shooting method is employed to solve a set of nonlinear differential equations with the boundary and intermediate conditions. The equations are integrated by using the Runge-Kutta algorithm. The error norms of the end and intermediate conditions are minimized to within a prescribed tolerance error. A comparison study between the analytical elliptic integral solutions and the numerical shooting method solutions show excellent agreement of results.
