5|$|Apicomplexa is a {{major group}} of {{unicellular}} eukaryotes that encompasses several important parasites, including the malaria parasite Plasmodium. Three species are known from the marsh rice rat, all of which belong to the Eimerina clade. Two are in the genus Eimeria, members of which cause the economically significant disease <b>coccidiosis</b> in poultry. The third {{is a member of}} Isospora, which includes species that are pathogenic in humans and pigs.|$|E
25|$|<b>Coccidiosis</b> can {{be caused}} by a variety of coccidian organisms in dogs, most {{commonly}} Isospora. There are usually no symptoms, but diarrhea and weight loss may occur.|$|E

50|$|Research {{conducted}} by Growell India reveals that <b>coccidiosis</b> burdens the livestock industry with $3 {{billion in annual}} expenses due to impaired growth rates, disease, infertility, and morbidity. Subclinical <b>coccidiosis</b> is often undetected by farmers, though it causes havoc on animal health and productivity. <b>Coccidiosis</b> is caused by Eimeria. Its life cylce completes in a week. Active “oocysts” are {{picked up by the}} bird (or other livestock) and swallowed. An “oocyst” is a capsule with a thick wall protecting the parasites. They “sporulate” and then become infective. The disease-causing oocyst is a hard and persistent structure resistant to chemical damage and degradation. They remain after treatment with diluted sodium hypochlorite or sulfuric acid. An unsporulated oocyst can survive up to seven months in fecal tissue, and a sporulated oocyst 2 years in an exogenous environment.|$|E
50|$|Eimeria brunetti is {{a species}} of Eimeria that causes hemorrhagic {{intestinal}} <b>coccidiosis</b> in young poultry. Lesions are limited to lower small intestine.|$|E
50|$|Eimeria fraterculae is {{a species}} of alveolates {{belonging}} to the family Eimeriidae. It causes renal <b>coccidiosis</b> in the Atlantic puffin (Fratercula arctica).|$|E
50|$|Protozoan {{infections in}} animals {{may be caused}} by organisms in the sub-class Coccidia (disease: <b>Coccidiosis)</b> and species in the genus Besnoitia (disease: Besnoitiosis).|$|E

5000|$|Dinitolmide (or zoalene) is a fodder {{additive}} for poultry, used {{to prevent}} <b>coccidiosis</b> infections. It is sold under trade names such as Coccidine A, Coccidot, and Zoamix.|$|E
5000|$|Maduramicin (maduramycin) is an {{antiprotozoal}} agent used in {{veterinary medicine}} to prevent <b>coccidiosis.</b> [...] It {{is a natural}} chemical compound first isolated from the actinomycete Actinomadura rubra.|$|E
50|$|The {{presence}} of oocysts on fecal flotation or impression smear {{of the liver}} are diagnostic for <b>coccidiosis.</b> The prepatent period is 18 days; sporulation occurs after three days.|$|E
50|$|<b>Coccidiosis</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} diseases in calves and youngstock both under housing conditions and when grazing. Symptoms are generally caused by the species Eimeria zuernii and Eimeria bovis and include loss of appetite, fatigue, dehydration, and watery, sometimes bloody, diarrhoea. Outbreaks are known to occur in cattle herds. The parasite can infect up to all animals in the farm and in some countries the parasite is present in all farms. <b>Coccidiosis</b> affect the growth and sometimes survival of the calves and consequently affect the production and the profitability of cattle livestock production.|$|E
50|$|Puppies are {{frequently}} infected with coccidia from the feces of their mother, {{and are more}} likely to develop <b>coccidiosis</b> due to their undeveloped immune systems. Stress can trigger symptoms in susceptible animals.|$|E
5000|$|Cystoisospora, {{previously}} known Isospora, is a genus {{that causes}} <b>coccidiosis</b> in humans, dogs and cats. [...] <b>Coccidiosis</b> is multiple gastrointestinal infections caused {{by members of}} the sporozoan parasite coccidium which includes Cystoisospora. Species that can infect dogs are Cystoisospora canis, Cystoisospora ohioensis, Cystoisospora neorivolta, and Cystoisospora burrowsi. C. Canis oocysts are larger in size compared to the other three and the other three are structurally similar to each other but not with C. Canis, making it easy to identify. C. ohioensis, C. burrowsi, and C. neorivolta oocysts are similar in structure so they cannot be distinguished from each other until further diagnosis.|$|E
50|$|Apart {{from its}} host-specificity, this coccidium can be {{recognised}} by the subspherical oocytes with unusually thick walls appearing distinctly greenish in colour. <b>Coccidiosis</b> caused by this parasite {{appears to be}} mild and nonfatal.|$|E
50|$|<b>Coccidiosis</b> can be {{diagnosed}} by finding oocysts in fecal smears. In {{early stages of}} the disease, there may be very few oocysts being shed, and a negative test does not rule out the disease.|$|E
50|$|Cystoisospora canis, {{previously}} {{known as}} Isospora canis, is a microscopic, coccidian parasite that causes an intestinal tract infection in dogs. The intestinal tract infection is <b>coccidiosis</b> {{caused by a}} protozoa (one-celled organisms) called coccidia.|$|E

5000|$|Sulfaquinoxaline (IUPAC name: 4-Amino-N-2-quinoxalinylbenzenesulfonamide) is a {{veterinary}} medicine {{which can be}} given to cattle and sheep to treat coccidiosis.It is available in Pakistan with Sanna Laboratories in combination with Amprolium and Vitamin K as potential treatment of <b>coccidiosis</b> ...|$|E
50|$|The {{following}} {{drugs can}} be used for treatment of <b>coccidiosis</b> in cattle: amprolium, sulfaquinoxaline, and sulfamethazine. However, it is often more effective to prevent this disease in cattle, which can be aided by the products lasalocid, decoquinate, and monensin.|$|E
50|$|Monensin is used {{extensively}} in the beef and dairy industries to prevent <b>coccidiosis,</b> increase the production of propionic acid and prevent bloat. Furthermore, monensin, but also its derivatives monensin methyl ester (MME), and particularly monensin decyl ester (MDE) are widely used in ion-selective electrodes.|$|E
50|$|Eimeria maxima is {{a species}} of Eimeria that causes <b>coccidiosis</b> in poultry. It {{is located in the}} middle part of the intestine, on either side of Meckel's diverticulum, and {{frequently}} ascends into the duodenum.

50|$|Eimeria necatrix is {{a species}} of Eimeria that causes very severe {{intestinal}} <b>coccidiosis</b> in older poultry characterized by congestion, hemorrhage, necrosis of the intestine and bloody feces.

50|$|Eimeria tenella is monogenetic. Various {{stages of}} its {{complicated}} life cycle may conveniently be described under two phases, asexual cycle or schizogony and sexual cycle involving gametogony.

50|$|Australian Finns (and {{particularly}} Finn crosses) are extraordinarily {{lean and}} have contributed greatly to {{an improvement in}} the leanness of first- and second-cross lambs.

50|$|European {{brown hare}} {{syndrome}} (EBHS) {{is a disease}} caused by a calicivirus similar to that causing rabbit haemorrhagic disease (RHS) and can similarly be fatal, but cross infection between the two mammal species does not occur. Other threats to the hare are pasteurellosis, yersiniosis (pseudo-tuberculosis), <b>coccidiosis</b> and tularaemia, which are the principal sources of mortality.|$|E
50|$|Genus Isospora is {{the most}} common cause of {{intestinal}} <b>coccidiosis</b> in dogs and cats. Species of Isospora are host-specific, infecting only one species. Species that infect dogs include I. canis, I. ohioensis, I. burrowsi, and I. neorivolta. Species that infect cats include I. felis and I. rivolta. The most common symptom is diarrhea. Sulfonamides are the most common treatment.|$|E
50|$|Robenidine is a coccidiostat. Robenidine is an {{antibiotic}} {{used for the}} control of <b>coccidiosis,</b> a debilitating protozoal infection in poultry.
