50|$|Isolation {{amplifiers}} are a form {{of differential}} amplifier that allow measurement of small signals {{in the presence of}} a high <b>common</b> <b>mode</b> <b>voltage</b> by providing electrical isolation and an electrical safety barrier. They protect data acquisition components from common mode voltages, which are potential differences between instrument ground and signal ground.

50|$|Amplifiers {{providing}} input-to-output isolation without channel-to-channel isolation. This is a {{less expensive}} form of isolation that offers only one isolation barrier for a multi-channel instrument. Although the commons of each channel are isolated from power ground by the input-to-output isolation barrier, they are not isolated from each other. Therefore a <b>common</b> <b>mode</b> <b>voltage</b> on one will attempt to float all the others, sometimes with disastrous results. This form of isolation is suitable only when {{it is certain that}} there is only one <b>common</b> <b>mode</b> <b>voltage</b> that is equally applied to all channels.|$|E

50|$|The {{frequency}} of the <b>common</b> <b>mode</b> <b>voltage</b> can adversely affect performance. Higher frequency common mode voltages create difficulty for many isolation amplifiers due to the parasitic capacitance of the isolation barrier. This capacitance appears as a low impedance to higher frequency signals, and allows the <b>common</b> <b>mode</b> <b>voltage</b> to essentially blow past the barrier and interfere with measurements, or even damage the amplifier. However, most common mode voltages are a composite of line voltages, so frequencies generally remain in the 50 to 60 Hz region with some harmonic content, well within the rejection range of most isolation amplifiers.|$|E
