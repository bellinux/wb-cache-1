50|$|The {{amount of}} plastic {{deformation}} possible is zero, which is obviously {{less than the}} amount of plastic deformation possible for a non-work-hardened material. Thus, the ductility of the <b>cold-worked</b> <b>bar</b> is reduced.|$|E
40|$|The main {{objective}} of this work is to study {{the influence of the}} forming process on two corrugated, lean, duplex stainless steels (DSSs) : UNS S 32001 and UNS S 32304. Both grades have been recently proposed as alternative materials to the austenitic UNS S 30403 grade for manufacturing reinforcement bars to be embedded in concrete structures, exposed to corrosive environments. Hot-worked (HW) corrugated bars of both DSSs are analyzed and their corrosion behaviour is compared with that of the HW and <b>cold-worked</b> (CW) corrugated <b>bars</b> of S 30403. The corrosion performance is characterized through cyclic polarization curves in 8 different solutions that simulate those contained inside the pores of concrete in different circumstances. The obtained results justify a great interest in the studied lean DSS grades with respect to their use as reinforcements. Moreover, it is proved that the corrugated surface of a bar is clearly less corrosion resistant than the centre of the bar. The processing method of producing reinforcements influences not only the pitting susceptibility but also the pitting morphology. Publicad...|$|R
