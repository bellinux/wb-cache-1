The <b>critical</b> <b>loads</b> (CLs) were updated for forested lands of European Russia on a 5 x 5 km 2 grid. Data processing included combining soil and land use data with GIS layers such as temperature, precipitation amounts, base cations depositions and others. The following maps were produced: • maximum <b>critical</b> <b>loads</b> of sulphur, • maximum <b>critical</b> <b>loads</b> of nitrogen, • minimum <b>critical</b> <b>loads</b> of nitrogen, • <b>critical</b> <b>loads</b> of nutrient nitrogen.

40|$|<b>Critical</b> <b>loads</b> of acidity and {{nutrient}} nitrogen — simple {{measures of the}} sensitivity of ecosystems to deposition — {{have been widely used}} for setting emission reduction targets in Europe. In contrast to sulfur, the emissions of nitrogen compounds remain high in the future. This is also true for the exceedances of <b>critical</b> <b>loads</b> until 2010. Looking further into the future, climate change is likely to influence ecosystem sensitivity, and thus <b>critical</b> <b>loads.</b> It is shown that higher temperatures, changed precipitation patterns, and modified net primary production mainly increase <b>critical</b> <b>loads,</b> except in mountainous and arid regions. Using consistent scenarios of climate change and air pollution from a recently completed European study (AIR-CLIM), it is shown that the exceedances in 2100 of the <b>critical</b> <b>loads</b> are declining in comparison to 2010. However, exceedances of <b>critical</b> <b>loads</b> of nutrient nitrogen remain substantial, even under the most stringent scenario. This confirms the increasing role nitrogen plays in environmental problems in comparison to sulfur. Thus research should focus on the effects of nitrogen in the environment, especially under conditions of climate change, to support nitrogen-emission mitigating policies.

2500|$|The {{theory of}} the {{behavior}} of columns was investigated in 1757 by mathematician Leonhard Euler. He derived the formula, the Euler formula, that gives the maximum axial load that a long, slender, ideal column can carry without buckling. An ideal column is one that is perfectly straight, made of a homogeneous material, and free from initial stress. When the applied load reaches the Euler load, sometimes called the <b>critical</b> <b>load,</b> the column comes to be in a state of unstable equilibrium. At that load, the introduction of the slightest lateral force will cause the column to fail by suddenly [...] "jumping" [...] to a new configuration, and the column is said to have buckled. This is what happens when a person stands on an empty aluminum can and then taps the sides briefly, causing it to then become instantly crushed (the vertical sides of the can understood as an infinite series of extremely thin columns). The formula derived by Euler for long slender columns is given below.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} simple {{numerical}} model {{for use in}} a finite analysis (FEA) of scaffold-shoring systems. The structural model consists of a single set of multiple-story scaffolds with constraints in the out-of-plane direction at every connection joint between stories. Although this model has only two dimensions (termed the 2 -D model), it is derived from the analysis of a complete scaffold-shoring system and represents the structural behavior of a complete three-dimensional system. Experimental testing of scaffolds up to three stories in height conducted in the laboratory, along with an outdoor test of a five-story scaffold system, were used to validate the 2 -D model. Both failure modes and <b>critical</b> <b>loads</b> were compared. In the comparison of failure modes, the computational results agree very well with the test results. However, in the comparison of <b>critical</b> <b>loads,</b> computational results were consistently somewhat greater than test results. The decreasing trends of <b>critical</b> <b>loads</b> with number of stories in both the test and simulation results were similar. After investigations to explain the differences between the computationally and experimentally determined <b>critical</b> <b>loads,</b> it was recommended that the 2 -D model be used as the numerical model in subsequent analysis. In addition, the computational <b>critical</b> <b>loads</b> were calibrated and revised in accordance with the experimental <b>critical</b> <b>loads,</b> and the revised <b>critical</b> <b>loads</b> were then used as load-carrying capacities for scaffold-shoring systems for any number of stories.

40|$|<b>Critical</b> <b>loads</b> and {{load-carrying}} capacities for steel scaffolds used as shoring {{systems were}} compared using computational and experimental methods in Part I of this paper. In that paper, a simple 2 -D model was established {{for use in}} evaluating the structural behavior of scaffold-shoring systems. This 2 -D model was derived using an incremental finite element analysis (FEA) of a typical complete scaffold-shoring system. Although the simplified model is only two-dimensional, it predicts the <b>critical</b> <b>loads</b> and failure modes of the complete system. The objective {{of this paper is}} to present a closed-form solution to the 2 -D model. To simplify the analysis, a simpler model was first established to replace the 2 -D model. Then, a closed-form solution for the <b>critical</b> <b>loads</b> and failure modes based on this simplified model were derived using a bifurcation (eigenvalue) approach to the elastic-buckling problem. In this closed-form equation, the <b>critical</b> <b>loads</b> are shown to be function of the number of stories, material properties, and section properties of the scaffolds. The <b>critical</b> <b>loads</b> and failure modes obtained from the analytical (closed-form) solution were compared with the results from the 2 -D model.
