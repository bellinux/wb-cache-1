5|$|The Jif plastic {{containers}} were originally made from polythene, and {{were one of}} the original and first blow moulded containers used for food applications. The {{plastic containers}} served to replace glass bottles used to package lemon juice. The plastic container was the brainchild of Edward Hack, and the container's design was undertaken by Bill Pugh, the chief plastics designer at Cascelloid. In its development, Pugh carved a core made of wood, <b>covered</b> <b>it</b> <b>with</b> fresh lemon peel to give it a realistic texture, and then cast a plaster mould. This led to the realistic-looking container that significantly resembles a lemon.|$|E
5|$|The type {{specimen}} belonged to an aged individual. Its taphonomy is unusual {{as it was}} found lying on its back – in contrast, most other nearly complete dinosaur skeletons of the Nemegt Formation usually are found lying on their sides. The specimen was found encased in cross-bedded sandstone deposited by a river. Most of the discovered vertebrae were still connected together, forming a continuous series that consisted of 8 dorsal, 6 sacral and 34 caudal vertebrae. An additional 3 vertebrae were found isolated from the series and may belong to the transitional area between back and neck. The remaining parts of the skeleton were shifted slightly out of their original anatomical position. Both the left limb and rib bones {{were found on the}} right side of the body, while conversely the right limb and rib bones were found on the left side. Bite marks have been identified on the skeleton, particularly in the pelvis and the thigh bone, showing that predators had fed on the carcass. The skull and neck are missing, indicating that the carnivores might have carried away these body parts. The completeness of the remains indicate that the individual had died near the discovery site. A flooding event might have transported the carcass a short distance and subsequently <b>covered</b> <b>it</b> <b>with</b> sediment, even before the soft tissue had decayed entirely.|$|E
5|$|One scene {{involved}} a burning head, {{which was created}} by taking a cast of the actor's face, head and body with a plaster, then placing soft rubber over the cast to simulate human flesh. It was also treated so it did not release black smoke like a rubber tire when it burned. For burn effects placed on the body after the fire, the crew made a sculpture of the wounds, then mounted them onto rubber appliances, which were glued to the actor. For Harriet's death scene, in which she is scalped and her brain is visible, makeup artist Cindy Jordan put a cap over actress V. Joy Lee's head and <b>covered</b> <b>it</b> <b>with</b> mortician's wax {{to make it look}} bumpy. Another special effect {{involved a}} spirit that appears in the form of ectoplasm during a séance. It was created from cellulose, water and green food coloring. It proved difficult to make, and several attempts were made before the right consistency was achieved. To create the appearance of it coming out of actress V. Joy Lee's mouth, an eight-foot long hose was attached to the side of her face. Project manager Mark Seibert had to suck the fake ectoplasm through the hose to get it in, then during filming he spit it out. It took several shots before the take was successful, and it looked so funny during filming that the crew kept laughing during takes.|$|E

Just how he murdered his mother is disputed, but officials believed he rendered her unconscious before stabbing her in the heart.|$|E
25|$|Consequently, port {{authorities}} built a steel dock in 1972, which waves from a storm destroyed soon after. Builders {{came up with}} an alternative that same season. They constructed a block of ice, <b>covered</b> <b>it</b> <b>with</b> matting and straw and used it as a fender for a tanker that docked at the harbor in fall 1973. The ice fender became the forerunner to the contemporary ice pier.|$|E
25|$|Lance Corporal José L. Rivera, born in Ciales, Puerto Rico, was {{a member}} of the United States Marine Corps. He belonged to Company L, Third Battalion, 5th Marines, 1st Marine Division (Reinforced), Fleet Marine Force.

25|$|On the Kerry coast, {{he built}} a currach-like boat of wattle, <b>covered</b> <b>it</b> <b>with</b> hides tanned in oak bark {{softened}} with butter, set up a mast and a sail. He and {{a small group of}} monks fasted for forty days, and after a prayer upon the shore, embarked {{in the name of the}} Trinity. The account is characterized by a great deal of literary license and contains references to hell where “great demons threw down lumps of fiery slag from an island with rivers of gold fire” and “great crystal pillars.” Many now believe these to be references to the volcanic activity around Iceland, and to icebergs.|$|E

Under his right eye he had a tattoo of a Butterfly (symbolizing rebirth) but <b>covered</b> <b>it</b> <b>with</b> the L.A. Dodgers logo and a red star around it. Under his right ear, he has the Converse All-Star logo and under it he has CBP which stands for Cedar Block Piru. On his upper chest he has Hate It or Love It. On the right side of his chest, he has a tattoo that says N.W.A. On {{the left side}} of his chest, he has a bandana.|$|E
25|$|While {{still at}} the Slade, Whiteread cast {{domestic}} objects and created her first sculpture, Closet. She made a plaster cast of {{the interior of a}} wooden wardrobe and <b>covered</b> <b>it</b> <b>with</b> black felt. It was based on comforting childhood memories of hiding in a dark closet. After she graduated she rented space for a studio using the Enterprise Allowance Scheme. She created Shallow Breath (1988), the cast of the underside of a bed, made not long after her father died. Both sculptures were exhibited in her first solo show in 1988 along with casts of other domestic pieces. The work all sold and allowed her to apply for grants to find funding for larger sculptures.|$|E

25|$|Landing against fierce opposition, PFC Caddy {{went through}} the {{fighting}} on Iwo Jima for 12 days. On March 3, 1945, he, along with his platoon leader and his acting platoon sergeant, were advancing against shattering Japanese machine-gun and small arms fire in an isolated sector. Seeking temporary refuge from the assault, the three Marines dropped into a shell hole where they were immediately pinned down by a well-concealed enemy sniper. After several unsuccessful attempts to advance further, the 19-year-old Marine and his lieutenant, Ott C. Farris, engaged in a furious hand grenade battle with the defending Japanese. When an enemy grenade landed in their hole, PFC Caddy immediately <b>covered</b> <b>it</b> <b>with</b> his body and absorbed the deadly fragments.|$|E
25|$|At about 12:15 am, a flare {{lit up the}} sky and {{the first}} armored {{personnel}} vehicle appeared on the Square from the west. At 12:30 am, two more APCs arrived from the South. The students threw chunks of cement at the vehicles. One APC stalled, perhaps by metal poles jammed into its wheels, and the demonstrators <b>covered</b> <b>it</b> <b>with</b> gasoline-doused blankets and set it on fire. The intense heat forced out the three occupants, who were swarmed by demonstrators. The APCs had reportedly run over tents and many in the crowd wanted to beat the soldiers. But students formed a protective cordon and escorted the three men to the medic station by the History Museum {{on the east side of}} the Square.|$|E
25|$|The University was {{the site}} of social {{upheaval}} during the 1960s and 1970s, when nationalist students protested for civil rights, the independence of Puerto Rico, and taking the ROTC out of the campus. In 1970 Antonia Martínez was murdered by the police when they repressed students. As the shouting started in the street, everyone in the building she was in, on Ponce de León Avenue, went to the balconies to see what was happening. She was, like many others, watching the events, saw policemen attacking at the students, and allegedly shouted at the police ¡Asesinos! (Assassins!). A policeman turned and shot her in the head, killing her and injuring a roommate. A mural of her and her story existed on the College of Humanities, until administrative personnel <b>covered</b> <b>it</b> <b>with</b> paint. Other stories claim that she was shot by mistake.|$|E

25|$|Scientists Emily Craig and Randall Bresee have {{attempted}} to recreate the likenesses of the shroud through the dust-transfer technique, {{which could have been}} done by medieval arts. They first did a carbon-dust drawing of a Jesus-like face (using collagen dust) on a newsprint made from wood pulp (which is similar to 13th- and 14th-century paper). They next placed the drawing on a table and <b>covered</b> <b>it</b> <b>with</b> a piece of linen. They then pressed the linen against the newsprint by firmly rubbing with the flat side of a wooden spoon. By doing this they managed to create a reddish-brown image with a lifelike positive likeness of a person, a three-dimensional image and no sign of brush strokes. However, according to Fanti and Moroni, this does not reproduce many special features of the Shroud at microscopic level.|$|E

2500|$|The {{supersonic}} Bomarc {{missiles were}} the first long-range anti-aircraft missiles in the world, and were equipped with a W40 nuclear warhead. [...] The site at McGuire went operational in 1959 under the NYADS. [...] Within a year of becoming operational, a Bomarc-A with a nuclear warhead caught fire on 7 June 1960 following the explosive rupture of its onboard helium tank. While the missile's explosives didn't detonate the heat melted the warhead, releasing plutonium which the fire crews then spread around. The Air Force and the Atomic Energy Commission cleaned up the site and <b>covered</b> <b>it</b> <b>with</b> concrete; fortunately, {{this was the only}} major incident involving the weapons system.|$|E

During the act, [...] "menacing, feline dancers forced Jackson into a cage and <b>covered</b> <b>it</b> <b>with</b> a silver cloth. When they pulled it off, a real, live panther was prowling inside." [...] The performance was also considered as [...] "a rocker booming with guitar solos and fireworks," [...] commended for [...] "utilizing illusions" [...] to entertain the crowd. Dave Tianen of The Sentinel added, [...] "Shifting emotions as quickly as she shifted her head, shoulders, and hips, Jackson and crew launched into a thrashing version of [...] "Black Cat," [...] completed by whining guitar rifts comparable to much heavy metal." [...] On the tour's opening night, Jackson stated, [...] "The black cat, he peed - on stage!," [...] causing her and several dancers to slip and fall while performing. The panther, named Rhythm, was subsequently removed from the tour after the first leg due to safety concerns, as well as her own love of animals.|$|E
