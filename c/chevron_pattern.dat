5|$|In 2010 a rock {{coloured}} red, {{orange and}} yellow was unearthed. Although containers of pigments {{have been found}} previously at sites such as Skara Brae, {{this was the first}} discovery in Britain, and possibly in Northern Europe, of evidence that Neolithic peoples used paint to decorate their buildings. It is thought that the primitive paint could have been made from iron ore, mixed with animal fat, milk or eggs. Only a week later a stone with a zigzag <b>chevron</b> <b>pattern</b> painted with a red pigment was discovered nearby.|$|E
5|$|After the {{eleventh}} century, as masonry techniques advanced, ashlar blocks became more rectangular, resulting in structurally more stable walls that could incorporate more refined architectural moulding and detailing {{that can be}} seen in corbelling, buttressing, lintels and arching. At the same time there were increasing influences from English and continental European designs. These {{can be seen in the}} Romanesque <b>chevron</b> <b>pattern</b> on the piers in the nave of Dunfermline Abbey (1130–40), which were modelled on details from Durham Cathedral. St Magnus Cathedral in Orkney, begun in 1137, may have employed masons that had worked at Durham. The arrival of the new monastic orders in Scotland from the twelfth century led to a boom in ecclesiastical building using English and continental forms, including abbeys at Kelso, Holyrood, Jedburgh and St Andrews.|$|E
5|$|St. Regulus Chapel at St. Andrews {{dates from}} around 1150 and was {{probably}} {{built as a}} reliquary church. Only the aisless choir and tall square tower survive. Its detailing derives from work on a church at Wharram-le-Street in England {{and it may have}} been carried out by the same Yorkshire masons. The first monastic establishment built in the Romanesque style was Dunfermline Abbey, begun at the behest of Queen Margaret about 1074. An existing small chapel was expanded with a square choir and rounded apse. About fifty years later it was replaced by a grander cruciform church of which only the nave now survives. The <b>chevron</b> <b>pattern</b> in the detailing on the piers was modelled on that at Durham Cathedral. Similarly, St Magnus Cathedral in Orkney, begun in 1137, may have employed masons who had worked at Durham, with which it shares a similar pattern of great round arches based on thick cylindrical pillars. The arrival of the new monastic orders in Scotland from the twelfth century led to a boom in ecclesiastical building using English and continental forms, including abbeys at Kelso, Holyrood, St Andrews and Jedburgh, one of the most complete Romanesque buildings to survive.|$|E
50|$|<b>Chevron</b> <b>{{patterns}}</b> crop up occasionally, {{usually in}} the upper regions of the stone. These patterns can be likened to military shields, suggesting the stones' connection to armed conflict. It has also been suggested that <b>chevron</b> <b>patterns</b> could be a shamanic emblem representing the skeleton.|$|R

5|$|The {{introduction}} of Christianity into Scotland from Ireland, from the sixth century, {{led to the}} construction of basic masonry-built churches beginning on the west coast and islands. Medieval parish church architecture in Scotland was typically much less elaborate than in England, with many churches remaining simple oblongs, without transepts and aisles, and often without towers. In the Highlands they were often even simpler, many built of rubble masonry and sometimes indistinguishable from the outside from houses or farm buildings. However, from the eighth century, more sophisticated buildings emerged. Early Romanesque ashlar masonry produced block-built stone buildings, like the eleventh century round tower at Brechin Cathedral and the square towers of Dunblane Cathedral and The Church of St Rule. After the eleventh century, as masonry techniques advanced, ashlar blocks became more rectangular, resulting in structurally more stable walls that could incorporate more refined architectural moulding and detailing that can be seen in corbelling, buttressing, lintels and arching. At the same time there was increasing influences from English and continental European designs, such as the Romanesque <b>chevron</b> <b>pattern</b> detailing on the piers in the nave of Dunfermline Abbey (1130–40), which were modelled on details from Durham Cathedral, and the thirteenth century East-end of Elgin Cathedral, which incorporated typical European Gothic mouldings and tracery. In the fifteenth century continental builders are known to have been working in Scotland. French master-mason John Morrow was employed at the building of Glasgow Cathedral and the rebuilding of Melrose Abbey, both considered fine examples of Gothic architecture. The interiors of churches were often elaborate before the Reformation, with highly decorated sacrament houses, like the ones surviving at Deskford and Kinkell. The carvings at Rosslyn Chapel, created in the mid-fifteenth century, elaborately depicting the progression of the seven deadly sins, are considered some of the finest in the Gothic style. Late Medieval Scottish churches also often contained elaborate burial monuments, like the Douglas tombs in the town of Douglas. The early sixteenth century saw crown steeples built on churches with royal connections, symbolising imperial monarchy, as at St. Giles Cathedral, Edinburgh.|$|E

25|$|The banded tunnelweb spider (Hexathele hochstetteri) {{is among}} New Zealand’s largest spiders, growing up to 20mm in body length, and is endemic to New Zealand. The {{easiest way to}} {{distinguish}} a banded tunnelweb spider {{is to look for}} the chevron design on its abdomen. The <b>chevron</b> <b>pattern</b> is described as being yellowish, whilst the rest of the abdomen is a darker brown colour. They also have an orange-brown carapace, and six spinnerets. It is these six spinnerets that ultimately distinguish Hexathele hochstetteri from other genera of Hexathelidae, such as Porrhothele, as they only have four spinnerets. Female banded tunnelweb spider eyes occupy around half their head space, whereas males differ, having slightly smaller lateral eyes.|$|E
500|$|In the 1990s, the north-facing orange-red brick facade {{presented}} a large, compound arched brick and stone portico, with deeply recessed doors. This arch was [...] "supported by three carved columns, two twisted columns, and a central column with a <b>chevron</b> <b>pattern,</b> {{each with a}} Byzantine-style capital", and had a stone coping on top. Carved into the portico arch in capital letters were the words [...] "First Roumanian-American Congregation".|$|E
500|$|Manjakamiadana {{was built}} in two stages. The {{original}} palace, built between 1839 and 1840 on the orders of RanavalonaI, was built entirely in wood by Jean Laborde. In 1867, {{during the reign of}} RanavalonaII, a stone casing was erected around the original wooden structure. [...] The [...] long, [...] wide original wooden structure was [...] high, including the steeply pitched roof of wooden shingles, itself [...] in height. These measurements exclude the two superimposed balconies that extended [...] from the exterior walls and encircled the entire building, supported by [...] diameter wooden posts. The exterior of the entire building, including the roof, was painted white, {{with the exception of the}} balcony railings which were red. The exterior walls were composed of wooden planks tightly fitted together in a repeated <b>chevron</b> <b>pattern</b> reminiscent of traditional thatch walls, while the wood planks of the interior walls were hung vertically. The building could be entered by three doors: the main entrance in the northern wall, another in the southern wall and a third reserved for servants in the eastern wall.|$|E
50|$|The nave is {{the oldest}} {{surviving}} part of the church; the south wall dates from the late 12th century.

2500|$|Thomson {{used the}} eagle—this time specifying an American bald eagle—as the sole {{supporter}} on the shield. [...] The shield had thirteen stripes, {{this time in}} a <b>chevron</b> <b>pattern,</b> and the eagle's claws held an olive branch and a bundle of thirteen arrows. [...] For the crest, he used Hopkinson's constellation of thirteen stars. The motto was E Pluribus Unum, taken from the first committee, and was on a scroll held in the eagle's beak.|$|E
2500|$|Although {{the roof}} {{structures}} are {{commonly referred to}} as [...] "shells" [...] (as in this article), they are precast concrete panels supported by precast concrete ribs, not shells in a strictly structural sense. Though the shells appear uniformly white from a distance, they actually feature a subtle <b>chevron</b> <b>pattern</b> composed of 1,056,006 tiles in two colours: glossy white and matte cream. [...] The tiles were manufactured by the Swedish company Höganäs AB which generally produced stoneware tiles for the paper-mill industry.|$|E
2500|$|The {{design and}} {{construction}} of fire engines focuses greatly {{on the use of}} both active and passive warnings. Passive visual warnings involve the use of high contrast patterns to increase the noticeability of the vehicle. These types of warnings are often seen on older vehicles and those in developing countries. More modern designs make use of retroreflectors to reflect light from other vehicles. Vehicles will also often have these reflectors arranged in a <b>chevron</b> <b>pattern</b> along with the words fire or rescue. European countries commonly use a pattern known as battenburg markings. Along with the passive warnings, are active visual warnings which are usually in the form of flashing colored lights (also known as [...] "beacons" [...] or [...] "lightbars"). These flash {{to attract the attention of}} other drivers as the fire truck approaches, or to provide warning to drivers approaching a parked fire truck in a dangerous position on the road. While the fire truck is headed towards the scene, the lights are always accompanied by loud audible warnings such as sirens and air horns.|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn {{this case}} study, a failed railway rail {{which was used}} for heavy cargo trains was {{investigated}} {{in order to find}} out its root cause. The macroscopic beach marks and microscopic fatigue striations were not observed by macro and microscopic observations. The <b>chevron</b> <b>patterns</b> were observed by macro observations. The crack origin was at the tip of <b>chevron</b> <b>patterns.</b> The fan-shaped patterns, cleavage step and the river patterns were observed at the crack origin, which demonstrated the feature of cleavage fracture. The metallurgical structures at the crack origin were pearlite and ferrite networks. The crack is supposed to be initiated from the weaker ferrite networks. Given all of that, the failed railway rail is considered to be caused by overload. It is of great importance to improve the welding technology, and control the load of train in order to prevent similar failure in future...|$|R
