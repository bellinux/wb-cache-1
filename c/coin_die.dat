25|$|In late April 1861, four Confederate half dollars {{were struck}} {{on a hand}} press by certain {{employees}} of the New Orleans Mint. Because of the high relief of the <b>coin</b> <b>die,</b> a test striking was made to see if coins would release from the Confederate die. The die was made by a printing plate engraver (A.H.M. Peterson) in New Orleans who was unfamiliar with techniques required to engrave coining dies. These coins were struck using a U.S. obverse die (Seated Liberty) and the Confederate die made by Peterson. These coins are known as originals, {{and the location of}} all four of the coins is known today.|$|E
25|$|Rome {{contains}} {{a vast and}} impressive collection of art, sculpture, fountains, mosaics, frescos, and paintings, from all different periods. Rome first became a major artistic centre during ancient Rome, with forms of important Roman art such as architecture, painting, sculpture and mosaic work. Metal-work, <b>coin</b> <b>die</b> and gem engraving, ivory carvings, figurine glass, pottery, and book illustrations {{are considered to be}} 'minor' forms of Roman artwork. Rome later became a major centre of Renaissance art, since the popes spent vast sums of money for the constructions of grandiose basilicas, palaces, piazzas and public buildings in general. Rome became one of Europe's major centres of Renaissance artwork, second only to Florence, and able to compare to other major cities and cultural centres, such as Paris and Venice. The city was affected greatly by the baroque, and Rome became the home of numerous artists and architects, such as Bernini, Caravaggio, Carracci, Borromini and Cortona. In the late 18th century and early 19th century, the city was one of the centres of the Grand Tour, when wealthy, young English and other European aristocrats visited the city to learn about ancient Roman culture, art, philosophy and architecture. Rome hosted a great number of neoclassical and rococo artists, such as Pannini and Bernardo Bellotto. Today, the city is a major artistic centre, with numerous art institutes and museums.|$|E
2500|$|In late 1973, {{the price}} of copper on world markets rose {{to a point where}} the {{metallic}} value of the cent was almost equal to its face value. The U.S. Mint, which produces billions of cents annually, was faced with a potentially catastrophic operating deficit, due to issues of seigniorage. As a result, the Mint tested alternate metals, including aluminum and bronze-clad steel. A composition of 96% aluminum (with trace elements for stability) was chosen. The composition was chosen due to its longevity on <b>coin</b> <b>die</b> use, and aluminum's high resistance to tarnishing. 1,571,167 examples of the new cents were struck. [...] Although they were produced in 1973, they were struck using 1974 dated dies in anticipation of release into circulation in that year.|$|E

40|$|AbstractBecause <b>coining</b> <b>dies</b> are consumables, most of mints {{have adopted}} the hard surface coating on <b>coining</b> <b>dies</b> in order to {{increase}} the wear resistance of them. Even though <b>coining</b> <b>dies</b> for “proof coins” are coated by Cr-plating, they have especially short life time. Instead of Cr-plating, we tried to apply Diamond-Like Carbon (DLC) film for proof coins. In order to examine the effect of the DLC films, proof coins were actually produced with the DLC coated dies. In consequence, the die life using DLC coating is estimated to be more than twice as long as that for Cr-plating...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{requirements}} on tools {{used in the}} production of coins include high quality and reliability, dependent on the materials from which they are made, on manufacturing technology, heat treatment and final operations achieving functional area modification. Properties of the material of coins vary during their production and there is the so-called operational degradation that can be caused by an inappropriate technology of manufacturing. The quality of <b>coining</b> <b>dies</b> is expressed as their service life which ranges from approximately one hundred thousand to one million pieces of coins produced. Therefore, it is necessary to pay enough attention to the service life of <b>coining</b> <b>dies.</b> Surface treatment {{in the form of the}} application of hard PVD coatings is one of the ways of increasing the durability of <b>coining</b> <b>die.</b> In the present study, we analysed and tested three types of coatings deposited onto <b>coining</b> <b>dies</b> made of tool steel...|$|R
2500|$|Note: From 1868 to 1982, {{a unique}} dating system for Spanish coins was employed. This would be adopted and {{sometimes}} abandoned intermittently during various times, and continued through {{to be used}} through {{the first years of}} the Juan Carlos I reign. Although a common [...] "authorization date" [...] will be found on virtually all coins of this period on the obverse (front) of each coin, the actual date for many coins can be found inside a small six pointed star, typically on the reverse (back) of each coin, but sometimes the front. Therefore, the obverse date does not always reflect the actual date of mintage but rather a restriking off of older obverse <b>coin</b> <b>die</b> designs. So, if the coin date shows 1959 up front but a tiny [...] "64" [...] is depicted in the six pointed star on the back, then the actual date of issue is in fact 1964 rather than the date depicted in front. This dating system would be abandoned in the early 1980s anticipating a one by one redesign of each coin denomination.|$|E
50|$|A <b>coin</b> <b>die</b> itself, {{has been}} the main motive for many {{collectors}} coins and medals. One {{of the most recent}} and famous one, is the Austrian 700 Years City of Hall in Tyrol coin, minted on January 29, 2003. The reverse side of the coin shows the Guldiner silver coin. However, the design is negative, representing a <b>coin</b> <b>die,</b> as a reference to Hall’s history as a significant centre for minting coins.|$|E
50|$|A <b>coin</b> <b>die</b> {{is one of}} the two {{metallic}} {{pieces that}} are used to strike a coin, one per each side of the coin. A die contains an inverse version of the image to be struck on the coin. Striking a coin refers to pressing an image into the blank metal disc, or planchet, and is a term descended from the days when the dies were struck with hammers to deform the metal into the image of the dies.|$|E
50|$|Coining: {{is similar}} to forming with the main {{difference}} being that a <b>coining</b> <b>die</b> may form completely different features on either face of the blank, these features being transferred {{from the face of}} the punch or <b>die</b> respectively. The <b>coining</b> <b>die</b> and punch flow the metal by squeezing the blank within a confined area, instead of bending the blank. For example: an Olympic medal that was formed from a <b>coining</b> <b>die</b> may have a flat surface on the back and a raised feature on the front. If the medal was formed (or embossed), the surface on the back would be the reverse image of the front.|$|R

5000|$|In the 1870s, the United States Mint in Philadelphia {{commissioned}} him {{to carve}} <b>coin</b> <b>dies</b> for U.S. Trade Dollars [...] - [...] coins {{with a higher}} silver content than regular U.S. silver dollars for use in international trade, especially with China, Japan and Korea. The surviving <b>coin</b> <b>dies</b> are unsigned, but design and/or carving {{of at least three}} of them are attributed to Bailly.|$|R
50|$|In some cases, {{the date}} on an already {{manufactured}} <b>coin</b> <b>die</b> was altered. As this could not be done without leaving a trace of the former date, some coins show traces of an older date below the clearly visible date. These include 1897-B over 1896-B, 1900-B over 1894-B, 1901-B over 1900-B, 1909-B over 1908-B, 1904-B over 1898-B, 1903-B over 1902-B, 1908-B over 1903-B, 1904-B over 1903-B, 1929-B over 1901-B, 1908-B over 1907-B, and 1910-B over 1900-B.|$|E
50|$|A die defect is {{a unique}} and unintentional flaw in a <b>coin</b> <b>die</b> and is created through {{excessive}} use or polishing of the die. A die bearing such a defect is occasionally {{referred to as a}} defective die. Generally, and depending upon the magnitude of the defect, coins that are produced from these dies are considered error coins. Also, the term encompasses a wide variety of design errors that were engraved into the die originally and were slipped into circulation before the incorrect design was discovered.|$|E
50|$|The {{story begins}} with the country {{experiencing}} {{a significant increase in}} circulation of counterfeit coin currency, leading to growing unrest and instability. Official investigators from the Department Six, acting on a tip-off, rush in full force to apprehend a suspect who is trying to sell a <b>coin</b> <b>die</b> stolen from the imperial mint, only to find the suspect and the evidence being taken into custody by agents of a hitherto unknown secret service, known as the Divine Constabulary, which is commissioned by the Emperor himself.|$|E
2500|$|Variety collections: Because mints {{generally}} issue thousands or {{millions of}} any given coin, they use multiple sets of <b>coin</b> <b>dies</b> to produce the same <b>coin.</b> Occasionally these <b>dies</b> have slight differences. This was more common on older coins because the <b>coin</b> <b>dies</b> were hand carved. [...] But differences—intentional or accidental—still exist on coins today. Generally this {{is in a very}} small detail, such as the number of leaves on the ear of corn on the recent US Wisconsin state quarter [...]|$|R
50|$|The vast {{majority}} of medieval coins were cold struck; the planchets were not heated. While medieval <b>coin</b> <b>dies</b> were largely made of iron, some dies have been discovered with a small region at {{the face of the}} die which is made of steel. As technology and the economy changed {{over the course of the}} Middle Ages, so did the techniques used to create <b>coin</b> <b>dies.</b> While most ancient <b>coin</b> <b>dies</b> used engraving very heavily, early medieval coinage was dominated by dies created mostly from punches, which displace the metal of the die instead of removing it. There is evidence of medieval die cutters using engraving tools to lay out designs, and to create detailed punches. However, engraving on the face of the die did not become commonplace until the early Renaissance.|$|R

50|$|Brockage {{errors are}} caused when an already minted coin {{sticks to the}} <b>coin</b> <b>die</b> and impresses onto another blank that hasn't been struck yet, {{pressing}} {{a mirror image of}} the other coin into the blank. Brockages are relatively rare among modern coins of industrialised countries where mints exercise a strict production control and somewhat less rare among the modern coins of some developing countries which operate their own mint (e.g. Nepal); in good condition, coins with clear brockage are a collector's item and can sell for substantial amounts of money.|$|E
50|$|The Sampo {{has been}} {{interpreted}} in many ways: a world pillar or world tree, a compass or astrolabe, a chest containing a treasure, a Byzantine <b>coin</b> <b>die,</b> a decorated Vendel period shield, a Christian relic, etc. In the Kalevala, compiler Lönnrot interpreted {{it to be a}} quern or mill of some sort that made flour, salt, and gold out of thin air.

50|$|A die clash {{occurs when}} a {{planchet}} is not fed into the collar that holds the coin {{in place for the}} minting process. The two dies meet and each carries away part of the design embedded on the die. Coins minted using these dies cause coins to be minted with parts of the reverse design on the obverse or parts of the obverse on the reverse of the <b>coin.</b> <b>Die</b> rotations cause coins to be minted with the reverse or obverse of the coin partially or fully rotated. A die rotation occurs when the dies become loose and they then turn.|$|E

5000|$|From 1572 to 1773 Spanish colonial silver coins were cobs. Initially {{cut from}} a silver bar and hammer struck on a <b>coin</b> <b>die,</b> they were {{accurate}} in weight, though sometimes debased in precious metal content. However unlike machined coins, they were often irregular in shape, especially if a too-thick coin was clipped by the mint to reach the proper weight. After 1732 similar, but better shaped cobs were produced on screw presses. Cob denominations were 1/2, 1, 2, 4, and 8 reales.

50|$|When {{a modern}} <b>coin</b> <b>die</b> is created, it is struck from a working hub, which places the incuse image onto the die that will {{subsequently}} {{be used to}} strike coins. Normally, this requires multiple blows. In 1955, one of the working obverse dies at the Philadelphia Mint was misaligned on the second blow from the working hub, thus resulting in a doubled image. Due to {{the manner in which}} this hubbing was carried out, it most noticeably affected the date and inscriptions, with very little doubling (albeit noticeable loss of detail) visible on the bust of Lincoln. These doubled features were visible on all of the coins struck from this die. It is estimated that 40,000 of these coins were minted, all during one night shift at the Philadelphia Mint. Roughly 20,000-24,000 of the pennies were introduced into circulation after the minting error.|$|E

50|$|In 1852, the Royal Mint {{started to}} strike the second issue, but due to a heavy {{schedule}} and time pressure, the <b>coin</b> <b>dies</b> and planchets were transferred to Heaton's Mint.

50|$|The {{preparation}} of the flan or planchet has varied over the years.
