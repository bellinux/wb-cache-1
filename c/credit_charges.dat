500|$|On {{the same}} day as the Leesburg search, the Boston grand jury handed down a 117-count {{indictment}} that named ten LaRouche associates, two corporations, and three campaign committees. Authorities charged them with making unauthorized <b>credit</b> <b>charges</b> that defrauded $1million from over 1,000 people. The charges also included a scheme to raise funds by soliciting loans with no intention of repaying them. The National Caucus of Labor Committees was charged, along with others, of conspiring to obstruct justice. Prosecutors charged that defendants had burned records, sent potential grand jury witnesses out of the country, and failed to provide subpoenaed evidence. The indictment quoted LaRouche telling an associate that, in reaction to legal problems, [...] "we are going to stall, tie them up in the courts ... just keep stalling, stall and appeal, stall and appeal". Three of the indicted associates remained at large for over a year, and investigators were allegedly given false information. On June 30, 1987, the U.S. grand jury in Boston indicted LaRouche on one count of conspiracy to obstruct justice.|$|E

5000|$|The {{information}} on the website [...] "Illegal.CP" [...] that was uncovered during the investigation by the ICE HSI provides insight into the alleged methods of Shynkarenko and his co-conspirators. According to the ICE HSI, Shynkarenko would advertise to potential customers through e-mails and [...] "pop ups" [...] that contained banners identifying the site [...] "Illegal.CP", {{and more than a}} dozen images of minors engaging in sexual acts with other minors and adults. The ads contained text used to attract new customers, stating [...] "now you are sic few minutes away from the best children porn site on the net!" [...] and [...] "if you join this site you will get tons of uncensored forbidden pics… forbidden stories, and, of course, many videos.", as well as displaying positive comments from a purported current customer of the website, with the words [...] "join now" [...] included on the top and bottom of the page. Once an individual subscribed, they would receive an e-mail providing a username and password for the website, and {{information on}} the website's operating procedure. The e-mail would inform new subscribers that <b>credit</b> <b>charges</b> would appear on the subscriber's credit card statement as the name [...] "ADSOFT" [...] to avoid detection, and would include a charge of $79.99. Once the [...] "Illegal.CP" [...] website was accessed, the initial page contained the following statement: [...] "Our site is illegal in all countries…. Even if you have problems with police you can always say that someone had stolen the information from your credit card and used it. It is very difficult to establish that you were the person to pay for it". The subscriber would then have access to thousands of still images and videos of child pornography, and be able to supply their own personal videos to the website for money.|$|E
40|$|Delayed payment (trade credit) and {{prepayment}} {{are widely}} observed forms of interfirm credit. We propose a simple theory {{to account for}} the prevalence of such credit. A downstream firm trades off inventory holding costs against lost sales. Lost final sales impose a negative externality on the upstream firm. The solution requires a subsidy limited by the value of inputs. Allowing the downstream firm to pay with a delay, an arrangement known as “trade credit,” is precisely such a solution. Further, solving a reverse externality accounts for the use of prepayment for inputs, {{even in the absence of}} any risk of default by the downstreamfirm. We clarify howinput prices vary with such policies as well as when such instruments are more efficient than pure input price adjustments. Thus we account for inter-firm credit as an optimal instrument delivering a targeted inventory subsidy designed to prevent lost sales. The theory offers an explanation for the widespread use of net terms, and the fact that prepayment always carries a zero interest rate. Our results are also consistent with non-responsiveness of trade <b>credit</b> <b>charges</b> to fluctuations in the bank rate as well as market demand, and the fact that trade credit is negatively related to supplier profit level and inventory, but positively related to supplier profit margin...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the growth of}} credit card liquidity in explaining household credit card use. With data from the 2004 Survey of Consumer Finances we identify key predictors of new <b>credit</b> card <b>charges</b> for households. The data suggest credit card spending appears motivated by low-cost access to credit card liquidity. This {{is consistent with previous}} research arguing credit card use is rational, but is contrary to research that emphasizes liquidity constraints in explaining credit card behavior. New <b>credit</b> card <b>charges</b> are primarily predicted by the amount of available liquidity on the card (the limit minus the balance) for all households, controlling for income and other factors. The data also show that credit card spending is primarily done by the more educated and wealthier households, at all income quintiles, and that liquidity constraints {{have little to do with}} credit card use...|$|R
