40|$|Abstract Fluticasone furoate (FF) – USAN {{approved}} name, a new topically active glucocorticoid {{has been}} recently identified. The {{aim of this}} study was to characterise the binding affinity of this compound to the human lung glucocorticoid receptor in relation to other glucocorticoids. Additionally, we sought to determine the binding behaviour of fluticasone furoate to human lung tissue. The glucocorticoid receptor binding kinetics of fluticasone furoate revealed a remarkably fast association and a slow dissociation resulting in a relative receptor affinity (RRA) of 2989 ± 135 with reference to dexamethasone (RRA: 100 ± 5). Thus, the RRA of FF exceeds the RRAs of all currently clinically used corticosteroids such as mometasone furoate (MF; RRA 2244), fluticasone propionate (FP; RRA 1775), <b>ciclesonide's</b> active metabolite (RRA 1212 – rat receptor data) or budesonide (RRA 855). FP and FF displayed pronounced retention in human lung tissue in vitro. Lowest tissue binding was found for MF. There was no indication of instability or chemical modification of FF in human lung tissue. These advantageous binding attributes may contribute to a highly efficacious profile for FF as a topical treatment for inflammatory disorders of the respiratory tract. </p...|$|R

Morning peak expiratory flow was maintained throughout the treatment period in patients treated with <b>ciclesonide</b> and decreased significantly in patients treated with placebo (P= 0. 0003). <b>Ciclesonide</b> (80 and 320 μg) significantly increased forced expiratory volume in 1 s from baseline (0. 13 and 0. 19 L increases, respectively; P< 0. 01); improvements were superior versus placebo (P= 0. 0044 for 80 μg ciclesonide; P< 0. 0001 for 320 μg <b>ciclesonide).</b> The probability of losing efficacy decreased in a dose-dependent manner (55 % for placebo, 38 % for <b>ciclesonide</b> 80 μg, 23 % for <b>ciclesonide</b> 320 μg). Asthma symptom scores and rescue medication use were unchanged with <b>ciclesonide</b> and significantly worsened with placebo.

40|$|SummaryObjectiveTo {{examine the}} {{deposition}} and pharmacokinetics of <b>ciclesonide</b> administered via hydrofluoroalkane-metered dose inhaler (HFA-MDI) {{in patients with}} asthma. MethodsTwelve patients with mild asthma (FEV 1, 95 % predicted) inhaled a single dose of 99 mtechnetium (Tc) -ciclesonide 320 μg ex-actuator (400 μg ex-valve). Deposition of <b>ciclesonide</b> in the lung and oropharynx was quantified using two-dimensional (2 D) -gamma scintigraphy. Three-dimensional single photon emission computed tomography (3 D SPECT) {{was used to assess}} the regional distribution of <b>ciclesonide</b> in the lung. The pharmacokinetics of <b>ciclesonide</b> and its active metabolite, desisobutyryl-ciclesonide (des-CIC), were determined by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. <b>Ciclesonide</b> and des-CIC concentrations were determined in mouth-rinsing solutions. Results 2 D-gamma scintigraphy indicated that <b>ciclesonide</b> deposition was higher in the whole lung (52 %) than in the oropharynx (32. 9 %). Furthermore, 3 D SPECT revealed that <b>ciclesonide</b> deposition within the lungs was highest in the peripheral regions that contain the small airways and alveoli. The pharmacokinetic profile of Tc-labeled <b>ciclesonide</b> and des-CIC was similar to that obtained after inhalation of non-labeled formulations in previous studies. Des-CIC accounted for 14. 9 % of the total molar concentration of ciclesonide/des-CIC in mouth-rinsing solutions obtained between 7 and 12 min after inhalation. ConclusionInhalation of <b>ciclesonide</b> via HFA-MDI results in high pulmonary deposition, especially in the peripheral regions of the lung. High pulmonary deposition contributes to ciclesonide's ability to maintain lung function and control symptoms in patients with asthma.

40|$|Abstract Background <b>Ciclesonide</b> {{is a novel}} inhaled {{corticosteroid}} {{for the treatment of}} airway inflammation. In this study we investigated uptake and in vitro metabolism of <b>ciclesonide</b> in human alveolar type II epithelial cells (A 549). <b>Ciclesonide</b> uptake was compared with fluticasone propionate, an {{inhaled corticosteroid}} that is not metabolized in lung tissue. A 549 cells were incubated with 2 × 10 - 8 M <b>ciclesonide</b> or fluticasone propionate for 3 to 30 min to determine uptake; or with 2 × 10 - 8 M <b>ciclesonide</b> for 1 h, followed by incubation with drug-free buffer for 3, 6, and 24 h to analyze in vitro metabolism. High performance liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry was used to measure the concentrations of both corticosteroids and metabolites. Results At all time points the mean intracellular concentration was higher for <b>ciclesonide</b> when compared with fluticasone propionate. Activation of <b>ciclesonide</b> to desisobutyryl-ciclesonide (des-CIC) was confirmed and conjugates of des-CIC with fatty acids were detected. The intracellular concentration of <b>ciclesonide</b> decreased over time, whereas the concentration of des-CIC remained relatively stable: 2. 27 to 3. 19 pmol/dish between 3 and 24 h. The concentration of des-CIC fatty acid conjugates increased over time, with des-CIC-oleate being the main metabolite. Conclusion Uptake of <b>ciclesonide</b> into A 549 cells was more efficient than that of the less lipophilic fluticasone propionate.

40|$|Abstract: <b>Ciclesonide</b> is a nonhalogenated {{corticosteroid}} that {{is converted}} to its clinically active metabolite, desisobutyryl-ciclesonide, by esterases in the airways. Pharmacodynamic {{studies have shown that}} inhaled <b>ciclesonide</b> has potent antiinflammatory activity in patients with asthma, and {{does not appear to have}} clinically relevant systemic effects, even at high doses. It is highly protein-bound and rapidly metabolized by the liver, and thus has a low oral bioavailability. <b>Ciclesonide</b> is formulated as a solution for inhalation using a hydrofluoroalkane pressurized metered-dose inhaler. This formulation delivers a high fraction of respirable particles that yield high lung deposition with even distribution throughout the lungs and minimal oropharyngeal deposition. Results from numerous 12 -week trials in patients (including children) with varying degrees of asthma show that morning or evening dosing with <b>ciclesonide</b> is more effective than placebo, and at least equivalent to other inhaled corticosteroids such as budesonide and fluticasone, with regard to improved spirometry, symptom scores, and less need for rescue medication. Results with once-daily <b>ciclesonide</b> are similar to those with twice-daily budesonide or fluticasone. At the dosages used in clinical trials, <b>ciclesonide</b> did not exert any untoward adverse effects and did not affect cortisol production. The favorable pharmacological properties of <b>ciclesonide</b> help explain the low incidence of adverse events, which are mostly mild to moderate in nature.

Aim To compare the pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters of des-CIC in children after administration of therapeutic dose of <b>ciclesonide</b> with and without spacer (AeroChamber Plus™). Methods Open-label, 3 period, cross over, repeated dose, PK study in 37 children with mild to moderate stable asthma (age: 6 – 11 y; body weight: 20 – 53 kg). During each 7 -day treatment period, <b>ciclesonide</b> was inhaled once in the morning: A) 160 μg MDI with spacer, B) 80 μg MDI with spacer, and C) 160 μg MDI without spacer. Serum PK parameters of <b>ciclesonide</b> and des-CIC were determined on Day 7 of each period. The primary PK parameters were the AUC τ and C max for des-CIC. Results Inhaling <b>ciclesonide</b> with spacer led to a dose proportional systemic exposure (AUC τ) of des-CIC (0. 316 μg*h/L for 80 μg and 0. 663 μg*h/L for 160 μg). The dose-normalized systemic exposure for des-CIC (based on AUC τ) was 27 % higher after inhalation of <b>ciclesonide</b> 80 μg or 160 μg with spacer than without spacer; the corresponding C max values for des-CIC were, respectively, 63 % and 55 % higher with spacer.

40|$|ABSTRACT: <b>Ciclesonide</b> is {{delivered}} as a small-particle inhaled corticosteroid and improves lung function and airway hyperresponsiveness. The {{objective of the}} present study was to assess whether <b>ciclesonide</b> can specifically improve small airway function in asthma. A total of 16 mild-to-moderate asthma patients (seven males; median (range) age 39 (19 – 56) yrs and forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1) 89 (62 – 120) % predicted) were randomised to 5 weeks ’ treatment with placebo or 320 mg <b>ciclesonide</b> once daily. The following small airway parameters were assessed: mean forced expiratory flow between 25 and 75 % of forced vital capacity (FVC), percentage fall in FVC at provocative dose of adenosine- 59 -monophosphate and of methacholine (MCh) causing a 20 % fall in FEV 1, expiratory lung volume on computed tomography (CT) scan after MCh challenge, single-breath nitrogen closing volume and alveolar exhaled nitric oxide (eNO). Seven subjects received placebo and nine received <b>ciclesonide.</b> Both alveolar eNO and CT measurements of expiratory lung volume after MCh challenge decreased significantly with <b>ciclesonide</b> (median (range) decrease 4. 4 (54. 8 – 1. 4) ppb and 59 (1, 569 –- 117) mL, respectively), and compared with placebo (- 0. 4 (7. 3 –- 3. 4) ppb and- 121 (20 –- 236) mL respectively). <b>Ciclesonide</b> did not significantly improve other small airways parameters.

30|$|<b>Ciclesonide</b> {{has been}} {{reported}} to have similar efficacy to fluticasone but fewer side effects due to its special drug design. <b>Ciclesonide</b> is a prodrug that is converted to an active metabolite, desisobutyryl-ciclesonide (des-CIC), in pulmonary airways by endogenous esterases. This onsite activation reduces oropharyngeal exposure and subsequent side effects. In radioligand binding assays, des-CIC and fluticasone exhibited similar high-affinity binding to the glucocorticoid receptor, whereas <b>ciclesonide</b> exhibited 100 -fold less binding affinity than fluticasone [19]. Furthermore, des-CIC undergoes reversible esterification to fatty acid conjugates in the lung. These conjugates slowly re-release des-CIC and act to greatly enhance lung retention which should provide more topical efficacy and less systemic side effects. Once in the systemic circulation, des-CIC is rapidly metabolized by P- 450 enzymes, mainly CYP 3 A 4 [19]. It has been claimed that <b>ciclesonide</b> has a better safety profile compared to other ICS. For example, Belvisi et al. [19] showed that in preclinical models of antigen-induced airway eosinophilia and Sephadex-induced lung edema using Brown Norway rats, <b>ciclesonide</b> showed comparable efficacy with fluticasone, although <b>ciclesonide</b> was 7 – 9 -fold less potent in terms of ED 50. In a subsequent 7 -day side effect study with Sprague–Dawley rats, <b>ciclesonide</b> was 44 -fold less potent at inducing adrenal involution, sixfold less potent at inducing thymus involution, and 22 -fold less potent at decreasing bone growth than fluticasone [19].|$|E

We therefore aimed to systematically review published randomised controlled trials of the effectiveness and safety of <b>ciclesonide</b> compared to alternative inhaled corticosteroids in people with asthma. Methods We performed literature searches on MEDLINE, EMBASE, PUBMED, the COCHRANE LIBRARY and various Internet evidence sources for randomised controlled trials or systematic reviews comparing <b>ciclesonide</b> to beclomethasone or budesonide or fluticasone in adult humans with persistent asthma. Data was extracted by one reviewer. Results Five studies met the inclusion criteria. Methodological quality was variable. There were no trials comparing <b>ciclesonide</b> to beclomethasone. There {{was no significant difference between}} <b>ciclesonide</b> and budesonide or fluticasone on the following outcomes: lung function, symptoms, quality of life, airway responsiveness to a provoking agent or inflammatory markers. However, the trials were very small in size, increasing the possibility of a type II error. One trial demonstrated that the combined deposition of <b>ciclesonide</b> (and its active metabolite) in the oropharynx was 47 % of that of budesonide while another trial demonstrated that the combined deposition of <b>ciclesonide</b> (and its active metabolite) in the oropharynx was 53 % of that of fluticasone.

Further to asthma control and quality of life, self-reported side effects of treatment can be assessed with the validated Inhaled Corticosteroid Questionnaire (ICQ). ObjectivesTo compare patient-reported side effects between the inhaled corticosteroids <b>ciclesonide</b> and fluticasone propionate. MethodsPatients with moderate or moderate-to-severe asthma, pre-treated with a constant dose and type of medication, were randomized in three separate studies: 1) once daily <b>ciclesonide</b> 320  μg (n =  234) or twice daily fluticasone propionate 200  μg (n =  240); 2) twice daily <b>ciclesonide</b> 320  μg (n =  255) or twice daily fluticasone propionate 375  μg (n =  273); and 3) twice daily <b>ciclesonide</b> 320  μg (n =  259) or twice daily fluticasone propionate 500  μg (n =  244). Patients rated the side effect questions of the 15 domain ICQ on a 7 -point Likert scale (0  = not at all, 6  = a very great deal) during scheduled visits. ResultsThe majority of side effect scores remained similar with <b>ciclesonide</b> but worsened statistically significantly with fluticasone propionate from baseline {{to the end of the}} study in within-treatment analyses. In between-treatment analyses of studies 1 and 3 <b>ciclesonide</b> significantly improved total side effect scores (p <  0. 025) and 14 out of 30 individual local and systemic domain scores (p <  0. 025) compared with fluticasone propionate. In Study 2, although <b>ciclesonide</b> improved the majority of scores compared with fluticasone propionate only ‘oropharyngeal itching’ reached statistical significance (p <  0. 025, one-sided). ConclusionPatient-perceived side effects differ depending on the type of inhaled corticosteroids used.

It is available as a hydrofluroalkane pressurized metered-dose inhaler in two strengths, 80 mcg/activation and 160 mcg/activation, with the recommenced dosage being two inhalations twice-daily. It is a prodrug that is converted in the lung to its active form, which possesses 100 -fold greater glucocorticoid-receptor-binding affinity than the parent compound. Its relative receptor affinity is similar to budesonide. In clinical studies, <b>ciclesonide</b> was effective in improving pulmonary function, reducing asthma symptoms, and reducing or eliminating the need for oral corticosteroids (OCSs). Patients with severe asthma dependent on OCSs and high doses of ICSs were able to achieve greater asthma control and reduce or even eliminate the use of OCSs when switched to <b>ciclesonide.</b> In comparison with fluticasone propionate and budesonide, <b>ciclesonide</b> was demonstrated to be at least as effective in maintaining pulmonary function and asthma control.

40|$|Background: Inhaled {{corticosteroids}} (ICS) are {{an integral}} part of asthma management, and act as an anti-inflammatory agent in the airways of the lung. These agents confer both significant benefit in terms of symptom management and improvement in lung function, but may also cause harm in terms of local and systemic side-effects. <b>Ciclesonide</b> is a novel steroid that is metabolised to its active component in the lung, making it a potentially useful for reducing local side effects. Objectives: To assess the efficacy and adverse effects of <b>ciclesonide</b> relative to those of other inhaled corticosteroids in the management of chronic asthma. Search straegy: We searched the Cochrane Airways Group register of trials with pre-defined terms. Additional searches of PubMed and Clinicalstudyresults. org were undertaken. The literature searches for this review are current up to June 2007. Selection criteria: Randomised parallel or crossover studies were eligible for the review. We included studies comparing <b>ciclesonide</b> with other steroids both at nominally equivalent dose or lower doses of <b>ciclesonide.</b> Data collection and analysis : Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. Study authors were contacted for additional information. Adverse effects information was collected from the trials. Main results: Twenty one trials involving 7243 participants were included. Equal daily doses of <b>ciclesonide</b> and beclomethasone (BDP) or budesonide (BUD) gave similar results for peak expiratory flow rates (PEF), although forced vital capacity (FVC) was higher with <b>ciclesonide.</b> Data on forced expired volume in one second (FEV 1) were inconsistent. Withdrawal data and symptoms were similar between treatments. Compared with the same dose of fluticasone (FP), data on lung function parameters (FEV 1, FVC and PEF) did not differ significantly. Paediatric quality of life score favoured <b>ciclesonide.</b> Candidiasis was less frequent with <b>ciclesonide,</b> although other side-effect outcomes did not give significant differences in favour of either treatment. When lower doses of <b>ciclesonide</b> were compared to BDP or BUD, the difference in FEV 1 did not reach significance but we cannot exclude a significant effect in favour of BDP/BUD. Other lung function outcomes did not give significant differences between treatments. Paediatric quality of life scores did not differ between treatments. Adverse events occurred with similar frequency between <b>ciclesonide</b> and BDP/BUD. Comparison with FP at half the nominal dose was undertaken in three studies, which indicated that FEV 1 was not significantly different, but was not equivalent between the treatments (per protocol: - 0. 05 L 95 % confidence intervals - 0. 11 to 0. 01). Authors' Conclusions: The results of this review give some support to <b>ciclesonide</b> as an equivalent therapy to other ICS at similar nominal doses. The studies assessed low doses of steroids, in patients whose asthma required treatment with low doses of steroids. At half the dose of FP and BDP/BUD, the effects of <b>ciclesonide</b> were more inconsistent The effect on candidiasis may be of importance to people who find this to be problematic. The role of <b>ciclesonide</b> in the management of asthma requires further study, especially in paediatric patients. Further assessment against FP at a dose ratio of 1 : 2 is a priority...|$|E
40|$|Rationale: Oral {{corticosteroids}} effectively treat asthma exacerbations but {{are associated}} with well-described side effects. Objective: This study compared the efficacy and safety of a high dose of an inhaled corticosteroid with oral prednisolone in patients with worsening of their asthma after medication withdrawal. Methods: Patients tapered off their inhaled corticosteroids until they reached predefined criteria of "worsening asthma". Randomized patients (n= 130) were treated double blind with either <b>ciclesonide</b> 800 ?g twice daily (starting with 800 ?g hourly for 3 h after randomization) or prednisolone 40 mg once daily for 2 weeks. Spirometry, daily asthma symptoms, morning and evening peak expiratory flow and blood parameters were assessed in all, methacholine challenge and inflammatory measures were determined in induced sputum in a subset of patients. Results: <b>Ciclesonide</b> was as effective as prednisolone in improving forced expiratory flow in 1 s, morning peak expiratory flow and symptoms, the latter improving more rapidly with <b>ciclesonide.</b> No {{differences were found in}} methacholine responsiveness or inflammatory measures in sputum or blood. <b>Ciclesonide</b> caused significantly less reduction in morning plasma cortisol levels (p< 0. 0001). Conclusion: This study shows that inhaled <b>ciclesonide</b> (800 ?g twice daily) has comparable efficacy to oral prednisolone (40 mg once daily) to regain asthma control in patients with asthma worsening. The more rapid onset and smaller effect on cortisol suppression suggest a better safety profile of <b>ciclesonide...</b>|$|E

Kenreigh, Linda Timm Wagner, Paul ChrispMLC Solutions Ltd, Galena, Ohio, USA, and Core Medical Publishing, Knutsford, UKIntroduction: Asthma, a {{respiratory}} disease associated with airway inflammation and hyperresponsiveness, {{is one of}} the most prevalent chronic diseases worldwide affecting both children and adults. Inhaled corticosteroids are considered to be the cornerstone of asthma management. <b>Ciclesonide,</b> an airway-activated inhaled corticosteroid, has been developed for the management of persistent asthma. Its once-daily administration and airway activation may be advantageous in the treatment of asthma. Aims: The purpose of this article is to review the place in therapy of <b>ciclesonide</b> in the management of patients with persistent asthma based on the available clinical evidence. &nbsp; Evidence review: The available evidence indicates that <b>ciclesonide</b> has an effect on pulmonary function (forced expiratory volume in 1 s, forced vital capacity, and peak expiratory flow), as well as producing improvements in patient-reported symptoms that are equivalent to those achieved with other inhaled corticosteroids. A few studies have focused on health-related quality of life and have demonstrated a positive effect with <b>ciclesonide</b> treatment. Its pharmacokinetic profile may offer advantages in terms of adverse effects, both local and systemic, although most of the data come from 12 -week studies. Place in therapy: The current evidence shows that <b>ciclesonide</b> offers another alternative among inhaled corticosteroids, with the potential for fewer adverse effects. The unique pharmacokinetic profile of <b>ciclesonide</b> allows once-daily administration and the airway activation of the drug appears to confer clinical benefit in the treatment of asthma. Its lack of systemic adverse effects make it a viable option for pediatric use. Key words: antiinflammatory, asthma, <b>ciclesonide,</b> evidence, inhaled corticosteroids, outcome...|$|E

We assessed the effects of <b>ciclesonide</b> in preschool children with recurrent wheeze. MethodsWe included children 2 – 6  yrs with recurrent wheeze and a positive asthma predictive index or aeroallergen sensitization to, excluding patients with episodic viral wheezing. After a 2 – 4 -week baseline period, patients with ongoing symptoms or rescue medication use were randomised to once-daily <b>ciclesonide</b> 40, 80, 160  μg or placebo for 24 weeks. ResultsThe number of wheeze exacerbations requiring systemic corticosteroids was unexpectedly low in all groups: 25 (10. 2 %) in placebo group, as compared to 11 (4. 4 %), 18 (7. 3 %), and 17 (6. 7 %) in <b>ciclesonide</b> 40, 80, and 160  μg, respectively. The difference in time to first exacerbation was not significantly different between groups (p =  0. 786), but the difference in exacerbation rates between placebo and the pooled <b>ciclesonide</b> groups was (p =  0. 03). Large and significant (p <  0. 0001) improvements in symptom scores and rescue medication use occurred in all groups, including placebo. Improvements in FEV 1 and FEF 25 – 75 (measured in 284 4 – 6  yr olds) were larger in the <b>ciclesonide</b> than in the placebo group.
