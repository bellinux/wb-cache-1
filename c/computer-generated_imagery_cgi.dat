5|$|Walt Disney Animation Studios {{continues}} to produce films using both traditional animation and <b>computer-generated</b> <b>imagery</b> (<b>CGI).</b> At the present, Andrew Millstein {{is the general}} manager of the studio for day-to-day business affairs, under the direction of Edwin Catmull and John Lasseter who also oversee Pixar.|$|E
5|$|It was {{the first}} Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles film made with <b>computer-generated</b> <b>imagery</b> (<b>CGI),</b> created by Imagi Animation Studios, {{as well as the}} first feature film in the {{franchise}} in 14 years. The film sees the four Turtles (Raphael, Leonardo, Donatello, and Michelangelo) grow apart after their final defeat of the Shredder, when strange things are happening in New York City as ancient creatures threaten the world and the Turtles must reunite to save it.|$|E
5|$|The episode {{featured}} the penultimate {{appearance of the}} alien black oil; it would appear for a final time via flashback in the series' finale. Visual effects for the black oil were created with molasses, chocolate syrup, and <b>computer-generated</b> <b>imagery</b> (<b>CGI).</b> A scene showing black oil {{coming out of a}} worker's eyes, ears, and mouth was mostly filmed on a visual effects stage. Nine takes were needed to get the syrupy mixture to spill correctly.|$|E

5|$|Upon its premiere, the two-episode finale was {{watched by}} 3.35 million viewers. The episodes {{received}} generally positive reviews from commentators, {{many of whom}} felt that the series was successfully able to wrap up its story arcs. Rosenbaum's return was met with critical applause; however, the artistic decision to not show Welling in the full Superman suit and instead to render Superman using <b>computer-generated</b> <b>imagery</b> (<b>CGI)</b> was met with negativity.|$|E
5|$|Alice in Wonderland {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} upon release; although praised for its visual style and special effects, {{the film was}} criticized for its lack of narrative coherence and overuse of <b>computer-generated</b> <b>imagery</b> (<b>CGI).</b> At the 83rd Academy Awards, Alice in Wonderland won Best Art Direction and Best Costume Design, and was also nominated for Best Visual Effects. The film generated over $1 billion in ticket sales and became the fifth-highest-grossing film of all time during its theatrical run.|$|E
5|$|Muren {{found both}} stop motion and optical effects {{to be too}} {{technically}} challenging and decided that the transformation scene would be a perfect opportunity for ILM to create advances with digital morphing technology. He proposed filming each animal, and the actress doubling for Hayes, and then feeding the images into a computer program developed by Doug Smythe. The program would then create a smooth transition from one stage to another before outputting the result back onto film. Smythe began development of the necessary software in September 1987. By March 1988, the impressive result Muren and fellow designer David Allen achieved what would represent a breakthrough for <b>computer-generated</b> <b>imagery</b> (<b>CGI).</b> The head of ILM's animation department, Wes Takahashi, supervised the film's animation sequences.|$|E

5|$|Similar to Tangled, Frozen {{employed}} a unique artistic style by blending together features of both <b>computer-generated</b> <b>imagery</b> (<b>CGI)</b> and traditional hand-drawn animation. From the beginning, Buck knew Giaimo {{was the best}} candidate to develop the style he had in mind– which would draw from the best Disney hand-drawn classics of the 1950s, the Disney Little Golden Books, and mid-century modern design– and persuaded {{him to come back}} to Disney to serve as the art director for Frozen. Buck, Lasseter, and Giaimo were all old friends who had first met at the California Institute of the Arts, and Giaimo had previously served as the art director for Disney's Pocahontas (1995), which Buck had worked on as a supervising animator.|$|E
5|$|An {{extended}} {{version of the}} film, including altered special effects, was released on March 22, 2002. Certain shots of E.T. had bothered Spielberg since 1982, as {{he did not have}} enough time to perfect the animatronics. <b>Computer-generated</b> <b>imagery</b> (<b>CGI),</b> provided by Industrial Light & Magic (ILM), was used to modify several shots, including ones of E.T. running in the opening sequence and being spotted in the cornfield. The spaceship's design was also altered to include more lights. Scenes shot for but not included in the original version were introduced. These included E.T. taking a bath, and Gertie telling Mary that Elliott went to the forest on Halloween. Spielberg did not add the scene featuring Harrison Ford, feeling that would reshape the film too drastically. He became more sensitive about the scene where gun-wielding federal agents confront Elliott and his escaping friends and had them digitally replaced with walkie-talkies.|$|E
5|$|Development of {{the film}} began after {{production}} had finished on The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1996). Instead of another musical, the production team decided to do an action-adventure film inspired by the works of Jules Verne. Atlantis was notable for adopting the distinctive visual style of comic book creator Mike Mignola. At {{the time of its}} release, the film had made greater use of <b>computer-generated</b> <b>imagery</b> (<b>CGI)</b> than any of Disney's previous traditionally animated features; it remains one of the few to have been shot in anamorphic format. Linguist Marc Okrand created a language specifically for use in Atlantis, with James Newton Howard providing the film's score. The film was released at a time when audience interest in animated films was shifting away from hand-drawn animation toward films with full CGI.|$|E

5|$|Davies {{wanted the}} Doctor to realise that Rose has {{something}} to offer to his cause. Their holding hands while running was meant to signify {{that they were a}} team, despite him not asking her yet, and they were not to question their relationship. The episode was intended to be presented from Rose's point-of-view. For audience identification purposes, Davies wanted the alien menace to be easily mistaken as human, so that it was possible for Rose to mistake the aliens for humans. Davies felt that {{there was no need to}} create a new monster, as the Autons met these criteria. The Auton sequences were difficult to film because the costumes were uncomfortable for the actors; which meant that frequent breaks from filming were needed. <b>Computer-generated</b> <b>imagery</b> (<b>CGI)</b> was used in post-production to cover up the zipper on the back of the necks of the Auton costumes. Davies wanted to recreate the scene of the Autons breaking out of shop windows from their first appearance in Spearhead from Space, although he had the budget to actually smash the glass instead of just cutting around it like in Spearhead.|$|E
5|$|Throughout his scenes, Rupert Graves was tanned {{because before}} filming the episode, the actor was in Guadeloupe, an island on the Caribbean, {{appearing}} in Death in Paradise. As a result, Gatiss added mention that Lestrade went on holiday in the script. In the original episode, John was to hallucinate the hound at a meat storage locker. However, after visiting such a locker in Bristol, the producers came to realise {{that it would}} be too expensive, and cold for Freeman, forcing them to change the setting to the Baskerville labs. In one scene, Sherlock is driving a Land Rover with John as a passenger after their arrival at Dartmoor; John was originally {{going to be the one}} driving the car, however Freeman cannot drive. In the client scenes, Tovey had to smoke a herbal cigarette as it was illegal to smoke real cigarettes on set. Throughout the episode, the production crew used split dioptres in certain scenes, a camera technique where two separate camera angles are at the same focus on screen. The episode also includes shots of the hound, which was produced by visual effects. Although the series used <b>computer-generated</b> <b>imagery</b> (<b>CGI)</b> in the past, it was the first time a visual effect was made on a large scale. However, there was no guide for the cast to interact with.|$|E

25|$|Before the film's release, {{its title}} was changed from Rapunzel to Tangled, {{reportedly}} {{to market the}} film as gender-neutral. Tangled spent six years in production at a cost that has been estimated at $260 million, which if accurate, would make it the most expensive animated film ever made and the fifth most-expensive film of all time. The film employed a unique artistic style by blending together features of <b>computer-generated</b> <b>imagery</b> (<b>CGI)</b> and traditional animation while using non-photorealistic rendering to create {{the impression of a}} painting. Composer Alan Menken, who had worked on prior Disney animated features, returned to score Tangled.|$|E
