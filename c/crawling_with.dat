5|$|Octopuses mainly {{move about}} by {{relatively}} slow <b>crawling,</b> <b>with</b> some {{swimming in a}} head-first position. Jet propulsion, or backwards swimming, is their fastest means of locomotion, followed by swimming and crawling. When in no hurry, they usually crawl on either solid or soft surfaces. Several arms are extended forwards, some of the suckers adhere to the substrate and the animal hauls itself forwards with its powerful arm muscles, while other arms may push rather than pull. As progress is made, other arms move ahead to repeat these actions and the original suckers detach. During crawling, the heart rate nearly doubles, and the animal requires ten or fifteen minutes to recover from relatively minor exercise.|$|E
5|$|With Central Europe {{now under}} the Empire's dominance, Barbarossa turns his {{attention}} to Italy, namely Milan and the Pope. The rise of the Holy Roman Empire has challenged {{the power of the}} Pope in Europe, hence why Barbarossa must be able to subjugate the Italian realms who plot against him. Once again, Henry the Lion betrays Barbarossa, only this time he is stripped of his titles and forced into exile whilst Barbarossa is able to ascertain his superiority in Italy. The Third Crusade begins in the Middle East, and Barbarossa pledges his Empire's support to the coming campaign. But the Holy Roman Empire's army is far too strong for any Navy to carry, forcing Barbarossa to march his troops through hostile Constantinople and Anatolia, which is <b>crawling</b> <b>with</b> Seljuk Turks. During this march, Barbarossa drowns by the weight of his armour in a river current, leaving his army to continue to the Dome of the Rock in Jerusalem with their dead Emperor to fulfil his wishes.|$|E

500|$|On January 8, 2017, Streep {{accepted}} the Cecil B. DeMille Award for Lifetime Achievement at the Golden Globes, {{during which she}} delivered a highly political speech that criticized then President-elect Donald Trump. She said that Trump {{had a very strong}} platform and was using it inappropriately. She said that he mocked a disabled reporter, Serge F. Kovaleski, whom in her words Trump [...] "outranked in privilege, power and the capacity to fight back", and that [...] "When the powerful use their position to bully, we all lose." [...] She also said [...] "Hollywood is <b>crawling</b> <b>with</b> outsiders and foreigners, and if you kick us all out, you'll have nothing to watch except for football and mixed martial arts, which are not arts". Trump responded on Twitter by calling Streep [...] "one of the most over-rated actresses in Hollywood" [...] and [...] "a Hillary flunky who lost big". The White House press secretary at the time, Josh Earnest, defended Streep's comments, saying that she was exercising her First Amendment rights to freedom of speech.|$|E

500|$|A {{small company}} of Hessian dragoons led by Captain Johann Ewald {{headed up the}} road from the tavern toward Cooch's Bridge as Cornwallis's advance guard. [...] These were struck by a volley of fire from an American ambush and many of them fell, either killed or wounded. [...] Ewald {{remained}} unwounded, and quickly alerted the Hessian and Ansbach Jäger, who rushed forward to meet the Americans. [...] This began a running skirmish that Major John André described as follows: [...] "Here the rebels began to attack us about 9o'clock with a continued irregular fire for nearly two miles." [...] Howe rode to the front lines, and seeing Iron Hill <b>crawling</b> <b>with</b> enemy soldiers, ordered his troops to clear it. At this time, much of Maxwell's force was defending Iron Hill, while the rest were protecting Cooch's Bridge. The Jäger, numbering over 400men led by Lieutenant Colonel Ludwig von Wurmb, formed a line and, with the support of some artillery, advanced on the Americans. [...] Von Wurmb sent one detachment to Maxwell's left, hoping to flank his position, and supported the move with a bayonet charge against the American center.|$|E

2500|$|... 1938 - A new Exposition Internationale du Surréalisme {{was held}} at the Beaux-arts Gallery, Paris, with more than 60 artists from {{different}} countries, and showed around 300 paintings, objects, collages, photographs and installations. The Surrealists wanted to create an exhibition which in itself would be a creative act and called on Marcel Duchamp, Wolfgang Paalen, Man Ray and others to do so. At the exhibition's entrance Salvador Dalí placed his Rainy Taxi (an old taxi rigged to produce a steady drizzle of water down the inside of the windows, and a shark-headed creature in the driver's seat and a blond mannequin <b>crawling</b> <b>with</b> live snails in the back) greeted the patrons who were in full evening dress. Surrealist Street filled one side of the lobby with mannequins dressed by various Surrealists. Paalen and Duchamp designed the main hall to seem like subterranean cave with 1,200 coal bags suspended from the ceiling over a coal brazier with a single light bulb which provided the only lighting, as well as the floor covered with humid leaves and mud. The patrons were given flashlights with which to view the art. On the floor Wolfgang Paalen created a small lake with grasses and the aroma of roasting coffee filled the air. Much to the Surrealists' satisfaction the exhibition scandalized the viewers.|$|E
2500|$|There were {{echoes of}} Jonathan Edwards in both McGready’s {{theology}} {{and in the}} language he used in his sermons. [...] Although he was ecumenical in his invitation to Methodists and others, with whom he disagreed on theological matters, to assist him in revivals. [...] McGready was an unapologetic Calvinist. [...] He believed that only the irresistible grace of God could enable the faith necessary for conversion, and that sinful man was devoid of the capacity to effect, or choose his own salvation. [...] McGready believed he was acting on a solemn charge to shine the light of truth on man’s desperate spiritual condition, that judgment awaited, and was possibly imminent: [...] “The ungodly and finally impenitent will now be ripe for destruction…they shall reap a harvest of immortal woe….This is, indeed, the solemn, dreadful harvest day; the tares are separated from the wheat, and… cast into everlasting fire." [...] Conversion, then, was not a mere moral readjustment, but a cataclysmic recreation of a spirit corrupted by sin. [...] In this context, McGready, like Edwards, saw dramatic conversion experiences that caused people to swoon or cry out as the physical manifestation of unseen spiritual activity. McGready’s focus on the need of the people for regeneration was not reserved for overt sinners, but also for church members who relied on exhibiting a moral life {{and knowledge of the}} Westminster catechism, but had not experienced a saving change. [...] To McGready, all such people were in need of conversion. [...] He regarded the participation in the sacrament without evidence of heart-felt regeneration as a serious hypocrisy, telling his congregation that “an unworthy communicant …is more offensive to Almighty God than a loathsome carcass <b>crawling</b> <b>with</b> vermin." ...|$|E
