5|$|Bekele was keen {{to regain}} his cross country title from Zersenay and the 2008 cross country season was a {{competitive}} one. At the Great Edinburgh International <b>Cross</b> <b>Country</b> <b>race,</b> Zersenay was pipped by the Ethiopian at the line, finishing just one second behind. The following month, Zersenay beat Eliud Kipchoge to win the Cinque Mulini race in the buildup to the 2008 IAAF World Cross Country Championships. On {{the day of the}} Championship race in Edinburgh, Scotland, Zersenay took the lead early on and set a strong pace at the mid-race point. However, near the finish Bekele and Kenyan Leonard Komon surged ahead to leave Zersenay as the bronze medallist.|$|E
5|$|Nurmi {{made his}} {{international}} debut in August at the 1920 Summer Olympics in Antwerp, Belgium. He {{took his first}} medal by finishing second to Frenchman Joseph Guillemot in the 5000 m. This would remain {{the only time that}} Nurmi lost to a non-Finnish runner in the Olympics. He went on to win gold medals in his other three events: the 10,000 m, sprinting past Guillemot on the final curve and improving his personal best by over a minute, the <b>cross</b> <b>country</b> <b>race,</b> beating Sweden's Eric Backman, and the cross country team event where he helped Heikki Liimatainen and Teodor Koskenniemi defeat the British and Swedish teams. Nurmi's success brought electric lighting and running water for his family in Turku. Nurmi, however, was given a scholarship to study at the Teollisuuskoulu industrial school in Helsinki.|$|E

Although she missed out on {{a place for the}} world team, she headed to the newly created 2011 African Cross Country Championships and won the gold in a medal sweep alongside Viola Kibiwot and Doris Changeywo. Her cross country season ended with a top three finish at the Trofeo Alasport. On the 2011 Diamond League circuit she placed in the top three of the 5000m at the Prefontaine Classic and the Meeting Areva. She was chosen for the Kenyan senior track team {{for the first time and}} came fifth over 5000m at the 2011 World Championships in Athletics.|$|E
25|$|Mihalić's {{entry into}} {{athletics}} was almost coincidental. In 1940, {{one of the}} events of the Workers' Sports Games in Zagreb was a <b>cross</b> <b>country</b> <b>race.</b> Mihalić was nominated for the race by his football club Grafičar as he was their fastest player. Despite the fact that he entered the first foot race in his life without any training, he placed second out of approximately 200 participants, narrowly losing to an experienced athlete. This event was crucial in his decision to leave cycling and take up athletics. He joined the Concordia Zagreb athletics club and after only several months of training set his first national record in the 5000 meters, followed shortly by a national record in the 10,000 meters.|$|E
25|$|Representing the Ethiopian Banks team, he won {{the junior}} title at the 2007 Addis Ababa <b>cross</b> <b>country</b> <b>race,</b> beating Hunegnaw Mesfin by a second. He was fourth in the junior {{category}} at the 2008 Ethiopian Cross Country Championships and was selected for the 2008 IAAF World Cross Country Championships, where he finished 18th (just outside the Ethiopian team which won the silver medal). Back on the track, he ran at the Adidas Track Classic in May and set a new personal best of 13:08.96minutes, second only to Ali Abdosh. He was among the fastest entrants at the 2008 World Junior Championships in Athletics and took the 5000m bronze medal while his compatriot Abreham Cherkos won the gold.|$|E

25|$|Weidlinger competed at the Cinque Mulini <b>cross</b> <b>country</b> <b>race</b> {{in early}} 2008 {{and managed to}} finish in sixth place. He set two new {{national}} records in May that year: first, he ran 27:36.46 in the 10,000m at the Payton Jordan Cardinal Invitational in Palo Alto, California, taking second behind Craig Mottram. He then set a 10km Austrian record at the Great Manchester Run: his winning time of 28:10 was just enough to hold off Serhiy Lebid and Mustafa Mohamed at the finish line. Weidlinger won the Group A 5000m {{for a second time}} at the 2008 European Cup. He competed in the 10,000m at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing and finished 27th in a time of 28:14.38. This made him the fifth best performing European in the event. On September 1, 2008 he won the Nike Human Race 10K race with a time of 29:25 while running in Munich, Germany.|$|E
25|$|Her {{principal}} race of 1991 {{came over}} 10,000m at the 1991 World Championships in Athletics. Although she qualified easily with a run 31:55.97 minutes, {{she could not}} match this form in the final, in which she finished 19th and was over a minute slower. Sergent's career began to decline and in 1992 she came 27th at the 1992 World <b>Cross</b> <b>Country</b> <b>race</b> and failed {{to make it out}} of the 10,000m heats at the 1992 Barcelona Olympics. She was part of the bronze medal-winning women's team at the 1993 IAAF World Cross Country Championships, but it was Farida Fatès who led the team while Sergent finished in 34th place. At the 1993 World Championships in Athletics she was eliminated in the heats of the 3000m in her third and final appearance at the competition. She did not end the season empty handed, however, as at the 1993 Mediterranean Games, held on home turf in Languedoc-Roussillon, she took the silver medal over 3000m.|$|E
25|$|Starting 2000, Radcliffe won the Stormont <b>Cross</b> <b>Country</b> <b>race</b> {{for a third}} time. Radcliffe then {{finished}} fourth in Durham. Radcliffe then sustained a knee injury in a bizarre way, as she was sidelined after kneeling on the floor writing thank you letters for wedding presents. For the European Cup, Radcliffe joined {{a host of other}} British athletes by pulled out injured. However, Radcliffe soon returned to the track {{for the first time since}} March after a virus, a knee operation and a calf muscle tear had kept her out; to race over 1,500metres in Barcelona. In her first race since the World Cross Country, Radcliffe finished 11th. At the London Grand Prix, Radcliffe finished second, one second outside of her British record, in only her second track race of the season. At the Weltklasse Zürich IAAF Golden League meeting Radcliffe competed in the 3,000metres and finished in fourth place. At the UK trials, Radcliffe wore long white socks after she twisted her ankle days before; and powered to the 5,000metres title. The British Grand Prix saw Radcliffe race over 3000metres, where once again she finished third. At the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney, Radcliffe finished sixth in her 10,000metres heat to qualify for the final. In the final Radcliffe set a new British record, but crossed the line in fourth and was highly disappointed to miss out on a medal. Radcliffe returned to action by winning the BUPA Ireland five-mile race. At the Great North Run, Radcliffe ran a new European record for the half marathon, as she won the race in a time of 67 minutes and 7 seconds. Radcliffe was then selected for the 2000 IAAF World Half Marathon Championships in Mexico. Radcliffe won her first World title, despite suffering a panic attack when her nose tape, designed to help her breathe, fell off halfway round. The good run of form came to an end, when she turned her attention to the Cross Country events and finished third in Brussels. Radcliffe confirmed, that her last race of the year would be the Great North Cross Country. There Radcliffe defeated Tulu by seventy-five seconds, in eight inches of snow.|$|E

500|$|By {{the time}} {{she went back to}} {{mountain}} biking after the Commonwealth Games to defend her national title, Lynch had already missed the first two of the six rounds. As the four best results counted towards the title, {{there was no room for}} error. Lynch was in top form, won the remaining four national series races, and retained her title. With this accomplished, Braggins and Lynch travelled to the United States to prepare for the inaugural UCI Mountain Bike World Championships in 1990; prior to this, there were two separate events run by NORBA in the USA, and by Grundig in Europe. At the final NORBA race, Lynch crashed badly. She took a couple of Aspirin, unaware that she was allergic to the drug. Just before the UCI World Championship race, Lynch needed hospital treatment for internal bleeding caused by her pain medication. She still competed, coming a [...] "disappointing" [...] tenth place in the <b>cross</b> <b>country</b> <b>race</b> after having hoped for a higher finish.|$|E
500|$|She had {{her usual}} {{domestic}} success in 1993, {{including a new}} record time in the Coast to Coast. Her focus sharpened in early 1994 {{when it was announced}} that mountain biking would be an Olympic event at the 1996 Atlanta Games. Although she would be 39 then, {{she did not want to}} give the selectors an opportunity to look past her. The 1994 domestic mountain bike season was the most competitive yet, with Kate Rattray and the visiting Susan DeMattei providing good competition, but it was 1995 where it counted. Rather than go for another veteran's medal, Lynch entered the Pro race at the 1995 UCI Mountain Bike World Championships in Kirchzarten in Germany's Black Forest. Lynch had a fierce start of the <b>cross</b> <b>country</b> <b>race</b> and led the field into the first climb. One by one, younger and full-time professional cylists went past her, and Lynch ended up 21st, with Mary Grigson 33rd, and the other Kiwis further back. They had gained New Zealand two qualifying positions for the Olympics; no New Zealand men qualified. Grigson accepted an offer to race for Australia and left New Zealand (she competed at the Olympics in 1996 and 2000), so the New Zealand Mountain Bike Association decided to nominate just one competitor for the New Zealand Olympic team. The team was announced on 16 April 1996 and Lynch's name came up. This was by no means a foregone conclusion, and Lynch thinks that she was selected against the selection panel's inclinations: ...|$|E

Radcliffe missed the World Cross Country Championships with a foot injury. Radcliffe was initially misdiagnosed with the injury which forced her to miss all of 1994 and thought about quitting as the injury would not get better. At the Fanny Blankers-Koen Games in Hengelo in 1995 Radcliffe outkicked Tulu to run the third fastest time by a British woman for the 5,000metres.
