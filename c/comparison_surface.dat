5000|$|The habitat {{accommodates}} four {{scientists and}} two technicians for missions averaging ten days. Scientists on the Aquarius are often called [...] "Aquanauts" [...] (as they live underwater at depth pressure {{for a period}} {{equal to or greater}} than 24 continuous hours without returning to the surface). A technique known as saturation diving allows the aquanauts to live and work underwater for days or weeks at a time. After twenty four hours underwater at any depth, the human body becomes saturated with dissolved gas. With saturation diving, divers can accurately predict exactly how much time they need to decompress before returning to the surface. This information limits the risk of decompression sickness. By living in the Aquarius habitat and working at the same depth on the ocean floor, Aquarius aquanauts are able to remain underwater for the duration of their mission. In addition, because Aquarius allows saturation diving, dives from the habitat can last for up to nine hours at a time; by <b>comparison,</b> <b>surface</b> dives usually last between one and two hours. These long dive times allow for observation that would not otherwise be possible. Way stations on the reef outside Aquarius allow aquanauts to refill their scuba tanks during dives.|$|E

There are many such capillary problems in which, due to the symmetry of the fixed surface, one cannot hope for a capillary surface which is a strict local minimum for energy.

When compared over time, three of the four treated lawns had significantly higher soil water content than the untreated lawns.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a numerical {{investigation of the}} hypersonic reacting How around the FIRE II reentry capsule. At the chosen freestream conditions, the forebody boundary layer and the separated flow on the afterbody are turbulent. The Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes method along with two commonly used turbulence models are used to compute the flowfield. Accurate prediction of turbulent separated flow at hypersonic conditions is challenging due to {{the limitations of the}} underlying turbulence models. The presence of turbulent eddy viscosity in the flow simulation results in a smaller separation bubble than the laminar solution at identical conditions. Also, the two turbulence models predict different levels of eddy viscosity in the neck region. This has a dominant effect on the separation bubble size and the surface pressure. On the other hand, the eddy viscosity values in the near-wall region determine the heat transfer rate to the body. The two models predict comparable heating rates on the conical frustum, and the results match in-flight measurement well.

40|$|We {{describe}} herein some immunological {{properties of}} human fetal bone cells recently tested for bone tissueengineering applications. Adult mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and osteoblasts {{were included in}} the study for <b>comparison.</b> <b>Surface</b> markers involved in bone metabolism and immune recognition were analyzed using flow cytometry before and after differentiation or treatment with cytokines. Immunomodulatory properties were studied on activated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). The immuno-profile of fetal bone cells was further investigated at the gene expression level. Fetal bone cells and adult MSCs were positive for Stro- 1, alkaline phosphatase, CD 10, CD 44, CD 54, and b 2 -microglobulin, but human leukocyte antigen (HLA) -I and CD 80 were less present than on adult osteoblasts. All cells were negative for HLA-II. Treatment with recombinant human interferon gamma increased the presence of HLA-I in adult cells much more than in fetal cells. In the presence of activated PBMCs, fetal cells had antiproliferative effects, although with patterns not always comparable with those of adult MSCs and osteoblasts. Because of the immunological profile, and with their more-differentiated phenotype than of stem cells, fetal bone cells present an interesting potential for allogeneic cell source in tissue-engineering applications...|$|E

Two multilayered coatings were studied: a thin TiSiN coating interlayered with thick TiN interlayer and a thick TiSiN coating alternated with thin TiN layers. A monolithic TiSiN coating was also examined for <b>comparison.</b> <b>Surface</b> morphology of the samples {{was found to be}} variable. Both surface roughness and coating hardness increase with the thickness of the outermost TiSiN layer. All samples show columnar structures, and for the multilayer coatings, epitaxial growth of these columnar grains through the TiSiN/TiN multilayers was observed. Stairshaped shear cracks {{can be seen in the}} multilayer coating alternated with thick TiN interlayers, whereas radial and edge cracks are observed in the coating multilayered with thin TiN layers and in the monolithic coating. TEM analysis also suggests that columnar grains help to resist the initiation of edge cracks. Compared to other studies on similar coating systems with fewer periods of interlayers, the deformation observed here appears less severe, indicating an improvement in the strength of the coating through increasing the number of interlayers.

To date, there is limited data in terms of the skin dose for the very small field sizes used in these treatments. In this work, we determine relative surface doses for small size circular collimators as used in stereotactic radiosurgery treatments. Monte Carlo calculations were performed using the BEAMnrc code with a model of the Novalis 15 Trilogy linear accelerator and the BrainLab circular collimators. The surface doses were calculated at the ICRU skin dose depth of 70 m all using the 6 MV SRS x-ray beam.

Methodology/Principal Findings: Observers viewed a virtual room (4 m width 65 m height 617. 5 m depth) with checkerboard walls and floor. In four conditions, the room was presented with or without binocular disparity (BD) depth cues and with or without motion parallax (MP) depth cues. In all conditions, observers were asked to adjust the luminance of a <b>comparison</b> <b>surface</b> to match the lightness of test surfaces placed at seven different depths (8. 5 – 17. 5 m) in the scene.

Adding either MP or BD led to significantly greater discounting and both cues together produced the greatest discounting. The effects of MP and BD were approximately additive.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Models {{of cardiac}} arrhythmogenesis predict that {{non-uniformity}} in repolarization and/or depolarization promotes ventricular fibrillation and is modulated by autonomic tone, {{but this is}} difficult to evaluate in patients. We hypothesize that such spatial heterogeneities would be detected by non-invasive ECG imaging (ECGi) in sudden cardiac death (SCD) survivors with structurally normal hearts under physiological stress. METHODS: ECGi was applied to 11 SCD survivors, 10 low-risk Brugada Syndrome patients (BrS) and 10 controls undergoing exercise treadmill testing. ECGi provides whole heart activation maps and >  1200 unipolar electrograms over the ventricular surface from which global dispersion of activation recovery interval (ARI) and regional delay in conduction were determined. These were used as surrogates for spatial heterogeneities in repolarization and depolarization. Surface ECG markers of dispersion (QT and Tpeak-end intervals) were also calculated for all patients for comparison. RESULTS: Following exertion, the SCD group demonstrated the largest increase in ARI dispersion compared to BrS and control groups (13 ± 8  ms vs 4 ± 7  ms vs 4 ± 5  ms; p =  0. 009), with baseline dispersion being similar in all groups. In <b>comparison,</b> <b>surface</b> ECG markers of dispersion of repolarisation were unable to discriminate between the groups at baseline or following exertion. Spatial heterogeneities in conduction were also present following exercise but {{were not significantly different}} between SCD survivors and the other groups. CONCLUSION: Increased dispersion of repolarization is apparent during physiological stress in SCD survivors and is detectable with ECGi but not with standard ECG parameters. The electrophysiological substrate revealed by ECGi could be the basis of alternative risk-stratification techniques. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved...|$|E
