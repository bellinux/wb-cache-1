40|$|A {{central issue}} for {{understanding}} skilled migration {{in the management}} literature is human capital. This emphasis ignores other important forms of <b>capital</b> <b>mobilization</b> that skilled migrants from developing countries deploy {{in dealing with the}} barriers to their international career mobility. There is therefore a need to develop a holistic understanding of <b>capital</b> <b>mobilization</b> of skilled migrants. In order to develop a more holistic picture, we deploy a relational and multilevel perspective to explore how skilled migrants from developing countries mobilize capital in their efforts to undertake an international career. Career is a central construct in this study. Drawing on a qualitative study of skilled Lebanese in Paris, the paper offers two main contributions to the research on human resource management, in particular to the literatures on skilled migration and self-initiated expatriation. First it extends our understanding of the strategies that skilled migrants use to relocate from a developing country to an industrialized country. Beyond the traditional human capital perspective, it offers insights about migrants' <b>capital</b> <b>mobilization</b> experiences of undertaking international mobility. Second, using Bourdieu's theory of capital, it offers a relational explanation of their <b>capital</b> <b>mobilization</b> in a way to encompass micro-individual, meso-organizational and macro-contextual influences that affect their career choices.

The purpose of this research is to identify the various dimensions of strategic entrepreneurship as well as to identify the dimensions of strategic entrepreneurship of the start-up businesses in Iran. Therefore, the required information was collected by a questionnaire completed by the top Iranian entrepreneurs during 2007 to 2012, and the hypotheses of the research were evaluated by using one-sample test. Based on the results of statistical studies, the factors such as the entrepreneurial mindset, innovation, <b>capitals</b> <b>mobilization,</b> entrepreneurial management and leadership, the simultaneous attention to strategic entrepreneurship, management and growth and finally profitability were confirmed.

40|$|This {{case study}} {{explored}} {{the development of}} a rural cradle-to-career network with a dual focus on the initial mobilization of network members and subsequent adaptations made to maintain mobilization, while meeting local needs. Data sources included interviews with network members, observations of meetings, and documentary evidence. Network-based social <b>capital</b> facilitated <b>mobilization.</b> Where networks were absent and where distrust and different values were evident, mobilization faltered. Three network adaptations were discovered: Special rural community organizing strategies, district-level action planning, and a theory of action focused on out-of-school factors. All three were attributable to the composition of mobilized stakeholders and this network’s rural social geography. These findings illuminate the importance of social geography in the development and advancement of rural cradle-to-career networks...|$|R

In the developed economies, the bond is very important instrument on the capital market, as a possibility for <b>capital</b> <b>mobilization</b> through their issuing by the business entities and as a possibility for investing free financial resources, from the investors’ point of view. The knowledge of the advantages of this kind of security is the basic prerequisite for its increased implementation in the market, as an alternative for realizing profit by the two parties, i. e. the issuer and the investor.

More importantly, as contact objects of occupational interaction hold resources of diverse natures and quantities, they may exert a great impact on individual labor market outcomes, just as is true of the social capital brought by relatives and friends.

40|$|Closed-end {{national}} {{index funds}} (NIFs of country funds) invest {{primarily in the}} stocks of the originating countries, such as Brazil, India, and the Republic of Korea. They are typically traded in the organized exchanges of industrial countries, such as the United States and the United Kingdom. Although NIFs have not raised large amounts of external funds, recently they have expanded rapidly. In a companion paper ("The Pricing of Country Funds and Their Role in <b>Capital</b> <b>Mobilization</b> for Emerging Economies,"WPS 1058), the authors develop a theoretical model to compare the pricing of country funds in the reference markets (say the United States) with the pricing of the underlying component assets (or net asset valuation) in the originating securities market under various assumptions about market structure. In this paper, they empirically investigate the hypotheses that emerge from the model. They first analyze country fund pricing and associated premia, or discounts, and then explore the issue of diversification services provided by NIFs from emerging markets. The emphasis on emerging markets is important as many markets are otherwise closed to foreign investors. They compare results across emerging and industrial markets and, where appropriate, over different subperiods. Their evidence suggests that U. S. investors could benefit significantly in diversification that involves NIFs, particularly funds originating from countries to whose local markets they have limited access. The authors investigate the pricing of NIFs, testing their principal theoretical predictions about the relative significance of the home market, host market, and global closed-end fund factors. They analyze initial (public-offering literature) and after-market returns, and explain the behavior of fund premia/discounts. The evidence shows that variables that proxy the degree of access and substitution effects show up as significant determinants of country fund premia/discounts. The empirical study supports their theory about the welfare implication for emerging economies that originate country funds. The model suggests that country funds can improve pricing efficiency in local capital markets and promote local <b>capital</b> <b>mobilization</b> by firms at more favorable terms (lower costs of capital).

40|$|Poor people, {{especially}} {{poor women}} in Tanzania have very {{limited access to}} financial services. They do not have financial capital. Social capital is also not well organized and utilized. Additionally they have limited ability and skills {{to find ways of}} accessing financial opportunities to meet their plans. Because of that, their economic and developmental projects tend to fail or become indefensible 1. This Project focused, in particular rural women because experience has shown that they are hard working and good planners. But they lack capital and skills because of socio-economic backgrounds. They do not own assets that would have been sources of capital. Moreover, saving from their produce is almost impossible because they produce little. For them to survive economically, they have to opt for funds from other sources. Banks have conditions, very difficult for them to adhere to; in fact they lack potential assets which would have been used as security for loans from the Banks. The remaining option is to fundraise from donors the process which is also cumbersome to them. They have to convince donors. Their level of literacy is very low. Therefore they hardly secure funds from donors. This Project at hand, which took WACOD - Women Organization of Kisarawe District, Tanzania as a case study has explored alternative means of mobilizing social and monetary capital from within the community itself. It has been found that, sustainability of rural development groups does not necessarily depend on financial resources. Secondly, locally available means of mobilizing capital, if utilized effectively shall sustain economic development projects in rural areas. Some of the alternative <b>capital</b> <b>mobilization</b> strategies explored are Harambee, Upatu, Umoja and Kopa na Lipa Traditional Schemes.

That is why financial innovation is treated as a prime catalyst for financial development (Laeven et al. 2015). As with other innovations, financial innovation is a continuous process of bringing about changes in the financial system through the improvement and diversification of financial products and processes (Sood and Ranjan 2015).

This work examines the specific effects of globaliza-tion on soccer in its three major components: mobilization of <b>capital,</b> <b>mobilization</b> of labor, and cultural flows. It appears that, because of the transformation of major aspects of society, Israeli soccer has been globalized on all three components. However, this globalization was uneven, and was determined by the specific local conditions that worked more in favor of labor and cultural flows. Key words • globalization • Israel • liberalization • nationalism • soccer Globalization has become a part of our everyday lives, affecting, although in different ways and on different levels, each major aspect of social reality (Archer, 1990). The connection between sport and globalization deserves attention because sport is central enough to not merely reflect aspects of globalization, but to impact our very use of the term “globalization ” (Miller et al., 2001 : 1). The vast literature that deals with the globalization of sport and, in particular, of soccer, is indicative of the growing interest in the interweaving of sport and globalization (e. g.

40|$|Existing sociological {{theories}} highlight five {{explanations of}} development, which focus on leftist {{political parties in}} state power, women’s office-holding, state capacity, social <b>capital</b> and resource <b>mobilization,</b> and state expenditure. Increasingly, however, the execution of development schemes by large democratic states of the global South relies on citizen partic-ipation in what I define as Redistributive Direct Democracy (RDD). RDD institutions devolve formal authorities and create political opportunities for participants to themselves allocate and claim development benefits. Within India’s approximately two million local govern-ments, a permanent RDD institution called the gram sabha offers all participants the formal, constitutional authority to directly select recipients of state benefits such as public housing and latrines. Drawing on fixed-effects, multivariate OLS analyses of data collected in a strat-ified random sample of 72 Indian local governments with active gram sabhas, I argue for a sixth, complementary explanation of development in democracies of the global South: women’s participation in RDD. My analysis demonstrates strongly positive and highly signif-icant effects of women’s gram sabha participation on local development and a contrasting absence of support for longstanding explanations. These findings suggest that women’s par-ticipation in RDD can make these new and popular, but poorly understood institutions matter for development outcomes...|$|R

Transformation of China’s Mega Cities 1 Existing {{studies of}} the growth of Chinese cities and the {{escalation}} of local debts have been done in separation. This research examines the growth and transformation of Chinese cities in relation to the practice of hosting mega-events as a means of <b>capital</b> <b>mobilization</b> and the expansion of local debts. An investigation of Guangzhou, the host city of the 2010 Asian Games, has identified an interesting trajectory in which hosting mega-events has been actively pursued as a strategy of capital accumulation to stimulate infrastructure-driven urbanization. The municipal government has managed to mobile resources from commercial banks to finance infrastructure projects and foster urban spatial restructuring through the establishment of a series of local government financing platforms (LGFPs). Because land was used as the principle assets injecting into LGPFs and as collateral to obtain bank loans, the revenue generated from land sales has been of great significance to support LGPFs. However, the uncertainty of the real estate market has made land revenue volatile, and contributed to huge local debts. Findings of this research cast doubt over the long-term sustainability of China's event-driven urbanization and further advance theoretical understanding of the diverse trajectories of urban growth in the era of global urbanism...|$|E
40|$|This paper aims at {{explaining}} {{the dynamics of}} welfare capitalism in Japan. As opposed to previous studies, it emphasizes the role of fiscal system by raising {{the question of how}} savings encouragement combined with low taxation affected the welfare dynamics. During the industrialization period, the Japanese government mobilized private savings as if it were public money. This <b>capital</b> <b>mobilization</b> strategy made the features of the Japanese welfare system exceedingly different from those of western countries, both by making it possible for the government to maintain the small tax state and by enabling households to actively utilize savings assets as a welfare measure. This distinctive institutional setting had an enormous effect on welfare dynamics after the oil shocks of the 1970 s by making it difficult for the government to introduce the new consumption tax and by increasing the importance of assetbased welfare. With the emphasis on fiscal system, this paper contributes to the development of comparative welfare capitalism studies which have explored the possible linkage of welfare and capitalism.

Much of the focus of the strategy will be {{on the development of the}} legal and regulatory environment needed to support efficiently functioning financial markets and institutions. ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{relationship}} between economic growth and financial development in China during the post- 1978 reform period. Recent studies, based on cross-country data, have found a positive association between these two variables. We find that while {{a positive correlation between}} growth and financial intermediation exists in China, the association is more apparent than real. The nonstate sector, which contributed most to China''s remarkable growth during this period, did not use the domestic financial system in any substantial way for financing. The same appears to be true for the faster-growing provinces. Compared to foreign investment, domestic private credit played a relatively small, although statistically significant, role in financing the nonstate sector and fast-growing provinces.

40|$|AIDS affects all {{facets of}} people’s {{livelihoods}} through illness, death and the subsequent care of orphaned children. While AIDS has negative impacts on the livelihoods of many households, not all affected households experience a loss of livelihood security. Several factors condition people’s {{ability to respond to}} AIDS impacts. This paper explores the concept of resilience in the context of AIDS-related adversity and suffering. In the paper resilience is seen as the responses that enable households to persist or adapt to the difficul-ties caused by AIDS. Using case material from Northern Zambia, specific attention will be paid to resource mobilisation and factors that enable resilience. Also, the paper examines some of the methodological implications relating to research on resilience. [resilience, AIDS, social <b>capital,</b> gender, resource <b>mobilization,</b> Zambia] Since the first case was reported in 1981, over 25 million people have died of AIDS. Sub-Saharan Africa is the epicentre of the global epidemic with almost 68 % of all people living with HIV. Presently, women constitute 61 % of infected adults in sub-Saharan Africa and in almost every country, prevalence rates for women are higher than for men, especially among young women (UNAIDS 2007). Underpinning these sex-based differences in prevalence rates are profound gender-based differences in power, social attitudes and vulnerability (Commonwealth Secretariat 2002). Since the 1990 s, several studies have examined the socio-economic impacts of AIDS on rural livelihoods and household food security using qualitative and quantitative approache...|$|R
