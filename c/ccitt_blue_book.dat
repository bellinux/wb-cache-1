40|$|There are differing {{opinions}} as to {{what constitutes}} an acceptable minimal amount of traffic data from which to determine reference traffic. This question is examined {{in the context of}} the South African PSTN and with three different reference traffic models. 1. INTRODUCTION In practice many different methods are employed by telecommunications network providers for determining a reference traffic base from traffic measurements within their networks. For example, recommendations are given in the <b>CCITT</b> <b>blue</b> <b>book</b> fascicle II. 3 Rec E 500 for standard processes for determining a reference traffic base. The standards specify the periods of a day during which measurements should be recorded, the number of days over which records should be kept and the computational processes for computing the reference traffics. Such data is essential for network planning and dimensioning. Fixed daily measurement periods require less measurements resources than continuous 24 hour measurements but if significant [...] ...|$|E

40|$|The <b>Blue</b> <b>Book</b> is a “General Explanation” of tax law {{prepared}} by the Joint Committee on Taxation, and is commonly relied upon by both taxpayers and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). In United States v. Woods, the U. S. Supreme Court broadly disapproved of judicial deference to the <b>Blue</b> <b>Book</b> when courts are faced with such reliance. Yet, the Court left no guidance on when the <b>Blue</b> <b>Book</b> {{should or should not}} prove persuasive. The Court’s decision to summarily undermine <b>Blue</b> <b>Book</b> deference—without further elaboration, sophistication, or nuance—will give taxpayers pause when considering whether to rely on the <b>Blue</b> <b>Book.</b> However, the need for pause is unfortunate; the Treasury Department lists the <b>Blue</b> <b>Book</b> as a substantial authority on which taxpayers may rely to avoid certain tax penalties. Moreover, <b>Blue</b> <b>Book</b> reliance is appropriate in various other contexts as a means of statutory interpretation. Nonetheless, the Court has, with a broad stroke, come down against the <b>Blue</b> <b>Book</b> without considering that a given case’s facts and circumstances determine the <b>Blue</b> <b>Book’s</b> interpretive weight...|$|R

The title was {{shortened}} with the February 1952 issue to simply Bluebook, continuing until May 1956. With a more exploitative angle, the magazine was revived with an October 1960 issue as Bluebook for Men, and the title again became Bluebook for the final run from 1967 to 1975.|$|R
25|$|In 1960, {{there were}} U.S. Congressional {{hearings}} regarding UFOs. Civilian UFO research group NICAP had publicly charged <b>Blue</b> <b>Book</b> with covering up UFO evidence, and had also acquired a few {{allies in the}} U.S. Congress. <b>Blue</b> <b>Book</b> was investigated by the Congress and the CIA, with critics—most notably the civilian UFO group NICAP asserting that <b>Blue</b> <b>Book</b> was lacking as a scientific study. In response, ATIC added personnel (increasing the total personnel to three military personnel, plus civilian secretaries) and increased <b>Blue</b> <b>Book's</b> budget. This seemed to mollify some of <b>Blue</b> <b>Book's</b> critics, that {{but it was only}} temporary. A few years later (see below), the criticism would be even louder.|$|R

UFO researcher Jerome Clark writes, [...] "Most observers of <b>Blue</b> <b>Book</b> agree that the Ruppelt years comprised the project's golden age, when investigations were most capably directed and conducted. Ruppelt himself was open-minded about UFOs, and his investigators were not known, as Grudge's were, for force-fitting explanations on cases." ...|$|R
50|$|He headed Project <b>Blue</b> <b>Book</b> from 1963 {{until its}} closure in 1970. Project <b>Blue</b> <b>Book</b> {{was started in}} 1952. The USAF {{announced}} Project <b>Blue</b> <b>Book's</b> closing on December 17, 1969 and officially closed it on January 30, 1970. He succeeded Lt. Col. Robert Friend. He was selected {{to be the next}} Project <b>Blue</b> <b>Book</b> Officer by Colonel Eric T. de Jonckheere, who explained to Quintanilla that he was looking to fill the position with a man with a degree in physics, with maturity, drive, and a man who was cool under pressure. Quintanilla shook his head and felt he only met the degree requirement. Col. Joncheere told Quintanilla to take the job for a few weeks and report to him. Quintanilla felt he was offered the job due to his reluctance to take several other job offers in the escalating Vietnam War. Project <b>Blue</b> <b>Book</b> left a legacy of over 12,000 reported UFO's investigated of which 30 percent or over 4,000 cases, were classified as unknown causes.|$|R
5000|$|In the 1920s, <b>Blue</b> <b>Books</b> {{roster of}} authors {{included}} {{two of the}} world's most famous writers of popular fiction: Edgar Rice Burroughs and Agatha Christie.

The characters of Sax Rohmer, James Oliver Curwood, and Zane Grey appeared in <b>Blue</b> <b>Book.</b> Adventure fiction was a staple of Blue Book; in addition to Burroughs, P. C. Wren, H.

Chester (with his Burroughs-influenced [...] "Hawk of the Wilderness", about a white boy adopted by Native Americans) all published in the magazine.

25|$|<b>Blue</b> <b>Book's</b> {{explanations}} of UFO reports were not universally accepted, however, and critics — including some scientists — suggested that Project <b>Blue</b> <b>Book</b> performed questionable research or, worse, was perpetrating cover up.

2500|$|UFO {{investigators}} often regard Ruppelt's brief {{tenure at}} <b>Blue</b> <b>Book</b> as the high-water mark of public Air Force investigations of UFOs, when UFO investigations were treated seriously and had support at high levels. Thereafter, Project <b>Blue</b> <b>Book</b> descended {{into a new}} [...] "Dark Ages" [...] from which many UFO investigators argue it never emerged. However, Ruppelt later came to embrace the <b>Blue</b> <b>Book</b> perspective {{that there was nothing}} extraordinary about UFOs; he even labeled the subject a [...] "Space Age Myth." ...|$|R

2500|$|In {{response}} to the Condon Committee's conclusions, Secretary of the Air Force Robert C.

[...] The last publicly acknowledged day of <b>Blue</b> <b>Book</b> operations was December 17, 1969. However, researcher Brad Sparks, citing research from the May, 1970 issue of NICAP's UFO Investigator, reports that the last day of <b>Blue</b> <b>Book</b> activity was actually January 30, 1970. According to Sparks, Air Force officials wanted to keep the Air Force's reaction to the UFO problem from overlapping into a fourth decade, and thus altered the date of <b>Blue</b> <b>Book's</b> closure in official files.|$|R
