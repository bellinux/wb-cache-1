5|$|On March 18, 1954 Sauk-Prairie Star editor Leroy Gore of Sauk City, Wisconsin {{urged the}} recall of McCarthy in a front-page {{editorial}} that ran alongside a sample petition that readers <b>could</b> <b>fill</b> out and mail to the newspaper. A Republican and former McCarthy supporter, Gore cited the senator with subverting President Eisenhower's authority, disrespecting Wisconsin's-own Gen. Ralph Wise Zwicker and ignoring the plight of Wisconsin dairy farmers faced with price-slashing surpluses.|$|E
5|$|As I {{was reading}} about Cope and Marsh, I ran across Knight as {{something}} of a bit player in their lives. As I got further into the Cope and Marsh story, and I liked the two less and less as people—which is different from liking them as characters, of course—I wanted to have a character in the book for the readers to root for, and neither of the scientists <b>could</b> <b>fill</b> that role. When I found out that Knight had met Cope just before Cope died, I became convinced that he was the character I needed.|$|E
5|$|Between 1959 and 1962, Balabushka {{handcrafted}} between 20 and 30 cues {{per year}} on a part-time basis. Because of the relative dearth of private cuemakers and the excellence of his product, Balabushka's name quickly became known amongst professional players. By the end of 1962, Balabushka was receiving more orders for cues than he <b>could</b> <b>fill</b> given his time constraints. Balabushka accordingly sold {{his interest in the}} pool room, converted his garage into a carpentry shop, and by 1964 was building cues full-time, while continuing to hone his cuemaking abilities.|$|E

5|$|During the 1970s, UK and France were {{developing}} a new aircraft which <b>could</b> <b>fill</b> the RAF tactical strike and reconnaissance missions: the SEPECAT Jaguar was introduced into service in 1974, {{and led to a}} re-think of the Phantom's role as, at the same time, the limitations of the Lightning as an interceptor were becoming more apparent. The conversion of the RAF's FGR.2 squadrons to operate the Jaguar, combined with its use of the Blackburn Buccaneer, meant {{that it was possible to}} begin transferring Phantoms to operate purely as interceptors in the air defence role.|$|E
5|$|But the Cobra was a quickly made {{helicopter}} {{based on}} the UH-1 Iroquois, and in the late 1960s the U.S. Army was designing the Lockheed AH-56 Cheyenne, a much more capable attack aircraft with greater speed. These developments worried the U.S. Air Force, which saw the anti-tank helicopter overtaking its nuclear-armed tactical aircraft as the primary anti-armor force in Europe. A 1966 U.S. Air Force study of existing close air support (CAS) capabilities revealed gaps in the escort and fire suppression roles, which the Cheyenne <b>could</b> <b>fill.</b> The study concluded that the service should acquire a simple, inexpensive, dedicated CAS aircraft at least as capable as the A-1, and that it should develop doctrine, tactics, and procedures for such aircraft to accomplish the missions for which the attack helicopters were provided.|$|E
5|$|In contrast, Roman {{expansion}} into Spain and Gaul occurred as {{a mix of}} alliance-seeking and military occupation. In the 2nd century BC, Roman involvement in the Greek east remained a matter of alliance-seeking, but {{this time in the}} face of major powers that could rival Rome. According to Polybius, who sought to trace how Rome came to dominate the Greek east in less than a century, this was mainly a matter of several Greek city-states seeking Roman protection against the Macedonian kingdom and Seleucid Empire in the face of destabilisation created by the weakening of Ptolemaic Egypt. In contrast to the west, the Greek east had been dominated by major empires for centuries, and Roman influence and alliance-seeking led to wars with these empires that further weakened them and therefore created an unstable power vacuum that only Rome <b>could</b> <b>fill.</b> This had some important similarities to (and important differences from) the events in Italy centuries earlier, but this time on a global scale.|$|E

25|$|The {{selection}} of the F-104A for the ADC was sort of curious, since {{it had not been}} originally designed as an interceptor and it lacked an adequate endurance and had no all-weather capability. However, its high climb rate made it attractive to the ADC and it was hoped that the Starfighter <b>could</b> <b>fill</b> in until the F-106 became available.|$|E
25|$|The Middle Ages {{brought a}} harsh {{interpretation}} of dreams. They {{were seen as}} evil, and the images as temptations from the devil.

Martin Luther, founder of Protestantism, believed dreams were {{the work of the}} Devil. However, Catholics such as St. Augustine and St. Jerome claimed that the direction of their lives was heavily influenced by their dreams.|$|E

25|$|Rosselló {{was able}} to gain {{a seat in the}} Senate of Puerto Rico when Victor Loubriel, an elected first-time {{district}} senator representing Arecibo, decided to resign his seat two days after being sworn in. The senator's resignation gave the New Progressive Party a seat it <b>could</b> <b>fill,</b> so Rosselló announced his intentions of filling the vacancy and was selected to the post through an internal party procedure. Rosselló officially assumed duties as a Senator of Puerto Rico on February 13, 2005.|$|E
25|$|Holbein had deftly {{survived the}} {{downfall}} of his first two great patrons, Thomas More and Anne Boleyn, but Cromwell's sudden arrest and execution on trumped-up charges of heresy and treason in 1540 undoubtedly damaged his career. Though Holbein retained his position as King's Painter, Cromwell's death left a gap no other patron <b>could</b> <b>fill.</b> It was, ironically, Holbein's portrait of Anne of Cleves which largely led to Cromwell's downfall: furious at being saddled with a wife he found entirely unattractive, the King directed all his anger at Cromwell, whereas {{there is no evidence}} that he blamed Holbein for supposedly flattering Anne's looks.|$|E
25|$|After {{a couple}} of years, his skill began {{attracting}} other musicians. One such musician was Guy Lombardo, who would remain friends with Martin throughout his life. After graduation from high school, Martin accepted {{a job at the}} H.N. White musical instrument company. When Lombardo was playing in Cleveland, Martin tried giving Lombardo some saxophones, which proved unsuccessful. Fortunately, Lombardo did get to hear Martin's band. One night, when Guy could not do a certain date, he suggested that Martin's band <b>could</b> <b>fill</b> in for him. The band did very well and that's how Martin's career really got started. But the band broke up and he did not form a permanent band until 1931 at the Bossert Hotel in Brooklyn.|$|E

25|$|Author Mark Edwards {{contests}} {{the conventional}} view {{that in the}} wake of the Scopes trial, a humiliated fundamentalism retreated into the political and cultural background, a viewpoint evidenced in the film Inherit the Wind (1960) and the majority of contemporary historical accounts. Rather, the cause of fundamentalism's retreat was the death of its leader, Bryan. Most fundamentalists saw the trial as a victory and not a defeat, but Bryan's death soon after created a leadership void that no other fundamentalist leader <b>could</b> <b>fill.</b> Bryan, unlike the other leaders, brought name recognition, respectability, and the ability to forge a broad-based coalition of fundamentalist and mainline religious groups to argue for the anti-evolutionist position.|$|E
25|$|When told by Nick Chance of Cafiero's {{decision}} not to go, booking agent Gerrard suggested drummer Cathy Green, who was based in Canberra. Gerrard knew Green was {{a huge fan of}} X, and thus knew the songs, and was a great drummer in her own right who <b>could</b> <b>fill</b> in to save the Melbourne tour. Luckily Cathy agreed to do it, on a few days' notice. There were two hastily organised rehearsals prior to the Melbourne shows, {{which turned out to be}} a huge success. Cathy brought a new fresh yet solid feel to the band. Tragically, not long after that, Cafiero died when injected with a dye prior to an X-ray for a back complaint and Cathy became a permanent final member of X.|$|E
25|$|Around {{that time}} the Tappan Zee Bridge was built and opened to traffic. One of its piers, with {{its own set of}} navigational lights, sat on the shoals which the {{lighthouse}} had been designed to warn against, channeling shipping away from them. The Coast Guard responded by automating the light and reducing the flashing red lantern from 7000candlepower to 1500 in 1957. The need for the lighthouse was further reduced two years later when the federal government declared all but the hundred feet (30 m) of river bottom around the lighthouse to be surplus property, so that General Motors (GM) <b>could</b> <b>fill</b> in the area between it and the shore in order to expand its Tarrytown Truck Assembly plant, a facility that incorporated the original Stanley Steamer factory built east of the railroad tracks in 1896. Two years later, in 1961, the light was decommissioned.|$|E

25|$|The Spaniards found a solidly-built well {{used by the}} Indians {{to provide}} {{themselves}} with fresh water and they <b>could</b> <b>fill</b> their casks and jugs. The Indians, again with friendly aspect and manner, brought them to their village, where once more they could see solid constructions and many idols (Bernal alludes to the painted figures of serpents on the walls, so characteristic of Mesoamerica). They also met their first priests, with their white tunics and their long hair impregnated with human blood; this {{was the end of}} the Indians' friendly conduct: they convoked a great number of warriors and ordered them to burn some dry reeds, indicating to the Spaniards that if they weren't gone before the fire went out, they would be attacked. Hernández's men decided to retreat to the boats with their casks and jugs of water before the Indians could attack them, leaving safely behind them the discovery of Campeche.|$|E
25|$|On 13 August 2016, Hart {{was dropped}} by new manager Pep Guardiola {{for the first}} match of the 2016–17 Premier League season. The absence {{followed}} his poor performances in Euro 2016, and Guardiola's desire for a player with better footwork who <b>could</b> <b>fill</b> a sweeper-keeper role. Hart made his first start of the 2016–17 season in a Champions League qualifying match against Steaua Bucharest, as captain of the City side that won 1–0 on the night, 6–0 on aggregate. Following the match, Hart was applauded by the crowd, in an atmosphere which was described as resembling a pre-departure testimonial. Following speculation linking Hart with various top European clubs, including Arsenal, Borussia Dortmund, Everton, Liverpool, Milan and Sevilla, Hart surprisingly decided to pursue a season-long loan in the Serie A with Torino. In doing so, {{he became the first}} English goalkeeper to sign for a Serie A club since the league's inception in 1929.|$|E
25|$|The {{constitutional}} {{powers of}} the President of the Confederate States of America {{were similar to those}} of the President of the United States of America. The permanent Confederate States Constitution made him commander-in-chief of the Army and Navy, and of the militia of the confederated states when called into service of the Confederate States. He was also empowered to grant reprieves and pardons for offenses against the Confederate States. He was authorized to make treaties; to nominate and appoint diplomatic representatives, judges, and other officers of the Confederate States (including the heads of the executive departments) by and with the consent of the Confederate States Senate; and to remove such representatives and officers. He <b>could</b> <b>fill</b> vacancies during a recess of the Senate, but he could not reappoint, during a recess, persons previously rejected by it. He was to supply Congress with information, recommend legislation, receive ambassadors and other public ministers, see that the federal laws were faithfully executed, and commission all officers of the military and naval forces of the Confederate States.|$|E
