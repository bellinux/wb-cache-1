5|$|In the 1944 {{legislative}} session, {{the rival}} parties fought to a stalemate over the budget.

Two months {{after the end of}} the session, Willis called a special session to reconcile the educational items in the budget. Once in session, legislators approved a full budget. The vote to accept the budget was deemed invalid, however, because approving a full budget was not part of Willis's initial <b>call</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> special session. In response, Willis called a second special session, and the Assembly passed a full budget on June 16, 1944.|$|E

5|$|This {{position}} was contested by Andrés Nin {{and some other}} members of the League who did not support the <b>call</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> new International.

5|$|A {{supporter}} of the evangelical wing of the Church of England, Wilberforce believed that the revitalisation of the Church and individual Christian observance {{would lead to a}} harmonious, moral society. He sought to elevate the status of religion in public and private life, making piety fashionable in both the upper- and middle-classes of society. To this end, in April 1797, Wilberforce published , on which he had been working since 1793. This was an exposition of New Testament doctrine and teachings and a <b>call</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> revival of Christianity, {{as a response to the}} moral decline of the nation, illustrating his own personal testimony and the views which inspired him.
