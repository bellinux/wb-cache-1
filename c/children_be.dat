He told the court that his parents {{suggested}} to Sheila that evening that the boys be placed in day-time foster care with a local family. Bamber said Sheila did not seem bothered by the suggestion and had simply said she would rather stay in London. The boys had been in foster care before, although in London rather than near White House Farm, and it had not appeared to cause a problem for Sheila. Her psychiatrist, Dr. Ferguson, told the Court of Appeal in 2002 that any suggestion that the <b>children</b> <b>be</b> removed from her care would have provoked a strong reaction from Sheila, but that she might have welcomed daytime help.|$|E
5|$|Polio {{vaccines}} are vaccines used {{to prevent}} poliomyelitis (polio). There are two types: one that uses inactivated poliovirus and is given by injection (IPV), and one that uses weakened poliovirus and is given by mouth (OPV). The World Health Organization recommends all <b>children</b> <b>be</b> fully vaccinated against polio. The two vaccines have eliminated polio {{from most of the}} world, and reduced the number of cases reported each year from an estimated 350,000 in 1988 to 37 in 2016.|$|E

5|$|At {{the end of}} {{the second}} day, the Seimas adopted a four-{{paragraph}} resolution. The first paragraph declared that the Tsarist government was Lithuania's most dangerous enemy. The second paragraph demanded autonomy; the third outlined the means towards this goal that were deemed acceptable. The resistance was to be peaceful and passive. The fourth and final paragraph demanded that <b>children</b> <b>be</b> taught in their native language by teachers chosen by the people. The Seimas, unlike the 1917 Vilnius Conference, did not attempt to elect an institution that could carry out these resolutions and act as a Lithuanian government. After the Seimas, rural areas were left on their own without central guidance. After the resolution was adopted by the Seimas, near midnight, Jonas Basanavičius read aloud his proposal to include an attachment condemning Polish ecclesiastical authorities for suppressing the use of the Lithuanian language in churches within the diocese of Vilnius. The church matters had not been discussed during the sessions, but the majority agreed to the proposal by a show of hands. Because the attachment was not fully discussed, Social Democrats did not consider it officially adopted.|$|E
5|$|During the 1840s, {{students}} in Philadelphia schools began {{the day with}} reading the Protestant version of the Bible. On November 10, 1842, Philadelphia's Roman Catholic Bishop, Francis Kenrick, {{wrote a letter to}} the Board of Controllers of public schools, asking that Catholic <b>children</b> <b>be</b> allowed to read the Douay version of the Bible, used by Roman Catholics. He also asked that they be excused from other religious teaching while at school. As a result, the Board of Controllers ordered that no child should be forced to participate in religious activities and stated that children were allowed to read whichever version of the Bible their parents wished. Nativists further inflamed hostile feelings towards Catholics by reportedly twisting Kenrick's requests to the Board of Controllers as an attack against the Bible used in Protestant devotionals.|$|E

25|$|In 1908, {{the papal}} decree Ne Temere came into effect which {{complicated}} mixed marriages. Marriages not {{performed by a}} Roman Catholic priest were declared legal but sacramentally invalid, worrying some Protestants that the Church would counsel separation for couples married in a Protestant church or by civil service. Priests were given discretion to refuse to perform mixed marriages or lay conditions upon them, commonly including a requirement that the <b>children</b> <b>be</b> raised Roman Catholic. The decree proved particularly divisive in Ireland, which has a large Protestant minority, contributing indirectly to the subsequent political conflict there and requiring debates in the House of Commons of the United Kingdom.|$|E
25|$|While the act {{of passing}} flatus in said {{cultures}} is {{generally considered to be}} an unfortunate occurrence in public settings, flatulence may, in casual circumstances and especially among <b>children,</b> <b>be</b> used as either a humorous supplement to a joke ("pull my finger"), or as a comic activity in and of itself. The social acceptability of flatulence-based humour in entertainment and the mass media varies over the course of time and between cultures. Enough entertainers performed with their flatus that the term flatulist was coined. The whoopee cushion is a joking device invented in the early 20th century for simulating a fart. In 2008, a farting application for the iPhone earned nearly $10,000 in one day.|$|E
25|$|It is {{a custom}} {{in the region}} of Banat that, after Christmas Eve dinner, groups of {{children}} go from house to house of their neighborhood and sing to neighbors. This custom is called korinđanje, and the children who participate in it are called korinđaši. They knock on a neighbor's door or ring the doorbell; when the neighbor comes out they greet him, and ask if they are allowed to sing. If the answer is affirmative, they sing a children's ditty or the Troparion of the Nativity. As a reward, the neighbor gives them candies or even money; more traditional gifts include walnuts, prunes, apples, and cakes. Not only can Serbian <b>children</b> <b>be</b> korinđaši, but also Romanian and Hungarian ones.|$|E

James preferred to associate himself with Protestant people, such as John Churchill, whose wife later became a very close friend of Anne's youngest surviving daughter Lady Anne. King Charles at the time opposed Catholicism and insisted that James' <b>children</b> <b>be</b> raised in the Anglican faith, although he converted to Catholicism on his deathbed.

500|$|Before {{the episode}} aired, the CTW {{conducted}} {{a series of}} studies to guide the writers and producers in creating the episode. [...] Their goal was to answer four key questions: (1) Will children understand the messages they wanted to convey about death? (2) How attentive will they be to the storyline? (3) How will parents respond to the treatment of such a sensitive topic? and (4) Will <b>children</b> <b>be</b> disturbed by the messages, and if so, for how long? [...] The researchers broke up children into three groups: children who only watched the scenes in which the storyline was played out and who were interviewed afterwards; children who watched the entire episode and whose attention was recorded while they viewed it; and children who watched the episode without the inserts, with their parents, who were interviewed 9 or 10 days later.|$|E
