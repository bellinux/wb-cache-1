5|$|A Chi-Chi's Mexican {{restaurant}} was constructed {{on the corner}} of 3rd Avenue and 10th Street in 1991. These developments were mostly suburban in nature and was not <b>conductive</b> to improvements in downtown Huntington. A Holiday Inn was constructed adjacent to the Big Sandy Superstore Arena between 8th and 9th Street in 1998.|$|E
5|$|As an {{electrically}} <b>conductive</b> liquid, it {{was used}} in mercury switches (including home mercury light switches installed prior to 1970), tilt switches used in old fire detectors, and tilt switches in some home thermostats.|$|E
5|$|Causes of <b>conductive</b> {{hearing loss}} include an ear canal blocked by ear wax, {{ossicles}} that are fixed together or absent, or {{holes in the}} eardrum. <b>Conductive</b> hearing loss may also result from middle ear inflammation causing fluid build-up in the normally air-filled space, such as by otitis media. Tympanoplasty is the general name of the operation to repair the middle ear's eardrum and ossicles. Grafts from muscle fascia are ordinarily used to rebuild an intact eardrum. Sometimes artificial ear bones are placed to substitute for damaged ones, or a disrupted ossicular chain is rebuilt in order to conduct sound effectively.|$|E
5|$|Hearing aids or {{cochlear}} implants {{may be used}} if {{the hearing}} loss is severe or prolonged. Hearing aids work by amplifying {{the sound of the}} local environment and are best suited to <b>conductive</b> hearing loss. Cochlear implants transmit the sound that is heard {{as if it were a}} nervous signal, bypassing the cochlea.|$|E
5|$|In {{vascular}} plants, the xylem and phloem are the <b>conductive</b> tissues that transport resources between shoots and roots. Roots {{are often}} adapted to store food such as sugars or starch, as in sugar beets and carrots.|$|E
5|$|Indium(III) oxide and indium {{tin oxide}} (ITO) are used as a {{transparent}} <b>conductive</b> coating on glass substrates in electroluminescent panels. Indium tin oxide {{is used as a}} light filter in low-pressure sodium-vapor lamps. The infrared radiation is reflected back into the lamp, which increases the temperature within the tube and improves the performance of the lamp.|$|E
5|$|Ionic {{compounds}} {{typically have}} high melting and boiling points, and are hard and brittle. As solids {{they are almost}} always electrically insulating, but when melted or dissolved they become highly <b>conductive,</b> because the ions are mobilized.|$|E
5|$|Nanosilver {{particles}}, between 10 and 100nanometres in size, {{are used}} in many applications. They {{are used in}} <b>conductive</b> inks for printed electronics, and have a much lower melting point than larger silver particles of micrometre size. They are also used medicinally in antibacterials and antifungals {{in much the same}} way as larger silver particles.|$|E
5|$|There {{are four}} main {{mechanisms}} for cooling {{the air to}} its dew point: adiabatic cooling, <b>conductive</b> cooling, radiational cooling, and evaporative cooling. Adiabatic cooling occurs when air rises and expands. The air can rise due to convection, large-scale atmospheric motions, or a physical barrier such as a mountain (orographic lift). <b>Conductive</b> cooling occurs when the air comes into contact with a colder surface, usually by being blown from one surface to another, for example from a liquid water surface to colder land. Radiational cooling occurs due to the emission of infrared radiation, either by the air or by the surface underneath. Evaporative cooling occurs when moisture {{is added to the}} air through evaporation, which forces the air temperature to cool to its wet-bulb temperature, or until it reaches saturation.|$|E
5|$|This {{increase}} in permeability primarily affects transport of ions and other hydrated species, {{indicating that the}} mechanism {{is the creation of}} nm-scale water-filled holes in the membrane. Although electroporation and dielectric breakdown both result from application of an electric field, the mechanisms involved are fundamentally different. In dielectric breakdown the barrier material is ionized, creating a <b>conductive</b> pathway. The material alteration is thus chemical in nature. In contrast, during electroporation the lipid molecules are not chemically altered but simply shift position, opening up a pore that acts as the <b>conductive</b> pathway through the bilayer as it is filled with water.|$|E
5|$|Hearing loss may {{be either}} partial or total. This {{may be a}} result of injury or damage, {{congenital}} disease, or physiological causes. When hearing loss is a result of injury or damage to the outer ear or middle ear, it is known as <b>conductive</b> hearing loss. When deafness is a result of injury or damage to the inner ear, vestibulochoclear nerve, or brain, it is known as sensorineural hearing loss.|$|E
5|$|Indium {{is a minor}} {{component}} in zinc sulfide ores and is produced as a byproduct of zinc refinement. It is most notably used in the semiconductor industry, in low-melting-point metal alloys such as solders, in soft-metal high-vacuum seals, and {{in the production of}} transparent <b>conductive</b> coatings of indium tin oxide (ITO) on glass. Indium has no biological role, though its compounds are somewhat toxic when injected into the bloodstream. Most occupational exposure is through ingestion, from which indium compounds are not absorbed well, and inhalation, from which they are moderately absorbed.|$|E
5|$|Most {{materials}} with high thermal conductivity are also electrically <b>conductive,</b> such as metals. In contrast, pure synthetic diamond has high thermal conductivity, but negligible electrical conductivity. This combination is invaluable for electronics where diamond {{is used as}} a heat sink for high-power laser diodes, laser arrays and high-power transistors. Efficient heat dissipation prolongs the lifetime of those electronic devices, and the devices' high replacement costs justify the use of efficient, though relatively expensive, diamond heat sinks. In semiconductor technology, synthetic diamond heat spreaders prevent silicon and other semiconducting materials from overheating.|$|E
5|$|Outside of the {{seasonal}} variations, the geothermal gradient of temperatures through the crust is 25–30°C (77–86°F) per kilometer of depth {{in most of}} the world. The <b>conductive</b> heat flux averages 0.1MW/km2. These values are much higher near tectonic plate boundaries where the crust is thinner. They may be further augmented by fluid circulation, either through magma conduits, hot springs, hydrothermal circulation or a combination of these.|$|E
5|$|Plasma is a {{state of}} matter in which an ionised gaseous {{substance}} becomes highly electrically <b>conductive</b> to the point that long-range electric and magnetic fields dominate the behavior of the matter. This state can be contrasted with the other states: solid, liquid, and gas. Unlike these other states of matter, plasma mostly does not naturally exist on the Earth's surface under normal conditions, and must be artificially generated from neutral gases.|$|E
5|$|The Galileo orbiter {{found that}} Europa has a weak {{magnetic}} moment, which is {{induced by the}} varying part of the Jovian magnetic field. The field strength at the magnetic equator (about 120 nT) created by this magnetic moment is about one-sixth the strength of Ganymede's field and six times the value of Callisto's. The existence of the induced moment requires a layer of a highly electrically <b>conductive</b> material in Europa's interior. The most plausible candidate for this role is a large subsurface ocean of liquid saltwater.|$|E
5|$|The crystalline-solid {{structure}} of the salts act more as an insulator than a conductor. However, once the salts are dissolved into a solution by a source of moisture (e.g., fog, mist, light rain, etc.), the ash may become corrosive and electrically <b>conductive.</b> A recent study {{has shown that the}} electrical conductivity of volcanic ash increases with (1) increasing moisture content, (2) increasing soluble salt content, and (3) increasing compaction (bulk density). The ability of volcanic ash to conduct electric current has significant implications for electric power supply systems.|$|E
5|$|The largest {{consumer}} of tellurium is metallurgy in iron, stainless steel, copper, and lead alloys. The addition to steel and copper produces an alloy more machinable than otherwise. It is alloyed into cast iron for promoting chill for spectroscopy, where {{the presence of}} electrically <b>conductive</b> free graphite tends to interfere with spark emission testing results. In lead, tellurium improves strength and durability, and decreases the corrosive action of sulfuric acid.|$|E
5|$|When {{dispersed}} on <b>conductive</b> materials, palladium is {{an excellent}} electrocatalyst for oxidation of primary alcohols in alkaline media. In 2010, palladium-catalysed organic reactions were recognised by the Nobel Prize in Chemistry. Palladium is also a versatile metal for homogeneous catalysis, used in combination with a broad variety of ligands for highly selective chemical transformations. A 2008 study showed that palladium is an effective catalyst for carbon-fluoride bonds.|$|E
5|$|ZnO highly n-type doped with Al, Ga, or In is {{transparent}} and <b>conductive</b> (transparency ~90%, lowest resistivity ~10−4 Ω·cm). ZnO:Al coatings {{are used for}} energy-saving or heat-protecting windows. The coating lets the visible part of the spectrum in but either reflects the infrared (IR) radiation {{back into the room}} (energy saving) or does not let the IR radiation into the room (heat protection), depending on which side of the window has the coating.|$|E
5|$|Aside {{from its}} {{unstable}} position, Halos {{would have to}} contend with thousands of meteor and micrometeor impacts which would destabilize or destroy the ring; there is no evidence in the games that the installations project an energy shield to prevent this occurrence. Because of the magnetic environment around the gas giant, a Halo would be exposed to high levels of radiation. Earth is protected from such radiation by charged particles created by the planet's magnetic field. Grazier posits that huge <b>conductive</b> cables could run the circumference of a Halo; when an electric current was run through these cables, a protective magnetic environment could be created to sustain life.|$|E
5|$|In {{classical}} antiquity, {{the western}} Istria route {{was first used}} by Via Flavia in the classical antiquity, but the roads in the area declined in the Middle Ages and subsequent division of the Istrian Peninsula by the Republic of Venice and the Habsburg Empire was not <b>conductive</b> to development of a road system. In the 19th century, the First French Empire started road construction, including the TriestePula route now largely followed by D21. The present-day D21 route {{was a part of}} M2 Adriatic Highway route after the Second World War. It was made a separate state road and assigned its present route number in 1997.|$|E
5|$|Tantalum is dark (blue-gray), dense, ductile, very hard, easily fabricated, {{and highly}} <b>conductive</b> {{of heat and}} electricity. The metal is renowned for its {{resistance}} to corrosion by acids; in fact, at temperatures below 150°C tantalum is almost completely immune to attack by the normally aggressive aqua regia. It can be dissolved with hydrofluoric acid or acidic solutions containing the fluoride ion and sulfur trioxide, {{as well as with}} a solution of potassium hydroxide. Tantalum's high melting point of 3017°C (boiling point 5458°C) is exceeded among the elements only by tungsten, rhenium and osmium for metals, and carbon.|$|E
5|$|Though the Pacific {{electric}} ray will feed at any hour, it responds to prey {{much more quickly}} at night than during the day. Most prey captures occur in darkness or turbid conditions, when its eyes are largely useless. Instead, it relies on electroreception via its ampullae of Lorenzini to locate food. Experiments in the field have shown that it will attack artificially generated electric fields and <b>conductive</b> metal electrodes. Mechanical sensory cues, detected via the lateral line, also play an important role: this species has been observed preferentially attacking faster-moving prey even if a closer food item was available.|$|E
25|$|Polyacetylene has no {{commercial}} applications, {{although the}} discovery of polyacetylene as a <b>conductive</b> organic polymer led to many developments in materials science. Conducting polymers are of interest for solution-processing for film-forming <b>conductive</b> polymers. Therefore, attention has shifted to other <b>conductive</b> polymers for application purposes including polythiophene and polyaniline.|$|E
25|$|Earthing – {{to avoid}} {{electrical}} charge accumulation on a <b>conductive</b> coated sample, {{it is usually}} electrically connected to the metal sample holder. Often an electrically <b>conductive</b> adhesive is used for this purpose.|$|E
25|$|Electrochemical {{cells have}} two <b>conductive</b> {{electrodes}} (the anode and the cathode). The anode {{is defined as}} the electrode where oxidation occurs and the cathode is the electrode where the reduction takes place. Electrodes can be made from any sufficiently <b>conductive</b> materials, such as metals, semiconductors, graphite, and even <b>conductive</b> polymers. In between these electrodes is the electrolyte, which contains ions that can freely move.|$|E
25|$|Many {{semiconductor}} devices used in electronics are particularly sensitive to static discharge. <b>Conductive</b> antistatic bags {{are commonly used}} to protect such components. People who work on circuits that contain these devices often ground themselves with a <b>conductive</b> antistatic strap.|$|E
25|$|The {{starting}} material is a flat substrate, {{such as a}} silicon wafer or a polished disc of beryllium, copper, titanium, or other material. The substrate, if not already electrically <b>conductive,</b> {{is covered with a}} <b>conductive</b> plating base, typically through sputtering or evaporation.|$|E
25|$|Thermally <b>conductive</b> tape {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{cost-effective}} heat sink attachment materials. It is suitable for low-mass heat sinks and for components with low power dissipation. It consists of a thermally <b>conductive</b> carrier material with a pressure-sensitive adhesive on each side.|$|E
25|$|Holes {{may be made}} <b>conductive,</b> by {{electroplating}} or inserting metal eyelets (hollow), to electrically and thermally connect board layers. Some <b>conductive</b> {{holes are}} intended for the insertion of through-hole-component leads. Others, typically smaller and used to connect board layers, are called vias.|$|E
25|$|<b>Conductive</b> glass solders can be also prepared.|$|E
25|$|One clear {{advantage}} is that the electrical conductivity is different between different kinds of cells. Living cells have a lower <b>conductive</b> medium while the dead ones have minimum or no <b>conductive</b> medium. The system {{may be able to}} manipulate roughly 10,000 cells or particles at the same time.|$|E
25|$|Carbon {{products}} {{have been added}} to make concrete electrically <b>conductive,</b> for deicing purposes.|$|E
25|$|Each {{electrode}} {{consists of}} an electrically <b>conductive</b> electrolyte gel and a silver/silver chloride conductor.|$|E
25|$|It {{is highly}} <b>conductive</b> to cations, making it {{suitable}} for many membrane applications.|$|E
