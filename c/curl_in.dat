25|$|The {{standard}} Olympic {{distance of}} 1.5/40/10km (0.93/24.8/6.2miles) {{was created by}} longtime triathlon race director Jim <b>Curl</b> <b>in</b> the mid-1980s, after he and partner Carl Thomas produced the U.S. Triathlon Series (USTS) between 1982 and 1997.|$|E
25|$|The {{right-hand}} rule {{can be used}} {{to indicate}} the direction of the angular velocity. If the thumb of the right hand points to the north celestial pole, its fingers <b>curl</b> <b>in</b> the direction that the Moon orbits Earth, Earth orbits the Sun, and the Moon and Earth rotate on their own axes.|$|E
25|$|At the {{conclusion}} of the 2011-12 season Hanna announced she would not be curling competitively in the 2012-13 season, and had no immediate plans to curl competitively in the near or immediate future. Her sister Stephanie also left competitive curling. However, the Hanna sisters and Letendre teamed up with Lisa Paddle to <b>curl</b> <b>in</b> the 2013–14 curling season.|$|E

25|$|The Workman layout {{employs a}} {{hypothesis}} about the preferential movement of each finger rather than categorically considering the lowest letter row to be least accessible. Specifically, {{the index finger}} prefers to curl inwards rather than stretch outwards. So for the index finger, the position of second preference goes to the bottom row rather than the top row. Contrarily, the middle and ring fingers are relatively long and prefer to stretch out rather than <b>curl</b> <b>in.</b> Based on this, weighting is allotted to each key specifically rather than each row generically.|$|E
25|$|The cash league {{which runs}} Wednesday evenings is {{the league with}} the highest calibre of curling. Some of the top curlers in the world <b>curl</b> <b>in</b> the cash league at the Ottawa Curling Club. Winners of games receive money, which can vary {{depending}} on the level the teams involved are at. The league is open, so there are both men's and women's teams. Curlers in the OCC Cash league include Lynn Kreviazuk, Chris Gardner, Craig Savill, Erin Morrissey, Karen Sagle, Ian MacAulay, Jean-Michel Ménard, Jamie Sinclair, Jenn Hanna, Pascale Letendre, Stephanie Hanna and Mark Homan.|$|E
25|$|As a {{specific}} example, {{refer to the}} circularly polarized wave in the first animation. Using this convention that wave is defined as right-handed because when one points one's right thumb {{in the same direction}} of the wave’s propagation, the fingers of that hand <b>curl</b> <b>in</b> the same direction of the field’s temporal rotation. It is considered clockwise circularly polarized because {{from the point of view}} of the source, looking in the same direction of the wave’s propagation, the field rotates in the clockwise direction. The second animation is that of left-handed or anti-clockwise light using this same convention.|$|E

25|$|In the {{instance}} just cited, {{using the}} handedness convention {{used in many}} optics textbooks, the light is considered left-handed/counter-clockwise circularly polarized. Referring to the accompanying animation, it is considered left-handed because if one points one's left thumb against the direction of travel, ones fingers <b>curl</b> <b>in</b> the direction the electric field rotates as the wave passes a given point in space. The helix also forms a left-handed helix in space. Similarly this light is considered counter-clockwise circularly polarized because if a stationary observer faces against the direction of travel, the person will observe its electric field rotate in the counter-clockwise direction as the wave passes a given point in space.|$|E

2500|$|Another {{principle}} applied {{is that it}} is {{more natural}} and less effort to <b>curl</b> <b>in</b> or stretch out fingers rather than rotate one's wrist inwards/outwards. Thus the Workman layout allots a lower priority to the two innermost columns between the home keys (G and H columns on a QWERTY layout), similarly to the Colemak-DH or [...] "Curl" [...] mods. Workman also balances the load quite evenly between both hands.|$|E
2500|$|Partial {{derivatives}} may {{be combined}} in interesting ways to create more complicated expressions of the derivative. [...] In vector calculus, the del operator (...) is used to define the concepts of gradient, divergence, and <b>curl</b> <b>in</b> terms of partial derivatives. [...] A matrix of partial derivatives, the Jacobian matrix, {{may be used to}} represent the derivative of a function between two spaces of arbitrary dimension. [...] The derivative can thus be understood as a linear transformation which directly varies from point to point in the domain of the function.|$|E
