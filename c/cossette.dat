40|$|In this investigation, the {{production}} of ethanol from the raw sugar beet juice and raw sugar beet <b>cossettes</b> has been studied. For ethanol production from the raw sugar beet juice, batch and fed-batch cultivation techniques in the stirred tank bioreactor were used, while batch ethanol production from the raw sugar beet <b>cossettes</b> {{was carried out in}} hori-zontal rotating tubular bioreactor (HRTB). In both cases, Saccharomyces cerevisiae was used as a production microorganism. During batch ethanol production from the raw sugar beet juice, ethanol yield was 59. 89 g/L and production efficiency 78. 8 %, and in fed-batch pro-cess the yield was 92. 78 g/L and efficiency 93. 4 %. At the same time, ethanol production in HRTB from the raw sugar beet <b>cossettes</b> with inoculum of 16. 7 % V/m (raw sugar beet <b>cossettes)</b> resulted in the highest ethanol yield of 54. 53 g/L and production efficiency of 79. 5 %.

5000|$|Diffusers {{are long}} vessels of many metres {{in which the}} beet slices go in one {{direction}} while hot water goes in the opposite direction. The movement may either {{be caused by a}} rotating screw or the whole rotating unit, and the water and <b>cossettes</b> move through internal chambers. The three common designs of diffuser are the horizontal rotating 'RT' (Raffinerie Tirlemontoise, manufacturer), inclined screw 'DDS' (De Danske Sukkerfabrikker), or vertical screw [...] "Tower". Modern tower extraction plants have a processing capacity of up to 17,000 t per day. A less-common design uses a moving belt of <b>cossettes,</b> with water pumped onto the top of the belt and poured through. In all cases, the flow rates of <b>cossettes</b> and water are in the ratio one to two. Typically, <b>cossettes</b> take about 90 minutes to pass through the diffuser, the water only 45 minutes. These countercurrent exchange methods extract more sugar from the <b>cossettes</b> using less water than if they merely sat in a hot water tank. The liquid exiting the diffuser is called raw juice. The colour of raw juice varies from black to a dark red depending on the amount of oxidation, which is itself dependent on diffuser design.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Yam {{is one of}} {{the most}} staple foods in West African {{countries}} and provides an important part of the energetic for peoples. The fresh tuber contains a lot of water that makes it preservation very difficult. This study was undertaken to assess the health risk of yam chips obtained from the traditional draw-plate consisting of transforming the fresh yam tuber into dehydrated product (dried yam) known as “cossettes ” which is less perishable and propose strategies to control risk points. The approach of HACCP (Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point) concept using the standardized routine methods adopted in the UEMOA (W est African Economic and Monetary Union) countries allowed us to do microbiology’s assesses. The results of this study showed that the yam chips are contaminated to various degrees by Mesophilic germs (Bacillus sp), coliforms and molds (Aspergillus niger, Aspergillus flavus and Aspergillus glaucus). Salmonella was not found. This bacteria and moulds isolated in the yam chips contain some species involved in food borne illness. The practice of dry yam chips was don to overcome the loses of the yam fresh tuber. The bad conditions of this work affect the hygienic qualities of dry yam, which can present the health risk of consumers.

40|$|Growing {{demand for}} better quality and cheaper {{products}} {{put on the}} need to industry to balance between the two kinds of needs, which are the reduction of production costs and to ensure a high quality product. This is the case with dried sugar beet pulp as a byproduct of sugar refining process. One of the possibilities to reduce energy consumption is savings in the process of thermal dehydration in the process of the conventional drying of pulp. Pulp drying is one third of total energy consumption in the sugar factory. Acidification of water extraction result in pulp that could be pressed better and in other hand in the juice with less non-sucrose compounds. Keeping the extraction process under certain conditions, directly affects {{on the quality of the}} extracted pulp and on effects of their further processing. This paper examines the impact of the extraction parameters of sugar from sugar beet and agents of acidification for water extraction (sulphurous acid, hydrogen peroxide) on the quality of dried sugar beet pulp. Extraction of sugar from sugar beet <b>cossettes</b> by hydrogen peroxide at pH 5. 5 to 8. 5 does not cause changes in mechanical properties of sugar beet <b>cossettes</b> and in water retention coefficient, but increases the brightness of dried sugar beet pulp for about 5 - 7 units, which solubility in water does not depend on the applied concentration of extracting agents, but increases in dependence on the duration of the extraction. Sugar beet pulp extracted at pH 11. 0 has reduced strength, they are highly hydrated, and under the force they lose their shape, binding a larger amount of water thus reducing the effect of their pressing. The changes in microstructure were probably accompanied by segmenting the linear parts of macromolecules and are reflected in the increase of water retention capacity and increase the solubility of dried sugar beet pulp for two to three times. Under the same conditions of extraction, sulphurous acid produces similar but relatively mild changes in the characteristics of extracted and dried sugar beet pulp compared to conditions when hydrogen peroxide is used. From the point of the quality of the product of extraction, the most favorable results are obtained when the extraction is carried on at pH 5. 5 for a period of 1 h at 70 °C, using water for extraction with sulphourus acid with the addition of 5 % hydrogen peroxide. Under these conditions no significant degradation of sugar beet tissue is detected, do not change the physical, chemical and mechanical properties of the extracted pulp. But there is an average increase of lightness of dried noodles for about 7 units, which represents a significant improvement of their quality, since there is difficult to sell on the market the dried sugar beet pulp with increased colour...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a new method for the rapid assessment of losses in stored maize cobs and dried cassava chips (<b>cossettes)</b> : {{the use of}} visual damage scales. The scales can be calibrated against conventional weight loss assessment techniques to permit the estimation of percentage weight losses in stores. The scales were first developed for a survey of Larger Grain Borer beetle (Prostephanus truncatus (Horn)) damage in farm stores in central Togo. They were constructed by sorting infested maize and cassava by eye into different damage classes(four classes for maize cobs and five for cassava chips). In the survey, each sampled cob or chip was scored for damage on the appropriate visual scale, using reference photos to ensure consistency. Advantages of the method include: it is quick and easy to use, {{increasing the number of}} stores which can be sampled; data loss or fabrication is reduced; anomalous results can be checked on the spot; and it increases farmer participation in the survey work. Methods of data analysis are discussed in detail. The raw (ranked) data can be analysed by chi-square tests, rank correlation and ordinal logistic regression. Alternatively, if the scales are used to estimate weight losses, this permits the use of more powerful techniques such as analysis of variance. The scales have potential for many types of survey work, especially rapid appraisal. {{one of the most interesting}} applications could be to estimate parameters such as loss in market value and loss of final food product (rather than whole grain), but more work is needed to devise appropriate ways of calibrating the scales for this purpose...|$|R

With yam one of its principal crops, Ghana is the world s second largest producer of the root, with 3. 25 million tonnes grown in 1999. In 1998 it exported 7, 500 tonnes of yam, mainly to the United Kingdom and the United States, for USD 5 million, accounting for 36 % of world yam exports. Between 1997 and 1998, the area under cultivation grew by almost 13 %. The Ghana Yam Producers and Exporters Association provides its members with technical support with emphasis being given to certain varieties (with tubers weighing between 2 and 3 kg, which is better for the export market), and to post-harvest handling, storage, packaging, quality control and shipping, with details strictly described on the wrappings. These steps {{have been taken to}} meet the requirements of the international markets, and thus to increase sales. They are steps worth taking, since the export yam earns six times more than the domestic market yam. Ghana s yam exports have now outpaced those of Jamaica, Brazil and Côte d Ivoire. Nigeria is the leading world producer with more than 25 million tonnes in 1999, but it consumes the entire crop on the domestic market. Ghana s neighbours - Togo, Benin and Nigeria - also sell their yams in dried baton shapes known as <b>cossettes.</b> These peeled yams are blanched and solar-dried and keep better than fresh yam.
