500|$|To {{simulate}} {{the police officer}} falling in the opening scene, the special effects department had the stunt double fall 52feet onto an 18x24feet airbag, which they referred to as [...] "old-fashioned" [...] because they used the airbag rather than wires. Trevor Jones, the stuntman doing the scene, commented during shooting that his fall had a small margin of error, {{because of the small}} airbag and cement walls surrounding the area, [...] "if you land off center maybe three or four feet, then you're going to get pitched in that direction". To aid Jones, a large X was placed on the airbag. A scene later in the episode involves a car fleeing through a garage door, only to hit a concrete wall, flip over, and burst into flames. To create the scene, the crew used two externally identical cars; one was drivable, and the other was a shell of car, and was hooked to a <b>cable</b> <b>rig.</b> After taking a week to get everything set up, the crew used a nitrogen cannon to launch the second, undrivable car through the garage door via wires.|$|E
5000|$|The UDT {{also began}} {{developing}} weapons skills {{and procedures for}} commando operations on land in coastal regions. The UDT started experiments with insertion/extraction by helicopter, jumping from a moving helicopter into the water or rappelling like mountain climbers to the ground. Experimentation developed a system for emergency extraction by plane called [...] "Skyhook." [...] Skyhook utilized a large helium balloon and <b>cable</b> <b>rig</b> with harness. A special grabbing device on the nose of a C-130 enabled a pilot to snatch the cable tethered to the balloon and lift a person off the ground. Once airborne, the crew would winch the cable in and retrieve the personnel though {{the back of the}} aircraft. This technique was discontinued for training purposes after the death of a SEAL at NAB Coronado on a training lift. The teams still utilize the Fulton Skyhook for equipment extraction and retain the capability for war if an extreme situation requires it.|$|E

In the United States drilling wages would average around US$200 per day per man, while in Africa {{it is only}} US$6 per day per man, so a slow drilling machine can still be used in undeveloped countries with depressed wages. A <b>cable</b> tool <b>rig</b> can drill 25 ft to 60 ft of hard rock a day. A newer rotary drillcat top head rig equipped with down-the-hole (DTH) hammer can drill 500 ft or more per day, depending on size and formation hardness.|$|R

5000|$|The {{accident}} {{flight was}} the first flight following maintenance that included flight control <b>cable</b> <b>rigging.</b> The flight was also intended to provide cockpit familiarization for the first officer and the pilot observer, and as a training flight for the first officer. About one minute after takeoff, the first officer contacted the tower and stated {{that they needed to}} return to land. The airplane impacted a cornfield about one mile southwest of the approach end of the runway, and 2 minutes 40 seconds after the initiation of the takeoff roll. The cockpit voice recorder (CVR) indicated that, during the flight, neither the captain nor the first officer called for the landing gear to be raised, the flaps to be retracted, or the power levers to be reduced from full power. From the time the first officer called [...] "rotate" [...] until the impact, the captain repeated the word [...] "pull" [...] about 27 times. When the observer pilot asked, [...] "Come back on the trim?" [...] the captain responded, [...] "There's nothing anymore on the trim." [...] The inspection of the airplane revealed that the elevator trim <b>cables</b> were <b>rigged</b> improperly, which resulted in the trim cables being reversed. As a result, when the pilot applied nose-up trim, the elevator trim system actually applied nose-down trim. An examination of the maintenance instruction cards used to conduct the last inspection revealed that the inspector's block on numerous checks were not signed off by the Required Inspection Item (RII) inspector. The RII inspector did not sign the item that stated: [...] "Connect elevator servo trim tab <b>cables</b> and <b>rig</b> in accordance with Allison Convair manual...” The item had been signed off by the mechanic, but not by the RII inspector. The card also contained a NOTE, which stated in bold type, [...] "A complete inspection of all elevator controls must be accomplished and signed off by an RII qualified inspector and a logbook entry made to this effect." [...] The RII inspector block was not signed off.|$|R

50|$|<b>Cable</b> tool <b>rigs</b> are {{simpler and}} cheaper than {{similarly}} sized rotary rigs, although loud and very slow to operate. The world record cable tool well was drilled in New York {{to a depth}} of almost 12,000 ft. The common Bucyrus-Erie 22 can drill down to about 1,100 ft. Since cable tool drilling does not use air to eject the drilling chips like a rotary, instead using a cable strung bailer, technically there is no limitation on depth.|$|R
25|$|When rodeo riders invaded Hollywood, {{they brought}} {{a battery of}} rodeo {{techniques}} that Canutt would expand and improve, including horse falls and wagon wrecks, along with the harnesses and <b>cable</b> <b>rigs</b> to make the stunts foolproof and safe. Among the new safety devices was the 'L' stirrup, which allowed a man to fall off a horse without getting hung in the stirrup. Canutt also developed cabling and equipment to cause spectacular wagon crashes, while releasing the team, {{all on the same}} spot every time. Safety methods such as these saved film-makers time and money and prevented accidents and injury to performers. One of Yakima's inventions was the 'Running W' stunt, bringing down a horse at the gallop by attaching a wire, anchored to the ground, to its fetlocks and launching the rider forwards spectacularly. This either killed the horse, or rendered it badly shaken and unusable {{for the rest of the}} day. The 'Running W' is now banned and has been replaced with the falling-horse technique. It is believed that the last time it was used was on the 1983 Iraqi film al-Mas' Ala Al-Kubra when British actor and friend of Yak Marc Sinden and stuntman Ken Buckle (who had been trained by Yak) performed the stunt three times during a cavalry charge sequence.|$|R
50|$|Aircraft were {{equipped}} with dual cockpits for filming in flight. A Yakovlev Yak-52TW was modified {{to resemble a}} Supermarine Spitfire, and two Supermarine Spitfire Mark IAs, a Spitfire Mark VB, and a Hispano Buchon painted to resemble a Messerschmitt Bf 109E, were also used for the combat scenes. Large-scale radio controlled model aircraft, including Heinkel He 111 and Junkers Ju 87 bombers, were filmed crashing into the English Channel. The real Spitfires were provided by the Imperial War Museum Duxford, and owner Dan Friedkin piloted {{the one that was}} shot landing on the beach in Dunkirk. These takes had to be done within forty-five minutes, before the tide came back in. IMAX cameras were attached to the fighter planes using specially-made snorkel and periscope lenses - in the back and the front - and large-scale mockups were submerged with <b>cable</b> <b>rigs</b> for a crash scene. A Piper Aerostar enabled filming from the air, also with IMAX cameras front and rear. Dogfights over the Channel were shot by an aerial unit based at Lee-on-Solent Airfield. Hardy and Lowden spent the final stages of the shooting schedule on a cliffside in Palos Verdes, inside purpose-built cockpit gimbals, with limited contact {{with the rest of the}} cast and crew. Principal photography ended on 2 September 2016, after sixty-eight days.|$|R
50|$|<b>Cable</b> tool <b>rigs</b> are a {{traditional}} way of drilling water wells. The majority of large diameter water supply wells, especially deep wells completed in bedrock aquifers, were completed using this drilling method. Although this drilling method has largely been supplanted {{in recent years by}} other, faster drilling techniques, it is still the most practicable drilling method for large diameter, deep bedrock wells, and in widespread use for small rural water supply wells. The impact of the drill bit fractures the rock and in many shale rock situations increases the water flow into a well over rotary.|$|R

50|$|The grid deck, {{gridiron}} deck, or grid, is a permeable {{working surface}} {{present at the}} top of many fly lofts that is used to support and provide access to many of a rigging system's components. Though originally constructed of wood, down-facing three-inch steel channels with three-inch gaps became the prevalent grid decking in the 20th century. Today, large-opening heavy-duty steel bar grating is most common in new theatres. The grid deck surface is usually rated to support live loads as well as all anticipated dead-hung equipment and hemp and motorized (e.g., chain hoist) spot rigging. Its permeability facilitates the mounting of equipment and the passing of lift lines and electrical <b>cables.</b> Spot <b>rigging</b> is not feasible without a grid.|$|R
50|$|The well {{is located}} at the present-day {{intersection}} of SE 59th Street and Bryant Boulevard. It was drilled by the Indian Territory Illuminating Oil Company (ITIO). Beginning on June 12, 1928, the drilling crew drilled more than 6000 ft. In early December they broke through the Arbuckle Limestone layer, noting that the bottom of the formation was saturated with oil and was under gas pressure. Since they were drilling with a <b>cable</b> tool <b>rig,</b> the flow of gas and oil could not be controlled, and on December 4 the gas blew the tools out of the well. The well produced 110,000 barrels of oil during its first 27 days. However, the well began to produce water by the end of 1928 and was abandoned.|$|R
40|$|The {{first section}} of this Volume will discuss the ''Conventional Drilling System''. Today's complex {{arrangement}} of numerous interacting systems has slowly evolved from the very simple <b>cable</b> tool <b>rigs</b> used in the late 1800 s. Improvements to the conventional drilling rig have varied in size and impact over the years, {{but the majority of}} them have been evolutionary modifications. Each individual change or improvement of this type does not have significant impact on drilling efficiency and economics. However, the change is almost certain to succeed, and over time [...] as the number of evolutionary changes to the system begin to add up [...] improvements in efficiency and economics can be seen. Some modifications, defined and described in this Volume as Advanced Modifications, have more than just an evolutionary effect on the conventional drilling system. Although the distinction is subtle, there are several examples of incorporated advancements that have had significantly more impact on drilling procedures than would a truly evolutionary improvement. An example of an advanced modification occurred in the late 1970 s with the introduction of Polycrystalline Diamond Compact (PDC) drill bits. PDC bits resulted in a fundamental advancement in drilling procedures that could not have been accomplished by an evolutionary improvement in materials metallurgy, for example. The last drilling techniques discussed in this Volume are the ''Novel Drilling Systems''. The extent to which some of these systems have been developed varies from actually being tested in the field, to being no more than a theoretical concept. However, they all {{have one thing in common}} [...] their methods of rock destruction are fundamentally different from conventional drilling techniques. When a novel drilling system is introduced, it is a revolutionary modification of accepted drilling procedures and will completely replace current techniques. The most prominent example of a revolutionary modification in recent history was the complete displacement of <b>cable</b> tool <b>rigs</b> by rotary drilling rigs in the late 1920 s...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} the out-of-plane dynamic {{stability}} of inclined cables subjected to in-plane vertical support excitation is investigated. We compute stability boundaries for the out-of-plane modes using rescaling and averaging methods. Our study {{focuses on the}} 2 : 1 internal resonance phenomenon between modes that occurs when the excitation frequency is twice the ﬁrst out-of-plane natural frequency of the cable. The second in-plane mode is excited directly, while the out-of-plane modes can be excited parametrically. An analytical model is developed in order to study the stability regions in parameter space. In this model we include nonlinear coupling effects with other modes, which have thus far been omitted from previous models of parametric excitation of inclined cables. Our study reﬂects the importance of such effects. Unstable parameter regions are deﬁned for the selected cable conﬁguration. The validity of the proposed stability model was tested experimentally using a small-scale <b>cable</b> actuator <b>rig.</b> A comparison between experimental and analytical results is presented in which very good agreement with model predictions was obtained. r 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
