2500|$|There {{are three}} basic types of {{knitting}} needles (also called [...] "knitting pins"). [...] The {{first and most}} common type consists of two slender, straight sticks tapered to a point at one end, and with a knob {{at the other end}} to prevent stitches from slipping off. Such needles are usually [...] long but, due to the compressibility of knitted fabrics, may be used to knit pieces significantly wider. [...] The most important property of needles is their diameter, which ranges from below 2 to 25mm (roughly 1inch). The diameter affects the size of stitches, which affects the gauge/tension of the knitting and the elasticity of the fabric. [...] Thus, a simple way to change gauge/tension is to use different needles, which is the basis of uneven knitting. [...] Although the diameter of the knitting needle is often measured in millimeters, there are several measurement systems, particularly those specific to the United States, the United Kingdom and Japan; a <b>conversion</b> <b>table</b> is given at knitting needle. [...] Such knitting needles may be made out of any materials, but the most common materials are metals, wood, bamboo, and plastic. [...] Different materials have different frictions and grip the yarn differently; slick needles such as metallic needles are useful for swift knitting, whereas rougher needles such as bamboo offer more friction and are therefore less prone to dropping stitches. [...] The knitting of new stitches occurs only at the tapered ends. [...] Needles with lighted tips have been sold to allow knitters to knit in the dark.|$|E
