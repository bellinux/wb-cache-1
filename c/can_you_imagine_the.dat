The oldest orca in captivity is the 50-year-old Lolita {{who is at the}} Miami Seaquarium. The average lifespan for a captured orca is 20 to 30 years. Of Granny's age, Captain Pidcock of Ocean Ecoventures Whale Watching said [...] " [...] it’s mind-blowing to think that this whale is over 100 years old.

Who knows, maybe Ol’ Ben strapped that key to his kite because he desperately wanted to cut loose to a wicked techno beat. Imagine if things would have advanced differently, Benjamin Franklin could have been DJ Kite Keys, spinning the best beats of the 18th century. <b>Can</b> <b>you</b> <b>imagine</b> <b>the</b> hundred dollar bill with Franklin wearing aviator sunglasses and oversized headphones? Can you see why I was never able to concentrate in History class? Electronic music is a really crowded market, which can make standing out a bit of a challenge.

5000|$|In July 2003 Media Action Network {{protested the}} British program Banzai, which is {{produced}} by Channel 4. Following the first U.S. broadcast of the series on the Fox Network on July 13, 2003, the Media Action Network accused the program, a spoof betting show that parodies Japanese game shows, of employing demeaning stereotypes of Asians. About 20 {{members of the group}} carried signs and shouted slogans outside a presentation by the Fox network to TV critics in Hollywood. Aoki commented, [...] "This is like an Asian minstrel show. <b>Can</b> <b>you</b> <b>imagine</b> <b>the</b> black version of Banzai?" [...] Fox spokesman Scott Grogin responded by saying, [...] "We've received an entire range of comments on the show, both pro and con", and that as a satire, the show should be viewed as [...] "tongue-in-cheek". According to Aoki, in discussions with the MANAA, Fox offered to include a disclaimer {{at the beginning of the}} show, but Aoki indicated that this would not assuage the MANAA, who wished the program not be broadcast at all.|$|E
5000|$|In 1999, when State Representative Tom Warner {{resigned}} {{from his seat}} in the legislature to accept an appointment as the state's first solicitor general, a special election was held to replace him in the 82nd District, which included parts of southern Martin County and northern Palm Beach County. Negron ran to replace him, and faced Art Argenio, John Whitescarver, Melinda Tumminia, and John Carroll in the Republican primary. Negron placed first in the primary, winning 47% of the vote to Argenio's 30%, but {{because he did not}} win a majority, a runoff election was held that Argenio narrowly won with 52% of the vote. When Argenio ran for re-election in 2000, Negron once again challenged him in the primary, along with David Traill, and received a plurality of the vote, thus necessitating another runoff election. During the course of the campaign, the two candidates signed an agreement aimed at stopping the personal attacks on one another. Though both agreed that water discharge from Lake Okeechobee was harming the St. Lucie River, they disagreed on the solution to the problem; Argenio indicated that he would introduce legislation to set a maximum depth of the lake, which Negron blasted, arguing, [...] "I don't think a legislator should be setting feet and inches of a lake. <b>Can</b> <b>you</b> <b>imagine</b> <b>the</b> chaos that would ensue if water managers who need flexibility can't make adjustments to the water level? I think it's nuts." [...] The two also disagreed on health care policy, with Negron suggesting that patients should be able to sue HMOs and announcing that he would sponsor legislation that would allow patients to see specialists without approval from their primary care physician, and Argenio calling Negron's plans a [...] "lawyer's bill of rights." [...] Ultimately, Negron narrowly defeated Argenio to win the Republican nomination for the seat, and was unopposed in the general election. He won re-election uncontested in 2002 and 2004 as well.|$|E
