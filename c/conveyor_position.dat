5000|$|At the top, {{there was}} a slight {{drop-off}} the chain as the boat heads toward the drop. An animatronic [...] "falling rock" [...] teeters close to the boat. This area was once filled with an extremely dense layer of mist, to obscure riders' vision of what lies ahead. At this point, the Canyon Blaster is mere feet above the heads of Rim Runner passengers. Another set of <b>conveyor</b> belts <b>positions</b> the boat for its final plunge, an 80-foot camelback drop to a wet conclusion. A final right-hand turned places the boat at the final set of conveyor belts that lifts the boat {{out of the water and}} back into the station.|$|R
40|$|The {{device for}} {{handling}} packets, for {{loading and unloading}} storage areas where the packages are stacked, {{has at least one}} suction grip which is positioned horizontally to a packet, to apply a suction grip to one side of it. A transfer system moves the package to and from a transport unit. A suction grip system moves the separate packets directly between the storage area and the conveyor, in or out. The <b>conveyor</b> is <b>positioned</b> at the storage area, to insert or remove packages by rows at the stacks, in a controlled sequence. USE - Especially for parcel mailing warehouses, where packages have to be stacked and sorted for despatch. ADVANTAGE - The operation is wholly automatic, reducing labour costs and also preventing risk of injury to staff through the package handling actions...|$|R

The states of the {{individual}} controls of the modules are all updated simultaneously. This is achieved by utilizing a global scheduler that informs the individual controls to update their state. The global scheduler only informs the controls to update their state after all controls from the previous update cycle have finished updating.|$|R

There are many applications that have been developed based on motor {{position control}} theory, such as crane controller, lift and <b>conveyor.</b> The <b>position</b> control of an ac motor is very difficult to be implemented by using traditional control techniques, as it requires a very complex mathematical model. The purpose for this project is to describe the research on fuzzy logic controller (FLC) design based on programmable logic controller (PLC) in order to control the position of an ac motor of University Malaysia Pahang (UMP) mini conveyor. By using FLC, the conveyor will stop at the desired point set by the user with minimum error. The model of the PLC that has been used in this project is OMRON CQM 1 H-CPU 51. Before the controller was developed, numbers of simulations were done using MATLAB Fuzzy Logic Toolbox and SIMULINK. There are three rules that have been implemented in this project, which used three membership functions. Based on the simulation, it can be concluded that the system which has many rules in the fuzzy logic controller produced better response compared to the system using a few rules...|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} toolbox for cold atom {{manipulation}} with time-dependent magnetic fields generated by an atom chip. Wire layouts, detailed experimental procedures and {{results are presented}} for the following experiments: Use of a magnetic <b>conveyor</b> belt for <b>positioning</b> of cold atoms and Bose-Einstein condensates with a resolution of two nanometers; splitting of thermal clouds and BECs in adjustable magnetic double well potentials; controlled splitting of a cold reservoir. The devices that enable these manipulations can be combined with each other. We demonstrate this by combining reservoir splitter and conveyor belt to obtain a cold atom dispenser.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the problem of {{planning}} safe trajectories for a manipulator robot moving in an environment including both static obstacles and objects (other robots, <b>conveyors</b> [...] .) whose <b>positions</b> may change during the interval of time separating two planning steps. In order to solve this problem for a general manipulator having six degrees of freedom, we have developed and implemented a method combining two different path planners: a local planner whose purpose is to take the manipulator away from the constrained initial and final configurations, and a global planner which is in charge of generating a safe trajectory for the first three degrees of freedom of the arm. Both the local and the global planners are based on a fast iterative algorithm for computing the distance between pairs of objects. These planners have been implemented within a robot programming system (called ACT) including a solid modeler dedicated to robotics applications and a connection to a robot controller...|$|R
40|$|To rapidly feed {{industrial}} parts on an assembly line, Carlisle et. al. [7] proposed a flexible part feeding system that drops parts {{on a flat}} <b>conveyor</b> belt, determines <b>position</b> and orientation of each part with a vision system, and then moves them into a desired orientation. A robot arm with 4 degrees of freedom (DoF) is capable of moving parts through 6 DoF when equipped with a passive pivoting axis between the parallel jaws of its gripper. The idea is to grasp a part with 2 hard finger contacts such that it pivots, under gravity, into a desired orientation when lifted and replaced on the table. We refer to these actions as pivot grasps. This paper considers the planning problem. Given a polyhedral part shape, coefficient of friction {{and a pair of}} stable configurations as input, find pairs of grasp points that will cause the part to pivot from one stable configuration to the other. For some transitions, pivot grasps may not exist. For a part with n faces and m stable configurations, [...] ...|$|R
40|$|M. Ing. Parts feeding devices or feeders {{are used}} in {{automated}} assembly systems to deliver correctly oriented parts to the assembly station workhead. These devices play an important operational role since feeding {{is one of the}} major operations involved in an automated assembly process. However they account for much of the cost of an automated assembly system because most of the engineering time spent to develop such a system is used to devise a means of feeding the components in the correct orientation for the assembly process. This thesis describes the implementation of an integrated and computer controlled feeding and transfer system. The system consists of a vibratory bowl feeder for selecting, orienting and feeding parts and a flat conveyor belt for transferring parts to a prescribed location. The work focusses mainly on the design and analysis of the bowl feeder, on the mechanical and information interfacing aspects of the integration problem and on the control of the system. Sensing and electronic control circuits were also built to complete the system. The system implemented is to be integrated at a later stage with an industrial robot for handling purposes. Therefore, some issues related to the handling of parts from the conveyor belt by the robot are also discussed. Experimental results show that the recommendable operating frequency for the vibratory feeder is close to the value predicted by theoretical analysis. Several concurrent activities with critical time constraints and different periods were involved in the system, making the control more difficult due to the limited control capabilities of Visual basic, an easy to learn programming language used to implement the control program and the relatively slow speed of the computer used Nevertheless, it was observed that for feed rates close to 3 parts/min, the program developed performs well regarding the random control of the flow rate of parts on the <b>conveyor,</b> parts <b>position</b> and speed profiles obtained compare satisfactorily with the corresponding theoretical profiles. Recommendations for the integration of the robot to the system are made...|$|R
30|$|The {{conveying}} {{monitoring module}} comprises a seedling storage monitoring module, a seedling taking monitoring module, and a cup-type circulating conveying monitoring module. The monitoring module includes a pressure sensor {{and a lack}} of seedling indicator light. A PVDF pressure sensor (response time <[*] 1  ms, response point <[*] 200  g, range 0 – 50  kg) was arranged on the slot-wheeled seedling storage tray and used to detect whether there is a potted vegetable seedling tray waiting to be delivered. According to the change of the pressure signal, the controller directs the motor to drive the sprocket wheel of the storage plate and carries out the transfer of the seedling plate. By setting a stroke switch on the sprocket <b>conveyor</b> belt, the <b>position</b> of the seedling tray conveying is detected, and the push rod mechanism is triggered to perform the pushing action, and the seedling tray is moved from the seedling storage mechanism to the seedling tray conveyor belt. A finite position sensor is arranged at the junction between the conveyor belt of the seedling tray and the push rod mechanism. When it is detected that the seedling tray enters the conveyor belt from the storage mechanism, the signal is sent to the controller to stop the pushing action. The stability of the conveying action is ensured. The abnormal extraction of seedling was obtained by detecting the pressure change of the seedling pushing mechanism by pressure sensor. The potted vegetable seedling is taken out from the seedling tray and conveyed to the conveying mechanism. The CCD camera is arranged above the conveying track of the cup to monitor the leakage and load status of the potted vegetable seedling in the cups and to obtain the conveying information.|$|R
