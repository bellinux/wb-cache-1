40|$|The use {{of power}} {{electronic}} switching controllers {{for all types of}} traction drives can lead to harmonic currents on the supply side. These currents, by conductive or mutual coupling, can cause interference in signalling and telecommunications circuits. After reviewing these basic considerations, this paper outlines the harmonic spectra of d. c. -supplied chopper and inverter drives. In the case of <b>chopper</b> <b>controllers,</b> choosing a frequency unrelated to any signalling frequency combined with the attenuation provided by the input filter is usually suficient to avoid dangerous interference. For inverter drives, the situation is more complex due to the intrinsic sweepfrequency nature of the drive. However, special modulation strategies can be used for the inverter which eliminates, or at least reduces to a safe level, any particular frequency which may interfere with signalling equipment. A method for generating these optimized pulse-width modulation schemes using fast on-board micro-processors is briefly described. ...|$|R
40|$|Traction motor {{using two}} types of excitation: ripple free dc from a motor {{generator}} set for baseline data and chopped dc as supplied by a battery and <b>chopper</b> <b>controller</b> was tested. For the same average values of input voltage and current, the power output was independent {{of the type of}} excitation. At the same speeds, motor efficiency at low power output (corresponding to low duty cycle of the controller) was 5 to 10 percentage points less on chopped dc than on ripple-free dc. This illustrates that for chopped waveforms, it is incorrect to calculate input power as the product of average voltage and average current. Locked-rotor torque, no load losses, and magnetic saturation data were so determined...|$|E

For the same average values of input voltage and current, the motor power output was independent {{of the type of}} excitation. However, at the same speeds, the motor efficiency at low power output (corresponding to low duty cycle of the controller) was 5 to 10 percentage points lower on chopped dc than on ripple free dc.

To conserve battery energy as much as possible, an efficient drive system, consisting of a <b>chopper</b> <b>controller</b> and a permanent magnet motor, is described and tested in four modes of operation - two modes of motoring and two of regenerative braking. From the experimental results, it was estimated that approximately 10 % of the energy expended by the vehicle during motoring could be returned to the battery if regenerative braking is employed under stop-start driving conditions. The operation of transistor and thyristor choppers is described, and their suitability for use in a vehicle drive system is discussed.

40|$|The {{preliminary}} results of simulated electric vehicle, <b>chopper,</b> speed <b>controller</b> {{discharge of a battery}} show energy output losses {{at up to}} 25 percent compared to constant current discharges at the same average discharge current of 100 A.

40|$|The {{performance}} of {{two types of}} batteries, lead-acid and nickel-zinc, was measured {{as a function of}} the charging and discharging demands anticipated from electric vehicle propulsion systems. The benefits of rapid high current charging were mixed: although it allowed quick charges, the energy efficiency was reduced. For low power (overnight) charging the current wave shapes delivered by the charger to the battery tended to have no effect on the battery cycle life. The use of <b>chopper</b> speed <b>controllers</b> with series traction motors resulted in a significant reduction in the energy available from a battery whenever the motor operates at part load.

40|$|A {{test and}} {{analysis}} program performed on four complete propulsion systems for an {{urban electric vehicle}} (EV) is described and results given. A dc series motor and a permanent magnet (PM) motor were tested, each powered by an EV battery pack and controlled by (1) a series/parallel voltage-switching (V-switch) system; and (2) a system using a pulse width modulation, 400 Hz transistorized chopper. Dynamometer tests were first performed, followed by eV performance predictions and data correlating road tests. During dynamometer tests using chopper control; current, voltage, and power were measured on both the battery and motor sides of the chopper, using three types of instrumentation. Conventional dc instruments provided adequate accuracy for eV power and energy measurements, when used on the battery side of the controller. When using the <b>chopper</b> <b>controller,</b> {{the addition of a}} small choke inductor improved system efficiency in the lower duty cycle range (some 8 % increase at 50 % duty cycle) with both types of motors. Overall system efficiency rankings during road tests were: (1) series motor with V-switch; (2) PM motor with V-switch; (3) series motor with chopper; and (4) PM motor with chopper. Chopper control of the eV was smoother and required less driver skill than V-switch control...|$|E
40|$|Five amp-hour nickel-zinc {{cells were}} life cycled to {{evaluate}} four different charge methods. Three {{of the four}} waveforms investigated were 120 Hz full wave rectified sinusoidal (FWRS), 120 Hz silicon controlled rectified (SCR), and 1 kHz square wave (SW). The fourth, a constant current method, {{was used as a}} baseline of comparison. Three sealed Ni-Zn cells connected in series were cycled. Each series string was charged at an average c/ 20 rate, and discharged at a c/ 2. 5 rate to a 75 % rated depth. Results indicate that the relatively inexpensive 120 Hz FWRS charger appears feasible for charging 5 amp-hour nickel-zinc cells with no significant loss in average cycle life when compared to constant current charging. The 1 -kHz SW charger could also be used with no significant loss in average cycle life, and suggests the possibility of utilizing the existing electric vehicle <b>chopper</b> <b>controller</b> circuitry for an on-board charger. There was an apparent difference using the 120 Hz SCR charger compared to the others, however, this difference could be due to an inadvertent severe overcharge, which occurred prior to cell failure. The remaining two positive pulse charging waveforms, FWRS and 1 kHz, did not improve the cycle life of 5 amp-hour nickel-zinc cells over that of constant current charging...|$|E
40|$|Abstractâ€”Most {{high-performance}} ac drives utilize {{a current}} controller. The controller switches a {{voltage source inverter}} (VSI) such that the motor current follows a set of reference current waveforms. Fixed-band hysteresis (FBH) current control has been widely used for the PWM inverter. We want to apply the same controller for the PWM AC chopper. The aims of the controller is to optimize the harmonic content at both input and output sides, while maintaining acceptable losses in the ac chopper and to control in wide range the fundamental output voltage. Fixed band controller has been simulated and analyzed for a single-phase AC chopper and are easily extended to three-phase systems. Simulation confirmed the advantages and the excellent performance of the modulation method applied for the AC chopper.

40|$|A new {{high-speed}} {{x-ray beam}} chopper using laser scanner {{technology has been}} developed and tested on the SRI-CAT sector 1 beamline at the Advanced Photon Source (APS) storage ring (1). As illustrated in figure 1, it is compact in size and has two sets of transmission windows: BK- 7 glass for visible light transmission and 0. 23 -mm-thick Be for the transmission of x-rays. The rotor is made of aluminum and has a diameter of 50. 8 mm. A 0. 5 -mm-wide and 2. 29 -mm-tall slit is cut {{through the center of}} the rotor. The circumference of the rotor has a coating of 1 -mm-thick Ni, which gives an attenuation of 10 {sup 8 } at 30 keV. Turning at nearly 80000 RPM, this beam chopper has an opening time window of 2450 ns, corresponding to 67 % of the revolution time of the APS storage ring. The primary feature in selecting laser scanner technology to develop into an x-ray beam chopper was the high level of rotational speed control of the rotor that makes up the beam chopper element (2). By using an optical feedback circuit to sample the rotational speed four times each revolution, the jitter in the position of the transmission open time window is only 3 ns at the 3 standard deviation level. The APS storage ring orbital frequency, supplied by the control room, is divided down to provide the appropriate drive frequency for the beam <b>chopper</b> motor <b>controller.</b> By this means, both the storage ring and the beam chopper are operating off the same master clock. After a turn-on time of about 15 to 20 seconds, the rotational precision of the motor results in immediate phase locking to the temporal structure of the APS storage ring. By inserting a Stanford delay generator between the frequency divider and the beam <b>chopper</b> motor <b>controller,</b> the phase between the storage ring temporal structure and the beam chopper rotation can be adjusted to position the transmission time window of the beam chopper on any desired part of the storage ring fill pattern. If an asymmetric fill pattern is used in the APS storage ring, as illustrated in figure 2, such that only one bucket falls within the transmission time window of the beam chopper, then time resolution as short as 100 ps becomes possible with this new compact beam chopper...|$|R

40|$|Due to the {{increasing}} number of wind power plants, several countries have modified their grid codes to include specific requirements for the connection of this technology to the power system. One of the requirements is the ride-through fault capability (RTFC), i. e., the system capability to sustain operation during voltage sags. In this sense, the present paper intends to investigate the behavior of a full-converter wind generator with a permanent magnet synchronous machine during symmetrical and asymmetrical voltage sags. Two solutions to improve the low voltage ride-through capability (LVRT) of this technology are analyzed: discharging resistors (brake <b>chopper)</b> and resonant <b>controllers</b> (RCs).

It has also shown promise as a power supply for pulsed loads such as electric guns and electromagnetic aircraft launchers (EMAL) {{as well as for}} vital loads when power distribution systems are temporarily down. These new applications demand more efficient and compact high performance power electronics. A 250 kW Power Conditioning System (PCS), consisting of a voltage source converter (VSC) and bi-directional two-quadrant DC/DC converter (chopper), was developed at the Center for Power Electronics Systems (CPES) under an ONR funded program. The project was to develop advanced power electronic techniques for SMES Naval applications. This thesis focuses on system analysis and development of a demonstration test plan to illustrate the SMES systems' ability to be multitasked for ii implementation on naval ships.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{electronic}} load controller for self exited induction generator using PID plus fuzzy logic controller. The self-excited induction generators (SEIGs) {{are considered to be}} well suited for generating electricity by means of conventional energy sources and for supplying electrical energy in remote and rural areas. Induction generators have many advantages such as cost, reduced maintenance, rugged, and simple construction, brushless rotor (squirrel cage). A three phase induction generator can be operated on a delta connection for supplying single phase loads. The main disadvantage of SEIG has is that it poor voltage regulation, and its value depends on the prime mover speed, capacitance, load current and power factor of the load. The electronic load controller (ELC) can be used for maintaining constant voltage and frequency of SEIG with variable consumer load driven by constant prime mover. This paper presents the simulation design and implementation of ELC using fuzzy logic method for an SEIG feeding single-phase load. The ELC consist of a rectifier, IGBT as a <b>chopper</b> switch, PI <b>controller,</b> voltage sensor, and resistive dump load in which power consumption was varied through the duty cycle of the chopper. However an ELC consist of electronics system, in general, has complex nonlinear model with parameter variation problem, and the control need to be very fast. The fuzzy logic based controller gives nonlinear control with fast response and virtually no overshoot. The simulation of ELC for self exited induction generator is carried out on MATLAB/SIMULINK. By this proposed ELC using FLC for SEIG we can maintain the constant voltage and frequency of SEIG with variable consumer load. ...|$|R
