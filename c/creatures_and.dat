The primary method of control is the hand, used to pick up <b>creatures</b> <b>and</b> objects in the dungeon, carry them around, and drop them. The hand allows the player to 'slap' <b>creatures</b> <b>and</b> objects, and interact with them. Dungeon Keeper gameplay exemplifies a dark sense of humour.|$|E

Jackson, a lifelong Bond fan, remarked that as Eon tended to go for less famous directors, he would likely not get another chance to direct a Bond film after The Lord of the Rings.|$|E

5|$|Opponents to the {{shut-down}} {{maintained that}} most of the animals were unable to survive in the wild and would perish, and that the zoo's facilities had become one of the last possibilities for future generations of Navajos to see the sacred <b>creatures</b> <b>and</b> thereby relate to traditional stories, {{due to the fact that}} most younger Navajos are more accustomed to dealing with domesticated livestock rather than untamed animals.|$|E
