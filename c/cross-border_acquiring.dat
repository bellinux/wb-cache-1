Does the acquiring firm characteristics {{have a significant impact}} on acquiring firm’s shareholder wealth for both cross-border and domestic acquisitions? For the purpose of this study I have collected a total sample of 200 Indian acquiring companies, comprising of 100 <b>cross-border</b> <b>acquiring</b> companies and 100 domestic acquiring companies respectively, for the period 2000 - 2008. Using the mean values of CAR I have documented that for acquirers in India, cross-border acquisitions are more beneficial than domestic acquisitions. Using CAR, financial, growth, size, free cash flow and management variables I have found evidence that acquiring firm characteristic’s {{have a significant impact on}} acquiring firm’s shareholder wealth...|$|E
40|$|Consistent {{with the}} {{existing}} literature in U. S. domestic M&As, the methods of payment also seem to convey information about acquiring firm valuation in cross-border acquisitions. Cash-financing is associated with positive wealth gain upon foreign M&A announcements while equity-financing results in insignificant shareholder wealth increase. The fact that equity-financing {{does not lead to}} value loss as found in most domestic M&A studies seems to suggest additional wealth effect components associated with international diversification. After controlling for payment methods, the wealth effect determinants of U. S. acquirers in international M&As remain to be internationalization, location, and corporate governance factors. A missing piece in the existing literature of <b>cross-border</b> <b>acquiring</b> firm value gain and a critical complement to the documented determinants in explaining acquiring firm wealth effect appears to be the medium of exchange...|$|E
40|$|This study evaluates {{shareholder}} {{wealth and}} profitability of 62 large EU banks {{mergers and acquisitions}} that were involved in domestic or cross-border transactions during the period 1997 - 2007. We use the standardised cumulative abnormal returns (SCAR) technique and a long window of 61 days to capture merger announcement wealth effects of both domestic and <b>cross-border</b> <b>acquiring</b> banks. We argue that standardising abnormal returns helps eliminate any biases in the estimation of wealth effects by giving equal weighting to all events surrounding the merger. Our results establish that while the wealth effects of both types of mergers are negative, cross-border mergers create significant loss in shareholder value for the acquiring banks. Using standard determinants of profitability, we also conduct hierarchical regressions to ascertain the degree of merger impact on post-acquisition profitability. The results show that acquiring banks’ capital strength and cost efficiency are most important factors influencing profitability in cross-border mergers. In contrast, profitability {{in the case of}} domestic mergers is driven more by the acquiring banks’ ability to take on greater risk...|$|E
40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the question of}} why most foreign firms, particularly those from emerging economies with weak legal institutions, choose not to cross-list their shares in the U. S. despite the predictable reputational and financial benefits. Mexico is a representative emerging economy with weak legal institutions in which a large number of firms experimented with crosslistings during the past decade, and an even larger number of firms tried other financial and strategic alternatives. The results suggest that before liberalization Mexican firms selected alternative strategies besides cross-listings, and that one of these strategies, forming a crossborder strategic alliance, turned out to be associated with a lower cost of debt, better corporate governance outcomes, and higher stock returns {{over the course of the}} decade. The timing of liberalization is the key shift variable that determined which Mexican firms cross-listed and which firms instead formed <b>cross-border</b> alliances and/or <b>acquired</b> political connectedness. Firms that listed for the first time on the Mexico Stock Exchange before liberalization began in 1989 were significantly more likely to choose cross-border alliances and/or political connectedness instead of a cross-listing. Firms with alliances and political connectedness did no...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} how firms {{in countries with}} weak governance institutions access outside (technological and financial) resources and capabilities. The first essay challenges current views regarding the efficacy of renting foreign jurisdictions through cross-listings and shows that reputational mechanisms are more important. The second essay, which follows a group of Korean firms through the sequence of liberalizations and political changes since 1987, provides further evidence that reputational mechanisms are central in obtaining external resources and capabilities. The third essay suggests that Mexican firms selected alternative strategies besides cross-listings before liberalization, {{and that one of}} these strategies (forming a cross-border alliance) {{turned out to be more}} effective. The timing of liberalization is the key shift variable that determines which Mexican firms cross-listed and which firms instead formed <b>cross-border</b> alliances and/or <b>acquired</b> political connectedness. This thesis also demonstrates the complementarity of investing in domestic influence and the establishment of cross-border strategic alliances. by Jordan Ian Siegel. Thesis (Ph. D.)

40|$|A {{significant}} number of Zimbabweans cross borders daily to engage in informal cross-border trade. Zimbabwean cross-border traders are a â€˜cosmopolitan, footloose group of cultural and economic entrepreneursâ€™. They are a highly gendered group, as they comprise mostly women. These women cross-border traders are characterised by emergent, multiple, shifting and negotiated identities. In Zimbabwe, cross-border trade as an occupation had given rise {{to the image of}} a strong, independent and mobile class of women involved in long distance transborder business (Cheater 1998; Muzvidziwa 1999, 2000 and 2005; and Zinyama 2000). A new identity marking women cross-border traders from others appeared to be emerging. The paper draws largely from the one year study by the author in 2002 in Chinhoyi, the capital of Mashonaland West Province and Harare, Zimbabweâ€™s capital. This paper seeks to examine how identity is formed and legitimated in the context of women cross borderâ€™s lived experiences. The paper examines issues related to emerging, shifting and multiple identities in the context of cross border trade. The paper focuses mostly on lived experiences of Zimbabwean crossborder traders. Global domains and issues concerning home and belonging and <b>acquired</b> <b>cross-border</b> identities are also examined in the paper. Discussions in this paper lead to the conclusion that anthropological perspectives are useful and do contribute {{to a better understanding of}} issues of belonging and identity among cross border traders in Zimbabwe today...|$|R
40|$|Mergers and {{acquisitions}} {{are used for}} improving competitiveness of companies and gaining competitive advantage over other firms through gaining greater market share, broadening the portfolio to reduce business risk, entering new markets and geographies, and capitalising on economies of scale etc. India has {{emerged as one of}} the top countries with respect to merger and acquisition deals. Indian companies have been actively involved in mergers {{and acquisitions}} in India domestically as well as internationally. The value share of deals where India has been a target or an acquirer has risen sharply over the past decade, from $ 2. 2 billion in 1998 to $ 62 billion in 2007. As India increases its participation in M&A deals, it is instructive to compare the domestic and cross-border acquisitions due to their distinctiveness. The distinction between them is a function of the change in market integration which changes the costs and benefit structure and also the difference in synergies – social, cultural and organisational. This research study was aimed to study the impact of mergers on the operating performance of acquiring firms by examining some pre- merger and post-merger financial ratios of these firms and to see the differences in the pre merger and post merger ratios of the firms that go for domestic acquisitions and the firms that go for the international/cross-border acquisitions. The results suggest that there are variations in terms of impact on performance following mergers, depending on the type of firm acquired – domestic or cross-border. In particular, mergers have had a positive effect on key financial ratios of firms acquiring domestic firms while a slightly negative impact on the firms <b>acquiring</b> <b>cross-border</b> firms. ...|$|R

"A Dissertation {{presented}} to the Faculty of the Graduate School at the University of Missouri [...] Columbia In Partial Fulfillment of the Requirements for the Degree Doctor of Philosophy. "Dissertation Supervisor: Professor Stephen P. Ferris. Includes vita. Includes bibliographical references (pages 80 - 87). This study examines the influence of foreign directors on the advising role of corporate boards. I use cross-border mergers {{as a test of}} the ability of foreign directors to provide effective strategic advising. Social science literature argues that outsiders can positively influence groups by enhancing the quality of their decision-making. I find that firms with foreign directors on their boards are {{more likely to engage in}} cross-border mergers, engage in a higher number of cross-border mergers, and put more dollars in cross-border mergers. Consistent with the fact that outsiders positively impact groups, I find that firms with foreign directors are more likely to engage in non-diversifying mergers, friendly mergers, and acquiring privately-held targets. Moreover, I find that firms with foreign directors have higher announcement-period returns, pay less for their <b>cross-border</b> targets, and <b>acquire</b> undervalued targets. I also find that firms with foreign directors are more likely to use equity in their payment for cross-border targets. This study answers important questions regarding the effect of diversity in corporate boards. This research expands our understanding of how board diversity in the form of foreign directors can enhance board advising effectiveness. As companies seek foreign acquisitions, they face difficult legal, cultural, and informational challenges that can impede merger competition. Foreign directors play a key role in reducing these challenges and help to bridge the cultural gap between the acquirer and target...|$|R
