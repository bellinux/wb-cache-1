25|$|In Russia {{the first}} planned city was St. Petersburg founded in 1703 by Peter I. Being {{aware of the}} modern European <b>construction</b> <b>experience</b> which he {{examined}} in the years of his Grand Embassy to Europe, czar ordered Domenico Trezzini to elaborate the first general plan of the city. The project of this architect for Vasilyevsky Island was a typical rectangular grid of streets (originally intended to be canals, like in Amsterdam), with three lengthwise thoroughfares , rectangularly crossed with about 30 crosswise streets.|$|E
25|$|This {{ship was}} {{conceived}} {{as an intermediate}} step between the expensive fleet carriers and the limited-capability escort carriers. The design had to {{be as simple as}} possible so construction time was kept to a minimum and so more shipyards (particularly those with no naval <b>construction</b> <b>experience)</b> could be used. However, the ships had to be capable of operating in fleet actions. Originally designated the 'Intermediate Aircraft Carrier', the ships were reclassified as 'Light Fleet Carriers'. Because naval design staff were overworked, the carrier was primarily designed by shipbuilders at Vickers-Armstrong.|$|E
25|$|With such {{a limited}} time frame to use its budget, the Japanese Navy could not afford the time to design a new ship. Therefore, the {{blueprints}} for the previous Momo-class destroyers were distributed to each shipyard, with the instructions that identical ships be produced, except with sturdier armor and bow <b>construction.</b> <b>Experience</b> with extended overseas deployment in World War I had taught the Japanese Navy that the construction of its destroyers needed to be reinforced to handle heavy seas. The result was a ship which looked physically almost exactly like the Momo class, but was roughly 15 tons heavier in displacement.|$|E

30|$|The adopted mix {{proportions}} {{of the first and}} the secondary phase injection are often predefined according to the test results in advance of tunneling or based on the gained <b>construction</b> <b>experiences.</b> For example, the injection volume of the first phase injection, suggested before crossing, should be changed in light of the shield driving and measured movements of the existing tunnels. The same is true of the parameters of the injection volume, location and frequencies of the secondary phase injection.|$|R
500|$|When Jack upsets Charlie {{by telling}} him to move his guitar, Charlie angrily shouts at him, causing the {{entrance}} of the cave they are in to collapse. Charlie manages to escape, but Jack is trapped inside. Using his <b>construction</b> <b>experience,</b> Michael Dawson (Harold Perrineau) leads the rescue attempt with Steve Jenkins (Christian Bowman) and Scott Jackson (Dustin Watchman). In the jungle, James [...] "Sawyer" [...] Ford (Josh Holloway) goes to tell Kate (who is traveling to set up her antenna for the triangulation attempt) about Jack's predicament, but decides against it because he doesn't like Kate's hostile attitude. Charlie tells Locke about Jack's situation, but reveals the real reason for his going to Locke is to ask for his drugs a second time. Locke shows Charlie a moth cocoon, and explains that he could help the moth by slitting the cocoon and letting the moth free, but it would not survive because it would be too weak. Instead, the moth needs to struggle to break free. Nature and struggle make people stronger, Locke says, indicating to Charlie that he needs to fight through his suffering.|$|E
2500|$|All {{undergraduate}} students at Cal Poly {{are required to}} complete a senior project. [...] The senior project {{is intended to be}} a capstone experience for students receiving a baccalaureate degree by integrating theory and application from across a student's undergraduate educational experiences. The senior project consists of {{one or more of the}} following: a design or <b>construction</b> <b>experience,</b> an experiment, a self-guided study or research project, a presentation, a report based on internship, co-op, or service learning experience, and/or a public portfolio display or performance. [...] Senior projects have often led to students obtaining jobs or recognition for their work. In July 2011, a company created from a Senior Project, Punchd, was acquired by Google. Jamba Juice, founded as [...] "Juice Club", was inspired by the Senior Project idea, but was founded after the founders had graduated.|$|E
2500|$|A March 2014 {{report by}} the ANAO heavily criticised the DMO and the AWD Alliance for underestimating the risks in {{redesigning}} the ships for Australian operations, and building them in shipyards with no recent warship <b>construction</b> <b>experience.</b> The ANAO report also criticised designer Navantia and the shipyards involved in block construction over poor drawings, repeated errors, and bad building practices. As a result of further delays and growing costs, the Hobart-class destroyer project {{was added to the}} government's [...] "Projects of Concern" [...] list in June 2014. Follow-up government reports identified unrealistic time and cost estimates as additional factors. The overarching alliance concept has been repeatedly denounced, with no effective management structure or entity in charge, (allowing for repeated blame-passing between the individual alliance partners, Navantia, and the subcontracted shipyards), and the DMO locked in a contradictory role (simultaneously acting as supplier, build partner, and customer).|$|E

40|$|For over {{a hundred}} years the Irish céilí, as an ‘invented’ social dance event and mode of interaction, has played a {{significant}} and changing role. This paper examines the invention of this Irish dance event and how it has developed in Ireland throughout the twentieth century. From the Gaelic League’s cultural nationalist, ideological agenda of the late-nineteenth century, for a culturally unified Ireland, to the manifestation of a new cultural confidence in Ireland, from the 1970 s, this paper explores how the céilí has provided an important site for the <b>construction,</b> <b>experiencing</b> and negotiation of different senses of community and identity...|$|R
30|$|The {{fact that}} certain sectors were {{particularly}} hard hit, with <b>construction</b> <b>experiencing</b> a remarkable collapse, was key: skilled manual workers who might in other circumstances {{have been relatively}} protected were seriously affected, and the gendered nature of the job loss also reflects that sectoral pattern, with men making up a particularly large proportion of employees in the worst-affected sectors. Together, individual characteristics other than industries and occupations were predictors of movements out of employment in the preceding boom years. In contrast, occupation and industry dummies {{appear to be more}} informative as explanatory variables in the bust, lending support to a macroeconomic-type argument to the distribution of job loss during the crisis.|$|R

Salt expansion of saline soil refers to volume expansion by the impact of periodic climate changes in nature.

50|$|The {{transfer}} of the stadium to Wake Forest University began in December 2006, when tentative agreements were put into place to sell the field to the University after a new stadium was constructed in downtown Winston-Salem for the Dash. The sale was completed prior to the 2009 baseball season. The new ballpark's <b>construction</b> <b>experienced</b> various delays. The Dash had hoped to begin the 2009 season at the downtown park, but pushed the date back to mid-season. Wake Forest University accommodated the Dash for {{as much of the}} 2009 season as necessary.

During the shuttle stand-down, construction of the ISS was halted and the science conducted aboard was limited due to the crew size of two. Many changes {{were made to the}} originally planned ISS, even before the Columbia disaster. Modules and other structures were cancelled or replaced and the number of Shuttle flights to the ISS was reduced from previously planned numbers.
