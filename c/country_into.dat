To analyze the impact of institutions on FDI, we separate developing <b>countries</b> <b>into</b> low and lower-middle-income countries, and developed <b>countries</b> <b>into</b> upper-middle and high-income countries. Second, we examine the impact of each indicator of institutional quality on FDI inflows separately for both developing and developed countries. Third, we construct an institutional quality index to study its impact on FDI.|$|R

5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the war, a discontinuous front line ran through southern Finland from west to east, dividing the <b>country</b> <b>into</b> White Finland and Red Finland. The Red Guards controlled the area to the south, including nearly all the major towns and industrial centres, and the largest estates and farms with high numbers of crofters and tenant farmers. The White Army controlled the area to the north, which was predominantly agrarian with small or medium-sized farms and tenant farmers, and where crofters were few, or held a better social position than in the south. Enclaves of the opposing forces existed {{on both sides of the}} front line: within the White area lay the industrial towns of Varkaus, Kuopio, Oulu, Raahe, Kemi and Tornio; within the Red area lay Porvoo, Kirkkonummi and Uusikaupunki. The elimination of these strongholds was a priority for both armies in February 1918.|$|E
5|$|Bánáthy later {{traded for}} milk to give two-year-old Béla and one-year-old László enough protein. As {{extremely}} little food {{was available in}} the camps, in early 1947 his wife's twin sister came from Hungary to take their older two sons back {{to live with the}} older sister. The Pallendal family, Bánáthy's in-laws, was well-educated and relatively wealthy, so they had access to more food than what was available in the camps. They intended to return the Banathy boys to their parents within a year. Beginning in early 1948, when the Cold War ensued, it became virtually impossible for refugees or displaced persons to cross from the border of one <b>country</b> <b>into</b> another, or even from one Occupation Zone to another. The Pallendal family could not return the two boys from behind the Iron Curtain.|$|E
5|$|Even though Johnson {{had been}} given a mandate to take {{military}} action against North Vietnam and their Viet Cong allies in South Vietnam, he hesitated to take further steps to retaliate against North Vietnam. Towards the end of 1964, Johnson {{was in the midst of}} a presidential election and he did not want the U.S. public to believe that he was leading their <b>country</b> <b>into</b> war. Therefore, Johnson decided to wait until after the election, when his presidency was assured, that he would decide on other military moves. Meanwhile, the political situation in South Vietnam continued to worsen; in August 1964, South Vietnamese General Lan Van Phat tried to overthrow General Nguyễn Khánh, but the coup was aborted and Phat handed power to Air Marshal Nguyễn Cao Kỳ, and Generals Nguyễn Chánh Thi and Nguyễn Văn Thiệu. However, on 20 December 1964, Khánh formed a new military junta with Kỳ and Thi and the civilian-led High National Council was subsequently dissolved. Thus, the South Vietnamese Government was once again plunged into chaos.|$|E

It is shown that openness, {{as measured by the}} trade share to GDP, is a threshold variable that can cluster middle-income <b>countries</b> <b>into</b> two distinct regimes that obey di®erent statistical models. Our result suggests that openness may not be as crucial in the growth process of low and high-income countries but it is instrumental in identifying middle-income <b>countries</b> <b>into</b> high and low-growth groups...|$|R

5|$|In 1642 the English Civil War broke out, {{dividing}} the <b>country</b> <b>into</b> the Royalist supporters of Charles, and the Parliamentarians. In {{the aftermath of}} the battle of Edgehill in October, Parliament became concerned that Charles might advance on London. John Venn took control of Windsor Castle with twelve companies of foot soldiers to protect the route along the Thames river, becoming the governor of the castle {{for the duration of the}} war. The contents of St George's Chapel were both valuable and, to many Parliamentary forces, inappropriately high church in style. Looting began immediately: Edward IV's bejewelled coat of mail was stolen; the chapel's organs, windows and books destroyed; the Lady Chapel was emptied of valuables, including the component parts of Henry VIII's unfinished tomb. By the end of the war, some 3580oz (101kg) of gold and silver plate had been looted.|$|E
5|$|In 1793, the Kingdom of Great Britain and the Dutch Republic went to {{war with}} the French Republic, joining the ongoing French Revolutionary Wars.

Although war between Britain and the Batavian Republic had not been declared, the British government sent instructions on 19 January for Batavian shipping to be seized and, in conjunction with Stadtholder William of Orange, living in exile in London, for Batavian colonies to be neutralised in order to deny their use to the French. On 9 February these orders culminated in the outbreak of war between Britain and the Batavian Republic.|$|E

Rising demand for coffee and rubber was fueling a large increase in the Brazilian government's revenue, and the country's legislature voted to devote some of the proceeds to address this naval imbalance.
