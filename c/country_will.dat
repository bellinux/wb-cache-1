30|$|The {{international}} financial crisis has dealt a major {{blow to the}} former pattern of global economic development. The financial crisis proves that the development pattern featuring excessive consumption in countries like the USA is unsustainable and the development pattern of some developing countries and emerging markets, which overly relies on exports to countries featuring excessive consumption, {{will be difficult to}} sustain. The upcoming global economic rebalancing will lead to remarkable changes in the global supply and demand structure. In terms of supply, major developed <b>countries</b> <b>will</b> further promote exports and rejuvenate their domestic manufacturing industries, make efforts to lead technological innovation and development of new industries, and encourage the upgrading of industries. Emerging economies and developing <b>countries</b> <b>will</b> accelerate the development of industries and technologies in which they have comparative advantages. In terms of demand, the factors that stimulated consumption in developed <b>countries</b> <b>will</b> weaken. The citizens in developed <b>countries</b> <b>will</b> change their consumption behavior and increase savings. Therefore, their problems of excessive consumption and insufficient investment will be adjusted with less demand for imports, while developing <b>countries</b> <b>will</b> need to secure other external demand and encourage domestic demand.|$|R
