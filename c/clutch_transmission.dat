40|$|Modeling of {{hydraulic}} <b>clutch</b> <b>transmissions</b> is {{far from}} straightforward due to their nonlinear hybrid dynamics, i. e. switching between three dynamic phases. In this paper we identify a local linear model only for the constrained first phase, based on which a predictive controller is used to track a suitable engagement signal. The robustness of this controller in the latter two phases is guaranteed by making the constraints inactive and pre-tuning the control parameters based on its closed loop formulation and applying robust stability theorem. This controller is then implemented in real-time on a wet-clutch test setup and is shown to achieve optimal engagement...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In modern motor vehicles, {{having a}} {{driveline}} that is optimally designed for each vehicle provides a substantial CO 2 reduction. Different transmission systems such as, for example, manual transmissions, torque-converter <b>transmissions,</b> dual <b>clutch</b> <b>transmissions</b> and hybrid systems, work better with different requirements and vehicle classes. By {{increasing the number}} of gears and the transmission-ratio spread, the engine can run with more fuel efficiency without a loss of driving dynamics. The transmission efficiency itself can be improved by using fuel efficient transmission oil, optimizing the lubrication systems and pumps, improving shifting strategies and optimizing the friction characteristics of gearings, bearings and seals/gaskets [1]...|$|R
40|$|Dual <b>clutch</b> <b>transmissions</b> (DCTs) are {{recognized}} as being suitable for electric drive applications as they can drive with high efficiency and achieve good shifting comfort. A two-speed DCT electric drivetrain is described in this paper, comprised of only two gear pairs and a final drive gear in the two-speed gearbox. The fundamental shifting control algorithm is provided. On the testing rig of University of Technology, Sydney (UTS) powertrain lab, shifting controls and some driving cycle controls were realized. The results demonstrated that the control algorithm functioned well both in transient shifting control process and in the driving cycle conditions...|$|R
