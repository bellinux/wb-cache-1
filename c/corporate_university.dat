30|$|<b>Corporate</b> <b>universities</b> are {{a growing}} {{phenomenon}} in present-day Spanish society. Corporations increasingly depend on knowledge and, {{as an alternative}} to the gaps identified in traditional education, they are creating and strengthening these institutions in order to endow themselves with a type of training that is consistent with their needs, objectives and strategies. This article presents the main results of a study whose aim was to forecast the future role of <b>corporate</b> <b>universities</b> in Spain, a little-studied reality despite its increasing importance. The study objectives were to identify certain aspects of corporate universities’ future evolution (their role in Spanish society, their organisational changes and the challenges posed by ICTs) and to perform a prospective analysis of their relationships with traditional universities (comparative strengths and weaknesses, and future means of collaboration). The research technique used was the Delphi method, applied to a panel of experts formed by the heads of Spanish <b>corporate</b> <b>universities.</b> Besides collecting data on the above-mentioned study objectives, the results confirmed the important role that <b>corporate</b> <b>universities</b> would play in training and knowledge management within the framework of Spanish higher education, even though the participating specialists believed that they would become a complement rather than a direct competitor to traditional universities.|$|R

40|$|About {{seven years}} ago, {{technological}} innovation {{gave rise to}} the e-learning industry and the growth of <b>corporate</b> <b>universities.</b> Early {{in the evolution of the}} industry, <b>corporate</b> <b>universities</b> represented a reasonable deployment of learning technologies. They enabled companies to deliver the right content to target markets (e. g., employees, partners, and customers) and to reduce training costs by substituting technology for labor. Recent trends, however, suggest that human resource (HR) -based <b>corporate</b> <b>universities</b> have lost some of their luster. Chief financial officers (CFOs) and business managers are exercising more influence over the use of learning technologies in core business operations by employing enterprise, organization, and workflow models. In this article, we describe changes in the e-learning industry and <b>corporate</b> <b>universities</b> that serve to embed learning into the explicit activities of the workplace. Evolution of the e-Learning Industry In the late 1990 s, innovations in computer hardware, computer software, and Internet technologies generated a wide array of education products that launched the e-learning industry. The number of vendors that offered software-driven, Web-based digital solutions exploded. Technology vendors aggressively segmented the industry, carving out defensible niches within the traditional production function of education (Exhibit 1). Some vendors introduced course management solutions and synchronous/asynchronous delivery tools to augment the work of instructors (e. g., Blackboard, eCollege, and WebCT). Others offered course-authoring tools (e. g., Trivantis and OutStart/Trainersoft). Countless vendors produced prepackaged course content (e. g., DigitalThink, Mindleaders, SkillSoft, Thomson, and ThinQ) with novel business models (e. g., Dialog...|$|R
