She drew stories of the Sub-Mariner and the Hulk, and the covers or interiors of titles including Iron Man, Conan the Barbarian, Kull the Conqueror, The Cat, and Daredevil.

25|$|In 2002, Carlo Maniquiz and Nick Tuason, {{together}} {{with the assistance of}} FUBU's headquarters in New York City, established the FUBU Philippines clothing line, opening up several stores in the Philippines.

Francis M would also go on to form his own clothing line in 2006 called Francis Magalona Clothing Company (FMCC) which are sold at his own branches of stores called Three Stars & a Sun.

500|$|For example, the {{steering}} column on Kitenge's Land Rover {{is placed on}} the right side of the car. At one point in the episode, the Simpsons visit the Maasai people, a Nilotic ethnic group of semi-nomadic people located in Kenya and northern Tanzania. The way that some of the Maasai people in the episode are dancing is also true to a traditional dance performed by Maasai people in real life, and although the drinking of cow blood is faithful to the Maasai people's culture, the use of lip plates and neck rings are not. [...] "That was kind of fun for me to try to make this stuff [...] as <b>crazy</b> <b>as</b> the story is, [...] make it realistic", Kirkland commented on directing the episode.|$|E

Nordby stated:Stage one is beautiful Jennifer and then two and three were strictly makeup where her eyes become more recessed and she would start to look plain like the rest of us. And stage four was some custom dentures that KNB made for her, and then visual effects in stage four was mainly facial warping and recessing her eyes some more and having a pinning effect to her irises {{and a variety of other}} musculature deforms, just bringing her cheek bones down more. And stage five was the full on, as <b>crazy</b> <b>as</b> it gets, which you don't really see until near the end.|$|E
500|$|Langford from AfterElton praised Mercedes' part in Lynsey's murder storyline, {{saying he}} was [...] "loving" [...] Metcalfe as [...] "scheming Mercedes". He commented {{that he did not}} believe Mercedes killed Lynsey because [...] "as <b>crazy</b> <b>as</b> Mercedes is, I don’t think she’s a killer, but {{watching}} her benefit from Lynsey’s murder by worming her way back into Riley’s life has been delicious to watch". Langford said that he was [...] "loving the dysfunctional affair between Mercedes and the bad Dr. Browning. Their scenes are hot and they are so suited for each other. The games they play with each other are a hoot". He later added that Mercedes and Doctor Browning have [...] "blistering" [...] chemistry, saying that he is perfect for a [...] "twisted girl like Mercedes. I loved their scenes — they were hot, hot, hot. I really thought they made a delicious and fun couple. But now it’s all ruined with Browning being a killer". Morgan of All About Soap felt that Doctor Browning's act of killing of Lynsey [...] "was a crime of passion, but there’s no way Mercy is worth killing for". Morgan later questioned why Mitzeee did not [...] "just finish the job?!" [...] when she threatened Mercedes with a knife.|$|E
500|$|Discussing the {{workplace}} flirtation between Will and Emma, Gilsig deemed Terri [...] "a woman of conviction", {{willing to do}} [...] "whatever it takes" [...] to keep Will from leaving her, [...] "even if that means finding this woman and hunting her down". She explained that Will and Terri's communication is weak and that Terri is [...] "missing {{a lot of the}} skills for the marriage", and commented that Terri feels threatened by Will's commitment to the glee club, worried that it will pull him away from her. Gilsig characterized Terri as emotionally still being in high school, and explained: [...] "I think Terri still lives in that world, where I can move the pieces in such a way to create a picture, and that will make it real. I don't think she's learned that you can actually just have open conversations and talk about your fears and ask for your needs to be met in a direct, compassionate way. I think she's still in high school and thinking whatever you do, just don't let anybody know that you don't know what you're doing." [...] Discussing Terri's relationship with her sister Kendra, Gilsig commented: [...] "When Kendra tells Terri to do something, Terri does it. As <b>crazy</b> <b>as</b> Terri might be, she's actually pretty normal in the face of her sister. This [...] is Kendra's brainchild, and she just trusts her implicitly." ...|$|E

500|$|Writers for Famitsu {{praised the}} mix of {{seriousness}} and comedy, and liked the characters' quirkiness and the pacing of the conversations. John Walker at Eurogamer called the game [...] "splendidly <b>crazy</b> <b>as</b> ever" [...] and [...] "the most joyfully daft fun imaginable". Tom East at Official Nintendo Magazine called the script fantastic. Joe Juba at Game Informer found the game entertaining, calling the writing hilarious and the problem-solving clever, with the two aspects complimenting each other well. Aaron Thomas at GameSpot liked the game, praising the game's story and calling the characters its greatest strength. He thought that the pacing {{was better than the}} first Ace Attorneys, but still found the game to be a step back: he felt that the game often reuses the same kinds of twists from the first. Gerald Villoria at GameSpy called the episodes well structured and stronger than the ones in first game, and called the dialogue sharp. Mikel Reparaz at GamesRadar said that the script, while entertaining, contains [...] "long stretches of meaningless dialogue" [...] and tends to leave the player knowing what happened and how to prove it before Phoenix does. He initially liked the new rival character Franziska, but thought that she only becomes increasingly obnoxious. Craig Harris at IGN said that the episodes are well written, with enthusiasm and personality, making them hard to put down.|$|E
500|$|... "Harvest Festival" [...] {{received}} critical acclaim. New York magazine writer Steve Kandell {{called it}} the most pivotal episode {{of the season in}} terms of [...] "resolving and resetting narrative stakes", as well as the most complex from a production perspective. Kandell wrote, [...] "There's something that feels particularly satisfying about watching a wholly sympathetic, albeit fictional, character like Leslie Knope do well by her own ambition and by her friends." [...] Entertainment Weekly writer Ken Tucker said the episode placed Parks and Recreation [...] "squarely in the tradition of great gentle-hearted sitcoms" [...] that treated its characters [...] "with equal affection, and has relatively little patience for irony and cool detachment". He praised Amy Poehler's performance, and enjoyed how the characters' excitement over Li'l Sebastian demonstrated how [...] "in some parts of this great land, there are people who aren’t jaded, who are open to wonderment, who find vessels in which to pour their joy". HitFix writer Alan Sepinwall said [...] "Harvest Festival" [...] may be his favorite episode of the season thus far, and demonstrates how the series has evolved. While in the first season he said Leslie was too over-the-top in a relatively ordinary setting, Sepinwall said this episode showed Parks and Recreation [...] "has successfully made the rest of Pawnee seem as believably <b>crazy</b> <b>as</b> Leslie, if not moreso". TV Squad television reviewer Maureen Ryan called [...] "Harvest Festival" [...] a [...] "delightful, comedically deft episode, one that depicts the mildly demented world of Pawnee in loving detail".|$|E
500|$|In {{a review}} for The Wall Street Journal, Joe Morgenstern {{described}} Like <b>Crazy</b> <b>as</b> a [...] "wise and beautiful little film", giving particular praise to Guleserian's cinematography and Yelchin and Jones's improvised performances. David Edelstein of New York magazine claimed that Like Crazy was [...] "the most infectious love story in decades", comparing its [...] "wonderfully sane" [...] perspective to other romance films and romantic comedies. Entertainment Weekly Lisa Schwarzbaum gave the film an A– grade and praised Doremus, Yelchin and Felicity Jones's storytelling ability in creating [...] "a palpably real, universally identifiable manifestation of young love {{in all its}} ecstasy and agony". In a review for Rolling Stone, Peter Travers gave the film 3.5 out of 4 stars, writing that [...] "Drake Doremus has crafted a crazily inventive and totally irresistible tale of first love that makes the familiar seem bittersweet and heart-stoppingly new". He described Felicity Jones as [...] "a marvel" [...] and Yelchin as [...] "outstanding". Time magazine's Mary Pols commended the film's ambiguous ending and wrote, [...] "Like Crazy is a cinematic love potion and you leave it feeling bewitched." [...] Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film 3 out of 4 stars, praising Jones and Yelchin's performances and the [...] "intelligent, graceful indie style" [...] of the film, although he found the storyline somewhat unrealistic. Indiewire's Eric Kohn gave the film a B+ grade and felt that while the plot developed slowly, Yelchin and Jones shared [...] "an indelible and entirely realistic chemistry". Variety film critic Andrew Barker, who described the film as [...] "an exquisite, beautifully acted gem", gave particular praise to the film's [...] "dexterous editing", given that it [...] "contains nary an extraneous detail, while still managing to luxuriate in the tender and awkward silences of young love".|$|E

But one has to apply to be excused, and applying demonstrates that one is not <b>crazy.</b> <b>As</b> a result, one must continue flying, either not applying to be excused, or applying and being refused.

Critics agree that the show is improved in that it makes much more sense, however, now they mostly find it a bore.

2500|$|Det. Chris Gordon Skelton (Jonathan Murphy) — A young junior detective.

[...] Such polls have been taken at other conferences, for example, in response to Sean Carroll's observation, [...] "As <b>crazy</b> <b>as</b> it sounds, most working physicists buy into the many-worlds theory" [...] Michael Nielsen counters: [...] "at a quantum computing conference at Cambridge in 1998, a many-worlder surveyed the audience of approximately 200 people... Many-worlds did just fine, garnering support on a level comparable to, but somewhat below, Copenhagen and decoherence." [...] However, Nielsen notes that it seemed most attendees found it to be a waste of time: Asher Peres [...] "got a huge and sustained round of applause… when he got {{up at the end of}} the polling and asked 'And who here believes the laws of physics are decided by a democratic vote?'" ...|$|E
