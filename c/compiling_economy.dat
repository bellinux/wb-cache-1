40|$|At {{the first}} meeting of the BOPTEG in June 2004, the issue of the {{treatment}} of merchanting was discussed based on the issues paper BOPTEG # 16. No clear view emerged on the treatment of merchanting. Therefore, the group decided to put this issue at the agenda for the next BOPTEG meeting and IMF volunteered to prepare an issues paper. This issues paper was prepared to facilitate further discussion. I. Current international standards for the treatment of the issue Balance of Payments Manual, 5 th Edition (BPM 5) 1 Merchanting is defined as the purchase of a good by a resident (of the <b>compiling</b> <b>economy)</b> from a nonresident and the subsequent resale of the good to another nonresident; during the process, the good does not enter or leave the <b>compiling</b> <b>economy.</b> The difference between the value of goods when acquired and the value when sold is recorded as the value of merchanting services provided (para 262). If the commodities are not resold by the merchant in the same accounting period, an import of goods is recorded in the first period, and a negative import entry is recorded in the later period. In the case that a merchanting transaction straddles different recording periods, changes from one recording period to another in the stocks of goods located abroad and valued at acquisition cost constitute part of goods of the economy of the owner (para 213, 262). In either situation, any difference between the value of the goods when acquired and relinquished is entered as merchanting under other business services (para 213) ...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{business}} {{environment in the}} company covers economic, political, institutional, legal, technological and cultural conditions in which business process is implemented, ie, process of forming enterprises, and the implementation of their business activities. The quality of the {{business environment}} creates an elementary precondition for sustainable growth and long-term competitiveness of each global market economy. It creates the basic conditions {{for the development of}} small and medium-sized enterprises. in The Last decade, in different countries many organizations concerned with measuring the quality of the business environment on the basis of different parameters have been created. Then <b>compile</b> rankings of <b>economies</b> and comparison of the positions of the countries at different time period. Indexes provide important information on the development of individual components of the competitiveness of countries. The article is the comparison {{of the quality of the}} business environment Visegrad countries, since these are with similar initial condition, with particular attention to the Slovak Republic. Countries will compared by two local indexes and four global indexes. The article will also determine the results of questionnaire on the quality of the business environment and the quality changes in the business environment of the Slovak Republic...|$|R

The model is of the walrasian static multisectorial kind, and it is calibrated by using a 1995 Social Accounting Matrix of the Spanish <b>economy</b> <b>compiled</b> {{using data from the}} NIPA and other sources. A relevant trait of the model is that in equilibrium all markets clear {{with the possible exception of}} the labor market. We consider a counterfactual scenario in which an ecotax is leviedon the intermediate and final use of energy goods. Under a revenue neutral assumption, we evaluate the impact of recycling ecotaxes towards lower labor taxes. We find that a double dividend can be achieved, under such policy, for the economy. That is, a better environmental quality, as measured by a reduction in CO 2 emissions, an improved level for employment, and a gain in private welfare. To appraise to what extent the model structure and behavioral assumptions may influence the results, we perform simulations under a broad range of policy and model scenarios. Particularly, we contemplate different assumptionson consumers labor supply and on substitution between the two production factors, labor and capital services. Double dividend, tax recycling, ecotaxes, computable general equilibrium. ...|$|R

Summary Water Account, Australia presents {{information on}} the physical and monetary supply and use of water in the Australian <b>economy,</b> <b>compiled</b> in accordance with the System of Environmental-Economic Accounting (SEEA). Water Account, Australia also provides {{information on the}} water use and consumptive practices of key industries (2 ̆ 7 Agriculture 2 ̆ 7, 2 ̆ 7 Water Supply, Sewerage and Drainage Services 2 ̆ 7) and households. During 2013 - 14 an estimated 92, 237 GL of water was extracted from the environment to support the Australian economy, as shown in Diagram 1. 1. Of this amount, 12, 979 GL was extracted (largely by the 2 ̆ 7 Water Supply, Sewerage and Drainage Services 2 ̆ 7 industry (12, 881 GL)) for distribution (supply) to industry and households. Of the 79, 258 GL of water self-extracted for own use by industry and households, the 2 ̆ 7 Electricity and Gas Supply 2 ̆ 7 industry extracted 73, 856 GL. The majority of this water was used for hydro-electricity generation, which is a non-consumptive use. Total water consumption in 2013 - 14 was 18, 644 GL. Of this, 16, 772 GL was consumed by industry and 1, 872 GL by households...|$|R
40|$|This {{volume is}} {{the outcome of}} three years of work by the Centre {{international}} de recherches et d’information sur l’economie publique, sociale et coopérative (CIRIEC), specifically its Working Group on Methods and Indicators of Evaluation of the Social <b>Economy.</b> <b>Compiled</b> by Marie Bouchard, Canada Research Chair on the Social Economy at the Université du Québec à Montréal, who also served as the coordinator of the Working Group, the authors of individual chapters are all heavy-hitters in the social economy field. The {{first part of the}} book provides theoretical overviews of the topic under the heading of “Conceptual Frameworks, ” and the second part provides national case studies of trends, practices, policies, laws, and the like from seven countries—France, Québec (Canada), the United Kingdom, the United States, Brazil, Portugal, and Japan. Ms. Bouchard has written the introduction and co-authored, with N. Richez-Battesti, the concluding essay. In part, the intention throughout is to address a gap identified in previous studies: that is, information on how evaluations should be conducted, but not much on how evaluations are being accomplished in practice and on the norms embedded therein. In addition to the customary discussion of definitional issues surrounding the social economy, the Working Group’s important framework for examining evaluation in the sector is provided by Bouchard in her opening contribution to the first section of the book. While the group readily admits that their survey is not exhaustive...|$|R
30|$|This article {{proposes a}} {{solution}} to a particular problem that became apparent {{in the course of}} applying the World Trade Model (Duchin [2005]), a linear programming input-output model of the world economy based on comparative advantage subject to resource constraints, to a new environmentally extended input-output database of the <b>economy</b> <b>compiled</b> from many sources at an unprecedented level of detail (EXIOBASE). While the problem is more general, it is readily explained by considering only the square (or ‘symmetric’) input-output tables representing the economies of the diverse countries and regions of the world. A typical requirement for databases of the world economy is that all tables have the same number n of sectors and that the sectors be defined in comparable ways. Comparability is required to assure the consistency between quantities of goods produced in and exported from the economies of origin and the corresponding imports into the destination economies. The implicit underlying assumption is that every region produces all n outputs, and each output is produced in a given region using a single, average input structure. Thus, if n sectors are {{to be included in the}} database, every region will be represented by an input-output matrix, A, with n columns and n rows. However, it is not evident what to put in those columns and rows if the original input-output table for this region does not identify the corresponding sectors, either because their products are not produced and possibly not even consumed in that region or because they were aggregated in that region’s table with other sectors.|$|R
