500|$|Ratanakiri Province {{was created}} in 1959 from land {{that had been the}} eastern area of Stung Treng Province. The name Ratanakiri (រតនគិរី) is formed from the Khmer words រតនៈ (ratana [...] "gem" [...] from Sanskrit ratna) and គិរី (kiri [...] "mountain" [...] from Sanskrit giri), {{describing}} two features for which the province is known. During the 1950s and 1960s, Norodom Sihanouk instituted a development and Khmerization campaign in northeast Cambodia that was designed to bring villages under government <b>control,</b> <b>limit</b> the influence of insurgents in the area, and [...] "modernize" [...] indigenous communities. Some Khmer Loeu were forcibly moved to the lowlands to be educated in Khmer language and culture, ethnic Khmer from elsewhere in Cambodia were moved into the province, and roads and large rubber plantations were built. After facing harsh working conditions and sometimes involuntary labor on the plantations, many Khmer Loeu left their traditional homes and moved farther from provincial towns. In 1968, tensions led to an uprising by the Brao in which several Khmer were killed. The government responded harshly, torching settlements and killing hundreds of villagers.|$|E

An alternative proposal to use <b>control</b> <b>limits</b> narrower than three sigma <b>control</b> <b>limits</b> is made.

Comparing the average run lengths of EWMA with time-varying <b>control</b> <b>limits</b> and results previously obtained for asymptotic EWMA charts shows that using time-varying <b>control</b> <b>limits</b> {{is akin to}} the fast initial response (FIR) feature suggested for Cumulative Sum (CUSUM) charts.
