50|$|SEBO was {{established}} in 1978 by two German engineers, Klaus Stein and Heinz Kaulig, who were seeking to build a reliable, powerful {{and easy to use}} commercial upright vacuum cleaner. Klaus Stein had previously worked at Vorwerk, the manufacturer of the Kobold vacuum cleaner since 1929. The first SEBO factory was located in Dannenberg, West Germany in a disused weaving factory where they developed in 1978 the SEBO 350 upright <b>commercial</b> <b>vacuum</b> <b>cleaner.</b>|$|E
40|$|Under a Space Act Agreement {{between the}} Kirby company and Lewis Research Center, NASA {{technology}} {{was applied to}} a <b>commercial</b> <b>vacuum</b> <b>cleaner</b> product line. Kirby engineers were interested in advanced operational concepts, such as particle flow behavior and vibration, critical factors to improve vacuum cleaner performance. An evaluation of the company 1994 home care system, the Kirby G 4, led to the refinement of the new G 5 and future models. Under the cooperative agreement, Kirby had access to Lewis' holography equipment, which added insight into how long a vacuum cleaner fan would perform, as well as advanced computer software that can simulate the flow of air through fans. The collaboration resulted in several successes including fan blade redesign and continuing dialogue {{on how to improve}} air-flow traits in various nozzle designs...|$|E
40|$|This {{data set}} {{contains}} {{information about the}} functional structure (overall biomass; abundance of consumers: in different habitat strata; of different food resource specialization, feeding strategies and aerial mobility) of aboveground consumers (herbivores, carnivores, omnivores and decomposers) per plots from a grassland plant diversity experiment (the Jena Experiment; Roscher et al. 2004). The experiment was established in 2002, and consists of 80 grassland plots. Plots vary in plant species richness (1, 2, 4, 8, 16, or 60 species). All plots are mown twice per year, and weeded three times per year to maintain the experimental diversity gradient. We collected ground-associated arthropods over 125 days from May until September 2010 using two pitfall traps of 4. 5 cm diameter per plot. During the sampling periods, the field traps were filled with 3 % formalin and after emptying the traps, animals were stored in 70 % ethanol. Vegetation-associated arthropods were collected by suction sampling in early June and August (during the peak biomass of the plant communities) using a modified <b>commercial</b> <b>vacuum</b> <b>cleaner.</b> We randomly chose three subplots of 0. 75 m x 0. 75 m within each plot, covered them with a gauze cage of the same size, and sampled arthropods by vacuuming {{the inside of the}} cages until we spotted no arthropods anymore. Samples were identified to species level, except for Hymenoptera, which were identified to the level of family or subfamily. We pooled data of all sampling campaigns in 2010 and standardized the resulting abundances between zero and one, separately for pitfall and suction sampling to account for different sampling intensities between the two methods (Hertzog et al. 2016). We focused on species that we sampled more than once during the whole vegetation period...|$|E

25|$|A <b>vacuum</b> <b>cleaner</b> uses {{a partial}} vacuum to suck up dust and dirt, usually from floors. Daniel Hess of West Union, Iowa, invented the first <b>vacuum</b> <b>cleaner</b> in 1860. Calling it a carpet sweeper {{instead of a}} <b>vacuum</b> <b>cleaner,</b> his machine did, in fact, have a {{rotating}} brush like a traditional <b>vacuum</b> <b>cleaner</b> which also possessed an elaborate bellows mechanism {{on top of the}} body to generate suction of dust and dirt. Hess received a patent (U.S. patent #29,077) for his invention of the first <b>vacuum</b> <b>cleaner</b> on July 10, 1860. Despite credit usually going to English inventor Hubert Cecil Booth for inventing the first electric <b>vacuum</b> <b>cleaner</b> in 1901, his vacuum was actually predated two years by an American, John Thurman of St. Louis, Missouri, who invented the motorized <b>vacuum</b> <b>cleaner</b> in 1899. However, neither were practical or useful. The first practical and portable <b>vacuum</b> <b>cleaner</b> was built in 1907, when James Murray Spangler, a janitor from Canton, Ohio, incorporated a rotating brush, an electric fan, a box, and one of his wife's pillowcases to serve as the dust bag.|$|R

We performed a randomized field study {{to determine whether a}} conventional (non-HEPA) <b>vacuum</b> <b>cleaner</b> could achieve cleaning results comparable with those of a HEPA <b>vacuum</b> <b>cleaner.</b> We compared the lead loading reductions of these two <b>vacuum</b> <b>cleaners</b> in a total of 127 New Jersey homes of lead-exposed children. We used wet towelettes and a vacuum sampler to collect lead dust from carpets and upholstery before and after vacuum cleaning. The vacuum sampling data showed that the HEPA and non-HEPA <b>vacuum</b> <b>cleaners</b> resulted in 54. 7 % (p = 0. 006) and 36. 4 % (p = 0. 020) reductions in lead loading, respectively, when used on soiled carpets, although the overall difference in lead loading reduction between the two <b>vacuum</b> <b>cleaners</b> was not statistically significant (p = 0. 293).

5000|$|Many <b>vacuum</b> <b>cleaners</b> {{also use}} HEPA filters {{as part of}} their {{filtration}} systems. This is beneficial for asthma and allergy sufferers, because the HEPA filter traps the fine particles (such as pollen and dust mite feces) which trigger allergy and asthma symptoms. For a HEPA filter in a <b>vacuum</b> <b>cleaner</b> to be effective, the <b>vacuum</b> <b>cleaner</b> must be designed so that all the air drawn into the machine is expelled through the filter, with none of the air leaking past it. This {{is often referred to as}} [...] "Sealed HEPA" [...] or sometimes the more vague [...] "True HEPA". <b>Vacuum</b> <b>cleaners</b> simply labeled [...] "HEPA" [...] may have a HEPA filter, but not all air necessarily passes through it. Finally, <b>vacuum</b> <b>cleaner</b> filters marketed as [...] "HEPA-like" [...] will typically use a filter of a similar construction to HEPA, but without the filtering efficiency. Because of the extra density of a true HEPA filter, HEPA <b>vacuum</b> <b>cleaners</b> require more powerful motors to provide adequate cleaning power.|$|R

40|$|<b>Vacuum</b> <b>cleaners</b> {{are widely}} used {{household}} appliances and they usually generate quite unpleasant sound. The four most common sources of <b>vacuum</b> <b>cleaner</b> noise are the motor, the fan, the airflow and the surface vibrations.
