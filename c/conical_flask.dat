50|$|An Erlenmeyer flask, {{also known}} as a <b>conical</b> <b>flask</b> (BrE) or {{titration}} flask, is a type of laboratory flask which features a flat bottom, a conical body, and a cylindrical neck. It is named after the German chemist Emil Erlenmeyer (1825-1909), who created it in 1860.|$|E
50|$|One way {{to achieve}} this is to heat a <b>conical</b> <b>flask</b> {{containing}} {{a small amount of}} clean solvent on a hot plate. A filter funnel is rested on the mouth, and hot solvent vapors keep the stem warm. Jacketed filter funnels may also be used. The filter paper is preferably fluted, rather than folded into a quarter; this allows quicker filtration, thus less opportunity for the desired compound to cool and crystallize from the solution.|$|E

The body cavity of Inaria was a single chamber with the inner surface of the body wall forming deep invaginations that partitioned the cavernous stomach into several septa.

This mixture was later added to 200 ml of warmed (preheated) neem oil inside a 500 -ml <b>conical</b> <b>flask</b> and placed on a magnetic stirrer with heater, continuously stirred, for 1 h for the acid transesterification to take place.

40|$|AbstractThe {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} and compare the use of liquid and solid Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium in different culture vessels for mass production of Catharanthus roseus, an important source of anticancerous compounds, vincristine and vinblastine. Three media conditions i. e. agar-solidified medium (S), liquid medium in agitated <b>conical</b> <b>flask</b> (L) and growtek bioreactor (B) were used. Rapid propagation was achieved through in vitro somatic embryogenesis pathway. The process of embryogenesis has been categorized into induction, proliferation, maturation and germination stages. All in vitro embryogenesis stages were conducted by withdrawing spent liquid medium and by adding fresh MS medium. In optimized 4. 52 μM 2, 4 -D added MS, the callus biomass growth was low in solid (1. 65 g) compared to liquid medium in agitated <b>conical</b> <b>flask</b> (1. 95 g) and in bioreactor (2. 11 g). The number of normal somatic embryos was more in solid medium (99. 75 / 50 mg of callus mass) compared to liquid medium used in <b>conical</b> <b>flask</b> (83. 25 /callus mass) and growtek bioreactor (84. 88 /callus mass). The in vitro raised embryos maturated in GA 3 (2. 60 μM) added medium; and in bioreactor the embryo growth was high, a maximum length of 9. 82 mm was observed at the end of four weeks. These embryos germinated into seedlings in BAP (2. 22 μM) added medium and the embryo germination ability was more (59. 41 %) in bioreactor compared to liquid medium in <b>conical</b> <b>flask</b> (55. 5 %). Shoot length (11. 25 mm) was also high in bioreactor compared to agitated <b>conical</b> <b>flask.</b> The liquid medium used in agitated <b>conical</b> <b>flask</b> and bioreactor increased seedling production efficiency, at the same time it also reduced plant recovery time. The embryo generated plants grew normally in outdoor conditions. The exploitation of medium to large culture vessel or bioreactor may make the process more efficient in getting large number of Catharanthus plant as it is the only source of anti-cancerous alkaloids, vincristine and vinblastine...|$|E
30|$|The nAg@PSA 4 {{suspension}} (containing 1.3538 [*]mg Ag) was {{filtered through}} a glass sand funnel equipped with filter <b>conical</b> <b>flask,</b> deposited on a filter paper, and washed with distilled water (100 [*]mL). The 10 [*]mL of solution (36 [*]mM NaBH 4 and 0.12 [*]mM 4 -NP) was subjected to vacuum filtration in the funnel covered by the nAg@PSA 4 membrane. The collected solution in the <b>conical</b> <b>flask</b> was characterized with UV-Vis spectroscopy. To evaluate the reusability of the nAg@PSA 4 catalyst, the membrane was washed with distilled water and reused.|$|E
30|$|Different {{concentrations}} of HCl (0.05, 0.1, 0.2  M) were contacted with the Mn(II) or Fe(II) presorbed adsorbent in different <b>conical</b> <b>flasks</b> and each suspension was equilibrated at different time intervals (10, 20, 30, 60 and 120  min). After equilibration, the mixtures were filtered and filtrates were analyzed {{for the amount}} of Mn(II) and Fe(II) in the solution. A graph of the percentage desorbed was plotted against time.|$|R
30|$|The batch {{equilibrium}} {{experiments were}} made in Pyrex 125  mL glass <b>conical</b> <b>flasks</b> with stoppers. Different sets of these flasks were used for every adsorbate. To every flask containing 50  mL of the required adsorbate concentration (5 – 60  mg/L), 1  g of adsorbent was added. The mixture was agitated at room temperature (25  °C) for 12  h. The solutions were filtered and the final concentration was determined by spectrophotometer.|$|R
30|$|The {{effect of}} pH on Cu 2 +, Pb 2 +, and Cd 2 + {{adsorption}} was investigated over the pH range from 3.0 [*]±[*] 0.1 to 7.0 [*]±[*] 0.1. In a typical procedure, the adsorption experiments of Cu 2 +, Pb 2 +, and Cd 2 + {{were carried out}} {{in a series of}} <b>conical</b> <b>flasks</b> containing 0.1  g of c-MCM- 41 (40) and 100  mL of Cu 2 +, Pb 2 +, and Cd 2 + solutions of 40  mg/L. The pH was adjusted to the desired value by HCl (0.1  M) or NaOH (0.1  M), and the pH values were measured by a pH meter (OHAUS Starter 3 C, China). Then, the <b>conical</b> <b>flasks</b> were continuously stirred at 25  °C for 24  h. After reaching adsorption equilibrium, the suspended adsorbent was easily collected from the aqueous solution by centrifugation at a speed of 5000  rpm for 5  min. Then, the supernatant was filtered with a syringe filter of 0.22  μm and analyzed via an AAS spectrophotometer after appropriate dilution.|$|R
