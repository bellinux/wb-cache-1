The aim of this study was to evaluate the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) profiles of <b>cefquinome</b> against an experimental catheter-related biofilm model due to S. aureus, including three clinical isolates and one non-clinical isolate. The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC), minimal biofilm inhibitory concentration (MBIC), biofilm bactericidal concentration (BBC), minimal biofilm eradication concentration (MBEC) and biofilm prevention concentration (BPC) and in vitro time-kill curves of <b>cefquinome</b> were studied in both planktonic and biofilm cells of study S. aureus strains. The in vivo post-antibiotic effects (PAEs), PK profiles and efficacy of <b>cefquinome</b> were performed in the catheter-related biofilm infection model in murine. A sigmoid Emax model was utilized to determine the PK/PD index that best described the dose-response profiles in the model. The MICs and MBICs of <b>cefquinome</b> for the four S. aureus strains were 0. 5 and 16 μg/mL, respectively. The BBCs (32 - 64 μg/mL) and MBECs (64 - 256 μg/mL) of these study strains were much higher than their corresponding BPC values (1 - 2 μg/mL). <b>Cefquinome</b> showed time-dependent killing both on planktonic and biofilm cells, but produced much shorter PAEs in biofilm infections. The best-correlated PK/PD parameters of <b>cefquinome</b> for planktonic and biofilm cells were the duration of time that the free drug level exceeded the MIC (fT>MIC, R 2 = 96. 2 %) and the MBIC (fT>MBIC, R 2 = 94. 7 %), respectively.

METHODS <b>Cefquinome</b> was administered i. v. at 1 mg/kg bwt twice a day (q. 12 h), 1 mg/kg bwt 3 times a day (q. 8 h) or 4. 5 mg/kg bwt q. 12 h to each age group (n = 6). Plasma <b>cefquinome</b> concentrations were analysed using high-performance liquid chromatography combined with electrospray tandem mass spectrometry. RESULTS Both foal age groups had comparable pharmacokinetic data except for the volume of distribution at a steady-state (Vss), total body clearance (CIB) and mean residence time (MRT).

A multi-centered, nonblinded, randomized, positive-controlled clinical trial was conducted in 5 European countries-France, Hungary, Italy, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom-to study the efficacy of an extended intramammary <b>cefquinome</b> treatment (5 d) compared with a standard intramammary <b>cefquinome</b> treatment (1. 5 d) of Staph. aureus clinical mastitis. Least squares means estimates of bacteriological cure during lactation were 34 % [standard error (SE). = 9. 9 %] for the standard treatment group and 27 % (SE. = 8. 4 %) for the extended treatment group. In the final model, extended therapy was not significantly better. The only factor predicting bacteriological cure was pretreatment cow somatic cell count (SCC). Cows with > 250, 000 cells/mL in milk before treatment {{were less likely to}} cure. Least squares means of clinical cure during lactation was 60 % (SE. = 19 %) for the standard treatment group and 82 % (SE. = 12 %) for the extended treatment group. In the final model, clinical cure after extended treatment was significantly better. Pretreatment cow udder firmness predicted clinical cure. Firm udders were less likely to cure clinically. Irrespective of treatment regimen, new infection rates with pathogens other than Staph. aureus were higher (42 %) after bacteriological cure than after nonbacteriological cure (22 %) and cured cows had a significantly lower SCC. In conclusion, independent of the treatment protocol, cows with an SCC < 250, 000. cells/mL before treatment showed a higher probability of bacteriological cure. It appears that successful treatment of clinical Staph. aureus mastitis with <b>cefquinome</b> is associated with an increased number of new infections with coagulase-negative staphylococci. Extended treatment improved clinical, but not bacteriological, cure rates compared with the standard treatment. These results indicate that extending treatment of clinical Staph. aureus mastitis with <b>cefquinome</b> should not be recommended. © 2013 American Dairy Science Association...|$|E
40|$|This work {{aimed to}} {{characterize}} the mammary gland pharmacokinetics of <b>cefquinome</b> after an intramammary administration and integrate pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic model. The pharmacokinetic profiles of <b>cefquinome</b> in gland tissue were measured using high performance liquid chromatograph. Therapeutic regimens covered various dosages ranging from 25 to 800 μg/gland and multiple dosing intervals of 8, 12, and 24 h. The in vivo bacterial killing activity elevated when dosage increased or when dosing intervals were shortened. The best antibacterial effect was demonstrated by a mean 1. 5 log 10 CFU/gland visible count reduction. On the other hand, {{the results showed that}} the percentage of time duration of drug concentration exceeding the MIC during a dose interval (%T > MIC) was generally 100 % because of the influence of drug distribution caused by the blood-milk barrier. Therefore, pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic parameter of the ratio of area under the concentration-time curve over 24 h to the MIC (AUC 0 - 24 /MIC) was used to describe the efficacy of <b>cefquinome</b> instead of %T > MIC. When the magnitude of AUC 0 - 24 /MIC exceeding 16571. 55 h•mL/g, considerable activity of about 1. 5 log 10 CFU/g gland bacterial count reduction was observed in vivo. Based on the Monte Carlo simulation, the clinical recommended regimen of three infusions of 75 mg per quarter every 12 h can achieve a 76. 67 % cure rate in clinical treatment of bovine mastitis caused by Staphylococcus aureus infection...|$|E
40|$|Extended {{duration}} of clinical mastitis (CM) treatment has been advocated, although results showing its higher efficacy compared with standard treatment {{are difficult to}} compare and seem conflicting. In a non-blinded, positively controlled clinical trial with systematic allocation, the efficacy of a standard, 1 · 5 -d <b>cefquinome</b> treatment (ST), and an extended, 5 -d intramammary <b>cefquinome</b> treatment (ET) were evaluated. The latter is frequently performed in cows with persistent high somatic cell count (SCC), expecting a better cure. Therefore, cows with CM immediately preceded by at least two consecutive monthly elevated SCC > 200 000 cells/ml, were studied. The primary efficacy criteria were bacteriological cure (BC) and clinical cure (CC), while SCC cure was considered a secondary criterion of cure. Least square means of overall BC were not different after ET (79 %, n= 206) compared with ST (72 %, n= 203). ET, as compared with ST, improved BC of CM when caused by streptococci, specifically Streptococcus uberis. At day 1 · 5, only 13 % of quarters showed CC, increasing significantly towards 60 % at day 5, and 99 % at day 14 and at day 21. No significant difference in CC was present between treatment groups. Overall SCC cure was low (22 %) and not significantly different between treatment groups, but significantly higher for cases due to enterobacteriacae compared with staphylococci. In conclusion, ET with <b>cefquinome</b> of CM in cows with a persistent high SCC seems to be only indicated when caused by streptococci, mainly Str. uberis but shows no advantage when no information on bacteriological causes of mastitis is available. In our data, absence of CC directly after ST {{was not related to}} eventual BC...|$|E
40|$|The {{combination}} of efficacious treatment against bacterial infections and mitigation of antibiotic resistance amplification in gut microbiota {{is a major}} challenge for antimicrobial therapy in food-producing animals. In rats, we evaluated the impact of <b>cefquinome,</b> a fourth-generation cephalosporin, on both Klebsiella pneumoniae lung infection and intestinal flora harboring CTX-M-producing Enterobacteriaceae. Germfree rats received a fecal flora specimen from specific-pathogen-free pigs, to which a CTX-M-producing Escherichia coli strain had been added. K. pneumoniae cells were inoculated in the lungs of these gnotobiotic rats by using either a low (10 (5) CFU) or a high (10 (9) CFU) inoculum. Without treatment, all animals infected with the low or high K. pneumoniae inoculum developed pneumonia and died before 120 h postchallenge. In the treated groups, the low-inoculum rats received a 4 -day treatment of 5 mg/kg of body weight <b>cefquinome</b> beginning at 24 h postchallenge (prepatent phase of the disease), and the high-inoculum rats received a 4 -day treatment of 50 mg/kg <b>cefquinome</b> beginning when the animals expressed clinical signs of infection (patent phase of the disease). The dose of 50 mg/kg targeting the high K. pneumoniae inoculum cured all the treated rats and resulted in a massive amplification of CTX-M-producing Enterobacteriaceae. A dose of 5 mg/kg targeting the low K. pneumoniae inoculum cured all the rats and averted an outbreak of clinical disease, all without any amplification of CTX-M-producing Enterobacteriaceae. These findings might have implications {{for the development of}} new antimicrobial treatment strategies that ensure a cure for bacterial infections while avoiding the amplification of resistance genes of human concern in the gut microbiota of food-producing animals...|$|E
