Sabah electrics are mostly generated from diesel power plant, hydropower and combined <b>cycle</b> <b>power</b> plants. The only main hydroelectric plant is the Tenom Pangi Dam. The combined <b>cycle</b> <b>power</b> plant called Kimanis Power Plant was completed in 2014, supplying 300 MW, with 285 MW nominal capacity. The plant is a joint venture between Petronas and NRG Consortium that also includes facilities such as gas pipeline of Sabah–Sarawak Gas Pipeline and a terminal of Sabah Oil and Gas Terminal. There is another two combined <b>cycle</b> <b>power</b> plants with a capacity of 380 MW operated by Ranhill Holdings Berhad. In 2009, the electricity coverage covers 67% of the state population and by 2011 increase to 80%. The coverage reach 100% in 2012 after an allocation of RM962.5million from the federal government were given to expand the coverage under the 2012 National Budget. The electrical grid is divided into two of West Coast and East Coast which has been integrated since 2007. The West Coast Grid supplies electricity to Kota Kinabalu, Papar, Beaufort, Keningau, Kota Belud, Kota Marudu, Kudat and Labuan with a capacity of 488.4 MW and maximum demand of 396.5 MW. While the East Coast Grid supplies electricity to the major towns of Sandakan, Kinabatangan, Lahad Datu, Kunak, Semporna and Tawau with a capacity of 333.02 MW and maximum demand of 203.3 MW.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} the thermodynamic and economic assessment of gas <b>power</b> <b>cycles</b> for 100 MW {{solar thermal power}} generation systems. A gas <b>power</b> <b>cycle</b> for solar <b>power</b> generation is a totally different technology from {{the current state of}} the art solar power generation systems. As a result, this thesis provides an assessment of the solar power generation systems with gas <b>power</b> <b>cycles</b> and provides guidance in the selection of design and operating parameters for gas <b>power</b> <b>cycle</b> based solar <b>power</b> generation system. The gas <b>power</b> <b>cycle</b> based <b>power</b> generation systems are assessed by means of thermodynamic and economic models developed and simulated using commercial thermodynamic analysis software. The gas <b>cycle</b> based <b>power</b> generation systems considered in this study are Cold Gas Turbine, High Temperature Solar Gas Turbine and Lorentz Cycle Gas Turbine. The system models are assessed for their thermodynamic performance using theory based turbo-machinery models with practical performance and loss data. In addition, extensive cost models have been developed for assessing the economic performance of the system models to determine their practical feasibility. The results from this study indicate that the most economical power generation system is the HTSGT system for a high peak cycle temperature utilizing the central receiver power tower solar collector system. The LCGT system also has a comparable performance at the same operating temperature. The CGT system assessed for operating with parabolic trough solar collector system at a lower peak cycle temperature had an inferior performance compared to {{the current state of the}} art technology for the power generation using parabolic troughs.

40|$|Explaining {{the causes}} of {{international}} strife {{is one of the}} most important problems in the social sciences. A wide range of theories have been created to account for conflict, crisis, and war that in some way relate to the dynamics of power. Two of the most prominent are Doran's <b>power</b> <b>cycle</b> and Organski's <b>power</b> transition. Each provides a useful framework within which to examine great power involvement in international conflict, crisis and war. The study unfolds in six sections. The first sets out the paper's agenda. The second section briefly describes modified versions of Doran's <b>power</b> <b>cycle</b> theory and Organski's power transition theory. The third presents hypotheses about the likely effects of the <b>power</b> <b>cycle</b> and <b>power</b> transition on crises and disputes. Fourth, measurements are developed for the crucial ingredients, meaning disputes, crises, critical points, and transitions in relative capabilities for the great powers. The fifth section uses MID and ICB data from 1816 to 1991 to test the hypotheses. Results are mixed for both theories and suggest that further work is needed in terms of the cases selected for application. Sixth, and finally, the findings are reviewed and some general comments concerning the future direction of research on <b>power</b> <b>cycle</b> and <b>power</b> transition theory are offered.

25|$|Facing {{increasing}} demand for electricity {{and concerned about}} the low reserve situation, the government of Israel began taking steps to increase the supply of electricity and operating reserve, as well to reduce the monopoly position of the IEC and increase competition in the electricity market starting in {{second half of the}} 2000s decade. It instructed the IEC to construct several new power stations and encouraged private investment in the generation sector. By 2015, the IEC's share of total nationwide installed electric generation capacity had fallen to about 75%, with the company then possessing an installed generation capacity of about 13.6 gigawatts (GW). Since 2010, Independent Power Producers have constructed three new gas-fired combined <b>cycle</b> <b>power</b> stations with a total generation capacity of about 2.2 GW, while various industrial concerns constructed on-premises cogeneration facilities with a total electricity output of about 1 GW, and which are licensed by the electric authority to sell surplus electricity to the national grid at competitive rates.

It is the earliest state legislature system in Malaysia. The construction of the earliest airstrip in Bintulu began in 1934 but was halted in 1938 due to financial difficulties. During World War II, the airstrip was heavily bombed by Allied forces. The British later rebuilt the airstrip, and it became fully operational in 1955. The old airport was replaced by a new airport in 2002. Bintulu remained a fishing village until 1969 when oil and gas reserves were discovered off the coast. Since then, Bintulu has become the centre of energy intensive industries such as a Malaysia LNG plant, a Shell Middle Distillate Synthesis plant, and a Bintulu combined <b>cycle</b> <b>power</b> plant.
