40|$|Abstract. The <b>chatter</b> <b>mark</b> {{vibration}} {{generated in}} the rolling process of the twenty-high roll mill not only significantly affects the mill performance, but also reduces surface quality of the strip steel. To identify the excitation source, the online monitor for the real time torsional strain of the main drive shaft is performed for a Sendzimir twenty-high roll mill. A corresponding relationship between the torsion variation of the main drive shaft and the period variation of the working roller is observed. The dynamic rolling skid model is further established and the torsion variation of the main drive shaft is simulated. The calculated results are compared with the measured torsion variation signal of the main drive shaft for without <b>chatter</b> <b>mark</b> vibration. The corresponding characteristics between the <b>chatter</b> <b>mark</b> vibration and the rolling skid is obtained.

Improvement of machinability was evaluated in terms of tool life, surface roughness and chip morphology. Machine tool chatter {{is a type of}} intensive self-excited vibrations of individual components of Machine-Tool-Fixture-Work (MTFW) system. Chatter causes unwanted excessive vibratory motion in between the tool and the work-piece causing adverse effects on the product quality and machine-tool and tool life. In addition to the damage of the work-piece surface due to <b>chatter</b> <b>marks,</b> the occurrence of severe chatter results in many adverse effects, which include poor dimensional accuracy of the work-piece, reduction of tool life, and damage to the machine. Chatter is formed as resonance phenomena during machining because of the instability of the closed-loop system formed by machine tool structure and metal-cutting process. In this study, magnets were used to avoid the chatter formation zone and its effect on machinability was investigated. Improvements in tool life and surface finish were observed during magnetic cutting of the mild steel. An obvious change in the chip behaviour was also present. These observations further enhance the possibility of using this magnetic cutting to eliminate the chatter formation zones and hence eliminate the adverse effect of chatter on machinability...|$|E
30|$|Aiming at {{high quality}} {{surfaces}} and dimensional/form accuracy, some monitoring methods have been proposed to monitor cutting forces with high precision and the process conditions. The variations of the cutting forces are most likely related to the tool wear or other process conditions and therefore will have direct influences on the machining outcomes [7 ‚Äì 9]. Tool wear or tool breakage can also increase the cutting forces and vibrations in the machining system, which will result in poor surface roughness, loss of the form and dimensional accuracy, and even <b>chatter</b> <b>marks</b> on machined surfaces [10]. In order to avoid such manufacturing defects or tool damages, some devices are designed and developed to measure the cutting forces and cutting dynamics. For instance, dynamometers are developed by researchers and industrial companies to measure cutting forces and the process dynamics in high precision and wide bandwidth. Currently, however, dynamometers have some limitations in their industrial application, such as their costs and reliability in stringent production environment. Furthermore, dynamometers are not applicable for layout-constrained machines and tooling setup, due to their size and weight. The dynamometer could also interfere with the cutting process and performance because of the tooling stiffness reduction in the machining system [11].|$|E

Up to now, complex eddy current systems are used for quality control instead of line cameras, because the ratio between lateral feature size and surface speed {{is limited by the}} data transport between camera and computer.

These frame rates correspond to equivalent line rates on line cameras between 360 and 880 kHz, a number far beyond the available features.

The model takes into account: the nonlinearity of the uncut chip thickness including the run-out effect; velocity dependent micro-milling cutting forces; {{the dynamics of the}} tool-holder-spindle assembly. The uncut chip thickness is determined after considering the full kinematics of the cutting tool including the run-out effect. The micro-milling cutting forces are determined by: (i) a finite element (FE) prediction of the cutting forces in orthogonal cutting at different cutting velocities and uncut chip thicknesses; (ii) describing the relationship between cutting forces, cutting velocities and uncut chip thicknesses into a nonlinear equation; (iii) incorporating the uncut chip thickness model into the relationship of the cutting forces as function of the cutting velocity and the uncut chip thickness. The modal dynamic parameters at the cutting tool tip are determined for the tool-holder-spindle assembly and used for solving the equation of motion. The micro-milling process is modelled as two degrees of freedom system where the modal dynamic parameters for the tool-holder-spindle assembly and the micro-milling cutting forces are considered. Due to nonlinearities in the micro-milling cutting forces, the equation of motion is integrated numerically in the time domain using the Runge‚ÄìKutta fourth order method. The displacements in the x and y directions are obtained for one revolution-per-tool. Statistical variances are then employed as a chatter detection criterion in the time-domain solution. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) inspection is carried out to observe potential <b>chatter</b> <b>marks</b> on the micro-milled AISI 4340 steel surfaces at different spindle speeds and depths of cut. The predicted stability lobes and the experimentally obtained stability limits resulted in satisfactory agreement.

Within such process, rather small surface defects such as grooves with lateral extend of 100 ¬µm in forward direction can cause cracks during further shaping steps and therefore a stop of production. With conventional image processing equipment like line cameras, this system would have to process more than 200, 000 lines per second for an optical resolution of 50 ¬µm, which is not feasible with current line cameras.

40|$|The {{distribution}} {{and characteristics of}} surface cracking (i. e. sub-surface damage or SSD) formed during standard grinding processes has been investigated on fused silica glass. The SSD distributions of the ground surfaces were determined by: (1) creating a shallow (18 - 108 {micro}m) wedge/taper on the surface by magneto-rheological finishing; (2) exposing the SSD by HF acid etching; and (3) performing image analysis of the observed cracks from optical micrographs taken along the surface taper. The observed surface cracks are characterized as near-surface lateral and deeper trailing indent type fractures (i. e., <b>chatter</b> <b>marks).</b> The SSD depth distributions are typically described by a single exponential distribution followed by an asymptotic cutoff in depth (c{sub max}). The length of the trailing indent is strongly correlated with a given process. Using established fracture indentation relationships, it is shown {{that only a small}} fraction of the abrasive particles are being mechanically loaded and causing fracture, and it is likely the larger particles in the abrasive particle size distribution that bear the higher loads. The SSD depth was observed to increase with load and with a small amount of larger contaminant particles. Using a simple brittle fracture model for grinding, the SSD depth distribution has been related to the SSD length distribution to gain insight into ''effective'' size distribution of particles participating in the fracture. Both the average crack length and the surface roughness were found to scale linearly with the maximum SSD depth (c{sub max}). These relationships can serve as useful rules-of-thumb for nondestructively estimating SSD depth and to identify the process that caused the SSD. In certain applications such as high intensity lasers, SSD on the glass optics can serve as a reservoir for minute amounts of impurities that absorb the high intensity laser light and lead to subsequent laser-induced surface damage. Hence a more scientific understanding of SSD formation can provide a means to establish recipes to fabricate SSD-free, laser damage resistant optical surfaces...|$|E
40|$|High speed {{machining}} using vertical CNC milling centres {{continues to}} be a popular approach in a variety of industries including aerospace,automobile,mould and die casting etc. Chatter oscillations have significant influence in restricting the metal removal rates of the machining process. The cutting process instability or chatter is assessed by prediction of frequency response at the tool tip. Present work aims at evaluating the combined effect of a spindle-housing and tool holder on the dynamics of cutting tool by considering the flexibility of spindle unit supported on bearings. The spindle-tool is analysed by using finite element modeling using Timoshenko beam theory. The dynamic characteristics and tool-tip frequency responses are obtained without considering the cutting forces. The results are compared with receptance coupling approach and using 3 D modeling in ANSYS. Further experimental modal analysis on the machining spindle of same dimensions has revealed the same dynamic modes. Using the validated FE model of the system,the effects of nonlinear bearing contact forces,spindle-tool holder interface stiffness,bearing span and axial preload, tool overhang and diameter on the frequency response and cutting process stability are studied. Optimal spindle-tool system is designed for achieving maximum dynamic stiffness. The analytically stability lobe diagrams are obtained from the real and imaginary terms of these frequency responses at the tool tip. Dynamic stability issues in helical end-milling using the two and three dimensional cutting force models are considered for the analysis. The stability boundaries are experimentally verified using the cutting tests on both CNC milling spindle and modified drilling tool spindle systems while machining Al-alloy work pieces. Vibration and sound pressure levels are also employed to assure the stability of cutting operations,while surface images are used to identify the <b>chatter</b> <b>marks</b> at various combinations of cutting parameters.

40|$|Analytical {{force and}} dynamic models for {{material}} removal {{processes such as}} end and face milling do not account for material and process related uncertainties such as tool wear, tool breakage and material inhomogeneity. Optimization of material removal processes thus requires not only optimal process planning using analytical models but also on-line monitoring of the process so that adjustments, if needed, can be initiated to maximize the productivity or to avoid damaging expensive parts. In this thesis, a Polyvinylidene Fluoride (PVDF) sensor based process monitoring method that is independent of the cutting conditions and workpiece material is developed for measuring the cutting forces and/or torque in milling. The research includes the development of methods and hardware for wireless acquisition of time-varying strain signals from PVDF sensor-instrumented milling tools rotating at high speeds and transformation of the strains into the measurand of interest using quantitative physics-based models of the measurement system. Very good agreement between the measurements from the low cost PVDF sensors and the current industry standard, piezoelectric dynamometer, has been achieved. Three PVDF sensor rosettes are proposed for measuring various strain components of interest and are shown to outperform their metal foil strain gauge counterparts with significantly higher sensitivity and signal to noise ratio. In addition, a computationally efficient algorithm for milling chatter recognition that can adapt to different cutting conditions and workpiece geometry variations {{based on the measured}} cutting forces/torque signals is proposed and evaluated. A novel complex exponential model based chatter frequency estimation algorithm is also developed and validated. The chatter detection algorithm can detect chatter before <b>chatter</b> <b>marks</b> appear on the workpiece and the chatter frequency estimation algorithm is shown to capture the chatter frequency with the same accuracy as the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). The computational cost of the chatter detection algorithm increases linearly with data size and the chatter frequency estimation algorithm, with properly chosen parameters, is shown to perform 10 times faster than the FFT. Both the cutting forces/torque measurement methodology and the chatter detection algorithm have great potential for shop floor application. The cutting forces/torque measurement system can be integrated with adaptive feedback controllers for process optimization and can also be extended to the measurement of other physical phenomena.
