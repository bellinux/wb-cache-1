Part IV will address whether the Turner standard was the appropriate test to apply to whether publishers, and not inmates, have a First Amendment interest in distributing unsolicited publications specifically in reference to the Ninth Circuit case Hrdlicka v. Reniff. The Supreme Court specifically stated that the Turner test was created “to formulate a standard of review for prisoners’ constitutional claims.... ” In Hrdlicka, the publishers of CJA, and not the prisoners, commenced the action, and thus the Turner test should not apply. Furthermore, a substantial issue of material fact does not exist in Hrdlicka, and the Ninth Circuit should have affirmed summary judgment. The last section of Part IV will discuss the standard that should have been applied in Hrdlicka...|$|E
40|$|This article {{examines}} the ultimately unsuccessful libel case brought by the novelist and BBC film critic E. Arnot Robertson against Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. The action followed a letter the film company sent to Robertson’s employer in 1946, asserting she was ‘out of touch’ with public taste, excluding her from their press screenings and requested the broadcaster’s assistance in preventing her from reviewing further MGM films on air. Robertson charged the film company with libelling her professional competence and imperilling her earnings. This article explores the origins and outcomes of the ensuing three-year legal dispute. Drawing on trade journals, law reports, press coverage and BBC records, the article considers the contrasting models of the ‘audience’ underpinning the wider conflict between the film trade and the ‘quality’ critics. It explores the role of BBC policy and ‘broadcast style’ in making radio criticism a flashpoint and traces the specific circumstances that led the two parties into court. Finally, it considers the lasting legal and cultural consequences of the <b>case.</b> <b>Turner</b> (Robertson) v. MGM redefined the legal meaning of ‘fair comment’, it reshaped BBC policy on broadcast criticism, and shifted the consensus on what constituted responsible and professional criticism – making wit a less respectable critical tool...|$|E

40|$|Turner {{syndrome}} {{has multiple}} comorbidities such as osteoporosis, obesity, diabetes, hypothyroidism, and hypertension. As they are treatable conditions in Turner syndrome, early recognition and proper treatment should be needed. We {{report on a}} 23 -year-old woman with Turner syndrome who presented with severe osteoporosis and hypercalcemia. Laboratory tests showed elevated levels of serum calcium and parathyroid hormone. Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry showed severe osteopo-rosis (z score, - 3. 5). Ultrasound and 99 mTc scintigraphy of parathyroid glands showed an adenoma in the right inferior gland. She was diagnosed with primary hyperparathyroidism due to an adenoma of the parathyroid gland. After excision of the adenoma, the patient's serum calcium and parathyroid hormone levels returned to normal.

In <b>cases</b> of <b>Turner's</b> syndrome, endocrinologically characterized by high gonadotropins and low E(2), a positive correlation was found between ∑FSH and ∑PRL (p< 0. 05).
