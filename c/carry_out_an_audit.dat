2500|$|On 14 April 2013, Nicolas Maduro won {{the presidential}} {{election}} with 50.6% of the vote, ahead of the 49.1% of candidate Henrique Capriles Radonski, surprisingly close compared to previous polls. Opposition leaders made accusations of fraud shortly after the election and Capriles {{refused to accept the}} results, alleging that voters had been coerced to vote for Maduro and claiming election irregularities. The National Electoral Council (CNE), which conducted a post-election audit of a random selection of 54% of the votes, comparing electronic records with paper ballots, claimed to find nothing suspicious. Capriles initially called for an audit of the remaining 46% of the votes, asserting that this would show that he had won the election. The CNE agreed to <b>carry</b> <b>out</b> <b>an</b> <b>audit,</b> and planned to do so in May. Later Capriles changed his mind, adding demands for a full audit of the electoral registry, and calling the audit process “a joke”. Before the government agreed to a full audit of the vote, there were public protests by opponents of Maduro. The crowds were ultimately dispersed by National Guard members using tear gas and rubber bullets. President Maduro responded to the protests by saying, “If you want to try to oust us through a coup, the people and the armed forces will be waiting for you.” [...] The clashes resulted in 7 people killed and dozens injured. President Maduro described the protests as a [...] "coup" [...] attempt, and blamed the United States for them. Finally, Capriles told protesters to stop and not play the [...] "government's game," [...] so {{there would be no more}} deaths. On 12 June 2013 the results of the partial audit were announced.

50|$|Because {{directors}} can impose tight deadlines, negotiate low {{audit fees}} or perhaps threaten to nominate another auditor to shareholders {{it could be}} argued that auditors are not truly independent within the United Kingdom. Whilst there may be some truth to this it would not be fair to say the rules are entirely ineffective as auditors have to consider that if they fail to <b>carry</b> <b>out</b> <b>an</b> <b>audit</b> effectively they will face stiff penalties, they could potentially have to compensate any damages as a result of their failure, they could potentially lose a lot of business and ultimately their credibility would be shattered. Therefore in reality it is thought that British auditors are only influenced in minor ways and normally over matters of opinion given that an auditor would put retaining its business before the loss of one single client.|$|E

50|$|It's very hot, {{putting a}} strain on everyone. A {{beautiful}} woman works in a shop in Eastern Europe during the Communist era. She is in the late, disillusioned stages of {{an affair with a}} married man. Two government inspectors arrive to <b>carry</b> <b>out</b> <b>an</b> <b>audit.</b> The shop sells expensive alcoholic drinks. One inspector is relaxed, an old hand, but the other is a newcomer and meticulous. The heroine's boyfriend has stolen some bottles with her compliance. She manages to hide this from the meticulous inspector during {{the first day of the}} inspection. That night she and her boyfriend raise money and buy bottles to replace those he stole. That night also, we see the unhappy home life of the meticulous inspector - his alcoholic wife and lazy son. We are led to wonder if he has feelings for the heroine (the shop worker). On the second day of the inspection, the relaxed inspector of the pair drops a bottle and it breaks, leading to the discovery that almost all the bottles have had their contents stolen and are filled with tea. We (the viewers) wonder if the meticulous inspector will allow the heroine to go unpunished - his boss actually suggest that. The film ends with an ambiguous act by the heroine, her motives unclear. It's a sad story with a subtext of men subjugating women and another about immorality under Communist rule.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To <b>carry</b> <b>out</b> <b>an</b> <b>audit</b> {{of cases}} of {{litigation}} relating to accident and emergency departments to determine the outcome and costs to the hospitals involved. METHODS: The experience of four similar hospitals was examined over a three year period. All cases which required at least an exchange of solicitors' letters were included. RESULTS: In total 32 claims were made, of which 17 were settled by solicitors' letters, six cases proceeded to court and were lost by the hospital involved, and in nine cases an out-of-court settlement was reached. The costs to the hospitals ranged from 180 pounds to 30, 000 pounds, with an average cost of 4080 pounds. Over {{the course of the}} audit the number {{of cases of}} litigation remained constant at three per year, while the number of complaints rose threefold to 150.
