5|$|Light {{falls on}} the {{pictorial}} space from the left, creating shadows against the back wall, the strongest cast by the girl's hennin. The depth of space provided by the back wall gives room for this detailing, which Charles Sterling believes is indebted to van Eyck. The light throws a murky but curved shadow {{on the wall behind}} the girl and acts as a <b>counterpoint</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> contour of her cheek and hairline.|$|E
5|$|The Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, {{following}} the Union of Lublin, became a <b>counterpoint</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> absolute monarchies gaining power in Europe. Its quasi-democratic political system of Golden Liberty, albeit limited to nobility, was mostly unprecedented {{in the history}} of Europe. In itself, it constituted a fundamental precedent for the later development of European constitutional monarchies.|$|E
50|$|A fugue {{usually has}} two main sections: the {{exposition}} and the body. In the exposition, each voice plays its own {{adaptation of the}} theme, in either a subject or an answer; they also provide countersubjects (<b>counterpoints)</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> following voices as they enter. The exposition usually ends on either a I or V chord, and is then followed by the body.|$|R
2500|$|Yale law {{professor}} William Eskridge, a harsh {{critic of the}} decision, has called it [...] "the most frequently criticized example of excessively strict stare decisis." [...] It is often <b>counterpointed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Court's decision in the 1940 trust case Helvering v. Hallock, where Justice Felix Frankfurter explicitly rejected the idea, embraced by Blackmun in Flood, that the Court should consider congressional inaction as a tacit statement of acquiescence with one of its existing holdings, however questionable they may have seemed. Eskridge notes {{that there are many}} reasons besides express lack of intent that would forestall Congressional action to remedy a flawed Court decision.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is <b>to</b> explore <b>the</b> messages and impact of three young adult dystopian trilogies, The Hunger Games, Divergent and The Uglies. In particular, the role of the American female teenager in political, economic and social spheres is discussed through examining the three female teenaged protagonists of these novels. For comparative purposes, George Orwell’s 1984 and Aldous Huxley’s Brave New World function as <b>counterpoints</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> young adult novels; the analysis of these different novels will prove that young adult dystopian novels show young adult women that their choices and actions can be integral to their societies on a political, economic and social level...|$|R
5|$|The {{introduction}} of Buddhism during {{the sixth century}} was a catalyst for large-scale temple building using complicated techniques in wood. Influence from the Chinese Tang and Sui Dynasties led to {{the foundation of the}} first permanent capital in Nara. Its checkerboard street layout used the Chinese capital of Chang'an as a template for its design. A gradual increase in the size of buildings led to standard units of measurement as well as refinements in layout and garden design. The {{introduction of}} the tea ceremony emphasised simplicity and modest design as a <b>counterpoint</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> excesses of the aristocracy.|$|E
5|$|After {{seeing how}} well the first film was made, {{the cast and crew}} signed for two sequels to be shot back-to-back, a {{practical}} decision on Disney's part to allow more time with the same cast and crew. Writers Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio knew that with an ensemble cast, they weren't free to invent totally different situations and characters, as with the Indiana Jones and James Bond series, and so had to retroactively turn The Curse of the Black Pearl into the first of a trilogy. They wanted to explore the reality of what would happen after Will Turner and Elizabeth Swann's embrace {{at the end of the}} first film, and initially considered the Fountain of Youth as the plot device. They settled on introducing Davy Jones, the Flying Dutchman and the Kraken, a mythology mentioned twice in the first film. They introduced the historical East India Trading Company (also mentioned in the first film), which for them represented a <b>counterpoint</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> themes of personal freedom represented by pirates.|$|E
5|$|John Greyson became {{interested}} in offering a <b>counterpoint</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Patient Zero story as early as 1987, when the Patient Zero meme began entering the public consciousness following the publication of Randy Shilts's book And the Band Played On. The book described the cluster study {{which led to the}} popular identification of flight attendant Gaëtan Dugas as the vector through which HIV was first brought to North America. It should be noted, however, that Shilts himself never claimed that Dugas was the first. In early 1991 Greyson was given a development grant for the script from the Canadian Film Centre, of which Greyson is an alumnus. Over the next year Greyson, in collaboration with Film Centre partners Louise Garfield and Anna Stratton, continued to develop the script, eventually presenting it with producer Alexandra Raffé in a workshop format. During the first half of 1992, the production team secured additional development funding from the Canada Council, Telefilm Canada and the Ontario Film Development Corporation. By June of that year the script and the songs were completed and that autumn, with funds from the Telefilm Canada and OFDC grants along with revenue from the sale of British broadcast rights to Channel 4, pre-production and casting got underway. Principal photography began in November 1992 and wrapped after five weeks. Sneak previews took place at the Seattle International Film Festival and a number of LGBT film festivals across the United States before its official debut in September 1993 at Toronto's Festival of Festivals.|$|E
50|$|The Forerunner {{was founded}} by Bob Weiner and Rose Weiner and Maranatha Campus Ministries in 1981.

John Irving 2 ̆ 7 s <b>The</b> World According <b>to</b> Garp, Alice Walker 2 ̆ 7 s The Color Purple and E. L. Doctorow 2 ̆ 7 s Ragtime contain compelling utopian depictions of alternative families that are more egalitarian than traditional nuclear families.

40|$|Oscillate is a {{publication}} presenting texts from {{four of the}} world’s leading musicians: Evan Parker, Matthew Herbert, Kaffe Matthews, and Mira Calix. Emerging {{from a series of}} public artist talks of the same name at Turner Contemporary in Margate, the writings in Oscillate serve as fascinating literary <b>counterpoints</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> artists’ practices, giving valuable insight into the creative process and conceptual context for their work. Collectively, the diverse writings in Oscillate highlight the role that experimental art plays in both reflecting and influencing the cultural arena in which the work is made and experienced.

25|$|Every hymn {{begins with}} a verset with a {{continuous}} cantus firmus: the hymn melody is stated in long note values {{in one of the}} voices, usually the bass, while the other voices provide contrapuntal accompaniment. Other versets are only occasionally cast in this form. More frequently the 16th century motet practice is used: the hymn melody either migrates from one voice to another, with or without imitative inserts between verses, or is treated imitatively throughout the piece. In three versets (Veni Creator 3, Ave maris stella 3, and Conditor 2) the melody in one voice is accompanied by two voices that form a canon, in two (Ave maris stella 4 and Annue Christe 3) one of the voices provides a pedal point. In most versets, <b>counterpoints</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> hymn melody engage in imitation or fore-imitation, and more often than not they are derived from the hymn melody. All of the pieces are in four voices, except the canonic versets, which use only three.|$|R

500|$|The final movement, [...] "" [...] (I have a {{difficult}} journey before me), opens with a triad fanfare, which the bass voice sings on the words [...] "Nur getrost" [...] (Be comforted). It {{is similar to a}} motif in Bach's Violin Concerto in E minor, BWV 1042. The soprano reprises the chorale melody in duple rather than the original triple time, with a responding line in the bass voice. After two phrases, the ritornello plays alone for eight measures before both voices re-enter in <b>counterpoint</b> <b>to</b> complete <b>the</b> chorale.|$|R
40|$|Exploring Letter to Brezhnev through {{concepts}} of respectability as feminine cultural capital this article {{suggests that the}} film’s affective impulse stems from its representation of a female, working class experience under Thatcherism. This experience is articulated through two structures of feeling derived from the intersecting conventions of social realism, and the consumerist and romantic tropes of the ‘woman’s film’. Through this intersection the daily abjection of women through degrading work or unemployment is traced, whilst being <b>counterpointed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> escapist pleasures of a ‘night out’ constituted through the spatial and aesthetic shifts of the narrative, and the feminisation of the ‘jack the lad’ staple of British screen culture. In this way, Letter <b>to</b> Brezhnev exposes <b>the</b> centrality of respectability to women’s social mobility, or lack of it, thus offering a powerful critique of Thatcherite ideologies and women’s position as primary consumers within them. The article also offers a corrective to existing scholarship that has focussed on cinematic representations of a crisis of masculinity under Thatcherism <b>to</b> <b>the</b> neglect of its corrosive impact on feminine respectability...|$|R

40|$|International audienceEuropean social {{movements}} have {{been central to}} European history, politics, society and culture, and have had a global reach and impact. Yet they have rarely been taken {{on their own terms}} in the English-language literature, considered rather as <b>counterpoints</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> US experience. This has been exacerbated by the failure of Anglophone social movement theorists to pay attention <b>to</b> <b>the</b> substantial literatures in languages such as French, German, Spanish or Italian - and by the increasing global dominance of English in the production of news and other forms of media. This book sets out <b>to</b> take <b>the</b> European social movement experience seriously on its own terms, including: the European tradition of social movement theorising - particularly in its attempt to understand movement development from the 1960 s onwards <b>the</b> extent <b>to</b> which European movements between 1968 and 1999 became precursors for the contemporary anti-globalisation movement the construction of the anti-capitalist "movement of movements" within the European setting the new anti-austerity protests in Iceland, Greece, Spain (15 -M/Indignados), and elsewhere. This book offers a comprehensive, interdisciplinary perspective on the key European {{social movements}} in the past forty years.

He adds sections of subject change and digression from the original theme as well as moments of rest or silence. These qualities of the development are all very characteristic of Haydn. Furthermore, he draws upon the older style of intricate <b>counterpoint</b> <b>to</b> enhance <b>the</b> galante style of the symphony.|$|R
