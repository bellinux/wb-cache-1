40|$|This is {{a conference}} paper. It was {{published}} in the series Materials Science Forum and the definitive version is available at: [URL] increasing demand for automotive industries to reduce the weight of the vehicles has led to a growing usage of Al alloy powder metallurgy (P/M) parts such as <b>camshaft</b> <b>bearing</b> <b>caps,</b> shock absorber pistons and brake calipers [1, 2]. In order to control the sintered microstructure and mechanical properties of the aluminium alloy powder metallurgical (P/M) parts, it is essential to establish a fundamental understanding of the microstructural development during the sintering process. Current research at Birmingham University is focussed on the investigation of the sintering behaviour of Al-Cu-Mg-Si powder blends using a combination of Scanning Electron Microscopy, Energy Dispersive Microanaylsis (SEM) and Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC). This paper presents a detailed study of the effect of temperature and initial starting materials on the evolution of microstructure during the sintering of Al-Cu-Mg-Si blends for PM...|$|R
2500|$|<b>Camshaft</b> <b>bearings</b> {{are similar}} to {{crankshaft}} main bearings, being pressure-fed with oil. [...] However, overhead <b>camshaft</b> <b>bearings</b> do not always have replaceable bearing shells, meaning that a new cylinder head is required if the bearings suffer wear due to insufficient or dirty oil.|$|R

50|$|The {{engine was}} based on the high {{performance}} 427 side-oiler block, providing race-proven durability. The block and associated parts were largely unchanged, but an idler shaft replaced the camshaft in the block, which necessitated plugging the remaining <b>camshaft</b> <b>bearing</b> oiling holes.|$|R

50|$|The first Chevrolet {{engine to}} use 4-bolt mains was the 1967 Chevrolet Camaro. Chrysler and Ford {{employed}} Y-blocks, {{meaning that the}} block skirts extended below the centreline of the crankshaft. The main <b>bearing</b> <b>caps</b> could then be fixed with an additional cross-bolt, which was a horizontal bolt going into or through the main <b>bearing</b> <b>cap.</b>|$|R

25|$|The O-320 uses a {{conventional}} wet sump system for lubrication. The main <b>bearings,</b> connecting rods, <b>camshaft</b> <b>bearings,</b> tappets and pushrods are all pressure lubricated, while the piston pins, cylinder walls and gears are all lubricated by spray. The oil system is pressurized by an accessory-drive mounted oil pump. A remotely mounted oil cooler is used, {{connected to the}} engine by flexible hoses.|$|R
5000|$|From September 1969, {{the base}} 2.5 L-engine was pumped up {{to at the}} same time, both {{remaining}} engines received hydraulic lifters for smoother running, a new exhaust system and six <b>camshaft</b> <b>bearings.</b> The handbrake lever was moved from its position under the dash to a location between the front seats and the fuel tank was enlarged from 55 to 70 litres.|$|R
5000|$|When a ladder-frame main <b>bearing</b> <b>cap</b> is used, the {{crankcase}} assembly becomes considerably stiffer.|$|R
50|$|A 4-bolt main {{refers to}} the number of bolts {{attaching}} the main <b>bearing</b> <b>caps</b> to the block of an internal combustion engine. Four bolt mains are considered much stronger for high performance use than a 2 bolt main. Using 4 bolts to secure the main <b>bearing</b> <b>caps</b> reduces the amount of flex within the crankshaft as compared to 2 bolts.|$|R
50|$|Oil {{pressure}} {{is an important}} factor in the longevity of most internal combustion engines. With a forced lubrication system (invented by Frederick Lanchester), oil is picked up by a positive displacement oil pump and forced through oil galleries (passageways) into bearings, such as the main bearings, big end <b>bearings</b> and <b>camshaft</b> <b>bearings</b> or balance shaft bearings. Other components such as cam lobes and cylinder walls are lubricated by oil jets.|$|R

50|$|A cross-bolted bearing is a bearing, {{usually a}} {{crankshaft}} main bearing of a piston engine. Most <b>bearing</b> <b>caps</b> are retained by two bolts, {{one on each}} side of the bearing journal, and parallel to the cylinder axis. A cross-bolted bearing has one or more additional bolts, at right-angles to both the cylinder and crankshaft axes. These bolts may be either a single through bolt passing through the crankcase from one side to the other, or else two blind bolts threaded into the <b>bearing</b> <b>cap</b> from each side.|$|R

5000|$|Testing of the 406, {{with its}} higher power levels, led to cross-bolted mains [...] - [...] that is, main <b>bearing</b> <b>caps</b> that were secured {{not only by}} bolts at each end coming up from beneath, but also by bolts {{coming in from the}} sides through the block. A custom fit spacer was used between the cap and the block face. This design {{prevented}} the main <b>bearing</b> <b>caps</b> from [...] "walking" [...] under extreme racing conditions, and can be found today in many of the most powerful and modern engines from many manufacturers.|$|R

50|$|When {{used in the}} {{passenger}} cars both versions of the KA24 used a crankshaft girdle, as opposed to individual main <b>bearing</b> <b>caps.</b> In the Nissan Hardbody and Frontier applications a crank girdle was not used.|$|R
50|$|The {{crankshaft}} can {{be inserted}} into an assembled crankcase, {{rather than the}} <b>bearing</b> <b>caps</b> being assembled around it. This is usually done by rotating the crankcase end-upwards and then lowering the crankshaft vertically into it.|$|R

50|$|The {{efficiency}} of converting {{a unit of}} fuel to rotation of the driving wheels includes many points of friction loss and heat loss through the exhaust or cooling system. Friction inside the engine happens along the cylinder walls, crankshaft rod bearings and main <b>bearings,</b> <b>camshaft</b> <b>bearings,</b> drive chains or gears, plus other miscellaneous and minor bearing surfaces. An electric motor has internal friction only at the main axle bearings. Friction outside the motor/engine includes loads from the generator / alternator, power steering pump, A/C compressor, transmission, transfer case (if four-wheel-drive), differential(s) and universal joints, plus rolling resistance of the pneumatic tires.|$|R
5000|$|The Diplomat’s six-cylinder {{engine was}} a 2916 cc straight-six side-valve unit {{for which a}} maximum power output of [...] was claimed. That {{description}} also applies to the engine fitted in the earlier Standard Six. However, the unit used in the Diplomat featured a slightly higher compression ratio, and maximum power was achieved at 3,000 rpm rather than at 3,300 rpm. The gear ratios were also very slightly modified. In terms of the engine’s architecture, the unit fitted in the Diplomat came with seven <b>camshaft</b> <b>bearings</b> {{in place of the}} four that had been used in the Standard Six.|$|R

50|$|On 9 October 2009, the CAA {{issued a}} press release {{requesting}} the public's assistance in finding a <b>bearing</b> <b>cap</b> {{from one of the}} engines. The cap, which possibly separated from the engine during takeoff, could not be found at the crash site or at the airport.|$|R
5000|$|The 2300 is a [...] {{inline-four}} engine {{produced by}} the Chevrolet division of General Motors for the 1971 to 1977 model years of the Chevrolet Vega and Chevrolet Monza. It featured a die-cast aluminum-alloy cylinder block. The high-tech block features an alloy with 17 percent silicon. During the machining process, the cylinders were etched leaving the pure silicon particles exposed providing the piston wear surface, {{eliminating the need for}} iron cylinder liners. The block has cast iron main caps and a cast iron crankshaft. The engine's cylinder head is cast iron for lower cost, structural integrity and longer <b>camshaft</b> <b>bearing</b> life. The valvetrain features a direct-acting single overhead camshaft design.|$|R
50|$|Hubstacks are {{bearings}} {{added to}} the hub (the outside) of a yo-yo and covered with some form of side cap to allow the yo-yo body to be held while it spins. With the side <b>cap</b> <b>bearing,</b> the operator can hold the yo-yo in many different planes and perform different styles of tricks which are difficult (or impossible in some cases) to be performed with conventional yo-yos. These configurations may be called hubstacks, <b>bearing</b> <b>caps,</b> synergy caps, or jimmy hats.|$|R

The company {{specialized}} in machine die-casting and made small parts such as gears and <b>bearing</b> <b>caps.</b> It {{was the first}} {{company in the world}} in that enterprise. Franklin, who specialized in die-cast bearings, went out of business in 1934.|$|R
50|$|The DOHC {{cylinder}} head had 16 valves and {{was made of}} lost foam cast aluminium. The camshafts were held in the {{cylinder head}} with <b>bearing</b> <b>caps</b> and driven by a chain off the front crankshaft sprocket. Motion from the camshafts was transmitted to the 16 valves by direct-acting hydraulic lifters.|$|R
5000|$|The Mississippi State University Internal State Variable (ISV) plasticity-damage model (DMG) [...] {{developed}} by {{a team led by}} Prof. Mark F. Horstemeyer (Founder of Predictive Design Technologies) has been used to optimize the design of a Cadillac control arm, the Corvette engine cradle, and a powder metal steel engine <b>bearing</b> <b>cap.</b>|$|R
50|$|Due to {{its large}} factory bore size, short (compared to RB engines) deck height, and bottom end {{strength}} that {{is greater than}} any other production B or RB engine due to extra material added around the main <b>bearing</b> <b>caps,</b> 400 B engine blocks have become a popular choice for high-performance engine build ups.|$|R
40|$|Our study {{deals with}} the {{detection}} and the diagnosis of spalling in rolling bearings. Our idea is to show the correlation which exists between the outside temperature of the <b>bearing</b> <b>cap</b> and the vibratory level generated by increasing appearance of the defect. We led an experimental study on the test ring which allows the creation in a progressive way, of spalling defect on the external ring of the rolling bearing. On this test rig, we measure simultaneously the mechanical vibration in radial direction (by means of a piezoelectric accelerometer) and the <b>bearing</b> <b>cap</b> external surface temperature (by means of an infrared camera). The results exhibit a significant correlation between both measures. A detailed of the heat transfer between the rolling elements and the spalling outside border permitted to evaluate the temperature rise due to the heat generated from the defect 1...|$|R
5000|$|The first Y-block on Ford {{automobiles}} was the 1954 239 in³ (3.9 L) Ford engine, {{known for}} its deep skirting, which causes the engine block to resemble a Y. Rated at [...] and 193 ft-lbs of torque at 2200rpm, it replaced the [...] 239 in³ (3.9 L) flathead. The Y-block was considered a major advancement over the flathead. It is known for having oiling problems in the rocker shafts because the oil first went to the crankshaft bearing, then to the <b>camshaft</b> <b>bearings,</b> then to the rocker shafts. This problem plagued the entire Y-block family and could be remedied by running a copper line from the oil pump to the rocker shafts.|$|R
50|$|Cross-bolting has two advantages: it couples the {{two sides}} of the {{crankcase}} together, making it stiffer overall and less prone to twisting. Secondly it helps to hold the <b>bearing</b> <b>cap</b> down against the downward force from the piston. This second advantage is usually only possible with blind bolts, as the dowel effect of a through bolt is less effective.|$|R
50|$|The blocks are all {{strongly}} {{made using}} cast iron with large interconnected main bearing cradles and two bolt main <b>bearing</b> <b>caps.</b> Forged steel crankshafts, and cast iron main bearing support girdles became standard with the 3VZ-FE. Piston and ring construction are typical parts, with rods varying between large and very large for stock V6 production engines.|$|R
