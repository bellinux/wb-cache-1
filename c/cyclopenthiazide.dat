40|$|In {{a double}} blind placebo {{controlled}} randomised parallel study the antihypertensive activity and adverse biochemical effects of three doses of <b>cyclopenthiazide</b> were evaluated {{in patients with}} mild essential hypertension that had been recently diagnosed or was being treated with a single drug. After a four week placebo washout period 53 patients with diastolic blood pressures between 90 - 110 mm Hg {{were randomly assigned to}} 50, 125, or 500 micrograms <b>cyclopenthiazide</b> or matching placebo for an eight week period of treatment. Blood pressure was measured in the patients' homes by the same observer every two weeks. Serum urea, electrolytes, urate, and creatinine concentrations and 24 hour urinary sodium excretion were monitored every four weeks and serum magnesium concentration and plasma renin activity {{at the end of the}} washout and treatment periods. After eight weeks of treatment systolic and diastolic blood pressures were significantly reduced in patients taking 125 and 500 micrograms <b>cyclopenthiazide</b> when compared with those taking placebo. The decrement in serum potassium concentration (0. 6 mmol/l) and increase in serum urate concentration 0. 06 mmol/l) were greatest with the 500 micrograms dose, the increase in serum urate concentration alone being significant. No change in serum magnesium concentration or 24 hour urinary sodium excretion was noted with any dose of <b>cyclopenthiazide.</b> Only the 500 micrograms dose of <b>cyclopenthiazide</b> significantly increased the mean plasma renin activity (1. 8 (95 % confidence interval 0. 2 to 3. 4) - 5. 4 (3. 9 to 6. 8) nmol angiotensin I/l/h); the other doses like the placebo had no effect. <b>Cyclopenthiazide</b> 125 micrograms, a dose lower than is currently marketed, produced a similar hypotensive response to 500 micrograms of the drug without upsetting the biochemical profile...|$|E

CASE HISTORY A 78 -year-old woman presented in March 1985 with myalgia, arthralgia, loss of energy and postural dizziness. Drug therapy prior to admission was methyldopa 500 mg three times daily and <b>cyclopenthiazide</b> 500 pg daily, which she had taken for four years for 'hypertension', and naftidrofuryl oxalate 100 mg three times daily. On examination she had severe postural hypotension (supine blood pressure 140 / 80 mmHg, erect 80 / 40 mmHg), generalised muscle tenderness, marked leg oedema and ascites.

40|$|Six {{hundred and}} forty-eight {{previously}} treated hypertensive patients, {{with a mean}} age of 64 years, were studied. In spite of treatment over a mean period of 18 months, their blood pressure was inadequately controlled, with an initial mean levelof 180 / 108 mm Hg. Previous treatment which had consisted of either a diuretic alone, a beta-receptor antagonist alone or these two drugs in combination was discontinued and Datients were randomly allocated, in a double-blind manner, to a 6 -week treatment course of <b>cyclopenthiazide</b> (Navidrex®) or sustained release oxprenolol (Slow-Trasicors) or a fixed combination of these two compounds (TrasidrexCl'J) with the aim of lowering the diastolic pressure to < 100 mm Hg. Blood pressure was substantially reduced in each treatment group, with the lowest final pressures in the group treated with the fixed combination, where 87 % of the patients completing the study reached the target level of a diastolic pressure of < 100 mm Hg. Very few side-effects of treatment were reported with any ofthese compounds. The results from this study suggest that these compounds in their standard dosage range are useful and sofe antihypertensive agents in older patients. In those patients where blood pressure control with a single agent was proving difficult, the transfer to one or two tablets daily of the fixed combination (Trasidrex) produced a very satisfactory outcome in the large majority ofcases...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Breast {{cancer is}} the second leading cause of cancer-related death in women in the United States. During the {{advanced}} stages of disease, many breast cancer patients suffer from bone metastasis. These metastases are predominantly osteolytic and develop when tumor cells interact with bone. In vivo models that mimic the breast cancer-specific osteolytic bone microenvironment are limited. Previously, we developed a mouse model of tumor-bone interaction in which three mouse breast cancer cell lines were implanted onto the calvaria. Analysis of tumors from this model revealed that they exhibited strong bone resorption, induction of osteoclasts and intracranial penetration at the tumor bone (TB) -interface. Methods In this study, we identified and used a TB microenvironment-specific gene expression signature from this model to extend {{our understanding of the}} metastatic bone microenvironment in human disease and to predict potential therapeutic targets. Results We identified a TB signature consisting of 934 genes that were commonly (among our 3 cell lines) and specifically (as compared to tumor-alone area within the bone microenvironment) up- and down-regulated > 2 -fold at the TB interface in our mouse osteolytic model. By comparing the TB signature with gene expression profiles from human breast metastases and an in vitro osteoclast model, we demonstrate that our model mimics both the human breast cancer bone microenvironment and osteoclastogenesis. Furthermore, we observed enrichment in various signaling pathways specific to the TB interface; that is, TGF-β and myeloid self-renewal pathways were activated and the Wnt pathway was inactivated. Lastly, we used the TB-signature to predict <b>cyclopenthiazide</b> as a potential inhibitor of the TB interface. Conclusion Our mouse breast cancer model morphologically and genetically resembles the osteoclastic bone microenvironment observed in human disease. Characterization of the gene expression signature specific to the TB interface in our model revealed signaling mechanisms operative in human breast cancer metastases and predicted a therapeutic inhibitor of cancer-mediated osteolysis. </p...|$|E

40|$|The cardio-vascular {{dynamical}} {{analysis of}} Schellong 2 ̆ 7 s {{first and second}} test was performed by Blumberger-Holldack 2 ̆ 7 s and Wezler 2 ̆ 7 s method. The mode {{of changes in the}} cardiodynamics was divided into three types, that is, the pressure-(2 ̆ 2 Druckreakreaktion 2 ̆ 2, D.), the volume-(2 ̆ 2 Volumenreaktion 2 ̆ 2, V.), and normal reaction (N.) accrding to Blumberger. The mode of changes in the vasculodynamics was also classified into three types, i. e., the tension-(2 ̆ 2 Anspannungsregulation 2 ̆ 2, Ans.), the relaxation-(2 ̆ 2 Entapannungsregulation 2 ̆ 2, Ents.) and the normal regulation according to Duesberg-Sehroeder. 1. The abnormal fluctuation of the cardio-vascular dynamics in the recumbent state appears more frequently in the arterial hypertension than in the arterial hypotension. However, among the hypotensives whose subjective disturbances of orthostatism are severe, there occurs not seldom the cardio-vascular dynamics beyond the normal range. The difference between the cardio-vascular dynamical values at 52 ̆ 7 and those at 152 ̆ 7 after standing is not so remarkably found; generally speaking the values at these two time-points show very similar mode of reaction, therefore it may be safe to say that only the values at 52 ̆ 7 after standing is sufficient for the practical study on the type of the orthostatic reaction. 2. The hypotonic (2 ̆ 2 hypotone 2 ̆ 2) form of postural hypotension according to Schellong is usually attended with D. -reaction cardiodynamically and with Ans. -regulation vasculodynamically, whereas the hypodynamic (2 ̆ 2 hypodyname 2 ̆ 2) form is often attended with V. reaction cardio-dynamically and with Ents. -regulation vasculodynamically. However there exists not rarely the exception to the tendency above mentioned and concerning this source the standard deviation, the spontaneous fluctuation of these cardio-vascular dynamical values as the reproducibility of Schellong 2 ̆ 7 s 1 st and 2 nd test were fully discussed. 3. Dern 2 ̆ 7 s analysis was made in arterial hypertension regarding the dynamical optimal state of blood pressure which were gained by the administration of the various sorte of the hypotensive drugs presented after Kikawada 2 ̆ 7 s observation in our clinic, i. e. guanethidine, chlorthalidone, <b>cyclopenthiazide,</b> chlorbenzene- 2, 4 -disulfonamide, 1 -α-methyldopa, and some kinds of monoamine oxidase inhibitors. By the singular use of the latter it is difficult to obtain a stable optimal or floor state of blood pressure. Dern 2 ̆ 7 s analysis elucidates the autonomic nervous tonicity after the antihypensive treatment as our collaborators have emphasized. 4. The criterion for the judgement of the severity of the orthostatic dysfunction was made of the constituent factors of blood pressure range which were easily obtainable in the clinical praxis and then according to this criterion three subgroups, i. e. (-), (+) and (⧺) were difined (Tb 1. 6 - 7). 5. When the cardio-vascular dynamical values gained in the hyper-and hypotensives are investigated in the light of W. R. Hess 2 ̆ 7 classification of the autonomic nervous tonus, there can be seen the tendency that the ergotropic pattern is more frequently found in the juvenile hypetension whereas the histiotropic is more often observed in the middle-aged. In the arterial hypotension and autonomic dystonia, generally speaking the ergotropic pattern is rarely found and the histiotropic pattern complicated with Ans. -regulation is frequently observed. 6. The mecholyl test according to the original principle of Funkenstein, Greenblatt and Solomon. The II 2 ̆ 7 type was distinguished from Gellhorn 2 ̆ 7 s IE type owing to the marked fluctuation of both positive and negative direction far beyond the normal range, while the IE type of Gellhorn 2 ̆ 7 s classification were found 82...|$|E
