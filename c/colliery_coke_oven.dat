He formed George Stephenson & Company in 1837 and built a <b>colliery</b> and <b>coke</b> <b>ovens</b> at Clay Cross which opened in 1840. The company passed to his son Robert Stephenson on George's death in 1848, and in 1852 he sold his shares, the business becoming the Clay Cross Company, which was at one time the largest independent employer in the UK.|$|R
5000|$|The station {{initially}} {{noted as}} {{being at the}} end of a short stub off the two main lines following the opening of the route northwards, but a replacement through station was authorised by the S&D in September 1856; this was subsequently built & commissioned but the precise opening date was not recorded. [...] This only had the one (reversible) platform on a loop off the main line - a configuration that was used in several other locations on the S&D system (e.g. , [...] and Bishop Auckland itself), with a sizeable goods yard nearby that served the adjacent Pease's West <b>Colliery,</b> <b>coke</b> <b>ovens,</b> fire clay works and chemical plant. Another route to the town - the Deerness Valley Railway from Durham via Waterhouses was completed in January 1858 - this joined the WXR route just north of the town and was constructed by the S&D at the behest of Joseph Pease, whose company owned the colliery & associated Bank Foot industrial complex opposite the station. This route though was only used by goods traffic, as passenger trains terminated at Waterhouses throughout the line's existence (final closure occurring in December 1964).|$|R
50|$|Although {{the village}} had a railway for many years, {{there was never}} a {{passenger}} service, with the only rail traffic being wagons to and from the <b>colliery</b> and <b>coke</b> <b>ovens</b> and coal traffic from other collieries passing through - either North {{on its way to the}} staithes at Jarrow, or unwashed coal from the screens at Marley Hill and Blackburn Fell heading South to the washery at the Hobson Pit about a mile away. This through traffic also ceased not long after the closure of the colliery when the Hobson Pit (which had for some time been the only remaining colliery on the line beyond Byermoor) ceased production later the same year.|$|R

British Steel Consett Works was closed in 1980. The Consett Iron Company was absorbed into British Steel Corporation in 1967, and the location became known as the Consett Steel Works.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Collieries</b> and {{associated}} <b>coke</b> <b>ovens</b> at Byermoor and Marley Hill {{were the only}} significant local sources of employment for {{the inhabitants of the}} village, with residents now travelling further afield by car or bus for work. Bus services from Consett and Stanley pass through the village on their way to Newcastle, some via the Team Valley and Gateshead town centre, and some via Whickham and the MetroCentre transport interchange, along with a single bus between Rowlands Gill and the Team Valley early on weekday mornings, returning via the same route in the evening.|$|R

50|$|Immediately before nationalisation, Manvers {{was owned}} by Manvers Main <b>Collieries</b> Ltd. The <b>coke</b> <b>ovens</b> and coal {{by-products}} plant were closed in 1981. With rationalisation in the South Yorkshire coalfield, from 1950 to 1956, Manvers became the centre of coal output from a the collieries known as the South Manvers complex that were linked below ground. They were Wath Main, Barnburgh Colliery and Kilnhurst. Each colliery retained its individual identity but the coal was wound to the surface at Manvers; this was done to protect the loyalties and friendships of the local pitworkers at each mine. The colliery complex was closed on 25 March 1988.|$|R
50|$|It {{branched}} {{off from}} the Main North line at Hanbury Junction at Waratah, and ran to and beyond the town of Wallsend. The line's main purpose was the transportation of coal from the Wallsend A B and C collieries and Wallsend Borehole collieries to the port of Newcastle. Upon {{the sinking of the}} Co-operative Colliery at Plattsburg (where Wallsend High School stands today) a branch from the line, with its junction at Stapleton Street, Wallsend, to that colliery was constructed. Another line also left the main Wallsend line at Moore Street, Jesmond, in order to service the Jesmond (later Ellermore Vale) Colliery, the New Tunnel <b>Colliery,</b> and the <b>coke</b> <b>ovens</b> complex, on either side of Newcastle Road.|$|R
5000|$|From 1 June 1881 the WC&ER {{provided}} a passenger service from Distington to [...] via , using the western {{section of the}} Gilgarran Branch. The fares received were less than Â£10 per annum, so the service was withdrawn after operating on 8 December 1883. From autumn 1913 the service was given another try; sources disagree about the start date, citing the beginning of either October or November (a working timetable for February 1913 included the service but {{that may have been}} premature). The service ran only on Thursdays (one round trip) and Saturdays (two round trips), and was withdrawn after Saturday 29 August 1914 amongst service withdrawals upon the outbreak of war. This service has been explained [...] as being for workers from Distington to expanding <b>collieries</b> and <b>coke</b> <b>ovens</b> around Lowca, but the service pattern gainsays this (perhaps arising from confusion with a service which started in January 1915 between Whitehaven and the halt at Parton, mentioned below).

40|$|Thesis (MTech(Environmental Health) [...] Cape Peninsula University of Technology, 2011 <b>Coke</b> <b>ovens</b> {{may occur}} in the aluminium, steel, graphite, electrical, and {{construction}} industries. In the work area coke-oven workers may be exposed to various chemical compounds. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), as human carcinogen, are primary compounds in <b>coke</b> <b>oven</b> emissions (COEs) generated in the coking process. <b>Coke</b> <b>oven</b> workers are often exposed to PAHs {{and can lead to}} a variety of human diseases. The primary routes of potential human exposure to <b>coke</b> <b>oven</b> emissions are inhalation and dermal contact. Occupational exposure may occur during the production of coke from coal, or while using coke to extract metals from their ores to synthesize calcium carbide, or to manufacture graphite and electrodes. Workers at coking plants and coal tar production plants, as well as the residents surrounding these plants, have a high risk of possible exposure to <b>coke</b> <b>oven</b> emissions. It is known that coke production could be carcinogenic to humans (Group- 1) by IARC. There has been sufficient epidemiological evidence suggesting an etiological link between carcinogenic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAHs) exposure and lung cancer risk among coke-oven workers. Lung cancer among coke-oven workers has been classified as one of the eight prescribed occupational cancers in China, and its incidence rate was about 10 times that of the general population. Therefore, lung cancer of coke-oven workers is still a critical issue in the field of prevention and control of occupational cancers in China. This thesis explores the various exposure levels of workers to PAHs at a steel plant in China. The measurement will focus on the exposure difference of personal sampling among workers in selected job classifications given the job descriptions and the coking process. The Benxi Steel Industry in Liaoning province of China (BXSI) was selected as the research location. Liaoning province is in the North of China and the location of various heavy industries in China.

METHODS Ninety-six <b>coke</b> <b>oven</b> workers {{participated in the}} study. Nonexposed workers (n = 105) were randomly sampled among power plant workers in the same age range. The examination included a questionnaire on health status, occupational history, smoking, and dietary habits. Blood samples completed the examination. <b>Coke</b> <b>oven</b> workers were classified into low-, middle-, and high-exposure groups based on the benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P) air concentrations and were further classified into the categories "topside" and "non-topside," according to their proximity to the ovens. RESULTS: Erythrocyte glutathiane peroxidase activity increased with age (r = 0. 18, P = 0. 061) in power plant workers, whereas plasma glutathione peroxidase activity decreased with age (r = - 0. 18, P = 0. 068) and erythrocyte glutathione peroxidase activity was inversely correlated {{with the number of}} cigarettes per day (r = - 0. 28, P = 0. 08) in <b>coke</b> <b>oven</b> workers. Comparison of blood antioxidant enzyme activities and total plasma antioxidant concentration between <b>coke</b> <b>oven</b> and power plant workers showed that erythrocyte glutathione peroxidase activity was significantly lower in <b>coke</b> <b>oven</b> workers, even after adjustment for potential confounding factors. No differences were found either in other blood antioxidant enzyme activities or in total plasma antioxidant concentration between <b>coke</b> <b>oven</b> and power plant workers.

40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] The aim was {{to assess}} the {{significance}} of two biomarkers; antibody to benzo(a) pyrene DNA adducts and concentration of hydroxyethylvaline haemoglobin adducts in samples from a well studied group of <b>coke</b> <b>oven</b> workers. As a measure of exposure we have used 1 -hydroxypyrene in urine. METHODS [...] Urine and blood samples were collected from <b>coke</b> <b>oven</b> workers and a control group. Samples from <b>coke</b> <b>oven</b> plant workers were collected in January and June. 1 -Hydroxypyrene was measured in urine by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), antibodies to benzo(a) pyrene DNA adducts were measured by ELISA and hydroxyethylvaline haemoglobin adducts were measured by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). RESULTS [...] Mean urinary 1 -hydroxypyrene in samples from <b>coke</b> <b>oven</b> workers varied from 1. 11 to 5. 53 umol/mol creatinine and 0. 14 umol/mol creatinine in the control group. Workers at the top side had the highest values of urinary 1 -hydroxypyrene. Antibody to benzo(a) pyrene DNA adducts did not correlate with either 1 -hydroxypyrene nor length of work at the <b>coke</b> <b>oven</b> plant. But antibody concentration in samples collected in January was predictive of the concentration in samples collected in June. A small non-significant increase in hydroxyethylvaline haemoglobin adducts was found in samples from <b>coke</b> <b>oven</b> workers relative to the control group when comparing smokers and nonsmokers separately. CONCLUSION [...] 1 -Hydroxypyrene correlates well with exposure groups based on job description. Antibodies to benzo(a) -pyrene DNA adducts was related to people and not exposure. Work at a <b>coke</b> <b>oven</b> plant might lead to increased hydroxyethylvaline haemoglobin adducts...|$|R
