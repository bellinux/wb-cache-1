40|$|Linear Induction Motor (LIM) {{which is}} also known as non-adhesion drive system has been chosen as {{propulsion}} system for most of mass transit railway all over the world. This is due to several advantages such as quiet and smooth running, no mechanical coupling, capable of climbing steep gradients, excellent acceleration and deceleration, and less susceptibility to weather condition. However, the disadvantages of LIM is it has finite length of the primary or secondary parts thus causes end effects also called discontinuous airgap flux phenomenon. Assymmetric airgap magnetic flux density at end parts of LIM produces unbalanced normal force which is airgap tends to increase at the entry and decrease at the exit part. This unbalanced normal force adversely affect the performance of the LIM propulsion system. Main objective of this research is to reduce magnetic flux leakage that leads to end effect phenomenon thus proves effectiveness method of chamfering in weakening end effect phenomenon. In this research, there will be 3 models of LIM. First is known as reference LIM which is LIM with no <b>chamfered</b> <b>angle.</b> Two others are LIM with <b>chamfered</b> <b>angle</b> 30 ° and 45 °. Software used in this research is JMAG-Designer. Reference and chamfered LIM 2 D models consists of mover (primary), coil, aluminium sheet, and stator (secondary) are created using Geometry Editor included in JMAG-Designer. After running analysis 3 different models of LIM following parameters given, results were displayed in the form of tables that indicates value of magnetic flux for 3 phase current (U, V, W). Graph is being drawn to make views of these results more clearly and precisely. X-axis in the graph indicates times whereas Y-axis in the graph indicates value of magnetic flux for 3 different model of LIM. After that, figure of distribution of magnetic flux density for 3 models of LIM is shown. From the results, chamfering is proven to reduce end effect at the LIM. At the end, <b>chamfered</b> <b>angle</b> 45 ° LIM has highest number of magnetic flux, least leakage flux, least end effect thus has highest thrust value for LIM propulsion system...|$|E
40|$|Five hole probes are {{extensively}} {{used for}} measurement of total and static pressures, flow angles, velocity and its components in turbomachinery, and other aerodynamic flows. Their operating range is usually limited to 30 – 40 ° {{depending on the}} type of the probe head. The <b>chamfer</b> <b>angle</b> of the probe is usually taken around 45 °. Recent studies on three hole probes have shown that 30 ° <b>chamfer</b> <b>angle</b> is desirable for unsteady flow measurements. Hence the present investigation is undertaken to find the optimum <b>chamfer</b> <b>angle</b> of five-hole probes.

Simulations depict intense flow diversion at the mouth of chamfered cavities and elucidate the directivity shift as well as the enhancement of acoustic power observed experimentally.

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} {{self-piercing}} riveting (SPR) method {{which uses a}} flange pipe rivet. This joining technology can {{solve the problems of}} oblique rivet and incorrect rivet position which are usually found in the SPR with a pipe rivet. The lap shear strength of the joint with a flange pipe rivet is higher than that of a joint with a conventional rivet. In this research, a flange pipe rivet was placed between two sheets with a force applied to the top sheet by a punch riveting machine. The flange pipe rivet moved downward along with the top sheet to induce appropriate bending and form a mechanical interlock in both sheets. Finite element (FE) analysis of the SPR with a flange pipe rivet was done by DEFORM software. The simulated joint cross-section shapes were observed, and the influence of the flange pipe rivet parameters on joint quality was analyzed.

40|$|Thesis (M. S.) [...] Wichita State University, College of Engineering, Dept. of Aerospace Engineering. An {{experimental}} {{investigation was}} conducted to study the behavior of an edge chamfer on the resulting crushing response of flat laminated composite strips. The effects of variables such as <b>chamfer</b> <b>angle,</b> stacking sequence and material system were addressed. In the present study the material systems used was Newport NB 321 / 7781 fiberglass/epoxy and Toray T 700 G- 12 K-PW/ 3900 carbon-fiber/epoxy. <b>Chamfer</b> <b>angles</b> of 30 °, 45 ° and 60 ° {{were used in the}} present study to simulate the trigger mechanism. Laminate stacking sequences of [0 º]N, [± 45 º]N (N= 4, 8 and 12), were studied using Newport NB 321 / 7781 fiberglass/epoxy and Toray T 700 G- 12 K-PW/ 3900 carbon-fiber/epoxy. In addition Newport NB 321 / 7781 fiberglass/epoxy specimens were fabricated with a [0 Nº/± 45 ºN]S stacking sequence and tested. Monotonic and cyclic load-unload tests were conducted on an MTS electromechanical machine at a quasi-static stroke rate of 10 - 3 in/s. Monotonic tests were also conducted at stroke rates of 10 - 1 in/s, but restricted to the specimens with 45 ° chamfer specimen. Failure modes observed in [0 º]N, [± 45 º]N, [0 Nº/± 45 ºN]S specimens included delamination induced lamina/ sub-laminate bending mode, laminate bending mode, brittle fracture mode, catastrophic failure mode, and mixed mode failures. Lamina/sub-laminate bending mode and brittle fracture mode were observed to be the most dominant failure modes, with corresponding high energy absorption. The amount of energy absorption through delamination in cyclic load-unload test was investigated using image analysis and geometry calculations. With an increase in <b>chamfer</b> <b>angle,</b> the peak load, in the load-displacement curve, increased for the 12 and 8 ply laminates, while no significant differences were observed in the 4 viii ply laminates. The load eccentricity due to chamfering forced a global bending dominated failure mode in 4 ply laminates, which resulted in the observed apparent insensitivity to <b>chamfer</b> <b>angle.</b> Due to the 0 ° fiber orientation in [0 º]N stacking sequence, a higher load carrying capacity was observed in comparison to [± 45 º]N, [0 Nº/± 45 ºN]S. However, the energy absorption in [± 45 º]N was higher owing to the crushing mode of failure rather than the delamination induced splaying/bending mode observed in [0 º]N laminates. Results from the load-displacement curve showed that the Newport NB 321 / 7781 fiberglass/epoxy had a higher load carrying capacity than carbon-fiber/epoxy, and this was attributed to the crushing mode being dominant in the fiberglass/epoxy specimens. Although, both fiberglass and carbon-fiber are brittle by nature, there was a shift in the initial load response from linear to non-linear behavior in the load-displacement curve of the [± 45 º]N stacking sequence. The sustained crush region of the load-displacement curves for the [0 º]N laminates exhibited high serrations typically associated with load oscillations in brittle failure. Cyclic load tests revealed the sequence of failure mechanisms in chamfered laminates. While delamination was observed to be the primary driving mechanism, the estimation of energy dissipated due to the same was observed to be small in comparison to the overall energy absorbed...|$|R

40|$|The {{use of an}} {{artificial}} roughness on a surface is an effective technique to enhance {{the rate of heat}} transfer to fluid flow in the duct of solar air heater. However, the increase in thermal energy gain is always accompanied by increase in pumping power. This paper is concerned with optimization of roughness parameters of solar air heater based on effective efficiency criterion. Effective efficiency of a solar air heater having repeated transverse chamfered rib–groove roughness on one broad wall has been computed using the correlations for heat transfer and friction factor developed within the investigated range of operating and system parameters. Roughness parameters viz. relative roughness pitch P/e, relative groove position g/P, <b>chamfer</b> <b>angle,</b> relative roughness height e/Dh and flow Reynolds number Re, have a combined effect on the heat transfer as well as fluid friction. The thermo-hydraulic performance of an air heater in terms of effective efficiency is determined on the basis of actual thermal energy gain subtracted by the primary energy required to generate power needed for pumping air through the roughened duct. Based on energy transfer mechanism to the absorber plate, a mathematical model is developed to compute effective efficiency. The selection of the optimal values of the roughness parameters involves the comparison of the enhancement of thermal performance and the increase of pumping losses as a result of using roughness in the collector system with that of the system without roughness. The effective efficiency criterion is maximized and reasonably optimized designs of roughness are found...|$|R

The west wall has a convex profile, with straight gable, dominated by a main portal with a decorated facade cut with ornated curves and cornices that frames a Portuguese escudo (shield), surmounted by a closed crown. Over the portico is a large rectangular window, with salient frame, topped by arch in brick. The windows are flanked and topped by semi-circular niches, each with an arch over Tuscan pilasters with triangular gables.|$|R
40|$|Objectives The aim of {{this study}} is to compare the fit of all-ceramic crowns {{fabricated}} from conventional silicone impressions with the fit of all-ceramic crowns fabricated from intraoral digital impressions. Methods Twenty patients with 26 posterior teeth with a prosthetic demand were selected for the study. Two crowns (Straumann-Zerion) were made for each preparation. One crown was fabricated from an intraoral digital impression system (IDI group; Cadent-iTero), and the other crown was fabricated from a conventional one-step silicone impression (CI group; Express Penta Putty and Body Light). To replicate the interface between the crown and the preparation, each crown was cemented on its corresponding clinical preparation with ultra-flow silicone (Express Ultra Light Body). Each crown was embedded in resin to stabilize the registered interface, cut in 2 -mm-thick slices in a buco-lingual orientation. Internal misfit was measured in microns using stereomicroscopy with a magnification of × 40. Measurements were taken at different landmarks: margin, <b>chamfer</b> <b>angle,</b> axial, crest, and occlusal fosse. After checking for normality, data was analyzed using paired Student’s t test (α[*]=[*] 0. 05). Results Fit values were significantly affected by the impression technique (p[*]=[*] 0. 000). Mean internal misfit and mean marginal misfit were 111. 40 μm (SD[*]=[*] 54. 04) / 80. 29 μm (SD[*]=[*] 26. 24) for the crowns of the IDI group and 173. 00 μm (SD[*]=[*] 92. 65) / 133. 51 μm (SD[*]=[*] 48. 78) for the CI group. Conclusion All-ceramic crowns fabricated from intraoral digital impressions with parallel confocal technology demonstrated a clinically acceptable internal and marginal fit as conventional impression. Clinical significance Intraoral digital impressions as initial step to the digital workflow could further improve the marginal adaptation of all ceramic single crowns...|$|R
40|$|This work {{presents}} the results of an electro-discharge machined ceramic composites consisting of a base non-conductive ceramic component such Al 2 O 3, to which is added sufficient amounts of an electro-conductive ceramic nanoparticles such as TiC, TiNC, NbNC, TaNC, and SiC (whiskers) to achieve an electrical resistance of less than about 100 W. cm. With these compositions intricate geometries and features as holes, <b>chamfers,</b> slots, <b>angles,</b> changing radii and complex curves can be electro-discharge machined (EDM) into the ceramic body after Pulsed Electrical Current Sintering (PECS) to achieve maximum density and mechanical properties. In EDM, the electrically conductive workpiece or ceramic blank is eroded by electric discharges or sparks which on a small scale generate localized shock waves and intense heat. The four compositions studied were in the same proportion for all raw materials: alumina 42 (vol...|$|R

The tubes are sealed at the playing end with a plastic cap as a drumhead, the other ends of the tubes are open.The design developed by graphic designer Michael Wladarsch with its <b>chamfers</b> and <b>angles</b> is reminiscent of an organ laid flat, the silver and partially elliptically cut off end pieces of the big [...] "sidepipes" [...] are reminiscent of large-bore exhaust pipes. The final painting of the silver tubes with a black coating {{is reflected in the}} Tubophon lettering.The final metal work for the subframe and the cross struts separated the construction into four modules, each weighing between one and two tons. The Tubophon is transported on a lorry with a mobile crane for each module.|$|R
40|$|The load {{carrying}} capacity and failure mechanism of 8 square columns strengthened with high-performance ferrocement laminate (HPFL) and bonded steel plates (BSP) were analyzed {{on the basis of}} experiments on the axial compression performance of these columns. Results show that the reinforcing layer worked together with the original columns as a whole, and the load-bearing capacity significantly increased. When failure of the strengthened column occurred, the mortar and concrete were crushed and bulged outward {{in the middle of the}} columns, the angle bars and longitudinal steel bars buckled, and some stirrups were pulled out. The <b>chamfering</b> of <b>angle</b> bar momentously affected the primary damage of steel strand. The values of the strength reduction factor and pressure effective utilization coefficient of the mortar were suggested. Based on the experiments and existing tests of 35 columns strengthened with HPFL, equations for the axial compression bearing capacity were proposed and all calculation results agreed well with testing results. Therefore, the calculation method could be used in the capacity design of axial compression strengthened columns...|$|R
5|$|There {{is a red}} marble step to the chancel end of the {{crossing}}. The crossing has a <b>chamfered</b> north east <b>angle</b> for a tower stair, with a door at the foot. Two small windows {{light the}} staircase to the ringing chamber. There is a complex oak roof in nine panels with heavy beams and pendant bosses. The corner panels have fan vaulting on corbels, the other outer panels slope and the centre has a moulded roundel. There is a small plug in the centre, which, when removed, allows observers in the bell ringing chamber to view the crossing. The massive arches, supporting the equally monumental tower, is apparently early thirteenth century.|$|R
40|$|Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI) One of {{the primary}} {{challenges}} faced in Additive Manufacturing (AM) is reducing the overall cost and printing time. A critical factor in cost and time reduction is post-processing of 3 D printed (3 DP) parts, which includes removing support structures. Support is needed to prevent {{the collapse of the}} part or certain areas under its own weight during the 3 D printing process. Currently, the design of self-supported 3 DP parts follows experimental trials. A trial and error process is needed to produce high quality parts by Fused Depositing Modeling (FDM). An example for a <b>chamfer</b> <b>angle,</b> is the common use of 45 degree angle in the AM process. Surfaces that are more flat show defects than inclined surfaces, and therefore a numerical model is needed. The model can predict the problematic areas at a print, reducing the experimental prints and providing a higher number of usable parts. Physical-based models have not been established due to the generally unknown properties of the material during the AM process. With simulations it is possible to simulate the part at different temperatures with a variety of other parameters that have influence on the behavior of the model. In this research, analytic calculations and physical tests are carried out to determine the material properties of the thermoplastic polymer Acrylonitrile - Butadiene - Styrene (ABS) for FDM at the time of extrusion. This means that the ABS is going to be extruded at 200 C to 245 C and is a viscus material during part construction. Using the results from the physical and analytical models, i. e., Timoshenko’s modified beam theory for micro structures, a numerical material model is established to simulate the filament deformation once it is deposited onto the part. Experiments were also used to find the threshold for different geometric specifications, which could then be applied to the numerical model to improve the accuracy of the simulation. The result of the nonlinear finite element analysis is compared to experiments to show the correlation between the prediction of deflection in simulation and the actual deflection measured in physical experiments. A case study was conducted using an application that optimizes topology of complex geometries. After modeling and simulating the optimized part, areas of defect and errors were determined in the simulation, then verified and and measured with actual 3 D prints...|$|R
