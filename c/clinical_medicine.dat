Specific metabolites, such as polysaccharide-K, ergotamine, and β-lactam antibiotics, are routinely used in <b>clinical</b> <b>medicine.</b> The shiitake mushroom {{is a source of}} lentinan, a clinical drug approved for use in cancer treatments in several countries, including Japan.

40|$|<b>Clinical</b> {{forensic}} <b>medicine</b> is a progressing branch. In Indonesia and Malaysia, {{there is}} inadequate information regarding this practice. It is always unclear {{about the job}} scopes and practitioners involved in this field. The study outlined {{in this article is}} aimed to explore the current <b>clinical</b> forensic <b>medicine</b> practice compared to existing systematic practice globally and hence analyzing for presence of difference in this practice between these two countries. A qualitative study was conducted by forensic experts in Indonesia and Malaysia from September to November 2015. In-depth interview was carried out to obtain data which were then validated using literature and legal documents in Indonesia and Malaysia known as the triangulation validation method. Data were presented in narrative form. In Indonesia, forensic pathology and <b>clinical</b> forensic <b>medicine</b> were approached as one whereas in Malaysia separately. This practice was conducted by a general practitioner in collaboration with other specialists if needed in Indonesia; whereas, in Malaysia, this practice was conducted by forensic pathologists or medical officers in the absence of forensic pathologists. Both Indonesia and Malaysia followed the continental regimen in practicing <b>clinical</b> forensic <b>medicine.</b> There was still a lack of involvement of doctors in this field due to lack of understanding of <b>clinical</b> forensic <b>medicine.</b> The current <b>clinical</b> forensic <b>medicine</b> practice has not developed much and has no much difference in both countries. The gap between the current practice with systematic practice cannot be justified due to the absence of one standardized code of practice...|$|R

40|$|Objectives To {{report on}} doctors’ reasons, as {{expressed}} to our research group, for choosing academic careers, and on factors {{that would make}} a career in <b>clinical</b> academic <b>medicine</b> more attractive to them. Design Postal, email and web questionnaires Participants 6936 UK-trained doctors who graduated in 1996, 1999 and 2000 Main Outcome Measures Open-ended comments about a career in <b>clinical</b> academic <b>medicine.</b> Results Of doctors who provided reasons for pursuing a long-term career in <b>clinical</b> academic <b>medicine,</b> the main reasons were enjoyment of academic work and personal satisfaction, whether expressed directly in those terms, or in terms of intellectual stimulation, enjoyment of research, teaching and the advancement of medicine, and the job being more varied than and preferable to clinical work alone. Doctors’ suggestions for making <b>clinical</b> academic <b>medicine</b> more attractive included improved pay and job security, better funding of research, greater availability of academic posts, more dedicated time for research (and less service work), and more support and mentoring. Women were {{more likely than men to}} prioritise flexible working hours and part-time posts. Conclusions Medical schools could provide more information, as part of student teaching, about the opportunities for and realities of a career in <b>clinical</b> academic <b>medicine.</b> Women, in particular, commented that they lacked the role models and information which would encourage them to consider seriously an academic career. Employers could increase academic opportunities by allowing more time for teaching, research and study; and should assess whether job plans make adequate allowance for academic work</p...|$|R
