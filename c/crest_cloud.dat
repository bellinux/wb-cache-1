30|$|Here, we have {{presented}} results from our independent replication of R&C’s brokerage model using <b>CReST,</b> the <b>Cloud</b> Research Simulation Toolkit. In doing so, {{we have identified}} two problems with R&C’s implementation: the reservations bug, which forces the broker to be more risk-averse than the brokerage model suggests; and the more influential payment bug, which incorrectly calculates the payment a broker makes to the provider, thereby inflating the broker’s profits.|$|R

30|$|However, the {{cornerstone}} of science is the principle of replication. New findings should only be provisionally accepted—and considered with scepticism—until verified by independent replication (cf. the infamously high-profile discovery, and subsequent refutation, of neutrinos having velocity greater {{than the speed of}} light in a vacuum, e.g., [3]). Here, we perform an independent replication of R&C’s brokerage model using <b>CReST,</b> the <b>Cloud</b> Research Simulation Platform (freely available for open-source download [4]). CReST was developed at the University of Bristol to address the need for a robust simulation modelling tool for research and teaching of data centre (DC) management and cloud provision; and has successfully been used to refute, revise and extend findings in the cloud computing literature [5].|$|R
60|$|Leaning {{back on the}} {{cushioned}} seat, as {{the train}} started again, he reviewed the years at Bremerton, his first and only parish. Hitherto (to his surprise, since he had been prepared for trials) {{he had found the}} religious life a primrose path. Clouds had indeed rested on Bremerton's <b>crests,</b> but beneficent <b>clouds,</b> always scattered by the sun. And there, amid the dazzling snows, he had on occasions walked with God.|$|R
50|$|In 1867 Frank Heathcote {{received}} {{the permission of}} Richard Naylor to promote live pigeon shooting at his Hurlingham estate. His next step was {{the formation of the}} Hurlingham Club for this purpose and 'as an agreeable country resort'. The club leased the estate from Naylor in 1869 and in 1874 acquired the land outright for £27,500. The pigeon today forms part of the club's <b>crest.</b> Until 1905, <b>clouds</b> of pigeons were released in the summer from an enclosure near what is now a tennis pavilion.|$|R
6000|$|So I {{was left}} alone again with {{forgotten}} Fanny, and that night I dreamed of her. Nothing to be seen but black boiling waves flinging their yeasty, curdling <b>crests</b> into the <b>clouds,</b> and every <b>crest</b> the face of my ferrety [...] "herrand-boy." [...] And afloat {{in the midst of}} the welter beneath, a beloved shape whiter than the foam, with shut eyes, under the gigantic stoop of the water. Who hangs these tragic veils in the sleeping mind? Who was this I that looked out on them? I awoke, shuddering, breathed a blessing--disjointed, nameless; turned over, and soon was once more asleep.|$|R
40|$|We {{introduce}} the Cloud Research Simulation Toolkit (<b>CReST),</b> a new <b>cloud</b> computing simulation tool designed to enable cloud providers {{to research and}} test their systems before release. We compare CReST with other known cloud simulation tools and demonstrate the utility of CReST by evaluating different distributed middleware protocols and associated subscription network topologies for robustness and reliability. Our results extend previous work and demonstrate that the published literature contains inaccuracies. CReST has been released as open-source under a Creative Commons license on SourceForge, with the intention {{that it can be}} used and extended by the cloud computing research community. ...|$|R
60|$|When {{the autumn}} sun slanted over Greenhill {{this morning and}} lighted the dewy flat upon its <b>crest,</b> nebulous <b>clouds</b> of dust were to be seen {{floating}} between the pairs of hedges which streaked the wide prospect around in all directions. These gradually converged upon {{the base of the}} hill, and the flocks became individually visible, climbing the serpentine ways which led to the top. Thus, in a slow procession, they entered the opening to which the roads tended, multitude after multitude, horned and hornless--blue flocks and red flocks, buff flocks and brown flocks, even green and salmon-tinted flocks, according to the fancy of the colourist and custom of the farm. Men were shouting, dogs were barking, with greatest animation, but the thronging travellers in so long a journey had grown nearly indifferent to such terrors, though they still bleated piteously at the unwontedness of their experiences, a tall shepherd rising here and there in the midst of them, like a gigantic idol amid a crowd of prostrate devotees.|$|R
30|$|For all {{experiments}} {{reported in this}} paper, we use <b>CReST</b> as the <b>cloud</b> simulation platform. To optimise simulation performance, we disabled several of the lower-level physical infrastructure modules, such as the Thermal module that tracks heat-flow in the data centre. The active modules used {{in all of the}} brokerage simulations that we perform include: Brokerage, Pricing, Events, Services and Simulation. This enables us to efficiently run experiments that simulate decades of time, without compromising on the abstraction level needed. All CReST code used to run the experiments performed here, and associated Python scripts used for data analysis and visualisation, are available to download in version 0.4. 0 of CReST [4].|$|R
40|$|During the ‘Convective and Orographically-induced Precipitation Study’ (COPS) {{performed}} in summer 2007, deep convection developed on July 15, although convective available potential energy was only moderate and convective inhibition was high. Convection {{was restricted to}} an area east of the Black Forest crest. Data analysis revealed that the convection was triggered by different mechanisms. Due to a surface high which was situated east of the Black Forest and a surface low which approached the investigation area from the west, a mesoscale convergence zone was established between the two regions and moved eastwards. Secondly, high insolation favoured the development of slope and valley winds and high evapotranspiration resulted in an increase of moisture in the planetary boundary layer (PBL). The thermally driven circulation systems formed a convergence zone along the mountain crest. When the synoptically induced mesoscale convergence zone reached the Black Forest, the different convergence zones superimposed optimally, such that strong updraughts were observed above the mountain. These updraughts penetrated the PBL-capping inversion and nearly reached the level of free convection. About 15 min after the convergence zone had passed the Black Forest <b>crest,</b> first <b>clouds</b> developed east of it. While moving further eastwards, the convergence zone intensified and became visible as a north-south oriented cloud line in the satellite images. Some deep convective cells with precipitation formed within the cloud line. The dense COPS network allowed the capture of the position and characteristics of the convergence zone and explains why convection developed in some restricted areas only...|$|R
6000|$|SECTION CXIX. I {{leave these}} facts to the {{consideration}} of the European patrons of art. Twenty years hence they will be acknowledged and regretted; at present, I am well aware, {{that it is of}} little use to bring them forward, except only to explain the present impossibility of stating what pictures are, and what were, in the interior of the Ducal Palace. I can only say, that in the winter of 1851, the [...] "Paradise" [...] of Tintoret was still comparatively uninjured, and that the Camera di Collegio, and its antechamber, and the Sala de' Pregadi were full of pictures by Veronese and Tintoret, that made their walls as precious as so many kingdoms; so precious indeed, and so full of majesty, that sometimes when walking at evening on the Lido, whence the great chain of the Alps, <b>crested</b> with silver <b>clouds,</b> might be seen rising above the front of the Ducal Palace, I used to feel as much awe in gazing on the building as on the hills, and could believe that God had done a greater work in breathing into the narrowness of dust the mighty spirits by whom its haughty walls had been raised, and its burning legends written, than in lifting the rocks of granite higher than the clouds of heaven, and veiling them with their various mantle of purple flower and shadowy pine.|$|R
5000|$|We {{arrived at}} Calais at 4 o'clock on Sunday morning the 31st of July Aug... We walked by the sea-shore almost every Evening with Annette & Caroline or Wm & I alone ... seeing far {{off in the}} west the Coast of England like a <b>cloud</b> <b>crested</b> with Dover Castle, which was but like {{the summit of the}} cloud -- the Evening star & the glory of the sky ... Nothing in Romance was ever half so beautiful. Now came in view as the Evening star sank down & the colours of the west faded away the two lights of England, lighted up by Englishmen in our Country to warn vessels of rocks or sands. These we used to see from the Pier when we could see no other distant objects but the Clouds the Sky & the Sea itself. All was dark behind. The town of Calais seemed deserted of the light of heaven, but there was always light, & life, & joy upon the Sea itself. -- One night, though, I shall never forget, the day had been very hot, & William & I walked alone {{together}} upon the pier -- the sea was gloomy for there was a blackness over all the sky except when it was overspread with lightning which often revealed to us a distant vessel. Near us the waves roared & broke against the pier, & as they broke & as they travelled towards us, they were interfused with greenish fiery light. The more distant sea always black and gloomy. It was, also beautiful on the calm hot nights to see the little Boats row out of the harbour with wings of fire & the sail boats with the fiery track which they cut as they went along & which closed up after them with a hundred thousand sparkles balls shootings, & streams of glowworm night. Caroline was delighted. On Sunday the 29th of August we left Calais at 12 o'clock in the morning and landed at Dover at 1 on Monday the 30th. I was sick all the way ... Dorothy Wordsworth ...|$|R
