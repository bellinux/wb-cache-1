25|$|In nations where Islamic law is {{the basis}} of civil law, but has not been codified, as is the case of some Arab <b>countries</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Middle</b> East, fatāwā by the {{national}} religious leadership are debated prior to being issued. In theory, such fatāwā should rarely be contradictory. If two fatāwā are potentially contradictory, the ruling bodies (combined civil and religious law) would attempt to define a compromise interpretation that will eliminate the resulting ambiguity. In these cases, the national theocracies expect fatwā to be settled law.|$|E

During that time, Hezbollah also halted cross-border rocket fire into Israel.|$|E
25|$|A {{report by}} Strategic Foresight Group has {{estimated}} the opportunity cost of conflict for the Middle East from 1991–2010 at $12 trillion. The report's opportunity cost calculates the peace GDP of <b>countries</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Middle</b> East {{by comparing the}} current GDP to the potential GDP in times of peace. Israel's share is almost $1 trillion, with Iraq and Saudi Arabia having approximately $2.2 and $4.5 trillion, respectively. In other words, had there been peace and cooperation between Israel and Arab League nations since 1991, the average Israeli citizen would be earning over $44,000 instead of $23,000 in 2010.|$|E

Over 138,000 new domestic workers gained permission to work overseas in 2012, a number that grew 12% from the previous year. Overseas employment often results in the women leaving their own children behind in the Philippines {{to be cared for}} by relatives. Domestic employees from the Philippines and other countries have also been subject to exploitation and sex and money extreme abuse, for example in several <b>countries</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Middle</b> East, where they are often employed. It is estimated that remittances from overseas workers (both male and female) bring $1 billion (USD) per month to the Philippines.|$|E
25|$|The plague struck various <b>countries</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Middle</b> East {{during the}} pandemic, leading to serious {{depopulation}} and permanent change in {{both economic and}} social structures.

During 1348, the disease traveled eastward to Gaza, and north along the eastern coast to cities in Lebanon, Syria, and Palestine, including Ashkelon, Acre, Jerusalem, Sidon, Damascus, Homs, and Aleppo. In 1348–49, the disease reached Antioch. The city's residents fled to the north, most of them dying during the journey, but the infection had been spread {{to the people of}} Asia Minor.|$|E

25|$|In 1989, the Tigrayan Peoples' Liberation Front (TPLF) {{merged with}} other ethnically based {{opposition}} movements {{to form the}} Ethiopian Peoples' Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF), and eventually managed to overthrow Mengistu's dictatorial regime in 1991. A transitional government, composed of an 87-member Council of Representatives and guided by a national charter that functioned as a transitional constitution, was then set up. The first free and democratic election took place later in 1995, when Ethiopia's longest-serving Prime Minister Meles Zenawi was elected to office. As with other nations in the Horn region, Ethiopia maintained its historically close relations with <b>countries</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Middle</b> East {{during this period of}} change. Zenawi died in 2012, but his Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF) party remains the ruling political coalition in Ethiopia.|$|E
