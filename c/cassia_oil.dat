30|$|The {{essential}} oil extracted by steam distillation from the stem bark of C. cassia Presl was quantitatively analyzed by GC-MS. cis- 2 -Methoxycinnamic acid and cinnamaldehyde were determined {{as the major}} compounds of the oil (43.06 % and 42.37 %, respectively). For comparison, a previous study reported that cinnamaldehyde (92.2 %) was the most plentiful constituent in the C. <b>cassia</b> essential <b>oil</b> (Giordani et al. 2006). Different extraction processes and assay methods could have contributed to differences in cinnamaldehyde levels of C. <b>cassia</b> essential <b>oils</b> (Dugoua et al. 2007). Cinnamaldehyde (77.1 %) was also {{found to be the}} major constituent of volatile oil of the bark of C. zeylanicum (Marongiu et al. 2007). Several studies have demonstrated that cinnamaldehyde has antimicrobial (Ooi et al. 2006), antimutagenic (Shaughnessy et al. 2001), antitumorigenic (Ka et al. 2003) and immunomodulatory activities (Koh et al. 1998); furthermore, cinnamaldehyde is considered to possess tyrosinase-inhibitory effects with IC 50 values from 0.52 ~ 0.97 mM (Lee 2002; Lee et al. 2000; Ngoc et al. 2009). Lee (2002) reported that 2 -methoxycinnamic acid that had been isolated from Pulsatilla cernua root was a potent noncompetitive inhibitor of mushroom tyrosinase with an IC 50 value of 0.34 mM. In addition, benzaldehyde, one of the flavor compounds characterized in anise oil, showed potent tyrosinase inhibitory activity with an IC 50 of 0.82 mM (Kubo and Kinst-Hori 1998). Because the CC-EO contained major in cinnamaldehyde and cis- 2 -methoxycinnamic acid, and trace readings of benzaldehyde, however, there is no report directly evaluating the tyrosinase inhibitory activities of CC-EO.|$|R

Currently, essential oils and their compounds are attracting great interest due to their proven action to preserve food quality, to extend foodś shelf-life and due to be natural. Essential oils from Ocimum basilicum (basil), Cinnamomun cassia (cinnamon), Cinnamomun zeylanicum (cinnamon) and Rosmarinus officinalis (rosemary) were analyzed by Gas Chromatography coupled with Flame Ionization Detector and with Mass Spectroscopy and by Ultra High Performance Liquid Chromatography with a Diode Array Detector. The antimicrobial activity against Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus and Penicillium spp and antioxidant activities by FRAP, DPPHradical dot, ABTSradical dot+ and β-carotene bleaching assays were evaluated. C. <b>cassia</b> essential <b>oils</b> presented a strong antimicrobial activity, with a range of minimum inhibitory concentrations between 0. 04 – 0. 07 mg mL− 1, depending on the microorganism tested. The main compound of C. <b>cassia</b> essential <b>oil,</b> cinnamaldehyde, showed antimicrobial effectiveness. In general, C. zeylanicum essential oil and its major compound, eugenol, presented the highest antioxidant activity. Ultra High Performance Liquid Chromatography confirmed the results of the essential oils main constituents, analyzed firstly by Gas Chromatography. Ultra High Performance Liquid Chromatography technique showed to be a valuable alternative tool for the identification and quantification of the major compounds of essential oils, especially when these are incorporated into food packaging and there is the need of carrying out migration studies in food or food simulants. Cinnamon essential oils exhibited the highest biological activity directly related to its major compounds, eugenol and cinnamaldehyde. Essential oils showed to have high antioxidant and antimicrobial activity and therefore, they have great potential as natural additives of food packaging. Highlights: - UHPLC technique showed to be a valuable alternative tool {{for the study of the}} major compounds of essential oils; - Cinnamon essential oil presented the strongest antimicrobial activity; - Cinnamon and Rosemary essential oils exhibited a good antioxidant activity; - Essential oils showed to have great potential as natural additives of food packaging.

40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this work}} are: 1) to determine whether plant essential oil components influence the ability of Escherichia coli and several Pseudomonas species to form biofilms, and inhibit bacterial quorum sensing; 2) to understand the role of autoinducer- 2 (AI- 2) in biofilm formation by E. coli W 3110. The biofilm formation assays determined that cinnamon, <b>cassia</b> and citronella <b>oils</b> differentially affected growth-normalized biofilm formation by E. coli. Cinnamaldehyde (CA) also inhibited the swimming motility of E. coli. Subinhibitory concentrations of CA were effective at inhibiting two types of acyl homoserine lactone (HSL) mediated quorum sensing (QS), and also AI- 2 mediated QS. Because CA is widely used in the food and flavor industries, its potential to affect bacterial QS regulated processes should be recognized. The role of AI- 2 mediated QS expression in physiology of E. coli W 3110 was pleiotropic, including carbon utilization, fimbriae production, and the biofilm development. Overall, the research presented in this dissertation supported the concept that QS, biofilm formation, and cell adhesion may be broadly correlated.

40|$|<b>Cassia</b> <b>oil</b> (CO) from {{different}} parts of Cinnamomum cassia have different active components. Very few pharmacological properties of cassia leaf oil have been reported. This study investigated and compared effects of cassia leaf oil and cinnamaldehyde on lipopolysaccharide (LPS) -activated J 774 A. 1 cells. Volatile compositions in cassia leaf oil were identified by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (MS) /MS. Effects of CO and cinnamaldehyde on LPS-activated J 774 A. 1 cells were investigated by determining nitric oxide (NO) production using Griess reaction assay; expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, enzymes involve in inflammatory mediators; antiinflammatory cytokines, and iron exporter ferroportin 1 (Fpn 1) using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction; and production of tumor necrosis factor (TNF-α) and interleukin (IL) - 10 using ELISA. The main component of CO was cinnamaldehyde. Both oils at 1 - 20 μg/ml markedly inhibited NO production in LPS-activated J 774 A. 1 cells with IC 50 value of 6. 1 ± 0. 25 and 9. 97 ± 0. 35 μg/ml, respectively. They similarly inhibited mRNA expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. These mediators included TNF-α, IL- 1 β, IL- 6, monocyte chemoattractant protein- 1, and macrophage inflammatory protein- 1 α in LPS-activated cells. They also significantly decreased expression of inducible enzymes inducible nitric oxide synthase, cyclooxygenase- 2, microsomal prostaglandin-E synthase- 1. In the opposite way, they increased mRNA expression and the production of antiinflammatory cytokines IL- 10 and transforming growth factor-β. In addition, they promoted the expression of Fpn 1. These results demonstrated that inhibitory effects of cassia leaf oil from C. cassia mainly came from cinnamaldehyde. This compound not only inhibited inflammatory mediators but also activated antiinflammatory mediators in LPS-activated J 774 A. 1 cells.

In all the in vitro experiments, rumen fluid was collected from Hartline x Texel cross cull ewes. A basal feedstock comprising of 70 : 30 grass hay and concentrate was formulated, milled (1 mm screen) and then supplemented with 32. 5 g oil/kg (40 % oil from ground whole linseed and 60 % from fish oil). In the first experiment using 15 EOCs, anethole and 4 - allyanisole {{which were the}} most effective EOCs reduced the BH of 18 : 3 n- 3 by 22. 2 % and 26. 4 %, respectively. But, at 300 mg/L there was a concomitant substantial inhibition of tot al volatile fatty acids (VFA). In the second experiment, out of 10 whole EOs, anise and cassia oils which were the most effective EOs reduced the BH of 18 : 3 n- 3 by 58. 2 % and 54. 3 %, respectively. However, protection was accompanied with significant suppress ion of VFA at 300 mg/L. In the third experiment using varying doses (0, 100, 200 and 300 mg/L) of 4 - allylanisole, anethole, anise oil and <b>cassia</b> <b>oil,</b> {{it was observed that}} at 200, 4 - allylanisole, anethole and anise oil maintained best balance between satisfactory protection of n- 3 PUFA and minimal disruption to VFA concentration.

40|$|The {{specific}} biofilm formation (SBF) assay, {{a technique}} based on crystal violet staining, {{was developed to}} locate plant essential oils and their components that affect biofilm formation. SBF analysis determined that cinnamon, <b>cassia,</b> and citronella <b>oils</b> differentially affected growth-normalized biofilm formation by Escherichia coli. Examination of the corresponding essential oil principal components by the SBF assay revealed that cinnamaldehyde decreased biofilm formation compared to biofilms grown in Luria-Bertani broth, eugenol {{did not result in}} a change, and citronellol increased the SBF. To evaluate these results, two microscopy-based assays were employed. First, confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) was used to examine E. coli biofilms cultivated in flow cells, which were quantitatively analyzed by COMSTAT, an image analysis program. The overall trend for five parameters that characterize biofilm development corroborated the findings of the SBF assay. Second, the results of an assay measuring growth-normalized adhesion by direct microscopy concurred with the results of the SBF assay and CLSM imaging. Viability staining indicated that there was reduced toxicity of the essential oil components to cells in biofilms compared to the toxicity to planktonic cells but revealed morphological damage to E. coli after cinnamaldehyde exposure. Cinnamaldehyde also inhibited the swimming motility of E. coli. SBF analysis of three Pseudomonas species exposed to cinnamaldehyde, eugenol, or citronellol revealed diverse responses.

30|$|Cinnamomum cassia Presl {{is widely}} {{cultivated}} in China. The dried stem bark of C. cassia, i.e., cassia bark, {{is important not}} only as a food spice but is also considered to have medicinal properties, such as antimicrobial (Lee and Ahn 1998), antitumorigenic (Ka et al. 2003), anti-inflammatory (Lee et al. 2002) and antidiabetic properties (Verspohl et al. 2005). In addition, the methanol extract of twigs of C. cassia was found to possess tyrosinase inhibitory activity (Ngoc et al. 2009). It is known that plant essential oil (EO) has various functional properties, such as a pleasant aroma, insect and animal repellant, as well as inhibitory effects against microorganisms. Moreover, various products made from EO have been used in aromatherapy and may relax or stabilize some physical and psychological conditions (Matsuura et al. 2006). The anise oil and citrus essential oils have been reported to possess tyrosinase inhibitory activities (Kubo and Kinst-Hori 1998; Matsuura et al. 2006). The essential oil from the relative cinnamon species, C. zeylanicum Blume, has been reported to show anti-tyrosinase activity, and cinnamaldehyde was found to be mainly responsible for this inhibition effect (Marongiu et al. 2007). The C. <b>cassia</b> essential <b>oil</b> (CC-EO) has hypouricemic (Zhao et al. 2006) and antifungal activities (Zhao et al. 2006). A number of tyrosinase inhibitors from both natural and synthetic sources that inhibited monophenolase, diphenolase or both of these activities have been identified to date (Kim and Uyama 2005). These tyrosinase inhibitors include plant polyphenols and aldehydes, fungal metabolites, derivatives of natural compounds, and synthetics origins. The tyrosinase inhibitory constituents of the essential oil extracted from Cinnamomum cassia (Ngoc et al. 2009; Lee et al. 2002) and relative cinnamon species, C. zeylanicum (Marongiu et al. 2007) have been well documented. Cinnamaldehyde was found to be the major constitute of the essential oil. However, the inhibitory pattern of cinnamaldehyde isolated from C. cassia (Lee et al. 2002), C. zeylanicum (Marongiu et al. 2007), olive oil (Kubo and Kinst-Hori 1999) and the root of Pulsatilla cernua was rather controvesial. Cinnamaldehyde from C. cassia was a competitive tyrosinase inhibitor whereas those from C. zeylanicum, olive oil and and the root of Pulsatilla cernua was a noncompetitive tyrosinase inhibitor. Therefore, this study were to further investigate the chemical composition and tyrosinase inhibitory activity of the CC-EO, including identifying constituent compounds using GC-MS, determining IC 50 values using inhibition kinetic analysis, and determining tyrosinase inhibitory patterns and inhibition constants using Lineweaver-Burk plots and second replots. In addition, the results were compared with those of the well-known tyrosinase inhibitor kojic acid.|$|R
40|$|The use {{of natural}} origin {{essential}} oils has recently gained much attention in many fields such as food flavouring, pesticides and in pharmaceutical industries. However, limitations {{to the use of}} existing conventional extraction methods are the inherent time consumption, high cost, high power consumption, potential loss of volatile compounds from essential oils as well as environmental concerns. Therefore new innovative extraction techniques are required to overcome these limitations. In this research, essential oil was extracted from Cinnamomum cassia bark using conventional hydrodistialltion (HD) and non-conventional microwave assisted hydrodistillation (MAHD) methods. The influence of pre-treatment on the C. cassia bark prior to extraction was investigated. Also, changes in morphology of the cinnamon bark powder before and after extraction by the two methods was observed through SEM. Milder disruption of cinnamon bark oil gland was observed for MAHD compared to HD. This is associated with the effective heat distribution obtainable from MAHD. The efficiency of MAHD extraction technique was compared with HD in terms of chemical composition and biological activity of the oil obtained as well as cost implication of the extraction process. To justify the performance of MAHD technique, the three main influencing factors such as solvent-to-plant material ratio, extraction time and irradiation microwave power were analysed. Analysis of these factors was initially carried out using one factor at a time (OFAT) method. Furthermore, screening and optimization of the factors was conducted with the help of Design expert software via factorial analysis and central composite design (CCD) respectively. The optimum conditions obtained through CCD for MAHD is 75 min extraction time, 8 : 1 of water to raw material ratio and 225 W irradiation power. The maximum yield obtained is 2. 75 %. On the other hand, the extraction parameters for HD are 150 min extraction time, 8 : 1 of water to raw material ratio and a constant operating power of 350 W. The maximum yield obtained for HD is 2. 02 %. The essential oil obtained at the optimum operating conditions for both methods was subjected to further qualitative analysis. Compositional analysis was conducted through gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). A total of 36 compounds were found for both extraction methods which were supported by FTIR analysis. However, the active compound present in C. <b>cassia</b> bark <b>oil</b> (trans-cinnamaldehyde) manifested a mean value of 84. 43 ± 0. 70 and 79. 55 ± 0. 45 for MAHD and HD respectively. Furthermore, cassia crude extract obtained through MAHD exhibits larger proportion of oxygenated compounds (9 % higher) than HD method. Energy consumption analysis shows that MAHD is more energy saving and environmental friendly. It reduced the overall carbon dioxide emission from HD by 59 %. In addition, cytotoxicity studies revealed that essential oil obtained through MAHD showed lower LC 50 value (51. 21 ppm) than HD (68. 88 ppm). This indicates that the MAHD technique is suitable for obtaining volatile <b>oils</b> from cinnamon <b>cassia</b> bark and the oil obtained can offer great pharmaceutical benefits...|$|R
