25|$|The AWS {{states that}} for an {{equivalent}} carbon content above 0.40% {{there is a}} potential for cracking in the heat-affected zone (HAZ) on flame <b>cut</b> <b>edges</b> and welds. However, structural engineering standards rarely use CE, but rather limit the maximum percentage of certain alloying elements. This practice started before the CE concept existed, so just continues to be used. This has led to issues because certain high strength steels are now being used that have a CE higher than 0.50% that have brittle failures.|$|E

When rough lumber is reduced to dimensional lumber, a large electric motor or internal combustion engine will drive a thickness planer that removes a certain percentage of excess wood to create a uniform, smooth surface on all four sides of the board and in specialty woods, may also plane the <b>cut</b> <b>edges.</b>|$|E

25|$|Since path-decompositions are {{a special}} case of tree-decompositions, the pathwidth of any graph is {{greater than or equal}} to its treewidth. The pathwidth is also less than or equal to the cutwidth, the minimum number of edges that cross any cut between lower-numbered and higher-numbered {{vertices}} in an optimal linear arrangement of the vertices of a graph; this follows because the vertex separation number, the number of lower-numbered vertices with higher-numbered neighbors, can at most equal the number of <b>cut</b> <b>edges.</b> For similar reasons, the cutwidth is at most the pathwidth times the maximum degree of the vertices in a given graph.|$|E

However, studies show that trimmed poultry's adrenal glands weigh less, and their plasma corticosterone levels are lower than those found in untrimmed poultry, indicating that they are less stressed overall. A similar but separate practice, usually performed by an avian veterinarian or an experienced birdkeeper, involves clipping, filing or sanding the beaks of captive birds for health purposes—in order to correct or temporarily alleviate overgrowths or deformities and better allow the bird to go about its normal feeding and preening activities.
