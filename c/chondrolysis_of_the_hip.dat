Idiopathic <b>chondrolysis</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hip</b> has an insidious beginning and affects more often female adolescents. Patients report severe hip pain, mobility limitation, and even claudication. This study aimed at reporting one case of that rare disease: an 11 -year-old female adolescent with chondrolysis, followed up for three years. Inflammatory activity tests were normal. Imaging tests (radiography, ultrasonography and magnetic resonance) were essential for the diagnosis. The treatment was based on pain control and preservation of the joint mobility, and included low-impact physical activity, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs, with good response after 12 months of treatment.

40|$|Abstract. Idiopathic chondrolysis {{is a human}} {{clinical}} entity typically {{reported in}} adolescent individuals. In this brief communication, we report 2 cases <b>of</b> presumptive idiopathic <b>chondrolysis</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> femoral head in Cynomolgus macaques and discuss the clinical symptomatology and pathology <b>of</b> <b>the</b> disease. In detail, we describe <b>the</b> histomorphologic changes <b>of</b> idiopathic <b>chondrolysis</b> and compare these findings with those typically observed in the primary differential diagnoses of Legg-Calve-Perthes disease and nonspecific osteoarthritis. Consideration of this entity among differential diagnoses in young Cynomolgus macaques with unilateral osteoarthritis could be important both for laboratory animal veterinarians and pathologists.

It was first described in 1971 by Jones from the Princess Alice Orthopaedic Hospital in Cape Town. It occurs mainly in adolescent girls. The outcome in South Africa has been reported as a progressive downhill course resulting in a painful, stiff hip. The aetiology of the disease remains unknown. Theories suggested are mechanical (decreased movement with loss of synovial nutrition; increased joint pressure) and an auto-immune response in genetically predisposed individuals. The differential diagnosis includes atrophic-type tuberculosis of the hip. Suggested treatment ranges from NSAIDs and range of motion exercises alone to early aggressive surgical treatment.

40|$|Background: Although {{there have}} been {{numerous}} studies on <b>the</b> treatment <b>of</b> developmental dysplasia <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hip,</b> few have focused on its natural history into adulthood. We observed valgus deformity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> knee in a group of adult patients with developmental dysplasia <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hip.</b> To <b>the</b> best <b>of</b> our knowledge, there has been no detailed study <b>of</b> that condition. <b>The</b> purpose <b>of</b> {{this study was to investigate}} structural changes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> knee in patients with neglected developmental dysplasia <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hip.</b> Methods: Thirty-four adult patients with neglected developmental dysplasia <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hip</b> and ten healthy adults were evaluated. The lower extremities were grouped according to <b>the</b> severity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dysplasia. <b>The</b> morphology <b>of</b> <b>the</b> knees was evaluated with radiographic measurements, and the groups were compared. Results: Compared with the control group, the patients with severe developmental dysplasia <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hip</b> had sig-nificant valgus deformity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> knee. This finding was associated with an increased vertical dimension <b>of</b> <b>the</b> medial femoral condyle, which led to a valgus inclination <b>of</b> <b>the</b> distal femoral articular surface.

40|$|Introduction: Total hip {{arthroplasty}} (THA) is {{a commonly}} used surgical treatment <b>of</b> osteoarthritis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hip</b> joint. A frequent complication of THA is loosening {{of one or}} both components <b>of</b> <b>the</b> prosthesis. Loosening <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hip</b> prosthesis is usually caused by mechanical (aseptic) causes but can also have an infectional (septic) cause. Both types <b>of</b> loosening <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hip</b> prosthesis require a different surgical treatment. <b>The</b> treatment <b>of</b> aseptic loosening <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hip</b> prosthesis consists <b>of</b> one operation during which one or both components <b>of</b> <b>the</b> prosthesis are being changed (1 -stage revision THA). Treatment of septic loosening <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hip</b> prosthesis requires a more intensive treatment because first the infection has to be cleared. Previous studies showed that certain patient-related factors have {{an increased risk of}} aseptic or septic loosening <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hip</b> prosthesis. However, no study has been performed into the difference between patient-related factors with aseptic or septic loosening <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hip</b> prosthesis. <b>The</b> aim <b>of</b> this study was to identify patient-related factors that are associated with an increased risk of aseptic or septic loosening <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hip</b> prosthesis. Methods: This retrospective cohort study consisted of 257 patients who underwent a revision THA between 1 January 2007 and 31 December 2011 admitted to <b>the</b> orthopedic unit <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Martini Hospital in Groningen. After in- and exclusioncriteria, 161 patients were being included. Patient-related and surgical factors were derived from EPD and patient charts. Analysed patient-related factors included the 19 specific diseases that are used to determine the Charlson Comorbidity Index as well as the 30 most common chronic diseases according to the Dutch Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM). Uni- and multivariate logistic regressions were performed to identify patient-related factors related to aseptic or septic loosening <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hip</b> prosthesis. Results: <b>Of</b> <b>the</b> 161 patients, 151 patients had an aseptic loosening and 15 patients had a septic loosening <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hip</b> prosthesis. Analysis showed that myocardial infarction (OR, 7. 37; BI 1. 86 - 29. 20) and cancer (OR, 5. 25; BI 1. 65 - 16. 76) had a raised chance for septic loosening in comparison with aseptic loosening <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hip</b> prosthesis. Overweight showed to be a raised chance OR, 0. 26; BI, 0. 07 - 0. 97) for aseptic loosening <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hip</b> prosthesis. Also having a high Charlson score (> 5) in comparison with a Charlson score of 0 was a risk factor for septic loosening <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hip</b> prosthesis. Conclusions: This study showed that patients with myocardial infarction or cancer in the medical history have a significant higher risk for septic loosening in comparison with aseptic loosening <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hip</b> prosthesis. Overweight is a risk factor for aseptic loosening in comparison with septic loosening <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hip</b> prosthesis. Also having a high Charlson score (> 5) is a risk factor for septic loosening <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hip</b> prosthesis. ...|$|R

30|$|We {{found that}} {{involvement}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> labrum in <b>the</b> <b>hip</b> joint in tuberculosis gives poor functional outcome. <b>The</b> presence <b>of</b> labral tear can, thus, {{serve as a}} watershed for treatment decisions in such patients. The labrum helps in deepening the acetabulum, thereby decreasing stresses on <b>the</b> <b>hip</b> joint and increasing its stability [20, 21].

These results help to explain <b>the</b> benefits <b>of</b> rotation osteotomy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hip</b> and <b>of</b> psoas release.

They found that pain, hip mobility, and gait improved greatly in this group of patients, with no major complications observed [25]. They noted that surgical dislocation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hip</b> yielded promising results in <b>the</b> treatment <b>of</b> femoral head deformities following LCPD [25, 31]. The authors reported transtrochanteric rotational osteotomy as a new technique for patients in whom <b>the</b> onset <b>of</b> LCPD occurs after 9  years of age. They concluded that this technique is an effective procedure for salvaging late-onset LCPD in affected <b>hips,</b> and that <b>the</b> amount <b>of</b> head involvement and the lateral pillar influence the surgical outcome [29, 36].|$|R
