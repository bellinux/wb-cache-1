In the early 1970s, the Philips PM5544 <b>test</b> <b>card</b> was introduced for colour transmissions and gradually replaced the previous monochrome <b>test</b> <b>card,</b> with the time and date included in the PM5544 <b>test</b> <b>card</b> from 1995-2000 and again from 2002-2006. In 2009, the Philips PM5644 widescreen <b>test</b> <b>card</b> was introduced to replace its PM5544 forerunner. In 2011 the testcard was discontinued.|$|R

The instructions also recommend that the <b>test</b> <b>card</b> be heldvertically and faced in a direction midway between the Sun and the camera;similar directions are also given in the Kodak Professional Photoguide.The combination of exposure increase and the card orientation givesrecommended exposures that are reasonably close to those given by anincident-light meter with a hemispherical receptor when metering with anoff-axis light source.|$|R

40|$|BackgroundHepatitis B {{surface antigen}} (HBsAg) and {{hepatitis}} B surface antibody (anti-HBs) were conventionally determined by enzyme immunoassays. We aimed {{to apply a}} rapid, simple, and accurate method to detect HBsAg and its antibody. MethodsWe collected 1463 serum samples from healthy volunteers, hepatitis B carriers, and children of HBsAg-positive mothers. The <b>test</b> <b>card</b> that we examined is a chromatographic immunoassay for the qualitative detection of either HBsAg or anti-HBs. We then compared {{the results of the}} <b>test</b> <b>card</b> to the results of the conventional enzyme-immunoassay method, which is regarded as a standard. ResultsIn the use of the <b>test</b> <b>card</b> to check HBsAg, the sensitivity was 88. 8 % and the specificity was 100 %. The median hepatitis B virus viral load was significantly higher in the true-positive group [103. 71 copies/mL (range, 102 – 109. 03 copies/mL) ] than in the false-negative group [102 copies/mL (range, 102 – 103. 26 copies/mL) ] (p =  0. 005). In those who were younger than 2 years, the diagnostic accuracy of the HBsAg <b>test</b> <b>card</b> was 100 %. Then, 1272 samples were tested for anti-HBs rapid <b>test</b> <b>card.</b> The sensitivity was 91. 8 % and the specificity was 96. 5 %. The median anti-HBs titer was significantly higher in the true-positive group (295. 8 mIU/mL) than in the false-negative group (42. 3 mIU/mL; p <  0. 001). ConclusionBecause of (1) the limited amount of blood sample required and (2) most of the young hepatitis B virus carriers having high viremia, and no concerns of false negativity, the <b>test</b> <b>card</b> is a good rapid screening tool for the detection of HBsAg and anti-HBs in pediatric group...|$|R

50|$|Test Card F is a <b>test</b> <b>card</b> {{that was}} created by the BBC and used on {{television}} in the United Kingdom and in countries elsewhere in the world for more than four decades.

50|$|A <b>test</b> <b>card,</b> {{also known}} as a test pattern or start-up/closedown test, is a {{television}} test signal, typically broadcast at times when the transmitter is active but no program is being broadcast (often at sign-on and sign-off). Used since the earliest TV broadcasts, <b>test</b> <b>cards</b> were originally physical cards at which a television camera was pointed, and such cards are still often used for calibration, alignment, and matching of cameras and camcorders. Test patterns used for calibrating or troubleshooting the downstream signal path are these days generated by test signal generators, which do not depend on the correct configuration (and presence) of a camera. Digitally generated cards allow vendors, viewers and television stations to adjust their equipment for optimal functionality. The audio broadcast while <b>test</b> <b>cards</b> are shown is typically a sine wave tone, radio (if associated or affiliated with the television channel) or music (usually instrumental, though some also broadcast with popular music).|$|R
