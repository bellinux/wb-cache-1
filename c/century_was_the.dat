5|$|Another small-bore cannon of the 14th <b>century</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> culverin, {{whose name}} {{derives from the}} snake-like handles {{attached}} to it.

The culverin was forged of iron and fixed to a wooden stock, and usually placed on a rest for firing.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{its unique}} {{geography}} – {{the only place}} in hundreds of miles from which one can easily access the Colorado River from both sides – it historically served as an important river crossing and starting in the mid-19th <b>century</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> site of a ferry operated by John Doyle Lee, for whom it is named. Boat service at Lees Ferry continued for over 60 years before being superseded by a bridge in the early 20th century, which allowed for much more efficient automobile travel.|$|E
5|$|In the Byzantine state, {{the emperor}} {{was the sole}} and {{absolute}} ruler, and his power was regarded as having divine origin. The Senate had ceased to have real political and legislative authority but remained as an honorary council with titular members. By {{the end of the}} 8th century, a civil administration focused on the court was formed as part of a large-scale consolidation of power in the capital (the rise to pre-eminence of the position of sakellarios is related to this change). The most important administrative reform, which probably started in the mid-7th <b>century,</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> creation of themes, where civil and military administration was exercised by one person, the strategos.|$|E

5|$|The 3rd <b>century</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> age {{in which}} the {{initiative}} for persecution shifted from the masses to the Imperial office. In the 1st and 2nd centuries, persecutions were carried out {{under the authority of}} local government officials. Septimius Severus (r. 193–211) and Maximin (r. 235–38) are alleged to have issued general rescripts against the religion and targeted its clergy, but the evidence for their acts is obscure and contested. There is no evidence that Philip effected any changes to the Christians' legal status. Pogroms against the Christians in Alexandria took place while Philip was still emperor. There is no evidence that Philip punished, participated in or assisted the pogrom.|$|E
5|$|The {{architects of}} early skyscrapers faced {{a number of}} challenges. The most fashionable {{architectural}} style in the late 19th <b>century</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> French Beaux-Arts movement, sometimes termed the Italian Renaissance style, which applied Classical aesthetic principles to modern buildings. American architects trained in the Beaux-Arts style at the Parisian Académie des Beaux-Arts began to return home in the 1880s, bringing these ideals and standards with them. Applying contemporary Beaux-Arts standards to early skyscrapers, however, was not straightforward. The buildings that the Beaux-Arts movement influenced were typically much shorter and broader than any skyscraper, and {{it was difficult to}} accurately reproduce the style in a tall, narrow building.|$|E
5|$|The {{history of}} Limousin cattle {{begins in the}} period known as the Pleistocene (2.6million to 12,000 years ago), when many megafauna roamed the Earth. One of the megafauna that survived until the 17th <b>century</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> aurochs, the distant {{ancestor}} of modern cattle. Cave paintings estimated to be 17,300 years old of many figures, including aurochs, were discovered in 1940 in Lascaux in the Dordogne region of south-western France. Because of their appearance, the aurochs depicted in the paintings were popularly, but incorrectly, {{believed to have been}} the immediate ancestors of Limousins.|$|E

5|$|The {{second half}} of the twentieth <b>century</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> {{professional}} development building era of public relations. Trade associations, PR news magazines, international PR agencies, and academic principles for the profession were established. In the early 2000s, press release services began offering social media press releases. The Cluetrain Manifesto, which predicted the impact of social media in 1999, was controversial in its time, but by 2006, the effect of social media and new internet technologies became broadly accepted.|$|E
5|$|A {{significant}} innovation of the 4th <b>century</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> {{corps of}} protectores, which contained cadet senior officers. Although protectores {{were supposed to}} be soldiers who had risen through the ranks by meritorious service, it became a widespread practice to admit to the corps young men from outside the army (often the sons of senior officers). The protectores formed a corps that was both an officer training-school and pool of staff officers available to carry out special tasks for the magistri militum or the emperor. Those attached to the emperor were known as protectores domestici and organised in four scholae under a comes domesticorum. After a few years' service in the corps, a protector would normally be granted a commission by the emperor and placed in command of a military regiment.|$|E
5|$|After 616, Rædwald, {{who ruled}} East Anglia {{during the first}} quarter of the seventh <b>century,</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> most {{powerful}} of the southern Anglo-Saxon kings. In the following decades, from the reign of Sigeberht onwards, East Anglia became increasingly dominated by Mercia. Raedwald's son Eorpwald was murdered by a pagan noble soon after he was baptised in around 627, after which East Anglia reverted into paganism for three years. In the void left by the death of Rædwald, the first overlord who originated north of the Thames, the pagan Penda of Mercia, emerged to challenge the pre-eminence of the new overlord (or bretwalda), Edwin of Northumbria. The reversion of East Anglia to rule by Eorpwald's successor, the pagan Ricberht, possibly due to Mercian influence, temporarily overthrew an important pillar of Edwin's authority.|$|E

5|$|Eardwulf (fl. 790– c. 830) {{was king}} of Northumbria from 796 to 806, {{when he was}} deposed and went into exile. He {{may have had a}} second reign from 808 until perhaps 811 or 830. Northumbria {{in the last years of}} the eighth <b>century</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> scene of dynastic strife between several noble families: in 790, the then-king Æthelred I {{attempted}} to have Eardwulf assassinated. Eardwulf's survival may have been viewed as a sign of divine favour. A group of nobles conspired to assassinate Æthelred in April 796 and he was succeeded by Osbald: Osbald's reign lasted only twenty-seven days before he was deposed and Eardwulf became king on 14 May 796.|$|E

He {{is the father of}} Stephen Lewis, a former Ontario NDP leader who in the early and mid-first decade of the 21st <b>century</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> United Nations Special Envoy for HIV/AIDS in Africa. His other son, Michael Lewis, was a former Ontario NDP Secretary and a leading organizer in the NDP. He is also the father of Janet Solberg, president of the Ontario NDP in the 1980s. His other twin daughter is Nina Libeskind, the wife and business partner of architect Daniel Libeskind. Stephen's son, broadcaster Avram (Avi) Lewis, is his grandson. In 2010, his granddaughter-in-law Naomi Klein, gave the inaugural David Lewis Lecture, sponsored by the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives.|$|E
5|$|In general, 20th-century historians from Palestine and the Arab world, and Palestinian and Arab nationalists, communists and leftists of all stripes, held a {{negative}} {{view of the}} Ottoman era, which they associated with backwardness, corruption and tyranny. According to historian Adel Manna, this uniformly negative perception of the Ottomans and the high regard for Muhammad Ali as a modernizer and a liberator of Arab lands from the Ottomans, which he sought to unite under his rule, influenced the later historiography of the 1834 revolt. Another factor that influenced the historians of the 20th <b>century</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> limited availability of primary sources from Palestine {{at the time of}} the revolt. Most primary Arabic accounts of the events were kept by Egypt's bureaucracy at the time. Other accounts were from European travelers or consuls in the area, while there were no known written 19th-century accounts by people living in Palestine's towns and villages.|$|E

5|$|In the 1970s, the United States and Western European {{countries}} {{introduced legislation}} to reduce lead air pollution. The impact was significant: while {{a study conducted}} by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States in 1976–1980 showed that 77.8% of population had elevated blood lead levels, in 1991–1994, a study by the same institute showed the share of people with such high levels dropped to 2.2%. The main product made of lead {{by the end of the}} 20th <b>century</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> lead–acid battery, which posed no direct threat to humans. From 1960 to 1990, lead output in the Western Bloc grew by a third. The share of the world's lead production by the Eastern Bloc increased from 10% to 30%, from 1950 to 1990, with the Soviet Union being the world's largest producer during the mid-1970s and the 1980s, and China starting major lead production in the late 20th century. Unlike the European communist countries, China was largely unindustrialized by the mid-20th century; in 2004, China surpassed Australia as the largest producer of lead. As was the case during European industrialization, lead has had a negative effect on health in China.|$|E
5|$|The lowest ranking Century in the Centuriate Assembly was {{the fifth}} Century (called the proletarii) of the unarmed adjunct class. This <b>Century</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> only Century {{composed}} of soldiers who had no property, and since {{it was always the}} last Century to vote, it never had any real influence on elections. In 107 BC, in response to high unemployment and a severe manpower shortage in the army, the general and Consul Gaius Marius reformed the organization of the army, and allowed individuals with no property to enlist. As a consequence of these reforms, this fifth unarmed Century came to encompass almost the entire Roman army. This mass disenfranchisement of most of the soldiers in the army {{played an important role in}} the chaos that led to the fall of the Roman Republic in 27 BC.|$|E
5|$|The {{second half}} of the 20th <b>century</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> golden age of virus {{discovery}} and most of the over 2,000 recognised species of animal, plant, and bacterial viruses were discovered during these years.

In 1963, the hepatitis B virus was discovered by Baruch Blumberg, and in 1965, Howard Temin described the first retrovirus. Reverse transcriptase, the enzyme that retroviruses use to make DNA copies of their RNA, was first described in 1970, independently by Howard Martin Temin and David Baltimore. In 1983 Luc Montagnier's team at the Pasteur Institute in France, first isolated the retrovirus now called HIV. In 1989 Michael Houghton's team at Chiron Corporation discovered Hepatitis C.|$|E
