This technique enables two users to move simultaneously the same virtual object in 3 D. For this aim, each user manipulates the object by one <b>crushing</b> <b>point,</b> like handling the extremity of a skewer. The SkeweR uses only translation information from the users' motions to change both the position and orientation of the manipulated object. By using more crushing points, this technique could easily be extended to 3 or more users. Thus, the SkeweR technique {{could be used to}} improve the collaborative manipulation of objects in numerous applications of Virtual Reality, such as: virtual prototyping, maintenance and training simulations, architectural mock-up reviews, etc...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to {{investigate}} the effect of electrical stimulation on nerve regeneration in sciatic crush injury model in rabbits. Sixteen New Zealand male rabbits, allocated into two equal groups were used in the study. All rabbits were anaesthetized, their sciatic nerves were exposed and crush injury was induced with Bulldog clamps. Distal motor nerve latency, Compound Muscle Action Potential recorded by the distal part of <b>crush</b> <b>point</b> (dCMAP), Compound Muscle Action Potential recorded by the proximal part of <b>crush</b> <b>point</b> (pCMAP) was recorded and Nerve Conduction Velocity (NCV) was estimated before and just after the crush injury. Electrical stimulation was performed for 90 times every day for 3 weeks. At the 21 st day all rabbits were anaesthetized and their sciatic nerves were exposed and the same electrophysiological examination was carried out respectively. Distal motor nerve latency, dCMAP, pCMAP and NCV were not significantly different between groups (p> 0. 05). In conclusion, our study did not support the idea that was about performing electrical stimulation to injured nerves could increase regeneration. However, the higher amplitude of dCMAP in the experiment group at the end of the study can be accepted as a positive point for electrostimulation on nerve injury...|$|R

40|$|Recently, a new {{mathematical}} tool called "catastrophe theory" {{has been}} developed by the topologists Thom, Zeeman, Mather, and others {{in an attempt to}} mathematically explain the discontinuities of observed behavior due to smooth changes in the basic parameters of physical, social, and biological processes. It has been shown that the number of mathematically distinct ways in which such discontinuities may arise is small when compared with the dimension of the process, and a complete classification of all distinct types has been made for processes depending upon five or less parameters. The purpose of this note is two-fold: first, to serve as a very brief introduction to the subject of catastrophe theory and secondly, to illustrate the theory by applying it to the determination of equilibrium configurations for stellar matter which has reached the endpoint of thermonuclear evolution, the problem of "stellar collapse". It will be seen that catastrophe theory enables us to give a very satisfactory explanation for the observed phenomenon of unstable equilibrium configurations and the appearance of the so-called Chandrasekhar and Oppenheimer-Landau-Volkoff <b>crushing</b> <b>points...</b>|$|R
5000|$|There is a {{large body}} of works which are {{critical}} of post-development theory and its proponents. It has been noted that post-development theory sees all development as imposed upon the developing world by the West.

[...] Citing Jonathan <b>Crush's</b> <b>point</b> that [...] "Development, for all its power to speak and to control the terms of speaking, has never been impervious to challenge and resistance, nor, in response, to reformulation and change" [...] Ray Kiely argues that [...] "The post-development idea is thus part of a long history within the development discourse." [...] In short, Kiely argues that post-development theory is merely the latest version of a set of criticisms that have long been evident within writing and thought in the field of development. Development has always been about choices, Kiely explains. Choices with resulting losers and winners, dilemmas and destruction, as well as creative possibility.|$|R

40|$|To {{investigate}} neurofilament (NF) dynamics {{during the}} cytoskeleton reorganization in regenerating axons, and their electrophysiological and histological consequences, we used two transgenic lines of mice: neurofilament high (NFH) -LacZ and NFH-green fluorescent protein (GFP). In NFH-LacZ mice, NFs are retained in cell bodies and deficient in axons (Eyer and Peterson, 1994), while in NFH-GFP mice the fluorescent fusion protein is normally transported along axons (Letournel et al., 2006). Following a crush of the sciatic nerve, conduction recovery in NFH-GFP mice {{is similar to}} wild-type (wt) mice, but it is reduced in NFH-LacZ mice. Moreover, changes of axonal calibres following regeneration are similar between NFH-GFP and wt mice, but they are systematically reduced in NFH-LacZ mice. Finally, the axonal transport of NFH-GFP fusion protein and NFs is re-initiated after the crush {{as evidenced by the}} fluorescent and immunolabelling of axons distal from the <b>crushed</b> <b>point,</b> but NFs and the fusion protein are not transported along axons during regeneration in NFH-LacZ mice. Together, these results argue that the absence of axonal NFs in NFH-LacZ mice compromises the axonal regeneration, and that the NFH-GFP reporter fusion protein represents an efficient model to evaluate the NF dynamics during axonal regeneration...|$|R

40|$|The {{efficacy}} of gangliosides in enhancing axonal regeneration and maturation {{in the early}} stages of diabetic neuropathy was assessed by quantitative analysis of immunostained serial sections of the sciatic nerve. Sprague-Dawley rats were made diabetic with a single injection of alloxan (100 mg/kg). One week later they were injected daily intraperitoneally with either a highly purified ganglioside mixture (10 mg/kg) or sterile saline for 4 wk. At the end of the treatment, sciatic nerves were crushed and allowed to regenerate for 1 wk without ganglioside treatment. The animals were then killed, and the nerves were frozen and processed for immunohistochemistry and electron microscopy. The number of regrowing axons was counted with a computerized image-analysis system on cross sections taken at predefined distances along the regenerating stump and stained with monoclonal antibody iC 8 specific for the 145, 000 -Mr subunit of the neurofilaments. In untreated diabetic animals the number of axons able to regenerate and sustain elongation for greater than or equal to 13 mm from the <b>crush</b> <b>point</b> was reduced by 40 % with respect to control rats. Ganglioside treatment was effective in compensating almost completely for this dramatic reduction. Electron microscopy confirmed that the immunofluorescence counts corresponded to regenerating axons containing neurofilaments. These results suggest that gangliosides are able to compensate for the derangements of axonal transport of cytoskeletal proteins reported in experimental diabetic neuropathy...|$|R

Anisotropic conductive adhesives (ACAs) consist of a polymer adhesive matrix containing fine conductive particles. The primary objective of this experimental research is to establish a clearer understanding {{of the effects of the}} bonding force on the deformation of individual ACA particles and their resulting conductivity when in contact with an appropriate metallic surface. This has been achieved through simultaneous measurements of the deformation and electrical resistance whilst applying force using a specially configured nano-indenter machine, where the "indenter", instead of being pointed, had a flat tip about 20 - 30 mum in diameter. The merit of using this machine is that very small forces, of the order of 100 mN, can be accurately applied to the particles to a resolution of 100 nN and the resulting deformations, of less than 6 mum, can then be recorded to a resolution of 0. 1 nm. The results showed that the ACA particle deformation was nonlinear and that the force/deformation at which particle crushing occurs was affected by the load rate. The resistance was observed to decrease as the deformation increased up to the <b>crush</b> <b>point</b> at which stage it increased slightly. The voltage versus current behaviour of a deformed ACA particle was also found to be linear...|$|R

The stochastic particle tracking model was adopted in the Lagrangian scheme to study the respirable dust dispersion behaviour and predict dust concentration distribution in the belt roadway. To overcome the uncertainty produced by the stochastic tracking, sufficient numbers of particles were employed to obtain a stable concentration field. Modelling results show that areas of airflow turbulence and circulation occur once the fresh ventilation emerges from the bin bottom and intercepts airflow from another intake. Dust particles from the underground bin will be dispersed extensively in the belt roadway once they become airborne, contributing to the high dust contamination in the intake fresh air. To mitigate dust contamination to the mine ventilation system, the dust clouds from the bin have to be intercepted and suppressed before they become airborne over the bin. Results from the CFD modelling will be used for the design and installation of a more effective dust control system...|$|R
5000|$|The spire is conical, scalar, in {{consequence}} of the drooping projecting shoulder {{at the top of}} each whorl. The protoconch consists of 3½ embryonic whorls, which are conically globose, smooth, keeled, closely, roundedly ribbed, with a deepish suture, and rise to a minute <b>point</b> (<b>crushed).</b> The whorls number 8½ in all, a little bunchy and disorderly. They have a long slightly drooping shoulder defined by the keel, below which they are cylindrical, with a slight contraction into the lower suture. The body whorl is small, with a contracting scarcely convex base, prolonged into a small, but distinct, and somewhat cylindrical snout. The suture is small, slightly impressed. The aperture is small, narrow, slightly pear-shaped, oblique, triangular above, prolonged into the small siphonal canal below. The outer lip is flat at the shoulder, angulated at the keel, slightly convex below this. The edge projects thinly beyond the last longitudinal rib, which serves as a varix [...] It presents a flattened, but regular curve from the point of the shell to the keel, where the edge forms a little shoulder, between which and the body lies the narrow round small sinus, with its flanged border. The inner lip is straight, with a very thin narrow glaze which early runs out to the rim, being cut off by the slightly oblique and twisted edge, which continues with a slight patulous margin to the point of the shell.|$|R
