40|$|The {{theoretical}} {{basis of the}} design of the quadrupole, and the close <b>constructional</b> <b>tolerances</b> imposed by it, are explained. The superconducting quadrupole is 1 m long, with a 5 oT/m field gradient in the 9 cm working bore and was successfully tested in Aug. 1972 after 10 months construction: the magnet was excited with 90 % of its critical current on the first cooling. The total cryostatic loss with a 6 m long transfer line was less than 5 W. (3 refs) ...|$|E
40|$|This thesis first {{considers}} the calibration and signal processing {{requirements of a}} neuromagnetometer for the measurement of human visual function. Gradiometer calibration using straight wire grids is examined and optimal grid configurations determined, given realistic <b>constructional</b> <b>tolerances.</b> Simulations show that for gradiometer balance of 1 : 104 and wire spacing error of 0. 25 mm the achievable calibration accuracy of gain is 0. 3 %, of position is 0. 3 mm and of orientation is 0. 6 °. Practical results with a 19 -channel 2 nd-order gradiometer based system exceed this performance. The real-time application of adaptive reference noise cancellation filtering to running-average evoked response data is examined. In the steady state, the filter can be assumed {{to be driven by}} a non-stationary step input arising at epoch boundaries. Based on empirical measures of this driving step an optimal progression for the filter time constant is proposed which improves upon fixed time constant filter performance. The incorporation of the time-derivatives of the reference channels was found to improve the performance of the adaptive filtering algorithm by 15 - 20 % for unaveraged data, falling to 5 % with averaging. The thesis concludes with a neuromagnetic investigation of evoked cortical responses to chromatic and luminance grating stimuli. The global magnetic field power of evoked responses to the onset of sinusoidal gratings was shown to have distinct chromatic and luminance sensitive components. Analysis of the results, using a single equivalent current dipole model, shows that these components arise from activity within two distinct cortical locations. Co-registration of the resulting current source localisations with MRI shows a chromatically responsive area lying along the midline within the calcarine fissure, possibly extending onto the lingual and cuneal gyri. It is postulated that this area is the human homologue of the primate cortical area V 4...|$|E
40|$|The present paper {{investigates the}} {{question}} whether different languages can be categorized into ‘constructionally tolerant’ languages, which grant speakers considerable freedom to combine syntactic constructions with lexical items in non-conventional ways, and ‘valency-driven’ languages, which impose stronger restrictions {{on the way in}} which constructions and lexical items can be combined. The idea of such a typological distinction is sketched for instance by Rostila (2014). In order to explore possible effects of <b>constructional</b> <b>tolerance,</b> a grammaticality judgment task is administered to speakers of English and French, which are two languages that differ with regard to this phenomenon: English verbs can be used across different argument structure constructions with relative ease, French verbs are more constrained. Both populations of speakers are exposed to stimuli sentences of varying creativity in a second language, namely German. The paper advances the <b>constructional</b> <b>tolerance</b> hypothesis, which states that speakers of a constructionally tolerant language should judge non-conventional examples in an L 2 with more lenience than speakers of a valency-driven language. The experimental results are in line with this hypothesis, but they also suggest that grammaticality judgments are influenced by the availability of a productive L 1 construction that shows functional overlap...|$|R
