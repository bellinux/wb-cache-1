40|$|In {{the year}} 1874 the Swedish {{government}} instituted a building's charter {{that did not}} allow buildings in wood with more than two floors. The laws were changed in 1995, when the demands of non-combustible building materials were replaced with functional requirements of buildings and wood buildings could then be built with over two floors. There were great expectations for <b>wood</b> <b>construction</b> to increase, but the change did not materialize and the Swedish government decided to begin {{to work on a}} national strategy to promote the use of wood in Sweden. The national strategy has since been followed by several projects to increase <b>wood</b> <b>construction,</b> the project "Trästad 2012 " and communal wooden building strategies. Despite these efforts, <b>wood</b> <b>construction</b> has not increased in percentage from 2004. This master thesis purpose is to contribute {{to a better understanding of}} the driving forces and barriers for <b>wood</b> <b>construction</b> that previous research has identified. The results are based on studies of previous research on driving forces and barriers for <b>wood</b> <b>construction</b> and through interviews that examines perceptions about <b>wood</b> <b>construction</b> of a number of operators in the construction industry in one municipality. The interview study includes construction companies, clients and representatives of the municipality. The study is conducted to describe and compare the different operators' perceptions about <b>wood</b> <b>construction,</b> general and within the municipality. The thesis discusses the results from the literature study and interview study related to the municipal wood building strategy and the driving forces and barriers for <b>wood</b> <b>construction</b> locally. The municipality where the interview study is performed is Skellefteå municipality. Skellefteå promotes sustainable construction and have worked, apart from national initiatives, locally to increase <b>wood</b> <b>construction</b> in the municipality and introduced a municipal wood building strategy in 2014. Despite this effort, the team behind the wood building strategy are experiencing that <b>wood</b> <b>construction</b> has not increased in the municipality. This work results in a compilation of a number of driving forces and barriers for <b>wood</b> <b>construction</b> identified in previous research, the compilation is then used as analytical model for the empirical material collected in the interview study. In the chapter of conclusion and discussion are the results and their significance being discussed as well as a discussion about what a municipal wood building strategy can provide to <b>wood</b> <b>construction.</b> Suggestions are also given on further research in the area. This work compiles a number of driving forces and barriers for <b>wood</b> <b>construction</b> identified by previous research. Some of these drivers are increased employment, the wood's environmental aspects and properties as well as industrial production. Among the obstacles that previous research identified are lack of knowledge, low propensity to change, uncertainty for new materials and legal requirements. These aspects that previous research has identified are found and recognized in the interview study. This study can thus partly confirm and contribute to a better understanding of the previous research. The interview study also shows that there is a certain consensus among respondents when it comes to driving forces of <b>wood</b> <b>construction.</b> But there are also differences in opinions. When it comes to barriers are the consensus not as great. A lack of consensus among respondents about the barriers and drivers for <b>wood</b> <b>construction</b> may result in a restriction of <b>wood</b> <b>construction</b> to increase. By allowing different respondents to look at the same claims and allow them to freely share their opinions can different types of problems appear. In can also show that something one person experience as a driver can be a barrier to anyone else. This study also shows that a municipal wood building strategy can help increase timber construction, in this case, some of the clients are considering wood as an alternative for future building projects.
