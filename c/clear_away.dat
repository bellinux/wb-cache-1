5|$|Bicycle kicks {{can be used}} defensively to <b>clear</b> <b>away</b> {{the ball}} from the goalmouth or offensively to strike at the opponent's goal {{in an attempt to}} score. The bicycle kick is an {{advanced}} football skill that is dangerous for inexperienced players. Its successful performance has been limited largely to the most experienced and athletic players in football history.|$|E
5|$|Speer {{placed his}} {{department}} {{at the disposal of}} the Wehrmacht. When Hitler remonstrated, and said it was not for Speer to decide how his workers should be used, Speer simply ignored him. Among Speer's innovations were quick-reaction squads to construct roads or <b>clear</b> <b>away</b> debris; before long, these units would be used to clear bomb sites. As the war progressed, initially to great German success, Speer continued preliminary work on the Berlin and Nürnberg plans. Speer also oversaw the construction of buildings for the Wehrmacht and Luftwaffe.|$|E
5|$|The British {{arrival in}} Jerusalem heralded a {{rational}} philosophy of infrastructure planning and development. It respected cultural and historic heritage {{and attempted to}} preserve such elements within the blossoming construction of the modern city. The city walls were identified as such an element, so British workers acted to <b>clear</b> <b>away</b> the stalls on their perimeter and maintain an open area between {{the walls and the}} rest of the New City in the interest of an aesthetically pleasing visual basin. By the same token, planners demolished the Ottoman clock tower to preserve a historic skyline.|$|E

5|$|The {{dominant}} {{vegetation cover}} of coastal sage scrub typically goes through approximately 25-year cycles, with its peak biodiversity reached in roughly 10 {{years after the}} beginning of a new 25-year period. Such periods are typically separated by wildfires, which <b>clear</b> <b>away</b> dead or dying vegetation and leave bare ground for new growth. The canyon is one of the last remaining sanctuaries for many plants native to Southern California. Approximately one hundred species of plants, most native to California, are found in Laurel and Willow Canyons alone. These include monkey flower, goldenrod, and sagebrush.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the game, the entire map is obscured until explored by the player. The map consists of a landlocked sea with several islands, wreckage, sea creatures, enemy ships, ports, and whirlpools. The player can sometimes encounter message bottles that <b>clear</b> <b>away</b> fog of war on the map to reveal hidden ports.Sea creatures and enemy ships appear randomly and challenge the player for gold or commodities in a card minigame. Ports are trading and safe zones where the player can sell commodities, buy upgrades for the ship, and take on sidequests. Whirlpools teleport the player's ship to a random location on the map.|$|E
25|$|Local populations {{admit that}} a large amount {{mahogany}} is leaving the reserve, but many poorer sections of the economy see {{the high price of}} mahogany as enough incentive to <b>clear</b> <b>away</b> valuable ecosystems that provide irreplaceable services to the water and soil. The loggers behind much of the reserve’s deforestation is still mostly unknown.|$|E

25|$|The tools {{used for}} terrier work have {{essentially}} remained unchanged {{for more than}} 400 years – a small-chested and very game working terrier, a good roundpoint shovel, a digging bar, a brushhook to <b>clear</b> <b>away</b> hedge and bramble, fox nets, water for the dog and digger, and a snare to remove the quarry or a gun or blunt instrument to dispatch it.|$|E
25|$|The {{illusion}} {{had been}} maintained up to 1906 or 1907 through the negligence {{of those whose}} job it was to <b>clear</b> <b>away</b> the rubbish, but the break was achieved in 1908. No-one would again dare {{to look at a}} Puvis de Chavannes or read Balzac. No-one, I mean, among those who walked above the Moulin Rouge, which they would never even have thought of entering.|$|E
25|$|All other {{communal}} sacrifices were of male animals, but the Red Cow was of {{a female}} animal. Rabbi Aibu explained the difference with a parable: When a handmaiden's boy polluted a king's palace, the king called on the boy's mother to <b>clear</b> <b>away</b> the filth. In the same way, God called on the Red Cow to come and atone for the incident of the Golden Calf.|$|E

25|$|On May 8, 1964, {{disaster}} {{struck the}} area {{north of the}} base. A tornado cut a wide swath along the shores of Lake St. Clair, causing some damage to the base and bringing injury, death and destruction to the local area. The base was quick to render aid to its distressed neighbors, providing emergency medical care, sending vehicles to help <b>clear</b> <b>away</b> the debris and furnishing emergency shelters for those made homeless by the storm.|$|E
25|$|The common {{mushroom}} {{could be}} confused with young specimens of the deadly poisonous destroying angel (Amanita sp.), but the latter may be distinguished by their volva or cup {{at the base of}} the mushroom and pure white gills (as opposed to pinkish or brown of A. bisporus). Thus it is always important to <b>clear</b> <b>away</b> debris and examine the base of such similar mushrooms, as well as cutting open young specimens to check the gills. Furthermore, the destroying angel grows in mossy woods and lives symbiotically with spruce.|$|E
25|$|On 3 August 1917 Mitchell had {{her third}} encounter, sailing south of Start Point {{in the guise}} of the French {{schooner}} Cancalais. She encountered a U-boat, UC-75, which approached, opening fire at a range of nearly three miles. Mitchell's crew again hove to and the panic party abandoned ship, while the gun crews waited for their target to come into range. However the U-boat was too cautious, and after being shelled for fifteen minutes, Lawrie elected to <b>clear</b> <b>away</b> and close under engine power. Mitchell was able to score some hits before the U-boat disappeared, but no loss was confirmed.|$|E

25|$|Minotaur took Neptuno in tow at 3.30 am {{the next}} day, and at {{daylight}} work began to <b>clear</b> <b>away</b> {{the wreckage of}} battle. As the storm rose, the towline snapped, putting Neptuno in danger of running onto a lee shore and being wrecked. The battered mainmast collapsed on 22 October, smashing through the captain's cabins below the poop, crushing to death Spanish paymaster Diego de Soto as he slept, and killing one of the British prize crew. Now completely dismasted the crew struggled {{to shore up the}} decks to prevent them from collapsing, and tried to jury rig sails.|$|E
25|$|Biannual and {{perennial}} plants produce a stout taproot {{of up to}} 8cm in diameter and 60cm long. Young plants consist of a rosette of leaves, which may be variegated, once-pinnately spiny-lobed, to 30cm long, and having short, fleshy stalks. The stems can be simple or carry many branches, and carry spiny wings along their lengths. The wavy leaves with prominent veins are pinnately divided and are alternately set along the stems. The leaf margin has prominent pale green or yellow veins and large teeth which are topped by fierce spines. The leaf surface may initially be covered in soft, felty hairs, which quickly <b>clear</b> <b>away,</b> most slowly on the veins.|$|E
25|$|Marulaz marched rapidly {{down the}} east bank of the Isar until he found his way blocked by Austrian {{infantry}} defending the southwest suburbs of Landshut. He sent a courier galloping for infantry assistance. Soon Louis Jacques de Coehorn's infantry brigade arrived and Marulaz asked him to <b>clear</b> <b>away</b> the Austrian foot soldiers. However, Coehorn was unwilling to advance without orders from his division commander, Michel Marie Claparède. When one of Masséna's staff officers tried to argue with Claparède, that general obstinately refused to help Marulaz. By the time Masséna appeared and ordered the infantry forward, it was too late; Hiller's troops escaped what might have become a trap.|$|E

25|$|The cathedral {{was damaged}} in the French Revolution when a mob began {{to destroy the}} {{sculpture}} on the north porch. This {{is one of the}} few occasions on which the anti-religious fervour was stopped by the townfolk. The Revolutionary Committee decided to destroy the cathedral via explosives, and asked a local architect to organise it. He saved the building by pointing out that the vast amount of rubble from the demolished building would so clog the streets it would take years to <b>clear</b> <b>away.</b> However, when metal was needed for the army the brass plaque in the centre of the labyrinth was removed and melted down; our only record of what was on the plaque was Felibien's description.|$|E
25|$|But Charles {{was in no}} case {{to resume}} his {{northern}} march. Fairfax and the New Model, after reducing Bridgwater, had turned back to <b>clear</b> <b>away</b> the Dorsetshire Clubmen and to besiege Sherborne Castle. On the completion of this task, it had been decided to besiege Bristol. On 23 August 1645, while the King's army was still in Huntingdon, and Goring was trying to raise a new army to replace {{the one he had}} lost at Langport and Bridgwater, the city was invested. In these urgent circumstances Charles left Oxford for the west only a day or two after he had come in from the Eastern Association raid. Calculating that Rupert could hold out longest, he first moved to the relief of Worcester.|$|E
25|$|At the Battle of Wagram on 5 and 6 July, Marulaz led the 23rd Chasseurs, Hesse-Darmstadt Chevaulégers, 1st Prince Royal Bavarian Chevauléger Regiment, and two Bavarian 6-pounder {{artillery}} batteries, a {{total of}} 1,223 sabers, 301 gunners, and 12 cannons. His other regiments were on detached duty. In {{the early hours of}} the first day, Marulaz crossed to the north bank with the rest of the IV Corps. Masséna posted his infantry with its left flank on the river and sent Marulaz and Lasalle to guard his right flank. While the infantry overran the Austrian riverbank defenses, the cavalry helped <b>clear</b> <b>away</b> some stray enemy units. Later in the day, he deployed on the left flank with IV Corps and missed the unsuccessful late afternoon attack.|$|E
