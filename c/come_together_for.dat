5|$|Simultaneously, an {{unrelated}} movement of communal singing was established throughout the South and Western states. A format of teaching music to illiterate people appeared in 1800. It used four sounds {{to symbolize the}} basic scale: fa-sol-la-fa-sol-la-mi-fa. Each sound {{was accompanied by a}} specifically shaped note and thus became known as shape note singing. The method was simple to learn and teach, so schools were established throughout the South and West. Communities would <b>come</b> <b>together</b> <b>for</b> an entire day of singing in a large building where they sat in four distinct areas surrounding an open space, one member directing the group as a whole. Most of the music was Christian, but the purpose of communal singing was not primarily spiritual. Communities either could not afford music accompaniment or rejected it out of a Calvinistic sense of simplicity, so the songs were sung a cappella.|$|E

25|$|On 1 September 1939, O'Brien {{became a}} {{full-time}} soldier as Deputy Assistant Director of Artillery (DADA) at Army Headquarters in Melbourne. When {{the government announced}} in February 1940 that it was raising the 7th Division for overseas service, O'Brien decided to join the Second Australian Imperial Force (AIF). His application was supported by Brigadier Cyril Clowes and Lieutenant Colonels Edward Milford, Charles Lloyd, {{all of whom were}} regular officers, and all of whom were appointed to commands in the 7th Division. O'Brien became a major in the AIF on 1 May 1940, receiving the AIF service number VX15127. He became adjutant of the 2/7th Field Regiment, and supervised the training of its 13th and 14th Batteries. O'Brien had to shuttle between their camps at Woodside, South Australia and Northam, Western Australia. The two batteries did not <b>come</b> <b>together</b> <b>for</b> the first time until they sailed for the Middle East on the SS Stratheden in November 1940.|$|E

500|$|Quolls ( [...] ; genus Dasyurus) are {{carnivorous}} marsupials {{native to}} mainland Australia, New Guinea, and Tasmania. They are primarily nocturnal and {{spend most of}} the day in a den. Of the six species of quoll, four are found in Australia and two in New Guinea. Another two species are known from fossil remains in Pliocene and Pleistocene deposits in Queensland. Genetic evidence indicates that quolls evolved around 15 million years ago in the Miocene, and that the ancestors of the six species had all diverged by around four million years ago. The six species vary in weight and size, from [...] to [...] They have brown or black fur and pink noses. They are largely solitary, but <b>come</b> <b>together</b> <b>for</b> a few social interactions such as mating which occurs during the winter season.

500|$|Pudús are solitary {{and only}} <b>come</b> <b>together</b> <b>for</b> rut. Mating season {{is in the}} Southern Hemisphere autumn, from April to May. Pudú DNA is {{arranged}} into 70 chromosomes. To mate, the pudú male rests his chin on the female's back, then sniffs her rear before mounting her from behind, holding her with his fore legs. The gestation period ranges from 202 to 223days (around 7months) with the average being 210days. A single offspring or sometimes twins are born in austral spring, from November to January. Newborns weigh [...] with the average birth weight being [...] Newborns less than [...] or more than [...] die. Females and males weigh the same at birth. Fawns have reddish-brown fur and southern pudú fawns have white spots running the length of their backs. Young are weaned after 2months. Females mature sexually in 6months, while males mature in 8–12months. Fawns are fully grown in 3months, but may stay with their mothers for 8 to 12months.|$|E

500|$|The {{social life}} of the adult male is very different. As he matures, a male spends more time {{at the edge of}} his group and {{associates}} with outside males or even other families. At Amboseli, young males spend over 80% of their time away from their families when they are 14–15. When males permanently leave, they either live alone or with other males. The former is typical of bulls in dense forests. Asian males are usually solitary, but occasionally form groups of two or more individuals; the largest consisted of seven bulls. Larger bull groups consisting of over 10 members occur only among African bush elephants, the largest of which numbered up to 144 individuals. These elephants can be quite sociable when not competing for dominance or mates, and will form long-term relationships. A dominance hierarchy exists among males, whether they range socially or solitarily. Dominance depends on the age, size and sexual condition, and when in groups, males follow the lead of the dominant bull. Young bulls may seek out the company and leadership of older, more experienced males, whose presence appears to control their aggression and prevent them from exhibiting [...] "deviant" [...] behaviour. Adult males and females <b>come</b> <b>together</b> <b>for</b> reproduction. Bulls associate with family groups if an oestrous cow is present.|$|E

You really don't know whether you want to diagram it, dance to it, or just be dumbstruck. It owes as much to Parliament-Funkadelic as it does to Samuel R. Delany and Octavia E. Butler. She is finally doing what a number of artists—particularly black artists—have not been able to do in years, and that's move pop music forward". Robert Christgau was less impressed in The Barnes & Noble Review, deeming it [...] "the most overrated album of the year" [...] while writing that Monáe's [...] "songwriting is 60th percentile, her singing technical, her sci-fi plot the usual rot".|$|E
