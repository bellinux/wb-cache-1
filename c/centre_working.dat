With this in mind, Menter Iaith Merthyr Tudful (the Merthyr Tydfil Welsh Language Initiative) has successfully transformed the Zoar Chapel and the adjacent vestry building in Pontmorlais {{into a community}} arts venue, Canolfan Soar and Theatr Soar, which run a whole programme of performance events and activities in both Welsh and English, together with a cafe and book shop, specialising in local interest and Welsh language books and CDs. Also on Pontmorlais, Merthyr Tydfil Housing Association was successful {{in a number of}} funding bids to develop the Old Town Hall into a new cultural <b>centre,</b> <b>working</b> in partnership with Canolfan a Theatr Soar to turn the Pontmorlais area into a cultural quarter. The Old Town Hall facility was launched on Saint David's Day 2014. With references to the 1831 Merthyr Rising and the building's red bricks, the venue has been named REDHOUSE – Hen Neuadd Y Dref / Old Town Hall. Merthyr Tydfil College's Arts and Media departments occupy part of the building, holding occasional professional performances at REDHOUSE's Dowlais Theatre and providing opportunities for students to perform dance, musicals, plays, and instrumental and vocal concerts.|$|E

40|$|Background Lean {{healthcare}} {{is claimed}} {{to contribute to}} improved patient satisfaction, but there is limited evidence to support this notion. This study investigates how primary-care <b>centres</b> <b>working</b> with Lean define and improve value from the patient's perspective, and how the application of Lean healthcare influences patient satisfaction. Methods This paper contains two qualitative case studies and a quantitative study based on results from the Swedish National Patient Survey. Through the case studies, we investigated how primary-care organisations realised the principle of defining and improving value from the patient's perspective. In the quantitative study, we compared results from the patient satisfaction survey for 23 primary-care <b>centres</b> <b>working</b> with Lean with a control group of 23 care <b>centres</b> not <b>working</b> with Lean. We also analysed changes in patient satisfaction over time. Results Our case studies reveal that Lean healthcare implementations primarily target efficiency and little {{attention is paid to}} the patient's perspective. The quantitative study shows no significantly better results in patient satisfaction for primary-care <b>centres</b> <b>working</b> with Lean healthcare compared with those not working with Lean. Further, care <b>centres</b> <b>working</b> with Lean show no significant improvements in patient satisfaction over time. Conclusions Lean healthcare implementations seem to have a limited impact on improving patient satisfaction. Care providers need {{to pay more attention to}} integrating the patient's perspective in the application of Lean healthcare. Value needs to be defined and value streams need to be improved based on both the knowledge and clinical expertise of care providers, and the preferences and needs of patients.

6000|$|I go to Concord in the morning, but {{shall have}} barely {{time to see}} [...] you there, even if I {{do as much as}} that; so that I can't forbear to [...] say to you now the word I wanted as to my {{impression}} of yesterday [...] about Hawthorne and Ellery Channing. Hawthorne isn't to me a [...] prepossessing figure, nor apparently at all an enjoying person in [...] any way: he has all the while the look--or would have to the [...] unknowing--of a rogue who suddenly finds himself in a company of [...] detectives. But in spite of his rusticity I felt a sympathy for [...] him fairly amounting to anguish, and couldn't take my eyes off him [...] all dinner, nor my rapt attention: as that indecisive little Dr. [...] Hedge[9] found, I am afraid, to his cost, for I hardly heard a word [...] of what he kept on saying to me, and resented his maliciously [...] putting his artificial person between me and the profitable object [...] of study. (It isn't however that I now feel any ill-will to him--I [...] could recommend anyone but myself to go and hear him preach. The [...] thing was that Hawthorne seemed to me to possess human substance [...] and not to have dissipated it all away like that culturally [...] debauched ----, or even like good inoffensive comforting [...] Longfellow.) John Forbes and you kept up the human balance at the [...] other end of the table, but my region was a desert with H. for its [...] only oasis. It was so pathetic to see him, contented sprawling [...] Concord owl that he was and always has been, brought blindfold into [...] that brilliant daylight and expected to wink and be lively, like [...] some dapper Tommy Titmouse. I felt him bury his eyes in his plate [...] and eat with such voracity that no one should dare to speak to him. [...] My heart broke for him as his attenuated left-hand neighbour kept [...] putting forth his long antennae to stroke his face and try [...] whether his eyes were open. It was heavenly to see him persist in [...] ignoring the spectral smiles--in eating his dinner and doing [...] nothing but that, and then go home to his Concord den to fall upon [...] his knees and ask his heavenly Father why it was that an owl [...] couldn't remain an owl and not be forced into the diversions of a [...] canary. I have no doubt that all the tenderest angels saw to his [...] case that night and poured oil into his wounds more soothing than [...] gentlemen ever know. W. Ellery Channing too seemed so human and [...] good--sweet as summer and fragrant as pinewoods. He is more [...] sophisticated than Hawthorne of course, but still he was kin; and I [...] felt the world richer by two men, who had not yet lost themselves [...] in mere members of society. This is what I suspect--that we are [...] fast getting so fearful one to another, we [...] "members of society" [...] that we shall ere long begin to kill one another in self-defence [...] and give place in that way at last to a more veracious state of [...] things. The old world is breaking up on all hands: the glimpse of [...] the everlasting granite I caught in H. and W. E. shows me that [...] there is stock enough left for fifty better. Let the old impostors [...] go, bag and baggage, for a very real and substantial one is aching [...] to come in, in which the churl shall not be exalted to a place of [...] dignity, in which innocence shall never be tarnished nor trafficked [...] in, in which every man's freedom shall be respected down to its [...] feeblest filament as the radiant altar of God. To the angels, says [...] Swedenborg, death means resurrection to life; by that necessary [...] rule of inversion which keeps them separate from us and us from [...] them, and so prevents our being mutual nuisances. Let us then [...] accept political and all other distraction that chooses to come; [...] because what is disorder and wrath and contention on the surface is [...] sure to be the greatest peace at the <b>centre,</b> <b>working</b> its way thus [...] to a surface that shall never be disorderly.|$|E
