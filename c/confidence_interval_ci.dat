40|$|Medication {{screening}} using Beers and stopp/start {{criteria for}} elderly patients: association between potentially inappropriate medication and medication-related hospital admissions OBJECTIVE To {{assess the risk}} of medication-related hospital admissions associated with inappropriate medication use applying the Beers and the stopp/start criteria. There are multiple screening methods to detect and reduce potentially inappropriate medication (pim) and prescribing omissions (ppos). Whether this will result in less medication-related hospitalisations is unknown. DESIGN A nested case-control {{study was conducted with}} a subset of patients of the Hospital Admissions Related to Medication (harm) study. METHODS Cases were defined as patients ≥ 65 years with a potentially preventable medication-related hospital admission. For each case one control was selected, matched on age and sex. The primary determinant was defined as the presence of one or more pims and/or ppos according to the Beers 2012 and the stopp/start criteria. The strength of the association between a pim/ppo and a medication-related hospital admission was evaluated with multivariate logistic regression and expressed as odds ratios with 95 % <b>confidence</b> <b>intervals</b> (<b>ci</b> 95). RESULTS pims and ppos detected with the stopp/start criteria are associated with medication-related hospital admissions (or 3. 47; ci 95 1. 70 - 7. 09), while for the presence of pims according to the Beers 2012 criteria a non-significant trend was visible (oradj 1. 49; ci 95 0. 90 - 2. 47). CONCLUSION Both the stopp/start criteria and the Beers 2012 criteria can be used to identify older people at risk for medication-related problems. The choice which set of criteria should be used is more dependent on other factors (e. g. national guidelines, practical considerations) than on the association of each set with adr-related hospital admission...|$|R

40|$|Background. Nocturnal oxyhaemoglobin {{desaturation}} (NOD, mean saturation < 96 % on overnight pulse oximetry) {{appears to}} be a predictor of central nervous system events and frequent pain in children with sickle cell disease (SCD). The risk factors are poorly understood. Aims. To undertake a secondary analysis of potential risk factors (age, genotype, haematocrit previous chest crisis, comorbid asthma or central nervous system disease and upper airway infection) for NOD in the East London cohort. Method. Of an unselected hospital cohort of children, 69 (median age 7. 8 (range 1 - 16. 5) years; 39 male) had overnight pulse oximetry at home between 1990 and 1995. Those over the age of 6 and any with CNS events were invited to have magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and angiography (MRA). Clinical details, including emergency department attendances and hospital admissions, were obtained from the hospitalnotes for the period preceding the overnight study. A sleep questionnaire was administered to a subset. Logistic regression was used to look at predictors of NOD. Results. For mean overnight saturation (SpO 2), the range was 84 - 99. 7 % (median 96. 1 %) and values were significantly lower in patients with HbSS (median 95. 4, range 84 - 99. 7 %) than in those with HbSC (median 97. 9, range 94. 8 - 98. 9 %) or Sb thalassaemia (median 97. 8, range 93. 5 - 99. 5 %). 25 children (36 %) had mean saturation < 96 %. 13 had dips in saturation suggesting OSA, of whom 10 also had mean saturation < 96 %. 36 completed the sleep questionnaire, of whom 30 snored (14 sometimes, 3 often, 13 always); {{there was no evidence that}} NOD was associated with concurrent snoring (Fisher’s exact test, p= 0. 8). Of 11 children with abnormal overnight studies who had repeat overnight pulse oximetry after adenotonsillectomy, 8 were still abnormal. In univariate logistic regression, genotype (OR 9. 00, 95 % ci 1. 08, 74. 7; p= 0. 04), haemogloin at the time of the study (odd ratio, OR 0. 64 95 % <b>confidence</b> <b>intervals,</b> <b>ci</b> 0. 47, 0. 87; p= 0. 005), greater age at first Casualty attendance for an upper airways infection (p= 0. 02) and abnormal MRA (OR 4. 5, 95 %ci 1. 24, 16. 3; p= 0. 02) were associated with OD and there were trends for white cell count at the time of the study (OR 1. 10, 95 % ci 1. 00, 1. 21; p= 0. 06) and infarction on MRI (OR 3. 14, 95 % ci 0. 67, 14. 6; p= 0. 15). There was no effect of age at sleep study, haemoglobin F, doctor-diagnosed asthma, number of admissions with chest infection or any other measure of complication rate. Both haemoglobin at the time of the study (OR 0. 68, 95 % ci 0. 48, 0. 95; p= 0. 02) and age at first upper airway infection (OR 1. 44, 95 % ci 1. 04, 1. 99; p= 0. 02) remained in the multiple logistic regression model. Summary and Conclusions. Nocturnal oxyhemoglobin desaturation is common in patients with HbSS, but is difficult to predict clinically and may not improve with adenotonsillectomy. Prospective studies of aetiology should commence in infancy and ideally include serial measurements of cerebral as well as lung function. If NOD is confirmed as a predictor of complications in SCD, treatment options might include hydroxyurea or overnight continuous positive airways pressure...|$|R

DS and MRA were compared with DGA, using the intraclass correlation coeficient (r) and its 95 % <b>confidence</b> <b>interval</b> (95 % <b>ci).</b> For each diagnostic test, the study group (20 Ics) was also divided in surgical patients (IC stenosis between 70 and 99 %) and non surgical patients, using kappa concordance coeficient (k) to compare the results. RESULTS: Main comparisons are: DS and DGA, r = 0. 71 (0. 4 - 0. 87); MRA and DGA, r = 0. 61 (0. 25 - 0. 82). After division into surgical vs. non-surgical groups, k = 0. 857 (p < 0. 0001) between DS and DGA; and k = 0. 545 (p = 0. 003) between MRA and DGA. Most DS and MRA errors occurred in IC sub-occlusions. CONCLUSION: The results suggest that when they are used together, DS and non-contrast MRA may substitute DGA in the evaluation of patients for IC stenosis surgery, except when there is discordance between their results or when the methods show sub-occlusive stenosis...|$|R
