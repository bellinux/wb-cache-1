50|$|Noise-immune <b>cavity-enhanced</b> optical-heterodyne {{molecular}} spectroscopy (NICE-OHMS) is an ultra-sensitive laser-based absorption technique that utilizes laser light {{to assess the}} concentration or the amount of a species in gas phase by absorption spectrometry (AS).|$|E
50|$|The most {{important}} resonant CEAS techniques are cavity ring-down spectrometry (CRDS), integrated cavity output spectroscopy (ICOS) or cavity enhanced absorption spectroscopy (CEAS), phase-shift cavity ring-down spectroscopy (PS-CRDS) and Continuous wave Cavity Enhanced Absorption Spectrometry (cw-CEAS), either with optical locking, {{referred to as}} (OF-CEAS), as has been demonstrated Romanini et al. or by electronic locking., as for example {{is done in the}} Noise-Immune <b>Cavity-Enhanced</b> Optical-Heterodyne Molecular Spectroscopy (NICE-OHMS) technique. or combination of frequency modulation and optical feedback locking CEAS, referred to as (FM-OF-CEAS).|$|E
50|$|Michael S. Feld {{received}} his Ph.D. education at MIT {{under the guidance}} of laser pioneer Ali Javan. He remained at MIT throughout his career, becoming faculty member in 1968 and, since 1976, director of the MIT George R. Harrison Spectroscopy Laboratory. He was well known in the field of quantum optics for his first observation of optical superradiance, experimental demonstrations of <b>cavity-enhanced</b> and cavity-suppressed spontaneous emission and the experimental demonstration of the first single atom laser. In the later part of his career he {{turned his attention to the}} field of biomedical optics, where he developed methods for in-tissue spectroscopy and imaging. Feld directed the Laser Biomedical Research Center at MIT, where he worked on fluorescence and Raman spectroscopy to measure in-vivo levels of biomarker molecules and image disease via endoscopy and optical tomography.|$|E
5000|$|Integrated cavity output {{spectroscopy}} (ICOS) {{sometimes called}} as <b>cavity-enhanced</b> absorption spectroscopy (CEAS) records the integrated intensity {{behind one of}} the cavity mirrors, while the laser is repeatedly swept across one or several cavity modes. However, for high finesse cavities the ratio of [...] "on" [...] and [...] "off" [...] a cavity mode is small, given by the inverse of the finesse, whereby the transmission as well as the integrated absorption becomes small. Off-axis ICOS (OA-ICOS) improves on this by coupling the laser light into the cavity from an angle with respect to the main axis so as to not interact with a high density of transverse modes. Although intensity fluctuations are lower than direct on-axis ICOS, the technique is, however, still limited by a low transmission and intensity fluctuations due to partly excitation of high order transverse modes, and can again typically reach sensitivities ~10−7 [...]|$|E
5000|$|However, all {{attempts}} to directly combine CEAS with a locking approach (DCEAS) {{have one thing in}} common; they do not manage to use the full power of the cavity, i.e. to reach LODs close to the (multi-pass) shot-noise level, which is roughly 2F/π times below that of DAS and can be down to ~10−13. The reason is twofold: (i) any remaining frequency noise of the laser relative to the cavity mode will, due to the narrow cavity mode, be directly converted to amplitude noise in the transmitted light, thereby impairing the sensitivity; and (ii) none of these techniques makes use of any modulation technique, wherefore they still suffers from the 1/f noise in the system. There is, however, one technique that so far has succeeded in making full use of the cavity by combining locked CEAS with FMS so as to circumvent both of these problems, and that is Noise-immune <b>cavity-enhanced</b> optical heterodyne molecular spectroscopy (NICE-OHMS). The first and so far ultimate realization of this technique, performed for frequency standard applications, reached an astonishing LODs of 5•10−13 (1•10−14 cm−1). It is clear that this technique, correctly developed, has a larger potential than any other technique for trace gas analysis! ...|$|E

40|$|Absorption {{spectroscopy}} {{is potentially}} an attractive detection technique for microfluidic applications, {{as it is}} universal, label-free, and rapid. However, the short optical pathlength through a microfluidic channel often imposes unacceptable limits on the detection sensitivity.

The general principles of broadband CEAS are outlined and general “pros and cons” discussed, detailing aspects like cavity mirror reflectivity calibration or the establishment of detection limits.

40|$|Raman {{spectroscopy}} {{has great}} {{potential as a}} tool {{in a variety of}} hydrothermal science applications. However, its low sensitivity has limited its use in common sea areas. In this paper, we develop a near-concentric <b>cavity-enhanced</b> Raman spectroscopy system to directly detect bicarbonate in seawater for the first time. With the aid of this near-concentric <b>cavity-enhanced</b> Raman spectroscopy system, a significant enhancement in HCO 3 − detection has been achieved. The obtained limit of detection (LOD) is determined to be 0. 37 mmol/L—much lower than the typical concentration of HCO 3 − in seawater. By introducing a specially developed data processing scheme, the weak HCO 3 − signal is extracted from the strong sulfate signal background, hence a quantitative analysis with R 2 of 0. 951 is made possible. Based on the spectra taken from deep sea seawater sampling, the concentration of HCO 3 − has been determined to be 1. 91 mmol/L, with a relative error of 2. 1 % from the reported value (1. 95 mmol/L) of seawater in the ocean.

40|$|The {{preparation}} and storage of photonic entanglement {{are central to}} the achievement of scalable linear optical quantum computation (LOQC). The most widely used photonic entanglement source (a spontaneous parametric downconversion (SPDC) source) is not directly suitable for storage, because its working frequency bandwidth is significantly larger than any available quantum memory. To remedy this problem, <b>cavity-enhanced</b> narrow-band SPDC sources have been developed. However, the storage of <b>cavity-enhanced</b> narrow-band entangled photons has not yet been achieved. Also, the spectral correlations between the entangled photons can make them practically useless for scalable LOQC. Here, we report the {{preparation and}} storage of frequency-uncorrelated narrowband (5 MHz) entangled photons from a <b>cavity-enhanced</b> SPDC source. The frequency correlation between the entangled photons is eliminated by changing the continuous UV pumping beam to short pulses. The storage of the polarization state of a single photon, and of a photon entangled with another flying in the fibre, is demonstrated. Our work demonstrates a quantum interface between narrow-band entangled photons from cavity SPDC and atomic quantum memory, and thus provides an important tool towards the achievement of all-optical quantum information processing. © 2011 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

40|$|The {{desire to}} {{increase}} the sensitivity of solution-based absorption spectroscopy is motivated by the need for label-free biosensing (which provides a more authentic indication {{of the state of}} a biological system) and by the usefulness of characterizing the kinetics of biologically-relevant reactions (which may not be accurately characterizable at reagent concentrations required by standard methods. There are a number of techniques by which such increasingly sensitive measurements have been made, including cavity ringdown spectroscopy, incoherent <b>cavity-enhanced</b> spectroscopy, microsphere-based whispering-gallery mode sensing,and our <b>cavity-enhanced</b> measurements, which are the most sensitive to date and which can be conducted in real time with high bandwidth. Our current device has a demonstrated detection threshold of 1. 7 x 10 ^- 7 /sqrtHz (4. 36 x 10 ^- 6 cm^- 1), which could with further technical work be improved to a shot-noise limited sensitivity of 1. 93 x 10 ^- 10 /sqrtHz (1. 06 x 10 ^- 8 cm^- 1). The latter would correspond to an average of 700 strong absorbers (epsilon = 10 ^ 5 M^- 1 cm^- 1) in the optical beam volume. The shot-noise limited detection threshold of our measurement method could potentially be improved by up to two orders of magnitude by incorporating state-of-the-art optical mirrors. With such mirrors, <b>cavity-enhanced</b> absorption experiments performed with gas-phase samples have previously demonstrated single molecule sensitivity. We have established that solution-based <b>cavity-enhanced</b> absorption measurements are more sensitive than standard single-pass measurements by the predicted enhancement factor for our present device (20, 000). These measurements provide the proof-of-principle for solution-based, <b>cavity-enhanced</b> spectroscopy and serve as the intermediate step towards the attainment of the theoretical sensitivity of this technique. We believe that this device will be of broad interest to the scientific community, because it is presently the most sensitive solution-based spectroscopic device. It can make real-time absorption measurements which would allow monitoring of the kinetics of chemical reactions in which the spectral properties of reactants change by even a small amount, and, near its theoretical limit of sensitivity (given currently available mirrors), such a device could potentially resolve single-molecule absorption events on the sub-millisecond timescale and below. ...|$|E

The scattering signal was measured with a single-channel photomultiplier tube (PMT), providing an averaged value over a narrow bandwidth (full-width at half-maximum, FWHM, ~ 9 nm) in the spectral region of 465 – 474 nm. A scattering coefficient at a wavelength of 470 nm was deduced as an averaged scattering value over the spectral region of 465 – 474 nm and used for data analysis and instrumental performance comparison.
