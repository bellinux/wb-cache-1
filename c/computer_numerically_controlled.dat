Exploration of small-scale design and intelligent systems reveals a connection between local resources and new technologies that advance yesterday’s way of building. The study focuses on the challenges of a vulnerable island community, addressing Hawaii’s major housing crisis {{and the effects of}} impending climate change. Isolation and a global market has encouraged dependency on imports and deterred the state from achieving sustainability. At the intersection of localized materials and global technologies, this project argues a simple and practical solution. Through a series of case study investigations and applied research on innovative design strategies, it establishes the framework for an alternative building model of less permanent and more process-based structures. Rescaling Urbanism reveals the potential for a system that can challenge the existing methods of Hawaii’s building industry. The project embraces the use of local material with new technologies in digital fabrication to create a streamlined approach for building sustainably in Hawaii. To compliment new statewide green initiatives, we must learn to embrace the use of vernacular materials, renewable energies, and closed-loop systems. Hawaii’s surplus of invasive tree species bears the potential for local renewable building materials. This study examines the use of lumber from the highly invasive albizia tree as a building v material through application of wood engineering. By reconceptualizing the tree from invasive to useful, a problem becomes a viable solution to Hawaii’s housing deficit and outsourced building industry. This project integrates the design and construction process by proposing a structure that is composed almost entirely of albizia and digitally fabricated from <b>computer</b> <b>numerically</b> <b>control,</b> or CNC routing. Engineered wood is a resource-light material that supports rapid on-site construction. CNC routing is being increasingly utilized with engineered wood to streamline the entire building process.

40|$|Throughout {{history the}} use of scale {{representations}} has been important {{in the process of}} creating architecture. In recent times the introduction of computer-aided design (CAD) has significantly altered traditional methods of conceptual design representation, mainly through a shift from the physical to the virtual. The aim of the research is to explore the relationship between computer aided manufacturing (CAM) and the methods for extracting and producing qualities of a conceptual nature from <b>computer</b> and <b>numerically</b> <b>controlled</b> (CNC) machine, and how this could advance conceptual creativity formulating in buildable form. The qualities that are inherently produced by CNC machining processes are then captured back into the three-dimensional environment (CAD), and then re-exported via CNC machining. The information that flows from the digital to the physical and then back again, creates new physical qualities that would not normally be produced, and allows for further investigation. Through the misrepresentation and reinterpretation of machine processes in this research, the output produces an object of an abstract nature created through identifying extraordinary expressions of tool paths. This 1 : 1 abstract object expresses qualities of craft produced by the CNC machine and creates a new form of craft that can be compared to the expression of the traditional craftsman and their trade. This simple movement between scales and formats begins to generate new design processes that in turn translate the conceptual expression of the object into a buildable form. On final completion of the object this project has proven that CAM conceptual creativity can be translated and formulated into built form. A key observation of this research is that identifying CAM production techniques can produce abstract representation through a new means of design representation...|$|R
