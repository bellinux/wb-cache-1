40|$|AbstractVertical <b>crankshaft</b> <b>forging</b> presses are {{designed}} for precision die forging and calibrating large series, large dimensions and power demanding forgings. Forming is carried out in several die cavities with increasing complexity, for example, intended for the aerospace and automotive industries. Transfer of vertical forging press workforce is realized between crankshaft and ram through the inserted connecting rod and coupling or sliding joint. The accuracy of these presses {{is directly related to}} their stiffness. Designers are therefore looking for ways to increase the stiffness. One of the possibilities is to increase the rigidity of the transmission of power from the crankshaft to the forging. The subject of this paper is comparing the conventional press with power transmission using the crank mechanism and the press with yoke mechanism...|$|E

25|$|Chassis {{and engine}} changes {{made to the}} {{experimental}} 4CLs eventually coalesced into the 4CLT, the appended T denoting its tubular chassis. The improvements in torsional rigidity that the tubular construction brought were required to counteract the increases in torque and power resulting from the twin-supercharger upgrade of the elderly inline-4 engine. Power was up to approximately , from the 4CL's 220. Other changes included the use of roller bearings for the <b>crankshaft,</b> <b>forged</b> (rather than cast) rear suspension components, and the chassis was designed to run with hydraulic dampers from the outset.|$|R
40|$|Abstract:The overall {{objective}} of this project was to evaluate and compare the fatigue performance of two competing manufacturing technologies for aerospace <b>crankshafts,</b> namely <b>forged</b> steel and ductile cast iron. In this project a dynamic simulation was conducted on two <b>crankshafts,</b> <b>forged</b> steel and ductile cast iron, from similar four cylinder four stroke engines. Finite element analysis was performed to obtain the variation of stress magnitude at critical locations. The pressure-volume diagram was {{used to calculate the}} load boundary condition in dynamic simulation model, and other simulation inputs were taken from the engine specification chart. The dynamic analysis was done analytically and was verified by simulations in ANSYS. Results achieved from aforementioned analysis were used in optimization of the <b>forged</b> steel <b>crankshaft.</b> Geometry, material, and manufacturing processes were optimized considering different constraints, manufacturing feasibility, and cost. The optimization Process included geometry changes compatible with the current engine, fillet rolling, and the use of micro alloyed steel, resulting in increased fatigue strength and reduced cost of the crankshaft, without changing connecting rod and or engine block...|$|R
5000|$|The CLK55 AMG {{is powered}} by a hand-assembled 5.4-liter V8 engine.

Its bore and stroke are 97mm x 92mm. The dual-resonance intake manifold with tuned runners helps create optimized torque and power outputs by taking advantage of two resonant frequencies to increase performance. The engine features a high compression ratio of 10.5:1. All of these advanced technologies help deliver a healthy [...] and 376 lbft Nm of torque.|$|R
50|$|Large-scale {{changes were}} made in 2001, with a {{complete}} restyling of the bodywork by designer Gareth Davies, a newly designed engine raising the horsepower to 149 with internal performance upgrades included <b>Forged</b> steel <b>crankshaft,</b> <b>forged</b> steel connecting rods, and forged aluminium pistons. Focussed on reducing weight and better handling, the 2001 955i used a more common double-sided swing arm (DSSA) {{as opposed to the}} single-sided swing arm (SSSA) of the previous Daytonas. The DSSA version weighs 7.5 lb less than the SSSA due to the lighter weight swing arm, and it is argued that the DSSA version handles better than the SSSA as it has less flex in the swing arm. The 2001+ 955i version had a more compact and advanced Sagem MC1000 electronic engine management system (2-plug) instead of the original Sagem MC2000 controller (1-plug).|$|R
50|$|<b>Crankshafts</b> can be <b>forged</b> from a {{steel bar}} usually through roll forging or cast in ductile steel. Today {{more and more}} {{manufacturers}} tend to favor the use of <b>forged</b> <b>crankshafts</b> due to their lighter weight, more compact dimensions and better inherent damping. With <b>forged</b> <b>crankshafts,</b> vanadium microalloyed steels are mostly used as these steels can be air cooled after reaching high strengths without additional heat treatment, with exception to the surface hardening of the bearing surfaces. The low alloy content also makes the material cheaper than high alloy steels. Carbon steels are also used, but these require additional heat treatment to reach the desired properties. Iron crankshafts are today mostly found in cheaper production engines (such as {{those found in the}} Ford Focus diesel engines) where the loads are lower. Some engines also use cast iron crankshafts for low output versions while the more expensive high output version use forged steel.|$|R

50|$|The M121 engine {{featured}} a single chain driven overhead camshaft layout with staggered valves operated by {{long and short}} rocker arms. The cylinder block was made from cast iron. The cylinder bore diameter for the M121 was 85 milimeters. The three ring <b>crankshaft</b> was <b>forged.</b> The stroke of the engine was 83.6 mm. This gave the M121 a displacement of 1897 cc, or 1.9 liters when rounded. The engine had a compression of 8.5:1. Through this configuration, the M121 BII engine had an initial rating of 110 horsepower at 5500 RPM and 114 lb-ft of torque at 4000 RPM. After testing of the final vehicle, the horsepower rating was lowered to 105. The crankshaft was carried by three main bearings. In the 190 SL, the engine had two parallel carburetors.|$|R
50|$|The Mk.XII {{was further}} {{developed}} by using Cosworth 12 bolt <b>forged</b> steel <b>crankshaft,</b> Cosworth <b>forged</b> conrods, wilder camshafts and Weber 45DCOE for Formula racing {{to become the}} Cosworth Mk.XIII (83.50mm x 72.75mm, 1594 cc, 140-150 bhp). This Mk.XIII became a big seller in 1965 when the SCCA created Formula B category in America. As a result, not only did SCCA Formula B practically become a Cosworth-engine class (inherited later by Cosworth BDD when it became Formula Atlantic), helping Cosworth establish its corporate financial base, but ironically this enabled the now-viable engineering firm to move from near-total dependence on Lotus. The proliferation of the Mk.XIII triggered establishment of new European style racing engine builders in the US, performing rebuilding and maintenance work needed on the Mk.XIII, who also contributed to Cosworth's revenue.|$|R

50|$|The 273 (4.5 L) was {{the first}} LA engine, {{beginning}} model year 1964 and offered through 1969, rated at 180 BHP. It had a 3.625 in (92 mm) bore and 3.31 in (84 mm) stroke. It had a mechanical solid lifter valvetrain until 1968 when hydraulic lifters were introduced; hydraulic lifters generally make for a quieter valvetrain. The reciprocating assembly included a cast or <b>forged</b> steel <b>crankshaft,</b> drop <b>forged</b> steel connecting rods and cast aluminum pistons. The valvetrain consisted of a cast nodular iron camshaft, solid or hydraulic lifters, solid pushrods and shaft-mounted, malleable iron rocker arms (stamped steel on later hydraulic-cam engines). These actuated the overhead steel intake and exhaust valves. The cylinder heads featured wedge-shaped combustion chambers with a single intake and a single exhaust valve for each cylinder. Spark plugs were located {{in the side of}} the cylinder head, between the exhaust ports.|$|R
5000|$|The Hemi is also {{available}} in a [...] version.

The engine block is different from the 5.7, with revised coolant channels and oil jets to cool the pistons. A <b>forged</b> <b>crankshaft,</b> lighter pistons, and strengthened connecting rods aid durability. A cast aluminum intake manifold is tuned for high-RPM power and does not include variable-length technology. Chrysler's Multi-Displacement System is not used on the 6.1.|$|R
5000|$|The L20B was a 1,952 cc (85.0 x 86.0 mm) engine {{produced}} from 1974 through 1985. It produces [...] in 1974-75 form with 112 lbft Nm of torque as {{installed in the}} Datsun 610 and [...] in 1977-78 form with 102 lbft Nm of torque as installed in the 200SX. The L20B engine introduced larger-diameter (60 mm) main bearings while retaining a fully counterweighted <b>crankshaft.</b> The <b>forged</b> U60 <b>crankshaft</b> also ushered {{in the use of}} a six-bolt flywheel boss. The block introduced a taller deck height to accommodate the longer stroke and connecting rods. This specification would also be used later in the Z20 and Z22 engine series. The bigger powerplant even helped spawn an important new offering from Datsun's competition department -50mm Solex twin-choke carburetor kits- complete fuel systems that help produce nearly double the power from the ubiquitous L20B. The legendary robustness and nearly square configuration have made this engine a popular choice among tuners for turbocharging.|$|R
50|$|Douglas {{motorcycles}} {{also became}} popular in dirt track racing. The 1923 RA model with disc brakes was favoured initially and this prompted Douglas to build specific dirt track models. These motorcycle designs were gradually increased {{in size and}} power with 500 cc and 600 cc engines fitted to the DT5 and DT6 Dirt Track models in the late 1920s and early 1930s. The engines had hemispherical heads and a short rigid <b>forged</b> <b>crankshaft.</b> They dominated dirt track racing for about three years. In 1929, the most successful dirt racing year, 1,200 Dirt Track motorcycles were sold.|$|R
50|$|The M30 was {{originally}} {{developed in the}} late 1960s, loosely based on the straight-four BMW M10 engine first used in the 'Neue Klasse' BMW 1500. Several features, including a profile lowering 30-degree slant to the right, a crossflow head (a gas flow head in later designs) and a chain-driven single overhead cam with rocker arm valve actuation are common between the M10 and the M30. Further similarities include a cast-iron block with an aluminium head and a <b>forged</b> <b>crankshaft.</b> The first two engines introduced were the 2.8 and the 2.5 litre option, both short-stroke engines sharing a common bore.|$|R
50|$|The 303 CID L engine had {{hydraulic}} lifters, an oversquare bore:stroke ratio, a counterweighted <b>forged</b> <b>crankshaft,</b> aluminum pistons, floating wristpins, and a dual-plane intake manifold. The 303 {{was produced}} from 1949-1953. Bore was 3.75 in and stroke was 3.4375 in. Cadillac used a distantly related engine {{which appeared in}} three different sizes through to the 1962 model year; though the Oldsmobile and Cadillac motors were not physically related, many lessons learned by one division were incorporated into the others design, and the result were two engines known for their excellent power-to-weight ratio, fuel economy, and smooth, strong, reliable running.|$|R
50|$|During the Occupation of France and in {{the years}} shortly after World War II, Régnier {{designed}} and produced a set of three simplified four-cylinder inverted air-cooled inline engines of increasing capacity and power, the 4J, 4K and 4L. The specifications of the post-war 4L engine are similar, though not identical to, those of the pre-war R.4, whilst those of the pre-war R.4L specifications are closer {{to that of the}} post-war 4K. In 1946 or 1947, Régnier, now nationalised, was absorbed into SNECMA and the 4L engines, the most widely used member of the series, became the SNECMA-Régnier 4L. Notable constructional features, shared with the 4J and 4K engines, included machined steel cylinder barrels with external baked-on anti-corrosion varnish and separate cylinder heads with unusual metallo-plastic seals, held to the crankcase by long bolts. Screwed-in plug bushes and valve seats were made from aluminium-bronze. The 4L's five-bearing steel <b>crankshaft</b> was <b>forged,</b> as were the duralumin connecting rods which had split, steel backed, bronze bearings. The crankcase was cast from aluminium alloy.|$|R
5000|$|Due to {{the speed}} with which the 244 engine was moved from design to production, engines failed in service with high {{frequency}} in 1946 and 1947. For example the first 20 of the 244 engines installed in GM&O freight units had to be rebuilt with new <b>forged</b> <b>crankshafts.</b> [...] Despite the redesign of <b>crankshafts,</b> the new <b>forged</b> versions continued to fail, particularly in the 12-cylinder engines; this problem was traced to metallurgical flaws in components from a supplier. [...] Flaws in welding main bearing saddles to the engine block resulted in about 600 blocks replaced, while both the saddles and bearings themselves required redesign and replacement. [...] GE air-cooled RD-1 turbocharger assemblies also required repeated redesign of both manifolds and turbines. By early 1948, ALCO had spent $4.3 million on field repairs and modifications of 244 engines. In 1950, the first engines with upgrades new from the factory, dubbed the 244D, were installed in locomotives, beginning with the RS-3. [...] In 1953, the RD-1 and RD-2 turbochargers were replaced with GE water-cooled RD-3 and RD-4 models, followed the next year by ALCO-designed and built 510 and 710 turbos. This corresponded with the refinement of the 244 to versions 244G and 244H. The Alco 244H engine is also known as the Alco 250 engine. This was done by Alco to disassociate the 250 from the troublesome 244 engine. The 250 was produced for a short time from 1955 into 1956. It was also used as a standard to rebuild older 244 engines at Schenectady.|$|R
50|$|Also {{during the}} late sixties and early seventies, the 300 was used in larger {{vehicles}} such as dump trucks, many weighing into the 15,000-20,000 pound (7,000-9,000 kg) range. These 300s were equipped with a higher flow HD (Heavy Duty) exhaust manifold and <b>forged</b> <b>crankshafts</b> and rods since the engines {{were going to be}} constantly working in the 3000-4000 rpm range. These rare, yet effective manifolds had a much higher exhaust flow rate {{due to the fact that}} many of these engines would spend hours at 3000 RPMs or more. Due to their straightforward and high flowing design, enthusiasts often seek these manifolds out due to the ease in which they allow turbochargers to be retrofitted to the engine.|$|R
