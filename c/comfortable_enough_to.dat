40|$|The {{integration}} of electronic devices and sensors into textiles has many different potential applications. Textile fabrics, from clothing to upholstery and home textiles, {{are an integral}} part of daily life and the ability to combine electronics into textiles means that a huge range of valuable data can be collected and used by the wearer to monitor their health, performance and wellbeing, among other uses. One of the most pressing challenges is that of interconnecting electronic components via the textile fibres in a robust and reliable way. Another aspect to be studied is the ability for the electronics to be connected and disconnected when necessary; for example, when charging the batteries or washing the garment. It is this aspect that has been considered by this development to facilitate ease-of-use among the older people. In addition, the complete package must be <b>comfortable</b> <b>enough</b> not <b>to</b> restrict movement, and must be unobtrusive so as to avoid any embarrassment to the wearer.

Starting in the late 1970s, improved rigid materials which were oxygen-permeable were developed. Contact lenses made from these materials are called rigid gas permeable lenses or 'RGPs'.|$|E

Andy Gill of The Independent writes that he [...] "eschews anger or threat for a weariness shadowed by wistful regret." [...] Music journalist Greg Kot comments that Drake does not [...] "indulge in the macho poses that have dominated mainstream hip-hop for decades, and blur the line between singing and rhyming", adding that he [...] "makes his rhymes sound conversational, matter of fact, like he’s talking to the listener one-one-one". Tim Sendra of AllMusic notes that his [...] "introspective tone [...] is only rarely punctured by aggressive tracks, boasts, and/or come-ons." [...] Drake's persona on songs shows traits of sincerity, self-doubt, regret, passive-aggressiveness, and self-absorption. Kazeem Famuyide of The Source explains his conflicted persona as being [...] "arrogant enough to know his place {{as one of the}} most successful artist in hip-hop, and <b>comfortable</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> realize his own faults in his personal life." [...] Jon Dolan of Rolling Stone writes that Drake [...] "collaps many moods – arrogance, sadness, tenderness and self-pity – into one vast, squish-souled emotion."

The poem is read aloud, filling Andrés with jealousy, for which Preciosa slightly taunts him for being weakened by a piece of paper.|$|R

Lisa MacLeod, the critic for education from the Progressive Conservative Party, stated [...] "parents have not asked for this type of sexually explicit information to be made available to their children.

The grass with which the open country was covered as far as I could see amongst the patches of forest was of a bright scarlet hue, excepting along the water-courses, where it was white. Lazily cropping it at some little distance away, or lying in it, indolently chewing the cud and attended by a man half-clad in skins and bearing a crook, was a flock of tigers.
