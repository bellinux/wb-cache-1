5|$|The Holocaust in Nazi-occupied Lithuania {{resulted}} in the near total destruction of Lithuanian Jews (Litvaks), living in Generalbezirk Litauen of Reichskommissariat Ostland within the Nazi-controlled Lithuanian SSR. Out of approximately 208,000-210,000 Jews, an estimated 190,000–195,000 were murdered {{before the end of}} World War II (wider estimates are sometimes published), most between June and December 1941. More than 95% of Lithuania's Jewish population was massacred over the three-year German occupation — a more complete destruction than befell any other <b>country</b> <b>affected</b> by the Holocaust. Historians attribute this to the massive collaboration in the genocide by the non-Jewish local paramilitaries, though the reasons for this collaboration are still debated. The Holocaust {{resulted in}} the largest-ever loss of life in so short a period of {{time in the history of}} Lithuania.|$|E

2500|$|Since Reichenau's {{order was}} widely {{understood}} as endorsing the mass killings of Ukrainian Jews which {{were going on}} behind the German lines, with which 6th Army at any rate was actively co-operating, Rundstedt's open endorsement of its strongly anti-Semitic language clearly contradicts his later assertions {{that he did not know}} what the Einsatzgruppen were doing. He told interrogators in 1946 that he was aware of just one atrocity, at Berdichev on 30 July. At Nuremberg he sought to portray the issue in terms of anti-partisan warfare: [...] "Disorderly, irregular warfare behind the front of the Army must bring very great misery to the population of the <b>country</b> <b>affected.</b> No army in the world can tolerate such conditions for any length of time, but in the interests of the security and protection of its own troops it must take sharp, energetic measures. But this should, of course, be done in a correct and soldierly manner." [...] Rundstedt shared the general German Army prejudice against the Ostjuden (Eastern Jews) found in the Soviet Union. He described Zamosc as [...] "a dirty Jewish hole." ...|$|E

She had been greatly attached to her mistress, who had treated her rather as a friend than as a servant; and that he should have insulted and threatened Margaret was in her eyes an offence so serious that she considered it richly deserved the punishment that had befallen him.|$|E

40|$|Background Poverty {{is highly}} {{concentrated}} in <b>countries</b> <b>affected</b> by armed conflict {{which are the}} furthest from reaching the Millennium Development Goals. Tracking aid patterns for health is crucial for improving the effectiveness of external aid to <b>countries</b> <b>affected</b> by armed conflict which tend to depend heavily upon external assistance and also have particularly acute health needs. Objectives This study systematically assesses the reliability of global aid databases which are commonly used for tracking aid to <b>countries</b> <b>affected</b> by armed conflict. It offers analyses of two main databases - the Creditor Reporting System (CRS) and the Financial Tracking System (FTS) by reviewing {{the strengths and weaknesses}} of these data sources. Methods A literature review was conducted to assess the existing evidence on aid tracking generally, and aid databases more broadly. Interviews were also conducted with experts involved in health resource tracking, donor agencies, and NGOs. Results Despite limitations, the CRS and FTS are appropriate for tracking aid for conflict-affected countries as they are comprehensive and allow analysis of different aid activities, countries, years, and donors. Conclusions The study offers recommendations on how CRS and FTS might be enhanced to try and improve the accountability and effectiveness of aid to <b>countries</b> <b>affected</b> by armed conflict.
