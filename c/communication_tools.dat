40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the usage (diffusion) of the Beaumont <b>Communication</b> <b>Tool,</b> as part of a {{formative}} evaluation, to determine who is using the <b>communication</b> <b>tool,</b> perceptions of strengths and weaknesses of the <b>communication</b> <b>tool,</b> and perceptions of the effectiveness of the <b>communication</b> <b>tool</b> in facilitating communications with nonverbal patients. A total of 90 nurses and ancillary professionals, who used the <b>communication</b> <b>tool</b> completed an original survey to determine strengths and weaknesses of the tool, use with patients and families, and reasons why the tool is used or not used in their areas. The staff members provided their professional characteristics and characteristics of their noncommunicative patients. The responses from participants indicated a lack of use of the <b>communication</b> <b>tool</b> on a regular basis. The results indicated that professional characteristics and patient characteristics were not predictors of either the use or nonuse of the <b>communication</b> <b>tool.</b> Visuals, text and graphics, as well as perceived effectiveness of the tool with patients and families were found to be predictors of the use of the <b>communication</b> <b>tool.</b> The <b>communication</b> <b>tool</b> was developed for use with noncommunicative patients following the systems approach in Instructional Technology. The lack of use may have been due to a lack of training in appropriate use of the <b>communication</b> <b>tool.</b> Nurses and other professional ancillary staff members may also have not had sufficient time with each patient to use the tool effectively. Further research and evaluation are needed to determine how the tool can be designed with greater input from the staff who will be using it, so that a greater number of staff are aware that the tool exists and are familiar with ways of using it. At the same time, further evaluation may determine how an educational tool can be distributed to staff members in a large organization, may contribute to the diffusion process, and determine use with patients who are noncommunicative. It may no longer be enough for a designer to create an effective educational product; the end steps in the systems design approach must be reexamined and emphasized in the process...|$|R

Online community services are sometimes considered social-network services, though in a broader sense, a social-network service usually provides an individual-centered service whereas online community services are group-centered. Social networking sites allow users to share ideas, digital photos and videos, posts, and to inform others about online or real-world activities and events with people in their network. While in-person social networking – such as gathering in a village market to talk about events – has existed since the earliest development of towns, the Web enables people to connect with others who live in different locations, ranging from across a city to across the world. Depending on the social media platform, members {{may be able to}} contact any other member. In other cases, members can contact anyone they have a connection to, and subsequently anyone that contact has a connection to, and so on. LinkedIn, a career-oriented social-networking service, generally requires that a member personally know another member in real life before they contact them online. Some services require members to have a preexisting connection to contact other members.|$|E
2500|$|These {{and other}} {{articles}} describe new challenges and solutions to use BCI technology to help persons with DOC. One major challenge {{is that these}} patients cannot use BCIs based on vision. Hence, new tools rely on auditory and/or vibrotactile stimuli. Patients may wear headphones and/or vibrotactile stimulators placed on the wrists, neck, leg, and/or other locations. Another challenge is that patients may fade {{in and out of}} consciousness, and can only communicate at certain times. This may indeed be a cause of mistaken diagnosis. Some patients may only be able to respond to physicians' requests during a few hours per day (which might not be predictable ahead of time) and thus may have been unresponsive during diagnosis. Therefore, new methods rely on tools that are easy to use in field settings, even without expert help, so family members and other persons without any medical or technical background can still use them. This reduces the cost, time, need for expertise, and other burdens with DOC assessment. Automated tools can ask simple questions that patients can easily answer, such as [...] "Is your father named George?" [...] or [...] "Were you born in the USA?" [...] Automated instructions inform patients that they may convey yes or no by (for example) focusing their attention on stimuli on the right vs. left wrist. This focused attention produces reliable changes in EEG patterns that can help determine that the patient is able to communicate. The results could be presented to physicians and therapists, which could lead to a revised diagnosis and therapy. In addition, these patients could then be provided with BCI-based <b>communication</b> <b>tools</b> that could help them convey basic needs, adjust bed position and HVAC (heating, ventilation, and air conditioning), and otherwise empower them to make major life decisions and communicate.|$|E
