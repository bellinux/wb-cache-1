5000|$|The book Farewell Victoria (1933) by T. H. White has {{the protagonist}} ending {{his days as}} a hansom <b>cab</b> <b>operator</b> in its fading years, {{which is part of the}} {{sustained}} metaphor brought out in the title.|$|E
5000|$|He is {{credited}} with a lifetime batting average of over [...]400 against all competition, and hit [...]319 in four winters in Cuba. A tantalizing aspect of his career is his success against white major league teams. Poles hit [...]610 against these teams, including three consecutive hits off Grover Cleveland Alexander. Poles spent his post-baseball years as a taxi <b>cab</b> <b>operator</b> and working at Olmsted Air Force Base in Middletown, Pennsylvania, enabling him to retire comfortably. Because of his Army service, Spottswood Poles was buried in Arlington National Cemetery.|$|E
5000|$|A second [...] "taxi war" [...] broke out, with Checker Taxi Co and Terminal Taxi Co {{operators}} {{fighting it}} out in New York City. To end the dispute, New York Mayor Jimmy Walker created the New York Taxi Cab Commission (now called the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission), which issued {{a limited number of}} <b>cab</b> <b>operator</b> permits, called [...] "medallions", and mandated that cabs have seating for five passengers in the rear compartment, which favored Checker {{and a handful of other}} manufacturers that built automobiles which met this requirement. Over the next three decades, Markin was involved in the formation of [...] "Checker Taxi" [...] or [...] "Checker Cab" [...] companies in a number of major U.S. cities.|$|E
5000|$|Outside London, <b>cab</b> <b>operators</b> {{in major}} UK cities like Manchester, Birmingham, Glasgow and Liverpool ran FX3s, either bought new {{or when they}} were retired from service in the capital. Examples of four-door FX3s were known to run in Manchester, where, in common with every other UK local {{authority}} outside London [...] different taxi licensing regulations were enforced. Several FX3s were exported to Madrid, Spain and proved successful. Attempts to sell them to the United States were a failure.|$|R
5000|$|The Disney's Magical Express service {{initially}} faced {{strong opposition}} from the Greater Orlando Livery Association and Orlando-area ground transportation companies and taxi <b>cab</b> <b>operators,</b> who argued that it allows Disney to [...] "whisk away" [...] potential customers who would otherwise have continued on to a taxi cab or private transportation service for transportation to their hotel, and keeps them from leaving Disney property during their trip to spend money elsewhere, since {{they do not need}} a rental car or other transportation to get to their resort.|$|R
25|$|Within {{the city}} {{there have been}} two tram {{networks}} in operation. A proposal to develop a horse-drawn tram (linking the city's railway termini) was made by American George Francis Train in the 1860s, and implemented in 1872 by the Cork Tramway Company. However, the company ceased trading in 1875 after Cork Corporation refused permission to extend the line, mainly because of objections from <b>cab</b> <b>operators</b> to the type of tracks which – although they were laid to the Irish national railway gauge of 5ft 3in – protruded from the road surface.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The cabs of {{vehicles}} used in mines are complex man-machine interfaces since those vehicles normally operated in harsh environment. Multi-level fuzzy evaluation theory {{is a method}} used to study these interfaces. This paper describes the user sensory experience theory, based on which we establish fuzzy evaluation indexes and man-machine fuzzy evaluation prototype. Then, the method to determine the levels of factor weights and the selected approach of fuzzy synthetic operation has been developed. Finally, a case study has been presented to evaluate certain types of mine vehicle cabs. An overview of mine vehicles and operation environment Mine vehicles act as the main transport equipment to address short distance transportation requirement in mine production. This requires that mine vehicles are capable of dealing with steep slopes, multiple comers, extreme temperature conditions, and long working period. Therefore, a decent interface in mine vehicles can reduce the possibilities of drivers ' fatigue during their driving experience. <b>Cab</b> <b>operator</b> interface as a complex man-machine interface, the design {{should focus on the}} following factors: seat comfortably, steering and transmission and other handling ability, car interna...|$|E
5000|$|Denver, Colorado - Companies are {{required}} to hold business, tax license and insurance and are subject to inspections by the Traffic Engineer. All drivers {{are required}} to obtain a pedal <b>cab</b> <b>operators</b> license from the Office of Excise and License. Pedal cabs are allowed to operate anywhere in Denver County except for certain daytime restrictions. Sport and event centers, such as Invesco Field and the Pepsi Center, set their own rules for where on the property pedal cabs can operate and usually restrict their access to working one entrance.|$|R

50|$|There {{are many}} yellow <b>cab</b> taxicab <b>operators</b> {{around the world}} (some with common heritage, some without). The {{original}} Yellow Cab Company, based in Chicago, Illinois, {{was one of the}} largest taxicab companies in the United States.|$|R
2500|$|In 1996, Chevrolet ceased {{making the}} Caprice. [...] The Ford Crown Victoria {{became the most}} widely used sedan for yellow cabs in New York. In addition, yellow <b>cab</b> <b>operators</b> also used the Honda Odyssey, Isuzu Oasis, Chevrolet Venture, Ford Freestar, and Toyota Sienna minivans, which offer {{increased}} passenger room. The distinctive Checker cabs were, due to their durable construction, phased out slowly. [...] The last one was retired in July 1999, after more than 20 years in service and with nearly one million miles on its odometer. Laws since 1996 require that taxis be replaced every six years regardless of condition; this was changed to 7 years in 2015.|$|R

50|$|The 1-50 series cars (numbered 1-50) were {{manufactured}} by the St. Louis Car Company of St. Louis, Missouri, and {{delivered to the}} CTA in 1959 and 1960. The cars were similar to the 6000 series design, but were double ended, single cars, {{as opposed to the}} 6000 series single ended, married pair configuration. The quarter point doors were adjacent to the <b>operators</b> <b>cabs,</b> allowing the <b>operator</b> to collect fares without leaving the cab. Like some members of the 6000 series, these cars utilized parts salvaged from Chicago's recently retired fleet of PCC streetcars.|$|R
40|$|Enclosed <b>operator</b> <b>cabs</b> {{are widely}} used on mobile {{excavation}} equipment in the mining and construction industries. They protect the operator from bad weather, noise, and airborne dusts. The inside cab environment usually must be kept at very low dust concentrations because of quartz dust generated from the excavation of silica-bearing rock. Most cab designs achieve {{heating and air conditioning}} effectiveness by recirculating most of the interior cabin airflow, with a smaller portion of the outside air added to the cab as makeup air. Both the recirculated cab airflow and exterior makeup air added to the cabin should be efficiently filtered, with the makeup air positively pressurizing the <b>cab</b> interior. Ideally, <b>operator</b> <b>cab</b> air filters should provide at least 99 % capture efficiency for dust particles as small as 0. 3 microm aerodynamic diameters. These higher efficiency air filters provide good dust control for the equipment operator, but tend to accumulate dust more quickly than lower efficiency air filters.

50|$|While a City Councilman, Montana saw {{the opening}} of the Buffalo airport (in Cheektowaga). He {{allegedly}} passed legislation regarding {{the opening of}} the Peace Bridge, Buffalo’s international gateway to Canada. He was instrumental in overseeing the two-year-long construction of the New York Central Station, which was “a 17 floor combination office and terminal building” on the East Side. He passed legislation to build the new City Hall building, still a landmark among Buffalo’s downtown skyline. Many major changes came to the Queen City during his time as a political leader, and John Montana made sure that his hidden partnerships never came to light while still placing people in positions to reap the benefits of the construction and transportation boom. Montana’s taxis, for instance, were given a sweetheart contract to be the sole <b>cab</b> <b>operators</b> at the new Central Terminal station; 200 trains a day were said to go through Buffalo, and Montana’s taxis were the only ones allowed to pick up passengers that wanted a ride - Buffalo police even ticketed and towed other cab companies that sought fares from the train station.|$|R

50|$|The Blue Line's Type I LRVs are {{numbered}} sequentially from 101 through 127. The Flexity Swift vehicle is an articulated design with three car-body sections, {{referred to as}} the A, B and C sections. The markings on the ends of LRVs indicate the vehicle number and section. For example, car 114 is marked 114A on one end and 114B on the other end. Vehicle numbers are also displayed (excluding the section letter) {{on the sides of the}} C section, on the doors of the <b>operator</b> <b>cabs</b> and on the roof of the vehicle. Both ends of the vehicle have <b>operator</b> <b>cabs,</b> allowing trains of any length to be operated normally in either direction without the need to turn the train around.

50|$|The A and B {{cars were}} built from 1968 to 1971 by Rohr Industries, an {{aerospace}} manufacturing {{company that had}} recently started mass-transit equipment manufacturing. The A cars were designed as leading or trailing cars only, with an aerodynamic fiberglass <b>operator's</b> <b>cab</b> housing train control equipment and BART's two-way communication system, and extending 5 ft longer than the B- and C-cars. A and B cars can seat 60 passengers comfortably, and under crush load, carry over 200 passengers. B cars have no <b>operator's</b> <b>cab</b> and {{are used in the}} middle of trains to carry passengers only. Currently, BART operates 59 A cars and 389 B cars. The BART A cars have a larger cab window than the C cars, allowing riders to look out of the front or the back of the train.|$|R

40|$|The {{results from}} the sound level measurements, the {{dosimeter}} recordings and the time-activity studies on four different air-rotary rigs indicate a wide variation of operator noise exposure during hole development. These variations appear {{to be dependent on}} the cab design and the operator 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 122 s drilling behavior. Studies have documented that exposure to high sound levels {{for long periods of time}} can cause hearing loss. The results of this study help identify the loudest parts of the drilling cycle. Sound level measurements on the four rigs show that all the rigs generate sound levels that are 90 A-weighted decibels (dB(A)) and above within 6 feet around the rigs during drilling. It is easy to conclude that some type of noise protection, such as a cab, is needed to protect the operator from overexposure to noise for an eight-hour shift of uninterrupted drilling. However, even when rigs are outfitted with <b>cabs,</b> <b>operators</b> observed in this study are being exposed to sound levels above 90 dB(A) during some activities required to complete a drilling cycle. An evaluation and comparison of the four dosimeter recordings and time-activity studies during one drilling cycle may explain why variations in operator exposure occur. Table 1 summarizes the time-weighted average (TWA) and accumulated dose percentages for each of the four operators during the time needed to complete one typical hole cycle...|$|R

40|$|Airborne {{respirable dust}} surveys were {{conducted}} at six surface coal mines {{to investigate the}} effectiveness of dust control methods used on rotary rock drills and bulldozers. Dust controls commonly used on drills include a dry dust collection system, exhausting from a shrouded area around the collared hole, and an enclosed drill <b>operator</b> <b>cab,</b> filtering airborne dust from the cab. Bulldozers are also typically equipped with an enclosed <b>operator</b> <b>cab</b> as a dust control measure. Airborne respirable dust sampling was conducted near each equipment's source of generation and inside its enclosed cab. Silica analysis {{was performed on the}} dust samples to determine the percent silica content in the dust generated at the six mining operations. An additional eight- month follow-up of dust sampling was also conducted in the enclosed <b>operator</b> <b>cabs</b> of several rock drills and bulldozers. Data were analyzed for long-term variability of accepted control methods to abate dust and silica levels. The highwall rock drill was the major and most variable dust source as compared to the bulldozer, generating dust levels, on average, one order of magnitude higher than dust levels of the bulldozer. Four of the six drills surveyed had dust containment and capture problems at the shrouded drill table above the lple. Repairs or modifications to three of the drill dust collection systems were shown to reduce dust levels by more that 50 % next to the shrouded drill table. The enclosed <b>operator</b> <b>cabs</b> provided more than 90 % and more than 40 % lower dust levels than at the dust source for the drill and bulldozer, respectively. Long-term sampling of several of these highwall drills and bulldozers showed that the dust levels in the drill cabs were frequently higher than 0. 2 mg/m 3 and more variable than in the bulldozers. The bulldozer dust levels were frequently below 0. 2 mg/m). Future research should focus on improving some of the deficiencies present in the drill's primary dust collection system, and developing quality control methods to ensure the integrity of enclosed cab protection for equipment operators...|$|R

50|$|The single-drum compactors 602, 1102, 1402 and 1802 were {{unique in}} {{that they had a}} full width <b>cab</b> where the <b>operator</b> could sit {{on either side of the}} machine to get a good view when working close to obstacles.

50|$|A {{double-ended}} tram has an <b>operator's</b> <b>cab</b> {{and controls}} {{at each end}} of the vehicle, which allows it to easily be driven at full speed in either direction on a continuous segment of track. Typically at the end of a run, the tram's operator will walk from one end of the tram to the other, and then commence the tram route in the other direction. The tram is usually switched to another track by use of crossover points or Y-points. Conversely, a single-ended vehicle needs a method of turning at terminani so that the <b>operator's</b> <b>cab</b> is in the front of the tram for the reverse journey. This usually necessitates a turning loop or triangle. On the other hand, the single cab and controls and fewer door spaces make the tram lighter, increases passenger accommodation (including many more seats) and effects reductions in equipment, weight, first-cost, maintenance cost, and operating expense.|$|R
