5|$|Miller's {{research}} was assisted {{by a set}} of Hubbard's personal papers obtained by Gerry Armstrong, a disaffected former employee of the <b>Church</b> <b>of</b> <b>Scientology.</b> Armstrong had been preparing material for an official biography of Hubbard, but left the Church in 1981 after finding that Hubbard's claims about his life conflicted with independent sources. The <b>Church</b> <b>of</b> <b>Scientology</b> obtained an injunction in California to prevent Armstrong from further distributing the documents. However, English courts refused to enforce this order.|$|E
5|$|At {{the federal}} level, Scientology lost a {{complaint}} against continued surveillance by the BfV in November 2004. The federal court based its opinion on its judgment that the aims of Scientology, as outlined by L. Ron Hubbard in his writings, were incompatible with the German constitution. Lawyers acting for the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution pointed out that Hubbard had written that civil rights, for example, should be restricted to Scientologists, and they asserted that the Scientology organization was taking systematic steps to infiltrate society and government institutions {{in order to prevent}} anti-Scientology legislation. Opposing counsel acting for the <b>Church</b> <b>of</b> <b>Scientology</b> had contended that Scientology was non-political, its aims were the liberation of the human being, and that Hubbard's instructions were valid only within the <b>Church</b> <b>of</b> <b>Scientology</b> and were subject to interpretation, and at any rate there was no effort to implement these instructions in Germany. The court disagreed and ruled that many sources, some of them not accessible to the general public, indicated that the aims of the <b>Church</b> <b>of</b> <b>Scientology</b> did include the abrogation of the principle of equality and other essential human rights.|$|E
5|$|By {{the start}} of the 1960s, Hubbard was the leader of a {{worldwide}} movement with thousands of followers. A decade later, however, he had left Saint Hill Manor and moved aboard his own private fleet of ships as the <b>Church</b> <b>of</b> <b>Scientology</b> faced worldwide controversy.|$|E

5|$|In 1998 Salon {{reported}} that Scientologists were now blocked from viewing sites critical of Scientology including Operation Clambake and alt.religion.scientology, {{through the use}} of a content-control software program referred to by critics as Scieno Sitter. The <b>Church</b> <b>of</b> <b>Scientology</b> was unable to shut down Operation Clambake's internet service provider in Norway. The organization succeeded in shutting down the upstream connection to the site's internet service provider, Netherlands-based Xtended Internet. In November 2002, Xtended Internet's upstream provider, Cignal Global Communications received a letter from <b>Church</b> <b>of</b> <b>Scientology</b> counsel alleging copyright and trademark infringement involved with Xenu.net. This letter led to Cignal Global Communications, a United States-based company, terminating its service with Xtended Internet, which had to move their company to a new backbone provider.|$|E

5|$|The German <b>Church</b> <b>of</b> <b>Scientology</b> has {{repeatedly}} challenged {{the legality of}} this surveillance in court.

The court ruled that the use of informants was disproportionate. In 2003, the same court ruled that it was illegal for the Berlin Office for the Protection of the Constitution to include the activities of Scientology in its report, given that the report did not document any activities that were opposed to the constitution.|$|E

5|$|According to the Sarasota Herald-Tribune, Hubbard was {{discovered}} when she performed {{one of her}} original pieces backstage, at an event sponsored by the organization, {{while working as a}} representative in the United States for the <b>Church</b> <b>of</b> <b>Scientology.</b> She was convinced to record a few tapes of her music in 1976.

5|$|After the article's publication, the <b>Church</b> <b>of</b> <b>Scientology</b> {{mounted a}} public {{relations}} campaign to address issues in the piece. It took out advertisements in USA Today for twelve weeks, and Church leader David Miscavige was interviewed by Ted Koppel on Nightline about what he {{considered to be an}} objective bias by the article's author. Miscavige alleged that the article was actually driven by the company Eli Lilly, because of Scientology's efforts against the drug Prozac. The <b>Church</b> <b>of</b> <b>Scientology</b> brought a libel suit against Time Warner and Behar, and sued Reader's Digest in multiple countries in Europe in an attempt to stop the article's publication there. The suit against Time Warner was dismissed in 1996, and the Church of Scientology's petition for a writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of the United States was denied in 2001.|$|E

5|$|Revelations from {{software}} {{produced by}} Virgil Griffith in 2007 called WikiScanner made public {{the nature of}} edits on Wikipedia which were able to be traced directly back to Church of Scientology-controlled computers. CBS News and The Independent reported that edits by the <b>Church</b> <b>of</b> <b>Scientology</b> were made in attempts to remove criticism from the main article on the topic. The Times and Forbes noted that Scientologist computers were used to remove links between the <b>Church</b> <b>of</b> <b>Scientology</b> and a former anti-cult organization, since taken over by Scientology, the Cult Awareness Network. Der Spiegel reported that Wikiscanner revealed Scientology computers were used to promote Scientology's critical view of psychiatry, including adding links to the Scientology-founded Citizens Commission on Human Rights (CCHR) and to websites of other groups affiliated with Scientology.|$|E
5|$|Scientology is {{represented}} by {{a large number of}} independent associations or Vereine in Germany; their umbrella organisation is the Scientology Kirche Deutschland e.V. Germany's domestic intelligence service, the Bundesamt für Verfassungsschutz (BfV, or Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution), estimates that there are 4,000 Scientologists in Germany, down from earlier estimates of 5,000 to 6,000. The <b>Church</b> <b>of</b> <b>Scientology</b> reported around 30,000 members from the mid-1990s onwards; this number remained stable for many years. However more recently Scientology has said it has only 12,000 members. Discrepancies in Scientology membership numbers arise because the <b>Church</b> <b>of</b> <b>Scientology</b> applies more inclusive criteria in establishing its figures, essentially including anyone who has purchased a book or participated in courses, regardless of their subsequent involvement. The number of contractually bound Scientology staff members working in German Scientology organizations is unlikely to exceed a few hundred.|$|E
5|$|The {{project has}} been {{supported}} by some public officials, and received some public funding, but received criticism for its financial ties to the <b>Church</b> <b>of</b> <b>Scientology,</b> for exposing rescue workers to potential medical dangers, and for discouraging their use of orthodox medicine.

5|$|Anonymous {{first became}} {{associated}} with hacktivism in 2008 following {{a series of}} actions against the <b>Church</b> <b>of</b> <b>Scientology</b> known as Project Chanology.

500|$|The {{project was}} {{publicly}} {{launched in the}} form of a video posted to YouTube, [...] "Message to Scientology", on January 21, 2008.

This was followed by distributed denial-of-service attacks (DDoS), and soon after, black faxes, prank calls, and other measures intended to disrupt the <b>Church</b> <b>of</b> <b>Scientology's</b> operations. In February 2008, the focus of the protest shifted to legal methods, including nonviolent protests and an attempt to get the Internal Revenue Service to investigate the <b>Church</b> <b>of</b> <b>Scientology's</b> tax exempt status in the United States.|$|R
