5000|$|In Japan, a major {{breakthrough}} came when their second single of 1990, the jazz-influenced [...] "Young, Alive, In Love" [...] was featured as the main theme song to the popular drama Youbikou Bugi (Cram-school Boogie). Aside from the extra exposure the decision to sing in Japanese marked a turning-point for the duo. All subsequent Flipper's Guitar songs were written in Japanese with occasional choruses adopting English. Due to the sudden uplift in popularity the group's second album <b>Camera</b> <b>Talk</b> (カメラ・トク) was released in June 1990 to much greater anticipation and sales. The album produced by 'Double Knockout Corporation' and Zin Yoshida. The album shows the group widening its guitar-orientated sound to take-in bossa nova/Latin, vocal jazz, house music, and spy thriller instrumentals. The influence of new wave British guitar-pop was present in equal measure and if anything more apparent than on the debut. Songs titled after the British acts Haircut 100 and The Colourfield made the connection overt. Flipper's Guitar followed <b>Camera</b> <b>Talk</b> with their first national tour. The duo kept busy in the studio releasing the extended-play Camera! Camera! Camera! in September and the non-album single [...] "Love Train" [...] b/w [...] "Slide" [...] in November. The title-track of Camera! Camera! Camera! is an alternate 'guitar pop' recording with members of Ruts DC of the <b>Camera</b> <b>Talk</b> album track.|$|E
50|$|That {{summer the}} group {{released}} Doctor Head's World Tower (ヘッド博士の世界塔). The album title is {{a reference to}} The Monkees's 1968 movie Head. Samples of dialogue from Head appear throughout. Stylistically the album was another leap-forward for the group that showcased an increased use of sampling and the obvious influence of groups like Primal Scream and the Happy Mondays giving the album a tripped-out dance groove. Gone were short acoustic pop songs of the debut and the bossa nova/Latin, vocal jazz leanings of <b>Camera</b> <b>Talk.</b> In there place were songs of much greater length, three of which were over six-minutes long.|$|E
5000|$|... 1990 {{was a major}} {{year for}} the group. The group, now a duo, {{released}} several singles and their landmark second album. The first small coup for the duo came when their first single of the year [...] "Friends Again" [...] was featured in the film Octopus Army ~ Shibuya de aitai! This gave the group a lot of exposure to audiences outside of the small alternative scene. The single was also their first material produced by Oyamada and Ozawa themselves under the name Double Knockout Corporation. KO being Oyamada and Ozawa's initials. The single also {{marked the beginning of}} their contact with the European music scene. The group filmed the music video for [...] "Friends Again" [...] in France. Flipper's Guitar's second album <b>Camera</b> <b>Talk,</b> released later that year, credits French and English recording studios as well as British musicians from Ruts DC on several tracks.|$|E

30|$|I {{have noticed}} myself that even my own video {{can provide a}} useful {{stimulus}} to future thinking, rather like a reflection in a journal.

When I finally decided to face the <b>camera</b> to <b>talk</b> to my students, they reassured me that I didn’t come across as monologic, but was “real” and “human”.|$|R

The {{premise of the}} joke, {{aside from the fact}} that she is not Japanese, is that Noriko does not speak English very well. The celebrity usually cannot understand her and her questions. At the end of the interview, after giving a photograph of herself face down, saying that it is Noriko, Mäenpää removes her wig, glasses and false teeth.|$|R
50|$|Jan Levinson-Gould, as Vice President of Dunder-Mifflin, has {{a no-nonsense}} {{management}} style {{that is at}} odds with Michael's more casual approach. Since her office is in New York, Jan's contact with the Scranton branch is largely by telephone, although she will make the two-and-a-half-hour drive to Scranton if necessary. She usually asks if she's on <b>camera</b> when <b>talking</b> to Michael on the speaker phone, and Michael often lies and tells her she is not, before admitting that they are—at which point she hangs up on him. While initially based on Jennifer Taylor-Clarke from the UK version, her character develops in a different direction.|$|R
