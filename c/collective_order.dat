60|$|Between the {{phenomena}}, then, which {{exist at}} any instant, and the phenomena which exist at the succeeding instant, {{there is an}} invariable order of succession; and, as we said in speaking of the general uniformity of the course of nature, this web is composed of separate fibres; this <b>collective</b> <b>order</b> {{is made up of}} particular sequences, obtaining invariably among the separate parts. To certain facts, certain facts always do, and, as we believe, will continue to, succeed. The invariable antecedent is termed the cause; the invariable consequent, the effect. And the universality of the law of causation consists in this, that every consequent is connected in this manner with some particular antecedent, or set of antecedents. Let the fact be what it may, if it has begun to exist, it was preceded by some fact or facts, with which it is invariably connected. For every event there exists some combination of objects or events, some given concurrence of circumstances, positive and negative, the occurrence of which is always followed by that phenomenon. We may not have found out what this concurrence of circumstances may be; but we never doubt {{that there is such a}} one, and that it never occurs without having the phenomenon in question as its effect or consequence. On the universality of this truth depends the possibility of reducing the inductive process to rules. The undoubted assurance we have that there is a law to be found if we only knew how to find it, will be seen presently to be the source from which the canons of the Inductive Logic derive their validity.|$|E

To facilitate {{decision making}} in this type of situations, this paper proposes a belief structure to represent the partially ordered preferences with belief degrees, which can cover both qualitative and quantitative aspects of the evaluation and can also represent indifference and incomparability relations as well. An evidential reasoning based preference combination approach is then applied to combine the partially ordered preferences with belief degrees of the experts. The <b>collective</b> <b>ordering</b> of alternatives, which again could be a partial order, is generated based on a distance measure between pairs of preference relations. A group decision making model based on the preference combination and the <b>collective</b> <b>ordering</b> generation is then established for partially ordered preference under uncertainty.

40|$|A {{well-known}} {{fact about}} positional election procedures {{is that its}} ranking of m alternatives can change {{when some of the}} alternatives are removed from consideration—given a positional procedure on each of 2, 3, …, m alternatives and a <b>collective</b> preference <b>order</b> for each distinct subset of the m alternatives. Saari has established that with few exceptions, we can find a voter profile for which the <b>collective</b> preference <b>order</b> for each subset under the according positional procedure is the one given. However, Saari 2 ̆ 7 s results do not quantify the likelihood of finding such voter profiles. For small numbers of alternatives, William Gehrlein developed a statistical model to explore the probabilities that particular <b>collective</b> preference <b>orders</b> on subsets of alternatives can occur for large electorates. One goal of this research is to determine whether changes in the <b>collective</b> preference <b>order</b> as alternatives are removed can be considered to be the norm or an outlier for positional procedures. This dissertation extends the research headed by Gehrlein in two directions. One, I generalize his statistical model to explore probabilities for iterated election procedures. Gehrlein 2 ̆ 7 s model previously produced results only for three alternatives and in limited cases for four alternatives. I have extended this model to produce results for up to five alternatives, including analysis of instant-runoff voting and runoff elections. Two, Gehrlein 2 ̆ 7 s model required specific conditions on the probability distribution of individual voter preferences across the population. I relax this assumption so that for any probability distribution of individual voter preferences across the population, I can explore the probability that a <b>collective</b> preference <b>order</b> is inconsistent with the outcomes when alternatives are removed. These results provide a foundation for discussing the impact of removing alternatives on elections across all large electorates. I also apply these results to two recent United States elections wherein a third-party candidate received a significant share of the votes: the 1992 U. S. Presidential election and the 1998 Minnesota Gubernatorial election. Overall, my research will suggest that as the number of alternatives increases, the likelihood of finding changes in the <b>collective</b> preference <b>order</b> as alternatives are removed will approach one...|$|R
5000|$|People {{regularly}} use {{the terms}} [...] "self-organization" [...] and [...] "self-assembly" [...] interchangeably. As complex system science becomes more popular though, {{there is a}} higher need to clearly distinguish {{the differences between the}} two mechanisms to understand their significance in physical and biological systems. Both processes explain how <b>collective</b> <b>order</b> develops from [...] "dynamic small-scale interactions", according to an article in a November/December 2008 issue of the journal Complexity. Self-organization is a non-equilibrium process where self-assembly is a spontaneous process that leads toward equilibrium. Self-assembly requires components to remain essentially unchanged throughout the process. Besides the thermodynamic difference between the two, there is also a difference in formation. The first difference is what [...] "encodes the global order of the whole" [...] in self-assembly whereas in self-organization these initial encodings are not necessary. Another slight contrast refers to the minimum number of units needed to make an order. Self-organization appears to have a minimum number of units whereas self-assembly does not. The concepts may have particular application in connection with natural selection.Eventually, these patterns may form one theory of pattern formation in nature.|$|E
