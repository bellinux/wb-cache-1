5|$|Although the {{components}} of the <b>cytosol</b> are not separated into regions by cell membranes, these components do not always mix randomly and several levels of organization can localize specific molecules to defined sites within the <b>cytosol.</b>|$|E
5|$|In the {{eukaryotic}} cell, the <b>cytosol</b> {{is within}} the cell membrane and {{is part of the}} cytoplasm, which also comprises the mitochondria, plastids, and other organelles (but not their internal fluids and structures); the cell nucleus is separate. The <b>cytosol</b> is thus a liquid matrix around the organelles. In prokaryotes, most of the chemical reactions of metabolism take place in the <b>cytosol,</b> while a few take place in membranes or in the periplasmic space. In eukaryotes, while many metabolic pathways still occur in the <b>cytosol,</b> others are contained within organelles.|$|E
5|$|The <b>cytosol</b> is {{a complex}} mixture of {{substances}} dissolved in water. Although water forms {{the large majority of}} the <b>cytosol,</b> its structure and properties within cells is not well understood. The concentrations of ions such as sodium and potassium are different in the <b>cytosol</b> than in the extracellular fluid; these differences in ion levels are important in processes such as osmoregulation, cell signaling, and the generation of action potentials in excitable cells such as endocrine, nerve and muscle cells. The <b>cytosol</b> also contains large amounts of macromolecules, which can alter how molecules behave, through macromolecular crowding.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} whether the cytosolic enzyme alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) activates methyla-zoxymethanol (MAM) in the mouse colon and whether differ-ential tumor susceptibility in the mouse is dependent, in part, on strain-related differences in MAM metabolism by ADH. Liver and colon <b>cytosols</b> were isolated from 7 -week-old male tumor-susceptible (SWR/J) and-resistant (AKR/J) mice. Min-imal reduction of NAD+ was found in colon <b>cytosols</b> from AKR/J mice at the highest concentration (2 mM) of MAM tested. In liver <b>cytosols,</b> only SWR was capable of sustaining NAD+ reduction with MAM, although at very low levels.

5|$|Although it {{was once}} thought to be a simple {{solution}} of molecules, the <b>cytosol</b> has multiple levels of organization. These include concentration gradients of small molecules such as calcium, large complexes of enzymes that act together to carry out metabolic pathways, and protein complexes such as proteasomes and carboxysomes that enclose and separate parts of the <b>cytosol.</b>|$|E
5|$|Cells {{can deal}} with even larger osmotic changes by accumulating osmoprotectants such as betaines or {{trehalose}} in their <b>cytosol.</b> Some of these molecules can allow cells to survive being completely dried out and allow an organism to enter a state of suspended animation called cryptobiosis. In this state the <b>cytosol</b> and osmoprotectants become a glass-like solid that helps stabilize proteins and cell membranes from the damaging effects of desiccation.|$|E
5|$|In prokaryotes the <b>cytosol</b> {{contains}} the cell's genome, within a structure {{known as a}} nucleoid. This is an irregular mass of DNA and associated proteins that control the transcription and replication of the bacterial chromosome and plasmids. In eukaryotes the genome is held within the cell nucleus, which is separated from the <b>cytosol</b> by nuclear pores that block the free diffusion of any molecule larger than about 10nanometres in diameter.|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} {{the effects of}} ginsenosides (GSS) extracted from ginseng stem and leaves on glucocorticoid receptor (GR) in different viscera in heat-damaged rats, {{and to find out}} its action mechanism. Methods: Thirty-two male SD rats were divided into control group and experimental group, and fed 2 mg/d GSS and equal-quantity of distilled water respectively for 7 days. Eight rats of each group were exposed to (42 ± 1) ℃ for one hour. The binding activities of GR in brain, thymus, lung and liver <b>cytosols</b> in rats were detected by radioligand binding assay. The expression levels of GR mRNA in brain and liver <b>cytosols</b> were determined by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay. Plasma adrenocorticotropin (ACTH) and corticosterone (CS) concentrations were determined by radioimmunoassay. Results: The binding activities of GR in brain, lung and liver <b>cytosols,</b> and the expression levels of GR mRNA in brain and liver <b>cytosols</b> were all higher in the GSS-treated and heat-damaged rats than those in the untreated heat-damaged rats (P＜ 0. 05 or P＜ 0. 01). There {{were no significant differences in}} plasma concentrations of ACTH and CS between the GSS-treated heat-damaged rats and the untreated heat-damaged rats. Conclusion: GSS can lessen the descending degree of the binding activity of GR in brain, thymus, lung and liver <b>cytosols,</b> and such efficacy of GSS may be related to improvment of the expression of GR mRNA...|$|R

GST B 1, B 2 and Pi was detected in all 58 breast tumour <b>cytosols</b> whilst GST Mu {{was found in}} only 28. Of the GSTs, Pi was expressed most strongly in all <b>cytosols</b> and the concentration was significantly higher in ER-poor tumour <b>cytosols</b> than in ER-rich tumours (P less than 0. 01). As with GST Pi, {{the highest levels of}} GST B 1 and GST B 2 were found in ER-poor tumour cytosols; the levels of GST B 1 and GST B 2 were positively correlated (r = 0. 66, P less than 0. 001). No quantitative or qualitative association was found between ER status and GST Mu which was expressed in 46 % of ER-rich and 50 % of ER-poor tumour <b>cytosols.</b> No relationship could be found between GST expression and age, menopausal status, lymph node involvement or tumour T stage in the subgroup of patients in whom this information was available. These data suggest that a common mechanism is responsible for GST induction in ER-poor tumours and that the nulled Mu phenotype has no increased susceptibility to developing breast cancer...|$|R
40|$|Spinach and radish {{grown from}} seeds were each {{contaminated}} with 4 different amounts of cadmium. After a cell {{breakdown of the}} eatable parts and centrifugation of the resulting homogenates all supernatants (<b>cytosols)</b> were separated by gel permeation chromatography (GPC). The size-range of the GPC method used was about 20 - 8000 kDa for globular proteins. The high molecular weight (HMW-Cd-SP, 150 - 700 kDa) and the low molecular weight Cd species (LMW-Cd-SP, < 150 kDa) in all plant <b>cytosols</b> eluted {{at about the same}} retention volume by GPC. The most important Cd binding form in the <b>cytosols</b> of all plants was found to be HMW-Cd-SP. The Cd elution maxima were detected in the range of about 200 kDa. The Cd determinations were performed with ET-AAS by means of matrix modifier. By incubating chosen <b>cytosols</b> with a proteinase before the GPC it was verified that the HMW-Cd-SP in both vegetables are Cd proteins. The molar proportions protein/Cd were about 2 - 6 in the respective GPC fractions of the HMW-Cd-SP of the highest contaminated plants. The GPC fractions of the HMW-Cd-SP of spinach and radish were further separated by a preparative, native and continuous polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) method. At pH 8 the species were negatively charged, had only a small UV-absorption at 280 nm and showed a very similar elution behavior in all analyzed <b>cytosols.</b> Therefore, we suppose that the HMW-Cd-SP of these two different vegetable foodstuffs have a very similar chemical structure...|$|R
5|$|Muscle {{cells have}} another {{specialized}} function of smooth ER. The ER membrane pumps calcium ions from the <b>cytosol</b> into the cisternal space. When a muscle cell becomes stimulated by a nerve impulse, calcium goes {{back across the}} ER membrane into the <b>cytosol</b> and generates the contraction of the muscle cell.|$|E
5|$|The {{concentrations}} {{of the other}} ions in <b>cytosol</b> are quite different from those in extracellular fluid and the <b>cytosol</b> also contains much higher amounts of charged macromolecules such as proteins and nucleic acids than {{the outside of the}} cell structure.|$|E
5|$|The <b>cytosol</b> has {{no single}} {{function}} and is instead {{the site of}} multiple cell processes. Examples of these processes include signal transduction from the cell membrane to sites within the cell, such as the cell nucleus, or organelles. This compartment is also the site {{of many of the}} processes of cytokinesis, after the breakdown of the nuclear membrane in mitosis. Another major function of <b>cytosol</b> is to transport metabolites from their site of production to where they are used. This is relatively simple for water-soluble molecules, such as amino acids, which can diffuse rapidly through the <b>cytosol.</b> However, hydrophobic molecules, such as fatty acids or sterols, can be transported through the <b>cytosol</b> by specific binding proteins, which shuttle these molecules between cell membranes. Molecules taken into the cell by endocytosis or on their way to be secreted can also be transported through the <b>cytosol</b> inside vesicles, which are small spheres of lipids that are moved along the cytoskeleton by motor proteins.|$|E

40|$|Summary: We {{describe}} two {{modifications of}} a double-isotope assay {{for measuring the}} concentrations of oestrogen receptors and progesterone receptors in tumour <b>cytosols</b> and extracts of frozen tumour sections and endometrial sections. The concentrations of these receptors are derived from single-point/isoelectric focussing assays after incubation of <b>cytosols</b> or section supernatants either with ([125 I]vinyl) -nortestosterone and [3 H]oestradiol or [125 I]oestradiol and [3 H]ORG 2058 (16 a-ethyl- 21 -hydroxy- 19 -nor[6, 73 H]pregn- 4 -ene- 3, 20 -dione). The concentrations of the oestrogen and progesterone receptors found in <b>cytosols</b> (r> 0. 93) and extracts from sections (r> 0. 8) by dual label assays are highly correlated with those found by single label assays. The method described represents an approach to the determination of oestrogen and progesterone receptors biochemically in an amount of tissue which is comparable to that needed for immunocytochemical procedures...|$|R

Clinically significant cut-off values (30 fmol/mg protein for ER; 27 fmol/ mg protein for PgR), as related to tumor recurrence (median follow-up, 47 months), have been established by isotonic regression analysis.

5|$|The low {{concentration}} of calcium in the <b>cytosol</b> allows calcium ions {{to function as}} a second messenger in calcium signaling. Here, a signal such as a hormone or an action potential opens calcium channels so that calcium floods into the <b>cytosol.</b> This sudden increase in cytosolic calcium activates other signalling molecules, such as calmodulin and protein kinase C. Other ions such as chloride and potassium may also have signaling functions in the <b>cytosol,</b> but these are not well understood.|$|E
5|$|Lysosomes {{carry out}} {{intracellular}} digestion, {{in a process}} called phagocytosis (from the Greek phagein, to eat and kytos, vessel, referring here to the cell), by fusing with a vacuole and releasing their enzymes into the vacuole. Through this process, sugars, amino acids, and other monomers pass into the <b>cytosol</b> and become nutrients for the cell. Lysosomes also use their hydrolytic enzymes to recycle the cell's obsolete organelles in a process called autophagy. The lysosome engulfs another organelle and uses its enzymes to take apart the ingested material. The resulting organic monomers are {{then returned to the}} <b>cytosol</b> for reuse.

Moreover, the uPAR levels in {{the two types of}} extracts were weakly, though significantly, correlated with each other (rS= 0. 20, P< 0. 001). In Cox univariate analysis, high cytosolic levels of uPAR were significantly associated with reduced overall survival (OS) and relapse-free survival (RFS). The levels of uPAR in pellet extracts appeared not to be related with patient survival. In multivariate analysis, elevated levels of uPAR measured in <b>cytosols</b> and pellet extracts were found to be independent predictors of poor OS, not RFS.

On the other hand, a stability of Cu absorbance throughout the graphite tube lifetime (up to 250 firings) was obtained with platform atomization. Signal stability, together with excellent measurement repeatability ( 5 %) and acceptable Cu recovery from spiked samples (77 - 89 %), make ETAAS with platform atomization applicable to the determination of low Cu concentrations (< 27  g L- 1) in environmental samples with complex organic matrices, such as undigested fish tissue <b>cytosols,</b> even without the use of chemical modifiers...|$|R

40|$|Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) is the ester prodrug of the immuno-suppressant agent {{mycophenolic acid}} (MPA) and is rapidly acti-vated by esterases after oral administration. However, {{the role of}} {{isoenzymes}} in MMF hydrolysis remains unclear. Although human plasma, erythrocytes, and whole blood contain MMF hydrolytic activities, the mean half-lives of MMF in vitro were 15. 1, 1. 58, and 3. 20 h, respectively. Thus, blood esterases seemed to contribute little to the rapid MMF disappearance in vivo. In vitro analyses showed that human intestinal microsomes exposed to 5 and 10 M MMF exhibited hydrolytic activities of 2. 38 and 4. 62 nmol/(min mg protein), respectively. Human liver microsomes exhibited hydro-lytic activities of 14. 0 and 26. 1 nmol/(min mg protein), respec-tively, approximately 6 -fold higher than those observed for intes-tinal microsomes. MMF hydrolytic activities in human liver <b>cytosols</b> were 1. 40 and 3. 04 nmol/(min mg protein), respectively. Because hepatic <b>cytosols</b> generally contain 5 -fold more protein than micro-somes, MMF hydrolysis in human liver <b>cytosols</b> corresponded to approximately 50 % of that observed in microsomes. Fractions obtained by 9000 g centrifugation of supernatants from COS- 1 cells expressing human carboxylesterase (CES) 1 or 2 exhibited MMF hydrolytic activity, with CES 1 -containing fractions showing higher catalytic efficiency than CES 2 -containing fractions. The CES inhib-itor bis-p-nitrophenylphosphate inhibited MMF hydrolysis in hu-man liver microsomes and <b>cytosols</b> with IC 50 values of 0. 51 and 0. 36 M, respectively. In conclusion, both intestinal and hepatic CESs and in particular CES 1 {{may be involved in}} MMF hydrolysis and play important roles in MMF bioactivation.
