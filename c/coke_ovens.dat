25|$|Beginning in the 1910s, {{important}} {{technological and}} industrial changes spelled {{the end of}} the Pittsburgh seam's importance. By-product <b>coke</b> <b>ovens,</b> which yielded more coke per ton from coal, replaced most beehive <b>coke</b> <b>ovens</b> from 1910 to 1940. By-product ovens utilized coal that was lower quality than Pittsburgh-seam coal, greatly reducing demand for Pittsburgh-seam coal. The Great Depression also contributed significantly to the decline of production. Pittsburgh-seam output continued to fall after a World War II surge as steel mills adopted alternative fuels such as natural gas and oil and improved the energy efficiency of iron furnaces. Another major blow came during the late 1970s and 1980s as the American steel industry closed many steel mills in the Pittsburgh region and elsewhere. The decline of Pittsburgh-seam mining brought large-scale social and economic changes to southwestern Pennsylvania, as unemployment climbed, the region lost population due to out-migration, businesses dependent on coal miners' income folded, and municipalities had declining tax bases.|$|E

METHODS Ninety-six <b>coke</b> <b>oven</b> workers {{participated in the}} study. Nonexposed workers (n = 105) were randomly sampled among power plant workers in the same age range. The examination included a questionnaire on health status, occupational history, smoking, and dietary habits. Blood samples completed the examination. <b>Coke</b> <b>oven</b> workers were classified into low-, middle-, and high-exposure groups based on the benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P) air concentrations and were further classified into the categories "topside" and "non-topside," according to their proximity to the ovens. RESULTS: Erythrocyte glutathiane peroxidase activity increased with age (r = 0. 18, P = 0. 061) in power plant workers, whereas plasma glutathione peroxidase activity decreased with age (r = - 0. 18, P = 0. 068) and erythrocyte glutathione peroxidase activity was inversely correlated {{with the number of}} cigarettes per day (r = - 0. 28, P = 0. 08) in <b>coke</b> <b>oven</b> workers. Comparison of blood antioxidant enzyme activities and total plasma antioxidant concentration between <b>coke</b> <b>oven</b> and power plant workers showed that erythrocyte glutathione peroxidase activity was significantly lower in <b>coke</b> <b>oven</b> workers, even after adjustment for potential confounding factors. No differences were found either in other blood antioxidant enzyme activities or in total plasma antioxidant concentration between <b>coke</b> <b>oven</b> and power plant workers. Moreover; no trends toward decreased glutathione peroxidase activity among the three subgroups of B[a]P exposure were observed, and no differences either in blood antioxidant enzyme activities or in total plasma antioxidant concentration between the two groups of job categories were found.

40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] The aim was {{to assess}} the {{significance}} of two biomarkers; antibody to benzo(a) pyrene DNA adducts and concentration of hydroxyethylvaline haemoglobin adducts in samples from a well studied group of <b>coke</b> <b>oven</b> workers. As a measure of exposure we have used 1 -hydroxypyrene in urine. METHODS [...] Urine and blood samples were collected from <b>coke</b> <b>oven</b> workers and a control group. Samples from <b>coke</b> <b>oven</b> plant workers were collected in January and June. 1 -Hydroxypyrene was measured in urine by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), antibodies to benzo(a) pyrene DNA adducts were measured by ELISA and hydroxyethylvaline haemoglobin adducts were measured by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). RESULTS [...] Mean urinary 1 -hydroxypyrene in samples from <b>coke</b> <b>oven</b> workers varied from 1. 11 to 5. 53 umol/mol creatinine and 0. 14 umol/mol creatinine in the control group. Workers at the top side had the highest values of urinary 1 -hydroxypyrene. Antibody to benzo(a) pyrene DNA adducts did not correlate with either 1 -hydroxypyrene nor length of work at the <b>coke</b> <b>oven</b> plant. But antibody concentration in samples collected in January was predictive of the concentration in samples collected in June. A small non-significant increase in hydroxyethylvaline haemoglobin adducts was found in samples from <b>coke</b> <b>oven</b> workers relative to the control group when comparing smokers and nonsmokers separately. CONCLUSION [...] 1 -Hydroxypyrene correlates well with exposure groups based on job description. Antibodies to benzo(a) -pyrene DNA adducts was related to people and not exposure. Work at a <b>coke</b> <b>oven</b> plant might lead to increased hydroxyethylvaline haemoglobin adducts...|$|R

25|$|In 1868, Andrew Carnegie saw an {{opportunity}} to integrate new coke-making methods with the recently developed Kelly-Bessemer process to supply steel for railroads. In 1872, he built a steel plant in Braddock, Pennsylvania at the junction of several major railroad lines. Carnegie earned enormous profits by pioneering vertical integration; he owned the iron ore mines in Minnesota, the transport steamboats on the Great Lakes, the coal mines and <b>coke</b> <b>ovens,</b> and the rail lines delivering the coke and ore to his Pennsylvania mills. By 1900, the Carnegie Steel Company was producing more steel than all of Britain and in 1901 Carnegie sold his business to J.P. Morgan's U.S. Steel earning Carnegie $480 million personally.|$|E
25|$|Andrew Carnegie {{decided to}} stop relying solely on his company's own {{furnaces}} for coke, and began seeking to buy the fuel on the open market. Thomas and Henry Phipps had alerted Andrew {{to the need for}} a greater and steadier supply for coke for the growing steel works. In 1881, Andrew sent Thomas to meet with Henry Clay Frick, owner of H.C. Frick & Co.—the largest coke producing company in the U.S. Thomas' goal was to induce Frick to buy the Carnegie <b>coke</b> <b>ovens.</b> In November 1881, Thomas proposed selling the Monastery Coke Works near Latrobe, Pennsylvania, to Frick, or at least have Frick take over the marketing and selling of the coke produced there. Thomas' offer came as Frick was planning his wedding, and it fell to Andrew to meet with Frick and his new bride as they honeymooned in New York City. By this time, Thomas had negotiated most of an agreement with Frick, as well as planned the meeting with Andrew. Carnegie took a 10 percent interest in H.C. Frick & Co., Frick took a 50 percent interest in the Monastery coke works, and H.C. Frick & Co. would become the exclusive supplier of coke to Carnegie Bros. & Co. and the Edgar Thomson Steel Works. Thomas was assigned to negotiate the price of coke on an annual basis with Frick, and {{over the next two years}} H.C. Frick & Co. made a 23 percent profit on the coke sold. By 1885, Andrew Carnegie had purchased enough stock in H.C. Frick & Co. to own 50 percent of the company. Frick now attempted to buy into the Carnegie steel companies by selling 12 of the remaining 16 percent of the H.C. Frick which he still owned, but Thomas warned him not to try and to instead seek a position as a manager within the company.|$|E

500|$|Canny {{investments}} and {{the purchase of}} major competitors in 1888 and 1892 {{under the direction of}} financier Hiram Bond, TCI Corporate General Superintendent, saw the firm grow rapidly. The corporation was for several decades one of the few major heavy industries based in the largely agricultural Southern United States, by a wide margin the largest blast furnace operator in the South and at one time the second largest steel producer on the continent. Its 1900 asset sheet listed 17 blast furnaces, 3256 beehive <b>coke</b> <b>ovens,</b> 120 Solvay <b>coke</b> <b>ovens,</b> 15 red ore mines, as well an extensive network of railroads, although following the panic of 1893 the company shifted its primary interests from railroads to steel. TCI's largest industrial plant was located in Ensley, a company town founded in 1886 on the outskirts of Birmingham, Alabama, by company president Enoch Ensley. Ensley (...) was served by the sizable Birmingham Southern Railroad, one of TCI's early acquisitions, and from 1899 contained four 200-ton blast furnaces. In 1906 two more furnaces were constructed, and 40,000 tonnes of steel were produced that year, feeding Ensley's integrated rail, wire and plate mills. The company was fiercely competitive with the larger Pittsburgh steel businesses to the north, owing to the remarkable fact that all the natural resources required to produce steel were located in abundance within a relatively small radius of the Birmingham mills.|$|E

40|$|Studies on non-fatal health {{indicators}} represent positive developments for occupational disease prevention. The indicators include disease incidence, symptoms, and impaired physiological function. While cancer mortality of <b>coke</b> <b>oven</b> workers {{has been extensively}} investigated, respiratory health of <b>coke</b> <b>oven</b> workers is a poorly investigated area. Very few studies have ever been reported. Almost {{all of these are}} cross-sectional. This study utilised data extracted from a lung function surveillance system on <b>coke</b> <b>oven</b> workers in a steelworks to investigate the association between respiratory health and exposure to <b>coke</b> <b>oven</b> emissions, particularly the exposure effects on lung function and respiratory symptoms. <b>Coke</b> <b>oven</b> emissions are volatile materials escaping from the coke producing process. The emissions contain various complex chemical compounds, some of which are suspected to have hazardous health effects. The major pollution sources of <b>coke</b> <b>oven</b> emissions are emission and leakage during the coke producing process. Chemical components of <b>coke</b> <b>oven</b> emissions are absorbed mainly through respiratory and dermal routes. A few cross-sectional studies have reported that decreased lung function indices such as FEV 1 and of FEV 1 /FVC were associated with exposure to <b>coke</b> <b>oven</b> emissions. <b>Coke</b> <b>oven</b> workers were also reported to have higher prevalence of bronchitis symptoms such as cough and phlegm. Longitudinal data from a lung function surveillance system on <b>coke</b> <b>oven</b> workers in a steelworks were available for the period from 1978 to 2000. Some modifications were made to the surveillance system in 1990. There were 1851 individuals with valid data during the surveillance period, and they constituted the study population. Repeated lung function test results, respiratory symptom information, and smoking information were extracted from the surveillance database. Detailed occupational exposure histories were traced back from the payment system and human resource department in the steelworks. Four exposure groups (‘Operation’, ‘Maintenance’, ‘Electricity’ and ‘Other’) based on the perceived exposure levels were used to classify the subjects according to their detailed occupational exposure histories. The association between lung function and exposure to <b>coke</b> <b>oven</b> emissions was investigated cross-sectionally and longitudinally. While a longitudinal analysis provides direct assessment of effects on individuals, a cross-sectional analysis is also important since not all subjects in the surveillance system had longitudinal data. Cross-sectional analyses on the pooled last (or only) sets of lung function tests were conducted by using multiple regression. Longitudinal analyses on the time trends of lung function change over time were conducted by using a two-stage analysis technique and mixed model. Logistic regression was used {{to assess the impact of}} risk factors on respiratory symptoms. The 1990 modifications made it necessary to produce separate analyses on the pre- and post-modification data to fully utilise the information. The surveillance data set provides a valuable resource for assessing cross-sectional and longitudinal effects of exposure on lung function. Particular strengths of the data are the relatively large sample size, long follow-up time (average around 8 years), and no evidence of recruitment associated selection bias between exposure groups. A cross-sectional study was conducted on the data collected before the 1990 modifications. The last (or only) sets of lung function tests for 1353 male <b>coke</b> <b>oven</b> workers were pooled for the analyses.
