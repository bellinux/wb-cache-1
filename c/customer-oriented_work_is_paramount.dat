30|$|It is {{possible}} that the M-distance limit of 3 is unrealistic for this series of experiments. In the on-site trial reported here, M-distance values were well above 3. In some discrimination methods, M-distance limits of 10 – 15 for maximum variance have been reported for classifying samples but threshold values vary according to the type of sample and application [44]. Raising the M-distance limit should therefore be done with some caution. This research therefore demonstrates the complexity of translating a model developed in the laboratory to a real heritage setting.

40|$|Orientation: Worldwide {{transformation}} {{and change in}} education has placed increased demands on teachers, which has resulted in teachers experiencing a potentially negative work attitude. Research purpose: The aim {{of this article was}} to expand the understanding of the relationship between a sense of calling, work attitude and meaningful work. Motivation for the study: The international community has rated the quality of education in South Africa as being substandard. Therefore, work attitudes and the impact of meaningful work in the current educational system was investigated. Research approach, design and method: A quantitative, cross-sectional survey was used with a representative sample of teachers in South Africa (N = 270). Data were gathered by means of questionnaires and analysed through structural equation modelling. Main findings: A significant positive relationship was found between a sense of calling and work attitude. Meaningful <b>work</b> <b>was</b> found to mediate the relationship between a sense of calling and positive work attitude. Practical/managerial implications: Retention of teachers displaying a positive work attitude as well as those finding meaning in their <b>work</b> <b>is</b> <b>paramount.</b> Communication pertaining to the broader mission and common goals of the Department of Education should transpire. Support and training should be provided and teachers should be allowed autonomy in a school atmosphere that is pleasant and disciplined.

40|$|Abstract. The {{scope of}} this paper is to explore the input {{parameters}} of a Finite Element (FE) model of an active lower limb that are most influential in determining the size and the shape of the performance envelope of the kinematics and peak contact pressure of the knee tibial insert introduced during a Total Knee Replacement (TKR) surgery. The active lower limb FE model simulates the stair ascent and it provides a more complicated setup than the isolated TKR model which includes the femoral component and the tibial insert. It includes bones, TKR implant, soft tissues and applied forces. Two probabilistic methods are used together with the FE model to generate the performance envelopes and to explore the key parameters: the Monte Carlo Simulation Technique (MCST) and the Response Surface Method (RSM). It is investigated how the uncertainties in a reduced set of 22 input variables of the FE model affect the kinematics and peak contact pressure of the knee tibial insert. The kinematics is reported in the Grood and Suntay system, where all motion is relative to the femoral component of the TKR. Reported tibial component kinematics are tibio-femoral flexion angle, anterior-posterior and medial-lateral displacement, internal-external and varus-valgus rotation (i. e. abduction-adduction), while the reported patella kinematics are patella-femoral flexion angle, medial-lateral shift and medial-lateral tilt. Tibio-femoral and patella-femoral contact pressures are also of interest. Following a sensitivity analysis, a reduced set of input variables is derived, which represent the set of key parameters which influence the performance envelopes. The findings of this <b>work</b> <b>are</b> <b>paramount</b> to the orthopedic surgeons who may want to know the key parameters that can influence the performance of the TKR for a given human activity...|$|R

However, the formation and resolution of identity in refugees and its relationship to their acculturation preferences have not been fully considered in mainstream identity theories and empirical studies. This study, first, explored identity (re) formation and resolution of fifty Karen refugees who were resettled in London, Canada. Fifty non-refugee Canadians served as comparisons. Secondly, the acculturation attitudes of Karen refugees were examined. Lastly, the relationship between identity and acculturation process was explored. The findings concerning the identity factors studied revealed that the resettlement process impaired the sense of temporal sameness and continuity; promoted confusion and crisis in identity; prolonged identity resolution; and stimulated distress concerning social and personal identity issues (work, career, values, group loyalties) for the refugees who participated in this study. The factor analysis of acculturation data yielded three factors which indicated that the Karens had diverse orientations regarding “customs and values”, “social relations”, and “leisure activities. ” Cluster analysis grouped these individuals into three segments: a segregated group, an integrated group, and an assimilated group. The assimilated Karens overwhelmingly endorsed Canadian values and customs and engaged in social relations and leisure activities with members of Canadian society. The segregated Karens clung to their old ways of life, values and practices. While open to change and willing to experiment with new leisure activities and social relations, Karens in the integration cluster preserved their values and customs. The regression analysis testing the impact of identity, mental health, and demographic factors on the acculturation strategies of Karen refugees indicated that poor identity and mental health results were significantly related to negative acculturation strategies, such as segregation. Consistent with its theoretical orientation and hypotheses, this study found that identity resolution and mental health were significant predictors of acculturation. This study also highlighted the fact that concerns about <b>work</b> <b>were</b> <b>paramount</b> for refugees.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the relationship between}} daily travel distance and spatial characteristics in Flanders (and partly also in Brussels), {{in the north of}} Belgium. Important regional variations in commuting trip lengths are noticed, which are related to the spatial-economic structure including aspects of population density and spatial proximity. Commuter data obtained from the General Socio-Economic Survey 2001 are area covering and offer a lot of information. It is obvious that residents in the economic core areas produce less commuter mobility than people living in remote areas that have still access to the Brussels-Antwerp region. Proximity between home and <b>work</b> locations <b>is</b> <b>paramount,</b> when proximity <b>is</b> defined at a large geographical scale. Next, the spatial distribution of commuting distances, based on residential location, is compared to overall daily travel patterns including non-work travel. Since the second kind of data is only available {{in the form of a}} rather small sample, a multivariate regression equation based on spatial characteristics has been developed in order to extrapolate sample data throughout the Flanders region. When assessing overall daily travel patterns, including non-work travel, variables based on the spatial distribution of jobs do not show significant effects on the travel distance. However, spatial proximity <b>is</b> again <b>paramount,</b> although proximity should now be defined at a much smaller geographical scale. When considering all daily travel, the distance between the residence and an even small urban centre is much more decisive than the distance to the economic core areas (which is mainly consisting of the Brussels-Antwerp region). This finding qualifies the limited importance of the commute: today, it is mainly non-professional travel that is growing. Furthermore, the results suggest that residential density and land use mix in urban areas is the best guarantee for curbing excessive forms of overall (but especially: non-commuter) mobility...|$|R

Then, we develop a likelihood ratio detector that compares the probability of observed network behavior under normal conditions against the case when an attacker has possibly compromised a subset of hosts within the network. Since the likelihood ratio detector requires integrating over the time each host be- comes compromised, we illustrate how to use Monte Carlo methods to compute the requisite integral. We then present Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves for various network parameterizations that show for any rate of true posi- tives, the rate of false positives for the likelihood ratio detector is no higher than that of a simple anomaly detector and is often lower.

Treatment included individual counseling (motivational interviewing, cognitive-behavior therapy, relapse prevention assignments), participation in an electronic support group and the development of a recovery team. Our findings of success with these interventions are reported elsewhere. Our experience has led to development of a protocol of care that is described more fully in this paper. This protocol is based on stages of change and relapse prevention theories and follows a Motivational Interviewing method of counseling. Conclusion The use of electronic media in providing mental health treatment remains controversial due to concerns about confidentiality, security and legal considerations. More research is needed to validate and generalize the use of online treatment for mental health problems. If researchers have to build on each others <b>work,</b> it <b>is</b> <b>paramount</b> that we share our protocols of care, as we have done in this paper. </p...|$|R
