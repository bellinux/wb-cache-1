50|$|Nearly {{any type}} of meat {{can be used to}} make the gelatin: pork, beef, veal, chicken, turkey, or fish. The aspic may need {{additional}} gelatin in order to set properly. Veal stock provides a great deal of gelatin; in making stock, veal is often included with other meat for that reason. Fish <b>consommés</b> usually have too little natural gelatin, so the fish stock may be double-cooked or supplemented. Since fish gelatin melts at a lower temperature than gelatins of other meats, fish aspic is more delicate and melts more readily in the mouth.|$|R

Depending on the activity of the enzymes it, up to 24 hours are needed to break down the proteins.

500|$|Warhol sent Blum thirty-two [...] canvases of Campbell's Soup can portraits, each {{representing}} a particular {{variety of the}} Campbell's Soup flavors available at the time. The thirty-two canvases are very similar: each is a realistic depiction of the iconic, mostly red and white Campbell's Soup can silkscreened onto a white background. The canvases have minor variation in the lettering of the variety names. Most of the letterings are painted in red letters. Four varieties have black lettering: Clam Chowder has parenthetical black lettering below the variety name that said (Manhattan Style), {{which means that the}} soup is tomato- and broth-based instead of the cream-based New England style; Beef has parenthetical black lettering below the variety name that says (With Vegetables and Barley); Scotch Broth has parenthetical black lettering below the variety name that said (A Hearty Soup); and Minestrone had black parenthetical lettering saying (Italian-Style Vegetable Soup). There are two varieties with red lettered parenthetical labels: Beef Broth (Bouillon) and <b>Consommé</b> (Beef). The font sizes only vary slightly in the variety names. However, there are a few notable stylistic font differences. Old-fashioned Tomato Rice is the only variety with lower case script. This lower case script appears to be from a slightly different font than the other variety name letters. There are other stylistic differences. Old-fashioned Tomato Rice has the word Soup depicted lower on the can, in place of a portion of ornamental starlike symbols at the bottom that the other 31 varieties have. Also, Cheddar Cheese has two banner-like addenda. In the middle-left, a small golden banner says New!, and a middle center golden banner says Great As A Sauce Too!.|$|E

6000|$|The dinner itself was, {{like every}} dinner that is given at Paris, {{beautiful}} in decoration, admirable in its order, and excellent in viands, or rather, in its dishes; {{for it is}} the cookery and not the staple articles that form the boast of the French kitchen. As you are notable in your own region for understanding these matters, I must say a word touching the gastric science as it is understood here. A general error exists in America on the subject of French cookery, which is not highly seasoned, but whose merit consists in blending flavours and in arranging compounds, in such a manner as to produce, at the same time, the lightest and most agreeable food. A lady who, from her public situation, receives once a week, for the entire year, and whose table has a reputation, assured me lately, that all the spices consumed annually in her kitchen did not cost her a franc. The effect of a French dinner is its principal charm. One of reasonably moderate habits, rises from the table with a sense of enjoyment, that, to a stranger, at least, is sometimes startling. I have, on several occasions, been afraid I was relaxing into the vices of a gourmet, if, indeed, vices they can be called. The gourmand is a beast, and there is nothing to be said in his favour; but, after all, I incline to the opinion that no one is the worse for a knowledge of what is agreeable to the palate. Perhaps no one of either sex is thoroughly trained, or properly bred, without being tant soit peu de gourmet. The difference between sheer eating, and eating with tact and intelligence, is so apparent as to need no explanation. A dinner here does not oppress one. The wine neither intoxicates nor heats, and the frame of mind and body in which one is left, is precisely that best suited to intellectual and social pleasures. I make no doubt, that one of the chief causes of the French being so agreeable as companions, is, in a considerable degree, owing to the admirable qualities of their table. A national character may emanate from a kitchen. Roast beef, bacon, pudding, and beer, and port, will make a different man, in time, from Chateau Margau, côtelettes, <b>consommés,</b> and soufflés. The very name of vol au vent is enough to make one walk on air! ...|$|R
40|$|Objectives To assess gender {{differences}} in frequencies of alcohol use, drunkenness, tobacco and cannabis among adults in France according {{to the level of}} education, and socio-occupational category in France. Methods The Health Barometer 2005 is a wide magnifscent national telephone survey which is representative of the 12 - 75 year olds (n= 30 ° 514). Our study focuses on the active people aged 26 - 54 (n= 20 ° 159). Data were analysed using logistic regression models controlling for age. Results Except for psychotropic medicines, levels of drug use are higher among men than women. We conducted logistic regressions in order to control for age. For both genders, unemployement is linked with increased tobacco consumption (ORa close to 2). Among men, frequency of alcohol use, drunkenness and psychotropic medicines use appear higher among unemployed people (Ora= 1, 2, 1, 3 and 1, 9), whereas this effect is not significant among women. Among women, frequency of alcohol use, drunkenness and cannabis use appear higher among executive than manual workers (Ora= 1, 8, 1, 6 and 1, 8), whereas no significant difference appear among men. Similar results are found with level of education which is linked with increased frequencies of alcohol use, drunkenness and cannabis use among women whereas the result is opposite among men. As a consequence, the sex ratio diminishes with the elevation in the social position whatever the indicator: employment, type of jobs and level of diploma. Conclusion As men generally use more drugs than women, we show that men tend to adopt feminine behaviours and women masculine behaviours when they have a high position in the society. This suggests that use of drug is differently mediated by social roles among men and women. Explorer les modes de consommation de différentes substances psychoactives permet de montrer que le rapport au produit ne se résume pas à une simple caractéristique sexuelle. Si certains produits sont plus <b>consommés</b> par les hommes (alcool et cannabis) et d'autres par les femmes (médicaments psychotropes), ces tendances peuvent varier suivant l'âge, le niveau d'éducation et le milieu social des personnes. Les modes de consommation apparaissent moins liés au sexe des individus qu'aux rôles sociaux qui modèlent les rapports entre hommes et femmes. Les différences de comportements entre hommes et femmes sont moins marquées dans les milieux favorisés que dans les milieux populaires, suggérant que la prévention, si elle a à gagner à prendre le genre en considération, ne peut faire l'économie d'accorder une place importante aux contextes sociaux de consommation...|$|R

2500|$|A French dip {{sandwich}}, {{also known}} as a beef dip, is a hot sandwich consisting of thinly sliced roast beef (or, sometimes, other meats) on a [...] "French roll" [...] or baguette. It is usually served au jus ("with juice"), that is, with beef juice from the cooking process. Beef broth or beef <b>consommé</b> is sometimes substituted. Despite the sandwich's name, the French dip sandwich was not invented in France, but in the United States. Both Philippe the Original's and Cole's Pacific Electric Buffet, two restaurants in Los Angeles, claim to have invented the French dip sandwich. Philippe Mathieu may have possibly invented the sandwich by accident around the year 1918, who according to one story, accidentally dropped a sandwich in a pan of au jus. Another story is that a fireman to Philippe's restaurant found his roast beef sandwich roll to be too hard. Thus, Philippe had it dipped in juice. Whatever the origin, Cole's Pacific Electric Buffet also claims to have invented the French dip sandwich as well.|$|E
