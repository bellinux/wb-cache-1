5|$|The red fox is {{considered}} a more specialised form of Vulpes than the Afghan, <b>corsac</b> and Bengal foxes {{in the direction of}} size and adaptation to carnivory; the skull displays much fewer neotenous traits than in other species, and its facial area is more developed. It is, however, not as adapted for a purely carnivorous diet as the Tibetan fox.|$|E
5|$|Campbell's dwarf hamsters {{may also}} live near areas of human civilization. In Mongolia, {{they may be}} found in yurts to keep warm during the winter, as they do not have {{thermoregulation}} like the Djungarian hamster. They have five main predators: the Eurasian eagle owl, the steppe eagle, the <b>corsac</b> fox, the common kestrel, and the saker falcon. All distribution areas have more females than males, because males are at higher risk from predators, as they cannot move as quickly.|$|E
5|$|Their skulls {{are fairly}} narrow and elongated, with small braincases. Their canine teeth are {{relatively}} long. Sexual dimorphism {{of the skull}} is more pronounced than in <b>corsac</b> foxes, with female red foxes tending to have smaller skulls than males, with wider nasal regions and hard palates, as well as having larger canines. Their skulls are distinguished from those of dogs by their narrower muzzles, less crowded premolars, more slender canine teeth, and concave rather than convex profiles.|$|E

50|$|Steppe pika inhabits steppes {{covered by}} high grasses and bushes, where it finds shelter from its natural enemies, such as: foxes, <b>corsacs,</b> Turkestan polecats, ermine and other predators. Another of its niches is {{foothill}} of river valleys. In contrary to {{other species of}} the family of pikas, Ochotona pusilla is a nocturnal creature. It is normally heard but not seen. The males emit a long series of low trills and the females do also sing to attract males and respond to other females. It lives in a flock, dwelling systems of underground passages with several openings. Pika feeds on soft parts of juicy plants and low shrubs, near its dens. One of its favorite plants is wormwood. Due to the fact it doesn’t hibernate during winter, early (from June) it begins to gather grass, and dry it formed in haystacks. In the late autumn it moves the haystacks to the main chamber of its den.|$|R
5|$|Gray wolves {{typically}} dominate other canid {{species in}} areas where they both occur. In North America, incidents of gray wolves killing coyotes are common, particularly in winter, when coyotes feed on wolf kills. Wolves may attack coyote den sites, digging out and killing their pups, though rarely eating them. There are no records of coyotes killing wolves, though coyotes may chase wolves if they outnumber them. Near identical interactions have been observed in Eurasia between gray wolves and golden jackals, with the latter's numbers being comparatively small in areas with high wolf densities. Gray wolves {{are the most important}} predator of raccoon dogs, killing large numbers of them {{in the spring and summer}} periods. Wolves also kill red, arctic and <b>corsac</b> foxes, usually in disputes over carcasses, sometimes eating them. In Asia, they may compete with dholes, though there is at least one record of a lone wolf associating with a pair of dholes in Debrigarh Wildlife Sanctuary.|$|E
25|$|Dogs {{are known}} to be {{susceptible}} to L. donovani infection. Especially in the New World, infection is a zoonotic disease, involving different canine species, including domestic dog and the two fox species, Lycalopex vetulus and Cerdocyon thous. In the Mediterranean region domestic dogs and the three fox species Vulpes vulpes, V. <b>corsac</b> and V. zerda are common reservoir hosts. In Africa and Brazil, some marsupials and rodents are also reported to harbour L. donovani.|$|E
25|$|Mammalian {{carnivores}} {{can compete}} {{for some of}} the same prey as golden eagles but can also themselves become prey, the main prey family of carnivores being the canids (dog family). 12 species of canid are known to have been hunted by golden eagles and they collectively make up about 2.8% of the diet from all surveyed golden eagle nests. For the most part, foxes are the preferred prey, usually as juveniles though foxes of any age or condition, including adult male red foxes (Vulpes vulpes) heavier than the eagles themselves, may be hunted. Across much of both species' ranges, red fox co-exist with golden eagles and eagles hunt them in small numbers. Red foxes make up 13.5% of nest remains in Sicily and 5.9% in the Republic of Macedonia. In a nest in Mongolia, <b>Corsac</b> fox (Vulpes <b>corsac)</b> were surprisingly the main prey species, making up 38% of sampled remains. Kit fox (Vulpes macrotis), swift fox (Vulpes velox), gray fox (Urocyon cinereoargenteus) and island fox (Urocyon littoralis) are readily predated in North America. The other family of carnivores that turns up with some regularity in the golden eagle's diet are the mustelids, at about 2.3% of the diet. Everything in this diverse family from least weasels (Mustela nivalis), the smallest mammalian carnivore, to wolverines (Gulo gulo), the largest terrestrial mustelid, have turned up as prey in golden eagle nests. The members of this family which are most regularly hunted are probably the martens, such as the American marten (Martes americanus), pine marten (Martes martes) and beech marten. The young of larger species are also occasionally hunted in Scotland and Ireland, including Eurasian otters (Lutra lutra) and Eurasian badgers (Meles meles). Similarly, amongst wolverines, “young and inexperienced” specimens are usually targeted as prey by golden eagles. In North America, full-grown large mustelids, including American badgers (Taxidea taxus) and fishers (Martes pennanti), have also turned up as prey. The largest percentage of mustelids was 13.2% in a nest in central Alaska. Mustelids, mainly martens, turned up in large numbers in the French Alps where they made up 10.1% of nest remains.|$|E
500|$|Females {{are called}} vixens, and young cubs {{are known as}} kits. Although the Arctic fox has a small native {{population}} in northern Scandinavia, while the <b>corsac</b> fox's range extends into European Russia, the red fox is the only fox native to Western Europe, and so is simply called [...] "the fox" [...] in colloquial British English.|$|E
500|$|Red foxes {{typically}} dominate other fox species. Arctic foxes generally escape {{competition from}} red foxes by living farther north, where food is too scarce {{to support the}} larger-bodied red species. Although the red species' northern limit {{is linked to the}} availability of food, the Arctic species' southern range is limited by the presence of the former. Red and Arctic foxes were both introduced to almost every island from the Aleutian Islands to the Alexander Archipelago during the 1830s–1930s by fur companies. The red foxes invariably displaced the Arctic foxes, with one male red fox having been reported to have killed off all resident Arctic foxes on a small island in 1866. Where they are sympatric, Arctic foxes may also escape competition by feeding on lemmings and flotsam, rather than voles, as favoured by red foxes. Both species will kill each other's kits, given the opportunity. Red foxes are serious competitors of <b>corsac</b> foxes, as they hunt the same prey all year. The red species is also stronger, is better adapted to hunting in snow deeper than [...] and is more effective in hunting and catching medium to large-sized rodents. <b>Corsac</b> foxes seem to only outcompete red foxes in semi-desert and steppe areas. In Israel, Blanford's foxes escape competition with red foxes by restricting themselves to rocky cliffs and actively avoiding the open plains inhabited by red foxes. Red foxes dominate kit and swift foxes. Kit foxes usually avoid competition with their larger cousins by living in more arid environments, though red foxes have been increasing in ranges formerly occupied by kit foxes due to human-induced environmental changes. Red foxes will kill both species, and compete for food and den sites. Grey foxes are exceptional, as they dominate red foxes wherever their ranges meet. Historically, interactions between the two species were rare, as grey foxes favoured heavily wooded or semiarid habitats as opposed to the open and mesic ones preferred by red foxes. However, interactions have become more frequent due to deforestation allowing red foxes to colonise grey fox-inhabited areas.|$|E
500|$|Outside the {{breeding}} season, most red foxes favour {{living in the}} open, in densely vegetated areas, though they may enter burrows to escape bad weather. Their burrows are often dug on hill or mountain slopes, ravines, bluffs, steep banks of water bodies, ditches, depressions, gutters, in rock clefts and neglected human environments. Red foxes prefer to dig their burrows on well drained soils. Dens built among tree roots can last for decades, while those dug on the steppes last only several years. They may permanently abandon their dens during mange outbreaks, possibly as a defence mechanism against the spread of disease. In the Eurasian desert regions, foxes may use the burrows of wolves, porcupines and other large mammals, {{as well as those}} dug by gerbil colonies. Compared to burrows constructed by Arctic foxes, badgers, marmots and <b>corsac</b> foxes, red fox dens are not overly complex. Red fox burrows are divided into a den and temporary burrows, which consist only of a small passage or cave for concealment. The main entrance of the burrow leads downwards (40–45°) and broadens into a den, from which numerous side tunnels branch. Burrow depth ranges from , rarely extending to ground water. The main passage can reach [...] in length, standing an average of [...] In spring, red foxes clear their dens of excess soil through rapid movements, first with the forepaws then with kicking motions with their hind legs, throwing the discarded soil over [...] from the burrow. When kits are born, the discarded debris is trampled, thus forming a spot where the kits can play and receive food. They may share their dens with woodchucks or badgers. Unlike badgers, which fastidiously clean their earths and defecate in latrines, red foxes habitually leave pieces of prey around their dens.> The average sleep time of a captive red fox is 9.8 hours per day.|$|E
50|$|The <b>corsac</b> fox (Vulpes <b>corsac),</b> {{also known}} simply as a <b>corsac,</b> is a {{medium-sized}} fox found in steppes, semi-deserts and deserts in Central Asia, ranging into Mongolia and northeastern China. Since 2004, it has been classified as least concern by IUCN, but populations fluctuate significantly, and numbers can drop tenfold within a single year.|$|E
50|$|The <b>corsac</b> fox is {{one species}} within a holarctic clade of foxes that also {{includes}} the red fox, the swift fox and the Arctic fox, all of which it resembles. However, the closest related species to the <b>corsac</b> fox is probably the Tibetan sand fox. The immediate ancestor of the <b>corsac</b> fox {{is believed to be}} the extinct species Vulpes praecorsac, which lived in central Europe during the early Pleistocene. Fossils of <b>corsac</b> foxes date back to the mid-Pleistocene, and show the species once reached as far west as Switzerland, and as far south as Crimea.|$|E
50|$|It is {{also known}} as the Afghan fox, royal fox, dog fox, hoary fox, steppe fox, black fox, king fox (شاه‌روباه shāhrūbāh in Persian), cliff fox or Baluchistan fox.

50|$|The {{major threat}} posed to the <b>corsac</b> fox is poaching. They are slow runners and are easily caught by hunters, and their {{population}} has been reduced in areas {{where they have been}} heavily hunted for their fur. In the late 19th century, up to 10,000 foxes were killed annually for pelt trade. The general population remains healthy, however, as the <b>corsac</b> fox has proven to be able to withstand great hunting pressures, and their habitats remain intact due to the low population density in its range. Their other main threat is natural disasters, which can cause the numbers of foxes to drop 90% in some areas, but the population often recovers quickly. As of 2008, the <b>corsac</b> fox is listed as least concern in the IUCN Red List.|$|E
50|$|Arctic foxes inhabit {{all of the}} Arctic (Greenland, Russia, Canada, Alaska, Svalbard), Iceland, {{and parts}} of Scandinavia, and hold the title of being the only native land mammal in all of Iceland. This fox arrived in Iceland during {{the climax of the}} last ice age, when the seas were frozen solid enough to walk across. Two extant subpopulations of this species are alive today. The Arctic fox is most closely related to kit (V. macrotis) and <b>corsac</b> foxes (V. <b>corsac).</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Corsac</b> foxes are {{reported}} to bark during hunting or when threatening rivals, and to use higher pitch yelps or chirps as alarm calls or social greetings.|$|E

50|$|As an {{adaption}} to {{the arid}} {{climate in which}} they live, <b>corsac</b> foxes need little water to survive, obtaining most of the moisture they need from their food. Their diets consist mainly of insects and small rodents, such as voles, gerbils, jerboas, hamsters, and ground squirrels. They may also eat larger prey from time to time, including hares and pikas, and will scavenge for carrion and human refuse. Although predominantly carnivorous, they do occasionally eat fruit and other vegetation, especially when animal prey are scarce. Natural predators of <b>corsac</b> foxes include wolves, eagles, buzzards, and eagle-owls.|$|E
50|$|These foxes inhabit open grassy steppes and semideserts, {{and avoid}} dense {{vegetation}} and mountainous regions. True deserts with drifting sands are also avoided, as are snowfields {{more than about}} 15 cm deep. <b>Corsac</b> foxes generally stay far away from human disturbances.|$|E
50|$|Nowadays, Burabay's forests host deers, mooses, wild boars, roe deers, squirrels, stoats, weasels, martens. Amongst the predators, {{wolves and}} lynx might be encountered.
