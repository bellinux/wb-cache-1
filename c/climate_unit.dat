40|$|Abels and Mushaben (2012) {{argue that}} there is a double {{democratic}} deficit in the EU regarding gender: women are underrepresented within the EU institutions and gender awareness is lacking in EU policymaking. This article contributes to that scholarship with its specific focus on the climate domain. EU is an important constructor of the international climate regime and the Union is committed to gender mainstream all its policies and processes. Furthermore there are documented gender differences in Europe regarding behavior and views on climate change. (Räty and Carlsson-Kanyama 2010, Goldsmith et al. 2013). This article investigates the relevancy of the double democratic deficit for EU´s climate policymaking. We map the representation of female and male experts at the Commission´s <b>climate</b> <b>units</b> and search for gender recognition in EU´s climate documents. There we discover silence regarding gender, confirmed through interviews with policy-makers. Using feminist institutionalism we conclude that existing gender power relations within the Commission affect the explored <b>climate</b> <b>units,</b> which reproduce masculine institutional practices...|$|R
40|$|This masters thesis {{concerns}} a modeling project performed at Volvo Technology in Gothenburg, Sweden. The {{main purpose of}} the project has been to develop a physical model of the climate in construction vehicles that later on {{can be used in}} the development of an electronic climate controller. The focus of the work has been on one type of wheel loader and one type of excavator. The temperature inside the compartment has been set equal to the notion climate. With physical theories about air flow and heat transfer in respect, relations between the components in the <b>climate</b> <b>unit</b> and the compartment has been calculated. Parameters that has had unknown values has been estimated. The relations have then been implemented in the modeling tool Simulink. The validation of the model has been carried out by comparison between measured data and modeled values by calculation of Root Mean Square and correlation. Varying the estimated parameters and identifying the change in the output signal, i. e the temperature of the compartment, have performed a sensitivity analysis. The result of the validation has shown that the factor with the greatest influence on the temperature in the vehicle is the airflow through the <b>climate</b> <b>unit</b> and the outlets. Minor changes of airflow have resulted in major changes in temperature. The validation principally shows that the model gives a good estimation of the temperature in the compartment. The static values of the model differs from the values of the measured data but is regarded being as within an acceptable margin of error. The weakness of the model is mainly its predictions of the dynamics, which does not correlate satisfyingly with the data...|$|E
40|$|A {{meaningful}} {{assessment of}} policy options within the forest-based bioeconomy presupposes {{the capability to}} model market implications. To this end, an economic forest-based sector model, the Global Forest Trade Model (GFTM), is being developed at the Forest Resources and <b>Climate</b> <b>unit</b> of the Institute for Environment and Sustainability (IES). The GFTM is an equilibrium trade-based model for the forest sector {{with the aim of}} providing projections of production and trade of wood-based products and pellets for 48 countries/sub-regions of the world, with a focus on EU. This technical report describes the set-up of the model. The study outlines the theoretical framework, the programming of the model in MatLab, data collection, parameters used, and the calibration of the model. Presented test runs with GFTM indicates that the model behaves in a logically consistent way, all in all well in line what can be expected from economic theory. The next steps in the development process entail trying out linkages with a forest resource model and a dedicated energy model. JRC. H. 3 -Forest Resources and Climat...|$|E

An illustration of practical physical model properties is of cardinal importance for experimental engineering exercises, for comparing computer simulation tasks with practical experience and with real-time measured signals from technological aggregates. This paper deals with the important role laboratory experimental stands play with microcomputers for quality control engineering education and the design and verification of new control algorithms. At the Department of CSI VŠB-TU FME Ostrava a HAA 2005 model (Hot-Air Aggregate) of <b>climate</b> <b>unit</b> with two controlled variables (temperature, air flow) was designed and produced. The HAA model, as an air tool (air-conditioning), is a dynamic system with multiple inputs and outputs.

40|$|This {{study is}} {{designed}} to test the mediating role of work satisfaction {{in the relationship between}} work <b>unit</b> <b>climate</b> and labour productivity. Two work <b>unit</b> <b>climate</b> facets are examined: goals and service orientation. Longitudinal data obtained from more than 14, 000 employees in 171 branches of a financial services organization provided no evidence for work satisfaction as a mediator of the relationship between work <b>unit</b> <b>climate</b> and productivity. An increase in service orientation and an increase in goals orientation are both associated with an increase in work satisfaction. An increase in work satisfaction is not associated with an increase in productivity, thereby precluding a mediation effect. An increase in service orientation is related to increased labour productivity, but an increase in goals orientation is not. In addition, relationships across time are reported and interpreted. In this study no evidence was found for work satisfaction as an intermediary mechanism, however, results highlight the importance of differential effects of the two work <b>unit</b> <b>climate</b> facets on work satisfaction and labour productivity.

40|$|We {{examine a}} {{distributed}} control problem for internal flow management in a multi-zone <b>climate</b> <b>unit.</b> The problem consists of guaranteeing prescribed indoor climate conditions {{in a cascade}} connection of an arbitrarily large number of communicating zones, in which air masses are exchanged to redirect warm air from hot zones (which need to be cooled down) to cold zones (which need to be heated up), and to draw as much fresh air as possible to hot zones, relying on the ventilation capacity of neighboring “collaborative ” zones. The controller of each zone must be designed so as to achieve the prescribed climate condition, while fulfilling the constraints imposed by the neighboring zones — due to their willingness to cooperate or not in the air exchange — and the conservation of flow, and despite the action of unknown disturbances. We devise control laws which yield hybrid closed-loop systems, depend on local feedback information, take on values in a finite discrete set, and cooperate with neighbor controllers to achieve different compatible control objectives, while avoiding conflicts...|$|E

40|$|In {{what way}} would a façade {{be able to}} create a {{comfortable}} indoor office environment using only the indoor and outdoor environment as its energy sources? The low (average) outdoor temperatures in The Netherlands suggest that the outdoor climate is cold enough to cool the indoor climate through ventilation with fresh outdoor air without resorting to active climate control, such as through centralised air conditioning. The Comfort Unit (CU) is created using the ‘research by design’ method, evolving from a fully integrated façade design to a stand-alone <b>climate</b> <b>unit</b> in combination with an undefined façade and a standard office. By using the CU, optimal use can be made of both internal and external energy sources, thereby reducing the energy consumption for heating and cooling. This CU differentiates itself from systems already on the market by integrating both an air-to- air heat exchanger and thermal storage through the use of PCM in one device, while potential additional heating is achieved through electric heating rather than {{through the use of a}} water-to-air heat exchanger. In order to make optimal use of the CU, the space it is placed in needs to adhere to a number of prerequisites concerning the amount of thermal mass available as a thermal buffer for the indoor climate, the effectiveness of shading, the amount of thermal mass (PCM) available in the CU, the amount of additional heating, the amount of ventilation and the internal heat load. Once these basic conditions are met, an office room can be kept at a comfortable temperature and provided with ample fresh air all year round using the CU in combination with almost any façade design, while consuming less than 5 kWh/m 2 per year for heating.

40|$|This article {{deals with}} the issue of a {{methodology}} for and analyzing biomass potential in the Czech Republic using a geographic information system. The biomass sources considered include cereal and rape straw, permanent grasslands and forest residuals. The process of assessing biomass potential from agricultural soils is based on assigning yields of individual biomass sources according to the production soil-ecological units (BPEJ) which were created for better agricultural planning in the Czech and Slovak Republics. The analysis of energy crop suitability is based on the evaluation of crop yields related to individual BPEJ’s respectively to its component the main soil <b>climate</b> <b>units</b> (HPKJ). To ascertain the production potential of residual biomass (straw) from conventional agriculture, the wheat (grain) yield related to HPKJ was multiplied by the straw coefficient. The yield of the permanent grasslands in the main soil <b>climate</b> <b>units</b> was also multiplied by the coefficient of dry matter. The me­tho­do­lo­gy for the analysis of biomass potential for forest land is based on forest management plans that describe the composition of all forest stands. Data from these forest management plans can be used to determine in detail the potential of the forest biomass in individual periods according to the plan for silvacultural treatment and major harvest of the wood. This detailed analysis is suitable only on the municipality level. On a higher government level, the forest management plan can be used to calculate a coefficient that determines the average yield from biomass in the form of forest residuals and in relation to the forest size for specific areas or levels of analysis. The energy potential of residual biomass is around 136 PJ from present area of conventional agriculture in the Czech Republic. Biomass consumption in animal production and harvest loses were deducted from this calculation...|$|R
40|$|The Laingsburg {{depocenter}} of the SW Karoo Basin, South Africa, {{includes a}} series of sandstone-dominated deepwater clastic deposits (units A and B of the Laingsburg Formation and Unit C to Unit G of the overlying Fort Brown Formation) separated vertically by regional mudstones and records basin-floor to upper-slope deposition during the Permian icehouse <b>climate.</b> <b>Unit</b> C provides nearly continuous exposures over tens of kilometers, {{and the presence of}} regionally persistent internal mudstone markers (lower and upper C mudstones) allows the distribution of sedimentary facies and architectural elements of a slope-turbidite system to be documented for more than 30 km downslope and 20 km across slope. The spatial and temporal distribution of architectural elements and interpreted depositional environments (external levees, channel belts confined by a combination of basal erosion and overbank aggradation along the margins, and distributive frontal splays) reveals distinct changes in the sedimentation pattern and stratal architecture of the turbidite system through time. Unit C evolved in a stepwise manner from a weakly incised, levee-confined channel belt and its downdip distributive frontal splays (C 1), through a more entrenched and sinuous channel–levee complex set that fed submarine fans farther into the basin (C 2), to a regionally backstepping package of thin-bedded deposits of a distal distributive system (C 3). Unit C is interpreted as a lowstand sequence set, composed of three depositional sequences, each of which includes a sandstone-dominated lowstand systems tract (C 1, C 2, and C 3) and a mudstone-prone interval that is taken to represent the transgressive and highstand systems tracts. The overlying combined transgressive and highstand sequence set is marked by the 30 -m-thick C–D mudstone interposed between Unit C and Unit D. Unit C and the C–D mudstone together form the Unit C composite sequence. At the scale of the Unit C lowstand sequence set, the evolutionary trend from C 1 to C 3 reflects an overall basinward then landward stepping of the system across the depositional profile, which is interpreted as the product of an overall waxing then waning of flow energy (volume and efficiency) ...|$|E
