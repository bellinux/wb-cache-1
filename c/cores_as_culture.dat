40|$|Taking {{its place}} {{alongside}} such <b>core</b> metaphors <b>as</b> <b>culture,</b> phenomenon, discourse, and narrative, identity {{has emerged as}} an important trope in qualitative research. Be it people 2 ̆ 7 s sense of themselves {{as members of a}} family, culture, corporation, or the world society, qualitative researchers are interested in learning how people come to define themselves within their varied contexts. This area of research is also fraught with controversy as researchers and their research participants struggle with gender, sexual, cultural, brand, product, customer, and corporate identities and the methodological and ethical decisions entailed in studying such phenomena. An associated concern is how do we clearly and ethically identify ourselves as researchers to our research participants, clients, and colleagues and how they come to identify us? How transparent do we become as we dance with our own self-identity and the identities of others? As these dance steps are made, how do we as producers and consumers of these (e) merging arcs make decisions of quality and utility? As we explore these self-narratives and narratives of others, what are the differences that make a difference in our qualitative research...|$|R

Within this culture, the word [...] "disabled" [...] has been re-purposed to represent a social identity of empowerment and awareness. Like many civil rights movements in the past, disability culture challenges the norms of society, and seeks to counter oppressive entities such as medicalization and institutionalization. Its <b>core</b> values <b>as</b> a <b>culture</b> are reflected in art, conversation, goals, or behaviors. These core values often include: [...] "an acceptance of human differences, an acceptance of human vulnerability and interdependence, a tolerance {{for a lack of}} resolution of the unpredictable in life, and a humor to laugh at the oppressor or situation, however dire it may be".|$|R
40|$|The aerobic and {{heterotrophic}} bacterial {{community of}} a hard-water rivulet in the Harz Mountain, North Germany, was investigated {{with respect to}} culture and non-culture approaches. The rivulet contains {{a high number of}} phylogenetically different and novel members of the domain Bacteria, which, as determined by comparative DGGE analysis, mainly seem to be seeping from the surrounding soil reservoir. Of the organisms cultured from water flavobacteria constituted by far the highest fraction. Their number is significantly reduced at a tufa-forming site and they are almost absent in deeper layers of a tufa <b>core</b> <b>as</b> determined by <b>culture</b> studies. The Westerhöfer Bach, is subject to tufa formation 50 meters after its discharge. While the carbonate system of fluvial karst-waters is largely controlled by physicochemical CO 2 degassing, the biological impact on calcite nucleation, fabric formation and early diagenesis within tufa-forming biofilms is still poorly understood. This system has been investigated by a broad range of different scientific disciplines the results of which will published (Arp et al., 2010) The pH and the temperature of the water raises from 7. 3 to 8. 32 and 9. 0 to 10. 2...|$|R
40|$|Social impact {{assessment}} (SIA) is now conceived {{as being the}} process of managing the social issues of development. There is consensus on what 2 ̆ 7 good 2 ̆ 7 SIA practice is - it is participatory; it supports affected peoples, proponents and regulatory agencies; it increases understanding of change and capacities to respond to change; it seeks to avoid and mitigate negative impacts and to enhance positive benefits across {{the life cycle of}} developments; and it emphasizes enhancing the lives of vulnerable and disadvantaged people. We analyse the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats facing SIA. We assert that the SIA community needs to revisit <b>core</b> concepts, such <b>as</b> <b>culture,</b> community, power, human rights, gender, justice, place, resilience and sustainable livelihoods. It is incumbent on SIA practitioners to educate proponents, regulators and colleagues about these concepts, and to embed them into practice norms. Stronger engagement with the emerging trends of free, prior and informed consent (FPIC); human rights {{impact assessment}}; social performance standards; supply chain management; governance; local content and economic development will improve the relevance and demonstrable value of SIA to all stakeholders...|$|R
40|$|Transformative {{learning}} {{has been identified}} as contributing to the success of education programs in engendering sustainable behaviour in the built environment. In professional degree programs such as architecture, what impact does the nature of the learning experience of students have on the opportunities for transformation? Transformative learning is supported by opportunities for critical reflection, increased self-awareness of learning, and visible demonstration of progress. The teaching of design in architecture includes many of these elements, but in other <b>core</b> teaching, such <b>as</b> <b>culture</b> and science, the learning experience tends to be more transmissive in its nature. This paper will explore examples of alternative methods of architectural education which include experiential learning - learning by doing as a way of developing understanding and making meaning - and integrated curriculum – using the information and skills learnt in one subject to explore ideas in another. By investigating the learning experiences as a system, and considering the different contexts in which learning can take place, an ethno-methodological approach will be used to identify and document key elements of the transformative learning experience. The findings from this investigation will inform the development of a pedagogical framework for environmental education, such as architecture...|$|R
