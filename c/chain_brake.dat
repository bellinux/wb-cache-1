5|$|The Met {{opened with}} no stock of its own, with the GWR {{and then the}} GNR {{providing}} services. The GWR used eight-wheeled compartment carriages constructed from teak. By 1864, the Met had taken delivery of its own stock, made by the Ashbury Railway Carriage & Iron Co., based on the GWR design but standard gauge. Lighting was provided by gas— two jets in first class compartments and one in second and third class compartments, and from 1877 a pressurised oil gas system was used. Initially the carriages were braked with wooden blocks operated by hand from the guards' compartments at {{the front and back}} of the train, giving off a distinctive smell. This was replaced in 1869 by a chain that operated brakes on all carriages. The operation of the <b>chain</b> <b>brake</b> could be abrupt, leading to some passenger injuries, and it was replaced by a non-automatic vacuum brake by 1876. In the 1890s, a mechanical 'next station' indicator was tested in some carriages on the circle, triggered by a wooden flap between the tracks. It was considered unreliable and not approved for full installation.|$|E
25|$|Helmet {{protection}} {{can only}} be successful if the <b>chain</b> <b>brake</b> has been operated to stop the saw chain, since a chain running at full speed can easily cut into the helmet. The helmet, and its eye protection guard, also protect against impacts from small falling or flying objects, such as dead twigs and branches from a tree being felled.|$|E
25|$|The safety mitt {{ensures that}} if {{kickback}} occurs the operator's hand {{remains on the}} bar of the chainsaw. This means that the kickback is more easily controlled and the <b>chain</b> <b>brake</b> is more easily engaged. The safety mitt also protects the operator's left hand {{in the same way}} as chainsaw safety gloves. The protection on the left hand mitt protects when the chain derails and jumps over the front handle.|$|E
50|$|The {{locomotives}} were {{equipped with}} Clarke's <b>chain</b> <b>brakes.</b> The braking system {{proved to be}} unsatisfactory, since breaking of the chain was not uncommon. In one instance {{this resulted in a}} bad accident with loss of life while a train was descending the Hex River rail pass.|$|R
50|$|Additional safety {{features}} {{are a significant}} commercial advantage to chainsaw producers. Companies continue to develop new features over time. Most chainsaw {{safety features}} {{are focused on the}} kickback problem, and seek to either avoid it (chain and bar design), or {{to reduce the risk of}} injury should it occur (<b>chain</b> <b>brakes).</b>|$|R
50|$|In the {{earliest}} days of railways, trains were slowed or stopped by the application of manually applied brakes on the locomotive and in brake vehicles through the train, and later by steam power brakes on locomotives. This was clearly unsatisfactory, but the existing technology did not offer an improvement. A <b>chain</b> <b>braking</b> system was developed, requiring a chain to be coupled throughout the train, but it was impossible to arrange equal braking effort along the entire train.|$|R
500|$|The steam {{carriages}} {{were four}} wheeled, [...] long over the buffers. First, {{second and third}} class compartments were available. First class carriages had four compartments, the others five. Lighting was initially provided by burning coal gas held in bags on the roof, later by a pressurised oil gas system. At first they were fitted with a <b>chain</b> <b>brake.</b> This {{was replaced by the}} simple Westinghouse brake and then a fully automatic Westinghouse brake.|$|E
500|$|The first {{carriages}} were [...] four-wheelers, [...] long. Painted a {{dark brown}} with yellow lining and lettering, they had Newall's <b>chain</b> <b>brake</b> and a seat for the guard on the roof. Two classes of accommodation were provided: {{the first class}} carriages were divided into three compartments each with six upholstered seats and lit by two oil lamps hung between the partitions. Third class passengers were seated on wooden benches in a carriage seating 40 passengers sharing one oil lamp. The Great North never owned any second class carriages. Built by Brown, Marshall & Co, only half the number of carriages ordered had arrived {{for the start of}} public services in 1854. Later the guard's seat was removed and longer vehicles with six wheels were built. Accommodation for third class passengers was improved in the 1880s and the seats were upholstered.|$|E
2500|$|The first {{carriages}} {{used by the}} Inverness & Nairn Railway were of {{the short}} four-wheeled type and had accommodation for first and third class. A mail van made in 1858 for the Inverness to Keith route survived until 1903; this was [...] long, and fitted with Newall's <b>chain</b> <b>brake.</b> Luggage was carried on the roof, behind a railing, where {{there was also a}} seat for the guard, and dogs were placed in a boot. Later carriages did not have the seat for the guard and space for luggage on the roof. Longer carriages were ordered for the line to Wick, [...] long, and these seated 50 passengers in third class. Six-wheeled carriages were introduced in the late 1870s, the first class seating sixteen passenger with access to toilets and the third class seating fifty passengers; these were still lit by oil lamps. Second class accommodation was available after the direct line to Perth opened, but this was not popular as it offering little extra comfort over third class, and was abolished in 1893. A six-wheeled carriage built at Lochgram in 1909 has been preserved by the Scottish Railway Preservation Society.|$|E

5000|$|Winsford (1948) - A {{soldier on}} leave, himself a former signalbox worker, pulled the <b>chain</b> (emergency <b>brake)</b> {{of the train}} in order to exploit a short cut to their home. It took some time for train crew to find and rectify the {{triggered}} brake. In the meantime, a following train ran past a red signal and collided with the first trains, causing casualties. The soldiers did own up to pulling the emergency cord without good reason.|$|R
50|$|The <b>chain</b> <b>brake</b> {{is located}} in the clutch cover. Here a band {{tensions}} around the Clutch drum stopping the chain within milliseconds. The <b>chain</b> <b>brake</b> is released by the upper handle with the hand or wrist. The brake is intended to be used in kick-back moments.|$|E
50|$|The <b>chain</b> <b>brake,</b> {{an early}} British railway brake, {{was similar to}} the Heberlein brake but used a chain, instead of a cable. An example was the Clark and Webb <b>Chain</b> <b>Brake,</b> used by the London and North Western Railway. Early {{versions}} were non-automatic and would not stop the train if a coupling broke.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>chain</b> <b>brake</b> {{may also}} be of use when {{sharpening}} a chain on a bar, as it allows robust filing to take place without the chain slipping about.|$|E
50|$|A <b>brake</b> <b>chain</b> {{under the}} {{downhill}} end controls speed in steep terrain when pressure {{is applied to}} the front spars which proportionally affects the location and length of the chain to regulate the braking effect. A line attached to the toboggan secures it to a rescuer.|$|R
40|$|Nitrite-cured meat products, such {{as common}} {{sausages}} and hams, obtain their colour and their resistance against rancidity {{as the result}} of the reaction between nitrite and reducing components in the muscle or added ascorbate (vitamin C) in connection with the salting process. Nitrite oxide is formed and bound to myoglobin to give the well-known red colour of cured meat, or nitrite oxide is bound to the meat proteins and act as a <b>chain</b> <b>braking</b> antioxidant [1]. When nitrite oxide is bound to meat proteins it constitutes a reservoir of relatively stable radicals, which as antioxidants seem to protect the product during storage, a protection that is important for the oxidative stability and general quality of such meat products. In the absence of antioxidants, oxidation and rancidity becomes a problem for meat during heat-treatment and storage [1]. Nevertheless, nitrite is recognized as a potential cancer hazard, consequently it is of importance to develop alternatives to nitrite-curing meat [2]. Another factor is the general interest in foods produced without any additives such as nitrite, particular in relation to organic meat processing. Normally processed organic meat products are grey because no nitrite is added and are expected to be more vulnerable to oxidation and rancidity. Notably, lipid oxidation products are potentially toxic especially on long-term intake. Colours are one of the most important factors when consumers evaluate th...|$|R
5000|$|The Suzuki GSX650F is a sport touring {{motorcycle}} made by Suzuki. It {{is essentially}} an updated Bandit, filling the void of the retired Katana. The 656 cc liquid-cooled engine has [...] and a 12,500 rpm redline. The transmission is 6-speed with a <b>chain</b> drive. Anti-lock <b>brakes</b> were added as standard equipment in 2009 for Canada.|$|R
50|$|The pictured {{model has}} an {{enlarged}} lock-out or 'dead man' switch which, when released, also activates the <b>chain</b> <b>brake,</b> thus instantly halting the running chain {{as well as}} disengaging the throttle.|$|E
50|$|The <b>chain</b> <b>brake</b> {{was soon}} {{superseded}} by air operated or vacuum operated brakes. These brakes used hoses connecting all the wagons of a train, so the driver could apply or release the brakes {{with a single}} valve in the locomotive.|$|E
5000|$|As train loads, {{gradients}} and speeds increased, braking {{became a}} problem. In the late 19th century, significantly better continuous brakes started to appear. The earliest type of continuous brake was the <b>chain</b> <b>brake</b> [...] which used a chain, running {{the length of}} the train, to operate brakes on all vehicles simultaneously.|$|E
50|$|On January 31, 1918, {{the ship}} was {{launched}} {{in the presence of}} Crown Prince Gustav VI Adolf. Before launching, there was anxiety that as the ship slipped into the water it would hit {{the opposite side of the}} harbor basin, as the distance to this was considered short and the ship's weight was so great. To prevent a collision with the basin edge heavy chains were attached to the ship which would help arrest its momentum and at the edge of the basin were laid wooden logs that would help dampen a possible collision. The launching proved successful when the <b>chains</b> effectively <b>braked</b> the ship before reaching the quayside.|$|R
5000|$|This {{coupling}} {{is still}} the standard in European countries (except the former Soviet Union, where the SA-3 automatic coupler is used). Coupling is done by a worker who must climb between the cars. First he winds the turnbuckle to the loose position, and then he can hang the chain on the hook. After hanging the chain on the towing hook the turnbuckle handle is stowed on the idle hook to prevent damage to itself, the vehicle, or the brake pipes. Only shunting is permitted with a dangling <b>chain.</b> Disconnected <b>brake</b> pipes must be stowed on dummy connectors, to allow proper operation of the brakes. (The picture shows two coupled cars, with a single brake pipe.) ...|$|R
5000|$|The Eldorado was radically {{redesigned}} in 1967 {{to capitalize}} on the era's burgeoning personal luxury car market. Promoted as a [...] "personal" [...] Cadillac, it shared the E-body with the second-generation Buick Riviera and the Oldsmobile Toronado, which had been introduced the previous year. To enhance its distinctiveness, Cadillac adopted the Toronado's front-wheel drive Unified Powerplant Package, adapted to a standard Cadillac 429 V8 coupled to a Turbo-Hydramatic 425 automatic transmission. Based on the Turbo-Hydramatic 400, the THM425 placed the torque converter next to the planetary gearbox, which it drove through a metal, motorcycle-style roller <b>chain.</b> Disc <b>brakes</b> were optional, and new standard safety equipment included an energy absorbing steering column and generously padded instrument panel. The Unified Powerplant Package was later shared with the GMC Motorhome starting in 1972.|$|R
50|$|Many rear-handled {{chainsaws}} {{are used}} in a state, owing to poor maintenance, where there is some clutch drag and so the chain does move slowly at idle. For top-handled saws though, this is extremely dangerous and the clutch (and <b>chain</b> <b>brake)</b> on such a saw must always be functioning correctly.|$|E
50|$|The <b>chain</b> <b>brake</b> is principally {{operated}} by the top-hand guard being pushed forward to engage the brake, and pulled back to disengage. The spring-loaded action allows powerful braking under emergency conditions and can halt a chain under full power in {{a fraction of a}} second. Correspondingly, it may require considerable force to reset.|$|E
5000|$|In the top-handled saw, {{the rear}} handle and its {{operating}} controls are {{moved to the}} top of the saw. This gives a balance to the saw such that it can now be used one-handed. The front handle remains the same. The <b>chain</b> <b>brake</b> lever is usually separate, rather than being combined into the protective hand guard.|$|E
50|$|For the 1980 'T' range, Suzuki {{developed}} a much improved {{system that was}} widely praised for its intelligent design. You simply lay the machine on its left side, remove the axle, slip out a spacer and lift the wheel away from the cush-drive, without disturbing the <b>chain</b> or rear <b>brake.</b> Re-installation involved engaging the wheel hub to the brake drum/sprocket carrier, sliding in the one long spacer {{on the right side}} of the wheel, and then installing and tightening the axle.|$|R

50|$|On the way, she solved {{numerous}} problems. She {{had to find}} Ligroin, {{a solvent}} available only at dispensing chemists' shops, to use as fuel. Thus the still existing Stadt-Apotheke (Town Pharmacy) in Wiesloch, some kilometres south of Heidelberg, became the world's first filling station. A blacksmith had to help mend a <b>chain</b> in Bruchsal. <b>Brake</b> linings were replaced in Bauschlott/Neulingen north of Pforzheim. And Bertha Benz had to use a long, straight hatpin to clean a fuel pipe which had become blocked, and a garter to insulate a wire.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>chain</b> <b>brake,</b> {{such as the}} Heberlein brake, {{in which}} a chain was {{connected}} continuously along the train. When pulled tight it activated a friction clutch that used {{the rotation of the}} wheels to tighten a brake system at that point; this system has severe limitations in length of train capable of being handled, and of achieving good adjustment.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>chain</b> <b>brake</b> may be {{activated}} deliberately by the operator, or automatically {{by the force}} of a kickback event. In the former, the operator usually rotates his left wrist and knocks the top hand guard forward {{with the back of his}} hand, re-setting it by reaching forward with his fingers to pull the top hand guard backwards. In the case of a kickback event the operator's left hand may be violently dislodged from the handle and the top hand guard will be thrown onto his hand, forcing activation of the chainbrake. Husqvarna models also incorporate a link between the top handle and the <b>chain</b> <b>brake</b> trigger, applying the brake if the saw's bar is forced suddenly upwards. This is known as an [...] "inertia" [...] chainbrake and will allow activation of the chainbrake even if the operator's left hand is not removed from the handle.|$|E
50|$|The safety mitt {{ensures that}} if {{kickback}} occurs the operator's hand {{remains on the}} bar of the chainsaw. This means that the kickback is more easily controlled and the <b>chain</b> <b>brake</b> is more easily engaged.

40|$|Efficient and {{flexible}} production planning {{is necessary for}} the manufacturing industry to stay competitive in today’s global market. Shop floor lot-sizing and scheduling {{is one of the most}} challenging and rewarding subjects for the management. In this study, a two-stage stochastic programming model is proposed to solve a single-machine, multi-product shop floor lot-sizing and scheduling problem. Two sources of uncertainties are considered simultaneously: product demand from the market, and workforce efficiency, which is the major contribution of this study. The workforce efficiency affects the system productivity, and we propose different distributions to model its uncertainty with insufficient information. The model aims to determine optimal lot sizes and the production sequence that minimizes expected total system costs over the planning horizon, including setup, inventory, and production costs. A case study is performed on a supply <b>chain</b> producing <b>brake</b> equipment in the automotive industry. The numerical results illustrate the usefulness of the stochastic model under volatile environment, and the solution quality is analyzed...|$|R
