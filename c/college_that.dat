During this period, it offered six degree programs and educated more than 30,000 students, including more public school teachers than any other institution of higher learning in Texas during the same period; the college also gained a reputation for educating rural school teachers. In 1917, ETNC counted almost 2,000 currently enrolled students.|$|E
40|$|Environmental, {{health and}} safety {{management}} approaches and practices at small colleges are investigated. Awareness of environmental, {{health and safety}} initiatives among colleges is also investigated. Surveys were distributed to twelve <b>colleges</b> <b>that</b> accepted an invitation {{to participate in this}} study. The colleges were divided into two groups: an experimental group that consisted of small <b>colleges</b> <b>that</b> had made an envirpnmental claim or commitment and a control group that consisted of small <b>colleges</b> <b>that</b> were not known to have made such a claim or commitment. The results did not reveal {{a significant difference between the}} experimental and control group <b>colleges</b> <b>that</b> returned the survey. Responses indicated a lack of awareness of environmental, health and safety initiatives in academia, although the <b>colleges</b> <b>that</b> returned the survey did appear to be aware of basic regulatory requirements related to chemical use and hazardous waste management...|$|R

5|$|The College, {{like the}} Church of All Saints, is {{constructed}} of Kentish rag-stone in the Perpendicular style.

5|$|During this period, Hardy {{pushed the}} notion of {{granting}} the school college status. In 1921, the California legislature made the school a four-year teacher's school, which placed it under {{the management of the}} State Department of Education. On July 28, 1921, the San Diego Normal School became San Diego State Teachers College (usually shortened to San Diego State College or SDS). With this ranking, the college could now grant certificates and degrees. Prior to the school's conversion, it had graduated 1,500 teachers, educated many of the San Diego children at its training school, and helped to expand the economic and cultural development of the city. Also in 1921, the legislature moved San Diego Junior <b>College,</b> <b>that</b> was a part of San Diego High School, to the college campus due to crowding issues. Administrators moved the junior college believing it would only overlap the same material taught at the teacher's school. The junior college remained with the school until 1947, when it became independent.|$|E

5|$|List of United States {{business}} school rankings is a tabular listing {{of some of}} the {{business school}}s and their affiliated universities located in the United States that are included in {{one or more of the}} rankings of full-time Master of Business Administration programs. Rankings are typically published by magazines or websites. This list is not a comprehensive list of business schools in the United States. These rankings are a subset of college and university rankings. Business schools are university-level institutions generally affiliated with a university or <b>college</b> <b>that</b> produces students who attain business administration degrees. Most of the schools listed in the rankings below are accredited by the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business. Some of the publications shown here have related rankings for undergraduate, part-time and executive curricula. There is currently some controversy among faculty and administrators in American institutions of higher education regarding the request by the surveyors to have college presidents give their subjective opinion of other colleges because some of the methodologies are deemed misleading and a disservice. This has resulted in a movement surrounding the President's letter.|$|E
5|$|Paul Kagame {{was still}} in the United States {{at the time of the}} {{outbreak}} of war, attending the military training course in Fort Leavenworth. He and Rwigyema had been in frequent contact by telephone throughout his stay in Kansas, planning the final details for the October invasion. At the end of September, Kagame informed the <b>college</b> <b>that</b> he was leaving the course, and was settling his affairs ready to return to Africa as the invasion began. The college allowed him to leave with several textbooks, which he later used in planning tactics for the war. When Kagame learned of Rwigyema's death on 5 October, he departed immediately to take command of the RPF troops. He flew through London and Addis Ababa, eventually arriving at Entebbe Airport, where he was given safe passage by a friend in the Ugandan secret service; the police considered arresting him, but with Museveni out of the country, and no specific orders, they allowed him to pass. Ugandan associates drove Kagame to the border, and he crossed into Rwanda early on 15 October.|$|E
5|$|Slava {{was built}} by the Baltic Works at Saint Petersburg. She was laid down on 1 November 1902, {{launched}} on 29 August 1903, and completed in October 1905, too late {{to participate in the}} Russo-Japanese War. Together with the battleship , she helped to suppress the Sveaborg Rebellion in 1906. Slava was assigned to a training squadron for new officers fresh from the Naval <b>College</b> <b>that</b> was formed after the Rebellion as part of the post-Tsushima naval reforms. On one of her training cruises to the Mediterranean, her crewmen rescued survivors during the 1908 Messina earthquake and the ship took casualties to Naples for medical care. She had a serious boiler accident in August 1910 and was towed by Tsesarevich to Gibraltar for temporary repairs before sailing to Toulon for repairs that required nearly a year to complete. Upon her return to Kronstadt she was relieved of her training assignment and transferred to the Baltic Fleet.|$|E

5|$|The {{woodwork}} {{removed by}} Street was sold for a nominal sum, with {{a condition that}} {{it could only be}} used for a hall, chapel or library. Some pieces ended up in the library and chapel of Forest School in Walthamstow, east London (an institution that previously had no link to the college). Panels under the communion rail were also removed from the chapel, even though Street had reported to the <b>college</b> <b>that</b> these carvings were the only portion of the chapel woodwork with any real value, and had suggested at one point reusing them in connection with the ante-chapel screen and the adjoining seats. Some of the woodwork was transferred to St Edern's Church, Bodedern, in Anglesey, which had links with the college from 1648 until the Church in Wales was disestablished in 1920. Some of the panels may also have been re-used in the Fellows' Library (in the second quadrangle); other panelling at Bodedern came from the college, but not apparently from the chapel, and so may have been from a disused library gallery.|$|E
5|$|Until September 2009, The Isle of Sheppey was {{the only}} area in Kent to still have a middle school system.
