40|$|A set {{of three}} {{commercial}} copper nanoparticle based inkjet inks has been benchmarked {{with respect to their}} potential to form <b>conducting</b> <b>printed</b> structures for future applications in organic electronic devices. Significant differences were observed in terms of jetting properties, spreading behaviour and line formation on a number of relevant substrates. The inks' stabilities against oxidation were investigated, inkjet printed patterns were subjected to photonic flash sintering and their electrical properties characterized. As a result, optimized conditions for printing and post-deposition processing were determined. Photonic flash sintering, which is a roll-to-roll compatible manufacturing process, allowed a significant reduction in sintering time. Flash sintering was performed in the presence of air, thereby excluding the necessity for processing under inert atmosphere. One product was identified which showed satisfactory performances regarding all tested features: stable jet formation, well-defined definition of the printed structures and high electrical conductivity (20 % of the value of bulk Cu). The obtained results can be considered as a promising step towards the future application of Cu inks in organic electronic devices. cop. 2016 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|Laureate International Universities (LIU) embodies an {{emerging}} international phenomenon {{in which a}} multinational corporation (MNC) functions as a holding company that acquires and operates brick-and-mortar higher education institutions in a for-profit model; each individual portfolio institution granting degrees under its own name with any potential profits from each institutionâ€™s operations flowing to the holding company after local expenses are paid. Organizational institutions theory outlines the desire to legitimize and achieve success prompts organizations to seek legitimating scripts beyond mere market dynamics; those factors and operating conditions that allow organizations {{to carry out their}} activities without undue scrutiny by members of society. This study employs a comparative sociological methodology to analyze patterns in the way LIU has sought operational legitimacy as a new social object in two nations in Latin America, specifically Mexico and Ecuador. Forty interviews with professional, government, and alumni participants in Mexico and Ecuador were <b>conducted.</b> <b>Print</b> and digital archival material and statistical data from UNESCO, the World Bank, and the governing education divisions of Mexico and Ecuador were also analyzed. Striking similarities were discovered in LIUâ€™s legitimation patterns in the cases, despite the countries embracing different development policies over the study period between 2000 â€“ 2011. Three factors are vital to explaining LIUâ€™s legitimation in the cases analyzed: (1) acquiring and retaining state regulatory authority through purchasing existing local institutions; (2) advertising techniques that emphasize progressive norms and global connectivity, and (3) the transcendent global convergence of credentialing as a social norm which provides an uniquely conducive environment for this organizationâ€™s activities across varied geopolitical contexts.

On a smaller scale, coplanar waveguide transmission lines are also built into monolithic microwave integrated circuits. Conventional coplanar waveguide (CPW) consists of a single <b>conducting</b> track <b>printed</b> onto a dielectric substrate, together with a pair of return conductors, one to either side of the track. All three conductors are {{on the same side of}} the substrate, and hence are coplanar. The return conductors are separated from the central track by a small gap, which has an unvarying width along the length of the line. Away from the cental conductor, the return conductors usually extend to an indefinite but large distance, so that each is notionally a semi-infinite plane.|$|R

This conclusion was validated by the likelihood ratio test of two datasets collected under two different preconditioning methods Therefore, the Weibull regression modeling approach is an effective approach for accounting for the variation of experimental setting in the PWB lifetime prediction...|$|R
