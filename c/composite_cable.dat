Prestressing of {{suspension bridge}} allows to minimize cinematic displacements and makes possible not to use cantlage. The stress distribution by the length of the main load carrying cable of suspension bridge is non-uniform. Equalization of stresses by the length of the cable open possibility to increase degree of material usage.

Methodology. Given the results of previously conducted theoretical research of existing types of space roof structures find promising areas of improvement or creation of new structures that should be devoid of weaknesses and imperfections of analogs and they should have an economic effect through rational use of materials. Findings. Types of steel and concrete <b>composite</b> <b>cable</b> space frames and structural features of its elements are developed and considered. The steel and concrete <b>composite</b> <b>cable</b> space frame is a completely new kind of space structure system that has the original structural concept and it was designed to cover large-span industrial and public buildings. The basic elements of that structure system are modular element of the bottom chord and space steel and concrete composite module that consists of tubular rods and reinforced concrete slab. All modular elements are made in the factory. With bottom chord modular elements and space steel and concrete composite modules can be assembled three types of longitudinal elements. It is the beam element, arched element and hanging element. Also with the modules can be assembled various structure system and their combinations. Number of space steel and concrete composite modules and bottom chord modular elements, which is needed to collect steel and concrete <b>composite</b> <b>cable</b> space frames, is determined by calculation and optimal designing.

40|$|Recent {{advances}} in drilling technology have enabled wells reaching up to 10 km and beyond. Conventional intervention technology has limitations when {{reaching into the}} high deviated and long horizontal sections of these extended reach wells. This thesis presents {{a new type of}} material and technique that has been introduced to intervention applications the latest years - the composite intervention cable. The <b>composite</b> <b>cable</b> is lighter than the conventional steel wireline and has a higher strength, stiffness and electrical current transfer capability. One of the main benefits of the composite intervention cable is the high stiffness of the composite material, allowing a surface injector head to push the cable into the well and thereby eliminate the necessity of a well tractor. However, pushing the <b>composite</b> <b>cable</b> into the high deviated and long horizontal wells will cause helical buckling and lock-up. Axial oscillations and vibration can effectively reduce the friction forces that arise between the locked cable and the inner wall of the production pipe. Analyzing and testing the use of a vibration tool together with the composite intervention cable are therefore one of the main objectives of the thesis. To investigate the forces and stress involved in pushing the <b>composite</b> <b>cable</b> into a well and to further test the concept of using a vibration tool, a practical test model has been built. The results were used to address the advantages and limitations of the cable and the vibration tool and to utilize comparison with the simulation results. The test results show that the reach of the <b>composite</b> <b>cable</b> is limited by the friction forces that arise between the compressed cable and the inner wall of the production tubing. Therefore, lock-up should be set as the dimensional maximum axial force that could be applied to the cable. Further it is proven that axial vibration reduces the friction force between a locked cable and the inner wall of the production pipe. This permits a higher axial force to be transmitted through the system before lock-up again is reached. However, {{it is unlikely that the}} vibration tool alone is suffiecient to implement the use of a injector head to push the cable and PLT into the challenging highly deviated and horizointal wells. An advance in vibration technology and further development of well-tractors and injector heads could implement the composite intervention cable to help increase the recovery rate and further follow up latest advance in extended reach drilling, even into complex ultra-long wells. </p...|$|E
