5|$|Abir re-established their {{headquarters}} at Basankusu in 1893 and its {{position at the}} <b>confluence</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Maringa and Lopori allowed Abir to expand along the rivers and their tributaries, establishing new posts along the way. Progress was slow as the Free State's activities had made {{the population in the}} west hostile to colonisation and the east remained in the control of the Manyema and the Zanzibari slavers. The company's first post on the Lopori River had to be relocated because of threats from locals and rubber collection at Befori began only after a series of bloody conflicts between the villagers and Abir's men.|$|E
5|$|Downstream of <b>confluence</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Una River, the Sava is {{once again}} tracing an {{international}} border—between Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina. Its meandering course runs generally eastwards along Gradiška, and Slavonski Brod to Županja, where it turns south to Brčko. There, the river resumes its predominantly eastward course towards Sremska Rača and <b>confluence</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Drina River. The right bank of the Sava, in this segment of its course, belongs to Bosnia-Herzegovina (with Bosnia's all three administrative entities, Republika Srpska, Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Brčko District, having gateway to the river), while the opposite bank belongs to Croatia and its Sisak-Moslavina, Brod-Posavina and Vukovar-Srijem counties, except {{in the area of}} Jamena and further downstream—which belongs to Serbia and the province of Vojvodina. No cities in this segment of the course span the river as it represents an international frontier, but there are adjacent settlements located in two different countries, divided by the Sava. Those include Gradiška, Brod and Brčko in Bosnia-Herzegovina and Stara Gradiška, Slavonski Brod and Gunja in Croatia opposite them.|$|E

40|$|Injuries to {{the central}} venous system can result from {{penetrating}} trauma or iatrogenic causes. Injuries to major venous confluences can be particularly problematic, because the clavicle and sternum seriously limit exposure <b>of</b> <b>the</b> injury site. We report our institution's experience with central venous injuries <b>of</b> <b>the</b> subclavian-jugular and innominate-caval venous <b>confluences.</b> Significant injuries <b>of</b> <b>the</b> subclavian-jugular venous <b>confluence</b> frequently result from penetrating trauma, while injuries to the innominate-caval confluence are usually catheter-related. Median sternotomy provides adequate exposure <b>of</b> <b>the</b> innominate-caval <b>confluence,</b> while exposure <b>of</b> <b>the</b> subclavian-jugular venous <b>confluence</b> requires extension <b>of</b> <b>the</b> median sternotomy incision into the neck and resection <b>of</b> <b>the</b> clavicle.
