[...] The throngs that wished to view Banvard's {{panorama}} were so great when it was displayed in Boston and New York that railroads ran special excursions to accommodate them. In these two cities alone more than four hundred thousand people saw the exhibition. [...] "The river <b>comes</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> instead of my going to the river," [...] wrote Longfellow.

On this day, Vivekananda gave a brief speech {{representing}} India and Hinduism. He was initially nervous, bowed to Saraswati (the Hindu goddess of learning) and began his [...] with [...] "Sisters and brothers of America!". At these words, Vivekananda received a two-minute standing ovation from the crowd of seven thousand. According to Sailendra Nath Dhar, when silence was restored he began his address, greeting the youngest of the nations on behalf of [...] "the most ancient order of monks in the world, the Vedic order of sannyasins, a religion which has taught the world both tolerance, of and universal acceptance". Vivekananda quoted two illustrative passages from the [...] "Shiva mahimna stotram": [...] "As the different streams having their sources in different places all mingle their water in the sea, so, O Lord, the different paths which men take, through different tendencies, various though they appear, crooked or straight, all lead to Thee!"

[...] The 73men pledged to Hanna went to the State House together {{under the protection of}} Hanna adherents. [...] Croly related: [...] "Armed guards were stationed at every important point. [...] The State House was filled with desperate and determined men." [...] In the joint convention, held in the House Chamber, the journals of the two houses were read, detailing the tallies from the previous day. [...] The clerks of the two houses then called the rolls. The only votes to change were those which had gone to Warner and Wiley; both were switched to McKisson. [...] Representative Aquila Wiley was the last person to vote; with Hanna having already received the 73ballots he needed for election, Wiley maintained his vote for Lentz. [...] The final tally, both for the short and long term was Hanna73, McKisson70, and Lentz1. [...] Before the joint convention adjourned, Hanna appeared before it, thanking the legislators for his election. [...] He stated, [...] "I doubly thank you because under the circumstances it <b>comes</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> as an assurance of your confidence".|$|E

500|$|Garibay {{said that}} [...] "Judas" [...] sounded similar {{to many of}} Gaga's {{previous}} singles, like [...] "Poker Face", [...] "LoveGame", [...] "Bad Romance", and [...] "Alejandro". According to Jocelyn Vena of MTV, [...] "Judas" [...] finds Gaga in a similar territory music-wise but vocally she is in completely new territory; according to Popjustice, in the verses and pre-chorus, Gaga hurls herself into a decadent half-sung, half-rapped Jamaican Patois style." [...] Jason Gregory of Gigwise called the song a [...] "heavy slice of electro-house of the highest order". The song contains three hooks, and begins with Gaga singing the line [...] "Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, I'm in love with Judas", accompanied by building synths. This {{is followed by a}} thumping electronic beat, as Gaga sings, [...] "Judahhh/ Juda-a-ah/ Gaga". The utterance of these words are reminiscent of the opening verse in [...] "Bad Romance". Gaga's vocals are partially spoken, and at times have a Caribbean accent. The first verse follows as: [...] "When he <b>comes</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> I am ready/ I'll wash his feet with my hair if he needs/ Forgive him when his tongue lies through his brain/ Even after three times, he betrays me/ I'll bring him down, a king with no crown." [...] The tone lightens up on the song's chorus, which is influenced by '80s pop in its melody, as the beat picks up a bit and Gaga sings, [...] "I'm just a holy fool/ Oh, baby, it's so cruel/ But I'm still in love with Judas, baby." ...|$|E

2500|$|The film {{performance}} of [...] "Let It Be" [...] {{has never been}} officially released as an audio recording. The lyrics in the two versions differ {{a little in the}} last verse. The studio version has mother Mary <b>comes</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> … there will be an answer, whereas the film version has mother Mary <b>comes</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> … there will be no sorrow. In addition, McCartney's vocal performance is noticeably different in both versions: in the film version, it sounds rough in certain moments since he is not using anti-pop on his mic; there are also a couple of falsetto vocals performed by him (extending the vocal 'e' on the word 'be'), for instance in the 'let it be' line that precedes the second chorus. Finally, the instrumental progression featured on the middle of the song after the second chorus (that descends from F to C), which is played twice on all released studio versions, is played (or at least is shown being played) only once in the film.|$|E

2500|$|In late 2014, whilst {{promoting}} the film Into the Woods, Tracey Ullman revealed plans {{to write something}} new for television in the following year. [...] "Every five years it <b>comes</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> to sort of do what I do again and I throw a load of stuff at the wall, {{and some of it}} works and some of it obviously doesn't, but that's the nature of television. I love TV." [...] Her American Showtime series, Tracey Ullman's State of the Union ran for three seasons, concluding in 2010. It was a departure and a return of sorts. Instead of playing just original characters (a staple of Ullman's comedy) the show saw her imitating real people (celebrities, politicians, etc.) something she hadn't done since her early days at the BBC with Three of a Kind, the show that made her a household name in Great Britain.|$|E

In a 1994 interview, he stated: [...] "If someone <b>comes</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> and asks whether homosexuality is okay or not, I will ask 'What is your companion's opinion?' If you both agree, then I think I would say 'if two males or two females voluntarily agree to have mutual satisfaction without further implication of harming others, then it is okay'." [...] However, in his 1996 book Beyond Dogma, he states, [...] "A sexual act is deemed proper when the couples use the organs intended for sexual intercourse and nothing else... homosexuality, whether it is between men or between women, is not improper in itself.
