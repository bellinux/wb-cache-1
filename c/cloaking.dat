5|$|During StarCraft: Ghosts gameplay, the player's {{character}} Nova {{must use}} stealth and darkness to reach objectives and remain undetected. Nova has a <b>cloaking</b> device {{that allows for}} temporary concealment, but certain hostile non-player characters can overcome this with special devices and abilities. Nova is also equipped with thermal imaging goggles and a special EMP device for disabling electronic devices and vehicles. In addition to the focus on stealth elements, StarCraft: Ghost includes a complex combat system. Blizzard planned to include a small arsenal of weaponry with assault and sniper rifles, grenades, shotguns, and flamethrowers. Nova can engage in hand-to-hand combat and uses these skills to eliminate enemy threats quietly. If alerted, enemy characters will hunt for the player, set up traps, and fire blindly to nullify Nova's <b>cloaking</b> device.|$|E

40|$|Recently, {{invisible}} <b>cloaks</b> {{have attracted}} much attention due to their exciting property of invisibility, {{which are based on}} a solid theory of transformation optics and quasi-conformal mapping. Two kinds of <b>cloaks</b> have been proposed: free-space <b>cloaks,</b> which can render objects in free space invisible to incident radiation, and carpet <b>cloaks</b> (or ground <b>cloaks),</b> which can hide objects under the conducting ground. The first free-space and carpet <b>cloaks</b> were realized in the microwave frequencies using metamaterials. The free-space <b>cloak</b> was composed of resonant metamaterials, and hence had restriction of narrow bandwidth and high loss; the carpet <b>cloak</b> was made of non-resonant metamaterials, which have broad bandwidth and low loss. However, the carpet <b>cloak</b> has a severe restriction of large size compared to the <b>cloaked</b> object. The above restrictions become the bottlenecks to the real applications of free-space and carpet <b>cloaks.</b> Here we report the first experimental demonstration of broadband and low-loss directive free-space <b>cloak</b> and compact-sized carpet <b>cloak</b> based on a recent theoretical study. Both <b>cloaks</b> are realized using non-resonant metamaterials in the microwave frequency, and good invisibility properties have been observed in experiments. This approach represents a major step towards the real applications of invisibility <b>cloaks.</b> Comment: 14 pages, 4 figure...|$|R

Drax's forces capture Goodhead, but Bond escapes; he learns that the toxin comes from a rare orchid {{indigenous}} to the Amazon jungle. Bond travels the Amazon River while under attack from Drax's forces; he eventually finds Drax's base near Iguazu Falls. Captured by Jaws, Bond is taken to Drax and witnesses four Moonrakers lifting off. Drax explains that he stole the loaned shuttle because another in his fleet had developed a fault during assembly.

The novel Queen of Blades describes her facial features as being too strong to be classified as beautiful, but instead as striking and completely fitting for her personality. Kerrigan is rarely seen out of her armor, a form-fitting hostile environment suit specifically designed for Ghost operatives and equipped with a personal <b>cloaking</b> device, but when off-duty, she {{is described}} as wearing a soft work shirt, worn cotton pants with a dusty leather jacket, and high leather boots.

5|$|The player's ship is {{protected}} by a shield which decreases when attacked by enemies. If the shield is fully depleted, the player dies and must start the game again from a previous section of the fight without any collected power-ups. Nevertheless, the player can reclaim the missing power-ups from {{the ruins of the}} destroyed ship. Shield, energy, and ammunition suppliers are dispersed among the levels to help players increase their resources. The player can also collect equipment items which grant special powers. For example, the Quad Laser modifies the laser weapons to fire four shots at once instead of the standard two, while the <b>Cloaking</b> Device renders the player invisible to enemies for 30 seconds. During the game, the player may also deploy the Guide-Bot, an assistant that keeps track of the next objective and shows the player the way to a specific target.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a new {{electromagnetic}} (EM) GL double layered <b>cloak.</b> The GL double layered <b>cloak</b> is consist of two sphere annular layers, R_ 1 < r < R_ 2 and R_ 2 < r < R_ 3. Two type <b>cloak</b> materials are proposed and {{installed in the}} each layer, respectively. The outer layer <b>cloak</b> of the GL double layered <b>cloak</b> has the invisible function, the inner layer <b>cloak</b> has fully absorption function. The GL double layered metamaterials are weak degenerative and weak dispersive. When the source is located outside of the GL double layered <b>cloak,</b> the excited EM wave field propagation outside of the double layered <b>cloak</b> is as same as in free space and never be disturbed by the cloak; also, the exterior EM wave can not penetrate into the inner layer and concealment. When local sources are located inside of the GL double <b>cloaked</b> concealment with the normal EM materials, the excited EM wave is propagating under Maxwell equation governing, it is complete absorbed by the inner layer <b>cloak</b> of GL double <b>cloak</b> and never propagate to outside of the inner layer of the GL <b>cloak,</b> moreover, the EM wavefield in concealment never be disturbed by the <b>cloak.</b> The GL doubled layered <b>cloak</b> is a robust <b>cloak</b> and has complete and sufficient invisibility functions.

40|$|Recent {{research}} {{on the development of}} a thermal <b>cloak</b> has concentrated on engineering an inhomogeneous thermal conductivity and an approximate, homogeneous volumetric heat capacity. While the perfect <b>cloak</b> of inhomogeneous κ and inhomogeneous ρcp is known to be exact (no signals scattering and only mean values penetrating to the <b>cloak’s</b> interior), the sensitivity of diffusive <b>cloaks</b> to defects and approximations has not been analyzed. We analytically demonstrate that these approximate <b>cloaks</b> are detectable. Although they work as perfect <b>cloaks</b> in the steady-state, their transient (time-dependent) response is imperfect and a small amount of heat is scattered. This is sufficient to determine the presence of a <b>cloak</b> and any heat source it contains, but the material composition hidden within the <b>cloak</b> is not detectable in practice. To demonstrate the feasibility of this technique, we constructed a <b>cloak</b> with similar approximation and directly detected its presence using these transient temperature deviations outside the <b>cloak.</b> Due to limitations in the range of experimentally accessible volumetric specific heats, our detection scheme should allow us to find any realizable <b>cloak,</b> assuming a sufficiently large temperature difference...|$|R

5|$|Beginning in {{the summer}} of 1962 and {{continuing}} over the next few years, members of the PDP-1 programming community at MIT, including Russell and the other Hingham Institute members, began to spread out to other schools and employers such as Stanford University and DEC, and as they did they spread the game to other universities and institutions with a PDP-1 computer. As a result, Spacewar was perhaps the first video game to be available outside a single research institute. Over the next decade, programmers at these other institutions began coding their own variants, including features such as allowing more ships and players at once, replacing the hyperspace feature with a <b>cloaking</b> device, space mines, and even a first-person perspective version played on two screens that simulates each pilot's view out of the cockpit. Some of these Spacewar installations also replicated Kotok and Saunders' gamepad. According to a second-hand account heard by Russell while working at DEC, Spacewar was reportedly used as a smoke test by DEC technicians on new PDP-1 systems before shipping {{because it was the only}} available program that exercised every aspect of the hardware. Although the game was widespread for the era, it was still very limited in its direct reach: the PDP-1 was priced at US$120,000 and only 55 were ever sold, most without a monitor and many of the remainder to secure military locations or research labs with no free computer time, which prevented the original Spacewar from reaching beyond a narrow, academic audience. Though some later DEC models, such as the PDP-6, came with Spacewar pre-loaded, the audience for the game remained very limited; the PDP-6, for example, sold only 23 units.|$|E

25|$|While the single-tasking DOS had {{provisions}} for multi-sector reads and track blocking/deblocking, {{the operating system}} and the traditional PC hard disk architecture (only one outstanding input/output request {{at a time and}} no DMA transfers) originally did not contain mechanisms which could alleviate fragmentation by asynchronously prefetching next data while the application was processing the previous chunks. Such features became available later. Later DOS versions also provided built-in support for look-ahead sector buffering and came with dynamically loadable disk caching programs working on physical or logical sector level, often utilizing EMS or XMS memory and sometimes providing adaptive caching strategies or even run in protected mode through DPMS or <b>Cloaking</b> to increase performance by gaining direct access to the cached data in linear memory rather than through conventional DOS APIs.|$|E
25|$|As the Klingons {{are portrayed}} as a warrior culture, Klingon starships are usually {{depicted}} as warships, heavily armed {{with a variety of}} particle beam weaponry and antimatter warheads. Many Klingon ships also make use of <b>cloaking</b> technology to hide the vessel from view. The first Klingon ship design used in The Original Series, the D7-class battlecruiser, was designed by Matt Jefferies to evoke a predator's shape akin to that of a manta ray, providing a threatening and instantly recognizable form for viewers. The configuration of Jefferies' design featured a bulbous forward hull connected by a long boom to a wing-like main hull with the engine nacelles mounted on each wingtip. Later Klingon starships by other designers kept to this same overall configuration, although updated to reflect their respective time periods: Rick Sternbach's designs for The Next Generation and Deep Space Nine drew on elements of Starfleet ships features to reflect the alliance between the Federation and the Klingons, while John Eaves' designs for Enterprise incorporated more rugged and primitive construction to make the vessels appear consistent with the earlier time period.|$|E
25|$|Every race {{utilizes}} {{different strategies}} and weapons in combat. The Fallen possess <b>cloaking</b> and short-range teleportation technologies {{to increase their}} mobility. The Hive use superior numbers to overwhelm their opponents in close quarters while more elite units attack from a distance. The Vex utilize hard-light shields and teleport units of infantry into the battlefield en-masse. The Cabal rely on heavy armor, ballistic shields, and jump packs to combat players. The Taken, {{in addition to all}} the other races specialties, use high mobility and plenty of long-range attacks to out-maneuver the player. The Devil Splicers use multiple, unpredictable, lightning-like shots to surprise the player and hit them even while strafing. All of these races are hostile towards each other (with the exception of the Hive and the Taken), as they can often be observed attacking one another in-game for territorial dominance.

He has come to this location due to the wars between rebel and government forces, already having made several kills among the locals before beginning to hunt down a United States Army Special Forces group sent there to rescue presidential cabinet ministers kidnapped by guerrilla forces. The Predator dispatches the soldiers one by one with its array of weaponry until Major Dutch Schaeffer (Arnold Schwarzenegger) is the last one alive. Dutch eventually confronts the creature, covering himself in mud to hide his heat signature from the Predator's thermal imaging, and setting up numerous booby traps. Though he manages to disable the Predator's <b>cloaking</b> ability, the Predator manages to capture him, and then, in a display of Honour, discards his mask and electronic weaponry before challenging Dutch to a final duel. Physically outmatched, Dutch eventually sets off one of his traps, which crushes and mortally wounds the creature. After being asked what he is by Dutch, the Predator simply mimics his question and sets off his self-destruct device before laughing maniacally, though Dutch manages to escape the explosion.|$|E

It was notable for its inclusion of practical chemical operations alongside sulphur-mercury theory, and the unusual clarity {{with which they}} were described. By the end of the 13th century, alchemy had developed into a fairly structured system of belief. Adepts believed in the macrocosm-microcosm theories of Hermes, that is to say, they believed that processes that affect minerals and other substances could {{have an effect on the}} human body (for example, if one could learn the secret of purifying gold, one could use the technique to purify the human soul). They believed in the four elements and the four qualities as described above, and they had a strong tradition of <b>cloaking</b> their written ideas in a labyrinth of coded jargon set with traps to mislead the uninitiated. Finally, the alchemists practiced their art: they actively experimented with chemicals and made observations and theories about how the universe operated. Their entire philosophy revolved around their belief that man's soul was divided within himself after the fall of Adam. By purifying the two parts of man's soul, man could be reunited with God.|$|E
