5|$|As Melbourne was {{the only}} ship of her size (both in {{dimensions}} and ship's company) in the RAN, the carrier underwent a regular rotation of commanding officers to give them experience. Commanding officers were changed on average every fifteen months, with few remaining on board {{for more than two}} years. The majority of Melbournes commanders later reached flag rank. The carrier was also <b>called</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> perform underway replenishments and command and control functions.|$|E
5|$|As {{presiding}} {{officer of}} the Senate, Johnson was <b>called</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> cast a tie-breaking vote fourteen times, more than all of his predecessors save John Adams and John Calhoun. Despite the precedent set by some of his predecessors, Johnson never addressed the Senate {{on the occasion of}} a tie-breaking vote; he did once explain his vote via an article in the Kentucky Gazette.|$|E
5|$|Assuming {{command of}} United States Central Command in 1988, Schwarzkopf was <b>called</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> {{respond to the}} Invasion of Kuwait in 1990 {{by the forces of}} Iraq under Saddam Hussein. Initially tasked with {{defending}} Saudi Arabia from Iraqi aggression, Schwarzkopf's command eventually grew to an international force of over 750,000 troops. After diplomatic relations broke down, he planned and led Operation Desert Storm—an extended air campaign followed by a highly successful 100-hour ground offensive—which defeated the Iraqi Army and liberated Kuwait in early 1991. Schwarzkopf was presented with military honors.|$|E

The government had been <b>called</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> settle the dispute but had refused to get involved seeing the workers are not direct employees of provincial government. Within 5 days of taking office Dunderdale's government reached an agreement with the workers which they unanimously accepted ending the 377-day strike.|$|E
5|$|Riley {{became a}} bestselling author in the 1890s. His children's poems were {{compiled}} {{into a book}} and illustrated by Howard Chandler Christy. Titled the Rhymes of Childhood, the book was his most popular and sold millions of copies. As a poet, Riley achieved an uncommon level of fame during his own lifetime. He was honored with annual Riley Day celebrations around the United States and was regularly <b>called</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> perform readings at national civic events. He continued to write and hold occasional poetry readings until a stroke paralyzed his right arm in 1910.|$|E

5|$|The {{unit was}} once again {{designated}} as the 174th Infantry Brigade following a conversion and redesignation in March 1963. For the next 30 years, the brigade would continue as a Reserve unit in inactive status and would never be <b>called</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> participate in any conflicts. In 1997, the brigade was withdrawn from the Reserve and activated in the Regular Army at Fort Drum, New York, before being inactivated two years later.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the prior}} {{introduction}} of the Princess Royal class had provided the London Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS) with more powerful locomotives to be used on the main line between London Euston and Glasgow Central, {{the board of directors}} were persuaded in 1936 that more such locomotives would be needed, particularly as they were being asked to approve the introduction of a new non-stop service between those cities, designated the Coronation Scot. Initially, the Chief Mechanical Engineer, William Stanier, planned to build five more Princess Royals, but the Chief Technical Assistant and Chief Draughtsman at the LMS Derby Works, Tom Coleman, argued that it would be preferable to design a new class of locomotive that was more powerful, more reliable and easier to maintain. Stanier was convinced and the drawing office commenced designing the new class. When Stanier was <b>called</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> perform an assignment in India, Coleman became responsible for most of the detailed design in his absence.|$|E

5|$|During the {{criminal}} trial, {{all the major}} figures in the case were <b>called</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> give evidence. Le Gris and Carrouges began proceedings and were followed by a heavily pregnant Marguerite {{and at least one}} of her maidservants as well as Adam Louvel. As people of low birth, Louvel and the servants were all subject to torture to test the veracity of their testimony but none gave evidence against Le Gris and the case continued through the summer and into September without conclusion. Le Gris' case involved several strategies; he attempted to discredit his opponent by telling of Carrouges' infamous temper and describing the case against him as a jealous invention from a man who had threatened to beat his wife if she did not corroborate his accusations. Le Gris then provided alibis for the entire week in question, establishing his whereabouts in testimony backed up by several other squires of the court of Count Pierre. Finally he attempted to demonstrate in court that it was physically impossible for him to have ridden in winter from Argentan to Capomesnil, where the crime supposedly took place, in a single day, a round trip of approximately 50miles (80km).|$|E
5|$|In 1968, Willis {{accepted}} {{an invitation to}} join Middlesex and Surrey Young Cricketers on tour in Pakistan, and used this opportunity to further hone his skills. Upon his return he made early appearances for Surrey's Second XI, his first being on 26 August against Worcestershire's Seconds. Willis, 19 years of age, took one wicket for 48 runs in the first innings, and bowled four wicketless overs in the second. He was not <b>called</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> bat at all. Two days later, he faced Glamorgan and took three wickets. He played several further Second XI matches through May and June 1969, before his first-class debut on 6 August. Scotland was touring England that season and had already beaten Warwickshire. Willis took three wickets for 13 runs from 13 overs in his first innings, and two for 37 in his second, to help Surrey to victory by an innings and 97 runs. Willis went on to take 22 first-class wickets that season at 17.22 from six matches, placing him 15th in the national averages for that season's County Championship. Surrey came third in the competition that year. Willis also played two List-A games, but took only one wicket at 52.00.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, {{across the}} river in the American AO the US 1/503rd Battalion had {{uncovered}} a large Viet Cong bunker system and became involved in fierce fighting that had included desperate hand-to-hand combat, with both sides resorting to using bayonets. Throughout the morning the Australians had heard the increasing crescendo of firing as the battle raged; however, as neither they nor the US 2/503rd Battalion had been <b>called</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> reinforce the US 1/503rd Battalion they had pressed on. The American paratroopers had contacted a well-equipped Viet Cong Main Force regiment, complete with khaki uniforms, steel helmets and Soviet automatic weaponry and small arms. The fighting across the Song Dong Nai continued into the afternoon, before subsiding into sporadic sniper and small arms fire in the later afternoon and early evening. During the fighting, Specialist Lawrence Joel—a medic—distinguished himself tending to his wounded comrades while under heavy fire. He was subsequently awarded the Medal of Honor.|$|E

5|$|Rescue {{operations}} {{took over}} 24hours; the pace was {{hampered by the}} decision to remove many of the logs by hand for fear that using heavy equipment to remove them would cause further collapses, resulting in further injuries to those still trapped. Students, including the entire Texas A football team and {{many members of the}} university's Corps of Cadets, rushed to the site to assist rescue workers with the manual removal of the logs. The Texas A civil engineering department was also <b>called</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> examine the site and help the workers determine the order in which the logs could be safely removed, and, {{at the request of the}} Texas Forest Service, Steely Lumber Company in Huntsville, Texas, sent log-moving equipment and operators. John Comstock was the last living person to be removed from the stack. He spent months in the hospital following amputation of his left leg and partial paralysis of his right side. Comstock returned to A in 2001 to finish his degree.|$|E
5|$|The Mew Mews {{are young}} {{girls who have}} been {{injected}} with the genes of endangered species, giving them the ability to transform into Mew Mews. The project chose endangered species because they felt that these species would have the strongest desire to preserve their kind. These superheroes are biological weapons tasked with fighting the chimera anima, the monsters created when alien parasites infect a living host. They are later <b>called</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> fight the aliens that were {{the source of the}} Chimera Anima invasion. The creation of the first five Mew Mews occurred accidentally. The head of the project, Ryô Shirogane, originally intended to inject a Chimera Anima with the endangered animal genes directly to see if that would reverse the effects of the infection. Instead, it was accidentally injected into five different girls when the earthquake happened.|$|E

5|$|To {{allow the}} lord to {{concentrate}} on his duties regarding administration, he had a household of servants {{to take care of}} chores such as providing food. The household was run by a chamberlain, while a treasurer took care of the estate's written records. Royal households took essentially the same form as baronial households, although on a much larger scale and the positions were more prestigious. An important role of the household servants was the preparation of food; the castle kitchens would have been a busy place when the castle was occupied, <b>called</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> provide large meals. Without the presence of a lord's household, usually because he was staying elsewhere, a castle would have been a quiet place with few residents, focused on maintaining the castle.|$|E

Max heads to a restaurant owned by Lem and rescues him from his old foe Vinnie Gognitti; Lem claims that Gognitti is trying to monopolize the black market gun trade and sees Lem as a threat. After evading an attack by the Cleaners in his Apartment, Max tracks Mona to an abandoned funhouse and learns that the Cleaners are after anyone who knows about the secretive Inner Circle. While attempting to track down a contact, Mona is arrested because of her crimes and is taken in to the police station, despite Max's protests.|$|E
5|$|Walton's last {{work of the}} 1940s was {{his music}} for Olivier's film of Hamlet (1948). After that, he focused his attentions on his opera Troilus and Cressida. On {{the advice of the}} BBC, he invited Christopher Hassall to write the libretto. This did not help Walton's {{relations}} with the Sitwells, each of whom thought he or she should have been asked to be his librettist. Work continued slowly over the next few years, with many breaks while Walton turned to other things. In 1950 he and Heifetz recorded the Violin Concerto for EMI. In 1951 Walton was knighted. In the same year, he prepared an authorised version of Façade, which had undergone many revisions since its premiere. In 1953, following the accession of Elizabeth II he was again <b>called</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> write a coronation march, Orb and Sceptre; he was also commissioned to write a choral setting of the Te Deum for the occasion.|$|E
