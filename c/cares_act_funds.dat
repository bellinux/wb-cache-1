The Act uses formulas based upon a grantee's number of AIDS cases to distribute funds to eligible metropolitan areas (EMA), states, and territories.

5000|$|The {{deadlock}} {{centered on}} the Continuing Appropriations Resolution, 2014, which {{was passed by the}} House of Representatives on September 20, 2013. The Senate stripped the bill of the measures related to the Affordable <b>Care</b> <b>Act,</b> and passed it in revised form on September 27, 2013. The House reinstated the Senate-removed measures, and passed it again {{in the early morning hours}} on September 29.

The health insurance exchanges created by the Affordable <b>Care</b> <b>Act</b> launched as scheduled on October 1.
