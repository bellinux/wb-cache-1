40|$|The {{first data}} on {{chemical}} composition of nonreef-building non-zooxanthellate deep-sea corals {{presented in this}} publication allow us to identify following tendencies manifested in the biomineralization process. Comparison of concentration levels of some chemical elements in scleractinian corals and ambient ocean waters suggests that corals do not accumulate K {{in the process of}} biomineralization and weakly accumulate Mg, whereas Ca, Sr, Si, Al, Ti, Mn, Zn, Cu, Cd, Pb, and Fe are concentrated in skeletons of corals with enrichment coefficients of 10 ** 3 to 10 ** 7. Correlations between components contained in the skeletons of scleractinian corals suggest that the source of Al, Si, Fe, and Ti in them is the <b>clayey</b> <b>constituent</b> of bottom sediments and zooplankton, while trace elements are likely accumulated via bioassimilation from seawater. Such elements as Mn, Sr, Pb, and Cd can structurally substitute Ca in calcite and aragonite. Variations in concentrations of the elements in coral skeletons depending on their habitat depths are fairly significant. As could be expected Ca and Mg concentrations are prone to decrease with depth (R = - 0. 55 and - 0. 51, respectively), which can possibly be caused by partial dissolution of carbonate skeletons with increasing depth, whereas the Sr/Ca ratio does not depend on depth...|$|E
40|$|This {{preliminary}} note considers 19 {{profiles of}} Sardinian soils developed on hard limestone, dolomitic limestone and dolomite of different age and territorial condition, {{reporting on the}} description of the profiles and their physical, chemical and mineralogical characteristics. The results indicate that the soils examined belong to xeric subgroups of three orders: Entisols, Inceptisols and Alfisols. All the profiles show a clay texture and the <b>clayey</b> <b>constituents</b> are related to the degree of soil evolution...|$|R
40|$|The {{classification}} {{properties and}} composition of a lateritic soil, developed on Tertiary basalt in coastal south-east Queensland, Australia, have been investigated. X-ray diffraction analyses showed that the soil comprised kaolinite, quartz, gibbsite and haematite. Chemical analyses showed there was no amorphous material present in the soil. The results of electron scanning microscopy revealed that sesquioxides coat and bind the <b>clayey</b> <b>constituents</b> of the lateritic soil into porous micro-aggregations. Analyses of the grain size distribution and other physical properties indicated that the soil was not homogeneous within the laterite zone. Atterberg limit test results for the soil plotted anomalously below the Casagrande A-line. There were {{significant differences between the}} values of plasticity index determined for air-dried compared with oven-dried samples. High values for both the liquid and plastic limits were due to the water retention capacity of porous micro-aggregations in the soil. This was correlated with the degree of laterisation, which depends on the ambient climate, topography and vegetation of the are...|$|R
40|$|The {{results of}} a {{comprehensive}} experimental program focused {{on the study of}} progressive degradation processes on a low permeability argillaceous rock induced by hydraulic cycles is presented in the paper. Relative humidity cycles were applied with vapour transfer technique, and bender elements were used to evaluate the evolution of shear stiffness during the application of hydraulic paths. The characterisation of the material included the determination of the water retention properties (water retention curve), as well as the pore size distribution using mercury intrusion porosimetry, complemented with SEM micrographs and elemental analysis using X-ray spectroscopy to characterise micro-structural features and detect <b>clayey</b> and non-clayey <b>constituents.</b> Results showed cumulative and irreversible swelling of the samples with the application of relative humidity cycles. Regarding shear stiffness, an important reduction (around 80...|$|R
