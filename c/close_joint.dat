Materials and methods. The experiments were carried out on 16 chinchilla rabbits. A new material under study was developed by <b>Close</b> <b>Joint</b> Stock Company “Proteinsynthesis” (Moscow) to replace bone defects.

The defect was made in iliac bone crest. Results. A new biocomposite material based on non-demineralized bone collagen saturated with vascular endothelial growth factor for bone defect replacement was stated to have osteoconductive and osteoinductive properties and potentiate neoangiogenesis. The material is able to induce bone tissue regeneration more effectively compared to non-modified collagen matrix mainly due to circulatory bed formation in regeneration area...|$|E
40|$|In bedded {{sedimentary}} or mechanically anisotropic rocks, joints {{often occur}} in laterally persistent, parallel sets with distinctive spacing attributes. Three of those attributes include a positively skewed distribution of joint spacings, {{a positive correlation}} between median spacing and mechanical layer thickness, and the tendency for rocks to appear saturated with joints and to show a ratio of layer thickness to median joint spacing near one. We identify total applied strain, mechanical interaction, joint propagation velocity, and flaws as key variables in the progressive jointing process, and we use a one-dimensional model of mechanically interacting joints to characterize the specific influence on joint spacing, of the number, sizes, and size distributions of flaws in rock. For a given flaw size distribution, the mode flaw size has no effect on spacing distribution shape, median spacing, or saturation. Layers with fewer flaws approach saturation more slowly and reach it with fewer joints and larger median joint spacing. The joint spacing distributions in these layers have variance and skewness that may be 1 – 3 orders of magnitude larger than in layers with greater numbers of flaws. Flaw size range affects the rate at which a jointing layer approaches saturation but not the number of joints at saturation. Resulting spacing distributions are similar, although narrow flaw size ranges tend to promote greater numbers of closely spaced joints. The skewness of a flaw size distribution affects the rate at which layers approach saturation, as well as the shape of the resulting joint spacing distribution at saturation. Negatively skewed flaw size distributions promote <b>close</b> <b>joint</b> spacing and create spacing distributions with greater variance and skewness...|$|E
40|$|This article {{provides}} an in-depth study of Incapacity Benefit (IB) claims {{in a major}} city and of the factors behind their changing level. It relates to the regime prior {{to the introduction of}} the Employment and Support Allowance (ESA) in 2008. Glasgow has had one of the highest levels of IB in Britain with a peak of almost one fifth of the working age population on IB or Severe Disablement Allowance (SDA). However, over the past decade the number of IB claimants in Glasgow, as in other high claiming areas, has fallen at a faster rate than elsewhere, and Glasgow now has twice the national proportion of working-age people on IB/SDA rather than its peak of three times. The rise in IB in Glasgow can be attributed primarily to deindustrialisation; between 1971 and 1991, over 100, 000 manufacturing jobs were lost in the city. Policy response was belated. Lack of local statistics on IB led to a lengthy delay in official recognition of the scale of the issue, and targeted programmes to divert or return IB claimants to work did not begin on any scale until around 2004. Evidence presented in the article suggests that the reduction in claims, which has mainly occurred since about 2003, has been due more to a strengthening labour market than to national policy changes or local programmes. This gives strong support to the view that excess IB claims are a form of disguised unemployment. Further detailed evaluation of ongoing programmes is required to develop the evidence base for this complex area. However, the study casts some doubt on the need for the post- 2006 round of IB reforms in high-claim areas, since rapid {{decline in the number of}} claimants was already occurring in these areas. The article also indicates the importance of <b>close</b> <b>joint</b> working between national and local agencies, and further development of local level statistics on IB claimants...|$|E

40|$|The {{aim of the}} {{investigation}} is to study the pathogenesis of tumor development when interacting with mesenchymal stem cells transfected by a gene of red fluorescent protein using the method of vital bioimaging. Materials and Methods. There were used adipose-derived adult stem (ADAS) cells taken from human adipose tissue. ADAS were transfected by a gene of red fluorescent protein Turbo FP 635 (<b>Close</b> <b>Joint</b> Stock Company “Eurogene”, Russia) by the method of lentiviral transfection. Tumors were implanted to nude mice by subcutaneous injection of Hela Kyoto tumor cells (cervical cancer). ADAS labeled by fluorescent protein were injected to animals {{at different stages of}} carcinogenesis (0 and 8 days after tumor culture injection) by various ways: locally — in the tumor node forming region, and systemically — intravenously, in the tail vein. There were formed the following groups of animals: 1 st group — an early stage of carcinogenesis (immediately after the injection) and systemic injection of ADAS; 2 nd group — an early stage of carcinogenesis and local injection of ADAS; 3 rd group — the stage of developed tumor (8 days) and systemic injection of ADAS. The control group consisted of the animals with induced tumor without stem cells injection. Results. ADAS isolated and characterized with the help of immunocytochemical analysis had the phenotype of mesenchymal stem cells (there were expressed CD 105, CD 49 d, STRO- 1) and were differentiated in vitro in adipogenic, osteogenic, and chondrogenic approaches in induction media cultivation. The efficiency of transfection of ADAS by red fluorescent protein Turbo FP 635 was 75 %. The stem cells under study — ADAS labeled by red fluorescent protein Turbo FP 635 in systemic injection were shown to be able to migrate in spleen, and in systemic and local injection — in bone marrow, lungs, and recipient’s tumor tissues. The methods of fluorescent bioimaging and laser scanning microscopy can be used to study the interaction between the tumor and mesenchymal stem cells. They effectively complement each other in gaining general knowledge of the distribution of migratory fluorescent cells...|$|E

40|$|There are {{considerable}} {{difficulties in}} describing the properties of reinforced concrete materials and their interaction. It is therefore necessary to calibrate the mathematical model by accurate testing of laboratory specimens. It can be shown that momentcurvature relationship varies {{along the length of}} a member and at beam-column joints. This behaviour depends critically on the geometry of the joint, reinforcement details and the stress-strain characteristics of concrete and steel. Tests have been carried out on model reinforced concrete portal frames and independent specimens making up the frame to predict their non-linear behaviour. The stiffness of the joint {{plays an important role in}} the response of the complete frame structure. The behaviour of the corner joints is of particular interest because both the strength and ductility differs for opening and <b>closing</b> <b>joints.</b> The loss of stiffness at joints has a significant effect on the inelastic deformations. The non-linear finite element (FE) program developed takes into account the loss of stiffness at joints and the falling branch behaviour of the material stress-strain relationships. Constant, linear, and parabolic variation in flexural rigidity (EI) and axial rigidity (EA) are taken into consideration along the element length. The combined effect of material and geometric non-linearity is considered. The FE program may use either calculated momentcurvature relationship of different elements or the experimental data obtained from tests. The results show good agreement between the theoretical and experimental beam moment-curvature relationships. Horizontally loaded frame analysis, which involves opening and <b>closing</b> <b>joints,</b> shows that ignoring the joint effect over-estimates the strength. In the case of vertically loaded frames, which involves two <b>closing</b> <b>joints,</b> ignoring the joint effects had little or no influence. The results show good agreement between the theoretical and experimental frame force-displacement relationships throughout the loading range providing the change of stiffness at joints is taken into account for horizontally loaded frames...|$|R
