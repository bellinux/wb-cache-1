5|$|On House's insistence, {{neurologist}} Dr. Eric Foreman (Omar Epps) and Cameron {{break into}} Adler's house {{to find anything}} that might account for Adler's symptoms. They find an opened package of non-kosher ham in Adler's kitchen. House concludes that Adler is suffering from <b>cysticercosis</b> due to eating undercooked pork; when the tapeworm inside of her reproduced, its larvae were absorbed into her blood stream, infesting her brain. Adler, wishing to die with dignity, refuses to accept more treatments unless {{there is evidence that}} the diagnosis is correct, but House attempts to persuade her otherwise. During the conversation, Adler asks for the cause of the limp in House's right leg. House reveals he had an infarction in his thigh muscles that led to muscle death, which could have been avoided if his doctor had made the correct diagnosis. House is ready to dismiss the case when Chase provides an idea for noninvasive evidence of Adler's tapeworm infection; by taking an X-ray of her leg, House proves that Adler is infested with tapeworms and her condition is treatable. After seeing the evidence, Adler agrees to take her medication to kill the tapeworms. A couple of days later, Adler is visited by all 16 of her kindergarten children and their other teacher, whom she welcomes with open arms.|$|E
25|$|Central nervous system: Frequently {{occurring}} {{side effects}} are dizziness, headache, and malaise. Drowsiness, somnolence, fatigue, and vertigo {{have also been}} seen. Almost all patients with cerebral <b>cysticercosis</b> experience CNS side effects related to the cell-death of the parasites (headache, worsening of pre-existing neurological problems, seizures, arachnoiditis, and meningism). These side effects may be life-threatening and can be reduced by coadministration of corticosteroids. It is strongly recommended that all patients with cerebral <b>cysticercosis</b> are hospitalized during treatment.|$|E

25|$|Praziquantel, {{sold under}} the brandname Biltricide among others, is a {{medication}} {{used to treat}} a number of types of parasitic worm infections. Specifically it is used for schistosomiasis, clonorchiasis, opisthorchiasis, tapeworm infections, <b>cysticercosis,</b> hydatid disease, and other fluke infections. It {{should not be used}} for worm infections of the eye. It is taken by mouth.|$|E
25|$|Discrete {{localized}} enlargements {{of normal}} structures (ureters, blood vessels, intrahepatic or extrahepatic biliary ducts, pulmonary inclusions, or gastrointestinal duplications) due to outflow obstructions or narrowings, or abnormal connections, may also present as a tumor. Examples are arteriovenous fistulae or aneurysms (with or without thrombosis), biliary fistulae or aneurysms, sclerosing cholangitis, <b>cysticercosis</b> or hydatid cysts, intestinal duplications, and pulmonary inclusions as seen with cystic fibrosis. It {{can be dangerous}} to biopsy a number of types of tumor in which the leakage of their contents would potentially be catastrophic. When such types of tumors are encountered, diagnostic modalities such as ultrasound, CT scans, MRI, angiograms, and nuclear medicine scans are employed prior to (or during) biopsy or surgical exploration/excision {{in an attempt to}} avoid such severe complications.|$|E

2500|$|Pigs can harbour a {{range of}} parasites and {{diseases}} that can be transmitted to humans. These include trichinosis, Taenia solium, <b>cysticercosis,</b> and brucellosis. Pigs are also known to host large concentrations of parasitic ascarid worms in their digestive tract. According to the USDA fact sheet modern pork can be enjoyed cooked rare at 145°F (63°C) with pink in the middle. Today trichinellosis infections from eating undercooked pork are rare in more technologically developed countries due to refrigeration, health laws, and public awareness. Some religious groups have dietary laws that make pork an [...] "unclean" [...] meat, and adherents sometimes interpret these health issues as validation of their views.|$|E
50|$|In pigs, the {{cysticercus}} {{can produce}} <b>cysticercosis.</b> Cysts develop in liver and lungs. (T. saginata {{does not cause}} <b>cysticercosis.)</b> Due to its biological similarity to T. solium, which is the major cause of neurocysticercosis, T. asiatica may also cause <b>cysticercosis.</b>|$|E
50|$|In US during 1990-2002, 221 <b>cysticercosis</b> {{deaths were}} identified. Mortality rates were highest for Latinos and men. The mean {{age at death}} was 40.5 years (range 2-88). Most patients, 84.6%, were foreign born, and 62% had emigrated from Mexico. The 33 US-born persons who died of <b>cysticercosis</b> {{represented}} 15% of all cysticercosis-related deaths. The <b>cysticercosis</b> mortality rate was highest in California, which accounted for 60% of all <b>cysticercosis</b> deaths.|$|E
50|$|<b>Cysticercosis</b> was {{described}} by Johannes Udalric Rumler in 1555; however, the connection between tapeworms and <b>cysticercosis</b> had not been recognized at that time. Around 1850, Friedrich Küchenmeister fed pork containing cysticerci of T. solium to humans awaiting execution in a prison, and after they had been executed, he recovered the developing and adult tapeworms in their intestines. By {{the middle of the}} 19th century, it was established that <b>cysticercosis</b> was caused by the ingestion of the eggs of T. solium.|$|E

50|$|A type of {{taeniasis}} called <b>cysticercosis</b> {{is caused}} by accidental infection with the eggs of T. solium from contaminated food and water.

A specific form of <b>cysticercosis</b> called neurocysticercosis {{is said to be the}} most common infection of the central nervous system.|$|E
50|$|In Latin America, an {{estimated}} 75 million persons live in endemic areas and 400,000 people have symptomatic disease. Some {{studies suggest that}} the prevalence of <b>cysticercosis</b> in Mexico is between 3.1 and 3.9 percent. Other studies have found the seroprevalence in areas of Guatemala, Bolivia, and Peru as high as 20 percent in humans, and 37 percent in pigs. In Ethiopia, Kenya and the Democratic Republic of Congo around 10% of the population is infected, in Madagascar 16%. The distribution of <b>cysticercosis</b> coincides with the distribution of T. solium. <b>Cysticercosis</b> is {{the most common cause of}} symptomatic epilepsy worldwide.|$|E

50|$|The {{traditional}} {{method of}} demonstrating either tapeworm eggs or proglottids in stool samples diagnoses only taeniasis, carriage of the tapeworm {{stage of the}} life cycle. Only {{a small minority of}} patients with <b>cysticercosis</b> will harbor a tapeworm, rendering stool studies ineffective for diagnosis. Ophthalmic <b>cysticercosis</b> can be diagnosed by visualizing parasite in eye by fundoscopy.|$|E
5000|$|The first patient on the {{television}} show House (in the pilot episode) had <b>cysticercosis.</b>|$|E
50|$|In pigs {{cysticercus}} has {{a tendency}} to produce cyticercosis. Cysts are formed in vital organs such as liver and lungs. In contrast T. saginata does not cause <b>cysticercosis.</b> As its life cycle and mode of development are very similar to those of Taenia solium, which is the major cause of neurocysticercosis, a possibility that T. asiatica can cause <b>cysticercosis</b> in humans is highly conjectured.|$|E
50|$|<b>Cysticercosis</b> is {{considered}} as “tools-ready disease” according to WHO. International Task Force for Disease Eradication in 1992 reported that <b>cysticercosis</b> is potentially eradicable. It is feasible {{because there are}} no animal reservoirs besides humans and pigs. The only source of Taenia solium infection for pigs is from humans, a definite host. Theoretically, breaking the life cycle seems easy by doing intervention strategies from various stages in the life cycle.|$|E
5000|$|The {{epidemiology}} of Taenia solium <b>cysticercosis</b> {{is solely}} associated with {{cultural values and}} poor sanitation and it is highly endemic in Sub Saharan Africa, Latin America, Asia, and Portugal (in Europe). [...] Infection by Taenia solium <b>cysticercosis,</b> the pork tapeworm larvae in human, spares no ethnic group. <b>Cysticercosis</b> in the United States, which commonly presents {{in the form of}} neurocysticercosis, has been classified as a [...] "neglected tropical disease", which commonly affects the poor and homeless. Neurocysticercosis most commonly involves the cerebral cortex followed by the cerebellum. The pituitary gland is very rarely involved in neurocysticercosis. The cysts may rarely coalesce and form a tree-like pattern which is known as racemose neurocysticercosis, which when involving the pituitary gland may result in multiple pituitary hormone deficiency.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Cysticercosis</b> is {{the most}} common {{preventable}} cause of epilepsy in the developing world. <b>Cysticercosis</b> occurs after ingestion of contaminated food, water, or soil. [...] Cysts and lesions can cause headaches, blindness, seizures, hydrocephalus, meningitis, and dementia. Neurocystocercosis, or the parasitic infection of the nervous system, can be fatal. Taeniasis is not fatal. [...] It is usually contracted after eating undercooked contaminated pork. Taeniasis has mild symptoms, including abdominal pain, nausea, diarrhea, or constipation.|$|E

50|$|T. solium {{is found}} worldwide, but {{is more common}} in {{cosmopolitan}} areas. Because pigs are intermediate hosts of the parasite, completion of the life cycle occurs in regions where humans live in close contact with pigs and eat undercooked pork. Therefore, high prevalences are reported in Mexico, Latin America, West Africa, Russia, India, Pakistan, Manchuria, and Southeast Asia. In Europe it is most widespread among Slavic countries. <b>Cysticercosis</b> is often seen in areas where poor hygiene allows for contamination of food, soil, or water supplies. Prevalence rates in the United States have shown immigrants from Mexico, Central and South America, and Southeast Asia account for most of the domestic cases of <b>cysticercosis.</b> Taeniasis and <b>cysticercosis</b> are very rare in predominantly Muslim countries, as Islam forbids the consumption of pork. Human <b>cysticercosis</b> is acquired by ingesting T. solium eggs shed in the feces of a human tapeworm carrier by gravid proglottids, so can occur in populations that neither eat pork nor share environments with pigs, although the completion of the life cycle can occur only where humans live in close contact with pigs and eat pork.|$|E
50|$|Surgical removal is {{mandatory}} {{for individuals with}} intraoscular cysts. Oscular <b>cysticercosis</b> can be effectively treated with Anthelminthics such as Albendazole or Praziquantel, oral corticosteroids.|$|E
50|$|The World Health Organization's 2010 report {{dedicated}} to neglected tropical diseases offers an expanded list including dengue, rabies, yaws, <b>cysticercosis,</b> echinococcosis, and foodborne trematode infections.|$|E
5000|$|In {{cases of}} human <b>cysticercosis,</b> {{diagnosis}} is a sensitive problem and requires biopsy of the infected tissue or sophisticated instruments. Taenia solium eggs and proglottids found in feces, ELISA, or {{polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis}} diagnose only taeniasis and not <b>cysticercosis.</b> Radiological tests, such as X-ray, CT scans which demonstrate [...] "ring-enhancing brain lesions", and MRIs, {{can also be used}} to detect diseases. X-rays are used to identify calcified larvae in the subcutaneous and muscle tissues, and CT scans and MRIs are used to find lesions in the brain.|$|E
50|$|Prevalence {{rates in}} the United States have shown {{immigrants}} from Mexico, Central and South America, and Southeast Asia account {{for most of the}} domestic cases of <b>cysticercosis.</b>|$|E
50|$|Positive {{test results}} from a serum {{enzyme-linked}} immunosorbent assay ELISA for anticysticercal antibodies help confirm the diagnosis; however, negative test results do not exclude <b>cysticercosis.</b> A CBC count may reveal eosinophilia.|$|E
50|$|Taeniasis is {{generally}} asymptomatic and is diagnosed when {{a portion of}} the worm is passed in the stool. It is not fatal, although <b>cysticercosis</b> can cause epilepsy and neurocysticercosis can be fatal.|$|E
5000|$|Neurocysticercosis (NCC): is an {{infection}} of the brain or spinal cord caused by the larval stage of the pork tapeworm, Taenia solium. NCC {{is the most common}} helminthic (parasitic worm) infestation of the central nervous system worldwide. Humans develop <b>cysticercosis</b> when they ingest eggs of the pork tapeworm via contact with contaminated fecal matter or eating infected vegetables or undercooked pork. [...] "While <b>cysticercosis</b> is endemic in Latin America, it is an emerging disease with increased prevalence in the United States." [...] "The rate of depression in those with neurocysticercosis is higher than in the general population." ...|$|E
5000|$|<b>Cysticercosis</b> {{caused by}} {{infection}} of the brain and/or muscles with the eggs and larvae of the pork tapeworm Taenia solium (though it has been judged less effective than albendazole in treatment of neurocysticercosis).|$|E
5000|$|<b>Cysticercosis</b> is a {{tapeworm}} larvae infection, while taeniasis is {{infection with}} adult tapeworms [...] Both {{are found in}} Asia, Africa, Latin America, particularly on farms in which pigs are exposed to human excrement.|$|E
50|$|Given {{the fact}} that pigs {{are part of a}} life cycle, {{vaccination}} of pigs is another feasible intervention to eliminate <b>cysticercosis.</b> Research studies have been focusing on vaccine against cestode parasites, since many immune cell types are found to be capable of destroying cysticercus. Many vaccine candidates are extracted from antigens of different cestodes such as Taenia solium, T. crassiceps, T. saginata, T. ovis and target oncospheres and/or cysticerci. In 1983, Molinari et al. reported the first vaccine candidate against porcine <b>cysticercosis</b> using antigen from cysticercus cellulosae drawn out from naturally infected. Recently, vaccines extracted from genetically engineered 45W-4B antigens have been successfully tested to pigs in an experimental condition. This type of vaccine can protect against <b>cysticercosis</b> in both Chinese and Mexican type of T. solium. However, it has not been tested in endemic field conditions, which is important because the realistic condition in the field differ greatly from experimental condition, and this can result in a great difference in the chances of infection and immune reaction.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Cysticercosis</b> (especially neurocysticercosis), {{which is}} caused by the larval form of the pork {{tapeworm}} (i.e. albendazole is the drug of choice for larval pork tapeworms, but not adult pork tapeworms). Old cysts are not affected.|$|E
50|$|T. pisiformis {{typically}} infect {{dogs and}} other carnivores such as coyotes and foxes. In rabbits, T. pisiformis larvae attach {{themselves to the}} liver and intestines, forming cysts 5 - 7 mm in diameter. This {{is referred to as}} <b>cysticercosis.</b>|$|E
50|$|In many cases, <b>cysticercosis</b> in {{the brain}} can lead to epilepsy, seizures, lesions {{in the brain}}, blindness, tumor-like growths, and low {{eosinophil}} levels. It {{is the cause of}} major neurological problems, such as hydrocephalus, paraplegy, meningitis, convulsions, and even death.|$|E
