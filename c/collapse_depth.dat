This is normally calculated; however, {{it is not always}} accurate. Submarines from many nations in World War II reported being forced through crush depth, due to flooding or mechanical failure, only to have the water pumped out, or the failure repaired, and succeed in surfacing again. One of the most popular stories of this occurring was the story of U-96, in the movie Das Boot. These reports are not necessarily verifiable, and popular misunderstanding of the difference between test depth and <b>collapse</b> <b>depth</b> can confuse the discussion. World War II German U-boats generally had collapse depths in the range of 200 to 280 metres (660 to 920 feet). Modern nuclear attack submarines like the American Seawolf class are estimated to have a test depth of 490 m (1,600 ft), which would imply (see above) a <b>collapse</b> <b>depth</b> of 730 m (2,400 ft).|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{pressure}} hull {{is the most}} important part of resisting pressure structures of the structural systems. The submerged {{pressure hull}} is subjected to very high hydrostatic pressure or underwater explosion load, which creates large compressive stress resultants. Due to this the pressure hull is susceptible to buckling. Buckling phenomena analysis is of greater importance in the design of the submerged pressure hulls. For the pressure hulls with local out-of- roundness, the operating depth will be greatly influenced and thus decreasing capability to resist pressure loading. Thus, this work employs the ABAQUS finite element program to analyze the effect of roundness on the buckling strength for the cylinder pressure hull. Sex kinds of out-of-roundness rateφ, 0 %, 1 %, 3 %, 5 %, 10 % and 15 %, were studied in this study. The bulking depth and <b>collapse</b> <b>depth</b> for the cylinder pressure hull with different out-of-roundness rate were calculated.

40|$|Analysis of the {{implosion}} {{of pressure}} vessels in a deep-water environment {{is an important}} research area for the ocean engineering community. The majority of previous implosion research focused on the implosion of metallic cylinders, while the implosion behavior of volumes of different geometries and materials is less well researched. The behavior of pressure pulses resulting from the implosion of multiple pressure vessels is also less well researched. This thesis addresses these questions by investigating the implosion behavior of single and multiple spherical shells. Over {{the course of this}} research, I designed and predicted the <b>collapse</b> <b>depth</b> of metallic spherical volumes using shell buckling theory, then used a computational tool to model several implosion scenarios of both single and multiple sphere configurations. I then conducted implosion tests of single and multiple spherical shell configurations. The results from the initial computational models were compared with results of experimental tests and used to develop updated computational models that more accurately represented the true geometry of the test articles. Based on the analysis of the results of initial computational models and the experimental results, and the correlation between the updated computational models and experimental results, I identified ways to more accurately model scenarios involving implosions of spherical shells. In addition, I analyzed the behavior of a sympathetic implosion event involving two spherical shells and compared the result of the sympathetic implosion event to that of a single equivalent volume. This thesis concludes with guidance for future modeling and experimental testing efforts. by Emma Grace Ferris. Thesis: S.

40|$|Recent {{cetacean}} mass strandings {{in close}} {{temporal and spatial}} association with sonar activity has raised the concern that anthropogenic sound may harm breath-hold diving marine mammals. Necropsy results of the stranded whales have shown evidence of bubbles in the tissues, {{similar to those in}} human divers suffering from decompression sickness (DCS). It has been proposed that changes in behavior or physiological responses during diving could increase tissue and blood N 2 levels, thereby increasing DCS risk. Dive data recorded from sperm, killer, long-finned pilot, Blainville’s beaked and Cuvier’s beaked whales before and during exposure to low- (1 - 2 kHz) and mid- (2 - 7 kHz) frequency active sonar were used to estimate the changes in blood and tissue N 2 tension (PN 2). Our objectives were to determine if differences in 1) dive behavior or 2) physiological responses to sonar are plausible risk factors for bubble formation. The theoretical estimates indicate that all species may experience high N 2 levels. However, unexpectedly, deep diving generally result in higher end-dive PN 2 as compared with shallow diving. In this focused review we focus on three possible explanations: 1) We revisit an old hypothesis that CO 2, because of its much higher diffusivity, form bubble precursors that continue to grow in N 2 supersaturated tissues. Such a mechanism would be less dependent on the alveolar <b>collapse</b> <b>depth</b> but affected by elevated levels of CO 2 following a burst of activity during sonar exposure. 2) During deep dives, a greater duration of time might be spent at depths where gas exchange continues as compared with shallow dives. The resulting elevated levels of N 2 in deep diving whales might also make them more susceptible to anthropogenic disturbances. 3) Extended duration of dives even at depths beyond where the alveoli collapse could result in slow continuous accumulation of N 2 in the adipose tissues that eventually becomes a liability...|$|E

Loess {{is one of the}} erodible soils that have good distribution in Golestan province. Because of the erodibility of these soils all of kinds of erosion can be seen in loess area. Also because of enough depth of soil gully erosion is common over these soils. For studying of gully development trend in loess hilly area of Gorgan, Golestan province three typical gully selected with 40 cm— 50 cm depth, 90 cm— 110 cm width and 300 cm— 500 cm length. The slop of area was 12 %. Average of annual rainfall is 700 mm. To measure the surface area and changes from cutting back or bank collapse a rectangular grid of erosion pin was set out at an appropriate interval. After each rainfall the dimensions of gully measured again. From 43 rainfall event in one-year study only 6 of them had measurable changes in gullies. In each rainfall event intensity, depth and time of rainfall data was collected from Hashem abad station in 3 km far from study area. The results of this study showed that after each rainfall the amount of degraded soil was between. 0. 1 m 3 — 0. 5 m 3. The total of soil eroded in one-year study was about 0. 6 m 3 for each gully. The amount of gully development from head and two sides in one year was 10 and 7 cm respectively. Statistical analysis showed that volume of eroded soil has significant relationship with depth of rainfall. This survey also showed that depth of gully after each rainfall doesn’t increase necessarily and usually because of head cutting and side bank <b>collapse,</b> <b>depth</b> of gully decrease.

40|$|When {{observers}} {{indicate the}} magnitude of a previously viewed spatial extent by walking without vision to each endpoint, {{there is little evidence}} of the perceptual <b>collapse</b> in <b>depth</b> associated with some other methods (eg visual matching). One explanation is that both walking and matching are perceptually mediated, but that the perceived layout is task-dependent. In this view, perceived depth beyond 2 - 3 m is typically distorted by an equidistance effect, whereby the egocentric distances of nonfixated portions of the depth interval are perceptually pulled toward the fixated point. Action-based responses, however, recruit processes that enhance perceptual accuracy as the stimulus configuration is inspected. This predicts that walked indications of egocentric distance performed without vision should exhibit equidistance effects at short exposure durations, but become more accurate at longer exposures. In this paper, two experiments demonstrate that in a well-lit environment there is substantial perceptual anisotropy at near distances (3 - 5 m), but that walked indications of egocentric distance are quite accurate after brief glimpses (150 ms), even when the walking target is not directly fixated. Longer exposures do not increase accuracy. The results are clearly inconsistent with the task-dependent information processing explanation, but do not rule out others in which perception mediates both walking and visual matches...|$|R

The GPR velocity is anisotropic with an average vertical to horizontal velocity ratio of 0. 93, which is attributed to {{the dominance of the}} relatively horizontal orientation of the maximum porosity and permeability.

40|$|Abstract A {{systematic}} petrological {{and chemical}} {{study of the}} volcanic products of the Phlegraean Fields has been accomplished based on the new stratigraphy described by Rosi et al. (this volume). The majority of Phlegraean rocks belong to the "potassic" series of the Roman province. The compositional spectrum ranges from trachybasalts to latites, trachytes, alkali trachytes, and peralkaline phonolitic trachytes. Trachybasalts are extremely rare {{and there is a}} sharp compositional gap between them and the latites. The series between latites and the trachytic varieties is complete. Trachytic rocks are much more voluminous than latites. The order of appearance of the main solid phases is: olivine, clinopyroxene, plagioclase, alkali feldspar, biotite, and oxides. Mineral compositions obtained by microprobe analyases are compatible with the evolution of the rock chemistry. However, primitive compositions of plagioclase (An 80) and clinopyroxene (diopside) persist in the cores of phenocrysts, even at the trachytic and alkali trachytic stage. Fractional crystallization within a shallow magma chamber has been the dominant process for the generation of Phlegraean rock series. The volume of the magma chamber is estimated to have been at least 240 km 3 at the moment of the eruption of the Campanian Ignimbrite, nearly 35, 000 yr. ago. This event was followed by a large caldera <b>collapse.</b> The <b>depth</b> of the chamber cannot be precisely evaluated. However, its top must have been very shallow, probably at 4 - 5 km, as suggested by contact metamorphic rocks obtained from deep geothermal wells within the caldera. Volcanological and petrological data favor a model of upward migration of lighter liquids produced mostly by fractionation along the cool walls of the chamber, the deeper part of which is occupied by a convecting trachybasaltic magma. Progressive migration of eruptive vents toward the caldera center and the contemporaneous strong reduction in the volume of the erupted products, suggest that the chamber behaved as a closed system. The volume of magma was progressively reduced by both cooling and extraction to the surface. © 1983...|$|R

It has been observed in various soil types with negative effects on plant production. Our objective was to characterise the dynamics of slumping at the ploughed layer scale in a sandy soil of North East Thailand. An experimental field was tilled to two depths (20 and 40 cm) with or without ridges and furrows and was submitted i) to natural rainfall during two months (214 mm in June and July 2007) or ii) to experimental flood irrigation (100 or 200 mm over some hours). Changes in bulk density with time were observed, particularly under flooding and after heavy daily rainfall. Final bulk density of 1. 60 Mg m 3 has been measured over 20 cm depth while initial bulk density after tillage was 1. 25 Mg m 3. Bulk density profiles were often characterised with two maximum values, either in the top layer (0 - 5 cm) or {{at the bottom of}} the ploughed layer (15 - 20 or 35 - 40 cm).

40|$|The {{question}} of how to most effectively convey depth in a picture is a multifaceted problem, both because of potential limitations of the chosen medium (stereopsis, image motion), and because effectiveness can be defined in various ways. Practical applications usually focus on information transfer, i. e., effective techniques for evoking recognition of implied depth relationships, but this issue depends on subjective judgements which are difficult to scale when stimuli are above threshold. Two new approaches to this question are proposed here which are based on alternative criteria for effectiveness. Paradoxical monocular stereopsis is a remarkably compelling impression of depth which is evoked during one-eyed viewing of only certain illustrations; it can be unequivocally recognized because the feeling of <b>depth</b> <b>collapses</b> when one shifts to binocular viewing. An exploration of the stimulus properties which are effective for this phenomenon may contribute useful answers for the more general perceptual problem. Positive vergence is an eye-movement response associated with changes of fixation point within a picture which implies depth; it also arises only during monocular viewing. The response is directionally appropriate (i. e., apparently nearer objects evoke convergence, and vice versa), but the magnitude of the response can be altered consistently by making relatively minor changes in the illustration. The cross-subject agreement in changes of response magnitude would permit systematic exploration to determine which stimulus configurations are most effective in evoking perspective vergence, with quantitative answers based upon this involuntary reflex. It may well be that most effective pictures in this context will embody features which would increase effectiveness of pictures in a more general sense...|$|R

It has been observed in various soil types with negative effects on plant production. Our objective was to characterise the dynamics of slumping at the ploughed layer scale in a sandy soil of North East Thailand. An experimental field was tilled to two depths (20 and 40 cm) with or without ridges and furrows and was submitted i) to natural rainfall during two months (214 mm in June and July 2007) or ii) to experimental flood irrigation (100 or 200 mm over some hours). Changes in bulk density with time were observed, particularly under flooding and after heavy daily rainfall. Final bulk density of 1. 60 Mg m 3 has been measured over 20 cm depth while initial bulk density after tillage was 1. 25 Mg m 3. Bulk density profiles were often characterised with two maximum values, either in the top layer (0 - 5 cm) or {{at the bottom of}} the ploughed layer (15 - 20 or 35 - 40 cm). We demonstrated that several processes occurred simultaneously: i) a redistribution of sand particles from the top of ridges to the bottom of furrows that decreased soil roughness, ii) a 2 to 5 cm topsoil collapse when water infiltrated, iii) a soil <b>collapse</b> at greater <b>depths</b> due to overburden pressure. These phenomena agree with the theory of granular material and the decrease in capillary forces between sand grains during wetting. The specific changes in bulk density profiles induced by rainfall should allow the occurrence of slumping to be predicted or identified as a function of soil, climate and tillage conditions...|$|R
40|$|Data {{from the}} EU (Spain-Portugal) bottom trawl surveys in the Division 3 M of the NAFO Regulatory Area (2004 - 2013) were {{analyzed}} to examine patterns on this zone of groundfish assemblage structure and diversity {{in relation to}} depth. 1699 hauls between 129 and 1460 m in depth were carried out. We focused on the 29 most abundant species, which made up 87. 5 % of the catch in terms of biomass. Assemblage structure was strongly correlated with depth. For the most part, changes in assemblages seem to be fairly continuous, although there were more abrupt changes at 600 m. Three main assemblages were identified. A shallow assemblage {{was found in the}} shelf. Assemblage I (Shallow) comprises the strata with depths lesser than 250 m and include American plaice (Hippoglossoides platessoides), witch flounder (Glyptocephalus cynoglossus) and Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua). Assemblage II (Intermediate) includes the strata with depths between 251 and 600 m and comprises Acadian redfish (Sebastes fasciatus), Arctic eelpout (Lycodes reticulates), thorny skate (Amblyraja radiata), longfin hake (Phycis chesteri), deepwater redfish (Sebastes mentella), spinytail skate (Bathyraja spinicauda) and Northern wolffish (Anarichas denticulatus). Three species are present in the two first assemblages: Atlantic wolffish (Anarichas lupus), golden redfish (Sebastes marinus) and spotted wolffish (Anarichas minor). Assemblage III (Deep) contains the depth strata greater than 601 m. Marlin-spike (Nezumia bairdii), scaly dragonfish (Stomias boa), Greenland halibut (Reinhardtius hippoglossoides), sloane’s viperfish (Chaulonius sloani), black dogfish (Centroscyllium fabricii), Snubnosed spiny eel (Notacanthus chemitzii), roughhead grenadier (Macrourus berglax), roundnose grenadier (Coryphaenoides rupestris), blue antimora (Antimora rostrata), threadfin rockling (Gaidropsarus ensis), bean’s sawtoothed eel (Serrivomer beanii), Northern cutthroat eel (Syphanobranchus kaupii), lanternfish (Lampanyctus sp), vahls’s eelpout (Lycodes vahlii), Arctic skate (Amblyraja hyperborea) and Demon catshark (Apristurus sp) formed Assemblage III. Despite dramatic changes in biomass and abundance of the species in the area, the boundaries and composition of the assemblages seem to be similar to the period before the <b>collapse.</b> Extending <b>depth</b> range to 1460 m, no another boundaries were found. Although some changes were evident, the main ones were replacements of the dominant species in several assemblages and bathymetric range extension of distribution of some species. Acadian redfish and golden redfish appear to be the dominant species in the shallowest assemblage instead of Atlantic cod that were dominant in the period before the collapse in the area; redfish is the dominant species in the second shallow and intermediate assemblages. Diversity appears inversely related to biomass in the different assemblages. Despite the collapse in some species and the permanent fishing activity target to the North Shrimp (Pandalus borealis), redfish (Sebastes spp) and Greenland halibut, the overall pattern of demersal fish assemblages remains similar over time. This pattern is similar in other Atlantic areas; it indicates that changes in the fish populations in Northwest Atlantic have been produced on a large scale and are not limited to specific areas...|$|R
