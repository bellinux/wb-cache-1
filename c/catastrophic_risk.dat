5|$|After {{directing}} Finding Nemo, Stanton felt Pixar {{had created}} believable simulations of underwater physics and {{was willing to}} direct a film set largely in space. WALL-E has minimal dialogue in its early sequences; many of the characters do not have voices, but instead communicate with body language and robotic sounds designed by Burtt. The film criticizes consumerism, corporatism, nostalgia, waste management, human environmental impact and concerns, obesity, and global <b>catastrophic</b> <b>risk.</b> It is also Pixar's first animated film with segments featuring live-action characters. Following Pixar tradition, WALL-E was paired with a short film titled Presto for its theatrical release.|$|E

It reported lending commitments of $26.7 billion made to 132 projects in 2011.|$|E
5|$|Many {{writers have}} speculated {{on the ways}} in which a {{friendly}} civilization might interact with humankind. Albert Harrison, a professor emeritus of psychology at the University of California, Davis, thought that a highly advanced civilization might teach humanity such things as a physical theory of everything, how to use zero-point energy, or how to travel faster than light. They suggest that collaboration with such a civilization could initially be in the arts and humanities before moving to the hard sciences, and even that artists may spearhead collaboration. Seth D. Baum, of the Global <b>Catastrophic</b> <b>Risk</b> Institute, and others consider that the greater longevity of cooperative civilizations in comparison to uncooperative and aggressive ones might render extraterrestrial civilizations in general more likely to aid humanity. In contrast to these views, however, Paolo Musso, a member of the SETI Permanent Study Group of the International Academy of Astronautics (IAA) and the Pontifical Academy of Sciences, took the view that extraterrestrial civilizations possess, like humans, a morality driven not entirely by altruism but for individual benefit as well, thus leaving open the possibility that at least some extraterrestrial civilizations are hostile.|$|E

25|$|According to Chris Phoenix and Mike Treder {{from the}} Center for Responsible Nanotechnology {{as well as}} Anders Sandberg from the Future of Humanity Institute {{molecular}} manufacturing is the application of nanotechnology that poses the most significant global <b>catastrophic</b> <b>risk.</b> Several nanotechnology researchers state {{that the bulk of}} risk from nanotechnology comes from the potential to lead to war, arms races and destructive global government. Several reasons have been suggested why the availability of nanotech weaponry may with significant likelihood lead to unstable arms races (compared to e.g. nuclear arms races): (1) A large number of players may be tempted to enter the race since the threshold for doing so is low; (2) the ability to make weapons with molecular manufacturing will be cheap and easy to hide; (3) therefore lack of insight into the other parties' capabilities can tempt players to arm out of caution or to launch preemptive strikes; (4) molecular manufacturing may reduce dependency on international trade, a potential peace-promoting factor; (5) wars of aggression may pose a smaller economic threat to the aggressor since manufacturing is cheap and humans may not be needed on the battlefield.|$|E

50|$|Bostrom and Milan Ćirković's 2008 book Global <b>Catastrophic</b> <b>Risks</b> {{collects}} {{essays on}} a variety of such risks, both natural and anthropogenic.

These dangers are characterized as relatively small and relatively well understood, though pandemics may be exceptions as a result of being more common, and of dovetailing with technological trends.|$|R
40|$|<b>Catastrophic</b> <b>risks</b> {{differ in}} terms of their natural or human origins, their {{possible}} amplification by human behaviors, and the relationships between those who create the risks and those who suffer the losses. Given their disparate anatomies, <b>catastrophic</b> <b>risks</b> generally require tailored therapies, with each prescribed therapy employing a specific portfolio of policy strategies. Given that <b>catastrophic</b> <b>risks</b> occur rarely, and impose extreme losses, traditional mechanisms for controlling risks [...] bargaining, regulation, liability [...] often function poorly. Commons catastrophes arise when a group of actors collectively impose such risks on themselves. When the commons is balanced, that is, when the parties are roughly symmetrically situated, a range of regulatory mechanisms can perform well. However, unbalanced commons [...] such as exist with climate change [...] will challenge any control mechanism with the disparate parties putting forth proposals to limit their own burdens. When humans impose <b>catastrophic</b> <b>risks</b> predominantly on others [...] as with deepwater oil spills [...] the risks are external. For those risks, the analysis shows, a single responsible party should be identified. Primary emphasis should then be placed on a two-tier liability system. Parties engaged in activities posing such <b>catastrophic</b> <b>risks</b> would be subject to substantial minimum financial requirements, strict liability for all damages, and a risk-based tax for expected losses that would exceed the responsible party's ability to pay. Utilizing the financial incentives of this two-tier liability system would decrease the current reliance on regulatory policy, and would alter the role of regulators with a tilt toward financial oversight efforts and away from direct control. <b>Catastrophic</b> <b>risks</b> will always be with us. But as rare, extreme events, society has little experience with them, and current mechanisms are poorly designed to control them. Only a tailored therapy approach offers promise of significant improvement. ...|$|R

Using a very large dataset on homeowners’ insurance coverage by state, by firm, and by year for the 1984 to 2004 period, this paper documents the positive effect on losses and loss ratios of both unexpected catastrophes as well as large events that the authors term “blockbuster catastrophes. ” Insurers adapt to these <b>catastrophic</b> <b>risks</b> by raising insurance rates, leading to lower loss ratios after the catastrophic event. There is a widespread event of unexpected catastrophes and blockbuster catastrophes that reduces total premiums earned in the state, reduces the total number writing insurance coverage in the state, and leads to the exit of firms from the state. Firms with low levels of homeowners’ premiums are most adversely affected by the catastrophes.
