40|$|IFN-gamma is {{a potent}} pro-inflammatory {{cytokine}} thought {{to be involved in}} the pathogenesis of Crohn's disease. To further define the role of IFN-gamma in intestinal inflammation, we studied the effects of intra-colonic 2, 4, 6 -trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS) instillation in mice with a functionally inactivated IFN-gamma receptor 1 (IFN-gammaR 1 (- / -)). Our results indicate that IFN-gamma is not necessary for the induction of hapten-induced colitis: after TNBS administration both wild-type and IFN-gammaR 1 (- / -) mice lost body weight, and the histological features of TNBS-induced colitis were comparable. Colons of IFN-gammaR 1 (- / -) mice contained a greater number of cells, represented by macrophages and CD 4 (+) T cells; <b>caudal</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> cells produced more IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha upon stimulation in vitro. Moreover, IL- 18 and IL- 12 p 40 RNA levels were comparably up-regulated after TNBS treatment in IFN-gammaR 1 (- / -) wild-type mice. These findings demonstrate that IFN-gamma is dispensable for the development of TNBS-induced colitis. Importantly, the production of Th 1 cytokines (e. g. IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha) by <b>caudal</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> T lymphocytes was enhanced rather than decreased in IFNgammaR 1 (- / -) mice with no evidence for default Th 2 developmen...|$|E
40|$|Background: Crohn's {{disease is}} characterised by a chronic {{relapsing}} {{inflammation of the}} bowel in which proinflammatory cytokines play an important perpetuating role. Mitogen activated protein kinase p 38 (p 38 MAPK) has been established as a major regulator of the inflammatory response, {{especially with regard to}} production of proinflammatory cytokines, but its role in inflammatory bowel disease is unexplored. In this paper we describe the effects of a specific p 38 MAPK inhibitor, SB 203580, in trinitrobenzene sulphonic acid (TNBS) induced colitis in mice. Results: SB 203580 had a dichotomal effect in TNBS mice. Weight loss of TNBS mice treated with SB 203580 was significantly worse and colon weight on sacrifice was significantly increased in MAPK inhibitor treated TNBS mice (229. 2 mg and 289. 1 mg, respectively). However, the total number of cells in the <b>caudal</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> decreased to 1 88. 8 x 10 (4) cells in SB 203580 treated TNBS mice compared with 334 x 10 (4) cells in vehicle treated mice. CD 3 /CD 28 double stimulated <b>caudal</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> cells of SB 203580 treated mice showed decreased interferon gamma production but increased tumour necrosis factor alpha production. The concentration of interleukin 12 p 70 in colon homogenates was significantly decreased in SB 203580 treated mice whereas concentrations of interleukin 12 p 40, tumour necrosis factor alpha, and interleukin 10 were similar in vehicle and SB 203580 treated TNBS mice.

40|$|Introduction: The aim of {{this study}} was to use TaqMan {{real-time}} PCR technique to investigate Jaagsiekte sheep retrovirus (JSRV) proviral DNA in whole blood samples of sheep, and compare the results to those of histopathological examinations. Material and Methods: Eighty blood samples from clinically healthy sheep were randomly collected before the animals were slaughtered. Ten tissue samples from each lung and associated <b>caudal</b> mediastinal <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> were taken. Results: Fifteen (18. 75 %) blood samples were found to contain proviral DNA, and 11 (13. 75 %) corresponding lung samples showed microscopic changes consistent with ovine pulmonary adenocarcinoma. None of the samples displayed metastases to the <b>caudal</b> mediastinal <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes.</b> The prominent pattern of neoplastic nodules consisted of acinar (alveolar) form. Conclusion: The results indicated the higher sensitivity of real-time PCR compared to histopathological examinations in detection of ovine pulmonary adenocarcinoma...|$|R
40|$|The {{amounts of}} {{immunoglobulins}} {{formed in the}} respiratory tract of sheep were investigated by comparing the distribution of radiolabelled immunoglobulin between plasma and <b>lymph</b> from the <b>caudal</b> mediastinal <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> efferent duct which drains 50 - 70 % of lung lymph. In addition, immunoglobulin-containing cells in the <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> <b>lymph</b> and in the respiratory mucosa were counted by immunofluorescence. Whereas 91. 6 +/- 5. 92 % and 67. 73 +/- 10. 07 % of IgG 1 and IgG 2 respectively were plasma-derived, only 35. 89 +/- 7. 09 % of IgA was plasma-derived. IgM and albumin were wholly plasma-derived. There was no evidence for selective transport of any immunoglobulins from plasma into lymph. It was estimated that mediastinal <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> <b>lymph</b> contributed 0. 12 g IgA to the circulation daily, the bulk of this being of local origin. There were only few cells expressing IgA in the <b>caudal</b> mediastinal <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> and its efferent lymph indicating that, unlike gut-associated lymphoid tissue, bronchus-associated lymphoid tissue in sheep {{is not a major}} site of IgA cell precursor production. Despite this finding, IgA was the most frequent isotype of Ig-expressing cells in the respiratory mucosa and it is concluded that the locally formed IgA in <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> <b>lymph</b> originated from mucosal plasma cells. IgM- and IgG-expressing cells were much less numerous than IgA-cells in the mucosa, but were the predominant isotype in the <b>caudal</b> mediastinal <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> and regional <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> and in mediastinal <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> efferent <b>lymph.</b> These experiments have established that the respiratory tract of sheep is qualitatively similar to the intestine with respect to immunoglobulin synthesis in that the bulk of IgA is locally derived and a smaller but significant local contribution of IgG 1 and IgG 2 occurs, but that it is a poor source of IgA cell precursors. This implies that the IgA plasma cell population in the respiratory mucosa probably originates from distant mucosal sites...|$|R
40|$|This study {{followed}} the early pathogenesis of orally induced murine typhoid fever. Intragastrically administered Salmonella enteritidis moves {{quickly through the}} normal undisturbed gut so {{that only a small}} residuum remains in the cecum and large intestine after the first few hours. Dye injection of the gut wall was used to show that lymph from discrete portions of the gastrointestinal tract drains to separate <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes,</b> probably via the regional Peyer's patches. Plating techniques capable of detecting a single colony-forming unit of S. enteritidis within the different Peyer's patches and draining <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> indicate that, although the cecum and large intestine are exposed to large numbers of Salmonella for longer time periods than the small intestine, the primary site of bacterial penetration involves the distal ileum. This area of the small intestine as well as the cecum are both drained by the distal mesenteric <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes,</b> and were the only nodes which contained detectable numbers of viable Salmonella over the first 24 h of infection. Neither the pyloric nor the proximal mesenteric <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> (which drain the stomach and duodenum) nor the pancreatic and <b>caudal</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> (which drain the transverse and descending colon) contained viable Salmonella. Salmonella were observed to infect the ileal mucosa and its Peyer's patches. With time, this infection progresses to the draining <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> and ultimately reaches the liver and spleen.

40|$|A 9 -month-old steer was autopsied due to {{recurrent}} ruminal tympany.

40|$|Acquired {{resistance}} to the intracellular bacterial parasite, Listeria monocytogenes can be transferred to normal recipients by thoracic duct lymphocytes or peritoneal exudate cells obtained from rats infected with this organism; The appearance of protective cells in thoracic duct lymph coincides with the development in the donors of delayed-type hypersensitivity to Listeria antigens and accumulation in induced peritoneal exudates of cells which are responsive to these antigens in the migration inhibitory factor (MIF) assay. The cells in exudates that confer protection, and those that release MIF, arise at sites remote from their final destination. From their point of origin in the <b>caudal</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> of infected rats, cells with these properties are delivered to the thoracic duct and hence to the blood from where they are drawn into the peritoneal cavity in response to inflammation. The parallel observed in the appearance, increase and subsequent decline of protective lymphocytes and MIF-producing cells in exudates suggest that the two activities are mediated by a single line of T cells. However this may be, the development and deployment of the cells concerned encourages the belief that MIF has a meaningful role in the expression of cellular {{resistance to}} infection...|$|R
40|$|The {{hallmark}} lesion {{of tuberculosis}} in {{humans and animals}} is the granuloma. The granuloma represents a distinct host cellular immune response composed of epithelioid macrophages, lymphocytes, and multinucleated giant cells, often surrounding a caseous necrotic core. Within the granuloma, host-pathogen interactions determine disease outcome. Factors within the granulomas such as cytokines and chemokines drive cell recruitment, activity, function and ultimately {{the success or failure}} of the host's ability to control infection. Hence, an understanding of the granuloma-level cytokine response is necessary to understand tuberculosis pathogenesis. In-situ cytokine expression patterns were measured using a novel in situ hybridization assay, known as RNAScope® in granulomas of the lungs, tracheobronchial <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> and <b>caudal</b> mediastinal <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> of cattle experimentally infected with Mycobacterium bovis via aerosol exposure. In spite of microscopic morphological similarities, significant differences were seen between late stage granulomas of the lung compared to those of the tracheobronchial <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> for IL- 17 A, IFN-γ, TGF-β, IL 10 and IL- 22 but not for TNF-α. Additionally, significant differences were noted between granulomas from two different thoracic <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> that both receive afferent lymphatics from the lungs (i. e., tracheobronchial and <b>caudal</b> mediastinal <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes)</b> for TNF-α, IL- 17 A, IFN-γ, TGF-β and IL- 10 but not for IL- 22. These findings show that granuloma morphology alone is not a reliable indicator of granuloma function as granulomas of similar morphologies can have disparate cytokine expression patterns. Moreover, anatomically distinct <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> (tracheobronchial vs <b>caudal</b> mediastinal) differ in cytokine expression patterns even when both receive afferent lymphatics from a lung containing tuberculoid granulomas. These findings show that selection of tissue and anatomic location are critical factors in assessing host immune response to M. bovis and should be considered carefully...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. A {{diagnosis}} of plasma cell myeloma {{was made in}} a 6 -year-old Holstein cow that showed con-tinuous nosebleed, progressing emaciation, and hyperglobulinemia. Necropsy revealed enlargement of the <b>caudal</b> mesenteric <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes.</b> <b>Lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> and spleen were infiltrated by neoplastic plasma cells. Renal <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes,</b> bone marrow, and kidneys also were affected. Amyloid-like material that was negative for Congo red was present {{in most of the}} affected <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes.</b> Congo red–positive amyloid material was noted in spleen, kidneys, liver, and adrenal glands. Neoplastic plasma cells exhibited immunohistochemical reactions for l-light chain and 3 classes of heavy chain but not for k-light chain. Nonamyloid deposits were labeled with antisera against l-light chain and heavy chains. Plasmacytoid cells, which stained positively for IgG, IgM, or IgA, were intermingled in all lesions. Production of 3 types of immunoglobulins may be caused by heavy-chain class switching, constantly occurring in certain proportions.

40|$|Visna/Maedi virus (VMV), a small {{ruminant}} lentivirus responsible for lymphoproliferative pneumonia, encephalitis, arthritis and/or mastitis in sheep, has been detected in different non-lymphoid organs. However, {{only a few}} investigations {{have been carried out}} in lymphoid tissues. In this study, some lymphoid tissues and <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> draining or non-draining VMV target organs from five sheep infected experimentally by the respiratory route three years previously were investigated. Archival samples of spleen, red bone marrow, <b>caudal</b> mediastinal <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes,</b> mammary <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes,</b> popliteal <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> and mesenteric <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> were tested by PCR for the presence of proviral DNA.

As indicated by tissue 125 I-activity, pulmonary lymphoblasts had a marked tendency to relocate in the lung, regional pulmonary <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> and spleen. Localization of efferent CMLN lymphoblasts was greater in antigenically stimulated segments compared to unstimulated {{segments of the}} lung.

A face mask was constructed, using fiberglass and polyester, {{taking into account the}} typical facial morphology of the calf. It was tested for airtightness, dead space, laminarity of the expiratory V, and absence of saliva into the pneumotachograph. Three different systems for measuring Ppl (pleura puncturing, esophageal balloon catheter, and esophageal saline solution-filled catheter) were tested in vitro, in a Woulfe's flask, and in vivo, in the 5 calves previously described. Moreover, Ppl measured at 3 different puncture sites of the thorax and at 3 different thoracic positions of the esophagus were compared. The frequency-response was flat to 5 Hz for the intrapleural needle and the balloon catheter, but not for the saline solution-filled catheter. The pulmonary function values obtained by puncture of the pleura at the right 9 th intercostal space on a line running from the tuber coxae to the shoulder joint and by the esophageal balloon catheter, the balloon being positioned between the crossing point with the aorta and the 2 largest <b>caudal</b> mediastinal <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes,</b> did not differ significantly. The Ppl changes during normal breathing were greatest in the ventral site of the thorax and in the caudal thoracic portion of the esophagus, less in the dorsal site of the thorax and the middle thoracic portion of the esophagus, and least in the cranial site of the thorax and the cranial thoracic portion of the esophagus.

40|$|Peritoneal exudates induced in rats {{infected}} with Listeria monocytogenes contain sensitized lymphocytes which can protect normal recipients against a Listeria challenge. The protective cells arise in lymphoid tissue {{remote from the}} peritoneal cavity. Those formed in the <b>caudal</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> of subcutaneously infected rats are delivered to the thoracic duct and hence to the blood from where they are drawn into exudates. Immunoblasts are the most immature members of this protective cell population and they alone among the cells in central lymph localize in exudates induced by killed bacteria. They do so in substantial numbers, but only during the early postinduction period. The "homing" of immunoblasts to inflammatory foci seems {{to be determined by}} a general property of the cells rather than their immunological commitment; however, the intense inflammation induced by organisms to which an animal has been specifically sensitized is accompanied by an exuberant influx of immunoblasts into lesions. Sensitized lymphocytes that extravasate in the inflamed peritoneal may generate more of their own kind, but some give rise to small lymphocytes. The latter also have protective properties and, with time, comprise an increasing portion of the protective cell population. The results imply that the tissue disposition of sensitized lymphocytes in the body is determined by a complementary relationship between blood-borne immunoblasts and vascular endothelium in inflamed tissue. The results also provide a plausible explanation for the concentration of sensitized lymphocytes at sites of microbial implantation where they alone would be expected to collaborate with monocyte-derived macrophages in the control of infection...|$|R

40|$|Lymphatic {{removal of}} dialysate from the peritoneal cavity of anesthetized sheep. Several {{investigators}} {{have suggested that}} the lymphatic circulation reduces ultrafiltration in continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD). The {{purpose of this study was}} to assess lymphatic drainage of the peritoneal cavity directly in anesthetized sheep under dialysis conditions. Lymph was collected from the <b>caudal</b> mediastinal <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> and the thoracic duct, both of which are involved in the lymphatic drainage of the ovine peritoneal cavity, and from the prescapular <b>lymph</b> <b>node,</b> which is not involved in peritoneal lymphatic drainage. Fifty ml/kg volumes of a mildly hypertonic dialysis solution (Dianeal 1. 5 %) containing 25 µCi 125 I-human serum albumin were instilled into the peritoneal cavity, and lymph flows and the appearance of labeled protein in the lymphatic and vascular compartments were monitored for six hours. Following the instillation of dialysis fluid there was a tendency for lymph flow rates from the thoracic duct to increase but these changes were not significant. However, flow rates from the caudal lymphatic demonstrated significant increases, especially in the final three hours of the monitoring period. Only about 8 % of the radiolabeled albumin was removed from the peritoneal cavity over six hours (that is, 92 % was left in the peritoneal space). Of the albumin removed, approximately 17 % of this was drained by abdominal visceral lymphatics into the thoracic duct. About 25 % passed through the diaphragm into the <b>caudal</b> mediastinal <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> and into efferent lymph. Since the efferent lymphatic duct of the caudal mediastinal node empties directly into the thoracic duct, about 42 % of all protein removed from the peritoneal cavity of the sheep was ultimately transported to the thoracic duct. Over half (58 %) of the protein removed from the peritoneal cavity was transported to the blood by routes not involving the thoracic duct. Expected net ultrafiltration volumes appeared to be reduced by lymphatic drainage. The drainage of peritoneal fluid into the thoracic duct over the six hour period was calculated to be 0. 042 ± 0. 013 ml/hr/kg and that into the caudal mediastinal lymphatic 0. 157 ± 0. 034 ml/hr/kg. On the basis of the assumption that the labeled protein entering the bloodstream was delivered exclusively by lymphatics, we estimated that the total rate of lymph flow from the ovine peritoneal cavity during dialysis was 12. 81 ± 1. 84 ml/hr or 0. 454 ± 0. 062 ml/hr/kg...|$|R

All of the drugs appeared in the pulmonary lymph during iv infusion. Peak concentrations in the lymph were attained at 5 min postinfusion with cefazolin, cefoperazone, and ceftriaxone; the peak for moxalactam was attained at 30 min postin-fusion. Cefazolin and cefoperazone penetrated better than did ceftriaxone, which pene-trated better than did moxalactam. The concentrations of moxalactam, as compared with the other drugs, declined more gradually in both venous blood and pulmonary lymph.

40|$|Discussion: The {{odds ratio}} linking {{collection}} one status vs. collection two status of 2. 6 suggests that herds positive for collection one {{were more than}} two {{times more likely to}} be positive on the subsequent shipment. However, this association was demonstrated when examining other pairs of results. The limited correlations between prevalence of samples one and two suggests that there is some repeatability. However, this relationship was moderate in strength, and also was not seen in other pairings. Since these samples were collected at the slaughter plant, it is possible that Salmonella isolates originated from trucks or from the lairage at the plant. If this were the case, associations between sequential collections would be weakened, since the exposure after the farm gate might not be associated with the shedding status of the farm. Another study of these same farms, however, has demonstrated a strong correlation between the Salmonella spp. prevalence among fecal samples collected immediately before shipment and prevalence detected in <b>caudal</b> mesenteric <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> from the same pigs at slaughter. (Kim, et al.) Thus, it seems probable that the poor correlations and associations observed between sequential samples reflects changes on the farm in addition to variation caused by bacteria acquired after leaving the farm.

Although extensive studies have demonstrated {{the importance of the}} mesenteric <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> (MLNs) and intestinal CD 103 + dendritic cells (DCs) in driving small intestinal tolerance to protein antigen, the structural and immunological basis of colonic tolerance remain poorly understood. We show here that the <b>caudal</b> and iliac <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> (ILNs) are inductive sites for distal colonic immune responses and that colonic T cell-mediated tolerance induction to protein antigen is initiated in these draining <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> and not in MLNs. In agreement, colonic tolerance induction was not altered by mesenteric lymphadenectomy. Despite tolerance development, CD 103 +CD 11 b+ DCs, which are the major migratory DC population in the MLNs, and the tolerance-related retinoic acid-generating enzyme RALDH 2 were virtually absent from the ILNs. Administration of ovalbumin (OVA) to the distal colon did increase the number of CD 11 c+MHCIIhi migratory CD 103 −CD 11 b+ and CD 103 +CD 11 b− DCs in the ILNs. Strikingly, colonic tolerance was intact in Batf 3 -deficient mice specifically lacking CD 103 +CD 11 b− DCs, suggesting that CD 103 − DCs in the ILNs are sufficient to drive tolerance induction after protein antigen encounter in the distal colon. Altogether, we identify different inductive sites for small intestinal and colonic T-cell responses and reveal that distinct cellular mechanisms are operative to maintain tolerance at these sites...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{incidence}} of the esophagogastric junction cancer is growing rapidly. The {{purpose of this}} study is to clarify the outcome of the ratio between metastatic and examined <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> in esophagogastric junction cancer patients with or without 7 examined <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes.</b> METHODS: A total of 3, 481 patients who underwent operation are identified from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database. Different <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> resected groups are analyzed to test the <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> ratio factor. RESULTS: There are 2522 patients with 7 or more <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> resected and 959 patients with less than 7 <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> resected. <b>Lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> ratio and <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> involvement are independent prognostic factors. But the <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> ratio categories have a better prognostic value than the <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> involvement categories. Compared with <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> involvement categories, <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> ratio categories represent patients with more homogeneous overall survival rate. CONCLUSIONS: This study defines that the <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> ratio is an independent prognostic factor for esophagogastric junction cancer. The <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> ratio can prevent stage migration and may be a helpful system to predict the prognosis of esophagogastric junction cancer patients...|$|R
40|$|ObjectiveA metastatic <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> {{commonly}} becomes enlarge; however, {{there is}} limited data available {{with regard to the}} direct measurement of <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> and their clinicopathologic characteristics. MethodsThe size of dissected <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> was quantified in a total of 848 nodes with metastasis and 10, 462 nodes without metastasis from 454 patients with lung cancer who underwent a pulmonary resection with <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> dissection. ResultsThe short axis and the volume of the metastatic <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> were significantly greater than those of the nonmetastatic ones. The smaller the <b>lymph</b> <b>node,</b> the less frequently the <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> were metastatic; however, the ratios of nodes smaller than the fifth largest <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> with metastasis of adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma were 21. 8 to 26. 2 %, respectively. When the hilar and mediastinal <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> stations were examined, 1. 14 to 4. 00 % of the lung cancer patients had <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> metastasis in small <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> despite having no metastases in the largest and second largest <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes.</b> ConclusionsThe small <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> in the hilar or mediastinal stations frequently had metastases of carcinoma even though largest and second largest <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> were negative for metastases, especially in adenocarcinoma cases. Surgical oncologists should, therefore, perform systemic <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> dissection, and not sampling, during a pulmonary resection of lung cancer...|$|R
