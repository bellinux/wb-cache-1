Without the intercooler {{the temperature of the}} charge could be as high as 400 °F (204 °C). The intercooler in itself was not adequate to deal with the high temperature and an additional <b>cooling</b> <b>fin</b> and tube core was placed between the outlet of the blower and the induction manifold to the cylinders. This radiator was known as an aftercooler and served as a reservoir for the supercharger cooling system. The glycol mixture used for cooling was independent of the main engine cooling system and used a centrifugal pump driven by the engine to circulate the coolant through an aircraft radiator system at a maximum rate of 36 U.S. gallons (136 litres, 30 Imperial gallons) per minute, depending on engine rpm. This combined system reduced the charge temperature to suitable levels.|$|E

40|$|A {{series of}} {{measurements}} {{on the performance}} of solar cell string modules with low-concentrating CPC reflectors with a concentration factor C &# 732; 4 X have been carried out. To minimise the reduction in efficiency due to high cell temperatures, the modules were cooled. Four different way of cooling were tested: 1) The thermal mass of the module was increased, 2) passive air cooling was used by introducing a small air gap between the module and the reflector, 3) the PV cells were cooled by a large <b>cooling</b> <b>fin,</b> 4) the module was actively cooled by circulating cold water on the back. The best performance was given with the actively cooled PV module which gave 2, 2 times the output from a reference module while for the output from the module with a <b>cooling</b> <b>fin</b> the value was 1, 8. Active cooling is also interesting due to the possibility of co-generation of thermal and electrical energy which is discussed in the paper.

40|$|We {{consider}} the nonlinear inverse problem of reconstructing the heat conductivity of a <b>cooling</b> <b>fin,</b> modeled by a 2 -dimensional steady-state equation with Robin boundary conditions. The Metropolis Hastings Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm is studied and implemented, {{as well as}} the notion of priors. By analyzing the results using certain trial conductivities, we formulate several distinct priors to aid in obtaining the solution. These priors are associated with different identifiable parts of the reconstruction, such as areas with vanishing, constant, or varying slopes. Although more research is required for some non-constant conductivities, we believe that using several priors simultaneously could help in solving the problem. Comment: 9 pages, 5 figures.

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{addresses}} the fixed-interval smoothing problem for linear two-point boundary value stochastic {{processes of the}} type introduced by Krener [5]. As these models are not Markovian, Kalman filtering and associated smoothing algorithms are not applicable. The smoothing problem for this class of noncausal processes is solved here by an application of the estimator solution which is developed in Part I [3] via the method of complementary models. For an nth order model, this approach yields the smoother as a 2 nth order two-point boundary value problem. It is shown that this smoother can be realized in a stable two-filter form which is remarkably similar to two-filter smoothers for causal processes. In addition, expressions for the smoothing error and smoothing error covariance are developed. These equations are employed to perform a covariance analysis of estimating the temperature and heat flow in a <b>cooling</b> <b>fin...</b>|$|E

40|$|LED lamps are {{characterized}} by high energy efficiency, high luminance, and long lifespans.

The objective of the design was to reduce the maximum temperature and temperature difference on the fin, the amount of aluminum required for fin manufacturing, and CO 2 emissions to save energy. The study employed the Taguchi method for experiment planning and used gray relational analysis and principal component analysis to determine the optimal parameter combination for cooling fins. The results showed that the maximum temperature on the fin surface dropped by 2. 62 °C in environments without forced convection, which indicated improved lighting efficiency. Furthermore, the amount of aluminum used per unit volume for fins was reduced by 15 %, which effectively reduced CO 2 emissions during the manufacturing process...|$|E
