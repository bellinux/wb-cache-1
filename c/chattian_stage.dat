5000|$|During {{the middle}} Oligocene ~25 Ma, a world-wide cooling {{of the climate}} started the drying of the Dade Subsea, Gulf Trough, and in turn {{enlarging}} Orange Island. During the Chattian of the Late Oligocene, land mammals began their movement into what is now Florida with earliest of their fossils found in Hernando County dating to 24.8 Ma. Also from that <b>Chattian</b> <b>stage</b> through early Aquitanian age of the early Miocene, Orange Island expanded both northward and westward with carbonate lagoon system on its west side. To the south of Orange Island, the Everglades Basin remained at 250 meters (850 feet) deep. Orange Island had its own rivers carrying sediments composed of sand and clay in to the Yeehaw Strait at Orange Island's southern tip.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Two new dinoflagellate cyst {{zones are}} proposed, linking {{previously}} established zonal schemes for the Eocene-Oligocene and Oligocene-Miocene successions {{in the central}} Mediterranean region. The Hystrichokolporna pusillurn (Hpu) and Chiropteridiurn lobospinosum (Clo) interval zones {{are based on the}} Contessa Quarry and Monte Cagnero sections (central Italy), and are correlated with previously established magnetostratigraphical and biostratigraphical schemes. The base of the Chat-tian is considered to correlate with Chron ClOn. In central Italy, the most distinct dinoflagellate cyst event associated with this chron is the first occurrence of Distatodiniurn biqii, marking the base of the Distatodiniurn biqii (Dbi) Zone. Indirect evidence also suggests that the first occurrence of Distatodiniurn biqii is above but close {{to the base of the}} <b>Chattian</b> <b>Stage</b> in its type area in northwest Germany, thus making it an important marker. Other possible markers for the base of the Chattian are the last occurrence of Areosphaeridium pectiniforme and the lowest acme of Chiropteridium spp. The latter may be related to the major mid-Oligocene sea-level fall (TA-TB Exxon supercycle boundary), also considered to represent the base of the Chattian and previously correlated with Chron ClOn. However, in the Contessa Quarry section this dinoflagellate cyst event is associated with the older Chron C l 1...|$|E
40|$|Quantitative {{analysis}} for the Lower Miocene of Ocean Drilling Program Hole 959 A from the West African margin was performed to document all the calcareous nannofossil biostratigraphic events present. Combined with data from previous investigations of the Lower Miocene from the tropical Atlantic, this research identifies and tests the viability of markers used in current zonation scheme, identifies alternative markers for age boundaries, and examine statistically the most probable order of event in the Lower Miocene using the Ranking and Scaling method (RASC). The examination of Hole 959 A was performed on a 112 samples. Seven additional sites that collectively span the lower Miocene are used for the quantitative biostratigraphic analysis. These sites include DSDP Site 563 in the north central Atlantic (Maiorano and Monechi, 1998), Holes 897 C, 898 A, and 900 A on the Iberian Abyssal Plain (De Kaenel and Villa, 1996), Holes 960 C and 960 A on the Ivory Coast margin (Shafik et al., 1998), and DSDP Site 558 in the North central Atlantic (Parker et al., 1984). In Hole 959 A, all major zones and subzonal boundaries from CN 1 to CN 4 were identified, except for the boundary between Subzones CN 1 a and CN 1 b, using primary and secondary markers from Okada and Bukry (1980) zonation. All age boundaries were identified or closely estimated using the proper calcareous nannoplankton markers from the <b>Chattian</b> to Langhian <b>stages.</b> The resultant list of events extracted from Hole 959 A along with events from other seven sites were biostratigraphically examined in RASC. The well threshold is the only control parameter that was changed in order to select the appropriate control parameter. A well threshold of 4 was selected resulting in 22 events in the optimum sequence with 13 of which had a low standard deviation. Advisor: David K. Watkin...|$|R
40|$|CO 2 -induced {{global warming}} will affect {{seasonal}} to decadal temperature patterns. Expected {{changes will be}} particularly strong in extratropical regions where temperatures will increase at faster rates than at lower latitudes. Despite that, it is still poorly constrained how precisely short-term climate dynamics will change in a generally warmer world, particularly in nearshore surface waters in the extratropics, i. e., the ecologically most productive regions of the ocean on which many human societies depend. Specifically, a detailed knowledge {{of the relationship between}} pCO 2 and seasonal SST is crucial to understand interactions between the ocean and the atmosphere. In the present investigation, we have studied for the first time how rising atmospheric pCO 2 levels forced surface temperature changes in Central Europe (paleolatitude 45 °N) during the mid-Oligocene (fromca. 31 to 25 Ma), a time interval of Earth history during which global conditions were comparable to those predicted for the next few centuries. For this purpose, we computed numerical climate models for the Oligocene (winter, summer, annual average) assuming an atmospheric carbon dioxide rise from 400 to 560 ppm (current level to two times pre-industrial levels, PAL) and from 400 to 840 ppm (= three times PAL), respectively. These models were compared to seasonally resolved sea surface temperatures (SST) reconstructed from δ 18 O values of fossil bivalve shells (Glycymeris planicostalis, G. obovata, Palliolum pictum, Arctica islandica and Isognomon maxillata sandbergeri) and shark teeth (Carcharias cuspidata, C. acutissimaand Physogaleus latus) collected fromthe shallow water deposits of the Mainz and Kassel Basins (Germany). Multi-taxon oxygen isotope-based reconstructions suggest a gradual rise of temperatures in surface waters (upper 30 to 40 m), on average, by asmuch as 4 °C during the Rupelian stage followed by a 4 °C cooling during the <b>Chattian</b> <b>stage.</b> Seasonal temperature amplitudes increased by ca. 2 °C during the warmest time interval of the Rupelian stage,withwarming beingmore pronounced during summer (5 °C) than during winter (3 °C). According to numerical climate simulations, the warming of surface waters during the early Oligocene required a CO 2 increase by at least 160 ppm, i. e., 400 ppm to 560 ppm. Given that atmospheric carbon dioxide levels predicted for the near future will likely exceed this value significantly, the Early Oligocene warming gives a hint of the possible future climate in Central Europe under elevated CO 2 levels...|$|E
