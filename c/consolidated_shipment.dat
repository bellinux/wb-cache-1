The Bureau of Customs also conducts 100% inspections that added to the burden of delayed shipments. The inspections are the result of some unscrupulous individuals who use balikbayan boxes to smuggle commercial items without paying taxes or smuggle contraband.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{consider}} a one-warehouse N-retailer inventory system characterized by access to real-time point-of-sale data, {{and a time}} based dispatching and shipment consolidation policy at the warehouse. More precisely, inventory is reviewed continuously, while a <b>consolidated</b> <b>shipment</b> (for example, a truck) to all retailers is dispatched from the warehouse at regular time intervals. The focus is on investigating the cost benefits of using state-dependent myopic allocation policies instead of a simple FCFS (First-Come-First-Serve) rule to allocate shipped goods to the retailers. The analysis aims to {{shed some light on}} when, if ever, FCFS is a reasonable policy to use in this type of system? The FCFS allocations of items to retailers are determined by the sequence in which retailer orders (or equivalently customer demands) arrive to the warehouse. Applying the myopic policy enables the warehouse to postpone the allocation decision to the moment of shipment (from the warehouse) or the moments of delivery (to the different retailers), and to base it on the inventory information available at those times. The myopic allocation method we study is often used in the literature on periodic review systems. (C) 2010 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|In the {{distribution}} network {{of a large}} retailer, shipments can either be transported by the retailer's own trucks or outsourced to third-party logistics (3 PL) companies. In the former case, shipments are consolidated and transported from their origins through an intermediate facility, namely a crossdock. At a crossdock, shipments are unloaded, sorted, re-consolidated, loaded and transported to their destinations. The consolidation process offers economies of scale that reduce the transportation costs. At the same time, it increases travel distances and incurs handling costs at a crossdock. For this reason, consolidation is uneconomic for a shipment in which origin and destination are located close to one other, especially through a distant crossdock. It is cheaper to outsource transportation of such a shipment to 3 PL companies. This shipping decision raises a series of questions. Should a shipment be consolidated through a crossdock or outsourced to 3 PL companies? How do facility locations, the operational cost of a crossdock and mode of shipments influence the shipping decision? Can the robustness and potential growth of a crossdock be measured? How does outsourcing affect the robustness and potential growth of a crossdock? We formulate a strategic model of a retailer's distribution network as an economic trade-off between consolidated shipments through a crossdock and outsourced shipments to 3 PL companies. We study the locus of facility locations where the costs of a <b>consolidated</b> <b>shipment</b> and an outsourced shipment are equal and discover that the trade-off can be modeled by classical geometric curves, particularly an ellipse, a hyperbola, a limacon and a Cartesian oval. These curves can be developed into a preliminary routing and locating tool. We also observe interesting connections between the single hub crossdocking network and other fields of geometric study, such as Voronoi diagrams and geometric inversion. In addition, the area bounded by these curves represents the likelihood in which a particular shipment is consolidated through a crossdock. We expand this concept to multiple vendor-store pairs and suggest an index that measures robustness and potential growth of a particular crossdock. This asymptotic-probability index explains economic driving factors of consolidation and outsourcing. Although the derivation of the index {{is limited by the}} dimension and spatial distribution of facilities, its numerical value can be determined by a computer simulation. Therefore, we use Monte Carlo simulation to compute the proposed index to explain the outsourcing and the interaction between TL threshold 0. 1 and mode of shipments. The analysis and computer simulation suggest that outsourcing may cause an adverse effect in a single hub crossdocking network, resulting in the abrupt reduction of consolidated shipments in the network. Furthermore, we propose transportation planning to alleviate this effect and compare them to the optimal allocation. The routing and locating application of the model is illustrated using the Home Depot distribution network. Our model predicts 5. 5 % and additional 1. 0 % savings in transportation cost by re-allocation of shipments and re-location of crossdocks, respectively. The empirical study shows that the adverse effect of outsourcing can be eliminated by limiting the number of crossdocks used by each store. Ph. D.

The vehicles deliver the items from the origin to the destination, while the items can be stored at some warehousing facilities as the intermediate storage during the delivery. The delivery plan is made for each day separately, but the storage at a warehouse may last {{for more than one}} day. Therefore, the entire logistic plan should be considered over a certain period for the total optimization. We formulate the storage and delivery problem as a mixed integer programming. Then, we propose a relax-and-fix type heuristic method, which incrementally fixes decision variables until all the variables are fixed to obtain a complete solution. Moreover, a semiapproximate model is introduced to effectively fix the variables. Based on the formulation, the delivery plan can be solved for each day separately. This has the advantage especially in the dynamic situation, where the delivery request is modified from the original request before the actual delivery day. Numerical experiments show that the simultaneous optimization gives the effective storage plan to reduce the total logistic cost, and the proposed heuristics efficiently reduce the computational time and are robust against the dynamic situation.

30|$|Cross-docking is a {{distribution}} strategy {{that enables the}} consolidation of products from origins to destinations. In a cross-dock, products are unloaded from inbound trucks and directly reloaded to outbound trucks without long storage in it. It is proved that the cross-docking in compare with traditional distribution centers dealing with cost and storage reduction, has shorter delivery lead time, better customer servicing, fast inventory turn and less loss and damage risks (Apte and Viswanathan 2000). Implementation of the cross-docking can decrease warehousing costs up to 70 % (Vahdani and Zandieh 2010) and decreases transportation costs by using full trucks and <b>consolidating</b> <b>shipments</b> (Apte and Viswanathan 2000). The most important constraint in the cross-docking is the limited time for products storage inside the cross-dock (e.g., 24  h) (Schaffer 1998). In some cases like frozen products or some kinds of drugs, the storage time might be even less than an hour. Because of this characteristic, vehicle routing and scheduling of inbound and outbound trucks play important role in applying a cross-docking system (Lee et al. 2006).|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the subject of}} cost allocation in a multiple product inventory system, allowing for consolidation of shipments. If we order multiple items using an economic order quantity (EOQ) policy, and <b>consolidate</b> <b>shipments,</b> part of the ordering cost is shared, and part is specific to each item; {{we want to find}} the consolidation choice with optimal total cost and divide the cost fairly among the individual items. Such a fair division is central to a costing system in which no group of items subsidizes the others; there are no free riders! We use a cooperative inventory game to determine when this can be done. This game is usually not concave, so {{we want to know what}} consolidation combinations determine when this cost can be fairly divided, using the core of the game. We prove that consolidation of all the items is cheaper exactly if there are fair cost allocations (core of the game is not empty), which happens when the portion of the ordering cost common to all items is not too small. We further show how sensitive the nonempty core result is to adjustments in the cost parameters and show how to determine a threshold value for the shared ordering cost, which assures the existence of a fair cost allocation. inventory games, cost allocation, shipment consolidation...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: Many {{manufacturing}} companies that ship goods through full container loads found themselves under-utilizing the containers and resulting in higher carbon footprint per volume shipment. One {{of the reasons}} is the choice of non-ideal container sizes for their shipments. Consolidation fills up the containers more efficiently that reduces the overall carbon footprint. The objective {{of this paper is to}} support decisions on selection of appropriate combination of container sizes and shipment consolidation for a manufacturing company. We develop two-steps model which first takes the volumes to be shipped as an input and provide the combination of container sizes required; then evaluate possibility of shipment consolidation from multiple ports (of loading) within the same country to the same destination (port of discharge). In both steps, the objective function is to minimize carbon footprint by applying linear/integer programming. Only consolidation within the same country is considered due to practical considerations to avoid the need for cross border clearances. Design/Methodology/Approach: In this paper, we first provide an Integer Programming model to minimize the companies’ shipping carbon footprints by selecting the ideal container sizes appropriate for their shipment volumes. Secondly, we proposed a strategy to minimize the carbon footprint by <b>consolidating</b> the <b>shipments</b> in the same country from multiple domestic locations at a port of loading by road freight, before the international sea shipment. A mixed-Integer Programming model has been developed to determine if one should ship each shipment separately or have <b>shipments</b> <b>consolidated</b> first before being shipped. Findings: Computational results using real-world data will be showcased. Originality/Value: Optimize the container size for shipment for a manufacturing company and <b>consolidating</b> the <b>shipments</b> within the same country. Practical Implications: We verify our model with a real-world business case (and data) in the consumer product manufacturing industry. By applying the proposed approach and models, the company can reduce the carbon footprint by 13. 4 % by using the optimal container size and further reduce the carbon footprint by 12. 1 % from consolidation of shipments as compared to the current practice without optimization...|$|R
40|$|Abstract-The dynamic vehicle {{allocation}} problem {{arises when}} a motor carrier must simultaneously and {{in real time}} coordinate the dispatching of vehicles from one region to the next all over the country. The decision to send a vehicle loaded or empty from one region to the next, arriving in the destination region {{at some point in}} the future, must anticipate the downstream impacts of the decision. The consequences of another load in a particuiar region {{at some point in the}} future, however, are highly uncertain. A simple methodology is proposed which calculates approximately the marginal value of an additional vehicle in each region in the future. This information is then used to generate a standard pure network which can be efficiently optimized to give dispatching decisions for today. The dynamic vehicle allocation problem arises when a carrier must manage the positioning of a fleet of vehicles over time. The application motivating this paper arises from truckload motor carriers where a shipper might request a trailer to carry a load of freight from one city to the next on a given day. The shipper pays for the entire tractor-trailer combination and there is no issue of <b>consolidating</b> <b>shipments</b> on one trailer. The problem the carrier faces is one of anticipating the needs of shippers by ensuring that trailers are in the right place at the right time.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} solution {{approaches for}} a shipper pickup and delivery planning problem to move freight from suppliers to distribution centers. Each shipment is moved either direct via a less-than-truckload (LTL) carrier, or possibly <b>consolidated</b> with other <b>shipments</b> and moved {{by one or}} two truckload (FTL) routes. When using a FTL carrier, the shipper takes advantage of contracted lane rates that establish prices per mile for a truck operated between two locations that are significantly less than the comparable LTL price for shipping a full truckload. The challenge for the shipper is to <b>consolidate</b> multiple <b>shipments</b> effectively {{to take advantage of}} this price differential.

In {{the first}} model, the scheduling of {{home health care}} providers from their homes, {{to a set of}} patients, and then back to their respective homes, is performed both heuristically and optimally for very small instances. The problem is complicated by the presence of multiple depots, time windows, and the scheduling of lunch breaks. It is shown that the problem can be formulated as a mixed integer programming problem and, in very small instances, solved to optimality with a branch-and-cut procedure. To obtain solutions for larger instances, though, a heuristic is shown to have more success. The second application considers the vehicle routing problem with time windows, or VRPTW. The vehicle routing problem involves finding a set of routes starting and ending at a single depot that together visit a set of customers. In the VRPTW, there is an additional constraint requiring that each customer must be visited within a given time window. The best known solution procedures for solving the VRPTW use a set partitioning model with column generation. Within this framework, we present a new approach for generating valid inequalities, specifically k-path cuts, to improve the linear programming relaxation. Computational results are given for the standard library of test instances. In particular, the results include solutions for ten previously unsolved instances. The final application concerns the less-than-truckload, or LTL, trucking industry. An LTL carrier primarily handles shipments that are significantly smaller than the size of a tractor-trailer. Savings are achieved by <b>consolidating</b> <b>shipments</b> into loads at regional terminals and transporting these loads from terminal to terminal.

By choosing a freight invoice verification model, a customer can forecast the freight cost to be accrued for accounting purposes. This translates to lesser risk and more predictability in cash flow for the company. Akzo Nobel’s automated freight audit process has also instilled tighter controls over their freight accounting by eliminating human communication and intervention {{from the point of}} the freight quote to the payment process. By controlling the human communication and minimizing human intervention, the audit process will be unbiased and less likely to deviate from the proper process.|$|R
40|$|International audienceIn {{this paper}} we used {{principles}} of cooperative game theory to analyse the cooperation (inventory pooling) between multiple retailers replenishing their inventory by full truckload shipments {{to satisfy a}} deterministic and constant rate demand of final customers while minimising the associated total transportation and inventory costs. For this model, we derive structural properties of the resulting cost function. We use these to prove not only that it is cost effective to <b>consolidate</b> the <b>shipments</b> between the retailers, but also that this shipment consolidation strategy can be supported by a stable cost allocation, i. e., {{the core of the}} associated cooperative game is non-empty. We further identify a stable cost allocation that is shown to give strong incentives for the retailers to cooperate. In the particular case of identical retailers, this allocation coincide with Shapley value and lies at the centre of gravity of the core. In the general case of non-identical retailers, Shapley value is not a core allocation and is compared to our allocation with regards of four criteria: stability, complexity, fairness and practical settings...|$|R
5000|$|At {{the age of}} 30, Schenker {{together}} with two partners founded the freight forwarding company Schenker & Co on 1 July 1872 in Vienna. The managerial ingenuity of the Swiss-born entrepreneur was the introduction of groupage consignments by train. The idea to <b>consolidate</b> small <b>shipments</b> into larger units led to a completely new, reasonably priced and fast transport system by rail, road, sea, and inland waterways. The network of branches was expanding rapidly. At {{the end of the}} 19th century, Schenker already was the only enterprise offering tariffs calculated through from London to Istanbul. His successful approach—"house to house transport with one single forwarder"—soon made him market leader, as he was able to meet the requirements of his customers better and faster than all the competitors. The company has maintained this approach until today. A present-day historian wrote about Gottfried Schenker, who died in 1901, [...] "He {{was one of the great}} economic pioneers of the 19th century and became renowned far outside the borders of the Austro-Hungarian empire".|$|R
