25|$|Martin Fleischmann of the University of Southampton and Stanley Pons of the University of Utah {{hypothesized}} that the high compression ratio and mobility of deuterium that could be achieved within palladium metal using electrolysis might result in nuclear fusion. To investigate, they conducted electrolysis experiments using a palladium cathode and heavy water within a calorimeter, an insulated vessel designed to measure process heat. Current was applied continuously for many weeks, with the heavy water being renewed at intervals. Some deuterium {{was thought to be}} accumulating within the cathode, but most was allowed to bubble out of the cell, joining oxygen produced at the anode. For most of the time, the power input to the cell was equal to the <b>calculated</b> <b>power</b> leaving the cell within measurement accuracy, and the cell temperature was stable at around 30°C. But then, at some point (in some of the experiments), the temperature rose suddenly to about 50°C without changes in the input power. These high temperature phases would last for two days or more and would repeat several times in any given experiment once they had occurred. The <b>calculated</b> <b>power</b> leaving the cell was significantly higher than the input power during these high temperature phases.

5000|$|Measuring {{the power}} output of a top fuel engine {{directly}} {{is not always}} feasible. Certain models use a torque sensor incorporated {{as part of the}} RacePak data system. Dynamometers that can measure the output of a Top Fuel engine exist; however, the main limitation is that a Top Fuel engine cannot be run at its maximum power output for more than 10 seconds without overheating or possibly destroying itself explosively. Making such high power levels from such relatively limited displacement is a result of using very high boost levels and running at extremely high RPMs; both of these stress the internal components to a high degree, meaning that the peak power can only safely be achieved for brief periods of time, and even then only by intentionally sacrificing components. The engine power output can also be calculated based upon the car's weight and its performance. The <b>calculated</b> <b>power</b> output of these engines is most likely somewhere between , which is about twice as powerful as the engines installed on some modern diesel locomotives, with a torque output of approximately [...] and a brake mean effective pressure of [...]|$|E
50|$|In 2005, Abdullahi {{ran for the}} {{parliamentary}} election in Sahil region. He won with almost one-fourth (25%) of his party's votes. This victory together {{with the backing of}} UCID party and specially his friend Faysal Ali Warabe and other party comrades, he pursued to the position of the Speaker of the House of Representatives. This was difficult to even think about such position as UCID had only 17% of the House seats but the power calculation and the grit for his ambition has helped his determination. The <b>calculated</b> <b>power</b> ended to the fact that UDUB and Kulmiye could never share the leadership of the House and none-could get majority except UCID's support. Strategically, the chairmanship (Shir-guddoonka) of the House which was seen as indivisible and thus spurring win-lose perceived outcome was broadened to accommodate the other party. On this basis, UCID approached UDUB and asked to share the chairmanship (Shir-guddoonka), being confident in getting the only needed 8 votes from opposition parties, UDUB offered the second vice-chairman of the House but UCID immediately approached Kulmiye who was desperate to get opposition House to pressure UDUB party through the majority House of Representatives. Finally, Kulmiye agreed to take the first and second vice-chairman positions. Against the full opposition of the ruling government, with its political, economic and clan-manipulation power, Abdullahi was elected as the Speaker of Somaliland's House of Representatives.|$|E

Mean power input per unit mass (PJM) varied from 237 - 2 W kg" 1 in Manduca sexta (Subfamily: Sphinginae), mean body mass 1 - 2 x io~ 3 kg, to 327 - 9 W kg" 1 in Deilephila elpenor (Subfamily: Macroglossinae) mean body mass 7 - 3 x io~ * kg. Mean PJM for the five species was inversely proportional to mean body mass and directly proportional to mean wing loading. For any given body mass, PJM was greater in Hyles lineata than in M. sexta. This difference is correlated with higher wing loading at any given mass in H. lineata. Energy expenditure per unit mass of thorax was ioiSWkg" 1 in H. lineata and 694 W kg" 1 in M. sexta.
