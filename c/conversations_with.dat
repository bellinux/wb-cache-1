5|$|<b>Conversations</b> <b>with</b> the {{previous}} game's protagonists increased the Cadet's standing with them: if the player tapped a special button on-screen during timed {{sections of the}} conversation, the bond statistic with the chosen character would be increased. The relationships built up by the player triggered special character interactions during the final chapter. Agito featured sub-missions, the game's version of side-quests, some of which changed depending on the real-world day of the week. They were given by NPCs, and could range from crafting new spells and equipment to performing certain actions within a combat mission. Completing quests yielded rewards such as new equipment and items.|$|E

The Famicom version {{also features a}} command menu system, point-and-click interface, and 3D dungeon maze. Upon its release, The Portopia Serial Murder Incident was well received in Japan. It became an influential title and helped define the visual novel genre.|$|E

5|$|Many {{different}} {{sources of information}} can motivate discussion about HIV/AIDS among married couples. After hearing information about HIV/AIDS at local health facilities or during <b>conversations</b> <b>with</b> friends or family members, {{people are more likely}} to address the risk of HIV contraction with their spouses. In addition, women are more likely than men to mention the dangers of HIV/AIDS when they suspect that their spouses are engaging in extramarital sexual relations. According to a 2003 study by Eliya Msiyaphazi Zulu and Gloria Chepngeno, although higher levels of education do correspond to greater knowledge about HIV/AIDS, education levels do not significantly impact the likelihood that couples will discuss HIV-related prevention strategies.|$|E
5|$|Porfiry Petrovich– The {{head of the}} Investigation Department {{in charge}} of solving the murders of Lizaveta and Alyona Ivanovna, who, along with Sonya, moves Raskolnikov towards confession.

Despite the lack of evidence, he becomes certain Raskolnikov is the murderer following several <b>conversations</b> <b>with</b> him, but gives him the chance to confess voluntarily. He attempts to confuse and to provoke the unstable Raskolnikov {{in an attempt to}} coerce him to confess. According to the creators of the TV series Columbo (William Link and Richard Levinson), the title character was based on Porfiry.|$|E
5|$|Some of Escher's many {{tessellation}} drawings {{were inspired}} by <b>conversations</b> <b>with</b> the mathematician H. S. M. Coxeter on hyperbolic geometry. Escher was especially interested in five specific polyhedra, which appear many times in his work. The Platonic solids—tetrahedrons, cubes, octahedrons, dodecahedrons, and icosahedrons—are especially prominent in Order and Chaos and Four Regular Solids. These stellated figures often reside within another figure which further distorts the viewing angle and conformation of the polyhedrons and provides a multifaceted perspective artwork.|$|E

5|$|Some royal advisers, {{who were}} {{angered by the}} trust the king placed in Rosenberg, {{regarded}} him with suspicion. For example, Walter M. Gibson, the Prime Minister of Hawaii, noted that King Kalākaua withheld most of the specific details of his <b>conversations</b> <b>with</b> Rosenberg from him. Kalākaua's autocracy and nativism, along with allegations of his corruption, convinced a powerful group of western businessmen and children of Christian missionaries that action should be taken against the king. This led to the June 1887 Constitution, which stripped Kalākaua of much of his power and significantly weakened the Hawaiian monarchy.|$|E
5|$|The album's artwork, {{featuring}} a plastic skull with tinfoil, {{was not intended}} to be the original artwork. Both Mustaine and Ellefson had many phone <b>conversations</b> <b>with</b> Combat Records to get the cover artwork properly reproduced from a sketch given to them by Mustaine of a picture of Megadeth mascot Vic Rattlehead on the cover. However the studio lost the artwork, and instead made their own improvised and low-budget replacement, with which Mustaine and the whole band were mortified.|$|E
5|$|The game {{begins with}} {{character}} creation, where the player assigns attribute points (such as strength, intelligence, charisma) to The Nameless One.

The player may recruit adventuring companions {{over the course of}} the game; there are seven potential party members, but a maximum of five may accompany the player at any one time.
