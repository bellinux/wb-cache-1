In an interview with Rekhs, a celebrity columnist for Behindwoods, Gopu said, [...] "This film {{even if it is}} remade today, will not hold a candle to its original". Crazy Mohan said, [...] "Kadhalikka Naeramillai is Tamil Cinema’s Mount Everest of comedy. There’s no other Tenzing [...] in sight so far. I was aghast that some people even considered re-making Kadhalikka Naeramillai. None should attempt it. It is blasphemy". Sharadha Narayanan of The New Indian Express stated in February 2009, [...] "Recently when the news of Kadhalikka Neramillai remake was announced, every lip had one question that went unanswered: Who <b>can</b> <b>actually</b> <b>do</b> Nagesh’s role at least the way he did, if not better?" [...] An anonymous source close to the production team of Kavalai Vendam (2016) described it as a [...] "modern day version" [...] of Kadhalikka Neramillai to The Times of India.|$|E
500|$|Bono is {{credited}} as the album's sole lyricist. Thematically, the album juxtaposes antipathy towards the United States against the band's deep {{fascination with the}} country, its open spaces, freedoms, and ideals. Anger is directed particularly at the perceived greed of the Ronald Reagan administration and its foreign policy in Central America. Bono said, [...] "I started to see two Americas, the mythic America and the real America", hence the album's working title, The Two Americas. Having toured the US extensively in the past, the group were inspired by the country's geography. As such, the desert, rain, dust, and water appear as lyrical motifs throughout the record. In many cases, the desert {{is used as a}} metaphor for [...] "spiritual drought". One track that chiefly represents these themes is [...] "In God's Country", which critic Barbara Jaeger interpreted as addressing America's role as the [...] "promised land". Clayton explained the impact of the desert imagery: [...] "The desert was immensely inspirational to us as a mental image for this record. Most people would take the desert on face value and think it's some kind of barren place, which of course is true. But in the right frame of mind, it's also a very positive image, because you <b>can</b> <b>actually</b> <b>do</b> something with blank canvas, which is effectively what the desert is." ...|$|E

After its morning bath Bartley was called in, and allowed to revere the baby's mottled and dimpled back as it lay face downward on the nurse's lap, feebly wiggling its arms and legs, and responding with ineffectual little sighs and gurgles to her acceptable rubbings with warm flannel. When it was fully dressed, and its long clothes pulled snugly down, and its limp person stiffened into something tenable, he was suffered to take it into his arms, and to walk the room with it. After all, {{there is not much}} that a man <b>can</b> <b>actually</b> <b>do</b> with a small baby, either for its pleasure or his own, and Barkley's usefulness had its strict limitations. He was perhaps most beneficial when he put the child in its mother's arms, and sat down beside the bed, and quietly talked, while Marcia occasionally put up a slender hand, and smoothed its golden brown hair, bending her neck over to look at it where it lay, with the action of a mother bird. They examined with minute interest the details of the curious little creature: its tiny finger-nails, fine and sharp, and its small queer fist doubled so tight, and closing on one's finger like a canary's claw on a perch; the absurdity of its foot, the absurdity of its toes, the ridiculous inadequacy of its legs and arms to the work ordinarily expected of legs and arms, made them laugh. They could not tell yet whether its eyes would be black like Marcia's, or blue like Bartley's; those long lashes had the sweep of hers, but its mop of hair, which made it look so odd and old, was more like his in color.|$|E

40|$|Abstract The {{cortical}} gel {{layer of}} nerve fibers has {{the properties of}} a cationexchanger. Hence, this layer <b>can,</b> and <b>actually</b> <b>does,</b> undergo a reversible abrupt structural change when monovalent cations (e. g. Na +) are substituted for the divalent counter-ions (e. g. Ca 2 +). This structural change brings about a sudden rise in the water content of the layer which in turn produces a large enhancement of cation mobilities accompanied by a shift of ion-selectivity in favor of hydrophilic cations. Based on these grounds, {{it is argued that}} the electrophysiological processes known as “nerve excitation and conduction ” are, basically, manifestations of abrupt structural changes in the cortical gel layer. In recent studies, we have shown that several aspects of the excitation phenomena <b>can</b> <b>actually</b> be reproduced by using synthetic polyanionic hydrogels in place of living nervous tissues. It is noted that these studies of synthetic model systems lead us {{to a better understanding of}} the process of divalent-monovalent cation-exchange in natural and artificial polyanionic gels...|$|R

40|$|Deduction modulo {{consists}} in presenting a theory through rewrite rules to support automatic and interactive proof search. It induces proof search methods based on narrowing, {{such as the}} polarized resolution modulo. We show how to combine this method with more traditional ordering restrictions.

We also show that some simplification rules, such as strict subsumption eliminations and demodulations, preserve completeness. For this purpose, we use a new framework based on a proof ordering. These results show that polarized resolution modulo can be integrated into existing provers, where these restrictions and simplifications are present.
