40|$|International audienceOn-demand video {{streaming}} applications are attracting an ever-growing {{number of users}} on the Internet. As new terminals, and especially mobile ones, give their users the ability to film and edit videos, {{it is necessary to}} provide efficient and scalable solutions that enable users to share their creations with as many users as they want. Traditional client-server-based {{video streaming}} solutions can no longer cope with the ever-increasing number of users as they incur highly expensive bandwidth provision cost on the server. This paper addresses these issues for on-demand video streaming by proposing a dual spatially-organized peer-to-peer network. The idea is to distribute video streaming load by allowing real-time cache sharing between peers that are viewing approximately the same portion of the stream. Compared to existing P 2 P video streaming solutions, our solution (1) provides higher efficiency by connecting users who are watching almost the same part of the video, thus increasing the chance of finding missing video chunks at neighboring users, (2) reduces inter-ISP video traffic by <b>privileging</b> <b>content</b> exchange among peers within the same ISP network, and (3) provides incentives to share content by providing different service levels to users with different contributions to the system.

40|$|Movidos pela busca de uma sociedade mais justa, livre e igualitária, os homens das Luzes, ao longo do século XVIII, engajaram-se em alastrar o saber científico e cultivado entre as massas populares, para que estas, "esclarecidas" a respeito de suas próprias capacidades e interesses, pudessem participar, com autonomia, da vida econômica, política e {{cultural}} das nações. Este artigo examina as propostas para uma educação pública, gratuita e universal, elaboradas respectivamente por Diderot, diretor da Enciclopédia, e Condorcet, membro da Assembléia legislativa na França revolucionária, focalizando as relações entre os degraus superiores e mais elementares do ensino. A renovação dos conteúdos tradicionais, privilegiando o estudo das "ciências e artes", aplicáveis à vida prática, e a implementação de uma didática que preserva o rigor do saber teórico simplificando sua linguagem, evidencia os alcances e limites do acesso universal formalmente garantido aos homens comuns. O exame dos ideais educacionais que norteiam o percurso da instrução pública indica um descompasso entre a conceituação liberal da ascensão pelo mérito e a vocação democratizante, que tem em perspectiva uma convivência social erguida sobre o livre entrelaçamento entre talentos, saberes, gostos dos indivíduos. Along the XVIIIth century {{prompted by}} {{their quest for}} a fairer, freer and more egalitarian society, {{the men of the}} Enlightenment got involved in spreading scientific and cultivated knowledge among the masses. They thought these, once enlightened about their own capacities and interests, could autonomously partake in the economical, political and social life of their nations. Focusing on the relationships between the highest and lowest degrees of education, this paper explores the proposals Diderot, then director of the Encyclopedia, and Condorcet, then a member of the Legislative Assembly of the Revolutionary France, respectively elaborated for a universal, free public education. The renewal of the traditional <b>contents</b> to <b>privilege</b> the studies of "arts and sciences", which may be applied to practical life, and the implementation of didactics that, albeit simplifying its language, would preserve the rigor the theoretical knowledge both reveal the range and limits of this universal access formally guaranteed to common men. Scrutinizing the educational ideas that stake out the course of public education shows a gap between the liberal conceptualization of promotion through merit and the democratizing vocation, which aims at a social coexistence built upon the free intertwining of people's talents, knowledge and tastes...|$|R
40|$|Two centuries after Marbury v. Madison, {{there remains}} a deep {{confusion}} about quite what a court is reviewing when it engages in judicial review. Conventional wisdom has it that judicial review is the review of certain legal objects: statutes, regulations. But strictly speaking, this is not quite right. The Constitution prohibits not objects but actions. Judicial review is the review of such actions. And actions require actors: verbs require subjects. So before judicial review focuses on verbs, let alone objects, it should begin at the beginning, with subjects. Every constitutional inquiry should begin with a basic question that has been almost universally overlooked. The fundamental question, from which all else follows, is the who question: who has violated the Constitution? As judicial review is practiced today, courts skip over this bedrock question {{to get to the}} more familiar question: how was the Constitution violated? But {{it makes no sense to}} ask how, until there is an answer to who. Indeed, in countless muddled lines of doctrine, puzzlement about the predicates of constitutional violation follows directly from more fundamental confusion about the subjects. Confusion about the who (and, relatedly, the when) of constitutional violation has been the root cause of many of the deepest puzzles of federal jurisdiction—puzzles of ripeness, of standing, of severability, of “facial” and “as-applied” challenges. Simply by focusing attention on this crucial constitutional feature, the subjects of the Constitution, these puzzles may be solved once and for all. And as they are solved, it becomes clear that this approach constitutes a new model of judicial review. But the implications of this new paradigm are not limited to federal jurisdiction. It turns out that confusion over the deep puzzles of federal jurisdiction has had subtle but profound feedback effects on substantive constitutional doctrine as well. Once these jurisdictional puzzles are solved, the scope of constitutional rights and powers comes into new focus as well. These implications ripple through the most important and controversial doctrines of constitutional law, from the scope of the Commerce Clause to the reach of the First Amendment, from the meaning of equal protection to the <b>content</b> of <b>privileges</b> and immunities, from the nature of due process to the shape of abortion rights. And all of it derives from nothing more complicated than asking the right first question: who has violated the Constitution...|$|R
40|$|While {{examining}} {{a selection of}} plays centred on the phenomenon of mothering, my thesis also investigates the interaction between theatre and feminism in post-war Britain, aiming to highlight mutual correspondences between women's theatre making and feminist agendas. I focus mainly on the period of second-wave feminism, but I also discuss the decade preceding {{the appearance of the}} Women's Liberation Movement, as well as its aftermath up to the mid-nineties. Scrutinising proto-feminist, feminist and post-feminist stances, I argue that several fifties women dramatists anticipated key concerns of the late sixties and seventies; and equally, that many playwrights active after the heyday of second-wave feminism revisited the climate of the seventies in an attempt to evaluate the transformations that have since occurred in women's lives. In this manner, I not only contextualise some of the major achievements and shortcomings of successive feminist interventions, but also elaborate on key changes that have taken place in the negotiation of dramatic form and <b>content.</b> Rather than <b>privileging</b> one dominant theoretical position and adopting its perspective for the purposes of my analysis, I connect the work of playwrights informed by different artistic positions and political convictions, in order to pinpoint the principle of co-existence and multiplicity. This aesthetic and ideological diversity in women's writing for the stage, characteristic of the past five decades, has been confirmed not only by the primary and secondary sources that I drew upon but also by the playwrights themselves, whom I interviewed. For most present-day female dramatists, as this thesis argues, contemporary British women's theatre is a space of experimentation and of confluence - in which the broad range of individual voices can situate themselves next to one another, without the urge to replicate an ultimate direction imposed by hegemonic political constraints or artistic platforms...|$|R
40|$|West-Fever is a large-format, glossy book {{published}} {{to commemorate the}} tenth anniversary of the Autry Museum of Western Heritage. In its first decade the Autry {{has emerged as a}} growing presence in western history and art through an impressive record of acquisitions. (Its collection now numbers some 40, 000 pieces, including some truly major objects: John Gast 2 ̆ 7 s 1872 painting, American Progress, and Thomas Moran 2 ̆ 7 s Mountain of the Holy Cross, 1874, to name just two.) The museum has sponsored and participated in a variety of important exhibitions, and now, it seems, it aspires to enhance its reputation through a new emphasis on publishing, a welcome development which should solidify its reputation as a serious institution. Commissioning Brian Dippie, a well-respected scholar of western history and art, to write West-Fever is an important start in this direction. The text is a relatively short but excellent consideration of the various ways the West has been constructed as a mythic ideal in the American imagination. Loosely structuring his narrative around the life of cowboy artist Charles M. Russell, Dippie (the author of a number of fine books, including several on Russell) expertly weaves his tale through dozens of artists and authors, novels, paintings, films, movie cowboys, and advertisements that have shaped both our understandings and misunderstandings of that most compelling and elusive region, the West. Drawing upon a wide array of scholarship, carefully acknowledged in informative endnotes, Dippie examines a large body of important western themes recurring in a variety of media: space, the hero, the chase, the quest, the standoff, and the like. These are amply illustrated by many of the Autry Museum 2 ̆ 7 s fine holdings, allowing Dippie to demonstrate both the celebratory treatments and the more recent, revisionist temperings of the West and its history. The volume 2 ̆ 7 s popularizing format makes this especially important; the West 2 ̆ 7 s 2 ̆ 2 longer, grimmer, but more interesting story 2 ̆ 2 has been accept-ed by most scholars for some time, but tarnishing the cherished myth has met with remarkable resistance from the public. Managing to bridge the gap quite neatly, Dippie maintains much of the allure of the subject even as he freely acknowledges its artifice. He reminds without preaching that the West has always been and still is a complicated place, and any understanding of it must be intricately,multi-faceted. Looking toward 2 ̆ 2 an inclusive West, 2 ̆ 2 he recognizes that we must make 2 ̆ 2 room for the Old as well as the New, the mythic as well as the mundane-for comedy as well as tragedy. 2 ̆ 2 Although I enjoyed the text {{and the quality of the}} accompanying reproductions and expect they will appeal to both specialists and lay-readers alike, I found the book 2 ̆ 7 s layout disconcertingly slick, like that of a travel guide or a flashy corporate annual report. Though I admit to being more used to reading books that <b>privilege</b> <b>content</b> over design, West-Fever 2 ̆ 7 s emphasis on glossiness seems overdone, even gimicky. Presumably to make the book appealing to the coffeetabler, the text often wraps around photographs or shines out from black pages, and images are often 2 ̆ 2 cut-out 2 ̆ 2 from their backgrounds or placed at odd diagonals, orjust as disturbing-spread across two pages and thus broken by the book 2 ̆ 7 s gutter. Surely there is middle ground between serious content and good design which will do justice to the importance of the subject and appeal as well to the popular reader. If the Autry Museum can inhabit that middle ground and continue to sponsor serious scholars to write its books, it will go a long way towards contributing to the literature on western history and art...|$|R
40|$|Marulić is {{a writer}} at the {{watershed}} of ages and worlds, inhabiting a world of divergent cultural and social tendencies. Two traditions, the Christian and the Ancient, jointly underpin his work. Hence {{with respect to the}} ancient heritage, there is a clear discordance in his work: the frequently stated rejection of antiquity is at odds with the places where he enjoins and practices a positive attitude to the ancient world. Thus from the oeuvre as a whole two apparently opposed Marulićs emerge. On the one hand we can find a Marulić who recommends the reading of the books of the pagan writers, adopting and internalising anything in them that can lead to a virtuous life. He himself from his youth read, acquired and made extracts from them. He avidly collected and explained ancient epigraphs, worked on mythological themes in his poetic works (which greatly outnumber those based on religious topics). Even when he formally renounces the Muses and Apollo, he cannot do without the »poetic vanities«, even in the handling of Christian themes. He ornaments his poems, enhancing them with deliberate or unconscious reminiscences of antiquity, using the terminology and stereotyped expressions of Classical poetry. This is the Marulić who adores antiquity and for whom »ancient and exalted poets« have canonical value. On the other hand there is the Marulić who programmatically rejects Graeco-Roman antiquity, who expresses open hostility to the poetic inventions and saws of the pagans, who asks his readers totally to disassociate themselves from the inutile pleasure of the reading of such works, who enjoins silence about the acuity of the philosophers, contempt for their madness and the reading of only what shows us the path to immortality. From the times of the apostles, via the apologetes and the early church fathers, the confusing and paradoxical attitude to the pagan and to the ancient literary heritage had been a constant, ranging from total withdrawal from all that is pagan, to concessions and the quotation of classical authors (in the text, for the sake of illustration, some thoughts of Augustine, St Jerome and Basil the Great are quoted). In the Renaissance the idolisation of Antiquity was additionally stressed, and this, as it were, cult of Antiquity, gave rise to fierce contention, even to the opinion that Christians must not only not read ancient writers and poets, but should even burn their works in public. As well as the stances of the 5 th Lateran Council and Pope Pius II against the pagan heritage, the reactions of Giovanni Dominici, Bernard of Siena, Girolamo Savanarola, Benedetto Accolti, Erasmus and Marulić himself are cited. The conclusion concerning the reasons why Marulić fought shy of the classical heritage is drawn from his own words. He is reacting to a very widespread and in his opinion deleterious phenomenon: many admire the ancient worshippers of false gods and, captivated by the vacuous eloquence of the pagan poets, relish invented stories more than the doctrine of truth; they think that nothing can be believed that the human mind itself cannot investigate and, adds Marulić, hardened in their perversion even make mock of Christian belief. What is more, he warns, some church scholars have abandoned the gospels and are dealing with unimportant things: they philosophise or sing poetic inventions instead of exploring what would contribute to the salvation of souls. Was this viewpoint of his a reaction to a kind of almost imposed fashion – according to which everything coloured with Antiquity is advanced and an inclination to the Classics an expression of elitism – is not easy to answer. Certainly Marulić valued the acuity and wisdom of the pagans, the polish of their speech and the mellifluousness of their poems. But, sub specie aeternitatis and of salvation he does not see their usefulness, and thus calls for »pagan foolishness« to be cast aside, the wisdom that we are taught not by man but by God to be adopted. From all this it can be concluded that Marulić was not exclusively a religious writer, as he is understood to be in the receptive stereotype. Rather, a complex personality is reflected from his oeuvre: a European intellectual of wide horizons, a real representative of humanism, an outstanding connoisseur and admirer of the writing of Ancient classics. In reception and emission he communicates with the European cultural community; in his creative work he respects its taste and adapts himself to the poetic postulates of the age, and endeavours to suffuse the Biblical revelation and Christian spirituality with ancient wisdom and poetics. He incorporates elements of the ancient heritage into his works without any fears that the exalted Biblical themes will be contaminated with the profane and pagan poetic superstructure. However, he does state his opinion resolutely and unambiguously concerning phenomena that he considers to be a distortion of the equilibrium, to be exaggerated and dangerous antiquisation, inversion of the scale of values and replacement of the essential by the dispensable. He specifically rejects such a tradition as an artefact of the pre-Christian religion, he <b>privileges</b> <b>content</b> over form, truth over revealed truth, the eternal and the divine over the earthly and transient, the salvation of the soul to the acquisition of vain poetic fame, divine wisdom concealed in the mystery, revealed in the Gospel and incarnated in Christ to human ingenuity. The duality of Marulić noted can be understood only in the light of an endeavour to establish a balance and for a hierarchy of values in the perspective of eternal bliss. Marulićevo djelo suodređuju dvije tradicije, kršćanska i antička, što je rezultiralo problematičnom dvojnošću.

To očito nesuglasje traži interpretativno rješenje, i to ponajprije pomnim čitanjem samoga Marulićeva opusa u svjetlu povijesnoga konteksta. Ovdje se predstavljaju oba Marulićeva lika, zatim prilike i tendencije vremena u kojem je Splićanin stvarao, te se najposlije u samim njegovim tekstovima pobliže traži objašnjenje dvaju oprečnih stavova spram antičkoj baštini...|$|R
