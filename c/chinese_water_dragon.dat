50|$|Native to {{the lowland}} and {{highland}} forests of southern China and southeastern Asia (Thailand, Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia and Burma), <b>Chinese</b> <b>water</b> <b>dragons</b> are most commonly found {{along the banks}} of freshwater lakes and streams. They are active during the day (diurnal), and {{spend most of their time}} in the trees or plants (arboreal). If threatened, the dragon will drop from the trees into the water and either swim to safety or remain submerged for up to 90 minutes. <b>Water</b> <b>dragons</b> live in areas with average humidity levels of 40-80% and temperatures ranging from 80-90 °F (26-32 °C).|$|R

5000|$|Like {{many other}} {{reptiles}} the <b>Chinese</b> <b>water</b> <b>dragon</b> possesses a small, iridescent, photosensitive spot between their eyes {{referred to as}} the pineal eye (or parietal eye, or colloquially as the third eye) that is thought to help thermoregulate their bodies by sensing differences in light to assist with [...] and seeking shelter after sunset. Since it recognizes differences in light, the parietal eye can also help the lizard avoid predation from birds and other aerial threats, and can awaken from deep sleep from even slight changes in light from overhead. These animals are very docile and allow physical activity.|$|E
50|$|<b>Chinese</b> <b>water</b> <b>dragons</b> {{can grow}} up to 1 m in total length, {{including}} tail, and can live from ten to fifteen years. Coloration ranges from dark to light green, or sometimes purple with an orange stomach. Diagonal stripes of green or turquoise are found on the body, while the tail is banded from the middle to the end with green and white. Their undersides range from white, off white, very pale green, or pale yellow. But their throats {{are considered to be}} more attractive, which can be quite colorful (blue and purple, or peach), some with a single color, some with stripes. Adult males have larger, more triangular heads than females, and develop larger crests on the head, neck and tail, and are larger in general. The tail, slightly over two-thirds of the entire body length, {{can be used as a}} weapon, for balance, and to assist swimming.|$|R

5000|$|Similar {{to the use}} of {{outrigger}} canoes or Polynesian va'a, racing dragon boating has a rich {{fabric of}} ancient ceremonial, ritualistic and religious traditions, and thus, the modern competitive aspect is but one small part of this complex water craftsmanship. The use of dragon boats for racing and dragons are believed by scholars, sinologists, and anthropologists to have originated in southern central China more than 2500 years ago, in Dongting Lake and {{along the banks of the}} Chang Jiang (now called the Yangtze) during the same era when the games of ancient Greece were being established at Olympia). [...] Dragon boat racing has been practiced continuously since this period as the basis for annual water rituals and festival celebrations and for the traditional veneration of the <b>Chinese</b> <b>dragon</b> <b>water</b> deity. The celebration was an important part of the ancient Chinese agricultural society, celebrating the summer rice planting. Dragon boat racing was historically situated in the Chinese subcontinent's southern-central [...] "rice bowl"; where there were rice paddies, so were there dragon boats.|$|R

50|$|There are two subspecies; Intellagama lesueurii lesueurii (eastern <b>water</b> <b>dragon)</b> and I. l. howitti (Gippsland <b>water</b> <b>dragon).</b> I. l. lesueurii tends towards white, {{yellow and}} red on the throat and {{possesses}} a dark band behind its eye; I. l. howitti lacks this and instead has dark bands {{on either side of}} its throat, which is blotched with yellow, orange, or blue. Both subspecies are light greenish grey in overall colour with black bands running across their back, tail and legs. The <b>water</b> <b>dragon</b> can slowly change skin colour to aid its camouflage. The skin will shed during periods of growth.|$|R
