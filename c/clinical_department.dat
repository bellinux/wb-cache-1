The specialist qualification may be conferred as a Fellowship by the independent Colleges of Medicine of South Africa (CMSA), following British tradition, or as a Magisterial degree by the university (usually the M Med, Master of Medicine, degree). The Medical schools and the CMSA also offer Higher Diplomas in many fields. Research degrees are the M.Med and Ph.D. or M.D., depending on university.|$|E

40|$|Background: In clerkships, {{students}} are expected to self-regulate their learning. How <b>clinical</b> <b>departments</b> and their routine approach on clerkships influences students' self-regulated learning (SRL) is unknown. Aim: This study explores how characteristic routines of <b>clinical</b> <b>departments</b> influence medical students' SRL. Methods: Six focus groups including 39 purposively sampled participants from one Dutch university were organized to study how characteristic routines of <b>clinical</b> <b>departments</b> influenced medical students' SRL from a constructivist paradigm, using grounded theory methodology. The focus groups were audio recorded, transcribed verbatim and were analyzed iteratively using constant comparison and open, axial and interpretive coding. Results: Students described that <b>clinical</b> <b>departments</b> influenced their SRL through routines which affected the professional relationships they could engage in and affected their perception of a department's invested effort in them. Students' SRL in a clerkship can be supported by enabling them to engage others in their SRL and by having them feel that effort is invested in their learning. Conclusions: Our study gives a practical insight in how <b>clinical</b> <b>departments</b> influenced students' SRL. <b>Clinical</b> <b>departments</b> can affect students' motivation to engage in SRL, influence the variety of SRL strategies that students can use and how meaningful students perceive their SRL experiences to b...|$|R

30|$|A notable {{advantage}} {{of the present study}} is the representativeness of the pediatric admissions data. Through support from the HIE network of Shanghai, we included data from three pediatric hospitals for a total 10, 000 outpatient and 2000 emergency admissions, covering over 75 % of the total pediatric admissions of Shanghai during the study period. The main limitation of this study is the high degree of heterogeneity of the hospital admission data, because the data collected from the HIE network were not well organized into different <b>clinical</b> <b>departments.</b> Thus, we did not analyze the associations between environment measurements and admissions to <b>clinical</b> <b>departments.</b> Different <b>clinical</b> <b>departments</b> dealing with different diseases have different admission trends and different responses to adverse environmental conditions (Fig  2). Regression analysis for total hospital admissions was therefore missing many details of such associations.|$|R
