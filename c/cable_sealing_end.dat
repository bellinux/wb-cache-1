40|$|The {{knowledge}} of ground return current in fault occurrence {{plays a key}} role in the dimensioning of the earthing grid of substations and of <b>cable</b> <b>sealing</b> <b>end</b> compounds, in the computation of rise of earth potential at substation sites and in electromagnetic interference (EMI) on neighbouring parallel metallic conductors (pipes, handrails, etc.). Moreover, the ground return current evaluation is also important in steady-state regime since this stray current can be responsible for EMI and also for alternating current (AC) corrosion. In fault situations and under some assumptions, the ground return current value at a substation site can be computed by means of k-factors. The paper shows that these simplified and approximated approaches have a lot of limitations and only multiconductor analysis can show the ground return current behaviour along the cable (not only the two end values) both in steady-state regime and in short circuit occurrence (e. g., phase-to-ground and phase-to-phase-to-ground). Multiconductor cell analysis (MCA) considers the cable system in its real asymmetry without simplified and approximated hypotheses. The sensitivity of ground return current on circuit parameters (cross-bonding box resistances, substation earthing resistances, soil resistivity) is presented in the paper...|$|E
40|$|A {{technique}} is described for making dielectric spectroscopy measurements of very small quantities (< 1 μl) of oil. The technique utilises surface tension {{to hold the}} oil between the plates of a capacitor, the inter-electrode distance being controlled by a micrometer.

40|$|We {{establish}} {{conditions under}} which the input impedance and its first two derivatives, evaluated at the origin, uniquely determine the axial resistance, membrane capacitance, and membrane conductance of a finite uniform <b>cable</b> with one <b>sealed</b> <b>end.</b> We argue that this impedance data is readily available to the experimentalist and we demonstrate the recovery of a cable's electrical parameters from synthetic noisy measurements. 1. Introduction In the classical cable model of a dendritic neuron, see, e. g., Rall [R 1 [...] 2], one assumes that the potential difference, v, across the surface (membrane) of the neuron and the current, i, traveling along the neuron's axis satisfy v x (x; t) = (x; t) (1 : 1) i x (x; t) = v t (x; t) Γ Gv(x; t) (1 : 2) where 0 ! x ! `; the length (cm) of the cylinder, and the coefficients are R = 4 R a d 2; C = Cmd; and G = Gmd: Here d is the diameter (cm) of the cylinder, R a is the axial resistance(Ω cm), Cm is the membrane capacitance (F [...] ...|$|R
40|$|The cable {{equation}} is solved in the Laplace transform domain for arbitrary initial and boundary conditions. The cable potential is expressed directly {{in terms of}} the impedance of the terminations and the cable electrotonic length. A computer program is given to invert the transform. Numerical solutions may be obtained for any particular model by inserting expressions describing the terminations and parameter values into the program, without further computation by the modeler. For a finite length <b>cable,</b> <b>sealed</b> at one <b>end,</b> the solution is expressed {{in terms of the}} ratio of the termination impedance to the impedance of the finite length cable, a generalization of the steady-state conductance ratio. Analysis of a model of a soma with several primary dendrites shows that the dendrites may be lumped into one equivalent cylinder if they have the same electrotonic length, even though they may vary in diameter. Responses obtained under voltage clamp are conceptually predictable from measurements made under current clamp, and vice versa. The equalizing time constants of an infinite series expression of the solution are the negative reciprocals of the roots of the characteristic equation. Examination of computed solutions shows that solutions which differ theoretically may be indistinguishable experimentally...|$|R

The {{non-contact}} mechanical <b>seal</b> <b>end</b> faces opening friction condition {{detection and}} {{the measurement of}} film thickness when the end faces is just-lift-off, which are always key problems for scholars engaged in sealing industry for many years, {{but there is no}} effective solution. Acoustic emission(AE) signal generated in the running process of mechanical <b>seal</b> <b>end</b> faces has a plenty of information about the faces contact state. According to this, the thickness measurement of mechanical seal and opening condition monitoring technology by using particle filter are put forward based on the acoustic emission signal. Acoustic emission sensor is installed in the stationary ring seat, used for the indirect outer detection of the dynamic and stationary rings opening condition. The acoustic emission signals are processed by particle filter technology, and then the signal features are extracted in time domain, frequency domain and wavelet packet energy. A BP neural network model is established, the features of signal characteristic used as input of the model. It is finally realized that the mechanical <b>seal</b> <b>end</b> faces opening condition was recognized and the film thickness was measured. Eddy current sensor is installed inside the stationary ring and used for direct measurement of film thickness and verify the results got from the BP neural network.

In the {{acoustic}} emission (AE) detection for mechanical seal, the main difficulty {{is to reduce the}} background noise and to classify the dispersed features. To solve these problems and achieve higher detection rates, a new approach based on genetic particle filter with autoregression (AR-GPF) and hypersphere support vector machine (HSSVM) is presented. First, AR model is used to build the dynamic state space (DSS) of the AE signal, and GPF is used for signal filtering. Then, multiple features are extracted, and a classification model based on HSSVM is constructed for state recognition. In this approach, AR-GPF is an excellent time-domain method for noise reduction, and HSSVM has advantage on those dispersed features. Finally experimental data shows that the proposed method can effectively detect the contact state of the <b>seal</b> <b>end</b> faces and has higher accuracy rates than some other existing methods...|$|R

40|$|High {{performance}} turbomachinery often experiences severe {{dynamic loads}} that produce large amplitude rotor motions. Well-engineered squeeze film dampers (SFDs) provide adequate damping to ameliorate rotor vibrations {{and to ensure}} system reliability. Open ends SFDs are prone to air ingestion during large amplitude rotor whirl motions and high excitation frequencies, all the while demanding of a significant flowrate, an undesirable operating feature. Piston ring (PR) <b>end</b> <b>seals</b> are commonly installed in SFDs in aircraft engines to amplify the available damping while reducing the demand of oil flowrate and also to avoid air ingestion. This dissertation investigates experimentally the dynamic forced performance of a SFD with a short land length (L/D= 0. 2), nominal clearance 0. 254 mm and lubricant supplied via three orifice feed holes (?= 2. 5 mm). There are two configurations, one has its ends open to ambient while the other has <b>sealed</b> <b>ends</b> with PRs. The dynamic load tests are of three types (single frequency, sine-sweep frequency dynamic loads and impact loads). Single frequency dynamic load tests reveal that the piston ring <b>end</b> <b>seals</b> effectively reduce leakage through {{the ends of the}} film land; thus the sealed SFD provides 11 - 13 times more damping coefficient and eleven times more added mass coefficients than those provided by an open ends SFD configuration. Further tests of two PR <b>sealed</b> <b>ends</b> SFDs (one with a seal flow conductance = 0. 56 LPM/bar, and the other with = 0. 89 LPM/bar) operated at a supply pressure Pin- 1 ~ 0. 69 barg, show that small differences on their damping and added mass coefficients are within the measurement uncertainty range. The second pair of piston rings (Cave-S 2 >Cave-S 1) has a larger slit gap than the first pair, hence providing a lesser flow resistance. The effect of lubricant supply pressure on the <b>sealed</b> <b>ends</b> SFD force coefficients is also quantified experimentally by increasing the lubricant supply pressure by a factor of four (Pin- 1 ~ 0. 69 barg?Pin- 2 ~ 2. 76 barg). For the <b>sealed</b> <b>ends</b> SFD with Cave-S 1 and Pin- 2 ~ 2. 76 barg, both the damping and added mass coefficients show a ~ 20 % increase compared to those coefficients from the damper supplied with a low oil feed pressure (Pin- 1 ~ 0. 69 barg). Further experiments with the sine-sweep frequency dynamic load tests aim to validate the SFD force coefficients identified from a single-frequency dynamic load. The estimated SFD damping and inertia force coefficients from a sine-sweep frequency load tests with a low time rate of change in sine-sweep excitation frequency ?= 6. 5 Hz/s agree with the coefficients obtained from a single-frequency dynamic load over the same test conditions while substantially reducing the time of data collection. Furthermore, single impact load tests are performed to quantify their effect on the response of an elastically supported open <b>ends</b> SFD and <b>sealed</b> <b>ends</b> SFD. Test system transient responses due to a single impact show the peak amplitude of motion (ZMAX) is proportional to the magnitude of applied load (FMAX). The identified system damping ratio (?) is proportional to the peak dynamic displacement as a linear system shows. The dissertation discloses the full detail of the test dampers geometry and the experimental results which will provide a design reference to the practitioners...|$|R

The mechanical seal acoustic emission signal present obvious characteristics of time-varying nonlinear and pulsating.
