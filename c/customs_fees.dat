This control of the cotton market also allowed him to gain unofficial control over all of the Sidon Eyalet, outside the city of Sidon itself. With mixed success, Zahir attempted to have French merchant ships redirected from the ports of Tyre and Sidon to Haifa instead, in order {{to benefit from the}} <b>customs</b> <b>fees</b> he could exact. The city of Acre underwent an economic boom {{as a result of its}} position in the cotton trade with France, and became the fortified headquarters of Zahir's sheikhdom.|$|E

25|$|Other small incomes {{came from}} <b>customs</b> <b>fees</b> and fines. In {{times of war}} a special tax was levied on rich {{citizens}}. These citizens were also charged permanently with other taxes {{for the good of}} the city. This was called the system of liturgy. The taxes were used to maintain the triremes which gave Athens great naval power and to pay and maintain a chorus for large religious festivals. It is believed that rich Athenian men saw it as an honor to sponsor the triremes (probably because they became leaders of it for the period they supported it) or the festivals and they often engaged in competitive donating.|$|E
25|$|Jean de La Forêt {{negotiated}} the capitulations on 18 February 1536, {{on the model}} of previous Ottoman commercial treaties with Venice and Genoa, although they only seem to have been ratified by the Ottomans later, in 1569, with ambassador Claude Du Bourg. These capitulations allowed the French to obtain important privileges, such as the security of the people and goods, extraterritoriality, freedom to transport and sell goods in exchange for the payment of the selamlik and <b>customs</b> <b>fees.</b> These capitulations would in effect give the French a near trade monopoly in the Orient. Foreign vessels had to trade with Turkey under the French banner, after the payment of a percentage of their trade.|$|E

25|$|In August 2003, Egypt and Libya {{signed a}} trade and customs {{agreement}} that removed <b>customs</b> <b>fees</b> on commodities {{and established a}} mechanism for settling trade disputes.

Trade between the two countries grew 39% in 2007 to $267m. There are now plans to establish an Egyptian-Libyan border free trade zone that would include industrial, warehousing, trade and tourism projects. In July 2008 Hosni Mubarak and Muammar Gaddafi met in Tripoli to discuss ways of promoting Egyptian-Libyan relations, especially in oil, gas and investment sector. The Egyptian Minister of Investment met with Libyan counterparts to discuss ways in enhance trade and investment between the two countries.|$|E
25|$|Lilís's {{dictatorship}} {{was dependent}} upon heavy borrowing from European and American banks to enrich himself, stabilize the existing debt, strengthen the bribe system, {{pay for the}} army, finance infrastructural development and help set up sugar mills. However, sugar prices underwent a steep decline {{in the last two}} decades of the 19th century. When the Westendorp Co. went bankrupt in 1893, he was forced to mortgage the nation's <b>customs</b> <b>fees,</b> the main source of government revenues, to a New York financial firm called the San Domingo Improvement Co. (SDIC), which took over its railroad contracts and the claims of its European bondholders in exchange for two loans, one of $1.2 million and the other of £2 million. As the growing public debt made it impossible to maintain his political machine, Heureaux relied on secret loans from the SDIC, sugar planters and local merchants. In 1897, with his government virtually bankrupt, Lilís printed five million uninsured pesos, known as papeletas de Lilís, ruining most Dominican merchants and inspiring a conspiracy that ended in his death. In 1899, when Lilís was assassinated by the Cibao tobacco merchants whom he had been begging for a loan, the national debt was over $35 million, fifteen times the annual budget.|$|E

2500|$|Tax is {{collected}} mainly from municipal income tax, state income tax, state value added tax, <b>customs</b> <b>fees,</b> corporate taxes and special taxes. There are also property taxes, but municipal income tax pays most of municipal expenses. Taxation is {{conducted by a}} state agency, Verohallitus, which collects income taxes from each paycheck, and then pays the difference between tax liability and taxes paid as tax rebate or collects as tax arrears afterward. Municipal income tax is a flat tax of nominally 15-20%, with deductions applied, and directly funds the municipality (a city or rural locality). The state income tax is a progressive tax; low-income individuals do not necessarily pay any. The state transfers some of its income as state support to municipalities, particularly the poorer ones. [...] Additionally, the state churches - Finnish Evangelical Lutheran Church and Finnish Orthodox Church - are integrated to the taxation system in order to tax their members.|$|E

On the other hand, the company was exempt of paying contributions, taxes and <b>custom</b> <b>fees.</b> The railway company had also to carry the post for free.

Registration of religious groups is not required in Slovakia; however, under existing law, only registered religious groups have the explicit right to conduct public worship services and other activities, although no specific religions or practices are banned or discouraged by the authorities in practice. Those that register receive government benefits, including subsidies for clergymen, office expenses, the right to visit and proselytize in prisons and hospitals, and access to public television broadcasting. Government funding also is provided to religious schools and to teachers who lecture on religion in state schools.

In 1761 Matthew Brettingham the elder published The Plans, Elevations and Sections, Of Holkham in Norfolk in which he down played the role of Kent in the design of the House. The 2nd edition of 1773 by Brettingham the Younger corrected the first edition and gave due weight to Lord Burlington's and Kent's roles in the design process. The correspondence with Matthew Brettingham the younger whilst he was in Italy is extensive, there was much discussion about potential purchases of art works, their cost, shipping and <b>custom</b> <b>fees,</b> also his account book survives with detailed entries for each art work purchased.|$|R
