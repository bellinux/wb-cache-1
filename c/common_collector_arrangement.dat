25|$|The {{common emitter}} (or common source, common cathode, etc.) {{is most often}} {{configured}} to provide amplification of a voltage applied between base and emitter, and the output signal taken between collector and emitter is inverted, relative to the input. The <b>common</b> <b>collector</b> <b>arrangement</b> applies the input voltage between base and collector, and to take the output voltage between emitter and collector. This causes negative feedback, and the output voltage tends to follow the input voltage. This arrangement is also used as the input presents a high impedance and does not load the signal source, though the voltage amplification is less than one. The common-collector circuit is, therefore, better known as an emitter follower, source follower, or cathode follower.|$|E

When the presynaptic voltages are synchronously applied to the two emitters, the collector demonstrates an adding together of the excitatory post synaptic voltage (EPSV). The width and period of the two input signals constitute the code to generate spatial summation and recognition effects at the same time. Experimental results confirm that temporal summation caused by the repetitive-pulse facilitation could significantly strengthen the spatial summation effect due to the adding together behavior when the repetitive stimulations are applied to the two emitters in rapid succession. Particularly, the resonant summation effect occurs at the co-summation region when the two repetitive-pulse signals have a resonant period, which offers a more sophisticated spatiotemporal EPSV summation function for the dual-emitter neuromorphic device...|$|R

50|$|The {{original}} Schmitt trigger {{is based}} on the dynamic threshold idea that is implemented by a voltage divider with a switchable upper leg (the collector resistors RC1 and RC2) and a steady lower leg (RE). Q1 acts as a comparator with a differential input (Q1 base-emitter junction) consisting of an inverting (Q1 base) and a non-inverting (Q1 emitter) inputs. The input voltage is applied to the inverting input; the output voltage of the voltage divider is applied to the non-inverting input thus determining its threshold. The comparator output drives the second <b>common</b> <b>collector</b> stage Q2 (an emitter follower) through the voltage divider R1-R2. The emitter-coupled transistors Q1 and Q2 actually compose an electronic double throw switch that switches over the upper legs of the voltage divider and changes the threshold in a different (to the input voltage) direction.|$|R
50|$|Specifically, a 3-input NOR gate may {{consist of}} 3 bipolar {{junction}} transistors with their emitters all grounded, their collectors tied together and linked to Vcc through a load impedance. Each base is connected to an input signal, and the <b>common</b> <b>collector</b> point presents the output signal. Any input that is a 1 (high voltage) to its base shorts its transistor's emitter to its collector, causing current to flow through the load impedance, which brings the collector voltage (the output) very near to ground. That result is independent of the other inputs. Only when all 3 input signals are 0 (low voltage) do the emitter-collector impedances of all 3 transistors remain very high. Then very little current flows, and the voltage-divider effect with the load impedance imposes on the collector point a high voltage very near to Vcc.|$|R
50|$|The circuit can be {{explained}} by viewing the transistor as being under the control of negative feedback. From this viewpoint, a <b>common</b> <b>collector</b> stage (Fig. 1) is an amplifier with full series negative feedback. In this configuration (Fig. 2 with β = 1), the entire output voltage VOUT is placed contrary and in series with the input voltage VIN. Thus the two voltages are subtracted according to KVL (the subtractor from the function block diagram is implemented just by the input loop) and their difference Vdiff = VIN - VOUT is applied to the base-emitter junction. The transistor continuously monitors Vdiff and adjusts its emitter voltage almost equal (less VBEO) to the input voltage by passing the according collector current through the emitter resistor RE. As a result, the output voltage follows the input voltage variations from VBEO up to V+; hence the name, emitter follower.|$|R

In mineral concentration plants valuable minerals are rendered hydrophobic {{by the action of}} certain surface active molecules, so called collectors.

To design new, selective molecules an understanding of the fundamental reactions at the ZnS/water interface is essential. The acidic and alkaline sites of Zns have been identified by FI-IR spectroscopy. The dependence of stoichiometry and pH has been determined.
