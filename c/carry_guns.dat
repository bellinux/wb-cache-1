25|$|In March 1812 Seringapatam, still {{owned by}} William Melish {{and under the}} command of Captain William Stavers, sailed for the South Atlantic. (Her crew {{included}} John Stavers as Mate and Francis Stavers as gunner.) She then sailed towards the Galapagos Islands via Cape Horn. At the time of her capture Seringapatam did not have a letter of marque in hand as she had left before the outbreak of war with the United States and as she did not expect to encounter any French vessels. She carried 14 guns on her spar deck; she was pierced to <b>carry</b> <b>guns</b> on her gun deck, but did not carry any there. Although she did not have a letter of marque in hand, she nevertheless, on her way, captured Edward, of Nantucket, which was carrying 1200 barrels of oil, and sent her in to London as a prize. Edward was an American South Seaman, Woodward, master, and she arrived in the Downs on 14 June 1813.|$|E

25|$|The {{border area}} between Afghanistan and Pakistan {{has long been}} one of the most {{dangerous}} places in the world, due largely to very little government control. It is legal and common in the region to <b>carry</b> <b>guns,</b> and assault rifles and explosives are common. Many forms of illegal activities take place, such as smuggling of weapons, narcotics, lumber, copper, gemstones, marble, vehicles, and electronic products, as well as ordinary consumer goods. Kidnappings and murders are frequent. Numerous outsiders with extremist views came from around the Muslim world to settle in the Durand Line region over the past 30 years. While most of the time the Taliban cross the Durand Line from Afghanistan into Pakistan and carry out attacks inside Pakistani cities, sometimes they cross from the Pakistani side of the border and attack Afghan security forces. Recently, 300 Taliban militants from Afghanistan's territory launched attacks on Pakistani border posts in which 34 Pakistani security forces were believed to be killed. It is also believed Swat District Taliban leader Maulana Fazlullah is hiding somewhere inside Afghanistan. In June 2011 more than 500 Taliban militants entered Upper Dir area from Afghanistan and killed more than 30 Pakistani security forces. Police said the attackers targeted a checkpost, destroyed two schools and several houses, while killing a number of civilians.|$|E
500|$|Gun rights – The {{national}} ACLU's {{position is}} that the Second Amendment protects a collective right to own guns rather than an individual right, despite the Supreme Court's decision in District of Columbia v.

The results supported the hypotheses that both correlates and correlational strengths of <b>carrying</b> <b>guns</b> and other weapons to school for protection are different.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the relationship between}} illegal drug economy involvement, gun-related victimization, and recent <b>gun</b> <b>carrying</b> among {{young men and women}} incarcerated in a state prison in the United States. Interviews were conducted with 18 - to 25 -year old incarcerated men (n = 135) and women (n = 69) between July 1999 and October 2000. Forty-five percent of men and 16 % of women reported <b>carrying</b> a <b>gun</b> in the year prior to incarceration. Respondents who sold crack cocaine or other drugs {{were more likely to have}} <b>carried</b> <b>guns</b> than those not selling drugs. However, hard drug use was not associated with <b>gun</b> <b>carrying</b> among men. All ten women who <b>carried</b> <b>guns</b> had used hard drugs. Sixty-seven percent of men and 28 % of women had been shot at. Respondents who sold crack cocaine were at elevated risk of being shot at. Among men, selling crack (OR = 10. 2, 95 % CI = 2. 5, 42. 1) and ever being shot at (OR = 4. 6, 95 % CI = 1. 7, 12. 2), were associated with <b>carrying</b> <b>guns.</b> These findings provide further evidence of a link between crack selling (but not necessarily drug using) and <b>gun</b> <b>carrying...</b>|$|R
500|$|During the Russian war of 1788–1790, Sweden built three hemmemas {{of a new}} design. They were {{considerably}} larger, 44.5 by 11m (146 by 36ft), and {{the number}} of oars were increased to 20 pairs. They also had some of the heaviest broadsides, even when compared with the much larger frigates of the high seas navy. The artillery officer Carl Fredrik Aschling had cooperated with Chapman to increase the main armament to twenty-two 36-pounders and two 12-pounders, which increased the draft by about 30cm (1ft). The addition of diagonal bracers to reinforce the hull allowed the later hemmemas to <b>carry</b> <b>guns</b> more powerful even than those on the largest sailing frigates of the high seas navy. Due to their considerable firepower and relative size, naval historian Jan Glete has described the hemmemas as [...] "super archipelago frigates".|$|E
500|$|The calibre {{and weight}} of guns could only {{increase}} so far. The larger the gun, the slower {{it would be to}} load, the greater the stresses on the ship's hull, and the less the stability of the ship. The size of the gun peaked in the 1880s, with some of the heaviest calibres of gun ever used at sea. [...] carried two 16.25-inch (413mm) breech-loading guns, each weighing 110tons—no British battleship would ever <b>carry</b> <b>guns</b> as large. The Italian 450mm (17.72inch) guns would be larger than any gun fitted to a battleship until the 18.1-inch (460mm) armament of the Japanese [...] of World War II. [...] One consideration which became more acute was that even from the original Armstrong models, following the Crimean War, range and hitting power far exceeded simple accuracy, especially at sea where the slightest roll or pitch of the vessel as 'floating weapons-platform' could negate the advantage of rifling. [...] American ordnance experts accordingly preferred smoothbore monsters whose round shot could at least 'skip' along the surface of the water. [...] Actual effective combat ranges, they had learned during the Civil War, were comparable to those in the Age of Sail—though a vessel could now be smashed to pieces in only a few rounds. [...] Smoke and the general chaos of battle only added to the problem. As a result, many naval engagements in the 'Age of the Ironclad' were still fought at ranges within easy eyesight of their targets, and well below the maximum reach of their ships' guns.|$|E

2500|$|At the Sackets Harbor shipyard, where Eckford had a {{work force}} of over 200 {{carpenters}} by April 1813 and of over 400 by April 1814 and where he employed over 800 men by January 1815, Eckford and the Browns combined to build all US Navy men-of-war launched on Lake Ontario during the war. By 1814, the Sackets Harbor yard had converted some Great Lakes merchant vessels to <b>carry</b> <b>guns</b> and also had launched eight new purpose-built warships. [...] Among the converted ships was the sloop-of-war the new purpose-built warships ranged in size from the 89-ton schooner [...] launched in 1813, to the never-finished 3,200-ton, 106-gun ship-of-the-line , and also included the corvette [...] in 1813 and the frigate [...] in 1814. Eckford understood that the American war effort on the Great Lakes required the US Navy to keep ahead of British shipbuilding in Canada, and that speedy construction and delivery of warships was critical. Using prefabrication in New York City and on-site assembly in Sackets Harbor, he achieved what were considered breathtaking construction rates. Among the yards most spectacular feats was the rapid construction of Madison, which took only nine weeks from the cutting of her timbers, and only 45 days from keel-laying, to launch on 26 November 1812; the yard went on to beat that record in November 1814 by taking only five weeks between laying the keel of the frigate [...] and launching her. The Sackets Harbor yard also built smaller ships in record time; the schooner [...] took only 21 days from keel-laying to launch in 1813. Eckford also demonstrated a facility for dealing with labour crises, as demonstrated by an incident on 1 May 1814, when a United States Army soldier on sentry duty at Sackets Harbor shot and killed a carpenter after the launching of USS Superior, provoking an armed confrontation between soldiers and shipyard workers, who threatened to go on strike and go home, crippling American shibuilding on the Great Lakes; Eckford joined Chauncey and the US Army commander, Major General Jacob Brown, in talking {{to the men and}} defusing the situation, avoiding further violence and allowing shipyard work to continue.|$|E
