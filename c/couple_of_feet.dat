25|$|Aside {{from the}} various bowls, the most memorable moment at the stadium {{might have been the}} Saints victory over the Detroit Lions on November 8, 1970. In the NFL prior to the 1974 season, the goal posts were on the goal line instead of the end line. With seconds remaining, the Saints {{attempted}} a place kick with the holder spotting at the Saints' own 37-yard line. Kicker Tom Dempsey nailed the 63-yard field goal with a <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>feet</b> to spare, and the Saints won the game 19-17, one of only two games the Saints won that year. That record would stand alone for 28 years before it was tied by Jason Elam of the Denver Broncos, Sebastian Janikowski of the Oakland Raiders, and David Akers of the San Francisco 49ers. Late in the 2013 NFL season, Denver Broncos's kicker Matt Prater broke Dempsey's record with a 64-yard field goal against the Tennessee Titans.|$|E
500|$|... 'Bagga' Barnes {{was also}} Bill's room-mate, and his affection for his late lamented pal, a lovable rogue, was obvious. He {{recalled}} the furore over Barnes's provocative field positioning, extremely close at silly mid-on, and how {{criticism of his}} foot being {{too close to the}} mown pitch prompted him to plonk his boot a <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>feet</b> into the forbidden territory – and a <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>feet</b> more when the English crowd roared at him.|$|E
2500|$|A long-held theory {{proposes that}} {{watering}} and salt licking animals were {{driven to the}} wall's gaps, where waiting hunters had an advantage over the [...] "herded" [...] game. On bottom land near Mount Carbon, excavations in 1961–62 dated their finds back to about the 6th century CE and other finds to the 16th-century Fort Ancient occupation. The nearby Robson Mound {{was reported to have}} been a stone and earthen mound of about fifty five feet in height, before fortune hunters reduced it to a <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>feet,</b> long before modern science arrived. The nearby Dempsey Mound in Fayette County, along Laurel Creek, was also reduced before modern science arrived. Beards Fork Petroglyphs are a few miles away. The site at Alloy in Fayette County, 46FA189, is a Woodland occupation site.|$|E
60|$|With added caution Dave crept forward another <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> hundred <b>feet.</b> Then {{he stopped}} and peered around him in perplexity.|$|R
60|$|I rowed a <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> hundred <b>feet</b> {{along the}} beach so as to recover my nerves, and then stepped ashore again.|$|R
60|$|After we had crawled in this disgusting {{fashion for}} a matter <b>of</b> a <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> hundred <b>feet</b> we were halted by our escort.|$|R
2500|$|Beinn Achaladair has {{a curved}} summit ridge almost two {{kilometres}} in length which runs north to south, {{the highest point}} stands at its northern end and overlooks Rannoch Moor, there are two cairns close together at the summit with the more northerly one being the highest point by a <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>feet.</b> Just over a kilometre south of the highest point stands the South Top, with a height of 1002 metres it listed as a “Top” in the Munro’s Tables. Beinn Achaladair has two corries on its slopes, {{to the east of}} the summit ridge is Coire nan Clach which contains eight very small lochans in its upper recesses. [...] This corrie drains down Gleann Cailliche (Glen of the Old Woman) into Loch Lyon, this now deserted glen was previously well populated before the Highland Clearances. The remains of the settlement of Tigh na Cailleach and the surrounding shielings can still be identified ...|$|E
2500|$|On lap 124, {{the race}} for the {{beneficiary}} resulted in the [...] "Big One". This began when Earnhardt, Jr. spun Brian Vickers into traffic {{toward the end of the}} backstretch, collecting race dominator Busch and his brother Kurt, Robby Gordon, Jamie McMurray, Carl Edwards, Denny Hamlin, Scott Speed, and Earnhardt, Jr.'s teammate Jimmie Johnson. R. Gordon's car slid in front of Earnhardt, Jr. within a <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>feet</b> of contact. Many of Earnhardt Jr.'s fans, the Daytona 500 participants, and the drivers believed that the contact was done intentionally; and many fans (including those of the #88 fans) and drivers (such as Vickers, Ku. and Ky. Busch, R. Gordon, Hamlin, and McMurray gave NASCAR requests and calls to black-flag Earnhardt, Jr. [...] Earnhardt was penalized on two counts by NASCAR; [...] first, he was sent to the tail end of the longest line for overasggressive driving, and the ensuing penalty meant he was not granted the beneficiary as a result. [...] (A driver cannot cause the caution in order to be granted the beneficiary.) [...] Brian Vickers was angry and said when interviewed [...] "To wreck somebody intentionally like that in front of the entire field is really kind of dangerous. That's my biggest problem with it. But, apparently, (Earnhardt, Jr.) wanted a caution pretty bad." [...] Both Vickers and Earnhardt, Jr. were a lap down before the wreck occurred, and Earnhardt, Jr. was unaware that he was battling Vickers for the position. [...] At this time, Kevin Harvick pushed Matt Kenseth into a battle for first between Kenseth and Sadler. On lap 138, Jeff Burton smacked the wall, collecting Paul Menard. Burton was then black-flagged for having a piece of sheetmetal hanging from his bumper.|$|E
60|$|They {{walked to}} {{the very edge of}} the palisading. It was {{scarcely}} more than a <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>feet</b> high. She pointed downwards.|$|E
50|$|Ymir {{had three}} direct offspring: {{a boy and}} girl who grew from beneath his arms and a six-headed son who sprang from the <b>coupling</b> <b>of</b> his <b>feet.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "We can't make it," [...] she whispered, {{looking back}} at the ice a <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> hundred <b>feet</b> away. [...] "Our only chance is to run before it and work in slowly." ...|$|R
6000|$|She avoided his question. [...] "We're too low here at Junction. Mother {{ought to}} go a <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> {{thousand}} <b>feet</b> higher. She needs rest and a change. I've sent her out to the ranch." ...|$|R
60|$|Harry led {{him forward}} where the boat's sheer was higher {{and he could}} stand a <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>feet</b> or so above the water.|$|E
60|$|But Larry was {{determined}} to test the ceiling, which was but a <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>feet</b> over their heads. So he had his companion hold him for that purpose.|$|E
60|$|While {{climbing}} a fence, I heard the low, eager whine of a dog, apparently from within a <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>feet</b> of me; but on looking about me I saw nothing.|$|E
60|$|Devine nodded, but {{the little}} smile {{was still in his}} eyes, and he pointed to the one where, by {{crawling}} down the gully a torrent had fretted out, an agile man might reach a jutting crag a <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> hundred <b>feet</b> below.|$|R
50|$|One {{may also}} access the farm in a <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> hours by <b>foot</b> {{traveling}} {{over the mountain}} from Ramstaddalen in Sykkylven Municipality.|$|R

60|$|After that Frank tried several shots, finally {{succeeding}} in hitting the tree a <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>feet</b> above the mark. Mr. Oliver, {{who had taken}} out his pipe in the meanwhile, nodded at him encouragingly.|$|E
60|$|Billy {{grinned and}} rolled {{over on his}} side, his head uphill and his feet toward the fire. A <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>feet</b> away Bridge paralleled him, and in five minutes both were {{breathing}} deeply in healthy slumber.|$|E
60|$|In a {{few seconds}} {{the bow of the}} canoe touched the land, so lightly as to be quite inaudible, and Harry, {{stepping}} gently over the side, drew it forward a <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>feet,</b> while his companions disembarked.|$|E
50|$|Barriers varying {{in length}} from a <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> hundred <b>feet</b> to three miles were {{constructed}} consuming 50% of Britain's production of scaffolding steel {{at an estimated}} cost of £6,600 per mile (equivalent to £ today). Despite this, many miles of Admiralty scaffolding were erected using more than 15,000 mi of scaffolding tube.|$|R
60|$|He pointed ahead, {{but there}} was no need to do this, for all saw, only a <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> hundred <b>feet</b> away, a veritable herd of {{walruses}} numbering at least a hundred if not twice that number. They had heard the death-cry of their mate, and were lumbering forward to see what was the matter.|$|R
60|$|Above him raced the long, light {{passenger}} fliers, plying, each in {{its proper}} plane, between the numerous landing-stages for internal passenger traffic. Landing-stages that tower {{high into the}} heavens are for the great international passenger liners. Freighters have other landing-stages at various lower levels, to within a <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> hundred <b>feet</b> <b>of</b> the ground; nor dare any flier rise or drop from one plane to another except in certain restricted districts where horizontal traffic is forbidden.|$|R
6000|$|... "Traveling for Sam Barringford will {{certainly}} be bad," [...] remarked Rodney, who was already at work, blowing up the fire for his mother. [...] "If this keeps on, {{it will be a}} <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>feet</b> deep by nightfall." ...|$|E
60|$|As I {{approached}} the slightly more slender extremity {{of the branch}} it bent beneath my weight until, as I balanced perilously upon its outer tip, it swayed gently on a level with the ledge {{at a distance of}} a <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>feet.</b>|$|E
60|$|He {{went under}} without splash and ripple, {{turned over and}} swam down. I {{followed}} his progress through the water-glass, which is merely an oblong box a <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>feet</b> long, open at the top, the bottom sealed water-tight with a sheet of ordinary glass.|$|E
6000|$|... "We've {{got only}} a <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> hundred <b>feet</b> to go," [...] was the reply. [...] "Come ahead. I'll help you pull that bobsled," [...] and now Uncle Barney took hold, {{and once again}} they started forward, this time {{skirting}} the lower extremity of Snowshoe Island. Here there were {{a great number of}} pines and hemlocks growing amid a perfect wilderness of rocks, now all thickly covered with snow.|$|R
50|$|Tara has {{the ability}} to {{increase}} her size to a <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> hundred <b>feet.</b> Originally she couldn't shrink past 8 feet but over time she has gotten past this disability. Tara's strength and stamina grow accordingly with her size even though she has exceptional agility. In Femforce #100 on a strange planet Tara's abilities were magnified to the point where she grow to several hundred with almost no effort. A side effect however was that she shrank down to a <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> inches later.|$|R
50|$|The ruins are {{difficult}} to access, as no roads lead down to the bay, and the ghuts leading down the mountain side are relatively steep. The bay is not accessible by sea due to the coral reefs lying close to the shore, and the strong north side swells. However, a road from the nearby housing development descends to within a <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> hundred <b>feet</b> <b>of</b> the bay, and a dirt track leads down to the beach, {{making it possible to}} see the ruins without cutting a path.|$|R
60|$|A {{few seconds}} later there was a flash, and a roar. All eyes were {{directed}} on the lugger, which the captain was watching through his glass. There was a shout from the men. The ball had passed through the great foresail, a <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>feet</b> from the mast.|$|E
6000|$|The {{lieutenant}} {{was about}} to give the order to turn when Harry said, suddenly, [...] "There is a current, sir. I have had my eye upon that root, and we have drifted backwards a <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>feet</b> since we lost way, so there must be a stretch of water above us." ...|$|E
60|$|Adair's third ball dropped {{just short}} of the spot. The batsman, hitting out, was a shade too soon. The ball hummed through the air a <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>feet</b> from the ground in the {{direction}} of mid-off, and Mike, diving to the right, got to it as he was falling, and chucked it up.|$|E
5000|$|At Surabaya, Captain Ford had {{to refuel}} with {{automobile}} grade gasoline. [...] "We {{took off from}} Surabaya on the 100 octane, climbed a <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> thousand <b>feet,</b> and pulled back the power to cool off the engines," [...] said Ford. [...] "Then we switched to the automobile gas and held our breaths. The engines almost jumped out of their mounts, but they ran. We figured it was either that or leave the airplane to the Japs." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{closed my}} {{readings}} with a fearful adventure which Mr. Whymper once {{had on the}} Matterhorn when he was prowling around alone, five thousand feet above the town of Breil. He was edging his way gingerly {{around the corner of}} a precipice where the upper edge of a sharp declivity of ice-glazed snow joined it. This declivity swept down a <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> hundred <b>feet,</b> into a gully which curved around and ended at a precipice eight hundred feet high, overlooking a glacier. His foot slipped, and he fell.|$|R
60|$|For a <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> hundred <b>feet</b> I fell in {{horizontal}} position. The momentum I gained was terrific. I {{could feel}} the air almost as a solid body, so swiftly I hurtled through it. Then my position gradually changed to the vertical, and with hands outstretched I slipped through the air, cleaving it like a flying arrow. Just before I struck the water a perfect shower of javelins fell all about. My enemies bad rushed to the brink and hurled their weapons after me. By a miracle I was untouched.|$|R
