We investigate properties of a mean-field solar dynamo with such double-cell meridional circulation.

Obviously, there is another invisible financing channel {{that can only be}} found in enterprises’ own capital supply chain, 2 which implies that entrepreneurs realize financing through controlling the capital circulation period in industrial chains as well as the scale of cash flow, making use of minimum expenses to stimulate the operation of the whole production chain. 3 In brief, it can be concluded that the scale of cash flow must be minimized and capital <b>circulation</b> <b>speed</b> be improved as much as possible. However, improving capital <b>circulation</b> <b>speed</b> is subject to fixed conditions such as labor intensity, technology, and logistics speed.

In other words, it is cost allocation based on massive graduated debt that definitely motivates the lasting development of SMEs. Nevertheless, economics has not paid sufficient attention to this phenomenon and generally regards it simply as existing debt or deferred repayment.|$|E

The research was carried out on 57 fattening pigs of both sex, divided into two groups by their housing. Each group consisted of pigs of two genotypes, i. e. three-way crossbreeds of Large White and German Landrace (LW x GL) in the dam line, and of German Landrace and 8 Pietrain (P) in the sire line. Pigs were fed ad libitum with isocaloric and isoprotein diets. During the whole experiment, temperature, air moisture, air <b>circulation</b> <b>speed</b> and the content of NH 3 and CO 2 were measured in pens. No statistically significant differences were recorded with respect to temperature, air moisture, air <b>circulation</b> <b>speed</b> and content of carbon dioxide (CO 2) and ammonia (NH 3) in the air in pens with deep litter and without it (P> 0. 05). Pigs housed without deep litter had statistically highly significant (P< 0. 01) higher final weights than pigs kept on deep litter. Pigs crossed with Pietrain as a terminal breed, kept in pens without deep litter, had statistically significantly higher (P< 0. 05) average daily gains than pigs of the same genotype kept on deep litter. In the finishing phase of fattening, group of pigs being kept in pens without deep litter had statistically higher average daily gains than pigs kept on deep litter (P< 0. 05).

40|$|Hot air and {{hot water}} heating {{methods have been}} {{extensively}} studied as thermal treatments to control insect pests in fruits to replace chemical fumigation. An inherent difficulty in using these methods is that slow heating rates may result in long treatment times and possible damage to fruit quality. Many factors influence heating time. A systematic analysis of those influences is desirable to help in designing effective treatment protocols. A simulation model based on heat transfer theory was developed to study the effect of fruit thermal property, fruit size, heating medium and heating medium speed on heat transfer rates within spherical fruits. The simulation demonstrated that the small variation in thermal diffusivity among fruits {{had little effect on}} heating time. Fruit internal heat transfer rate was significantly influenced by fruit size and by heating medium. Water was a more efficient medium than air and increasing air speed increased heating rates. Water <b>circulation</b> <b>speeds</b> had little influence on heat transfer rate. The Biot number showed that internal energy transfer by conduction was a heating rate limiting factor. Combining low frequency electromagnetic energy with hot air or hot water eliminated conduction as a major rate-limiting factor because the energy was directly delivered to the fruit interior. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.

With this procedure we {{are capable of}} measuring flows with a horizontal spatial resolution of 2 ◦ in heliographic angle (or roughly 20 Mm). From the resulting flow fields we deduce mean inflow rates into active regions, mean <b>circulation</b> <b>speeds</b> around active regions, and probability density functions (PDFs) of properties of the flow field. These analyses indicate that active regions have a zonal velocity that exceeds that of quiet sun at the same latitude by 20 m s − 1, yet active regions advect poleward {{at the same rate}} as quiet sun. We also find that almost all active regions possess a mean inflow (20 – 30 m s − 1) and a cyclonic circulation (≈ 5 m s − 1) at their peripheries, whereas their cores, where the sunspots are located, are zones of strong anticyclonic outflow (≈ 50 m s − 1). From the PDFs, we find that active regions modify the structure of convection with a scale greater than that of supergranulation.

The latter is marginally better than subsidization but has a negative impact in consumer surplus.

40|$|International audienceTAMI Industries has {{developed}} and commercialized since 1996 a new range of original ceramic membranes with a plane geometry. This type of membrane associates {{the interest of}} the weak hydraulic diameters to important values of thermal, mechanical and chemical resistance of ceramics. Shaped in a cassette form with open channels, these new membranes showed their efficiency in the environmental market. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to describe the standardization of milk proteins and the whey concentration studied to test these new products in the dairy industry. The result is expressed under the form of classic curves of the permeate flux in function of the VCF. These curves were established for velocities of 0. 5 m. s$^{- 1 }$, 1 m. s$^{- 1 }$ and 2. 5 m. s$^{- 1 }$ and showed performances in the order magnitude of other types of membranes. By comparing with tubular products of TAMI industries, and on the basis of an industrial example (10 m$^ 3 $. h$^{- 1 }$ of milk to process), two differences appeared: - on one hand, energy consumption by m$^ 3 $ of permeate product were respectively for the plane geometry and the tubular geometry of 6 kW. m$^{- 3 }$ and 9. 4 kW. m$^{- 3 }$; - on the other hand the cost of the system was 12 to 14 kF. m$^{- 2 }$ for the tubular geometry and 8 to 10 kF. m$^{- 2 }$ for the plane geometry. These differences were the consequence of the reduction of the hydraulic diameter. If one takes into account the shear constraint on the wall and the <b>circulation</b> <b>speed</b> as important parameters for the crossflow filtration, one observes that the diminution of the hydraulic diameter allows: - at constant velocity, to increase the shear constraint and to reduce energy. - at constant shear constraint, to reduce both the <b>circulation</b> <b>speed</b> and energy. In this case, membrane performances were identical and the equipment pricing became cheaper by reduction of the engineering costs. These comparisons were established between tubes and cassettes with opened channels and showed the interest to reduce the hydraulic membrane diameter what can simply be done by using the plane geometry. The particular case of a spacer, as a mean to reduce the hydraulic diameter, was not considered because of the complexity of the flow. Choosing open channels ceramic membrane plates allowed a global reduction of investment and functioning costs while keeping the interest of ceramics...|$|E
40|$|International audienceWe have {{diagnosed}} the lifetimes of long-lived source gases emitted at {{the surface}} and removed in the stratosphere using six three-dimensional chemistry-climate models (CCMs) and a two-dimensional model. The models all used the same standard photochemical data. We investigate the effect of different definitions of lifetimes, including running the models with both mixing ratio (MBC) and flux (FBC) boundary conditions. Within the same model, the lifetimes diagnosed by different methods agree very well. Using FBCs versus MBCs leads to a different tracer burden as the implied lifetime contained in the MBC value does not necessarily match a model's own calculated lifetime. In general, there are much larger differences in the lifetimes calculated by different models, the main causes of which are variations in the modelled rates of ascent and horizontal mixing in the tropical mid-lower stratosphere. The model runs {{have been used to}} compute instantaneous and steady-state lifetimes. For chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) their atmospheric distribution was far from steady state in their growth phase through to the 1980 s and the diagnosed instantaneous lifetime is accordingly much longer. Following the cessation of emissions, the resulting decay of CFCs is much closer to steady-state. For 2100 conditions the model <b>circulation</b> <b>speeds</b> generally increase, but a thicker ozone layer due to recovery and climate change reduces photolysis rates.

40|$|Meridional {{circulation}} is {{an important}} ingredient in flux transport dynamo models. We have studied its importance on the period, the amplitude of the solar cycle, and also in producing Maunder-like grand minima in these models. First, we model the periods of the last 23 sunspot cycles by varying the meridional <b>circulation</b> <b>speed.</b> If the dynamo is in a diffusion-dominated regime, then we find {{that most of the}} cycle amplitudes also get modeled up to some extent when we model the periods. Next, we propose that {{at the beginning of the}} Maunder minimum the amplitude of meridional circulation dropped to a low value and then after a few years it increased again. Several independent studies also favor this assumption. With this assumption, a diffusion-dominated dynamo is able to reproduce many important features of the Maunder minimum remarkably well. If the dynamo is in a diffusion-dominated regime, then a slower meridional circulation means that the poloidal field gets more time to diffuse during its transport through the convection zone, making the dynamo weaker. This consequence helps to model both the cycle amplitudes and the Maunder-like minima. We, however, fail to reproduce these results if the dynamo is in an advection-dominated regime.

The differential rotation and meridional circulation are generated from the effect of turbulent Reynolds stress and are subjected to back-reaction from the magnetic field. To generate grand minimum and maximum-like periods in our simulations, we used random fluctuations in the angular momentum transport process, namely the Lambda-mechanism, and in the Babcock-Leighton mechanism. To characterise the nature and occurrences of the identified grand minima and maxima in our simulations, we used the waiting time distribution analyses, which reflects whether the underlying distribution arises from a random or a memory-bearing process. The results show that, in majority of the cases, the distributions of grand minima and maxima reveal {{that the nature of}} these events originates from memoryless processes.

30|$|In {{the period}} of {{subcontracting}} {{there are two different}} kinds of capital circulation periods in the production capital chain (Fig.  3 presents more details). The first capital circulation period is between the material suppliers, the subcontractors, and the clients. The second is the circulation period between the subcontractors and the households. The latter adjusts itself according to the period from production to sale, which means adjusting according to {{the period of}} orders. Generally speaking, in Pu Town, the period from the material purchase to the production of white fabric and delivery to the clients lasts from 2 to 3  months. In the case of foreign transactions, the time for dyeing and finishing as well as export transportation must be added into the whole period, which amounts to about 45  days. Thus, for subcontractors working on foreign transactions, the capital circulation period of a batch of goods is roughly 4  months, while domestic transactions are about 2 to 3  months. The social time for the second capital circulation period in settling puts off the payment time as much as possible in regard to the speed of capital circulation, which makes the speed of the first capital circulation period go far beyond its <b>circulation</b> <b>speed.</b> It is basically suggested that the first capital circulation period does not need to pay the processing fee in full for the households timely after getting profits in trading.

Local helioseismology reconstructs subsurface structures and flows by extracting coherent signals of acoustic waves traveling through the interior and carrying information about subsurface perturbations and flows, from stochastic oscillations observed on the surface. The initial analysis of the subsurface flow maps reconstructed from the 5 years of SDO/HMI data by time-distance helioseismology reveals the great potential for studying {{and understanding of the}} dynamics of the quiet Sun and active regions, and the evolution with the solar cycle. In particular, our results show that the emergence and evolution of active regions are accompanied by multi-scale flow patterns, and that the meridional flows display the North-South asymmetry closely correlating with the magnetic activity. The latitudinal variations of the meridional <b>circulation</b> <b>speed,</b> which are probably related to the large-scale converging flows, are mostly confined in shallow subsurface layers. Therefore, these variations do not necessarily affect the magnetic flux transport. The North-South asymmetry is also pronounced in the variations of the differential rotation ("torsional oscillations").

Members of the internet sites write their views by using a user's name, i. e. a nickname, so nobody has to explain anything to anyone and nobody is responsible for what s/he writes on. This also helps gossip to spread rapidly amongst people on cyber media. Throughout this study, the role of the forums of various internet sites, basically estabhshed as "the platforms of information sharing", in the transmission of the gossip as verbal culture and reproduction and the <b>circulation</b> <b>speed</b> of it will be analyzed...|$|E
40|$|The Little Red Spot (LRS) in Jupiter’s {{atmosphere}} {{was investigated in}} unprecedented detail by the New Horizons spacecraft together with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and the Very Large Telescope (VLT). The LRS and the larger Great Red Spot (GRS) of Jupiter are the largest known atmospheric storms in the solar system. Originally a white oval, the LRS formed from the mergers of three smaller storms in 1998 and 2000, and became as red as the GRS between 2005 and 2006. Here we show that <b>circulation</b> and wind <b>speeds</b> in the LRS have increased substantially since the Voyager and Galileo eras when the oval was white. The maximum tangential velocity of the LRS is no...|$|R
40|$|Advanced ceramic {{balls are}} used {{extensively}} in hybrid precision ball bearings and show advantages in high speed, high temperature, high load and hostile environment. Finishing these balls with high quality, good efficiency and low cost {{is critical to}} their widespread application. A brief review of the methods for finishing ceramic balls is presented. The design of a novel eccentric lapping machine for finishing advanced ceramic balls is described. The kinematics of eccentric lapping is analysed and discussed, the symbolic expressions for the ball spin angular speed, omega (b), ball spin angle, beta, and ball <b>circulation</b> angular <b>speed,</b> omega (c), are derived and numerical solutions are plotted. Two kinds of hot isostatically pressed (HIPed) silicon nitride ball blanks (13. 25 - 13. 50 mm in diameter) were lapped and polished to 12. 700 mm using this machine. A maximum material removal rate of 68 mum/h was achieved at the lapping step, which {{is much higher than}} by the traditional concentric lapping method. The polished ball surface roughness, R-a, value is 0. 003 mum, and the ball roundness is 0. 08 - 0. 09 mum, which is above grade 5 and close to grade 3 of the precision bearing ball specification. This machine {{can be used as a}} prototype to develop a larger-scale machine for production...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: In this study, {{detailed}} {{air flow}} characteristics in an urban areas were analyzed using GIS data and a Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) model. For this, a building construction algorithm optimized for Geographic Information System (GIS) data with a vector format (Los Angeles region imagery acquisition consortium 2 geographic information system, LARIAC 2 GIS) was used. In the LARIAC 2 GIS data, building vertices were expressed as latitude and longitude. Using the model buildings constructed by the algorithm as the surface boundary data in the CFD model, we performed numerical simulations for two building-congested areas in Los Angeles using inflow information provided by California Air Resources Board. Comparing with the inflow, there was a marked difference in wind speed and direction within the target areas, which was mainly caused by the secondarily induced local circulations such as street-canyon vortices, horse-shoe vortices, and recirculation zones. In street canyons parallel to the inflow direction, wind speed increased due to a channeling effect and, in street canyons perpendicular to the inflow direction, vertically well developed vortices were induced. In front of a building, a horse-shoe vortex was developed near the surface and, behind a building, a recirculation zone was developed. Near the surface in the areas where the secondarily induced local <b>circulations,</b> wind <b>speed</b> remarkably increased. Overall, wind direction little (largely) changed at the areas where wind speed largely increased (decreased) ...|$|R
