40|$|Background A {{voluntary}} surveillance {{scheme of}} occupational skin diseases (OSDs) in The Netherlands starting in 2001 aimed to improve insight {{in the incidence}} of OSD especially occupational contact dermatitis (OCD), risk professions and <b>causal</b> <b>agents.</b> This paper presents the results of this scheme during 2001 - 05. Methods Reports of new cases of OSD received from the participating dermatologists on a monthly basis were analysed. Data evaluated included information on diagnosis, sex, age, sickness, absenteeism, profession and <b>causal</b> <b>agents.</b> Relative differences in incidence rates between industries or branches were estimated by calculating incidence rate ratios. Results About 80 % of the notifications concerned OCD. The highest number of notifications was recorded {{in the first year of}} the scheme. This was probably due to reporting of a mixture of incident and prevalent cases. During the following 5 years, the number of yearly notifications of OSD declined. Hairdressers, nurses, metalworkers, mechanics and cleaners were the most commonly affected professions. Wet work and irritating substances were the most frequently reported <b>causal</b> <b>agents.</b> Most patients with OCD were not absent from work. Conclusions A voluntary surveillance scheme with dermatologists provides valuable data about the distribution of OCD in risk professions and the <b>causal</b> <b>agents.</b> However, it has certain limitations in assessing trends in incidence. Active medical surveillance in populations at risk should be encouraged not only to improve secondary prevention but also to obtain more reliable information about the incidence of OC...|$|R

40|$|We {{introduce}} <b>Causal</b> <b>Agents,</b> {{a methodology}} and agent architecture for modeling intelligent agents based on Causality Theory. We draw upon concepts from classical philosophy about metaphysical causes of existing entities for defining agents {{in terms of}} their formal, material, efficient and final causes and use computational mechanisms from Bayesian causal models for designing <b>causal</b> <b>agents.</b> Agent’s intentions, interactions and performance are governed by their final causes. A Semantic Bayesian Causal Model, which integrates a probabilistic causal model with a semantic layer, is used by agents for knowledge representation and inference. Agents are able to use semantic information from external stimuli (utterances, for example) which are mapped into the <b>agent’s</b> <b>causal</b> model for reasoning about causal relationships with probabilistic methods. Our theory is being tested by an operational multiagents system implementation for managing research products. ...|$|R
25|$|Agrobacterium tumefaciens (updated {{scientific}} name Rhizobium radiobacter, synonym Agrobacterium radiobacter) is the <b>causal</b> <b>agent</b> of {{crown gall disease}} (the formation of tumours) in over 140 species of eudicots. It is a rod-shaped, Gram-negative soil bacterium. Symptoms are caused by the insertion of a small segment of DNA (known as the T-DNA, for 'transfer DNA', {{not to be confused}} with tRNA that transfers amino acids during protein synthesis, confusingly also called transfer RNA), from a plasmid, into the plant cell, which is incorporated at a semi-random location into the plant genome.|$|E
25|$|In 1875, Smith {{published}} a paper describing and illustrating the overwintering spores of Phytophthora infestans, the <b>causal</b> <b>agent</b> of late blight of potatoes, the disease {{responsible for the}} great Irish potato famine.

The German mycologist Anton de Bary pointed out that Smith had actually described some contaminating spores, but national pride upheld Smith's reputation as a plant pathologist and he was appointed to several governmental commissions on plant diseases, as well as publishing a book on the subject in 1884.|$|E
25|$|The <b>causal</b> <b>agent</b> of Ring Rot of Potato {{does not}} overwinter in the soil. The {{bacteria}} survives inside infected tubers or as dried slime on machinery or containers. For instance, if a knife cuts into an infected tuber, the next 20 tubers that the knife cuts {{have a high}} risk of becoming infected. The bacteria enters the host through wounds and invades the xylem where it multiplies via binary fission. If colonization is successful, the bacteria may plug the xylem vessels. In advanced stages of infection, the bacteria will move out of the vessels and break down the surrounding parenchyma tissue before moving into new vessels. The bacteria may also invade the roots and cause them to deteriorate.|$|E

40|$|Anthracnose {{disease is}} one of the major {{economic}} constraints to chilli production worldwide, especially in tropical and subtropical regions. Accurate taxonomic information is necessary for effective disease control management. In the Colletotrichum patho-system, different Colletotrichum species can be associated with anthracnose of the same host. Little information is known concerning the interactions of the species associated with the chilli anthracnose although several Colletotrichum species have been reported as <b>causal</b> <b>agents</b> of chilli anthracnose disease worldwide. The ambiguous taxonomic status of Colletotrichum species has resulted in inaccurate identification which may cause practical problems in plant breeding and disease management. Although the management and control of anthracnose disease are still being extensively researched, commercial cultivars of Capsicum annuum that are resistant to the pathogens that cause chilli anthracnose have not yet been developed. This paper reviews the <b>causal</b> <b>agents</b> of chilli anthracnose, the disease cycle, conventional methods in identification of the pathogen and molecular approaches that have been used for the identification of Colletotrichum species. Pathogenetic variation and population structure of the <b>causal</b> <b>agents</b> of chilli anthracnose along with the current taxonomic status of Colletotrichum species are discussed. Future developments leading to the disease management strategies are suggested...|$|R
25|$|The {{earliest}} recorded {{observation of}} possible links between maternal alcohol use and fetal damage {{was made in}} 1899 by Dr. William Sullivan, a Liverpool prison physician who noted higher rates of stillbirth for 120 alcoholic female prisoners than their sober female relatives; he suggested the <b>causal</b> <b>agent</b> to be alcohol use. This contradicted the predominating belief {{at the time that}} heredity caused intellectual disability, poverty, and criminal behavior, which contemporary studies on the subjects usually concluded. A case study by Henry H. Goddard of the Kallikak family—popular in the early 1900s—represents this earlier perspective, though later researchers have suggested that the Kallikaks almost certainly had FAS. General studies and discussions on alcoholism throughout the mid-1900s were typically based on a heredity argument.|$|E
25|$|The <b>causal</b> <b>agent</b> of {{bacterial}} wilt and canker of tomato survives in or on seeds {{for up to}} 8 months but occasionally also in plant refuse in the soil. The pathogen can be spread long distances because of its association with seeds. The risk of spreading the bacteria to healthy tomato plants is greatest during transplanting, tying, and suckering or any time when the host may be wounded. Once the bacteria enters the plant through a wound, it will move and multiply primarily in the xylem vessels. Once established, the bacteria may move into the phloem, pith, and cortex. Infection can result in either systemic or superficial disease. Systemic infections appear in 3–6 weeks {{and the risk of}} secondary infection goes up with water-splashing. The common occurrence of latent infections – presence of the pathogen within the host yet the host shows no symptoms – makes this pathogen especially dangerous.|$|E

Historic ADS products provide general locational data on recent insect-induced forest type specific disturbances that may help in determining candidate <b>causal</b> <b>agents</b> for MODIS-based disturbance maps, especially when combined with other historic geospatial disturbance data (e. g., wildfire burn scars and drought maps). Historic ADS disturbance detection polygons can show severe and extensive regional forest disturbances, though they also can show polygons with sparsely scattered or infrequent disturbances. Examples will be discussed that use various historic disturbance data to help determine potential causes of MODIS-detected regional forest disturbance anomalies...|$|R
