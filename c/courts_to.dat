5000|$|Generally, the Erie {{doctrine}} {{requires the}} Federal <b>court</b> <b>to</b> predict how {{the courts of}} a given state would rule and decide a given issue. Many states, however, allow certified questions to be addressed from the Federal <b>court</b> <b>to</b> the appellate <b>court</b> or state supreme court of that state, allowing the state <b>court</b> <b>to</b> decide those questions of law.|$|R
5|$|Since {{this case}} {{challenged}} {{the authority of}} the federal <b>courts</b> <b>to</b> try Indian-on-Indian crime, this case was heard as an interlocutory appeal, meaning that the Supreme Court would have to decide the constitutionality of the claimed jurisdiction before Kagama could be tried for the killing of Iyouse in federal court.|$|E
5|$|Some {{complaints}} {{were raised by}} others during {{the construction of the}} freeway south of SR 94.

5|$|The Australian Open court surface changed once, from grass <b>courts</b> <b>to</b> hardcourts in 1988. Mats Wilander was {{the only}} tennis player to win the event on grass and on Rebound Ace surfaces, which he won twice on grass and once on the Rebound Ace.

5|$|The {{result was}} the Supreme Court of Judicature Act 1873, which unified the Common Pleas, Exchequer, King's Bench and Court of Chancery into one body, the High Court of Justice, with the {{divisions}} between the <b>courts</b> <b>to</b> remain. Thus, while the reform epitomised by the Bill of Middlesex aided the King's Bench in the short term, it eventually led to its dissolution.|$|E
5|$|Although {{sections}} 8 and 10 of the ISA concern {{matters of}} national security, the Court held that this concern {{does not preclude}} the objective review of executive discretion. Following the case of Council of Civil Service Unions v. Minister for the Civil Service (1983), the Court of Appeal decided that {{it is up to}} the <b>courts</b> <b>to</b> determine whether a decision is in fact based on grounds of national security. Similarly, it should also be within the court's purview to determine whether the matters relied upon in exercising powers under the ISA fall within the scope of purposes specified by sections8 and 10.|$|E

5|$|As a {{condition}} of being allowed to disinter the skeleton, the archaeologists agreed that, if Richard were found, his remains would be reburied in Leicester Cathedral. A controversy arose as to whether an alternative reburial site, York Minster or Westminster Abbey, would be more suitable. A legal challenge confirmed there were no public law grounds for the <b>courts</b> <b>to</b> be involved in that decision. Reinterment took place in Leicester on 26 March 2015, during a televised memorial service held {{in the presence of}} the Archbishop of Canterbury and senior members of other Christian denominations.|$|E
5|$|Bach {{composed}} the cantata at a decisive {{turning point in}} his career. Moving from posts {{in the service of}} churches and <b>courts</b> <b>to</b> the town of Leipzig on the first Sunday after Trinity, 30 May 1723, he began the project of composing a new cantata for every occasion of the liturgical year. He began his first annual cycle of cantatas ambitiously with , in an unusual layout of 14 movements in two symmetrical parts, to be performed before and after the sermon. , performed a week later, has the same structure.|$|E
5|$|Despite the Supreme Court's {{desire to}} resolve {{conflicts}} between circuit courts, legal scholars disagree about whether circuit splits are detrimental or beneficial. Some argue that circuit splits are harmful because they create confusion and encourage forum shopping, while other {{scholars argue that}} variation among circuits allows local <b>courts</b> <b>to</b> experiment with new laws that reflect the values of local residents. Scholars have also observed that regional variations in {{different areas of the}} United States have provided certain circuits with a particular specialization or expertise in some subjects of the law.|$|E

5|$|Despite the {{rejection}} of Taylor's constitutional position, the Court did create the framework for a balancing test for lower <b>courts</b> <b>to</b> use in handling future discovery preclusion questions. A trial court must balance the defendant's interest in a robust defense with the (i) state's interest in 'efficient' justice, (ii) state's interest in excluding evidence lacking integrity, (iii) state's interest in a strong judicial authority with followed rules, and (iv) the prosecution interest in avoiding prejudice due to a defendant's discovery violation.|$|E
5|$|Finally, Universal's conduct {{amounted}} to {{an abuse of}} judicial process, {{and in that sense}} caused a longer harm to the public as a whole. Depending on the commercial results, Universal alternatively argued to the courts, first, that King Kong {{was a part of the}} public domain, and then second, that King Kong was not part of the public domain, and that Universal possessed exclusive trademark rights in it. Universal's assertions in court were based not on any good faith belief in their truth, but on the mistaken belief that it could use the <b>courts</b> <b>to</b> turn a profit.|$|E
5|$|Foreign states {{generally}} enjoy {{immunity from}} lawsuits in the United States under the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act (FSIA). The FSIA is the exclusive basis for U.S. <b>courts</b> <b>to</b> exercise jurisdiction over a foreign government. Prior to {{enactment of the}} FSIA in 1976, the executive branch was responsible for determining the immunity of foreign states on a case-by-case basis. By enacting the FSIA, Congress codified the guidelines for the immunity of foreign states and transferred responsibility for determining a foreign state's immunity from the executive branch to the judiciary.|$|E

5|$|Gandhi {{expanded}} his nonviolent non-co-operation platform {{to include the}} swadeshi policy—the boycott of foreign-made goods, especially British goods. Linked to this was his advocacy that khadi (homespun cloth) be worn by all Indians instead of British-made textiles. Gandhi exhorted Indian men and women, rich or poor, to spend time each day spinning khadi {{in support of the}} independence movement. In addition to boycotting British products, Gandhi urged the people to boycott British institutions and law <b>courts,</b> <b>to</b> resign from government employment, and to forsake British titles and honours. Gandhi thus began his journey aimed at crippling the British India government economically, politically and administratively.|$|E
5|$|Glasser {{wished the}} benefit of the {{undivided}} assistance of counsel of his own choice. We think that such a desire on the part of an accused should be respected. Irrespective of any conflict of interest, the additional burden of representing another party may conceivably impair counsel's effectiveness. To determine the precise degree of prejudice sustained by Glasser {{as a result of the}} court's appointment of Stewart as counsel for Kretske is at once difficult and unnecessary. The right to have the assistance of counsel is too fundamental and absolute to allow <b>courts</b> <b>to</b> indulge in nice calculations as to the amount of prejudice arising from its denial.|$|E
5|$|His {{success in}} Gruban v Booth allowed Hastings to switch his {{practice}} {{from the county}} <b>courts</b> <b>to</b> the High Court, and {{at the beginning of}} Hilary term 1919 he applied to become a King's Counsel (KC). Becoming a KC was a risk; he would go from competing with other junior barristers to coming up against the finest minds in the profession. Despite this he decided to take the risk, and he was accepted later that year.|$|E
