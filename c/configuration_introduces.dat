40|$|This letter {{investigates the}} effect of shear on Rayleigh-Taylor {{instability}} (RTI). Even simple uniform shear strongly influences the instability; longer waves are completely stabilized when density stratification is large (higher Atwood numbers).

When the unstable density interface is embedded in a shear layer, shear is again found to stabilize the RTI. However, this <b>configuration</b> <b>introduces</b> additional unstable shear instability modes in the lower wavenumber regime. A new type of shear instability, whose growth rate increases with Atwood number, plays a dominant role, while Kelvin-Helmholtz instability (KHI), which was previously understood to be the only possible shear instability in this context, has little significance.

As a consequence of this study, we explore the loop mapping problem in such systems with the aim of optimizing the shared use of the the LLC by all parallel threads. We propose a three-phase loop mapping strategy that deals with workload imbalances, minimizes cache sharing interferences, and maximizes intra-core and inter-core data reuse in the cache hierarchy.

40|$|We {{demonstrate}} experimentally that gain flattening of single-pump fiber Raman amplifiers {{is possible}} {{by use of}} non-linear broadening of the pump spectrum. In our experiments, pump broadening of a continuous-wave Raman fiber laser tuned at 1455 nm is achieved by propagation in a non-zero dispersion-shifted fiber with small anomalous dispersion at the pump wavelength. The broadened pump spectrum can reach a full width at half maximum {{of as much as}} 28 nm. Our results demonstrate that an acceptable flatness of the Raman gain spectrum can be obtained in the 1560 - 1640 nm region while avoiding pump-to pump non-linear interactions. On the dark side, our measurements show that this <b>configuration</b> <b>introduces</b> more noise than the conventional, non-broadened pump configuration since a non-negligible fraction of the broadened pump power falls within the band of amplification. However, we believe that further work and optimization should demonstrate that gain-flattened fiber Raman amplifiers using a single pump can be achieved over the C (1525 - 1565 nm) and L (1565 - 1625 nm) bands. © 2004 Elsevier B.

40|$|International audienceWe {{consider}} the long-term {{evolution of a}} random nonlinear wave that propagates in a multimode optical waveguide. The optical wave exhibits a thermalization process characterized by an irreversible evolution toward an equilibrium state. The tails of the equilibrium distribution satisfy the property of energy equipartition among the modes of the waveguide. As a consequence of this thermalization, the optical field undergoes a process of classical wave condensation, which {{is characterized by a}} macroscopic occupation of the fundamental mode of the waveguide. Considering the nonlinear Schrödinger equation with a confining potential, we formulate a wave turbulence description of the random wave into the basis of the eigenmodes of the waveguide. The condensate amplitude is calculated analytically {{as a function of the}} wave energy, and it is found in quantitative agreement with the numerical simulations.

40|$|The {{implementation}} of {{maximum power point}} tracking (MPPT) schemes by the ripple correlation control (RCC) algorithm is presented in this paper. A reference is made to single-phase single-stage multilevel photovoltaic (PV) generation systems, when the inverter input variables (PV voltage and PV current) have multiple low-frequency (ripple) harmonics. The harmonic analysis is carried out with reference to a multilevel configuration consisting of an H-bridge inverter and level doubling network (LDN) cell, leading to the multilevel inverter having double the output voltage levels as compared to the basic H-bridge inverter topology (i. e., five levels vs. three levels). The LDN cell is basically a half-bridge fed by a floating capacitor, with self-balancing voltage capability. The multilevel <b>configuration</b> <b>introduces</b> additional PV voltage and current low-frequency harmonics, perturbing the basic {{implementation of}} the RCC scheme (based on the second harmonic component), leading to malfunctioning. The proposed RCC algorithm employs the PV current and voltage harmonics at a specific frequency for the estimation of the voltage derivative of power dP/dV (or dI/dV), driving the PV operating point toward the maximum power point (MPP) in a faster and more precise manner. The steady-state and transient performances of the proposed RCC-MPPT schemes have been preliminarily tested and compared using MATLAB/Simulink. Results have been verified by experimental tests considering the whole multilevel PV generation system, including real PV modules, multilevel insulated-gate bipolar transistor (IGBT) inverters, and utility grids...|$|E
40|$|Users {{routinely}} access {{cloud services}} through third-party apps on smartphones by giving apps login credentials (i. e., a username and password). Unfortunately, users have no assurance that their apps will properly handle this sensitive information. In this paper, {{we describe the}} design and implementation of ScreenPass, which significantly improves the security of passwords on touchscreen devices. ScreenPass secures passwords by ensuring that they are entered securely, and uses taint-tracking to monitor where apps send password data. The primary technical challenge addressed by Screen-Pass is guaranteeing that trusted code is always aware of when a user is entering a password. ScreenPass provides this guarantee through two techniques. First, ScreenPass includes a trusted software keyboard that encourages users to specify their passwords’ domains as they are entered (i. e., to tag their passwords). Second, ScreenPass performs optical character recognition (OCR) on a device’s screenbuffer to ensure that passwords are entered only through the trusted software keyboard. We have evaluated Screen-Pass through experiments with a prototype implementation, two insitu user studies, and a small app study. Our prototype detected {{a wide range of}} dynamic and static keyboard-spoofing attacks and generated zero false positives.

40|$|The sun {{delivers}} {{an amount}} of energy equivalent to ninety billion hydrogen bombs detonating each second. Despite {{the fact that only}} one billionth of that energy falls onto the surface of the Earth, one day of sunlight would be sufficient to power the whole human race energy needs for over half a century. Solar electricity represents an environmentally-benign source of power. However, such technology is still more than twice as expensive as natural gas-fired generators. III-V semiconductor nanopillars are defined as vertically aligned arrays of nanostructures that hold the promise to aggressively diminish the cost of the active photovoltaic cell by exploiting a fraction of material utilized in conventional planar schemes. In this dissertation, we assess the viability of two classes of high-performance nanopillar-based solar cells. We begin with the incorporation of dedicated conjugated polymers to achieve a hybrid organic/inorganic heterojunction. Such <b>configuration</b> <b>introduces</b> a high optical absorption arising from the polymeric layer in conjunction with an efficient carrier transport resulting from the semiconductor nanopillar array. We extend the controllability of the heterojunction properties by replacing traditional spin-casting methods with an electrodeposition technique where the polymer is formed and doped in-situ directly onto the nanopillar facets. The rational tuning of the electrical conductivity and energy level of the polymer translates into an enhanced photocurrent and open-circuit voltage, achieving 4. 11 % solar power conversion efficiency. We then turn our attention to all-semiconductor radial p-n homojunctions embedded in the nanopillars. The first architecture focuses on ex-situ ammonium-sulfide passivation and correlates the optoelectronic properties of the solar cell once two different types of transparent conducting oxides are adopted. The barrier formed at the contact/semiconductor interface greatly depends on the Hall polarity of the transparent electrode. The second design delves into an in-situ InGaP passivation shell to alleviate the deleterious recombination effects caused by surface states. The efficiency improvement is over six-fold, up to 6. 63 %, compared to unpassivated devices. Lastly, a p-i-n radial junction nanopillar solar cell highlights external quantum efficiencies in great agreement with numerical simulations. In such framework, the dome morphology of the top transparent contact is found to concentrate and intensify the optical field within the nanopillar active volume, resulting into resonance peaks in the quantum yield measurements, at 7. 43 % efficiency. These findings confirm the potential of 3 D nanopillar solar cells as a cost-effective platform with respect to canonical thin-film photovoltaics...|$|E
40|$|With {{significant}} and substantial progress being accomplished toward readying the Space Launch System (SLS) rocket {{for its first}} test flight, work is already also underway on preparations for the second flight using an upgraded version of the vehicle and beyond. Designed to support human missions into deep space, Space Launch System (SLS), {{is the most powerful}} human-rated launch vehicle the United States has ever undertaken, and together with the Orion spacecraft will support human exploration missions into the proving ground of cislunar space and ultimately to Mars. For its first flight, SLS will deliver a near-term heavy-lift capability for the nation with its 70 -metric-ton Block 1 configuration. Each element of the vehicle now has flight hardware in production in support of the initial flight of the SLS, which will propel Orion around the moon and back. For its second flight, SLS will be upgraded to the more-capable Block 1 B configuration. While the Block 1 configuration is capable of delivering more than 70 metric tons to low Earth orbit, the Block 1 B vehicle will increase that capability to 105 metric tons. For that flight, the new <b>configuration</b> <b>introduces</b> two major new elements to the vehicle an Exploration Upper Stage (EUS) that will be used for both ascent and in-space propulsion, and a Universal Stage Adapter (USA) that serves as a payload bay for the rocket, allowing the launch of large exploration systems along with the Orion spacecraft. Already, flight hardware is being prepared for the Block 1 B vehicle. Beyond the second flight, additional upgrades will be made to the vehicle. The Block 1 B vehicle will also be able to launch 8. 4 -meter-diameter payload fairings, larger than any previously flown, and the Spacecraft Payload Integration and Evolution (SPIE) Element will oversee development and production of those fairings. Ultimately, SLS will be evolved to a Block 2 configuration, which will replace the solid rocket boosters on the Block 1 and 1 B vehicles with more powerful boosters, and will be capable of delivering at least 130 metric tons to LEO. The Block 2 vehicle will be capable of launching even larger 10 -meter diameter fairings, which will enable human mission of Mars. With these fairings, the Block 1 B and 2 configurations of SLS will also be enabling {{for a wide variety of}} other payloads. For robotic science probes to the outer solar system, for example, SLS can cut transit times to less than half that of currently available vehicles, producing earlier data return, enhancing iterative exploration, and reducing mission cost and risk. In the field of astrophysics, SLS high payload volume, in the form of payload fairings with a diameter of up to 10 meters, creates the opportunity for launch of large-aperture telescopes providing an unprecedented look at our universe, and offers the ability to conduct crewed servicing missions to observatories stationed at locations beyond low Earth orbit.

40|$|The {{objective}} of transportation infrastructure management {{is to provide}} optimal maintenance, rehabilitation and replacement (MR&R) policies for a system of facilities over a planning horizon. While most approaches in the literature have studied it as a finite resource allocation problem, {{the presence of an}} underlying network configuration has been largely ignored. The recognition of the network <b>configuration</b> <b>introduces</b> several challenges, as well as opportunities, for system-level MR&R decision-making, which cannot be adequately handled by the existing decision-making frameworks. This dissertation focuses on furthering the development of Markov decision process (MDP) -based system-level MR&R decision-making frameworks. In particular, two problems of interest are identified. The first problem concerns itself with identifying an optimal system-level optimization approach for solving budget allocation problems. The second problem of interest involves moving beyond traditional budget allocation problems to incorporate network considerations into system-level decision-making. In {{the first part of the}} dissertation, a revised MDP-based optimization framework is proposed for solving the budget allocation problem. The framework, referred to as simultaneous network optimization (SNO), combines the salient features of the different MDP-based optimization approaches in infrastructure management literature, and provides optimal facility-specific MR&R policies for budget allocation problems. The proposed methodology is then compared with the other state-of-the-art MDP methodologies using a parametric study involving varying system sizes. The results of the study indicate the SNO outperforms the other MDP-based optimization frameworks. In the second part of the dissertation, it is argued that while SNO is optimal for solving budget allocation problems, it can produce sub-optimal policies upon introducing network constraints. Consequently, the use of an approximated dynamic programming (ADP) framework is motivated to solve system-level MR&R decision-making problems involving network constraints. ADP facilitates the modeling of complex problem formulations by overcoming the curse of dimensionality associated with traditional dynamic programming frameworks. To assess the suitability of ADP for system-level infrastructure management, two scenarios involving network considerations are investigated. In the first scenario, an approximate dynamic programming framework is proposed, wherein capacity losses due to construction activities are subjected to an agency-defined network capacity threshold. A parametric study is conducted on a stylized network configuration to infer the impact of network-based constraints on the decision-making process. The results indicate that ADP performs better than SNO when the network capacity constraints are binding on the decision-making process. In the second scenario, the impact of introducing economies of scale (EOS) within budget allocation problems is investigated. Herein, incorporating network considerations leads to economic interdependence, wherein potential cost savings can be achieved by combining MR&R activities across adjacent road sections. Using parametric case studies, it is observed that the performances of ADP and SNO are comparable, with ADP improving upon the results of SNO under low budget and high EOS settings. In conclusion, the findings from this dissertation indicate that ADP is a robust modeling framework for MDP-based infrastructure management problems. While previous research illustrates the use of ADP in solving system-level budget allocation problems, it is shown here that ADP is more relevant for modeling problems involving complex inter-facility dynamics. In particular, ADP is most beneficial in scenarios wherein finding optimal policies using analytical frameworks is not feasible...|$|E
