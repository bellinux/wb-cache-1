He often serves as a mediator when tensions between the cast get high.|$|E

Battlefield commanders requested Boxer return to Korea as soon as possible, but she did not immediately return as commanders feared it might reduce the Navy's ability to respond if another <b>conflict</b> <b>or</b> emergency broke out elsewhere.|$|E

5|$|There is {{evidence}} of early human activity in the Birmingham area dating back 10,000 years, with stone age artefacts suggesting seasonal settlements, overnight hunting parties and woodland activities such as tree felling. The many burnt mounds that can still be seen around the city indicate that modern humans first intensively settled and cultivated the area during the bronze age, when a substantial but short-lived influx of population occurred between 1700BC and 1000BC, possibly caused by <b>conflict</b> <b>or</b> immigration in the surrounding area. During the 1st-century Roman conquest of Britain, the forested country of the Birmingham Plateau formed a barrier to the advancing Roman legions, who built the large Metchley Fort {{in the area of}} modern-day Edgbaston in AD48, and made it the focus of a network of Roman roads.|$|E
5|$|Much of the {{symbolism}} included in memorials was political in tone, and politics {{played an important}} part in their construction. Many memorials were embroiled in local ethnic and religious tensions, with memorials either reflecting the contribution of particular groups to the <b>conflict</b> <b>or</b> being rejected entirely by others. In several countries it proved difficult to produce memorials that appealed to and included the religious and political views of all of a community. The Fascist governments that came to power in Italy and Germany during the inter-war period made the construction of memorials a key part of their political programme, resulting in a number of larger memorial projects with strong national overtones being constructed in the 1930s. While few memorials embraced a pacifist perspective, some anti-war campaigners used the memorials for rallies and meetings. Many of the political tensions of the inter-war period had diminished {{by the end of the}} 20th century, allowing some countries to commemorate the events of the war through memorials for the first time since the end of the war. In the centennial of World War I, the memory of the war has become a major theme for scholars and museums.|$|E

40|$|Rule base have {{traditionally}} emphasized the verification of structural {{errors in the}} rule base. For <b>conflicting</b> <b>or</b> redundant rules, designated rules are usually followed to implement prioritized or direct deletions. However, there exist no proper methods by which to resolve <b>conflicting</b> <b>or</b> redundant rules. Due to the uncertainty of uncertain knowledge itself, {{it is difficult to}} treat conflicting rules, and the citation of erroneous knowledge leads to mistakes in decision making. Among users, 94 % report perplexity when <b>conflicting</b> <b>or</b> redundant rules are cited. It is therefore a necessity to confirm the existence and reliability of the cited knowledge. The current study attempts to provide an uncertain rule-based knowledge conflict treatment algorithm by integrating a group decision and an uncertain inference. In the algorithm, a “reliability factor ” refers to the reliability level of the <b>conflicting</b> <b>or</b> redundant rules, while the “certainty factor ” indicates the existence of the knowledge itself. A “certainty reliability index ” is used to show both the existence of the knowledge itself and its reliability. For <b>conflicting</b> <b>or</b> redundant rules, it is suggested that the knowledge with a higher reliability factor be chosen. Among users, 92 % reported that the algorithm is helpful to knowledge application and an aid to the decision-making process...|$|R
