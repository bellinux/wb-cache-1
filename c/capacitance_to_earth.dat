An inductor in a {{switching power}} supply is often connected to a node with high dv/dt and its influence on overall common mode current is investigated. In the present work it is discovered that an inductor does not produce much common mode noise compared to a MOSFET terminal. This is because the inductor core attracts an electric field from the windings and its <b>capacitance</b> <b>to</b> <b>earth</b> is reduced compared to one without a core. Simulation and experimental results, based on the emission map of the printed circuit board (PCB), are presented to clarify the ideas. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E

40|$|A measurements-based {{electrical}} method for locating partial discharges (PD) in transformers {{is described in}} the paper. This location method relies on the series resonance frequencies of the signals produced at the transformer terminals by a discharge on the winding. Based on the equivalent circuit of plain disc type winding which consists of series inductance (L), series capacitance (K) and shunt <b>capacitance</b> <b>to</b> <b>earth</b> (C) of the winding, an analytical location algorithm is derived which gives {{the relationship between the}} location of a discharge and its terminal response's series resonance frequencies. LKC parameters of the equivalent circuit can be estimated using the series resonance frequencies of a calibration signal measured at the bushing tap during PD calibration. The PD location algorithm was tested on 11 kV transformer winding using signals produced by a discharge simulator and real discharges, and the results confirm its validity with a location accuracy of better than 10 % of the winding length. However, blind area where this location algorithm is not applicable does exist near the neutral of the winding and far away from the measuring terminal. Since this location algorithm uses the series resonance frequencies below 500 kHz, it can be implemented with conventional PD measuring circuitry and instruments to detect and locate discharges in power transformers...|$|E
40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the computation of the current flowing at the earthed end of a resistor having uniformly distributed <b>capacitance</b> <b>to</b> <b>earth</b> when a unit step-function voltage is applied to it via an inductive lead. The circuit is analysed using the Laplace transformation and the current is then calculated as the sum of the residues at the poles of a transcendental function. An interesting result is that the time constant of the system with distributed capacitance and an inductive lead is the sum of the time constant for the system with distributed capacitance but without the inductive lead and the time constant for the system with an inductive lead but without capacitance. 1. Formulation of the problem HIGH impulse voltages are measured with the aid of voltage dividers by means of which a known fraotion of the total voltage is applied to a cathode ray oscillograph or other measuring instrument. The divider often consists of a network of resistors which should have very low inductances and one of which must be capable of supporting almost the total voltage. When this voltage is of the order of 1 MV the capacitances associated with the large dimensions of the high voltage resistor, in particular its earth capacitance, generally dominate the high frequency characteristics of the divider. In addition, the size of the test object and the necessity for adequate clearances around it may call for connections to the divider, by leads of such length that their inductance is significant. It is the object of this paper to calculate the effect of this inductive lead. A schematic diagram of the actual arrangement is given below. Inductive lead?

The part directly in contact with the earth - the [...] "earth electrode" [...] - can be as simple as a metal rod or stake driven into the earth, or a connection to buried metal water piping (the pipe must be conductive). Because high frequency signals can flow <b>to</b> <b>earth</b> due <b>to</b> capacitative effects, <b>capacitance</b> <b>to</b> ground is an important factor in effectiveness of signal grounds. Because of this, a complex system of buried rods and wires can be effective. An ideal signal ground maintains a fixed potential (zero) regardless of how much electric current flows into ground or out of ground. Low impedance at the signal frequency of the electrode-to-earth connection determines its quality, and that quality is improved by increasing the surface area of the electrode in contact with the earth, increasing the depth to which it is driven, using several connected ground rods, increasing the moisture content of the soil, improving the conductive mineral content of the soil, and increasing the land area covered by the ground system.|$|R

The system is isolated from ground and a first fault, such as a short circuit between a phase and ground, will not result in disconnection of the power via residential current devices. The power system does however have to be monitored to measure the fault and correct it, before a second fault occurs. The disadvantage is the maximum <b>capacitance</b> <b>to</b> ground which is allowed because the detection of a first fault to ground is interfered by those capacitances.

Strain can cause QDs because it changes the band structure, thus changing the energy of the conduction band and the valence band. I discuss the effects of strain in three common device architectures: a mesa-etched nanowire with poly-silicon gates, metal-gated bulk silicon, and chemically grown nanowires with metal contacts. Because strain can affect these very different architectures, I suggest that the strain in a QD can be as important as the electrostatics to understanding how a device works...|$|R
