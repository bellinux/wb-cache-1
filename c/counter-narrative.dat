40|$|Abstract: The {{study of}} <b>counter-narratives</b> is a promising, yet largely {{neglected}} approach to nar-rative studies. This review {{draws on the}} idea that counter-narrativity might theoretically and meth-odologically connect the cultural, political and personal contents of narratives with the forms of nar-ration in new ways. The anthology is discussed from the perspective of how each article contributes to identifying and theorizing both master and <b>counter-narratives.</b> At the same time, the book is introduced as an interesting forum for many current debates in qualitative research. The ongoing debate between contributors and discussants displays alternative strategies in reading narrative materials...|$|R
40|$|In this study, I {{investigated}} how {{lessons and}} interactions in an ESL classroom setting construct U. S. and immigrant cultural identities through narratives and <b>counter-narratives,</b> {{and how these}} narratives and <b>counter-narratives</b> reproduced and questioned relations of power {{along the lines of}} race, class, and gender difference. The theoretical framework for this intercultural study was informed by Co-cultural theory, CRT, LatCrit, language and power, and Whiteness studies. As the findings of the research show, the narratives constructed through language, interaction, and institutionalized practices in the ESL setting reproduced the ideology of the American Dream. The American Dream emerged as the enduring ideological field within which ESL learners and instructors make sense of U. S. and immigrant culture and identities. I argue that the American Dream ideology is the backbone of the dominant narratives of the dominant, White group of the U. S. American culture. The findings also indicate that while students, instructors, and administrator in the study reproduced dominant narratives, they also created <b>counter-narratives</b> or testimonios to question or resist the dominant narratives.

40|$|<b>Counter-narratives</b> {{only make}} sense in {{relation}} to something else, that which they are countering. The very name identifies it as a positional category, in tension with another category. But what is dominant and what is resistant are not, of course, static questions, but rather are forever shifting placements. The discussion of <b>counter-narratives</b> is ultimately a consideration of multiple layers of positioning. The fluidity of these relational categories is what lies {{at the center of}} the chapters and commentaries collected in this book. The book comprises six target chapters by leading scholars in the field. Twenty-two commentators discuss these chapters from a number of diverse vantage points, followed by responses from the six original authors.

In this presentation, Kathy will demonstrate how pedagogies that explore <b>counter-narratives</b> of cultural heritage in the official curriculum can encourage students to reframe their own racial identity, while challenging dominant white, historical narratives of colonial conquest, race, and power.

50|$|Since its {{founding}} in 1959, members of Brahma Vidya Mandir (BVM), an intentional community for women in Paunar, Maharashtra, {{have dealt with the}} struggle of translating Gandian values such as self-sufficiency, non-violence, and public-service into specific practices of food production and consumption. BVM's existence and the <b>counter-narrative</b> its residents practice demonstrate how one community debate the practicalities and tradeoffs in their application of self-sufficiency, non-violence, and radical democracy to their own social and geographic context. One narrative described by BVM and the farmers that work with them is that large-scale agriculture is inevitable, necessary, and the sole possibility of feeding the world. They reject the narrative that success in agriculture comes from expensive technology. BVM is a small community in India, therefore it does not hold much power in its beliefs and practices. However, India today proudly proclaims its large and growing middle class, and although many see Gandhi as a hero, some reject his views in favor of US-style-consumerism and look for an alternate route in agriculture with technological advancements. The existence of BVM provides a <b>counter-narrative</b> on enacting alternate agriculture practices and social practices that were believed by woman back in the 1960s.|$|E

40|$|Weight stigma {{results from}} the mediatisation of ‘obesity’; conceptually, a medicalised problem {{resulting}} from personal bodily irresponsibility. We undertake a frame analysis of 1452 comments on a thematically-related online news article published via The Guardian, {{about the status of}} ‘obesity’ as a disability in EU employment law. We identify three themes: weight as a lifestyle choice or disability; weight as an irresponsible choice, and weight as a simple or complex issue. We contend that the design of the commenting platform prevents <b>counter-narratives</b> from challenging the dominant (‘obesity’) framing for three reasons: content is driven by comments appearing earlier in the corpus; the commenting system primarily supports argument between polarised rhetorical positions, and the platform design discourages users from developing alternative terminologies for producing <b>counter-narratives.</b> In this way, we explore how weight stigma is propagated through online media, and how users’ comments intersect with the affordances of the platform itself...|$|R

40|$|The {{articles}} {{gathered in}} this volume focus on <b>counter-narratives</b> of the nation that question the dominant nationalist representations and explore the mechanisms of manufacturing national unity through the exclusion of alterity. The contributors attempt to answer several questions connected with the problematic concept of nation: How does the nation write its other(s) ? How does the other re-write the nation? What cultural artefacts are instrumental in the processes of continual re-inscription? How is one's nationality lived? What symbolic practices does the formation of national identity entail? What {{is the role of}} the category of "nation" in the production of race, gender, bodies? What are the restrictions as well as the potential openings present in the notion of nation? The Nation of the Other gathers multiple perspectives and identifies various aspects of alterity in national discourses and their <b>counter-narratives.</b> The editors hope that the volume, showing different approaches to resistance, should help the readers re-imagine the nation as a community of Others: a site of heterogeneity, fluidity and transformation...|$|R
40|$|This {{document}} was developed {{with the support}} of the Australian Government by the Hedayah Institute, the International Centre of Excellence for Countering Violent Extremism based in Abu Dhabi. While there are other counter narrative 2 ̆ 7 how to 2 ̆ 7 guides available, this is the first of its kind to focus on South East Asia. Across the globe, international organisations and governments are grappling with the complex challenge of developing better and more coordinated responses to groups such as Daesh, as well as defining methods to prevent further radicasliation and recruitment, or the emergence of new violent extremism and terrorism. This compendium provides practical guidance and insights for governments, policy makers and civil society organisations in Australia and South East Asia to support their development of effective <b>counter-narratives</b> that undercut the appeal of terrorist propaganda. Drawing on research by author Sara Zeiger and an expert workshop convened by Hedayah in Indonesia in March 2016, the compendium includes a practical step-by-step approach to developing effective <b>counter-narratives,</b> with clear examples from South East Asia. With Australian Government support, Hedayah will be in a position to ensure that its secure online library of <b>counter-narratives</b> and positive messages drawn from around the world now includes our regional perspectives.

40|$|This paper {{draws on}} an oral archive project on {{narratives}} of return migration in contemporary Ireland, {{as the basis}} for a discussion on the potential of life narrative research to destabilize meta-narratives and to contribute to the mapping of transformative geographies. It is argued that this kind of research requires the creation of safe spaces within which participants can tell their stories and articulate <b>counter-narratives.</b> At the same time, it is important to make their voices available to a wide audience and to recognize their authorial roles. There are contrasting perspectives in oral history and life narrative research on the use of anonymity to protect participants 2 ̆ 7 identities, which reflect different disciplinary traditions and practices. The paper reflects on these different perspectives and on the process of designing a research project that draws on multiple methodological influences.
