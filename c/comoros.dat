5|$|The {{invasion}} of Anjouan (code-named Operation Democracy in <b>Comoros),</b> on March 25, 2008, was an amphibious assault {{led by the}} <b>Comoros,</b> backed by African Union (AU) forces, including troops from Sudan, Tanzania, Senegal, along with logistical support from Libya and France. The objective of the invasion was to topple Colonel Mohamed Bacar's leadership in Anjouan, an island part of the Union of <b>Comoros,</b> when he refused to step down after a disputed 2007 election, {{in defiance of the}} federal government and the AU. The <b>Comoros</b> archipelago in the Indian Ocean has had a fractious history since independence from France in 1975, experiencing more than 20 coups or attempted coups.|$|E

5|$|During the 2000s, {{molecular}} {{studies have}} revealed that the widely distributed African, Eurasian, and Australian genus Miniopterus is much more species-rich than previously thought. In a 1995 contribution to Faune de Madagascar on Malagasy bats, Randolph Peterson and colleagues listed four species of Miniopterus on Madagascar and the nearby <b>Comoros,</b> including the small Miniopterus manavi with a broad distribution on both Madagascar and the <b>Comoros.</b> In 2008 and 2009, however, Steven Goodman and colleagues presented evidence that the former concept of M.manavi in fact encompassed five morphologically and molecularly distinct species of small Miniopterus. These included M.manavi itself in the Central Highlands, M.griveaudi and M.aelleni in the <b>Comoros</b> and northern and western Madagascar, M.brachytragos in northern and western Madagascar only, and M.mahafaliensis in southwestern Madagascar. The five recognized species of M.manavi-like bats are not each other's closest relatives, but apparently acquired their similarities through convergent evolution.|$|E

5|$|Miniopterus griveaudi is a bat in {{the genus}} Miniopterus found on Grande Comore and Anjouan in the <b>Comoros</b> and in {{northern}} and western Madagascar. First described in 1959 from Grande Comore as a subspecies {{of the mainland}} African M.minor, it was later placed with the Malagasy M.manavi. However, morphological and molecular studies published in 2008 and 2009 indicated that M.manavi as then defined contained five distinct, unrelated species, and M.griveaudi was redefined as a species occurring on both Madagascar and the <b>Comoros.</b>|$|E
5|$|Miniopterus manavi (Manavi long-fingered bat) is a bat in {{the genus}} Miniopterus {{that occurs in}} east-central Madagascar.

A 1995 revision united populations of small Miniopterus from Madagascar and the <b>Comoros</b> as M.manavi, but molecular and morphological studies in 2008 and 2009 showed that this concept of M.manavi in fact included five different species. M.manavi itself was restricted to a few locations in the eastern Central Highlands and populations in the <b>Comoros</b> and northern and western Madagascar were allocated to different species.|$|E

5|$|The only deadly {{storm of}} the season was Elinah, which formed on January9 in the Mozambique Channel. It moved to the {{southwest}} and was intensifying when it struck <b>Comoros</b> on January11. There, high winds and waves heavily damaged banana and coconut crops, and the storm damaged or destroyed 4,357buildings. High waves knocked 40people off a pier on Anjouan, killing 33 of them. Damage in <b>Comoros</b> totaled $23.1million (1983USD). Elinah intensified before brushing the coast of Mozambique, and it dissipated on January9. Aside from a weak storm classified by the JTWC in February, there was minimal activity for several months. The final storm {{of the season}} was Tropical Depression Fely, which dropped moderate rainfall in eastern Madagascar in late June.|$|E
50|$|It is a medium-large bird, inhabiting {{forests and}} {{woodlands}} in Madagascar and the <b>Comoro</b> Islands. Three subspecies are described: the nominate L. d. discolor {{is found in}} Madagascar and Mayotte Island, L. d. intermedius on Anjouan, and L. d. gracilis of Grand <b>Comoro.</b> Based on its smaller size, differences in the plumage, and minor difference in the voice, the last of these is sometimes considered a separate species, the <b>Comoro</b> cuckoo roller (L. gracilis).|$|R
50|$|The IBA was {{identified}} as such by BirdLife International because it supports populations of <b>Comoro</b> olive-pigeons, <b>Comoro</b> blue-pigeons, Mayotte drongos, Mayotte white-eyes and Mayotte sunbirds.

By May 1947, however, the French military had begun to counter the nationalists' attacks.

However, French army strength remained modest with soldiers numbering 18,000 in April 1947. The number of troops increased to about 30,000 in 1948. The French forces now included paratroopers, soldiers of the French Foreign Legion, and tirailleurs (colonial infantry) brought in from the French territories of <b>Comoros</b> and Senegal.|$|E
