50|$|Secondary {{structure}} predictions {{predicted a}} stem loop {{to be present}} at the 3' end of the roX RNA transcripts. Mutagenesis within this region that either altered the sequence or prevented stem loop formation was shown to be lethal in male flies as {{they were unable to}} dosage compensate as these mutations prevented MSL binding to the X chromosome. It was also shown that in the presence of mutant roX RNA the MSL complex was unable to localize on the X chromosome and mislocalize to the heterochromatic <b>chromocenter.</b> This suggests that roX RNA plays a role in directing MSL complex to the X chromosome. Sequence alignment of roX2 identified several regions of sequence conservation known as Gub regions and are absent in roX1. Many of these Gub regions are thought to be redundant as mutating has no effect however, Gub1 which is present within the 3' stem loop region is thought to be a key motif required for roX2 as Gub1 mutations were shown to be lethal. These studies show that roX RNA are essential for dosage compensation where that the 3' stem loop region in the roX RNA are crucial for MSL localization and it is thought to be the motif that allows the two roX RNAs to be functionally redundant.|$|E

Staining with 4 ', 6 -diamidino- 2 -phenylindole/actinomycin D and chromomycin A(3) /distamycin, immunodetection of 5 -methylcytidine and AgNOR test were used. The results revealed AT-rich/GC-poor DNA in the male <b>chromocenter,</b> but equally distributed AT and GC DNA sequences in male and female euchromatin, like in T. infestans. Accumulation of argyrophilic proteins encircling the <b>chromocenter</b> did not always correlate with that of GC-rich DNA. Methylated DNA identified by immunodetection was found sparsely distributed in the euchromatin of both sexes and at some points around the <b>chromocenter</b> edge, but it could not be considered responsible for chromatin condensation in the <b>chromocenter,</b> like in T. infestans.

40|$|International audienceAt {{the time}} of fertilization, the {{paternal}} genome lacks the typical configuration and marks characteristic of pericentric heterochromatin. It is thus essential to understand the dynamics of this region during early development, its importance during that time period and how a somatic configuration is attained. Here, we show that pericentric satellites undergo a transient peak in expression precisely at {{the time of}} <b>chromocenter</b> formation. This transcription is regulated in a strand-specific manner in time and space and is strongly biased by the parental asymmetry. The transcriptional upregulation follows a developmental clock, yet when replication is blocked <b>chromocenter</b> formation is impeded. Furthermore, interference with major satellite transcripts using locked nucleic acid (LNA) -DNA gapmers results in developmental arrest before completion of <b>chromocenter</b> formation.

40|$|Despite recent {{progress}} in genome topology knowledge, {{the role of}} repeats, which make {{up the majority of}} mammalian genomes, remains elusive. Satellite repeats are highly abundant sequences that cluster around centromeres, attract pericentromeric heterochromatin, and aggregate into nuclear <b>chromocenters.</b> These nuclear landmark structures are assumed to form a repressive compartment in the nucleus to which genes are recruited for silencing. We have designed a strategy for genome-wide identification of pericentromere-associated domains (PADs) in different mouse cell types. The ∼ 1000 PADs and non-PADs have similar chromatin states in embryonic stem cells, but during lineage commitment, <b>chromocenters</b> progressively associate with constitutively inactive genomic regions at the nuclear periphery. This suggests that PADs are not actively recruited to <b>chromocenters,</b> but that <b>chromocenters</b> are themselves attracted to inactive chromatin compartments. However, we also found that experimentally induced proximity of an active locus to <b>chromocenters</b> was sufficient to cause gene repression. Collectively, our data suggest that rather than driving nuclear organization, pericentromeric satellite repeats mostly co-segregate with inactive genomic regions into nuclear compartments where they can contribute to stable maintenance of the repressed status of proximal chromosomal regions...|$|R

AtMBD 2, previously shown to be incapable of binding in vitro–methylated CpG, was dispersed within the nucleus, excluding <b>chromocenters</b> and the nucleolus.

Transient expression of DDM 1 fused to GFP showed that DDM 1 shares common sites with AtMBD proteins. Glutathione S-transferase pull-down assays demonstrated that AtMBDs bind DDM 1; the MBD motif was sufficient for this interaction. Our results suggest that the subnuclear localization of AtMBD is not solely dependent on CpG methylation; DDM 1 may facilitate localization of AtMBDs at specific nuclear domains...|$|R

We have now observed that a prominent feature of the aberrant spermatid nuclei is a fragmented <b>chromocenter,</b> a structure comprised of peri-centromeric heterochromatin. There was a concomitant increase in the levels of heterochromatin protein 1 alpha (Hp 1 α), suggesting {{that the presence of}} multiple chromocenters was correlated with a spread of heterochromatin beyond the normal centromeric region. Brdt protein was normally present throughout the nucleus but was excluded from the <b>chromocenter.</b> A more densely staining region of Brdt protein appeared to separate sirtuin 1 (Sirt 1) protein from contact with the <b>chromocenter.</b> Although still nuclear, this unique localization of Brdt protein was lost in Brdt∆BD 1 /∆BD 1 mutant spermatids and Brdt and Sirt 1 overlapped around the chromocenters. There was also ectopic localization of the H 1 histone family, member N, testis-specific (H 1 fnt) protein in Brdt∆BD 1 /∆BD 1 round spermatids, which may be linked to the previously reported loss of polarized localization of peri-nuclear heterochromatin foci. The extent of <b>chromocenter</b> fragmentation was more severe and penetrant in mutant testes on a pure 129 Sv/Ev as compared to a pure C 57 Bl/ 6 background. Indeed, all aspects of the mutant phenotype were more severe on the 129 Sv/Ev background. Contrary to previous studies in genetic models where fragmented chromocenters were observed in spermatids, the Brdt∆BD 1 /∆BD 1 mutant spermatids do not undergo apoptosis (on either background). These observations suggest that the first bromodomain of Brdt is critical in the formation and/or maintenance of an intact <b>chromocenter</b> and implicate this structure in proper remodeling of the chromatin architecture of the sperm head...|$|E

Effects were measured as the degree of silencing of a wild-type brown eye pigment gene by bw(D) across a tandem duplication. A series of X-ray-induced effects were recovered at high frequency. Cis-acting enhancers were obtained by relocation of the duplication closer to autosomal heterochromatin. Enhancers were also recovered on the homologous chromosome when it was similarly rearranged, revealing a novel interhomologue effect whereby interactions occur between genetic elements near opposite ends of a chromosome arm rather than between paired alleles. Cis-acting suppressors were obtained as secondary rearrangements in which the duplication was moved farther away from heterochromatin. Suppression was correlated with loss of cytological association between bw(D) and the polytene <b>chromocenter.</b> Surprisingly, the distance from bw(D) to the <b>chromocenter</b> was not correlated with the strength of enhancement or suppression. We propose that bw(D) fails to coalesce with the <b>chromocenter</b> when its position along the chromosome places it beyond a threshold distance from heterochromatin, and this threshold depends upon the configuration of both the chromosome carrying bw(D) and its paired homologue...|$|E

These proteins differ, however, in their subnuclear localization pattern; AtMBD 5 and AtMBD 6, each containing a single MBD motif, show preference for two perinucleolar <b>chromocenters,</b> whereas AtMBD 7, a naturally occurring poly-MBD protein containing three MBD motifs, localizes to all <b>chromocenters.</b> Here we studied {{the significance of}} multiple MBD motifs for subnuclear localization and mobility in living cells.

Furthermore, live kinetic experiments showed that AtMBD 7 -green fluorescent protein (GFP) has lower mobility than AtMBD 5 -GFP and AtMBD 6 -GFP, which is conferred by cooperative activity of its three MBD motifs. Thus, the number of MBD motifs appears to affect not only binding affinity and mobility within the nucleus, but also the subnuclear localization of the protein. Our results suggest that poly-MBD proteins can directly affect chromatin structure by inducing intra- and inter-chromatin compaction via bridging over multiple methylated CpG sites...|$|R

40|$|DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) can induce {{chromosomal}} aberrations and carcinogenesis {{and their}} correct repair {{is crucial for}} genetic stability. The cellular response to DSBs depends on damage signaling including the phosphorylation of the histone H 2 AX (γH 2 AX). However, a lack of γH 2 AX formation in heterochromatin (HC) is generally observed after DNA damage induction. Here, we examine γH 2 AX and repair protein foci along linear ion tracks traversing heterochromatic regions in human or murine cells and find the DSBs and damage signal streaks bending around highly compacted DNA. Given the linear particle path, such bending indicates a relocation of damage from the initial induction site to the periphery of HC. Real-time imaging of the repair protein GFP-XRCC 1 confirms fast recruitment to heterochromatic lesions inside murine <b>chromocenters.</b> Using single-ion microirradiation to induce localized DSBs directly within <b>chromocenters,</b> we demonstrate that H 2 AX is early phosphorylated within HC, but the damage site is subsequently expelled from the center to the periphery of <b>chromocenters</b> within ∼ 20 [*]min. While this process can occur {{in the absence of}} ATM kinase, the repair of DSBs bordering HC requires the protein.

Mutations of aromatic cage residues that recognize methyl K 9 of histone H 3 abolished their punctuated distribution and localization to <b>chromocenters.</b> Sl LHP 1 -GFP plants displayed cell type–dependent subnuclear localization. The diverse localization pattern of tomato LHP 1 did not require the chromo shadow domain (CSD), whereas the chromodomain alone was insufficient for localization to chromocenters; a nucleolar localization signal was identified within the hinge region. Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching showed that Sl LHP 1 is a highly mobile protein whose localization and retention are controlled by distinct domains; retention at the nucleolus and <b>chromocenters</b> is conferred by the CSD. Our results imply that LHP 1 recruitment to chromatin is mediated, at least in part, through interaction with methyl K 9 and that LHP 1 controls different nuclear processes via transient binding to its nuclear sites...|$|R

Ectopic expression of fluorescently tagged MeCP 2 mimicked this effect, causing a dose-dependent clustering of <b>chromocenters</b> in the absence of differentiation. MeCP 2 -induced rearrangement of heterochromatin occurred throughout interphase, did not depend on the H 3 K 9 histone methylation pathway, and required the methyl CpG–binding domain (MBD) only. Similar to MeCP 2, another methyl CpG–binding protein, MBD 2, also increased during myogenic differentiation and could induce clustering of pericentric regions, arguing for functional redundancy.

The role of higher-order chromatin organization in regulating the endosperm genome was long ignored due to technical hindrance. We developed a combination of approaches to analyze nuclear structure and chromatin organization in Arabidopsis thaliana endosperm. Endosperm nuclei showed a less condensed chromatin than other types of nuclei and a peculiar heterochromatin organization, with smaller <b>chromocenters</b> and additional heterochromatic foci interspersed in euchromatin. This is accompanied by a redistribution of the heterochromatin mark H 3 K 9 me 1 from <b>chromocenters</b> toward euchromatin and interspersed heterochromatin. Thus, endosperm nuclei have a specific nuclear architecture and organization, which we interpret as a relaxed chromocenter-loop model. The analysis of endosperm with altered parental genome dosage indicated that the additional heterochromatin may be predominantly of maternal origin, suggesting differential regulation of maternal and paternal genomes, possibly linked to genome dosage regulation...|$|R

Embryos treated with double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) targeting pchet 2 also exhibit chromosome abnormalities, such as aberrant chromosome condensation, and also the presence of metaphases that contain ‘lagging’ chromosomes.

Disruption of pericentromeric repeats condensation is coincident with transcriptional reactivation of specific classes of pericentromeric 180 -bp repeats.

To address this question, we investigated <b>chromocenter</b> formation and the peculiar arrangements of chromosome domains in early mouse embryos. At the one-cell stage, we observed characteristic arrangements of chromosomes and <b>chromocenter</b> components. Subsequently, starting with the burst of zygotic genome transcription major rearrangements led to the establishment of somatic type chromocenters with a defined spatio-temporal organization. These processes appeared to be completed at the blastocyst stage with the onset of cell differentiation. During the same developmental period, a fraction of pericentric heterochromatin that was late replicating in the first cycle underwent switches in replication timing, spatial organization and epigenetic marks. Cloning experiments revealed that the genome organization typical for more advanced stages was quickly reverted into the one-cell stage-specific form after nuclear transfer, supporting the idea that reprogramming associated genome remodeling in normal and cloned embryos is determined by cytoplasmic factors. Together, the results suggest that distinct but characteristic forms of nuclear genome organization are required for genome reprogramming in early embryos and for proper regulation of differential gene expression patterns at later stages...|$|E
40|$|In the Suppressor of Underreplication (SuUR) mutant {{strain of}} Drosophila melanogaster, the {{heterochromatin}} of polytene chromosomes is not underreplicated and, as a consequence, {{a number of}} P-heterochromatic regions acquire a banded structure. The <b>chromocenter</b> does not form in these polytene chromosomes, and heterochromatic regions, normally part of the <b>chromocenter,</b> become accessible to cytological analysis. We generated four genomic DNA libraries from specific heterochromatic regions by microdissection of polytene chromosomes. In situ hybridization of individual libraries onto SuUR polytene chromosomes shows that repetitive DNA sequences spread into the neighboring euchromatic regions. This observation allows the localization of eu-heterochromatin transition zones on polytene chromosomes. We find that genomic scaffolds from the eu-heterochromatin transition zones are enriched in repetitive DNA sequences homologous to those flanking the suppressor of forked gene [su(f) repeat]. We isolated and sequenced about 300 clones from the heterochromatic DNA libraries obtained. Most of the clones contain repetitive DNA sequences; however, some of the clones have unique DNA sequences shared with parts of unmapped genomic scaffolds. Hybridization of these clones onto SuUR polytene chromosomes allowed us to assign the cytological localizations of the corresponding genomic scaffolds within heterochromatin. Our results demonstrate that the SuUR mutant renders possible the mapping of heterochromatic scaffolds on polytene chromosomes...|$|E

40|$|Kaposi’s sarcoma-associated {{herpesvirus}} (KSHV) -infected cells {{express the}} latency-associated nuclear an-tigen (LANA) {{involved in the}} regulation of host and viral gene expression and maintenance of the KSHV latent episome. Performance of these diverse functions involves a 7 -amino-acid chromatin-binding motif (CBM) situated at the amino terminus of LANA {{that is capable of}} binding directly to nucleosomes. LANA interacts with additional chromatin components, including methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MeCP 2). Here, we show that the carboxy-terminal DNA-binding/dimerization domain of LANA provides the principal interaction with MeCP 2 but that this association is modulated by the CBM. Both domains are required for LANA to colocalize with MeCP 2 at <b>chromocenters,</b> regions of extensive pericentric heterochromatin that can be imaged by fluorescence microscopy. Within MeCP 2, the methyl-CpG-binding domain (MBD) is the primary determinant for chromatin localization and acts together with the adjacent repression domains (the transcription repres-sion domain [TRD] and the corepressor-interacting domain [CRID]) to redirect LANA to <b>chromocenters.</b> MeCP 2 facilitates repression by LANA bound to the KSHV terminal repeats, a function that requires the MeCP 2 C terminus in addition to the MBD and CRID/TRD. LANA and MeCP 2 can also cooperate to stimulate transcription of the human E 2 F 1 promoter, which lacks a LANA DNA-binding sequence, but this function requires both the N and C termini of LANA. The ability of LANA to establish multivalent interactions wit...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT In Arabidopsis, pericentromeric repeats, retroelements, and silenced rRNA {{genes are}} {{assembled}} into heterochromatin within nuclear structures known as <b>chromocenters.</b> The mechanisms governing higher-order heterochromatin organization are poorly understood but 24 -nt small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) {{are known to}} play key roles in heterochromatin formation. Nuclear RNA polymerase IV (Pol IV), RNA-DEPENDENT RNA POLYMERASE 2 (RDR 2), and DICER-LIKE 3 (DCL 3) are required for biogenesis of 24 -nt siRNAs that associate with ARGONAUTE 4 (AGO 4). Nuclear RNA polymerase V (Pol V) collaborates with DRD 1 (DEFICIENT IN RNA-DEPENDENT DNA METHYLATION 1) to generate transcripts at heterochromatic loci that are hypothesized to bind to siRNA-AGO 4 complexes and subsequently recruit the de-novo DNA methylation and/or histone modifying machinery. Here, we report that decondensation of the major pericentromeric repeats and depletion of the heterochromatic mark histone H 3 lysine 9 dimethylation at <b>chromocenters</b> occurs specifically in pol V and drd 1 mutants. Disruption of pericentromeric repeats condensation is coincident with transcriptional reactivation of specific classes of pericentromeric 180 -bp repeats. We further demonstrate that Pol V functions independently of Pol IV, RDR 2, and DCL 3 -mediated siRNA production to affect interphase heterochromatin organization, possibly by involving RNAs that recruit structural or chromatin-modifying proteins.
