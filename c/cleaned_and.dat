40|$|This study {{compared}} the biomechanical {{characteristics of the}} log lift <b>and</b> <b>clean</b> <b>and</b> jerk. Six experienced male strongman athletes performed log lifts <b>and</b> <b>clean</b> <b>and</b> jerks at 70 % of their 1 RM <b>clean</b> <b>and</b> jerk. Significant (p< 0. 05) between-exercise kinematic differences were observed throughout all the lifting phases, except at lift completion. The log lift demonstrated significantly greater trunk (↑ 24 %) and hip (↑ 9 %) range of motion than the <b>clean</b> <b>and</b> jerk. Significantly greater peak bar velocities were achieved in the <b>clean</b> <b>and</b> jerk in the second pull (16 %) and the jerk (↑ 14 %). While similarities existed in ground reaction force data between the lifts, mean and peak powers were significantly greater (↑ 40 % to ↑ 64 %) in propulsive phases of the <b>clean</b> <b>and</b> jerk. The log lift may be an effective conditioning stimulus to teach rapid triple extension while generating similar vertical and anteriorpropulsive forces as the <b>clean</b> <b>and</b> jerk with the same given load...|$|R

5|$|As {{part of his}} {{contract}} with the Batavian Society, van Kinsbergen had to take photographs of Borobudur, which had just been <b>cleaned</b> <b>and</b> restored. However, {{when he went to}} photograph the Panataran Hindu temple complex in East Java in 1867, he ran out of chemicals. In his enthusiasm for photographing the many reliefs of the temple complex, he used up so many glass slides that he could not go to Borobudur as he had intended to. The Society was nervous about van Kinsbergen's delay, so they did not grant his request to supply new slides.|$|E
5|$|Authentic bird's nest soup is {{made from}} the nests of the edible-nest swiftlet (or white-nest swiftlet), Aerodramus fuciphagus, and the black-nest swiftlet, Aerodramus maximus. Instead of {{incorporating}} twigs, feathers and straw like others in the genus, these two swiftlets make their nest only from strands of their gummy saliva, which harden when exposed to air. Once the nests are harvested, they are <b>cleaned</b> <b>and</b> sold to restaurants. Over the past twenty years, the high demand for the nests of these Aerodramus species has had an adverse effect on their populations. The Niah caves population of black-nest swiftlets plunged from around 1.5 million pairs in 1959 to 150,000–298,000 pairs in the early 1990s through over-harvesting.|$|E

5|$|In 1986, the station's twin towers, {{which had}} been Grade II listed in 1972, were {{restored}} in a project costing £242,000 (now £). The works revealed that the east tower still contained a large water tank which was used during the days of steam traction to replenish locomotives and to power the station's hydraulic systems. The brickwork was repaired, <b>cleaned</b> <b>and</b> repointed, and the weather vanes gilded to complement the dome of nearby St Paul's Cathedral.

5|$|In {{response}} to a typhus epidemic in the women's camp, Mengele cleared one block of 600 Jewish women {{and sent them to}} the gas chamber. The building was then <b>cleaned</b> <b>and</b> disinfected, and the occupants of a neighboring block were bathed, de-loused, and given new clothing before being moved into the clean block. The process was repeated until all the barracks were disinfected. Similar disinfections were used for later epidemics of scarlet fever and other diseases, but with all the sick prisoners being sent to the gas chambers. For his efforts, Mengele was awarded the War Merit Cross (Second Class with Swords) and was promoted in 1944 to First Physician of the Birkenau subcamp.|$|E
