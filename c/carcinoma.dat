In 60 % of the sporadic <b>carcinomas,</b> gains in the regions of chromosome 12 were observed which were absent in the FAP-related <b>carcinomas</b> (P= 0. 04). Hypermethylation was observed in the immunoglobulin superfamily genes member 4 (IGSF 4), TIMP metallopeptidase inhibitor 3 (TIMP 3), Estrogen receptor 1 (ESR 1), adenomatous polyposis coli (APC), H-cadherin (CDH 13) and paired box gene 6 (PAX 6) genes. Hypermethylation of PAX 6 was only observed in FAP-related <b>carcinomas</b> (3 / 5) and not in sporadic <b>carcinomas</b> (P= 0. 02). In conclusion, in contrast to sporadic duodenal <b>carcinomas,</b> gains on chromosome 12 were not observed in duodenal <b>carcinomas</b> of patients with FAP. Identification of the genes in these regions of chromosome 12 could lead to a better understanding of the carcinogenesis pathways leading to sporadic and FAP-related duodenal <b>carcinomas.</b> Furthermore, hypermethylation seems to be a general feature of both FAP-related duodenal <b>carcinomas</b> as well as sporadic duodenal <b>carcinomas</b> with the exception of the PAX 6 gene, which is methylated only in FAP-related <b>carcinomas...</b>|$|R
