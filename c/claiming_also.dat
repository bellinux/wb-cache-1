Price has since reacted angrily to such claims and McGaugh has also expressed skepticism about this explanation.

The members of the Sailor Gang lived pleasantly for many months, but then things started going downhill. They were almost always drunk, got into fights, and made rash decisions, to the point where one of their members shot another. They tried {{to take him to the}} local field hospital, and all of his gang (except one who was given immunity for his testimony at their trials) alleged that he died on the way, <b>claiming</b> <b>also</b> that Pringle and the gang leader shot the man after he was dead several times so it would look like a Mafia killing.

40|$|The common {{practices}} of machine learning {{appear to be}} frustrated {{by a number of}} theoretical results denying the possibility of any meaningful implementation of a “superior” learning algorithm. However, there exist some general assumptions that, even when overlooked, preside the activity of researchers and practitioners. A thorough reflection over such essential premises brings forward the meta-learning approach as the most suitable for escaping the long-dated riddle of induction <b>claiming</b> <b>also</b> an epistemologic soundness. Several examples of meta-learning models can be found in literature, yet the combination of computational intelligence techniques with meta-learning models still remains scarcely explored. Our contribution to this particular research line consists in the realisation of Mindful, a meta-learning system based on the neuro-fuzzy hybridisation. We present the Mindful system firstly situating it inside the general context of the meta-learning frameworks proposed in literature. Finally, a complete session of experiments is illustrated, comprising both base-level and meta-level learning activity. The appreciable experimental results underline the suitability of the Mindful system for managing past accumulated learning experience while facing novel tasks...|$|E
40|$|This article {{considers}} {{an aspect}} of the complex relationship between the two best-known British Hispanophiles, Richard Ford and William Stirling, as the starting point for an examination of their response to Goya's art, in particular, his Santa Justa and Santa Rufina (1817, Seville Cathedral). In February 1845, William Stirling went to Spain to carry out further research for his Annals of the Artists of Spain (1848), taking with him {{one of the very few}} copies of the suppressed edition of Ford's Hand-Book for Spain (1845). Among the paintings he made notes on was Goya's Santa Justa and Santa Rufina, which Ford had attacked as a 'David-like abomination', <b>claiming</b> <b>also</b> that the models for the virgin martyrs were strumpets. Stirling disagreed with Ford's assessment, but, by the time his Annals were published in 1848, he had come much closer to Ford's view. The article ponders the reasons for Ford's attack on this work by Goya, and for Stirling's change of mind. Their assessment of the painting is also considered in the context of how much each knew about Goya's art at this time, including other examples of his works they saw or wrote about. Both writers reacted against the neo-classical aspects of the painting, and the article considers this in the light of Ceán Bermúdez's close involvement in this commission for Seville Cathedral, and his publication of a pamphlet on the painting in 1817. Stirling, however, became an important collector of Goya's works, some of which were illustrated or referred to in the Annals. His entry on the artist also incorporated other myths, in addition to that supplied by Ford, notably provided by Bartolomé José Gallardo and Théophile Gautier. Nevertheless, it was surprisingly balanced, and provided the most extensive and appreciative account of the artist in English by...|$|E
