5|$|Fascism {{has been}} {{prescribed}} dubious stances on feminism by its practitioners and by women's groups. Amongst other demands concerning social reform {{presented in the}} Fascist manifesto in 1919 was expanding the suffrage to all Italian citizens of age 18 and above, including women (accomplished only in 1946, after the defeat of fascism) and eligibility for all to stand for office from age 25. This demand was particularly championed by special Fascist women's auxiliary {{groups such as the}} fasci femminilli and only partly realized in 1925, under pressure from Prime Minister Benito Mussolini's more conservative <b>coalition</b> <b>partners.</b>|$|E

5|$|Opposition {{parties and}} three <b>coalition</b> <b>partners</b> of the Bharatiya Janata Party-led central {{government}} demanded {{the dismissal of}} Gujarat chief minister Narendra Modi for failing to contain the violence, with some calling {{for the removal of}} Union Home Minister L. K. Advani as well. On 18 July 2002, Modi asked the governor of Gujarat, Sunder Singh Bhandari, to dissolve the state assembly and call fresh elections. The Indian Election Commission ruled out early elections, citing the prevailing law and order situation, a decision the union government unsuccessfully appealed against in the Supreme Court. Elections were held in December and Modi returned to power.|$|E
5|$|Slovenia– September 2011– Following {{the failure}} of June referendums on {{measures}} to combat the economic crisis and the departure of <b>coalition</b> <b>partners,</b> the Borut Pahor government lost a motion of confidence and December 2011 early elections were set, following which Janez Janša became PM. After a year of rigorous saving measures, and also due to continuous opening of ideological question, the centre-right government of Janez Janša was ousted on 27 February 2013 by nomination of Alenka Bratušek as the PM-designated of a new centre-left coalition government.|$|E
5|$|The result {{confirmed}} the worries of some, including Spaak, {{that the vote}} would not be sufficiently decisive in either direction and could divide the country along regional and linguistic lines. On 13 March, Eyskens traveled to Pregny to attempt to encourage Leopold to abdicate. Paul Van Zeeland and Spaak attempted to broker a new agreement by which Leopold would abdicate in favour of his son. On 15 April 1950, Leopold {{announced that he was}} willing to temporarily delegate his authority. Many within the PSC–CVP realised that, despite the referendum's result, their party's lack of a parliamentary majority would undermine their ability to build a national reconciliation around the King as long as their Liberal <b>coalition</b> <b>partners</b> and Socialist opponents were unwilling to accept the King's return.|$|E

5|$|When {{the commune}} {{elections}} {{were held in}} February 2002, FUNCINPEC performed poorly, winning control over 10 {{out of a total}} of 1,621 communes across Cambodia. Subsequently, rifts within the party boiled into the open as Khan Savoeun, a Deputy Commander-in-chief of the RCAF, accused its co-Minister of the Interior, You Hockry of practising nepotism and corruption. At the same time, Hang Dara and Norodom Chakrapong – the latter had returned to FUNCINPEC in March 1999 – formed their own splinter parties and took along a large number of FUNCINPEC party members. A year later in July 2003, The general elections were held, and took 20.8% of the votes, which entitled them to 26 seats in the National Assembly. While the CPP won the election, it still lacked the constitutional requirement of having a two-thirds majority on its own in forming a new government without the support of other <b>coalition</b> <b>partners.</b>|$|E
25|$|This opportunist {{alliance}} {{not only}} has the handicap of having to cater to too many ideologically opposing factions, but it is usually short lived since any perceived or actual imbalance in the treatment of <b>coalition</b> <b>partners,</b> or changes to leadership in the <b>coalition</b> <b>partners</b> themselves, can very easily result in the coalition partner withdrawing its support from the government.|$|E

40|$|Research on multiparty {{negotiation}} {{has investigated}} how parties form coalitions to secure payoffs {{but has not}} assessed the underlying self-regulatory and physiological principles. Integrating insights from research on the social functions of emotions and the bio-psychosocial model as proposed by Blascovich and colleagues, we assessed threat and challenge responses to anger communication in a three-player coalition setting. Depending on condition, participants were confronted with an angry message from either their initially-preferred <b>coalition</b> <b>partner</b> or from both their preferred and not-preferred <b>coalition</b> <b>partner.</b> Results showed that this manipulation {{had an impact on}} the cardiovascular (CV) response of participants and their subsequent behavior. In the “preferred player angry” condition participants displayed a CV-pattern indicative of challenge while in the “all player angry” condition participants displayed a CV-pattern indicative of threat. Moreover, compared to threatened participants, challenged participants were more likely to switch <b>coalition</b> <b>partner.</b> We discuss the implications of these results for theorizing on emotions, coalition formation, and the BPSM. Highlights ► We examine cardiovascular indices of challenge/threat during coalition formation. ► Anger by a <b>coalition</b> <b>partner</b> led to challenge and switching <b>coalition</b> <b>partner.</b> ► We discuss the implications for anger expression during coalition formation. ► We discuss the integration of psychophysiology and economic psychology.

25|$|Though his old <b>coalition</b> <b>partners</b> VVD and D66 fared {{badly in}} the {{parliamentary}} elections of 2006, Balkenende managed {{to defend the}} dominant position of his CDA. Needing alternative <b>coalition</b> <b>partners</b> {{to form a new}} majority government, he formed a social-Christian coalition with the Dutch Labour Party (PVDA) and the orthodox-Protestant ChristianUnion. This Fourth Balkenende cabinet is a coalition cabinet of the Netherlands, formed by Balkenende, who was appointed formateur by Queen Beatrix on 9 February 2007. His cabinet was announced on 13 February and was scheduled to be in office until 2011, but it fell in the early morning of 20 February 2010 as the result of disagreement between the majority of the parliament and the <b>coalition</b> <b>partners</b> CDA and PvdA over the extension of the Dutch ISAF-mission in Afghanistan. In contrast to the formation of a new caretaker cabinet with full responsibility (Balkenende III after the fall of Balkenende II), Balkenende IV continued as a demissionary cabinet, a caretaker cabinet with limited responsibility.|$|E
