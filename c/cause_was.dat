5|$|After {{retiring}} from the IAEA, Smyth remained active. On the 40th anniversary of the Trinity test in 1985, he denounced President Ronald Reagan's Strategic Defense Initiative and called for joint arms reductions between the United States and the Soviet Union. He died September 11, 1986, in Princeton. The <b>cause</b> <b>was</b> cardiac arrest, though he had long battled cancer.|$|E
5|$|Cadron-Jetté died in 1864. After her death, Ignace Bourget, {{with whom}} she had worked closely {{throughout}} her life, proposed that Cadron-Jetté be considered for canonization by the Roman Catholic Church. Over a century later, in 1989, the proposal was put into effect and her canonization <b>cause</b> <b>was</b> opened.|$|E
5|$|Combat trials {{began in}} mid-September 1944 and were {{generally}} very positive. However four aircraft were lost to engine failures and the engines suffered from numerous lesser problems, despite its satisfactory {{service in the}} La-5FN. One <b>cause</b> <b>was</b> the lower position of the engine air intakes in the wing roots of the La-7 which caused the engine to ingest sand and dust. One batch of flawed wings was built and caused six accidents, four of them fatal, in October which caused the fighter to be grounded until the <b>cause</b> <b>was</b> determined to be a defect in the wing spar.|$|E

5000|$|The causative {{morpheme}} {{can also}} be used recursively to generate indefinitely long words that are grammatically valid. This morpheme shows quite some irregularity, taking one of six forms depending on the verb root. Otherwise it alternates between -DIr (D=d or t, I=ı,i,u or ü) and -t depending on the preceding letter. piş-ir-di-ler = they cooked it piş-ir-t-ti-ler = they <b>caused</b> it to <b>be</b> cooked (they had it cooked) [...] piş-ir-t-tir-di-ler = they <b>caused</b> it to <b>be</b> <b>caused</b> to <b>be</b> cooked (they had someone have it cooked) piş-ir-t-tir-t-ti-ler = they <b>caused</b> it to <b>be</b> <b>caused</b> to <b>be</b> <b>caused</b> to <b>be</b> cooked (they had someone have someone have it cooked) piş-ir-t-tir-t-tir-di-ler = they <b>caused</b> it to <b>be</b> <b>caused</b> to <b>be</b> <b>caused</b> to <b>be</b> <b>caused</b> to <b>be</b> cooked (they had someone have someone have someone have it cooked)Multiple usage of this suffix is rare, but there is no theoretical reason to put a limit to its use.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Cause</b> <b>is</b> scientifically used {{to denote}} an {{antecedent}} {{stage in a}} routine of perceptions. In this sense, [...] "force" [...] as a <b>cause</b> <b>is</b> meaningless.

5|$|On 28 March 1913, a train {{leaving for}} High Wycombe {{collided}} with another arriving from Leicester, killing one passenger and injuring 23 {{people on the}} incoming train.

5|$|At 10:52am on 26 March 1907, {{an express}} {{passenger}} train travelling from Heworth signal box derailed on {{the approach to}} Felling station.

50|$|The {{origins of}} our {{ideas of the}} {{beautiful}} and the sublime, for Burke, can be understood by means of their causal structures. According to Aristotelian physics and metaphysics, causation {{can be divided into}} formal, material, efficient and final causes. The formal <b>cause</b> of beauty <b>is</b> the passion of love; the material cause concerns aspects of certain objects such as smallness, smoothness, delicacy, etc.; the efficient <b>cause</b> <b>is</b> the calming of our nerves; the final <b>cause</b> <b>is</b> God's providence. What is most peculiar and original to Burke's view of beauty is that it cannot be understood by the traditional bases of beauty: proportion, fitness, or perfection. The sublime also has a causal structure that is unlike that of beauty. Its formal <b>cause</b> <b>is</b> thus the passion of fear (especially the fear of death); the material <b>cause</b> <b>is</b> equally aspects of certain objects such as vastness, infinity, magnificence, etc.; its efficient <b>cause</b> <b>is</b> the tension of our nerves; the final <b>cause</b> <b>is</b> God having created and battled Satan, as expressed in John Milton's great epic Paradise Lost.|$|R

5|$|Immediately {{after the}} election, the Referendum Party renamed itself the Referendum Movement. Goldsmith had been {{suffering}} from pancreatic cancer, and had been warned that competing the election would shorten his life. Goldsmith died in Benahavis, Spain on 18 July 1997, and the party disbanded shortly after. Some of its members transformed into the Democracy Movement, a pressure group {{closely associated with the}} former Conservative supporter and multi-millionaire businessman Paul Sykes. The Eurosceptic <b>cause</b> <b>was</b> weakened, however; with Blair's firmly pro-EU government in power, by 1998 the possibility of a referendum on the UK's membership of the EU was considered as distant as it had been in 1995.|$|E
5|$|In 1745 the Jacobite rising {{known as}} The 'Forty-Five began. Charles Edward Stuart, {{son of the}} Old Pretender, often {{referred}} to as Bonnie Prince Charlie or the Young Pretender, landed on the island of Eriskay in the Outer Hebrides. Several clans unenthusiastically joined him. At the outset he was successful, taking Edinburgh and then defeating the only government army in Scotland at the Battle of Prestonpans. The Jacobite army marched into England, took Carlisle and advanced as far as south as Derby. However, it became increasingly evident that England would not support a Roman Catholic Stuart monarch. The Jacobite leadership had a crisis of confidence and they retreated to Scotland as two English armies closed in and Hanoverian troops began to return from the continent. Charles' position in Scotland began to deteriorate as the Whig supporters rallied and regained control of Edinburgh. After an unsuccessful attempt on Stirling, he retreated north towards Inverness. He was pursued by the Duke of Cumberland and gave battle with an exhausted army at Culloden on 16 April 1746, where the Jacobite <b>cause</b> <b>was</b> crushed. Charles hid in Scotland with the aid of Highlanders until September 1746, when he escaped back to France. There were bloody reprisals against his supporters and foreign powers abandoned the Jacobite cause, with the court in exile forced to leave France. The Old Pretender died in 1760 and the Young Pretender, without legitimate issue, in 1788. When his brother, Henry, Cardinal of York, died in 1807, the Jacobite <b>cause</b> <b>was</b> at an end.|$|E
5|$|In 1953, Robert S. Dietz and {{his colleagues}} first {{identified}} the swell behavior. It was suggested that the <b>cause</b> <b>was</b> mantle upwelling. Later work pointed to tectonic uplift, caused by reheating within the lower lithosphere. However, normal seismic activity beneath the swell, as well as lack of detected heat flow, caused scientists to suggest dynamic topography as the cause, in which {{the motion of the}} hot and buoyant mantle plume supports the high surface topography around the islands. Understanding the Hawaiian swell has important implications for hotspot study, island formation, and inner Earth.|$|E
50|$|Acute RBD, occurs {{mostly as}} a result of a side-effect in {{prescribed}} medication—usually antidepressants. But if not then 55% of the time the <b>cause</b> <b>is</b> unknown the other 45% the <b>cause</b> <b>is</b> associated with alcohol.|$|R
5000|$|One logical way {{to trace}} down root <b>causes</b> <b>is</b> by {{utilizing}} hierarchical clustering data-mining solutions (such as graph-theory-based data mining).

5|$|In {{a survey}} {{conducted}} by The Kennel Club, {{the primary cause of}} death for Fox Terriers was old age, causing 31.8% of reported deaths. The secondary <b>cause</b> <b>was</b> cancer of an unspecified type, which accounted for 22.7% of reports. The average lifespan of a Fox Terrier is around 15 years; however, the Kennel Club survey reported a median age at death of 13 years and 2 months.|$|E
5|$|In {{an earlier}} {{disaster}} in May 1901, three underground explosions at the colliery killed 81 miners. The inquest {{established that the}} colliery had high levels of airborne coal dust, which would have exacerbated the explosion and carried it further into the mine workings. The cause of the 1913 explosion is unknown, but the subsequent inquiry thought the most likely <b>cause</b> <b>was</b> a spark from underground signalling equipment that could have ignited any firedamp present. The miners in {{the east side of}} the workings were evacuated, but the men in the western section bore the brunt of the explosion, fire and afterdamp—a poisonous mixture of carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide and nitrogen left after an explosion.|$|E
5|$|In early 1643, Parliament placed Newark under siege, and the {{garrison}} at Ashby {{was sent to}} relieve it. As {{part of a larger}} force under Prince Rupert, they forced the surrender of the Parliamentary force. By late 1644, the war turned against the King, and the Parliamentary forces based at nearby Coleorton had contained {{the garrison}} in the castle. King Charles passed through the castle in May 1645 on his way to besiege Leicester, but the following month his forces were defeated at the Battle of Naseby; the King briefly stayed at the castle once again as he retreated west. By now, the Royalist <b>cause</b> <b>was</b> largely lost.|$|E

5|$|In the 1980s the {{dovecote}} was inspected {{as part of}} {{an investigation}} into an outbreak of psittacosis (also known as parrot disease or parrot fever), a zoonotic infectious disease caused by the bacterium Chlamydophila psittaci, at the adjoining King's School. No <b>cause</b> <b>was</b> found for the infection. In 2010 restoration work was undertaken including repairs to the tops of the walls; these are exposed as the building no longer has a roof. Wall ties were used on the south west corner where the masonry was bulging. In addition, car parking and educational signage was provided. This was partially funded by South Somerset council, Bruton Town Council and the Heritage Lottery Fund to a total of £105,000.|$|E
5|$|Lord Herbert {{left the}} castle {{to join the}} {{campaign}} against Parliament, returning at intervals to acquire more funds for the war. Charles I himself visited the castle twice, first in June 1645 after the battle of Naseby and again in 1646, when he enjoyed playing bowls on the castle's green. The Royalist <b>cause</b> <b>was</b> now close to military collapse, and the Marquess started to send some valuables, including the oak panelling from the parlour, some plaster ceiling and many pictures, to his brother at nearby Troy House for safe-keeping. Lord Herbert was captured in Ireland, and an attack on Raglan itself appeared imminent.|$|E
5|$|Loring {{also had}} its share of {{incidents}} that did not result in fatalities over the years. On 6 March 1955, a B-36 Peacemaker crashed and burned in a snowbank at Loring. All crewmembers were able to escape unharmed. On 26 June 1958, a B-52D (55‑0102) burned on the ground at Loring and was destroyed. On 25 May 1969, a KC-135A (56–3602) broke in two after aborting takeoff. The <b>cause</b> <b>was</b> a frozen water injection surge tube. On 19 July 1970, a B-52G (58‑0208) also caught on fire and was destroyed on the ground.|$|E
