500|$|Architectural experts {{sometimes}} {{differ in}} their interpretations of Kahn's design. [...] Why, for example, are the cross beams at the clerestory windows above the atrium so massive? Carter Wiseman says, [...] "While they appear to be—and indeed are—structural, they are far deeper than necessary; their no-less-important role was to diffuse the sunlight {{coming in from the}} surrounding clerestory windows and reflect it down into the atrium." [...] Sarah Goldhagen thinks there is more to the story, asserting that [...] "the concrete X-shaped cross below the skylit ceiling at the Exeter Library is grossly exaggerated for dramatic effect." [...] Kathleen James-Chakraborty goes even further: [...] "Above, in the most sublime gesture of all, floats a concrete <b>cross</b> <b>brace,</b> illuminated by clerestory windows. [...] Its weight, which appears ready to come crashing down upon the onlooker, revives the sense of threat dissipated elsewhere by the reassuring familiarity of the brick skin and wood details." [...] Kahn similarly floated a massive concrete structure above the sanctuary of the First Unitarian Church of Rochester, which he designed a few years earlier.|$|E
2500|$|The {{empennage}} of the de Marçay was conventional, with {{a triangular}} tailplane and semi-elliptical elevator mounted {{on top of}} the fuselage. [...] The broad chord fin was also triangular, with a rounded rudder which went down to the keel, operating between the elevators. It had a fixed, tailskid undercarriage with its mainwheels on a single axle which was rubber sprung to a transverse <b>cross</b> <b>brace</b> between two pairs of V-struts from the lower fuselage.|$|E

40|$|Key words: <b>cross</b> <b>bracing,</b> {{hysteretic}} curve, fracture ductility, performance-based design. Abstract. Steel braces {{are widely}} used in seismic retrofit of buildings. However, their tendency of buckling under compression impairs their efficacy. In this paper, characteristics of a <b>cross</b> <b>bracing</b> with rigid intersection, including its bearing capacity, hysteretic property and fracture ductility are investigated. With the analysis results, performance-based design requirements of a steel <b>cross</b> <b>bracing</b> are proposed based on its width-thickness ratio and effective slenderness ratio...|$|R
50|$|In construction, <b>cross</b> <b>bracing</b> is {{a system}} {{utilized}} to reinforce building structures in which diagonal supports intersect. <b>Cross</b> <b>bracing</b> can increase a building’s capability to withstand seismic activity. Bracing is important in earthquake resistant buildings because it helps keep a structure standing. <b>Cross</b> <b>bracing</b> is usually seen with two diagonal supports placed in an X shaped manner; these support compression and tension forces. Depending on the forces, one brace may be in tension while the other is slack. It helps make buildings sturdier {{and more likely to}} withstand lateral forces. <b>Cross</b> <b>bracing</b> can be applied to any rectangular frame structure, such as chairs and bookshelves. In steel construction, steel cables may be used due to their great resistance to tension (although not resistant at all to compression). The common uses for <b>cross</b> <b>bracing</b> includes bridge (side) supports, along with structural foundations. This method of construction maximizes the weight of the load a structure is able to support.|$|R
50|$|The headframe, {{straddling}} the mine shaft entrance, {{is a tall}} hardwood structure consisting of four inwardly-slanting legs connected at their apex by timber beams which once supported a pulley servicing {{one of the two}} compartments in the shaft. The structure has <b>cross</b> <b>bracing</b> to each side at the top, with some remains of <b>cross</b> <b>bracing</b> at mid level.|$|R
5000|$|Another way {{in which}} {{stretcher}} bars can be strengthened is by having a <b>cross</b> <b>brace</b> inserted. It is advised that lengths over 40" [...] or 1m be fitted with a <b>cross</b> <b>brace.</b> By doing this it ensures the wood will not warp and will hang flat.|$|E

30|$|So far, most {{research}} has been done on <b>cross</b> <b>bracing</b> systems; while little attention has been given to other bracing arrangements and evaluating their seismic behavior. Despite experiments and studies on <b>cross</b> <b>bracing</b> systems, there exist uncertainties about the exact nonlinear behavior of these systems. To shed light on this significant issue, using modeling, analysis by finite element method, and considering various ratios of height to length of the wall and evaluating nonlinear responses of these systems, we decided to investigate several bracing systems with different arrangements including cross, chevron and K-shape bracings.|$|R

50|$|A <b>Cross</b> <b>brace</b> is the {{cross-beam}} connecting between arches that {{is meant}} to add rigidity {{to the construction of}} mining tunnels. It is often tubular, having a diameter (generally made of lengths of pipes), and modified on the ends with clips or apertures for screw fastening; it serves as a stiffening element for the stability of a design. This brace could also be an ordinary cross-section wooden cross-beam, or even a board.|$|E

50|$|Some {{blocking}} is used structurally like <b>cross</b> <b>bracing</b> between joists in a subfloor {{to prevent}} buckling and stiffen the floor. This use is also called block bridging, solid bridging, and solid strutting.|$|R
50|$|A recent {{addition}} to the church are the steel tie rods to the south {{eastern side of the}} building. These rods are integrated into the existing timber tie beams of the building and were installed to stabilise the structural failings of the structure. The tie rods are anchored back to substantial concrete footings which are raised above ground level. A timber <b>cross</b> <b>brace</b> has also been installed on the rear north east wall to further stabilise the structure.|$|E
5000|$|Removable roof panels (t-tops or targa roofs) open {{a vehicle}} roof {{to the side}} windows, {{providing}} a wider opening than other roof systems. T-roofs have two removable panels and leave a T-shaped structural brace in the roof center. Targa roofs include only one (opaque or transparent) panel and leave no <b>cross</b> <b>brace.</b> Aftermarket kits are no longer made, but several companies sell replacement and remanufactured panels, parts and accessories. Examples include Toyota Supra, Pontiac Firebird, Chevrolet Corvette, Honda NSX, and Porsche 914.|$|E
50|$|The 360 was {{designed}} with a Spider variant in mind; since removing {{the roof of}} a coupe reduces the torsional rigidity, the 360 was built for strength in other areas. Ferrari designers strengthened the sills, stiffened the front of the floorpan and redesigned the windscreen frame. The rear bulkhead had to be stiffened to cut out engine noise from the cabin. The convertible's necessary dynamic rigidity is provided by additional side reinforcements and a <b>cross</b> <b>brace</b> in front of the engine. Passenger safety is ensured by a strengthened windscreen frame and roll bars.|$|E
