Anti-Parkinson's medications are typically less effective at controlling symptoms in Parkinson plus syndromes.

5|$|The {{first-line}} {{psychiatric treatment}} for schizophrenia is antipsychotic medication, which {{can reduce the}} positive symptoms of psychosis in about 7 to 14 days. Antipsychotics, however, fail to significantly improve the negative symptoms and <b>cognitive</b> <b>dysfunction.</b> In those on antipsychotics, continued use decreases the risk of relapse. There is little evidence regarding effects from their use beyond two or three years. However use of anti-psychotics can lead to dopamine hypersensitivity increasing the risk of symptoms if antipsychotics are stopped.|$|E
40|$|Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a {{debilitating}} neurodegenerative disorder which progresses from initial motor impairments to development of <b>cognitive</b> <b>dysfunctions</b> and dementia {{in advanced stages}} of the disease. Pathological hallmarks of PD include selective loss of dopaminergic neurons in the nigrostriatal pathway {{and the development of}} Lewy body inclusions. The pathological events leading to the <b>cognitive</b> <b>dysfunctions</b> appear to be different from those related to motor deficits of PD, but the exact mechanisms are not clear. Studies on postmortem brain samples of PD patients have shown marked axonal pathology and tau pathology in neocortex and hippocampus associated with <b>cognitive</b> <b>dysfunctions.</b> Tau is a microtubule associated protein which, in its non-phosphorylated form, binds to and stabilizes microtubules. Under pathological conditions, tau is hyperphosphorylated and form self-aggregates. However, to study tau pathology in the context of <b>cognitive</b> <b>dysfunctions</b> of PD, a suitable in vivo model is required. Currently, there is no specific in vivo model to mimic the <b>cognitive</b> <b>dysfunctions</b> of PD. Therefore, I evaluated the suitability of a classical toxin model of PD, the 6 -hydroxydopamine (6 -OHDA) lesion in rats, for the study of tau pathology in <b>cognitive</b> <b>dysfunctions</b> of PD. Sprague Dawley rats underwent stereotaxic lesion surgery for 6 -OHDA injection into the medial forebrain bundle (MFB). Motor deficit, memory function, tau expression and phosphorylation were evaluated at 3 weeks post-lesion. Results showed that 6 -OHDA lesion was correlated with memory impairment and increased total tau levels in hippocampus, but without increased levels of Ser 396 or Ser 404 phosphorylated tau. On the other hand, increased levels of Ser 396 and Ser 404 phosphorylated tau was found in frontal cortex. There was no increase in activation of JNK, which indicated apoptotic neuron degeneration was not increased in these regions. In conclusion, the 6 -OHDA lesion in MFB successfully mimicked the tau pathology in cortical regions in the brain, but not in the hippocampus. This study showed that the classical 6 -OHDA lesion model of PD could be suitably applied for the study of tau pathology in <b>cognitive</b> <b>dysfunctions</b> of PD. published_or_final_versionAnatomyMasterMaster of Philosoph...|$|R

5|$|The {{ability to}} {{categorize}} {{a case of}} epilepsy into a specific syndrome occurs more often with children since the onset of seizures is commonly early. Less serious examples are benign rolandic epilepsy (2.8 per 100,000), childhood absence epilepsy (0.8 per 100,000) and juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (0.7 per 100,000). Severe syndromes with diffuse brain dysfunction caused, at least partly, by some aspect of epilepsy, are {{also referred to as}} epileptic encephalopathies. These are associated with frequent seizures that are resistant to treatment and severe <b>cognitive</b> <b>dysfunction,</b> for instance Lennox–Gastaut syndrome and West syndrome. Genetics is believed {{to play an important role}} in epilepsies by a number of mechanisms. Simple and complex modes of inheritance have been identified for some of them. However, extensive screening have failed to identify many single gene variants of large effect. More recent exome and genome sequencing studies have begun to reveal a number of de novo gene mutations that are responsible for some epileptic encephalopathies, including CHD2 and SYNGAP1 and DNM1, GABBR2, FASN and RYR3.|$|E
5|$|Deficits in {{cognitive}} abilities are {{widely recognized as}} a core feature of schizophrenia. The extent of the cognitive deficits an individual experiences is a predictor of how functional an individual will be, the quality of occupational performance, and how successful the individual will be in maintaining treatment. The presence and degree of <b>cognitive</b> <b>dysfunction</b> in individuals with schizophrenia {{has been reported to}} be a better indicator of functionality than the presentation of positive or negative symptoms. The deficits impacting the cognitive function are found in a large number of areas: working memory, long-term memory, verbal declarative memory, semantic processing, episodic memory, attention, learning (particularly verbal learning). Deficits in verbal memory are the most pronounced in individuals with schizophrenia, and are not accounted for by deficit in attention. Verbal memory impairment has been linked to a decreased ability in individuals with schizophrenia to semantically encode (process information relating to meaning), which is cited as a cause for another known deficit in long-term memory. When given a list of words, healthy individuals remember positive words more frequently (known as the Pollyanna principle); however, individuals with schizophrenia tend to remember all words equally regardless of their connotations, suggesting that the experience of anhedonia impairs the semantic encoding of the words. These deficits have been found in individuals before the onset of the illness to some extent. First-degree family members of individuals with schizophrenia and other high-risk individuals also show a degree of deficit {{in cognitive}} abilities, and specifically in working memory.A review of the literature on cognitive deficits in individuals with schizophrenia shows that the deficits may be present in early adolescence, or as early as childhood. The deficits which an individual with schizophrenia presents tend to remain the same over time in most patients, or follow an identifiable course based upon environmental variables.|$|E

40|$|Objective: To assess sub-clinical <b>cognitive</b> <b>dysfunctions</b> {{in stable}} chronic obstructive {{pulmonary}} disease (COPD) patients having no hypoxemia vs. age-matched healthy volunteers using (i) an electrophysiological test: Auditory event related potential, P 300 test and (ii) a questionnaire tool: Mini-mental state examination (MMSE) questionnaire. Materials and Methods: Eighty male subjects were included: 40 stable COPD patients (smoking history > 20 pack years) and 40 healthy volunteers (HVs). Age, duration of illness, smoking pack years, and spirometric indices were assessed. MMSE scores were evaluated in these groups. Latency of P 300 wave and amplitude of P 300 wave were studied {{in both groups}} to detect P 300 abnormalities in COPD group. Correlations of P 300 abnormalities with patient characteristic parameters and MMSE scores were assessed. In addition, individual COPD patients having significant <b>cognitive</b> <b>dysfunctions</b> beyond cut-off value of 99 th percentile of HVs were analyzed. Results: We observed significantly prolonged P 300 latency (P 0. 05 for all). Conclusions: Our study explores <b>cognitive</b> <b>dysfunctions</b> in stable COPD patients with no hypoxemia. This study highlights the relative importance of using MMSE and P 300. <b>Cognitive</b> <b>dysfunctions</b> were detected both by MMSE and P 300; however, MMSE abnormalities were more frequent compared to P 300 abnormalities (27 / 40 vs. 10 / 40) in COPD patients...|$|R
40|$|The {{disability}} and burden associated with major depression comes only {{in part from}} its affective symptoms; <b>cognitive</b> <b>dysfunctions</b> associated with depression also play a crucial role.

40|$|The {{present study}} {{examined}} language production skills in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients. A unique cued sentence generation task {{was created in}} order to reduce demands on memory and attention. Differences in sentence production abilities according to disease severity and cognitive impairments were assessed. Language samples were obtained from 20 PD patients and 20 healthy control participants matched for age, sex and educational level. In addition, a cognitive test for verbal memory and resistance to cognitive interference was administered. Statistical comparisons revealed significant language changes in an advanced stage of the disease. Advanced PD patients showed a reduction in lexical diversity in notional verbs, which was absent in nouns. <b>Cognitive</b> <b>dysfunctions</b> such as impaired verbal memory are suggested to contribute to the typical noun/verb dissociation in PD patients. In addition, advanced PD patients produced more semantic perseverations, which may be related to set-switching problems. In conclusion, whether language disturbances in PD are the result of non-linguistic <b>cognitive</b> <b>dysfunctions</b> or reflect pure language deficits exacerbated by cognitive impairments, remains a matter of debate.

The cognitive measures of 17 young (31 - 58 years) and 18 old (63 - 84 years) caregivers and of 17 young (37 - 57 years) and 18 old (62 - 84 years) non-caregiver controls were evaluated together with their salivary cortisol and dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) levels, as measured by radioimmunoassays and ELISA assays of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in serum. Although younger caregivers had milder impairments in memory and executive functions than older caregivers, their performances fell to the same or lower levels as those of the healthy older controls. Decreases in DHEA and BDNF levels were correlated with the <b>cognitive</b> <b>dysfunctions</b> observed in the older and younger caregivers, respectively. Cortisol at 10 PM increased in both caregiver groups. Younger caregivers were prone to cognitive impairments similar to older caregivers, although the degree and the neuropsychological correlates of the <b>cognitive</b> <b>dysfunctions</b> were somewhat different between the two groups.

25|$|Parkinson's disease (PD), {{also known}} as Parkinson disease, is a {{degenerative}} disorder of {{the central nervous system}} that often impairs the sufferer's motor skills and speech. Parkinson's disease belongs to a group of conditions called movement disorders. It is characterized by muscle rigidity, tremor, a slowing of physical movement (bradykinesia), and in extreme cases, a loss of physical movement (akinesia). The primary symptoms are the results of decreased stimulation of the motor cortex by the basal ganglia, normally caused by the insufficient formation and action of dopamine, which is produced in the dopaminergic neurons of the brain. Secondary symptoms may include high level <b>cognitive</b> <b>dysfunction</b> and subtle language problems. PD is both chronic and progressive.|$|E
25|$|Memory {{capabilities}} decline with age, {{evident in}} human degenerative {{diseases such as}} Alzheimer's disease, which is accompanied by an accumulation of oxidative damage. Current studies demonstrate that the accumulation of ROS can decrease an organism's fitness because oxidative damage is a contributor to senescence. In particular, the accumulation of oxidative damage may lead to <b>cognitive</b> <b>dysfunction,</b> as demonstrated in a study in which old rats were given mitochondrial metabolites and then given cognitive tests. Results showed that the rats performed better after receiving the metabolites, suggesting that the metabolites reduced oxidative damage and improved mitochondrial function. Accumulating oxidative damage can then affect the efficiency of mitochondria and further increase the rate of ROS production. The accumulation of oxidative damage {{and its implications for}} aging depends on the particular tissue type where the damage is occurring. Additional experimental results suggest that oxidative damage is responsible for age-related decline in brain functioning. Older gerbils were found to have higher levels of oxidized protein in comparison to younger gerbils. Treatment of old and young mice with a spin trapping compound caused a decrease in the level of oxidized proteins in older gerbils but did not have an effect on younger gerbils. In addition, older gerbils performed cognitive tasks better during treatment but ceased functional capacity when treatment was discontinued, causing oxidized protein levels to increase. This led researchers to conclude that oxidation of cellular proteins is potentially important for brain function.|$|E
500|$|Particular {{attention}} has been paid to the function of dopamine in the mesolimbic pathway of the brain. This focus largely resulted from the accidental finding that phenothiazine drugs, which block dopamine function, could reduce psychotic symptoms. It is also supported by the fact that amphetamines, which trigger the release of dopamine, may exacerbate the psychotic symptoms in schizophrenia. The influential dopamine hypothesis of schizophrenia proposed that excessive activation of D2 receptors was the cause of (the positive symptoms of) schizophrenia. Although postulated for about 20years based on the D2 blockade effect common to all antipsychotics, it was not until the mid-1990s that PET and SPET imaging studies provided supporting evidence. While dopamine D2/D3 receptors are elevated in schizophrenia, the effect size is small, and only evident in medication naive schizophrenics. On the other hand, presynaptic dopamine metabolism and released is elevated despite no difference in dopamine transporter. The altered synthesis of dopamine in the nigrostriatal system have been confirmed in several human studies. Hypoactivity of dopamine D1 receptor activation in the prefrontal cortex has also been observed. [...] The hyperactivity of D2 receptor stimulation and relative hypoactivity of D1 receptor stimulation is thought to contribute to <b>cognitive</b> <b>dysfunction</b> by disrupting signal to noise ratio in cortical microcircuits. [...] The dopamine hypothesis is now thought to be simplistic, partly because newer antipsychotic medication (atypical antipsychotic medication) can be just as effective as older medication (typical antipsychotic medication), but also affects serotonin function and may have slightly less of a dopamine blocking effect.|$|E
