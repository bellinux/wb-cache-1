50|$|Beek {{had his own}} {{art studio}} and {{accepted}} an assignment in 1949 to illustrate a new story of children's author Enid Blyton: Noddy. This first appeared as a strip in an English newspaper, but proved so successful that soon after the first book was published: Noddy Goes to Toyland. Due to the nimble writing pace of Enid Blyton, Beek employed an assistant, Wienk, in 1950. Initially for colouring the drawings made by Beek, later Wienk drew the Noddy characters himself as well.Beek died in 1953, after which Wienk, Marten Toonder {{and a few other}} illustrators had rivaled to obtain the <b>continuing</b> <b>contract</b> for the Noddy books. Although Toonder was a famous and established Dutch illustrator, Enid Blyton found Wienk's drawings better suited to her wishes for the Noddy character. Between 1953 and 1970 Wienk has illustrated a large number of Noddy books, as well as Noddy Big Books. Enid Blyton dies in 1968 and in 1970 the work on the Noddy books ends for Wienk.|$|E

40|$|Theoretically, most of {{the economists}} show that the land prices should be equal to {{the sum of the}} {{discounted}} future rents. However, the real land prices are more volatile than such fundamental values and it is generally believed that non-rationality causes the excess volatilities. In this paper, I propose the new economic model of the land prices, which can explain the great fluctuations of the land prices, such as the 2 ̆ 2 Bubble 2 ̆ 2 phenomenon in Japan. The model is characterized by discriminating between the new and <b>continued</b> <b>contracted</b> rents, and supposing that the <b>continued</b> <b>contracted</b> rents is rigid. In this setting, the market prices of land can differ from fundamental values without non-rationality, and {{it is important that the}} determinants of the gap is the bargaining power of the players. On the basis of this theory, it is quite likely that the 2 ̆ 2 Bubble 2 ̆ 2 phenomenon in Japan may not be bubble. 小松憲治先生退官記念号Collected Papers on the Occasion of the Retirement of Professor Kenji Komats...|$|R

40|$|Parties often {{regulate}} {{their relationships}} through “continuing” contracts that are neither long-term nor short-term but usually roll over: a leading {{example is a}} standard employment contract. We argue that what distinguishes a <b>continuing</b> <b>contract</b> from a short-term (or fixed-term) contract is that parties apply notions of fairness, fair dealing, and good faith as they revise {{the terms of the}} contract: specifically, they use the previous contract as a reference point. We show that a <b>continuing</b> <b>contract</b> can reduce (re) negotiation costs relative to a short-term or long-term contract when there is uncertainty about future gains from trade. However, fair dealing may limit the use of outside options in bargaining and as a result parties will sometimes fail to trade when this is efficient. For-cause contracts, where termination can occur only for a good reason, can reduce this inefficiency.

40|$|Parties often {{regulate}} {{their relationships}} through “continuing ” contracts that are neither long-term nor short-term but usually roll over. We study the trade-off between long-term, short-term, and continuing contracts in a two period model where gains from trade {{exist in the}} first period, and {{may or may not}} exist in the second period. A long-term contract that mandates trade in both periods is disadvantageous since renegotiation is required if there are no gains from trade in the second period. A short-term contract is disadvantageous since a new contract must be negotiated if gains from trade exist in the second period. A <b>continuing</b> <b>contract</b> can be better. In a <b>continuing</b> <b>contract</b> there is no obligation to trade in the second period but if there are gains from trade the parties will bargain “fairly ” using the first period contract as a reference point. This can reduce the cost of negotiating the next contract. Continuing contracts are not a panacea, however, since fair bargaining may limit the use of outside options in the bargaining process an...|$|E
