50|$|The Ledra Palace Hotel {{is located}} in central Nicosia, Cyprus, and until 1974 {{was one of the}} largest and most glamorous hotels of the capital. The hotel was {{designed}} by the German Jewish architect Benjamin Günsberg and was built between 1947-1949 by Cyprus Hotels Limited at a cost of approx £240,000 <b>Cyprus</b> <b>pounds</b> on what was then called King Edward VII Street, since 1962 Markos Drakos Avenue.The hotel opened on the 8th October 1949 in the presence of British Governor Sir Andrew Wright and Vice Mayor of Nicosia George Poulios. It originally had 94 bedrooms and 150 beds, officially rated as de luxe. All rooms had hot and cold water, central heating and a telephone. Facilities included a conference, reading, bridge and ballroom with orchestra. There were two restaurants, two bars and café. Located within the garden was a swimming pool (which was installed in 1964), paddling pool, children's playground and tennis courts. The hotel had two additional floors added in 1967-1968, thus raising its capacity to 200 rooms and 320 beds.|$|R
50|$|Initially the <b>Cyprus</b> <b>pound</b> {{was divided}} into 20 {{shilling}}s (σελίνι / σελίνια, şilin), in common with its United Kingdom counterpart. However, unlike the United Kingdom shilling, the Cyprus shilling {{was divided into}} 9 piastres (γρόσι / γρόσια, kuruş), thus establishing a nomenclature link to earlier Ottoman currency. The piastre was itself divided into 40 para (like the kuruş). The para denomination did not appear on any coins or banknotes but was used on postage stamps. However, the -piastre coin was equal to 10 para (παράδες) and called δεκάρα in Greek and the -piastre coin was equal to 20 para and called εικοσάρα.|$|E
5000|$|In 1955, a {{decision}} was made by the British colonial authorities to decimalise the <b>Cyprus</b> <b>pound,</b> and in this they used the system proposed by William Brown, a member of the United Kingdom parliament, who suggested in 1855 that the pound sterling in the United Kingdom should be divided into one-thousand parts, each called a mil. [...] Although this system was never adopted in the United Kingdom, it was used in several British colonies, including Hong Kong from 1863 to 1866; and the British Palestine Mandate from 1926 until 1948. The Palestinian example may in fact have been the impetus to use a pound-mil system in Cyprus as the Palestinian pound was for a brief period accepted as legal tender in Cyprus.|$|E

40|$|This work {{is based}} on the Cyprus Survey of Consumer Finances (CySCF) and focuses on one hand on the {{composition}} of household assets in Cyprus based on the 2002 Cyprus Survey of Consumer Finances (CySCF 2002) and on the other on the distributional changes between the 1999 and the 2002 CySCFs. From 1999 to 2002 there has been a radical increase of household participation in direct stockholding. This {{is due to the fact}} that there was a boom of the stock market with a remarkable increase of 688 % during 1999, which, however, deflated dramatically during 2000 by 65 %. In the same period a 50 % increase in the share of households with loans backed by real estate other than their primary residences was observed. Furthermore, real estate prices rose sharply in most areas and affected to a great extent the net wealth so that a more than 7. 5 % increase was observed in the mean value of the net wealth from 1999 to 2002. Finally, the work deals with the econometric analysis of debts, and results based on probit models are provided. The variables selected are age, family size, employment status and income. The typical 2002 individual was identified as a 45 -year old self-employed, married person with 3 children with a annual income of 18000 <b>Cyprus</b> <b>pounds</b> (1 CY L = 1. 7 Euros).

50|$|In 1981, the {{organised}} {{portion of}} the supporters of the club, with no official name yet, elected council members and began organising themselves, in a tiny room of the clubhouse (where it now houses {{the offices of the}} football Company) the membership fee was then 10 Cypriot cents. Later on in 1982 after the positive response in enlisting new members of the fan club, the cost of registration was increased to 2 <b>Cyprus</b> <b>pounds.</b> At a time when no other team had yet an organised groups of fans on the island, a new fan club was registered. The registration was triggered after a game in Paphos where the followers of Apollon made an organised excursion something that had not been done previously. On their return, everyone was happy with the experience, that they agreed to set up formally and officially the Sy.Fi Association (Apollon Limassol)-Apollon Limassol Fan club. In 1982 Costas Katafygiotis was elected first president of the Apollon Sy.Fi in September 1982. The next year the fan club worked in an official manner. Chaired by Dino it opened in parallel a souvenir shop on the street and gained its Independence from the football club and became a housing association for the fans. The years went by, the Apollon Sy.Fi renamed itself later to PA.SY.FI Apollon (Apollon Cyprus Association of Supporters) and much later PAN.SY.FI APOLLON (Pan Hellenic Supporters Association of Apollon) to show the bond of our association with Greece.|$|R
5000|$|Unlike {{the pound}} {{sterling}} in the United Kingdom, and the sterling-equivalent Cypriot <b>pound</b> in British-run <b>Cyprus,</b> the Palestine <b>pound</b> was from its introduction a decimal currency, albeit with each pound divided into one thousand parts, called mils.

40|$|This paper investigates {{whether the}} real {{effective}} exchange {{rate of the}} <b>Cyprus</b> <b>pound</b> is misaligned by generating measures of the equilibrium rate using the Behavioral Equilibrium Exchange Rate (BEER) approach. Several measures of the equilibrium exchange rate were derived and used to check for the existence of exchange rate misalignment. The results suggest that, during the 1990 s, the actual {{real effective exchange rate}} and the various equilibrium measures generated move closely together and {{there is no evidence of}} any significant and persistent misalignment. However, the empirical evidence suggests persistent overvaluation during the 1980 s. Equilibrium exchange rates, misalignment, <b>Cyprus</b> <b>pound,...</b>|$|E
40|$|One of the {{landmark}} {{events in the}} recent history of Cyprus was the adoption of the euro on 1 January 2008. A crucial element of the preparatory discussions between the Cypriot authorities and the competent European bodies was the search for an agreement on the conversion rate of the <b>Cyprus</b> <b>pound</b> vis-a-vis the euro, which was decided by the Economic and Financial Affairs Council (ECOFIN) on 10 July 2007. This paper describes part of the work undertaken at the Central Bank of Cyprus as background material for these discussions. Using a qualitative and quantitative approach, the paper suggests that the exchange parity rate of the <b>Cyprus</b> <b>pound</b> vis-a-vis the euro which existed {{for a number of years}} prior to euro adoption was broadly in line with economic fundamentals. Evidence examined include the stability of the <b>Cyprus</b> <b>pound</b> vis-a-vis the euro within a credible exchange rate policy framework, robust growth, low levels of unemployment, high Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) coverage of the current account deficit as well as low and stable inflation. This conclusion is also supported by a model-based approach using the Fundamental Equilibrium Exchange Rate (FEER) framework. Equilibrium exchange rate, euro adoption, FEER...|$|E
40|$|Focusing on {{the recent}} {{experience}} of major and minor currencies, this study examines the effectiveness of constant hedge and speculative hedge respectively {{with the objective of}} identifying whether there are any significant differences between both hedges. Our finding is that the speculative hedge is very slightly more effective than the constant hedge in reducing the currency risk. This supports that the speculative hedge about major currencies can be a relevant hedging tool. The analysis also shows that our multiple currency futures hedge can be a good hedging instrument for some minor currencies such as <b>Cyprus</b> <b>pound.</b> ...|$|E
50|$|On {{only her}} second voyage, Cyprus was hauling iron ore from Superior, Wisconsin to Buffalo, New York when a {{moderate}} gale arose off Deer Park. The gale, according to contemporary accounts, was reported as nothing that Cyprus couldn't have handled. According to Second Mate Charles G. Pitz — the sole survivor — <b>Cyprus</b> had been <b>pounded</b> by northwesterly waves all afternoon which caused an increasing list to port. At around 7:45 p.m. the ship lurched to port and capsized. Pitz and three others, which included Captain F. B. Huyck (according to some accounts) secured {{themselves on a}} raft. By 2:00 a.m. the raft and its occupants were within 300 feet (91 m) of shore when breaking waves flipped the raft, and all but Pitz drowned in the surf. Pitz unwittingly staggered ashore, just a half-mile east of the Deer Park Life-Saving Station. All the bodies but two were eventually recovered.|$|R
