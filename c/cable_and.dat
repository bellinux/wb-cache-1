5|$|In June 2010, the EyeTV HD {{product for}} {{recording}} high-definition <b>cable</b> <b>and</b> satellite programming was introduced. Because <b>cable</b> <b>and</b> satellite signals are encoded, the device must {{be connected to}} a tuner from a television provider. Then it provides remote controls, recording and DVR-functionality from a connected computer. A Macworld review gave the product {{four out of five}} stars. A review in Laptop Magazine gave EyeTV HD 3.5 out of 5 stars. It said the interface was intuitive and the video quality was good, but noted it was only compatible with Macs.|$|E

2500|$|Shortwave {{communications}} {{began to}} grow rapidly in the 1920s, similar to the internet in the late 20th century. By 1928, {{more than half of}} long distance communications had moved from transoceanic <b>cables</b> <b>and</b> long wave wireless services to shortwave [...] "skip" [...] transmission and the overall volume of transoceanic shortwave communications had vastly increased. Shortwave also ended the need for multimillion-dollar investments in new transoceanic telegraph <b>cables</b> <b>and</b> massive long wave wireless stations, although some existing transoceanic telegraph <b>cables</b> <b>and</b> commercial long wave communications stations remained in use until the 1960s.|$|R

As a result, it was possible for the driver to drive his train from a cab located at the front of a designated push-pull coach, leaving the fireman to tend the fire and operate the injectors on the locomotive footplate.|$|E

5|$|Ethernet {{standards}} require {{electrical isolation}} between the networked device (computer, phone, etc.) {{and the network}} cable up to 1500VAC or 2250VDC for 60seconds. USB has no such requirement as it was designed for peripherals closely associated with a host computer, and in fact it connects the peripheral and host grounds. This gives Ethernet a significant safety advantage over USB with peripherals such as <b>cable</b> <b>and</b> DSL modems connected to external wiring that can assume hazardous voltages under certain fault conditions.|$|E
5|$|HDMI 1.3a was {{released}} on November 10, 2006, and had <b>Cable</b> <b>and</b> Sink modifications for type C, source termination recommendations, and removed undershoot and maximum rise/fall time limits.
