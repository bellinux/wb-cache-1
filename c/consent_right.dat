40|$|Text in EnglishOrphans and {{vulnerable}} children are increasingly forming a larger {{portion of the}} South African population. The escalating number of these children in communities is caused mainly {{by the loss of}} parents to HIV/AIDS. This poses a huge challenge for the government and organisations rendering social welfare services to these orphans {{and vulnerable}} children. This qualitative study sought to explore and describe the nature of collaboration between social workers and child and youth workers in rendering services to orphans and vulnerable children in the Free State province. The non-probability sampling technique of purposive sampling guided the data collection process using in-depth one on one semi structured interviews as a data collection method. Finally the data was analysed by means of Creswell’s data analysis spiral followed by the principles of Guba for data verification. The ethical considerations adhered to throughout this study were informed <b>consent,</b> <b>right</b> to privacy, avoidance of deception, debriefing of participants, management of information. The rationale was that overlapping boundaries exist when the two professions work together in addressing the needs of orphans and vulnerable children. The findings of the research confirmed that there are no clear guidelines on the collaboration of social workers and child and youth care workers, although personal efforts are made for a healthy working relationship. Recommendations were made in relation to the findings. Social WorkM. A. (Social Work...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT. Accidental human {{immunodeficiency}} virus (HIV) infection of patients in health care settings raises the question about whether patients {{have a right to}} expect disclosure of HIV/AIDS diagnoses by their health workers. Although such a right- and the correlative duty to disclose- might appear justified by reason of standards of informed consent, I argue that such standards should only apply to questions of risks of and barriers to HIV infection involved in a particular medical treatment, not to disclosure of personal diagnoses. Because the degree of risk of HIV infection is low and disclosure would also have damag-ing consequences for health workers, and because patient protection is available in other ways, it is argued that no such generalized right should be recognized. Key Words: duty to disclose, HIV infection, HIV/AIDS diagnosis, informed <b>consent,</b> <b>right</b> to know Do patients have the right to know whether their health-care pro-viders have an HIV infection or have been diagnosed as having AIDS? The American Medical Association (AMA) asserted a limited right of exactly this kind in 1991, saying that "The health of patients must always be the paramount concern of physicians. " Until the uncertainty about transmission in health care settings is resolved, the AMA held that HIV-infected physicians should either abstain from performing invasive procedures which pose an identifiable risk of transmission or disclose their sero-positive status prior to performing such a procedure and proceed only if there is informed consent (American Medical Association, 1991). While the AMA has since modified this standard, 1 the desirability of such a broad requirement of disclosure given public concern about safety is worth considering. I will argue that patients do not have a gener-alized right to disclosure, not because patients do {{not have the right to}} protect themselves from unwanted risks but because HIV infection in health care does not ordinarily belong to the domai...|$|E
40|$|They defended their Right: {{late medieval}} Peasant Resistance in Scania and Småland. " The {{aim of this}} thesis is to explore in what ways peasants could resist and protest against {{authorities}} during the final decades of the Nordic late middle ages, the years 1490 - 1525. It consists of a comparison between the Danish province of (Scania) Skåne and the Swedish province of Småland. The study is performed in three stages. First I do a survey of what conflicts took place between peasants and the different forms of authorities; the Crown and its officials, the Church, and the landlords. This survey also shed lights on what resources {{were more or less}} systematically disputed during the period. Important questions were for example the costs of the Kalmar union wars, and the peasants rights to armament or protection, but also ? especially in Scania ? rights to woods and other resources, which were very contested during the period. Then follows an analysis of which forms of protest and interaction, and which arenas, the peasants could use in these conflicts. Finally there is a survey over which political arguments, norms and values, the peasants used in their written communications as well as in meetings and in other forms of practice. These arguments are also analyzed in relation to the surrounding political culture of the society in large. The study makes use of several approaches in recent research regarding peasant protests. Important is the research concept of political culture, which is discussed and elaborated in the study, and which supports the aim of the study to show the variety of means of protest, resistance and political action the peasants actually had. We meet forms of action as supplications, local negotiations, legal action, feuds, collective oath-making and uprisings. The analysis also benefits from recent focus on different types of alliances between peasants and lords and other social groups, which often made conflicts multi-levelled and complicated. I stress how the turbulent conditions in the society had the function of reproducing several of the most important norms and values in the political culture. Concepts and social functions which had {{an important role in the}} political culture but which also were disputed and contested, were peace and protection, reciprocity, liberty, law/justice and customary law, public good, reasonable subsistence, harmony/concord and <b>consent,</b> <b>right</b> of resistance...|$|E

40|$|This chapter {{offers a}} feminist reading of Pashukanisâ 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 9 s legal theory as a {{contribution}} to critical evaluation {{of the relationship between}} legality, commodification and gender. Contemporary feminist interests in the relationship between legal and non-legal norms, in the role of commodification, and in the limits of gender as a category of analysis, make a re-engagement with Pashukanis timely. For Pashukanis, legal form constitutes subjects as if they have property rights over objects, generates exchange value, and represents differently situated subjects as if they are equal. Here I develop an account of legal form analysis that recuperates Pashukanisâ 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 9 s distinction between legal form and technical regulation, his theorisation of the subject of commodification, and his historical method of form/content analysis. Drawing on this critical reading of Pashukanis, I argue for the development of legal form analysis so as to accommodate the roles of social reproduction and consumption in the generation of care value and use value in commodity-exchanging societies. I illustrate this method by providing a legal form analysis of a conflict in <b>consent</b> <b>rights</b> over the use of genetically related embryos. Such an analysis asks how <b>consent</b> <b>rights</b> would extract care value from the subjectâ 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 9 s reproductive wishes, recognise contributions {{to the development of the}} embryo, and recognise investments in the future use of that embryo. In this way, legal form analysis provides a reading of legal contributions to the generation of value from human reproductive activities without making assumptions about their gendered content...|$|R

Methods: Twenty-nine <b>consenting</b> <b>right</b> handed healthy male subjects received a baseline fMRI scan while they viewed angry faces. Subsequently, they were randomized to receive oral SRX 246 (120 mg PO twice a day) or placebo. After an average of 7 days of treatment (range 5 - 11 days), they were given an acute dose of intranasal vasopressin (40 I. U) or placebo and underwent a second scan 60 min later. The primary outcome was BOLD activity in the amygdala in response to angry faces. Secondary analyses were focused on ROIs in a brain regions previously linked to vasopressin signaling. Results: In subjects randomized to oral placebo-intranasal vasopressin, there was a significantly diminished amygdala BOLD response from the baseline to post-drug scan compared with oral placebo-intranasal placebo subjects.
