In 1947 he joined the Cleveland Indians during spring training, but he was assigned to the Class A Wilkes-Barre Barons of the Eastern League by Cleveland coach Bill McKechnie. He finished the season with 17 wins and a 3.24ERA. In 1948, he pitched for the Double-A Oklahoma City Indians of the Texas League and earned 19 wins.|$|E
5|$|Supermarkets, {{convenience}} stores, and {{gas stations}} in New Jersey rarely sell alcoholic beverages because state law prohibits any person or corporation from possessing {{more than two}} retail distribution licenses. While licenses for bars, restaurants and liquor stores are limited, other retail licenses are not. <b>Class</b> <b>C</b> licenses can be granted without limit for common carriers (such as limousines and boats), private clubs {{with a minimum of}} 60 members, hotels with at least one-hundred rooms, and theatres with at least 1,000 seats.|$|E
5|$|The {{transport}} of hazardous goods through the crossing {{is governed by}} the European ADR Agreement. The Dartford Crossing is <b>class</b> <b>C,</b> which restricts transporting goods such as nitrates and flammable liquids. The introduction of the ADR scheme initially caused confusion, and for a short time, transporting aerosols through the tunnel was banned. Certain hazardous goods vehicles, together with some oversize and abnormal loads (if permitted) may require escorting by Highways Agency Traffic Officers. The crossing authority must hold exercises {{in conjunction with the}} emergency services. In 2006 Exercise Orpheus was held, involving the closure of both road tunnels for five hours.|$|E

5|$|Although casinos are {{not under}} the {{jurisdiction}} of the ABC, many of the regulations for casinos and casino vendors are similar to those for ABC <b>class</b> <b>C</b> retailer licensees. Casinos may generally only purchase alcoholic beverages from licensed wholesalers (i.e. ABC Class B licensees). A casino may have a brewpub on site, but production is limited to 3,000 barrels of beer per year, and the beer may only be distributed in open containers on casino floor and in hotel areas of the casino. Casinos may obtain a permit to have tastings, and tasting dinners. Non-profit organizations may obtain a permit to have a social event at a casino where they charge for alcoholic beverages. Organizations are limited to 12 casino social event permits per year, and a given casino may only host 25 such events per year.|$|E
5|$|Based on the {{recommendation}} of the EACD, the New Zealand government has passed legislation which placed BZP, along with the other piperazine derivatives TFMPP, mCPP, pFPP, MeOPP and MBZP, into <b>Class</b> <b>C</b> of the New Zealand Misuse of Drugs Act 1975. A ban was intended to come into effect in New Zealand on 18 December 2007, but the law change did not go through until the following year, and the sale of BZP and the other listed piperazines became illegal in New Zealand as of 1 April 2008. An amnesty for possession and usage of these drugs was in effect until October 2008, at which point they became completely illegal.|$|E
5|$|Because it cannot {{compete with}} {{established}} plants, great mullein {{is no longer}} considered a serious agricultural weed and is easily crowded out in cultivation, except in areas where vegetation is sparse to begin with, such as Californian semi-desertic areas of the eastern Sierra Nevada. In such ecological contexts, it crowds out native herbs and grasses; its tendency to appear after forest fires also disturbs the normal ecological succession. Although not an agricultural threat, its presence can {{be very difficult to}} completely eradicate, and is especially problematic in overgrazed pastures. The species is legally listed as a noxious weed in the American state of Colorado (<b>Class</b> <b>C)</b> and Hawaii, and the Australian state of Victoria (regionally prohibited in the West Gippsland region, and regionally controlled in several others).|$|E

5|$|In 1997, the Oregon Legislature passed House Bill 3643, {{making the}} {{possession}} of less than an ounce of marijuana a <b>Class</b> <b>C</b> misdemeanor, which added a possible jail sentence of up to 30 days. According to Eric Schlosser of Rolling Stone, John Kitzhaber, then Oregon's governor, signed the bill {{because he did not}} want to appear soft on crime. Activists opposing HB 3643 collected twice as many signatures as were required to force a referendum on the bill. John Sperling, Peter Lewis, and George Soros were the principal financial backers of the referendum signature drive. Measure 57, which would have upheld HB 3643, was turned down by a margin of 2–1.|$|E
5|$|The {{number of}} <b>Class</b> <b>C</b> retail {{licenses}} for bars, restaurants, and liquor stores {{is limited by}} population and often by municipal ordinances. Licenses are typically obtained from existing licensees who choose to sell, or when a new license is offered as a town's population grows. As a result, the price for a retail license is often prohibitively expensive. The sale of a new license is usually conducted by public auction. The intense competition can benefit a town by generating {{several hundred thousand dollars}} of revenue from the highest bidder. A 2006 license auction in Cherry Hill, New Jersey set the state record at $1.5 million.|$|E

He split the 1950 season with the Wichita Indians of the Class A Western League and the San Antonio Missions of the Class AA Texas League. Turley led Wichita in the Western League playoffs. In 1951, he played for San Antonio. He appeared in the Texas League's All-Star Game, and was named the league's most valuable player {{at the end of the}} season. He struck out 22 batters in one game for San Antonio.|$|E

5|$|The mutineers divided {{themselves}} into three groups. A party of 100 went to obtain ammunition from Tanglin Barracks, where 309 Germans, including crew {{members from the}} German light cruiser SMS Emden, had been interned by the British. The mutineers fired on the camp guards and officers without warning, killing ten British guards, three Johore troops present in the camp and one German internee. Amongst the dead were Second Lieutenant John Love Montgomerie, Rifles; Sergeant G. Wald, (Reserve) Engineers; Corporal D. McGilvray, Rifles; Corporal G.O. Lawson, Cyclist Scouts; Lance Corporal J.G.E. Harper, Rifles; Private B.C. Cameron, Rifles; Private F.S. Drysdale, Rifles; Private A.J.G. Holt, Rifles and Stoker 1st <b>Class</b> <b>C.</b> F. Anscombe, HMS Cadmus. Three British and one German were wounded but survived the attack, as did eight Royal Army Medical Corps personnel in the camp hospital, including one who managed to escape under heavy fire to raise the alarm. The mutineers tried to persuade the Germans to join them, {{but many of the}} latter were shaken by the sudden violence and reluctant to do so. Some German sailors and reservists wanted to join with the mutineers, but the majority adopted a neutral stance, refusing to accept rifles from the Indians. Thirty-five Germans escaped but the rest remained in the barracks.|$|E
5|$|To {{replace the}} aging <b>Class</b> <b>C</b> trains, from 1985 to 1987, ten T4s were {{converted}} to T1300. They were equipped with a pantograph, received a new front and the doors were moved. Six additional T4s were converted in 1989, and given the designation T8. These only had the pantographs equipped and kept the same front and door arrangement. With {{the introduction of the}} T1300, the western lines could remove the conductor and have single-manned trains with the motorman selling tickets. The T1300-units have had better regularity than the older models they replaced. However, because they are designed for a closed system with automatic train protection, the braking systems are not sufficiently dimensioned for when the drivers use line of sight to regulate the speed and distances between trains. The 1300 units were numbered 1301–1349. After the conversions, Oslo Sporveier operated 49 T1300-cars and 146 T1000-cars. The trains were originally painted red with a beige cheatline.|$|E
