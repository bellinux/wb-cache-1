40|$|The {{multiplier}} is {{a fundamental}} analog building block. Analog multipliers are used in many systems such as filters, neural networks, automatic gain control <b>circuits,</b> and phase <b>alignment</b> systems. As with any circuit, analog multipliers are plagued by DC offsets. When considering techniques for removing this offset, the question of continuous regulation versus calibration arises. We can easily implement a calibration method, however, how often one must calibrate becomes an issue. Additionally, calibration typically forces the multiplier to suspend normal operation while the offsets are being measured. In this thesis, a technique for continuously regulating offset in multipliers is studied in isolation. Chopper stabilization, a technique long used in DC amplifiers, is applied to analog multipliers to achieve the lowest offset reported. by Ali Hadiashar. Thesis (S. M.)

40|$|Soft micro {{devices and}} {{stretchable}} electronics have attracted great interest for their potential applications in sensory skins and wearable bio-integrated devices. One {{of the most}} important steps in building printed <b>circuits</b> is the <b>alignment</b> of assembled micro objects. Previously, the capillary self-alignment of microchips driven by surface tension effects {{has been shown to be}} able to achieve high-throughput and high-precision in the integration of micro parts on rigid hydrophilic/superhydrophobic patterned surfaces. In this paper, the self-alignment of microchips on a patterned soft and stretchable substrate, which consists of hydrophilic pads surrounded by a superhydrophobic polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) background, is demonstrated for the first time. A simple process has been developed for making superhydrophobic soft surface by replicating nanostructures of black silicon onto a PDMS surface. Different kinds of PDMS have been investigated, and the parameters for fabricating superhydrophobic PDMS have been optimized. A self-alignment strategy has been proposed that can result in reliable self-alignment on a soft PDMS substrate. Our results show that capillary self-alignment has great potential for building soft printed circuits. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|We present two VLSI (Very Large Scale Integration) designs. The {{first one}} in this thesis is the digital Delay-Locked Loop (DLL) design, and the second one is the {{prefetch}} unit of ARM processor. The improvement of CMOS (Complementary Metal Oxide Silicon) process technology makes the VLSI system operate {{at a very high}} speed in recent years. In high-speed synchronous systems, the clock skews may make the system clock asynchronous among storage elements and thus affect the system operation. As a result, clock <b>alignment</b> <b>circuits</b> are necessary. DLL is a good clock <b>alignment</b> <b>circuit</b> that synchronizes the clocks inside and outside a chip in a synchronous system. It can be implemented in analog or digital circuit. Digital DLLs are preferred over analog ones because they are easy to design and portable over various processes. In this thesis we present an all-digital DLL design that can operate at 400 MHz. There are two advantages of this design. First, it is all-digital, and there are no analog devices in the circuit. Second, its structure is simpler, and thus the final silicon area will be smaller. The prefetch unit is used to predict and fetch instructions before they are actually used so that the idle cycles due to instruction fetch can be reduced. The architecture and implementation of an ARM prefetch unit is presented {{in the second part of}} this thesis. 本論文分為兩個主題：第一部分是數位延遲鎖定迴路的研究與實作，第二部分是ARM微處理器的預先讀取單元之設計。 CMOS半導體製程技術的快速成長使得超大型積體電路之運作時脈頻率快速增加。在高速運作的同步系統中，時脈偏斜所造成時脈不同步的現象嚴重威脅系統運作的正確性。因此，時脈校正電路是必要的。 延遲鎖定迴路是解決同步系統中電路內部時脈與外部時脈不同步的一種時脈校正電路。電路設計方法可採類比式設計也可採數位式設計。數位式延遲鎖定迴路的優點為易於設計，且可移植到不同的製程。本篇論文提出一個全數位式可於時脈頻率為 400 MHz的同步系統下校正時脈的全數位式延遲鎖定迴路。相較於以前提出的延遲鎖定迴路，本方法的優點為：（ 1 ）全數位式電路，無任何類比元件；（ 2 ）結構簡單，故面積較小。 預先讀取單元是用來預先讀取連續的指令以減少微處理機閒置的時間。在本論文中我們詳述了此單元的微架構及實作，其邏輯閘層亦驗證無誤。第一章 簡介……………………………………………………………… [...] … 1 1. 1 研究動機……………………………………………………………… [...] 1 1. 2 內容大綱……………………………………………………………… [...] 2 第二章 背景知識……………………………… [...] …… [...] ………… [...] ……… [...] . 3 2. 1 系統時序……………………………………………………………… [...] 3 2. 2 延遲鎖定迴路之概念………………………………………………… [...] 7 2. 3 文獻中相關之研究…………………………………………………… [...] 8 第三章 系統架構分析…………………………………………… [...] ………. 11 3. 1 延遲路徑……………………………………………………………… 12 3. 1. 1 延遲線元件………………………………………………………. 12 3. 1. 2 相位攪拌器………………………………………………………. 14 3. 1. 3 多工器與時脈樹…………………………………………………. 19 3. 2 相位偵測器…………………………………………………………… 20 3. 3 鎖定控制電路………………………………………………………… 21 第四章 實驗結果分析…………………………………. … [...] ……………. 24 4. 1 延遲路徑之模擬……………………………………………………… 24 4. 1. 1 延遲線元件之模擬………………………………………………. 24 4. 1. 2 相位攪拌器之模擬………………………………………………. 26 4. 1. 3 多工器之模擬……………………………………………………. 28 4. 2 相位偵測器之模擬…………………………………………………… 30 4. 3 鎖定控制電路與整體之模擬………………………………………… 32 第五章 ARM 8 核心處理器之預先讀取單元………………… [...] … [...] … [...] . 40 5. 1 電路微架構描述……………………………………………………… 40 5. 1. 1 預測分支策略……………………………………………………. 40 5. 1. 2 訊號描述…………………………………………………………. 41 5. 2 電路內部描述………………………………………………………… 43 5. 2. 1 電路內部方塊描述………………………………………………. 43 5. 2. 2 Branch FSM & Fetch方塊之描述……………………………. …. 46 5. 2. 3 緩衝區控制電路………………………………………………. … 49 5. 3 實作………………………………………………………………… [...] 51 第六章 結論與未來工作………………………………………………… [...] 52 參考文獻…………………………………………………………………… [...] 5...|$|R
40|$|In {{theoretical}} studies {{supported by}} limited experimental results, it is stated that near-field {{radiative heat transfer}} exceeds blackbody radiation which {{has been defined as}} the limit of far-field radiative heat transfer. Its proof for two parallel plates requires novel experimental approach for precisely controlling nanoscale dimensions. In addition, a computational method is necessary to calculate near-field radiative heat transfer. In this study, the computational method is introduced and verification of the computational method is done by a proposed experimental approach. Near-field radiative heat transfer is compared with that of far-field using one half of a Wheatstone bridge <b>circuit</b> and an <b>alignment</b> procedure for controlling the distance between two parallel plates. To measure temperature effects of the near- and the far-field radiations, micro-sensors are designed and piezoelectric stages allowing sensitive relative positioning of two parallel plates are set up. Voltage read-outs acquired by a lock-in amplifier are converted to its temperature variation equivalent, and the comparison of near-field radiation with far-field radiation is presented for the two plate case. It is shown that near-field radiative heat transfer between two plates measured experimentally at nano-level has a good agreement with the results obtained from computations. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Polyimides {{are one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} classes of polymers used in the microelectronics and photoelec-tronics industries. Because of their high thermal stability, chemical resistance, and good mechanical and electric properties, polyimides are often applied in photoresists, passivation and dielectric films, soft print <b>circuit</b> boards, and <b>alignment</b> films within displays. Recently, fully aliphatic and alicyclic polyimides have found applications as opto-electronics and inter layer dielectric materials, due to their good transparencies and low dielectric constants (ε). The low molecular density, polarity and rare probability of forming inter- or intra-molecular charge transfers, resulting in lowering of the dielectric constant and high transparency, are the most striking characteristics of aliphatic poly-imide. However, the ultimate end use of polyimides derived from aliphatic monomers is in their targeted applications that need less stringent thermal requirements. Much research effort has been exerted in the development of aliphatic polyimide with increased thermal and mechanical stabilities, while maintaining their transparencies and low dielec-tric constants, by the incorporation of rigid moieties. In this article, the recent research process in synthesizing fully aliphatic polyimides, with improved dimensional stability, high transparency and low ε values, as well as the char-acterizations and future scope for their application in micro electric and photo-electronic industries, is reviewed...|$|R
40|$|A significant, if {{not over}} riding, problem with {{electronic}} systems that must transmit data rapidly between IC (Integrated Circuit) packages {{is the issue}} of determining, at the receiver, when to sample the interconnecting wires to record the transmitted data values. Traditionally, the sampling time is established by a “clock ” signal that is distributed to all IC packages. As data transmission rates have increased, the simple “clock ” signal schemes have began to fail as it has become more difficult to assure that the “clock ” signal is received by all IC packages at same time. The “clock skew” problem in high speed systems is well known. This patent describes a high speed data transfer circuit that takes advantage of the structure of ATM and ATM-like data formats in a way that significantly extends the rate that ATM and ATM-like cells can be transmitted, both between and, for large circuits, inside, the IC packages. This scheme is optimized for a local region where it is reasonable to limit the worst case phase shift between the distributed clock and the data within the local region to a few clock periods. This scheme is useful for data flow within an integrated circuit, on a printed circuit board, or in a cabinet full of printed circuit boards. A key element of this scheme is the distribution of a clock RATE, but not a clock PHASE. The received data are aligned with the local clock phase at each receiver site. Other key elements of this scheme include the ability to utilize IC chip logic elements that have a propagation delay variation, over process, temperature, and voltage variations, of on the order of four to one. All logic elements used in the phase <b>alignment</b> <b>circuit</b> are components found in a typica...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{evidence}} suggests that parallel synapses from the same axonal branch onto the same dendritic branch have almost identical strength. It has been proposed that this alignment is only possible through learning rules that integrate activity over long time spans. However, learning mechanisms such as spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) are commonly assumed to be temporally local. Here, we propose {{that the combination of}} temporally local STDP and a multiplicative synaptic normalization mechanism is sufficient to explain the alignment of parallel synapses. To address this issue, we introduce three increasingly complex models: First, we model the idealized interaction of STDP and synaptic normalization in a single neuron as a simple stochastic process and derive analytically that the alignment effect can be described by a so-called Kesten process. From this we can derive that synaptic efficacy alignment requires potentiation-dominated learning regimes. We verify these conditions in a single-neuron model with independent spiking activities but more realistic synapses. As expected, we only observe synaptic efficacy alignment for long-term potentiation-biased STDP. Finally, we explore how well the findings transfer to recurrent neural networks where the learning mechanisms interact with the correlated activity of the network. We find that due to the self-reinforcing correlations in recurrent <b>circuits</b> under STDP, <b>alignment</b> occurs for both long-term potentiation- and depression-biased STDP, because the learning will be potentiation dominated in both cases due to the potentiating events induced by correlated activity. This is in line with recent results demonstrating a dominance of potentiation over depression during waking and normalization during sleep. This leads us to predict that individual spine pairs will be more similar in the morning than they are after sleep depriviation. In conclusion, we show that synaptic normalization in conjunction with coordinated potentiation [...] in this case, from STDP in the presence of correlated pre- and post-synaptic activity [...] naturally leads to an alignment of parallel synapses...|$|R
40|$|An {{attempt is}} made to {{quantify}} the circuit complexity and mean circuit speed of linearly quantized straight PCM video encoding techniques. Any significant reduction in circuit complexity (i. e. the number of active and passive devices to be integrated) is considered important since this determines: chip area and yield if the encoder is to be fully integrated. Analysis indicates that {{the complexity of the}} more highly developed straight PCM video encoders can be reduced by typically a factor 3 using either non-programmed sequential encoding, pulse width modulator encoding or programmed sequential encoding (closed loop successive approximation). The encoder studied in this work is an 8 -bit pulse width modulator video encoder using a 2 -step production line technique and a detailed design procedure for a prototype encoder is given. This encoder is considered to achieve 7 -bit resolution at a sampling rate of 13. 3 MHZ. A mathematical model of the encoder-decoder system is developed for numerical evaluation of the effect of encoder errors and white Gaussian noise upon a coded and decoded video signal. A triangular wave test is applied to examine the effect of encoder errors upon the statio transfer characteristic of the encoder. Dynamic errors are investigated by simulating colour subcarrier at the model input and observing the phase and gain errors at the filtered codec output. Using differential phase and gain, an attempt {{is made to}} determine a <b>circuit</b> design and <b>alignment</b> criterion such that most practical codecs will fall within specific bounds on these parameters (taken as ± 6 ° and ± 6 % respective 1 y). In the absense of dither, Monte Carlo analysis indicates that the maximum voltage error incurred by each encoder error source should have a high probability (95 %) of being less than a half quantum if 85 - 90 % of codecs measured are to fall within the above bounds. If white Gaussian noise is used as a simple dither signal then the probability of a codec falling within the above bounds may increase to about 95 %. Improvements to the encoder are discussed, including several automatic error correction techniques which combat instrumental errors and give a more robust PWM encoder. Also, by predetermining the most significant bit for each set of 4 coded bits it is possible to halve the encoder clock frequency (to 133 MHZ) without significantly changing the encoder complexity...|$|R
