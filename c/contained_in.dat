Naturally, low dietary supply of iodine is {{primary cause of}} iodine deficiency, typically in lack iodine environments [...] Climate, topography, and material entity of area contribute iodine <b>in</b> environment. Iodine <b>contain</b> ofwater is a reliable indicator of the iodine <b>contain</b> <b>in</b> environment. Measurement of iodine <b>contain</b> <b>in</b> groundwater and recording of conditions of it s well/spring of groundwater {{is important}} to Know correlation between iodine contain and local condition of it s spring/well. This research will describes iodine <b>contain</b> <b>in</b> groundwater in western slope of Merapi Mountain, and it s relation with altitude ofit s spring. This research designed cross-sectionall-y. Sample of groundwater was taken from it s spring/well at western slo pe of Merapi Mountain. Location coordinates, altitude, and condition of spring/well was recorded. Iodine <b>contain</b> <b>in</b> groundwater was measured by spectrophotometer method. Iodine <b>contain</b> <b>in</b> groundwater at western slope of Merapi Mountain range from 0 ug/L to 8 ug/L and correlate with altitude in negative way.

The solid support is <b>contained</b> <b>in</b> columns whose dimensions depend {{on the scale of}} synthesis and may vary between 0.05mL and several liters. The overwhelming majority of oligonucleotides are synthesized on small scale ranging from 10nmol to 1μmol. More recently, high-throughput oligonucleotide synthesis where the solid support is <b>contained</b> <b>in</b> the wells of multi-well plates (most often, 96 or 384 wells per plate) became a method of choice for parallel synthesis of oligonucleotides on small scale. At the end of the chain assembly, the oligonucleotide is released from the solid support and is eluted from the column or the well.|$|E
