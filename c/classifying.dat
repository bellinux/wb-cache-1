5|$|The genus Carcharocles may be invalid, and {{the shark}} may {{actually}} {{belong in the}} genus Otodus, making it Otodus megalodon.

A 2006 review of Chondrichthyes elevated Megaselachus to genus, and classified the sharks as Megaselachus megalodon and M. chubutensis. The discovery of fossils assigned to the genus Megalolamna in 2016 led to a re-evaluation of Otodus, which concluded that it is paraphyletic, that is, it consists of a last common ancestor {{but it does not}} include all of its descendants.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{morbidity}} of gay, lesbian or bisexual people attending {{family practice}} {{has not been}} previously assessed. We compared health measures of family practice attendees <b>classified</b> as lesbian, gay and bisexual. Methods We conducted a cross-sectional, controlled study conducted in 13 London family practices and compared the responses of 26 lesbian and 85 bisexual <b>classified</b> women, with that of 934 heterosexual <b>classified</b> women and 38 gay and 23 bisexual <b>classified</b> men with that of 373 heterosexual <b>classified</b> men. Our outcomes of interest were: General health questionnaire; CAGE questionnaire; short form 12; smoking status; sexual experiences during childhood; {{number of sexual partners}} and sexual function and satisfaction. Results In comparison to people <b>classified</b> as heterosexuals: men <b>classified</b> as gay reported higher levels of psychological symptoms (OR 2. 48, CI 1. 05 – 5. 90); women <b>classified</b> as bisexual were more likely to misuse alcohol (OR 2. 73, 1. 70 – 4. 40); women <b>classified</b> as bisexual (OR 2. 53, 1. 60 – 4. 00) and lesbian (OR 3. 13, 1. 41 – 6. 97) and men <b>classified</b> as bisexual (OR 2. 48, 1, 04, 5. 86) {{were more likely to be}} smokers and women <b>classified</b> as bisexual (OR 3. 27, 1. 97 – 5. 43) and men <b>classified</b> as gay (OR 4. 86, 2. 28 – 10. 34) were much more likely to report childhood sexual experiences in childhood. Psychological distress was associated with reporting sexual experiences in childhood in men <b>classified</b> as gay and bisexual and women <b>classified</b> as heterosexual. Men <b>classified</b> as bisexual (OR 5. 00, 1. 73 – 14. 51) and women <b>classified</b> as bisexual (OR 2. 88, 1. 24 - 6. 56) were more likely than heterosexuals to report more than one sexual partner in the preceding four weeks. Lesbian, gay and bisexual <b>classified</b> people encountered no more sexual function problems than heterosexuals but men <b>classified</b> as bisexual (OR 2. 74, 1. 12 – 6. 70) were more dissatisfied with their sex lives. Conclusion Bisexual and lesbian <b>classified</b> people attending London general practices were more likely to be smokers and gay <b>classified</b> men were at increased risk of psychological distress in comparison to heterosexual <b>classified</b> people. Increased awareness of the sexuality of people seen in primary care can provide opportunities for health promotion. </p...|$|R

The barometric pressure decreased by 90hPa (mbar), making Gwenda one of the fastest intensifying storms on record.
