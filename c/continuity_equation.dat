We use a generalization of the exponential scheme to discretize this system of <b>continuity</b> <b>equations</b> with the finite volume method. The system of <b>continuity</b> <b>equations</b> in this work is obtained from a non-singular formulation of the Stefan-Maxwell equations, where the mass constraint is not applied explicitly.

We prove that with the generalized exponential scheme, the mass constraint can be satisfied exactly, although it is not explicitly applied. A test model from the literature is used to verify the correct behavior of the scheme. (c) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. We {{introduce}} a finite volume scheme for multi-dimensional drift-diffusion equations. Such equations {{arise from the}} theory of semiconductors and are composed of two <b>continuity</b> <b>equations</b> coupled with a Poisson equation. In {{the case that the}} <b>continuity</b> <b>equations</b> are non degenerate, we prove the convergence of the scheme and then the existence of solutions to the problem. The key point of the proof relies on the construction of an approximate gradient of the electric potential which allows us to deal with coupled terms in the <b>continuity</b> <b>equations.</b> Finally, a numerical example is given to show the efficiency of the scheme...|$|R

25|$|The {{flow speed}} of a fluid can be {{measured}} using a device such as a Venturi meter or an orifice plate, which can be placed into a pipeline to reduce {{the diameter of the}} flow. For a horizontal device, the <b>continuity</b> <b>equation</b> shows that for an incompressible fluid, the reduction in diameter will cause an increase in the fluid flow speed. Subsequently, Bernoulli's principle then shows that there must be a decrease in the pressure in the reduced diameter region. This phenomenon is known as the Venturi effect.|$|E

40|$|Device {{simulators}} {{are capable}} of numerically solving sets of coupled linear and non-linear differential equations, like Poissons <b>equation</b> and the <b>continuity</b> <b>equations</b> for holes and electrons, in two- or three dimensional device geometries. We have extended a commercial device simulator to include the Langevin recombination term in the <b>continuity</b> <b>equations</b> for holes and electrons. Moreover we have implemented <b>continuity</b> <b>equations</b> for singlet and triplet excitons which use this Lagevin term {{as a source for}} excitons, and which include radiative and on-radiative decay, intersystem crossing, triplet-triplet annihilation, as well as singlet-singlet, singlet-triplet, singlet-polaron and triplet-polaron quenching mechanisms. Energy transfer is implemented as a diffusion term, since the molecular nature of this process is ill-compatible with the continuum nature of the differential equations. Those singlet and triplet <b>continuity</b> <b>equations</b> form a set of coupled non-linear differential equations that can be solved in addition to the Poissons and charge carrier <b>continuity</b> <b>equations.</b> Exciton dissociation has not been implemented yet. As a case study, we simulate and analyse the working of a tetracene light-emitting field effect transistor using our organic device simulator. Tetracene is an archetype organic semiconductor of which most optoelectronic constants have been determined or at least estimated. The field effect transistor has been suggested as a potentially interesting device structure to build an organic laser, provided appropriate optical feedback. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|In this work, {{we propose}} and compare four {{different}} strategies {{to simulate the}} fluid model for streamer propagation in one-dimension (1 D) and quasi two-dimension (2 D), which consists of a Poisson's equation for particle velocity and two <b>continuity</b> <b>equations</b> for particle transport.

The numerical methods for Poisson's equation include finite volume method, discontinuous Galerkin methods, mixed finite element method and least-squared finite element method. The numerical method for <b>continuity</b> <b>equations</b> is chosen from the family of discontinuous Galerkin methods. The accuracy tests and comparisons show that all of these four strategies are suitable and competitive in streamer simulations from the aspects of accuracy and efficiency. Results show these methods are compatible. By applying any strategy in real simulations, we can study the dynamics of streamer propagations in both 1 D and quasi 2 D models...|$|R
40|$|The total {{momentum}} of a thermodynamically closed system is unique, {{as is the}} total energy. Nevertheless, there is continuing confusion concerning the correct form of the momentum and the energy-momentum tensor for an electromagnetic field interacting with a linear dielectric medium. Here we investigate the energy and momentum in a closed system composed of a propagating electromagnetic field and a negligibly reflecting dielectric. The Gordon momentum is easily identified as the total momentum {{by the fact that}} it is, by virtue of being invariant in time, conserved. We construct <b>continuity</b> <b>equations</b> for the energy and the Gordon momentum and use the <b>continuity</b> <b>equations</b> to construct an array that has the properties of a traceless, diagonally symmetric energy-momentum tensor. Then the century-old Abraham-Minkowski momentum controversy can be viewed as a consequence of attempting to construct an energy-momentum tensor from <b>continuity</b> <b>equations</b> that contain densities that correspond to nonconserved quantities.

We suggest numerical scheme of multigrid algorithm for solving Stokes and <b>continuity</b> <b>equations</b> with variable viscosity in a spherical coordinate system.
