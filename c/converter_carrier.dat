40|$|Abstract [...] With {{numerous}} advantages, {{the direct}} drive, grid-connected permanent magnet synchronous generation system represents one important trend of wind power applications nowadays. With active controls, parallel operation {{is becoming a}} promising solution in three-phase power conversion. In order to solve the zero-sequence circulating current problem, a novel converter topology with isolated DC link dual back-to-back PWM parallel converter has been proposed {{for the application of}} PMSG to the VSCF power conversion. A Carrier phase shifted (CPS-SPWM) technique is used in parallel converter systems in order to reduce current ripples. Carrier phase shifted technique based on paralleling back to back PWM converter was applied on direct drive wind power system. Good performance is attained even if the switching frequency is only 1 k Hz as shown in the experimental results, which means that high equivalent switch frequency and current waveform under low switch frequency condition are realized. At the same time, avoid a zero-sequence circulating problem. Index Terms [...] Back to back PWM <b>converter,</b> <b>Carrier</b> phas...|$|E
40|$|Abstract [...] Three {{phase supply}} is {{available}} in the generating station or grid, were as nine phase supply is required for many industrial applications such as, aerospace, railway and automobile applications. There are different methods in which we can convert 3 to 9 phase using 18 -Pulse <b>Converter,</b> <b>Carrier</b> Based PWM Technique, multilevel converter and Multiphase Transformer. The above said methods which are more complicated to design for higher ratings or a pure sine wave will not be obtained or harmonics will be more. For Multiphase power transmission system multiphase transformers are needed. In the multiphase power transmission and multiphase rectifier systems, the number of phase can be designed and developed in multiples of three. Therefore, the variable speed multiphase drive system considered in the literature are mostly of five, seven, nine, eleven, twelve, and fifteen phase. So, {{there is a need to}} design and develop special transformer which converts from 3 to 9 phase for different arrangement of input and output. Thus, with the proposed technique, a pure nine-phase sine-wave of fixed voltage/current and frequency is obtained, which can be used for RL load and motor testing purposes. Complete design and simulation of the proposed solution is presented. Analytical calculation and simulation results for RL load is presented in the paper. This model can be simulated by using Orcad simulation software and „SIMPOWERSYSTEMS ‟ block sets of MATLAB/SIMULINK software...|$|E

In order to evaluate the instrument's ultimate noise floor, the phase and amplitude noise of a stabilized OFC are measured simultaneously using two analog-to-digital <b>converters.</b> <b>Carrier</b> recovery and phase detection are done by post-processing, eliminating the need for external phase-locked loops and complex calibration techniques. In order to adapt the measurement noise floor and the number of averages used in cross correlation, an adaptive frequency resolution for noise measurement is applied.

40|$|Abstract. If {{the ratio}} of NPC/H and H bridge hybrid {{multilevel}} converter’s DC supply voltage changed, the output voltage PWM waveform will be discontinuous. Thus an improved topology and control strategy is proposed. In new method, master converter operates at the fundamental frequency based on command voltage, slave <b>converter</b> adopts <b>carrier</b> phase shifted PWM technology (CPS-SPWM) at a higher frequency to {{enhance the quality of}} output voltage waveform. The amplitude of command voltage is higher than output voltage amplitude of the master converter at any time, to ensure that output voltage variation of both converters keeps in the same direction without any current flow backwards.

40|$|Power {{electronic}} converters are in {{the heart}} of modern renewable energy and motor drive systems. This Thesis focuses on the converter dc-link capacitor (bank), which is a costly component and a common source of failures. The Thesis is divided into two parts. The first part examines the voltage and current stress induced on dc-link capacitors by the three most common converter topologies: The conventional two-level converter, the Neutral-Point-Clamped (NPC) three-level converter, and the Cascaded H-Bridge (CHB) three-level converter. The expressions derived for the rms capacitor current and its harmonics {{can be used as a}} tool for capacitor sizing. The harmonic analysis is then extended to systems that incorporate multiple converters connected to a common dc-link capacitor. The effect of introducing a phase shift to the <b>converter</b> <b>carrier</b> waveforms is examined, showing that reductions in the order of 30 to 50 % in the common capacitor rms current can be achieved using appropriate phase shifts. The second part tackles the dc-link capacitor balancing problem, also known as Neutral Point (NP) balancing problem of the three-level NPC converter. Initially, a circuit that halves the voltage stress caused by the NP voltage oscillations (ripple) on the switching devices the NPC converter is proposed. The circuit consists of low voltage rated components which offer the advantages of lower losses, volume and cost, as compared to other balancing circuits. Subsequently, the study focuses on modulation strategies for the NPC converter. Starting with Nearest-Vector (NV) strategies, it proves that the criterion of the direction of dc-link capacitor imbalance, which is commonly adopted by NV strategies for performing the task of capacitor balancing, poses a barrier in achieving minimum NP voltage ripple. A new criterion is proposed instead, together with an algorithm that incorporates it into existing NV strategies. For the interesting case of NPC converters operating as motor drives, the resulting reduction in the amplitude of NP voltage ripple ranges from 30 to 50 %. The study finishes with an extension of the previous concept to create hybrid (combinations of NV and non NV) strategies for the NPC converter. Hybrid strategies are proposed that can eliminate NP voltage ripple, introducing lower switching losses and output voltage distortion as compared to other methods used for the same purpose. The proposed strategies perform equally well when the converter operates with non linear or imbalanced loads. All results are verified by extensive simulations using MATLAB-Simulink...|$|E

40|$|Recently gold {{nanoparticles}} (GNPs) {{have been}} actively studied as photothermal <b>converters,</b> drug <b>carriers,</b> and imaging agents {{in a wide}} range of applications in cancer diagnosis and therapy. The prolonged peroral administration of GNPs in a range of sizes was performed to investigate the morphological changes and their reversibility in the internal organs of laboratory animals. In this study, GNPs with average diameters of 2 nm, 15 nm and 50 nm were administered during 30 days, and the reversibility of morphological changes was investigated 14 days after administration. After the prolonged administration of GNPs, the severity of morphological changes in the liver, kidney, spleen and lymph nodes depended on the nanoparticle size. Specifically, 50 nm nanoparticles caused the most pronounced dystrophic and necrobiotic effects, whereas the smallest 2 nm nanoparticles caused proliferative changes. Most importantly, the development of pathological processes was reversible, as evidenced by the gradual restoration of the organ structure at 14 days after the end of GNPs administration...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Orthogonal {{frequency-division}} multiplexing (OFDM) -based ultra-wide-band (UWB) transceivers hold {{the promise to}} revolutionize {{the next generation of}} short-range wireless networks and to be adopted in electronics products for both civil and military applications. For the UWB transceivers to coexist with nearby devices, it is necessary to design efficient UWB receivers whose operation is robust to narrowband interferences (NBI). This paper conducts an in-depth analysis to establish the impacts of NBI on the performance of an OFDM-UWB receiver. A comprehensive study to assess the effects of NBI on the quantization noise in the analog-to-digital converter (ADC), timing, and carrier acquisition is presented. The analytical results show that the efficiency of the ADC is degraded by NBI, although this problem could be slightly remedied by an adaptive autogain controller (AGC). It is also found that, compared with the conventional autocorrelation-based acquisition scheme, the pseudonoise (PN) sequence matched-filtering-based acquisition scheme presents higher robustness to NBI. Nevertheless, both these two acquisition schemes fail at high interference levels. As a conclusion, it is critical to develop novel and low-complexity NBI mitigation schemes for OFDM-UWB receivers that take into account the impacts introduced by NBI.

40|$|Cross {{sectional}} {{studies of}} patients {{at risk of}} developing Alzheimer disease (AD) have identified several brain regions known {{to be prone to}} degeneration suitable as biomarkers, including hippocampal, ventricular and whole brain volume. The aim {{of this study was to}} longitudinally evaluate an index based on morphometric measures derived from MRI data that could be used for classification of AD and healthy control subjects, as well as prediction of conversion from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to AD. Patients originated from the AddNeuroMed project at baseline (119 AD, 119 MCI, 110 controls (CTL)) and one-year follow-up (62 AD, 73 MCI, 79 CTL). Data consisted of 3 D T 1 -weighted MR images, demographics, MMSE, ADAS-Cog, CERAD and CDR scores, and APOE e 4 status. We computed an index using a multivariate classification model (AD vs. CTL), using orthogonal partial least squares to latent structures (OPLS). Sensitivity, specificity and AUC were determined. Performance of the classifier (AD vs. CTL) was high at baseline (10 -fold cross-validation, 84 % sensitivity, 91 % specificity, 0. 93 AUC) and at one-year follow-up (92 % sensitivity, 74 % specificity, 0. 93 AUC). Predictions of conversion from MCI to AD were good at baseline (77 % of MCI converters) and at follow-up (91 % of MCI <b>converters).</b> MCI <b>carriers</b> of the APOE e 4 allele manifested more atrophy and presented a faster cognitive decline when compared to non-carriers. The derived index displayed a steady increase in atrophy over time, yielding higher accuracy in prediction at the time of clinical conversion. Neuropsychological tests appeared less sensitive to changes over time. However, taking the average of the two time points yielded better correlation between the index and cognitive scores as opposed to using cross-sectional data only. Thus, classification of whole-brain MR data seemed to detect patterns of AD changes before conversion from MCI to AD...|$|R
30|$|We can {{conclude}} that the link-budget-based estimation from [3] is an adequate method for obtaining the uplink dynamic range threshold for the receiver at hand. Furthermore, we conclude that the uplink dynamic range {{plays an important role}} when configuring the uplink transmit power control since the differences in total signal losses between users connected to the same base station can easily be larger than or equal to 60 dB. This holds true not only for LTE but also for any future systems in which the user separation takes place after the analog-to-digital converter. We would {{like to point out that}} the problem of limiting the uplink dynamic range can be considered to become more challenging in future due to the arising trend of receiving more and more signals and bandwidth simultaneously using one analog-to-digital <b>converter</b> (see, e.g., <b>carrier</b> aggregation). Also, we would like to mention that in practical scenarios users which are at the cell edge are typically transmitting on only a couple of PRBs because they are not capable transmitting on more PRBs, while users with a good channel may have considerably more bandwidth. This bandwidth differences, in fact, provoke a high dynamic range.|$|R
