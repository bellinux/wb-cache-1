5|$|James J. Murakami {{supervised}} the production design. Location scouting revealed {{that many of}} the older buildings in Los Angeles had been torn down, including the entire neighborhood where Collins lived. Suburban areas in San Dimas, San Bernardino and Pasadena doubled for 1920s Los Angeles instead. The Old Town district of San Dimas stood in for Collins' neighborhood and some adjacent locales. Murakami said Old Town was chosen because very little had changed since the 1920s. It was used for interiors and exteriors; the crew decorated the area with a subdued color palette to evoke feelings of <b>comfort.</b> <b>For</b> some exterior shots they renovated derelict properties in neighborhoods of Los Angeles that still possessed 1920s architecture. The crew staged {{the third floor of the}} Park Plaza Hotel in Los Angeles into a replica of the 1920s Los Angeles City Council chambers.|$|E
5|$|The {{coaches are}} {{primarily}} hauled by MPI MPXpress series locomotives. The current model, the 4000-horsepower MP40PH-3C, {{is more powerful}} that their predecessors, the EMD F59PH. They are capable of pulling or pushing trains of 12 coaches instead of 10. More than 60 of these locomotives have been ordered since their introduction in 2006, with a further 16 types of an even more powerful model, the MP54AC, to enter service in coming years. Opposite the locomotive, trains are bookended by cab cars, which are coaches with driver controls incorporated into them. While most of them closely resemble ordinary coaches, GO Transit began upgrading their rail fleet with newly designed, more crashworthy cab cars {{in the summer of}} 2015, incorporating an improved visibility, safety features and <b>comfort</b> <b>for</b> train crews.|$|E
5|$|The median is {{the halfway}} point, {{which means that}} 50% of people will die before eight months, but the other half will live longer, {{potentially}} much longer. He then needed to determine where his personal characteristics placed him within this range. Given that the cancer was detected early, he was young, optimistic, and had the best treatments available, Gould reasoned {{that he should be}} in the favorable half of the upper statistical range. After an experimental treatment of radiation, chemotherapy, and surgery, Gould made a full recovery, and his column became a source of <b>comfort</b> <b>for</b> many cancer patients.|$|E

5|$|In {{the middle}} of the 13th century Henry III began to {{redesign}} his favourite castles, including Winchester and Windsor, building larger halls, grander chapels, installing glass windows and decorating the palaces with painted walls and furniture. This marked the beginning of a trend towards the development of grand castles designed for elaborate, elite living. Life in earlier keeps had been focused around a single great hall, with privacy for the owner's family provided by using an upper floor for their own living accommodation. By the 14th century nobles were travelling less, bringing much larger households with them when they did travel and entertaining visitors with equally large retinues. Castles such as Goodrich were redesigned in the 1320s to provide greater residential privacy and <b>comfort</b> <b>for</b> the ruling family, while retaining strong defensive features and a capacity to hold over 130 residents at the castle. The design influenced subsequent conversions at Berkeley and by the time that Bolton Castle was being built, in the 1380s, it was designed to hold up to eight different noble households, each with their own facilities. Royal castles such as Beaumaris, although designed with defence in mind, were designed to hold up to eleven different households at any one time.|$|E

25|$|A sea kayak or touring kayak is a kayak {{developed}} for the sport of paddling on open waters of lakes, bays, and the ocean.

25|$|The Hatz Classic is a {{development}} of the Hatz CB-1. The major differences from the CB-1 are that the fuselage is more rounded, it mounts a larger engine, it uses push-pull tubes instead of control cables for the ailerons and elevators and it has aluminum ailerons.

The rifle is fully ambidextrous and possesses flexibility for assault, marksman and suppressive roles.|$|E
25|$|Hiking {{boots are}} {{designed}} to provide extra ankle and arch support, as well as extra padding for comfort during hiking. They are constructed to provide <b>comfort</b> <b>for</b> miles of walking over rough terrains, and protect the hiker's feet against water, mud, rocks, and other wilderness obstacles. These boots support the ankle to avoid twisting but do not restrict the ankle's movement too much. They are fairly stiff to support the foot. A properly fitted boot and/or friction-reducing patches applied to troublesome areas ensures protection against blisters and other discomforts associated with long hikes on rugged terrain.|$|E
25|$|While {{in prison}} Allan used her privileged {{position}} {{to improve the}} levels of <b>comfort</b> <b>for</b> her inmates, including distributing confectionery and fruit to fellow suffragettes. Two months into her sentence, she barricaded {{the door to her}} cell, and it reportedly took three men with tools around three quarters of an hour to break into the room. Following this action, Allan started a hunger strike, a form of protest that had been pioneered amongst the suffragette movement by Marion Dunlop in 1909. However, following Dunlop having thus successfully forced the authorities to release her on health grounds, the British government introduced a policy of forced-feeding of imprisoned suffragette activists who refused food.|$|E
