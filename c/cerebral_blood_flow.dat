5|$|Causes include falls, vehicle collisions, and violence. Brain trauma {{occurs as}} a {{consequence}} of a sudden acceleration or deceleration within the cranium or by a complex combination of both movement and sudden impact. In addition to the damage caused at the moment of injury, a variety of events in the minutes to days following the injury may result in secondary injury. These processes include alterations in <b>cerebral</b> <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> and the pressure within the skull. Some of the imaging techniques used for diagnosis include computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRIs).|$|E
5|$|Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is a clear, colorless {{body fluid}} {{found in the}} brain and spinal cord.

There is about 125mL of CSF at any one time, and about 500mL is generated every day.

5|$|The second theory {{posits that}} either {{increased}} {{blood flow to}} the brain or increase in the brain tissue itself may result in the raised pressure. Little evidence has accumulated to support the suggestion that increased blood flow plays a role, but recently Bateman et al. in phase contrast MRA studies have quantified <b>cerebral</b> <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> (CBF) in vivo and suggests that CBF is abnormally elevated in many patients with IIH.

Objective: To investigate the effect of a single chiropractic adjustment on middle <b>cerebral</b> artery <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> and radial artery blood pressure response.

40|$|Objective: Ischaemic stroke is {{a leading}} cause of death and disability. Autoregulation and {{collateral}} <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> through the circle of Willis both play a role in preventing tissue infarction. To investigate the interaction of these mechanisms a one-dimensional steady state model of the cerebral arterial network was created. Methods: Structural variants of the circle of Willis that present particular risk of stroke were recreated using a network model coupled with: (1) a steady state physiological model of cerebral autoregulation; (2) one wherein the cerebral vascular bed was modelled as a passive resistance. Simulations were performed in various conditions of internal carotid and vertebral artery occlusion. Results: Collateral flow alone is unable to ensure adequate <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> (> 90 % normal flow) to the cerebral arteries in several common variants during internal carotid artery occlusion. However, compared to a passive model, cerebral autoregulation is better able to exploit available collateral flow and to maintain flows within 10 % of baseline. This is true for nearly all configurations. Conclusion: Hence, autoregulation is a crucial facilitator of collateral flow through the circle of Willis. Significance: Impairment of this response during ischemia will severely impact <b>cerebral</b> <b>blood</b> <b>flows,</b> and tissue survival, and hence autoregulation should be monitored in this situation...|$|R

40|$|Objective: To {{study the}} fetal middle <b>cerebral</b> artery <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> {{characteristics}} of gestational hypertension combined with fetal distress in uterus {{as well as}} their correlation with hypoxia. Methods: Puerperae with hypertensive disorders in pregnancy and fetal distress in uterus, puerperae with hypertensive disorders in pregnancy alone and healthy puerperae who gave birth in our hospital between January 2013 and January 2016 were included in group A, group B and group C of the study respectively. At 34 - 36 weeks of pregnancy, color Doppler ultrasonography was conducted to determine fetal middle <b>cerebral</b> artery <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> parameters; after childbirth, umbilical arterial blood was collected to determine blood gas analysis parameters, and the placenta tissue was collected to determine oxidative stress and mitochondria damage indexes. Results: Fetal middle cerebral artery S/D, PI and RI of group A were significantly higher than those of group B and group C while umbilical artery pH value and PaO 2 as well as HCO 3 - and BE content were significantly lower than those of group B and group C; fetal middle cerebral artery S/D, PI and RI as well as umbilical artery pH value, PaO 2, HCO 3 - and BE content of group B were not significantly different from those of group C; Nrf 2, ARE, NQO 1, VitC, SVCT 1, SVCT 2, ATP, PGC- 1 α, PGC- 1 毬, NRF 1 and NRF 2 content in placenta tissue of group A were significantly lower than those of group B and group C while ROS content was significantly higher than those of group B and group C; Nrf 2, ARE, NQO 1, VitC, SVCT 1, SVCT 2, ATP, PGC- 1 α, PGC- 1 毬, NRF 1 and NRF 2 content in placenta tissue of group B were significantly lower than those of group C while ROS content was significantly higher than that of group C. Fetal middle cerebral artery S/D, PI and RI were negatively correlated with umbilical artery pH value, PaO 2, HCO 3 - and BE content as well as Nrf 2, ARE, NQO 1, VitC, SVCT 1, SVCT 2, ATP, PGC- 1 α, PGC- 1 毬, NRF 1 and NRF 2 content, and were positively correlated with ROS content. Conclusions: Gestational hypertension combined with fetal distress in uterus can lead to increased fetal middle <b>cerebral</b> artery <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> resistance and decreased blood perfusion, and the changes of middle <b>cerebral</b> artery <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> characteristics can assess the degree of hypoxia and oxidative stress damage...|$|R
40|$|Background and purpose: Actions of {{glutamate}} and serotonin {{on their}} respective receptors in the dorsal facial area (DFA) of the medulla {{are known to}} regulate common carotid arterial (CCA) <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> in cats. Less is known about acetylcholine action on its nicotinic receptor (nAChR) subtypes in the DFA for regulation of CCA <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> and this aspect was investigated. Experimental approach: Nicotinic and muscarinic agonists and antagonists were microinjected into the DFA through a three-barrel tubing in anesthetized cats. Results: CCA <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> was dose-dependently increased by nicotine (a non-selective nAChR agonist) and choline (a selective alpha 7 -nAChR agonist). These effects of nicotine were attenuated by alpha-bungarotoxin (an alpha 7 -nAChR antagonist), methyllycaconitine (an alpha 7 -nAChR antagonist), mecamylamine (a relatively selective alpha 3 beta 4 -nAChR antagonist) and dihydro-beta-erythroidine (a relatively selective alpha 4 beta 2 -nAChR antagonist). The choline-induced flow increase was attenuated by alpha-bungarotoxin and mecamylamine, but not by dihydro-beta-erythroidine. Muscarinic agonists (muscarine and methacholine) and antagonist (atropine) affected neither the basal nor the nicotine-induced increase in the CCA <b>blood</b> <b>flow.</b> Conclusions and implications: Functional alpha 7, alpha 4 beta 2, and alpha 3 beta 4 subunits of the nAChR appear to be present on the DFA neurons. Activations of these receptors increase the CCA <b>blood</b> <b>flow.</b> The present findings do not preclude {{the presence of other}} nAChRs subunits.
