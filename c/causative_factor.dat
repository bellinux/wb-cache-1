25|$|Helicobacter pylori was {{identified}} in 1982 by two Australian scientists, Robin Warren and Barry J. Marshall as a <b>causative</b> <b>factor</b> for ulcers. In their original paper, Warren and Marshall contended that most gastric ulcers and gastritis {{were caused by}} colonization with this bacterium, not by stress or spicy food as had been assumed before.|$|E
25|$|A major <b>causative</b> <b>factor</b> (60% of gastric {{and up to}} 50–75% of {{duodenal}} ulcers) is chronic inflammation due to Helicobacter pylori that colonizes the antral mucosa. The {{immune system}} is unable to clear the infection, despite the appearance of antibodies. Thus, the bacterium can cause a chronic active gastritis (type B gastritis). Gastrin stimulates the production of gastric acid by parietal cells. In H. pylori colonization responses to increased gastrin, the increase in acid {{can contribute to the}} erosion of the mucosa and therefore ulcer formation.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{assesses the}} {{performance}} of the landslide susceptibility analysis using frequency ratio (FR) with an iterative random sampling. A pair of before-and-after digital aerial photographs with 50 [*]cm spatial resolution was used to detect landslide occurrences in Yongin area, Korea. Iterative random sampling was run ten times in total and each time it was applied to the training and validation datasets. Thirteen landslide <b>causative</b> <b>factors</b> were derived from the topographic, soil, forest, and geological maps. The FR scores were calculated from the <b>causative</b> <b>factors</b> and training occurrences repeatedly ten times. The ten landslide susceptibility maps were obtained from the integration of <b>causative</b> <b>factors</b> that assigned FR scores. The landslide susceptibility maps were validated by using each validation dataset. The FR method achieved susceptibility accuracies from 89. 48 % to 93. 21 %. And the landslide susceptibility accuracy of the FR method is higher than 89 %. Moreover, the ten times iterative FR modeling may contribute {{to a better understanding of}} a regularized relationship between the <b>causative</b> <b>factors</b> and landslide susceptibility. This makes it possible to incorporate knowledge-driven considerations of the <b>causative</b> <b>factors</b> into the landslide susceptibility analysis and also be extensively used to other areas...|$|R

25|$|Neprilysin-deficient {{knockout}} mice show both Alzheimer's-like behavioral {{impairment and}} amyloid-beta deposition in the brain, providing strong {{evidence for the}} protein's association with the Alzheimer's disease process. Because neprilysin {{is thought to be}} the rate-limiting step in amyloid beta degradation, it has been considered a potential therapeutic target; compounds such as the peptide hormone somatostatin have been identified that increase the enzyme's activity level. One hypothesis for the strong dependence of Alzheimer's incidence on age focuses on the declining production of somatostatin in the brains of elderly people, which thus depresses the activity of neprilysin and promotes aggregation of unprocessed amyloid beta. Declining neprilysin activity with increasing age may also be explained by oxidative damage, known to be a <b>causative</b> <b>factor</b> in Alzheimer's disease; higher levels of inappropriately oxidized neprilysin have been found in Alzheimer's patients compared to cognitively normal elderly people.|$|E
25|$|The {{view that}} occlusal trauma (as may occur during bruxism) is a <b>causative</b> <b>factor</b> in {{gingivitis}} and periodontitis is not widely accepted. It {{is thought that}} the periodontal ligament may respond to increased occlusal (biting) forces by resorbing some of the bone of the alveolar crest, which may result in increased tooth mobility, however these changes are reversible if the occlusal force is reduced. Tooth movement that occurs during occlusal loading is sometimes termed fremitus. It is generally accepted that increased occlusal forces are able to increase the rate of progression of pre-existing periodontal disease (gum disease), however the main stay treatment is plaque control rather than elaborate occlusal adjustments. It is also generally accepted that periodontal disease {{is a far more}} common cause of tooth mobility and pathological tooth migration than any influence of bruxism, although bruxism may much less commonly be involved in both.|$|E

500|$|Virginian {{newspapers}} praised Pickett's Virginia division {{as making}} the most progress during the charge, and the papers used Pickett's comparative success {{as a means of}} criticizing the actions of the other states' troops during the charge. It was this publicity that played a significant factor in selecting the name Pickett's Charge. Pickett's military career was never the same after the charge, and he was displeased about having his name attached to the repulsed charge. In particular North Carolinians have long taken exception to the characterizations and point to the poor performance of Brockenbrough's Virginians in the advance as a major <b>causative</b> <b>factor</b> of failure. Some historians have questioned the primacy of Pickett's role in the battle. W. R.

500|$|In pulpitis, an {{important}} distinction in regard to treatment is whether the inflammation is reversible or irreversible. Treatment of reversible pulpitis is by removing or correcting the <b>causative</b> <b>factor.</b> Usually, the decay is removed, and a sedative dressing is used to encourage the pulp {{to return to a}} state of health, either as a base underneath a permanent filling or as a temporary filling intended to last for a period while the tooth is observed to see if pulpitis resolves. Irreversible pulpitis and its sequalae pulp necrosis and apical periodontitis require treatment with root canal therapy or tooth extraction, as the pulp acts as a nidus of infection, which will lead to a chronic infection if not removed. [...] Generally, there is no difference in outcomes between whether the root canal treatment is completed in one or multiple appointments. The field of regenerative endodontics is now developing ways to clean the pulp chamber and regenerate the soft and hard tissues to either regrow or simulate pulp structure. This has proved especially helpful in children where the tooth root has not yet finished developing and root canal treatments have lower success rates.|$|E

2500|$|The skin of {{the bony}} ear canal is unique, {{in that it is}} not movable but is closely {{attached}} to the bone, and it is almost paper thin. For these reasons, it is easily abraded or torn by even minimal physical force. Inflammation of the ear canal skin typically begins with a physical insult, most often from injury caused by attempts at self-cleaning or scratching with cotton swabs, pen caps, fingernails, hair pins, keys, or other small implements. Another <b>causative</b> <b>factor</b> for acute infection is prolonged water exposure in the forms of swimming or exposure to extreme humidity, which can compromise the protective barrier function of the canal skin, allowing bacteria to flourish, hence the name [...] "swimmer's ear".|$|E
2500|$|An ulcer {{that keeps}} forming {{on the same}} site and then healing {{may be caused by}} a nearby sharp surface, and ulcers that heal and then recur at {{different}} sites are likely to be RAS. Malignant ulcers are likely to be single in number, and conversely, multiple ulcers are very unlikely to be oral cancer. The size of the ulcers may be helpful in distinguishing the types of RAS, as can the location (minor RAS mainly occurs on non-keratinizing mucosa, major RAS occurs anywhere in the mouth or oropharynx). Induration, contact bleeding and rolled margins are features of a malignant ulcer. There may be nearby <b>causative</b> <b>factor,</b> e.g. a broken tooth with a sharp edge that is traumatizing the tissues.

2500|$|Historically, many {{believed}} that {{problems with the}} bite were the sole cause for bruxism. It was often claimed that a person would grind at the interfering area in a subconscious, instinctive attempt to wear this down and [...] "self equiliberate" [...] their occlusion. However, occlusal interferences are extremely common and usually do not cause any problems. It is unclear whether people with bruxism tend to notice problems with the bite because of their clenching and grinding habit, or whether these act as a <b>causative</b> <b>factor</b> {{in the development of}} the condition. In sleep bruxism especially, there is no evidence that removal of occlusal interferences has any impact on the condition. People with no teeth at all who wear dentures can still suffer from bruxism, although dentures also often change the original bite. Most modern sources state that there is no relationship, or at most a minimal relationship, between bruxism and occlusal factors. The findings of one study, which used self-reported tooth grinding rather than clinical examination to detect bruxism, suggested that there may be more of a relationship between occlusal factors and bruxism in children. However, the role of occlusal factors in bruxism cannot be completely discounted due to insufficient evidence and problems with the design of studies. A minority of researchers continue to claim that various adjustments to the mechanics of the bite are capable of curing bruxism (see Occlusal adjustment/reorganization).|$|E
2500|$|From {{the late}} 19th {{to the early}} 21st century, the Anglo-Cornish dialect {{declined}} somewhat due {{to the spread of}} long-distance travel, mass education and the mass media, and increased migration into Cornwall of people from, principally, the south-east of England. Universal elementary education had begun in England and Wales in the 1870s. Thirty years later Mark Guy Pearse wrote: [...] "The characteristics of Cornwall and the Cornish are rapidly passing away. More than a hundred years ago its language died. Now its dialect is dying. It is useless to deplore it, for it is inevitable." [...] Although the erosion of dialect is popularly blamed on the mass media, many academics assert the primacy of face-to-face linguistic contact in dialect levelling. It is further asserted by some that peer groups are the primary mechanism. It is unclear whether in the erosion of the Anglo-Cornish dialect, high levels of migration into Cornwall from outside in the 20th century, or deliberate efforts to suppress dialect forms (in an educational context) are the primary <b>causative</b> <b>factor.</b> Anglo-Cornish dialect speakers are more likely than Received Pronunciation speakers in Cornwall to experience social and economic disadvantages and poverty, including spiralling housing costs, in many, particularly coastal areas of Cornwall, and have at times been actively discouraged from using the dialect, particularly in the schools. In the 1910s the headmaster of a school in a Cornish fishing port received this answer when he suggested to the son of the local coastguard (a boy with rough and ready Cornish speech) that it was time he learned to speak properly: [...] "An what d'yer think me mates down to the quay 'ud think o' me if I did?" ...|$|E
