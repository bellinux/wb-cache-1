In 2005-2006, a new phase of pension reforms launched under which <b>the</b> <b>RA</b> Government adopted a series of regulatory decisions. The final reasoning was the Law “On Funded Pensions” made on December 22, 2010 <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>RA</b> National Assembly. Thus, the pension system in Armenia became a multi pillar one: 2 new voluntary and mandatory funded pension components have been introduced.
