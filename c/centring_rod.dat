40|$|The {{traditional}} anvil grasper may {{be difficult}} to use for connecting the stem of an anvil with the <b>centre</b> <b>rod</b> of a circular stapler because the grasper holds the anvil completely still.

40|$|Interactions between rod and cone {{signals in}} mudpuppy retinal neurones were {{investigated}} by intracellular recording. 2. The mudpuppy retina contains {{one kind of}} rod (lambda max = 525 nm) and one kind of cone (lambda max = 572 nm). The responses of receptors can be distinguished {{on the basis of}} their spectral sensitivities. 3. Rod and cone responses have different time courses of recovery and absolute sensitivities. Differences between receptor responses can be used to describe inputs to interneurones. 4. There are two spectral classes of horizontal cells: L-type and C-type. L-type cells are hyperpolarized by rods and cones in varying proportion, with some cells receiving little rod input. C-type cells are hyperpolarized by rods and depolarized by cones. 5. Bipolar cell receptive field centres receive input from cones or from rods and cones. There is no correlation between the spectral properties of centre responses and their polarity. 6. Antagonistic surrounds of bipolar cells show cone or rod and cone sensitivity. They are believed to be generated by the L-type horizontal cells. 7. Some bipolar cells exhibit chromatic interactions between cone signals in the <b>centre</b> and <b>rod</b> signals in the surround, which resemble those observed between the signals of different spectral classes of cones in species known to possess colour discrimination. 8.

5000|$|From 1633 [...] {{gunpowder}} {{was used}} both for ore extraction and for driving gangways. This increased the daily headway considerably, {{from a few}} centimetres into the lode to a metre or more. The disadvantage, however, was that even more wood was needed to extend the mine, because blasting caused the rock to fissure. When blasting, first {{a cut in the}} lode was made about 3 metres high and deep and a little less than a metre wide using hammer and chisel. Next one or two transverse boreholes with a 6-7 cm diameter were drilled by hand Usually two-man boring was employed: one turned the borer whilst a second hit it with his sledge. The holes were filled with gunpowder and stuffed with a wooden peg which had a hole for a slow-match wick. Unlike blasting with modern explosive, the stemming had to be wedged in using an iron <b>rod</b> <b>centred</b> on the borehole and a thick wooden prop in a slot (Bühnloch) on the opposite side.

Older twin-carburetor setup often had each carb throat feeding the front two and the rear two cylinders, resulting in uneven 180°-540°-180°-540° intake pulse on each throat. Modern inline-four engines normally have four equal-length runners to a plenum (which is fed by a throttle at 180° evenly distributed frequency), or four individual throttles (at 720° equal spacing on each throttle).|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Registry {{data from}} four major public {{hospitals}} indicate trends in clinical care and survival from colorectal cancer over three decades, from 1980 to 2010. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Kaplan-Meier product- limit estimates and Cox proportional hazards models {{were used to}} investigate disease-specific survival and multiple logistic regression analyses to explore first-round treatment trends. RESULTS: Five-year survivals increased from 48 % for 1980 - 1986 to 63 % for 2005 - 2010 diagnoses. Survival increases applied to each ACPS stage (Australian Clinico-Pathological Stage), and particularly stage C (an increase from 38 % to 68 %). Risk of death from colorectal cancer halved (hazards ratio: 0. 50 (0. 45, 0. 56)) over the study period after adjusting for age, sex, stage, differentiation, primary sub-site, health administrative region, and measures of socioeconomic status and geographic remoteness. Decreases in stage were not observed. Survivals did not vary by sex or place of residence, suggesting reasonable equity in service access and outcomes. Of staged cases, 91 % were treated surgically with lower surgical rates for older ages and more advanced stage. Proportions of surgical cases having adjuvant therapy during primary courses of treatment increased for all stages and were highest for stage C (an increase from 5 % in 1980 - 1986 to 63 % for 2005 - 2010). Radiotherapy was more common for rectal than colonic cases. Proportions of rectal cases receiving radiotherapy increased, particularly for stage C where the increase was from 8 % in 1980 - 1986 to 60 % in 2005 - 2010. The percentage of stage C colorectal cases less than 70 years of age having systemic therapy {{as part of their}} first treatment round increased from 3 % in 1980 - 1986 to 81 % by 1995 - 2010. Based on survey data on uptake of adjuvant therapy among those offered this care, it is likely that all these younger patients were offered systemic treatment. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that pronounced increases in survivals from colorectal cancer have occurred at major public hospitals in South Australia due to increases in stage-specific survivals. Use of adjuvant therapies has increased and the patterns of change accord with clinical guideline recommendations. Reasons for sub-optimal use of radiotherapy for rectal cases warrant further investigation, including the potential for limited rural access to impede uptake of treatments at metropolitan-based radiotherapy <b>centres.</b> David <b>Roder,</b> Christos S Karapetis, David Wattchow, James Moore, Nimit Singhal, Rohit Joshi, Dorothy Keefe, Kellie Fusco, Kate Powell, Marion Eckert, Timothy J Pric...|$|R
40|$|In {{this thesis}} {{the use of}} active GRadient-INdex (GRIN) media with gain or loss for laser beam shaping {{purposes}} is presented and particularized for materials described by a complex parabolic and hyperbolic secant refractive index profiles. The expressions for the complex refractive index of these media are derived and examined {{in order to discuss}} what loss or gain means in terms of the index. The formalism of laser beam propagation in active GRIN materials regarded as beam transformers with a Gaussian mask is presented. Moreover, the general conditions for beam transformations by active GRIN materials as a geometrical solution in 2 D space of the complex curvature of the input laser beam are obtained and discussed. Application examples of active GRIN media with gain or loss as beam shaping systems are presented using MATLAB software and a tolerance analysis is performed for a particular laser source. Additionally, preliminary research on active GRIN media fabrication by Sol-Gel process and Laser Zone Melting (LZM) technique was performed. Erbium and ytterbium-doped films based on SiO 2 -TiO 2 and SiO 2 systems were prepared by sol-gel method. Optical constants, thickness and porosity of selected samples were determined using Spectral Ellipsometry, whereas topographical inspection was conducted by Atomic Force Microscopy. The analysis of luminescence spectra of the erbium sol-gel derived films around 1. 54 μm was also performed. In LZM technique, SiO 2 rods precursors are dip-coated using a suspension of different inorganic compounds in isopropyl alcohol and the subsequent sintering process is performed using a CO 2 laser. Structural properties and chemical composition of the samples were characterized by Scanning Electron Microscopy combined with Energy Dispersive X-ray analysis, revealing the axial and gradual incorporation of dysprosium oxide and lithium niobate within the silica cylinder.

40|$|Milner and Goodale (1995, 2006) {{propose a}} model of vision that makes a {{distinction}} between ‘vision for perception’ and ‘vision for action’. Regarding hemispatial neglect, they, somewhat contentiously, hypothesize that this disorder is better explained by damage to a high-level representational structure that receives input from the ventral visual stream, but not from the dorsal-stream. Consequently, they postulate that neglect patients should code spatial parameters for action veridically. Another strong claim of the model is that the dorsal stream’s control of action is designed for dealing with target stimuli in the ‘here and now’, yet when time is allowed to pass and a reaction {{has to be made}} on the basis of a visual memory, the ventral stream is required for successful performance. One prediction from this is that neglect patients should be able to perform immediate actions, but should present specific impairments when the action is delayed. In Part I of this thesis the pattern of spared and impaired visuomotor abilities in patients with neglect, as specifically predicted by the perception and action model (Milner & Goodale, 1995, 2006), was investigated. In Chapter 1, the performance of patients with and without neglect after right hemisphere stroke was compared with that of age-matched controls. Participants were asked to point either directly towards targets or halfway between two stimuli (gap bisection), both with and without visual feedback during movement. No neglect-specific impairment was found in timing, accuracy or reach trajectory measures in either pointing or gap bisection. In Chapter 2, I tested whether neglect patients would be unimpaired in immediate pointing, yet show inaccurate pointing in a condition where a delay is interposed between the presentation of the stimulus and the response signal. Similarly to Chapter 1, it was found that neglect patients showed no accuracy impairments when asked to perform an immediate action. Conversely, when pointing towards remembered leftward locations they presented specific accuracy deficits that correlated with neglect severity. Moreover, an initial voxel-based lesion-symptom analysis further revealed that these deficits were associated with damage to occipito-temporal areas which were also mostly damaged in the neglect group. Furthermore, training of grasping the <b>centre</b> of <b>rods</b> (visuomotor feedback training) has been shown to improve neglect (Robertson, Nico & Hood, 1997; Harvey et al., 2003). It is postulated that by using the spared visuomotor abilities in these patients it is possible to ‘bootstrap’ their perceptual deficits through some ‘dorsal-to-ventral recalibration’. Hence, in Part II the immediate and long-term effects of visuomotor feedback training were explored on neglect conventional measures, as well as in daily life tasks. I found that this technique improves neglect symptoms and crucially that these improvements were long lasting, as they were present even after 4 -months post-training. Importantly, I also show that the training effects generalize to the patient’s daily lives at follow-up. These findings are very encouraging for the rehabilitation of neglect as this condition has been shown to be the best single predictor of poor recovery after stroke and very difficult to treat.

5000|$|There were {{a number}} of issues with the Gresley gear. Because the {{conjugation}} apparatus was mounted {{at the opposite end of}} the valve spindles from the valve gear, as the valve spindles lengthened with the heat of steam in the cylinders the valve timing would be affected, and the gear would need to be removed before it was possible to remove valves for maintenance. However, the B17 Class [...] "Footballer"/"Sandringham" [...] 4-6-0s avoided this particular problem by being designed with the conjugated gear behind, rather than in front of, the cylinders. The main difficulty with this valve gear was that at high speeds, inertial forces caused the long conjugating lever to bend or [...] "whip". This had the effect of causing the middle cylinder to operate at a longer cutoff than the outer cylinders, therefore producing a disproportionate share of the total power output, leading to increased wear of the middle big end. Sustained high speed running could sometimes cause the big end to wear rapidly enough that the increased travel afforded to the middle piston by the increased play in the bearing was enough to knock the ends off the middle cylinder. This happened during the 113 mph run of [...] "Silver Fox". Although the problem could be contained in a peacetime environment with regular maintenance and inspections, it proved to be poorly suited to the rigors of heavy running and low maintenance levels of World War II. This gave rise to big-end problems on the <b>centre</b> cylinder connecting <b>rod</b> on the famous A4 class of streamlined Pacifics and many of these locomotives were fitted with a reduced diameter piston and had the inside cylinder sleeved down as a temporary measure. It should be noted that LNER Class A4 4468 Mallard suffered centre cylinder big-end damage (indicated to the driver by the fracture of a [...] "stink bomb" [...] attached to the bearing, which fractures during overheating of the white metal) during its world record run and was forced to limp back to its depot for repairs afterwards. Gresley's successor at the LNER, Edward Thompson, was critical of this particular valve gear. As well as introducing new two-cylinder designs, he set about rebuilding Gresley locomotives with separate sets of Walschaerts valve gear for each cylinder.Under later British Railways ownership, the application of former Great Western Railway workshop practices for precise alignment of the valve gear and in the manufacture and lubrication of the inside big end bearing effectively solved the problems.|$|R
40|$|Current fuel {{management}} strategies for light water reactors (LWRs), {{in countries with}} high back-end costs, progressively extend the discharge burnup {{at the expense of}} increasing the 235 U enrichment of the fresh UO 2 fuel loaded. In this perspective, standard non-destructive assay (NDA) techniques, which are very attractive because they are fast, cheap, and preserve the fuel integrity, in contrast to destructive approaches, require further validation when burnup values become higher than 50 GWd/t. This doctoral work has been devoted to the development and optimisation of non-destructive assay (NDA) techniques based on gamma-ray emissions from irradiated fuel. It represents an important extension of the unique, high-burnup related database, generated in the framework of the LWR-PROTEUS Phase II experiments. A novel tomographic measurement station has been designed and developed for the investigation of irradiated fuel rod segments. A unique feature of the station is that it allows both gamma-ray transmission and emission computerised tomography to be performed on single fuel rods. Four burnt UO 2 fuel rod segments of 400 mm length have been investigated, two with very high (52 GWd/t and 71 GWd/t) and two with ultra-high (91 GWd/t and 126 GWd/t) burnup. Several research areas have been addressed, as described below. The application of transmission tomography to spent fuel rods has been a major task, because of difficulties of implementation and the uniqueness of the experiments. The main achievements, in this context, have been the determination of fuel rod average material density (a linear relationship between density and burnup was established), fuel rod linear attenuation coefficient distribution (for use in emission tomography), and fuel rod material density distribution. The non-destructive technique of emission computerised tomography (CT) has been applied to the very high and ultra-high burnup fuel rod samples for determining their within-rod distributions of caesium and europium fission-product radionuclides. As indicated above, results provided by the transmission tomography measurements were employed in the emission tomography reconstruction phase, together with a calculated global efficiency matrix and input sinograms derived from the processing of measured projections. Different tomographic algorithms were tested and "tuned", on the basis of known test distributions, before being applied to the actual fuel rod measurements. Amongst the various possibilities, the Paraboloidal Surrogates Coordinate Ascent (PSCA) penalised likelihood method has been chosen for presentation of the final results, because it ensures high precision, especially in resolving the most difficult peripheral regions of the rods. The results of the emission tomography have indicated large central depressions in the caesium distributions, but of varying extent from sample to sample. Particularly interesting is the case of the 126 GWd/t sample, showing a very deep central depression (a factor of ∼ 2. 5 for 137 Cs, a factor of ∼ 3 for 134 Cs). Differences in the relative activity distributions of 137 Cs and 134 Cs have, in fact, been observed for all the samples. The depression of 134 Cs is more marked than that of 137 Cs, probably due to the different origins of the two isotopes. In contrast, the europium shows an almost flat distribution. In order to support the tomographically measured caesium distributions, the results of destructive chemical techniques applied on samples from the same fuel rod (126 GWd/t sample) were examined and found to show reasonably good agreement with the tomography, thus confirming the depressed distributions at the <b>centre</b> of the <b>rod.</b> In addition to the tomographic reconstructions, the present research has also investigated the possibility to use single isotope activities, and/or isotopic concentration ratios from 134 Cs, 137 Cs, and 154 Eu, as burnup indicators at very high and ultra-high burnups. The corresponding non-destructive measurements, performed using three different approaches, have been compared with chemical assays, as well as with reactor physics calculations (CASMO). Whereas the chemical results confirm the current gamma-spectroscopic measurements within uncertainties, the agreement between measurements and calculations is not satisfactory. It has been shown that certain indicators, well established for application at low and medium burnups, suffer a serious loss of reliability at high burnup. Nevertheless, the possibility of successfully employing other burnup monitors has been clearly highlighted. Considering that the overall effort required for the destructive chemical analysis of fuel samples is much greater, the current investigations have clearly demonstrated that non-destructive gamma spectrometry, in conjunction with corresponding transmission and emission tomography measurements, can indeed be considered a valid approach for characterising fuel burnup in the high/ultra-high range...|$|R
40|$|The {{safe and}} {{economic}} operation {{of nuclear power}} plants (NPPs) requires that the behaviour and performance of the fuel can be calculated reliably over its expected lifetime. This requires highly developed codes that treat the nuclear fuel in a general manner and which {{take into account the}} large number of influences on fuel behaviour, e. g. thermal, mechanical, chemical, etc. Although many mature fuel performance codes are in active use, there are still significant incentives to improve their predictive capability. One particular aspect is related to the strong trend of NPP operators to try and extend discharge burnups beyond current licensing limits. With increasing burnup, more and more fission events impact the material characteristics of the fuel, as well as the cladding, and significant restructuring can be observed in the fuel. At local burnups in excess of 60 - 75 MWd/kgU, the microstructure of nuclear fuel pellets differs markedly from the as fabricated structure. This "high burnup structure" (HBS) is characterised by three principal features: (1) low matrix xenon concentration, (2) sub-micron grains and (3) a high volume fraction of micrometer sized pores. The peculiar features of the HBS have resulted in a significant effort to understand the consequences for fuel performance and safety. In particular there is the concern that the large retention of fission gas within the HBS could lead to significant gas release at high burnups, either through the degradation of thermal conductivity or through direct release. While for the normal fuel microstructure numerous models, investigations and codes exist, only a few models for simulating ssion gas behaviour in the HBS have been developed. Consequently, in this context, {{it is fair to say}} that reliable mechanistic models are largely missing today. In line with this situation the present doctoral work has focussed on the development and evaluation of HBS fission gas transport models, with a view to improve upon the current gap in fuel performance modelling. In particular two features of the HBS have been focussed on, viz. the equilibrium xenon concentration in the matrix of the HBS in UO 2 fuel pellets, and the growth of the HBS porosity and its effect on fission gas release. In a first step a steady state fission gas model has been developed to examine the importance of grain boundary diffusion for the gas dynamics in the HBS. With this model it was possible to simulate the ≈ 0. 2 wt% experimentally observed xenon concentration under certain conditions, viz. fast grain boundary di usion and a reduced grain di usion coeficient. A sensitivity study has been conducted for the principal parameters of the model and it has been shown that the value of the grain boundary diffusion coeficient is not important for diffusion coeficient ratios in excess of ~ 104. Within this grain boundary diffusion saturation regime the model exhibits a high sensitivity to principally three other parameters: the grain diffusion coeficient, the bubble number density and the re-solution rate coeficient. In spite of such sensitivity it has been shown that the model can reproduce the observed HBS xenon depletion with the assumption that grain boundary diffusion of fission gas is significantly faster than lattice diffusion. In particular the results from this study have demonstrated that the release of produced gas from the grains to the HBS porosity corresponds to a dynamic equilibrium, providing a justification for the typical modelling approach used in HBS modelling, viz. fast transport to the porosity, which from a fuel performance modelling point of view largely simplifies the calculations. In a second step, a model describing the evolution of the HBS porosity under annealing conditions has been developed. The model was applied to a high burnup fuel annealing experiment to assess its predictions against measurements. Reasonable agreement was found with respect to the experimental release in the temperature range where the release mechanism was originally interpreted to be due to volume diffusion of the gaseous fission products. In contrast to the original analysis, the developed model interprets the release mechanism as being due to pore growth, coalescence and, ultimately, venting. The model results for annealing conditions have been compared with available PIE data and this comparison has indicated that, for burnups examined to date, most of the fission gas is expected to be retained within the HBS porosity. The model of porosity growth and venting developed for annealing conditions has then been extended to take into account the effect of irradiation on the defect population and accumulation of fission gas in the HBS porosity. The power history of a high burnup fuel rod from a Swiss NPP was used to model the local behaviour of the HBS and good agreement was found between the calculation of porosity growth and results from open literature. A comparison between the calculated local gas release was found to be consistent with both the observations from the annealing calculations and measurements performed on the same fuel rod using Laser Ablation Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS). To provide a more comprehensive analysis of the model predictions, a gas release correlation for calculating the release due to pore venting has been developed from the stand-alone in-pile modelling of porosity growth and this was implemented into the fuel performance code TRANSURANUS. The examined high burnup rod was modelled using the thus extended TRANSURANUS code so that the integral behaviour (rather than just the local HBS behaviour) could be calculated. The subsequent fuel performance analysis has revealed that venting from the HBS has a small effect on the integral fission gas release with the release increasing towards the pellet periphery. The principal effect of the HBS for the considered high-burnup irradiation is the presence of the high porosity, which increases the fuel centre temperatures and therefore the fission gas release from the <b>centre</b> of the <b>rod.</b> For the base case analysis 22 % of the integral fission gas was found to be released. However, this is less than the quantity measured by rod puncturing. To address this discrepancy several sensitivity studies have been performed to investigate as to where the additional fission gas release originates, specifically the fuel centre and/or the HBS zones in the pellet periphery. It has been shown from this sensitivity analysis that extra release from just one of these regions is unlikely to account for the discrepancy between measured and calculated fission gas release. It is more likely that the uncertainties for each of the individual regions, when considered together, could account for the observed integral release. In particular the presence of an athermal gas release from within the HBS has been explored in detail and it has been shown that, while significant release could occur, there is still significant retention. Previous examinations of fuel behaviour have assumed little to no release in the HBS; however it is clear from this work that at burnups as high as considered currently, the gas release does have a signi cant component coming from the pellet periphery...|$|R
