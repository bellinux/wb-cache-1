50|$|Though {{many people}} conceptualize images and {{diffraction}} patterns separately, they contain principally the same information. In the simplest approximation, {{the two are}} simply Fourier transforms of one another. Thus, the effects of beam precession on diffraction patterns also have significant effects on the <b>corresponding</b> <b>images</b> in the TEM. Specifically, the reduced dynamical intensity transfer between beams {{that is associated with}} PED results in reduced dynamical contrast in images collected during precession of the beam. This includes a reduction in thickness fringes, bend contours, and strain fields. While these features can often provide useful information, their suppression enables a more straightforward interpretation of diffraction contrast and mass contrast in images.|$|E

5000|$|The {{concept of}} using {{cross-correlation}} to measure shifts in datasets {{has been known}} for a long time, and it has been applied to digital images since at least the early 1970s. The present-day applications are almost innumerable and include image analysis, image compression, velocimetry, and strain estimation. Much early work in DIC in the field of mechanics was led by researchers at the University of South Carolina in the early 1980s and has been optimized and improved in recent years. Commonly, DIC relies on finding the maximum of the correlation array between pixel intensity array subsets on two or more <b>corresponding</b> <b>images,</b> which gives the integer translational shift between them. It is also possible to estimate shifts to a finer resolution than the resolution of the original images, which is often called [...] "subpixel" [...] registration because the measured shift is smaller than an integer pixel unit. For subpixel interpolation of the shift, there are other methods that do not simply maximize the correlation coefficient. An iterative approach {{can also be used to}} maximize the interpolated correlation coefficient by using nonlinear optimization techniques. The nonlinear optimization approach tends to be conceptually simpler, but as with most nonlinear optimization techniques , it is quite slow, and the problem can sometimes be reduced to a much faster and more stable linear optimization in phase space.|$|E
