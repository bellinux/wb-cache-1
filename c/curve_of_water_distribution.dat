40|$|The basic {{aim of the}} {{sprinkler}} irrigation method, as in other irrigation methods, is to apply irrigation water as uniformly {{as possible to the}} root zone. The uniform <b>distribution</b> <b>of</b> the applied <b>water</b> in {{sprinkler irrigation}} depends on factors such as sprinkler type, number and size of nozzles, arrangement of sprinklers, working pressure and the speed and direction of the wind. Sprinkler and lateral spacing should be determined by also taking the speed and direction of the wind into consideration. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the application limits and the <b>curves</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> <b>distribution</b> under different working pressures, spatial arrangement and nozzle diameters under field conditions of some irrigation sprinklers which are widely used in Turkey. The objective was to determine the most appropriate system arrangement by using a computer program called CATCH 3 D.

40|$|Graduation date: 1968 The study <b>of</b> <b>water</b> {{movement}} in unsaturated soils by using appropriate diffusion equations has attracted considerable attention in recent years. In this study, a numerical technique is developed for solving a generalized, dimensionless diffusion equation {{by the use}} of a digital. computer. Diffusivity and capillary conductivity equations derived by Brooks and Corey [2] have been used instead of measured data; thus, the dimensionless diffusion equation can be applied to many soils and many kinds of fluids. In this thesis, the diffusion equation has been solved for the one -dimensional, vertical case, where drainage was permitted from an initially saturated soil. Some dimensionless <b>curves</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> content <b>distribution</b> in soil profiles at various selected times are presented. Outflow data calculated as a function of time is also included. The computer solutions using the Brooks -Corey approximations seem to fit the experimental data very well. It therefore seems that the diffusion equation solved here is a satisfactory model for water {{movement in}} unsaturated soil. An ALGOL program is included in the Appendix...|$|R

40|$|A {{standard}} and/or improved GA, using a fixed-length genotype and crossover operation, {{have been}} widely used in science and engineering disciplines. It is well-known that the GA is robust in searching for the optimal combination of diameter and rehabilitation actions <b>of</b> <b>water</b> <b>distribution</b> systems but requires a large number of evaluations. A characteristic, which has been observed from the studies, is that the optimal solution of the design and rehabilitation <b>of</b> <b>water</b> <b>distribution</b> systems is located at the boundary of the feasible and infeasible regions of the search space. Previous research has not considered the sizing of pipe wall thicknesses and water hammer protection measures, which are always required in reality. In this research, first of all, the original messy genetic algorithm is applied to the optimisation of design and rehabilitation <b>of</b> <b>water</b> <b>distribution</b> systems. It has been found that the messy GA is more efficient and effective than the standard and improved GAs at solving the optimisation <b>of</b> <b>water</b> <b>distribution</b> systems, but it requires a huge initial population size. This has been overcome by introducing the fast messy GA. Secondly, a scheme of co-evolutionary and self-adaptive penalty has been proposed for the GA solving a constrained boundary optimisation problem. It is purposely designed to guide the GA to search the boundary of the feasible and infeasible regions of the search space. It has been shown that this approach is very effective and efficient for the optimisation <b>of</b> <b>water</b> <b>distribution</b> systems. Finally, the hydraulic network solver (EPANET) for steady state simulation has been incorporated into a transient model for simulation <b>of</b> <b>water</b> hammer in <b>water</b> <b>distribution</b> systems. A methodology for comprehensive optimisation of pipe diameters, pipe classes and surge tanks <b>of</b> the <b>water</b> <b>distribution</b> systems has been developed by carefully integrating the steady state hydraulic solver, the water hammer simulation model, the fast messy GA and the boundary search strategy.

To supply subscribers with good quality <b>of</b> <b>water</b> and to ensure continuity of service, the operators use <b>water</b> <b>distribution</b> networks (WDN). The main elements <b>of</b> <b>water</b> <b>distribution</b> network (WDN) are: pipes and valves. The work developed in this paper focuses on a <b>water</b> <b>distribution</b> network rehabilitation in the short and long term. Priorities for rehabilitation actions were defined and the information system consolidated, as well as decision-making. The reliability data were conjugated in decision making tools on <b>water</b> <b>distribution</b> network rehabilitation in a forecasting context. As the pipes are static elements and the valves are dynamic elements, a Bayesian network (static-dynamic) has been developed, which can help to predict the failure scenario regarding <b>water</b> <b>distribution.</b> A relationship between reliability and prioritization of rehabilitation actions has been investigated.

Results illustrate that uncertainties in future demands, pressure head requirements, and pipe roughness can have significant effects on the optimd network design and cost.
