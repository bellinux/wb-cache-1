40|$|Yeast prions e. g. [PSI+], [PIN+] and [URE 3] {{are similar}} to {{mammalian}} amyloids that cause neurodegenerative diseases. [PSI+] is the aggregated self-perpetuating (prion) isoform of Sup 35, a translation termination factor. The molecular chaperone Hsp 104 {{plays a crucial role}} in the maintenance and propagation of [PSI+]. Deletion of the GET 2 gene has been shown to cause a [PSI+] <b>curing</b> <b>defect</b> by excess Hsp 104 and [PSI+] instability on synthetic medium (S. Muller, J. Patterson and Y. Chernoff, unpublished data; and J. Patterson Honors Thesis). Get 2 is a membrane protein working in a complex with Get 1 and Get 3 proteins. This complex, called GET (Golgi-to-ER Traffic), is known to retrieve resident ER proteins from Golgi. In this particular study we provide further evidence for the connection between the GET pathway and yeast prions. The get 2 deletion also leads to a detectable loss of [PIN+] prion on synthetic medium. The role of the other two members of the Get complex in prion propagation is also explored. The levels and the activity of Hsp 104 in the get 2 mutants is analyzed. The size of [PSI+] aggregates in the get 2 Δ strain is compared to that found in wild type. Finally, other possible mechanisms for the effect of get 2 on prion maintenance and propagation are addressed. M. S.

This paper {{describes}} {{an investigation into}} the applicability of the acoustic emission (AE) and ultrasonic inspection (UT) technique for the monitoring of <b>cure</b> related <b>defects</b> in thick resin transfer moulded (RTM) products.

The results of the investigation suggest a relation between AE activity, UT gain level and the presence of <b>cure</b> related <b>defects</b> such as shrinkage cracks and porosity. A higher level of AE activity corresponds in general with a higher UT attenuation level and a lower quality of the RTM product. The results of the investigation were used to detail the influence of RTM material and process parameters such as resin type (tough, brittle) and heating rate during RTM processing. The results were further used to optimise the design of the RTM product mould. 1...|$|R

40|$|AbstractEddy current {{testing is}} well {{established}} for non-destructive testing of electrical conductive materials [1]. The development of radio frequency (RF) eddy current technology with frequency ranges up to 100  MHz {{made it possible to}} extend the classical fields of application even towards less conductive materials like CFRP [2][3](Table  2). It turns out that RF eddy current technology on CFRP generates a growing number of valuable information for comprehensive material diagnostic. Both permittivity and conductivity of CFRP influence the complex impedance measured with RF eddy current devices. The electrical conductivity contains information about fiber texture like orientations, gaps or undulations in a multilayered material. The permittivity characterization influenced by dielectric properties allows the determination of local <b>curing</b> <b>defects</b> on CFRP e. g. hot spots, thermal impacts or polymer degradation. An explanation for that effect is seen in the measurement frequency range and the capacitive structure of the carbon rovings. Using radio wave frequencies for testing, the effect of displacement currents cannot be neglected anymore. The capacitive structures formed by the carbon rovings is supposed to further strengthen the dielectric influences on eddy current measurement signal [3]. This report gives an overview of several realized applications and should be understood as a general introduction of CFRP testing by HF Radio Wave techniques...|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} {{self-contained}} framework called Direct Integration of the Relaxed Einstein Equations (DIRE) for calculating {{equations of motion}} and gravitational radiation emission for isolated gravitating systems based on the post-Newtonian approximation. We cast the Einstein equations into their "relaxed" form of a flat-spacetime wave equation together with a harmonic gauge condition, and solve the equations formally as a retarded integral over the past null cone of the field point (chosen to be within the near zone when calculating equations of motion, and in the far zone when calculating gravitational radiation). The "inner" part of this integral(within a sphere of radius R ∼ one gravitational wavelength) is approximated in a slow-motion expansion using standard techniques; the "outer" part, extending over the radiation zone, is evaluated using a null integration variable. We show generally and explicitly that all contributions to the inner integrals that depend on R cancel corresponding terms from the outer integrals, and that the outer integrals converge at infinity, subject only to reasonable assumptions about the past behavior of the source. The method <b>cures</b> <b>defects</b> that plagued previous "brute-force" slow-motion approaches to motion and gravitational radiation for isolated systems. We detail the procedure for iterating the solutions in a weak-field, slow-motion approximation, and derive expressions for the near-zone field through 3. 5 post-Newtonian order in terms of Poisson-like potentials.

40|$|We derive the {{gravitational}} waveform and gravitational-wave energy flux {{generated by a}} binary star system of compact objects (neutron stars or black holes), accurate through second post-Newtonian order (O[(v/c) ^ 4] ∼ O[(Gm/rc^ 2) ^ 2]) beyond the lowest-order quadrupole approximation. We cast the Einstein equations into {{the form of a}} flat-spacetime wave equation together with a harmonic gauge condition, and solve it formally as a retarded integral over the past null cone of the chosen field point. The part of this integral that involves the matter sources and the near-zone gravitational field is evaluated in terms of multipole moments using standard techniques; the remainder of the retarded integral, extending over the radiation zone, is evaluated in a novel way. The result is a manifestly convergent and finite procedure for calculating gravitational radiation to arbitrary orders in a post-Newtonian expansion. Through second post-Newtonian order, the radiation is also shown to propagate toward the observer along true null rays of the asymptotically Schwarzschild spacetime, despite having been derived using flat spacetime wave equations. The method <b>cures</b> <b>defects</b> that plagued previous "brute- force" slow-motion approaches to the generation of gravitational radiation, and yields results that agree perfectly with those recently obtained by a mixed post-Minkowskian post-Newtonian method. We display explicit formulae for {{the gravitational}} waveform and the energy flux for two-body systems, both in arbitrary orbits and in circular orbits.
