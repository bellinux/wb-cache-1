5000|$|The permethylated {{derivative}} of tren is also well known.

In prior work developing photocatalysts for water splitting, Lehn observed that Co(I) species were produced in solutions containing <b>CoCl2,</b> 2,2'-bipyridine (bpy), a tertiary amine, and a Ru(bpy)3Cl2 photosensitizer. The high affinity of CO2 to cobalt centers led both he and Ziessel to study cobalt centers as electrocatalysts for reduction. In 1982, they reported CO and H2 as products from the irradiation of a solution containing 700ml of CO2, Ru(bpy)3 and Co(bpy).|$|E
50|$|Acetyl {{chloride}} {{is produced}} in the laboratory by the reaction of acetic acid with chlorodehydrating agents such as PCl3, PCl5, SO2Cl2, or SOCl2. However, these methods usually gives acetyl chloride contaminated by phosphorus or sulfur impurities, which may interfere with the organic reactions. a route avoiding these impurities of phosphorus and sulphur is that of phosgene and acetic acid, <b>COCl2</b> + CH3COOH = CH3COCl + HCl + CO2. HCl impurities can be removed by distilling the crude product from dimethylaniline or by degassing the mixture by a stream of argon.|$|E
50|$|An aqueous {{solution}} of sodium silicate is acidified {{to produce a}} gelatinous precipitate that is washed, then dehydrated to produce colorless silica gel. When a visible indication of the moisture content of the silica gel is required, ammonium tetrachlorocobaltate(II) (NH4)2CoCl4 or cobalt chloride <b>CoCl2</b> is added. This will cause the gel to be blue when dry and pink when hydrated. An alternative indicator is methyl violet which is orange when dry and green when hydrated. Due to the connection between cancer and cobalt chloride, it has been forbidden in Europe on silica gel.|$|E
5000|$|In 1998, Paolo Strazzolini {{and others}} {{synthesized}} this compound by reacting oxalyl chloride (<b>COCl)2</b> or the bromide (COBr)2 with a suspension of silver oxalate (Ag2C2O4) in diethyl ether at −15 °C, followed by evaporation of the solvent at low temperature and pressure. The substance is stable when dissolved in ether and trichloromethane at −30 °C, but decomposes into a 1:1 mixture {{of carbon monoxide}} (CO) and carbon dioxide (CO2) upon heating to 0 °C. [...] The stability and conformation of the molecule were also analyzed by theoretical methods.|$|E
50|$|Carbon dioxide (CO2) can {{be reduced}} to carbon {{monoxide}} (CO) and other more reduced compounds, such as methane, using the appropriate photocatalysts. One early example was the use of Tris(bipyridine)ruthenium(II) chloride (Ru(bipy)3Cl2) and cobalt chloride (<b>CoCl2)</b> for CO2 reduction to CO. Many compounds that do similar reactions have since been developed, but they generally perform poorly with atmospheric concentrations of CO2, requiring further concentration. The simplest product from CO2 reduction is carbon monoxide (CO), but for fuel development, further reduction is needed, and a key step also needing further development is the transfer of hydride anions to CO.|$|E
50|$|The lateral {{line system}} is {{necessary}} to detect vibrations made by prey, and to orient towards the source to begin predatory action. Fish are able to detect movement, produced either by prey or a vibrating metal sphere, and orient themselves toward the source before proceeding to make a predatory strike at it. This behavior persists even in blinded fish, but is greatly diminished when lateral line function was inhibited by <b>CoCl2</b> application. Cobalt chloride treatment results in the release of cobalt ions, disrupting ionic transport and preventing signal transduction in the lateral lines. These behaviors are dependent specifically on mechanoreceptors located within the canals of the lateral line.|$|E
5000|$|In chemistry, {{trigonal}} planar is {{a molecular}} geometry model with one atom {{at the center}} and three atoms {{at the corners of}} an equilateral triangle, called peripheral atoms, all in one plane. In an ideal trigonal planar species, all three ligands are identical and all bond angles are 120°. Such species belong to the point group D3h. Molecules where the three ligands are not identical, such as H2CO, deviate from this idealized geometry. Examples of molecules with trigonal planar geometry include boron trifluoride (BF3), formaldehyde (H2CO), phosgene (<b>COCl2),</b> and sulfur trioxide (SO3). Some ions with trigonal planar geometry include nitrate (...) , carbonate (...) , and guanidinium (...) [...] In organic chemistry, planar, three-connected carbon centers that are trigonal planar are often described as having sp2 hybridization.|$|E
50|$|Co can be {{detected}} by laboratory blood analysis if the intake amount is greater than 400 μg per day. As the whole blood concentration is greater than 1 μg/L and the urinary concentration is greater than 10 μg/L after at least 10 days of administration. The dose, which increases the red blood cell production to approximately 16%-21%, is about 68 mg Co per day for at least 10 days of oral administration. The predicted whole blood concentration of cobalt exceeds 200 μg/L two hours after the last intake and the average urine concentrations of cobalt exceed 3000 μg/L within 24 hours of intake. A study was carried out where 23 subjects were to take 900 μg per day {{in the form of}} <b>CoCl2</b> for 10 days. The model predictions were then compared to the study. The result shows that the model prediction for blood and urine are between the median concentration of the male and female groups, which indicate the model predictions sufficiently represent the test population as a whole.|$|E
50|$|More potent for use {{in blood}} doping is Co2+ (administered as Cobalt(II) {{chloride}}, <b>CoCl2).</b> Cobalt chloride {{has been known to}} be useful in treating anemic patients. Recent experimental evidence has proved the efficacy of cobalt chloride in blood doping. Studies into the action of this species have shown that Co2+ induces hypoxia like responses, the most relevant response being erythropoiesis. Co2+ induces this response by binding to the N-terminus (loop helix loop domain) of the Hypoxia inducing transcription factors HIF-1α and HIF-2α, and thus stabilizes these protein complexes. Under normal O2 conditions, HIFs are destabilized as proline and asparagine residues are hydroxylated by HIF-α hydroxylases, these unstable HIFs are subsequently degraded following a ubiquitin-proteosome pathway, as such, they cannot then bind and activate transcription of genes encoding Erythropoietin (EPO). With Co2+ stabilization, degradation is prevented and genes encoding EPO can then be activated. The mechanism for this Co2+ N terminus stabilization is not yet fully understood. In addition to N-terminus binding, it has also been hypothesized that replacement of Fe2+ by Co2+ in the hydroxylase active site could be a contributing factor to the stabilizing action of Co2+. It is understood however, is that Co2+ binding permits Ubiquitin binding but prevents proteosomal degradation.|$|E
40|$|Since it was {{suggested}} that cobalt chloride (<b>CoCl(2))</b> could mimic the O(2) sensing role of mitochondria by increasing reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation during normoxia, we studied the correlation between <b>CoCl(2)</b> -generation of free radicals and the induction of a hypoxic cellular response in myogenic cell lines. In both L 6 C 5 and C 2 C 12 cell lines, exposure to <b>CoCl(2)</b> induced an increase of intracellular oxidants, the accumulation of HIF- 1 alpha protein, and the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and/or iNOS genes. On the other hand, only ascorbic acid, but not trolox, was effective in lowering the <b>CoCl(2)</b> gene up-regulation. Neither the cytotoxicity nor the apoptosis induced by <b>CoCl(2)</b> in skeletal muscle cells were modified by culture supplementation with either ascorbic acid or trolox. Thus, <b>CoCl(2)</b> treatment of myogenic cell lines may represent a useful and convenient in vitro model to study gene modulation induced by hypoxia in skeletal muscle, although cellular loss induced by this metal may involve mechanisms other than HIF- 1 alpha stabilization. It is unlikely, however, that ROS would represent the main mediators of <b>CoCl(2)</b> effects on muscle cells...|$|E
40|$|Hydrogen sulfide (H(2) S) {{has been}} shown to protect against {{oxidative}} stress injury and inflammation in various hypoxia-induced insult models. However, it remains unknown whether H(2) S protects human skin keratinocytes (HaCaT cells) against chemical hypoxia-induced damage. In the current study, HaCaT cells were treated with cobalt chloride (<b>CoCl(2)),</b> a well known hypoxia mimetic agent, to establish a chemical hypoxia-induced cell injury model. Our findings showed that pretreatment of HaCaT cells with NaHS (a donor of H(2) S) for 30 min before exposure to <b>CoCl(2)</b> for 24 h significantly attenuated <b>CoCl(2)</b> -induced injuries and inflammatory responses, evidenced by increases in cell viability and GSH level and decreases in ROS generation and secretions of IL- 1 β, IL- 6 and IL- 8. In addition, pretreatment with NaHS markedly reduced <b>CoCl(2)</b> -induced COX- 2 overexpression and PGE(2) secretion as well as intranuclear NF-κB p 65 subunit accumulation (the central step of NF-κB activation). Similar to the protective effect of H(2) S, both NS- 398 (a selective COX- 2 inhibitor) and PDTC (a selective NF-κB inhibitor) depressed not only <b>CoCl(2)</b> -induced cytotoxicity, but also the secretions of IL- 1 β, IL- 6 and IL- 8. Importantly, PDTC obviously attenuated overexpression of COX- 2 induced by <b>CoCl(2).</b> Notably, NAC, a ROS scavenger, conferred a similar protective effect of H(2) S against <b>CoCl(2)</b> -induced insults and inflammatory responses. Taken together, the findings of the present study have demonstrated {{for the first time that}} H(2) S protects HaCaT cells against <b>CoCl(2)</b> -induced injuries and inflammatory responses through inhibition of ROS-activated NF-κB/COX- 2 pathway...|$|E
40|$|This study {{demonstrates}} that the Rho-kinase (ROCK) inhibitor, Y- 27632, potentiates not only the effect of cobalt chloride (<b>CoCl(2))</b> but also that of deferoxamine, another HIF- 1 inducer, on mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) neuronal differentiation. HIF- 1 is essential for <b>CoCl(2)</b> +/-Y- 27632 -induced MSC neuronal differentiation, since agents inhibiting HIF- 1 abolish the changes of morphology and cell cycle arrest-related gene or protein expressions (p 21, cyclin D 1) and the increase of neuronal marker expressions (Tuj 1, NSE). Y- 27632 potentiates the <b>CoCl(2)</b> -induced decrease of cyclin D 1 and nestin expressions, the increase of HIF- 1 activation and EPO expression, and decreases pVHL expression. Interestingly, <b>CoCl(2)</b> decreases RhoA expression, an effect potentiated by Y- 27632, revealing crosstalk between HIF- 1 and RhoA/ROCK pathways. Moreover, we demonstrate a synergistic effect of <b>CoCl(2)</b> and Y- 27632 on neurosphere differentiation into neurons and PC 12 neurite outgrowth underlining that a co-treatment targeting both HIF- 1 and ROCK pathways might be relevant to differentiate stem cells into neurons...|$|E
