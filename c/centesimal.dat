2500|$|Three main {{logarithmic}} potency {{scales are}} in regular use in homeopathy. Hahnemann created the [...] "centesimal" [...] or [...] "C scale", diluting a substance {{by a factor}} of 100 at each stage. The <b>centesimal</b> scale was favoured by Hahnemann for most of his life.|$|E
2500|$|Since the 19th century, the {{scientific}} and thermometry communities worldwide referred to this scale as the centigrade scale. Temperatures on the centigrade scale were often reported simply as degrees or, when greater specificity was desired, as degrees centigrade (symbol: °C). [...] Because the term centigrade was also the Spanish and French language name for a unit of angular measurement (1/100 of a right angle) and had a similar connotation in other languages, the term <b>centesimal</b> degree (known as the gradian, [...] "grad" [...] or [...] "gon": 1ᵍ = 0.9°, 100ᵍ = 90°) was used when very precise, unambiguous language was required by international standards bodies such as the BIPM. More properly, what was defined as [...] "centigrade" [...] then would now be [...] "hectograde". [...] Furthermore, in the context here, centigrade/hectograde is referring to the whole 0–100 range, not the given part thereof, hence [...] "20° centigrade" [...] means [...] "20ᵍ per 100 gradians" [...] (or 20% hectograde), not its literal description, [...] "0.2 gradians".|$|E

60|$|The {{range of}} all {{possible}} relationships in respect to whorls, would consequently lie between a percentage frequency of the minimum 14 and the maximum 31, while the observed frequency is of the intermediate value of 26. Subtracting the 14 from these three values, we have the series of 0, 12, 17. These terms can be converted into their equivalents in a <b>centesimal</b> scale that reaches from 0° to 100° instead of from 0° to 17°, by the ordinary rule of three, 12:x::17:100; x=70 or 71, whence the value x of the observed relationship on the <b>centesimal</b> scale would be 70° or 71°, neglecting decimals.|$|E

60|$|Let us now {{endeavour}} {{to measure}} {{the relationships between the}} various couplets of digits on a well-defined <b>centesimal</b> scale, first recalling the fundamental principles of the connection that subsists between relationships of all kinds, whether between digits, or between kinsmen, or between any of those numerous varieties of related events with which statisticians deal.|$|E
6000|$|... 276. But more forcible and {{striking}} evidence is afforded by experiments made in mines of great depth. Between 60 ft. and 80 ft. down, {{the temperature of}} the earth is, I believe, the same at all times and in all places; and below this depth it gradually increases. Near Bex, in the Valais, there is a perpendicular shaft 677 ft. deep, or about 732 ft. English, with water at the bottom, the temperature of which was ascertained by Saussure. He does not tell us whether he used Réaumur's or the <b>centesimal</b> thermometer; but the result of his experiment was this:--In a lateral gallery, connected with the main shaft, but deserted, and, therefore, unaffected by breath or the heat of lamps, at 321 ft. 10 in. below the surface, {{the temperature of the}} water and the air was exactly the same, 11-1/2°; or, if the <b>centesimal</b> thermometer was used, 52-4/5 Fahr.; if Réaumur's, 57-7/8 Fahr.|$|E
60|$|Table V. {{tells us}} that the {{percentage}} of whorls in the right ring-finger is 45, and in the left ring-finger 31. Table VIa {{tells us that}} the percentage of the double event of a whorl occurring on both the ring-fingers of the same person is 26. It is required to express the relationship between the right and left ring-fingers on a <b>centesimal</b> scale, in which 0° shall stand for no relationship at all, and 100° for the closest possible relationship.|$|E
60|$|The chief novelty in {{this chapter}} {{is an attempt to}} {{classify}} nearness of relationship upon a <b>centesimal</b> scale, in which the number of correspondences due to mere chance counts as 0°, and complete identity as 100°. It seems reasonable to adopt the scale with only slight reservation, when the average numbers of the Arches, Loops, and Whorls are respectively the same in the two kinds of digit which are compared together; but when they differ greatly, there are no means free from objection, of determining the 100° division of the scale; so the results, if noted at all, are subject to grave doubt.|$|E
60|$|Table XXVI. {{gives the}} results of {{applying}} the <b>centesimal</b> scale to the measurement of the average closeness of fraternal resemblance, in respect to finger prints, according to the method and under the reservations already explained in page 125. The average value thus assigned to {{it is a little}} more than 10°. The values obtained from the three fingers severally, from which that average was derived, are 9°, 10°, and 12°; they agree together better than might have been expected. The value obtained from a set of fifty additional couplets of the middle fingers only, of fraternals, is wider, being 21°. Its inclusion with the rest raises the average of all to between 10 and 11.|$|E
60|$|The second {{method of}} {{comparing}} two statistical groups, to which I alluded {{in the last}} paragraph but one, consists in stating the <b>centesimal</b> grade in the one group that corresponds with the median or any other fractional grade in the other. This, it will be remarked, is a very simple method of comparison, absolutely independent of any theory, and applicable to any statistical groups whatever, whether of physical or of mental qualities. Wherever we can sort in order, there we can apply this method. Thus, in the above examples, suppose A and B had been selected because they were equal when compared together, then we can concisely express {{the relative merits of}} the two classes to which they respectively belong, by saying that 16°.6 in the one is equal to 50° (the median) in the other.|$|E
6000|$|We {{are often}} called upon to define the {{position}} of an individual in his own series, in which case it is most conformable to usage to give his <b>centesimal</b> grade--that is, his place on the base line AB--supposing it to be graduated from 0° to 100°. In reckoning this, a confusion ought to be avoided between [...] "graduation" [...] and [...] "rank," [...] though it leads to no sensible error in practice. The first of the [...] "park palings" [...] does not stand at A, which is 0°, nor does the hundredth stand at B, which is 100°, for that would make 101 of them: but they stand at 0°.5 and 99°.5 respectively. Similarly, all intermediate ranks stand half a degree short of the graduation bearing the same number. When the class is large, the value of half a place becomes extremely small, and the rank and graduation may be treated as identical.|$|E
6000|$|If no {{relationship}} should exist, there would nevertheless {{be a certain}} percentage of instances, due to pure chance, of the double event of whorls occurring in both ring-fingers, and it is easy to calculate their frequency from the above data. The number of possible combinations of 100 right ring-fingers with 100 left ones is 100 × 100, and of these 45 × 31 would be double events as above (call these for brevity [...] "double whorls"). Consequently the chance of a double whorl in any single couplet is (45×31)/(100×100), and their average frequency in 100 couplets,--in other words, their average percentage is (45×31)/100 = 13·95, say 14. If, then, the observed percentage of double whorls should be only 14, it would be a proof that the A. L. W. classes of patterns on the right and left ring-fingers were quite independent; so their relationship, as expressed on the <b>centesimal</b> scale, would be 0°. There could never be less than 14 double whorls under the given conditions, except through some statistical irregularity.|$|E

6000|$|The first {{preliminary}} {{experiments were}} made {{with the help of}} the Arch-Loop-Whorl classification, on the same principle as that already described and utilised in Chapter VIII., with the following addition. Each of the two members of any couplet of fingers has a distinctive name--for instance, the couplet may consist of a finger and a thumb: or again, if it should consist of two fore-fingers, one will be a right fore-finger and the other a left one, but the two brothers in a couplet of brothers rank equally as such. The plan was therefore adopted of [...] "ear-marking" [...] the prints of the first of the two brothers that happened to come to hand, with an A, and that of the second brother with a B; and so reducing the questions to the shape:--How often does the pattern on the finger of a B brother agree with that on the corresponding finger of an A brother? How often would it occur between two persons who had no family likeness? How often would it correspond if the kinship between A and B were as close as it is possible to conceive? Or transposing the questions, and using the same words as in Chapter VIII., what is the relative frequency of (1) Random occurrences, (2) Observed occurrences, (3) Utmost possibilities? It was shown in that chapter how to find the value of (2) upon a <b>centesimal</b> scale in which [...] "Randoms" [...] ranked as 0° and [...] "Utmost possibilities" [...] as 100°.|$|E
6000|$|The {{eleventh}} chapter treats of Heredity, and affirmatively {{answers the}} question whether patterns are transmissible by descent. The inquiry proved more troublesome than was expected, {{on account of the}} great variety in patterns and the consequent rarity with which the same pattern, other than the common Loop, can be expected to appear in relatives. The available data having been attacked both by the Arch-Loop-Whorl method, and by a much more elaborate system of classification--described and figured as the C system, the resemblances between children of either sex, of the same parents (or more briefly [...] "fraternal" [...] resemblances, as they are here called, {{for want of a better}} term), have been tabulated and discussed. A batch of twins have also been analysed. Then cases have been treated in which both parents had the same pattern on corresponding fingers; this pattern was compared with the pattern on the corresponding finger of the child. In these and other ways, results were obtained, all testifying to the conspicuous effect of heredity, and giving results that can be measured on the <b>centesimal</b> scale already described. But though the qualitative results are clear, the quantitative are as yet not well defined, and that part of the inquiry must lie over until a future time, when I shall have more data and when certain foreseen improvements in the method of work may perhaps be carried out. There is a decided appearance, first observed by Mr. F. Howard Collins, of whom I shall again have to speak, of the influence of the mother being stronger than that of the father, in transmitting these patterns.|$|E

5000|$|Several potency {{scales are}} {{in use in}} homeopathy. Hahnemann created the <b>centesimal</b> or [...] "C scale", {{diluting}} a substance {{by a factor of}} 100 at each stage. The <b>centesimal</b> scale was favored by Hahnemann for most of his life. A 2C dilution requires a substance to be diluted to one part in one hundred, and then some of that diluted solution diluted by a further factor of one hundred. This works out to one part of the original substance in 10,000 parts of the solution.A 6C dilution repeats this process six times, ending up with the original material diluted by a factor of 100−6=10−12. Higher dilutions follow the same pattern. In homeopathy, a solution that is more dilute is described as having a higher potency, and more dilute substances are considered by homeopaths to be stronger and deeper-acting. The end product is often so diluted that it is indistinguishable from the dilutant (pure water, sugar or alcohol).|$|E

An even more remarkable issue from a metrological point of view is one that I interpret as a dual-denominated decimal/uncial series, overstruck on earlier post semi-libral bronzes, while a similar, but slightly lighter issue seems tariffed /X or 11 centismae, both dateable to about 200 BC.|$|E
