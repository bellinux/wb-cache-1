30|$|After cooking, {{the pulp}} and the spent liquor (black liquor) are {{discharged}} {{at the bottom}} of the digester at reduced pressure into a blow tank. Insufficiently cooked large-size rejects (knots) are screened and generally transported again to the digester for repeated cooking. The spent liquor is removed after <b>countercurrent</b> <b>washing</b> of the pulp and further processed within the recovery line. The pulp is further screened, cleaned, sometimes mildly refined, and thickened. Finally, the pulp can be stored, directed to bleaching, or directed to paper production systems [19].|$|E
40|$|A sulfuric-acid solvent-treatment {{process was}} {{developed}} in the pilot plant for the removal of residual uranium from stripped TBP-hexane prior to carbonate treatment. Three theoretical stages of <b>countercurrent</b> <b>washing</b> with 10 % Hb 2 sSOb 4 s were required to reduce the uranium concentration to less than 0. 01 g/ 1. This result can be accomplished with 7 pumper-decanter units or by 3 electrostatic mixer-settlers. Operated for the U. S. Atomic Energy Commission under contract no. W- 14 - 108 -Eng- 8.

40|$|A {{modified}} {{form of the}} Power Reactor and Nuclear Fuel Development Corporation (PNC) {{process for}} the aqueous preparation of uranium tetra-fluoride from Australian Rum Jungle leach liquor was investigated. The commercially available tertiary amine mixture, Alamine- 336, was substituted for the more costly tri-n-octylamine in the amine purification section of the process; the extraction was examined by batch simulation of the <b>countercurrent</b> extraction, <b>washing</b> and stripping stages. Alternative methods for reducing hexavalent uranium to the tetravalent state were examined and results {{on the use of}} powdered iron were encouraging. The use of hydrogen reduction appeared even more promising...|$|R
40|$|In the {{informal}} settlements of eThekwini municipality, South Africa, laundry activities are typically undertaken at local standpipes and washbasins of community ablution blocks (CABs), and are characterised by {{high levels of}} water consumption and greywater production. Since greywater contains a high pollution load, including sodium tripolyphosphate, it poses a significant environmental and public health risk. The overall objective {{of this study was}} to develop and test a water-efficient laundry system designed for informal settlements. Initial fieldwork at a standpipe and CAB in eThekwini municipality showed respectively 56 and 58 % of users were in favour of a water-efficient laundry system based upon sharing washing water. Subsequent laboratory work assessed crosscurrent and <b>countercurrent</b> cascades for <b>washing</b> clothes. Under optimised washing conditions at a detergent dose of 5 g/kg water, specific water consumption of 5 kg water/kg clothes and three rinsing phases it was determined that the countercurrent method wasted 33 % less water. Thus the countercurrent cascade has great potential for minimising greywater production in South African informal settlements. Future work should concentrate on evaluating greywater production, detergent usage and social acceptability in the field...|$|R
