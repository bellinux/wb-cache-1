40|$|Abstract—Many {{algorithms}} {{exploiting the}} signal cyclostationarity {{have been shown}} to be effective in performing antenna array beamforming. However, these algorithms can not provide a unique weight vector for simultaneously extracting multiple signals of interest (SOIs) with distinct cycle frequencies (DCFs). They also suffer from severe performance degradation in the presence of a cycle frequency error (CFE). To simultaneously accommodate multiple SOIs with DCFs and alleviate the effects of cycle leakage due to finite data samples, we propose a <b>cyclic</b> <b>sample</b> matrix inversion (C-SMI) beamformer. To make the C-SMI beamformer robust against CFE, we present a novel objective function which is optimized by using a steepest-descent based algorithm to find the appropriate estimates of the true DCFs.

The big data problems due to {{large number of}} data points or large number of features in each data point, or both, the training of models have become very slow. The training time has two major components: Time to access the data and time to process the data. In this paper, we have proposed one possible solution to handle the big data problems in machine learning. The focus is on reducing the training time through reducing data access time by proposing systematic sampling and cyclic/sequential sampling to select mini-batches from the dataset. To prove the effectiveness of proposed sampling techniques, we have used Empirical Risk Minimization, which is commonly used machine learning problem, for strongly convex and smooth case. The problem has been solved using SAG, SAGA, SVRG, SAAG-II and MBSGD (Mini-batched SGD), each using two step determination techniques, namely, constant step size and backtracking line search method.

The dilute solution properties, such as intrinsic viscosity ([η]), of the resulting cyclic polymers were routinely examined using GPC coupled with a triple detecting (light scattering/differential viscometer/differential refractometer) system to obtain the Mark-Houwink-Sukurada plot and the elution volume vs time. As shown in Table 1, MW was not proportional to the catalyst loading ([M/Ru] 0) as a result of poor initiation. Interestingly, all types of cyclic polymers tested were found to have lower dn/dc values than their linear analogues, but dn/dc decreased as [M/Ru] 0 decreased (Table 1). On the other hand, linear polymers prepared using different [M/Ru] 0 had very similar dn/dc values.

Assuming that the corresponding uniformly sampled signal satisfies the Nyquist sampling criterion, the sequence obtained via CNUS {{can be passed}} through a reconstructor to recover the missing uniform-grid samples. In order to recover the missing uniform-grid samples, the sequence obtained via CNUS is passed through a reconstructor. At present, these reconstructors have very high design and implementation complexity that offsets the gains obtained due to sub-Nyquist sampling. In this paper, we propose a scheme that reduces the design and implementation complexity of the  reconstructor. In contrast to the existing reconstructors which use only a multi-channel synthesis filter bank (FB), the proposed reconstructor utilizes both analysis and synthesis FBs which makes it feasible to achieve an order-of-magnitude reduction of the complexity. The analysis filters are implemented using polyphase networks whose branches are allpass filters with distinct fractional delays and phase shifts. In order to reduce both the design and the implementation complexity of the  synthesis FB, the synthesis filters are implemented using a cosine-modulated FB.
