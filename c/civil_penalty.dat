40|$|Federal {{antitrust}} law currently lacks one potentially useful remedy - <b>civil</b> <b>penalties.</b> <b>Civil</b> <b>penalties</b> are not novel, of course. They {{are used in}} other areas of federal economic regulation, in antitrust enforcement in other countries (particularly in Europe), and in a number of state antitrust systems. They have occasionally been proposed for U. S. {{antitrust law}}, although the Antitrust Modernization Commission and current federal enforcers have dismissed the idea. In this paper I review what constitutes a civil penalty; describe the use of <b>civil</b> <b>penalties</b> by the European Commission, the states, and the FTC; and discuss the three potential remedial functions of <b>civil</b> <b>penalties.</b> I then argue for adding <b>civil</b> <b>penalties</b> to federal antitrust law, but my proposal is a limited one. I would add civil fines (but not other <b>civil</b> <b>penalties),</b> only for Section 2 cases (but not for Section 1 cases, despite some instances where they might be useful), and only for two types of monopolization - cases of systemic conduct, like Microsoft, and cases where there is no economic justification for the defendant 2 ̆ 7 s monopolizing conduct, for example, fraud on the Patent Office. I also propose that civil fining authority be given both to the Justice Department and the FTC, and that the civil fines not be paid to the Treasury, but be recycled to the agencies to support their enforcement budgets...|$|R

Both of these forms of raptus had a <b>civil</b> <b>penalty</b> and possible excommunication for the family and village receiving the abducted woman, although raptus violentiae also incurred punishments of mutilation or death.|$|E

For the alleged Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) violation for failure to immediately notify the National Response Center of the chlorine release, Norfolk Southern will pay a penalty of $32,500, to be deposited in the Hazardous Substance Superfund. Under the terms of the agreement, Norfolk Southern will provide incident command system training to environmental and transportation personnel; stock nearby Langley Pond with at least 3,000 fish to replace fish killed by the chlorine spill; and post the telephone number for the National Response Center to facilitate spill reporting. Further, the settlement includes a supplemental environmental project (SEP) valued at $100,000 to plant vegetation along the banks of Horse Creek to decrease erosion and sedimentation, thereby improving water quality in Horse Creek.|$|E
