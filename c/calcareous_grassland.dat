40|$|This paper {{seeks to}} {{determine}} whether N-deposition has {{a negative impact on}} the species richness of <b>calcareous</b> <b>grasslands</b> at a European wide scale. [br/] • 100 <b>calcareous</b> <b>grasslands</b> across the Atlantic region of Europe were sampled in one season. Species composition and richness of vegetation communities were compared to some key environmental drivers (climate and N deposition) indirectly estimated via surrogates (latitude, longitude, N concentration in bryophyte tissue). [br/] • There are marked differences in species composition across the <b>calcareous</b> <b>grasslands</b> of the Atlantic biogeographic zone within Europe. Contrasts in mean species richness between regions are also detectable at a European wide scale. These natural gradients may mask any footprint of N deposition on vegetation at a European-wide scale. [br/] • For grasslands located along the western range of distribution, there are indications of a decline in species richness as N concentration in moss increases. This suggests that N deposition may be reducing biodiversity in <b>calcareous</b> <b>grasslands</b> at a wide scale, but that this impact can only be detected at the regional, rather than cross-European, level.

As the demand for arable land in Britain declined, some areas were returned to grassland, but the use of fertilisers and herbicides has reduced its biodiversity. Grazing by rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus), sheep (Ovis aries) and cattle (Bos taurus) maintains the grassland habitat.|$|E

40|$|The {{restoration}} of <b>calcareous</b> <b>grasslands</b> in Europe: {{a review of}} constraints and solutions. <b>Calcareous</b> <b>grasslands</b> that are considered as biodiversity hotspots in Europe, have suffered an important decline during the last century. In this context, {{restoration of}} suitable habitats has been promoted as a conservation strategy. Restoration consists in the recreation of favorable abiotic and biotic conditions that permit the recolonization by typical species. Depending on the degradations, several constraints can be encountered during restoration, such as soil enrichment, the presence of competitive species, or harsh conditions for plant growth. In order to overcome these constraints, scientists have proposed techniques that were demonstrated to {{be more or less}} efficient. In this article, the different constraints that can occur while restoring <b>calcareous</b> <b>grasslands</b> are described as well as the techniques proposed in the scientific literature. We also describe restoration objectives specific to <b>calcareous</b> <b>grasslands,</b> taking the history of these habitats into account and considering global change issue. Different parameters can be considered to value restoration success. Here again, an analysis of the scientific literature is needed in order to best assess restoration monitoring...|$|R

40|$|Cotoneaster horizontalis DECAISNE, a Rosaceae {{coming from}} Asia, was {{introduced}} in Belgium as an ornamental species. Different sides of the invasion were studied, from {{the distribution of the}} species and the invasion status, the impacts, to management methods. To describe the invasion status, information was gathered about the occurrence and the distribution of the species in Belgium by compiling various databases. The naturalization status in <b>calcareous</b> <b>grasslands,</b> high-value habitats recognized as biodiversity hotspots, was assessed. Occurrence, population status, preferred habitats, invaded communities, growth rate and fruiting capacity were characterized. Once naturalization established, we investigated its impacts on <b>calcareous</b> <b>grasslands</b> communities, individual species and pollinators. C. horizontalis occurred in seven of the nine studied <b>calcareous</b> <b>grasslands,</b> with densities from 0. 34 to 10 individuals/ha. In the most invaded sites, an ongoing colonization process was suggested by a high proportion of small individuals. Moreover, 3 -year-old individuals already showed fruiting capacities. Germination rate reached about 30 %. Significant impacts on habitat structure and vegetation were showed. Community structure and composition changes were demonstrated in invaded sites by decreasing species richness and diversity. As <b>calcareous</b> <b>grasslands</b> are priority Natura 2000 habitats, measures must be taken to control the spread of C. horizontalis. For this purpose, we performed management tests to identify the most efficient techniques that would help the restoration of <b>calcareous</b> <b>grasslands.</b> Both mechanical and chemical management techniques were tested. Methods choice was driven by the environmental constraints of <b>calcareous</b> <b>grasslands,</b> which require highly selective techniques, and by species characteristics. Tested methods were cuttings, stump burning, spraying, cutting plus glyphosate application on stump and glyphosate application on stem basis. Efficiency, cost, feasibility and side-effects on ecosystems were estimated. Management tests are still ongoing but some results have already been drawn: spraying and single cutting are not efficient, the last one generating production of numerous sprouts. Finding the best management method will not be sufficient to stop the invasion. C. horizontalis is still present in 53 % of the sale catalogs of horticulturists in Southern Belgium. As long as the species is used in the vicinity of <b>calcareous</b> <b>grasslands,</b> propagules are continuously provided, jeoparding management actions...|$|R
5|$|Cheddar Wood and {{the smaller}} Macall's Wood form a {{biological}} Site of Special Scientific Interest from {{what remains of the}} wood of the Bishops of Bath and Wells in the 13thcentury and of King Edmund the Magnificent's wood in the 10th. During the 19thcentury, its lower fringes were grubbed out to make strawberry fields. Most of these have been allowed to revert to woodland. The wood was coppiced until 1917. This site compromises a wide range of habitats which include ancient and secondary semi-natural broadleaved woodland, unimproved neutral grassland, and a complex mosaic of <b>calcareous</b> <b>grassland</b> and acidic dry dwarf-shrub heath. Cheddar Wood is one of only a few English stations for starved wood-sedge (Carex depauperata). Purple gromwell (Lithospermum purpurocaeruleum), a nationally rare plant, also grows in the wood. Butterflies include silver-washed fritillary (Argynnis paphia), dark green fritillary (Argynnis aglaja), pearl-bordered fritillary (Boloria euphrosyne), holly blue (Celastrina argiolus) and brown argus (Aricia agestis). The slug Arion fasciatus, which has a restricted distribution in the south of England, and the soldier beetle Cantharis fusca also occur.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT. — <b>Calcareous</b> <b>grasslands</b> are {{biodiversity}} hotspots in Western Europe. In Belgium, {{a number}} of phytosociological surveys have been realized in these habitats, but none covers {{the whole range of}} <b>calcareous</b> <b>grasslands</b> at the regional scale. The aim of this study was (i) to provide a synthesis of the floristic variation of <b>calcareous</b> <b>grasslands</b> of the Calestienne natural region using a uniform methodology; (ii) to relate floristic variation to environmental variables, and (iii) to characterize the specific diversity of the different grassland communities that occur in the study region. Seven different communities were identified with the TWINSPAN method. The originality of the <b>grasslands</b> on <b>calcareous</b> and calcareo-siliceous rocks was statistically confirmed. Significant differences for environmental variables were identified among the seven communities by a MANOVA. Main differences between communities were related to xericity and pH, although a north-south gradient was also identified. More xeric grasslands were located {{in the southern part of}} the study region while northern part was occupied by more mesophilous grasslands. Multiple regressions were used to describe the influence of the environmental conditions on plant species richness. The most mesophilous grasslands appeared to be the most species-rich while soil acidity negatively affected species richness.
