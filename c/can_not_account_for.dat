50|$|Trakakis also {{maintains}} {{that some of}} the major theodicies that have been offered by theists (e.g., the free will theodicy, the soul-making theodicy) fail to explain why God would permit various types of evil, particularly 'natural evil' or suffering brought about by natural processes (e.g., natural disasters). However, he does believe that the free-will theodicy may succeed in explaining at least some kinds of moral evil.

50|$|There {{is strong}} {{evidence}} that the retinal ganglion cell theory is untenable.

Lateral inhibition theory also <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>account</b> <b>for</b> the fact that the Hermann grid illusion is perceived over a range of bar widths. Lateral inhibition theory would predict that decreasing the size of the grid (and therefore decreasing the amount of inhibition at the intersection) would eradicate the illusory effect.

50|$|One {{suggestion}} is that pathogens were transmitted by the expanding humans via the domesticated dogs they brought with them. Unfortunately for such a theory it <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>account</b> <b>for</b> several major extinction events, notably Australia and North America. Dogs did not arrive in Australia until approximately 35,000 {{years after the first}} humans arrived and approximately 30,000 years after the megafaunal extinction was complete and as such can not be implicated. In contrast numerous species including wolves, mammoths, camelids and horses had emigrated continually between Asia and North America over the past 100,000 years. For the disease hypothesis to be applicable {{in the case of the}} Americas it would require that the population remain immunologically naive despite this constant transmission of genetic and pathogenic material.|$|E
50|$|Another {{method that}} fuel-users control quality is {{by using the}} cetane index (CI), which is a {{calculated}} number based on the density and distillation range of the fuel. There are various versions of this, depending on whether metric or Imperial units are used, and how many distillation points are used. These days most oil companies use the '4-point method', ASTM D4737, based on density, 10% 50% and 90% recovery temperatures. The '2-point method' is defined in ASTM D976, and uses just density and the 50% recovery temperature. This 2-point method tends to overestimate cetane index and is not recommended. Cetane index calculations <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>account</b> <b>for</b> cetane improver additives and therefore do not measure total cetane number for additized diesel fuels. Diesel engine operation is primarily related to the actual cetane number and the cetane index is simply an estimation of the base (unadditized) cetane number.|$|E
40|$|The {{dense medium}} created in Au + Au {{collisions}} at the Relativistic Heavy-Ion Collider (RHIC) significantly suppresses particle production from hard scattering processes and their characteristic back-to-back angular correlation.
