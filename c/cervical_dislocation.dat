The methods that are preferred are those published by councils of veterinarians. The animal {{can be made}} to inhale a gas, such as carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide, by being placed in a chamber, or by use of a face mask, with or without prior sedation or anesthesia. Sedatives or anesthetics such as barbiturates can be given intravenously, or inhalant anesthetics may be used. Amphibians and fish may be immersed in water containing an anesthetic such as tricaine. Physical methods are also used, with or without sedation or anesthesia depending on the method. Recommended methods include decapitation (beheading) for small rodents or rabbits. <b>Cervical</b> <b>dislocation</b> (breaking the neck or spine) may be used for birds, mice, and immature rats and rabbits. Maceration (grinding into small pieces) is used on 1 day old chicks. High-intensity microwave irradiation of the brain can preserve brain tissue and induce death in less than 1 second, but this is currently only used on rodents. Captive bolts may be used, typically on dogs, ruminants, horses, pigs and rabbits. It causes death by a concussion to the brain. Gunshot may be used, but only in cases where a penetrating captive bolt may not be used. Some physical methods are only acceptable after the animal is unconscious. Electrocution may be used for cattle, sheep, swine, foxes, and mink after the animals are unconscious, often by a prior electrical stun. Pithing (inserting a tool into the base of the brain) is usable on animals already unconscious. Slow or rapid freezing, or inducing air embolism are acceptable only with prior anesthesia to induce unconsciousness.|$|E

50|$|Due {{to modern}} {{selective}} breeding, laying hen strains {{are different from}} those of meat production strains.

40|$|<b>Cervical</b> spine <b>dislocation</b> and {{fracture}} of a transverse process are isolated {{risk factors for}} vertebral artery injuries (VAIs), which can cause a life-threatening ischemic stroke. Since in vivo experiments are not possible, {{it has not been}} unclear whether damage to or extension of vertebral arteries is more predictive of a VAI. To identify the imaging characteristics associated with VAI, we analyzed 36 vertebral arteries from 22 <b>cervical</b> spine <b>dislocation</b> patients who underwent computed tomography angiography (Aug. 2008 -Dec. 2014). We evaluated (1) the posttraumatic elongation of the vertebral artery and (2) the presence of fracture involving the transverse foramen. VAI was found in 20 (56 %) of the 36 vertebral arteries. The rate of residual shift (vertebral artery elongation) was not markedly different between the VAI and no-VAI groups. However, the rate of > 1 mm displacement into the foramen and that of fracture with gross displacement (≥ 2 mm) differed significantly between the groups. We found that greater displacement of fractured transverse processes with <b>cervical</b> spine <b>dislocation</b> was a risk factor for VAI. These results suggest that direct damage to the vertebral arteries by transverse process fragments is more likely to predict a VAI compared to elongation, even in <b>cervical</b> spine <b>dislocation...</b>|$|R

He was treated conservatively; however, instability and spondylolisthesis at the C 5 to C 6 joint increased eight weeks after the injury. We performed a posterior-anterior reduction and fixation. After surgery, bony union was achieved, and his neck pain and arm pain disappeared.

50|$|Chick culling is {{the process}} of killing newly hatched poultry for which the {{industry}} has no use. It occurs in all industrialised egg production whether free range, organic, or battery cage - including that of the UK and US. Because male chickens do not lay eggs and only those on breeding programmes are required to fertilise eggs, they are considered redundant to the egg-laying industries and are usually killed soon after they hatch and shortly after being sexed. Many methods of culling do not involve anaesthetic and include <b>cervical</b> <b>dislocation,</b> asphyxiation by carbon dioxide and maceration using a high speed grinder.|$|E
50|$|<b>Cervical</b> <b>dislocation,</b> or {{displacement}} (breaking or fracturing) of the neck, is {{an older}} yet less common method of killing small {{animals such as}} mice. Performed properly {{it is intended to}} cause as painless death as possible and has no cost or equipment involved. The handler must know the proper method of executing the movement which will cause the cervical displacement and without proper training and method education there is a risk of not causing death and can cause severe pain and suffering. It is unknown how long an animal remains conscious, or the level of suffering it goes through after a correct snapping of the neck, which is why it has become less common and often substituted with inhalants.|$|E

40|$|An {{alternative}} emergency {{method for}} killing poultry on-farm is required following European legislation changes (EU 1099 / 2009), which heavily restricts {{the use of}} manual <b>cervical</b> <b>dislocation.</b> This study investigated the kill efficacy of two mechanical methods that conform to the new legislation: (i) a novel mechanical <b>cervical</b> <b>dislocation</b> device; and (ii) a modified captive-bolt device (Rabbit Zinger™) and manual <b>cervical</b> <b>dislocation</b> (the control). Killing treatments were applied to broilers and layers at two stages of production (broilers: 2 – 3 and 5 weeks of age; layers: 12 – 13 and 58 – 62 weeks), {{with a total of}} 180 birds. Latency to abolition of cranial and behavioural reflexes, as well as post mortem analysis of the physiological damage produced, were used to estimate time to unconsciousness and assess kill efficacy. The novel mechanical <b>cervical</b> <b>dislocation</b> device was reliable and a practical method for killing poultry on-farm (100 % kill success), with the majority of cranial reflexes showing no significant differences between interval mean durations across killing methods (eg nictitating membrane [mean = 0. 7 – 3. 3 s], and rhythmic breathing [mean = 0. 0 – 0. 3 s]), however for jaw tone and pupillary reflex, the modified Rabbit Zinger™ had significantly shorter interval mean durations compared to the control and mechanical <b>cervical</b> <b>dislocation</b> device (mean differences: jaw tone = ∼ 8 s; pupillary = ∼ 38 s). The novel mechanical <b>cervical</b> <b>dislocation</b> device resulted in consistent anatomical damage to the birds (eg high dislocation of the neck and severing of the spinal cord) compared to the manual method, despite both having 100 % success rate, while the modified Rabbit Zinger™ was difficult to operate and resulted in varied anatomical damage. The novel mechanical <b>cervical</b> <b>dislocation</b> device showed promise as a replacement kill method on-farm for poultry...|$|E

40|$|Study Design. Retrospective {{case report}} and review. Objective. Cranial <b>cervical</b> <b>dislocation</b> (CCD) is {{commonly}} a devastating injury.

Our purpose is to describe a rare case of occult cranial <b>cervical</b> <b>dislocation</b> (CCD) and use it to highlight key clinical and radiographic findings to ensure expedited diagnosis and proper management avoiding delays and subsequent neurologic deterioration.

We describe a unique case of occult cranial <b>cervical</b> <b>dislocation</b> where initial imaging of the cervical spine failed to illustrate displacement of the occipital-cervical (O-C 1) articulation or C 1 -C 2 articulation.
