5|$|From the 1890s through 1906, Tesla spent a {{great deal}} of his time and fortune on a series of {{projects}} trying to develop the transmission of electrical power without wires. It was an expansion of his idea of using coils to transmit power he had been demonstrating in wireless lighting. He <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>this</b> as not only a way to transmit large amounts of power around the world but also, as he had pointed out in his earlier lectures, a way to transmit worldwide communications.|$|E
25|$|On June 18, 1977, in the New York Yankees' 10–4 {{loss to the}} Boston Red Sox in {{a nationally}} {{televised}} game at Fenway Park in Boston, Jim Rice, a powerful hitter but a slow runner, hit a ball into right field that Reggie Jackson seemed to get to without much speed, and Rice reached second base. Furious, Yankees manager Billy Martin removed Jackson from the game without even waiting {{for the end of}} the inning, sending Paul Blair out to replace him. When Jackson arrived at the dugout, Martin yelled that Jackson had shown him up. The two men argued, and Jackson said that Martin's heavy drinking had impaired his judgment. Despite Jackson being eighteen years younger, about two inches taller and maybe 40 pounds heavier, Martin lunged at him, and had to be restrained by coaches Yogi Berra and Elston Howard. Red Sox fans <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>this</b> in the dugout and began cheering wildly; NBC television cameras showed the confrontation to the entire country.|$|E

500|$|In August 1799, Archduke Charles {{received}} {{orders from}} his brother, the Emperor, {{to withdraw the}} Austrian army across the Rhine. [...] While Charles <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>this</b> to be unreasonable—Alexander Suvorov had not yet reached central Switzerland, and it was folly to think that Alexander Korsakov's force of 30,000 and Hotze's 20,000 could hold all of the region until {{the arrival of the}} rest of the Russian force—the order was emphatic. Charles delayed as long as he could, but in late August he withdrew his force across the Rhine and headed toward Phillipsburg. When Suvorov heard of this breach of military common-sense, he wondered [...] "the owl [...] has either gone out of his mind, or he never had one." [...] The order was eventually reversed too late for the Archduke to stop his withdrawal.|$|E
500|$|Just {{after midnight}} on December 5, Cornwallis' vanguard, which {{consisted}} of two British light infantry battalions, skirmished with an American cavalry patrol {{under the command of}} Capt. Allen McLane near Three Mile Run on Skippack Road. McLane sent a messenger to Washington, alerting him of the British movements. [...] While {{the main body of the}} British troops marched through Germantown, Beggarstown, and Flourtown, American alarm cannons were sounded and positions manned. [...] At 3:00am, the British halted on Chestnut Hill, just south of the American defenses, and waited for daybreak. [...] During the night, Washington ordered his troops to build additional campfires to deceive the British. [...] "...t looked as if fifty thousand men were encamped there. By day we <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>this</b> was merely a trick...," [...] wrote Hessian Maj. Carl von Bauermeister.|$|E
500|$|The Rescue is {{the first}} story under Dennis Spooner as script editor, though he is not listed in the credits because he {{had little to do}} since much of the job was given to his {{predecessor}} David Whitaker and thus he is not credited. The story was commissioned on 1 November 1964, the day after his contract with the BBC for his position as script editor had expired. The scripts were due on 10 November. In Whitaker's original draft, entitled Doctor Who and Tanni after one of Vicki's original names, there are a few differences from the broadcast version. Bennett was more unkind to Vicki. Notably, Koquillion had a [...] "torch" [...] device, which he used to paralyse Ian upon meeting and interrogating him and Barbara in the first episode. He hypnotised Ian and Barbara and tried to get them to encourage the Doctor {{to come out of the}} TARDIS, but the Doctor <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>this</b> on the TARDIS' scanner and demands the teachers be released. In a scuffle Ian's trance was broken when he was shoved against the TARDIS and Barbara's was broken when she was thrown to the ground. The beginning of the first episode also had Ian confide to Barbara that he was afraid of a time where the Doctor would close the TARDIS on them and leave like he did with Susan, to which the Doctor, overhearing, replied that there would be warning if they were to part.|$|E

2500|$|An {{account of}} the episode was {{published}} later in 1544 in London [...] as; The Late Expedition in Scotland made by the King's highness' army under {{the conduct of the}} Right Honourable the Earl of Hertford in 1544. A later account by Mary's secretary Claude Nau records the fleet burning St Mynettes {{on the north side of}} the Forth and taking fishing boats for landing-craft. John Knox gave an {{account of the}} landing from another Scottish viewpoint. The English fleet was sighted before noon on Saturday. Knox said that Cardinal Beaton dismissed the threat and sat calmly at dinner. At 6pm there were 200 ships and an English pilot sounded the depths between Granton and Leith. Though experts <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>this</b> meant the English minded to land still there was no Scottish response. At daybreak on Sunday some of the smaller boats nosed onto land at Granton Crags and the troops landed using these as piers for the larger boats. According to Knox, when around 10,000 men were landed unchallenged the Cardinal and Regent Arran left Edinburgh.|$|E
2500|$|By 09:00 on 25 October, {{the wind}} was rising towards gale strength. [...] Ledbetter was having {{difficulty}} keeping Cedar on station, and the smaller rescue boats that had run for shelter {{on the evening of}} the 24th were unable to return to the reef. [...] Ledbetter decided he would try to anchor Cedar about 500 yards downwind of the reef, shoot a line to Sophia (possibly using a Lyle gun), and then evacuate the passengers by breeches buoy. [...] This would have been extremely hazardous {{and it would have been}} unlikely that over 300 people could be removed by this method, but it seemed the only thing that could be done. [...] Ledbetter twice tried to drop anchor, but each time it failed to catch on the bottom. [...] Locke <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>this</b> effort was failing, and radioed to Ledbetter that it was no use, they would have to wait for low tide when perhaps conditions might be better. [...] There was nothing else that could be done.|$|E
6000|$|He turned quickly round, and she <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>this</b> {{movement}} at least was not designed. He {{looked at her}} a little, and then, [...] "Are {{you out of your}} mind?" [...] he enquired.|$|E
6000|$|I <b>could</b> <b>see</b> that <b>this</b> {{had moved}} him. He plainly wavered. He did {{a sort of}} twiddly on the turf with his foot. And, when he spoke, one spotted the tremolo in the voice: ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Say! that's great!" [...] {{burst out}} the would-be poet.

6000|$|... "It may be so," [...] {{returned}} {{our hero}} wearily, {{for he was}} beginning to lose heart, and the prospect opened up to him by Zook did not on the first blush of it seem very brilliant. [...] "When <b>could</b> I <b>see</b> <b>this</b> old woman?" ...|$|R
60|$|I <b>could</b> <b>see</b> that <b>this</b> little spot of {{friction}} had rattled the bearded bloke a bit. He {{stood for a}} moment fumbling at the fungus with a hesitating hand. But they make these head masters of tough stuff. The weakness passed. He came back nicely and carried on.|$|R
60|$|Ruby had seated {{himself in}} {{the bow of the}} gig, with his face turned {{steadily}} towards the sea, so that no one <b>could</b> <b>see</b> it. <b>This</b> position he maintained in silence until the boat ranged up to what appeared like the side of a great mountain, looming through the mist.|$|R

60|$|I <b>could</b> <b>see</b> all <b>this</b> {{time that}} Dirck was uneasy, {{and had some}} {{amusement}} in watching the workings of his countenance.

60|$|Yet why be afraid? It {{was bound}} to happen. To be murdered! He looked round in terror at the snow, the rocking, pale, shadowy slopes of the upper world.

6000|$|The {{alderman}} turned away, and Ambrose and Stephen {{exchanged a}} passionate embrace, feeling {{what it was}} to be still left to one another.
