50|$|The Mark IV Breathing Pacemaker is a phrenic nerve stimulator, {{also called}} a {{diaphragm}} pacemaker. Phrenic nerve stimulation {{is a technique}} whereby a nerve stimulator provides electrical stimulation of the phrenic nerve to cause diaphragmatic contraction. It consists of surgically implanted receivers and electrodes mated to an external transmitter by antennas worn over the implanted receivers. An external battery-operated transmitter sends radiofrequency energy to the receiver through an antenna, which {{is placed on the}} skin overlying the receiver. The receiver converts this energy into an electric current that is directed to the phrenic nerve in order to stimulate the nerve, thereby causing contraction of the diaphragm. The surgery can be performed via either a cervical or thoracic approach. Phrenic pacing provides ventilatory support for patients with <b>chronic</b> <b>respiratory</b> <b>insufficiency</b> whose diaphragm, lungs, and phrenic nerves have residual function.|$|E
40|$|A {{total of}} 753 infants {{weighing}} less than 1800 g at birth were studied prospectively and their serum IgM concentrations measured within 72 hours of age. Placentas from 584 of these infants were examined histologically for chorioamnionitis.

Mean serum IgM concentration for Wilson-Mikity syndrome was 1. 02 g/l whereas it was 0. 14 g/l for bronchopulmonary dysplasia and 0. 32 g/l for unexplained chronic lung disease. The incidence of chorioamnionitis was significantly higher in Wilson-Mikity syndrome (30 / 35) compared with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (4 / 16) and with infants without <b>chronic</b> <b>respiratory</b> <b>insufficiency</b> (145 / 490).

40|$|Nutrition {{assessment}} is important during <b>chronic</b> <b>respiratory</b> <b>insufficiency</b> {{to evaluate the}} level of malnutrition or obesity and should include body composition measurements. The appreciation of fat-free and fat reserves in patients with <b>chronic</b> <b>respiratory</b> <b>insufficiency</b> can aid in designing an adapted nutritional support, e. g., nutritional support in malnutrition and food restriction in obesity. The {{purpose of the present}} study was to cross-validate fat-free and fat mass obtained by various bioelectric impedance (BIA) formulas with the fat-free and fat mass measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) and determine the formulas that are best suited to predict the fat-free and fat mass for a group of patients with severe <b>chronic</b> <b>respiratory</b> <b>insufficiency.</b> Seventy-five patients (15 women and 60 men) with chronic obstructive and restrictive respiratory insufficiency aged 45 - 86 y were included in this study. Body composition was calculated according to 13 different BIA formulas for women and 12 for men and compared with DXA. Because of the variability, calculated as 2 standard deviations, of +/- 5. 0 kg fat-free mass for women and +/- 6. 4 kg for men for the best predictive formula, the use of the various existing BIA formulas was considered not clinically relevant.

40|$|The Maugeri Respiratory Failure (MRF- 28) and Severe <b>Respiratory</b> <b>Insufficiency</b> (SRI) {{questionnaires}} were recently developed to assess health-related {{quality of life}} (HRQoL) in patients with <b>chronic</b> <b>respiratory</b> failure, although not exclusively in {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (COPD) patients. The aim {{of the present study was}} to investigate whether the MRF- 28 and SRI are reliable and valid HROoL questionnaires in COPD patients with <b>chronic</b> hypercapnic <b>respiratory</b> failure (CHRF). In total, 72 COPD patients with CHRF underwent pulmonary function and exercise testing, and completed the MRF- 28, the SRI, the <b>Chronic</b> <b>Respiratory</b> Questionnaire (CRQ), the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, the Groningen Activity and Restriction Scale and two dyspnoea indexes. Physical domain scores of the questionnaires correlated with exercise tolerance, dyspnoea and daily activities, while psychological domains correlated strongly with anxiety and depression. Anxiety scores accounted for 51 and 56 % of the total explained variance in total CRQ and SRI scores, respectively. The emphasis of the MRF- 28 was restrictions in activities of daily living (52 % of total variance).

40|$|Objective: To {{clarify the}} {{relationship}} between symptoms, clinical signs and physiological abnormalities that were motivating the initiation of home mechanical ventilation in patients suffering from neuromuscular diseases. Methods: From The Swedish Home Mechanical Ventilation Register we identified 352 patients with neuromuscular diseases and we looked at circumstances (acute vs elective) and clinical motives for starting ventilatory support. Results: Home mechanical ventilation was commenced electively in 268 patients (76 %) and among these daytime sleepiness {{was the most common}} motive, being reported in 56 % of the patients. In the 24 children with spinal muscular atrophy, however, 96 % started ventilation electively and cough insufficiency was the most common motive. The patients were moderately hypercapnic (PaCO 2 : 7. 0 kPa, SD 1. 3). None of the clinical motives were related to the PaCO 2 level. Average PaO 2 was above 8 kPa in all groups, but lowest in the patients with post-polio and dystrophia myotonica. Mean vital capacity was close to 40 % of predicted, but significantly lower in the Duchenne patients (26 % of predicted). Conclusion: Daytime sleepiness was the most common clinical symptom motivating home mechanical ventilation in this group of patients with <b>chronic</b> hypercapnic <b>respiratory</b> <b>insufficiency</b> secondary to neuro/myopathies.

40|$|Outbreaks of Pneumocystis carinii {{pneumonia}} {{occurred in}} colonies of nu/nu and scid/scid mice at four different institutions. The disease, which {{was characterized by}} <b>chronic</b> wasting and <b>respiratory</b> <b>insufficiency,</b> was more severe in older mice and in animals housed in cages with special protective tops. Histopathologic features included alveolar filling with the typical foamy honeycomb material and a mild, nonspecific host inflammatory response. Immunofluorescence and immunoblotting studies suggested the P. carinii isolate was of mouse rather than of rat or human origin, and the outbreaks {{could be related to}} each other by common vendor or source of breeding animals. Once P. carinii became established in a mouse colony, the organism tended to persist for long periods of time. The principal control measure was depopulation of the colony, although limited experience with the administration of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was encouraging. Thus, outbreaks of pneumocystosis are a serious problem among colonies of immunodeficient mice, with important implications for the use of these animals in biomedical research. Data obtained by studying these outbreaks should enhance understanding of the pathogenesis of P. carinii pneumonia and be helpful in formulating improved methods of detection and control...|$|R
40|$|Cystic {{fibrosis}} (CF) is genetically conditioned, {{autosomal recessive}} disease {{that occurs in}} the European population with a prevalence of about 1 : 2500 - 1 : 1800. In this disease we observe a mutation of the CTFR gene with subsequent fault in chloride channels. Such afflicted individuals usually suffer from <b>chronic</b> <b>respiratory</b> problems, pancreatic <b>insufficiency,</b> high concentration of chloride ions in sweat and obstructive azoospermia. Genetic testing of CFTR gene is indicated in individuals who meet the CF clinical picture and a positive sweat test (increased concentration of chlorides in the sweat). Genetic testing of the CFTR gene is usually done by using commercial kits detecting the most common mutations of the CFTR gene in the Czech Republic. If the testing results are negative, it is further performed an MLPA method that captures the larger deletions and duplications of gene, eventually a sequencing of all exons is. Despite the well-established algorithm of the testing, some patients suffering from symptoms of CF are left without genetic findings.

40|$|SUMMARY Nineteen {{patients}} with <b>chronic</b> <b>respiratory</b> <b>insufficiency,</b> mean age 61 - 4 + 12 - 2, {{have been investigated}} with pulmonary function tests, clinical neurological examination and neurophysiological methods including motor and sensory conduction studies and needle elec-tromyography.

The motor and sensory conduction studies showed only a reduced mean amplitude of the ulnar nerve SAP and of the compound muscle action potential of the APB and EDB muscles. The EMG was abnormal in 94 - 7 % of the cases and showed an increased percentage of polyphasic potentials and a reduced recruitment pattern of motor units firing at high frequency.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{non-invasive}} technique of nasal intermittent positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) has an established {{role in providing}} domiciliary nocturnal ventilatory support in patients with chest wall disorders, neuromuscular disease, and chronic obstructive lung disease. NIPPV was used to simplify ventilatory management and assist the return of spontaneous breathing in patients with <b>chronic</b> <b>respiratory</b> <b>insufficiency</b> who had failed to wean from conventional intermittent positive pressure ventilation (IPPV). METHODS: A trial of NIPPV {{was carried out in}} 22 patients with weaning difficulties. Nine patients had chest wall disorders or primary lung disease, six had neuromuscular conditions, and seven had cardiac disorders with additional pulmonary disease. Conventional IPPV via an endotracheal tube or tracheostomy had been continued postoperatively in nine patients and 13 had been ventilated after acute cardiorespiratory decompensation. RESULTS: Conventional IPPV had been continued for a median of 31 days (range 2 - 219). Eighteen patients were successfully transferred to NIPPV and discharged home a median of 11 days (range 8 - 13) after starting this type of ventilation. Sixteen patients remain well 1 - 50 months after hospital discharge and 10 of these continue on domiciliary nocturnal NIPPV. Seven patients have returned to work. CONCLUSION: NIPPV can be used to facilitate the return of spontaneous breathing and to reduce the need for intensive care accommodation in patients with an acute exacerbation of <b>chronic</b> <b>respiratory</b> <b>insufficiency</b> that requires intubation and IPPV...|$|E
40|$|Background/Aim. <b>Chronic</b> <b>respiratory</b> <b>insufficiency</b> is a {{pathological}} state which occurs {{as a result}} of respiratory system inability to maintain normal gas exchange between the outside air and circulating blood. For the purposes of human organism’s proper functioning, it is necessary that a certain amount of air in the lungs comes into contact {{with a certain amount of}} blood within a unit of time, so that an adequate hemoglobin oxygenation could be achieved. Then, hemoglobin from erythrocytes in the blood supply delivers oxygen to all the tissues and cells of the body including the eye. Direct impact of hypoxemia and hypercapnia on the wall of arterioles, venules and capillaries results in a severe vasodilatation along with the increased permeability of the walls causing clinically evident changes in the retina. The aim of this study was to determine the degree of ocular changes in retina with patients suffering from <b>chronic</b> <b>respiratory</b> <b>insufficiency.</b> Methods. A prospective study was conducted on 80 patients, 40 patients with respiratory failure and 40 patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease an and bronchial asthma (the control group). In all the patients direct and indirect ophthalmoscopy and fluoresceine angiography was performed. Clinically visible fundus and retina changes in patients suffering from chronic respiratory failure were categorized as mild (dilatation and retinal veins and arteries tortosion up to the mid-periphery), moderate (retinal hemorrhage) and severe (optic nerve edema, macular edema, superficial and deep retinal hemorrhages and venous occlusion). Results. In the patients suffering from respiratory insufficiency the changes in retinal blood vessels were found [in 18 (45 %) mild, in 13 (32. 5 %) moderate, and in 9 (22 %) severe], while in the patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and bronchial asthma (without respiratory insufficiency) no changes were recognized. Conclusion. The results of this study indicate the need for ophthalmologic examination in patients with <b>chronic</b> <b>respiratory</b> <b>insufficiency.</b> It is important to recognize, identify and quantify the changes on retinal blood vessels which are clinically significant. It is necessary to provide their monitoring and to prescribe proper therapeutic treatment in order to preserve visual functions...|$|E

The purpose of this review is to survey recent developments in the treatment of lung disease  in children and adolescents with CF. We describe newborn screening for CF. When <b>chronic</b> <b>respiratory</b> <b>insufficiency</b> occurs, lung transplantation becomes a very important issue.

40|$|BackgroundRarely, {{hypoxaemia}} {{is associated}} with shunt reversal at the atrial level. Closure by interventional catheterization is the treatment of choice but indications and results have mbeen studied insufficiently. PurposeTo describe our experience with interventional closure of atrial rightto-left shunts described as hypoxaemic and the impact on patient oxygenation and clinical status. MethodRetrospective study in two referral centres, including all patients undergoing closure of interatrial right-to-left shunt associated with hypoxaemia. ResultsSince 2001, 21 consecutive patients underwent interventional shunt closure usingthe “Amplatzer® device”; two patients had atrial septal defect and 19 had patent foramen ovale. Three patients had minor adverse events; two patients have a tiny residual shunt. Transcutaneous oxygen saturation and partial oxygen pressure increased significantly from 86 ± 5 to 95 ± 3 % (p< 0. 001) and from 49. 8 ± 6. 8 to 82. 9 ± 30. 4 mmHg (p= 0. 001), respectively. Seventeen (80 %) patients reported clinical improvement. However, patients with <b>chronic</b> <b>respiratory</b> <b>insufficiency</b> remained more symptomatic, with three deaths after a median follow-up of 35 (6 – 97) months and 89 % remaining in New York Heart Association class III/IV (vs 29 % of patients without chronic respiratory insufficiency; p= 0. 035). ConclusionHypoxaemic shunts are treated effectively by transcatheter closure, resulting in functional improvement in patients without respiratory insufficiency.
