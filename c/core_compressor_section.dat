50|$|The F124 {{engine is}} {{fundamentally}} a low bypass, two spool engine (meaning {{that there are}} two rotational shafts, a high-pressure shaft and a low-pressure shaft). The fan/low-pressure <b>compressor</b> <b>section</b> is made of three stages with titanium blades. The first stage has 30 un-shrouded blades, and the overall pressure ratio for the three stage fan section is 2.5:1. Some of the air is bypassed (Bypass ratio of 0.472:1), and the rest is fed to the high-pressure <b>compressor</b> <b>section.</b>|$|R

50|$|Engine {{manufacturer}} CFM International {{is using}} blisk {{technology in the}} <b>compressor</b> <b>section</b> of its Leap-X demonstrator engine program, which has completed full-scale rig testing. PowerJet SaM146 engines used on Sukhoi Superjet 100s are also equipped with blisks.|$|R
50|$|As a result, an {{engineer}} at Bristol Engine Company, Gordon Lewis, began in 1956 to study alternative engine concepts, where possible, existing engine components from the Orpheus and Olympus engine series. The work was {{overseen by the}} Technical Director Stanley Hooker. One concept which looked promising was the BE52, which initially used the Orpheus 3 as the engine core and, on a separate coaxial shaft, the first 2 stages of an Olympus 21 LP compressor, which acted as a fan, delivering compressed air to 2 thrust vectoring nozzles {{at the front of}} engine. At this point in design exercise, the exhaust from the LP turbine discharged through a conventional rear nozzle. There were separate intakes for the fan and <b>core</b> <b>compressor</b> because the fan did not supercharge the <b>core</b> <b>compressor.</b>|$|R
50|$|Power for the {{accessory}} drive {{is taken from}} the central shaft linking the turbine and <b>compressor</b> <b>sections</b> of the engine. This requires an internal gearbox that couples the drive to a radial driveshaft or towershaft that drives an external gearbox.|$|R
40|$|A digital {{electronic}} control was combined with conventional hydromechanical components {{to operate the}} four controlled variables on the under-the-wing engine: fuel flow, fan blade pitch, fan exhaust area, and <b>core</b> <b>compressor</b> stator angles.

25|$|The {{cabin is}} {{pressurized}} with bleed air tapped from the jet engine's <b>compressor</b> <b>sections,</b> which are {{prior to the}} combustion sections. That air is very hot and must be cooled by heat exchangers before it is directed into the air conditioning units, which cool it even further.|$|R
5000|$|In a {{gas turbine}} engine, a single turbine section {{is made up}} of a disk or hub that holds many turbine blades. That turbine section is {{connected}} to a <b>compressor</b> <b>section</b> via a shaft (or [...] "spool"), and that <b>compressor</b> <b>section</b> can either be axial or centrifugal. Air is compressed, raising the pressure and temperature, through the compressor stages of the engine. The temperature is then greatly increased by combustion of fuel inside the combustor, which sits between the compressor stages and the turbine stages. The high-temperature and high-pressure exhaust gases then pass through the turbine stages. The turbine stages extract energy from this flow, lowering the pressure and temperature of the air and transfer the kinetic energy to the compressor stages along the spool. This process is very similar to how an axial compressor works, only in reverse.|$|R
50|$|The D-436 {{engine was}} {{developed}} as a follow on to the Lotarev D-36. The engine took several of its design features from that engine and another Progress engine, the Progress D-18. The D-436 incorporated an updated, higher RPM fan, a lower emissions combustor, and new <b>compressor</b> <b>sections.</b> Several variants of the engine incorporate a FADEC.|$|R
50|$|Most modern {{jet engines}} are turbofans. The low {{pressure}} compressor(LPC), usually {{known as a}} fan, compresses air into a bypass duct whilst its inner portion supercharges the <b>core</b> <b>compressor.</b> The fan is often {{an integral part of}} a multi-stage core LPC. The bypass airflow either passes to a separate 'cold nozzle' or mixes with low pressure turbine exhaust gases, before expanding through a 'mixed flow nozzle'.|$|R
50|$|Because {{of their}} lower {{efficiency}} and larger bulk, air cycle coolers are not often used nowadays in terrestrial cooling devices. However, the {{air cycle machine}} is very common on gas turbine-powered jet aircraft as cooling and ventilation units, because compressed air is readily available from the engines' <b>compressor</b> <b>sections.</b> Such units also serve the purpose of pressurizing the aircraft.|$|R
40|$|High {{response}} {{measurements of}} a Pratt and Whitney F 100 (3) turbofan engine at a simulated Mach number and altitude of 1. 2 and 3000 m (10, 000 ft) respectively were recorded during a nonrecoverable stall. The nonrecoverable stall occurred {{as a result}} of incorrect scheduling of the high compressor variable vanes (RCVV) during an experimental engine control investigation. Recorded data indicates rotating stall originating in the high pressure compressor. From this region the disturbance propagates upstream into the fan and downstream throughout the <b>core</b> <b>compressor.</b> The rotating stall remained in the <b>core</b> <b>compressor</b> until the engine was shutdown. The fan exhibited some rotating stall, but the amplitude of the pressure oscillations were less severe. Data indicates that the fan was able to recover from the stall. Fan turbine inlet temperature (FTIT) had been decreasing until stall developed in the high-pressure compressor. From this time, FTIT increased towards its maximum temperature limit. The rising FTIT during nonrecoverable stall {{may be the result of}} incomplete combustion in the combustor and additional combustion occurring through the turbine...|$|R

50|$|The overall {{pressure}} ratio increases from 36 to 50 thanks to Trent XWB <b>core</b> <b>compressor</b> technology, improving thermal efficiency. It implies 200-kelvin higher internal temperatures, handled by thermally coated high-pressure turbine blades, not needing more expensive ceramic matrix composites, {{which will be}} used in 2020 with the next Rolls-Royce engine generation. The larger fan and higher bypass ratio need a low-pressure turbine with two more stages; the engine will be 3,500 lbs kg heavier.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a study of}} the dynamics for a single-stage, axial-flow, high speed <b>compressor</b> <b>core,</b> specifically, the NASA Lewis rotor stage 37. Due to the overall blading design for this advanced <b>core</b> <b>compressor,</b> each stage has considerable tip loading and higher speed than most compressor designs, thus, the compressor operates closer to the stall margin. The onset of rotating stall is explained as bifurcations in the dynamics of axial compressors. Data taken from the compressor during a rotating stall event is analyzed. Through the use of a box-assisted correlation dimension methodology, the attractor dimension is determined during the bifurcations leading to rotating stall. The intent {{of this study is to}} examine the behavior of precursive stall events so as to predict the entrance into rotating stall. This information may provide a better means to identify, avoid or control the undesirable event of rotating stall formation in high speed <b>compressor</b> <b>cores...</b>|$|R
40|$|A {{control system}} {{incorporating}} a digital electronic control {{was designed for}} the over-the-wing engine.

50|$|Because airliners fly at {{very high}} altitudes, the cabin must be {{pressurized}} to provide a safe quantity of breathable oxygen to passengers and crew.The cabin is pressurized with bleed air tapped from the jet engine's <b>compressor</b> <b>sections,</b> which are prior to the combustion sections. That air is very hot and must be cooled by heat exchangers before it is directed into the air conditioning units, which cool it even further.|$|R
5000|$|A common {{approach}} is to route engine [...] "bleed air" [...] into ducting along the leading edges of wings and tailplanes. The air heats {{the leading edge of}} the surface and this melts or evaporates ice on contact. On a turbine powered aircraft air is extracted from the <b>compressor</b> <b>section</b> of the engine. If the aircraft is turbocharged piston powered, bleed air can be scavenged from the turbocharger.|$|R
40|$|Titanium alloys {{are used}} in the {{manufacture}} of gas turbine aircraft engine <b>compressor</b> <b>section</b> components, which in use are exposed to high temperatures and corrosive environments. The platinum aluminide coatings described here have been developed to protect titanium alloys from oxidation and alpha case formation and can thus significantly improve the life of the alloys. The coatings showed a very low weight gain and alpha case formation did not occur during the entire period of exposure. The superior performance of the coating is due to the formation of a protective, adherent and continuous alumina scale on its su$ace. The results clearly suggest that this platinum aluminide coating is a prospective coating material to pmtect the titanium a 1 lo. v components both from oxidntion and alpha case,forniation. The development {{of a wide range of}} titanium alloys for use in the <b>compressor</b> <b>section</b> of modem gas turbine engines has resulted in an improve-ment in aero gas turbine engine performance.

Blade loading levels are compared for the near stall conditions and comparisons are made of loss and diffusion factors over the operating range of incidence angles...|$|R
50|$|Although {{the team}} had already turned {{to the design of}} the Chinook's successor, the Orenda, work on the engines {{continued}} in order to gain experience in construction and operation. Frank Whittle personally viewed the engine in 1948. Only six sets of engine parts were made, from these three complete engines and one <b>compressor</b> <b>section</b> were completed. By October 1949 the engines had run over 1,000 hours and had improved to over 3,000 lbf (1,360 kg) thrust.|$|R
40|$|Ice {{buildup in}} the <b>compressor</b> <b>section</b> of a {{commercial}} aircraft gas turbine engine can cause a number of engine failures. One of these failure modes is known as engine rollback: an uncommanded decrease in thrust accompanied by a decrease in fan speed {{and an increase in}} turbine temperature. This paper describes the development of a model which simulates the system level impact of engine icing using the Commercial Modular Aero-Propulsion System Simulation 40 k (C-MAPSS 40 k). When an ice blockage is added to C-MAPSS 40 k, the control system responds {{in a manner similar to}} that of an actual engine, and, in cases with severe blockage, an engine rollback is observed. Using this capability to simulate engine rollback, a proof-of-concept detection scheme is developed and tested using only typical engine sensors. This paper concludes that the engine control system s limit protection is the proximate cause of iced engine rollback and that the controller can detect the buildup of ice particles in the <b>compressor</b> <b>section.</b> This work serves as a feasibility study for continued research into the detection and mitigation of engine rollback using the propulsion control system...|$|R

The design pressure ratio is 1. 8 at an adiabatic efficiency of 88. 5 percent. Both rotor and stator have multiple-circular-arc airfoil sections. Variable IGV and stator vanes permit low speed matching adjustments. The design incorporates an inlet duct representative of an engine transition duct between fan and high pressure compressor...|$|R

25|$|In {{the case}} of Electro-Motive Diesel's {{two-stroke}} engines, the mechanically assisted turbocharger is not specifically a twincharger, as the engine uses the mechanical assistance to charge air only at lower engine speeds and startup.

This differs from a turbocharger that uses the <b>compressor</b> <b>section</b> of the turbo-compressor only during starting and, as a two-stroke engines cannot naturally aspirate, and, according to SAE definitions, a two-stroke engine with a mechanically assisted compressor during idle and low throttle is considered naturally aspirated.|$|R

At a design inlet velocity of 0. 77, the maximum ram-pressure recovery attained with effective water-separating inlet was 77 percent, which is considerably less than attainable with a direct-ram inlet.

50|$|Normally, as air {{enters a}} jet engine, it is {{compressed}} by the inlet, and thus heats up. It needs much {{more power to}} compress that heated air further by the turbine's <b>compressor</b> <b>section,</b> which reduces the turbine's efficiency dramatically. Furthermore, this means that high-speed engines {{need to be made}} of materials that can survive extremely high temperatures. In practice, this inevitably makes the engines heavier and also reduces the amount of fuel that can be burned, to avoid melting the gas turbine section of the engine. This in turn reduces thrust at high speed.|$|R
