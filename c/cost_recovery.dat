5|$|The {{water and}} {{sanitation}} sector in Colombia underwent one cycle of centralization and decentralization within the past several decades. Since the enactment of a comprehensive new sector policy in 1994, various governments have pursued {{the same set of}} basic policies, including targeted transfers to municipalities, private sector participation, regulation, <b>cost</b> <b>recovery</b> and a system of cross-subsidies.|$|E
5|$|The Colombian {{tariff system}} {{is defined in}} the Ley de Servicios Públicos or Public Services Law from 1994. It is applied in public, mixed and private companies. The tariff system aims at {{reconciling}} the achievement of <b>cost</b> <b>recovery</b> with {{the protection of the}} poor. The basic tariff is calculated on the basis of economic costs according to a methodology defined at the national level by CRA (Law 287 of 2004). Therefore, in principle, tariffs in different municipalities do not differ due to local government’s decisions to raise tariffs or not, but only because of the different costs of the services.|$|E
5|$|In the 1980s, {{the sector}} was in crisis, {{characterized}} by low investment, poor <b>cost</b> <b>recovery</b> and poor service quality {{in most of}} the country. As a result, the government decided to break up INSFOPAL {{at the end of the}} 1980s and to devolve the responsibility for service provision back to the municipalities after four decades, except for some cases like the Valle de Cauca department, where the regional companies continued providing the services. Furthermore, the institutional responsibility for the sector was transferred from the Ministry of Health to the Ministry of Economic Development. This change was not only an administrative change, but it introduced a different focus and perspective to the sector.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{compares the}} pricing rule {{embodied}} in the Federal Communications Commissions (FCCs) forward-looking cost model with a competitive equilibrium pricing rule. The rules differ {{due to differences in}} discount factors, the time path of operating <b>cost</b> <b>recoveries,</b> and the methods used to spread capital costs over time. A calibrated comparison of the rules for end-office switching reveals that the latter is most significant, causing the FCCs rule to understate <b>cost</b> <b>recoveries</b> by 24 percent. A rough aggregation suggests this difference compounds to billions of dollars nationwide, solely for the direct costs of end-office switching. This understatement is driven by falling switch costs over time, and the FCCs rule would overstate <b>cost</b> <b>recoveries</b> by a similar magnitude for assets whose costs rise over time. The competitive equilibrium rule also clarifies the endogeneity of economic life and reveals that depreciation assumptions are not needed for calculating competitive equilibrium prices.

5|$|The two liberal {{governments of}} César Gaviria (1990-1994) and Ernesto Samper (1994-1998) pursued {{a policy of}} {{economic}} opening and business modernization. In the spirit of these policies, the government established a comprehensive new sector policy that aimed at increasing water and sanitation investments through targeted transfers to municipalities, improving service quality and efficiency by promoting private sector participation in the poorest {{parts of the country}} where public utilities were not performing well, the establishment of autonomous regulatory agencies at the national level, increased <b>cost</b> <b>recovery,</b> and protecting the poorest through cross-subsidies in the form of area-based tariffs. The basis of this sector policy was established by Law 142 of July 1994, at the end of president César Gaviria’s term of office. With some modifications to that law in 2001, the same policy continues to be pursued to today despite several changes of governments.|$|E
5|$|Water {{supply and}} {{sanitation}} in Turkey is characterised by achievements and challenges. Over the past decades access to drinking water {{has become almost}} universal and access to adequate sanitation has also increased substantially. Autonomous utilities have been created in the 16 metropolitan cities of Turkey and <b>cost</b> <b>recovery</b> has been increased, thus providing {{the basis for the}} sustainability of service provision. Intermittent supply, which was common in many cities, has become less frequent. In 2004, 61% of the wastewater collected through sewers was being treated. Remaining challenges include the need to further increase wastewater treatment, to reduce the high level of non-revenue water hovering around 50% and to expand access to adequate sanitation in rural areas. The investment required to comply with EU standards in the sector, especially in wastewater treatment, is estimated to be in the order of €2 billion per year, more than double the current level of investment.|$|E

25|$|The Egyptian {{government}} highly subsidizes the sector. The Egyptian Water Regulatory Agency {{estimates the}} degree of overall <b>cost</b> <b>recovery</b> in 2012/13 at 62%, and the recovery of {{operation and maintenance costs}} excluding depreciation at 76%. The regulator classifies this as insufficient compared to a good performance of more than 80% full <b>cost</b> <b>recovery</b> and more than 100% operation and maintenance <b>cost</b> <b>recovery.</b> This is lower than {{the degree of}} <b>cost</b> <b>recovery</b> achieved in 2010, when the recovery of operation and maintenance costs, excluding depreciation, through operating revenues was 95% for water supply and sanitation, ranging from 31% in Sinai to 134% in Beheira. Nevertheless, the degree of <b>cost</b> <b>recovery</b> is apparently higher {{than it was in the}} early 2000s. According to one estimate dating from prior to 2007, <b>cost</b> <b>recovery</b> was only 20%, with tariffs at 0.23 EP per m3 and costs at 1.10 EP per m3. According to another estimate, between 1982 and 2004 the government spent 65 billion Egyptian pounds (about 10.73 billion USD at the exchange rate of 2004) for water supply and sanitation, of which 40% was recovered through tariff revenues.|$|E

40|$|Background: There is a {{need for}} routine {{estimates}} of injury <b>recovery</b> <b>costs</b> from pedestrian collisions using hospital separation records for economic evaluations. Objective: To estimate the <b>cost</b> of injury <b>recovery</b> following pedestrian–vehicle collisions using the personal injury recover cost (PIRC) equation using key demographic and injury characteristics. Method: An estimation of the costs of on-road pedestrian–vehicle collisions involving individuals who were injured and hospitalized in New South Wales (NSW), Australia, from 2002 to 2011 using the PIRC equation. The PIRC estimates individual injury <b>recovery</b> <b>costs</b> and does not include costs associated with property damage, vehicle repair, or rescue services. Individual <b>recovery</b> <b>costs</b> associated with severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) were estimated. The injured individual's mean, median, and total injury <b>recovery</b> <b>costs</b> are described for key demographic, injury, and crash characteristics. Results: There were 9, 781 pedestrians who were injured, costing an estimated total of $ 2. 4 billion in personal injury <b>recovery</b> <b>costs,</b> an annual cost of $ 243 million. Males had a total injury <b>recovery</b> <b>cost</b> 1. 7 times higher than females. The median injury <b>recovery</b> <b>cost</b> decreased with increasing age. TBI ($ 248, 491) and spinal cord and vertebral column injuries ($ 264, 103) had the highest median injury <b>recovery</b> <b>costs</b> for the body region of the most severe injury. TBI accounted for 22. 6 % of the total injury <b>recovery</b> <b>costs</b> for the most severe injury sustained. Just over one third of pedestrians sustained 4 or more injuries, with a median cost of $ 243, 992, which was 1. 6 times higher than the cost for a pedestrian who sustained a single injury ($ 153, 682). Conclusions: Personal injury <b>recovery</b> <b>costs</b> following pedestrian–vehicle collisions where a pedestrian is injured are substantial in NSW. The PIRC equation enables the economic cost burden of road traffic injury to be calculated using hospital separation data. The PIRC enables comprehensive personal injury <b>recovery</b> <b>costs</b> to be estimated and would aid in economic evaluations of preventive strategies in road safety. 7 page(s...|$|R

25|$|<b>Cost</b> <b>recovery.</b> The {{accepted}} {{norm for}} <b>cost</b> <b>recovery</b> in urban {{water supply and}} sanitation in Yemen is for the tariff to be set such that the operation and maintenance costs are recovered at the least, with the government and donors financing investments. However, in some cases, such as Sana’a, credits by international donors are on-lent to the utility. A few utilities have been able to achieve full <b>cost</b> <b>recovery.</b> One example is the small town Bait al Faqih which has a new system and low losses, indicating a functional and efficient network, and no inherited staff and thus no overstaffing.

25|$|Although Uganda's {{official}} {{policy is to}} promote tariffs that cover all costs, the NWSC tariff actually covers only operation and maintenance costs. According to a 2003 published report, the second performance contract between the government of Uganda and NWSC provided for a tariff policy {{that in the long}} term covered operation, maintenance, and a part of the future investments. Although the current tariff structure does recover operation and maintenance costs, the tariffs are not high enough to finance system expansion, leaving system improvement and extension investments to the national government and international donors. According to UN-Water, full <b>cost</b> <b>recovery</b> tariffs including investments would require a significant rise of tariffs. William T.

40|$|Security {{of energy}} supply {{is a key}} to social and {{economic}} development of society. Liberalization of power market has brought changes in the process of decision making regarding new investments in power system and certain concerns arise related to adequacy of the present investments. Taking into consideration that significant amount of generating capacities in Croatian power system will be shut down in the following years, it will be even more challenging to satisfy a growing demand. Energy saved through energy efficiency measures can be considered an alternative source of energy. Within this thesis a question has been answered whether it is more economically feasible to invest public money in new generating capacities or to invest it in large-scale energy efficiency improvements. The answer has been provided through calculating levelized cost of electricity of three different electricity generating options and comparing it to energy saving costs of currently proposed energy efficiency measures. Furthermore, the problem of peaking capacity and fixed <b>costs</b> <b>recovery</b> has been analyzed. It has been concluded that a certain capacity mechanism is needed in order to ensure investment <b>costs</b> <b>recovery</b> and stimulate investments. </p...|$|R
