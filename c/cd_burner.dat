40|$|The Rotary Combustor {{is a novel}} {{concept for}} burning coal with low SO{sub 2 } and NO{sub x} emissions. It burns crushed coal in a fluid bed where the bed is {{maintained}} in a rotating drum by centripetal force. Since this force may be varied, the combustor may be very compact, and thus be a direct replacement for a p. <b>c.</b> <b>burner</b> on existing boilers. The primary objective of this project is to demonstrate that a typical industrial boiler can be refired with the modified prototype Rotary Combustor to burn Ohio high-sulfur coal with low emissions of SO{sub 2 } and NO{sub x}. The primary problem that must be resolved to demonstrate sustained operations with coal is temperature control in the rotating fluid bed. The prototype Rotary Combustor was assembled and installed on the T- 850 P CNB boiler at the CONSOL Energy site in South Park, Pennsylvania. Several design improvements were investigated and implemented during the assembly to improve the prototype Rotary Combustor operations compared to prior tests at Detroit Stoker in Monroe, Michigan. An Operating Manual and Safety Review were completed. The shakedown test phase was initiated. Two major problems were initially encountered: binding of the rotating drum at operating temperatures, and reduced fluid-bed pressure drop after short periods of operation. Plating the brush seal rotary land ring with a chrome carbide plasma spray and lubricating the seal prior to each test sufficiently resolved these problems to permit {{a limited number of}} operations tests. Unlike previous tests at Detroit Stoker, sustained operation of the prototype Rotary Combustor was accomplished burning a high-Btu fuel, metallurgical coke. The prototype Rotary Combustor was operated with coke in gasifier mode on two occasions. Fluid-bed temperature spiking was minimized with manual control of the feeds (coke, air and steam), and no clinker formation problems were encountered in either test. Emission levels of NO{sub x} were measured at about 270 ppmv which were higher those targeted for the device which were 100 ppmv. This was assumed to be because of the aforementioned temperature spiking. The primary operating problem remains control of the fluid-bed temperature. Although improvements were made, steam flow control was manual, and very coarse. To accomplish this will require finer control of the steam flow to the rotary drum air plenum, and development of an algorithm for automatic control using the Moore APACS{trademark}. This is the recommended succeeding step {{in the development of the}} Rotary Combustor for industrial or utility use...|$|R

40|$|New {{system for}} {{start-up}} and flame support based on coal gasification by low temperature air thermal plasma is planned to supplement current heavy oil system in Serbian thermal {{power plants in}} order to decrease air pollutions emission and operational costs. Locally introduced plasma thermal energy heats up and ignites entrained coal particles, thus starting chain process which releases heat energy from gasified coal particles inside burner channel. Important stages during particle combustion, such as particle devolatilisation and char combustion, are described with satisfying accuracy in existing commercial CFD codes that are extensively used as powerful tool for pulverized coal combustion and gasification modeling. However, during plasma coal gasification, high plasma temperature induces strong thermal stresses inside interacting coal particles. These stresses lead to “thermal shock” and extensive particle fragmentation during which coal particles with initial size of 50 - 100 m disintegrate into fragments of at most 5 - 10 m. This intensifies volatile release by a factor 3 - 4 and substantially accelerates the oxidation of combustible matter. Particle fragmentation, due to its small size and thus limited influence on combustion process is commonly neglected in modelling. The main focus of this work is to suggest novel approach to pulverized coal gasification under high temperature conditions and to implement it into commercial comprehensive code ANSYS FLUENT 14. 0. Proposed model was validated against experimental data obtained in newly built pilot scale D. <b>C</b> plasma <b>burner</b> test facility.

40|$|In {{the present}} work, the thermal {{efficiency}} {{of a conventional}} domestic burner is studied both experimentally and numerically for liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) and piped natural gas (PNG) fuels. Three-dimensional computational fluid dynamic (CFD) modeling of the steady-state flow, combustion and heat transfer to the vessel is reported {{for the first time}} in such burners. Based on the insights from the CFD model concerning the flow and heat transfer, design modifications in the form of a circular insert and a radiant sheet are proposed which are observed to increase thermal efficiency for LPG. For PNG, predictions showed that loading height was a much more important factor affecting efficiency than these design modifications and an optimal loading height could be identified. Experiments confirm these trends by showing an improvement in burner thermal efficiency of 2. 5 % for LPG with the modified design, and 10 % for PNG with the optimal loading height, demonstrating that the CFD modeling approach developed in the present work is a useful tool to study domestic <b>burners.</b> (<b>C)</b> 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|WOS: 000337200700009 International audienceA {{sub-grid}} scale closure for Large Eddy Simulation (LES) of turbulent combustion {{based on}} physical-space filtering of laminar flames is discussed. Applied to an unstructured grid, the combustion LES filter size is not fixed {{in this novel}} approach devoted to LES with refined meshes, but calibrated depending {{on the local level}} of unresolved scalar fluctuations. The context is premixed or stratified flames, the derived model relies on four balance equations for mixture fraction and its variance, and a progress variable and its variance. The proposed formalism is based on a presumed probability density function (PDF) derived from the filtered flames. Closures for the terms of the equations that are unresolved over LES grids are achieved through the PDF. The method uses flamelet tabulated detailed chemistry and is first applied to the simulation of laminar flames (1 D and 2 D) over various grids for validation, before simulating a turbulent burner studied experimentally by Sweeney et al. (2012). Since this burner also features differential diffusion effects, the numerical model is modified to account for accumulation of carbon in the recirculation zone behind the bluff-body. A differential diffusion number based on the gradient of residence times is proposed, in an attempt to globally quantify differential diffusion effects in <b>burners.</b> (<b>C)</b> 2014 The Combustion Institute.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} numerical {{and experimental}} {{studies on the}} onset and evolution of laminar cellular flames of CH 4 /O- 2 /CO 2 (oxy-fuel) and CH 4 /air mixtures under adiabatic conditions, stabilized in the proximity of a flat-flame burner at atmospheric pressure. In the numerical simulations, a two-dimensional domain with periodicity at the transverse far field boundaries is resolved using a high accuracy finite difference method and employing a detailed chemical kinetic mechanism and detailed transport properties. In the experiments a specially designed adiabatic flat-flame burner, a so-called heat flux burner, is employed. A key parameter, the standoff distance between the flame front and the burner exit plate, is identified. A critical standoff distance is found, above which cellular flame instability is observed. It is shown that the critical standoff distance {{is closely related to}} the density ratio and the laminar flame thickness for each flame studied. The observed onset of cellular flames is governed by the hydrodynamic instability mechanism, which is generally suppressed by the burner when the flame is very close to the burner plate. Diffusive-thermal effects {{play an important role in}} the flame instability when the flame is far from the burner. The critical standoff distance has no clear correlation with the Lewis number, indicating a less significant effect of diffusive-thermal instability on the flames near the <b>burner.</b> (<b>c)</b> 2013 The Combustion Institute.

40|$|Thermionic {{cogeneration}} {{is developing}} {{as a new}} energy conservation option. The characteristics of ther-mionic systems using combustion of natural gas as heat source are studied. The – until now unused – high tempe-rature potential of fuels can be applied in order to extract work using the high temperature thermionic conversion process. The high temperature of the emitter and the re-quired large heat flux to it demand a high radiation tem-perature of the burner walls. As natural gas can only just reach these requirements the resulting system efficiency drops to an intolerable low level if the combustion air is not preheated and {{the heat from the}} flue gasses is not re-cuperated. An analytical study shows the effects of using the collector cooling air to preheat the combustion air and the influence of the heat exchanging capacities of the re-cuperator and the burner walls.
