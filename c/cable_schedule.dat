50|$|The {{project was}} {{launched}} in 2006. Scientific surveys and studies of the sea floor began soon after. The first submarine cable as also onshore cables was laid in 2008 and the first voltage tests were conducted. In 2009, the converter stations in Latina and Fiume Santo entered into operation. Laying of the second submarine <b>cable</b> was <b>scheduled</b> {{for the end of}} 2010. The submarine cable-laying activity was being carried out by the Giulio Verne, the largest cable-laying ship in the world. The cable was inaugurated on 17 March 2011.|$|R

40|$|Integrated Ocean Drilling Program (IODP) Expedition 328 {{was devoted}} to the {{installation}} of an "Advanced CORK" (Circulation Obviation Retrofit Kit) in the Cascadia subduction zone accretionary prism to observe the physical state and properties of the formation as they are influenced by long-term and episodic deformation and by gas hydrate accumulation. Pressures are monitored at four levels {{on the outside of}} a standard 10 3 / 4 -inch casing string, two above and two below the base of the gas-hydrate stability zone at 230 mbsf (m below seafloor). The casing was sealed at the bottom, leaving the inside open down to 302 mbsf for installation of a tilt meter, seismometer, and thermistor <b>cable</b> (<b>scheduled</b> for 2013). The initial data, recovered in July 2011, document an initially smooth recovery from the drilling perturbation followed by what may be a sequence of hole-collapse events. Pressure at the deepest screen is roughly 40 kPa above hydrostatic; higher pressures (80 kPa) are observed at the two screens close to the level of hydrate stability. Tidal variations at the deepest screen are in phase with ocean tides, and define a loading efficiency of 0. 6, which is reasonable in light of the consolidation state of the for-mation (porosity ~ 0. 5). Tidal signals near the level of gas hydrate stability display large phase lags, probably as a consequence of hydraulic diffusion stimulated by the large contrast in interstitial fluid compressibility at the gas-hydrate boundary. The degree of isolation among the screens, the anticipated good coupling, and the estimated strain-to-pressure conversion efficiency (~ 5 kPa μstrain − 1) indicate that this installation will serve well to host a variety of hydrologic, seismic, and geodynamic experiments. doi: 10. 2204 /iodp. sd. 13. 02. 2011 </a...|$|R

In order to {{accommodate}} such a time zone difference and maximize simultaneous substitution opportunities with the American stations carried on <b>cable,</b> CHNB's primetime <b>schedule</b> deviates from that of most other Global O&Os, with some shows airing earlier in the evening, and occasionally on different nights, compared to other Global stations.

50|$|A final risk of {{structural}} failure {{comes from the}} possibility of vibrational harmonics within the cable. Like the shorter and more familiar strings of stringed musical instruments, the cable of a space elevator has a natural resonant frequency. If the cable is excited at this frequency, for example by the travel of elevators up and down it, the vibrational energy could build up to dangerous levels and exceed the cable's tensile strength. This can be avoided {{by the use of}} suitable damping systems within the <b>cable,</b> and by <b>scheduling</b> travel up and down the cable keeping its resonant frequency in mind. It may be possible to dampen the resonant frequency against the Earth's magnetosphere.|$|R
50|$|Augusta National {{has placed}} {{significant}} {{restrictions on the}} tournament's broadcast hours compared to other major championships, perhaps to increase the tournament's ratings, or to reward ticket-holders. Only {{in the 21st century}} did the tournament allow CBS to air 18-hole coverage of the leaders, a standard at the other three majors. Only three hours of <b>cable</b> coverage is <b>scheduled</b> for the early rounds each day (CBS has a highlights package that airs in late night on Thursday and Fridays during the tournament). International broadcasters do not receive additional coverage, although they may take commercial breaks at different times from CBS or ESPN.

50|$|The CW {{was created}} in September 2006 when CBS Corporation and Time Warner decided to merge the {{respective}} programming assets of the United Paramount Network (UPN) and The WB, both of which launched in January 1995, with The CW also drawing from the latter's broadcast and <b>cable</b> assets and <b>scheduling</b> model (The WB's online assets remained separate, although its former web domain - which was revamped as a streaming service - was shut down in December 2013 and replaced with a promotional website for Warner Bros. Television programs). All in all, the U.S. broadcasting landscape dramatically evolved towards a conglomeratization of players - an effect also called concentration of media ownership, which describes the narrowing of competition in modern television broadcasting.|$|R

40|$|A {{scheduling}} {{method for}} a single machine scheduling problem with sequence dependent setup times is presented where similar products produced on the machine can be partitioned into families. A two-stage traveling salesman heuristic procedure is developed. In the first stage an n x n symmetric setup time matrix is generated for n products and the products are classified into families (groups) using either a hierarchical cluster analysis procedure or the users internal groupings. A Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) is then solved to obtain an efficient sequence for each family. In the second stage, a special purpose traveling salesman heuristic is developed to combine the already sequenced families in an efficient way. The results of the computational study show that the Two-Stage Traveling Salesman procedure is approximately two to four {{times faster than the}} well known TSP heuristic by Lin and Kernighan, while the solution quality is comparable to Lin and Kernighan's heuristic. The paper also illustrates an industrial application of the procedure for an automated <b>cable</b> assembly machine. <b>scheduling</b> Traveling Salesman Problem sequence dependent setup times branch and bound...|$|R
40|$|This {{full text}} paper was peer {{reviewed}} {{at the direction}} of IEEE Communications Society subject matter experts for publication in the IEEE ICC 2011 proceedingsNowadays wireless sensor networks (WSNs) have attracted a great deal of study due to their low cost and widerange applications. Most of the sensors used so far are point sensors which have a disc-shaped sensing region. In this paper, we study a new type of sensor: the fiber optic cable sensor. Unlike a traditional point sensor, this type of sensor has a rectangular sensing region with a processor installed on it to do processing and communication. Like wireless sensor networks with point sensors, energy-efficient communication is still an important issue in wireless sensor networks with cable sensors because of the need to efficiently use limited resources. To address the issue, we propose a Cable Mode Transition (CMT) algorithm, which determines the minimal number of active sensors to maintain Kcoverage of a terrain as well as K-connectivity of the network. Specifically, it allocates periods of inactivity for cable sensors without affecting the coverage and connectivity requirements of the network based only on local information. Before presenting CMT, we first show the relationship between coverage and connectivity, then the eligibility algorithm permitting a cable sensor to decide whether to stay active. CMT calls the eligibility algorithm to <b>schedule</b> <b>cables.</b> Simulation results show that our scheme is efficient in saving energy and thus can prolong the lifetime of wireless cable sensor networks. supported by NSF grant CBET 072969...|$|R
40|$|General Mitchell International Airport (MKE) {{located in}} Milwaukee, WI, has many {{man-made}} perching sites used by hawks. Several {{of these sites}} {{need to be addressed}} to improve air operations safety because of the preference by redtailed hawks. The first perching sites addressed at MKE were six lamp posts {{at the base of the}} 128 th Air Refueling Wing of the Wisconsin Air National Guard, which were used daily by red-tailed hawks. In order to mitigate the perching, umbrella skeletons (Daddi Long Legs™ or Bird Spider™) were recommended to be attached to the top of each lamp post. After installation of the skeletons, perching was reduced from daily to none. The effectiveness of the skeletons on the lamp posts led to a consultation with FAA technicians to request the skeletons be placed on top of several pieces of FAA equipment (i. e., glide slope towers). During these same meetings, the technicians stated plastic cable ties could be used on the antennae and obstruction lights on the glide slopes as a deterrent for red-tailed hawk perching. It has been commonly mentioned that these devices cannot be installed because of interference with sensitive equipment; therefore, an evaluation was conducted. Cable ties and an umbrella skeleton were attached to one of three glide slopes and a flight check was conducted to determine if these devices might interfere with equipment operation. Anti-perching equipment did not interfere with glide slope operation; therefore, an umbrella skeleton and <b>cable</b> ties are <b>scheduled</b> to be placed on one additional glide slope at MKE. There are ongoing adjustments for cable tie spacing and required number for effectiveness but these devices have reduced the perching area used be red-tailed hawks at MKE. Further research is necessary to determine longevity, effectiveness, and potential interference issues of these devices...|$|R
