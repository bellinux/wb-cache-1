The secondary habitability factors are both geological (the role of surface water in sustaining necessary plate tectonics) and biochemical (the role of radiant energy in supporting photosynthesis for necessary atmospheric oxygenation). But others, such as Ian Stewart and Jack Cohen in their 2002 book Evolving the Alien argue that complex intelligent life may arise outside the CHZ. Intelligent life outside the CHZ may have evolved in subsurface environments, from alternative biochemistries or even from nuclear reactions.|$|E

500|$|The most <b>critical</b> <b>factors</b> in {{flowering}} {{and fruit}} set are physiological, {{having to do}} with the age of the plant and whether it already has developing fruit.

When a plant already has a fruit developing, subsequent female flowers on the plant are less likely to mature, a phenomenon called [...] "first-fruit dominance", and male flowers are more frequent, an effect that appears due to reduced natural ethylene production within the plant stem. Ethephon, a plant growth regulator product that is converted to ethylene after metabolism by the plant, can be used to increase fruit and seed production.|$|E

500|$|Regarding {{the look}} {{and nature of the}} film's cinematography, Giaimo was greatly {{influenced}} by Jack Cardiff's work in Black Narcissus. According to him, it lent a hyper-reality to the film: [...] "Because this is a movie with such scale and we have the Norwegian fjords to draw from, I really wanted to explore the depth. From a design perspective, since I was stressing the horizontal and vertical aspects, and what the fjords provide, it was perfect. We encased the sibling story in scale." [...] Ted D. McCord's work in The Sound of Music was another major influence for Giaimo. It was also Giaimo's idea that Frozen should be filmed in the CinemaScope aspect ratio, which was approved by Lasseter. This marked Frozen the first film to be completely shot in CinemaScope since 2000's Titan A.E.. Giaimo also wanted to ensure that Norway's fjords, architecture and rosemaling folk art, were <b>critical</b> <b>factors</b> in designing the environment of Arendelle. Giaimo, whose background is in traditional animation, said that the art design environment represents a unity of character and environment and that he originally wanted to incorporate saturated colors, which is typically ill-advised in computer animation. For further authenticity, a live reindeer named Sage was brought into the studio for animators to study its movements and mannerisms for the character Sven.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{reports on}} {{research}} {{carried out in}} the hotel sector of the Irish hospitality industry on <b>critical</b> success <b>factors</b> and their impact on performance management and measurement. The paper outlines the industry context and reviews the literature on <b>critical</b> success <b>factors.</b> This literature presents a discussion of the concept of <b>critical</b> success <b>factors</b> (CSFs) in the context of performance measurement and the hospitality industry, which are considered necessary for organisational prosperity because of the impact they have on the organisation’s potential performance. <b>Critical</b> success <b>factors</b> are those factors capable of providing the greatest competitive leverage upon which resources should be focused. According to Brotherton, (2004 :a; 2004 :b) <b>critical</b> success <b>factors</b> are those factors capable of providing the greatest competitive leverage upon which resources should be focused. For example, Flanagan (2005) has identified a <b>critical</b> success <b>factor</b> as a position where the organisation’s pricing is considered to be in the realms of competitive pricing and where the organisation’s technical capability can match or outstrip competition. Brotherton, (2004 :a; 2004 :b) considers <b>critical</b> success <b>factors</b> to be combinations of activities and processes designed to support achievement of such desired outcomes specified by the company’s objectives or goals. Consequently, they can be partially controlled by management and thus can potentially be managed. This is further developed in the paper. <b>Critical</b> success <b>factors</b> emerge from a number of aspects of the organisation’s operating context, such as its competitive strategy (Said et al., 2003; Farmer, 2004), stage of the product life cycle (Andersen, Cobbols and Lawrie, 2001; Hoque and James, 2000), size (Hoque and James, 2000), culture, values and beliefs (Neely, 2004; Rejc, 2005), cost structure, management style, location, position, competitor activity, financial strength (Flanagan, 2005). The paper will set out examples of the <b>critical</b> success <b>factors</b> that have emerged from relevant research {{carried out in the}} national and international hospitality industry in this field. In order to investigate the phenomenon of performance measurement in hotels, empirical research was carried out with hotel managers, owners and operators of hotels in Ireland. This research included research into <b>critical</b> success <b>factors</b> in hotels. The research into the <b>critical</b> success <b>factors</b> was carried out with focus groups and a series of in-depth interviews conducted with managers and owners of small and medium-sized independently owned hotels. The focus group methodology was chosen to investigate in depth the types of <b>critical</b> success <b>factors</b> owners perceived to be important to them. The focus group stage of the research offered the opportunity to investigate these phenomena of performance measurement and <b>critical</b> success <b>factors.</b> Three focus group interviews were conducted with 8 – 10 people in each group. The in-depth interviews offered the opportunity to carry out an analysis of the <b>critical</b> success <b>factors</b> of a number of hotels and to investigate why these operators considered these to be <b>critical</b> success <b>factors</b> and if any success factors were unique to a particular organisation. Five case studies were carried out with owners / managers of independently owned hotels in Ireland. The research found {{that there are a number}} of <b>critical</b> success <b>factors</b> that are common to all the hotels. However, the research highlights that a number of these <b>critical</b> success <b>factors</b> are difficult to measure in terms of performance management. This commonality of <b>critical</b> success <b>factors</b> is somewhat unusual, as it could have been expected that different hotels had different success factors that were unique to their own operation. This commonality is a significant finding and suggests that <b>critical</b> success <b>factors</b> can be included in a hotel specific model for performance measurement. The research also shows that hotel operators recognise their <b>critical</b> success <b>factors</b> although they may not be using the benefits these factors bring to their organisation as a strategic tool. Although there were a number of common <b>critical</b> success <b>factors,</b> each interviewee also identified factors that they perceived to be critical to the success of their individual operation. These factors are highlighted in the paper. Work in this area to date has not been able to draw any commonality among the <b>critical</b> success <b>factors</b> in any other sector researched so far. In addition, the primary research reported here provides evidence of a discernible link between <b>critical</b> success <b>factors,</b> industry context and performance measurement. Thus, performance management and performance measurement aligned with <b>critical</b> success <b>factors</b> is a complex and under-researched activity of hotel management...|$|R

2500|$|Avalanches {{can only}} {{occur in a}} {{standing}} snowpack. Typically winter seasons at high latitudes, high altitudes, or both, have weather that is sufficiently unsettled, and cold enough for precipitated snow to accumulate into a seasonal snowpack. Continentality, through its potentiating influence on the meteorological extremes experienced by snowpacks, {{is an important factor}} in the evolution of instabilities, and consequential occurrence of avalanches. Conversely, proximity to coastal environments moderates the meteorological extremes experienced by snowpacks, and results in a faster stabilization of the snowpack after storm cycles. [...] The evolution of the snowpack is critically sensitive to small variations within the narrow range of meteorological conditions that allow for the accumulation of snow into a snowpack. Among the <b>critical</b> <b>factors</b> controlling snowpack evolution are: heating by the sun, radiational cooling, vertical temperature gradients in standing snow, snowfall amounts, and snow types. Generally, mild winter weather will promote the settlement and stabilization of the snowpack; and conversely very cold, windy, or hot weather will weaken the snowpack.|$|E
