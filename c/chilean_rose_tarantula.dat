2500|$|Large spiders used in Hollywood movies (e.g., Indiana Jones series, The Mummy Returns) {{are often}} Brachypelma hamorii or Brachypelma emilia {{because they are}} very docile, though the much less {{expensive}} and only moderately more aggressive <b>Chilean</b> <b>rose</b> <b>tarantula</b> is frequently used, as well. [...] While it is almost unheard of for a Brachypelma to bite a human, they are quick to kick urticating hairs in self-defense, though their hairs can be less irritating than those of other species, especially the goliath birdeater.|$|E
2500|$|Reaction and {{the degree}} of {{irritation}} to a defensive urticating hair barrage can vary tremendously, based on the species in question. [...] Some, such as those of the <b>Chilean</b> <b>rose</b> <b>tarantula</b> (Grammastola rosea) and the Pinktoe tarantula (Avicularia avicularia), are fairly mild and innocuous to humans. [...] Others, such as those of the Brazilian giant white knee tarantula (Acanthoscurria geniculata), are moderately irritating. [...] Still others, such as the Goliath Birdeater (Theraphosa blondi), are far more severe. [...] These hairs can result in painful rashes, and have been likened to sharp shards of fiberglass.|$|E

50|$|Reptiles and {{invertebrates}} {{at the zoo}} include Madagascan hissing cockroaches, royal pythons, two-spot assassin bugs, giant African land snails, bearded dragons, rainbow boas, Mexican redknee tarantulas, leopard geckos, Honduran milk snakes, <b>Chilean</b> <b>rose</b> <b>tarantulas,</b> curly-haired tarantulas, and Tanzanian red-legged millipedes.|$|R
50|$|These spiders are {{medium to}} large {{in size and}} usually brown in color, with pinkish or orangish-red hairs. The very docile <b>Chilean</b> <b>rose</b> <b>{{tarantula}}s</b> (Grammostola rosea and Grammostola porteri) are popular as a beginner's spider among tarantula enthusiasts.|$|R
50|$|Sun beetle, leaf insects, Mcklay's spectre, giant thorny stick insect, orange headed cockroaches, Indian {{ornamental}} tarantula, Brazilian black tarantula, <b>Chilean</b> <b>rose</b> <b>tarantula,</b> tailless whip scorpion, and tiger land snails.|$|E
5000|$|These three toxins are {{structurally}} similar peptides of 29-32 {{amino acids}} [...] They show sequence similarity to Hanatoxins, {{which can be}} isolated from the venom of the <b>Chilean</b> <b>rose</b> <b>tarantula</b> Grammostola rosea [...]|$|E
50|$|Phrixotoxins are peptide toxins {{derived from}} the venom of the Chilean copper {{tarantula}} Phrixotrichus auratus, also named Paraphysa scrofa. Phrixotoxin-1 and -2 block A-type voltage-gated potassium channels; phrixotoxin-3 blocks voltage-gated sodium channels. Similar toxins are found in other species, for instance the <b>Chilean</b> <b>rose</b> <b>tarantula.</b>|$|E
25|$|Dublin Zoo's Reptile House {{was opened}} in 1876. It {{features}} reptiles such as West African crocodiles, Gila monsters, veiled chameleons, pancake tortoises, leopard tortoises, plated lizards, Bell's hinge-back tortoises, Burmese pythons, Asian leaf turtles, Asian water monitors and East African black mud turtles, {{as well as}} invertebrates such as Macleay's spectres and <b>Chilean</b> <b>rose</b> <b>tarantulas.</b>|$|R

50|$|The {{education}} {{building houses}} reptiles, arachnids, amphibians, and one emperor scorpion. Species of reptiles include bearded dragon, red-tailed boa, ball python, blue-tongued skink, and European glass lizard. Two amphibian species are on display, the Amazon milky tree frog and the African bullfrog. There are {{two species of}} arachnids, the <b>Chilean</b> <b>rose</b> hair <b>tarantula</b> and the orange baboon tarantula.|$|R
5000|$|Spider {{potassium}} channel inhibitory toxins is {{another group of}} spider toxins. A representative of this group is hanatoxin, a 35 amino acid peptide toxin which was isolated from <b>Chilean</b> <b>rose</b> <b>tarantula</b> (Grammostola rosea, syn. G. spatulata) venom. It inhibits the drk1 voltage-gated {{potassium channel}} by altering the energetics of gating. See also Huwentoxin-1 [...]|$|E
50|$|Gadolinium (Gd3+) {{and other}} {{lanthanides}} {{have been shown}} to block stretch-activated ion channel function. The peptide toxin isolated from the <b>Chilean</b> <b>rose</b> <b>tarantula</b> (Grammostola spatulata), mechanotoxin 4 (GsMTx4) has been shown to inhibit these channels from the extracellular side, but it does not inhibit all stretch-activated ion channels and particularly has no effect on 2p channels.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Chilean</b> <b>rose</b> <b>{{tarantula}}</b> (Grammostola rosea), {{also known}} as the rose hair tarantula, the Chilean fire tarantula, or the Chilean red-haired tarantula (depending on the color morph), is probably the most common species of tarantula available in American and European pet stores today, due to the large number of wild-caught specimens exported cheaply from their native Chile into the pet trade. The species is also known from Bolivia and Argentina.|$|E

25|$|During {{colonial times}} in the 18th century, an {{important}} flux of emigrants from Spain populated Chile, mostly Basques, who vitalized the <b>Chilean</b> economy and <b>rose</b> rapidly in the social hierarchy and became the political elite that still dominates the country. An estimated 1.6 million (10%) to 3.2 million (20%) Chileans have a surname (one or both) of Basque origin. The Basques liked Chile because of its great similarity to their native land: similar geography, cool climate, {{and the presence of}} fruits, seafood, and wine.|$|R
40|$|We have {{recently}} proposed that ORAC (Oxygen Radical Absorbance Capacity) methods employing fluorescein (ORAC-FL) and pyrogallol red (ORAC-PGR) as target molecules {{could be considered}} as complementary indexes. In particular, the ratio ORAC-PGR/ORAC-FL would reflect the average quality of the antioxidants present in a particular sample. In the present work, we evaluated the antioxidant capacity and the total phenol content of twelve <b>Chilean</b> wines (red, <b>rose,</b> and white) employing ORAC and Folin-Ciocalteau methods, respectively. Red wines showed higher Folin and ORAC values than rose and white wines. However, the ORAC-PGR/ORAC-FL ratio of all tested wines was close to 0. 5. The results show {{that it is important}} to consider both, the phenol content of the sample (measured by ORAC-FL or Folin indexes) and their average reactivity (measured by the ORAC-PGR/ORAC-FL ratio). Both factors are considered relevant in the evaluation of the antioxidant capacity of wines...|$|R

5000|$|The <b>Chilean</b> <b>rose</b> <b>tarantula</b> (Grammostola rosea) is {{a common}} pet, its {{behavior}} being generally docile and its venom very mild. It needs {{to be kept dry}} and dislikes being wet (its natural habitat being one of the driest deserts on earth). If the substrate is too wet, it will stand [...] "on tiptoes" [...] in discomfort, or climb the sides of its enclosure, risking fall and injury. It feeds on other invertebrates. Its attributes and care {{are similar to those of}} its relative the Chaco golden knee tarantula (Grammostola pulchripes).|$|E
40|$|Objective {{indicators}} {{suggest that}} {{economic and political}} conditions improved in Chile between the countryâ€™s democratization in 1990 and 2011. Average incomes increased, poverty rates decreased, {{and the number of}} positive reviews of <b>Chilean</b> democratic institutions <b>rose.</b> Despite this progress, massive student-led protest waves in 2006 and 2011 demonstrated high levels of subjective discontent in Chile. This paper proposes a three-part explanation for the paradoxical emergence and escalation of the post-Pinochet-era Chilean student protests, and, in so doing, contributes to the broader understanding of social movements and political action. The first two parts of the argument relate to generational change. Firstly, a gap between expectations and capabilities provoked discontent amongst a new generation of Chilean students. Secondly, the new generationâ€™s collective identity as â€œla generaciÃ³n sin miedoâ€ (the fearless generation) motivated the students to turn discontent into political action. Thirdly, government and student actor agency influenced the variance in protest strength between 2005 and 2011...|$|R
5000|$|John Pascoe Grenfell {{was born}} in Battersea, Surrey on 20 September 1800 to John Maugham Grenfell and his wife Sophia Turner. In 1811 he entered {{the service of the}} British East India Company, and in 1819 he joined the Chilean Navy under Lord Cochrane. He took part in most of the {{conflicts}} undertaken by Lord Cochrane during the War of <b>Chilean</b> Independence, and <b>rose</b> to the rank of lieutenant. On 5 November 1820 Grenfell took part in the cutting out of the frigate Esmeralda and the following year in the pursuit of the Venganza and Prueba, the last major Spanish warships in the South Pacific. In 1823, he followed Lord Cochrane to Brazil, to fight in the Brazilian War of Independence. In August 1823, Grenfell now a Commander in the small brig Dom Miguel sailed to Belem do Pará and using a similar tactic used by Lord Cochrane at Maranham, persuaded the Portuguese forces to surrender by making them think a larger fleet was in the offing. [...] During the war with Argentina in 1826, he commanded the brig Caboclo as part of the squadron blockading Buenos Aires under (British) Commodore James Norton. On 29 July, while engaged in a ship-to-ship engagement with the Argentine commander, Admiral William Brown, he lost his right arm. He then returned to England to recuperate.|$|R
5000|$|Containing {{many animals}} {{previously}} kept in Pets' Corner, this area opened in 2009 and contains many exotic and familiar mammals, birds, reptiles and insects. There are small areas for striped skunk, ferrets, chickens, guinea pigs, cockatoos, Indian runner ducks, Hermann's tortoises, pancake tortoise, spur-thighed tortoise, iguanas, armadillos, rock hyraxes, and a fennec fox. An undercover area houses a regular Parrot show, where keepers demonstrate {{the intelligence of}} the resident macaws. Next door is a walk-through butterfly house, home to a large variety of the species, which replaced an older butterfly house built in the 1980s. Inside the main building is the Animal Handling Hall, where visitors can {{get a chance to}} hold a variety of creatures such as a <b>Chilean</b> <b>rose</b> <b>tarantula</b> or a corn snake, or even get up close to a selection of reptiles. Secretary bird can also be found in a aviary ...|$|E
50|$|A further {{addition}} {{which opened}} in 2011 was the education centre which was created as a renovation of the old soft bill aviary. The pheasants and kookaburras which lived in the soft bill aviary were {{moved to a new}} pheasantry along the front of the tropical house, while a group of Old English Game fowl from the building now join the other free roaming animals (including peafowl, helmeted guineafowl, silver pheasant, chicken and Parma wallaby). This new centre houses a hands on animal encounter hall in which both schools and general visitors are given the chance to hold bearded dragons, corn snake and a <b>Chilean</b> <b>rose</b> <b>tarantula,</b> while being given an educational talk about them. On the adjoining side there is also a museum which displays a variety of items which have been seized by HM customs at Heathrow Airport and donated to the park, a display of tribal artefacts (including genuine weaponry, tattoo kits and replica shrunken heads), displays of bones, feathers, eggs and fossils, along with an alligator skin which visitors are able to touch.|$|E
40|$|Protein toxins from venomous animals exhibit remarkably {{specific}} and selective interactions {{with a wide}} variety of ion channels. Hanatoxin and grammotoxin are two related protein toxins found in the venom of the <b>Chilean</b> <b>Rose</b> <b>Tarantula,</b> Phrixotrichus spatulata. Hanatoxin inhibits voltage-gated K+ channels and grammotoxin inhibits voltage-gated Ca 2 + channels. Both toxins inhibit their respective channels by interfering with normal operation of the voltage-dependent gating mechanism. The sequence homology of hanatoxin and grammotoxin, as well as their similar mechanism of action, raises the possibility that they interact with the same region of voltage-gated Ca 2 + and K+ channels. Here, we show that each toxin can interact with both voltage-gated Ca 2 + and K+ channels and modify channel gating. Moreover, mutagenesis of voltage-gated K+ channels suggests that hanatoxin and grammotoxin recognize the same structural motif. We propose that these toxins recognize a voltage-sensing domain or module present in voltage-gated ion channels and that this domain has a highly conserved three-dimensional structure...|$|E
