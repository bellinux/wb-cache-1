40|$|In {{this paper}} we study the role <b>of</b> {{convertible}} <b>securities</b> in {{the financing of}} start-up enterprises when the entrepreneurs are better informed than the venture capitalists (VCs). We demonstrate that for a well-designed contract the <b>conversion</b> ratio <b>of</b> the <b>securities</b> {{can be used as}} a signaling device to overcome the problem of information asymmetry. If the variability of the return is sufficiently large, the entrepreneurs will find it desirable to rely on convertible securities with the conversion ratio revealing part of his information, that is, a ”separating equilibrium” will arise. Such an equilibrium has the advantage of avoiding the incentive constraints that appear in the other ”pooling equilibrium”, in which the privately held information is not revealed. We show that the time-lag of decisions between investment and conversion will also benefit the VCs, with the extra return as the ”time value”. In addition, we study the impact of introducing ”technical shares” with which the entrepreneurs are awarded equity shares without investment outlays. We compare the different financing devices with convertible securities and explain why convertible securities have become the most commonly used financial instrument for start-up enterprises.

40|$|When a {{convertible}} debt instrument {{is converted to}} equity securities, sometimes the terms <b>of</b> <b>conversion</b> provide that any accrued but unpaid interest at the date <b>of</b> <b>conversion</b> is forfeited by the former debt holder. This occurs either because the conversion date falls between interest payment dates or {{because there are no}} interest payment dates (a zero coupon convertible instrument). The issues are (1) whether interest expense should be accrued or imputed to the date <b>of</b> <b>conversion</b> when such forfeiture occurs and (2) if interest is accrued through the date <b>of</b> <b>conversion,</b> how the forfeited interest should be recorded upon <b>conversion</b> <b>of</b> the debt instrument. EITF DISCUSSION The Task Force reached a consensus that interest should be accrued or imputed to the date <b>of</b> <b>conversion</b> <b>of</b> the debt instrument.

40|$|Using U. S. {{securities}} {{markets as}} a case history, the author explores the role securities markets play in economic development, how they emerge, and how regulation can make them more effective. Why the United States? Two centuries ago, {{it was a small}} undeveloped country with serious financial problems. It confronted those problems and, guided by Alexander Hamilton, creatively reformed its financial system, which then became a foundation of the U. S. economic infrastructure and a bulwark for long-term growth. When Hamilton's program established public credit and securitiesmarkets in the 1790 s, U. S. citizens were immediately able to borrow from older, richer countries. U. S. wealth then increased until, {{by the end of the}} nineteenth century, U. S. residents began to lend and invest more abroad than they borrowed. During the 1820 s and 1830 s, the United States (usually state governments) borrowed large sums from foreign investors to build roads, canals, and early railroads, to make other transportation improvements, and to capitalize state banks. From the 1830 s to the end of the century, still larger sums from overseas went into private U. S. railway companies that provided cheap transcontinental transportation. Most of this borrowing took the form of state and corporate bond sales to overseas investors. The pristine U. S. government credit established by Hamilton thus rubbed off on U. S. state and corporate debt. The British stock market did better than the U. S. market until the United States adopted security-market regulation (including disclosuire rules) under the SEC. Then the U. S. market became a world leader. The U. S. stock market developed more slowly than the bond market, but it both aided and benefited from foreign investment in U. S. bonds. Foreign investors preferred debt securities to equities, yet equities create a safety margin for bondholders who, because of this margin, are more willing to purchase and hold bonds. Foreign investors preferred bonds; U. S. investors, after exporting bonds, held more stocks than bonds at home. Why? Because good stock markets permit the <b>conversion</b> <b>of</b> equity <b>securities</b> into cash.
