50|$|The Air Raid Precautions (ARP) Department {{was created}} in 1935 to ensure that local {{authorities}} and other employers co-operated with central government. <b>Canals</b> <b>on</b> <b>embankments</b> through low-lying or built up areas such as London were identified as being particularly vulnerable to bombing and sabotage. At the very least resultant flooding would endanger lives, disrupt transport interchanges at King's Cross and Paddington and endanger factories in the Thames Valley.|$|R

50|$|Large {{volumes of}} stored water have {{considerable}} destructive potential and where {{structures such as}} <b>canals</b> run <b>on</b> <b>embankments</b> above low lying built up areas or where aqueducts exist, appropriate safety precautions were taken either as a war time contingency or {{at the time of}} construction. These 'Canal Safety Gates' or 'Canal Air Raid Protection Gates (ARPG)' were constructed and installed in regard to the scale of the danger posed and ranged from simple wooden planks known as 'Stop Gates' or 'Stop Planks' to more massive constructions built of concrete and steel such as the safety gates built on the Forth and Clyde Canal near Stockingfield Junction and on the Glasgow Branch at Firhill Road and Craighall Road.|$|R
2500|$|Phase 1 of the {{restoration}} involved the first [...] {{of the canal}} from Bulbourne Junction (...) to Little Tring Farm (...) [...] Major engineering work included the refurbishment of the stop lock, {{and the construction of}} a winding basin at the terminus, to allow boats to turn round. Between the two, Little Tring Road crossed the course of the <b>canal</b> <b>on</b> an <b>embankment</b> which was constructed in 1973 when the original bridge was demolished. This was replaced by a new reinforced concrete bridge, built to a traditional design, which is faced with bricks to give it an authentic appearance. It was funded by the Wendover Arm Trust, and the award-winning bridge was completed by British Waterways in 2000–01 at a cost of £223,000.|$|R
50|$|Because of the {{low level}} of the Fens landscape, the <b>canal</b> was {{constructed}} <b>on</b> <b>embankments</b> for most of its 5.25 mile (8.4 km) length, and was opened in 1797. Flood locks were constructed {{at both ends of the}} canal. The one at Outwell was 97 ft long, but the one at Wisbech was only 50 ft, and so longer boats wishing to enter or leave the canal at the Wisbech end had to wait for the levels in the river and the canal to equalise, at which point both sets of gates could be opened. The canal did not have its own water supply, but was refilled when the water level in the Nene at Wisbech was high enough. This was normally only at spring tides, and so the water level often ran low in the period before the next spring tide was due.|$|R
50|$|Pelsall Road Bridge {{carries the}} B4154 Lime Lane over the canal. A little further {{north on the}} east bank were the two basins which served Conduit Colliery. A tramway, which ran in a north-easterly direction, was built to connect the {{colliery}} to the basins. The next crossing is Watling Street, now the A5 road, and the modern canal ends here. Beyond, much of the <b>canal</b> was <b>on</b> high <b>embankments,</b> raised to combat subsidence, but traffic no longer justified the costs of maintenance, and the northerly section was closed in 1963. The next bridge was Northgreen Bridge, beyond which there was a wharf, and {{the first of several}} large brick overflow weirs. After New Road Bridge, located where the modern M6 Toll motorway crosses the course of the canal, and Foredrove Bridge, the junction with the Norton Springs Branch was marked by a large basin to the east of the canal.|$|R

5|$|During December 1914, O'Leary saw heavy {{fighting}} with the Irish Guards and was Mentioned in Despatches and subsequently promoted to Lance Corporal on 5 January 1915. Three weeks later, on 30 January, the Irish Guards were ordered to prepare for an attack on German positions near Cuinchy on the La Bassée Canal, {{a response to a}} successful German operation in the area five days before. The Germans attacked first however, and on the morning of 1 February seized a stretch of <b>canal</b> <b>embankment</b> <b>on</b> the western end of the 2nd Brigade line from a company of Coldstream Guards. This section, known as the Hollow, was tactically important as it defended a culvert that passed underneath a railway embankment. 4 Company of Irish Guards, originally in reserve, were tasked with joining the Coldstream Guards in retaking the position at 04:00, but the attack was met with heavy machine gun fire and most of the assault party, including all of the Irish Guards officers, were killed or wounded.|$|R

50|$|The {{construction}} of the Manchester Ship Canal, which was to cross the line between Partington and , meant that the railway had to be raised by 43 ft {{in order to give}} a 75 ft clearance for shipping. A new line, parallel to the old but slightly to the south-west, was built <b>on</b> <b>embankments</b> formed using the soil excavated from the new canal; it included the new Cadishead Viaduct. The new line was brought into use for goods traffic on 27 February 1893; a new Partington station was built on that line, and passenger traffic was transferred from the old line to the new on 29 May 1893, in plenty of time for the opening of the Ship <b>Canal</b> <b>on</b> 1 January 1894. The new station was 191 mi from London St Pancras, and 26 mi from Liverpool Central.|$|R

40|$|Pollinating insect populations, {{essential}} for maintaining wild plant diversity and agricultural productivity, rely on (semi) natural habitats. An increasing human population is encroaching upon and deteriorating pollinator habitats. Thus the population persistence of pollinating insects and their associated ecosystem services may depend upon on man-made novel habitats; however, their importance for ecosystem services is barely understood. We tested if man-made infrastructure (railway embankments) in an agricultural landscape establishes novel habitats that support large populations of pollinators (bees, butterflies, hoverflies) {{when compared to}} typical habitats for these insects, i. e., semi-natural grasslands. We also identified key environmental factors affecting the species richness and abundance of pollinators <b>on</b> <b>embankments.</b> Species richness and abundance of bees and butterflies were higher for railway embankments than for grasslands. The occurrence of bare (non-vegetated) ground <b>on</b> <b>embankments</b> positively affected bee species richness and abundance, but negatively affected butterfly populations. Species richness and abundance of butterflies positively depended on species richness of native plants <b>on</b> <b>embankments,</b> whereas bee species richness was positively affected by species richness of non-native flowering plants. The density of shrubs <b>on</b> <b>embankments</b> negatively affected the number of bee species and their abundance. Bee and hoverfly species richness were positively related to wood cover in a landscape surrounding embankments. This is the first study showing that railway embankments constitute valuable habitat {{for the conservation of}} pollinators in farmland. Specific conservation strategies involving <b>embankments</b> should focus <b>on</b> preventing habitat deterioration due to encroachment of dense shrubs and maintaining grassland vegetation with patches of bare ground...|$|R
