5|$|He faced {{a similar}} <b>challenge</b> <b>with</b> the impoverished bishopric of Argyll in the 1240s. He {{was given the}} job of {{restoring}} {{the viability of the}} diocese and installing a new bishop; this involved forming a close relationship with King Alexander II of Scotland. Clement was with the king during his campaign in Argyll in 1249 and was at his side when he died during this campaign. In 1250 Clement had been able to install a new bishop in Argyll and had become one of the Guardians appointed to govern Scotland during the minority of King Alexander III. By 1250 he had established {{a reputation as one of}} the most active Dominican reformers in Britain. Clement helped to elevate Edmund of Abingdon and Queen Margaret to sainthood.

5|$|In these stanzas, Donne {{compares the}} parting of two lovers to a death, {{desiring}} the lovers' parting to be quiet, without struggle, and voluntary {{even though it}} is inevitable. At the same time, he considers the separation of lovers to be equivalent to the soul separating from the body on death. Ramie Targoff argues that this is not because he sees the separation of the lovers as permanent, like death, but that as with death Donne finds the <b>challenge</b> <b>with</b> separation to be ensuring the relationship's continuity in the future.|$|E

In the 78th minute of the game, Canada was leading, 3–2, when the referee ruled that McLeod had held the ball {{for more than six}} seconds, going by a rule that is rarely enforced, and gave an indirect free kick inside the penalty area to the United States. McLeod faced no <b>challenge</b> <b>with</b> the free kick; however, the referee then called a penalty after the ball struck Canadian player Marie-Eve Nault on the arm. American striker Abby Wambach took the penalty kick, and it went past McLeod. The match went into extra time, with Alex Morgan heading in the ball past McLeod's fingertips in the 123rd minute, resulting in a win for the United States.|$|E

He said that the biggest <b>challenge</b> <b>with</b> that was to make the gameplay and story work together; the goal was to make the player feel like they have driven the story forward themselves, with their own choices, even though the game is linear. He only spent little time on writing a backstory for Phoenix before writing the first game's story, and instead made up dialogue and developed Phoenix's personality as he went along. He came up with the partner character Maya because he thought it would be more fun for players to have another character with them, giving them advice, than investigating on their own.|$|E

5|$|Arsenal {{in their}} usual home strip of red shirts and white shorts {{kicked off the}} match and {{immediately}} won a corner, which was dealt with by Westerveld. A run by Heskey six minutes later resulted in the player taking a tumble under Gilles Grimandi's challenge, but his appeals for a penalty were ignored by referee Dunn. Arsenal began to dominate play, with Vieira {{at the heart of}} their best moves. The midfielder won a <b>challenge</b> <b>with</b> Heskey in the 17th minute and sent the ball in the direction of Fredrik Ljungberg, who in turn passed it to Henry. The Frenchman went around Westerveld and shot the ball goalwards, which was cleared off the line by Stéphane Henchoz. Television replays later showed the ball hitting Henchoz's arm before going wide; although Henry appealed for a penalty, it was turned down as the incident was missed by both the referee and his assistant. Owen came close to scoring in the 20th minute, but for his shot to be blocked by Martin Keown. Arsenal continued to find the best openings, but struggled to split open the Liverpool defence. A long range effort by Grimandi was easily saved by Westerveld as the final approached the half-hour mark, and a duel between Wiltord and Jamie Carragher on the right side resulted in a Liverpool corner. Two minutes before the interval Henry was penalised for drifting into an offside position, having collected a long pass.|$|E

5|$|Howarth {{continued}} to be {{kept out of the}} team in 2003–04, only making his first appearance after Achterberg was injured during the warm-up away to Swindon on 3 March 2004. Tranmere lost 2–0, although his performance was positive, making a number of good saves. However, Achterberg was declared fit for the following match against Millwall on 7 March 2004, and Howarth returned to the substitutes' bench. He did not play another match for Tranmere that season. Howarth's first appearance of 2004–05 came as a 20th-minute substitute after Achterberg was injured away to Hull City on 18 December 2004. After conceding a goal scored by Ian Ashbee in the 34th minute, Howarth was injured in a <b>challenge</b> <b>with</b> Stuart Elliott, and was substituted at half-time. He was available for Tranmere's next match against Barnsley on 26 December 2004, and with Achterberg ruled out for the Christmas period with a knee injury, he started in a 1–1 home draw. This meant Howarth had a run of nine consecutive matches in goal for Tranmere, with an appearance against Oldham Athletic in the Football League Trophy Northern semi-final on 25 January 2005 being his last before Achterberg returned against Luton on 29 January. He failed to play again that season, and was released by Tranmere on 24 May 2005.|$|E
40|$|Campylobacter cinaedi and C. fennelliae {{have been}} {{associated}} with proctocolitis, bacteremia, and asymptomatic rectal infection, primarily in homosexual men. To more directly assess the pathogenic role of these organisms, we studied their disease-producing potential in 12 - to 25 -day-old pig-tailed macaques (Macaca nemestrina). Four infant monkeys were <b>challenged</b> <b>with</b> 10 (8) to 10 (9) C. cinaedi, three were <b>challenged</b> <b>with</b> C. fennelliae, two were <b>challenged</b> <b>with</b> C. jejuni, and one received no microorganisms. Watery or loose stools without associated fever or fecal leukocytes developed 3 to 7 days postinoculation in all of the animals given C. cinaedi, C. fennelliae, and C. jejuni, but not in the control animal. Stool cultures were simultaneously positive and remained so in the animals <b>challenged</b> <b>with</b> C. cinaedi or C. fennelliae for 3 weeks after inoculation despite the resolution of clinical illness. All of the animals <b>challenged</b> <b>with</b> C. cinaedi and C. fennelliae became bacteremic, and three had clinical evidence of septicemia. Histopathologic evaluation of rectal biopsies (five animals) and necropsy (one animal) showed no evidence of mucosal disruption. Specific immunoglobulin M and immunoglobulin G antibody responses occurred in all of the animals <b>challenged</b> <b>with</b> C. cinaedi and C. fennelliae, as determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and immunoblotting.

He was originally only {{going to work on}} Aya and Eve, but after seeing the settings for the other characters, he offered to design them too. The team wanted to emphasize the character's sexuality. As part of this, the team included a scene where Aya takes a shower. This was inspired by a similar scene in Parasite Eve II. When the title was being developed for PSP, the team's main <b>challenge</b> <b>with</b> the character was to make her look as realistic as possible while retaining her established physical traits. Using this new realism, the team wanted to portray the fear felt by humans when faced with such threats through Aya.

5|$|Takumi {{felt that}} the best way to write a mystery with a good climax is to reveal various clues, and then pull them {{together}} into one conclusion, and not have multiple possible endings. He said that the biggest <b>challenge</b> <b>with</b> that was to make the gameplay and story work together; the goal was to make the player feel like they have driven the story forward themselves, with their own choices, even though the game is linear. When writing the episodes, Takumi ranked each after its importance: the first episode was the most important, to make sure that the player likes the game; the second episode was the second most important, to solidify the player's interest; and the finale was the third most important. In general, each scenario was finished before anything else was done; after this, characters were designed based on the scenarios, and then Takumi adjusted dialogue as needed to make sure that it fit the designs. At this point, it was also decided what scenes were going to have specific cut-in illustrations made for them; Takumi drew rough sketches of them, and also drew the storyboards for the episodes' openings, which consist of series of detailed drawings that show what is happening.|$|E
5|$|The <b>challenge</b> <b>with</b> Kibble {{balances}} is {{not only}} in reducing their uncertainty, but also in making them truly practical realizations of the kilogram. Nearly every aspect of Kibble balances and their support equipment requires such extraordinarily precise and accurate, state-of-the-art technology that—unlike a device like an atomic clock—few countries would currently choose to fund their operation. For instance, the NIST's Kibble balance used four resistance standards in 2007, each of which was rotated through the Kibble balance every two to six weeks after being calibrated in {{a different part of}} NIST headquarters facility in Gaithersburg, Maryland. It was found that simply moving the resistance standards {{down the hall to the}} Kibble balance after calibration altered their values 10ppb (equivalent to 10µg) or more. Present-day technology is insufficient to permit stable operation of Kibble balances between even biannual calibrations. If the kilogram is defined in terms of the Planck constant, it is likely there will only be a few—at most—Kibble balances initially operating in the world.|$|E

5|$|The smaller {{time frame}} of {{development}} for Left Behind gave the team {{an opportunity to}} trial mechanics and ideas that {{they were unable to}} test on the main game. With the game's combat, an added feature was to allow players to focus the attention of the Infected towards human enemies, allowing an easier escape. The gameplay was also more focused on the characters, as opposed to the combat, to allow players to relate to them more. The gameplay sequences were designed to contrast with other moments of Ellie's life; for example, the water gun fight with Riley is contrasted to the gunfights with enemies. The team found that creating some gameplay mechanics was a <b>challenge,</b> <b>with</b> even fewer combat scenarios in Left Behind than in The Last of Us. The animation of the masks also presented a challenge, due to the number of joints; it took various iterations before the final design was implemented.|$|E
5|$|The {{underwater}} {{scene was}} the first to be shot, and for its filming Stage 16 at Fox Studios was reconstructed into a 36 by 45meter tank, 4.5meters deep, containing 548,000gallons of water. The decision was made to convert the stage rather than film the scene elsewhere, since moving the film crew to the nearest adequate facility in San Diego would have been too costly for a single scene, and by converting Stage 16 20th Century Fox would {{be able to use the}} tank for future films. Because of the aquatic filming, the ability to swim was a prerequisite for cast and crew when signing onto the film. The cast trained in swimming pools in Los Angeles with professional divers to learn how to use the equipment. An additional two and a half weeks of training took place at the studio with stunt coordinator Ernie Orsatti and underwater cinematographer Peter Romano. Weaver, however, was unable to participate in most of the training due to commitments on Broadway. Winona Ryder faced a <b>challenge</b> <b>with</b> the scene, as she had nearly drowned at age 12 and had not been in the water since. She suggested using a body double, but knew that it would be too obvious to audiences due to the difference in hair length.

Cochet and Bennett gained the mixed doubles title. In May he accepted a one-on-one and a doubles <b>challenge</b> <b>with</b> Béla von Kehrling and the Hungarian Davis Cup team in Budapest. In front of a local crowd of 3000, Cochet won in four sets against the home favorite. The doubles match between Von Kehrling – Jenő Péteri and Cochet – Roger Danet was indefinitely suspended due to bad light conditions at 6–2, 7–9, one set each. The next stop was in Vienna where he won the Austrian International Championships. Returning home he secured his French International Championships title by overcoming Lacoste in the final in four sets. The doubles were won by Jean Borotra and Jacques Brugnon {{despite the efforts of}} Cochet and René de Buzelet. Cochet and recurring partner Bennett added the French hard courts mixed title to their set of accolades after defeating Helen Wills, women's world champion, and Frank Hunter, the No. 2 USLTA player in a three-set championship match. On 6 July at the 1928 Wimbledon Championships Lacoste equalized with a victory over Cochet and deprived him of the title. Cochet and Bennett lost in the mixed quarterfinals. Cochet and Brugnon won the doubles again over Gerald Patterson and John Hawkes after their 1926 triumph.
