5|$|Epiacum is in {{some ways}} a typical Roman fort: inside the wall are {{straight}} roads which cross, a headquarters building (the Praetorium), the commandant's house, a set of barrack blocks for the <b>cohort</b> <b>of</b> auxiliary soldiers, and granaries to store food. Also as usual, there is a bath house and a temple (dedicated by the auxiliaries to the Emperor Caracalla) outside the wall. There is an altar to Mithras and another, as already mentioned, to Hercules.|$|E

50|$|The Legio Martia and Vibius Pansa's {{recruits}} suddenly stood {{threatened in}} front of and alongside Antony's legions. The experienced legionaries did not lose their cohesion, but accepted battle after sending back the <b>cohorts</b> <b>of</b> recruits that were deemed unsuitable for the fight by the Caesarian veterans of the Martia. While the praetorian <b>cohorts</b> <b>of</b> Antony and Caesar Octavian fought sharply along the main road, the Martia veterans split into two parts and, {{under the command of}} Pansa and Carfulenus, ran into the marshes to join the battle. Carfulenus led eight <b>cohorts</b> <b>of</b> the Legio Martia into the swampy soil to the right of Via Aemilia, while in the marshes {{on the left side of}} the road, the consul Pansa commanded the other two <b>cohorts</b> <b>of</b> the legion, reinforced by Aulus Hirtius' praetorian cohorts. Mark Antony's veterans of Legio XXXV attacked the eight <b>cohorts</b> <b>of</b> the Martia while the entire Legio II moved against the two cohorts under the command of Vibius Pansa to the left of Via Aemilia.|$|R

5|$|The {{nomenclature}} of {{the great}} majority of regiments followed a standard configuration: unit type, followed by serial number, followed by name of the peregrini tribe (or nation) from whom the regiment was originally raised, in the genitive plural case e.g. cohors III Batavorum ("3rd <b>Cohort</b> <b>of</b> Batavi"); cohors I Brittonum ("1st <b>Cohort</b> <b>of</b> Britons"). Some regiments combine the names of two peregrini tribes, most likely after the merger of two previously separate regiments e.g. ala I Pannoniorum et Gallorum ("1st Wing of Pannonii and Gauls"). A minority of regiments are named after an individual, mostly after the first prefect of the regiment e.g. ala Sulpicia (presumably named after a prefect whose middle (gens) name was Sulpicius). The latter is also an example of regiments that did not have a serial number.|$|E
5|$|The social {{repression}} of the 1950s resulted in a cultural revolution in Greenwich Village. A <b>cohort</b> <b>of</b> poets, later named the Beat poets, wrote about the evils of the social organization at the time, glorifying anarchy, drugs, and hedonistic pleasures over unquestioning social compliance, consumerism, and closed mindedness. Of them, Allen Ginsberg and William S. Burroughs—both Greenwich Village residents—also wrote bluntly and honestly about homosexuality. Their writings attracted sympathetic liberal-minded people, as well as homosexuals looking for a community.|$|E

5|$|At {{the end of}} the war Rodd {{returned}} home, but {{the marriage}} was essentially over; although remaining on friendly terms, the couple led separate lives. Mitford's visit to France in late 1945 had revived her longing to be there, and in April 1946, having given up working in the shop the previous month, she left London to make her permanent home in Paris; she never lived in England again. She was a prolific letter writer, and kept contact with her large <b>cohort</b> <b>of</b> friends by a voluminous correspondence. According to Hastings, she developed many of her friendships far further on paper than she could have done through normal social intercourse.|$|E
5|$|Early studies {{reported}} high success rates: {{in one study}} in 1925, 60% of patients became seizure-free, and another 35% of patients had a 50% reduction in seizure frequency. These studies generally examined a <b>cohort</b> <b>of</b> patients recently treated by the physician (what {{is known as a}} retrospective study) and selected patients who had successfully maintained the dietary restrictions. However, these studies are difficult to compare to modern trials. One reason is that these older trials suffered from selection bias, as they excluded patients who were unable to start or maintain the diet and thereby selected from patients who would generate better results. In an attempt to control for this bias, modern study design prefers a prospective cohort (the patients in the study are chosen before therapy begins) in which the results are presented for all patients regardless of whether they started or completed the treatment (known as intent-to-treat analysis).|$|E
5|$|Even though alpha {{radiation}} cannot penetrate the skin, ingested or inhaled plutonium does irradiate internal organs. Alpha particles generated by inhaled plutonium {{have been found}} to cause lung cancer in a <b>cohort</b> <b>of</b> European nuclear workers. The skeleton, where plutonium accumulates, and the liver, where it collects and becomes concentrated, are at risk. Plutonium is not absorbed into the body efficiently when ingested; only 0.04% of plutonium oxide is absorbed after ingestion. Plutonium absorbed by the body is excreted very slowly, with a biological half-life of 200 years. Plutonium passes only slowly through cell membranes and intestinal boundaries, so absorption by ingestion and incorporation into bone structure proceeds very slowly.|$|E

25|$|The {{size of the}} Roman army amassed {{against the}} rebels was much larger than that {{commanded}} by Titus sixty years earlier - by that time nearly {{one third of the}} Roman army took part in the campaign against Bar Kokhba. It is estimated that at that point forces from at least 10 Legions participated in Severus' campaign in Judea, including Legio X Fretensis, Legio VI Ferrata, Legio III Gallica, Legio III Cyrenaica, Legio II Traiana Fortis, Legio X Gemina, <b>cohorts</b> <b>of</b> Legio V Macedonica, <b>cohorts</b> <b>of</b> Legio XI Claudia, <b>cohorts</b> <b>of</b> Legio XII Fulminata and <b>cohorts</b> <b>of</b> Legio IV Flavia Felix and 30-50 auxilary units with a total force of 60,000–120,000 Roman soldiers facing Bar-Kokhba's rebels. Legio XXII Deiotariana was likely entirely lost during an earlier stage of the revolt. It is plausible that Legio IX Hispana also arrived in Judea and its demise occurred during the decisive campaign of Sextus Julius Severus, as Legio IX Hispana's disappearance during the second century is often attributed to this war.|$|R
50|$|This fierce {{battle between}} the {{veterans}} continued in the swamps, initially without decisive results. On the right wing, the eight <b>cohorts</b> <b>of</b> the Legio Martia {{under the command of}} Decimus Carfulenus managed slowly to gain ground, while Antony's Legio XXXV gradually retreated in good order. On the left wing, on the other hand, the other two <b>cohorts</b> <b>of</b> the Legio Martia and the praetorian <b>cohorts</b> <b>of</b> Hirtius, under Pansa's command, first offered a stiff resistance but then began gradually to fold before Antony's entire Legio II. The battle finally turned to the favour of Antony's forces: in the center along the Via Aemilia, Antony and Silanus' praetorian cohorts prevailed in a brutal clash with Caesar Octavian's praetorian cohorts, which were completely destroyed.|$|R

Who's Your City?, Florida's fourth book on the subject, combines scholarly research with a lighthearted self-help tone.

Alumna Forence Cushing, along with a <b>cohort</b> <b>of</b> other Boston-based alumnae, observed in 1883 that Vassar's {{physical education}} program was lagging behind those at other recently opened Seven Sisters schools including Wellesley College and Smith College.
