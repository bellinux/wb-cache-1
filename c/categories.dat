5|$|Although {{reference}} to major morphological <b>categories</b> such as root, stem, leaf, and trichome are useful, {{one has to}} keep in mind that these <b>categories</b> are linked through intermediate forms so that a continuum between the <b>categories</b> results. Furthermore, structures can be seen as processes, that is, process combinations.|$|E
5|$|Chrysippus is {{the first}} Stoic for whom the third of the four Stoic <b>categories,</b> i.e. the {{category}} somehow disposed is attested. In the surviving evidence, Chrysippus frequently makes use of the <b>categories</b> of substance and quality, but makes little use {{of the other two}} Stoic <b>categories</b> (somehow disposed and somehow disposed in relation to something). It is not clear whether the <b>categories</b> had any special significance for Chrysippus, and a clear doctrine of <b>categories</b> may be the work of later Stoics.|$|E
5|$|Grammar can be {{described}} as a system of <b>categories</b> and a set of rules that determine how <b>categories</b> combine to form different aspects of meaning. Languages differ widely in whether they are encoded through the use of <b>categories</b> or lexical units. However, several <b>categories</b> are so common as to be nearly universal. Such universal <b>categories</b> include the encoding of the grammatical relations of participants and predicates by grammatically distinguishing between their relations to a predicate, the encoding of temporal and spatial relations on predicates, and a system of grammatical person governing reference to and distinction between speakers and addressees and those about whom they are speaking.|$|E

5000|$|If {{there is}} a monoidal functor from a monoidal <b>category</b> M to a monoidal <b>category</b> N, then any <b>category</b> enriched over M can be reinterpreted as a <b>category</b> enriched over N.
