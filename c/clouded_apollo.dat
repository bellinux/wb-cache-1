25|$|The <b>clouded</b> <b>Apollo</b> (Parnassius mnemosyne) is a {{butterfly}} {{species of the}} family of swallowtail butterflies (Papilionidae) found in the Palearctic ecozone.|$|E
25|$|Related {{species can}} be found all over the world. The <b>clouded</b> <b>Apollo</b> (Parnassius mnemosyne) lives in the valleys. while the small Apollo (Parnassius phoebus) {{is found in the}} high mountains. The latter one has {{strongly}} marked black and white antennae, with presence of two red spots near the apex of forewings.|$|E
25|$|The <b>clouded</b> <b>Apollo</b> is locally {{common in}} some places in central Europe. The female lays whitish eggs with a {{granular}} surface. The caterpillar feeds only on sunny days, otherwise it is hidden under leaves or stones. The blunt-ended chrysalis lies {{on the ground in}} a light spun covering. The caterpillars feed exclusively on Corydalis species.|$|E
25|$|<b>Clouded</b> <b>Apollos</b> inhabit {{meadows and}} {{woodland}} clearings {{with plenty of}} flowering plants, both in the lowlands and in the mountains. It is not usually found at altitudes above 1500m except in the Central Asian mountains where it is also known from higher altitudes.|$|R
25|$|The {{paper of}} Dr. I.N. Bolotov and colleagues (2013) {{summarizes}} {{data on the}} northern localities of Parnassius mnemosyne, which are mostly situated in the Russian Federation and gives a thorough description of the species' northern range location. It is shown that the northernmost populations in the exist within the karst landscapes {{in the north of}} White Sea-Kuloi Plateau (between 65°35' and 66°03' N) in the downstream of the Soyana and Kuloi rivers and in the north of Timan Highland (66°10' N) along the shore of Kosminskoe Lake (the Pechora River basin). Northern limits of the <b>clouded</b> <b>Apollo's</b> range appear to be strongly determined by the distribution of its larval host plants (primarily Corydalis solida and the role of climate and relief seem to be of minor importance. Many Russian populations inhabit the state nature reserve territories: Kizgi Scerries Reserve (Karelia Republic), Pinega and Soyansky reserves (Arkhangelsk Oblast), Pechoro-Ilychsky and Belaja Kedva reserves (Komi Republic).|$|R
50|$|Remarkable animals {{living in}} the nature reserve are the <b>clouded</b> <b>Apollo</b> and the European ground squirrel.|$|E
50|$|Corydalis {{species are}} used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species (butterflies), {{especially}} the <b>clouded</b> <b>Apollo.</b>|$|E

They inhabit small patches and individuals move from patch to patch and conservation of a network of patches is required to maintain the gene pool.|$|E
50|$|Among National Red Book {{species of}} {{vertebrates}} in the park, there are: European green lizard, smooth snake, short-toed snake eagle, greater spotted eagle, stock dove, white-backed woodpecker, Miller's water shrew, serotine bat, Nathusius' pipistrelle, Kuhl's pipistrelle, common pipistrelle, soprano pipistrelle, common noctule, Leisler's bat, brown long-eared bat, rearmouse, Daubenton's bat, stoat, European polecat and otter.Among National Red Book species of invertebrates, there are: forest caterpillar hunter, stag beetle, musk beetle, hermit beetle, Neopristilophus depressus (lat.), swallowtail, southern festoon, <b>clouded</b> <b>Apollo,</b> Duke of Burgundy, poplar admiral, blue underwing, Janus femoratus(lat.), Megarhyssa superba(lat.), carpenter bee and mammoth wasp.|$|E
50|$|The Araneae are {{represented}} by 321 species, or 35% of Bulgaria's total. The spiders prefer the north-eastern slopes and are most diverse in the coniferous forests. There are 36 species of Myriapoda, or 20% of Bulgaria's total. They are distributed mainly in the forests and are less frequent in the sub-Alpine and the Alpine zones. The Mollusca are 89 species and represent 27% of the nation's total (excluding the marine molluscs). Only 2% of Bulgaria's Ephemeroptera {{are found in the}} park — two species. The number of Orthopterida species is 63, or around 30% of the nation's total. The highest diversity is found in the valleys of the rivers Banderitsa and Damyanitsa. The Plecoptera {{are represented}} by 40 species, forming 40% of Bulgaria's diversity. There are 323 Heteroptera species, or 32% of the ones known in Bulgaria. They are most diverse in the northern parts of the park, in the Bayuvi Dupki - Dzhindzhiritsa Reserve. The Coleoptera are 639 species and this number it is estimated to raise to 1800-1900. The Neuropterida are 25 species, or 20% of Bulgaria's total diversity. There are 36 Hymenoptera species, found mainly at lower altitudes. The Trichoptera are 59 species, or 24% of Bulgaria's total. The Lepidoptera are 449, including 116 butterflies and 333 moths. Some of the most spectacular butterflies are the mountain Apollo (Parnassius apollo), <b>clouded</b> <b>Apollo</b> (Parnassius mnemosyne), false Eros blue (Polyommatus eroides), mountain Alcon blue (Phengaris rebeli), large blue (Phengaris arion), scarce tortoiseshell (Nymphalis xanthomelas), Titania's fritillary (Boloria titania), eastern large heath (Coenonympha rhodopensis), Cynthia's fritillary (Euphydryas cynthia), etc.|$|E
40|$|Variation {{partitioning}} and hierarchical partitioning are novel statistical {{approaches that}} provide {{deeper understanding of}} the importance of different explanatory variables for biodiversity patterns than traditional regression methods. Using these methods, the variation in occupancy and abundance of the <b>clouded</b> <b>apollo</b> butterfly (Parnassius mnemosyne L.) was decomposed into independent and joint effects of larval and adult food resources, microclimate and habitat quantity. The independent effect of habitat quantity variables (habitat area and connectivity) captured the largest fraction of the variation in the <b>clouded</b> <b>apollo</b> patterns, but habitat connectivity had a major contribution only for occupancy data. The independent effects of resources and microclimate were higher on butterfly abundance than on occupancy. However, a considerable amount of variation in the butterfly patterns was accounted for by the joint effects of predictors and may thus be causally related to two or all three groups of variables. Abundance of the butterfly in the surroundings of the focal grid cell had a significant effect in all analyses, independently of the effects of other predictors. Our results encourage wider applications of partitioning methods in biodiversity studies...|$|E
40|$|The patte rn {{of genetic}} {{variation}} in a butterfly species depend s on the pa st {{history of the}} given 2 species and also on recent evolutionary processes affecting its populations. The aim of the 3 pr esent study was (i) to analyse the enzyme polymorphism in the <b>Clouded</b> <b>Apollo</b> populations 4 of the Carpathian Basin to reveal the contemporary pattern of their genetic differentiation and 5 (ii) to compare it with an expanded mtDNA haplotype network of the SE E uropean 6 populations. Allozyme polymorphism was analysed in 22 populations of four geographic 7 regions: Transdanubian (TM) and North Hungarian Mountains (NM), Körös (KÖR) and Bereg 8 – Apuseni – East Carpathian regions (BEAC). The results of the Bayesian clust ering analyses 9 based on allozyme s supported the presence of three main genetic lineages in the Carpathian 10 Basin : o ne was typical for TM, another was characteristic for NM and the third cluster was 11 predominant in K ÖR. T he populations of BEAC harboured a mix ture of two clusters. The 12 mtDNA haplotype network suggested a fairly similar distribution: the peri - Alpine clade 13 together with the West Balkan clade was detected in TM, while the East Balkan clade occurred 14 in NM, partly in TR and in the two eastern regions of the Basin (KÖR and BAEC). The 15 incongruities between {{the results of the}} mtDNA and allozyme studies {{can be explained by the}} 16 different time scales represented by the two markers. The mtDNA haplotype network provided 17 strong evidence concerning the existenc e of two Balkan lineages, which probably formed a 18 “zone of admixture” in the Transdanubian and North Hungarian Mountains. The possibility of 19 Last Glacial survival of P. mnemosyne in the Carpathian Basin and the conservation 20 implications of these results ar e discussed...|$|E
