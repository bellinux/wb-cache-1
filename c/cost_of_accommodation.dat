40|$|A measure {{commonly}} used to assess house prices is the house price?to? rent ratio. This ratio captures the <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> alternative forms <b>of</b> <b>accommodation,</b> namely buying or renting. In the long run these two costs should move together. If house prices rise compared to rents, more people may choose to rent rather than buy. This drives rents up and house prices down. In other words, if the alternative <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> <b>accommodation</b> are not moving together then people would switch between buying and renting. This would continue until the alternative costs again begin to move in line with each other...|$|R

50|$|Under the 1990-94 {{development}} plan, {{which emphasizes}} that the growth of tourism should not be {{at the expense of}} the environment, the number of beds on the islands of Mahé, Praslin, and La Digue is to be limited to 4,000. Increases in total capacity are to be achieved by developing the outer islands. To avoid future threat to the natural attractions of the islands, 150,000 tourists per year are regarded as the ultimate ceiling. The higher <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>accommodations</b> and travel, deficiencies in services and maintenance of facilities, and a limited range of diversions handicap Seychelles in attracting vacationers at the expense of other Indian Ocean tourist destinations.|$|R

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} neurophysiological {{correlates}} of presupposition processing in conditions <b>of</b> satisfaction and <b>accommodation,</b> comparing {{two types of}} triggers: definite descriptions and change-of-state verbs. Results showed that, for both types, the <b>accommodation</b> <b>of</b> presuppositions {{is associated with a}} biphasic N 400 -P 600 pattern at the processing point. With definite descriptions, we observed a more clear involvement of the N 400, while for change-of-state verbs the <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> <b>accommodation</b> were associated with a more pronounced P 600. Moreover, when conveyed by change of state predicates, presuppositions seem to elicit also a P 200 visible already at the trigger verb. The data nicely fit into the Linking-Updating model and support two main conclusions. First, presupposition accommodation is a sequential process unfolding through a biphasic ERP pattern presumably related to search for antecedent and discourse update. Second, the kind of presupposition trigger seems to affect the cognitive <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> presupposition <b>accommodation</b> at different processing times, with definite description capitalizing more on the earlier search for antecedent and change-of-state verbs capitalizing more on the later updating of the discourse mental model with the presupposed information. Overall, our findings suggest that the brain understands information taken for granted by going through a process whose time course involves several phases, differently modulated based on specific linguistic expressions...|$|R

30|$|Against this backdrop, the Yamaan Foundation for Health and Social Development in Yemen (Yamaan), {{with support}} from Options Consultancy Services (Options), {{developed}} a voucher programme that facilitates access to a highly subsidised package of reproductive and safe motherhood services for poor Yemeni women in two governorates. In addition to services, the vouchers provide access to free transport to the health facility for delivery and a contribution towards the <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> <b>accommodation</b> and food for a chaperone.

50|$|From the 1990s, the {{break-up}} {{of the traditional}} family unit, when combined with a low interest rate environment and other demographic changes, has created great pressure on the housing market, in particular regarding the accommodation of key workers such as nurses, other emergency service workers and teachers, who are priced out of most housing, especially in the South East. Some research indicates that {{in the 21st century}} young people are tending to continue to live in the parental home for much longer than their predecessors. The high cost of living, combined with rising <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>accommodation,</b> further education and higher education means that many young people cannot afford to live independent lives from their families.|$|E
50|$|Dance and Drama Awards {{are offered}} to {{selected}} students, who are commencing {{training at the}} 21 specialist vocational schools chosen for the scheme.

The award pays a substantial contribution towards the cost of attending the relevant course and in many cases, also includes a means tested maintenance grant, which can be used towards the student's contribution to the course fees, or the <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>accommodation</b> and other expenses associated with attending full-time training.|$|E
50|$|The {{most visible}} part of SOMA's {{work is the}} sending of teams of volunteers from churches in sending-countries to dioceses {{overseas}} {{at the invitation of}} local bishops. The volunteers come from churches sympathetic to the aims of SOMA who commit themselves to raising travel expenses for a 10- to 15-day short-term mission. The host dioceses aim to raise the finances for the <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>accommodation,</b> both for the team members and for attending delegates. Teams have been sent to about 50 different countries, some of which are in situations of great poverty. This frequently places strain on the finances resulting in the need for fund-raising by supporters to enable missions to areas such as Southern Sudan, or Kitgum in northern Uganda to be possible. Biblical teaching material is provided by the visiting team and covers topics such as Renewal for Life; Healing; Gifts of the Spirit; Renewal in the Midst of Chaos; Building a Prophetic Community; Worship; Leadership; Marriage.|$|E

40|$|In {{the face}} of concern {{regarding}} the provision of mental health residential care, an economic component was incorporated into the design of an epidemiological survey of mental health needs in eight districts. This paper sets out the methods used to undertake the <b>costing</b> component <b>of</b> the study, and describes the <b>accommodation</b> and non-accommodation <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> facilities covered by the survey (n= 340) and the people resident within them (n= 1904). The <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> <b>accommodation</b> tend to be lowest in the private sector, followed by the voluntary sector. The highest accommodation costs were observed for NHS facilities. This {{is in contrast to}} non-accommodation costs, which are lowest for residents in specialised hospital settings and highest for those in community settings with lower levels of on-site support, such as group homes. These cost differences between alternative settings and sectors may reflect different resident, facility and area characteristics, an hypothesis we are testing in a subsequent part of this study. ...|$|R

50|$|Another {{important}} {{consequence of}} the timing of English school holidays is the pricing of holiday accommodation. There is generally a steep rise in the <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>accommodation</b> during the school holidays, due to increased demand. The English tourism industry closely monitors various websites that provide up to date school holiday information, and sets its prices accordingly. Prices often drop by hundreds of pounds just one week into the new school term. Since most schools have a strict policy against children being taken out of school, parents who decide to save money by taking a family holiday during the school term risk not only damaging their children's education but also fines or warnings from their school. Parents can be issued with a penalty notice whenever they take their children on holiday during term time without getting authorisation from the school. Penalty notices can be issued by local councils, headteachers (including deputy and assistant heads authorised by them) and the police. Generally, schools will agree {{to no more than}} 10 school days of absence in any school year.|$|E
5000|$|According to a May 2009 {{investigation}} by The Sunday Times Insight team, Uddin claims on her House of Lords Expenses that a flat in Maidstone, Kent is her main residence {{on which she}} has claimed £30,000 per annum in tax-free expenses since 2005. This {{is said to have}} allowed her to also claim the second home allowance on her London property, a scheme that ostensibly exists to compensate politicians living outside London for the <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>accommodation</b> close to Parliament. Residents living near the flat in Maidstone reportedly said they had not seen any occupiers in the flat since Uddin purchased it and that it has remained completely unfurnished, but Uddin claims: [...] "The Maidstone property is furnished and I strongly deny that I have never lived there". Uddin's husband even denied having a property in Kent when questioned on the issue by the Times, and she appeared on the electoral roll at her London address from 1996 to date.

5000|$|Jos {{has become}} an {{important}} national administrative, commercial, and tourist centre. Tin mining {{has led to the}} influx of migrants, mostly Igbos, Yorubas and Europeans, who constitute {{more than half of the}} population of Jos. This [...] "melting pot" [...] of race, ethnicity and religion makes Jos one of the most cosmopolitan cities in Nigeria. For this reason, Plateau State is known in Nigeria as the [...] "home of peace and tourism." [...] Despite this, in 2001, the city witnessed violent riots between the divided Muslim and Christian populations, in which several thousand people died. In 2004, the former governor of Plateau State, Joshua Dariye, was suspended for six months for failing to control the violence. In November 2008, clashes between Christians and Muslims killed almost 400 and wounded many. In spite of the communal clashes, visitors are surprised at the amount of activities still going on in the city. There is still an influx of people into the city and the <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>accommodation</b> and land is still going up daily. This shows that the city is still one of the most desirable cities in Nigeria, despite the communal clashes.|$|E
40|$|The {{replacement}} of long-stay hospital services with community-based care can have considerable resource consequences. How much community care costs {{and whether it}} is more expensive than hospital care are questions high on the policy and planning agenda. Decision-makers should also be interested in whether levels of expenditure are associated with clients' needs and with changes in their wellbeing. These questions were addressed in a wide-ranging evaluation of community care in N. Ireland. In examining the <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> <b>accommodation</b> and other services used by former residents of nine hospitals (n= 133) the study found community care to be cheaper than hospital care. Broadly speaking, the new service was a cost-effective alternative as little change in clients' welfare was found. However, analysis of the variations in community care costs found only weak associations with clients' personal characteristics and needs, and found no link between differential spending and differential outcomes...|$|R
