60|$|There {{was much}} in the bear's favour, for the recent fall of a {{pinnacle}} had <b>covered</b> the <b>ledge</b> with shattered blocks of all shapes and sizes, in the shelter of which it could creep towards its prey. Our Eskimos watched the proceeding open-mouthed, with profound interest. To within twenty yards or so of its game did that white-robed Arctic hunter approach. Then it crouched for a rush at the unconscious birds, for no other lump of ice lay between them and their foe.|$|R

60|$|My next bullet {{struck a}} puff from rock above the bear, and my third, hitting {{just in front}} of him, as he was on a yellow <b>ledge,</b> <b>covered</b> him with dust. He reared, and wheeling, sheered back and down the step he had mounted, and {{disappeared}} in a clump of brush. I shot into that. We heard my bullet crack the twigs. But it routed him out, and then my last shot hit far under him.|$|R
60|$|Broad {{daylight}} {{had come}} when again {{he opened his}} eyes. The blue sky was directly above, and before him he saw a <b>ledge</b> <b>covered</b> with dwarfed pine trees. He turned his head, and {{saw that he was}} in a sort of amphitheater of about two acres in extent enclosed by low cliffs. A cleft in the stony wall let out a brawling brook, and served, no doubt, as entrance to the place. Several rude log cabins stood {{on that side of the}} enclosure. Jonathan knew he had been brought to Bing Legget's retreat.|$|R
60|$|On Friday {{afternoon}} the Irish Brigade advanced along the line, {{and then turned}} off towards Railway Hill, a steep jagged eminence almost triangular in shape, with one angle pointing towards the river. The sides were broken with sharp <b>ledges</b> <b>covered</b> with boulders. The railway passed through this, separating the last jagged ledge from the higher portion of the hill, which rises almost precipitously. Running back several hundred yards {{at the base of}} this line was a dip full of thorn trees. This deep winds round the rear of the hill, and here there was a large Boer Camp.|$|R
60|$|This is {{undoubtedly}} the true explanation, as I made sure by testing the mussels in fresh water and {{by watching the}} birds more closely at their feeding. All winter they may be found along our coasts, where they feed on the small shellfish that <b>cover</b> the <b>ledges.</b> As the tide goes down they swim in from the shoals, where they rest in scattered flocks, and chip the mussels from the ledges, swallowing them shells and all. A score of times I have hidden among the rocks of the jetty with a few wooden decoys in front of me, and watched the eiders come in to feed. They would approach the decoys rapidly, lifting their wings repeatedly {{as a kind of}} salutation; then, angered apparently that they were not welcomed by the same signal of uplifted wings, they would swim up to the wooden frauds and peck them savagely here and there, and then leave them in disgust and scatter among the rocks at my feet, paying little attention to me as long as I kept perfectly still. For they are much tamer than other wild ducks, and are, unfortunately, slow to believe that man is their enemy.|$|R
60|$|From {{the foot}} of the tree the crevice in which it grew led upwards to the right, then doubled back to the ledge above the nest, upon which Cheplahgan was {{standing}} when I discovered him. The lip of this crevice made a dizzy path that one might follow by moving crabwise, his face to the cliff, with only its roughnesses to cling to with his fingers. I tried it at last, crept up and out twenty feet, and back ten, and dropped with a great breath of relief to a broad <b>ledge</b> <b>covered</b> with bones and fish scales, the relics of many a savage feast. Below me, almost within reach, was the nest, with two dark, scraggly young birds resting on twigs and grass, with fish, flesh and fowl in a gory, skinny, scaly ring about them--the most savage-looking household into which I ever looked unbidden.|$|R
60|$|Glancing round, he {{observed}} his savage guardian gazing contemplatively at the distant prospect. Martin's heart beat audibly as {{he rose and}} walked with an affectation of carelessness {{to the edge of}} the cliff. As he gazed down, a feeling of horror seized him; he gasped for breath, and almost fainted. Then the idea of perpetual slavery flashed across his mind, and the thought of freedom and home nerved him. He clenched his hands, staggered convulsively forward and fell, with a loud and genuine shriek of terror, upon the shrubs that <b>covered</b> the rocky <b>ledge.</b> Instantly he arose, ground his teeth together, raised his eyes for one moment to heaven, and sprang into the air. For one instant he swept through empty space; the next he was deep down in the waters of the dark pool, and when the horrified Indian reached the edge of the precipice, he beheld his prisoner struggling on the surface for a moment, ere he was swept by the rapid stream round the point and out of view.|$|R
5000|$|Once {{reunited with}} Elizabeth, the player must {{work with her}} to escape Columbia. The player does not {{directly}} control Elizabeth, but instead she reacts to the player and the current situation {{in a manner similar}} to the AI Director in Left 4 Dead. Unlike BioShock, where the player is tasked with protecting a Little Sister while escorting her, Elizabeth requires no protection and can take care of herself in combat. While the player is in battle, Elizabeth scavenges the area for supplies such as ammunition, medical kits, Salts, and other items, and tosses them to Booker as needed. She can also use her Tear-opening powers to aid the player, bringing in weapons, health, Salts, environmental features such as <b>cover</b> or a <b>ledge</b> for higher ground, and automated defense units. Only one Tear can be opened at a time, making the player decide between the available options to suit the battle. Elizabeth also has the ability to pick locks using her hairpin. However, she requires [...] "one-use" [...] lockpicks, found all over Columbia, to open doors or safes storing valuable or hidden items.|$|R
40|$|Rock pools can {{be found}} in inter-tidal marine environments worldwide; however, there have been few studies {{exploring}} what drives their, fish species composition, especially in Australia. The rock-pool environment is highly dynamic and offers a unique natural laboratory to study the habitat choices, physiological limitations and adaptations of inter-tidal fish species. In this study rock pools of the Sydney region were sampled to determine how the physical (volume, depth, rock cover and vertical position) and biological (algal cover and predator presence) parameters of pools influence fish distribution and abundance. A total of 27 fish species representing 14 families was observed in tide pools at the four study locations. The five most abundant species were Bathygobius cocosensis, Centropogon australis, Enneapterygius atrogulare, Lepidoblennius haplodactylus and Microcanthus strigatus, which together represented 71 % {{of the total number of}} fish recorded. Larger rock pools containing more algal and rock <b>ledge</b> <b>cover</b> hosted a larger and more diverse population of fish. Furthermore, certain species were only found in pools with specific characteristics, such as the presence of loose shells, a variety algae or rock cover, suggesting a high degree of habitat specificity. By contrast, some species were ubiquitous and thus can likely tolerate a wide variety of physical conditions. 13 page(s...|$|R
40|$|Various reef types {{worldwide}} have inconsistent {{relationships among}} fish assemblage parameters and benthic characteristics, thus {{there is a}} need to identify factors driving assemblage structure specific to each reef type and locale. Limestone ledges are known to be key habitats for bottom fish on the continental shelf of the southeastern USA, however, the specific factors that link them to fish assemblages have not been quantified. Bottom fishes and habitat characteristics on ledges were surveyed at a study site located centrally in the southeastern USA continental shelf. Species richness, diversity, abundance, and biomass of fish were higher at ledges than on flat bottom. Species richness, abundance, and biomass of fish were well explained by ledge variables including percent cover of sessile invertebrates, total height, and height of undercut recesses. Multivariate analyses based on biomass of individual species at ledges revealed two fish assemblages associated with four ledge types. One assemblage was associated with ledges that were tall, heavily colonized with sessile invertebrates, large in area, and did or did not have undercuts. The other assemblage was associated with ledges that were short, not undercut, smaller in area, and were or were not heavily colonized by invertebrates. Seafloor classification schemes presently used in the region do not adequately capture hard bottom diversity to identify the location and extent of essential fish habitats for ecological and fisheries purposes. Given that <b>ledges</b> <b>cover</b> only ∼ 1 % to 5 % of the southeastern USA continental shelf, they merit the highest levels of consideration in regional research, conservation, and management plans...|$|R
6000|$|So, again, when in {{the year}} 1812 the volcano of St. Vincent, in the West India Islands, poured out torrents of lava, after mighty {{earthquakes}} which shook all {{that part of the}} world, a strange thing happened (about which I have often heard from those who saw it) in the island of Barbados, several hundred miles away. For when the sun rose in the morning (it was a Sunday morning), the sky remained more dark than any night, and all the poor negroes crowded terrified out of their houses into the streets, fancying {{the end of the world}} was come. But a learned man who was there, finding that, though the sun was risen, it was still pitchy dark, opened his window, and found that it was stuck fast by something on the ledge outside, and, when he thrust it open, found the <b>ledge</b> <b>covered</b> deep in soft red dust; and he instantly said, like a wise man as he was, [...] "The volcano of St. Vincent must have broken out, and these are the ashes from it." [...] Then he ran down stairs and quieted the poor negroes, telling them not to be afraid, for the end of the world was not coming just yet. But still the dust went on falling till the whole island, I am told, was covered an inch thick; and the same thing happened in the other islands round. People thought--and they had reason to think from what had often happened elsewhere--that though the dust might hurt the crops for that year, it would make them richer in years to come, because it would act as manure upon the soil; and so it did after a few years; but it did terrible damage at the time, breaking off the boughs of trees and covering up the crops; and in St. Vincent itself whole estates were ruined. It was a frightful day, but I know well that behind that How there was a Why for its happening, and happening too, about that very time, which all who know the history of negro slavery in the West Indies can guess for themselves, and confess, I hope, that in this case, as in all others, when Lady Why seems most severe she is often most just and kind.|$|R

Spatial learning and memory has been demonstrated in many terrestrial mammals, birds, reptiles and insects, however, considerably less is known about how/whether fishes use learning and memory in spatial orientation. The movements of fish within their natural habitats suggest impressive spatial abilities {{but this does not}} provide evidence for the role of spatial learning and memory or indicate what is being learned. Moreover, learning ability is likely to be shaped by natural selection, thus species may vary in their learning abilities depending on the environment they occupy. Intertidal Gobies in particular are ideal for exploring the relationship between spatial learning and memory capabilities and the environment. Importantly from a comparative perspective, they differ considerably, in their lifestyles and ecologies in response the extreme conditions in the intertidal zone (eg. shifting water levels, strong wave action and desiccation). Gobies respond to these fluctuating conditions in two main ways. Some species remain within the intertidal zone during low tide by seeking refuge from these adverse conditions in tide pools. Other species leave the intertidal zone completely during low tide only to return when conditions are more favourable (eg. high tide). Rock pools can be found in intertidal marine environments worldwide, however, there have been few studies exploring what drives their species composition, especially in Australia. This is quite disturbing considering the growing worldwide support for the preservation of marine biodiversity. Chapter 2 determined the major physical and biological factors influencing the distribution and abundance of rock pool fishes inhabiting the intertidal zone. This chapter evaluated the importance of within-pool shelters, algal cover, substrate type (rock or sand), rock pool depth, volume, and vertical position in limiting the distribution and abundance of these fishes. It was found that larger rock pools containing more algal and rock <b>ledge</b> <b>cover</b> hosted a larger and more diverse population of fish. Furthermore, certain species appear to only be found in pools with certain characteristics such as algal and rock cover. In intertidal fish, survival may be influenced by an individual’s ability to return to its home rock pool after high tide feeding excursions and thereby avoid being stranded in unsuitable areas at low tide. Chapter 3 tested site fidelity and homing ability for five species of intertidal rock pool fish by taging and displacing them to new rock pools at various distances from their ‘home’ rock pools. Three of the species were rock pool specialists whilst the remaining two spend a small proportion of their life in rock pools during early ontogeny. The three specialists showed strong site fidelity with > 50 % of individuals found in the same pool 42 days after tagging. In contrast, the non-specialist species showed low fidelity and poor homing abilities. Homing success in the rock pool specialists remained relatively stable as displacement distance increased. The effect of body size on homing ability was species dependent, with only one species showing a significantly greater tendency to home with increasing size. Given that some rock pool species show acute homing abilities one would expect that they should also display spatial learning and memory capabilities on a smaller scale (within pool). It is unlikely that natural selection would favour spatial learning skills in fishes inhabiting sandy shores because they simply shift back and forth with the tides. Chapter 4 determined if inter-tidal gobies collected from rocky platforms and sandy beaches differ in their ability to learn and memorize the spatial locations of tide pools in a simulated rocky inter-tidal zone. Gobies were tested individually for spatial learning using a small spatial scale rendition of a rock platform (tanks = 1162 cm 2), containing four artificial tide pools that retain varying depths of water at simulated low tide. The gobies were determined to have a capacity for spatial learning/ memory if they were able to repeatedly locate the tide pool that retains the most water at simulated low tide as the safest refuge. Rock pool species were able to relocate the correct pool to wait out low tide for ~ 95 % of the trials, while species from sandy shores appeared to have ignored the rock pools completely and followed the tide out (only found in the correct pool for ~ 10 % of trials). It is expected that rock pool species memorised the location of rock pools during simulated high tide so that they could be relocated at low tide. The ability to learn and recall the location of biologically important resources in a changing environment is essential for an animal’s survival and reproductive success. Chapter 5 investigated the cues gobies use when learning orientation routes, and determined if they varied depending on visual stability of their natural habitats. Gobies collected from rocky platforms and sandy beaches were trained to locate a hidden reward in a T-maze. Locating the reward required the fish to learn a body-centered pattern of movement (turn left or right) or to follow plant landmarks. This study found that rock pool species learnt the location of the correct shelter much faster, made fewer errors and used both types of cues available (plant landmarks and turn direction) to locate the shelter, while sand species relied significantly more on turn direction for orientation. For fish living in areas where predation is a high risk an effective strategy for escape, such as being able to relocate a refuge, should be of high importance. Chapter 6 investigated whether habitat stability influences spatial learning ability and cue use by comparing the performance of gobies from two contrasting habitats in their ability to locate shelter. Fish were trained to locate a shelter under the simulated threat of predation and asked weather they used local or global cues to do so. It was hypothesized that fish from rock pools would outperform fish from sandy shores and the two groups would differ in their cue use. This study found that rock pool species learnt the location of the correct shelter much faster, made fewer errors and used both types of cues available (local landmarks and global cues) to locate the shelter, while sand species relied significantly more on global cues for orientation. The results reported here support the hypothesis that fish living in complex habitats are more likely to rely on local landmarks as directional cues than fish living in mundane habitats, where local cues such as visual landmarks are unavailable. The ecological cognition hypothesis poses that brains and behaviour of individuals are largely shaped by environments in which they live and associated challenges they must overcome during their lives. Chapter 7 examined the effect of environmental complexity on relative brain size and structure in collected from rocky platforms and sandy beaches. Rock pool species are repeatedly found in their home pools at low tide, whereas beach dwelling species follow the tide out, hence it was predicted that these two groups would vary in brain structures as a function of habitat complexity. This study found that rock pool dwelling species had relatively larger brains and telencephalons in particular, while sand dwelling species had a larger optic tectum and hypothalamus. In general, it appears that various fish species trade off neural investment in specific brain lobes depending on the environment in which they live. We suggest that rock pool species require greater spatial learning abilities to navigate in their spatially complex environment, while sand dwelling species, on the other hand, likely have reduced need for spatial learning due to their spatially simple habitat and a greater need for visual acuity. When correlating brain structures with behavioural and environmental characteristics, a variety of techniques can be utilised. Chapter 8 quantitatively compared differing methodologies used to determine brain volumes using the conventional techniques of histology and approximating brain volume to an idealized ellipsoid (or half ellipsoid) and {{through the use of a}} 3 D model acquired using a micro-CT scanner. It was found that MRI and micro-CT methods generated more reliable results than those of histology and the ellipsoid method, however they are more expensive to generate. Over 350 goby species have established themselves within Australian waters, however, very few of these species have been included in phylogenetic analyses. Chapter 9 used partial mitochondrial D-Loop sequences to infer phylogeny among nine Australian goby species. Phylogenetic analysis identified a number of interrelationships among Australian gobiidae and produced a depiction of lineage evolution that is mostly consistent with previous studies. Four main lineages were identified within the Gobiids analysed which corresponds to the habitats they utilise; sand gobies were represented by the genera Acentrogobius, Favonigobius and Istigobius. Rockpool gobies were represented by a single genus Bathygobius, and the inshore goby lineage combined Glossogobius and Psammogobius into a clade. The final lineage, burrowing mud dwelling gobies, was represented by the genera Scartelaos and Taenioides. The phylogeny provides a greater understanding of how particular morphological characteristics, habitat preferences and behaviours have coevolved. These results pave the way for comparative studies of these common intertidal fish species. In summary, this research highlights the relationship between a gobies’ capacity for spatial learning/ memory and the environment, and will not only greatly extend our understanding of the evolutionary forces shaping learning and memory formation in fish but also in vertebrates generally.
