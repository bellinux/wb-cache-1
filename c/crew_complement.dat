5|$|The {{standard}} crew numbered 103 {{officers and}} 1,962 enlisted men. The crew {{was divided into}} twelve divisions of between 180 and 220 men. The first six divisions {{were assigned to the}} ship's armament, divisions one to four for the main and secondary batteries and five and six manning anti-aircraft guns. The seventh division consisted of specialists, including cooks and carpenters, and the eighth division consisted of ammunition handlers. The radio operators, signalmen, and quartermasters were assigned to the ninth division. The last three divisions were the engine room personnel. When Bismarck left port, fleet staff, prize crews, and war correspondents increased the <b>crew</b> <b>complement</b> to over 2,200 men. Roughly 200 of the engine room personnel came from the light cruiser , which had been lost during Operation Weserübung, the German invasion of Norway. Bismarcks crew published a ship's newspaper titled Die Schiffsglocke (The Ship's Bell); this paper was only published once, on 23 April 1941, by the commander of the engineering department, Gerhard Junack.|$|E

5|$|While the cutters {{were being}} shipped to Subic Bay, crew members started {{reporting}} to Coast Guard Training Center Alameda, California on 17 May 1965 for overseas processing and training. The cutter crews received one week of small arms training at Naval Amphibious Base Coronado and Camp Pendleton while Survival, Evasion, Resistance and Escape (SERE) training was received at Marine Corps Mountain Warfare Training Center, near Coleville, California, in the Sierra Nevada Mountains and at Whidbey Island Naval Air Station, Washington. Returning to Alameda, they underwent refresher firefighting and damage control training from the Navy at Treasure Island Naval Base. Additional weapons qualifications and live fire exercises {{were held at}} Coast Guard Island and Camp Parks, California, along with refresher training in radar navigation, radio procedures and visual signaling. Gun crews received mortar and machine gun training at Camp Pendleton. Of the 245 personnel assigned to the unit only 131 were present at the squadron commissioning ceremony held at Alameda on 27 May with {{the remainder of the}} crews in the process of completing training elsewhere. For service in Vietnam, two officers were added to the normal <b>crew</b> <b>complement</b> of eight to add seniority to the crew in the mission of interdicting vessels at sea. All officers assigned to command cutters were required to be lieutenants and to have previously commanded a Cape-class cutter and had to volunteer for the assignment. The executive officer was either a lieutenant junior grade or ensign.|$|E

25|$|One {{option would}} be to build {{additional}} Polaris platforms and keep more of them at sea. Two Resolutions would throw 96 warheads and almost guarantee penetration, while three {{would make it a}} certainty. This would require a fleet of at least five submarines to keep two on station at all times, as well as larger <b>crew</b> <b>complements,</b> training and logistics support, and appeared to be the most expensive option.|$|R
25|$|The {{effect of}} {{removing}} the boiler was to reduce maximum speed to 27.5 knots but {{the increase in}} fuel increased her range and her <b>crew</b> <b>complement</b> was raised to 193.|$|E
25|$|Kankakee {{was either}} brig or topsail schooner-rigged for {{auxiliary}} sail power. Her armament {{consisted of a}} single 30-pounder Parrott rifle, and five 24-pounder Dahlgren guns, including two pivot guns. She had a <b>crew</b> <b>complement</b> of 41 officers and enlisted men.|$|E
25|$|Constants <b>crew</b> <b>complement</b> was 35, {{including}} a Navy Lieutenant, a sailing master, a surgeon's mate, midshipman, six petty officers and 25 able or ordinary seamen. The crew {{was supported by}} a detachment of 15 Royal Marines, bringing total on-board personnel to 50 men.|$|E
50|$|The {{conversions}} left Tiger and Blake some 380 tons heavier {{with a full}} {{displacement of}} 12,080 tons and their <b>crew</b> <b>complements</b> increased by 169 to 885. Originally, Lion was also to have been converted, although this never materialised: Blakes conversion had been more expensive than envisaged (£5.5 million) and so funds were no longer available. Ironically Tigers conversion cost even more (£13.25 million), such was the level of inflation at the time. After much material was stripped off her for use as spares for her sisters, Lion was subsequently sold for breaking up in 1975.|$|R

25|$|The <b>crew</b> <b>complement</b> {{is listed}} in some recent sources as 114 {{officers}} and men; however, DANFS and other sources give varying figures for the individual ships, ranging from a complement of 65 (Sciota) to 94 (Aroostook), with an average per ship of 80. The reason for these apparent discrepancies is unknown.|$|E
25|$|Branding and {{publicity}} efforts have revolved primarily around flight crew, {{in contrast to}} most other airlines, who tend to emphasise aircraft and services in general. In particular, the promotion of its female flight attendants known as Singapore Girls has been widely successful and is a common feature {{in most of the}} airline's advertisements and publications. This branding strategy aims to build a mythical aura around the Singapore Girl, and portray her as representative of Asian hospitality and grace and the airline's training program for both cabin and technical flight <b>crew</b> <b>complement</b> this objective. This is similar to the tactics that Pan Am used as they also tried to promote their stewardesses as a big attraction to flying on the airline.|$|E

50|$|A gun yawl (kanonjolle) {{also had}} two {{collapsible}} masts and was {{armed with a}} stern chaser. The heavy gun and {{the small size of}} the vessel required that the design have a distinct tail for stability. Designed along same principles as the slightly larger gun sloops, the yawls were roughly 11 to 15.3 meters in length while having draft of only 0.75 meters. They had 5 - 10 oar pairs with one man at each oar, and they were equipped with two collapsible masts. Armament consisted of single 18- to 24-pound gun at stern. Their advantage was their shallow draft and their low <b>crew</b> <b>complements</b> (only 24 men or so).|$|R

25|$|At {{the request}} of the United States Navy, in April 1965, she was alerted for service in Vietnam and {{assigned}} to Coast Guard Squadron One in support of Operation Market Time along with 16 other Point class cutters. While the crew completed overseas training and weapons qualifications at Coast Guard Island and Camp Parks, California, Point Arden was loaded onto a merchant ship, and transported to Subic Bay, Philippines in May 1965 where she was refit for combat service. Shipyard modifications included installation of new single-sideband radio equipment, additional floodlights, small arms lockers, bunks, additional sound-powered phone circuits, and the addition of 4 M-2 machine guns. The original bow mounted machine gun was replaced with a combination over-under 50 caliber machine gun/81mm trigger fired mortar that had been developed by the Coast Guard for service in Vietnam. For service in Vietnam, two officers were added to the <b>crew</b> <b>complement</b> to add seniority to the crew in the mission of interdicting vessels at sea.|$|E
25|$|The {{experience}} gained {{in designing the}} Project 17 Shivalik-class frigates will {{be applied to the}} Project 17A (P17A). The Project 17A frigates will improve upon the Project 17 (P17) in terms of stealth. They will have covered mooring deck and the number of antennae on the ship will be reduced by using a AESA radar. The P17A will also feature better roll stabilisation and a discreet visual profile. The weapon platform in the P17A ships will be compact and they will be armed with the Barak 8 (missile) surface-to-air missile developed jointly by India and Israel, and the BrahMos supersonic cruise missile. The weapon systems will be flush deck mounted allowing vertical launch of missiles from under the deck. The <b>crew</b> <b>complement</b> will be reduced from the existing 257 (including 35 officers) to about 150 by using high levels of automation, which will reduce the operational costs by around 20 per cent and result in higher operational availability of the warships. The construction times will be reduced and productivity will improved by using modular integrated construction. The ship will have a displacement of 6,670 tonnes.|$|E

5000|$|Prior to the Clone Wars, the Old Republic had {{constructed}} {{a fleet of}} 200 Dreadnaught-class heavy cruisers that were highly automated, to reduce their <b>crew</b> <b>complements</b> from 16,000 to 2,000 without diminishing their firepower. The flagship was the Katana and hence the fleet was designated the Katana fleet, and unofficially called the [...] "Dark Force". Unfortunately, a virus infected the crews of the entire fleet and drove them insane. The madness caused the crews to [...] "slave" [...] the controls of all their ships to the Katana, and jump blindly into hyperspace.

50|$|As {{built in}} 1904, Swiftsure was a steel-hulled ship 112 ft long. She was {{extended}} to 129 ft in 1930, with a beam of 28 ft and a draft of 12 ft. Her displacement is 668 tons. Her aids to navigation include a 1,000 watt primary light, a 140-decibel Diaphone horn, and a 1000 lb foredeck fog bell. She was driven by a single screw powered by a 380-horsepower marine steam engine fired by coal boilers. It has two bunkers, {{each of which has}} a capacity of 75 tons of coal, and a freshwater hold for crew use that holds more than 11,000 gallons. During her active service she had a normal <b>crew's</b> <b>complement</b> of 15, with 11 on duty at any given time. Her power plant was converted to diesel in the 1930s, the coal bunkers converted to hold diesel fuel. Her lights, originally powered by whale oil, were first converted to kerosene, and were later electrified.|$|R

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThis research examines the manpower systems integration factors for frigate {{design in the}} Turkish Navy. The qualitative and quantitative analyses of the correlation between ship design specifications and manpower requirements play {{a pivotal role in}} this research. Information about 45 frigate classes from 29 countries is collected from the Information Handling Services Jane's Fighting Ships database and varying approaches of different nations in manning of the frigates in their navies are discussed in detail. Furthermore, a regression analysis is conducted by fitting a model using the sample data to examine the variance in <b>crew</b> <b>complements</b> of those frigates. The correlation between the ship design characteristics and the manpower requirements is supported by the quantitative analysis. This research supports the importance of using Human Systems Integration in the Turkish frigate design. Adoption of a standard workweek by the Turkish Navy to measure the man-hours required to develop a Ship Manpower Document for the Turkish Frigate– 2000 project is recommended. This research also recommends expanding the Human Systems Integration domains in frigate procurement. Lieutenant Junior Grade, Turkish Nav...|$|R
