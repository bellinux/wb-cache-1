50|$|Now the {{ordinance}} does not exclude, expressly or by necessary implication, the remedy of interdict to enforce observance of s 4(1). That remedy, {{as pointed out}} above, is applicable to future or continuing breaches; the statutory remedy of prosecution and punishment under s 4(2) relates to past breaches; and the two can therefore co-exist without any conflict. Consequently the reasoning above for excluding the civil remedy for recovering arrear fees and penalties does not apply. Hence, in my view, future or <b>continuing</b> <b>breaches</b> of s 4(1) can be restrained by interdict.|$|R

40|$|Legal rights may erode as {{a result}} of past, uncontested, breach. In light of ongoing violations, the rightholder's {{enforcement}} may result in the loss of the entitlement. The doctrines, of course, of performance in contract law and adverse possession in property law are prominent examples of this widespread erosion phenomenon. In analyzing the effects of such laws, the Article confronts two conflicting intuitions. On the one hand, the "license" to <b>continue</b> <b>breach</b> prospectively encourages opportunism. On the other hand, the risk of erosion may reinforce the rightholder's motivation to take anti-erosion measures, bolstering the credibility of the threat to enforce, thus better preserving the entitlement. The article proves that these two effects of erosion rules always balance out. The same amount of value will be extracted from the right holder irrespective of the law's erosion doctrine. The article also demonstrates the limits of this "irrelevance" claim and the factors that may lead to its collapse. It applies the analysis to offer new perspectives on various prominent legal rules...|$|R

Despite this, the Eagles started the season in good form, winning their opening 6 matches, including another one-point victory over the Sydney Swans. However the Eagles of 2007 were nowhere near as dominant as those of 2005 or 2006. Instead, the Eagles {{spent much of the}} year in the bottom part of the top four, even slipping out of the top four at times. At the end of the season, the Eagles finished third on the ladder, drawing an away final at Port Adelaide in the opening week of the finals.The Eagles finals series was cruelled by injuries to key players, something that had been quite common in the latter half of the season, exacerbated by a hamstring injury to Ben Cousins when leading Port Adelaide in the first week. Ultimately West Coast crashed out of the finals in straight sets, losing to Port by three points in the opening week before losing to Collingwood by 19 points in a highly exciting final that went into extra time for only the second time since the extra time rule had been implemented.|$|R

Sometimes, however, if this happens in a match to determine the challenger for a heel champion's title, the champion is forced to face both opponents simultaneously for the title. Usually, the double disqualification is caused by the heel wrestler's associates in a match between two face wrestlers to determine his opponent.|$|R

40|$|The {{adoption}} of positioning technologies to supplement, complement and function as defense intelligence applications has become widely accepted within {{homeland security and}} military circles. At the core of advancement are four main positioning technologies. Specifically these are the global positioning system (GPS), second generation (2 G) and beyond mobile telephone networks (including wireless data networks), radio-frequency identification (RFID) and geographic information systems (GIS). For all positioning technologies, both separately and when combined, it is of primary importance to their continued adoption that the controlling powers have an in-depth understanding of the causality between implementation, usage and flow-on effect. This relies on an alignment of defense strategy, knowledge systems, security requirements and citizen rights within the broader social context.

60|$|Here we may {{observe and}} I {{hope it will}} not be amiss to take notice of it that a near view of death would soon {{reconcile}} men of good principles one to another, and that it is chiefly owing to our easy situation in life and our putting these things far from us that our breaches are fomented, ill blood <b>continued,</b> prejudices, <b>breach</b> of charity and of Christian union, so much kept and so far carried on among us as it is. Another plague year would reconcile all these differences; a close conversing with death, or with diseases that threaten death, would scum off the gall from our tempers, remove the animosities among us, and bring us to see with differing eyes than those which we looked on things with before. As the people who had been used to join with the Church were reconciled at this time with the admitting the Dissenters to preach to them, so the Dissenters, who with an uncommon prejudice had broken off from the communion of the Church of England, were now content to come to their parish churches and to conform to the worship which they did not approve of before; but as the terror of the infection abated, those things all returned again to their less desirable channel and to the course they were in before.|$|R
50|$|Suspension or {{temporary}} exclusion {{is mandatory}} leave {{assigned to a}} student {{as a form of}} punishment that can last anywhere from one day to a few weeks, during which time the student is not allowed to attend regular lessons. In some US, UK, Australian and Canadian schools, {{there are two types of}} suspension: In-School (ISS, Internal Exclusion or Isolation) and Out-of-School (OSS, Off-Campus Suspension, External Exclusion). In-school requires the student to report to school as usual but attend a designated suspension classroom or room all day. Out-of-school suspension bans the student from being on school grounds during school hours while school is in session. Students who breach a suspension by attending school may be arrested for, and charged with trespassing. This could result in an extension of suspension, community service, and sometimes jail time. Students who <b>continue</b> to <b>breach</b> a suspension could be expelled from school and sentenced to longer, more severe punishments. Students are also not allowed to attend after school activities (such as proms, sporting events, etc.) while suspended from school.Schools are often required to notify the student's parents/guardians of the reason for and duration of the out-of-school suspension, and usually also for in-school suspensions. Suspended students are often required to continue to learn and complete assignments from the days in which they miss instruction.|$|R

30|$|A threat {{protocol}} {{to safeguard the}} oil platform workers and the natural environment is instituted {{so that when the}} outer circle is breached by ice, the steps of a shutdown and evacuation sequence are initiated. We consider a three-level threat model. When ice is outside the outer concentric circle, a threat level of zero exists. When ice breaches the outermost circle, the FPSO makes ready for sea, incurring a modest cost in fuel burned. If the ice leaves the outermost circle again, this step can be reversed. If, on the other hand, ice <b>continues</b> to <b>breach</b> the second circle, the FPSO must shut down oil production, at a much heavier cost. Even ignoring any petroleum engineering consequences, the result is to defer production of oil from the present {{to the end of the}} reservoir’s life. This incurs a known cost of 100, 000 x today’s oil price, with a countervailing benefit of 100, 000 x the oil price 10 [*]years from now, discounted to the present day at an appropriate interest rate (spread over the London Interbank Offered Rate, LIBOR). If we assume that today’s oil price is US$ 70 per barrel, discounted at 6 %, and that the value of oil grows simply with a 2 % inflation rate, the cost of deferring a day’s production is about $ 2.25 million. Naturally, this result is very sensitive to the underlying oil price assumptions.|$|R
