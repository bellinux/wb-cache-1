Kotecha had already previously collaborated with Grande when producing the first, second, third and fourth single from My Everything. Guetta was working on his album Listen, and while making the album he chose to give [...] "One Last Time" [...] to Grande, since [...] " [...] had like 120 songs and [...] trying to make an album that ma sense {{because some of the}} songs <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>great,</b> but that doesn’t mean that they would fit together. [...] one example," [...] he claimed. [...] "One Last Time" [...] was strongly considered to be My Everythings lead-single, according to Republic Records' executive vice president Charlie Walk, however [...] "Problem" [...] was chosen instead, being the song that best [...] "set the tone for the project." [...] Later, [...] ""Break Free" [...] felt like summer," [...] Walk claimed, while [...] "Bang Bang" [...] helped usher in Jessie J's album Sweet Talker, and [...] "fall/winter felt like the best time for [...] "Love Me Harder", since it's a heavier, darker record," [...] he added.|$|E

500|$|Vig {{recalled}} that the title [...] "Not Your Kind of People" [...] {{came to him}} when he was stuck in a traffic jam in Los Angeles; he texted Manson the idea for a title and she loved it. Manson wrote all the lyrics that night, and the next day the four of them gathered with acoustic guitars and wrote the music to the song in about half an hour. Manson explained that the album title Not Your Kind of People was [...] "a call to arms in a way to anyone who feels like we do about the world", saying that [...] "it <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>great</b> to be outsider." [...] She felt that this applied to them as the band [...] "never fit into a music scene" [...] and that [...] "in my life I've never been an insider." [...] Manson also described the title as [...] "a two-fingered salute to people who reject or criticize us", stating the band was [...] "only really interested in people who share our outlook" [...] as she considered that their fans were [...] "the people who connect with what you're saying and how you say it." ...|$|E
500|$|In January 2017, a {{group of}} Chinese {{children}} garnered significant attention when a video of them reenacting the [...] "Honor to Us All" [...] musical sequence in their native language was released to the Internet and went viral. First shared by the Facebook page Disney Power, the video was eventually identified as a segment from a Chinese television show that features children reenacting scenes from popular films. The child actress who portrays Grandmother Fa in the reenactment has been widely commended for her performance, who Oh My Disney described as [...] "in it to win it." [...] Boing Boing's Caroline Siede wrote that the actress [...] "perfectly captures Mulan's grandmother". Praising the children's accuracy as upon reviewing a video that compares the live-action reenactment to the animated original side-by-side, Refinery29's Michael Hafford wrote that the children [...] "remind how ridiculous it is that Hollywood more or less refuses to cast non-white actors in lead roles", specifically referring to the whitewashing controversy surrounding American actors Matt Damon and Scarlett Johansson's casting in the films The Great Wall (2016) and Ghost in the Shell (2017), respectively. Hafford continued, [...] "if literal children <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>great</b> in a scene from Mulan, why can't movie studios give roles to, like, adults?" ...|$|E

2500|$|The 1918 {{pandemic}} killed tens {{of millions}} and sickened hundreds of millions; the loss of this {{many people in the}} population caused upheaval and psychological damage to many people. There were not enough doctors, hospital rooms, or medical supplies for the living as they contracted the disease. Dead bodies were [...] often left unburied as few people were available to deal with them. There <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>great</b> social disruption as well as a sense of fear. Efforts to deal with pandemics can leave a great deal to be desired because of human selfishness, lack of trust, illegal behavior, and ignorance. For example, in the 1918 pandemic: [...] "This horrific disconnect between reassurances and reality destroyed the credibility of those in authority. People felt they had no one to turn to, no one to rely on, no one to trust." ...|$|E
2500|$|The spun fibers are {{generally}} divided into animal fibers, plant and synthetic fibers. [...] These fiber types are chemically different, corresponding to proteins, carbohydrates and synthetic polymers, respectively. [...] Animal fibers include silk, but generally are long hairs of {{animals such as}} sheep (wool), goat (angora, or cashmere goat), rabbit (angora), llama, alpaca, dog, cat, camel, yak, and muskox (qiviut). [...] Plants used for fibers include cotton, flax (for linen), bamboo, ramie, hemp, jute, nettle, raffia, yucca, coconut husk, banana fiber, soy and corn. [...] Rayon and acetate fibers are also produced from cellulose mainly derived from trees. [...] Common synthetic fibers include acrylics, polyesters such as dacron and ingeo, nylon and other polyamides, and olefins such as polypropylene. [...] Of these types, wool is generally favored for knitting, chiefly owing to its superior elasticity, warmth and (sometimes) felting; however, wool is generally less convenient to clean {{and some people are}} allergic to it. [...] It is also common to blend different fibers in the yarn, e.g., 85% alpaca and 15% silk. [...] Even within a type of fiber, there <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>great</b> variety in the length and thickness of the fibers; for example, Merino wool and Egyptian cotton are favored because they produce exceptionally long, thin (fine) fibers for their type.|$|E

60|$|Perhaps it is {{pertinent}} {{to remember that}} Mr. Carlyle, in fact, is a prophet with a faith, and he holds the opposition kind of religionist in a peculiarly theological execration.
