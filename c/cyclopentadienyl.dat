5|$|Berkelium forms a {{trigonal}} (η5–C5H5)3Bk metallocene complex {{with three}} <b>cyclopentadienyl</b> rings, {{which can be}} synthesized by reacting berkelium(III) chloride with the molten beryllocene (Be(C5H5)2) at about 70 °C. It has an amber color and a density of 2.47 g/cm3. The complex is stable to heating to at least 250 °C, and sublimates without melting at about 350 °C. The high radioactivity of berkelium gradually destroys the compound (within a period of weeks). One <b>cyclopentadienyl</b> ring in (η5–C5H5)3Bk can be substituted by chlorine to yield 2.

5|$|It is soluble in benzene and THF, and is less {{sensitive}} to oxygen and water than Pu(C5H5)3 and Am(C5H5)3. Other Np(IV) <b>cyclopentadienyl</b> compounds {{are known for}} many ligands: they have the general formula (C5H5)3NpL, where L represents a ligand.|$|E

25|$|Most of {{the work}} on organothorium {{compounds}} {{has focused on the}} <b>cyclopentadienyls</b> and cyclooctatetraenyls. Like many of the early and middle actinides (thorium through americium, and also expected for curium), thorium forms the yellow cyclooctatetraenide complex Th(C8H8)2, thorocene. It is isotypic with the more well-known analogous uranium compound, uranocene. Although these f-series cyclooctatetraenyls are not isotypic with the d-series <b>cyclopentadienyls,</b> including the more famous ferrocene, they have very similar structures, and were named to emphasise this resemblance. It can be prepared by reacting K2C8H8 with thorium tetrachloride in tetrahydrofuran (THF) at the temperature of dry ice, or by reacting thorium tetrafluoride with MgC8H8. It is an unstable compound in air and outright decomposes in water or at 190°C. Half-sandwich compounds are also known, such as 2(η8-C8H8)ThCl2(THF)2, which has a piano-stool structure and is made by reacting thorocene with thorium tetrachloride in tetrahydrofuran.|$|R
5|$|BF4 forms a {{colourless}} centrosymmetric monoclinic crystal {{belonging to}} the P21/c space group, and with a density of 1.486gcm−3. Looking at the ORTEP diagram {{of the structure of}} the cation (at right), it is evident that it possesses the typical geometry expected of a rhodocene or rhodocenium cation. The two <b>cyclopentadienyl</b> rings are close to parallel (the centroid–Rh–centroid angle is 177.2°) and the rhodium centre is slightly closer to the substituted <b>cyclopentadienyl</b> ring (Rh–centroid distances are 1.819Å and 1.795Å), an observation attributed to the greater inductive effect of the tert-butyl groups on the substituted ligand. The ORTEP diagram shows that the cation adopts an eclipsed conformation in the solid state. The crystal structure of the hexafluorophosphate salt shows three crystallographically independent cations, one eclipsed, one staggered, and one which is rotationally disordered. This suggests that the conformation adopted is dependent on the anion present and also that the energy barrier to rotation is low – in ferrocene, the rotational energy barrier is known to be ~5kJmol−1 in both solution and gas phase.|$|E
5|$|Organometallic {{compounds}} {{by definition}} contain {{at least one}} carbon-metal bond. A wide range of such compounds exist; major classes include simple alkyl-metal compounds (for example, tetraethyllead), η-alkene compounds (for example, Zeise's salt), and η-allyl compounds (for example, allylpalladium chloride dimer); metallocenes containing <b>cyclopentadienyl</b> ligands (for example, ferrocene); and transition metal carbene complexes. Many metal carbonyls exist (for example, tetracarbonylnickel); some workers consider the carbon monoxide ligand to be purely inorganic, and not organometallic.|$|E
5|$|Organothallium {{compounds}} {{tend to be}} thermally unstable, in concordance {{with the}} trend of decreasing thermal stability down group 13. The chemical reactivity of the Tl–C bond is also {{the lowest in the}} group, especially for ionic compounds of the type R2TlX. Thallium forms the stable + ion in aqueous solution: like the isoelectronic Hg(CH3)2 and 2+, it is linear. Trimethylthallium and triethylthallium are, like the corresponding gallium and indium compounds, flammable liquids with low melting points. Like indium, thallium <b>cyclopentadienyl</b> compounds contain thallium(I), in contrast to gallium(III).|$|E
30|$|The major {{breakthrough}} {{in this area}} was achieved in the mid 1990 ’s, when β-diketiminates were used as spectator ligands, thus offering strong metal-ligand bonds like <b>cyclopentadienyls</b> (Scheme  1). In contrast to the latter, β-diketiminates offer a possibility of subtle tuning of their electronic and steric properties by simple variation of the substituents on nitrogen and adjacent carbon atoms.|$|R
25|$|A {{second group}} at British Oxygen also unknowingly {{discovered}} ferrocene. Miller, Tebboth and Tremaine {{were trying to}} synthesise amines from hydrocarbons such as cyclopentadiene and ammonia in a modification of the Haber process. They published this result in 1952 although the actual work was done three years earlier. The stability of the new organoiron compound was accorded to the aromatic character of the negatively charged <b>cyclopentadienyls,</b> {{but they were not}} the ones to recognize the η5 (pentahapto) sandwich structure.|$|R

5|$|Protactinium(IV) forms a {{tetrahedral}} complex tetrakis(cyclopentadienyl)protactinium(IV) (or Pa(C5H5)4) {{with four}} <b>cyclopentadienyl</b> rings, {{which can be}} synthesized by reacting protactinium(IV) chloride with molten Be(C5H5)2. One ring can be substituted with a halide atom. Another organometallic complex is golden-yellow bis(π-cyclooctatetraene) protactinium, or protactinocene, Pa(C8H8)2, which is analogous in structure to uranocene. There, the metal atom is sandwiched between two cyclooctatetraene ligands. Similar to uranocene, it can be prepared by reacting protactinium tetrachloride with dipotassium cyclooctatetraenide, K2C8H8, in tetrahydrofuran.|$|E

5|$|Owing {{to their}} {{stability}} and relative ease of preparation, rhodocenium salts are the usual starting material for preparing rhodocene and substituted rhodocenes, {{all of which}} are unstable. The original synthesis used a <b>cyclopentadienyl</b> anion and tris(acetylacetonato)rhodium(III); numerous other approaches have since been reported, including gas-phase redox transmetalation and using half-sandwich precursors. Octaphenylrhodocene (a derivative with eight phenyl groups attached) was the first substituted rhodocene to be isolated at room temperature, though it decomposes rapidly in air. X-ray crystallography confirmed that octaphenylrhodocene has a sandwich structure with a staggered conformation. Unlike cobaltocene, which has become a useful one-electron reducing agent in research, no rhodocene derivative yet discovered is stable enough for such applications.|$|E

40|$|The {{reaction}} of cobalt dinitrosyl complexes with alkenes to form cobalt dinitrosoalkane complexes {{is used to}} effect the C-H functionalization of alkenes. Deprotonation of cobalt dinitrosoalkane complexes, followed by reaction with neutral electrophiles, yields functionalized cobalt complexes. Thermolysis of such complexes with the parent alkene allows a migration of the cobalt dinitrosyl moiety to the parent alkene, releasing the organic product of C-H functionalization. Progress is presented towards rendering this sequence of reactions catalytic in cobalt. Additionally, the use of reagents derived from Cinchona alkaloids allows for this functionalization to be rendered enantioselective. The enantioselective chemistry has been utilized in the synthesis of chiral diene ligands for rhodium-catalyzed conjugate addition reactions. The use of hydridotris(pyrazolyl) borates, in place of <b>cyclopentadienyls,</b> as spectator ligands for cobalt dinitrosoalkane complexes, is also explored, and the electronic structure of a cobalt mononitrosyl complex studied...|$|R
5|$|The {{alkali metals}} and their {{hydrides}} react with acidic hydrocarbons, for example cyclopentadienes and terminal alkynes, to give salts. Liquid ammonia, ether, or hydrocarbon solvents are used, {{the most common}} of which being tetrahydrofuran. The most important of these compounds is sodium cyclopentadienide, NaC5H5, an important precursor to many transition metal <b>cyclopentadienyl</b> derivatives. Similarly, the alkali metals react with cyclooctatetraene in tetrahydrofuran to give alkali metal cyclooctatetraenides; for example, dipotassium cyclooctatetraenide (K2C8H8) is an important precursor to many metal cyclooctatetraenyl derivatives, such as uranocene. The large and very weakly polarising alkali metal cations can stabilise large, aromatic, polarisable radical anions, such as the dark-green sodium naphthalenide, Na+−, a strong reducing agent.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} {{motivation for}} research {{investigations of the}} rhodocene system {{was to understand the}} nature of and bonding within the metallocene class of compounds. In more recent times, interest has been rekindled by the desire to explore and apply the metal–metal interactions that occur when metallocene systems are linked. Potential applications for such systems include molecular electronics, semi-conducting (and possibly ferromagnetic) metallocene polymers (an example of a molecular wire), and exploring the threshold between heterogeneous and homogeneous catalysis. Examples of known bimetallocenes and termetallocenes that possess the rhodocenyl moiety include the hexafluorophosphate salts of rhodocenylferrocene, 1,1'-dirhodocenylferrocene, and 1-cobaltocenyl-1'-rhodocenylferrocene, each shown at right. Linked metallocenes can also be formed by introducing several metallocenyl substituents onto a single <b>cyclopentadienyl</b> ligand.|$|E
5|$|The {{team from}} the University of Mainz were {{planning}} to study the electrodeposition of hassium atoms using the new TASCA facility at the GSI. Their aim was to use the reaction 226Ra(48Ca,4n)270Hs. In addition, scientists at the GSI were hoping to utilize TASCA to study the synthesis and properties of the hassium(II) compound hassocene, Hs(C5H5)2, using the reaction 226Ra(48Ca,xn). This compound {{is analogous to the}} lighter ferrocene, ruthenocene, and osmocene, and is expected to have the two <b>cyclopentadienyl</b> rings in an eclipsed conformation like ruthenocene and osmocene and not in a staggered conformation like ferrocene. Hassocene was chosen because it has hassium in the low formal oxidation state of +2 (although the bonding between the metal and the rings is mostly covalent in metallocenes) rather than the high +8 state which had previously been investigated, and relativistic effects were expected to be stronger in the lower oxidation state. Many metals in the periodic table form metallocenes, so that trends could be more easily determined, and the highly symmetric structure of hassocene and its low number of atoms also make relativistic calculations easier. Hassocene should be a stable and highly volatile compound.|$|E
