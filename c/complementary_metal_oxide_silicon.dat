40|$|International audienceOwing {{to their}} {{physical}} and electrical properties, semiconducting nanowires {{are the subject}} of intense research activities. In particular, silicon nanowires (SiNWs) are full compatible with the high reliable well known CMOS (<b>Complementary</b> <b>Metal</b> <b>Oxide</b> Semiconductor) <b>silicon</b> technology. In addition, thanks to their high surface to volume ratio, SiNWs are good candidates for fabrication of high sensitive chemical sensors. SiNWs can be prepared by one of two approaches, "top-down" or "bottom up". In a bottom up strategy the individual base elements (atoms, molecules [...] .) of the system are linked together to form larger subsystems. The main drawbacks of these synthesis methods for a 3 D integration are the difficulty in control of size and positioning of the nanowires. In this case, nanowires need to be selectively collected and manipulated to be assembled in a planar layout. The "top down" approach starts from bulk materials and scales down the patterned areas. In this way, several advanced lithographic tools with nanometer size resolution rest on the high cost generated, and more generally the low throughput capability is unsuitable with mass production. In this work, undoped silicon nanowires are fabricated following these tow approaches: i) Au-catalyst vapour liquid solid (VLS) SiNWs [1] (bottom-up), and ii) suspended sidewall spacer (SS) polycristalline SiNWs (top down) [2]. SiNWs are integrated into resistors used as gas (ammonia) sensors. Fabrication of two types of SiNWs based devices uses classical silicon microelectronic technologies [3]. Specific design is developed for VLS SiNWs based resistors to be compatible with a mass production planar layout. Fabrication of SS-polySiNWs based devices uses classical lithographic tools. Ammonia molecules adsorbed on the surface of undoped SiNWs act as electron donors (reducing agents) resulting to an increase of the current into the nanowires. Then, ammonia detection is performed by measuring current into SiNWs based resistors. Measurements are carried out at room temperature, in a vacuum chamber, under controlled ammonia/nitrogen (NH 3 :N 2) mixture varying from 2 ppm to 700 ppm. Results highlight that the relative response, Sg, defined as Sg=(I-Ig) /I where I and Ig are the current values for devices in vacuum and reactive ambient respectively, is higher for suspended polycristalline SiNWs based devices, probably related to a high structural defects density. For both sensors, response to ammonia detection follows a linear behaviour for ammonia concentration lower than 350 ppm, and relative sensitivity, S=Sg/NH 3, is 99. 5 %/ppm. These results show potential use of these nanowires for charged chemical species detection in a fully compatible silicon CMOS technology. [1] Ni L., Demami F., Rogel R., Salaun A.

Over time more and more devices get built-in wireless capabilities in connecting to internet or other devices. As well the amount of data to be transferred increase dramatically. This explosive development of wireless communication and its applications has created high demand for portable wireless devices that are smaller, lighter, and cheaper and of higher performance that ever. To be able to achieve those requirements new system architectures and circuit topologies need to be utilized.

40|$|A {{new type}} of active pixel sensors (APSs) to track charged {{particles}} for particle physics experiments or to count number of electrons that cross any pixel at the focal plane of electron microscopes is described. The electric field of desirable shape is created inside the active volume of the pixel introducing the drift component in {{the movement of the}} signal electrons towards charge collecting electrodes. The electric field results from the flow of 100 mA/cm 2 hole currents within individual pixels of the sensor. The proposed sensor is produced using a standard industrially available <b>complementary</b> <b>metal</b> <b>oxide</b> <b>silicon</b> (CMOS) process. There are two main advantages of the proposed detectors when compared to the present (February 2005) state-of-the-art, i. e. field-free APS sensors. The first advantage of a field-assisted transport mechanism is the reduction of the charge collection time and of the sharing of the signal electrons between adjacent pixels by diffusion. The second advantage is the freedom to use both kinds of MOS transistors within each pixel of the sensor. Thus, the full functional power of CMOS circuits can be embedded in situ. As an example, 16 -bit scalers will be implemented in each pixel of the sensor for electron microscopy. The reduced collection time combined with the state-of-the-art electronics within each pixel provides the most complete information about the position and the timing of incident charged particles for particle physics experiments. Position resolution of new sensors was computationally simulated to be a few microns, that is, the same as the resolution of standard APSs. Moreover, the active depth of the sensor and the associate electronics is less than about 20 μm and a thinned down sensor together with its beryllium backing can have a total thickness of less than 0. 1 % of one radiation length. The reduction of the thickness of the detector reduces the amount of multiple scattering within the detector.

The minimum CMOS feature size is presently about one micron and it is certain that feature dimensions will reach the submicron range in mid nineties.;Smaller dimensions yield advantages, namely greater speed, higher device complexity and performance, and disadvantages such as greater susceptibility to electrical damage. During the past few years, the reliability of CMOS integrated circuits has received much attention, matched by publications on the subject. Higher reliability hardened integrated circuits have been developed as a response to demands for simplified shielding and demands for more reliable systems operating in hostile environments. The key step in developing hardened integrated circuits is the study of the mechanisms that make them fail. By understanding the failure conditions one can design more reliable components, select more suitable materials, and improve in-process control and screening. Also, it allows to develop test patterns, or accelerated test strategies for the evaluation of the integrated circuits susceptibility to damage.;In this study, a series of measurements were performed on a variety of custom fabricated CMOS Charge-Coupled Devices (CCDs) and dedicated modular test structures to investigate the latent model of failure due to Electrostatic Discharge (ESD). Test devices were stressed using the current injection method and measurements of the quiescent current were used to detect the failure thresholds.

40|$|We present two VLSI (Very Large Scale Integration) designs. The {{first one}} in this thesis is the digital Delay-Locked Loop (DLL) design, and the second one is the {{prefetch}} unit of ARM processor. The improvement of CMOS (<b>Complementary</b> <b>Metal</b> <b>Oxide</b> <b>Silicon)</b> process technology makes the VLSI system operate {{at a very high}} speed in recent years. In high-speed synchronous systems, the clock skews may make the system clock asynchronous among storage elements and thus affect the system operation. As a result, clock alignment circuits are necessary. DLL is a good clock alignment circuit that synchronizes the clocks inside and outside a chip in a synchronous system. It can be implemented in analog or digital circuit. Digital DLLs are preferred over analog ones because they are easy to design and portable over various processes. In this thesis we present an all-digital DLL design that can operate at 400 MHz. There are two advantages of this design. First, it is all-digital, and there are no analog devices in the circuit. Second, its structure is simpler, and thus the final silicon area will be smaller. The prefetch unit is used to predict and fetch instructions before they are actually used so that the idle cycles due to instruction fetch can be reduced. The architecture and implementation of an ARM prefetch unit is presented {{in the second part of}} this thesis. 本論文分為兩個主題：第一部分是數位延遲鎖定迴路的研究與實作，第二部分是ARM微處理器的預先讀取單元之設計。 CMOS半導體製程技術的快速成長使得超大型積體電路之運作時脈頻率快速增加。在高速運作的同步系統中，時脈偏斜所造成時脈不同步的現象嚴重威脅系統運作的正確性。因此，時脈校正電路是必要的。 延遲鎖定迴路是解決同步系統中電路內部時脈與外部時脈不同步的一種時脈校正電路。電路設計方法可採類比式設計也可採數位式設計。數位式延遲鎖定迴路的優點為易於設計，且可移植到不同的製程。本篇論文提出一個全數位式可於時脈頻率為 400 MHz的同步系統下校正時脈的全數位式延遲鎖定迴路。相較於以前提出的延遲鎖定迴路，本方法的優點為：（ 1 ）全數位式電路，無任何類比元件；（ 2 ）結構簡單，故面積較小。 預先讀取單元是用來預先讀取連續的指令以減少微處理機閒置的時間。在本論文中我們詳述了此單元的微架構及實作，其邏輯閘層亦驗證無誤。第一章 簡介……………………………………………………………… [...] … 1 1. 1 研究動機……………………………………………………………… [...] 1 1. 2 內容大綱……………………………………………………………… [...] 2 第二章 背景知識……………………………… [...] …… [...] ………… [...] ……… [...] . 3 2. 1 系統時序……………………………………………………………… [...] 3 2. 2 延遲鎖定迴路之概念………………………………………………… [...] 7 2. 3 文獻中相關之研究…………………………………………………… [...] 8 第三章 系統架構分析…………………………………………… [...] ………. 11 3. 1 延遲路徑……………………………………………………………… 12 3. 1. 1 延遲線元件………………………………………………………. 12 3. 1. 2 相位攪拌器………………………………………………………. 14 3. 1. 3 多工器與時脈樹…………………………………………………. 19 3. 2 相位偵測器…………………………………………………………… 20 3. 3 鎖定控制電路………………………………………………………… 21 第四章 實驗結果分析…………………………………. … [...] ……………. 24 4. 1 延遲路徑之模擬……………………………………………………… 24 4. 1. 1 延遲線元件之模擬………………………………………………. 24 4. 1. 2 相位攪拌器之模擬………………………………………………. 26 4. 1. 3 多工器之模擬……………………………………………………. 28 4. 2 相位偵測器之模擬…………………………………………………… 30 4. 3 鎖定控制電路與整體之模擬………………………………………… 32 第五章 ARM 8 核心處理器之預先讀取單元………………… [...] … [...] … [...] . 40 5. 1 電路微架構描述……………………………………………………… 40 5. 1. 1 預測分支策略……………………………………………………. 40 5. 1. 2 訊號描述…………………………………………………………. 41 5. 2 電路內部描述………………………………………………………… 43 5. 2. 1 電路內部方塊描述………………………………………………. 43 5. 2. 2 Branch FSM & Fetch方塊之描述……………………………. …. 46 5. 2. 3 緩衝區控制電路………………………………………………. … 49 5. 3 實作………………………………………………………………… [...] 51 第六章 結論與未來工作………………………………………………… [...] 52 參考文獻…………………………………………………………………… [...] 5...|$|E

There is {{increasing}} use of commercial components in space technology {{and it is important}} to recognize that the space radiation environment poses the risk of permanent malfunction due to radiation. Therefore, the integrated circuits used for spacecraft electronics must be resistant to radiation. The effect of using the MOSFET device in a radiation environment is that the gate oxide becomes ionized by the dose it absorbs due to the radiation induced trapped charges in the gate-oxide. The trapped charges in the gate-oxide generate additional space charge fields at the oxide-substrate interface. After a sufficient dose, a large positive charge builds up, having the same effect as if a positive voltage was applied to the gate terminal. Therefore, the transistor source to drain current can no longer be controlled by the gate terminal and the device remains on permanently resulting in device failure. There are four processes involved in the radiation response of MOS devices. First, the ionizing radiation acts with the gate oxide layer to produce electron-hole pairs. Some fraction of the electron-hole pairs recombine depending on the type of incident particle and the applied gate to substrate voltage, i. e. the electric field. The mobility of the electron is orders of magnitude larger than that of the holes in the gate oxide, and is swept away very quickly in the direction of the gate terminal. The time for the electrons to be swept away is on the order of 1 ps. The holes that escape recombination remain near their point of origin. The number of these surviving holes determines the initial response of the device after a short pulse of radiation. The cause of the first process, i. e. the presence of the electric field, is the main motivation for design method described in this dissertation. The second process is the slow transport of holes toward the oxide-silicon interface due to the presence of the electric field. When the holes reach the interface, process 3, they become captured in long term trapping sites and this is the main cause of the permanent threshold voltage shift in MOS devices. The fourth process is the buildup of interface states in the substrate near the interface The main contribution of this dissertation is the development of the novel Switched Modular Redundancy (SMR) method for mitigating the effects of space radiation on satellite electronics. The overall idea of the SMR method is as follows: A charged particle is accelerated in the presence of an electric field. However, in a solid, electrons will move around randomly in the absence of an applied electric field. Therefore if one averages the movement over time there will be no overall motion of charge carriers in any particular direction. On applying an electric field charge carriers will on average move in a direction aligned with the electric field, with positive charge carriers such as holes moving in the direction of field, and negative charge carriers moving in the opposite direction. As is the case with process one and two above. It is proposed in this dissertation that if we apply the flatband voltage (normaly a zero bias for the ideal NMOS transistor) to the gate terminal of a MOS transistor in the presence of ionizing radiation, i. e. no electric field across the gate oxide, both the free electrons and holes will on average remain near their point of origin, and therefore have a greater probability of recombination. Thus, the threshold voltage shift in MOS devices will be less severe for the gate terminal in an unbiased condition. The flatband conditions for the real MOS transistor is discussed in appendix E. It was further proposed that by adding redundancy and applying a resting policy, one can significantly prolong the useful life of MOS components in space. The fact that the rate of the threshold voltage shift in MOS devices is dependant on the bias voltage applied to the gate terminal is a very important phenomenon that can be exploited, since we have direct control and access to the voltage applied to the gate terminal. If for example, two identical gates were under the influence of radiation and the gate voltage is alternated between the two, then the two gates should be able to withstand more total dose radiation than using only one gate. This redundancy could be used in a circuit to mitigate for total ionizing dose. The SMR methodology would be to duplicate each gate in a circuit, then selectively only activating one gate at a time allowing the other to anneal during its off cycle. The SMR algorithm was code in the “C” language. In the proposed design methodology, the design engineer need not be concerned about radiation effects when describing the hardware implementation in a hardware description language. Instead, the design engineer makes use of conventional design techniques. When the design is complete, it is synthesized to obtain the gate level netlist in edif format. The edif netlist is converted to structural VHDL code during synthesis. The structural VHDL netlist is fed into the SMR “C” algorithm to obtain the identical redundant circuit components. The resultant file is also a structural VHDL netlist. The generated VHDL netlist or SMR circuit can then be mapped to a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA). Spacecraft electronic designers increasingly demand high performance microprocessors and FPGAs, because of their high performance and flexibility. Because FPGAs are reprogrammable, they offer the additional benefits of allowing on-orbit design changes. Data can be sent after launch to correct errors or to improve system performance. System including FPGAs covers a wide range of space applications, and consequently, they are the object of this study in order to implement and test the SMR algorithm. We apply the principles of reconfigurable computing to implement the Switched Modular Redundancy Algorithm in order to mitigate for Total Ionizing Dose (TID) effects in FPGA’s. It is shown by means of experimentation that this new design technique provides greatly improved TID tolerance for FPGAs. This study was necessary in order to make the cost of satellite manufacturing as low as possible by making use of Commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) components. However, these COTS components are very susceptible to the hazards of the space environment. One could also make use of Radiation Hard components for the purpose of satellite manufacturing, however, this will defeat the purpose of making the satellite manufacturing cost as low as possible as the cost of the radiation hard electronic components are significantly higher than their commercial counterparts. Added to this is the undesirable fact that the radiation hard components are a few generations behind as far as speed and performance is concerned, thus providing even greater motivation for making use of Commercial components. Radiation hardened components are obtained by making use of special processing methods in order to improve the components radiation tolerance. Modifying the process steps is one of the three ways to improve the radiation tolerance of an integrated circuit. The two other possibilities are to use special layout techniques or special circuit and system architectures. Another method, in which to make <b>Complementary</b> <b>Metal</b> <b>Oxide</b> <b>Silicon</b> (CMOS) circuits tolerant to ionizing radiation is to distribute the workload among redundant modules (called Switched Modular Redundancy above) in the circuit.
