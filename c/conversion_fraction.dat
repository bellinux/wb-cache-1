Specifically, we focus on FPP propagation that yields conversion profiles that are not invariant with time, and which cannot be simply described {{by the presence of}} mass or heat diffusion. The models are assessed against experimental data for the photopolymerization of a model trimethacrylate system. We find that the simplest model, comprising a single equation of motion for the <b>conversion</b> <b>fraction</b> ϕ and a generalized Beer–Lambert law, can only describe the experimental data by assuming an unphysical variation in optical absorption. Introducing a ϕ-dependent reaction constant Keff is found to require a time dependence, regardless of the functional form in ϕ.

Previous research suggests that multiple graphical representations (MGRs) may promote learning of fractions. Specifically, we hypothesized that providing students with MGRs of fractions, {{in addition to the}} conventional symbolic notation, leads to better learning outcomes as compared to instruction incorporating only one graphical representation. We anticipated, however, that MGRs would make the students’ task more challenging, since they must link the representations and distill from them a common concept or principle. Therefore, we hypothesized further that selfexplanation prompts would help students benefit from working with MGRs. To investigate these hypotheses, we conducted a classroom study in which 112 6 th-grade students used intelligent tutors for <b>fraction</b> <b>conversion</b> and <b>fraction</b> addition.

The {{model is a}} general nonlinear least squares method taking the error in both monomer <b>conversion</b> and monomer <b>fraction</b> into account by a relation between these two variables. Simulations show that the model is able to predict reactivity ratios successfully. Special attention is given to experimental design, i. e., at which initial monomer feed ratios the experiments should be performed {{in order to obtain}} reliable values for the reactivity ratios...|$|R
40|$|Continued Fractions (CFs) {{efficiently}} compute digit serial {{rational function}} approximations. Traditionally, CFs {{are used to}} compute homographic functions such ¢¤£¦¥¨§�©�� as, given continued fractions x, y, and integers ������������ �. Re-cent improvements {{in the implementation of}} CF algorithms open up their use to many digital filtering applications in both software and hardware. These improvements of CF algorithms include error control, more efficient number representation and the associated efficient <b>conversions.</b> Continued <b>fractions</b> have been applied to digital filters in the frequency domain. These techniques include methods to compute optimal coefficients for rational transfer functions of digital filters and the realization of ladder forms for digital filtering. We propose a time domain digital filtering technique that incorporates continued fraction arithmetic units. For the FIR filter example chosen, the proposed technique achieves a 45 - 50 % reduction of the mean square error of the transfer function...|$|R
