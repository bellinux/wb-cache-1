5000|$|Preferred stock can be {{cumulative}} or noncumulative. A <b>cumulative</b> <b>preferred</b> {{requires that}} if a company fails to pay a dividend (or pays less than the stated rate), it must {{make up for it}} at a later time. Dividends accumulate with each passed dividend period (which may be quarterly, semi-annually or annually). When a dividend is not paid in time, it has [...] "passed"; all passed dividends on a cumulative stock make up a dividend in arrears. A stock without this feature is known as a noncumulative, or straight, <b>preferred</b> stock; any <b>dividends</b> passed are lost if not declared.|$|R

40|$|A {{growing body}} of {{literature}} investigates the interaction of changes in accounting standards with institutions such as investor protection laws and corporate governance mechanisms. We examine the unintended consequences of fair value accounting in determining mandated <b>preferred</b> <b>dividends.</b> We study the case of Russian energy conglomerate UES, which had a good corporate governance track record and a consistent dividend history. Following its adoption of fair value accounting, UES reported the highest quarterly profit in world corporate history, but it subsequently omitted dividends for all its shareholders. The case analysis suggests that the transitory nature of fair value adjustments and the interaction with the investment policy were important considerations in justifying the dividend omission. The reduction in <b>preferred</b> <b>dividends</b> was not offset by any capital gains, {{and led to a}} wealth transfer from preferred to ordinary shareholders. Thus, requiring the use of fair value accounting when determining the dividend distribution base can lead to unintended consequences and increase agency costs for minority shareholders...|$|R

50|$|Like common stock, {{preferred}} stocks represent partial ownership in a company. Preferred stock shareholders {{may or may}} not enjoy any of the voting rights of those holding common stock. Also, unlike common stock, a preferred stock pays a fixed dividend that does not fluctuate. Often the dividend is cumulative. Thus, the company must pay all unpaid <b>preferred</b> <b>dividends</b> accumulated during previous periods before it can pay dividends to common shareholders. If the company is unable to pay this <b>dividend,</b> the <b>preferred</b> shareholders may have the right to force a liquidation of the company.|$|R

40|$|The {{idiosyncratic}} {{preferences of}} controlling shareholders {{play an important}} role in determining the payout policy of a company. Among controlling shareholders, families are quite common in Continental Western Europe (Faccio et al., 2001, Caprio et al., 2011). We know that family managers often take decisions in the interests of the family rather than in the interests of the company (Bertrand and Schoar, 2006; Morck and Young, 2004). Payout policy of family firms could be implemented in order to satisfy idiosyncratic preferences of the family owner rather than maximizing the value of the company. Using a sample of 777 Western European Companies, I observed the payout policy in the 1997 – 2010 year period. I find that family firms significantly <b>prefer</b> <b>dividends</b> to buyback. Considering family managers, I find that CEO founders do not like to payout dividends, while CEO heirs do <b>prefer</b> <b>dividends.</b> Family firms controlled and managed by founders are more likely to use buyback and show a lower amount of dividend payout. On the other side, heir CEOs disgorge much more cash though dividends. Jensen‟s FCF theory (1989) seems to hold for family firms managed by founders, because they over retain cash rather than distributing it. Warther‟s (1993) “sleeping dogs ” theory could be a good explanation for heir CEOs ‟ propensity to distribute cash dividends. In fact, they need to satisfy a larger controlling group and also they need to make the other heirs happy enough to avoid interfering into management decisions...|$|R
