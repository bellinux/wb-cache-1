40|$|According to the {{knowledge}} based view of organisation, knowledge is an important productive resource that provides organisations competitive advantages. It is also argued that no single organisation has the full-range of expertise to survive. New knowledge is acquired not only from internal knowledge resources but also from sources outside the organisation&# 146;s boundaries. Thus, inter-organisational knowledge sharing is important for organisations to gain new knowledge. Many organisational relationships have been created to transfer knowledge. The customer-supplier relationship {{as part of the}} supply chain is a special type of inter-organisational relationship that is highly knowledge-intensive. Many of the critical failures in supply chain management are the consequence of poor knowledge sharing activities with organisation partners. One of the barriers to knowledge sharing is the lack of intention to share knowledge. The lack of intention to share knowledge {{as a starting point for}} knowledge sharing is even more important in <b>customer</b> <b>supplier</b> <b>relationship</b> because knowledge sharing is not normally viewed as one of the main targets by supply chain partners and therefore may not receive appropriate attention. Unlike knowledge transfer activities in other types of inter-organisational alliances, knowledge transfer between supply chain partners is generally not targeted and is less guaranteed. Thus, intention to share knowledge with its supply chain partners is of particular interest for an organisation. The focus of this study is to investigate the intention to share knowledge in customer-supplier relationships. The study aims to identify factors influencing this intention to share knowledge between supply chain partners by focusing on a simple two-level supply chain. In order to achieve this aim, a research model is developed based on the relevant theories of knowledge sharing in existing literature and then tested and extended through multiple case studies. The resulting integrated conceptual model about the intention to share knowledge in supply-chain relationships makes an important contribution to the literature as well as to knowledge sharing in practice...|$|E
40|$|Historically, {{the federal}} {{government}} has been the predominant purchaser of space launches in the United States. The government met its needs through purchase of hardware and services. It also provided the infrastructure necessary to conduct launch operations through federal launch ranges, both military and NASA. Under this model, the government had the complete ownership, responsibility, liability, and expense for launch activities. As the commercial space sector grew, there emerged a corresponding growth in demand for launch range services. However, the expense and complexity of activities has thus far deterred a rapid rise in the establishment of purely commercial launch sites. In this context, purely commercial is defined as "without benefit of capabilities provided by {{the federal government}}. " Consistent with the Commercial Space Launch Act, in recent years NASA and the Air Force have supported commercial launches from government launch ranges on a cost-reimbursable, non-interference basis. In this mode the commercial launch service providers contract with the government to provide services including use of facilities, tracking and data services, and range safety. As the commercial market projections began to show significant opportunities for economic development, several states established spaceports to provide the services necessary to meet these projected commercial needs. In 1997, NASA agreed to the establishment of the Virginia Space Flight Center (VSFC) at the Wallops Flight Facility. Under this arrangement, NASA agreed to allow Virginia Commercial Space Flight Authority (VCSFA) to construct facilities on NASA property and agreed to provide services in accordance with the Space Act of 1958 and the Commercial Space Launch Act of 1984 (as amended) to support VSFC launch customers. The relationship between NASA and VCSFA, however, has evolved beyond a <b>customer</b> <b>supplier</b> <b>relationship.</b> A partnership relationship has emerged which pairs the strengths of the established NASA test range and the state-sponsored, commercial launch facility provider, in an attempt to satisfy the needs for flexible, low-cost access to space. Furthermore, the future of the NASA/Wallops Test Range is closely linked with the success of VCSFA in promoting commercial launches from Wallops. This paper will describe the changing paradigm of the federal launch range and the unique aspects of the NASA/Wallops Facility relationship with VCSFA. Discussion will include institutional cost-sharing, business development and marketing, joint educational programs, and strategic planning...|$|E
40|$|M. Comm. The {{potential}} {{information available}} to managers through the management information system is considerably greater than a decade ago. Managers can through web portals view exactly where a product is in the manufacturing process anywhere in the world. The significant difference lies in how the information is passed from the control engineering layer to the business information layer. Substantial leaps forward have been achieved in the transparency of the various networks. In a manufacturing plant, information, right down to a pulse from the simplest sensor, can now immediately be shown to a user on the internet a thousand kilometres away. Making information from the factory floor available in real-time into the management system in the correct format, is {{not as simple as}} might appear. Over the past decade plant automation systems and business information systems have become more integrated than ever before. The organization’s management must make the correct, informed choice of networks for each application. Management must be aware of the various automation networks and their limitations. Management must also take cognisance of the possible compatibility issues associated with choices of networks and the associated automation equipment. Management needs to consider from whom and how to source the plant control networks. Supply chain management techniques have lead the trend in many industries to move to fewer, more strategic suppliers. The possibility of a single source strategic supplier relationship is investigated. The first part of research aims to determine whether a single supplier is a technically-sound solution. A number of automation networks are researched, their usability, industry support and future potential evaluated. iii These included various fieldbus networks and the newer reputedly more universal industrial Ethernets. The literature suggested that the solutions proposed by some of the major suppliers should be comprehensive. The research concurred that the offerings of two major worldwide automation suppliers were sufficiently all-inclusive. The second part of the research investigated whether strategic partnering is sound business practice. The customer to supplier relationship is examined. The advantage to both parties of pursuing a closer relationship is explored. The literature reported benefit and an increase in closer supplier partnering in other industries. The research confirmed that there was indeed benefit in a closer <b>customer</b> <b>supplier</b> <b>relationship</b> in the automation industry. The results of the literature study and the research conducted conclude that a single-vendor plant control network is feasible. Moreover entering a strategic partnership with a single automation supplier is best business practice...|$|E

40|$|Last {{years have}} {{witnessed}} {{an invasion of}} industrial activities in low cost countries. In strategic supplier networks most of the system suppliers are local SMEs by nature and they cannot start operations in LCcountries on their own resources. System suppliers have traditionally carried out product development work for main contractors {{but they have not}} priced this work separately. The costs of this work have been covered through end product sales prices that have included an indirect cost margin. The product development work has been seen as a service to ensure and increase the final sales volume.

Theories that have been found have either been tested on non-perishable goods or on small case studies. In earlier stages of the research, a dynamic model of inter-organisational information management systems (IOIMS) and relationships was developed based on a netchain case study. This paper presents an evaluation of this model based on a survey of Australian food processors and a green life industry case study. Both studies found that the environment (power, dependency and market uncertainty) had a significant influence on (attitudinal) commitment to develop long-term customer/supplier relationships. In addition, the nature of the IOIMS was associated with perceived current outcomes (satisfaction with performance, perceived responsiveness and strength of relationship trust). However, commitment to develop long-term <b>customer</b> <b>supplier</b> <b>relationships</b> was not significantly associated with the IOIMS. Conclusions were more doubtful about the association between the business environment and the IOIMS and perceived current outcomes. Suggestions for future research are made...|$|R

40|$|Past {{research}} has found many drawbacks in the conventional approaches to managing projects. Among the criticisms is the traditional understanding of value generation primarily focused on product creation, while the industry struggles {{to meet the expectations}} of different groups of stakeholders about the benefits that these projects are supposed to generate. In the pursuit of projects as means to achieve agreed goals and the fulfilment of a purpose, alternative approaches have been suggested. Integrated Project Delivery (IPD) is structured to deliver greater value from projects by aligning stakeholder expectations through integrated governance. This allows the major players to develop a much higher level of common understanding of the project, its purpose, and work towards value generation collaboratively. A case study was carried out in an IPD project to understand how integrated governance affects value generation. The findings suggest that IPD enables an environment in which value can be co-created, as it shifts the <b>customer</b> versus <b>supplier</b> <b>relationship</b> into a <b>customer</b> plus <b>supplier</b> <b>relationship.</b> <b>Customer</b> expectations and <b>supplier</b> assumptions are challenged in a dynamic and collaborative environment. While this can represent great improvement in generating value from construction projects, the increased managerial challenges of such interactions should also be noted. To establish and maintain focus in such environments is more challenging and this paper suggests that more research should be carried out on the role of techniques and tools in supporting people to focus on what is important...|$|R

40|$|This Executive Summary is {{a summary}} of the author's Engineering Doctorate {{research}} and the application of that research. The Executive Summary has sufficient detail and description to be read independently from the other pieces of research, called submissions, to which this refers. In outline, the three areas of research arose from the three research programmes with which the author was closely involved. The first area of research involved the identification of critical success factors within customer-supplier relationships in the automotive industry. An extensive literature review was performed using Lamming's Lean Supply Model (1993) as a starting point. A number of gaps in the body of knowledge were identified and were grouped into five areas for the purpose of further research. One area was subsequently addressed as part of the second area of research. The second area of research was aimed at assisting small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) in their use of the internet to improve their performance. A means of assessing the effectiveness of the operations of the SMEs was a critical part of this programme. A new tool called the SME (Operations) Assessment Tool, (SOAT) was developed because it focused on key business processes as the basis for assessment instead of the more traditional financial analysis. Having developed SOAT within the specific research programme, it was applied to three SMEs as a test of the methodology as a more general tool. Feedback from the three SMEs and those within the research programme showed that SOAT was straightforward to apply. The third area of research allowed the author to develop his interest in <b>customer</b> <b>supplier</b> <b>relationships,</b> as this was seen to be the main focus of concern within companies within the programme. A Memorandum of Understanding and Intent (MUI) was developed and justified, but {{was in the process of}} being applied by other researchers...|$|R
