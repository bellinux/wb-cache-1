It is square in plan with chamfered corners that, built of stone, each side is an open arch, Herma protrude from each <b>chamfered</b> <b>corner.</b> It is surmounted by an octagonal lead dome.|$|E
25|$|It is a single, compact volume which wraps {{itself around}} the corner in a {{dramatic}} curve that corresponds to the <b>chamfered</b> <b>corner</b> required since the late 19th century by city ordinances. The main two levels have nearly twenty-feet-high ceilings, thus giving the structure sufficient bulk so as to stand out within its context. Verticality is accented {{by the use of}} colossal Corinthian pilasters, square and paired at the facades to each street and round and single at the corner.|$|E
25|$|The {{mausoleum}} is cubic with chamfered edges. On {{the long}} sides, a massive pishtaq, or vaulted archway frames an arch-shaped doorway, {{with a similar}} arch-shaped balcony above. These main arches extend above the roof the building by use of an integrated facade. To {{either side of the}} main arch, additional pishtaqs are stacked above and below. This motif of stacked pishtaqs is replicated on the <b>chamfered</b> <b>corner</b> areas. The design is completely uniform and consistent on all sides of the building.|$|E

25|$|The Casino de Ponce is a two-story, {{concrete}} structure on {{the southeast corner}} of Marina and Luna streets in the historic urban center of Ponce. The area of the lot on which it sits measures approximately 38 X 36 meters. It has a <b>chamfered</b> <b>corner</b> at the intersection of the two streets. The architectural style is Rococo-like, including its main relief and mansard roof. Most of the building as it exists today is part of the original structure, the exception being a few of the ground level doors.|$|E
500|$|Historically, the U-Drop Inn {{held two}} {{separate}} businesses that shared a single interior wall. The west side, commonly called [...] "Tower Station" [...] "is {{dominated by a}} large four-sided obelisk rising from the flat roof and topped by a metal [...] "tulip"." [...] The tower displayed the station name, Conoco, in all capital letters on each side, with neon lighting on the corners. Vertical-rubbed detailing goes along the base of both towers, {{as well as two}} canopies that extend south and west from the western tower. The posts of the canopies were originally encased in decorative glazed tile and vintage metal signs. Between the canopy posts are fuel islands designed to hold three fuel pumps each. 1960s-vintage pumps are situated on the islands, with three on the western canopy and two on the southern. A <b>chamfered</b> <b>corner</b> separates the two canopies. Multiple-pane windows surround the glass doors of the office station, as well as dominating much of the southern side of the building. Situated between the office and the café are two service station bays with roll-up style overhead doors.|$|E

It has five doors, including three interior doors plus two exterior doors including the chamfered door.|$|E
50|$|The {{original}} grand {{entrance to}} the building is accentuated by the <b>chamfered</b> <b>corner</b> of the building’s southwest façade. The effect of the <b>chamfered</b> <b>corner</b> is enhanced by careful placement of three window bays. The three rows of windows outline the <b>chamfered</b> <b>corner</b> with one bay in the center nestled between two remaining window bays. Two grand Ionic order pilasters made of red brick and topped with terra cotta capitals with decorative volutes separate and enrich the corner window bays.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} a {{substrate}} integrated waveguide (SIW) circularly polarized rectangular ring-slot antenna with <b>chamfered</b> <b>corners</b> designed for 5. 8 GHz ISM frequency band for off-body communication. The antenna consists of a substrate integrated waveguide, which operates in the fundamental mode TE 10, and the rectangular ring-slot radiator with <b>chamfered</b> <b>corners</b> etched in the top wall of the SIW. It radiates a right-handed circularly polarized (RHCP) wave in the boresight direction. Experimental results prove that the proposed antenna located in free space achieves the impedance bandwidth of 2. 41 % (for the reflection coefficient less than - 10 dB) and the RHCP gain of 6. 57 dBi, and the impedance bandwidth of 2. 6 % and the RHCP gain of 6. 98 dBi for its location on the phantom. The axial ratio (AR) bandwidth (for the AR less than 3 dB) is 0. 9 % for both configurations...|$|R
