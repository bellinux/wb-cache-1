5|$|Fighting {{has been}} a part of ice hockey since the sport's rise in {{popularity}} in 19th century Canada. There are a number of theories behind the integration of fighting into the game; the most <b>common</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the relative lack of rules in the early history of hockey encouraged physical intimidation and control. Other theories include the poverty and high crime rates of local Canada in the 19th century. The implementation of some features, such as the blue lines in 1918, actually encouraged fighting due to the increased level of physical play. Creation of the blue lines allowed forward passing, but only in the neutral zone. Therefore, puck handlers played at close quarters and were subject to a great deal of physical play. The emergence of enforcers, who protected the puck handlers and fought when necessary, followed shortly thereafter.|$|E

Once this is achieved, the power is permanently present in the coin, which effectively becomes an amulet.|$|E
25|$|Many machine models {{different}} from the standard multi-tape Turing machines have been proposed in the literature, for example random access machines. Perhaps surprisingly, each of these models {{can be converted to}} another without providing any extra computational power. The time and memory consumption of these alternate models may vary. What all these models have in <b>common</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the machines operate deterministically.|$|E

25|$|What tribunals {{all have}} in <b>common</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> they {{are created by}} statute, their adjudicators are usually {{appointed}} by government, and they focus on very particular and specialized areas of law. Because some subject matters (e.g., immigration) fall within federal jurisdiction while others (e.g., liquor licensing and workers' compensation) in provincial jurisdiction, some tribunals are created by federal law while others are created by provincial law. There are both federal and provincial tribunals for some subject matters such as unionized labour and human rights.|$|E
25|$|The Khatik {{are widely}} {{distributed}} community in North India, and each Khatik group, {{has its own}} origin myth. What they have in <b>common</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> they were historically kshtriyas who were assigned to kill animals in yagas performed by kings.Also today,only khatiks has right to kill animals during bali offerings at Hindu temples. According to their traditions, the god Brahma assigned to them a goats skin, the bark of trees and lac- so they could graze cattle, dye skins of goat, and deer; and tan hides with bark and lac. Another tradition, claims that {{the origin of the}} word Khatik has been derived from the Hindi word khat, which, means an immediate killing. They relate this to early days when they used to supply mutton to the kings of Rajasthan. While other sources claim that the word khatik is said to have originated from the Sanskrit word kathika, which means to butcher or hunter.|$|E
500|$|The rhyme {{is often}} used in a children's singing game, which exists {{in a wide variety}} of forms, with {{additional}} verses. Most versions are similar to the actions used in the rhyme [...] "Oranges and Lemons". The most <b>common</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> two players hold hands and make an arch with their arms while the others pass through in single file. The [...] "arch" [...] is then lowered at the song's end to [...] "catch" [...] a player. In the United States it is common for two teams of those that have been caught to engage in a tug of war. In England until the nineteenth century the song may have been accompanied by a circle dance, but arch games are known to have been common across late medieval Europe.|$|E
5000|$|The {{absence of}} hard {{evidence}} {{of what happened to}} the Princes has led to a number of theories being put forward. The most <b>common</b> theory <b>is</b> <b>that</b> they <b>were</b> murdered close to the time that they disappeared, and among historians and authors who accept the murder theory, the most <b>common</b> explanation <b>is</b> <b>that</b> they <b>were</b> murdered by Richard.|$|R

500|$|The {{caricature}} {{of the period}} is also reflected in some more specific notions. One misconception, first propagated in the 19th century and still very <b>common,</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> all people in the Middle Ages believed that the Earth was flat. This is untrue, as lecturers in the medieval universities commonly argued that evidence showed the Earth was a sphere. Lindberg and Ronald Numbers, another scholar of the period, state that there [...] "was scarcely a Christian scholar of the Middle Ages who did not acknowledge [...] sphericity and even know its approximate circumference". Other misconceptions such as [...] "the Church prohibited autopsies and dissections during the Middle Ages", [...] "the rise of Christianity killed off ancient science", or [...] "the medieval Christian Church suppressed the growth of natural philosophy", are all cited by Numbers as examples of widely popular myths that still pass as historical truth, although they are not supported by current historical research.|$|E
500|$|Liz and Carol {{discover}} {{that one of}} the things they have in <b>common</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> they both love to watch The Muppets presenting award shows. Later, Liz reveals that she has a Life Alert Emergency Response necklace; this necklace helps the elderly contact emergency services in case of an accident. Carol wonders why Geico—an auto insurance company—has multiple mascots, a reference to Geico's advertising campaigns. Jack plans to seduce the gay interior designer that Avery hired and hopes to get the designer to agree with him to leave the apartment the way it is, explaining to Liz [...] "Do you know what a prize I am in the gay community? There's a term for it. I'm a bear. And I'm a daddy. I'm a daddy bear." [...] Before parting ways, Liz says to Carol [...] "See you October 14", a reference to the live episode of 30 Rock entitled [...] "Live Show" [...] that aired on October 14, 2010.|$|E
500|$|A further {{reason for}} the absence of Baroque decoration, and the most <b>common,</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> most rooms were never {{intended}} for such decoration. Many of the palazzi were vast, meant for huge numbers of people. The household of the Sicilian aristocrat, beginning with himself, his wife and many children, would typically also contain a collection of poorer relatives and other extended family members, all of whom had minor apartments in the house. Moreover, there were paid employees, often including a private chaplain or confessor, a major domo, governesses, secretary, archivist, accountant, librarian, and innumerable lower servants, such as a porter to ring a bell a prescribed number of times according to the rank of an approaching guest. Often the servants' extended families, especially if elderly, also lived in the palazzo. Thus many rooms were needed to house the household. These everyday living quarters, even for the [...] "Maestro and Maestra di Casa", were often simply decorated and furnished. Further rooms were required by the Sicilian tradition that it was a sign of poor breeding to permit even mere acquaintances to stay in local inns. Any visiting foreigner, especially an Englishman, was regarded as a special trophy and added social prestige. Hence the Sicilian aristocrat's home was seldom empty or quiet.|$|E

2500|$|... "What these {{structures}} have in <b>common</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> their development and morphogenesis {{depends on the}} signaling between specialized ectodermal cells and the underlying mesoderm. Epithelial-mesenchymal interactions between the apical ectodermal ridge (AER) and the underlying mesenchyme, denoted the progress zone, are required for normal morphogenesis of the limb.|$|E
2500|$|Another custom that {{is still}} <b>common</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> of placing a poor child with a well-off family as a {{domestic}} servant, a situation that often results in sexual and labor exploitation and in trafficking. This practice is called [...] "vidomègon." [...] Other problems include child prostitution, which often involves street children, and child labor. There {{are a number of}} street children, many of whom do not attend school or have access to medical care.|$|E
2500|$|The {{practice}} of irrigation {{has its share}} of criticism and environmental concerns. In many European wine regions the practice is banned under the belief that irrigation can be detrimental to quality wine production. However, in the early 21st century some European countries have relaxed their irrigation laws or reevaluated the issue. Of the criticisms leveled towards irrigation, the most <b>common</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> it disrupts the natural expression of terroir in the land as well as the unique characteristics that comes with vintage variation. In regions that do not practice irrigation, the quality and styles of wines can be dramatically different from vintage to vintage depending on weather conditions and rainfall. Irrigation's contribution to the broader globalization of wine is criticized as promoting a homogenization or [...] "standardization" [...] of wine.|$|E

50|$|The Anglo-Saxon {{system of}} {{maintaining}} public order {{was a private}} system of tithings, since the Norman conquest led by a constable, {{which was based on}} a social obligation for the good conduct of the others; more <b>common</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> local lords and nobles were responsible to maintain order in their lands, and often appointed a constable, sometimes unpaid, to enforce the law.|$|R

2500|$|Towards {{the end of}} 1797, Coleridge {{was fascinated}} {{with the idea of}} a river and it was used in {{multiple}} poems including [...] "Kubla Khan" [...] and [...] "The Brook". In his Biographia Literaria (1817), he explained, [...] "I sought for a subject, that should give equal room and freedom for description, incident, and impassioned reflections on men, nature, and society, yet supply in itself a natural connection to the parts and unity to the whole. Such a subject I conceived myself to have found in a stream, traced from its source in the hills among the yellow-red moss and conical glass-shaped tufts of bent, to the first break or fall, where its drops become audible, and it begins to form a channel". It is possible that the imagery of Biographia Literaria followed the recovery of the [...] "Kubla Khan" [...] manuscript during the composition of the book. Water imagery permeated through many of his poems, and the coast that he witnessed on his journey to Linton appears in Osorio. Additionally, many of the images are connected to a broad use of Ash Farm and the Quantocks in Coleridge's poetry, and the mystical settings of both Osorio and [...] "Kubla Khan" [...] are based on his idealised version of the region. [...] "Kubla Khan" [...] was composed in the same year as This Lime-Tree Bower My Prison, and both poems contained images that were used in the 14 October 1797 letter to Thelwall. However, the styles are very different as one is heavily structured and rhymed while the other tries to mimic conversational speech. What they do have in <b>common</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> they use scenery based on the same location, including repeated uses of dells, rocks, ferns, and a waterfall found in the Somerset region. The Preface uses water imagery to explain what happens when visions are lost by quoting a passage from his poem The Picture. When considering all of The Picture and not just the excerpt, Coleridge describes how inspiration is similar to a stream and that if an object is thrown into it the vision is interrupted.|$|E

6000|$|Coal, as {{of course}} you know, is {{commonly}} said to be composed of vegetable matter, of the leaves and stems of ancient plants and trees--a startling statement, and one which I do not wish you to take entirely on trust. I shall therefore spend a few pages in showing you how this fact--for fact it is--was discovered. It {{is a very good}} example of reasoning from the known to the unknown. You will have a right to say at first starting, [...] "Coal is utterly different in look from leaves and stems. The only property which they seem to have in <b>common</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> they can both burn." [...] True. But difference of mere look may be only owing to a transformation, or series of transformations. There are plenty in nature quite as great, and greater. What can be more different in look, for instance, than a green field of wheat and a basket of loaves at the baker's? And yet there is, I trust, no doubt whatsoever that the bread has been once green wheat, and that the green wheat has been transformed into bread--making due allowance, of course, for the bone-dust, or gypsum, or alum with which the worthy baker may have found it profitable to adulterate his bread, in order to improve the digestion of Her Majesty's subjects.|$|E
