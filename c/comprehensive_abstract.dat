The first step involves a separate numerical classification of each subset (region), and subsequent refinement by Braun- Blanquet procedures. The resulting plant communities are summarised in a single synoptic table, by calculating a synoptic value for each species in each community. In the second step all communities in the synoptic table are classified by numerical analysis, to bring related communities from different regions or studies together in a single cluster. After refinement of these clusters by Braun-Blanquet procedures, broad vegetation types are identified.

Although it is inspired by Feynman's original heuristic suggestions and time-ordering rules in his seminal 1951 paper An operator calculus having applications in quantum electrodynamics, as will be made abundantly clear in the introduction (Chapter 1) {{and elsewhere in the}} text, the theory developed in this book also goes well beyond them in a number of directions which were not anticipated in Feynman's work.

The basic properties of the operational calculus are developed and certain algebraic and analytic properties of the operational calculus are explored. Also, the operational calculus will be seen to possess some pleasant stability properties. Furthermore, an evolution equation and a generalized integral equation obeyed by the operational calculus are discussed and connections with certain analytic Feynman integrals are noted.

40|$|Background: One of the {{objectives}} of the International Society for Physical and Rehabilitation Medicine is to improve the continuity of World Congresses. This requires the development of an abstract topic list for use in congress announcements and abstract submissions. Methods: An abstract topic list was developed {{on the basis of the}} definitions of human functioning and rehabilitation research, which define 5 main areas of research (biosciences in rehabilitation, biomedical rehabilitation sciences and engineering, clinical Physical and Rehabilitation Medicine (PRM) sciences, integrative rehabilitation sciences, and human functioning sciences). For the abstract topic list, these research areas were grouped according to the proposals of congress streams. In a second step, the first version of the list was systematically compared with the topics of the 2003 ISPRM World Congress. Results: The resulting <b>comprehensive</b> <b>abstract</b> topic list contains 5 chapters according to the definition of human functioning and rehabilitation research. Due to the high significance of clinical research, clinical PRM sciences were placed at the top of the list, comprising all relevant health conditions treated in PRM services.

40|$|Participatory {{architecture}} {{appeared in}} the late 60 s as a criticism of modernist architecture and urban planning. It was a criticism that {{did not come from}} inside the profession (as most other currents and paradigm shifts did) but from the outside, from other disciplines, such as philosophy, art, and sociology. Based on the writings of Michel Foucault, the neo-Marxian Henri Lefebvre and Guy Debord, it challenged the dominant role of the architect as an expert planner and sole individual capable of designing built space. It was a criticism of the power the architect had regarding space, and how the individual user was dominated in this relation. Participation in architecture started therefore as a profoundly ideological practice and, even today, it is still seen as a radical leftist approach to architecture and urban planning. In contrast to the 60 s and 70 s when participatory architecture was manifestly Neo-Marxian, nowadays these processes are not always so clearly marked ideologically. This article tries to find the different effects of manifest and implicit ideologies in participatory architecture today. Our premise is the fact that participation is first and foremost a collaborative practice between individuals – agents. Like any other form of cooperation, participation must be based on trust but the main motor of cooperation is recognizing the needs and interests of the individuals who are rarely linked to abstract ideals. Manifest ideology, as a set of coherent and <b>comprehensive</b> <b>abstract</b> ideas about political and social action, will create relationships between like-minded individuals, while increasing the social distance from others. Considering that most individuals do not adhere to a specific ideology, manifest ideology in participatory architecture will therefore be an obstacle in creating trust relations. But ideology was and will always {{be a part of this}} type of architectural process. So the question is: how can architects or other initiators of participatory architecture reduce the social distance created by ideology...|$|E
40|$|This {{internship}} {{report is}} submitted in a partial {{fulfillment of the}} requirements for the degree of Bachelor of Business Administration, 2012. Cataloged from PDF version of Internship report. Includes bibliographical references (page 59). Unilever Bangladesh Ltd. (UBL) is the Bangladeshi arm of Anglo-Dutch consumer goods manufacturer Unilever which is {{regarded as one of}} the world‟s most successful fast moving consumer goods manufacturing companies with access to global resources as well as local manufacturing facilities, economies of scale and above all synergy of resources and operations across the world. Unilever Bangladesh Limited, the leading company in the Bangladeshi consumer market has five departments to carry out all its organizational functions. Having owned some dominant brands in Home and Personal care product portfolio, the company now wants to evaluate its potential in the beauty salon business in Bangladesh with its fast growing hair care brands like Sunsilk, Clear and Dove. I was appointed in Brand Development Departments specially hair care department headed by the Senior Brand Manager as an intern to “Assess the feasibility of Unilever‟s market potential in Beauty salon business” on which my internship report is based. This research report is however designed to explore and assess the impact of consumer‟s hair care experiences provided through services in the beauty salon in Dhaka metropolitan city and Chittagong. The study was conducted through use of a survey questionnaire followed by personal interviews of 24 ladies parlors, 4 men‟s salon and 43 individual customers respectively in the corresponding cities. It was carried out as the basis for understanding a <b>comprehensive</b> <b>abstract</b> of consumer stance towards the hair care product that are being used in the beauty salon to provide the hair care services. A substantial amount of data which includes both qualitative and quantitative issues resulted by the survey were then analyzed to learn more about the impact of these experiences, parlor‟s inside activities, hair care services and brand preference of both parlors and customers. Although both women and men were engaged in conducting the survey, however women appeared to be more concerned about voluminous hair and prevention of split ends than men. Based on several important factors, this systematic study yielded rich quantitative data (presented through figures, graphs,) and qualitative data (comments and opinions) which led to ascertain the market potential for UBL in the beauty salon industry in Bangladesh. The statistics and comments obtained, provided substantial evidence that now a days almost everyone both male and female who are concerned about hair, consider hair treatment in beauty salons. Specific attributes of hair care problems like nourishment of hair, hair loss, dandruffs were cited as extremely important to the success of a quality hair care product with the suggestion that there may be a potential market for an herbal hair care product. The author gained dramatic insights about the significance of brand and quality and how it influences the consumers‟ attitude in choosing a hair care product like shampoo. Though customers personally prefer Dove, Pantene is however regarded as the most preferred brand followed by Sunsilk by the majority of the beauty salons. This report provided valuable insights gained from the survey and suggestions to overcome some of the problems faced by parlors and salons regarding hair care products and thus analyzed the gaps and opportunities in the beauty salon market in Bangladesh to implement an effective plan to strengthen the use of UBL‟s hair care product in the beauty salons. The approach will not only utilize the favorable market condition that Unilever already holds but will also secure a strong market position for long term and thus will set the ball rolling towards the corporate and strategic goals of UBL for the forthcoming years.

Rather {{it is meant to}} provide something of the flavour of the varied approaches to security developed beyond the pale of its dedicated discipline. Accordingly, there is certainly much more of relevance to be found in each of the disciplines surveyed, to say nothing of those which are not explored herein. Drawn solely from explicit references to “security” in the subject indices of a number of disciplinary abstracts spanning the period 1985 - 1998, this compilation has been confined to articles published in English-language scholarly journals. Some will be familiar to scholars working in Security Studies; many will not. Though we do not wish to impute disciplinary affiliations to particular authors (to say nothing of journals) and are equally reluctant to reify often-arbitrary disciplinary boundaries, the bibliography is organized under the disciplinary headings of Anthropology, Development Studies, Human Geography, Sociology, Urban Studies, and Women’s Studies. These affiliations are based on the enumeration of individual works in the <b>comprehensive</b> <b>abstracts</b> of these disciplines, and are in no way intended to suggest their exclusivity to any particular academic realm.
