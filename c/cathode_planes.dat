Vibration of a chamber module implies motion of the internal anode wires with respect to the <b>cathode</b> <b>planes,</b> thereby affecting wire gain and generating low frequency electrical noise. In this note, the effects of vibrations on CSC operation are estimated leading to a specification of a maximum amplitude for vibrations of a module.

50|$|On {{the side}} {{opposite}} of the <b>cathode</b> <b>plane</b> {{is a set of}} anode wire planes set at potentials much higher (less negative) than that of the <b>cathode.</b> Each <b>plane</b> is separated from its neighbors by a small gap, usually on the order of 1 cm. A plane consists of many parallel conducting wires spaced by a few millimeters, and the angle at which the wires are oriented relative to the vertical varies from plane to plane. Together, these planes read out signals from the drift electrons. For a detector with N anode wire planes, the inner N − 1 planes are called induction planes. These are set at lower (more negative) potentials than the outer plane, allowing drift electrons to pass through them, inducing signals that are used for event reconstruction. The outer plane is called the collection plane because the drift electrons are collected on these wires, producing additional signals. Having multiple planes with different wire orientations permits two-dimensional event reconstruction, while the third dimension is found from electron drift times.|$|R

These films, which exhibit spatio-temporal patterns on the surface, grow following a layer-by-layer mode.

A columnar structure was revealed inside each individual nanolayer which, in turn, was composed of well-distinguished In- and Co-rich regions.

The only consistent signs of aging were a small increase in dark current from 2 to 10 nA per plane of 600 wires and a decrease of strip-to-strip resistance from 1000 to 10 - 100 GOmega.

The BetaCage, a gaseous neon time-projection chamber, is a proposed ultra-sensitive (and nondestructive) screener for alpha- and beta-emitting surface contaminants to which existing screening facilities are insufficiently sensitive. Sensitivity goals are 0. 1 betas per keV-m^ 2 -day and 0. 1 alphas per m^ 2 -day, with the former limited by Compton scattering of photons in the screening samples and (thanks to tracking) the latter expected to be signal-limited; radioassays and simulations indicate backgrounds from detector materials and radon daughters should be subdominant.

A TGC consists of a plane of closely spaced wires maintained at positive high voltage, sandwiched between resistive grounded <b>cathode</b> <b>planes</b> with an anode wire to cathode plane gap distance smaller than the wire-to-wire spacing. The TGCs are expected to provide a trigger signal within 25 ns of the bunch spacing of the LHC accelerator, with an efficiency exceeding 95 %, while exposed to an effective photon and neutron background ranging from 30 to 500 Hz/cm 2. About 2, 500 out of the 3, 600 ATLAS TGCs are being produced at the Weizmann institute in Israel, and in Shandong University in China. Once installed in the ATLAS detector the TGCs will be inaccessible. A vigorous production quality control program is therefore implemented at the production sites.

50|$|Multiwire {{proportional}} counters or solid-state counters {{are often}} used as detection medium, because they provide signals with pulse heights proportional to the ionization strength. An avalanche effect {{in the vicinity of}} the anode wires strung in the readout chambers, gives the necessary signal amplification.

The readout is performed by the 557 568 pads that form the <b>cathode</b> <b>plane</b> of the multi-wire proportional chambers (MWPC) located at the end plates. This gives the radial distance to the beam and the azimuth. The last coordinate, z along the beam direction, is given by the drift time.

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{presents}} {{simulations of}} an atmospheric pressure air discharge in a point-to-plane geometry with a dielectric layer {{parallel to the}} <b>cathode</b> <b>plane.</b> Experimentally, a discharge reignition in the air gap below the dielectrics has been observed. With a 2 D fluid model, it is shown that due to the fast rise of the high voltage applied and the sharp point used, a first positive spherical discharge forms around the point. Then this discharge propagates axially and impacts the dielectrics. As the first discharge starts spreading on the upper dielectric surface, in the second air gap with a low preionization density of 10 ^ 4 ^- 3, the 2 D fluid model predicts a rapid reignition of a positive discharge. As in experiments, the discharge reignition is much slower, a discussion on physical processes {{to be considered in}} the model to increase the reignition delay is presented. The limit case with no initial seed charges in the second air gap has been studied. First, we have calculated the time to release an electron from the cathode surface by thermionic and field emission processes for a work function φ ∈ ≤ft[3, 4] eV and an amplification factor β ∈ ≤ft[100, 220]. Then a 3 D Monte Carlo model has been used to follow the dynamics of formation of an avalanche starting from a single electron emitted at the cathode. Due to the high electric field in the second air gap, we have shown that in a few nanoseconds, a Gaussian cloud of seed charges is formed at a small distance from the <b>cathode</b> <b>plane.</b> This Gaussian cloud has been used as the initial condition of the 2 D fluid model in the second air gap.

Large area sTGC's up to 2 m 2 in size and totaling an active area each of 1200 m 2 will be employed for fast and precise triggering. The required spatial resolution of about 100 μm will allow the Level- 1 trigger track segments to be reconstructed with an angular resolution of approximately 1 mrad. The precision <b>cathode</b> <b>plane</b> has strips with a 3. 2 mm pitch for precision readout and the <b>cathode</b> <b>plane</b> {{on the other side}} has pads to produce a 3 -out-of- 4 coincidence to identify passage of a track in an sTGC quadruplet, selecting which strips to read-out. The eight layers of MM detectors are arranged in multilayers of two quadruplets, for a total of about 1200 m 2 detection planes. All quadruplets have trapezoidal shapes with surface areas between 2 and 3 m 2. The readout elements consist of 300 μm wide strips with a pitch of ~ 450 μm for a total of 2. 1 M readout channels. A spatial resolution better than 100 um independent of the track incidence angle is required.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of experimental investigations into the current-voltage characteristics of a planar diode with an explosive emission cathode made from graphite. Studies were performed using a TEU- 500 pulsed electron accelerator (350 – 500 [*]keV, 100 [*]ns, 250 [*]J per pulse). Duration of diode operation, in a mode when electron current is limited by the emissive ability of the graphite cathode, is 15 – 20 [*]ns. The contribution of the cathode periphery to total electron current appears only as an increase in the emissive surface area due to an expansion of explosive plasma. Investigations of an ion diode with a graphite <b>cathode</b> (<b>plane</b> and focusing geometry) were also carried out. Experiments were performed using a TEMP- 4 M ion accelerator, which forms two nanosecond pulses: the first negative pulse (150 – 200 [*]kV, 300 – 600 [*]ns) followed by the second positive (250 – 300 [*]kV, 150 [*]ns). Total diode current in the first pulse is well described by the Child-Langmuir law for electron current at a constant rate of plasma expansion, equal to 1. 3 [*]cm/μs. It is shown that for an area of flat cathode over 25 [*]cm 2, the influence of edge contribution does not exceed measurement error of total diode electron current (10 %) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{results of}} {{numerical}} simulations of negative streamers in air at atmospheric pressure {{in a weak}} and uniform electric field are presented. Streamer development was considered between a protrusion on a <b>plane</b> <b>cathode</b> and a <b>plane</b> anode separated by a distance of 3. 3 cm. The region with an enhanced field near the protrusion tip, where streamer inception took place, was ~ 0. 3 cm long and the propagation region with a uniform background field covered ~ 3 cm of the gap length. The parameters of the streamers were studied for different magnitudes of the background field strength: 5, 6, 7 and 8 kV/cm at constant magnitude of the field strength {{at the tip of}} the protrusion aiming to determine minimal field required for stable propagation. Internal and integral characteristics of streamers developing in different background fields are discussed and analyzed. 1...|$|R
