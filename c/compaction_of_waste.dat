40|$|AbstractVolume {{reduction}} <b>of</b> radioactive solid <b>wastes</b> {{is carried}} out with an aim to minimize disposal space requirement. Cellulosic combustible solid wastes like cotton, paper etc. are treated by incineration and the plastic wastes are volume reduced by baling. <b>Compaction</b> <b>of</b> plastic <b>wastes</b> by baling gives low volume reduction factors (3 – 5) and also the resultant waste bale may spring back to original volume after disposal. With a view to achieve higher volume reduction factors, studies were conducted at CWMF on the melt-densification <b>of</b> plastic <b>wastes</b> at 180 - 190 C. The melted plastics were characterized by TGA/DTA & IR Spectroscopy and {{found that there was}} no structural loss of the polymer compounds. The melted mass was observed to have the expected theoretical density. A melt densification unit (MDU) was set up at CWMF with a facility for melting 20 kg <b>of</b> the plastic <b>waste</b> in each batch in a 200 L MS drum.

40|$|Two {{landfill}} {{test cells}} were constructed in a tropical climate using locally available low-cost materials. One cell was operated without a cover on the {{municipal solid waste}} to simulate 'open landfill' conditions and the other cell was covered to create 'closed landfill' conditions. Both test cells were monitored {{over a period of}} 290 days under rainy, dry and artificial wetting conditions. Due to the relatively high <b>compaction</b> density <b>of</b> <b>waste</b> in the closed test cell, the substrate settlement was gradual and comparatively lower than in the open test cell. Multiple top covers in the closed test cell resulted in significant run-off of incident precipitation during the rainy season, which delayed the waste stabilization and subsequently produced a lesser volume of leachate. On the other hand, operation of the open test cell was found to be advantageous in terms of leachate management and substrate settlement along with waste stabilization pattern. Infiltration of rain-water into the waste mass leached out the maximum organic pollutants and oxidized the nitrogen content, which is deemed to be a benefit of operating an open cell landfill under tropical conditions. Artificial wetting during dry periods by recirculation of stored leachate notably accelerated the waste stabilization and secondary substrate settlement in the open test cell.

40|$|We quantitatively {{studied the}} {{advantages}} <b>of</b> improving the <b>compaction</b> <b>of</b> a powder <b>waste</b> by several techniques, including its pelletization. The goal is increasing the mass storage capacity {{in a given}} storage volume, and reducing the permeability of air and moisture, that may trigger exothermic spontaneous reactions in organic waste, particularly as powders. The study is based on dried sludges from a wastewater treatment, mainly from tanneries, but the indications are valid and useful for any waste {{in the form of}} powder, suitable to pelletization. Measurements of bulk density have been carried out at the industrial and laboratory scale, using different packing procedures, amenable to industrial processes. Waste as powder, pellets and their mixtures have been considered. The bulk density <b>of</b> <b>waste</b> as powder increases from 0. 64 t/m 3 (simply poured) to 0. 74 t/m 3 (tapped) and finally to 0. 82 t/m 3 by a suitable, yet simple, packing procedure that we called dispersion filling, with a net gain of 28 % in the compaction by simply modifying the collection procedure. Pelletization increases compaction by definition, but the packing of pellets is relatively coarse. Some increase in bulk density of pellets can be achieved by tapping; vibration and dispersion filling are not efficient with pellets. Mixtures of powder and pellets is the optimal packing policy. The best compaction result was achieved by controlled vibration of a 30 / 70 wt% mixture of powders and pellets, leading to a final bulk density of 1 t/m 3, i. e. an improvement <b>of</b> <b>compaction</b> by more than 54 % with respect to simply poured powders, but also larger than 35 % compared to just pellets. That means increasing the mass storage capacity by a factor of 1. 56. Interestingly, vibration can be the most or the least effective procedure to improve <b>compaction</b> <b>of</b> mixtures, depending on characteristics of vibration.

In our reactor concept for a worm reactor, the worms are immobilised in a carrier material. The size of a worm reactor will therefore mainly {{be determined by the}} sludge consumption rate per unit of surface area. This design parameter was determined in sequencing batch experiments using sludge from a municipal WWTP. Long-term experiments using carrier materials with 300 and 350 µm mesh sizes showed surface specific consumption rates of 45 and 58 g TSS/(m 2 d), respectively. Using a 350 µm mesh will therefore result in a 29 % smaller reactor compared to using a 300 µm mesh. Large differences in consumption rates were found between different sludge types, although it was not clear what caused these differences. Worm biomass growth and decay rate were determined in sequencing batch experiments. The decay rate of 0. 023 d- 1 for worms in a carrier material was considerably higher than the decay rate of 0. 018 d- 1 for free worms. As a result, the net worm biomass growth rate for free worms of 0. 026 d- 1 was much higher than the 0. 009 – 0. 011 d- 1 for immobilised worms.

In situ mon-itoring of moisture distribution {{and changes in}} mechanical properties (stiffness) <b>of</b> municipal solid <b>waste</b> (MSW) is needed to optimize the safe and effective operation {{of these types of}} landfills. Geophysical methods, such as electrical-resistivity tomography, have effectively monitored moisture distribution during and after leachate injection. This study investigates seismic surveys to capture the changes in mechani-cal properties [shear modulus (via shear-wave velocity) and Poisson’s ratio] of MSW to infer the extent of degradation and provide dynamic properties needed for seismic stability evaluation. To achieve this goal, a series of seismic surveys were performed at the Veolia ES Orchard Hills landfill, 15 km south of Rockford, Illinois, to image seismic velocity structure and the Poisson’s ratio of a recirculation cell, compared with an adjacent newer landfill cell without leachate recirculation. Seismic data were collected using fan shot direct P-wave (compressional wave) surveys and S-wave (shear wave) surveys, conventional P-wave refraction, and the multichannel analysis of surface waves (MASW) method. The fan shot surveys employed a sledgehammer source {{on one side of the}} landfill and geophones on the opposite side, thus exploiting the landfill’s topography and geometry to image waste to a depth of approximately 10 m. P-wave-velocity tomographic models and S-wave-velocity tomographic models from these direct-wave (through-pile) raypaths indicate a dramatic velocity increase below 5 m depth, perhaps indicating consolidation and <b>compaction</b> <b>of</b> the <b>waste</b> material. The ratio in P-wave to S-wave velocity ranges from 1. 8 to 3. 7, with an average of approximately 2. 7, and Poisson’s ratio ranges from 0. 29 to 0. 46, with an average value of 0. 42 (standard deviation 0. 024).
