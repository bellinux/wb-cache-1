He was curious about whether bees would learn certain <b>colors</b> <b>faster</b> than others. He used lights of various color and intensity to project circles of light on a surface, a set-up like that used by von Frisch except that, by using light instead of cardboard, Menzel was able to easily change the intensity and color of the circles.|$|R
50|$|XGA-2 added a 24-bit DAC, {{but this}} was used only to extend the {{available}} master palette in 256-color mode, e.g. to allow true 256-greyscale output instead of the 64 grey levels previously available; {{there was still no}} direct Truecolor mode despite the adaptor featuring enough default onboard VRAM (1 MB) to support it. Other improvements included provision of the previously missing 800×600 resolution (using an SVGA or multisync monitor) in up to 65,536 <b>colors,</b> <b>faster</b> screen refresh rates in all modes (including non-interlace, flicker-free output for 1024×768), and improved accelerator performance and versatility.|$|R
5000|$|Paul Friedlander became {{fascinated by}} art {{involving}} {{the use of}} movement and light in the late 1960s, when he visited the Cybernetic Serendipity exhibition at the Institute of Contemporary Arts and the Kinetics show at the Hayward Gallery. He was most inspired by {{the works of the}} cybernetic artists Nicholas Schöffer(1912) and Wen-Ying Tsai(1928). Since then he has been strongly driven to make kinetic works. In 1983 he made an important discovery of the chaotic properties of spinning string and invented chromastrobic light 'light that changes <b>color</b> <b>faster</b> than the human eye can see'.|$|R

Several methods of illustrating flow structure are addressed including particle tracing, simulated oil flow, and shock finding. These {{are incorporated into}} an interactive graphics program for CFD flowfields, called PLOT 3 D. Emphasis is made on the difficulty in visualizing three-dimensional flow features, {{and the importance of}} <b>color,</b> <b>fast</b> 3 D image manipulation, and dynamic movie play-back in displaying such flows. The need for advanced algorithms to identify shock waves, vortices, and separation lines is pointed out. It is likely that the supercomputer will be needed for this process because of the size of 3 D and/or unsteady CFD databases...|$|E
30|$|Textile {{materials}} {{treatment with}} mordants prior to dyeing is called as pre-mordanting, which provides exclusive, sufficient time and sites on textile material to bind to the mordants. A proper layering of dye, mordant and textile material formed {{in this type}} of processing of natural colorants on textiles. Metal complexation with textile surface sites from one side and from dye on the other make the <b>color</b> <b>fast</b> to light, washing and rubbing. Chelating complexation of this processing makes the proper energy dissipation of photons of light in the complex and provide better light fastness to dyed materials. Optimum utilization of resources in pre-mordanting makes this more sustainable towards environment and flora and fauna.|$|E
30|$|The unmordated dyed silk showed {{color change}} rating of 4. This can be {{explained}} that the good fastness to washing for the sample dyed without mordant {{was due to the}} affinity of coloring component through H-bonding and van der Waals forces. Using mordants, the color change ratings were found to be within 3 / 4 to 5, where a rating of 5 (excellent) was found using tin-CT mordant. The ratings were found to be 4 / 5 in the case of using alum and alum-tin. So {{it can be said that}} the overall ratings of color change were good. As wash fastness is influenced by the rate of diffusion of dye molecules and state of dyes inside the fiber, dyes has a tendency to aggregate inside the fiber. Thus, their molecular size is increased resulting in good wash fastness. In addition, in the case of mordanted samples, complexing with mordant also has the effect of insolubilizing the dye, making it <b>color</b> <b>fast.</b>|$|E

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 56 - 59) Textile {{products can}} be printed by several different methods. The method considered {{in this study}} is silk screen printing, an important resist process in present use. Therefore, this research was conducted to investigate the hypotheses that a selected sample of screen printed fabrics will exhibit high color fastness ratings as measured by standard test procedures; that consumers are interested in the colorfastness properties of textile products; and that consumers use their knowledge of screen printed textiles when making decisions concerning the purchase of' selected textile products. A questionnaire was developed to determine consumer interest in the colorfastness properties of printed textiles, consumer knowledge of screen printing, consumer interest in purchasing textile products having screen printed designs, and the influence of identifiable screen prints in the consumer???s decision to purchase textile products. This questionnaire was given to 100 women living in the San Fernando Valley in the Los Angeles area. Chi squares were computed {{with the use of a}} General Electric 445 computer. Twenty screen printed fabrics of various fiber content were selected and tested for color fastness to laundering, carbon-arc light, perspiration, and crocking. The fabric samples were evaluated using AATCC scales. The selected fabrics included swimwear, drapery, and apparel. Two of the four swimwear fabrics had good colorfastness qualities. The other two fabrics would not be considered colorfast. The four drapery fabrics generally were colorfast in each of the four tests. The 12 apparel woven and knit fabric is varied in color fastness qualities. Generally, the fabrics with wash and wear, fast color or a similar finish were more <b>color</b> <b>fast</b> in each of the tests. The type of dye used or lack of finish could be factors that would affect the colorfastness qualities. The method used to screen print did not seem to have any effect on the colorfastness qualities. Therefore, only some of the selected screen printed fabrics exhibited high color fastness ratings. The conclusion drawn from the analysis of the data developed from the questionnaire is that consumers are interested in the colorfastness properties of textile products but that consumers are not specifically interested in textile products that have been screen printed...|$|E

50|$|The Game Boy {{version was}} largely cut down from its arcade counterpart. It had laggy {{controls}} and a limited button layout. It also omitted Reptile and the bloodier Fatality moves. However, players could play as Goro via a code. Johnny Cage was apparently {{intended to be}} a playable character, but was cut out; bits of his character data remain in the data files. The Game Gear version was similar to the Game Boy version, but with major improvements (<b>color,</b> <b>faster</b> gameplay, and tighter control). Like its 16-bit counterpart, the game was censored unless a cheat code (2, 1, 2, Down, Up) had been entered, but lacked Kano and Reptile. A Master System port based on the Game Gear version was released for PAL regions in early 1994. According to Phylene Riggs of Acclaim, an NES port was also planned at one point, but cancelled before it entered the programming stage.|$|R

40|$|A huge set of focused {{attention}} experiments show that {{when presented with}} color words printed in color, observers report the ink <b>color</b> <b>faster</b> if the carrier word {{is the name of}} the color rather than the name of an alternative color, the Stroop effect. There is also a large number (although not so numerous as the Stroop task) of so-called “redundant targets studies” that are based on divided attention instructions. These almost always indicate that observers report the presence of a visual target (‘redness’ in the stimulus) faster if there are two replications of the target (the word RED in red ink color) than if only one is present (RED in green or GREEN in red). The present set of four experiments employs the same stimuli and same participants in both designs. Evidence supports the traditional interference account of the Stroop effect, but also supports a non-interference parallel processing account of the word and the color in the divided attention task. Theorists are challenged to find a unifying model that parsimoniously explains both seemingly contradictory results...|$|R
40|$|The {{differential}} outcome effect {{refers to}} the increase in accuracy obtained in discrimination tasks when rewards provided for correct responses vary according to the stimulus presented. The current research compared a higher magnitude of reinforcement with a differential outcome to determine which condition would produce a higher rate or learning in a delayed matching to sample task. The participants were four White Carneaux pigeons. There were three conditions, one with the same outcomes of immediate access to 4 s reinforcement serving as the control and two with differential outcomes involving a 2 s delay to reinforcement for one outcome and immediate reinforcement for the other outcome. One differential outcome condition had 2 seconds of reinforcement and the other differential outcome condition had 4 seconds of reinforcement. An alternating treatment design was used for this study. Two of the four pigeons met mastery criteria for all three conditions. Results were mixed but the differential outcome condition with 2 s reinforcement was mastered in fewer trials by two of the birds. Most birds mastered the <b>colors</b> <b>fastest</b> with immediate outcomes versus delayed outcomes...|$|R
