Using five samples from each batch of cured sausages (n= 5), some chemical and physical analysis (pH, aw, chromatic coordinates L*, a* and b*), rheological tests (Texture Profile Analyse and cutting test), sensorial evaluation (colour intensity, off colours, aroma intensity, off aromas, taste intensity, off tastes, tenderness, juiciness and global evaluation) and microbiological analysis (mesophylic aerobic counts, psychrotrophics, yeasts, lactic acid bacteria, Micrococcaceae, Enterobacreriacea, Enterococcus faecalis, coliforms and E. coli) were carried out.

40|$|Background: The {{increasing}} number of mobile phones can physically cause electromagnetic interference (EMI) in medical environments; can also cause errors in immunoassays in laboratories. The ELISA readers are widely used as a useful diagnostic tool for Enzymun colorimetric assay in medicine. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate whether the ELISA reader could be interfered by the exposure to the 900 MHz cell phones in the laboratory. Materials and Methods: Human serum samples were collected from 14 healthy donors (9 women and 5 men) and each sample was divided into four aliquots and was placed into four batches for the in-vitro quantitative determination of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). During colorimetric reading of the first, second, and third batches, the ELISA reader (Stat Fax 2100, Awareness Technology, Inc., USA) was exposed to 0. 5, 1. 0, and 2. 0 W exposure of 900 MHz radiation, respectively. For the forth batch (control group), no radiation was applied. All experiments were performed comparing ELISA read out results of the I, II, and III batches with the <b>control</b> <b>batch,</b> using the Wilcoxon test with criterion level of P = 0. 050. Results: The final scores in the exposed batches I, II, and III were not statistically significant relative to the <b>control</b> <b>batch</b> (P > 0. 05). The results showed that 900 MHz radiation exposure did not alter the ELISA measured levels of hCG hormone in I (P = 0. 219), II (P = 0. 909), and III (P = 0. 056) batches compared to the <b>control</b> <b>batch.</b> Conclusion: This study showed that ELISA reader does not interfere by mobile phone RF radiation at a closed contact (less than 5 cm distance).

The findings revealed that shrinkage was interdependent on concrete composition and the result exhibited a higher shrinkage value for concrete with higher cement content and with higher slump value.

40|$|This work investigates void filling (idle periods) in long-reach Ethernet passive optical networks. We {{focus on}} {{reducing}} grant delays and hence reducing the average packet delay. We introduce {{a novel approach}} called parallel void thread (PVT), which allocates bandwidth grants during voids baseless of bandwidth requests. We introduce three different grant sizing schemes for PVT, namely void extension, count <b>controlled</b> <b>batch</b> void filling, and size <b>controlled</b> <b>batch</b> void filling. The proposed approaches canbe integrated with {{almost all of the}} previously reported dynamic bandwidth allocation schemes. Unlike other void filling schemes, PVT is less sensitive to the differential distance between optical network units and can work very well in the case of limited differential distances. We have analytically investigated the packet delay and derived a bound condition for PVT to outperform the other competitors. We support our work with extensive simulation study considering bursty traffic with long range dependence for both the single-class and differentiated services (DiffServ) scenarios. Numerical results show delay reduction up to 35 % compared with the non-void filling scheme for the single-class scenario. For DiffServ traffic, PVT achieves delay reduction up to 80 % for expedited forward traffic, 52 % for assured forward traffic, and 56 % for best effort traffic. © 2015 OSA...|$|R
