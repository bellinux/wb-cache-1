In this context, the distinctive feature of the Mozambican modern architecture (1948 - 1975) was its {{ability to respond to}} the specificities of the environment in which it operates by crossing the principles of the International Style with the constructive solutions of the local cultures, along with the Brazilian experience.. From this point of view, the excellence of this heritage lies, precisely, in this quest for a sustainable design, intrinsically linked to the place and the tropical climate. In order to contribute on the understanding and consolidation of knowledge about the Modern Movement in lusophone Africa, and especially in Mozambique, the present dissertation attempts to build a small narrative of this architecture, taking as guiding thread the climate issue, through a series of projects, that in some way influenced the definition of its language, and their paths in the landscape of the country. Based on a <b>cross</b> <b>reading</b> of the urban and architectural evolution in the Mozambican territory, along with a systematic analysis of four case studies in the city of Quelimane, this research work aims to contribute on the characterization of the vocabulary used and developed in this period from the perspective of what grants it its uniqueness.

40|$|International audienceDue to {{the growth}} of {{electric}} end-uses, the management of the variations in time of the electric power demand has become essential, especially in the residential sector. According to this issue, the anticipation of the power demand is of great interest. This implies a better knowledge of the electric load curve of the household stock. Papers about understanding and forecasting energy demand are numerous but studies on building's load curves are rare. In this paper we propose a cross analysis of some existing methods capable of building up a residential electric load curve. Two main types of load curve models have been identified in the literature: top-down and bottom-up methods. Even if the review presents two existing top-down approaches, the authors focused the further analysis on bottom-up models. For each of them we first identify its functional characteristics: finality and scope, input data required, output format, modeled appliances and end-uses covered, generation of the diversity and validation of the model. Secondly, we establish a bloc diagram representing its architecture with focus on the mathematical model chosen. Finally, the authors list the limits of the model in view of the criteria needed to build up an ideal, bottom-up and technically explicit load curve model for the residential sector. A <b>cross</b> <b>reading</b> of the different methodologies is proposed through a global table that characterizes and sums up the analyzed models. Moreover, a graphical representation of the models studied is proposed, according to three criteria (range of application, modelling of the diversity, time scale accuracy) that allows us to compare them "at a glance". To conclude, an identification of the gaps among existing models is proposed. It consists of listing the end-uses, the appliances and other behavioural correlations which may affect the load curve and that are not included in the reviewed methodologies and need further research...|$|E

Objetivos gerais: realizar uma leitura {{transversal}} dos referenciais teóricos que fundamentam as políticas públicas brasileiras destinadas à formação docente, presentes nos documentos de caráter normativo/determinativo representados pelas leis e decretos e, aqueles de caráter orientador, referentes à temática da educação inclusiva no que tange ao processo de escolarização das pessoas com deficiências intelectuais, sensoriais e físicas; ainda, analisar aos currículos dos cursos de Licenciatura em: Ciências Biológicas; Geografia; História; Letras; Matemática; Pedagogia; e dos Programas de Pós-graduação stricto sensu nas referidas áreas e/ou equivalentes oferecidos pela UFG, UFMT, UFMS, UFU e UnB, buscando compreender a inserção desta temática nos mesmos. Investigou-se 29 projetos pedagógicos de cursos de Licenciatura, 32 de Programas de Mestrado e de doutorados, nas áreas afins aos das respectivas licenciaturas focos deste estudo. Ainda analisaram-se os Projetos de Desenvolvimento Institucional (PDI) da UnB, UFMT e UFMS e o Projeto Institucional de Formação e Desenvolvimento do Profissional da Educação da UFU. Resultados do estudo: A análise do conjunto dos documentos nacionais demonstra que: a) apesar de o lócus da educação das pessoas com deficiência intelectual, sensorial e física ser, preferencialmente, a educação comum, as questões relativas a esta temática acontecem em espaços claramente destinados a tal finalidade a educação especial; b) quando abordam a formação docente, não envolvem a escolarização deste grupo de pessoas e, quando o faz, ela é tratada no sentido da diversidade humana; c) as preocupações apresentadas centram-se nas condições de acessibilidade destas pessoas no tocante à estrutura física e adaptação de materiais de apoio e comunicação, não as relacionando aos atos de ensinar e aprender, ações intimamente vinculadas à formação docente. Quanto aos documentos internacionais, destaca-se a presença de uma abordagem ampla dos aspectos relativos à formação docente para a escolarização de pessoas com deficiência intelectual, sensorial e física, demarcando sua importância para a concretização das metas relativas ao oferecimento de educação de qualidade para todos. Quanto aos currículos dos cursos de Licenciatura Ciências Biológicas, Letras, Geografia, História, Matemática e Pedagogia, das Universidades Federais estudadas, um total de 13 (treze) cursos, representando um percentual de 45 %, apresenta em seus currículos a presença da discussão sobre Educação Inclusiva e/ou Educação Especial e 16 (dezesseis) deles, equivalente a 55 %, não abordam a temática. Dos que abordam a temática, em 46 % dos casos, a discussão acontece em disciplinas de natureza obrigatória, envolvendo, assim, todos os estudantes do curso e 54 % são optativas. Em suma, no conjunto dos documentos analisados, a inserção da temática relativa à escolarização dos alunos com deficiência intelectual, sensorial e física nos currículos das licenciaturas das instituições lócus do estudo encontra-se em processo inicial, e é um espaço a ser construído em todos os cursos, sinalizando para a necessidade da inserção da temática nos debates institucionais, pois esta não é uma demanda relativa a um curso da instituição, mas o é de toda a instituição, de todas suas licenciaturas. This {{study has}} as object of analysis {{the issue of}} public policies for teacher formation and inclusive education, focusing on education of people with intellectual, sensory and physical disabilities at common schools. General Purposes: to perform a <b>cross</b> <b>reading</b> of the theoretical references that support the Brazilian public policies for teacher training, represented in the documents of normative/determinative character represented by laws and decrees, and those of mentor character, relating {{to the theme of}} inclusive education, in terms of the educational process of people with intellectual, sensory and physical disabilities; also to examine the curricula of graduation courses in: Biological Sciences, Geography, History, Languages and Literature, Mathematics, Pedagogy, and Programs of Post-graduation stricto sensu in these areas and/or equivalent offered by UFG, UFMT, UFMS, UFU and UnB seeking to understand the inclusion of this theme in them. 29 pedagogical projects of graduation teaching courses were investigated, 32 for masters and Ph. D. programs in related areas to the Graduation courses that this study focuses. Also, the Institutional Development Projects (IDP) of UnB, UFMT and UFMS were examined and the Institutional Project of Formation and Development of Education Professionals of UFU. Results of the study: The analysis of these national documents shows that: a) although the locus of education of people with intellectual, sensory and physical disabilities is, preferably, common education, the issues related to this thematic occur in spaces clearly dedicated to this purpose - special education, b) when concerning teacher training, it does not involve the education of this group of people, and when it does, it is treated as human diversity; c) the concerns showed focus on the conditions of accessibility of these people in terms of physical structure and adaptation of support and communication materials, not relating them to acts of teaching and learning, actions closely linked to teacher training. As for international documents, the presence of a broad approach of the aspects related to teacher training for the education of people with intellectual, sensory and physical disabilities is emphasized, demarcating its importance for achieving the targets related to the offering of quality education for all. As for the curricula of graduation courses in Biological Sciences, Languages and Literature, Geography, History, Mathematics and Pedagogy of the studied Federal Universities a total of 13 (thirteen) courses, representing a percentage of 45 % shows in their curricula the presence of the discussion about Inclusive Education and/or Special Education and 16 (sixteen) of them, equivalent to 55 % do not approach the thematic. Of those which approach this theme, in 46 % of the cases the discussion occurs in subjects of compulsory nature, thus involving all students of the course and 54 % are optional. In short, in all the documents analyzed, the insertion of the thematic related to the education of students with intellectual, sensory and physical disabilities in the curricula of graduations of the institutions locus of study is in the initial process, being a space to be built in all courses, signaling the need for the insertion of the thematic in the institutional debates, because this is not a demand of one course of institution, but it is a demand of the whole institution, of all its graduation courses for teachers...|$|E

40|$|Tez (Doktora) [...] İstanbul Teknik Üniversitesi, Fen Bilimleri Enstitüsü, 2013 Thesis (PhD) [...] İstanbul Technical University, Institute of Science and Technology, 2013 Bu çalışmada, mimarlık ve moda tasarımı arakesitinde yapılan bir okuma ile, farklı tasarım disiplinleri arasında yapılacak çalışmalar için bir araştırma yöntemi önerilmektedir. Sürecin bütününün sonuç olduğu bu çalışmada, iki disiplinin arakesitindeki uygulamalara, araçlara ve kavramlara, eşzamanlı ve geri dönüşlü olarak okumalar yapılarak bir dizin oluşturma ve polar bir haritalama yapmaya gidilmektedir. Mimarlık ve moda tasarımı disiplinleri arasındaki ortak nokta insan bedenidir. Bu disiplinler arasındaki ilişkiler irdelendiğinde, modadaki mimarlığa, mimarlıktaki modaya bakılmaktadır. Moda tasarımındaki mimarinin arka planına, felsefesine, teknolojilerine bakılarak, mimariye gönderme yapan modacılar ve mimar kökenli modacıların işleri incelenir, tekstil enstalasyonlar, zar strüktürler, mobil yapılar, malzemelere yönelik genel okumalar yapılmaktadır. Mimarlık ve moda tasarımı disiplinleri arasındaki tarihsel paralelliklerin altı çizilir, Roland Barthes’in, Moda Dizgesi isimli doktora tez çalışması üzerinden okumalar yapılırken, bu çalışmadan metodolojik referanslar alınır. Metodoloji okumaları ile, çalışma alanı, dekonstrüktivizm-yapıbozum ile sınırlandırılır, tez çalışmasının kapsamında sadece dekonstrüktif örnekler üzerinden gidilmesine karar verilir. Bu kararla birlikte, moda tasarımı ve mimarlık disiplinleri ilişkisindeki beslenme kaynakları idealar, ve araçlar, teknoloji irdelenir. Disiplinler arasındaki ilişkiler kurulurken, dekonstruksiyona yönelik kavramlar tartışılır, bu kavramlara karşılık gelen uygulamalara yönelik okumalar yapılır. Moda tasarımı ve mimarlık disiplinleri arakesitinde birarada ve arada olan etkinlikler, sergiler, çalışmalar irdelenir. Star mimar ve star moda tasarımcılarının ortak üretimleri ve nesneleri üzerinden yapılan okumalarda yeni kavramlara varılır, böylece, irdelenen kavram ve örneklerin dekonstrüktivist-yapıbozumcu olması ile birlikte, okumanın kendisi başlıbaşına yapıbozumcu bir metodoloji önerisi oluşturur. The {{scope of}} this theisis includes, requestioning the {{dynamics}} between fashion and architecture disciplines by discussing the updated issues about the practice of architecture. It aims to read the intersection points of fashion and architecture, the concepts that both disciplines uses and and the conceptual reading through the opportunities and potentials of new openings due to the togetherness of the concepts and evaluation together with their reflections to the practice. All {{of the work that}} is presented is putting on all the donnes that have been found during the research process itself. That is the reason why the theisis starts with giving some information about the process. At the beginning and during the process of the research, literature, magazines of popular culture, internet, fashion and architecture magazines are looked for and a notebook that includes some brainstorming collages of the concepts, tools, technology, questions and products that stand in the intersection areas of fashion design and architecture. With the ones on the notebook, first of all the products that are in between have been cross-read, a reading through objects and the dominant concepts are determined. Then another reading is done through this concepts that stands in-between. During the literature research, it has been found that Barthes has a Phd theisis about the fashion system and the references and the methodology he uses during his research has a very huge effect in this theisis and Barthes has been placed in the thresholds section of the theisis. Barthes’ references, such as Vladimir Propp and Greimas have also an important place {{in order to understand the}} methodology of Barthes. It is important to note that, Barthes has not been a reference at the very beginning of the theisis. His work has been found during the literature research and also effects the general methodology of the theisis this way, just like this theisis itself. The variety and complexity of the concepts that have been assumed to be related with the theisis because of their positions between the two disciplines, and the flashbacks of the process makes detemining the boundaries of the theisis and the main question of the theisis very problematic and at that point one should make a decision about the conceptual frame in order to express the main problematics and main position of the theisis. At that point, it is chosen to use a deconstructive methodology during the process. Although this title aims to narrow the working area, it is accepted as the <b>cross</b> <b>reading</b> and understanding method. It is very important to point out that, the main structure of the work has not been set during the research process. Because the research is very simultaneaus and includes too many flashbacks, for making the research understandable and readible, the structure has been set afterwards. In order to make the discovered imprints, examples, cases, concepts, all of the visual and linguistic information readible, some codings are prepared and revisualise the codes, some mappings are prepared. It is assumed that with the unanswered questions for the new motivations for researches, new openings can be achieved. While editing the theisis this way, it is aimed to discuss the tools which are accepted with the strategies of the process that helps to produce and the directing conceptual outputs which stand backstage at the up-to-date products of the two disciplines. That is why the dominant samples, objects and actors are chosen because of their innovative characters at this direction. At this point, it is not aimed to compare two disciplines that have determined boundaries but to understand what goes on at the area which the boundaries of the disciplines melt and reading the distinctive products at that area. In order to visualise the melting points, after determining the general concepts, some cases that can be assumed to be related with that concepts are chosen as samples. While working on that samples, a polar mapping is done with the concepts related with the cases. The axes that make the polars of the mapping are the case’s qualitative, quantitative, functional and conceptual characters. After polar mapping has been done, then, blurring of the conceps which are close to the polar lines has been being made,which helps to compare different cases on the same images. Also, a conceptual mapping is done in order to see which concepts are dominant among the cases, which stand recessive. Even the theisis generally continues with the reading on the fashion and architecture disciplines, it is important to express the variety of the layers that it includes, the relation it has with the language and the way it influences the design principles. The work as a whole, the referances and resources and the objects that have been reached have a variety. To reduct this variety and complexity to the base of relations and because of realising that encountered readings that have the references of the two disciplines having related with language, it is important to determine the concepts that will make an index while doing a reading over the products (objects). At this point, it is seen that the linguistic indicators making a sembolic meaning for the objects in between fashion design and architecture, and in fact this also marks the important location of the metaphysics making the reading at the area where the boundaries melting. Another important point is, presenting the readings in different layers at the same structure. This theisis while marks the historical parallels, similarness of the forms, the common concepts and at the points where the functions transforming to each other, with all of the concepts and the tools that are meant to be the background of the design idea, also includes the layers that can be more philosophical in a way it relates with the language.
