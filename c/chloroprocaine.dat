25|$|Local anesthetics {{are broken}} down into 2 categories: ester-linked and amide-linked drugs. The esters include benzocaine, procaine, tetracaine, and <b>chloroprocaine.</b> The amides include {{lidocaine}}, mepivacaine, prilocaine, bupivacaine, ropivacaine, and levobupivacaine. <b>Chloroprocaine</b> is a short-acting drug (45–90 minutes), lidocaine and mepivacaine are intermediate duration (90–180 minutes), and bupivacaine, levobupivacaine, and ropivacaine are long-acting (4–18 hours). Drugs commonly used for peripheral nerve blocks include lidocaine, ropivacaine, bupivacaine, and mepivacaine. These drugs are often combined with adjuvants (additives) with the end goal of increasing {{the duration of the}} analgesia or shortening time of onset. Additives may include epinephrine, clonidine, and dexmedetomidine. Vasoconstriction caused by local anesthetic may be further enhanced synergistically with the addition of epinephrine, the most widely used additive. Epinephrine increases the length of analgesic duration and decreases blood flow by acting as an agonist at the α1-adrenoceptor. Dexmedetomidine is not as widely used as epinephrine. Studies in humans indicate improved onset time and increased duration of analgesia.|$|E

2500|$|The {{brachial plexus}} is {{a bundle of}} nerves innervating the {{shoulder}} and arm and can be blocked at different levels {{depending on the type}} of upper extremity surgery being performed. [...] Interscalene brachial plexus blocks can be done before shoulder, arm, and elbow surgery. The interscalene block is done at the neck where the brachial plexus emerges between the anterior and middle scalene muscles. [...] Lidocaine is injected first to numb the skin and then a blunt needle is used to protect the nerves from damage as the physician places the needle very close to the nerves. The needle goes in about 3–4cm and a single shot of local anesthetic is injected or a catheter is placed. The most common local anesthetics used at the site of the nerves are bupivicaine, mepivicaine, and <b>chloroprocaine.</b> [...] There is a very high chance that the phrenic nerve, which innervates the diaphragm, will be blocked so this block should only be done on patients who have use of their accessory respiratory muscles. The block may not affect the C8 and T1 roots which supply part of the hand, so it is usually not done for hand surgeries.|$|E

5000|$|Amide-linked local {{anesthetic}} agents, such as lidocaine and bupivacaine, {{can become}} [...] "trapped" [...] in their ionized forms on the fetal {{side of the}} placenta, so their net transfer across the placenta is increased. An ester-linked local anesthetic agent, such as 2-chloroprocaine, is rapidly metabolized, and placental transfer is limited. Since the metabolism of 2-chloroprocaine by fetal plasma is slower than in maternal plasma, the potential for ion trapping exists. Fetal pH is slightly lower than maternal (7.32 to 7.38), thus most unionized drugs are [...] "ion trapped" [...] to a degree, even in a healthy fetus. <b>Chloroprocaine</b> (pKa 8.7) is the drug of choice for epidural analgesia and a decompensating fetus, {{because it does not}} participate in ion trapping.

50|$|Choice of agentsA person {{receiving}} an epidural for pain relief may receive local anaesthetic, an opioid, or both. Common local anaesthetics include lidocaine, mepivacaine, bupivacaine, ropivacaine, and <b>chloroprocaine.</b> Common opioids include hydromorphone, morphine, fentanyl, sufentanil, and pethidine (known as meperidine in the United States).

50|$|The {{root cause}} of the {{condition}} is not entirely clear, and {{it appears to have}} multiple causes, including iatrogenic cause from misplaced epidural steroid injection therapy when accidentally administered intrathecally (inside the dura mater, the sac enveloping the arachnoid mater), or from contrast media used in myelography prior to the introduction of Metrizamide. Other noninfectious inflammatory processes include surgery, intrathecal hemorrhage, and the administration of anesthetics (e.g. <b>chloroprocaine),</b> and steroids (e.g. prednisolone, triamcinolone acetonide). A variety of other causes exist, including infectious, inflammatory, and neoplastic processes. Infectious causes include bacterial, viral, fungal, and parasitic agents.

5000|$|Fibrous {{scarring}} {{can also}} be a complication within the subarachnoid space. It is notoriously difficult to detect and evaluate. Prior to the development of magnetic resonance imaging, the only way to ascertain the presence of arachnoiditis was by opening the dura.

It {{can also be}} caused by the long term pressure brought about with either a severe disc herniation or spinal stenosis. [...] The presence of both epidural scarring and arachnoiditis in the same patient are probably quite common. Arachnoiditis is a broad term denoting inflammation of the meninges and subarachnoid space. A variety of causes exist, including infectious, inflammatory, and neoplastic processes.Infectious causes include bacterial, viral, fungal, and parasitic agents. Noninfectious inflammatory processes include surgery, intrathecal hemorrhage, and the administration of intrathecal (inside the dural canal) agents such as myelographic contrast media, anesthetics (e.g. <b>chloroprocaine),</b> and steroids (e.g. Depo-Medrol, Kenalog). Lately iatrogenic arachnoiditis has been attributed to misplaced Epidural Steroid Injection therapy when accidentally administered intrathecally. The preservatives and suspension agents found in all steroid injectates, which aren't indicated for epidural administration by the U.S. Food & Drug Administration due to reports of severe adverse events including arachnoiditis, paralysis and death, have now been directly linked to the onset of the disease following the initial stage of chemical meningitis. [...] Neoplasia includes the hematogenous spread of systemic tumors, such as breast and lung carcinoma, melanoma, and non-Hodgkin lymphoma.

Strictly speaking, {{the most common cause of}} arachnoiditis in failed back syndrome is not infectious or from cancer. It is due to non-specific scarring secondary to the surgery or the underlying pathology.|$|E

40|$|The {{maternal}} {{plasma concentration}} at delivery and the umbilical venous plasma con-centration of lignocaine have been determined following {{the use of}} the drug to produce epidural analgesia. Two modes of administering the drug have been examined: one in which a single epidural injection of lignocaine was given and one in which repeated injections were given to produce analgesia for a prolonged period. The results obtained show that lignocaine is rapidly transported from the epidural space to the foetal circu-lation and that it is present in the foetal circulation in high concentration, in relation to maternal plasma concentration, within 15 minutes after injection. The ratio of umbilical venous plasma concentration to maternal plasma concentration at delivery varied from 0. 25 to 1. 00.

Current local anesthetics display suboptimal pharmacokinetic profile during CWI; <b>chloroprocaine</b> (CP) has ideal characteristics, but {{has never been}} tested for CWI. We performed an animal study to investigate the pharmacokinetic profile and anti-inflammatory effect of CP during CWI. A total of 14 piglets received an infusion catheter after pararectal laparotomy and were randomly allocated {{to one of three}} groups: 5  mL/h infusion of saline (group A), CP 1. 5 % (group B) and CP 0. 5 % (group C). Blood sampling was performed to assess absorption and systemic inflammation at 0, 3, 6, 12, 24, 48, 72, 96, 102 and 108  hours. The wound and contralateral healthy abdominal wall were sampled for histological analyses. Absorption of CP from the site of infusion, evaluated as the plasmatic concentrations of CP and its metabolite, 4 -amino- 2 -chlorobenzoic acid (CABA), showed a peak during the first 6  hours, but both CP and its metabolite rapidly disappeared after stopping CP infusion. Local inflammation was reduced in groups B and C (CP-treated p < 0. 001), in a CP dose-dependent fashion. While CP inhibited in a dose-dependent manner pig mononuclear cells (MNCs) in vitro proliferation to a polyclonal activator, no effect on systemic cytokines’ concentrations or on ex vivo monocytes’ responsiveness was observed, suggesting the lack of systemic effects, in line with the very short half-life of CP in plasma. CP showed a very good profile for use in CWI, with dose-dependent local anti-inflammatory effects, limited absorption and rapid clearance from the bloodstream upon discontinuation. No cytotoxicity or side effects were observed. CP, therefore, may represent an optimal choice for clinical CWI, adaptable to each patient’s need, and protective on wound inflammatory response (and hyperalgesia) after surgery.

40|$|Daniela Ghisi, Stefano Bonarelli Department of Anaesthesia and Postoperative Intensive Care, Istituto Ortopedico Rizzoli, Bologna, Italy Abstract: Spinal {{anesthesia}} is {{a reliable}} and safe technique for procedures of the lower extremities. Nevertheless, some of its characteristics may limit its use for ambulatory surgery, including delayed ambulation, risk of urinary retention, and pain after block regression. The current availability of short-acting local anesthetics has renewed interest for this technique also {{in the context of}} short- and ultra-short procedures. <b>Chloroprocaine</b> (CP) is an amino-ester local anesthetic with a very short half-life. It was introduced and has been successfully used for spinal anesthesia since 1952. Sodium bisulfite was then added as a preservative after 1956. The drug was then abandoned in the 1980 s for several reports of neurological deficits in patients receiving accidentally high doses of intrathecal CP during epidural labor analgesia. Animal studies have proven the safety of the preservative-free formulation, which has been extensively evaluated in volunteer studies as well as in clinical practice with a favorable profile in terms of both safety and efficacy. In comparison with bupivacaine, 2 -chloroprocaine (2 -CP) showed faster offset times to end of anesthesia, unassisted ambulation, and discharge from hospital. These findings suggests that 2 -CP may be a suitable alternative to low doses of long-acting local anesthetics in ambulatory surgery. Its safety profile also suggests that 2 -CP could be a valid substitute for intrathecal short- and intermediate-acting local anesthetics, such as lidocaine and mepivacaine – often causes of transient neurological symptoms. In this context, literature suggests a dose ranging between 30 and 60 mg of 2 -CP for procedures lasting 60 minutes or less, while 10 mg is considered the no-effect dose.

40|$|The {{present study}} tested the {{hypothesis}} that patients receiving epidural bupivacaine before surgery would require less morphine postoperatively and/or report less intense pain than patients receiving epidural bupivacaine after incision but {{before the end of}} surgery. Forty-two patients (ASA class I-III) scheduled for lower abdominal surgery were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 groups of equal size and prospectively studied using a double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover design. Epidural catheters were placed in the T 12 -L 1 or L 1 -L 2 interspaces pre-operatively, the position of the catheter was confirmed with 3 % <b>chloroprocaine</b> with epinephrine 1 : 200, 000, and sensory testing was carried out until levels had receded to below T 12. Group 1 received 15 ml of 0. 5 % epidural bupivacaine injected 35 min before incision followed by 15 ml of epidural normal saline 30 min after incision. Group 2 received 15 ml of epidural normal saline injected 37 min before incision followed by 15 ml of 0. 5 % epidural bupivacaine 30 min after incision. General anaesthesia was induced with thiopental (4 – 6 mg/kg) and maintained with N 2 O/O 2 and isoflurane. Paralysis was achieved with pancuronium (0. 1 mg/kg). Opioids were not used as pre-medication or during surgery. Postoperative analgesia consisted of patient-controlled (PCA) intravenous morphine. Visual analogue pain scores (VAS) (at rest and after standardized mobilization) did not differ significantly between the 2 groups but McGill Pain Questionnaire (MPQ) pain ratings were significantly lower in group 1 at the 24 and 72 h assessments. Group 1 used significantly less morphine than did group 2 between 12 and 24 h after surgery. Cumulative PCA morphine consumption in group 1 (55. 2 ± 4. 7 mg) was significantly lower than in group 2 (71. 7 ± 6. 1 mg) 24 h and 48 h (group 1 : 86. 8 ± 6. 3 mg vs. group 2 : 108. 9 ± 9. 8 mg) after surgery, but not at the 72 h assessment. Reduction in morphine dose at 24, 48 and 72 h amounted to 30 %, 25 % and 22 %, respectively. The results suggest that single-shot pre-emptive epidural local anaesthesia is associated with a short-term morphine-sparing effect which is most pronounced between 12 and 24 h after surgery.

Just in the process of changing position, the patient coughed badly as well as complained about chest congestion and dyspnea. At the same time, the SpO 2 decreased to 50  %. Rale was auscultated on bilateral chest, the blood pressure was 102 / 65  mmHg. The symptom improved soon after 10  mg furosemide was given intravenously and with the head of bed elevated. 2  % lidocaine 3  mL was injected into epidural for testing. Then sensory block level of S 5 –T 6 was achieved by titrating 15  mL <b>chloroprocaine</b> through the two catheters. Along with epidural anesthesia, phenylephrine was pumped at a rate of 0.1 – 0.3  μg kg− 1  min− 1 to keep hemodynamics stable. During cesarean section, the mother was infused intravenously 5  IU dose of oxytocin after the baby was delivered. 3  min later, the symptoms as they occurred in position changing before reappeared unexpectedly. Then 10  mg furosemide, 3  mg morphine and 2  mg cediland were administered, then the patient felt better gradually. Apgar scores of the baby were 7 at 1  min and 10 at 5  min. In the surgery, the patient received 200  mL Ringer’s lactate, blood loss was about 200  mL and output of urine was 700  mL. The mother was transferred to intensive care unit, the baby was sent to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit for premature birth postoperatively. 7  days later, the patient recovered and was discharged.|$|E
40|$|Studies that {{evaluate}} {{the use of}} ultrasound-guided continuous paravertebral nerve blocks in pediatric patients are scarce, although the use of peripheral nerve blocks has indeed increased in popularity in the adult demographic. The present study aims to describe the epidemiology, safety and efficacy of ultrasound-guided continuous thoracic paravertebral nerve blocks as an everyday practice {{on a large scale}} in pediatric patients at a busy, academic, tertiary-care hospital. In all patients studied, a linear ultrasound transducer was used via the transverse in-line technique for catheter placement. Transducer configuration (frequency of oscillation and probe length) was varied based on individual patient factors, such as age, weight and body mass index. A descriptive, retrospective chart review of all patients who received a continuous paravertebral nerve block within a two-year time frame, from 10 / 2012 to 10 / 2014, was conducted, resulting in a sample size of 238 paravertebral catheters placed in 214 patients. In regards to patient demographics, the median age was 2 years (IQR 0. 8 years - 12 years), with a range of 1 day to 18 years; and the average weight was 25. 3 kg ± 23. 6 kg, with a range of 1. 8 kg to 113. 7 kg. The median catheter duration was 3 days (IQR 2 days - 5 days), with 88. 8 % of catheters placed unilaterally, and 11. 2 % placed bilaterally. Median postoperative pain scores, intubation time, morphine equivalent consumption, and midazolam consumption were measured for all patients. The overall complication rate was 16. 8 % (n = 36 patients) with a minor catheter complication rate of 16. 4 % (n = 35). 6. 1 % (n = 13) of complications were due to catheter leakage, 4. 7 % (n = 10) due to catheter dislodgement, 2. 8 % (n = 6) due to skin irritation, 1. 9 % (n = 4) due to catheter occlusion and 0. 9 % (n = 2) due to minor bleeding at the site of catheter insertion. Only one patient experienced a major complication (0. 5 % of total patients), manifested as a self-resolving, 30 -second seizure after a bolus administration of 2 % <b>chloroprocaine</b> to manage postoperative pain. The patient was bag-mask ventilated for 60 seconds and the catheter was discontinued. No long-term sequelae were present in this case. Lastly, 98. 1 % (n = 210) of patients experienced sufficient pain coverage, yielding a failed block rate of 1. 9 % (n = 4). These results demonstrate safety and efficacy of ultrasound-guided transverse in-line continuous, thoracic paravertebral nerve block in pediatric patients, especially small infants and children. This technique provides an analgesic alternative to the thoracic epidural for postoperative pain treatment in pediatric patients...|$|E
