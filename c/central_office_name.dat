50|$|A {{telephone}} exchange name or <b>central</b> <b>office</b> <b>name</b> was a distinguishing and memorable name {{assigned to a}} central office. It identified the switching system to which a telephone was connected. Each central office served a maximum of 10,000 subscriber lines identified by the last four digits of the telephone number. Areas or cities with more subscribers were served by multiple central offices, possibly hosted in the same building. The leading letters of a <b>central</b> <b>office</b> <b>name</b> were used as the leading components of the telephone number representation, so that each telephone number in an area was unique. These letters were mapped to digits, which was indicated visibly on a dial telephone.|$|E
50|$|The {{central office}} code was chosen such {{that it could be}} {{represented}} by the first two letters of the <b>central</b> <b>office</b> <b>name</b> according to a digit-to-letter mapping that was printed on the face of a rotary dial, by grouping a set of letters with the digits 2 through 9. Such letter translations, designed by W.G. Blauvelt in 1917, had been used in the Bell System in large metropolitan areas since the late 1910s. The network reorganization eventually resulted in a 2-letter 5-digit (2L-5N) representation of telephone numbers for every exchange in North America.|$|E
50|$|Several {{systematic}} telephone numbering plans {{existed in}} various communities, typically evolving {{over time as}} the subscriber base outgrew older numbering schemes. A widely used numbering plan was a system of using two letters from the <b>central</b> <b>office</b> <b>name</b> with four or five digits, which was designated as 2L-4N or 2L-5N, or simply 2-4 and 2-5, respectively, but some large cities initially selected plans with three letters (3L-4N). In 1917, W. G. Blauvelt of AT&T proposed a mapping system that displayed three letters each with the digits 2 through 9 on the dial.|$|E
50|$|In {{small towns}} {{with a single}} <b>central</b> <b>office,</b> local calls {{typically}} required dialing only four or five-digits at most, without using named exchanges. A toll call required the assistance of an operator, who asked {{for the name of}} the town and the local station number. Some independent telephone companies, not part of the Bell System, also did not implement <b>central</b> <b>office</b> <b>names.</b>|$|R
50|$|As {{demand for}} {{telephone}} service {{grew in the}} post-World War II period, it was foreseeable that the demand would exceed the addressing capacity of the existing system of using memorable telephone <b>central</b> <b>office</b> <b>names</b> as prefixes in telephone numbers. Several letter combinations had no pronounceable or memorable names {{and could not be}} used. Several North American numbering plan areas (NPAs) were divided so that more office codes became available to smaller regions. However, as the growth accelerated, the Bell System decided to implement all-number calling (ANC) and to deprecate the use of <b>central</b> <b>office</b> <b>names</b> to provide more <b>central</b> <b>office</b> codes to each NPA. This extended the usable numbering plan and only two area code splits became necessary between 1962 and 1981. All-number calling was phased in starting in 1958 and most areas had adopted it fully by the mid-1960s. In some areas it did not become universal until the 1980s. The Bell System published and distributed area code handbooks yearly which compiled the towns available for calling using an area code.|$|R
50|$|In smaller {{communities}} with four- or five-digit numbers {{and a single}} city exchange, <b>central</b> <b>office</b> <b>names</b> appeared {{for the first time}} in the late 1950s, and then solely to match the North American direct distance dial standard of a three-digit area code and seven-digit local number. The names, usually chosen from standard Bell System lists, had no local significance and were short-lived; phase-out began soon after 1960.|$|R
50|$|Telephone {{directories}} {{or other}} telephone number displays, {{such as in}} advertising, typically listed the telephone number showing the significant letters of the <b>central</b> <b>office</b> <b>name</b> in bold capital letters, followed by the digits that identified the subscriber line. On the number card of the telephone instrument, the name was typically shown in full, but only the significant letters to be dialed were capitalized, {{while the rest of}} the name was shown in lower case, such as in the example image for the telephone number LAkewood-2697 in service in Lakewood, NJ (USA).|$|E
50|$|The first direct-dialed long-distance {{telephone}} calls were {{possible in the}} New Jersey communities of Englewood and Teaneck. Customers of the ENglewood 3, ENglewood 4 and TEaneck 7 exchanges, who could already dial New York City and area, were able to dial 11 cities across the United States, simply by dialing the three-digit area code and the seven-digit number, {{which at the time}} consisted of the first two letters of the <b>central</b> <b>office</b> <b>name</b> and five digits. On November 10, 1951, Englewood Mayor M. Leslie Denning made the first customer-dialed long distance call, to Mayor Frank Osborne of Alameda, California.|$|E
50|$|When Pacific Telephone {{converted}} its San Francisco {{operations to}} 2L-5N calling in 1947, the old <b>central</b> <b>office</b> <b>names</b> {{were kept in}} most cases, with an extra digit appended. Certain exchanges were abandoned after being converted from manual service, such as WEst, RAndolph, and the famous CHina exchange of Chinatown. The manual 25th Street office in San Francisco, serving the MIssion, ATwater, and VAlencia exchanges, was converted by Pacific to dial in 1952. On September 6, 1953, JUniper 6, previously known as RAndolph in the 2L-4N era, the last manual office within the City and County, cut over its 2700 subscribers to crossbar equipment in the new Juniper <b>central</b> <b>office</b> on Onondaga Avenue.|$|R
50|$|States {{that were}} divided into {{multiple}} areas were assigned area codes with a 1 in the middle, the second position, while areas that covered an entire state or province, were numbered with the digit 0 as the middle digit. In order to distinguish seven-digit dialing from ten-digit dialing, <b>central</b> <b>office</b> codes were restricted to not having a 0 or 1 in the middle position. This was already common practice, because the system of using the initial letters of <b>central</b> <b>office</b> <b>names</b> did not assign letters to digits 1 and 0. Furthermore, area codes and <b>central</b> <b>office</b> codes could not start with 0 or 1, because 0 was used for operator assistance, and a leading single pulse, i.e. the digit 1, was automatically ignored by most switching equipment of the time. Additionally, the last two digits of an area code could not be the same, so that the assignments N00 and N11 (N = 2-9) were reserved for special purposes, as some <b>central</b> <b>offices</b> had been using them already for special services. The area codes N10 were reserved similarly and most {{were used for the}} Teletypewriter Exchange Service (TWX).|$|R
5000|$|Telephone {{companies}} often give <b>names</b> {{to their}} <b>central</b> <b>offices.</b> [...] The <b>names</b> frequently {{relate to the}} name given to the exchanges served from that office {{in the days of}} two-letter, five-number dialing, where a telephone number might have been referred to as [...] "MOhawk 3-1234". The numbers are now listed as all-figures, so (713) MOhawk x-xxxx becomes +1-713-66x-xxxx.|$|R
5000|$|In basic {{telephony}} {{there are}} two types of offices: local and foreign. A local office was assigned a specific area, and all telephone services provided to that area came from that <b>central</b> <b>office.</b> Each <b>central</b> <b>office</b> had its unique identifier. In the early days names were used, such as [...] "Jackson" [...] or [...] "Newton". The <b>office</b> <b>names</b> were changed to three-digit numerical exchange codes (NNX), prefixed to the local phone number (not the area code).|$|R
50|$|If the <b>central</b> <b>office</b> {{was known}} by a name, but no letters were dialed, {{it was common}} to {{capitalize}} only the first letter of the <b>central</b> <b>office,</b> e.g., Main 600W or Fairmont 33. Such numbers were assigned typically in manual <b>offices,</b> and the <b>name</b> would be spoken by a subscriber when requesting a destination. Often these were geographically significant names, such as the town's name.|$|R

5000|$|The {{concept of}} {{trunking}} (resource sharing) {{is actually quite}} old, and is taken from telephone company technology and practice. Consider two telco <b>central</b> <b>office</b> exchanges, one in town [...] "A" [...] {{and the other in}} adjacent town [...] "B". Each of these <b>central</b> <b>offices</b> has the theoretical capacity to handle ten thousand individual telephone numbers. (<b>Central</b> <b>office</b> [...] "A", with prefix [...] "123", has available 10,000 numbers from 123-0000 to 123-9999; <b>central</b> <b>office</b> [...] "B", with prefix [...] "124", the same.) ...|$|R

All the lending units borrow the funds from the <b>central</b> <b>office</b> at a particular rate and lend the same to the borrowers at a higher rate. The <b>central</b> <b>office</b> rate is notional in nature and is aligned to market conditions. Thus for all the units there are two rates available to measure the performance. For a deposit-raising unit the difference between interest paid to the deposit-holders and interest receivable from <b>central</b> <b>office</b> is the contribution to the bank's profitability. For a lending division the difference between Interest payable to <b>central</b> <b>office</b> and the interest received from the borrowers is the contribution to the bank's performance.|$|R

5000|$|To this end, {{the justice}} {{ministries}} of German states formed the <b>Central</b> <b>Office</b> of the State Justice Administrations for the Investigation of National Socialist Crimes in December 1958. Initially, {{the office was}} restricted to investigating crimes that occurred outside Germany and only those committed against civilians (distinct from those occurring during wartime operations). Subsequent changes in law and {{the statute of limitations}} have empowered the <b>Central</b> <b>Office</b> to investigate all war crimes without limitations in time or extent. The <b>Central</b> <b>Office</b> uses systematic research to investigate and assemble groups of connected crimes.

40|$|The current {{educational}} policy climate in the USA places immense pressure on school district <b>central</b> <b>offices</b> to use evidence to inform their decisions {{in order to}} improve student learning.
