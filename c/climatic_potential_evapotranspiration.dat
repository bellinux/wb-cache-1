40|$|The {{olive tree}} {{is one of}} the most {{characteristic}} rainfed trees in the Mediterranean region. Observed and forecasted climate modifications in this region, such as the CO 2 concentration and temperature increase and the net radiation, rainfall and wind speed decrease, will likely alter vegetation water stress and modify productivity. In order to simulate how climatic change could alter soil moisture dynamic, biomass growth and fruit productivity, a water-driven crop model has been used in this study. The numerical model, previously calibrated on an olive orchard located in Sicily (Italy) with a satisfactory reproduction of historical olive yield data, has been forced with future climate scenarios generated using a stochastic weather generator and a downscaling procedure of an ensemble of climate model outputs. The stochastic downscaling is carried out using simulations of some General Circulation Models adopted in the fourth Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) assessment report (4 AR) for future scenarios. The outcomes state that <b>climatic</b> forcings driving <b>potential</b> <b>evapotranspiration</b> compensate for each other, resulting in a slight increase of this water demand flux; moreover, the increase of CO 2 concentration leads to a potential assimilation increase and, consequently, to an overall productivity increase in spite of the growth of water stress due to the rainfall reduction...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2014 Douglas-fir (Psuedotsuga menziesii) {{spans the}} entire {{mountain}} {{system of the}} western United States, successfully occupying many different climatic and ecological niches. Its occupation of many different growth environments, and its temporal persistence on the landscape, make this species an ideal representative of forest-climate interactions in western mountain ecosystems. To quantify climate-growth relationships in Douglas-fir, I developed a comprehensive network of chronologies collected across the "climate space" of the species. By sampling throughout climate space at the continental scale, I account for {{a large percentage of}} variability in growing environments for Douglas-fir. Data are summarized across six regions - Pacific Northwest, Northern Rockies, Central Rockies, Southern Rockies, California, and Southwest. Tree growth data were combined with data from the Variable Infiltration Capacity Hydrologic Model, which includes typical climate variables as well as "plant relevant" variables. Climate data include precipitation, temperature, <b>potential</b> <b>evapotranspiration,</b> actual evapotranspiration, and vapor pressure deficit. Climatic water deficit was calculated as actual <b>evapotranspiration</b> minus <b>potential</b> <b>evapotranspiration.</b> The relationship between tree growth and climate was analyzed at four spatial scales (plot, watershed, region, and continent) and three temporal scales (monthly, interannual, interdecadal). Results suggest that variability in growth is tightly coupled to both interannual and decadal climatic variability, with evident linkages to the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO). Temperature exerts a top-down control on tree growth, regardless of the magnitude of precipitation. As air temperature increases, evaporative demand also increases, causing increased vapor pressure deficit and <b>climatic</b> water deficit (<b>potential</b> <b>evapotranspiration</b> minus actual evapotranspiration), altering the dynamics of water availability in forest ecosystems. Additional analyses focus on how large-scale climate teleconnections modify regional climate patterns that ultimately limit tree growth. Proximity to the dipole dictates the relative effect of ENSO events from region to region, and the strength and location of the dipole change when ENSO and PDO are in phase. ENSO- and PDO-related changes in regional climate result in increased variability and extremes in tree growth. Changes in tree growth occur in phase with ENSO across all regions, but the strongest response is at the extreme ends of the dipole. The complex relationship between tree growth and climate documented in this study can provide parameters for growth models, inform climate-change adaptation plans, and project future growth in Douglas-fir forests...|$|R

In this study, the objective is to project <b>potential</b> <b>evapotranspiration</b> in the future period 2011 - 2040 and understand their changes in Zhejiang Province, East China. The sensitivity of <b>potential</b> <b>evapotranspiration</b> to five <b>climatic</b> variables (solar radiation, daily minimum and maximum air temperature, relative humidity, and wind speed) is analyzed based on observation data from 1955 - 2008 using a global sensitivity analysis method, Sobol's method. The changes in <b>potential</b> <b>evapotranspiration</b> during the future period are generated using one regional climate model, Providing Regional Climates for Impacts Studies, with two global climate models, ECHAM 5 and Hadley Centre Coupled Model version 3, and their causes are analyzed based on sensitivity analysis results. Global sensitivity analysis results reveal substantial spatial-temporal variations in the sensitivity of <b>potential</b> <b>evapotranspiration</b> to <b>climatic</b> variables and unignorable interactions among climatic variables. Rather similar spatial change patterns of annual mean <b>potential</b> <b>evapotranspiration</b> (PET) are generated for both general circulation models; however, seasonal or monthly changes are very different due to different spatial-temporal changes in climatic variables. Different contributory sources to <b>potential</b> <b>evapotranspiration</b> changes are identified at different months and stations; the PET changes in 2011 - 2040 are mainly due to three climatic variables including solar radiation, relative humidity, and daily minimum temperature. © 2014.

New hydrological insights for the region: : The average annual runoff in the study watershed calculated by the SWAT, HBV, and BTOPMC models was 887, 834, and 865  mm, corresponding to 59 %, 55 %, and 57 % of the annual precipitation, respectively. The average annual evapotranspiration (ET) was 625, 623, and 718  mm, and the estimated yearly average total water storage (TWS) was 5, − 35, and 29  mm, respectively.
