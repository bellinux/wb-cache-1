From this evidence {{it is thought that}} the committee used the original Virginia Plan, the decisions of the Convention on modifications to that plan, and other sources, such as the Articles of Confederation, provisions of the state constitutions, and even Charles Pinckney's plan, to produce the first full draft, which author David O.

Jason Schreier of Wired described the land of Skyrim as a [...] "Viking-inspired treasure trove of flavor and charm", noting its contrast to Cyrodiil, which he considered generic by comparison. The Staff at Edge magazine described Cyrodiil as a [...] "patchwork of varying terrains", praising the more consistent design of Skyrim. Shibley praised [...] "the lack of <b>copy-and-paste</b> level design that's plagued Bethesda's previous games,... giving a lived-in and handcrafted look to the world". Bedford noted that the improved graphical fidelity over Oblivion allowed the game world to feel more lifelike, praising the [...] "misty mountain setting, complete with swirling fog and high-altitude snowstorms". An editor for PC PowerPlay praised {{the diversity of the}} dungeon design. Andrew Reiner of Game Informer cited criticisms that Oblivion faced for repetitive dungeons, noting that [...] "the composition of each dungeon is largely unique and individualized" [...] in Skyrim. He also favored the design choice to have a quick route out of a dungeon leading from its last room, eliminating a problem he identified Oblivion as having, where the player would clear a dungeon and then have {{to go all the way}} back to the beginning to exit it. Many reviewers praised the large amount of things to do in the world outside of the main story. Tom Francis of PC Gamer noted that it was difficult to explore the world without becoming distracted by things to do, stating that, [...] "it's hard to walk for a minute in any direction without encountering an intriguing cave, a lonely shack, some strange stones, a wandering traveller, [...] a haunted fort".|$|E

[...] IGN's review also stated that the game does not look as visually impressive as its predecessor, but it is still one of the best-looking games around because of its unique art style. In a round-table style video chat, IGN editors said that Rapture was less mysterious because players have seen it before, and that was a major strike against the game. Since the original had such an eerie mysterious feel to it, the twists and turns seen in the sequel seemed less surprising.|$|E

The only complaint {{is that at}} 9 tracks it feels a little light." [...] Slant Magazine's Sal Cinquenmani was more critical of Kelis' direction towards dance music, stating that the album [...] "sounds dated in {{the worst kind of}} way—that is, not enough to sound retro-cool, but enough to sound totally uncool. It helps that the album ... segued together with interludes that are more interesting than the actual songs. Flesh Tone should sound desperate, but it often sounds inspired instead. Kelis seems electrified by her new genre shift, and the result is an album that's one of her most consistent to date." [...] Kaya Burgess of The Times pointed out that 'Acapella' and 'Home' are the only tracks which [...] "stand out from an otherwise rather <b>copy-and-paste</b> collection of electronic numbers". Magaret Wappler of Los Angeles Times expressed that Kelis has managed to [...] "make a spirited but disciplined set of classic Euro-club bangers. Sometimes they're darkly contemplative, slipping into trance; other times they nearly rip at the seams ... it's clear that Kelis has carved out a new niche for herself, dancing in front of the turntables till the lights come on, if they dare." [...] Sam Richards of Uncut complimented its fusion of [...] "R sass to thumping club beats" [...] and stated [...] "most everything Kelis touches drips with class". Gavin Haynes of the NME felt that [...] "Flesh Tone has already filled out an application form for pop record of the year" [...] and stated, [...] "Her ability to appear unimpeachably cool hasn't wavered either.

Comparisons were instantly drawn to the similar Vs. Marvel and SNK series of games, and the gameplay of this newest fighter seemed to lack the finesse of previous games. Many series favorites such as Ken, Sagat and Morrigan were also relegated to background appearances or cameos in the endings, which did little to aid the game's popularity. The game also received criticism that certain moves that the characters originally had were not available to the player, which led to some backlash from fans of the games. The game enjoyed a brief period of competitive play in Japan, but was soon dropped from most major tournaments.|$|R

40|$|Application programing {{interfaces}} promote reuse by facilitating {{interaction between}} software components and/or software libraries. API code templates are parameterized API scenarios {{that can be}} quickly instantiated by <b>copy-and-pasting</b> or through support from integrated development environments. They provide the skeletal structure of an API coding scenario and let developers simply “fill in the blanks ” with {{the details of their}} coding task. Unfortunately, creating relevant API code templates requires time and experience with the API. To address these problems we present a technique that mines API usage patterns and transforms them into API code templates. Our intuition is that API usage patterns are a solid basis for code templates because they are grounded by actual API usage. We evaluate our approach performing retroactive study on the Mammoth, ArgoUML, and Eclipse projects to see if API code templates created from earlier versions could have been helpful to developers in later versions. Our results show that, on average, each API code template our technique mined could have helped developers with creating six, nine, and twelve new methods in Mammoth, ArgoUML, and Eclipse, respectively. In our evaluation, we mined many API code templates from the three test projects that provide evidence that ou...|$|R

A reader's comprehension is limited to what the author concludes, without exposure to the computational process. Often, the industrious reader cannot expand upon or validate the author's results.

40|$|This {{document}} is {{a demonstration of}} how the bytefield package can integrate seamlessly with hyperref. The text that follows was <b>copy-and-pasted</b> from RFC 1301, “Multicast Transport Protocol ” [AFM 92]. The important thing to note {{is the way the}} fields in the protocol diagrams (drawn with bytefield) are hyperlinked to their descriptions (with hyperref). Few typesetting systems enable authors to specify hyperlinks from within a figure to the surrounding text. Fewer still do not require hyperlinks to be re-specified when the figure changes. bytefield + hyperref can do both. 2 Protocol description MTP is a transport in that it is a client of the network layer (as defined by the OSI networking model). 1 MTP provides reliable delivery of client data between one or more communicating processes, as well as a predefined principal process. The collection of processes is called a web. In addition to transporting data reliably and efficiently, MTP provides the synchronization necessary for web members to agree on the order of receipt of all messages and can agree on the delivery of the message {{even in the face of}} partitions. This ordering and agreement protocol uses serialized tokens granted by the master to producers. The processes may have any one of three levels of capability. One member must be the master. The master instantiates and controls the behavior of the web, including its membership and performance. Non master members may be either producer/consumers or pure consumers. The former class of member is permitted to transmit user data to the entire membership (and expected to logically hear itself), while the latter is prohibited from transmitting user data. MTP is a negative acknowledgement protocol, exploiting the highly reliable delivery of the local area and wide area network technologies of today. Successful delivery of data is accepted by consuming stations silently rather than having the successful delivery noted to the producing process, thus reducing the amount of reverse traffic required to maintain synchronization...|$|R
