Furthermore, by taking (internal) cognitive states instead of stimuli as a source for emotional responses, it is shown how to model the way in which a person associates feelings to cognitive states. Moreover, it is shown how another person can obtain empathic understanding of a person by simulating the way in which feelings are associated to cognitive states. The obtained agent model describes how the empathic agent deals with another agent’s cognitive states and the associated feelings, thus not only understanding the other agent’s cognitive state {{but at the same time}} feeling the accompanying emotion of the other agent...|$|R
40|$|This study arose out <b>of</b> {{interested}} and <b>concerned</b> <b>observations</b> <b>of</b> {{social work and}} crisis pregnancy counselling and support staff attached to the antenatal and maternity departments of an Irish rural-based general hospital.

Discussions with colleagues {{in other areas of}} the antenatal and maternity services indicated particular issues, concerns and challenges arising in meeting the needs of women in such circumstances. This led to a research initiative, in partnership with the Crisis Pregnancy Agency, to gain a deeper understanding of concealed pregnancy.

40|$|Future {{generation}} of interferometric gravitational wave detectors is hoped to provide accurate {{measurements of the}} final stages of binary inspirals. The sources probed by such experiments are of extragalactic origin and the observed chirp mass is the intrinsic chirp mass multiplied by (1 + z) where z is the redshift of the source. Moreover the luminosity distance is a direct observable is such experiments. This creates the possibility to establish a new kind of cosmological tests, supplementary to more standard ones. Recent <b>observations</b> <b>of</b> distant type Ia supernovae light-curves suggest that {{the expansion of the universe}} has recently begun to accelerate. A popular explanation of present accelerating expansion of the universe is to assume that some part ΩQ of the matter-energy density is in the form of dark component called “the quintessence” with the equation of state pQ = wρQ with w ≥ − 1. In this paper we consider the predictions <b>concerning</b> <b>observations</b> <b>of</b> binary inspirals in future LIGO type interferometric experiments assuming a “quintessence cosmology”.

40|$|Abstract. The large {{horizontal}} solar telescope 50 / 35000 cm {{has been}} changed from Czerny-Turner type to a multicamera system recently. The change of the diffraction grating from Baush & Lomb to the Richardson one enabled to use up to 5 CCD high-speed cameras working simultaneously in diagnostically important spectral lines (Hα, Hβ, HeI D 3 and CaII H or K and CaIR 8542 Å). The Hα slit-jaw imaging system has been improved and another cameras operating in white light and for a full disk image taken in Hα were also implemented. The VDS Vosskuehler CCD cameras can sample several spectra and filtergrams per second in two modes (1280 x 1024 pxs, 12 bits, or 1280 x 512 pxs, 12 bits).

During this segment, the King Air flew just above the cloud base making <b>observations</b> <b>of</b> ice crystal size and shape, local meteorological variables, and infrared fluxes.

Information on cloud microphysics is also available from the King Air. Using this data in conjunction with atmospheric temperature and humidity profiles from local radiosondes, the necessary inputs for an infrared radiative transfer model can be developed. Infrared radiative transfer calculations are performed with a multispectral two-stream model.

However, the effectiveness of these resources is limited due to poor design or a lack of consideration of the ASD cognitive profile, particularly at the lower-functioning end of the spectrum.

The case study reported here evaluated two literacy educational {{computer programs}}, by observing five low-functioning children with ASD, compared to five neurotypical children (control cases).
