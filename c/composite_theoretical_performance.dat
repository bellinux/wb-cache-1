40|$|Abstract—This paper {{describes}} computationally efficient {{approaches and}} associated <b>theoretical</b> <b>performance</b> guarantees {{for the detection}} of known spectral targets and spectral anomalies from few incoherent projections. The proposed approaches accommodate targets of different signal strengths contaminated by a colored Gaussian background, and perform target detection without reconstructing the spectral input from the observations. The <b>theoretical</b> <b>performance</b> bounds of the target detector highlight fundamental tradeoffs among the number of measurements collected, amount of background signal present, signal-to-noise ratio, and similarity among potential targets in a known spectral dictionary. The anomaly detector is designed to control the number of false discoveries below a desired level and can be adapted to uncertainties in the user’s knowledge of the spectral dictionary. Unlike approaches based on the principles of compressed sensing, the proposed approach does not depend on a known sparse representation of targets; rather, the <b>theoretical</b> <b>performance</b> bounds exploit the structure of a known dictionary of targets and the Johnson–Lindenstrauss lemma.
