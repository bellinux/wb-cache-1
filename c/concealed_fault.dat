40|$|The main aim of {{this study}} is to use the {{transient}} electromagnetic (TEM) and magnetotelluric (MT) methods to determine the electrical resistivity distribution of the subsurface and locate possible structural features controlling groundwater distribution in the northern and south-eastern margins of Parnaiba basin, Brazil. MT data from 24 stations along two profiles across the margins of the basin have been processed using standard tensorial techniques to obtain the interpretable response functions. The TEM data recorded at the same sites facilitated the removal of static shift and the recovery of the near-surface structure. One-dimensional (1 -D) joint inversion of TEM and MT data yielded an approximate geoelectric structure for each profile. Subsequent two-dimensional (2 -D) modelling revealed a more realistic resistivity distribution for each profile. The result of 2 -D regularized inversion of MT data delineated the main sedimentary sequences and deep basement features. A resistive crystalline basement (â‰¥ 200 &OHgr;m) is overlain by relatively conductive sedimentary sequences of varying resistivities and thicknesses. The existence of a major basement trough at the expected position of a <b>concealed</b> <b>fault</b> in the north-eastern margin of the basin was proved by the MT model. This anomalous zone is interpreted to have a thick development of granular sediments and may be a good site for groundwater development. The 2 -D model for the south-eastern profile defined the position of a major fault, which is interpreted as Picos fault and may have implication for groundwater development. A graben-like structure is also suggested âˆ¼ 10 km further east from Picos fault and considered to be a good target for groundwater development. Overall, the 2 -D MT inversion results are consistent with the available geological information and offer new insights into the deep structure of the basin margins of Parnaiba basin. ...|$|E

40|$|Two {{earthquakes}} (M_L= 4. 6 and M_L= 5. 2) {{occurred at}} {{almost the same}} location in Upland, southern California, in June 1988 and February 1990 and had similar strike-slip focal mechanisms with left-lateral motion on a northeast striking plane. The focal mechanisms and aftershock locations showed that the causative fault was the San Jose fault, an 18 -km-long <b>concealed</b> <b>fault</b> that splays west-southwest from the frontal fault of the central Transverse Ranges. Left-lateral strike-slip faults adjacent to the frontal faults may {{play an important role}} in the deformation of the Transverse Ranges and the Los Angeles basin as suggested by these Upland earthquakes, the left-lateral strike-slip 1988 (M_L= 4. 9) Pasadena earthquake on the Raymond fault, 30 km to the west of Upland, and scattered background seismicity along other active left-lateral faults. These faults may transfer slip away from part of the frontal fault toward the south. Alternatively, these faults could represent secondary faulting related to the termination of the northwest striking right-lateral strike-slip faults to the south of the range front. The 1988 and 1990 Upland earthquakes ruptured abutting or possibly overlapping segments of the San Jose fault. The edges of the overlapping aftershock zones, which are sharply defined, together with background seismicity, outline a 14 -km-long aseismic segment of the San Jose fault. The 1988 mainshock originated at 9. 5 km depth and caused aftershocks between 5 and 12 km. In contrast, the 1990 mainshock focus occurred at the top of its aftershock zone, at 5 km, and caused aftershocks down to 13 km depth. These deep aftershocks tapered off within 2 weeks. The rate of occurrence of aftershocks in magnitude-time space was the same for both sequences. The state of stress reflected in the focal mechanisms of the aftershocks is identical to that determined from background activity and did not change with time during the aftershock sequence. The constant stress state suggests that the 1988 and 1990 events did not completely release all the stored slip on that segment of the fault. The presence of 14 km of unbroken fault, the abrupt temporal termination of deep aftershocks, and the constant stress state all suggest that a future moderate-sized earthquake (M_L= 6. 0 – 6. 5) on the San Jose fault is possible with a rupture length of at least 14 km and possibly 18 km...|$|E
40|$|Bulk rock {{strength}} is greatly dependent on fracture density, so that reductions in rock strength associated with faulting and fracturing should be reflected by reduced shear coupling and hence S-wave velocity. This study {{is carried out}} along the Canterbury rangefront and in Otago. Both lie within the broader plate boundary deformation zone in the South Island of New Zealand. Therefore built structures are often,, located in areas where there are undetected or poorly defined faults with associated rock strength reduction. Where structures are sited near to, or across, such faults or fault-zones, they may sustain both shaking and ground deformation damage during an earthquake. Within this zone, management of seismic hazards needs {{to be based on}} accurate identification of the potential fault damage zone including the likely width of off-plane deformation. Lateral S-wave velocity variability provides one method of imaging and locating damage zones and off-plane deformation. This research demonstrates the utility of Multi-Channel Analysis of Surface Waves (MASW) to aid land-use planning in such fault-prone settings. Fundamentally, MASW uses surface wave dispersive characteristics to model a near surface profile of S-wave velocity variability as a proxy for bulk rock strength. The technique can aid fault-zone planning not only by locating and defining the extent of fault-zones, but also by defining within-zone variability that is readily correlated with measurable rock properties applicable to both foundation design and the distribution of surface deformation. The calibration sites presented here have well defined field relationships and known fault-zone exposure close to potential MASW survey sites. They were selected to represent a range of progressively softer lithologies from intact and fractured Torlesse Group basement hard rock (Dalethorpe) through softer Tertiary cover sediments (Boby’s Creek) and Quaternary gravels. This facilitated initial calibration of fracture intensity at a high-velocity-contrast site followed by exploration of the limits of shear zone resolution at lower velocity contrasts. Site models were constructed in AutoCAD in order to demonstrate spatial correlations between S-wave velocity and fault zone features. Site geology was incorporated in the models, along with geomorphology, river profiles, scanline locations and crosshole velocity measurement locations. Spatial data were recorded using a total-station survey. The interpreted MASW survey results are presented as two dimensional snapshot cross-sections of the three dimensional calibration-site models. These show strong correlations between MASW survey velocities and site geology, geomorphology, fluvial profiles and geotechnical parameters and observations. Correlations are particularly pronounced where high velocity contrasts exist, whilst weaker correlations are demonstrated in softer lithologies. Geomorphic correlations suggest that off-plane deformation can be imaged and interpreted in the presence of suitable topographic survey data. A promising new approach to in situ and laboratory soft-rock material and mass characterisation is also presented using a Ramset nail gun. Geotechnical investigations typically involve outcrop and laboratory scale determination of rock mass and material properties such as fracture density and unconfined compressive strength (UCS). This multi-scale approach is espoused by this study, with geotechnical and S-wave velocity data presented at multiple scales, from survey scale sonic velocity measurements, through outcrop scale scanline and crosshole sonic velocity measurements to laboratory scale property determination and sonic velocity measurements. S-wave velocities invariably increased with decreasing scale. These scaling relationships and strategies for dealing with them are investigated and presented. Finally, the MASW technique is applied to a <b>concealed</b> <b>fault</b> on the Taieri Ridge in Macraes Flat, Central Otago. Here, high velocity Otago Schist is faulted against low velocity sheared Tertiary and Quaternary sediments. This site highlights the structural sensitivity of the technique by apparently constraining the location of the principal fault, which had been ambiguous after standard processing of the seismic reflection data. Processing of the Taieri Ridge dataset has further led to the proposal of a novel surface wave imaging technique termed Swept Frequency Imaging (SFI). This inchoate technique apparently images the detailed structure of the fault-zone, and is in agreement with the conventionally-determined fault location and an existing partial trench. Overall, the results are promising and are expected to be supported by further trenching in the near future...|$|E
30|$|The {{aforementioned}} facts {{suggest that}} the HFD distribution in the basin might be controlled by both basement topography, i.e., through heat refraction (e.g., Beardsmore 2005; Thakur et al. 2012; Rawling et al. 2013) due to the basement-to-sedimentary fill thermal conductivity contrast {{and the presence of}} heat transfer by moving groundwater (Kilty and Chapman 1980) which may recharge or discharge along the basin’s bounding faults (Ehlers and Chapman 1999), or both. However, there are also high HFD values that are not directly located in the vicinity of faults nor are they situated over a shallow basement, i.e., wells CLU- 5, SNT- 1, and PCT- 1 (northern Pasirputih Sub-basin, east, and southeast of Pamanukan High, respectively), though Suryantini (2007) interpreted based on gravity studies that several <b>concealed</b> <b>faults</b> possibly exist beneath areas around SNT- 1. Moreover, there are not any anomalously high or low heat flow densities in Pamanukan High region where most data are situated near major faults. We will examine this matter of complication in the following sections by the use of numerical modeling of conductive heat transfer in the basin. The modeled temperature field allows for the conductive component of the HFD values to be recovered (Cacace et al. 2013), which in turn enables a subsequent comparison to be made with the observed heat flow values.|$|R

40|$|Since 1920 {{fourteen}} moderate-sized (M_L = 4. 9 – 6. 4) earthquakes {{have been}} reported in the Los Angeles basin. These events are associated with both mappable surficial <b>faults</b> and <b>concealed</b> <b>faults</b> beneath the basin sediments. To determine the style of faulting and state of stress in the basin, single-event focal mechanisms for 244 earthquakes of M ≥ 2. 5 that have occurred during 1977 – 1989 have been calculated. Fifty-nine percent of the events are strike-slip and are mostly located near two of the major, northwest striking right-lateral strike-slip faults in the basin, the Newport-Inglewood fault and the Palos Verdes fault. The 1988 Pasadena and the 1988 Upland earthquakes showed left-lateral strike-slip on northeast striking faults. Numerous small earthquakes in the eastern part of the basin show left-lateral strike-slip faulting and form a northeast trend near Yorba Linda. Thirty-two percent of the events have reverse mechanisms and are distributed along two broad zones. The first, the Elysian Park fold and thrust belt, coincides with anticlines along the eastern and northern flank of the Los Angeles basin extending into Santa Monica Bay. The second, the Torrance-Wilmington fold and thrust belt, coincides with anticlines mapped on the southwest flank of the basin and extends from offshore Newport Beach to the northwest into Santa Monica Bay. Oblique faulting that could be inferred by the merging of strike-slip and compressional tectonics does not occur in the basin. Instead, the coexistence of zones of thrusting and large strike-slip faults in the basin suggests that the thrust and strike-slip movements are mostly decoupled. A few normal faulting mechanisms appear to be related to faulting orthogonal to the axes of plunging anticlines. The trend of the maximum horizontal stress varies from N 1 °W to N 31 °E across the basin and consistently forms high angles with the fold axes. The stress field that exists along the flanks of the basin has a vertical minimum stress axis. This stress field and ongoing folding and thrusting suggest that tectonic deformation is concentrated along the flanks of the deep central basin. Today the deformation of the basin consists of uplift and crustal thickening and lateral block movement to accommodate the north-south compression across the basin...|$|R

40|$|The M_w 6. 7 Northridge {{earthquake}} {{occurred on}} January 17, 1994, beneath the San Fernando Valley. Two seismicity clusters, located 25 km {{to the south}} and 35 km to the north-northwest, preceded the mainshock by 7 days and 16 hours, respectively. The mainshock hypocenter was relatively deep, at 19 km depth in the lower crust. It had a thrust faulting focal mechanism with a rake of 100 ° on a fault plane dipping 35 ° to the south-southwest and striking N 75 °W. Because the mainshock did not rupture the surface, its association with surficial geological features remains difficult to resolve. Nonetheless, its occurrence reemphasized the seismic hazard of <b>concealed</b> <b>faults</b> associated with the contractional deformation of the Transverse Ranges. The Northridge earthquake is part of the temporal increase in earthquake activity in the Los Angeles area since 1970. The mainshock was followed by an energetic aftershock sequence. Eight aftershocks of M ≥ 5. 0 and 48 aftershocks of 4 ≤ M ≤ 5 occurred between January 17 and September 30, 1994. The aftershocks extend over most of the western San Fernando Valley and Santa Susana Mountains. They form a diffuse spatial distribution around the mainshock rupture plane, illuminating a previously unmapped thrust ramp, extending from 7 – 10 km depth into the lower crust to a depth of 23 km. No flattening of the aftershock distribution is observed near its bottom. At shallow depths, above 7 – 10 km, the thrust ramp is topped by a dense distribution of aftershock hypocenters bounded by some of the surficial faults. The dip of the ramp increases from east to west. The west side of the aftershock zoae is characterized by a dense, steeply dipping, and north-northeast striking planar cluster of aftershocks that exhibited mostly thrust faulting. These events coincided with the Gillibrand Canyon lateral ramp. Along {{the east side of the}} aftershock zone the aftershocks also exhibited primarily thrust faulting focal mechanisms. The focal mechanisms of the aftershocks were dominated by thrust faulting in the large aftershocks, with some strike-slip and normal faulting in the smaller aftershocks. The 1971 San Fernando and the 1994 Northridge earthquakes ruptured partially abutting fault surfaces on opposite sides of a ridge. Both earthquakes accommodated north-south contractional deformation of the Transverse Ranges. The two earthquakes differ primarily in the dip direction of the faults and the depth of faulting.

Across the Severn Estuary, between South Wales and the Bristol-Mendips region, {{there is a significant}} offset of isopachs and facies belts in both the Courceyan-Chadian and Arundian sequences. It is suggested that these result from intra-Carboniferous dextral strike-slip along a major fault zone underlying the Severn Estuary (the Severn Estuary Fault Zone), and that the Vale of Glamorgan Axis was a synthetic structure, developed in conjunction with this strike-slip movement. By inference, the Severn Estuary Fault Zone shares a common history with the Vale of Glamorgan Axis, extending back to the Devonian and possibly earlier. Late Dinantian (Holkerian) facies distribution reflects uplift and emergence on the north-south Usk Anticline and Malvern Lineament.

In an instant the beast was round and you may imagine what my feelings were, being in charge of your fair kinswoman, for I thought to a certainty that we should be over. What is more, it quite spoilt my chance of the race, for after he has shied like that, the black turns sulky, and won't let himself go." ...|$|R

I have taken your reports as you have offered them, without any inquiry, because I had no doubt, that a great {{majority}} of this school would be honest, at all hazards. They would not, I am confident, make a false report, even if, by a true one, they were to bring upon themselves punishment; so that I think I may have confidence that nearly all these reports have been faithful. Still, it is very probable, that, among so large a number, some may have made a report, which, they are now aware, was not perfectly fair and honest. I {{do not wish to}} know who they are; if there are any such cases, I only wish to say to the rest, how much pleasanter it is for you that you have been honest and open. The business is now all ended; you have done your duty; and though you reported a little larger number than you would, if you had been disposed to conceal, yet you go away from school with a quiet conscience. On the other hand, how miserable must any boy feel, if he has any nobleness of mind whatever, to go away from school, to-day, thinking that he has not been honest; that he has been trying to <b>conceal</b> his <b>faults,</b> and thus to obtain a credit which he did not justly deserve. Always be honest, let the consequence be what it may." ...|$|R
40|$|The Santa Cruz {{porphyry}} Cu-(Mo) system near Casa Grande, Arizona, {{includes the}} Sacaton mine deposits {{and at least}} five other <b>concealed,</b> mineralized <b>fault</b> blocks with an estimated minimum resource of 1. 5 Gt @ 0. 6 % Cu. The Late Cretaceous-Paleocene system has been dismembered and rotated by Tertiary extension, partially eroded, and covered by Tertiary-Quaternary basin-fill deposits. The mine and mineralized fault blocks, which form an 11 km (~ 7 miles) by 1. 6 km (~ 1 mile) NE-SW–trending alignment, represent either pieces of one large deposit, several deposits, or pieces of several deposits. The southwestern part of the known system is penetrated by three or more diatremes that consist of heterolithic breccia pipes with basalt and clastic matrices, and subannular tuff ring and maar-fill sedimentary deposits associated with vents. The tephra and maar-fill deposits, which are covered by ~ 485 to 910 m (~ 1, 600 – 3, 000 ft) of basin fill, lie on a mid-Tertiary erosion surface of Middle Proterozoic granite and Late Cretaceous porphyry, which compose most xenoliths in pipes and are the host rocks of the system. Some igneous xenoliths in the pipes contain bornite-chalcopyrite-covellite assemblages with hypogene grades> 1 wt % Cu, 0. 01 ounces per ton (oz/t) Au, 0. 5 oz/t Ag, and small amounts of Mo (< 0. 01 wt %). These xenoliths were derived from mineralized rocks {{that have not been}} encountered in drill holes, and attest to additional, possibly higher-grade deposits within or subjacent to the known system...|$|R
40|$|Abstract The {{basement}} rocks, Neogene sediments and Quaternary {{alluvial deposits}} in the Abu Dabbab area, Eastern Desert of Egypt, are deformed by N-S, NE-SW, NW-SE and E-W trending faults. Complex cross-cutting relationships show a complicated history of initiation and reactivation of these faults. The recent fault scarps demonstrate different morphologies, modes of formation and relative ages. Recurrent, step and successively reactivated faulting was likely {{responsible for the}} exhumation and neo-formation of the fault scarps. Capture, deep incision, offset and reversal in flow direction of streams are the main drainage modifications induced by active <b>faults.</b> The <b>concealed</b> and active <b>faults</b> are associated with high drainage density anomalies. Segmentation phenomenon is common for all fault trends. Microearthquakes are concentrated at the intersection zones of faults and caused by upper crustal strike-slip, oblique-slip, reverse and normal faults. The paleostresses are {{not consistent with the}} present-day stress fields. The present-day NE-SW extension across the Red Sea combined with a local multidirectional tension led to reactivation of old faults and initiation of new fault trends...|$|R

It comes with sickness, it comes with sorrow, it comes {{with the loss of}} the dearly loved, {{it is one of the}} most frequent uses of adversity. It came to Clennam in his adversity, strongly and tenderly. 'When I first gathered myself together,' he thought, 'and set something like purpose before my jaded eyes, whom had I before me, toiling on, for a good object's sake, without encouragement, without notice, against ignoble obstacles that would have turned an army of received heroes and heroines? One weak girl! When I tried to conquer my misplaced love, and to be generous to the man who was more fortunate than I, though he should never know it or repay me with a gracious word, in whom had I watched patience, self-denial, self-subdual, charitable construction, the noblest generosity of the affections? In the same poor girl! If I, a man, with a man's advantages and means and energies, had slighted the whisper in my heart, that if my father had erred, it was my first duty to <b>conceal</b> the <b>fault</b> and to repair it, what youthful figure with tender feet going almost bare on the damp ground, with spare hands ever working, with its slight shape but half protected from the sharp weather, would have stood before me to put me to shame? Little Dorrit's.' So always as he sat alone in the faded chair, thinking. Always, Little Dorrit. Until it seemed to him as if he met the reward of having wandered away from her, and suffered anything to pass between him and his remembrance of her virtues.|$|R
5000|$|Thus, only in 1944 did the US Navy {{begin to}} use its 150 {{submarines}} to maximum effect: installing effective shipboard radar, replacing commanders deemed lacking in aggression, and fixing the faults in the torpedoes. Japanese commerce protection was [...] "shiftless beyond description," [...] and convoys were poorly organized and defended compared to Allied ones, a product of flawed IJN doctrine and training - errors <b>concealed</b> by American <b>faults</b> as much as Japanese overconfidence. The number of American submarines patrols (and sinkings) rose steeply: 350 patrols (180 ships sunk) in 1942, 350 (335) in 1943, and 520 (603) in 1944. By 1945, sinkings of Japanese vessels had decreased because so few targets dared to venture out on the high seas. In all, Allied submarines destroyed 1,200 merchant ships - about five million tons of shipping. Most were small cargo carriers, but 124 were tankers bringing desperately needed oil from the East Indies. Another 320 were passenger ships and troop transports. At critical stages of the Guadalcanal, Saipan, and Leyte campaigns, thousands of Japanese troops were killed or diverted from where they were needed. Over 200 warships were sunk, ranging from many auxiliaries and destroyers to one battleship and no fewer than eight carriers.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: In {{software}} development processes, reviews are typically conducted to remove faults be-fore requirements or designs are {{passed to the}} subsequent phase. However, {{in spite of the}} strin-gent review procedures, the process is still porous and significant numbers of <b>faults</b> <b>conceals.</b> This paper presents a novel strategy for reducing faults by assuring quality of the in-process implemen-tations, dubbed abstract prototyping. It extends the current practices by defining the steps of the design phase of the processes of development of engineering design software tools. Under this procedure, reviews are performed to remove faults before theories, methods, algorithms, or pilot prototypes are passed to the subsequent stage rather than exclusively reviewing the requirements or designs. Prototypes provide the feel and the look of these in-process implementations and spe-cially designed metrics help the developers estimate {{the extent to which they}} fulfill their respective requirements. Case studies show that the levels of fulfillment of requirements can adequately be estimated and faults detected early on. 1. INRODUCTION Quality is defined as the degree of excellence of something [1]. This implies that any software project can be found lacking if measured against an unclear notion of what quality is [2]. Various testing strategies can be used to determine whether software satisfy its specification, and it is recognized, for example, in [3] that each technique provides varying amount of assurance. It is universally understood that quality of software products, including those used in engineering design [variously known as Compute...|$|R
