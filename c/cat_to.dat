5|$|Ripley, Lambert, and Parker {{agree to}} self-destruct the Nostromo and escape in the shuttle. Parker and Lambert {{are killed by}} the alien while {{gathering}} life-support supplies. Ripley initiates the self-destruct sequence and heads with the <b>cat</b> <b>to</b> the shuttle to find the alien in her path. She retreats and attempts unsuccessfully to abort the self-destruct. She returns to the shuttle, where the alien is gone, and she narrowly escapes in the shuttle as the Nostromo explodes.|$|E
5|$|Nelson's love {{interest}} is Destiny (Canis selfabsorbedb*tchicus), an Afghan hound. However, Destiny {{has no interest}} in Nelson. She is the pet dog of Gary (Tony Way), the landlord of The Lord Nelson. However, like the other humans that appear in the series, he cannot understand what Destiny or what the other animals are saying. Elsewhere there is Marion (Felis retardicus), an idiotic <b>cat</b> <b>to</b> whom Nelson acts as a father-figure. Marion has been abandoned by several owners and is very corruptible. Then there is Kali (Aves aggravaticus), a pigeon who likes to revel in the misfortune of others. She has several grudges, including a hatred of all humans and foxes for the way they treat birds. Lastly, there is Vince, Nelson's older brother (Vulpus c***itcus), a violent, foul-mouthed fox who considers himself a proper animal. Almost all his lines contain at least one swear word that is always bleeped over.|$|E
5|$|Tallstar's Revenge was {{released}} on 2 July 2013. It {{tells the story of}} Tallstar, whose father dies when he is an apprentice during a tunnel collapse. As a result, he attempts to avenge his father Sandgorse's death by killing the cat (a rogue named Sparrow) whom he believes did not help his father escape the tunnel and is therefore responsible. Tallstar leaves his Clan to track down Sparrow and briefly travels with a house cat named Jake, who is later revealed to be the father of Firestar (the main protagonist of the original six books). When he meets up with Sparrow, Tallstar discovers that his father actually sacrificed himself to allow the other <b>cat</b> <b>to</b> escape and does not carry through with his intended vengeance, instead saving Sparrow's life when Sparrow slides down a cliff and near a road.|$|E
25|$|Cat senses are adaptations {{that allow}} <b>cats</b> <b>to</b> be highly {{efficient}} predators. Cats have acute sight, hearing and smell, and {{their sense of}} touch is enhanced by long whiskers that protrude from their heads and bodies. These senses allow <b>cats</b> <b>to</b> hunt effectively in dim light and at night.|$|R

5|$|The most {{important}} role in the Clan is that of the leader. The Clan leader overlooks all duties of Clan life, and will make all the important decisions, such as whether or not to engage in battle. Each Clan leader is given nine lives by StarClan, in order to sacrifice their lives nine times over to protect their Clan, and to serve their clans for many more moons to come. This means that Clan leaders can often live longer than that of a normal <b>cat.</b> <b>To</b> mark their new status, Clan leaders are given the suffix –star (e.g. Bluestar, Tallstar, and Brokenstar). Generally, Clan leaders sleep alone, although male leaders are allowed to take a mate. Female leaders are inhibited from taking a mate or having kits, which has led to discussions of sexism among many fans of the series.|$|E

25|$|Cats {{with food}} allergies {{constantly}} itch their red, hairless, and scabby skin. Hair loss usually occurs {{on the face}} and/or anus.

25|$|In NetHack, one of {{the monsters}} {{encountered}} in this roguelike game is called 'Quantum Mechanic', which often carries a chest. The chest either contains a cat corpse, or causes a <b>cat</b> <b>to</b> appear. Reading the source code to the game also reveals that the game does not determine {{the state of the}} cat until the chest is opened.|$|E
25|$|There is no vaccine. Prevention {{requires}} isolating {{those who}} are infected and decreasing contact with the rats. Efforts include having a <b>cat</b> <b>to</b> hunt vermin, and storing food in sealed containers. Treatment is directed at addressing dehydration and improving symptoms. The antiviral medication, ribavirin may be useful when given early. These measures improve outcomes.|$|E

25|$|Cats can be {{selective}} eaters. Although it {{is extremely}} rare for a <b>cat</b> <b>to</b> deliberately starve itself {{to the point of}} injury, in obese cats, the sudden loss of weight can cause a fatal condition called Feline Hepatic Lipidosis, a liver dysfunction which causes pathological loss of appetite and reinforces the starvation, which can lead to death within as little as 48 hours.|$|E
25|$|The {{structure}} of the brain region (barrel cortex) which receives information from the vibrissae {{is similar to that}} found in the visual cortex which permits the <b>cat</b> <b>to</b> create a three-dimensional map of its surroundings. This doesn't mean that sensing with vibrissae is a type of vision. It is still a touch sensation and environmental information is built up incrementally (in small steps).|$|E
25|$|Humans {{also often}} seek to mimic animals' {{communicative}} signals {{in order to}} interact with them. For example, cats have a mild affiliative response of slowly closing their eyes; humans often mimic this signal towards a pet <b>cat</b> <b>to</b> establish a tolerant relationship. Stroking, petting and rubbing pet animals are all actions that probably work through their natural patterns of interspecific communication.|$|E

25|$|Cats {{have been}} venerated in the Near East since antiquity, a {{tradition}} adopted by Islam, albeit {{in a much}} modified form. According to many hadiths, Mohammad prohibited the persecution and killing of cats.

25|$|In {{the former}} Soviet Union, wildcats were usually caught accidentally in traps set for martens. In modern times, they {{are caught in}} unbaited traps on {{pathways}} or at abandoned fox, badger, hare or pheasant trails. One method of catching wildcats consists of using a modified muskrat trap with a spring placed in a concealed pit. A scent trail of pheasant viscera leads the <b>cat</b> <b>to</b> the pit. A wildcat caught in a trap growls and snorts.|$|E
25|$|Trim was the ship's cat on {{a number}} of the ships under the command of Matthew Flinders during voyages to {{circumnavigate}} and map the coastline of Australia during 1801–03.

A statue to Trim was later erected in his honour, and he {{has been the subject of}} a number of works of literature. A statue sits on a window sill on the outside of the State Library, in Sydney, Australia.|$|E
