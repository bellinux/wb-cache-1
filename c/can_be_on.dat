5|$|Reports {{of damage}} to the {{hypoglossal}} nerve are rare. The most common causes of injury in one case series were compression by tumours and gunshot wounds. A wide variety of other causes can lead to damage of the nerve. These include surgical damage, medullary stroke, multiple slcerosis, Guillain-Barre syndrome, infection, sarcoidosis, and presence of an ectatic vessel in the hypoglossal canal. Damage <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>on</b> one or both sides, which will affect symptoms that the damage causes. Because of the close proximity of the nerve to other structures including nerves, arteries, and veins, it is rare for the nerve to be damaged in isolation. For example, damage {{to the left and}} right hypoglossal nerves may occur with damage to the facial and trigeminal nerves as a result of damage from a clot following arteriosclerosis of the vertebrobasilar artery. Such a stroke may result in tight oral musculature, and difficulty speaking, eating and chewing.|$|E
5|$|On October 25, 2011, the HDMI Forum was {{established}} by the HDMI founders to create an open organization so that interested companies can participate {{in the development of}} the HDMI specification. All members of the HDMI Forum have equal voting rights, may participate in the Technical Working Group, and if elected <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>on</b> the Board of Directors. There is no limit to the number of companies allowed in the HDMI Forum though companies must pay an annual fee of US$15,000 with an additional annual fee of $5,000 for those companies who serve on the Board of Directors. The Board of Directors will be made up of 11 companies who are elected every 2 years by a general vote of HDMI Forum members. All future development of the HDMI specification will take place in the HDMI Forum and will be built upon the HDMI 1.4b specification. Also on the same day HDMI Licensing, LLC announced that there were over 1,100 HDMI adopters and that over 2 billion HDMI-enabled products had shipped since the launch of the HDMI standard. From October 25, 2011, all development of the HDMI specification became the responsibility of the newly created HDMI Forum.|$|E

25|$|Layer {{stack of}} the PCB is decided, with one {{to tens of}} layers {{depending}} on complexity. Ground and power planes are decided. A power plane is the counterpart to a ground plane and behaves as an AC signal ground while providing DC power to the circuits mounted on the PCB. Signal interconnections are traced on signal planes. Signal planes <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>on</b> the outer as well as inner layers. For optimal EMI performance high frequency signals are routed in internal layers between power or ground planes.|$|E
25|$|Saturation of {{the sample}} with energy applied at the {{resonant}} radiofrequency. This manifests in both CW and pulsed NMR; {{in the first case}} (CW) this happens by using too much continuous power that keeps the upper spin levels completely populated; in the second case (pulsed), each pulse (that is at least a 90° pulse) leaves the sample saturated, and four to five times the (longitudinal) relaxation time (5T1) must pass before the next pulse or pulse sequence can be applied. For single pulse experiments, shorter RF pulses that tip the magnetization by less than 90° can be used, which loses some intensity of the signal, but allows for shorter recycle delays. The optimum there is called an Ernst angle, after the Nobel laureate. Especially in solid state NMR, or in samples with very few nuclei with spins greater than zero, (diamond with the natural 1% of carbon-13 is especially troublesome here) the longitudinal relaxation times <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>on</b> the range of hours, while for proton-NMR they are more on the range of one second.|$|E
25|$|A {{kneeling}} chair adds {{an additional}} body part, the knees, {{to support the}} weight of the body. A sit-stand chair distributes most of {{the weight of the}} occupant to the feet. Many chairs are padded or have cushions. Padding <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>on</b> the seat of the chair only, on the seat and back, or also on any arm rests or foot rest the chair may have. Padding will not shift the weight to different parts of the body (unless the chair is so soft that the shape is altered). However, padding does distribute the weight by increasing the area of contact between the chair and the body. A hard wood chair feels hard because the contact point between the occupant and the chair is small. The same body weight over a smaller area means greater pressure on that area. Spreading the area reduces the pressure at any given point. In lieu of padding, flexible materials, such as wicker, may be used instead with similar effects of distributing the weight. Since most of the body weight is supported {{in the back of the}} seat, padding there should be firmer than the front of the seat which only has the weight of the legs to support. Chairs that have padding that is the same density front and back will feel soft in the back area and hard to the underside of the knees.|$|E
