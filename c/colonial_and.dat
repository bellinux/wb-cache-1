5|$|Mackinac Island also {{contains}} examples of Federalist, <b>Colonial,</b> <b>and</b> Greek Revival styles.

Few of the old customs have been preserved, but some forms of traditional music, arts and crafts, and fishing are still practised.|$|E

5|$|Despite strong pacifist {{sentiment}} after World War I, {{its aftermath}} still caused irredentist and revanchist nationalism in several European states. These sentiments were especially marked in Germany {{because of the}} significant territorial, <b>colonial,</b> <b>and</b> financial losses incurred by the Treaty of Versailles. Under the treaty, Germany lost around 13 per cent of its home territory {{and all of its}} overseas possessions, while German annexation of other states was prohibited, reparations were imposed, and limits were placed on the size and capability of the country's armed forces.|$|E
5|$|In January 1950, a fire {{broke out}} that {{destroyed}} over 2,500 huts, home to nearly 3,500 families and 17,000 total people. The disaster highlighted the need for proper fire prevention in the largely wooden-built squatter areas, complicated {{by the lack of}} political ties with the <b>colonial</b> <b>and</b> Chinese governments. The ruins gave new arrivals to the Walled City the opportunity to build anew, causing speculation that the fire may have been intentionally set.|$|E
5|$|Many {{anthozoans}} are <b>colonial</b> <b>and</b> {{consist of}} multiple polyps {{with a common}} origin joined together by living material. The simplest arrangement is where a stolon runs along the substrate in a two dimensional lattice with polyps budding off at intervals. Alternatively, polyps may bud off from a sheet of living tissue, the coenosarc, which joins the polyps and anchors the colony to the substrate. The coenosarc may consist of a thin membrane from which the polyps project, as in most stony corals, or a thick fleshy mass in which the polyps are immersed apart from their oral discs, as in the soft corals.|$|E

5|$|Most seabirds are <b>colonial,</b> <b>and</b> {{the reasons}} for colonial {{behaviour}} {{are assumed to be}} similar, if incompletely understood by scientists. Procellariids for the most part have weak legs and are unable to easily take off, making them highly vulnerable to mammalian predators. Most procellariid colonies are located on islands that have historically been free of mammals; for this reason some species cannot help but be colonial as they are limited to a few locations to breed. Even species that breed on continental Antarctica, such as the Antarctic petrel, are forced by habitat preference (snow-free north-facing rock) to breed in just a few locations.|$|E
5|$|Ninety-five {{percent of}} seabirds are <b>colonial,</b> <b>and</b> seabird colonies {{are among the}} largest bird colonies in the world, {{providing}} one of Earth's great wildlife spectacles. Colonies of over a million birds have been recorded, both in the tropics (such as Kiritimati in the Pacific) and in the polar latitudes (as in Antarctica). Seabird colonies occur exclusively {{for the purpose of}} breeding; non-breeding birds will only collect together outside the breeding season in areas where prey species are densely aggregated.|$|E
5|$|Of {{eukaryotic}} groups, the protists {{are most}} commonly unicellular and microscopic. This {{is a highly}} diverse group of organisms that {{are not easy to}} classify. Several algae species are multicellular protists, and slime molds have unique life cycles that involve switching between unicellular, <b>colonial,</b> <b>and</b> multicellular forms. The number of species of protists is unknown since only a small proportion has been identified. Protist diversity is high in oceans, deep sea-vents, river sediment and an acidic river, suggesting that many eukaryotic microbial communities may yet be discovered.|$|E

5|$|Washington's {{election}} as a {{delegate to the}} Second Continental Congress created a vacancy in Fairfax County's delegation to the third Virginia Convention, and he wrote from Philadelphia in May 1775, urging that it be filled. By this time, blood had been shed between <b>colonial</b> <b>and</b> Briton at the Battles of Lexington and Concord. Mason attempted to avoid election {{on the grounds of}} poor health and that he was needed to parent his motherless children. Nevertheless, he was elected and journeyed to Richmond, which, being further inland than Williamsburg, was deemed better protected from possible British attack.|$|E
5|$|Design work on Kaiserin Augusta {{began in}} 1887; {{budgetary}} restrictions forced the German Navy {{to design a}} ship that could serve in both <b>colonial</b> <b>and</b> fleet scout roles. During the design process, it was determined a three-shaft arrangement of the machinery {{would be necessary to}} attain the high speed requirement. This resulted in the first warship of the German Navy to use three screws. This was a relatively novel development; at the time of Kaiserin Augustas construction, only a handful of French and American ships had experimented with the arrangement, and had not yet been to sea for a thorough evaluation of the design. Kaiserin Augusta was laid down at the Germaniawerft shipyard in Kiel in 1890. She was launched on 15 January 1892 and commissioned into the fleet {{less than a year later}} on 17 November 1892.|$|E
5|$|During the <b>colonial</b> <b>and</b> Republican periods, {{agriculture}} {{was promoted}} by the government. Many Chilean haciendas (estates) were successful during this time, including the Pichileminian Hacienda San Antonio de Petrel. Part of the land where San Antonio de Petrel was created was given by the Captaincy General of Chile to Bartolomé de Rojas y Puebla in 1611, who later acquired more lands {{in order to establish}} it. San Antonio de Petrel produced leather, jerky, soles, tallow, and cordovan, as well as other products which would later be exported to Peru, or sold in Santiago and Valparaíso. San Antonio de Petrel was bordered by properties of Lauriano Gaete and Ninfa Vargas, and Pedro Pavez Polanco.|$|E

5|$|Fremantle Prison {{comprises}} substantially intact convict era structures, {{including the}} limestone perimeter walls of exceptional heritage significance. Other structures, {{dating from the}} time the precinct was in use as a <b>colonial</b> <b>and</b> state prison, are also significant. The convict era complex includes the 1859 main cell block, chapel and wards, yards and refractory cells; perimeter walls, gate house complex and prison officer residences on the Terrace; service buildings and hospital; south-eastern workshops; ramp access tramway (Fairbairn Street) and Henderson Street Warder's Cottages. Other elements which contribute to the site's overall heritage significance include the western workshops (1900); new division (1907); and conversion of service building to the female division and the addition of an eastern range (1889–1909).|$|E
5|$|In 1968 Franco-Caribbean writer Aimé Césaire {{published}} Une Tempête, {{a radical}} {{adaptation of the}} play based on its <b>colonial</b> <b>and</b> postcolonial interpretations, in which Caliban is a black rebel and Ariel is mixed-race. The figure of Caliban influenced numerous works of African literature in the 1970s, including pieces by Taban Lo Liyong in Uganda, Lemuel Johnson in Sierra Leone, Ngũgĩ wa Thiong'o in Kenya, and David Wallace of Zambia's Do You Love Me, Master?. A similar phenomenon occurred in late 20th-century Canada, where several writers produced works inspired by Miranda, including The Diviners by Margaret Laurence, Prospero's Daughter by Constance Beresford-Howe and The Measure of Miranda by Sarah Murphy. Other writers have feminised Ariel (as in Marina Warner's novel Indigo) or Caliban (as in Suniti Namjoshi's sequence of poems Snapshots of Caliban).|$|E
5|$|New Jersey was {{governed by}} {{two groups of}} proprietors as two {{distinct}} provinces, East Jersey and West Jersey, between 1674 and 1702. New Jersey's first counties were created as administrative districts within each province, with East Jersey split in 1675 into Bergen, Essex, Middlesex and Monmouth counties, while West Jersey's initial counties of Burlington and Salem date to 1681. The most recent county created in New Jersey is Union County, created in 1857 and named after the union of the United States when the Civil War was imminent. New Jersey's county names derive from several sources, though most of its counties are named after place names in England and prominent leaders in the <b>colonial</b> <b>and</b> revolutionary periods. Bergen County is the most populous county—as of the 2010 Census—with 905,116 people, while Salem County is the least populous with 66,083 people.|$|E
