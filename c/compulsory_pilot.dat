The canal can accommodate vessels up to 215 meters long with a draft of up to 8 meters with a <b>compulsory</b> <b>pilot</b> assistance.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article is neither to exhaustively review the legis- lative history of the Act, 7 nor to comment on the various {{amendments}} draw criticism and corrections which have been put forth. Instead, this article focuses on one small problem contained in one discrete section of the Act. The provision which forms the basis of this article is § 1605 (b),s and the prob- lem that will be discussed is the rule announced in that section which prohibits the arrest of a vessel owned by a foreign sovereign. Because much has been written about the arrest provisions of the FSIA, 9 this article will approach the section from a perspective not previously dis- cussed: torts committed while the vessel is under the command of a <b>compulsory</b> <b>pilot...</b>|$|E
40|$|A new team-based {{teaching}} approach {{known as}} the Process-Oriented Guided Inquiry Learning (POGIL) has been introduced into an organic chemistry course taught for first Year medical students. This is an innovative teaching style whereby students are transformed from being passive into active learners aiding to improve their both content related and higher-order process skills, including critical thinking, reflection, teamwork, etc. The implementation of POGIL as a change project was done using the HSE change model and it {{was carried out in}} two phases: a <b>pilot,</b> <b>compulsory</b> post-lecture phase followed by a voluntary, full-programme pre-lecture phase. The assessment of students’ performance in continuous assessments, process skills and perceptions have shown some positive results as the majority of students who committed to the voluntary phase have reported an overall satisfaction with the new way of teaching, showed positive signs of critical thinking improvement, produced good quality reflections and achieved satisfactory scores in their tests. On the contrary, the responses from those who have chosen not to participate in the voluntary programme or withdrawn from it have shownthat they were either resistant to the change strategy, not the change itself, or they were still stuck {{in the early stages of}} shock, denial, etc. of reaction to change. Overall, these findings, coupled with the encouraging responses from the instructors, suggest that POGIL could achieve more promising results if a longer term, modified setting is implemented...|$|R
