50|$|The microscopes on {{the limb}} are then read off, {{and thus the}} {{apparent}} zenith distance of the collimating point, intersection of the wires, is found. The collimator is then transferred to the other (south) side of the circle, and a corresponding observation made without reversing the circle, but merely by {{the motion of the}} telescope on the limb. The difference of the two zenith distances so read off is double the error of the zenith or horizontal point of the graduation, and their semi-sum is the true zenith distance of the collimating point, or the co-inclination of the axis of the <b>collimating</b> <b>telescope</b> to the horizon.|$|E
40|$|The {{spatial and}} {{temporal}} characteristics of X-ray microbursts detected by <b>collimated</b> directional <b>telescopes</b> have been analyzed in detail. Results indicate {{the presence of a}} persistent periodicity of about 0. 5 second and 1. 2 seconds, respectively. In one event, microbursts exhibit fine structures similar to those observed by Lampton (1967). These substructures are poorly correlated in both space and time as indicated by the low correlation coefficients obtained in auto- and cross-correlation analyses between various pairs of telescopes. The source dimension of these substructures is deduced to be less than 18 km at ionospheric heights. By considering that microburst electrons are near regions of strong diffusion, we show that microburst precipitation can be generated if electric field turbulence is present in the magnetosphere. We argue that electrons of about 50 keV in bounce resonance with a parallel electric field of about 1 millivolt/meter at about 1 Hz can account for the microburst period as well as the precipitation lifetime of about 0. 2 second...|$|R
40|$|Since {{the launch}} of the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) the {{secondary}} mirror of the telescope has been moved several times in order to <b>collimate</b> the <b>telescope</b> and also to define a position of best focus. In addition to these moves the focus position changes over time because of water desorption by the graphite epoxy in the metering truss. The authors report here the focus history of the telescope based on a knowledge of the mirror moves made and an analysis of desorption monitoring data obtained by the Faint Object Camera (FOC) in the F/ 96 mode and of the routine calibration data obtained by the Wide Field and Planetary Cameras. Focus values are extracted using two different methods. In the first method the distance between the center of the point spread function (PSF) and the shadows of the pads supporting the HST primary mirror are related to the focus error. In the second method an analytical formula for the PSF with variable aberration coefficients is fitted to the data. Focus positions derived from the two methods show good agreement. The data show that a desorption of about 83 microns has taken place since Aug. 16, 1990. The desorption has clearly not leveled off as expected from the trend of the earlier data. Long term variations of the secondary mirror position of approximately 3 - 15 microns from the 'best' focus position have been observed. Variations of the order of 2 - 5 microns over an orbital period have also been noted. Focus changes resulting from secondary mirror movements greater than approximately 5 microns changes the point spread function significantly and makes deconvolution and quantitative measurements difficult...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. We derive {{formulae}} for all parameters dening the eld astigmatism of misaligned two mirror telescopes with arbitrary geometries {{and with}} stop positions any-where {{on the line}} connecting the vertices of the two mir-rors. The formulae show explicitly the dependence of the eld astigmatism on the fundamental design parameters and characteristics of the telescope and on the stop posi-tion. Special attention {{is given to the}} particular case where such a schiefspiegler has been corrected for coma at the eld center. In addition, we study the eects of the prac-tical denition that the center of the eld is the center of the adapter. Following a recent paper by McLeod, where the eld dependence of astigmatism is used to <b>collimate</b> a Ritchey-Chretien <b>telescope</b> with the stop at the primary mirror, we apply our formulae to the Cassegrain focus of the ESO Very Large Telescope (VLT), where the stop is at the secondary mirror and the telescope is only corrected for spherical aberration. We present measurements of the eld astigmatism and discuss the accuracy of the collima-tion method. Key words: telescopes 1...|$|R
