5|$|The {{battle between}} Sydney and Kormoran {{is seen as}} controversial: the disbelief that a {{modified}} merchant ship <b>could</b> <b>so</b> successfully defeat a cruiser combined {{with the lack of}} Australian survivors led some to believe that the German account was false. Rumours that the battle was not what it seemed had been around since Sydney failed to reach Fremantle on schedule in 1941, but several historians (including Tom Frame and Wesley Olson) credit Michael Montgomery and his 1980 book Who Sank The Sydney? with igniting the controversy.|$|E
5|$|The Bengals {{entered the}} NFL in 1970 {{as a result}} of the AFL–NFL merger, and were placed in the newly formed American Football Conference {{alongside}} the Browns. A career-ending injury to Cook before the 1970 season forced the Bengals to rely on Virgil Carter, an emergency backup who could make accurate short passes but could not heave the ball like Cook once <b>could.</b> <b>So</b> Brown and Walsh went to work designing an offense around Carter's limitations, a scheme that was the genesis of the West Coast offense Walsh later used to great effect when he became coach of the San Francisco 49ers.|$|E

25|$|It is on {{this basis}} that Thoreau <b>could</b> <b>so</b> {{strongly}} inveigh against British and Catholic power in A Yankee in Canada. Despotic authority had crushed the people’s sense of ingenuity and enterprise; the Canadian habitants had been reduced, in his view, to a perpetual childlike state. Ignoring the recent Rebellions, he argued {{that there would be}} no revolution in the St. Lawrence River valley.|$|E
25|$|In spring 1918, {{the tide}} was turned against the Ottomans when British forces {{were able to take}} control of some key points on the railway along the Yarmouk River, and cut off the Haifa {{extension}} {{from the rest of the}} Hejaz railway. When defeated in September 1918, the Turks quickly destroyed any railway infrastructure and rolling stock they <b>could,</b> <b>so</b> that it would not fall into British hands. By the end of the war, the British controlled all of the Jezreel Valley railway.|$|E

Questions of procedural safeguards loom large {{in the wake of}} an order such as the one before us. Among them are: (a) whether Congress can close the mails to obscenity by any means other than prosecution of its sender; (b) whether Congress, if it can authorize exclusion of mail, can provide that obscenity be determined in the first instance in any forum except a court, and (c) whether, even if Congress <b>could</b> <b>so</b> authorize administrative censorship, it has in fact conferred upon postal authorities any power to exclude matter from the mails upon their determination of its obscene character.|$|E

25|$|Among many {{memorial}} concerts nationwide, {{a memorial}} performance of The Dream of Gerontius was {{given at the}} Royal Albert Hall, at which John Coates and Frederick Ranalow sang with the Royal Choral Society. The Musicians' Benevolent Fund was first established as the Gervase Elwes Memorial Fund for Musicians, and his figure became a presiding genius of twentieth-century English music. His particular association with the lyrics of A. E. Housman and the music of Elgar, and his death soon after the First World War, reinforce his embodiment of the lost Edwardian generation, perhaps the last in which his religious conviction <b>could</b> <b>so</b> thoroughly have endeared him to so many. At much {{the same time the}} Glasgow Orpheus Choir instituted a Gervase Elwes Silver Medal, and the Feis Ceoil in Dublin inaugurated its Gervase Elwes Memorial Cup. A choir named after him was established at Walsall. A portrait plaque by Arthur Vokes was set up in the centre of the village of Billing.|$|E
25|$|Görgei {{planned to}} {{attack in the}} next day to advance with the III. corps towards Galánta via Vágsellye, while the II. corps protects its side by moving towards Alsószeli and Deáki. But already in the night of 20 June he learned that the enemy troops {{commanded}} by Wohlgemuth will attack, and the Panyutyin-division was also sent to help the IV. and the II. corps. So he understood that the relative balance of forces between the two armies (20,000 Hungarians with 80 cannons against 25,000 Austrians with 96 cannons) was about to be upset by the arrival of 12,000 Russians. So Görgei ordered Klapka to hold with any costs the bridge from Aszódpuszta, and József Nagysándor to force the crossing, with his troops, of the Vág river at Szered. The II. and III. corps had to wait the Austro-Russian attack and to repel it. The key of the Hungarian success was the arrival in time of the I. corps of Nagysándor, after accomplishing his initial tasks, to help the other two corps. Görgei believed that if Nagysándor's I. corps would make a successful attack, pushing the enemy back and cross the Vág river at Sempte, this would enable the counterattack of the II. and III. Hungarian corps, and the enemy instead of concentrating to capture the bridges from Aszódpuszta and Negyed to cut the retreat root of the Hungarians, will have to fight against the Hungarian attack from front, which with the help of Nagysándor's arriving troops, can threaten to encircle the main Austro-Russian troops north from Pered. So the only choice of Wohlgemuth would be the retreat, which would lead to the accomplishment of the Hungarian plans and to the victory. Görgei found also useful that his troops {{in the next day}} had to fight with Russian troops too, because they <b>could</b> <b>so</b> measure the tsarists real battle value.|$|E
500|$|According to Curtis Stone at Geekenstein, {{the artwork}} was [...] "vibrant and meticulous" [...] and story was [...] "exceptional", {{and along with}} its {{execution}} and character development, he felt that Dareka no Manazahshi was [...] "utterly enrapturing" [...] despite its shortness. [...] Stone was most impressed by how people <b>could</b> <b>so</b> easily relate to the characters emotionally, despite the film's brevity. [...] His only minor criticism was that the ending left open tantalizing questions about the family's future, though he noted that this did not detract from the film's message. UKAniFest called the short film [...] "heartstringy" [...] and characterized {{it as one of}} those hard-to-find [...] "little gems".|$|E

500|$|Changes in the {{approach}} and storytelling of the show {{in the second and}} subsequent seasons led to more positive critical reception and made it a media favorite. Entertainment Weekly stated, [...] "The best new show of the year took a few weeks to grow on me, but now it's a full-blown addiction." [...] The Los Angeles Times called Walter Bishop one of the best characters of 2008, noting, [...] "the role of the modern-day mad scientist <b>could</b> <b>so</b> easily have been a disaster, but the 'Fringe' writers and the masterful John Noble have conspired to create a character that seems, as trite as it sounds, more Shakespearean than sci-fi." ...|$|E
500|$|I quaked {{a little}} as we began our quartet 'A Right-down Regular Royal Queen.' [...] But [...] numbers seemed to amuse the real Queen more than {{anything}} else in the opera, and, indeed, who <b>could</b> <b>so</b> well as she see the point of them? [...] The very fact of her choosing this opera from all the others to be played before her shows how vivid was her sense of fun, and how truly British was her willingness to laugh at herself. [...] There was... only one encore... nd who do you suppose was singled out for that honour? Who but I who write this, little Jessie Bond... for my song in the first act, 'When a Merry Maiden Marries.' ...|$|E

[...] Morton highlighted how unlikely it was that Canning <b>could</b> <b>so</b> profoundly fool her supporters and countered the prosecution's complaint about Canning's description of the loft. [...] The third attorney, George Nares, concentrated on the societal problems of prosecuting Canning for perjury, implying that other victims of crime {{would be less likely}} to pursue their assailants, for fear of being prosecuted themselves.|$|E

500|$|French cavalry {{had similar}} {{problems}} with horses on the Western Front as the British, although {{the treatment of}} their horses created additional difficulties. [...] Opinion generally was that the French were poor horsemen: [...] "The French cavalryman of 1914 sat on his horse beautifully, but was no horsemaster. It did not occur to him to get off his horse's back whenever he <b>could,</b> <b>so</b> {{there were thousands of}} animals with sore backs...". One French general, Jean-François Sordet, was accused of not letting horses have access to water in hot weather. By late August 1914, a sixth of the horses in the French cavalry were unusable. [...] The French continued to eschew mounted warfare when in a June 1918 charge by French lancers the horses were left behind and the men charged on foot.|$|E
500|$|This {{aspect of}} the {{basement}} recordings became obvious when Dylan chose to record his next album, John Wesley Harding, in Nashville in late 1967. The songs on that record, according to Howard Sounes, revealed the influence of Dylan's daily reading of both the Bible and the Hank Williams songbook. And its sound {{came as a shock}} to other rock musicians. As producer Bob Johnston recalled, [...] "Every artist in the world was in the studio trying to make the biggest-sounding record they possibly <b>could.</b> <b>So</b> what does [...] do? He comes to Nashville and tells me he wants to record with a bass, drum and guitar." [...] Dylan summed up the gap: [...] "At that time psychedelic rock was overtaking the universe and we were singing these homespun ballads." ...|$|E

500|$|III [...] Nero's {{decision}} to allow Halotus to live and keep his job may {{have been influenced by}} a variety of factors. The most important of these factors was that the execution of Halotus, or indeed anyone else closely involved, for the murder of Claudius, may have put the plot to secure Nero's seat of power at risk, when Halotus was so close to Claudius, and <b>could</b> <b>so</b> easily have worked with Agrippina and others to poison the late Emperor. It would have made Halotus, as chief steward and taster, look like an accomplice or a witness to the or in the collaboration to poison Claudius, and all those involved would have preferred to keep the matter quiet than to arouse public suspicion in the new administration, and the way that the new administration had come into force.|$|E
500|$|The A.V. Club writer Leonard Pierce said [...] "94 Meetings" [...] was a {{particularly}} strong episode that focused equally on the show's premise and developing the relationships between characters. He particularly praised Susan Yeagley, but said Tom Haverford was underused, and felt the scenes between Ann and Mark were lacking. New York magazine writer Steve Kandell {{said it was a}} fast-paced and funny episode, calling the jokes about the complaining residents [...] "rapid-fire scenes". Kandell criticized Mark, who he said has been resorted to boring [...] "straight-man services", and said he did not mind that Paul Schneider was leaving the series. Kona Gallagher of TV Squad appreciated that the episode reintroduced the fact that Leslie once was in love with Mark, and criticized the show for ignoring that fact all season. Gallagher also criticized the fact that a historic building <b>could</b> <b>so</b> easily be damaged and demolished, which he called unrealistic.|$|E
500|$|The initial {{idea for}} the DVD came to percussionist Shawn Crahan, {{three weeks before the}} band entered The Mansion in 2003, where they would work on their third studio album [...] Crahan {{received}} help from the band's record label Roadrunner, who supplied them with tapes, camera cleaning equipment and funds to hire people to operate the cameras when Crahan himself couldn't. Recording began when Slipknot entered The Mansion and continued until they had finished touring in 2005, reportedly covering 28 months of the bands time together. Crahan's intentions were to capture as many different Slipknot situations as he <b>could,</b> <b>so</b> when the opportunity to produce a DVD came, he would {{be in a position to}} begin work immediately. During the period in which the footage was being shot, Crahan began making little tests of the footage and revealed them to his fellow band mates, judging their reactions to help him establish areas of interest from them. The whole recording process produced over 300 60-minute tapes of footage.|$|E
