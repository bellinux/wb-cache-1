30|$|The {{values of}} ϖ shown in Figs.  7 and 8 clearly {{establish}} {{the superiority of}} <b>clamped</b> <b>plates</b> {{when compared to the}} simply supported ones for different aspect ratios and for any particular number of stiffeners considered here with two different orientations (i.e., along y- and both x- and y-directions). For such <b>clamped</b> <b>plates,</b> the preference of the aspect ratio is 1.0, 1.5 and 2.0 for higher enhancement of fundamental frequency. It is evident from the above figures that for the same aspect ratio, the value of ϖ in case of simply supported boundary conditions is much less than that of the same number of stiffeners placed on the <b>clamped</b> <b>plates.</b> Hence, the <b>clamped</b> <b>plates</b> are preferred over the simply supported plates with/without placing any number of stiffeners with any type of orientation. Comparing the aspect ratios, it is observed that the square plates with aspect ratio 1 are more efficient than the rectangular plates having aspect ratios 1.5 and 2.0. Hence, the non-dimensional fundamental frequencies (ϖ) decrease with the increase in aspect ratios.|$|E

Based on Trefftz 2 ̆ 7 s initial stress theory, the energy functional is obtained {{from which the}} governing differential equation for equilibrium can be derived via calculus of variations. Exact and simple approximate closed-form critical- load expressions are obtained after solving the two-point boundary value problem. The effect of the nonlinear terms involving in-plane displacements in the Green-Lagrange strain expressions on the solutions is also investigated. For circular plates with relatively large thickness-to-radius ratios, the allowance for prebuckling deformation affects the critical load of <b>clamped</b> <b>plates</b> more than simply supported plates. This occurs because the prebuckling deformation is greater in <b>clamped</b> <b>plates,</b> since they undergo higher loads before buckling...|$|E

40|$|A new {{formulation}} for the non-dimensional dynamic {{influence function}} method, which {{was developed by}} the authors, is proposed to efficiently extract eigenvalues and mode shapes of <b>clamped</b> <b>plates</b> with arbitrary shapes. Compared with the finite element and boundary element methods, the non-dimensional dynamic influence function method yields highly accurate solutions in eigenvalue analysis problems of plates and membranes including acoustic cavities. However, the non-dimensional dynamic influence function method requires the uneconomic procedure of calculating the singularity of a system matrix in the frequency range of interest for extracting eigenvalues because it produces a non-algebraic eigenvalue problem. This article describes a new approach that reduces the problem of free vibrations of <b>clamped</b> <b>plates</b> to an algebraic eigenvalue problem, the solution of which is straightforward.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{influence}} of weld rotation stiffness on the global bifurcation buckling strength of laser-welded web-core sandwich plates. The study is carried out using two methods, {{the first is the}} equivalent single-layer theory approach solved analytically for simply supported plates and numerically for <b>clamped</b> <b>plates.</b> First-order shear deformation theory is used. The second method is the three-dimensional model of a sandwich plate solved with finite element method. Both approaches consider the weld through its rotation stiffness. The weld rotation stiffness affects the transverse shear stiffness. Plates are loaded in the web plate direction. Four different cross-sections are considered. Weld stiffness is taken from experimental results presented in the literature. The results show a maximum of 24 % decrease in buckling strength. The strength was affected more in plates with high reduction of transverse shear stiffness and high bending stiffness. Furthermore, <b>clamped</b> <b>plates</b> were influenced more than simply supported. The intersection between buckling modes shifted towards higher aspect ratios, in the maximum case by 24 %.

40|$|Abstract. In this paper, we {{investigate}} universal inequalities for eigenvalues of a <b>clamped</b> <b>plate</b> problem on a bounded domain in an n-dimensional hyper-bolic space. It {{is well known}} that, for a bounded domain in the n-dimensional Euclidean space, Payne, Pólya and Weinberger (1955), Hook (1990) and Chen and Qian (1990) studied universal inequalities for eigenvalues of the <b>clamped</b> <b>plate</b> problem. Recently, Cheng and Yang (2006) have derived the Yang-type universal inequality for eigenvalues of the <b>clamped</b> <b>plate</b> problem on a bounded domain in the n-dimensional Euclidean space, which is sharper than the other ones. For a domain in a unit sphere, Wang and Xia (2007) have also given a universal inequality for eigenvalues. For a bounded domain in the n-dimensional hyperbolic space, although many mathematicians want to obtain a universal inequality for eigenvalues of the <b>clamped</b> <b>plate</b> problem, there are no results on universal inequalities for eigenvalues. The main reason that one could not derive a universal inequality is that one cannot find appropriate trial functions. In this paper, by constructing “nice ” trial functions, we obtain a universal inequality for eigenvalues of the <b>clamped</b> <b>plate</b> problem on a bounded domain in the hyperbolic space. Furthermore, we can prove that if the first eigenvalue of the <b>clamped</b> <b>plate</b> problem tends to (n− 1) 4 16 when the domain tends to the hyperbolic space, then all of the eigenvalues tend t...|$|R

The {{effectiveness}} of four different carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) hybridized methods to retrofit the high strength concrete columns with shear capacity deficiency {{for improving the}} shear behavior is described in this paper.

40|$|The figure {{depicts a}} {{miniature}} cantilever-type anemometer {{that has been}} developed as a prototype of compact, relatively nonintrusive anemometers that can function at temperatures up to 600 C {{and that can be}} expected to be commercially mass-producible at low cost. The design of this anemometer, and especially the packaging aspect of the design, is intended to enable measurement of turbulence in the high-temperature, high-vibration environment of a turbine engine or in any similar environment. The main structural components of the anemometer include a single-crystal SiC cantilever and two polycrystalline SiC <b>clamping</b> <b>plates,</b> all made from chemical-vapor-deposited silicon carbide. Fabrication of these components from the same basic material eliminates thermal-expansion mismatch, which has introduced spurious thermomechanical stresses in cantilever-type anemometers of prior design. The <b>clamping</b> <b>plates</b> are heavily oxidized to improve electrical insulation at high temperature. A cavity that serves as a receptacle for the clamped end of the cantilever is etched into one end of one <b>clamping</b> <b>plate.</b> Trenches that collectively constitute a socket for a multipin electrical plug (for connection to external electronic circuitry) are etched into the opposite end of this <b>clamping</b> <b>plate.</b> Metal strips for electrical contact are deposited on one face of the other <b>clamping</b> <b>plate.</b> Piezoresistive single-crystal SiC thin-film strain gauges are etched in the n-type SiC epilayer in a Wheatstone-bridge configuration. Metal contact pads on the cantilever that extend into the clamping-receptacle area, are obtained by deposition and patterning using standard semiconductor photolithography and etching methods. The cantilever and the two <b>clamping</b> <b>plates</b> are assembled into a sandwich structure that is then clamped in a stainless-steel housing. The Wheatstone- bridge carrying SiC cantilever with the metal contact pads on the piezoresistors is slid into the receptacle in the bottom <b>clamping</b> <b>plate.</b> The top <b>clamping</b> <b>plate</b> is brought into contact with the bottom plate so that the narrow section of the metal strips on the top <b>clamp</b> <b>plate</b> aligns with the metal contact pads on the cantilever. When the parts are clamped together, the metal strips provide electrical connections between the Wheatstone-bridge contact points and the sides the trenches that constitute the socket for the multipin electrical plug. Hence, to connect the Wheatstone bridge to external circuitry for processing of the anemometer readout, one need only insert the plug in the socket. In operation, the cantilever end of the stainless-steel housing is mounted flush with an engine wall and the unclamped portion of the cantilever is exposed into the flow. The cantilever is deflected in direct proportion to the force induced by component of flow parallel to the engine wall and perpendicular to the broad exposed face of the cantilever. The maximum strain on the cantilever occurs at the clamped edge and is measured by the piezoresistors, which are located there. The corresponding changes in resistance manifest themselves in the output of the Wheatstone bridge...|$|R
