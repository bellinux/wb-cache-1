40|$|Although certain {{characteristics}} of duricrusts display a strong resemblance to <b>clastic</b> <b>sedimentary</b> rocks, {{in terms of}} lithology, {{they cannot be classified}} as rock. These ambiguities on classification may lead to several problems associated with excavation of duricrusts, particularly with regard to method used and rate of payment. In an attempt to draw some guidelines in evaluating the degree of excavatability of duricrusts, this paper highlights some of the fundamental differences and similarities between duricrusts and <b>clastic</b> <b>sedimentary</b> rocks. Laboratory and field data show that, in terms of texture and strength, duricrusts exhibit strong similarities to <b>clastic</b> <b>sedimentary</b> rocks. However, the origin of duricrusts does not fulfill the criteria for classification as rock. As such, for certain geologic materials, lithologic classification alone may not be sufficient to reflect their excavatability. Further verification on the material properties is also an essential aspect to be considered. ...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT—Twenty-four nearly {{complete}} carapace {{samples were collected}} at three different localities of the Maastrichtian (Late Cretaceous) Cardenas Formation in San Luis Potosi, east-central Mexico. The material has been assigned to five families: the Callianassidae, Dakoticancridae, Carcineretidae,?Majidae, and Retroplumidae. Two genera of callianassid shrimp are described, Cheramus {{for the first time}} in the fossil record. Dakoticancer australis Rathbun is reported as the most abundant crustacean element; one new genus and species of carcineretid crab, Branchiocarcinus cornatus, is erected, and a single, fragmentary specimen is questionably referred to the Majidae. The three localities reflect paleoenvironmental differences, exhibited by different lithologies, within marginal marine, lagoon environments. The record of dakoticancrid crabs in the Cardenas Formation extends the paleobio-geographic range of the family and the genus Dakoticancer. Carcineretid crabs, although not abundant, seem to have been a persistent element of crustacean assemblages in clastic environments during the Late Cretaceous of the ancestral Gulf Coast of Mexico.

25|$|<b>Clastic</b> <b>sedimentary</b> rocks, are {{subdivided}} {{according to}} the dominant particle size. Most geologists use the Udden-Wentworth grain size scale and divide unconsolidated sediment into three fractions: gravel (>2mm diameter), sand (1/16 to 2mm diameter), and mud (clay is <1/256nbsp&mm and silt is between 1/16 and 1/256nbsp&mm). The classification of <b>clastic</b> <b>sedimentary</b> rocks parallels this scheme; conglomerates and breccias are made mostly of gravel, sandstones are made mostly of sand, and mudrocks are made mostly of the finest material. This tripartite subdivision is mirrored by the broad categories of rudites, arenites, and lutites, respectively, in older literature.|$|R

40|$|The current view {{regarding}} {{the timing of}} regionally developed penetrative tectonic fabrics in sedimentary rocks is that their development postdates lithification of those rocks.

Despite these high levels of shortening there is a marked absence of the domainal cleavage structure and intraclast deformation that are expected with this level of deformation.
