Therefore, the superiority of using nanoparticles and ultrasound mutually over using them separately on water solidification depends on whether the nucleating effect of foreign nanoparticles can compensate for the weakened effect of <b>cavitation</b> <b>bubbles.</b> Our experiment results show that in the positive zone (R 4 [*]<[*] 1), the combined effect of nanoparticles and ultrasound is stronger than their respective effects but do not exceed the addition of these respective effects.

A suspension consisting of distilled water and microbubbles (Sonazoid ultrasound contrast agent containing C 4 F 10 gas) was used as a test liquid in the present experiment. It was found that microbubbles were rapidly destroyed after the ultrasound irradiation and their survival numbers were reduced by half at the exposure time of 100 ms.

This seems important because the flow induced by this surface oscillation {{as well as by the}} acoustic radiation pressure can provide a higher possibility to convey the second products everywhere in the liquid. Consequently <b>cavitation</b> <b>bubbles</b> can be generated at a relatively long time after the ultrasound irradiation even though the majority of microbubbles are destroyed during an earlier period.
