The Effect of Mathematics with Jigsaw type of Cooperative Model and Computer-Aided Direct Instruction Viewed {{from the}} Students’ Learning Motivation, Thesis, Study Program of Mathematics Education Postgraduate Program of Sebelas Maret University Surakarta, 2009. The {{objectives}} of research are: (1) tofind out which one giving a better learning achievement, between the learning using jigsaw type of cooperative model {{or the one}} using <b>computer-aided</b> direct <b>instruction,</b> (2) {{to find out which}} one giving a better achievement between the students with high, medium and low motivation, (3) to find out which one giving a better achievement between the use of jigsaw type of cooperative learning model and the <b>computer-aided</b> direct <b>instruction</b> for the students with high, medium and low motivation. The research method employed was the experimental one. The research was taken place in all Junior High Schools of Regency Sragen in the school year of 2008 / 2009. The sample of research was obtained using the stratified cluster random sampling technique, so that 247 students were obtained as the respondents. The data was collected using documentation, questionnaire and test techniques. Technique of analyzing data employed was a two-way variance analysis with different cell with the normality and homogeneity assumption test, followed by a multiple comparative test. From the result of research, it can be concluded that: (1) there is a difference of students’ learning achievement in the subject matter of calculating the triangle’s and rectangle’s circumference and width as well as using it in solving the problem between the students following the lesson with jigsaw type of cooperative learning model and the ones following the lesson with <b>computer-aided</b> direct <b>instruction</b> learning. The means learning achievement of students following the lesson with jigsaw type of cooperative learning model is better than that of students following the lesson with <b>computer-aided</b> direct <b>instruction</b> learning, (2) there is a difference of learning achievement between the students groups with high, medium and low motivation. The learning achievement of students with high motivation is better than that of students with medium and low motivation, and (3) the learning achievement of students taught using jigsaw type of cooperative learning model and high motivation is better than that of students taught with <b>computer-aided</b> direct <b>instruction</b> learning and high motivation. Similarly, the learning achievement of students with medium and low motivation taught using jigsaw type of cooperative learning model is better than that of students taught with computer-aided direct instructio...|$|R

40|$|If {{sophisticated}} {{natural language}} systems are {{to handle the}} full range of communication, then they must be able to account for the nuances and subtleties of linguistic style. A computational treatment of style would be highly advantageous to natural language understanding and generation, with particular relevance to intelligent computer-assisted language instruction and machine translation. These systems would be able to understand more complex and expressive language, produce text suitable for a specific occasion, help a second-language learner develop a more natural and appropriate style, and produce higher quality translations of text. A foundation for AI-based computational style has been laid by DiMarco, with extensions by Green, Makuta-Giluk, Mah, and Payette in generation, rhetoric, comparative stylistics, and intelligent <b>computer-aided</b> language <b>instruction,</b> respectively.

This paper describes the goals of the VILTS system, the speech corpus, and the algorithm development. The automatic grading system uses SRI's Decipher^TM continuous speech recognition system [1] to generate phonetic segmentations that are used to produce pronunciation scores at the end of each lesson. The scores produced by the system are similar to those of expert human listeners. Unlike previous approaches in which models were built for specific sentences or phrases, we present a new family of algorithms designed to perform well even when knowledge of the exact text to be used is not available. 1.

50|$|<b>Computer-aided</b> <b>instruction</b> gained {{widespread}} {{acceptance in}} schools {{by the early}} 1980s. It was during this period that drilling and practice programs were first developed for exclusive classroom use. Schools became divided over which computer manufacturers {{they were willing to}} support, with grade schools generally using Apple computers and high schools preferring DOS based machines. Hardware shortages in schools became a major issue, leaving many teachers unable to provide enough computers for students to use. Despite this, by 1989 computer usage shifted from being a relative rarity in American public schools, to being present in nearly every school district.|$|E
