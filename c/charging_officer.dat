50|$|It does {{underline}} the city police’s {{role as a}} dual law and order and fire-fighting organization, with Frank Richardson being in charge of both organizations. Like many Chief Constables, Richardson often acted a prosecutor at the magistrates' court, {{so he could be}} out fighting fires during the night and prosecuting in court the following day. A Report by the Chief Constable was published by the Magistrates Clerk from the Hereford Watch Committee on 2 September 1898 which went into great detail concerning the Licensing of premises in Hereford. The Annual Police Return for 1899 was presented by the Magistrates Clerk from the Hereford Watch Committee who read the contents as supplied by the Head Constable, Frank Richardson, at a Session following a speech by the Bishop of Hereford who was concerned about the number of licensed premises in the city and the serving of children. A further report from the Hereford Watch Committee was published in 1899 concerning the Hereford Police Force from statistics supplied by the Chief Constable. This showed the force had thirty three officers at a cost of £1,744 from the local rates. At this time he asked for an increase in salary, which was granted. From 15 November 1899 until 10 May 1900 Frank Richardson was the <b>Charging</b> <b>Officer</b> in six cases which came to court. He was also head of the Hereford St. John Ambulance brigade and chairman of the Belmonty Football Club in Hereford. During his time in office Frank Richardson made use of the Police Gazette, a police magazine sent weekly to senior police officers. to publicize local cases in particular. An early example concerned a large amount of stolen goods. Another, the search for a male. Like two of his sons, Ernest Frank Richardson, Chief Constable of Salisbury, Wiltshire and Alfred Herbert Richardson, Chief Constable of Halifax, Yorkshire, Frank Richardson liked horses and wanted to use them for policing and crowd control. After the success of a 1906 trial and usage with the Royal Family in Salisbury, a mounted section was created in 1911.|$|E
