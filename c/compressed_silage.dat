40|$|The {{influence}} of addition of Zenural 70, urea and Min-A-Zel Plus on chemical composition {{and quality of}} whole maize plant silage with different degree of compression was investigated in the paper. Experiment was two-factorial (2 x 3) with three replications, where factor A was a degree of compression (A, = 680 g/dm³; A 2 = 550 g/dm³), while factor B was an additive type (Decontrol; B 2 = 5 g/kg urea+ 2 g/kg Min-A-Zel Plus; B 3 = 5 g/kg Zenural 70). Chemical analyses showed that {{with the addition of}} Zenural 70 and urea there was significant increase of pH value, total protein, mineral ammonia and soluble nitrogen content. The type of additive had no significant effect on production of lactic, acetic and butyric acid, while in silages with higher degree of compression (680 g/dm 3) there was significantly more butyric acid. All silages were graded first class according to DLG and Flieg method, with the exception of lower <b>compressed</b> <b>silage</b> with added urea and Min-A-Zel Plus, which according to Flieg was second class. According to Zelter method, silages with added Zenural 70 were II and III class, while treatments with added urea and Min-A-Zel Plus were IV and V class. ...|$|E
5000|$|Fodder, a type {{of animal}} feed, is any {{agricultural}} foodstuff used specifically to feed domesticated livestock, such as cattle, goats, sheep, horses, chickens and pigs. [...] "Fodder" [...] refers particularly to food given to the animals (including plants cut and carried to them), rather than that which they forage for themselves (called forage). Fodder (...) is also called provender (...) and includes hay, straw, <b>silage,</b> <b>compressed</b> and pelleted feeds, oils and mixed rations, and sprouted grains and legumes (such as bean sprouts, fresh malt, or spent malt). Most animal feed is from plants, but some manufacturers add ingredients to processed feeds that are of animal origin.|$|R

It includes hay, straw, <b>silage,</b> <b>compressed</b> and pelleted feeds, oils and mixed rations, and sprouted grains and legumes. Feed grains {{are the most important}} source of animal feed globally. The amount of grain used to produce the same unit of meat varies substantially. According to an estimate reported by the BBC in 2008, [...] "Cows and sheep need 8kg of grain for every 1kg of meat they produce, pigs about 4kg. The most efficient poultry units need a mere 1.6kg of feed to produce 1kg of chicken." [...] Farmed fish can also be fed on grain, and use even less than poultry. The two most important feed grains are maize and soyabean, and the United States is by far the largest exporter of both, averaging about half of the global maize trade and 40% of the global soya trade in the years leading up the 2012 drought. [...] Other feed grains include wheat, oats, barley, and rice, among many others.|$|R
