Case report: An 80 -year-old Japanese male was diagnosed with acquired hemophilia A. He had compartment-like symptoms due to soft tissue hemorrhage in his left forearm and right lower extremity. A blood examination showed neutrophilia with a {{white blood cell count}} of 31, 900 /&micro;L (91. 9 % neutrophils), an activated partial thromboplastin time of 69. 0 seconds, coagulation factor VIII (FVIII) &lt; 1. 0 %, and anti-FVIII inhibitor, 190 BU/mL. The bleeding episodes were controlled with intravenous activated prothrombin complex concentrate (FEIBA&reg;) followed by recombinant factor VIIa (NovoSeven&reg;). In addition, oral prednisolone (maximum dose, 30 mg/day) plus four doses of rituximab effectively suppressed anti-FVIII inhibitor levels while simultaneously reducing the neutrophil count. CNL with the JAK 2 kinase V 617 F mutation was identified as the underlying disease.

Myeloid neoplasms are now classified into five categories: acute myeloid leukemia, myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN), MDS/MPN, and myeloid and/or lymphoid malignancies associated with eosinophilia and PDGFR or FGFR 1 rearrangements. MPN are subclassified into eight separate entities: chronic myelogenous leukemia, polycythemia vera, essential thrombocythemia, primary myelofibrosis, systemic mastocytosis, chronic eosinophilic leukemia not otherwise specified, chronic <b>neutrophilic</b> <b>leukemia,</b> and unclassifiable MPN. The diagnosis of chronic myelogenous leukemia requires {{the presence of}} BCR-ABL 1, while its absence is required for all other MPN.

CSF 3 R T 618 I is a highly specific molecular marker for CNL that is sensitive to inhibition in vitro and in vivo by currently approved protein kinase inhibitors. In addition to CSF 3 R mutations, other genetic alterations have been found, notably mutations in SETBP 1, which {{may be used as}} prognostic markers to guide therapeutic decisions. These findings will help to understand the pathogenesis of CNL and greatly impact the clinical management of this disease. In this review, we discuss the new genetic alterations recently found in CNL and the clinical perspectives in its diagnosis and treatment. Fortunately, since the diagnosis of CNL is not based on exclusion anymore, the molecular characterization of the CSF 3 R gene must be included in the WHO criteria for CNL diagnosis.

40|$|Chronic {{myeloproliferative}} diseases without the Philadelphia chromosome marker (Ph-), although first described 60 years ago, only became {{the subject of}} interest {{after the turn of the}} millennium. In 2001, the World Health Organization (WHO) defined the classification of this group of diseases and in 2008 they were renamed myeloproliferative neoplasms based on morphological, cytogenetic and molecular features. In 2005, the identification of a recurrent molecular abnormality characterized by a gain of function with a mutation in the gene encoding Janus kinase 2 (JAK 2) paved the way for greater knowledge of the pathophysiology of myeloproliferative neoplasms. The JAK 2 mutation is found in 90 - 98 % of polycythemia vera and in about 50 % essential thrombocytosis and primary myelofibrosis. In addition to the JAK 2 mutation, other mutations involving TET 2 (ten-eleven translocation), LNK (a membrane-bound adaptor protein); IDH 1 / 2 (isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 / 2 enzyme); ASXL 1 (additional sex combs-like 1) genes were found in myeloproliferative neoplasms thus showing the importance of identifying molecular genetic alterations to confirm diagnosis, guide treatment and improve our understanding of the biology of these diseases. Currently, polycythemia vera, essential thrombocytosis, myelofibrosis, chronic <b>neutrophilic</b> <b>leukemia,</b> chronic eosinophilic leukemia and mastocytosis are included in this group of myeloproliferative neoplasms, but are considered different situations with individualized diagnostic methods and treatment. This review updates pathogenic aspects, molecular genetic alterations, the fundamental criteria for diagnosis and the best approach for each of these entities.

40|$|As síndromes mieloproliferativas crônicas, atualmente denominadas {{neoplasia}}s mieloproliferativas (NMP), de acordo com a 4 ª. edição da classificação da Organização Mundial da Saúde (OMS), são doenças clonais de célula-tronco hematopoética, nas quais há a proliferação aumentada de uma ou mais das séries mieloides (granulocítica, eritrocítica, megacariocítica ou mastocítica) com maturação eficaz. A progressão de todas é caracterizada por fibrose medular ou transformação leucêmica. Pela classificação da OMS, as NMP incluem: {{leucemia mieloide}} crônica (LMC), policitemia vera (PV), mielofibrose idiopática crônica (MF), trombocitemia essencial (TE), leucemia neutrofílica crônica (LNC), leucemia eosinofílica crônica não especificada(LEC), mastocitose (M) e neoplasia mieloproliferativa inclassificável (NMI). É interessante notar que tanto a LMC (BCR/ABL 1) como PV, MF e TE (JAK 2 V 617 F e éxon 12, MPLW 515 L/K) e M (KITD 816 V) tiveram suas bases moleculares desvendadas e apresentam em comum a ativação constitutiva de tirosino-quinase graças às mutações adquiridas pela célula-tronco hematopoética. A mutação JAK 2 V 617 F é observada em mais de 90 % dos casos de PV, mas também em cerca de 50 %- 60 % das MF e TE, levando ao questionamento de como uma única lesão molecular desencadeia três manifestações clínicas diversas. Já há evidências de que eventos genéticos e epigenéticos adicionais contribuem para a patogênese, tais como MPLW 515 L e MPLW 515 K. No presente manuscrito são apresentados os aspectos clínicos, a fisiopatologia e os critérios diagnósticos das diferentes NMP. Chronic myeloproliferative disorders, currently called myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN), {{according to the}} 4 th edition of the World Health Organization (WHO) classification are clonal diseases of hematopoietic stem cells, {{in which there is}} increased proliferation of the myeloid series (granulocytic, erythrocytic, megakaryocytic series or mast cells) with effective maturation. The progression of all is characterized by marrow fibrosis or leukemic transformation. According to the WHO classification, the MPNs include: chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), polycythemia vera (PV), essential thrombocythemia (ET), idiopathic myelofibrosis (IM), chronic <b>neutrophilic</b> <b>leukemia</b> (CNL), chronic eosinophilic leukemia not otherwise categorized (CEL-NC), mastocytosis (M) and myeloproliferative neoplasm unclassifiable (MPNU). It is worth noting that the molecular basis of CML (BCR/ABL 1), as well as PV,ET, IM (JAK 2 V 617 F and exon 12, MPL W 515 L/K) and M (KITD 816 V) have been identified and have, in common, constitutive activation of tyrosine kinase due to acquired hematopoietic stem cell defects. The JAK 2 V 617 F mutation is observed in around 90 % of PV cases and in around 50 - 60 % of IM and ET leading to the question why a single molecular lesion induces three different clinical manifestations. There is already evidence that additional genetic and epigenetic events contribute to the pathogenesis, including MPL W 515 L/K mutation. Some clinical aspects, the pathophysiology and diagnostic criteria of MPNs are presented in this paper...|$|R
40|$|Background Because in {{the past}} Chronic Myeloproliferative Disorders (CMPD) were not {{considered}} to be malignant conditions, cancer registries rarely recorded data on these diseases. Thus, information on incidence and outcome of CMPD in the population is limited. The aim {{of the present study was}} to better define epidemiological data of CMPD by examining all cases identified by the Modena Cancer Registry (MCR). Materials and methods We considered all cases of CMPD diagnosed in the Province of Modena (population 633. 993 at 2001 Census). Cases, except Chronic Myeloid Leukemia, diagnosed from 1997 to 2005, were identified using the MCR database and the archival files of the centralized hemolymphopathological laboratory at Modena Cancer Centre according to ICD-O- 3 codes 9950, 9960 - 64. Death certificate, cytology and histology report, both local and national reports of hospital admission, ICD- 9 code reported in medical records were used as sources for identifying new CMPD cases and their outcome. All cases were checked and validated by a hematologist (A. B.) and a pathologist (G. B.) by a review of the original pathology report. Uniform diagnostic criteria were adopted, because the large majority of bone marrow aspirate and biopsy were examined by the same pathologist (G. B.). Clinical and follow-up data were retrieved by active search of discharge letters, review of hospital records and interview of general practitioners. Information on vital status was achieved from official population registries. Age standardized rates (ASR) were calculated according to the World Standard population. The dates of diagnosis and death or the closing date of study (December 2006) were used to estimate survival. Observed survival and relative survival were calculated according to Kaplan-Meier method and the Hakulinen approach, respectively. Results According to the 2001 World Health Organization (WHO) classification, a total of 380 cases of CMPD were identified. There were 155 Essential Thrombocythemia (ET) (41 % of all CMPD), 114 Policythemia Vera (PV) (30 %), 75 Idiopathic Myelofibrosis (20 %), 2 Hypereosinophilic Syndrome/Chronic Eosinophilic Leukaemia (0. 5 %), 1 Chronic <b>Neutrophilic</b> <b>Leukemia</b> (0. 3 %) and 31 CMPD not otherwise specified (8 %). The ASR of CMPD was 3. 2 / 100, 000 varying slightly (from 2. 5 to 4. 1 / 100, 000) during the study period (p = 0. 11); the crude incidence rate was 6. 6 / 100, 000. Median age at diagnosis was 69 years. No statistically significant differences were observed between sex regarding incidence and age at diagnosis. Overall relative survival was 97 %, 89 % and 88 % at 1, 3 and 5 years after diagnosis, respectively. Analyzing CMPD, we observed a better survival for ET and PV in comparison with other subtypes (p = 0. 01). Conclusions To our knowledge, this study is the first in Italy providing information on the incidence and outcome of CMPD using population-based data. Our results confirm that the risk of developing CMPD increases with age. The incidence of CMPD was substantially stable during the study period. Overall survival patterns reflect the well known chronic course of these diseases. As expected, we observed important differences in overall survival by WHO subtypes. We believe that the availability of precise epidemiological data, in particular those regarding outcome could help clinicians in choosing the most appropriate cost-effective treatments...|$|R
