5|$|In April 2013, Robert Edward Auctions was {{scheduled}} to begin an auction of a T206 Honus Wagner that was once owned by actor <b>Charlie</b> <b>Sheen.</b> Sheen had loaned the card to the All Star Cafe where it was stolen and later recovered by the FBI. It is graded PSA 1.|$|E
5|$|In April 2013, {{the horror}} comedy Scary Movie 5 was released, where Lohan appears as herself {{alongside}} <b>Charlie</b> <b>Sheen</b> {{in the opening}} sketch. While the movie itself was panned by critics, a few reviewers found Lohan's and Sheen's {{to be one of}} the better scenes. The same month Lohan guest-starred as herself in an episode of Sheen's comedy series Anger Management.|$|E
5|$|At several {{stages of}} development, other actors were pursued for the film. In October 2010, Willis said that Steve Austin would reprise {{his role as}} villain Dan Paine. In November 2010, <b>Charlie</b> <b>Sheen</b> was {{reported}} to be in consideration for the role of a CIA agent hunting down Willis' Mr. Church. In August 2011, Variety reported that actor and martial artist Donnie Yen was offered a role in the film; however, Yen declined the role because he did not find it intriguing.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, The New York Times {{reported}} that a sequel to Wall Street, to be subtitled Money Never Sleeps, was already in pre-production. Michael Douglas would reprise his role as Gordon Gekko. The film would also focus on Gekko, recently released from prison and re-entering a much more chaotic financial world {{than the one he}} once oversaw. <b>Charlie</b> <b>Sheen</b> would also reprise his character of Bud Fox, but only in a cameo role. Daryl Hannah would not be involved in the sequel.|$|E
5|$|Ryan White {{was one of}} {{a handful}} of highly visible people with AIDS in the 1980s and early 1990s who helped change the public {{perception}} of the disease. Ryan, along with actor Rock Hudson, was one of the earliest public faces of AIDS. Along with later public figures who became associated with HIV/AIDS, such as the Ray brothers, Magic Johnson, Arthur Ashe, The Brady Bunch's Robert Reed, Tim Richmond, Elizabeth Glaser, Liberace, Freddie Mercury and <b>Charlie</b> <b>Sheen,</b> Ryan White helped to increase public awareness that HIV/AIDS was a significant epidemic.|$|E
5|$|A year later, he starred with <b>Charlie</b> <b>Sheen</b> in the Jim Abrahams comedy Hot Shots!, {{which was}} {{received}} very positively. Cryer is frequently {{linked to the}} Brat Pack. In a March 2009 interview on Anytime with Bob Kushell, Cryer stated that he had auditioned for St. Elmo's Fire but was not cast in a role. In 1993, {{he was asked to}} audition for the role of Chandler Bing on Friends, while doing a play in London. His reading was videotaped by a British casting agent but the tape failed to arrive in the U.S. before the network had made its final decision.|$|E
5|$|Eastwood {{directed}} {{and starred in}} White Hunter Black Heart (1990), an adaptation of Peter Viertel's roman à clef, about John Huston {{and the making of}} the classic film The African Queen. Shot on location in Zimbabwe in the summer of 1989, the film received some critical attention but with only a limited release earned just $8.4million. Later in 1990, Eastwood {{directed and}} co-starred with <b>Charlie</b> <b>Sheen</b> in The Rookie, a buddy cop action film. Critics found the film's plot and characterization unconvincing, but praised its action sequences. An ongoing lawsuit, in response to Eastwood allegedly ramming a woman's car, resulted in no Eastwood films being shown in cinemas in 1991. Eastwood won the suit and agreed to pay the complainant's legal fees if she did not appeal.|$|E
5|$|The {{new edition}} of the Tiger Woods PGA Tour series of video games {{incorporates}} elements of the alleged physical altercations Woods had with his wife regarding his extramarital affairs, and resembles a fighting game more than a golf simulation. Cartman, Stan, Kyle and Kenny become big fans of the game. Meanwhile, scientists at the Center for Disease Control determine that sex addiction is a disease reaching epidemic proportions. They decide to screen schoolchildren for the disease, and Kenny, Kyle, and Butters are diagnosed as sex addicts. Kenny is killed after attempting autoerotic asphyxiation while in a Batman suit, while Kyle and Butters are sent to attend a therapy session for sex addicts consisting of Michael Douglas, Michael Jordan, Ben Roethlisberger, David Duchovny, <b>Charlie</b> <b>Sheen,</b> David Letterman, Bill Clinton, Billy Bob Thornton, Kobe Bryant, Eliot Spitzer, and Tiger Woods.|$|E
5|$|Darabont looked {{initially}} {{at some of}} {{his favorite}} actors like Gene Hackman and Robert Duvall {{for the role of}} Andy Dufresne, but they were unavailable; Clint Eastwood and Paul Newman were also considered. Tom Cruise, Tom Hanks, and Kevin Costner were offered, and passed on the role —Hanks due to his starring role in Forrest Gump, and Costner because he had the lead in Waterworld. Johnny Depp, Nicolas Cage, and <b>Charlie</b> <b>Sheen</b> were also considered for the role at different stages. Cruise attended table readings of the script, but refused to work for the inexperienced Darabont. Darabont said he cast Robbins after seeing his performance in the 1990 psychological horror Jacob's Ladder. When Robbins was cast he insisted that Darabont use experienced cinematographer Roger Deakins, who had worked with him on The Hudsucker Proxy. To prepare for the role, Robbins observed caged animals at a zoo, spent an afternoon in solitary confinement, spoke with prisoners and guards, and had his arms and legs shackled for a few hours.|$|E
5|$|McQuarrie wrote nine {{drafts of}} his {{screenplay}} over five months, until Singer {{felt that it}} was ready to shop around to the studios. None were interested except for a European financing company. McQuarrie and Singer had a difficult time getting the film made because of the non-linear story, the large amount of dialogue and the lack of cast attached to the project. Financiers wanted established stars, and offers for the small role of Redfoot (the L.A. fence who hooks up the five protagonists with Kobayashi) went out to Christopher Walken, Tommy Lee Jones, Jeff Bridges, <b>Charlie</b> <b>Sheen,</b> James Spader, Al Pacino and Johnny Cash. However, the European money allowed the film's producers to make offers to actors and assemble a cast. They were only able to offer the actors salaries that were well below their usual pay, but they agreed because of the quality of McQuarrie's script and the chance to work with each other. That money fell through, however, and Singer used the script and the cast to attract PolyGram to pick up the film negative.|$|E
5|$|Several of {{the most}} {{expensive}} items of sports memorabilia and baseball memorabilia ever sold at auction are associated with Ruth. As of November 2016, the most expensive piece of sports memorabilia ever sold is Ruth's 1920 Yankees jersey, which sold for $4,415,658 in 2012. The bat with which he hit the first home run at Yankee Stadium is in The Guinness Book of World Records as the most expensive baseball bat sold at auction, having fetched $1,265,000 on December 2, 2004. A hat of Ruth's from the 1934 season set a record for a baseball cap when David Wells sold it at auction for $537,278 in 2012. In 2017, <b>Charlie</b> <b>Sheen</b> sold Ruth's 1927 World Series ring for $2,093,927 at auction. It easily broke the record for a championship ring previously set when Julius Erving's 1974 ABA championship ring sold for $460,741 in 2011.|$|E
5|$|Almost {{the entire}} {{original}} cast from season two returned {{for the third}} season, including Amy Poehler, Rashida Jones, Aziz Ansari, Nick Offerman, Aubrey Plaza and Chris Pratt. The only permanent cast member not to return was Paul Schneider, who previously played city planner Mark Brendanawicz. Schneider departed from the series {{at the end of}} season two. Jim O'Heir and Retta, who made regular appearances as parks employees Jerry Gergich and Donna Meagle during the first two seasons, were considered members of the regular cast starting in season three, although they still do not appear in the opening credits. Adam Scott, who portrayed state auditor Ben Wyatt in the final two episodes of the second season, became a regular cast member starting in season three, and Rob Lowe, who appeared in the same two second-season episodes as state auditor Chris Traeger, also joined the cast in season three. Lowe was originally meant only to make a string of performances in seasons two and three and then depart the show, but he instead become a regular cast member starting with the third season, having signed a multi-year contract to remain on the show. After actor <b>Charlie</b> <b>Sheen</b> was fired from the CBS comedy series Two and a Half Men in March 2011, rumors circulated that Rob Lowe would depart Parks and Recreation and replace Sheen, but they proved unfounded.|$|E

500|$|MacFarlane often participates {{as one of}} the [...] "roasters" [...] in {{the annual}} Comedy Central Roasts. MacFarlane is the only person to serve as roastmaster for more than one Comedy Central roast. In 2010, he filled this role for The Comedy Central Roast of David Hasselhoff. The {{following}} year he was roastmaster of Comedy Central roasts of Donald Trump and <b>Charlie</b> <b>Sheen.</b>|$|E
500|$|With {{regards to}} {{presumptive}} 2016 GOP nominee Donald Trump, Cryer shared his feelings on the May 5, 2016, {{episode of the}} podcast Never Not Funny. Cryer stated, [...] "I have been pointing out, and I have been screaming to the rooftops, that Donald Trump is the <b>Charlie</b> <b>Sheen</b> of politics. [...] I have to tell you, I love <b>Charlie</b> <b>Sheen,</b> I loved working {{with him when he}} was sober, but he was, he's full of shit. He has been full of shit, you know, he has serious addiction. You know, his addiction is obviously serious, drugs, and, but, Trump is just addicted to feeling important. You know, and I think if anybody is under the delusion that he cares about, uh, uh, anybody in America besides himself, they are, they are stoned and need to rethink their priorities, 'cause he's, you know, 'cause it's just ridiculous that's he's gotten as far as he has." ...|$|E
500|$|Cartoon parodies {{of several}} celebrities who have {{experienced}} real-life sexual scandals were featured in the episode, including Bill Clinton, David Letterman, <b>Charlie</b> <b>Sheen,</b> David Duchovny and Ben Roethlisberger. The treatment these celebrities received is portrayed as ineffective and ridiculous, suggesting celebrities {{should not have to}} undergo insincere acts of public apology for their sexual transgressions. [...] "Sexual Healing" [...] received generally mixed reviews from critics.|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} written by Spencer Porter and {{directed}} by Jerry Langford. It received mixed reviews from critics for its storyline and many cultural references. According to Nielsen ratings, it was viewed in 7.27 million homes in its original airing. The episode featured guest performances by Jennifer Birmingham, Rob Lotterstein, Danielle Panabaker, <b>Charlie</b> <b>Sheen,</b> Elijah Wood and James Woods, along with several recurring guest voice actors for the series. [...] "Brian Griffin's House of Payne" [...] was released on DVD along with ten other episodes from the season on December 13, 2011.|$|E
500|$|Stone also {{consulted}} with Carl Icahn, Asher Edelman, convicted inside trader David Brown, several government prosecutors, and Wall Street investment bankers. In addition, traders {{were brought in}} to coach actors on the set on how to hold phones, write out tickets, and talk to clients. Stone asked Lipper to design a six-week course that would expose <b>Charlie</b> <b>Sheen</b> to {{a cross section of}} young Wall Street business people. The actor said, [...] "I was impressed and very, very respectful {{of the fact that they}} could maintain that kind of aggressiveness and drive".|$|E
500|$|Similarly, LaMarche {{points to}} two {{other types of}} movies {{difficult}} to market to large audiences. [...] "Winter can {{be a boon to}} little movies with niche audiences," [...] she writes, pointing to Dustin Hoffman's directorial debut, Quartet, which received a limited U.S. release in January 2013, and Struck by Lightning, released at the same time. Movies that also blend genres or defy such categorization, such as the zombie–human Romeo and Juliet retelling, Warm Bodies, or the limited-release <b>Charlie</b> <b>Sheen</b> comedy A Glimpse Inside the Mind of Charles Swan III, are also ideal for their dump-months release time frame.|$|E
500|$|Stone gave <b>Charlie</b> <b>Sheen</b> {{the choice}} of Jack Lemmon or Martin Sheen to play his father in the film, and Sheen picked his father. The elder Sheen related to the moral sense of his character. Stone cast Daryl Hannah as Bud Fox's materialistic girlfriend Darien Taylor, but {{felt that she was}} never happy with the role and did not know why she {{accepted}} it. He tried to explain the character to Hannah repeatedly, and thought that the materialism of the character conflicted with Hannah's idealism. Stone said later that he was aware early on that she was not right for the part. [...] "Daryl Hannah was not happy doing the role and I should have let her go. All my crew {{wanted to get rid of}} her after one day of shooting. My pride was such that I kept saying I was going to make it work". Stone also had difficulties with Sean Young, who made her opinions known that Hannah should be fired and that she should play that role instead. Young would show up to the set late and unprepared. She did not get along with <b>Charlie</b> <b>Sheen,</b> which caused further friction on the set. In retrospect, Stone felt that Young was right and he should have swapped Hannah's role with hers. Stone admits that he had [...] "some problems" [...] with Young, but was not willing to confirm or deny rumors that she walked off with all of her costumes when she completed filming.|$|E
500|$|In 1985, Ryder sent a videotaped audition, {{where she}} recited a {{monologue}} from the novel Franny and Zooey by J. D. Salinger, {{to appear in}} the film Desert Bloom. Although the part went to Annabeth Gish, writer/director David Seltzer noticed her talent and cast her in his film Lucas (1986), about a boy called Lucas (Corey Haim) and his life at high school. Shot in the summer of 1985, the film co-starred <b>Charlie</b> <b>Sheen</b> and Kerri Green with Ryder playing Rina, one of Lucas's friends at school. When asked how she wanted her name {{to appear in the}} credits, she suggested [...] "Ryder" [...] as her surname because a Mitch Ryder album that belonged to her father was playing in the background.|$|E
