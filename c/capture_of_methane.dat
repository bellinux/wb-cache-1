The UACT contributes to extra <b>capture</b> <b>of</b> <b>methane</b> from the raw wastewater. It also significantly facilitates the reuse of the treated water. The efficiency of the UACT process is demonstrated in this study using laboratory-scale reactors. The water produced by the UACT had a low total COD, in most cases below 145 mg/L and a soluble COD below 60 mg/L at surface loading rates between 0. 1 - 0. 4 m(3) /(m(2) h) and hydraulic retention times between 5 - 6 h. The sludge bed of the UACT was characterised by 6 - 10 times higher substrate affinity (for ethanol, acetate and propionate) compared to the parent UASB and similar specific activity. The results suggest that a UASB followed by the UACT can, upon subsequent application of a rapid filtration, qualify as a total COD removal, no longer necessitating aerobic treatment...|$|E
40|$|Wastewater {{treatment}} plants require {{substantial amounts of}} energy for pumping and treating water {{as well as for}} other plant operations. National and regional policy changes resulting in stricter water quality standards could result in an increase in energy requirements for treatment, as further treatment or more energy intensive technologies would be required. Given rises in energy costs, effective energy management plans are necessary for municipal wastewater {{treatment plants}}. Energy usage in wastewater treatment plants can be reduced through a number of different technology options without compromising water quality output. These different technology options vary in effectiveness, energy intensity, and upfront and operational costs, and the choice of technologies is often dependent upon local conditions and plant specific characteristics. Energy management can be improved also through electricity production on-site from the <b>capture</b> <b>of</b> <b>methane</b> gases released during treatment or from the inclusion of renewable electricity generating technologies. These technology options augment the creation of energy on-site while not necessarily reducing total energy demands. The objective of this paper is to, through use of a case study of a wastewater treatment facility in Boulder, Colorado, describe the most energy intensive processes of wastewater treatment, review various technology options for these processes, and discuss the opportunities and barriers to improving energy management at wastewater treatment plants.

Biofilters use porous media colonized by microbial biofilms {{to capture and}} degrade odorous, hazardous and greenhouse gases making them well-suited for livestock housing and manure storage emissions. Fungi are abundant in these biofilters though their dynamics, degradation of media, community shifts, and functional roles have not been well-investigated. To explore spatial and temporal fungal dynamics in full-scale woodchip biofilters treating swine barn emissions, a novel monitoring approach was developed. Using wooden baits and microbial measures optimized to target biofilms biofilter fungi were characterized and shown to tolerate media desiccation. Additionally, successional patterns at the taxa and guild level were studied, {{and the development of}} a dominant fungal community was identified. To address the practical question of media longevity, a litter bag study was deployed in the same full-scale biofilters. Decay rates of various media types were identified, and microbial decay was dependent on media quality, nitrogen, and emissions levels. Using a lab-scale biofilter system, fungi were shown to improve the <b>capture</b> <b>of</b> <b>methane,</b> particularly after periods of low-concentration inlet emissions. Using a chromatographic isotherm the ability of fungi to sorb methane gas was verified for the first time. Collectively, this work showcases dynamics and potential abilities of fungi in biofilters treating livestock production emission and may be used to guide subsequent efforts to connect fungi to biofilter function. If these processes can be understood and controlled, there is the potential to improving biofilter performance, better protect air quality and improve farming system sustainability...|$|E

40|$|A {{steady state}} box model was {{developed}} to estimate the methane input into the Black Sea water column at various water depths. Our model results reveal a total input <b>of</b> <b>methane</b> <b>of</b> 4. 7 Tg yr− 1. The model predicts that the input <b>of</b> <b>methane</b> is largest at water depths between 600 and 700 m (7 % of the total input), suggesting that the dissociation <b>of</b> <b>methane</b> gas hydrates at water depths equivalent to their upper stability limit may represent an important source <b>of</b> <b>methane</b> into the water column. In addition we discuss the effects <b>of</b> massive short-term <b>methane</b> inputs (e. g. through eruptions of deep-water mud volcanoes or submarine landslides at intermediate water depths) on the water column methane distribution and the resulting methane emission to the atmosphere. Our non-steady state simulations predict that these inputs will be effectively buffered by intense microbial methane consumption and that the upward flux <b>of</b> <b>methane</b> is strongly hampered by the pronounced density stratification of the Black Sea water column. For instance, an assumed input <b>of</b> <b>methane</b> <b>of</b> 179 Tg CH 4 d− 1 (equivalent to the amount <b>of</b> <b>methane</b> released by 1000 mud volcano eruptions) at a water depth of 700 m will only marginally influence the sea/air methane flux increasing it by only 3 %...|$|R
40|$|The {{combination}} of Pt(2 +), benzoquinone and NaNO(2) forms an electron-transfer chain, {{which leads to}} the oxidation <b>of</b> <b>methane</b> by O(2) in CF(3) COOH aqueous solution. The overall turnover number per hour (TOF) <b>of</b> <b>methane</b> at 120 degrees C is 0. 5 h(- 1), however, only about one fourth (23 %) <b>of</b> <b>methane</b> is converted to the desired product of methanol in the formation of CF(3) COOCH(3). The over-oxidation <b>of</b> <b>methane</b> to CO(2), over the catalyst with the Pt(2 +) species immobilized via 2, 2 '-bipyridyl as a ligand on the silica substrate, is depressed distinctly. Under the same conditions, the conversion to methanol dominates, and no CO(2) is observed, on account of the over-oxidation <b>of</b> <b>methane,</b> as confirmed by the isotope experiment...|$|R
