5|$|Historical markers {{concerning}} Hines' exploits have occasionally included mistaken information. The historical marker {{placed by}} the Indiana Civil War Centennial Commission in 1963 {{in the vicinity}} of Derby, Perry County, Indiana, to memorialize Hines' entry into Indiana states that Hines invaded Indiana in 1862, although he actually did so in 1863. In addition, a marker by the Confederate Monument of Bowling Green in Bowling Green's Fairview Cemetery says that Hines died before he <b>could</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> dedication ceremony in 1876, when in reality he died in 1898 and is buried a few hundred feet away.|$|E

25|$|In 1803, {{his father}} {{obtained}} a false passport so that Audubon <b>could</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> United States to avoid conscription in the Napoleonic Wars. Jean Audubon and Claude Rozier arranged a business partnership for their sons to pursue in Pennsylvania. It {{was based on}} Claude Rozier's buying half of Jean Audubon's share of a plantation in Haiti, and lending money to the partnership as secured by half interest in lead mining at Audubon's property of Mill Grove.|$|E

25|$|If Wilson's {{record as}} prime {{minister}} was soon felt to {{have been one of}} failure, that sense of failure was powerfully reinforced by Callahan's term as premier. Labour, it seemed, was incapable of positive achievements. It was unable to control inflation, unable to control the unions, unable to solve the Irish problem, unable to solve the Rhodesian question, unable to secure its proposals for Welsh and Scottish devolution, unable to reach a popular modus vivendi with the Common Market, unable even to maintain itself in power until it <b>could</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> country and the date of its own choosing. It was little wonder, therefore, that Mrs. Thatcher resoundingly defeated it in 1979.|$|E
25|$|Despite being a brain dead {{patient who}} only has hours to live, Wilson {{wakes up in}} his own Dreamscape and is met by the Scarecrow Guide. She informs him of where he is and allows him to explore his {{memories}} for one last time, but warns him that memories aren't always good. Upon finding a hidden key inside a tree that he had put there in his childhood, Wilson {{opens the door to}} a nearby cabin. Inside he discovers old drawings he and his friend Amelia had made when they were children. He remembers that she made him promise to fly her away from here when they grew up so she <b>could</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Big City. Wilson then explores a nearby barn, in which he and Amelia had kissed for the first time.|$|E
25|$|John Dean {{believed}} that he, Mitchell, Ehrlichman, and Haldeman <b>could</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> prosecutors, tell the truth, {{and save the}} presidency. Dean wanted to protect the president and have his four closest men take the fall for telling the truth. During the critical meeting between Dean and Nixon on April 15, 1973, Dean was totally unaware of the president’s depth of knowledge and involvement in the Watergate cover-up. It was during this meeting that Dean {{felt that he was}} being recorded. He wondered if this was due to the way Nixon was speaking, {{as if he were trying}} to prod attendees’ recollections of earlier conversations about fundraising. Dean mentioned this observation while testifying to the Senate Committee on Watergate, exposing the thread of what were taped conversations that would unravel the fabric of the conspiracy.|$|E

25|$|With {{the death}} of Austin Corbin in June 1896 the LIRR was reorganized {{and the decline of}} the Manhattan Beach line started. Various rapid transit lines in Brooklyn had been unified under the Brooklyn Rapid Transit (BRT) system, and a {{connection}} was built between the Fulton Street Elevated and the Brighton Line, which was long opposed by Corbin, and this led to a decline in revenue for the Manhattan Beach. The LIRR and BRT agreed to keep out of the other's business after an agreement was made on April 1, 1899. The BRT's acquisition of all of the Brooklyn Elevated railroads was no longer opposed by the LIRR, and a connection at Sheepshead Bay was built so that trains from the Brighton Line <b>could</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Manhattan Beach Hotel. Control of the Culver Line was given to the BRT soon afterwards.|$|E
500|$|On 25 October, at King George's invitation, the {{children}} {{played at the}} celebrations marking the fourth anniversary of the king's accession. Their next public appearance was a concert on 21 February 1765, before a moderate audiencethe date clashed with a Bach-Abel concert. Only one more London concert was given, on 13 May, but between April and June {{members of the public}} <b>could</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Mozarts' lodgings where, for a five shilling fee, Wolfgang would perform his musical party pieces. During June both the [...] "young Prodigies" [...] performed daily at the Swan and Harp Tavern in Cornhill, the charge this time being a mere two shillings and sixpence. These were, as Sadie puts it, [...] "Leopold's last, desperate effort to extract guineas from the English public". Hildesheimer likens this part of the tour to a travelling circus, comparing the Mozarts to a family of acrobats.|$|E
500|$|On October 1, Perot re-entered {{the presidential}} race, {{with a desire}} to further explain his {{economic}} plans to the American people. The New York Times commented that Perot's [...] "chances of winning are much less than when he quit in July. His only dim practical hope is to confuse and destabilize the contest." [...] He hoped to spend more resources using paid advertisements than holding traditional rallies to spread his message. During the last month of campaigning, Perot left his headquarters in Dallas only to appear in the presidential debates and seven rallies. One aide later commented: [...] "he wanted to do it just like he <b>could</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> office every day, run for president, and go home and eat dinner." [...] Rather than using professional advisers, Perot employed [...] "political amateurs" [...] whose loyalty was unquestioned. Orson Swindle, whom he had known since the 1970s, was hired as the top aide. Perot's son-in-law Clayton Mulford, who was involved in the early draft effort, was hired as legal adviser. Sharon Holman, who worked for Perot since 1969, was hired as press secretary, and friend Murphy Martin was added as the media chief.|$|E

500|$|On August 30, 2011, Sounders FC hosted their {{semifinal}} opponent, FC Dallas, {{in front}} of 4,593 at Starfire Sports Complex. [...] Both teams started their first team players for the match. [...] Seattle applied offensive pressure {{for most of the}} first half and broke through with a goal in the 40th minute. [...] Fredy Montero, who had just missed with a bicycle kick shot moments earlier, took a curling left-footed shot {{in front of}} goal for the score. [...] Dallas nearly equalized in the 49th minute when Marvin Chavez had a shot bounce hard off the goal post. [...] Dallas continued to attack for most of the second half, and Chavez again had a chance to equalize just before the final whistle, but his shot went high over the goal. [...] With a final score of 1–0, Seattle secured their third straight appearance in the U.S. Open Cup final match. [...] Following the match, Dallas coach Schellas Hyndman complained about how hosts are determined for U.S. Open Cup matches saying, [...] "for me, {{this is one of the}} best events – the Lamar Hunt Open Cup – but I'd really like to see it into a structure where it's not a bid system. A bid system is where one team will buy the games because they're bidding higher." [...] He continued, [...] "it <b>could</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> higher seeds, instead of a bid system where you're spending money, or it could be pre-determined. I think that brings out all the fairness to the event." ...|$|E
500|$|Lody {{stated that}} he had been sent to the UK [...] "to remain until the first [...] {{encounter}} had taken place between the two Powers, and to send accurate information as regards the actual losses of the British Fleet", as well as to observe what he could of Fleet movements off the coast. The court martial went into an in camera session while sensitive evidence was being heard. Lody claimed that he had asked in August to be erased from military service on the grounds of poor health and to be allowed to travel to the United States. This was refused, he went on, but a member of naval intelligence whom he had previously never met coaxed him into undertaking a mission in the UK on the condition that he <b>could</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> US afterwards. Lody told the tribunal that he was not pressured but that [...] "I have never been a coward in my life and I certainly would not be a shirker", and that he had persisted with his mission because [...] "once a man has promised to do a thing he does it, that is the understanding." [...] His services were provided [...] "absolutely as an honour and free", while he had never intended to be a spy: [...] "I was pressed for secret service, but not as a spy– oh, no. If that would have been mentioned to me at Berlin I surely would have refused. The word in the sentence, I do not think it goes together." [...] He claimed that he had [...] "pledged my word of honour" [...] not to name his controller.|$|E

In eight games (including five starts), he led the Spartans in rushing with 86 carries for 497yards, despite missing five games with a knee injury. Then-Spartans coach John L. Smith said of Ringer, [...] "Javon Ringer is a special player and a special young man. He has incredible heart and courage.

[...] Kiplinger's Personal Finance noted that several of the kids they playtested with became stumped in the hieroglyphics portion of the game, with one child exclaiming [...] "sometimes you don't get enough clues".

2500|$|Orwell details {{noteworthy}} {{changes in}} the social and political atmosphere of Barcelona when he returns after three months at the front. He describes a lack of revolutionary atmosphere and the class division that he had thought would not reappear, i.e., with visible division between rich and poor and the return of servile language. Orwell had been determined to leave the POUM, and confesses here that he [...] "would have liked to join the Anarchists," [...] but instead sought a recommendation to join the International Column, so that he <b>could</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Madrid front. The latter half of this chapter is devoted to describing the conflict between the anarchist CNT and the socialist Unión General de Trabajadores (UGT) and the resulting cancellation of the May Day demonstration and the build-up to the street fighting of the Barcelona May Days. [...] "It was the antagonism between those who wished the revolution to go forward and those who wished to check or prevent it—ultimately, between Anarchists and Communists." ...|$|E
