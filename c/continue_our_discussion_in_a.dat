In Section 3, we present construction of the confidence intervals <b>continuing</b> <b>our</b> <b>discussion</b> <b>in</b> Section 5 of the manuscript. In Section 4, we give extra plots and tables mentioned in Section 4 of the manuscript. At last in Section 5, we provide instructions for using the R code for our approach; the R code is provided in a separate file in the Supplementary Material. = These authors contributed equally to this work. 1 In this appendix we use the same setting as described in Section 3 of the manuscript. For convenience, here we reproduce the constrained maximum likelihood optimization problem of Section 3 of the manuscript. We estimate parameters of the regression model using the constrained maximum likelihood estimation. For a given sample Sn = (xl, yl) n l= 1, we solve the following convex optimization problem max β l(β|Sn) s. t. ∑ k i= 0 βikxi + ∑ p j=k βkjxj ≥ 0, ∀x ∈ X, k = 1, [...] ., d (1) where l(β|Sn) is the log-likelihood function for the regression model. The actual form of this function depends on whether {{we are dealing with}} the least squares regression, logistic regression or some other version of the generalized linear model. Notice that constraints (1) are variational, that is they must hold at any point x ∈ X. As has been discussed in the main text, these linear variational constraints can be rewritten as simple non-linear inequality constraints: k∑ [βikxi 0 − |βik|xir] + i= 0 j=k p∑ [βkjxj 0 − |βkj|xjr] ≥ 0.

30|$|The rest of {{this paper}} is {{organized}} as follows: In Sect. 1, we present the historical development and introduce/recall a few basic definitions and auxiliary results that will be used in the sequel. In Sect. 2, we utilize a partitioning scheme due to Mond and Weir [7], and formulate two general second-order parameter-free duality models for (P) and prove weak, strong, and strict converse duality theorems using various generalized (F,β,ϕ,ρ,θ,m)-sounivexity assumptions. We <b>continue</b> <b>our</b> <b>discussion</b> of duality <b>in</b> Sects. 3 and 4 where we construct four additional general second-order parameter-free duality models with different constraint structures and prove several second-order duality results under a variety of generalized (F,β,ϕ,ρ,θ,m)-sounivexity conditions. Finally, in Sect. 5, we summarize our main results and also point out some research opportunities arising from certain modifications of the principal minmax model investigated in this study.|$|R
40|$|Beaches {{can provide}} a natural barrier between the ocean and inland communities, ecosystems, and resources. These environments can move and change in {{response}} to winds, waves, and currents. When a hurricane occurs, these changes can be rather large and possibly catastrophic. The high waves and storm surge act together to erode beaches and inundate low-lying lands, putting inland communities at risk. There are thousands of buoys in the Atlantic Basin that record and update data to help predict climate conditions {{in the state of}} Florida. The data that was compiled and used into a larger data set came from two different sources. First, the hurricane data for the years 1992 – 2014 came from Unisys Weather site (Atlantic Basin Hurricanes data, last 40 years) and the buoy data has been available from the national buoy center. Using various statistical methods, we will analyze the probability of a storm being present, given conditions at the buoy; determine the probability of a storm being present categorically. There are four different types of sinkholes that exist in Florida and they are: Collapse Sinkholes, Solution Sinkholes, Alluvial Sinkholes, and Raveling Sinkholes. In Florida there are sinkholes that occur, because of the different soil types that are prevalent in certain areas. The data that was used in this study came from the Florida Department of Environmental Protection, Subsidence Incident Reports. The size of the data was 926 with 15 variables. We will present a statistical analysis of a sinkholes length and width relationship, determine the average size of the diameter of a sinkhole, discuss the relationship of sinkhole size depending upon their soil types, and acknowledge the best probable occurrence of when a sinkhole occurs. There will be five research chapters in this dissertation. In Chapter 2, the concept of Exploratory Factor Analysis and Non-Response Analysis will be introduced, in accordance of analyzing hurricanes. Chapter 3 will also address the topic of hurricanes that have formed from the Atlantic Basin from 1992 – 2014. The discussion of the probability of a storm being present (also categorically) will be addressed. In Chapter 4 a study of sinkholes in Florida will be addressed. In Chapter 5 we will <b>continue</b> <b>our</b> <b>discussion</b> on sinkholes <b>in</b> Florida, but focus on the time to event between the occurrences of the sinkholes. In the last chapter, Chapter 6, we will conclude with a future works and projects that can be created from the foundations of this dissertation...|$|R

30|$|As {{applications}} {{and services are}} increasingly being deployed to the cloud {{to be used by}} multiple tenants/users, {{there is a need to}} isolate tenants, processes, and components, and thus implement multitenancy. Multitenancy architectures are typically used for deploying components of cloud-hosted services for multiple tenants/users. This is based on the assumption that tenants share resources as much as possible which leads to a reduction in resource consumption and running cost per tenant. Overall this makes it feasible to target a wider audience as more resources would be made available [1].

40|$|In {{the last}} lecture, we {{analyzed}} the Move-To-Front heuristic for searching in a self-organizing linkedlist. In particular, {{we showed that}} Move-To-Front is both statically and dynamically optimal (as good as any dynamic list) up to a factor of 2, provided we work under Sleator & Tarjan’s cost model. We also introduced an omniscient algorithm called Order-By-Next-Request [Mun 00], and proved that it is exponentially faster than Move-To-Front or any other online algorithm for a particular request sequence (listing the elements in order). In this lecture, we will <b>continue</b> <b>our</b> <b>discussion</b> of self-organizing lists by showing that Munro’s Order-By-Next-Request strategy is not only better than all online algorithms, but amortized it achieves the “entropy ” bound, {{which is the best}} possible performance for any comparison-based search structure in the stochastic model.
