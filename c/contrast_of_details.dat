The {{purpose of this study}} is to remove the shadow of cervical vertebrae from dental panoramic x-ray images with a to-mosynthesis method and improve the <b>contrast</b> <b>of</b> <b>details</b> in both the teeth and jaw bones. To measure the shift-amount at each angular position that was required for reconstruction of panoramic x-ray images of the dental arch, strip images of a calibration phantom were acquired. Then, a shift-amount table was prepared from these images, and the other shift-amount table, which was used to reconstruct a panoramic image of the cervical vertebrae, was prepared by inverting the curve of the shift-amount table upside down. Using these two tables, images focused on the dental arch and cervical vertebrae of a patient were made with the original strip data of the patient. The shadow of the cervical vertebrae ap-pearing on the image focused on the dental arch was removed using the two above-mentioned images and blurring functions defined at two focusing geometries. The validity of the proposed method was evaluated with clinically ac-quired data of two patients. The shadow of the cervical vertebrae was successfully eliminated, and the contrast of the front teeth and detailed structures of the jaw bones was improved. The results of the experiments showed that our pro-posed method was significantly effective in removing the shadow of the cervical vertebrae from conventional pano...|$|E
40|$|Graphene is a {{promising}} material for many applications, including electronics, energy technologies, chemical filters and mechanical materials. In this work, graphene has been grown by {{chemical vapour deposition}} (CVD) on Cu foil. The as-grown foils were studied by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), before the Cu was etched and the graphene transferred, without the use of polymers, onto Si wafers for further SEM study. For further transmission electron microscopy (TEM) study, the graphene was instead transferred onto TEM grids. The samples were contaminated by SiO 2 nanoparticles from the CVD chamber walls, and iron oxide nanoparticles from the Fe-based etch. For rapid structural analysis, SEM was found to be highly useful at low voltage of around 1 kV. This gave high <b>contrast</b> <b>of</b> <b>details</b> of the upper atomic layers of the surface, enabling study of details of graphene, like wrinkles, directly on the Cu surface. Transferring onto Si wafer also proved useful, as then grain boundaries in graphene could be studied in SEM. TEM was useful for determining the thickness of the graphene. Aberration corrected TEM enabled the study of defects in the graphene, while carbon mapping of the C-k peak by electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) gave monolayered thickness contrast of the graphene. High-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscope (HAADF-STEM) was used with high precision energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) to chemically identify the nanoparticle contaminations. A process for growing graphene directly on Si was also attempted, by first depositing 100 nm of Cu on the Si wafer, then graphene was grown by CVD and the Cu was evaporated. However, the graphene covering the Cu limited the evaporation of Cu, making it dificult to evaporate it completely. In this process the SiO 2 particles formed only on control Cu-foil samples, and were absent from the deposited Cu thin film on Si. This suggests the particles form due to unknown features of the Cu foil...|$|E

The resulting increase in {{density of the}} tissue provides greatly enhanced contrast with minimal distortion. Relative densities of various structures are found {{to depend on the}} heavy metal ions present and on the conditions of staining. Certain hitherto unobserved details are revealed and some sort of specificity exists, although the factors involved are not yet understood. At the present time low contrast is an important factor limiting the resolution which can be obtained with the electron microscope <b>of</b> small biological <b>details</b> in thin sections. As a result, there has been little advantage in achieving resolutions lower than 20 A in micrographs of most sectioned material.

In order to increase contrast (for a given microscopical set-up), either the embedding material must be removed entirely or the density of the tissue must be increased.

40|$|Near-infrared gray images {{captured}} {{together with}} corresponding visible color images have recently proven useful for image restoration and classification. This paper introduces a new coloring method to add colors to near-infrared gray images {{based on a}} contrast-preserving mapping model. A naive coloring method directly adds the colors from the visible color image to the near-infrared gray image; however, this method results in an unrealistic image because of the discrepancies in brightness and image structure between the captured near-infrared gray image and the visible color image. To solve the discrepancy problem, first we present a new contrast-preserving mapping model {{to create a new}} near-infrared gray image with a similar appearance in the luminance plane to the visible color image, while preserving the <b>contrast</b> and <b>details</b> <b>of</b> the captured near-infrared gray image.

In the Monte Carlo program, SNR is calculated assuming that the noise arises from the random fluctuations in the energy imparted per unit area to the image detector only.

40|$|Summary. — Phase-based {{approaches}} can revolutionize X-ray {{imaging and}} remove its main limitation: poor image contrast arising from low attenuation differences. They exploit the unit decrement {{of the real}} part of the refractive index, typically 1000 {{times larger than the}} imaginary part driving attenuation. This increases the <b>contrast</b> <b>of</b> all <b>details,</b> and enables the detection of features classically considered “X-ray invisible”. Following pioneering experiments dating back to the mid-sixties, X-ray phase contrast imaging “exploded ” in the mid-nineties, when third generation synchrotron sources became more widely available. Applications were proposed in fields as diverse as material science, palaeontology, biology, food science, cultural heritage preservation, and many others. Among these applications, medicine has been constantly considered the most important; among medical applications, mam-mography is arguably the one that attracted most attention. Applications to mam-mography were pioneered by the SYRMEP (SYnchrotron Radiation for MEdical Physics) group in Trieste, which was already active in the area through a combi-nation of innovative ways to do imaging at synchrotrons and development of novel X-ray detectors.

Sixty-six cases with suspected masses and calcifications were collected from 55 patients. Four different reconstructions of each image set were evaluated by four observers (two experienced radiologists, two experienced medical physicists) : filtered back projection (FBP), iterative adapted FBP (iFBP) and two ML-convex iterative algorithm (MLCI) reconstructions (8 and 10 iterations) that differed in noise level and <b>contrast</b> <b>of</b> clinical <b>details.</b> Representation <b>of</b> masses and microcalcifications was evaluated.

The results suggest that even though the FBP contains most noise its reconstructions are considered best overall, followed by iFBP, which contains least noise.
