40|$|Seamless {{garments}} {{are popular}} knitted products nowadays. They {{are widely used}} as power stretchable underwear, outerwear and sportswear for which the use of high elastic yarns is indispensable. For seamless garments knitted with circular seamless machines, polyurethane (PU) /polyamide (PA) <b>core-spun</b> yarn is commonly used as the base yarn in a plating fabric to enhance the elasticity of the garment. However, the use of PU/PA <b>core-spun</b> yarn has encountered some problems, such as the difficulty in size control and the ageing of PU elastic yarn. In this study, the polytrimethylene terephthalate (PTT) /polyester (PET) bi-component filament was used to replace the PU/PA <b>core-spun</b> yarn {{for the development of}} seamless garments due to its excellent extensibility and elastic recovery property. The manufacturing processes, including knitting, pre-treatment, dyeing and finishing, were developed, and the end-use performance of the fabrics, which were respectively produced with the PTT/PET bi-component filament and PU/PA <b>core-spun</b> yarn as the base yarn and PA fiber as the face yarn for seamless garments, was compared based on the five different mechanical and physical properties. The results show that the fabric made of the PTT/PET bi-component filament has much better dimensional stability, much better elastic recovery property and much better wrinkle resistance than those of the fabric made of PU/PA <b>core-spun</b> yarn. It is expected that this study could help us to further exploit the use of the PTT/PET bi-component filament in the development of seamless garments in the future.

40|$|In this study, we {{compared}} fiber trapping of embeddable and locatable spinning (ELS) {{with that of}} sirofil and siro core-spinning with flute pipe air suction. Online pictorial analysis showed that the 3 rd ELS was free of the visual fiber loss during the 1 st ELS, 2 nd ELS, sirofil, and siro core-spinning. This indicated the 3 rd ELS possessed high ability of trapping staple fibers. Weight loss of different yarns proved that the 3 rd ELS had a statistically higher fiber trapping capacity than 1 st ELS, sirofil and siro core-spinning. Yarn visual appearance results showed that filaments failed to be entirely buried in the siro <b>core-spun</b> yarn body due to the staple fiber loss and imperfect filament tension adjustment. Poor trapping and filament fasting of staple fibers might be the reasons for more hairy siro <b>core-spun</b> yarn than other composite yarns. Sirofil and siro <b>core-spun</b> yarn had higher value of coefficient of mass variation per unit yarn length and yarn imperfections than the 3 rd ELS yarn which might be probably due to their irregular fiber loss during the sirofil and siro core-spinning. The fiber loss {{would result in a}} decrease in yarn cross-section fiber utilization; therefore, sirofil, siro <b>core-spun</b> and the 1 st ELS yarn had a statistically lower tensile tenacity than the 3 rd ELS composite yarn. ...|$|E

Antibacterial yarns {{can be obtained from}} blending and combining of silver-coated fibers. Analysis of manufacturing process and cost shows that core-spinning and sirofil spinning are preferable. <b>Core-spun</b> yarns can be used in filling if silver color is not desired.

40|$|Graduation date: 1971 The major {{purposes}} of the research were {{to determine whether there}} were significant differences in breaking strength and elongation of the following types of seams in a polyester double-knit fabric: 1. seams stitched with threads of (a) mercerized cotton, (b) <b>core-spun</b> polyester/cotton, and (c) bonded nylon monocord. 2. seams stitched with (a) a narrow zigzag stitch, (b) a lockstitch made while stretching the fabric, and (c) an elastic straight stitch. 3. seams stitched (a) parallel to the wales and (b) parallel to the courses. 4. seams stitched with settings of (a) 9 stitches per inch, (b) 12 stitches per inch, and (c) 15 stitches per inch. Results indicated that the polyester/cotton <b>core-spun</b> thread produced seams with greater breaking strength and elongation than mercerized cotton thread for all comparable sets of specimens. Seams constructed with polyester/cotton <b>core-spun</b> thread also tended to exhibit greater seam breaking strength and elongation than those seamed with bonded nylon monocord thread. The nylon thread, in turn, tended to produce stronger and more extensible seams than did mercerized cotton thread. The elastic straight stitch (a triple lockstitch) produced seams with greater breaking strength and elongation than either of the other stitch types. Most seams stitched with the lockstitch with stretch had a higher mean seam breaking strength and elongation than comparable seams stitched with the zigzag stitch, Stitch length affected seam breaking strength and elongation to a greater extent with the zigzag than with the lockstitch with stretch. For most comparable sets of zigzag specimens, increases in the number of stitches per inch were accompanied by increases in seam breaking strength and elongation. With the lockstitch, those differences which were significant indicated that the shorter stitches were related to greater breaking strength and elongation. Seams parallel to the courses were related to greater seam breaking strength and elongation than seams parallel to the wales...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{the effect of}} twist, fiber characteristics and core/sheath ratio on the breakage types of <b>core-spun</b> yarns. The core yarns were spun on a modified ring spinning frame with a double-apron drafting system using five twist coefficients (αm) : 70, 85, 100, 115, and 130. There were used three different varieties of carded cotton as sheath material and 44 dtex/ 12 filaments nylon textured multifilament as core material. The core/sheath ratio was modified by spinning core yarns of different linear densities (25 tex, 20 tex, and 16. 66 tex. In order to ensure good core coverage, the core ratio did not exceed 30 %...|$|E
40|$|Enzymatic {{hydrolysis}} {{of cotton}} fabrics with different weft yarns has been studied. The weft yarns used were commercial cotton yarns {{produced by the}} carded, combed, open-end, air-jet and <b>core-spun</b> systems. The effects of cellulases hydrolysis on different fabrics were investigated by measuring the weight loss, the amount of glucose released and the breaking load of weft yarns. The {{results showed that the}} weight loss and concentration of glucose in hydrolysis vary with the increase of yarn hairiness. Loss of breaking load in shorter treatment times was related to hairiness of weft yams but in longer enzymatic hydrolysis times, strength loss was affected by the amount of glucose released.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{an insight into}} the mechanism of breakage of <b>core-spun</b> yarns and {{the contribution of the}} components to the yarn breaking strength. The study was made on cotton covered/nylon filament core yarn of 25 tex linear density produced at different twists. The load-extension curves showed three types ofbreakages. At low twist, the fibers slip along the filament core and mainly the filament yarn supports the effort. The breakage of this nature was named high elongation breakage. At medium twist, the sheath destroys first, and then the core filament breakage occurs too. The breakage of this nature was named structural breakage. At high twists, a simultaneous breakage of cotton fibers and nylon multifilament occurs...|$|E
40|$|The present paper envisages the multi-response {{optimization}} {{of certain}} factors like elastane linear density, fabric thread density and weave float on some mechanical, (i. e. stretch %, recovery %) and comfort (i. e. air permeability) properties of bi-stretch woven fabrics, under L 18 orthogonal array in Taguchi design. Fabric samples were produced using elastane <b>core-spun</b> cotton yarns {{both in the}} warp and weft. The elastane linear density, fabric thread density and weave float size were used as predictor variables, while fabric air permeability, stretch and recovery were taken as response variables. Two different elastane linear densities, i. e. 44 dtex and 78 dtex, 3 different thread densities and 3 different weave designs, i. e. 1 / 1 plain, 2 / 2 z-twill and 3 / 3 z-twill were used. The results have been analysed using grey relational analysis for the identification of an optimum level of process factors. Furthermore, using analysis of variance method, significant contributions of predictor variables were determined...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In this paper,the 5 {{types of}} fabrics were knitted by plain-plated, 1 + 1 and 1 + 3 float-plated, 1 + 1 and 2 + 2 tuck-plate stitch and density P 6,which {{are made of}} cooldry {{absorption}} and quick-drying polyester yarns as the facing yarn and the <b>core-spun</b> spandex yarn of nylon as the ground yarns. The absorption and quick-drying were tested and analyzed. The significance of influence of fabric textures and stretch on absorption and quick-drying was analyzed by means of two variance analysis. Results show that the influence of texture and stretch on absorption and quick-drying are significant. The absorption and spreading speed and the accumulative one-way transport capacity of 1 + 3 and 1 + 1 float-plated and 2 + 2 tuck-plated fabric are bigger. As the fabric texture is the same, the absorption and spreading speed are smaller and the accumulative one-way transport capacity are worse {{with the increase of}} fabrics stretch. The research results can provide a certain reference for the design & development and choice of seamless underwear...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the effect of elastane linear density, thread density, and weave float on the stretch, recovery, and compression properties of bi-stretch woven fabrics for compression garments. Fabric samples were produced using elastane <b>core-spun</b> cotton yarns both in the warp and weft. The elastane linear density, fabric thread density, and weave float size were used as input variables while fabric contraction, subgarment pressure, fabric stretch, and recovery were taken as response variables. Two different elastane linear densities, i. e. 44 and 78 dtex, two different thread densities, and three different weave designs, i. e. 1 / 1 plain, 2 / 2 z-twill, and 3 / 3 z-twill were used. The results of fabric samples were analyzed in Minitab statistical software. The coefficients of determinations (R-sq values) of the regression equations showed good prediction ability of the developed statistical models. The findings of the study may be helpful in deciding appropriate manufacturing specifications of bi-stretch fabrics to attain specific stretch, recovery, and compression properties...|$|E
30|$|As per the {{stitches}} selected; lock-stitch 301 and chain-stitch 401, recommended thread {{types of}} poly/poly <b>core-spun</b> threads (with polyester continuous filament core and polyester staple wrap) were used. Yarn {{count of the}} thread was taken instead of the thread ticket number value to minimize the approximation errors occurring in ticket number calculations. Fabric thickness was measured following the test standard of BS 2544, methods for determination of thickness of textile materials (British standards institution 1987). Yarn counts of threads were measured using ASTM D 1907, standard method of test for yarn number by the skein method (ASTM International 1997). Thread consumption and average thread tension were measured using MLT Wesco tension and length meter with the accuracy up to 1  mm and 0.1 cN respectively. Consumption values measured using length meter were verified through stitch unraveling method. Actual thread lengths were measured using crimp tester adhering to the procedures in the test standard ASTM D 3883, standard test method for yarn crimp and yarn take-up in woven fabrics (ASTM International 2012). All the tension values were measured at the positions closer the needle as specified in the tension meter manual.|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} design {{high-quality}} threads, {{it is necessary}} to know the properties of threads and fibers, as well as the loadings and deformations which may occur during the sewing process. Thread properties depend on the mechanical properties of the fiber and the constructional parameters of the thread and its surface treatment, which directly influence sewing performance. The mechanical properties of a thread primarily depend on the fiber mechanical properties and the amount of twist. Knowledge of the thread dynamic loadings during the sewing process, depending on the number of turns and the lubrication method, is important for planning the required processing properties of the thread. This paper presents research into the influence of thread twist and the lubrication method on the mechanical properties and dynamic load of PES <b>core-spun</b> thread and its fibers. Research into the mechanical properties of the different twisted and surface treated threads, and separated fibers was carried out for this purpose. The influence of threaddynamic load during a sewing process was also researched regarding any alterations in the mechanical properties of the threads and separated fibers. Analyses of the results show that the amount of twist depends on the mechanical properties of the thread and its constituent fibers, whilst the method of surface treatment is based on the specific mechanical properties of the thread. A dynamic load causes greater or smaller thread deformations, which is reflected in changes in the thread and fiber mechanical properties. The occurred changes depend on dynamic load, amount of twist, and the lubrication method, which is confirmed with statistical analysis of the measured results...|$|E
