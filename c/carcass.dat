5|$|Although it locates food by vision, {{the role}} smell has {{in how it}} {{specifically}} finds carrion has been debated. Consensus has been {{that it does not}} detect odours, and instead follows the smaller turkey and greater yellow-headed vultures, which do have a sense of smell, to a <b>carcass,</b> but a 1991 study demonstrated that the king vulture could find carrion in the forest without the aid of other vultures, suggesting that it locates food using an olfactory sense. The king vulture primarily eats carrion found in the forest, though it is known to venture onto nearby savannas in search of food. Once it has found a <b>carcass,</b> the king vulture displaces the other vultures because of its large size and strong bill. However, when it is at the same kill as the larger Andean condor, the king vulture always defers to it. Using its bill to tear, it makes the initial cut in a fresh <b>carcass.</b> This allows the smaller, weaker-beaked vultures, which can not open the hide of a <b>carcass,</b> access to the <b>carcass</b> after the king vulture has fed. The vulture’s tongue is rasp-like, which allows it to pull flesh off of the carcass’s bones. Generally, it only eats the skin and harder parts of the tissue of its meal. The king vulture has also been recorded eating fallen fruit of the moriche palm when carrion is scarce in Bolívar state, Venezuela.|$|E

Whole <b>carcasses</b> lost significantly less weight than did cut-up <b>carcasses.</b> Carbon dioxide (C 02) -chilled <b>carcasses</b> lost less weight than did standard-immersion-chilled <b>carcasses,</b> because {{they picked up}} less water in the chilling process. The superficial freezing on C 02 -chilled <b>carcasses</b> delayed microbial growth and resulted in slightly longer shelf-life of C 02 -chilled <b>carcasses</b> than of those immersion chilled, particularly when comparisons were at higher refrigerated storage temperatures. <b>Carcasses</b> stored at 3. 9 C (39 F) had strong off odors by about 9 days of storage; at 1. 0 C (34 F) by about 14 days; and at- 2. 2 C (28 F) by about 35 days.

40|$|Little {{information}} was {{available on the}} forensically important specimens collected from <b>carcasses</b> in indoor and different ecological habitats in Malaysia. This study was attempted to determine the arthropod succession on <b>carcasses</b> (1) placed in different ecological habitats, such as lowland forested area, coastal area and montane forested area; (2) placed in indoor and outdoor conditions; and (3) <b>carcasses</b> being incinerated, submerged in freshwater river, and treated with insecticide {{and its effect on}} post mortem interval (PMI) estimation. <b>Carcasses</b> placed outdoor and indoor underwent 5 decomposition stages namely, fresh, bloating, decay, advanced decay and remains/dry. Decomposition duration on <b>carcasses</b> placed in indoor was prolonged, in comparison to outdoor in lowland forested and coastal areas by 1. 67 to 2. 73 folds, but not in montane forested area. There were no activity and oviposition of forensically important flies during nocturnal period. Flies activity were observed to be active from about 30 minutes after sunrise throughout the day until 10 minutes after sunset. There was no delay on flies oviposition on <b>carcasses</b> placed outdoor in all ecological habitats. However, there was at least a 1 day delay on PMI estimation on <b>carcasses</b> placed indoor in coastal area. It {{is interesting to note that}} there was a 3 days delay in PMI estimation on <b>carcasses</b> placed indoor in both lowland and montane forested areas. This study revealed the time required for blow flies to perceive the body and enter indoor to oviposit in three different ecological habitats. Our results established the time required to be added to estimate larval age to approach a realistic PMI estimation in this region. Oviposition of flies on <b>carcasses,</b> besides being used for PMI estimation, can also serve as geographical indicator: (1) Lucilia porphyrina was exclusively found in montane forested area; (2) Chrysomya nigripes was a strictly outdoor species and only invaded <b>carcasses</b> in lowland forested area; and (3) Chrysomya chani was only found invading <b>carcasses</b> placed in outdoor and indoor in lowland forested area. Study conducted on incinerated <b>carcasses</b> emphasizes that: (1) incineration effect does not deter the arrival and oviposition of flies; (2) incineration effect does not make any difference in the fauna succession pattern between incinerated and non-incinerated <b>carcasses,</b> with succession sequence from Calliphoridae, Sarcophagidae and Muscidae; and (3) decomposition rates on incinerated <b>carcasses</b> were faster than non-incinerated <b>carcasses.</b> Study conducted on <b>carcasses</b> submerged in freshwater river emphasizes that: (1) PMI estimation on <b>carcasses</b> submerged in freshwater river was delayed by a minimum period of 2 days; (2) there was no difference in the fauna succession pattern between <b>carcasses</b> submerged in freshwater river and placed outdoor, with the succession sequence from Calliphoridae, Sarcophagidae and Muscidae; (3) Chrysomya megacephala was the dominant adult flies observed visiting the <b>carcasses,</b> but only Ch. pinguis and Hemipyrelia spp. were found to be dominant maggots colonizing the carcasses; and (4) decomposition rates of <b>carcasses</b> submerged in freshwater river were slower than <b>carcasses</b> placed outdoor. Study conducted on <b>carcasses</b> treated with insecticide concluded that malathion repelled and delayed the insect invasions of the <b>carcasses,</b> especially flies for at least 7 days. Ants (Order: Hymenoptera) were reported occurring in all decomposition stages, and were not significant indicator for <b>carcasses</b> succession or PMI estimation. Beetles (Order: Coleoptera) were observed visiting the monkey <b>carcasses</b> in lowland and montane forested areas, and their succession on different decomposition stages were determined. No beetles were observed visiting <b>carcasses</b> placed in coastal area. More species of beetles were found in indoor than outdoor.

Over a 2 -month period, 278 <b>carcasses</b> from straight-run flocks of 43 - to 48 -d-old Cobb broilers from two different farms were condemned due to cachexia and subjected to gross examination in the final inspection sector. Out of the 278 <b>carcasses,</b> 131 did not present any gross signs of infection, and were submitted to microbiological analyses (n= 83), physicochemical analyses (n= 28), and viscera and muscle samples of 20 <b>carcasses</b> were evaluated by histology.

The lesser yellow-headed vulture will no longer feed on a piece of carrion once the meat {{is in a state of}} extreme decay, as it becomes contaminated with microbial toxins. Like other vultures, it plays an important role in its ecosystem by disposing of carrion which would otherwise be a breeding ground for disease.|$|E
5|$|A single {{spotted hyena}} can eat at least 14.5kg of meat per meal. Although spotted hyenas act aggressively {{toward each other}} when feeding, they {{compete with each other}} mostly through speed of eating, rather than by {{fighting}} as lions do. When feeding on an intact <b>carcass,</b> spotted hyenas will first consume the meat around the loins and anal region, then open the abdominal cavity and pull out the soft organs. Once the stomach, its wall and contents are consumed, the hyenas will eat the lungs and abdominal and leg muscles. Once the muscles have been eaten, the <b>carcass</b> is disassembled and the hyenas carry off pieces to eat in peace. Spotted hyenas are adept at eating their prey in water: they have been observed to dive under floating carcasses to take bites, then resurface to swallow. A single hyena can take less than two minutes in eating a gazelle fawn, while a group of 35 hyenas can completely consume an adult zebra in 36 minutes. Spotted hyenas do not require much water, and typically only spend 30 seconds drinking.|$|E
5|$|A {{study from}} Currie, Horner, Erickson and Longrich in 2010 {{has been put}} forward as {{evidence}} of cannibalism in the genus Tyrannosaurus. They studied some Tyrannosaurus specimens with tooth marks in the bones, attributable to the same genus.

In a fight, they proposed {{it would be difficult}} to reach down to bite in the feet of a rival, making it more likely that the bite marks were made in a <b>carcass.</b> As the bite marks were made in body parts with relatively scanty amounts of flesh, it is suggested that the Tyrannosaurus was feeding on a <b>carcass</b> in which the more fleshy parts had already been consumed.

5|$|Charig and Milner {{presented}} a possible scenario explaining the taphonomy (changes during fossilisation) of the B. walkeri holotype specimen. The fine-grained sediments around the skeleton, {{and the fact}} that the bones were found close together (skull and forelimb elements at one end of the excavation area and the pelvis and hind-limb elements at the other), indicates that the environment was quiet at the time of fossilisation and water currents did not carry the <b>carcass</b> far—possibly because the water was shallow. The area where the specimen died seems to have been suitable for a piscivorous animal. It may have caught fish and scavenged on the mud plain, becoming mired before it died and was buried. Since the bones are well-preserved and had no gnaw marks, the <b>carcass</b> appears to have been undisturbed by scavengers (suggesting that it was quickly covered by sediment). The disarticulation of the bones may have been the result of soft-tissue decomposition. Parts of the skeleton seem to have weathered to different degrees, perhaps because water levels changed or the sediments shifted (exposing parts of the skeleton). The girdle and limb bones, the dentary, and a rib were broken before fossilisation, perhaps from trampling by large animals while buried. The orientation of the bones indicates that the <b>carcass</b> lay on its back, which may explain why all the lower teeth had fallen out of their sockets and some upper teeth were still in place.|$|E
