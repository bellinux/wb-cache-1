5|$|Helicoverpa zea earns its {{nickname}} the <b>corn</b> <b>earworm</b> for its {{widely known}} destruction of cornfields. The <b>corn</b> <b>earworm</b> feeds on {{every part of}} corn, including the kernels. Severe feeding {{at the tip of}} kernels allows entry for diseases and mold growth. Larvae begin feeding on the kernels once they have reached third instar. Larvae penetrate 9 to 15cm into the ear, with deeper penetration occurring as the kernels harden. Larvae do not eat the hard kernels, but take bites out of many kernels, lowering the quality of the corn for processing.|$|E
5|$|The <b>corn</b> <b>earworm</b> {{is found}} in {{temperate}} and tropical regions of North America, {{with the exception of}} northern Canada and Alaska as it cannot overwinter in these areas. Helicoverpa zea found in the eastern United States also does not overwinter successfully. They live in Kansas, Ohio, Virginia, and southern New Jersey, but survival rate is mainly affected by the severity of the winter. <b>Corn</b> <b>earworm</b> moths regularly migrate from southern regions to northern regions depending on winter conditions. They are also found in Hawaii, the Caribbean islands, and most of South America, including Peru, Argentina, and Brazil.|$|E
5|$|Two {{kinds of}} control {{measures}} have been advocated since the 19th century. One aims at total pest population reduction, while the other is aimed at protection of the particular crop. , integrated pest management (IPM), an array of techniques and approaches to control pests, was recommended. Practices such as deep ploughing, mechanical destruction, and trap crops are also used to kill different instars. Chemical control is widely successful, and includes the use of applying mineral oil inside the tip of each corn ear, which suffocates the young larvae. Pesticides are one method by which <b>corn</b> <b>earworm</b> populations are controlled; however, since they have been widely used, the insects have become resistant to many pesticides. The use of biological controls, such as the bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis and various forms of nematodes, is also common, although not without their own problems. <b>Corn</b> <b>earworm</b> moths are not always vulnerable to the bacterium, and they are only afflicted by nematodes once the larvae have pupated and dropped to the ground.|$|E
40|$|Several {{people have}} inquired about the {{caterpillars}} now feeding inside corn whorls. The likely candidates are stalk borers, European corn borers, or <b>corn</b> <b>earworms.</b> Armyworms {{feed on the}} outside of the whorl and fall armyworms have not yet arrived. Specimens that have been sent to me, however, have all been <b>corn</b> <b>earworms.</b> Correct identification of any insect is necessary before a wise pest management decision can be made...|$|R
50|$|Insect and {{diseases}} are not prevalent in sorghum crops. Birds, however, {{are a major}} source of yield loss. Hybrids with higher tannin content and growing the crop in large field blocks are solutions used to combat the birds. The crop may also be attacked by <b>corn</b> <b>earworms,</b> aphids, and some Lepidoptera larvae, including turnip moths.|$|R
5000|$|Understanding {{the biology}} and {{life cycle of}} the pest is also an {{important}} factor in determining droplet size. The Agricultural Research Service, for example, has conducted tests to determine the ideal droplet size of a pesticide used to combat <b>corn</b> <b>earworms.</b> They found that in order to be effective, the pesticide needs to penetrate through the corn’s silk, where the earworm’s larvae hatch. The research concluded that larger pesticide droplets best penetrated the targeted corn silk. [...] Knowing where the pest's destruction originates is crucial in targeting the amount of pesticide needed.|$|R
5|$|Helicoverpa zea, {{commonly}} known as the <b>corn</b> <b>earworm,</b> is a species (formerly in the genus Heliothis) in the family Noctuidae. The larva of the moth Helicoverpa zea is a major agricultural pest. Since it is polyphagous (feeds on many different plants) during the larval stage, the species has been given many different common names, including the cotton bollworm and the tomato fruitworm. It also consumes a wide variety of other crops.|$|E
5|$|The <b>corn</b> <b>earworm</b> {{is a major}} {{agricultural}} pest, with a large {{host range}} encompassing corn and many other crop plants. H. zea is the second-most important economic pest species in North America, next to the codling moth. The estimated annual cost of the damage is more than US$100 million, though expenditure on insecticide application has reached up to $250 million. The moth’s high fecundity, ability to lay between 500 and 3,000 eggs, polyphagous larval feeding habits, high mobility during migration, and a facultative pupal diapause {{have led to the}} success of this pest.|$|E
5|$|Female moths are {{attracted}} to flowering soybean fields. The most severe infestations occur between flowering and when pods become fully developed. Large-scale outbreak is associated with time of peak flowering, when most pods are developed, and peak moth flight, for giant. Moths are also attracted to drought stressed soybeans or fields with poor growth. Dry weather leads to quick drying of corn plants, compelling moths to leave and seek other hosts. Heavy rainfall also decreases <b>corn</b> <b>earworm</b> populations because it drowns pupae in their soil chambers, limits moth flight, washes eggs from leaves, and creates favorable conditions for fungal diseases that kill caterpillars.|$|E
40|$|Sorghum (Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench) brown midrib (bmr) mutant {{lines have}} reduced levels of lignin, {{which is a}} {{potentially}} useful trait for bioenergy production, but {{the effects of this}} trait on insect and plant pathogen interactions are unknown under field conditions. Field-grown bmr 6, bmr 12, and wild-type (WT) plants were examined for insect and disease damage. In most cases, observed frequency, population, or leaf area damage caused by insects or pathogens on bmr 6 or bmr 12 plants were not greater than those observed on WT plants in the field or laboratory assays. European corn borers [Ostrinia nubilalis (Hübner) (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae) ] often caused lower amounts of leaf damage to bmr 6 leaves compared to bmr 12 and sometimes WT leaves in the field study. Leaf damage by <b>corn</b> <b>earworms</b> [Helicoverpa zea (Boddie) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) ] and fall armyworms [Spodoptera frugiperda (J. E. Smith) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) ] in laboratory assays was often lower for bmr versus WT leaves. Incidence of disease lesions was significantly higher on bmr 6 compared to WT plants for one of three samplings in 2011, but the opposite trend was observed overall in 2012 and no significant differences were noted in 2013. When <b>corn</b> <b>earworms</b> and fall armyworms were fed the excised pith, bmr 6 and/or bmr 12 pith caused significant morality to one or both insect species in all 3 years. Damage variability between the 3 years may have been due to hotter and drier than normal conditions in 2012. Thus, bmr lines of sorghum suitable for bioenergy production have potential for sustainable production in the field...|$|R
5|$|Helicoverpa zea {{has a wide}} host range, attacking {{vegetables}} that include corn, tomato, artichoke, asparagus, cabbage, cantaloupe, collards, cowpea, cucumber, eggplant, lettuce, lima bean, melon, okra, pea, pepper, potato, pumpkin, snap bean, spinach, squash, sweet potato, and watermelon. However, {{not all of these}} are good hosts. While corn and lettuce are shown to be great hosts, tomatoes are less beneficial, and broccoli and cantaloupe are poor hosts. Corn and sorghum are most favored by <b>corn</b> <b>earworms.</b> Various signs reveal the presence of these moths. Young maize crops have holes in their leaves, following whorl-feeding on the apical leaf. Eggs can be found on silks on larger plants, and silks display grazing evidence. The soft, milky grains in the top few centimeters of corn cobs are eaten as the corn ears develop. One larva per cob can be observed. Bore holes are observed in cabbage and lettuce hearts, flower heads, cotton bolls, and tomato fruits. Sorghum heads are grazed, and legume pod seeds are eaten.|$|R

Four laboratory bioassays, including 1) proboscis extension and 2) gustatory response, 3) lethal concentration, and 4) mean lethal time to mortality, were used to investigate the effects of seventeen insecticides mixed with two sugar feeding stimulants on feeding behavior and mortality of pheromone trap captured adult male <b>corn</b> <b>earworms,</b> Helicoverpa zea (Boddie), to screen and evaluate toxicants for use in an attracticide formulation. Commercially-available formulations of acephate, boric acid, carbaryl, chlorpyrifos, cyfluthrin, cypermethrin, DDVP, dimethoate, endosulfan, imidacloprid, lambda-cyhalothrin, malathion, methomyl, oxamyl, profenofos, sulprofos, and thiodicarb, mixed with two concentrations of sucrose and fi-uctose feeding stimulants at toxicant concentrations up to 10, 000 ppm AI (I%) (wt:vol), were evaluated for proboscis extension response. Data from this bioassay indicate that none of these insecticides inhibited proboscis extension below 100 ppm Al concentrations. The same test mixtures were evaluated for gustatory response. Response inhibition varied between toxicants, but most insecticides elicited no significant inhibition of gustatory response at toxicant concentrations causing mortality, Acephate, carbaryl, lambda-cyhalothrin, malathion, methomyl, profenofos, and thiodicarb mixed with 2. 5 M sucrose were evaluated for toxicity to adult male <b>corn</b> <b>earworms</b> via ingestion. Twenty-four hr LCggs are ranked as follows: thiodicarb 2. 0 ppm Al) < methomyl (2. 5) < lambda-cyhalothrin (4. 4) < profenofos (8. 4) < acephate (12. 3) < malathion (58. 2) < carbaryl (73. 0).

From agricultural and horticulture perspectives, the two categories of nematodes are the predatory ones, which will kill garden pests like cutworms and <b>corn</b> <b>earworm</b> moths, and the pest nematodes, like the root-knot nematode, which attack plants, and those that act as vectors spreading plant viruses between crop plants. Predatory nematodes can be bred by soaking a specific recipe of leaves and other detritus in water, in a dark, cool place, and can even be purchased as an organic form of pest control.|$|E

40|$|We {{examined}} the feeding behavior of red-winged blackbirds (Agelaius phoeniceus) and European starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) on ears of corn (Zea mavs) artificially infested with <b>corn</b> <b>earworms</b> (Helicoverpa zea). In 30 -minute aviary tests, redwings and starlings directed 39 to 79 % more feeding responses to ears of corn with worms than to ears without worms but they damaged the same proportion of ears {{with and without}} worms. In 3 -hour aviary tests and a field evaluation, birds damaged more ears with worms than without worms. In spite of more feeding responses directed to ears with worms, the overall damage (number of kernels eaten by birds) was similar in both groups of ears in aviary tests. Our findings indicate that earworms can influence feeding behavior by redwings and starlings on ears of corn. The results generally {{support the hypothesis that}} by reducing insect populations in cornfields, one can make the fields less attractive to birds. Also, because redwings and starlings actively sought <b>earworms</b> in <b>corn</b> ears, these abundant birds have the potential for reducing populations of these insect pests in cornfields...|$|R

40|$|The {{presence}} of lignin within biomass impedes {{the production of}} liquid fuels. Plants with altered lignin content and composition are more amenable to lignocellulosic conversion to ethanol and other biofuels but may be more susceptible to insect damage where lignin is an important resistance factor. However, reduced lignin lines of switchgrasses still retained insect resistance in prior studies. Therefore, we hypothesized that sorghum lines with lowered lignin content will also retain insect resistance. Sorghum excised leaves and stalk pith Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench (Poales: Poaceae) from near isogenic brown midrib (bmr) 6 and 12 mutants lines, which have lowered lignin content and increased lignocellulosic ethanol conversion efficiency, were examined for insect resistance relative to wild-type (normal BTx 623). Greenhouse and growth chamber grown plant tissues were fed to first-instar larvae of <b>corn</b> <b>earworms,</b> Helicoverpa zea (Boddie) and fall armyworms Spodoptera frugiperda (J. E. Smith) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), two sorghum major pests. Younger bmr leaves had significantly greater feeding damage in some assays than wild-type leaves, but older bmr 6 leaves generally had significantly less damage than wild-type leaves. Caterpillars feeding on the bmr 6 leaves often weighed significantly less than those feeding on wild-type leaves, especially in the S. frugiperda assays. Larvae fed the pith from bmr stalks had significantly higher mortality compared with those larvae fed on wild-type pith, which suggested that bmr pith was more toxic. Thus, reducing lignin content or changing subunit composition of bioenergy grasses does not necessarily increase their susceptibility to insects and may result in increased resistance, which would contribute to sustainable production...|$|R

500|$|As {{the larvae}} mature, they become {{increasingly}} aggressive. Although they have host plants surrounding them, H. zea larvae attack and eat other insects. When {{presented with a}} second-instar larva of Urbanus proteus, the <b>corn</b> <b>earworm</b> larva grasps the insect, rolls onto its side to form a semicircle, and begins feeding on the insect's posterior end. If the U. proteus begins to bite out of defense, H. zea rotates the larva 180° and uses its mandibles to puncture the head capsule, killing the insect. Then, the H. zea larva [...] rotates the U. proteus back to its original position and continues feeding until the insect is entirely consumed. Even when presented with up to five U. proteus larvae, H. zea engages in the unique behavior, as the larvae have a higher affinity for lepidopterous prey over plant material. H. zea raised in a low-moisture environment has a lower pupal weight and a longer developmental time than those raised in environments of high moisture, so a nutritional benefit exists to such aggressive feeding behavior under such conditions.|$|E
