Recently, charge <b>carrier</b> <b>holes</b> in low dimensions were actively investigated in connection with development of information technology and possibility of spintronic devices. This work considers infrared transitions of charge <b>carrier</b> <b>holes</b> in GaAs like or Ge like quantum wells. While in recent years a simplified treatment of holes in low dimensions became quite common, such treatment can give misleading results. However, there exist an analytical approach to spectrum of holes in low dimensions, that can shed light on the possibility of potential applications of hole structures to various devices. Until our work this method has been mostly restricted to ground state of holes, which is a state with the heavy hole mass describing motion of holes along the growth axis aligned with the crystallographic direction [001]. Here we significantly expanded the power of this analytical method y considering the first excited state of holes with heavy effective mass along [001] direction, and the state of holes described by light effective mass along [001] direction with the lowest energy. ...|$|E

Enthalpy stabilized interstitial oxygen anions are shown to be the main source of p-type electronic conductivity, without reducing the spontaneous ferroelectric polarization. A low energy barrier interstitialcy mechanism is inferred from Density Functional Theory calculations to be the microscopic migration path of Oi.

40|$|The {{knowledge}} of the majority carrier mobility in silicon {{as a function of}} dopant density is of utmost importance for a correct quantitative evaluation of a variety of lifetime measurements. However, only for monocrystalline silicon doped with either boron (concentration NA) or phosphorus (concentration ND), sufficient reliable experimental data exists as well as good models. In the presence of both dopants, in so called compensated silicon, a reduced mobility is expected. It seems that the model of Klaassen provides acceptable values for the mobility in lowly compensated monocrystalline silicon as a function of NA + ND [1]. For more strongly compensated monocrystalline silicon and for multicrystalline silicon, it is not sure if this model is still applicable. In this contribution, the conductivity mobility of majority <b>carrier</b> <b>holes</b> as well as the Hall mobility in compensated and non-compensated multicrystalline (mc) p-type silicon is investigated and compared with the established mobility models {{as well as with the}} data from monocrystalline silicon...|$|E

The structure was described as a semi-crystalline with order crystalline in the core surrounded by amorphous edge. The doped central crystalline is metallic conductivity in nature, amorphous region has disordered or fold polymer chains which are lower in conductivity and the total conductivity of PANI is restrained by the disordered area [127]. As for which, the total conductivity of PANI depends on the percentage of crystallinity molecular weight molecular arrangement and degree of doping [128]. Mechanism of conductivity was attributed to polaron structure that is formed by nitrogen radicals, which act as charge <b>carrier</b> <b>holes.</b> Except for acids polyaniline could also be n-doped by strong reductant KH or NaH [129]. More recently, carbon nanotubes were proved to be doping agent for PANI [130, 131]. The SWCNT/PANI nanocomposite processed good electrochemical activity in neutral and alkaline media. SWCNTs were considered pristine as potential dopant to preserve the electrochemical property of PANI effectively in the neutral and alkaline media.|$|E

40|$|Even if p-type silicon is a {{more common}} PV material, {{heterojunction}} solar cells on p-type c-Si are less popular than on n-type. In turn, it {{has been difficult to}} achieve high efficiency with double-sided heterojunction with intrinsic thin layer structure on p-type c-Si. The double-sided silicon heterojunction solar cell is more appropriate for n-type crystalline silicon wafers than for p-type c-Si ones because of larger band offset at the valence band edge between the amorphous and crystalline semiconductors with respect to the conduction band edge. Indeed, it represents a large barrier for majority <b>carrier</b> <b>holes</b> flowing through to the back contact. In turn at the backside, the small conduction band offset provides a much less effective mirror for the minority carrier electrons. We have found an alternative way to obtain a quasi-ohmic contact promoting the formation of a CrSi film on top of p-a-Si:H layer. This reduces the problem of low p-a-Si:H doping value and the high activation energy, leading to a better carrier collection. In this work we present a detailed investigation of the p-c-Si/i-a-Si:H/p-a-Si:H contact, comparing the experimental transport measurements with numerical model of the stacked structure. We verify the effectiveness of p-c-Si/i-a-Si:H/p-a-Si:H as back side contact on the heterojunction solar cell performances. © 2011 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim...|$|E

The spectral response of these structures exhibits two maximum values of quantum efficiency. The first maximum is presented at wavelength λ≅ 525 nm and the other at λ= 850 850 nm, which are attributed to the Aa-SiC:H Schottky junction and the a-SiC:H/c-Si(n) isotype heterojunction, respectively. The position of the first maximum owing to the Al/a-SiC:H junction {{as well as the}} values of quantum efficiency, for the range of wavelengths from 350 nm up to 700 nm, depends on the substrate temperature, Ts, of the a-SiC:H thin film.

Behavior of reverse recovery storage time (t(s)) {{as a function of}} initial ON-state forward current (I(F)) and OFF-state reverse current (I(R)) followed well-documented trends which have been observed for decades in silicon p-n rectifiers. Average minority <b>carrier</b> (<b>hole)</b> lifetimes (tau(p)) calculated from plots of t(s) vs I(R) /I(F) strongly decreased with decreasing device area. Bulk and perimeter components of average hole lifetimes were separated by plotting 1 /tau(p) as a function of device perimeter-to- area ratio (P/A). This plot reveals that perimeter recombination is dominant in these devices, whose areas are all less than 1 sq mm. The bulk minority <b>carrier</b> (<b>hole)</b> lifetime extracted from the 1 /tau(p) vs P/A plot is approximately 0. 7 micro-s, well above the 60 ns to 300 ns average iit'eptimes obtained when perimeter recombination effects are ignored in the analysis.
