40|$|This {{abstract}} {{reports the}} processing of shredder hammer tips, and metallurgical aspects related to improve the life prolonging factors that can achieve maximum <b>crushing</b> <b>ratio</b> and increase the preparatory index. An investigation conducted on typical shredder hammer tips revealed the cutting edges getting worn out in service because the sugarcane is typically mixed with silica sand and rocks. This leads to enhanced erosion, and increased abrasion and impact causing catastrophic failures. In extreme cases a composite comprising sintered carbide vacuum fused between a mild steel backup plate and a high chrome alloy powder block, {{is used as a}} replaceable tip. This geometry acts as a twin cutter, where the initial compressive load is divided by the top sintered alloy, which enables the tungsten carbide to take the balance load with much higher efficiency, better cutting ratio and longer edge retention. The geometry also considerably enhances the resistance to cracking. As per the performance reported by M/s Godavari Sugar Mill, Sameerwadi, the tool exhibited a life exceeding 950 000 tons of cane...|$|E

The physicochemical and compressional properties (using density measurements and the Heckel and Kawakita equations) of modified Chinese yam starch were determined, and its quantitative effects as a binder on the mechanical and release properties of chloroquine phosphate {{were analyzed using}} a 2 ³ full factorial design. The nature (X 1), concentration of starch (X 2) and packing fraction (X 3) were taken as independent variables and the <b>crushing</b> strength-friability <b>ratio</b> (CSFR), disintegration time (DT) and dissolution time (t 80) as dependent variables. Acid-modified Chinese yam starch showed a marked reduction (p< 0. 05) in amylose content and viscosity but increased swelling and water-binding properties. The modified starch had a faster onset and greater amount of plastic flow. Changing the binder from native to acid-modified form led to significant increases (p< 0. 05) in CSFR and DT but a decrease in t 80. An increase in binder concentration and packing fraction gave similar results for CSFR and DT only. These results suggest that acid-modified Chinese yam starches may be useful as tablet binders when high bond strength and fast dissolution are required...|$|R

The cell wall angle varies from 15 to 75 degrees while a regular hexagonal honeycomb possesses a cell wall angle of 30 degrees. Three different impact velocities 10, 60 and 100 m s(- 1) are involved. The crushing strengths of honeycombs with various cell wall angles but the same density are compared. The {{results show that the}} crushing strength of honeycombs is enhanced with increasing impact velocities for both x directional impact and y directional impact. The <b>crushing</b> strength <b>ratio</b> of y directional impact to x directional impact is sensitive to cell wall angle at lower impact velocities, while it approaches 1 for various cell wall angles at a high impact velocity of 100 m s(- 1). The cell shape has significant influence on the crushing strength of honeycombs in both x directional impact and y directional impact at low impact velocities, in which the crushing strength can be diminished to only 10 % of that of the regular honeycomb. However, this influence is weakened sharply with increasing impact velocity. Comparatively, the influence of cell shape on the x directional crushing strength is more significant than that in the y direction...|$|R

Experimental tests were conducted with standard sized samples of 190 × 57 × 90 mm (KS F 4004), and this manufacturing technique was simulated in practice. Results showed that the zero-cement brick with 0. 35 W/B had the highest compressive strength, but the lowest absorption ratio.

40|$|In this work, {{a steady}} state {{simulation}} of a fertilizer granulation circuit is developed {{in order to}} study strategies for reducing the recycle ratio and improving circuit control. A two-stage population balance model for the continuous granulation drum is developed. This {{is based on an}} experimentally observed mechanism of granulation. Models developed for the screen and crusher units are validated against data from an operating granulation plant. Unit models are then used to develop a steady state simulation of the entire granulation circuit. Several case studies are performed to illustrate the effect of changing granulation model parameters, crusher and screen operating characteristics on circuit performance. Recycle ratio goes through a minimum as liquid content in the granulation drum increases. Operation is very sensitive near the liquid content where a second stage of granulation, which broadens the granule size distribution, begins. Multiple steady states are observed under some conditions, these are related to variations in granule porosity with recycle granule size distribution. A reduction in binder viscosity or granulation drum residence time improves circuit stability. Circuit operation is very sensitive to the efficiency of the crushing and screening station. Efficient <b>crushing</b> reduces recycle <b>ratios</b> at high liquid content and also improves circuit stability.

40|$|Abstract-Analysis of Rb-Sr isotopic and {{elemental}} {{signatures of}} fluid inclusions is technically demand-ing, but it offers enormous potential in elucidating the timing, sources, and geochemical reaction paths of fluids in the Crust. Fluid inclusions of known isotopic and elemental ratios have been synthesized in quartz {{to serve as}} control samples. With these standards, two previously used fluid extraction procedures for bulk quartz samples have been evaluated and improved: crushing in a mortar followed by leaching and thermal decrepitation followed by leaching. Our experiments on quartz show that 87 Sr/ 8 hSr analysis is straightforward using both methods, regardless of the leaching solution employed. However, analysis of accurate “Rb/&Sr ratios is not trivial. Leaching with pure water is only 93 % efficient and yields elevated ratios owing to failure to inhibit surface adsorption of Sr. Leaching with a La”+-doped acid solution solves this problem; it is 99. 7 % efficient and yields accurate <b>ratios.</b> <b>Crushing</b> is the only fluid liberation method which delivers the correct 87 Rb/X 6 Sr values. In contrast, thermal decrepit&ion yields 87 Rb/ 86 Sr ratios which are quite reproducible, but exclusively incor-rect. If inert sample containers are used, falsely elevated ratios are obtained at all decrepitation temperatures due to three concurrent extraction artefacts. However, if silica glass tubes are used, reaction of Rb with the glass at temperatures above- 500 °C falsely lowers the “Rb/“Sr signatures. We, therefore, suspect al...|$|R

40|$|A novel {{method is}} developed, {{motivated}} {{by one of}} the mysteries of the Hyogoken-Nambu (Kobe) : the Nikawa landslide. To this end, prompted by the hypothesis of "sliding-surface liquefaction" advocated by Sassa [Development of a new cyclic loading ring shear apparatus to study earthquake-induced-landslides. Report for grant-in-aid for development of scientific research by the Ministry on Education, Science and Culture, Japan (project no. 03556021), 1994, p. 1 - 106; Keynote lecture: access to the dynamics of landslides during earthquakes by a new cyclic loading high-speed ring shear apparatus. In: Proceedings of the sixth international symposium on landslides, 1992. In: Landslides, vol. 3. Balkema: Rotterdam; 1995. p. 1919 - 39], a dynamic analysis of the early stages of an earth slide is presented considering two mechanically coupled sub-structures: (a) the rapidly deforming shear band {{at the base of the}} slide and (b) the accelerating sliding mass modeled as a rigid body. The proposed model for sliding is based on: (i) the concept of high pore-water pressure generation by grain crushing along the sliding surface (proposed by Sassa et al. in 1995), (ii) an experimental model developed by Hardin [Crushing of soil particles. J Geotech Eng 1985; 111 (10) : 1177 - 92] for crushing of soil particles under compression and shear, expressed with a set of developed equations governing the mechanism of breakage, and (iii) the hysteretic stress-strain Bouc-Wen-type constitutive model coupled with the Coulomb friction law. An attempt is made to adjust the model parameters to Sassa's experimental data in ring-shear tests. The method leads to a reasonable prediction of the large displacement of the Nikawa landslide. A sensitivity analysis is also carried out for the influence of key model parameters (e. g. shape, <b>crushing</b> hardness, void <b>ratio,</b> grain size distribution, effective normal stress) on the pore-pressure rise due to particle breakage.

40|$|Comminution {{test methods}} used within mineral {{processing}} have mainly {{been developed for}} selecting the most appropriate comminution technology for a given ore, designing a grinding circuit as well as sizing the equipment needed. Existing test methods usually require comparatively large sample amounts and are time-consuming to conduct. This makes comprehensive testing of ore comminution behavior – as required in the geometallurgical context – quite expensive. Currently the main interest {{in the conduct of}} comminution test lies in the determination of particle size reduction and related energy consumption by grindability test methods, which provide the necessary information about mill throughput. In this procedure mineral liberation is regarded as a fixed parameter due to missing this information in ore characterization as well as a lack of suitable comminution models. However, ignoring the connection between particle size and mineral liberation prevents the scheduling and controlling of the production process from being optimal. For these reasons new comminution tests need to be developed or alternatively the existing test methods need to be suited to geometallurgical testing where the aim is to map the variation of processing properties of an entire ore body. The objective of this research work is on the one hand to develop small-scale comminution test methods that allow linking comminution behavior and liberation characteristics to mineralogical parameters, {{and on the other hand}} establish a modeling framework including mineral liberation information. Within the first stage of the study the comminution of drill cores from Malmberget’s magnetite ore, classified by modal mineralogy and texture information, have been investigated. It was found that there is a direct correlation between the mechanical strength of the rock, as received from unconfined compressive or point load tests, and the <b>crusher</b> reduction <b>ratio</b> as a measure for crushability. However, a negative correlation was found between crushability and grindability for the same samples. The grindability showed inverse correlation with both magnetite grade and the magnetite’s mineral grain size. The preliminary conclusion is that modal mineralogy and micro-texture (grain size) can be used to quantitatively describe the ore comminution behavior although the applied fracture mechanism of the mill cannot be excluded. With crushed ore samples from Malmberget also grindability tests and mineral liberation analyses were conducted using laboratory tumbling mills of different size. Starting from the dimensions of the Bond ball mill a modified test method was developed where small size samples of approximately 220 g were pre-crushed and ground in a down-scaled one-stage grindability test. Down-scaling was done by keeping similar impact effects between the mills. Mill speed and grinding time were used for adjusting the number of fracture events in order to receive similar particle size distributions and specific grinding energy when decreasing mill size by the factor 1. 63. A detailed description of the novel geometallurgical comminution test (GCT) is given. With respect to ore crushability and autogenous and semiautogenous grinding (AG/SAG) also drop weight tests were conducted. For a more accurate and precise measurement of the energy transferred to the sample a novel instrumented drop weight was used. Initial tests with fractions of drill cores and pre-crushed ore particles showed that the simple energy calculation based on potential energy needs to be corrected. For the future work these tests will be extended to other ore types in order to investigate the effects of mineralogy and to include mineral liberation in comminution models suitable for geometallurgy.

40|$|In {{order to}} shed light on the {{mechanism}} of primary oil migration, a core from the Upper Jurassic Kimmeridge Clay Formation overlying an oil-filled reservoir in the North Sea was sampled and studied. In the study area, this is the only effective source rock and aims of the study were to detect and quantify source rock depletion approaching the reservoir and compare this, chemically, to the reservoir oil. Such depletion should be characteristic of the migration mechanism in operation. Previously published studies of this nature have been few, and often in settings where limited migration and no oil accumulation has taken place and source rock maturity was low. [...] Source rock samples from the 92 m core were crushed and analyzed for total organic carbon and kerogen carbon isotope <b>ratio.</b> <b>Crushed</b> samples were solvent extracted and, along with the reservoir oil, these extracts were separated into compound type fractions and subsequently analyzed by gas chromatography (GC) and mass spectrometry; the latter for both carbon isotope ratio and compound class breakdown. Selected rock samples were also subjected to Rock-Eval pyrolysis and visual kerogen inspection. [...] Lithologically, the section consisted of variably calcareous siltstone (9. 8 % < CaCO₃ < 51. 5 %) with total organic carbon ranging from 1. 3 to 5. 6 %, and generally lower in the bottom 30 m. Hydrocarbon content ranged from 623 to 3704 ppm (46. 6 to 159. 6 mg/g TOC) and source rock quality rated, generally, as good to very good using three classifications. [...] Source rock maturity was estimated using vitrinite reflectance, thermal alteration index, pyrolysis Tmax, odd-even predominance (OEP), methyl phenanthrene index and comparison with regional Kimmeridge Clay Formation data. A concensus of early oil window maturity resulted. Organic matter type was determined as Type II from Rock-Eval Hydrogen Index, hydrocarbon yield, and low OEP at this early maturity. Isotopically, the organic matter and oil had a marine signature. Three samples showed exceptionally abundant acyclic isoprenoids. The reservoir oil, from GC data, was typical for the North Sea and correlated well with regional data for Kimmeridge Clay bitumens at peak oil generation maturity. Isotope ratios were the only parameter which correlated well with the studied section. [...] The only depletion detected was molecular weight dependent depletion characteristic of diffusion. This was found at the second of three siltstone/sandstone contacts and composition of bitumen components expelled did not match the reservoir crude. Maximum extent of such depletion was 1. 9 m. The presence of such diffusional loss in pre-expulsion source rocks indicates that diffusion will impair subsequent source rock performance in interbedded sections. [...] Based on the maturity difference and the lack of depletion phenomena observed, it is concluded that the oil migrated from a more mature section of the same formation and that no primary migration had taken place in the section studied. The fact that expulsion had not taken place in source rocks rated as good to very good suggests that source rock classifications in general may be over optimistic and actual source rocks for some Tertiary delta provinces such as the Mississippi and Niger may be as yet undiscovered...|$|R
40|$|In 1996 the Backfill and Plug Test Project {{started at}} the Äspö Hard Rock Laboratory (Sweden) managed by SKB (the Swedish Radioactive Waste Agency). The Backfill and Plug Test Project makes up an {{important}} part of SKB's research in order to store nuclear waste in a deep geological repository in a safe manner. ENRESA (the Spanish Radioactive Waste Agency) collaborates in this project with the Swedish companies SKB and Clay Technology in characterising the hydro-mechanical behaviour of the backfill material used to backfill a gallery. The backfill, obtained by mixing 30 % of sodium bentonite MX- 80 and 70 % of crushed granite rock by weight, which maximum grain size was 20 mm, has been experimentally investigated. The experimental campaign took into account the salt water effects (up to 16 g/L) on its hydro-mechanical behaviour. Because of the bentonite content, its activity is quite large if compared with natural clayey soils. Therefore, changes in the pore fluid chemistry influence the hydro-mechanical behaviour of this mixture. Due to the current application of the mixture, as candidate for sealing galleries in a future repository for nuclear waste, interest was focused on the variation of permeability related to variation of salt concentration in pore fluid. Oedometer tests on specimens permeated with different salt water contents and water uptake tests permeated with different salt water contents were performed. Compaction tests with distilled and salt water were also performed. Osmotic suction was investigated on a different mixture of sodium bentonite and sand keeping the same weight <b>ratio.</b> <b>Crushed</b> granite was substituted by sand in order to use transistor psychrometers were used in this determination. The experimental study of the mixture included the design and calibration of a new mini-piezometer which allows performing constant and variable head tests in saturated clayey soils. Some numerical tools were also developed to analyse pulse tests performed in laboratory and in situ (tests performed in late March of 2003 in the ZEDEX gallery in the ÄHRL full-scale laboratory). Different methods (analytical, semi-analytical and numerical) were used to analyse the pulse tests performed in laboratory and in situ. Finally, the thesis focused on using a new finite element simulator, which solves thermo-hydro-mechanical-chemical (THMC) problems in a fully coupled way (Guimarães, 2002), to simulate the saturation process of a barrier for nuclear waste made up with this mixture. Interest was mainly focused on simulating the influence on the mixture hydraulic behaviour when salt concentration in pore fluid changed. A simple geochemical model, which took into account the ion exchange reaction between of Na+ and Ca 2 +, was considered. An empirical law of permeability variation with pore fluid salt concentration, obtained from the experimental information, was implemented in the finite element code. Effects of mixture molecular diffusion were also investigated, pointing out the importance of this parameter when transport of solutes in porous media is solved. Total suction was computed as the sum of matric suction and osmotic suction. Osmotic suction was calculated by obtaining salt concentrations and by using the Van't Hoff equation. In this way, osmotic suction was not assumed constant as it is usually considered in engineering practice. This thesis has contributed to the characterisation of a material, which is difficult to investigate, and it has provided with accurate information of the backfill permeability, one of the key parameters when designing a nuclear waste repository.
