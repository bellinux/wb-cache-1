The brief also compares results with an earlier study by Al Ahmed (1999). 1 INSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENTS The Syrian Arab Republic (hereafter, “Syria”) is a lower middle-income country in the Middle East {{with a population of}} 18 million people. Syria’s gross domestic product (GDP) is primarily derived from oil and agriculture, both of which are subject to considerable uncertainty due to fluctuating world oil prices on the one hand, and water shortages on the other (World Bank 2005 a). In 2003, the agricultural sector constituted 23 percent of GDP and employed about 30 percent of the country’s labor force. Agricultural products as a share of exports averaged 14 percent during 1999 – 2002 but varied considerably from one year to the next. Cotton is the principal cash crop, followed by cereals, vegetables, fruits, and tobacco (World Bank 2005 b; FAO 2005; Encyclopedia of the Nations 2005) ...|$|E

In 2001, about 85 percent of the country’s population lived in rural areas, and over 80 percent of the laborforce worked in the agricultural sector. About two-thirds of these workers were (often resource-poor) small-scale farmers. In 2001 agriculture accounted for over one-third of gross domestic product (GDP); in 2002 it accounted for 83 percent of the country’s export earnings—mainly through tobacco, at 62 percent, and tea and sugar, at 10 and 7 percent, respectively (Mataya et al. 1998; World Bank 2003; FAO 2004).

This <b>Country</b> <b>Brief</b> explores the effect of orphanhood and fostering on child vulnerability. Evidence is presented indicating that orphanhood increases child vulnerability on one main front: it makes it much more likely that a child is denied schooling.

But becoming a single or double orphan does not {{have a significant effect on}} the probability that a child is involved fulltime in economic activity. Becoming a foster child actually reduces the probability of fulltime work, but makes it more likely that a child is “inactive”, a category that includes children performing household chores. ...|$|E

30|$|As of this writing, (more {{than three}} years after the earthquake), very little of the {{reconstruction}} funds pledged {{in the immediate aftermath of}} the earthquake have materialized. Delays in disbursement have been associated with disputes over land titles, a governmental administrative structure that was weakened and decimated by the earthquake itself, and a drawn out national election process. By December 2011, according to the World Bank (<b>Country</b> <b>Brief</b> 2012), the international community had delivered over half of the pledges intended in the first 24 months (US$ 5.5 billion): but US$ 1 billion went immediately toward debt relief and only US$ 2.4 billion was spent (out of US$ 4.5 billion approved) on projects and programs; a large percentage of which returned to the country of origin of the organizations carrying out the projects. A year later, according to the New York Times (Sontag 2012) “…just a sliver of the total disbursement – $ 215 million – has been allocated to the most obvious need: safe permanent housing…While at least $ 7.5 billion in official aid and private contributions have indeed been disbursed….disbursement does not necessarily mean spent.” Significant amounts were still unallocated; “…the United States has more than $ 1 billion allocated for Haiti sitting in the treasury, and the global Red Cross movement has more than $ 500 million in its coffers”. Yet close to half a million people remained without adequate shelter, potable water, and sanitation {{three years after the}} disaster (Schuller and Morales 2013).

As of 2000, it also had the largest regional share of agricultural gross domestic product (AgGDP), at 17 percent. The agricultural sector provides the primary means of employment for Nigerians, accounting for one-third of both total GDP and labor force (FAO 2003; World Bank 2003). In the past, the Nigerian government’s strategy for stimulating agricultural production was protecting the sector with bans on agricultural imports and subsidies on inputs. Agricultural research in Nigeria is performed by, and mostly funded by, the government. Many institutional changes have occurred during t he past decade as an attempt to address the lack of funding and stability in the organization of agricultural research. We identified 81 government and higher-education agencies engaged in agricultural research in Nigeria in 2000; together they employed over 1, 352 full-time equivalent (fte) researchers and spent 3. 6 billion 1999 naira on agricultural research and development (R&D) —equivalent to $ 106 million in 1993 international prices (Table 2, 3 1). Close to two-thirds of Nigeria’s research capacity rests with the 22 government agencies, 15 of which fall under the responsibility of the Agricultural Sciences Department (ASD) within the Federal Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development (FMARD). 4 ASD is responsible for the coordination, planning, and evaluation of the activities of these 15 research institutes.

40|$|Chiggers are {{the tiny}} six-legged larval stage of mites {{in the family}} Trombiculidae. These mites, {{particularly}} the genus Leptotrombidium, act as important vectors of Orientia tsutsugamushi, the causative agent of scrub typhus disease in the Asia-Pacific region (including Thailand). Although the medical impact of these mites has been recognized in the country due to the increasing incidence of the disease in humans, knowledge of the ecology and epidemiological role of these mites is still very limited to date. A systematic review of mite-associated bacteria was conducted from 193 publications (1964 - January 2015) providing a reference database of bacteria found in mites of agricultural, veterinary and medical importance. Approximately 150 bacterial species were reported from 143 mite species with Cardinium, Wolbachia and Orientia as the dominant genera. Nationwide field sampling of small mammals from 13 locations in Thailand revealed a high diversity of chigger mites. From approximately 16, 000 mites isolated from 18 host species examined (1, 574 individual animals), 38 chigger species were found including three species new to science (i. e., Trombiculindus kosapani n. sp., Helenicula naresuani n. sp. and Walchia chavali n. sp.) and 10 new records {{for the first time}} in the <b>country.</b> <b>Brief</b> taxonomic information for the morphological identification of chiggers is provided. A combination of autofluorescent and brightfield microscopy was demonstrated to be a novel approach to study both the morphology and DNA profile of the same individual chigger. Most chigger species showed low host specificity. The diversity of chiggers on hosts was influenced by host intrinsic (i. e., host phylogeny and maturity) and extrinsic factors (i. e., habitat and geographical location). Chigger species richness and host-chigger network connectance were found to be interrelated variables explaining human scrub typhus incidence in Thailand. Chigger-associated bacteria were investigated for the first time using an Illumina MiSeq 16 S rRNA amplicon sequencing approach. DNA of O. tsutsugamushi was detected in the chigger population as expected. In addition to O. tsutsugamushi, Borrelia and Mycobacterium were identified aspotential pathogens of human and animals. Potential symbiotic bacteria of arthropods; e. g., Candidatus Cardinium, Pseudonocardia, Rickettsiella and Wolbachia were also discovered {{for the first time in}} chiggers. An important technical limitation was that chigger DNA starting quantity (individual specimens versus pooled mites) was found to have a significant impact on the apparent microbiome profile. These outcomes from the studies of chigger taxonomy and the ecology of host-chigger interactions, as well as the composition of the microbiome in chiggers, are of key importance to the chigger research field, providing essential information for disease epidemiology with vector control implications...|$|E
