40|$|This paper explores a new {{dimension}} {{of the impact of}} <b>Customs</b> <b>Unions</b> on trade liberalization, largely ignored by the literature so far. That {{new dimension}} is the importance of timing of <b>Customs</b> <b>Unions.</b> I present a dynamic model in which the effects of <b>Customs</b> <b>Unions</b> differ depending on when they are formed. <b>Customs</b> <b>Unions</b> that happen in the later stages of trade liberalization are shown to be more likely to speed up that process. The trade liberalization framework is adapted from Staigers 1995 model of Gradual Trade Liberalization. After extending the model to allow for more than two countries, I introduce the formation of <b>Customs</b> <b>Unions.</b> I then show under which conditions <b>Customs</b> <b>Unions</b> speed up and under which conditions they slow down the trade liberalization process. These show that <b>Customs</b> <b>Unions</b> are more likely to speed up trade liberalization in later rounds. Also, the Bagwell and Staiger result that high discount factors tend to make <b>Customs</b> <b>Unions</b> more beneficial to trade liberalization is confirmed. 2 1...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} changes in optimal tariffs on goods {{from the rest of}} the world due to the signing of a free trade {{agreement}} and the build up of a <b>custom</b> <b>union.</b> It shows that a trade agreement that reduces or eliminates tariffs between member countries, gives them the incentives to reduce tariffs on goods {{from the rest of the}} world regardless of the existence of a <b>custom</b> <b>union</b> in an agreement. It also shows that tariffs reduction is greater when the agreement does not contemplate a <b>custom</b> <b>union.</b> ...|$|R

5|$|The <b>Customs</b> <b>Union</b> of Belarus, Kazakhstan, and Russia (now the Eurasian <b>Customs</b> <b>Union)</b> {{came into}} {{existence}} on 1 January 2010. The Customs Union's priorities were the elimination of intra-bloc tariffs, establishing a common external tariff policy {{and the elimination of}} non-tariff barriers. It was launched as a first step towards forming a broader single market inspired by the European Union, with the objective of forming an alliance between former Soviet states. The member states planned to continue with economic integration and were set to remove all customs borders between each other after July 2011.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} ability of {{countries}} to maintain multilateral cooperation during the formation of <b>customs</b> <b>unions.</b> We assume that countries are limited to self-enforcing multilateral agreements that balance the gains from defection against the consequences of an ensuing trade war. Our analysis is conducted within a managed-trade environment, in which countries are allowed to employ "special-protection" instruments, such as safeguards, in a cooperative equilibrium, when the aggregate trade volume surpasses a critical threshold. We find that during the negotiation period, countries can sustain a relatively low level of overall protection, given the probability the <b>customs</b> <b>unions</b> will actually materialize is not too low. Nevertheless, once the <b>customs</b> <b>unions</b> are fully formed, countries need to engage in heavy utilization of "special-protection" tools so that multilateral cooperation does not break down...|$|R

It is straightforward to show that this result can be extended to other non-economic objectives as well...|$|R

With two states, the unique equilibrium structure is complete federation; with more than two states, incomplete federation can be the unique equilibrium.
