40|$|ABSTRACT: Better <b>correctors</b> {{are needed}} to repair cystic {{fibrosis}} transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) processing mutants that cause cystic fibrosis. Determining where the <b>correctors</b> bind to CFTR would aid {{in the development of}} new <b>correctors.</b> A recent study reported that the second nucleotide-binding domain (NBD 2) was involved in binding of bithiazole <b>correctors.</b> Here, we show that bithiazole <b>correctors</b> could also rescue CFTR mutants that lacked NBD 2. These results suggest that bithiazoles rescue CFTR mutants by two different mechanisms. The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator(CFTR, ABCC 7) is an ATP-binding cassette (ABC) protein that acts as a cAMP-regulated chloride channel. It is a single polypeptide with five distinct domains: two nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs), two transmembrane domains (TMDs), and a regulatory (R) domain. CFTR located on th...|$|R

40|$|For NSLSII closed orbit {{feedback}} system, {{in order}} to limit the noise caused by digital step changes of the power supplies in the feedback system, the angular kick corresponding to {{the last bit of}} the power supplies for the fast <b>correctors</b> must be smaller than 3 nrad [1]. On the other hand, to carry out closed orbit alignment or orbit correction after a long term drift, they need strong <b>correctors</b> with 0. 8 mrad kick strength. In order to avoid the requirement of <b>correctors</b> with both large strength and very small minimum step size, they consider separate sets of slow <b>correctors</b> with large strength and fast <b>correctors</b> with smaller maximum strength. In order to avoid fast and slow feedback systems working in parallel, and avoid the possible interaction between two feedback systems, they consider the possibility of using only one fast feedback system with slow <b>correctors</b> periodically removing the DC components of the fast <b>correctors</b> so that the DC components in fast feedback system do not accumulate to reach saturation even after a large long term drift of the closed orbit motion. They report on simulation of the performance of such a combined system for NSLSII in this paper...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe ESRF {{storage ring}} {{is going to}} be {{upgraded}} into an Extremely Bright Source(EBS). The orbit correction system of the EBS ring will require 320 BPMs and 288 <b>correctors</b> instead of 224 BPMs and 96 <b>correctors</b> for the present ring. On the new ring, we are planning to reuse 192 Libera Brilliance electronics and 96 fast <b>correctors</b> power supplies and the 8 FPGA controllers of the present system and to add 128 new BPMs electronics and 196 new <b>correctors</b> power supplies. These new BPM electronics and power supplies will not have the fast 10 KHz data broadcast capability of the components of the present system. So we plan to implement an hybrid slow/ fast correction scheme on the SR of the EBS in order to reuse the present fast orbit correction system on a reduced set of the BPMs and <b>correctors</b> and combine this fast orbit correction with an orbit correction performed at a slower rate using the full set of BPMs and <b>correctors.</b> We have made simulations to predict the efficiency of this scheme for the EBS and tested on the present ring a similar orbit correction scheme using only 160 BPMs and 64 <b>correctors</b> for the fast corrections. We present the results of our simulations and experiments...|$|R
40|$|We prove, {{under some}} assumptions, the {{existence}} of <b>correctors</b> for the stochastic homoge-nization of of " viscous " possibly degenerate Hamilton-Jacobi equations in stationary ergodic media. The general claim is that, assuming knowledge of homogenization in probability, <b>correctors</b> exist for all extreme points of the convex hull of the sublevel sets of the effective Hamiltonian. Even when homogenization is not a priori known, the arguments imply existence of <b>correctors</b> and, hence, homogenization in some new settings. These include positively homogeneous Hamiltonians and, hence, geometric-type equations including motion by mean curvature, in radially symmetric environments and for all directions. <b>Correctors</b> also exist and, hence, homogenization holds for many directions for non convex Hamiltoni-ans and general stationary ergodic media...|$|R
5|$|However, {{the sort}} of {{authority}} accorded by this position is widely discussed. The problem arise from the word MTQNNʿ; its exact meaning is debated. The word is translated to Latin as <b>corrector</b> but restitutor is another possible translation; the latter title was an honorary one meant to praise the bearer for driving enemies out of Roman territories. However, the inscription of Vaballathus is clearer as the word PNRTTʿ is not a Palmyrene word but a direct Palmyrene translation of the Greek term Epanorthotes which is usually an equivalent to <b>corrector.</b>|$|E
