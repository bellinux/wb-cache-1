5|$|Sandgrouse {{have little}} {{interaction}} with people, primarily because most species live in arid unpopulated areas and at low densities. They are not generally sought after as game birds {{as they are}} not especially palatable, although they have on occasion been taken in great numbers at water holes. An attempt to introduce them into Nevada failed {{but they have been}} introduced to Hawaii. No species is considered to be threatened although there have been some localised range contractions, particularly in Europe. A subspecies of the <b>chestnut-bellied</b> <b>sandgrouse,</b> P. e. floweri, was last seen in the Nile Valley of Egypt in 1979. It is thought to be extinct, but the reasons for this are unknown.|$|E
50|$|Previously the crowned sandgroupse was {{included}} in genus Eremialector and recent studies {{suggest that it is}} part of a clade that also includes the yellow-throated sandgrouse P. gutturalis and the Madagascan sandgrouse P. personatus; and these may form a group along with the two Syrrhaptes species, black-bellied sandgrouse P. orientalis, Namaqua sandgrouse P. namaqua and <b>chestnut-bellied</b> <b>sandgrouse</b> P. exustus, and possibly including also P. alchata and P. burchelli; further study is required.|$|E
50|$|The <b>chestnut-bellied</b> <b>sandgrouse</b> (Pterocles exustus) is {{a species}} of sandgrouse. They are found in sparse, bushy, arid land which is common in central and {{northern}} Africa, and southern Asia. Though they live in hot, arid climates, they are highly reliant on water. They {{have been known to}} travel up to 50 mi in one day in search of water. All species of sandgrouse that have been studied in habitat have proved to be entirely vegetarian throughout their lives, specialising in leguminous weed seeds and seldom eating grass seeds.|$|E
50|$|Birds: About 1,600 bar-headed geese (Anser indicus) {{have been}} {{recorded}} from this site. According to Wetlands International (2002), 1% threshold of this species is 560; accordingly about 3% {{of the population is}} found at this IBA site. This site could also attract more than 20,000 birds, if fishing and other disturbances are curtailed during winter when most of the migrants are found in India. Beyond the cultivated areas, these waterbodies are surrounded by barren, rocky terrain. Consequently, dryland birds are also seen, such as the Indian courser Cursorius coromandelicus, <b>chestnut-bellied</b> <b>sandgrouse</b> (Pterocles exustus), yellow-wattled lapwing (Vanellus malabaricus) and Indian robin (Saxicoloides fulicata). The site falls in Biome-12, i.e. Indo-Gangetic plains, but species of Biome-11 are also sighted.|$|E
