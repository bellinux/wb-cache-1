In this review, six adipokines, and their actions in the obese and non-obese conditions will be discussed.

40|$|Obesity is well {{recognized}} as a major public health <b>concern.</b> <b>Obesity</b> rates have been rising {{over the past several}} decades in the United States, with approximately one third of youth and two thirds of adults deemed overweight or obese (Ogden et al., 2006).

Although many causes and correlates of obesity have been identified, prevention of obesity or reversal of the rising trend remains a complex and multifaceted challenge. One level of influ-ence, the family unit, has been shown to have an important effect on childhood obesity (Birch & Davison, 2001; Seo & Sa, 2009).

40|$|Obesity is {{a chronic}} disease which results from genetic factors {{as well as}} {{environmental}} influences. Because of an imbalance in energy intake and expenditure it comes to an excessive accumulation of adipose tissue. The prevalence of obesity has increased over the last decades around the world. This {{is due to the}} spread of the western lifestyle which is affected by a lack of physical labour and the constant access to energy-dense food. By using bibliometric methods the current study aims to present a broad overview of the worldwide scientific research activity <b>concerning</b> <b>obesity</b> over the period of 1900 – 2009. Therefore the data bases of ISI Web of Science were used. The extracted bibliographic information and the data of citations of 94987 articles dealing with obesity were building the basis for the current analysis. Concerning different points of view a qualitative and quantitative analysis of the data has been done: The chronological sequence of scientific productivity <b>concerning</b> <b>obesity</b> has been regarded. Analysis in terms of the scientific output of the countries have been done. The articles were determined by publication language. Via cooperation analysis the scientific collaboration has been examined on the level of countries and institutions. The journals have been explored concerning their thematic focussing, their publication numbers and received citations. Furthermore the authors have been analyzed by their scientific productivity and the quantity of citations they received as well as the height of their h-index. The research collaboration of authors has been measured through co-authorship. The publication numbers relative to obesity show an undamped exponential growth. This indicates a high extent of research work which could even rise in the future. In the international comparison of the countries the USA shows the highest number of publications and received citations. They also feature the highest h-index of all countries and the greatest number of scientific institutions. This advises that the USA is in terms of both quantity and quality at the forefront of research <b>concerning</b> <b>obesity.</b> Many European countries such as the UK, Italy, Germany, France, Spain and Sweden as well as Canada and Japan also show high publication and citation numbers. These results are in accordance with other studies about the scientific impact of nations. Regarding the analysis of international collaboration one can see a worldwide network with the USA in its centre. Especially the collaboration between the two couples of USA-Canada and USA-UK shows a high number of common scientific publications. It is remarkable that countries who often collaborate with each other in scientific research in many cases lie in the same geographical area. Often they have close political and cultural relations or speak the same language. The number of publications with authors from different countries has sharply increased over the last decades which mirrors the increasing impact of internationalization in science. The analysis of the journals shows that the scientific magazines with the largest number of publications about obesity like the “International Journal of Obesity” thematically specialize on endocrinology and metabolism. The journals with the highest amount of citations like the prestigious scientific magazine “Nature” have an interdisciplinary character. In terms of productivity the US scientists play a dominant role following by researchers from Sweden, Denmark and Canada. The results of this analysis are relative to the limits of the used bibliometric methods which describe the complex processes of scientific productivity in a simplified way. In conclusion {{it can be said that}} the current analysis presents a capacious overall picture of scientific research about obesity. Furthermore the results could show general tendencies of modern science...|$|R

40|$|The {{risk for}} obesity is {{especially}} prevalent among African American adults in Central Virginia, who {{have one of}} the highest rates of obesity in the nation. Efforts to address obesity in African American adults through diet, weight reduction, and increased physical activity in settings such as schools, worksites, healthcare organizations, churches, and communities, are among the initiatives of Healthy People 2020. The objective of this project, conducted with 91 African American adults (33 females and 58 males) in central Virginia, was to complete a community needs assessment that related to obesity among members of an African American church. The needs assessment was an 8 -question voluntary quantitative survey that collected data on 4 independent variables (age, income, access to fruits and vegetables, and visiting a doctor in the past year for health concerns) and 2 dependent variables (<b>concern</b> about <b>obesity</b> and willingness to attend health education classes at local church). The Health Belief Model and the Health Promotion Model were both utilized in this project. The Spearman 2 ̆ 7 s rho and Chi-square statistics were used to analyze the data. Age was significantly associated with concern about obesity: As age increased, <b>concern</b> about <b>obesity</b> decreased. Income was significantly associated with willingness to attend health education classes at the local church: As income level increased, willingness to attend health education classes increased.

The disability laws in the United Kingdom require employers and employees not to discriminate or harass their colleagues, yet the model of discrimination seen in the United Kingdom emerges from a historical basis where sex and race were accommodated by the Sex Discrimination Act (1975) and the Race Relations Act (1976) respectively, and laws prohibiting disability were introduced later by the Disability Discrimination Act (1995). These laws in conjunction required UK citizens in the workplace and beyond not to subject their fellow citizens, potential workmates and current employees to less favourable treatment and to provide reasonable adjustments in the workplace where discrimination was a possible outcome of behaviours or policy arrangements...|$|R

As with any phenotype, obesity is at base {{an outcome of}} gene-environment interactions. However, different disciplines working in obesity research have identified different facets {{of the problem and}} developed different models of population obesity. These include those of thrifty genotypes, obesogenic behavior, obesogenic environments, nutrition transition, obesogenic culture, and biocultural interactions of genetics, environment, behavior, and culture. Although there is an overlap between various of these models, there remains a lack of consensus <b>concerning</b> <b>obesity</b> causation at the population level.

40|$|Abstract Hummingbirds {{and other}} nectar-feeding, migratory birds possess unusual {{adaptive}} traits that offer important lessons <b>concerning</b> <b>obesity,</b> diabetes and the metabolic syndrome. Hummingbirds consume a high sugar diet and have fasting glucose levels {{that would be}} severely hyperglycemic in humans, yet these nectar-fed birds recover most glucose that is filtered into the urine. Hummingbirds accumulate over 40 % body fat shortly before migrations {{in the spring and}} autumn. Despite hyperglycemia and seasonally elevated body fat, the birds are not known to become diabetic in the sense of developing polyuria (glucosuria), polydipsia and polyphagia. The tiny (3 – 4 g) Ruby-throated hummingbird has among the highest mass-specific metabolic rates known, and loses most of its stored fat in 20 h by flying up to 600 miles across the Gulf of Mexico. During the breeding season, it becomes lean and maintains an extremely accurate energy balance. In addition, hummingbirds can quickly enter torpor and reduce resting metabolic rates by 10 -fold. Thus, hummingbirds are wonderful examples of the adaptive nature of fat tissue, and may offer lessons concerning prevention of metabolic syndrome in humans. </p...|$|R
