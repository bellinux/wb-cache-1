500|$|Williams {{said the}} album was never {{finished}} {{and because of the}} demand for the record, the distributors insisted the album be completed, otherwise they would cancel the album's orders. This resulted in Dr. Dre mixing the album and inserting the skits within 48 hours, which enabled the album to be released. Rolling Stone writer Jonathan Gold described how Dr. Dre produced a beat from scratch to complete instrumental: [...] "Dre may find something he likes from an old drum break, loop it and gradually replace each part with a better tom-tom sound, a kick-drum sound he adores, until the beat bears the same relationship to the original that the Incredible Hulk does to Bill Bixby". Gold also described how the track progressed with other musicians adding to the song, stating [...] "A bass player wanders in, unpacks his instrument and pops a funky two-note bass line over the beat, then leaves to watch CNN, though his two notes keep looping into infinity. A smiling guy in a striped jersey plays a nasty one-fingered melody on an old Minimoog synthesizer that's been obsolete since 1982, and Dre scratches in a sort of surfadelic munching noise, and then from his well-stocked Akai MPC60 samples comes a shriek, a spare piano chord, an ejaculation from the first Beastie's record -- [...] "Let me <b>clear</b> <b>my</b> throat"—and the many-layered groove is happening, bumping, breathing, almost loud enough to see." ...|$|E
500|$|The BBC used viral {{promotion}} on the EastEnders homepage {{to further}} develop {{the character of}} Danielle. A new section named Danielle's Diary was launched, encompassing events in the show from 6 October 2008 onwards, written in diary style from Danielle's point of view. Insight was given into the character's thoughts and feelings on the events surrounding her each week, beginning with the introduction: [...] "Bit new to all this. Need some way to <b>clear</b> <b>my</b> head though. Can't really talk to Stace. Or Callum. Or anyone. Maybe if I write it all down, my head won't explode... Anyway, welcome to my life in Walford." [...] In this manner, viewers were {{able to keep up}} with the character during her temporary absence from the show in February 2009, when she returned home to Telford following her abortion: [...] "Back in Dawley. Feels strange to be away from Stacey... away from R away from Ronnie. Been sleeping a lot – so tired. When I was younger I never dreamt that I’d go through all of this. Stace keeps ringing, but I can’t speak to anyone. I can’t even listen to my voicemail", and were privy to Danielle's internal worries about her relationship with Ronnie: [...] "It's like I scare R. It was as though she scared herself, as she actually admitted that she cared. For about ten seconds I felt close to her again. Like watching the sun appear from behind a cloud... feeling the warmth across your skin again. But, then it disappears as another cloud sweeps over it." [...] The final entry, dated minutes before Danielle's on-screen death, reads: [...] "All I ever wanted was for mum to look at me with love in her eyes. To call me her baby. To tell me she loved me. I have to leave now. I have to go back to Telford. Goodbye Walford." [...] After the character had been killed off, the diary format gave way to a wall of memorial messages, supposedly penned by other EastEnders characters, including Abi Branning (Lorna Fitzgerald), Lucy Beale (Melissa Suffield), Callum and Stacey.|$|E

2500|$|The {{battle was}} won, but {{close to the}} scene his {{injuries}} overcame him; he made his will and ordered his friends to cut off his head after death in order that his enemies might not mutilate his body; he begged his attendants to attest {{that he had not}} turned tail on the enemy. They assured him, and wished him to be quiet because hostile soldiers were closing in, but he insisted, [...] "My wounds are <b>clear,</b> <b>my</b> wounds are clear". Upon his death, a kinsman ordered the decapitation and then wrapped the head in cloth; an attempt was made to conceal his trunk under a tree, but it was discovered by a hunter and brought to the town of Kilmallock. For weeks, the trunk was nailed to the gallows, until it was shattered by musket fire and collapsed.|$|E
2500|$|As time passed, {{more and}} more of a hip-hop {{influence}} crept into go-go. Early MCs like D.C. Scorpio gave way to DJ Kool, whose 1996 indie release, [...] "Let Me <b>Clear</b> <b>My</b> Throat"—based on a sample from DJ Mark the 45 King’s “The 900 Number”—was picked up by American Recordings and in 1997 became go-go's last certifiable hit single (#4 on Billboard's Rap singles chart, #21 on the R/Hip-Hop singles chart, and #30 on the Hot 100). As the hip-hop content in go-go increased, the complexity of the musical arrangements decreased. Where bands once featured horn sections and multiple guitarists in addition to a phalanx of percussionists, many current go-go bands have stripped down to just keyboards and percussion. [...] Another trend is to have a dedicated percussionist with plastic [...] "wood blocks" [...] performing much {{of what used to be}} handled by the Junior Congas.|$|E
2500|$|The ADE 651 {{consists}} of a swivelling antenna mounted via a hinge to a plastic handgrip. It requires no battery or other power source; its manufacturer claimed that it is powered solely by the user's static electricity. To use the device, the operator must walk {{for a few moments}} to [...] "charge" [...] it before holding it at right angles to the body. After a substance-specific [...] "programmed substance detection card" [...] is inserted, the device is supposed to swivel in the user's hand to point its antenna {{in the direction of the}} target substance. The cards are claimed to be designed to [...] "tune into" [...] the [...] "frequency" [...] of a particular explosive or other substance named on the card. According to Husam Muhammad, an Iraqi police officer and user of the ADE 651, using the device properly is more of an art than a science: [...] "If we are tense, the device doesn't work correctly. I start slow, and relax my body, and I try to <b>clear</b> <b>my</b> mind." [...] The cards were supposedly [...] "programmed" [...] or [...] "activated" [...] by being placed in a jar for a week along with a sample of the target substance to absorb the substance's [...] "vapours". Initially, McCormick reportedly used his own blood to [...] "program" [...] the cards for detecting human tissue, but eventually gave up even the pretense of [...] "programming" [...] them when demand for the devices was at its peak.|$|E
