She saw them both looking back at her. [...] "Stop, stop, Mr. Thorpe," [...] she impatiently cried; [...] "it is Miss Tilney; it is indeed. How {{could you tell me}} they were gone? Stop, stop, I will get out this moment and go to them." [...] But to what purpose did she speak? Thorpe only lashed his horse into a brisker trot; the Tilneys, who had soon ceased to look after her, were in a moment out of sight round the corner of Laura Place, and in another moment she was herself whisked into the marketplace.

[...] But Mr. Thorpe only laughed, smacked his whip, encouraged his horse, made odd noises, and drove on; and Catherine, angry and vexed as she was, having no power of getting away, was obliged to give up the point and submit. Her reproaches, however, were not spared. [...] "How could you deceive me so, Mr. Thorpe? How <b>could</b> <b>you</b> <b>say</b> that you saw them driving up the Lansdown Road? I would not have had it happen so for the world. They must think it so strange, so rude of me! To go by them, too, without saying a word! You do not know how vexed I am; I shall have no pleasure at Clifton, nor in anything else. I had rather, ten thousand times rather, get out now, and walk back to them. How <b>could</b> <b>you</b> <b>say</b> you saw them driving out in a phaeton?" [...] Thorpe defended himself very stoutly, declared he had never seen two men so much alike in his life, and would hardly give up the point of its having been Tilney himself.|$|E
