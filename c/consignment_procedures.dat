40|$|The {{increasing}} {{awareness of}} environment protection {{had made the}} European Union request the enterprises, through legislation (such as WEEE, RoHS and EuP), to take the responsibility to minimize the environmental impact. Directive of WEEE stresses that producers {{are responsible for the}} collection and recycling of all electrical and electronic waste. This paper focuses on how manufacturers can meet WEEE through reducing, re-generating, and recycling the waste materials, what benefits can be gained during the process of RFID monitoring, and what regulations are required for the suppliers and recycling merchants on the environmental protection issues in performing and achieving the Green Management Policy or System. This study examines the current recycling methods, the merchants ’ recycling operation procedures as well as the functions of RFID applied into the operation procedures. The efficiency of recycles tracing and monitoring further be discussed based on supply chain forward/reverse checking theory. We used Unified Modeling Language (UML) diagram to explain how to simplify production procedures, <b>consignment</b> <b>procedures,</b> stocking procedures, and recycling procedures. We concluded three major findings: (1) The RFID technique could provide one of the best choices for the recycling procedure. (2) Manufacturers, government, and recycling merchants are all benefited from the lead-in of RFID technique into the operation procedures. (3) The establishment of WEEE monitoring procedures helps the enterprises to reappraise and reinforce their management skills that in return strengthen their competence...|$|E

30|$|Many {{studies have}} {{explored}} the CA {{and its impact}} on the logistics industry. For example, Heaver (1992) examined the efficiency and effectiveness of the CA in several countries, the manner by which the CA could implement “seamless” international logistics, and the extent to which efficiency affects the competitiveness of countries and consequently attract international logistics businesses. Numerous studies have focused on methods for improving the effectiveness and efficiency of the CA. Geourjon and Laporte (2005) investigated the revenue performance of the CA and concluded that the use of a sophisticated risk management method can facilitate trade and enhance performance. Cantens et al. (2010) adopted performance measures to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of the CA. Duval et al. (2006) reviewed the express <b>consignment</b> clearance <b>procedures</b> in Asia from an operational perspective and compared their differences in detailed operation procedures. Puengpradit (2010) examined the operations in Thailand and identified discrepancies between policy and implementation, particularly in risk management, customs procedures, and information technology; this study also recommended methods for maintaining the balance between trade facilitation and regulatory control.|$|R
