40|$|Free and Easy Wanderer Plus (FEWP) is a polyherbal {{preparation}} which therapeutic {{benefits have}} been extensively evaluated {{in patients with}} various depressive disorders. The purpose of this meta-analysis {{was to assess the}} overall effectiveness and safety of FEWP. Following systematic review, a total of 14 high-quality randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were identified and included in the meta-analysis. Statistically greater treatment effects were found in FEWP monotherapy compared to placebo and in FEWP combined with conventional anti-depressants (<b>CADs)</b> compared to <b>CADs</b> alone. Patients taking FEWP alone and combined with <b>CADs</b> experienced fewer adverse events of dizziness, headache, dry mouth, nausea, and constipation compared to <b>CADs</b> alone. These data suggest that FEWP may be an effective herbal agent in treating depressive symptoms. The addition of FEWP also enhances antidepressant effects of <b>CADs.</b> FEWP may have a higher safety profile compared to <b>CADs.</b> © 2011. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|AbstractAn {{increasing}} body {{of evidence}} appears to implicate the lipid bilayer of multidrug resistant (MDR) cells with P-glycoprotein activity. Several cationic amphiphilic drugs (<b>CADs)</b> have been extensively described as modulators of MDR. These same agents are also known to (1) inhibit lysosomal acid sphingomyelinase (ASmase), a phospholipid degrading enzyme, and/or (2) induce phospholipidosis in animal tissues or cultured cell lines. In this report, we randomly selected 17 <b>CADs</b> and evaluated their potency in modulating MDR in the murine MDR P 388 /ADR leukemia cell line. We compared these results with their ability to inhibit ASmase and observed a significant dose-dependent linear relationship (95 % central confidence interval), between ASmase inhibition and MDR reversal. This approach permitted us to identify three new modestly potent chemosensitizers: trimipramine, desipramine, and mianserine. Modulation of MDR was not cell line specific, since <b>CADs</b> at 10 μM increased doxorubicin (DOX) and vinblastine (VBL) (but not methotrexate, MTX) cytotoxicity in both P 388 /ADR and the human MDR cell lines MES-SA/Dx 5 and K 562 /R 7, {{but not in the}} parental drug-sensitive cells. Although all chemosensitizing <b>CADs</b> at 10 μM significantly increased Rhodamine- 123 (Rho- 123) accumulation in the human leukemia MDR cell line K 562 /R 7 and most presented significant displacement of the photoaffinity labelling probe iodoarylazidoprazosin, no correlation between these observations and the ability of <b>CADs</b> to sensitize MDR cells to DOX and VBL was found. In conclusion, our study strongly suggests that the chemosensitizing potency of agents such as <b>CADs</b> may be due to a dual mechanism of action: direct antagonism of P-gp activity and indirect modulation of P-gp activity through the disruption of cellular lipid metabolism...|$|R

25|$|<b>CAD</b> {{is used in}} {{screening}} mammography (X-ray {{examination of}} the female breast). Screening mammography {{is used for the}} early detection of breast cancer. <b>CAD</b> systems are often utilized to help classify a tumor as malignant or benign. <b>CAD</b> is especially established in US and the Netherlands and is used in addition to human evaluation, usually by a radiologist. The first <b>CAD</b> system for mammography was developed in a research project at the University of Chicago. Today it is commercially offered by iCAD and Hologic. There are currently some non-commercial projects being developed, such as Ashita Project, a gradient-based screening software by Alan Hshieh, as well. However, while achieving high sensitivities, <b>CAD</b> systems tend to have very low specificity and the benefits of using <b>CAD</b> remain uncertain. Some studies suggest a positive impact on mammography screening programs, but others show no improvement. A 2008 systematic review on computer-aided detection in screening mammography concluded that <b>CAD</b> does not {{have a significant effect on}} cancer detection rate, but does undesirably increase recall rate (i.e. the rate of false positives). However, it noted considerable heterogeneity in the impact on recall rate across studies.|$|E

40|$|Several cell types develop {{extensive}} {{plasma membrane}} invaginations {{to serve a}} specific physiological function. For example, the megakaryocyte demarcation membrane system (DMS) provides a membrane reserve for platelet production and muscle transverse (T) tubules facilitate excitation:contraction coupling. Using impermeant fluorescent indicators, capacitance measurements and electron microscopy, we show that multiple cationic amphiphilic drugs (<b>CADs)</b> cause complete separation of the DMS from the surface membrane in rat megakaryocytes. This includes the calmodulin inhibitor W- 7, the phospholipase-C inhibitor U 73122, and anti-psychotic phenothiazines. <b>CADs</b> also caused loss of T tubules in rat cardiac ventricular myocytes and the open canalicular system of human platelets. Anionic amphiphiles, U 73343 (a less electrophilic U 73122 analogue) {{and a range of}} kinase inhibitors were without effect on the DMS. <b>CADs</b> are known to accumulate in the inner leaflet of the cell membrane where they bind to anionic lipids, especially PI(4, 5) P 2. We therefore propose that surface detachment of membrane invaginations results from an ability of <b>CADs</b> to interfere with PI(4, 5) P 2 interactions with cytoskeletal or BAR domain proteins. This establishes a detubulating action of a large class of pharmaceutical compounds. Peer-reviewedPublisher Versio...|$|R
