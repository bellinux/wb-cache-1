50|$|A PTO {{or power}} {{take-off}} unit {{has the same}} driven components as a petrol or diesel driven unit except that the unit takes mechanical power from the vehicles engine via a specially fitted power take off unit which is usually fitted to the vehicle transmission. The power is usually transmitted via a drive shaft or hydraulic pump and motor. Heating the solution is either by a vehicle exhaust heat exchanger, <b>coolant</b> <b>heater</b> or LPG fired heater. The advantage is quieter running and lighter weight in addition to not having to maintain a second engine. The disadvantages are putting extra running hours on the vehicle engine and transmission. The PTO system is also usually vehicle specific so transferring the truckmount to another make or model of vehicle will require a new PTO system to be fitted.|$|E

50|$|There are {{a variety}} of reasons that bus drivers idle their engines. The {{majority}} of engine idling occurs in the morning, when drivers are warming up the engines and the passenger compartments. Part of the problem with excessive idling, other than the immense amount of fuel it uses, is driver mentality coming from lack of knowledge about the fuel consumption of an idling engine. Typically, a bus driver will turn on the bus when they wake up, then proceed {{to get ready for the}} day, creating a period of excessive idling of up to half an hour. The objective of fuel-operated heaters is to eliminate this specific need for idling, which in turn reduces fuel consumption and costs. This technology works by using the coolant system to warm the engine, and the “thermal energy gained is then distributed through the vehicle's own heat exchanger as forced hot air. This process heats the interior of the vehicle via existing air vents. The engine is also warmed up with the residual heat in the cooling water”. In general, <b>coolant</b> <b>heaters</b> burns eight times less fuel that an idling engine would, simultaneously emitting 1/20th of the emissions and directing heat significantly faster to the passenger compartment. <b>Coolant</b> <b>heaters</b> are also much more efficient than an engine. For example, according to the manufacturer, the Webasto TSL-17 is upwards of 82% efficient, whereas a diesel engine has no more than half that efficiency.|$|R

The effect of operating conditions and oil temperature control system design on the thermal state and the cold start characteristics of the diesel engine was determined experimentally (in “climate” chamber). It is proved, that the application of this system and <b>coolant</b> <b>heater</b> with the recommended design parameters and operating modes, ensures the diesel compliance with the requirements of normative and technical documentation, and allows increasing oil temperature in the main oil line (without coolant heating) by - 10 [...] . 23 °C, in the crankcase – by 5 [...] . 10 °C, the average temperature of the diesel engine – by 7 [...] . 8 °C, before the start, providing a guaranteed engine start at ambient temperatures of - 25 °C within 5 [...] . 8. 5 minutes, at - 50 °C – within 21 [...] . 28 min.

The system allows for a user to input the desired conditions regarding the surrounding atmosphere`s temperature requirements. This paper incorporates design and development of monitoring the temperature and controlling it. The objective of the project is to develop a system, which demonstrates intelligent monitoring and controlling system This system uses ZigBee technology for communication. A temperature effect on devices and heavy machines is a major concern for many in the industrial and domestic applications. In such applications monitoring temperature and controlling it through some external solutions like <b>coolants</b> and <b>heaters</b> is done. In order to overcome these problems many industries and domestic users have been implementing many solutions. The project consists of two modules. One is the parameter monitoring and the other one is the parameter controlling. Monitoring and controlling physical parameters like temperature is of outmost importance. A temperature sensor LM 35 will be used for the purpose of measuring temperature. By our project we are demonstrating a cost effective, user friendly system.

40|$|One-quarter of the {{worldwide}} greenhouse gas emissions is emitted by fossil fuel based power plants. In order to limit future climate changes caused by these emissions, several types of CO 2 -capturing power plants are currently being developed. An integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC) {{is one of the}} most promising alternatives. It is the mission of a European collaboration project called DECARBit to enable the commercial use of this type of power plant. One of themain process units of an IGCC is the air separation unit (ASU). It provides both oxygen and nitrogen to the gasifier, and nitrogen to the gas turbine. The main objective of this thesis is to improve the Second law efficiency of a cryogenic ASU, with a focus on the use of novel distillation concepts. Improving the Second law efficiency of a process is equivalent to improving its exergy efficiency. In this thesis, the exergy efficiency is defined as the desired change in exergy contents of the ASU products divided by the net amount of added work. Using exergy analysis, it is shown that the exergy efficiency of a state-of-the-art two-column ASU with a pumped liquid cycle is approximately 35 %. Most of the exergy destruction is located in the compressor after-coolers, the distillation section, and the main heat exchanger. The irreversibilities in the compressor after-coolers are caused by the use of cooling water. They can almost completely be eliminated by transferring the heat of compression to the ASU products instead of to the cooling water. The achieved reduction in exergy destruction corresponds to almost 1 % of the net electric efficiency of the IGCC and it increases the exergy efficiency of the ASU to approximately 70 %. Two alternatives are presented that can improve the distillation section efficiency. The first one is the addition of a third distillation column; it can reduce the exergy destruction in the distillation section by approximately 30 %. The second option is to improve the heat integration of the two distillation columns, by using heat-integrated distillation stages (HI stages). These HI stages are the basis of a relatively novel distillation column configuration called a heat-integrated distillation column (HIDiC). In an ASU, the use of HI stages enables a lower operating pressure in the high-pressure column, which reduces the required work input to ASU. Depending on the amount of heat-transfer capacity per HI stage, the exergy destruction in the distillation section can be reduced by 20 to 30 % due to the use of HI stages. HI stages and HIDiCs are not yet in industrial use. So far, only two complete HIDiCs have been built, both using concentrically-integrated columns equipped with structured packing. They have proven the feasibility of the HIDiC concept, but detailed knowledge on the performance of the columns is still very scarce. As a result, simulations of packed concentric HIDiCs still involve several uncertainties. They are related to the achievable overall heat-transfer coefficient, to the performance of a ring-shaped distillation column, and to the effects that a radial heat flux has on the column performance. In order to obtain more insight into these phenomena, two research directions have been pursued: a theoretical one and an experimental one. The theoretical work concerns the further development of a model for the simultaneous transfer of mass and thermal energy, based on the theory of irreversible thermodynamics. The model describes the vapour–liquid interface region of a mixture as a series of connected control volumes that together represent a vapour film, the interface, and a liquid film. This interface region is located in between the bulk vapour and bulk liquid phases; the conditions at its boundaries are equal to the adjacent bulk phase conditions. A routine has been developed that calculates the thermal and molar fluxes through the interface region, based on input values for the boundary conditions, or driving forces. The film thicknesses ratio is found by requiring consistency between the entropy productions calculated using the entropy balance and using the product-sum of conjugate fluxes and driving forces. By applying this model to a nitrogen–oxygen mixture, it has been shown that the direct coupling between heat and diffusion fluxes has a considerable influence on the calculated values of the fluxes. The measurable heat flux is most sensitive to the coupling effect, which makes a correct description of the effect especially important when simulating a HIDiC. Another important model parameter is the number of control volumes that is used to represent the films. The effect of the interface resistances on the calculation results was relatively small. The experimental work concerns the development of a new experimental HIDiC. The designed set-up consists of a cylindrical inner column with a diameter of 14 cm that is surrounded by a ring-shaped outer column with a diameter of 22 cm. A difference in operating pressures causes thermal energy to be transferred from the high-pressure inner column to the low-pressure outer column. Both columns will be equipped with 1. 6 m of structured packing and will operate at total reflux conditions. The set-up is designed to operate at cryogenic temperatures, elevated pressures, and high oxygen concentrations. At the top of the set-up, two copper-brazed plate heat exchangers will be used as condensers, using evaporating nitrogen as <b>coolant.</b> Electrical <b>heaters</b> with a maximum duty of 25 kW will be used as reboilers. Radial and angular temperature and composition gradients inside the columns will be measured directly at several height levels, in both the vapour and liquid phases. These measurements can also be used to determine the separation efficiency of the columns. The total amount of thermal energy transfer will be obtained based on two independent measurements of the condenser and reboiler duties of both columns. The set-up can also be used to assess the coupling between thermal and molar fluxes. PhD i kjemiPhD in Chemistr...|$|R
