40|$|Fragment of woven wool fabric {{which has}} been tied into a large <b>knot</b> at one <b>corner.</b> (<b>knotted</b> end.) At least seven brown weft bands are just barely visible across the fabric. They vary in width from 0. 5 cm to 1. 1 cm.; Very dirty and worn. Some of the weft bands are almost {{obscured}} due to dirt and stain. There are several small interior holes and larger edge tears. Edges are frayed...|$|R
5000|$|Hand-knotting. The wire {{is wrapped}} around the <b>corner</b> post and <b>knotted</b> by hand. This {{is the most common}} method of {{attaching}} wire to a corner post. A timber hitch works well as it stays better with wire than with rope.|$|R
60|$|I {{took from}} my breast that kerchief wanting the <b>corner,</b> and <b>knotted</b> it about my throat. I {{could hear my}} heart go; and, Alan patting me on the {{shoulder}} with some of his laughable expressions, I could scarce refrain from a sharp word. But the time was not long to wait. I heard her step pass overhead, and saw her on the stair. This she descended very quietly, and greeted me with a pale face and a certain seeming of earnestness, or uneasiness, in her manner that extremely dashed me.|$|R
60|$|Lounging {{near the}} doors, and in remote <b>corners,</b> were various <b>knots</b> of silly young men, {{displaying}} various varieties of puppyism and stupidity; amusing all sensible people near {{them with their}} folly and conceit; and happily thinking themselves the objects of general admiration--a wise and merciful dispensation which no good man will quarrel with.|$|R
50|$|The {{cloak and}} mantle, a cloak {{resembling}} a loose cape, were fastened either with a brooch or clasp, or as C. Cunnington describes, “the {{corner of the}} neck edge on one side was pulled through a ring sewn to the opposite <b>corner,</b> and then <b>knotted</b> to keep in position”. For the rich, the cloak was lined with fur and for all classes beneath, the cloak was hooded and made of animal hide, with the hair facing out.|$|R
40|$|Engraved t. p. Engraved plates depict obverse {{and reverse}} of Roman medals, ten to a page, with some {{positions}} left blank. Two historiated woodcut initials, two end-pieces. Despite the t. p. date of 1605 and the privilege dated 18 Dec. 1604, the dedication by Goorle's son to Henry IV, King of France, is dated 1609. Mode of access: Internet. According to dealer's description, this copy {{is from the}} Pembroke Library (Cambridge?), with its shelfmark. Binding: old calfskin. Boards gold stamped at center with arms of a duke of Savoy, perhaps Charles Emmanuel I (1562 - 1630). The arms are circled by the collar of the Order of the Annunciation. Two surrounding gilt frames of single fillets are linked at the <b>corners</b> by <b>knots,</b> a motif taken from the collar of the Order. Spine compartments gold tooled with the same knots. Page edges red...|$|R
50|$|In the UK, modern parterres {{exist at}} Trereife Park in Penzance (Cornwall), at Drumlanrig Castle in Dumfriesshire and at Bodysgallen Hall near Llandudno. Examples {{can also be}} found in the Republic of Ireland, such as at Birr Castle. One of the largest in Britain is at Cliveden in Buckinghamshire, which covers an area of 4 acres; it {{consists}} of symmetrical wedge-shaped beds filled with Nepeta ("catmint"), Santolina and Senecio, edged with box hedges. Sentinel pyramids of yew stand at the <b>corners.</b> Some early <b>knot</b> gardens have been covered over by lawn or other landscaping but the traces are visible as undulations in the present day landscape. An example of this phenomenon is the early 17th-century garden of Muchalls Castle in Scotland. At Charlecote Park in Warwickshire the original parterre from the 1700s has been recreated on the terrace overlooking the river.|$|R
2500|$|... "One evening, passing my living-room window, I heard Graham's name flung upward {{from the}} street below. I leaned out to see. A very fiery young man was making a speech from a soapbox on the <b>corner.</b> A little <b>knot</b> of men, women, and {{children}} had collected about him. He was pointing up at my window — at me. He was saying things about us. I strained to hear... 'Municipal Ownership is no solution,' he cried, 'so long as the propertied classes own the municipalities. J.G. Phelps Stokes is a rich man — a man of property; he belongs to the capitalist class. The Municipal Ownership League is a rich man's creation. W.R. Hearst belongs in the millionaire class. This is his government. He doesn't {{want to change the}} government. The Socialist Party, the workers' party, and what we want is a government of, for, and by the people who work.' 'Hear, hear!' I called down, leaning far out of the window and clapping my hands.|$|R
40|$|When {{asked to}} design {{entrance}} gates for the MACC in Hawaii, I drew on images of nets, from fishing nets used {{around the world}} to the specific background structure of ceremonial Hawaiian feather capes. As an artist, I 2 ̆ 7 m intrigued with more than the utilitarian function of nets. I 2 ̆ 7 m drawn to how nets filter light, air, visual ideas; I 2 ̆ 7 m interested in the shadows created. I have explored specific Hawaiian beliefs and cultural practices related to netting. My understanding of nets in the Hawaiian context has grown out of 2 ̆ 2 talking story 2 ̆ 2 with Hawaiian cultural specialists. I learned of meanings and associations related to suspended nets, 2 ̆ 2 nets in the sky 2 ̆ 2, of a visual connection with the Pleiades or 2 ̆ 2 Makali 2 ̆ 7 i 2 ̆ 2. The arrangement of stars in the Pleiades are like <b>knotted</b> <b>corners</b> of a netted unit. When that constellation, the Pleiades, arrives on the horizon, the rainy season begins. (Oct. -Jan.) It is believed that the 2 ̆ 2 maka 2 ̆ 2 or eyes (the openings) of the net in the sky need to be large enough to invite the rain and other 2 ̆ 2 good things 2 ̆ 2 to come through in abundance. This, the 2 ̆ 2 makahiki 2 ̆ 2 season is a time of celebration and of rest and renewal, a time of dispersing food- -a time of that which sustains. It 2 ̆ 7 s a time for appreciating the abundance of the season, a time for receiving, a time for mending, a time of mending and patching nets...|$|R
