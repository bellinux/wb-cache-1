5000|$|This method {{proved to}} be inadequate, and the <b>cam</b> <b>sprocket</b> could break loose from the {{camshaft}} and spin independently from the camshaft (or [...] "walk"). This {{would result in the}} camshaft stopping and thus not activating the valves, allowing the pistons to hit the valves, ruining the engine. The preventive measure of welding the <b>cam</b> <b>sprocket</b> to the camshaft soon {{proved to be}} a fix for engines that had not suffered such a fate yet. Another such fix is [...] "pinning" [...] the <b>cam</b> <b>sprocket,</b> or inserting a pin in the sprocket to keep it aligned on the camshaft. Ford issued a TSB (TSB 03-14-1) prescribing the application of Loctite to the <b>cam</b> <b>sprocket</b> to lengthen the life of the camshafts, but as SHO owners have experienced cam failure after the application of Loctite, most SHO enthusiasts do not recommend this fix.|$|E
5000|$|Unlike the SHO V6, the SHO V8's {{valvetrain}} was an [...] "interference" [...] design, {{one that}} is shared by many engines built today, meaning that the piston will collide with the valves if the camshaft or timing chain fails. Due to some <b>cam</b> <b>sprocket</b> failures, the engine acquired a reputation for potentially catastrophic failure.|$|E
5000|$|Soon {{after the}} {{introduction}} of the SHO V8 engine, widespread problems with the cam sprockets began to surface. Yamaha had used a relatively unusual method, called [...] "swaging", of affixing the cam sprockets to the camshafts. The cam sprockets were fastened to the hollow camshafts by forcing a metal ball which was slightly larger than the interior diameter of the camshaft {{through the center of the}} camshaft, thus expanding the metal slightly and creating a mechanical bond between the <b>cam</b> <b>sprocket</b> and the camshaft.|$|E

50|$|Also notable is {{that the}} {{original}} camshaft was retained as an intermediate shaft driving the DOHC <b>cam</b> <b>sprockets</b> via a front-mounted, single - long - timing chain, having the side-mounted distributor and nearby external oil pump/filter assembly in original locations, requiring few modifications to the mass-produced iron block.|$|R
50|$|In May 2015 it was {{reported}} that the Belgian chemical company Solvay had shown interest in reviving the concept with assistance from Matti Holtzberg. The engine is planned to weigh less than 148 lb and generate over , it is also planned to be turbocharged. Up to ten components will be replaced with polymer counterparts, these include water pump, throttle body and <b>cam</b> <b>sprockets.</b> The engine was planned to be installed in a Norma M-20 chassis and raced at Lime Rock in 2016 and a possible Le Mans entry in 2017. However this did not materialise.|$|R
50|$|VTEC {{controls}} of valve lift and valve duration are still limited to distinct low- and high-RPM profiles, but the intake camshaft is now capable of advancing between 25 and 50 degrees, depending upon engine configuration. Phasing is implemented by a computer-controlled, oil-driven adjustable <b>cam</b> <b>sprocket.</b> Both engine load and RPM affect VTEC. The intake phase varies from fully retarded at idle to somewhat advanced at full throttle and low RPM. The effect is further optimization of torque output, especially at low and midrange RPM. There {{are two types}} of i-VTEC K series engines which are explained in the next paragraph.|$|E
50|$|The 1981 XL250S was {{the last}} year to have the unique 23-inch front wheel, rear twin shock, and 6-volt {{electrical}} system. It also had upgraded rear brakes in a larger hub and a modified 5 plate clutch, and handsome twin speedo and tacho gauges in the Australian, continental variants. In 1982 the engine had the balancing <b>cam</b> <b>sprocket</b> driven rather than chain making the engine quieter and a six-speed gearbox was introduced with an automatic cam chain tensioner. From 1982 Honda reverted to the 21-inch front wheel and introduced the rear single shock suspension, known as the Pro-Link, and a 12-volt system. The 1984-1987 models were equipped with dual carburetors and the RFVC type of engine.|$|E
5000|$|In 2006, Triumph {{launched}} the [...] "Sixty-8" [...] line of Bonneville accessories, offering vintage and modern-style items including seats, seat covers, <b>cam</b> covers, <b>sprocket</b> covers, petrol tank covers, tank badges, panniers, {{and other items}} to allow Bonneville owners the opportunity to customise their bikes for considerably less cost than traditional customisations. The adoption of the EFI engine in 2008 rendered many of these accessories obsolete, since tank covers, tank badges etc. would not fit the redesigned tank.|$|R
50|$|In 2013 {{the third}} {{generation}} pedals were joined by two new variants, the duo-glide, which allowed the cam shape to be altered, and the Speed Cobra, a longboard version with a unique light <b>sprocket</b> <b>cam,</b> new fastball bearing type, and a different beater shape.|$|R
5000|$|SOHCThe EJ252 {{was only}} briefly used in North America {{alongside}} the EJ251 in the USDM Legacy Outback for the 2000 and 2001 Model Years. They are most {{commonly found in}} MY00 Legacy Outbacks manufactured {{before the end of}} 1999 while MY00 Legacy Outbacks manufactured in 2000 are rarely designated with EJ252 codes in the VIN. While Subaru has not provided a direct list of revisions between the EJ251 and less common EJ252, there is some degree of information suggesting the EJ252 was simply an alternate version of the EJ251 made to meet California Emissions Standards when the SOHC EJ engines were first introduced in North America. Power output has been reported as ISO 115 kW (156 hp) but is often speculated to share the same specs with the largely identical EJ251. [...] From unofficial analysis, the EJ251 shares the same with block, cams, heads, pistons, connecting rods with the EJ252. The only notable differences confirmed are unique intake manifold and throttle body designs to accommodate the different MAP sensor location and IACV location. Also have different <b>cam</b> and crank <b>sprocket</b> reluctor configuration.|$|R
40|$|The real {{advantage}} of PM is to cost effectively produce large volume, highly tolerance metal components & widely applied to produce mainly automotive parts such as bearings cap, <b>cams,</b> synchronisation hub, <b>sprocket</b> and toothed components. The ongoing debate has always centred on properties, such as strength, size and life of Tool. Tool material selection and material characteristics are being engineered to specific applications and requirements. Flexibility {{and knowledge of}} process variables is the key for both the end-user and the component manufacturer. We, as an industry, see challenging new horizons that only require a little inspiration, ingenuity and persistence. There is little repetitive failure during production of Compaction (Forming) press tool found in manufacturing process. Each failure causes very high Economical cost to manufacturer in terms of production loss due to down {{time as well as}} commitments to the customer. The failure analysis of this compaction press tool was found most interesting. During these work modes of failures of tool was studied to conclude and recommend the solution. Design of compaction press tool was the methodology used to analysis the problem. Reviewed the history of the compaction tool compared the capacity of the pressing various possible design conditions, results and conclusion of the study will be very useful for compaction in future planning process...|$|R
