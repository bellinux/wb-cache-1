40|$|International audienceHeterogeneous Multi-Processor System-on-Chips (HMPSoCs) {{offer an}} {{attractive}} alternative to homogeneous systems {{to achieve the}} increasing requirements of modern mediaprocessing applications. Such systems {{take advantage of the}} heterogeneity of their processing units (RISC vs. VLIW) combined with efficient memory architecture and a specific communication infrastructure. However, the complexity of such architectures requires efficient programming tools. They rely on software generation flows that have already been widely studied. Connecting several HMPSoCs to form a heterogeneous system is one solution to target the highly demanding applications belonging to the high performance-computing world. Binary code generation for such many-processor architectures faces new challenges. Indeed, binary generation requires a back-end part composed of processor-specific tools like compilers or linkers, that can no longer be configured by hand when dealing with hundreds of processors. We address in this paper the need to automate the whole configuration process of binary generation flows through the study of two important configuration aspects: the memory mapping and <b>communication</b> <b>configurations.</b> We propose a prototype including a semi-automatic configuration generation module that has been successfully applied on a particularly complex application (LQCD) ...|$|R

The cost of an allocation {{is a function of}} the execution costs and the communication costs for any pair of modules allocated to distinct processors. The module allocation problem has been well studied and is known to be NP-complete except for certain <b>communication</b> <b>configurations.</b> To solve the problem, several heuristics have been proposed. This pa per discusses an alternative approach to solving the module allocation problem by applying a stochastic optimization method called the Cross Entropy (CE) Method. The CE Method is a state-of-the-art stochastic method for solving combinatorial and multi-extremal continuous optimization problems. The CE method uses a distribution with parame ter v to generate sample allocation. The generated samples are then used to update v according to sample quality. This process is repeated until the distribution converges to a pos sibly optimal allocation. The results in this paper indicate that the CE method can successfully be applied to the mod ule allocation problem and efficiently generate high qual ity solutions. Also, the CE method allows the use of non standard objective functions that are used to find allocations that have multiple conflicting objectives...|$|R

However, complexity is still increasing as focus is moving from a single system, {{to a system of}} systems perspective. The results are increasing engineering efforts and escalating costs. For this reason, new and automated engineering methods are necessary. This paper addresses these needs with a rapid engineering methodology that covers the overall engineering process for smart grid applications—from use case design to deployment. Based on a model-driven development approach, the methodology consists of three main parts: use case modeling, code generation, and deployment. A domain-specific language is introduced supporting the use case design according to the Smart Grid Architecture Model. It is combined with the IEC 61499 distributed control model to improve the function layer design. After a completed use case design, executable code and <b>communication</b> <b>configurations</b> (e. g., IEC 61850) are generated and deployed onto compatible field devices.
