5|$|Christmas Island in the Indian Ocean has {{the largest}} and densest {{population}} of coconut crabs in the world, although it is outnumbered there by more than 50 times by the Christmas Island red crab, Gecarcoidea natalis. Other Indian Ocean populations exist on the Seychelles, including Aldabra and Cosmoledo, but the coconut crab is extinct on the central islands. Coconut crabs occur on several of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands in the Bay of Bengal. They occur {{on most of the}} islands, and the northern atolls, of the <b>Chagos</b> <b>Archipelago.</b>|$|E
5|$|A {{disturbance}} in the Indian Ocean {{intertropical convergence zone}} became evident southeast of the <b>Chagos</b> <b>Archipelago</b> on March16 after two cyclones {{moved away from the}} region. Based on analysis from MF, the system slowly organized while moving westward, its movement influenced by a subtropical ridge to the south. On March17, the JTWC also began tracking the system. Due to cool, dry air, the system initially did not intensify, although its passage over warmer sea surface temperatures on March19 allowed for strengthening. On March19, MF classified the disturbance as Tropical Storm Nadia after rainbands developed. A day later, the JTWC designated Nadia as Tropical Cyclone 23S.|$|E
5|$|Based on {{analysis}} from Météo-France (MFR), a disturbance in the Indian Ocean {{intertropical convergence zone}} became evident south of the <b>Chagos</b> <b>Archipelago</b> on February6, after Cyclone Geralda struck Madagascar and {{moved away from the}} region. The Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) assessed it as developing a day prior in the same general area. Later on February6, a circulation developed concurrently with an area of organized convection. On February8, the system intensified into Tropical Storm Hollanda as it moved southwestward, its motion influenced by a ridge to its south. A trough turned the storm to the south-southwest, and Hollanda intensified into a tropical cyclone– the equivalence of a hurricane– on February9.|$|E

60|$|I have endeavoured {{to collect}} every fact, which might either {{invalidate}} or corroborate this conclusion. Captain Moresby, whose opportunities for observation during his {{survey of the}} Maldiva and <b>Chagos</b> <b>Archipelagoes</b> have been unrivalled, informs me, that the upper part or zone of the steep-sided reefs, on {{the inner and outer}} coasts of the atolls in both groups, invariably consists of coral, and the lower parts of sand. At seven or eight fathoms depth, the bottom is formed, as could be seen through the clear water, of great living masses of coral, which at about ten fathoms generally stand some way apart from each other, with patches of white sand between them, and at a little greater depth these patches become united into a smooth steep slope, without any coral. Captain Moresby, also, informs me in support of his statement, that he found only decayed coral on the Padua Bank (northern part of the Laccadive group) which has an average depth between twenty-five and thirty-five fathoms, but that on some other banks in the same group with only ten or twelve fathoms water on them (for instance, the Tillacapeni bank), the coral was living.|$|R
5|$|The diet {{of coconut}} crabs {{consists}} primarily of fleshy fruits (particularly Ochrosia ackeringae, Arenga listeri, Pandanus elatus, P. christmatensis); nuts (Aleurites moluccanus), drupes (Cocos nucifera) and seeds (Annona reticulata); and the pith of fallen trees. However, {{as they are}} omnivores, they will consume other organic materials such as tortoise hatchlings and dead animals. They have been observed to prey upon crabs like Gecarcoidea natalis and Discoplax hirtipes, as well as scavenge on the carcasses of other coconut crabs. During a tagging experiment, one coconut crab was observed killing and eating a Polynesian Rat (Rattus exulans). In 2016, a large coconut crab was observed climbing a tree in order to disable and consume a red-footed booby on the <b>Chagos</b> <b>Archipelago.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{grey reef shark}} is {{native to}} the Indian and Pacific Oceans. In the Indian Ocean, it occurs from South Africa to India, {{including}} Madagascar and nearby islands, the Red Sea, and the Maldives. In the Pacific Ocean, it is found from southern China to northern Australia and New Zealand, including the Gulf of Thailand, the Philippines, and Indonesia. This species has also been reported from numerous Pacific islands, including American Samoa, the <b>Chagos</b> <b>Archipelago,</b> Easter Island, Christmas Island, the Cook Islands, the Marquesas Islands, the Tuamotu Archipelago, Guam, Kiribati, the Marshall Islands, Micronesia, Nauru, New Caledonia, the Marianas Islands, Palau, the Pitcairn Islands, Samoa, the Solomon Islands, Tuvalu, the Hawaiian Islands, and Vanuatu.|$|E

5000|$|BIOT is an {{archipelago}} of 55 islands. They were annexed by the UK in 1965 {{under the}} Treaty of Paris from {{a much larger}} archipelago which in 1804 consisted of 2,300 independent islands. BIOT is situated in the Indian Ocean near the Equator. It is roughly halfway between Africa and Indonesia, about [...] southwest of India. It is situated approximately 1600 km from South India and 600 km {{to the south of}} the Maldives With a coastline stretching 698 km, it is the southern extension of the Chagos-Laccadive Ridge. The <b>Chagos</b> Islands <b>archipelago</b> are northeast of Mauritius, while Agalega Islands are due north. The islands are characterised as coral atolls whose formation occurred at the summits of volcanic mountains these being submerged. The terrain is flat and low, with most areas not exceeding 2 m above sea level.|$|R
40|$|Peritidal {{platforms}} rimmed by reefs, {{and raised}} reefs rimming deep lagoons, are characteristic morphologies {{of the tropical}} carbonate factory; their geometry contrasts sharply with the seaward-sloping shelves of siliciclastic margins. The structure {{has been compared to}} a bucket-stiff reef rims holding a pile of loose sediment. Remote-sensing data from the Maldive, <b>Chagos</b> and Laccadive <b>archipelagos</b> of the Indian Ocean show that ring reefs with bucket structure are the dominant depositional pattern from patch reefs of tens of meters to archipelagos of hundreds of kilometers in diameter, that is, over more than 4 orders of magnitude in linear size. Over 2. 5 orders of magnitude, the bucket structures qualify as statistical fractals, exhibiting self-similar patterns and size distributions following power laws. However, most regional or genetic subsets of the data follow lognormal distributions and small subsets of lagoon reefs exhibit exponential distributions. Seismic data and boreholes in the Maldives indicate that the bucket has been a dominant depositional motif since the Oligocene. Ecological and hydrodynamic studies on modern reefs suggest that the bucket structure is a form of biotic self-organization: the edge position in a reef is favored over the center position because bottom shear is higher and the diffusive boundary layer between reef and water thinner. Thus, the reef edge has easier access to nutrients and is less likely to be buried by sediment. The bucket structure reflects these conditions. Karst processes have accentuated the surface relief of the buckets, particularly in the late Quaternary. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg...|$|R
5|$|The British {{garrison}} at Diego Garcia {{had not yet}} {{learned of}} the state of war between Britain and Germany, and so treated Emden to a warm reception. She remained there until 10 October, during which time her bottom was cleaned of fouling. She then resumed searching for merchant ships in the area west of Colombo. While operating there, Emden picked up Hampshires wireless signals again, and so departed for the <b>Chagos</b> <b>Archipelago</b> on 13 October. Meanwhile, the British had captured Markomannia on 12 October, depriving Emden of one of her colliers. On 15 October, Emden captured a British steamer off Minikoi and sank her the next day. Over the next five days, she captured five more vessels; one was used as a collier, three were sunk, and the fifth was sent to port with the crews of the other vessels. On 20 October, Müller {{decided it was time to}} move to a new area of operations.|$|E
5|$|The Whitetip reef shark is {{distributed}} widely {{across the entire}} Indo-Pacific region. It was once thought to have formerly existed in the Atlantic Ocean, based on fossil teeth found in North Carolina dating to the Miocene epoch. However, more recent research indicates that the teeth belonged to a mackerel shark, and that this species has never colonized the Atlantic. In the Indian Ocean, it occurs from northern KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa to the Red Sea and the Indian subcontinent, including Madagascar, Mauritius, the Comoros, the Aldabra Group, the Seychelles, Sri Lanka, and the <b>Chagos</b> <b>Archipelago.</b> In the western and central Pacific, it occurs from off southern China, Taiwan, and the Ryukyu Islands, to the Philippines, Southeast Asia, and Indonesia, to northern Australia, and is also found around numerous islands in Melanesia, Micronesia, and Polynesia, as far as Hawaii {{to the north and}} the Pitcairn Islands to the southeast. In the eastern Pacific, it occurs from Costa Rica to Panama, and off the Galápagos Islands.|$|E
5|$|The tawny {{nurse shark}} is widely {{distributed}} in the Indo-Pacific region. In the Indian Ocean, it is found from KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa northward to the Red Sea, Persian Gulf and India, including Madagascar, Mauritius, the <b>Chagos</b> <b>Archipelago,</b> the Seychelles, and the Maldives. In the western Pacific, it occurs from southern Japan and the coast of China to the Philippines, Southeast Asia, and Indonesia, to {{as far south as}} the northern coast of Australia. In the central Pacific, it has been reported from off New Caledonia, Samoa, Palau, the Marshall Islands, and Tahiti. Fossil teeth belonging to this species have been found in the Pirabas Formation of northern Brazil, dating back to the Lower Miocene (2316 Ma). The presence of these fossils indicates that the range of the {{tawny nurse shark}} once extended to the tropical Atlantic Ocean, prior to the formation of the Isthmus of Panama.|$|E
5|$|Toward {{the end of}} January, a broad low persisted {{south of}} the <b>Chagos</b> <b>archipelago,</b> {{becoming}} a tropical disturbance on January30 about 650km (400mi) south of Diego Garcia. The convection gradually organized as the system moved to the south-southwest, steered by {{a break in the}} ridge to the south caused by the remnants of Cyclone Charly. Initially the circulation was very broad, and due to its involvement with the monsoon, it resembled a monsoon depression. Early on February1, the disturbance intensified into a tropical depression while turning more to the south. Around that time, it passed about 500km (310mi) east of Rodrigues. The system became extratropical on February3, after increased wind shear weakened the convection. The former depression intensified as an extratropical storm, attaining gale force winds while accelerating its forward motion due to an approaching trough. The system was no longer tracked after February6 as it approached the polar latitudes.|$|E
5|$|Although still {{abundant}} at Cocos Island {{and other}} relatively pristine sites, grey reef sharks {{are susceptible to}} localized depletion due to their slow reproductive rate, specific habitat requirements, and tendency to stay within a certain area. The IUCN has assessed the grey reef shark as Near Threatened; this shark is taken by multispecies fisheries {{in many parts of}} its range and used for various products such as shark fin soup and fishmeal. Another threat is the continuing degradation of coral reefs from human development. There is evidence of substantial declines in some populations. Anderson et al. (1998) reported, in the <b>Chagos</b> <b>Archipelago,</b> grey reef shark numbers in 1996 had fallen to 14% of 1970s levels. Robbins et al. (2006) found grey reef shark populations in Great Barrier Reef fishing zones had declined by 97% compared to no-entry zones (boats are not allowed). In addition, no-take zones (boats are allowed but fishing is prohibited) had the same levels of depletion as fishing zones, illustrating the severe effect of poaching. Projections suggested the shark population would fall to 0.1% of pre-exploitation levels within 20 years without additional conservation measures. One possible avenue for conservation is ecotourism, as grey reef sharks are suitable for shark-watching ventures, and profitable diving sites now enjoy protection in many countries, such as the Maldives.|$|E
25|$|On 1 April 2010, the Chagos Marine Protected Area (MPA) was {{declared}} {{to cover the}} waters around the <b>Chagos</b> <b>Archipelago.</b> However Mauritius objected stating this was contrary to its legal rights, and on 18 March 2015 the Permanent Court of Arbitration ruled that the Chagos Marine Protected Area was illegal under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea as Mauritius had legally binding rights to fish in the waters surrounding the <b>Chagos</b> <b>Archipelago,</b> to an eventual return of the <b>Chagos</b> <b>Archipelago,</b> and {{to the preservation of}} any minerals or oil discovered in or near the <b>Chagos</b> <b>Archipelago</b> prior to its return.|$|E

500|$|Less {{than a month}} later, {{another area}} of {{convection}} developed within the near-equatorial trough near the <b>Chagos</b> <b>archipelago,</b> due to persistent warm water temperatures. On September6, the MFR classified it as Tropical Disturbance A2, and the next day, the JTWC initiated advisories on Tropical Cyclone 3S while the storm was over the northeastern portion of the basin. This was a fairly unusual event, as there is only an average of 0.4storms {{in the month of}} September across the southern hemisphere. Located along the northern side of a ridge, the storm tracked westward, but failed to intensity beyond 1minute winds of 75km/h (45mph) due to wind shear. On September10, the storm dissipated to the west-southwest of Diego Garcia.|$|E
500|$|On January15, a {{tropical}} disturbance began organizing near the <b>Chagos</b> <b>Archipelago</b> in the South Indian Ocean convergence zone, {{which is an}} extended area of convection connected to the monsoon. The thunderstorms gradually organized, associated with a weak circulation and located within an area of moderate wind shear. A distinct low pressure area developed on January16, about [...] east of Diego Garcia. The thunderstorms were primarily located along the western periphery due to continued shear, and ordinarily would prevent significant development. The system moved to the southwest along {{the north side of}} a ridge, and despite the shear it developed into {{a tropical}} disturbance late on January16. Subsequently, the system rapidly organized, developing rainbands as the convection increased.|$|E
500|$|Cyclone Dina {{originated}} in a tropical disturbance first noted on January15 near the <b>Chagos</b> <b>Archipelago.</b> By January17, the system had developed enough organized convection {{as it moved}} southwestward to be declared a tropical depression. Rapid intensification occurred shortly thereafter, with the system attaining winds in excess of 120km/h (75mph) on January18. Dina peaked in intensity on January20 as an intense tropical cyclone with winds of 210km/h (130mph). Hours later, the storm bypassed Rodrigues Island about [...] to its north. On January21, the storm brushed Mauritius and Réunion as an intense tropical cyclone before turning southward. Once on a southward course, steady weakening ensued and the system eventually transitioned into an extratropical cyclone on January25. The remnants of the storm accelerated southeastward and were absorbed into a polar trough on January28.|$|E
500|$|Cyclone Bonita {{originated}} from a weak area of disturbed weather observed about [...] {{to the east}} of Diego Garcia, in the <b>Chagos</b> <b>Archipelago,</b> on December 31, 1995. The system was marked by a distinct low-level circulation and curved banding features, and the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) promptly began monitoring it. A hostile upper-air pattern prevented further organization over the following several days as the disturbance drifted generally toward the southwest. On January 3, the low pressure center showed initial signs of strengthening, prompting Météo-France to declare it a tropical disturbance, the lowest of seven distinct intensity categories used by the agency. The surrounding environment became more favorable for tropical cyclogenesis, with increased upper-level divergence, and consequently, the system further matured; it was upgraded to a depression early on January 5, and to a moderate tropical storm 12 hours later. At that time, it was named Bonita. The JTWC upgraded 06S (its internal designation for Bonita) to a tropical storm equivalent early the next day.|$|E
500|$|The three Japanese heavy cruisers {{departed}} from the Combined Fleet's anchorage in the Lingga Islands on 27February. The light cruisers [...] and [...] and three destroyers escorted the force through the Sunda Strait on 1March. The raiders were supported by 10 medium bombers and three or four seaplanes based in Sumatra and west Java which conducted patrols {{in the direction of}} Ceylon. Three or four submarines from the 8thFlotilla also monitored Allied shipping movements near Ceylon, the Maldive Islands and <b>Chagos</b> <b>Archipelago.</b> The Allies did not detect the Japanese force's departure, but reinforced their forces in Western Australia after an American submarine encountered Kinu and Ōi operating near the Lombok Strait on 6March. The presence of these ships was taken to indicate that a hostile force had possibly been dispatched into the Indian Ocean. On 8March, Somerville directed all Allied ships travelling between 80 and 100° east to divert to the south or west.|$|E
500|$|Intense Tropical Cyclone Dina was a cyclone {{that caused}} record {{flooding}} across parts of Réunion. Originating from a tropical disturbance on 15 January 2002 near the <b>Chagos</b> <b>Archipelago,</b> the precursor to Dina quickly developed within a region favoring tropical cyclogenesis. By January17, the system had developed enough organized convection {{as it moved}} southwestward to be declared a tropical depression. Rapid intensification occurred shortly thereafter, with the system attaining winds in excess of 120km/h (75mph) on January18. Dina achieved its peak intensity on January20 as an intense tropical cyclone winds of 215km/h (130mph). Hours after reaching hits strength, the storm bypassed Rodrigues Island about [...] to its north. On January21, the storm brushed Mauritius and Réunion as an intense tropical cyclone before turning southward. Once on a southward course, steady weakening ensued and the system eventually transitioned into an extratropical cyclone on January25. The remnants of the storm accelerated southeastward and were last noted on January28 before being absorbed into a polar trough.|$|E
500|$|On 10 March 1917, Raven II and the [...] sailed for the Indian Ocean to {{hunt for}} the German Q-ship Wolf. For this mission she carried a Short Baby and two Short 184s.

They then searched the <b>Chagos</b> <b>Archipelago</b> and the Maldive Islands and {{returned}} to Colombo. Engine problems forced a Short 184 to make an emergency landing on 21 April in the Maldives; the crew rejoined the ship on 6 May {{after a series of}} adventures that inspired Rudyard Kipling's story [...] "A Flight of Fact". Raven II recovered the floatplane and its aircraft continued to fly search missions from Colombo until 21 May. She then joined a convoy bound for Egypt and arrived back in Port Said on 10 June.

In 2000 the Court of Appeal ruled the 1971 Immigration Ordinance preventing resettlement unlawful. In 2004, the Privy Council, under Jack Straw's tenure, overturned the ruling. In 2006 the High Court of Justice found the Privy Council's decision to be unlawful. Sir Sydney Kentridge described the treatment of the Chagossians as [...] "outrageous, unlawful and a breach of accepted moral standards": Justice Kentridge stated that there was no known precedent [...] "for the lawful use of prerogative powers to remove or exclude an entire population of British subjects from their homes and place of birth", and the Court of Appeal were persuaded by this argument, but the Law Lords (at that time the UK's highest law court) found its decision to be flawed and overturned the ruling by a 3–2 decision thereby upholding the terms of the Ordinance.|$|E
500|$|R. (Bancoult) v.

This was effected by section 4 of the Immigration Ordinance 1971 of the British Indian Ocean Territory enacted pursuant to section 11(1) of the British Indian Ocean Territory Order, which states: [...] "The Commissioner [...] may make laws for the peace, order and good government of the Territory, and such laws shall be published in such manner as the Commissioner may direct." [...] The High Court held that the 1971 Ordinance was ultra vires the Order, since removing a people from their homeland could not be regarded as within {{the power to make}} laws for the territory's [...] "peace, order and good government". Subsequently, the exclusion of the Chagossians from the land was reimposed by an Order in Council, the British Indian Ocean Territory (Constitution) Order 2004, which was made in the exercise of the royal prerogative. The legality of this Order was upheld by the House of Lords in R. (Bancoult) v. Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs (No. 2) (2008), which overruled the earlier decision. The House of Lords took the view that the phrase [...] "peace, order and good government" [...] did not entitle the courts to substitute their own view on what the phrase required for that of the Government.
