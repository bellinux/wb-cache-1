Curs 2013 - 2014 Tutor: Ángel José Rodrigo HernándezThe {{issue of}} the {{attribution}} of international responsibility to States for conduct {{of a group of}} individuals within the territory of another State has become a question of control.

40|$|One of {{the basic}} {{principles}} of an experiment is the repetition of its treatments so that treatments cannot be statistically compared without repetition. Using enough replications has a great impact on scientific validity, but in most cases, not enough attention is paid. Generally, selecting the number of replications is done according to previous experiments at similar conditions, regarding the number of replications is specifically depended on the experiment conditions. In this study effort has been made to investigate the number of treatment replications effect on the validity of experimental results by considering agricultural experiments. The results have shown that by increasing test error fluctuations and reducing the difference between the treatments that must be found to achieve a minimum level of significance and an acceptable test power, a minimum number of replications will be required. And the minimum number of required replications declines by <b>controlling</b> <b>test</b> error fluctuations. Therefore, under the same conditions, fewer replications are required for experiments under controlled conditions such as growth chamber experiments. Fewer replications will reduce test power and only through increasing the number of replications, significance level and test power can be simultaneously maintained at high level...|$|E

The {{fatigue test}} of a {{full-scale}} aircraft body aims to understand the initiation and development of fatigue damage and fatigue crack of its critical structures, and hence to determine fatigue life, maintenance and repairing cycles. The work of non-destructive testing and acoustic emission (AE) monitoring during the whole fatigue test {{plays a key role}} in guaranteeing the success of the test and achieving the prescribed goal. The <b>controlling</b> <b>test</b> of landing gears is part of this fatigue test. The main structures under considerations are uplocks and lower locks of main landing gears, uplock of nose landing gear, and actuator cylinder flanges of both gears. By using the combination of trend analysis and correlation analysis of AE parameters, real time monitoring of landing gear condition is realized, and the leak in the actuator and the linkage wearing were successfully predicted. The methods used are straightforward and direct, they can supply fast analysis speed and realize real time monitoring. The work provides a useful reference for AE signal processing in the future fatigue test or for AE monitoring technique used in the same environment of high background noise...|$|E

In this study, the results of applying the MR (magnetorheological) lateral damper on the secondary suspension to reduce the vibration of the car body, directly relating to the ride quality of railway vehicles, were mentioned. In order to verify the control performance of MR dampers, a 1 / 5 scaled railway vehicle model was constructed, and numerical simulation and experimental tests were conducted.

As a result of the test, it could be confirmed that vibration was reduced by approximately 24 % when attaching the MR damper between the bogie and the car body compared to when applying a passive damper...|$|E

40|$|Gallium-Indium alloys are {{recently}} {{applied in}} fabricating soft devices, such as stretchable sensors, electric circuits, micro pumps and optics. Its printability demonstrates {{the possibility for}} a wide extension of the application. Current fabrication methods are inefficient when printing is most handled manually, and are highly dependent on material properties. There is need for a fast way to characterize material properties, and to functionally print the given shape on the substrate. This paper presents {{the construction of an}} efficiently integrated system with optical imaging and functional printing for Gallium-Indium alloys. The imaging section allows for characterization of material properties to fast and accurately determine printing parameters in printing section. A new algorithm, which extends generalized Hough Transform, is designed to determine the contact angle of sessile drops by fitting the shape based on Bashforth-Adams equation. The results are later applied in determination of featured geometry in printing. The algorithm shows relatively low errors in profiling the sessile drop shapes. However, the results are not stable for 5 % of test pictures, and thus revisions are still needed. In addition, functional printing is finalized with a direct writing module and a friendly user interface. A series of the state-of-the-art algorithms are adopted in image analysis and <b>controlling.</b> <b>Test</b> printing shows its workability, flexibility and accordance to the previous work.

40|$|This Thesis {{develops}} {{methods for}} managing {{software and hardware}} during {{the life cycle of}} a programmable machine control platform. Life cycle management is important because of the long life cycle of this platform. Software reproducibility, management of software products, version <b>controlling,</b> <b>test</b> automation, continuous integration, and configurability of software are considered. These issues are implemented by processes for software configuration management, application life cycle management, and product life cycle management. The processes are described within the contexts of a programmable machine control platform in this Thesis. The core of this work is embedded software framework, which creates the software architecture for the platform. A previously used embedded software framework was not suitable for controlling multiple software products and it only supported few hardware platforms. In addition, the lack of community and enterprise support and the framework’s poor usability were major disadvantages. Therefore, a new embedded software framework was deployed in this Thesis. Open-source and commercial options for an embedded software framework were compared and the Yocto Project was chosen. It was the best option meeting the requirements on programmable machine control platform. Based on it, new methods were studied and specified for managing software configurations and versions, reproducibility, version controlling, and application creation. A new layer for the Yocto Project was also created in this Thesis. The new layer simplifies software and hardware modifications significantly. The layer consists of 76 files, including over 3000 lines of code and configuration information. In addition, a new server for continuous integration and test automation was deployed. It took a total of 180 working hours to create the layer and deploy the additional tools. Measurements were gathered to estimate the workload for different tasks. Furthermore, a number of metrics were created to provide a simple way to estimate the effectiveness of the tools and the processes...|$|E

In {{order to try to}} ensure that IT is aligned with the business objectives, an enterprise should ensure that it has effective IT controls for supporting its IT environment.

For instance, some of the challenges are the work effort required to complete the test, the speed of the test, accuracy, etc. Another challenge is the high cost of IT <b>controls</b> <b>testing.</b> During the accomplishment of the thesis, it has been observed that to solve the above-mentioned challenges, a lot of enterprises rely on Computer-Assisted Audit Techniques (CAAT) tools available in the market. After analyzing {{some of the most popular}} and widely used CAAT tools, it has been found out that such tools are helpful, but they are having their own challenges.

Objective: The aim was to investigate structural validity of a set of movement <b>control</b> <b>tests</b> with Rasch analysis. Design: Cross-sectional study Methods: Thirty persons with and thirty without neck pain were recruited for this study. All persons performed ten movement <b>control</b> <b>tests.</b> A partial credit model was applied to investigate item fit, ordering of the item response functions, dimensionality and hierarchy of the tests. Results: The majority of persons with neck pain had moderate disabilities and the mean value in the Neck disability index was 10. 7.
