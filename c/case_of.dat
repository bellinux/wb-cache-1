5|$|An {{important}} aspect of entertainment is the audience, which turns a private recreation or leisure activity into entertainment. The audience may have a passive role, as in the <b>case</b> <b>of</b> persons watching a play, opera, television show, or film; or the audience role may be active, as in the <b>case</b> <b>of</b> games, where the participant/audience roles may be routinely reversed. Entertainment can be public or private, involving formal, scripted performance, as in the <b>case</b> <b>of</b> theatre or concerts; or unscripted and spontaneous, as in the <b>case</b> <b>of</b> children's games. Most forms of entertainment have persisted over many centuries, evolving due to changes in culture, technology, and fashion for example with stage magic. Films and video games, for example, although they use newer media, continue to tell stories, present drama, and play music. Festivals devoted to music, film, or dance allow audiences to be entertained {{over a number of}} consecutive days.|$|E
