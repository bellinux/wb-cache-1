Food items include small aquatic crustaceans (cladocerans, copepods and ostracods), aquatic dipterans and tadpoles. As they develop, they naturally feed upon larger prey. To increase their chances for survival, some individuals grow bigger heads and become cannibals, and feed upon their own brood mates.|$|E
5|$|The smokebox was an {{integral}} part of the air-smoothed casing, being a sheet metal fabrication to the same profile as the firebox that acted as a former to maintain the shape of the <b>casing.</b> <b>In</b> between, the casing was supported by channel-section steel crinolines (strengtheners used to maintain the shape) attached to the frames. The smokebox housed the five-nozzle Lemaître blastpipe arranged in a circle within a large-diameter chimney.|$|E

In many aspects, the Agni-5 carries forward the Agni-3 pedigree. With composites used extensively to reduce weight, and a third stage added on (the Agni-3 was a two-stage missile), the Agni-5 can fly significantly more to inter-continental range.|$|E

50|$|Traditionally, sausage casings {{were made}} of the cleaned intestines, or stomachs {{in the case of}} haggis and other {{traditional}} puddings. Today, however, natural casings are often replaced by collagen, cellulose, or even plastic <b>casings,</b> especially <b>in</b> the case of industrially manufactured sausages. Some forms of sausage, such as sliced sausage, are prepared without a casing. Additionally, luncheon meat and sausage meat are now available without <b>casings</b> <b>in</b> tin cans and jars.|$|R
25|$|The major {{components}} of an ERS light are the <b>casing</b> <b>in</b> which the internal parts are mounted, an ellipsoidal reflector {{located in the}} back of the casing, a lamp mounted to position the filament at the rear focal point of the ellipsoid, a dual plano-convex lens (two plano-convex lenses facing each other in the barrel), and at the front, a gel frame to hold the color gel. The light from the lamp is efficiently gathered by the ellipsoidal reflector and sent forward through the gate, shutters and lens system.|$|E
25|$|By the {{beginning}} of the Common Era glass was being used for ornaments and <b>casing</b> <b>in</b> the region. Contact with the Greco-Roman world added newer techniques, and local artisans learnt methods of glass molding, decorating and coloring by the early centuries of the Common Era. The Satavahana period further reveals short cylinders of composite glass, including those displaying a lemon yellow matrix covered with green glass. Wootz originated in the region before {{the beginning}} of the common era. Wootz was exported and traded throughout Europe, China, the Arab world, and became particularly famous in the Middle East, where it became known as Damascus steel. Archaeological evidence suggests that manufacturing process for Wootz was also in existence in South India before the Christian era.|$|E
25|$|In most media, Skaro {{is portrayed}} as a nuclear wasteland and almost entirely devoid of plant life, with only a petrified forest located close to the Dalek city. Several {{exceptions}} are mentioned, however. Varga plants, resembling large, motile cacti studded with poisonous thorns, are seen in Mission to the Unknown (1965). Native to Skaro, they have been deliberately mutated by the Daleks to act as sentries and deter other life forms from interfering with their activities. An individual poisoned by the thorns develops an urge to kill and eventually transforms into another Varga plant. The Arkellis flower is described as being rare and only able to root in metal, with its sap being a constituent of the Golden Emperor Dalek’s metallic <b>casing.</b> <b>In</b> the TV21 comic strip The Daleks, dense undergrowth is depicted on several occasions, most notably in the mercury geyser swamps and the mutated forest.|$|E

Around this time, a former Syracuse University professor, Dr. Joel Gibert Justin, had been experimenting with firing artillery shells with gunpowder rather than compressed air, culminating in his failed invention the [...] "Justin Gun". Fascinated, Walker designed and patented an outer <b>casing</b> <b>in</b> 1891 that remedied Justin's failure. The first of his four patented inventions, Walker invested in the design with hopes it would be in great demand, but the shell never garnered enough interest.|$|E
500|$|Seeing {{stellite}} as a {{far more}} valuable metal, he decided to keep its patent for himself and founded the Haynes Stellite Company in Kokomo to produce the metal in September 1912. Many of his initial requests for the metal were from medical tool manufacturers who saw the alloy as the best for surgical tools. Because his company could not produce enough of the metal to satisfy demand, Haynes issued licenses to several companies in the United States, Canada, and Europe to produce the alloy and pay him royalties. Haynes strictly controlled production, and did not permit the other licensees to sell stellite in its raw form, but to only sell it as specific finished products. In that way, he remained the only vendor who could sell sheets of the metal. As World War I broke out, his company received large government contracts {{for use of the}} material. Stellite was found to have excellent applications in airplanes, and because it was non-corrosive and could protect its contents indefinitely, it proved to be the best metal available for ammunition <b>casing.</b> <b>In</b> 1916 alone, the company registered $1.3million in sales. The rapid growth of the business made Haynes increasingly wealthy and he became a millionaire that year. Despite his large income, he refused to provide his employees a year-end bonus, causing a significant stir in the factory. When a foreman demanded to know the reason that their wages were not raised, he told him, [...] "It doesn't pay to give the working man too much moneyit makes him too independent." [...] His statement was widely repeated and, although he claimed to have made it in jest, it alienated a large part of his workforce and began a period of labor problems.|$|E

2500|$|According to {{traditional}} Malay lore, {{the human soul}} (semangat or essence) {{is about the size}} of a thumb and appears as a miniature form of the body (sarung or <b>casing)</b> <b>in</b> which it resides. Able to fly and quickly [...] "flash" [...] from one location to another, the soul is often compared to and addressed as if it were a bird. It temporarily leaves the person's body during sleep, trance and sickness, before departing permanently at death. When the soul leaves the body it assumes the form of a sort of homunculus, and in this form can feed on the souls of others. At death, the soul usually passes into another person, animal or plant. The spirit or ghost, usually called the Anitu or Hantu, continues to linger and may be harmful to its survivors.|$|E
2500|$|The final, {{and most}} {{commonly}} used type of combustor is the fully annular combustor. [...] Annular combustors {{do away with the}} separate combustion zones and simply have a continuous liner and <b>casing</b> <b>in</b> a ring (the annulus). There are many advantages to annular combustors, including more uniform combustion, shorter size (therefore lighter), and less surface area. Additionally, annular combustors tend to have very uniform exit temperatures. They also have the lowest pressure drop of the three designs (on the order of 5%). The annular design is also simpler, although testing generally requires a full size test rig. An engine that uses an annular combustor is the CFM International CFM56. Almost all of the modern gas turbine engines use annular combustors; likewise, most combustor research and development focuses on improving this type.|$|E

The table-cloth had ball-fringe and so had the window curtains, and the carpet was a bed of roses. There were little cupboards on either side of the fireplace, and in the recesses, ill-made shelves packed with books, and enriched with pinked American cloth. There was a dictionary lying face downward on the table, and the open bureau was littered with foolscap paper and the evidences of recently abandoned toil.
