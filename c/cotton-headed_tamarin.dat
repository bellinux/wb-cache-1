40|$|Tryptic {{peptides}} of the a and /? chains from silvery marmoset (Callithrix argentatus) and <b>cotton-headed</b> <b>tamarin</b> {Saguinus oedipus) hemoglobins {{were isolated}} and se-quenced, respectively, by conventional methods. The ordering of the peptides in each chain was deduced from the homology of their sequences {{with those of}} human adult hemoglobin. The primary structures thus deduced are {{compared with those of}} other primate hemoglobins, and the rate of evolution in New World monkey hemoglobins is discussed. In connection with the molecular evolution of hemoglobins, in particular, the rate of evolution and its mechanism, we have studied the primary structures of various primate hemoglobins (1). As for the hemoglobin of New World monkeys, the complete sequences of a and / 3 chains have been reported for only two kinds of Cebidaes: spider monkey (2, 3) and capuchin monkey (4), although Boyer et al. reported the complete or partial se-quences of /? and S chains for three kinds of Cebi-daes and two kinds of Callithricidaes (2). In this paper we describe the whole sequences of the a and P chains of adult hemoglobins from silvery marmoset (Callithrix argentatus) and <b>cotton-headed</b> <b>tamarin</b> (Saguinus oedipus), which belong to Cal...|$|E
40|$|This work {{is focused}} on working with {{available}} information about biology, about conditions of population in free nature, about endanger and protection (mainly CITES, IUCN) of tribe called Callitrichidae. Then it valuates and elaborates the international trade based on information from the database CITIES during the years 1977 2013. Results are rated in case of business reasons, origin of specimen, structure of commodities, lands of import and export. Among the critical endagered species belong Leontopithecus caissara (Black-faced Lion Tamarin) with the estimated population in free nature of just only 400 pieces, Saguinus oedipus (<b>Cotton-headed</b> <b>Tamarin)</b> with the population in free nature about 6000 pieces. Trade with Common Marmoset (Callithrix jacchus), which is classified as not endangered, makes 81 % of the trade. Mostly reasons of this trade are commerce, science, zoo and medical reasons since 1990 s. Most of these pieces come from breeding in captivity and they are mostly samples and then living pieces. The biggest importers are USA and Switzerland. The biggest exporters are Germany and Great Britain. South Afrika is the biggest exporter of living pieces and Germany and Great Britain are the biggest exporters of samples...|$|E
