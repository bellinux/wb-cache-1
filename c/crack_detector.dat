40|$|Abstract. The {{dynamics}} and diagnostics of a cracked rotor have been gaining importance in recent years. The {{early detection of}} faults like fatigue cracks in rotor shafts {{are very important to}} prevent catastrophic failure of the rotor system. Vibration monitoring during start up or shut-down is as important as during steady state operation to detect cracks especially for machines such as aircraft engines which start and stop quite frequently and run at high speeds. So, the transient data of the cracked rotor has been transformed using the wavelet transforms for crack detection. Most of the works quoted in the literature used 1 D wavelets or 2 D wavelets (Continuous Wavelet Transform-CWT) for crack detection. The <b>crack</b> <b>detectors</b> in the signals are both time as well as frequency dependent. So, the use of 2 D wavelets is also not enough to detect the crack. In the present work a 3 D wavelet (CWT) has been utilized which clearly indicates both the time and frequency features of the crack. The presence of sub-criticals in the CWT may be a best crack indicator but it is not always reliable. The addition of noise to the signal may sometimes lead to inaccurate results. So, {{there is a need to}} identify a paramete...|$|R

There are some variant to IMS such as Ion trap mobility spectrometry (ITMS) or Non-linear dependence on ion mobility (NLDM) {{which are based on}} IMS principle. The sensitivity of devices using this technology is limited to pg levels. The technology also requires the ionization of sample explosives which is accomplished by a radioactive source such as nickel-63 or americium-241. This technology is found in most commercially available explosive detectors such as the GE VaporTracer, Smith Sabre 4000 and Russian built MO-2M and MO-8.

Bi-yearly checks are mandatory on such equipment in most countries by regulating agencies to ensure that there are no radiation leaks.

40|$|During {{the past}} several years the {{electromagnetics}} laboratory at NASA Langley Research Center has focused on the Aging Aircraft Program.

This paper is concerned with the problem of automatic inspection of ceramic tiles using computer vision.

Initially, We outline the benefits to the tile manufacturing industry. This is followed by a categorisation of typical tile defects.

40|$|The {{useful life}} of {{mechanical}} components which experience highly stressed rolling/sliding contacts, such as rolling element bearings or gears, {{is limited by}} rolling contact fatigue (RCF). Surface initiated pitting is a mode of RCF which has in recent years received particular attention from industry due to its frequent occurrence in service. This work focuses on the growth behaviour of RCF cracks before they develop into surface pits. A three-contact disc machine was used to perform pitting experiments on bearing steel samples. Preliminary tests showed that surface initiated cracks could be reproduced under high contact pressure and mixed lubrication regime. However, {{it was not possible}} to detect them using the vibration monitoring system installed on the test rig. This led to the development of a high sensitivity crack detection system which employs the principle of magnetic flux leakage (MFL). The existing test rig was modified to accommodate an inductive sensor and required signal acquisition electronics. In addition, a signal processing procedure was developed to enable analysis in real time. It was shown that the MFL technique is significantly more sensitive than commonly used alternatives. The system is capable of automatically finding cracks down to about 100 ??m in length. In addition, results have shown a linear relationship between defect size and signal amplitude which enables in-situ sizing of cracks. Using the <b>crack</b> <b>detector,</b> a procedure to generate cracks and extract their growth rates was established. Crack growth was first studied under high contact pressure. It was found that initiation occurred very early in total life, which was attributed to high asperity stresses due to mixed lubrication regime. Total life to pitting was dominated by crack propagation, the speed of which was shown to depend on crack size. Small cracks grew at a steady and slightly decreasing rate until a critical size is reached at which propagation speed rapidly increases, shortly followed by pitting. Further study at lower loads confirmed that contact pressure is the main parameter controlling propagation speed. In order to identify a suitable crack propagation law, the measured crack growth rates were plotted against a stress intensity parameter expressed in terms of maximum contact pressure and crack size. The results suggest that after reaching certain length, rolling contact fatigue cracks grow according to a Paris??? type power law, where the exponent of stress intensity parameter, and therefore contact pressure, was found to be approximately 7. 5.

40|$|The {{objective}} of the research is to probe into the relationship between spectrum analysis and eggshell with non-destructive and non-contact inspecting strategies. The related statistics and analysis will be conducted by information analysis software which will judge the reasonable results. The collected results can serve as the basic information of eggshell quality research. Developing an automatic eggshell cracks inspecting system. Besides, figuring out a non-contact automatic eggshell crack inspecting system is a special objective in the future. An experiment system was built to measure the impulsive response signal and connected to two detectors, an accelerometer and a TCS (thickness and crack sensor). The received signals were then analyzed using the spectrum circuit, and the data were recorded. The response time of the impulse on the non-cracked areas was less than 0. 66 ms, and {{on or near the}} cracked areas was above 0. 82 ms. Thus, the TCS was chosen and used in the commercial system. 400 million eggs detected for making preserved eggs, an accuracy of 97 % required by the producer for this local made machine was satisfied as well. Improving the eggshell quality detector under the automatic eggshell cracks inspecting system to decrease the damage and inaccuracy of the surface eggshell. Integrating previous researching result, complete the eggshell detector and develop the facilities of “eggshell crack inspecting system. ” And the electronic design of eggshell <b>crack</b> <b>detector</b> has been developed. The automatic inspecting system represents the first device for both hen and duck eggs. A non-contact eggshell crack spectrum analysis is developed with Laser Doppler Vibrometer. The experiment shows complete eggshells have two main resonant frequencies in the spectrum analysis. Cracked eggshells have three main resonant frequencies in the spectrum analysis. In this way, no matter the frequency range of Laser Doppler Vibrometer measurement is between 0 - 10 k Hz, 0 - 5 k Hz, or 0 - 1 k Hz, the scan measurement for cracked eggshells can be judged as long as the third resonant frequency is found and the single measurement far the cracked eggshells can be judged as long as the third resonant frequency is found. Therefore, Laser Doppler Vibrometer measurement is a new breakthrough for eggshell crack measurement.
