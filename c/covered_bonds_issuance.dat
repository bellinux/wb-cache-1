40|$|We study whether banksâ�� {{involvement}} {{into different}} types of securitization activity â�� asset backed securities (ABS) and covered bonds â�� in Spain influences credit supply {{before and during the}} financial crisis. While both ABS and covered bonds were hit by the crisis, the former were hit more severely. Employing a disequilibrium model to identify credit rationing, we find that firms with banks that were more involved in securitization see their credit constraints more relaxed in normal periods. In contrast, only greater <b>covered</b> <b>bonds</b> <b>issuance</b> reduces credit rationing during crisis periods whereas ABS aggravates these firmsâ�� credit rationing in crisis periods. Our results are in line with the theoretical predictions that a securitization instrument that retains risk (covered bond) may induce a more prudent risk behavior of banks than an instrument that provides risk transferring (ABS) ...|$|E

In contrast to CDOs, mortgages remain on the issuer’s consolidated balance sheet.

40|$|We {{explore the}} {{relationship}} between asset encumbrance and bank funding {{in the context of}} <b>covered</b> <b>bonds</b> a form of collateralized debt. <b>Covered</b> <b>bond</b> <b>issuance</b> influences the incidence of bank runs by unsecured creditors and, in turn, conditions in the unsecured funding market influence the bank s choice of asset encumbrance. The more reliant is the bank on secured finance and the more it encumbers assets on its balance sheet, the more concentrated are losses on unsecured creditors and the more fragile the bank. But as more stable long-term debt is added to the funding mix, the greater is the expected value of bank equity. We solve for the optimal choice of asset encumbrance and wholesale funding. Our model sheds light on how losses of confidence in funding markets, macroeconomic shocks, and improved crisis resolution frameworks affect the extent of balance sheet collateralization...|$|R
40|$|This is {{a welcome}} {{addition}} to {{the literature on the}} interaction between bank financing choices and financial stability. The main objective of the paper is to investigate the implications of the observed increase in collateralisation of financial transactions, such as over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives, and bank funding, such as repo funding and <b>covered</b> <b>bond</b> <b>issuance.</b> To this end, the paper presents a simple model of secured and unsecured bank funding to analyse the impact of increased asset encumbrance on liquidity risk, solvency risk and changes in collateral value. The main point is easily understood: collateralisation is not a panacea. Instead, increasing levels of collateralisation of bank funding may increase the procyclicality of credit provision and may even increase the probability of a sudden withdrawal of unsecured funding; also known as a bank run. The paper by Gai, Haldane, Kapadia and Nelson distinguishes nicely the microprudential benefits from the macroprudential concerns stemming from high levels of asset encumbrance. From the perspective of a supervisor that is most concerned about the stability of a single financial institution in isolation, increased levels of secured funding are a positive: secured funding is less likely to be withdrawn during times of crisis and it is cheaper than unsecured funding. Also, the mere diversification of funding sources provides some insurance against adverse developments i...|$|R
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} is to analyze the impact of Islamic <b>bond</b> <b>issuance</b> to company profitability. The company profitability is measured by return on asset (ROA) and return on equity (ROE). The method analysis that used in this study is simple linier regression with two variable dependent i. e. ROA and ROE, and one variable independent such as Islamic <b>bonds</b> <b>issuance.</b> The result showed that there is no influence on Islamic <b>bond</b> <b>issuance</b> to profitability in company that listed in Indonesian Capital Market. The reason of this result is because there is no direct impact on Islamic <b>bonds</b> <b>issuance</b> on company’s profitability.

We examine the influence of interest rate changes, expected inflation rate, and stock market returns on aggregate stock and <b>bond</b> <b>issuance</b> in Malaysia and Korea. Using vector autoregressive models (VARs) and variance decomposition techniques, our result show that dynamics of equity and <b>bond</b> <b>issuance</b> in both countries vary significantly. Our findings show {{that there has been}} a two-way relationship between interest rate changes and <b>bond</b> <b>issuance</b> in the case of South Korea, whereas, stock returns have significantly influenced the <b>bond</b> <b>issuance</b> (instead of equity issuance) in Malaysia. The findings seem to support emerging popularity of corporate bond markets in Asian region. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper empirically {{tests the}} role of bank lending {{tightening}} on non-financial corporate (NFC) <b>bond</b> <b>issuance</b> in the eurozone. By utilizing a unique data set provided by the ECB Bank Lending Survey, we capture the "pure" credit supply effect on corporate external financing. We find that tightened credit standards positively affect the NFC bond issuance: A 1 pp increase in banks reporting considerable tightening on loans leads to around a 7 % increase in firms' <b>bond</b> <b>issuance</b> in the eurozone. Focusing on a spectrum of aspects contributing to bank credit tightening, we document that banks' balance sheet constraints, {{as well as the}} perception of risk lead to significantly higher NFC <b>bond</b> <b>issuance.</b> In addition, we show that stricter lending conditions, such as wider margins, higher collateral requirements and covenants significantly increase NFC <b>bond</b> <b>issuance</b> volumes too. Furthermore, the impact of bank credit tightening on firms' <b>bond</b> <b>issuance</b> is particularly observable in core eurozone countries and not in peripheral countries. This is partially due to the underdeveloped of debt capital markets in the peripheral countries...|$|R
40|$|This paper empirically investigates firms using Islamic finance in Malaysia and Middle East countries. The {{comparative}} analysis of Islamic finance and non-Islamic finance users resulted in three major implications. First, Islamic bond issuers preferentially choose the Islamic <b>bond</b> <b>issuance</b> prior to bank borrowing and other external financing tools. Second, Islamic <b>bond</b> <b>issuance</b> {{is not related}} to the issuer’s internal funds, while Islamic bank borrowing is significantly influenced by the magnitude of a firm’s internal funds. These results suggest that Islamic bond issuers do not always choose to issue bonds based on information cost, but Islamic bank borrowers always do. Third, the Islamic <b>bond</b> <b>issuance</b> contributes to an increase in the issuer’s stock returns and total factor productivity. This empirical result suggests that Islamic <b>bond</b> <b>issuance</b> is preferred because of this unique benefit which standard external financing does not have. ...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{investigates the}} impact of US {{quantitative}} easing (QE) on global non-financial corporate <b>bond</b> <b>issuance.</b> It distinguishes between two QE instruments, MBS/GSE debt and Treasury bonds, and disentangles between two channels of transmission of QE to global bond markets, namely flow effects (purchases) and stock effects (holdings). We control {{for a number of}} domestic and global macro-financial factors. In particular, we control for weaknesses in crossborder and domestic banking which might have induced the corporate sector to issue more bonds. The results indicate that US QE had a large impact on corporate <b>bond</b> <b>issuance,</b> especially in emerging markets, and that flow effects (i. e. portfolio rebalancing) were the main transmission channel of QE. A counterfactual analysis shows that <b>bond</b> <b>issuance</b> in emerging markets since 2009 would have been halved without QE...|$|R
