40|$|The thesis {{deals with}} typical {{decisions}} made by <b>contracting</b> <b>entities</b> which restrict the competition among economic operators. The thesis analyses the typical mistakes which are made by the <b>contract</b> <b>entities</b> in awarding procedures. The causes of mistakes being made by <b>contracting</b> <b>entities</b> can be summarized into three groups. Into the first group belong conscious mistakes. For these mistakes shall be contracting entities` agents held responsible. Into the second group belong mistakes in planning. Mistakes from the third group are made {{as a consequence of}} lack of professional skills. None of these mistakes can be prevented just by an amendment to the Act on Public Contracts. Any proposal of an amendment solving the lack of professional skills shall consider also all connected negative effects; mainly additional time demands, financial costs and the risk of underfinanced praxis turning into formalism. Professionally skilled agents are usually more careful when they apply the Act on Public Contracts because they are aware of legal risks. Considering current limited budget resources it should be decided whether to put stress on cooperation with internal or external experts. The author recommends internal experts because external experts do not do their best if they are aware of the fact being not controlled effectively by internal experts. However the current Act on Public Contracts is not perfect, the duties laid by it are enforced successfully. Considering a new amendment also the legal theory shall be taken into account. The author presumes similarity of preventing of breaches against the Act on Public Contracts and of preventing of crimes. The most important factor preventing from criminality is to be aware that the punishment is inescapable, not its rates. The author points out also the opinion of the general theory of law according to which a new act is to be passed only if there is an objective necessary need. It should not to be passed by a fortuity or because of subjective views. There should be also a time space between the amendments. There was an amendment to Act on Public Contracts approved in 2010 and European Union currently prepares amending of awarding directives. The author therefore prefers improving the praxis of awarding in the Czech Republic by granting additional human resources to the Office for the Protection of Competition to passing of another amendment to the Act on Public Contracts. The scope of the Act on Public Contracts is also not convenient for amending a list of contract clauses which are not allowed to be concluded by <b>contracting</b> <b>entities.</b> There are two reasons. <b>Contracting</b> <b>entities</b> are constituted by various groups of subjects and contracts selling their property are outside the scope of the Act on Public <b>Contracts.</b> <b>Contracting</b> <b>entities</b> should use standard awarding procedure to promote competition among economic operators. They should concentrate on exactness of tender conditions.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} about the {{economic}} aspects of public procurement of services through auctionsin Sweden. It focuses on two different institutions, auctions used to find foste r-parents forboarded out children in the 19 th century, and auctions of cleaning service contracts in the 20 thcentury. I n both cases, the <b>contracting</b> <b>entity</b> is the municipality or its representative, thelowest bidder wins the auction, and is paid in accordance with his/her bid. In the child auctions, c hildren were allotted to foster-parents {{by means of an}} open biddingprocess, the descending English auction, where the bids were given continuously to theauctioneer. In modern public procurement sealed bids ar e used in accordance with the firstprice,sealed bid auction. The first part of this thesis is about price formation in the childauctions and a study is made of the children who were auctioned several times, indicatingasymmetric information among bidders or adverse selection in this market. These subjects arestudied using field data on 601 child auctions held in Northern Sweden during the period 1863 to 1889. The empirical findings in the first paper suggest that the foster-parents had a cleareconomic motive in these auctions. The child characteristics significantly affect the amount ofcompensation paid to the foster-parent. There is also evidence that farmers preferred older,more productive children. The second paper studies whether a re-auctioned child commandeda higher or lower price than a child that was not re-auctioned. The results indicate some formof asymmetric information because foster-parents demanded a higher level of compensationfor a re-auctioned child. The results also suggest that the probability that a child was reauctionedincreased if he/she was not healthy. The third paper in the thesis discusses a kind of "paradox". Although there is a competitiveeffect on the bids in the auction of cleaning service contracts, the <b>contracting</b> <b>entity</b> has anoption, given by law, to restrict the number of bidders. In th is paper, an implementation costis introduced fo r the <b>contracting</b> <b>entity</b> to justify such a restriction. The results, based onSwedish municipality data, indicate that contract and municipality characteristics, assumed toaffect the implementation cost, affect the volume of the procurement, and the number ofbidders, but not necessarily the choice of allocation mechanism. The final paper studiesregional differences in bids, costs, and competition in municipal procurement using the samedata as in paper [3]. The results show higher estimated costs for completing the contract, butlower estimated mean bids in the major city area of Stockholm compared with the res t of thecountry. This is explained by lower profit margins and higher operational costs in the majorcity area. An analysis is also carried out of why the lowest bidder is not always the contractedbidder.

40|$|Through the {{institute}} of public procurement a considerable volume of financial resources is allocated. It is therefore {{in the interest of}} <b>contracting</b> <b>entities</b> to seek ways of how to achieve an efficient allocation of resources. Some public contract-awarding entities, along with some public-administration authorities in the Czech Republic, believe that the use of a single evaluation criterion (the lowest bid price) results in a more efficient tender for a public contract. It was found that <b>contracting</b> <b>entities</b> in the Czech Republic strongly prefer to use the lowest bid price criterion. Within the examined sample, 86. 5 % of public procurements were evaluated this way. The analysis of the examined sample of public contracts proved that the choice of an evaluation criterion, even the preference of the lowest bid price criterion, does not have any obvious impact on the final cost of a public contract. The study concludes that it is inappropriate to prefer the criterion of the lowest bid price within the evaluation of public contracts that are characterised by their complexity (including public contracts for construction works and public service contracts). The findings of the Supreme Audit Office related to the inspection of public contracts indicate that when using the lowest bid price as an evaluation criterion, a public contract may indeed be tendered with the lowest bid price, but not necessarily the best offer in terms of supplied quality. It is therefore not appropriate to use the lowest bid price evaluation criterion to such an extent for the purpose of evaluating work and services. Any improvement to this situation requires a corresponding amendment to the Law on Public Contracts and mainly a radical change in the attitude of the Office for the Protection of Competition towards proposed changes, as indicated within the conclusions and recommendations proposed by this study...|$|R

40|$|Privatization of {{traditional}} governmental functions {{has been extensively}} discussed in the United States {{for more than two}} decades, and states have chosen a wide range of programs for privatization and selected a variety of implementation and oversight strategies. In this report we examine the potential for privatization, privatization pitfalls, and ways to optimize the success of privatization effects. Privatization can be attractive for one of two different reasons. It may provide a revenue benefit when the <b>contracting</b> <b>entity</b> can provide the service at a lower cost than that experienced by the governing entity. Typically, lower costs arise from lower personnel costs or through the use of less expensive methods and technologies, including IT solutions. It may also be attractive because privatization may allow government to perform specific services more effectively or more efficiently than it could with its own employees. Typically, these situations occur when a private entity can be more flexible in the deployment of personnel and resources andwhen dealing with new technologies or processes...|$|E
