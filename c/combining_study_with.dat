40|$|Abstract. The {{curriculum}} of <b>combining</b> <b>study</b> <b>with</b> {{work is the}} curriculum reform result of higher vocational education in China, {{and it has been}} proven to meet the personnel training orientation of vocational education. However, for the teaching of the {{curriculum of}} <b>combining</b> <b>study</b> <b>with</b> work, systematic guidance theory has not been produced yet, and researching on its effective teaching mode has become the most urgent problem needed to be solved at present. Project-based learning is a new teaching mode and has aroused more concern in many of our higher vocational colleges in recent years. This paper designs the project-based learning method for study-work combinative courses of higher vocational education according to the characters of the curriculum of <b>combining</b> <b>study</b> <b>with</b> work. Practice results show that the project-based learning method in this paper is suitable for teaching of study-work combinative courses of higher vocational education, stimulates students ' learning enthusiasm and improves their vocational skills and comprehensive abilities, but it requires higher energy and abilities of teachers comparing with traditional teaching methods...|$|E

Research and media reports frequently reveal that young Australian workers {{know little about}} their employment rights, placing them in a poor bargaining position and exposing them {{to the risk of}} exploitation. This study, using data from a survey of 1200 Australian university students, finds that students with experience in the labour market are more knowledgeable about their current employment arrangements and more confident about entering the graduate labour market once they finish their studies, reporting higher expectations of job security and being able to negotiate pay. Students also seem aware of segments in the graduate labour market, with confidence also varying by field of study. ...|$|E

Considering that the typical new millennium student is enrolled full time and works 18 hours per week, when 40 % of the sample (n= 148) believes that, overall, the university does not cater well to students in paid employment, alarms must sound. These are consumers who work to study, then study to improve their work prospects, and they comprise approximately 50 % of the Cairns Campus student population (2, 625, from May 2005 census). Further, about {{one quarter of the}} students surveyed admit to barely coping with the technological requirements of being a university student 9 weeks into a 13 -week semester. The conclusions here are serious, that JCU (at the very least) requires more effective means and media to cater for the needs {{of a growing number of}} students, both part time and full time, in paid employment. Ways to improve the degree of fit between the academy and working students, between students and technology, and between delivery of services and student uptake are suggested...|$|E

40|$|In Scotland, further {{education}} colleges provide 28 % of all higher education; this includes {{over half of}} part-time undergraduate higher education. This provision has contributed to wider participation in higher education in Scotland by “non traditional” students and to progress towards a mass system of higher education within a learning society. This thesis is {{a case study of}} higher education students in a Scottish {{further education}} college. It explores the nature of the students’ experience and its relevance to institutional management and higher education policy. Evidence is drawn from the college’s records, from focus groups and from a questionnaire survey of whole year groups (full-time and part-time students) over three successive years. The theoretical focus is upon a new definition of lifelong learning as learning integrated with life, drawn from literature on motive, motivation, participation and retention. The research explores the students’ experiences of <b>combining</b> <b>study</b> <b>with</b> work and family life. The student experience is found to be heterogeneous, complex and distinct from the stereotype of a young full-time university student. Vocational motives predominate and there is evidence of a significant investment of meaning, expectation and purpose in the experience of higher education. The students’ ability to balance and integrate learning with life is a determining factor in the achievement of sustained participation. The quality of support networks both in college and in the students’ work and family lives are found to be more significant than personal or demographic characteristics. The case study contributes to current thinking about the professional role of college senior managers in creating a student-centred institutional culture that responds to the complexity of the students’ experience. A case is made for a review of the current inequity of financial support for full-time and part-time higher education students and of the marginal status of colleges in the development of higher education policy.

40|$|The {{perceptions}} {{of women and}} the nature of higher education have undergone dramatic changes since the 19 th century. Women have gradually obtained the same rights and opportunities as men to pursue and participate in higher education. Today, women even outnumber men in higher education in many developed and developing countries. This study explores, from a qualitative point of view, some of the reasons why more and more women prefer to get higher qualifications and compares women’s experiences and perspectives on their higher education, work and life choices in relation to two contexts – New Zealand and China. This study began the investigation with a literature review to examine how women’s positions have increased presence and rights in political, economic, cultural and educational areas through three waves of feminism. In particular the effect the three waves had on the structure and shape of higher education and gender roles. In addition, this study also considers the gradual shift of focus in lifelong learning and the application of human capital theory (HCT) from social democratic visions to the neo-liberal ideas. This shift being the movement away from the human potential for life fulfillment to education as the mechanism to develop economies by increasing productivity and incomes. In order to examine contemporary motivations of women’s participation in higher education, and the relationship between education, employment and personal life, this study used face-to-face interviews and answering questions via e-mail with seven participants to collect the data. The participants included three Chinese women and four New Zealand women who are or were enrolled in higher education in New Zealand at the University of Waikato. Thematic analysis of interview data was combined with the review of existing literature in order to argue that the most significant motivation of women participating in higher education is to gain increased career opportunities and higher incomes. Both of these external motivations are largely a production of neo-liberal understanding of lifelong learning theory and HCT. Women accepted the individualistic responsibility of education and employability without the debating of the authenticity of these two assumptions. They assumed that the government did not need to play a role. In addition, this thesis also argues that participating in higher education is viewed by the women to be positive normally because the benefits that higher education can bring include a sense of belonging, personal growth, and active citizenship. However, the women also expressed views reflecting the pressures of work-life balance, the challenges of <b>combining</b> <b>study</b> <b>with</b> relationships or children. Thus this thesis argues that the experiences from participating in higher education are more complex and can be negative. For modern women, the main challenge is to how to balance the different demands of work, life and education. Sometimes, women have to defer marrying and having children to solely focus on study. This deferment of life course in turn can have a potential negative impact on women’s lives. Moreover, gender discrimination is still against women in relation to their educational levels, and decisions relating to family formation and age. The extent of this problem depends however on the context. While {{for the most part the}} women’s views were incredibly similar regardless of country of origin in relation to discrimination, the New Zealand and Chinese women have different perspectives, experiences or understandings. Discrimination is more common and more tolerated in China. Despite legislative changes more work needs to be done to further the rights of women in China...|$|E
