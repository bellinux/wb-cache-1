500|$|According to Jurek, {{the song}} is [...] "maybe a tad longer" [...] than it should be, {{although}} he specified {{that it was a}} [...] "small complaint". Lana Cooper of PopMatters questioned the strength of the song, and Billboards KT agreed, calling the song the most [...] "unexpected cut" [...] on the album and that [...] "one <b>could</b> <b>picture</b> the pair singing it at a writer's night somewhere". Cooper wrote that in Timberlake's [...] "unexpected surprise cameo" [...] he [...] "fades into a secondary role", as opposed to the other artists on [...] that [...] "make a strong showing" [...] next to McEntire. She wrote that Timberlake [...] "sounds pretty enough" [...] and that he does [...] "contribute a certain mood" [...] to the song, however, commented that [...] "anyone expecting more of a collaborative effort out of him would be sorely disappointed".|$|E
500|$|Speaking {{on behalf}} of its sound, Gary Graff from Billboard {{compared}} the electronic sound in [...] "Ocean" [...] to Goldfrapp's previous albums Black Cherry (2003) and Supernature (2005). Additionally, {{he felt that the}} track is unlike their previous release, Tales of Us (2013), in that it does not contain a [...] "pastoral" [...] sound. Instead, the track contains [...] "heavy electronic beats" [...] and an emphasis on [...] "pulse-pounding synths". Both Goldfrapp and Gregory acknowledged the return to using synths in their music, with the former claiming that it created a [...] "tougher sound" [...] to the track overall. Categorizing the genre of the song as synth-rock, Alexa Camp from Slant Magazine claimed that she <b>could</b> <b>picture</b> Shirley Manson singing the lyrics to [...] "Ocean". Referring to its sound as [...] "dark" [...] and [...] "churning", Spins Anna Gaca noted the [...] "pounding industrial core and [...] faintly sinister processing effect applied to [...] vocals". Labelling the track as a ballad, Sean T. Collins from Pitchfork declared it the [...] on Silver Eye. He further explained that the lyrics contain imagery depicting nature and that the composition uses [...] "big, echoey washes of sound" [...] in order to produce an [...] "enveloping, absorbing, and suffocating" [...] sound.|$|E
