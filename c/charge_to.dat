5|$|After the Early Neolithic, {{the long}} barrow {{fell into a}} state of ruined dilapidation, perhaps {{experiencing}} deliberate destruction in the Late Medieval period, either by Christian iconoclasts or treasure hunters. In local folklore, the site became associated with the burial of a prince and the countless stones motif.

Similar in size and <b>charge</b> <b>to</b> phosphorus(V), vanadium(V) also parallels its chemistry and crystallography.
