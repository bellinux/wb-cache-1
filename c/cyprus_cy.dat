40|$|Background: To advance human {{biomonitoring}} (HBM) for policy support in Europe, a harmonized approach was developed (COPHES project, FP 7 2009 - 2012) and evaluated in 17 countries (DEMOCOPHES project, Life+, 2010 - 2012). <b>Cyprus</b> (<b>CY)</b> and Luxembourg (LU) tested {{the hypothesis that}} the COPHES European Protocol is applicable to small countries. Materials and methods: In 2011 - 12, the European Protocol was adopted and tested by CY and LU for the harmonized biomonitoring of 60 children and their mothers for cadmium, phthalates and cotinine in urine and for mercury in scalp hair in two sampling areas (urban, rural). Results: Both small countries achieved the preset goals for recruitment, sample collection and analysis, which allowed {{for the first time the}} assessment of children’s and mothers’ exposures to the selected chemicals in comparison with other countries. Capacity building was accomplished and communication actions were particularly effective, with both countries taking advantage of their small size to access participants, policy makers, other stakeholders and the press. Time constrains and requirements for capacity building were limiting factors. Conclusion: The COPHES European Protocol for HBM surveys is attainable in small countries. The following elements are fundamental in the design of a harmonized European HBM program, from the perspective of small countries: (a) consultation with and active involvement of the implementing countries, (b) flexibility for national decisions, while not compromising harmonization, (c) elaboration of standardized methods, procedures and documents (d) quality assurance mechanisms, (e) means of training and support...|$|E

40|$|We {{study the}} problem of asset and {{liability}} management of participating insurance policies with guarantees. We develop a scenario optimization model for integrative asset and liability management, analyze the tradeo#s in structuring such policies, and study alternative choices in funding them. The nonlinearly constrained optimization model can be linearized through closed form solutions of the dynamic equations. Thus large-scale problems are solved with standard methods. We report on an empirical analysis of policies o#ered by Italian insurers. The optimized model results are in general agreement with current industry practices. However, some ine#ciencies are identified and potential improvements are highlighted. Earlier versions of this paper were presented at Frontiers in Finance, Paris, April 2001, Multinational Finance Society meeting, Garda, IT, June 2001, Forecasting Financial Markets 2001, London, June 2001, and seminars at Athens University of Economics and Business, Brunel University and University of Rome, and benefited from the comments of seminar participants.

40|$|Members of HIV- 1 group M are {{responsible}} {{for the vast majority of}} AIDS cases worldwide and have been classified on the basis of their phylogenetic relationships into nine roughly equidistant clades, termed subtypes. Although there are no known phenotypic correlates for these genotypes, the disproportionate spread of certain of these lineages has been taken to indicate that subtype-specific biological differences may exist. The subtype nomenclature thus remains an important molecular epidemiological tool with which to track the course of the group M pandemic. In this study, we have characterized HIV- 1 strains described previously as unusual subtype A variants on the basis of partial sequence analysis. Six such strains from <b>Cyprus</b> (<b>CY),</b> South Korea (KR), and the Democratic Republic of Congo (CD) were PCR amplified from infected cell culture or patient PBMC DNA, cloned, and sequences in their entirety (94 CY 017, 97 KR 004, 97 CDKTB 48, and 97 CDKP 58) or as half genomes (97 CDKS 10 and 97 CDKFE 4). Distance and phylogenetic analyses showed that four of these viruses (94 CY 017, 97 CDKTB 48, 97 CDKFE 4, and 97 CDKS 10) were closely related to each other, but quite divergent from all other HIV- 1 strains, except for subtype A viruses, which represented their closest relatives. In phylogenetic trees from gag, pol, env, and nef regions, the four newly characterized HIV- 1 strains formed a distinct sister clade to subtype A, which was as closely related to subtype A as subsubtypes F 1 and F 2 are to each other. According to current nomenclature rules, this defines a subsubtype, which we have tentatively termed A 2. The two other viruses, 97 KR 004 and 97 CDKP 58, as well as a full-length HIV- 1 sequence from the sequence database (ZAM 184), were found to represent complex A 2 /D, A 2 /G, and A 2 /C recombinants, respectively. These results indicate that HIV- 1 subtype A is composed of two subsubtypes (A 1 and A 2), both of which appear to have a widespread geographic distribution. The A 2 viruses described here represent the first reference reagents for this new group M lineage...|$|E
40|$|This work {{is based}} on the Cyprus Survey of Consumer Finances (CySCF) and focuses on one hand on the {{composition}} of household assets in Cyprus based on the 2002 Cyprus Survey of Consumer Finances (CySCF 2002) and on the other on the distributional changes between the 1999 and the 2002 CySCFs. From 1999 to 2002 there has been a radical increase of household participation in direct stockholding. This {{is due to the fact}} that there was a boom of the stock market with a remarkable increase of 688 % during 1999, which, however, deflated dramatically during 2000 by 65 %. In the same period a 50 % increase in the share of households with loans backed by real estate other than their primary residences was observed. Furthermore, real estate prices rose sharply in most areas and affected to a great extent the net wealth so that a more than 7. 5 % increase was observed in the mean value of the net wealth from 1999 to 2002. Finally, the work deals with the econometric analysis of debts, and results based on probit models are provided. The variables selected are age, family size, employment status and income. The typical 2002 individual was identified as a 45 -year old self-employed, married person with 3 children with a annual income of 18000 <b>Cyprus</b> pounds (1 <b>CY</b> L = 1. 7 Euros). For the 2002 typical individual the probability of being in debt is found to be 66. 5 %...|$|R
