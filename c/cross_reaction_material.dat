40|$|A {{constantly}} {{increasing number}} of immunological <b>cross</b> <b>reactions</b> are being studied {{with the aid of}} the quantitative precipitin and quantitative agglutinin techniques, and knowledge of this phase of immunological specificity is consequently taking on a more precise character. The present contribution to this subject continues earlier work (1) on the pneumococcus Type III-Type Viii <b>cross</b> <b>reaction.</b> It was shown in the earlier studies that the reaction between the specific polysacchafide of Type VIII pneumococcus (S VIII) and an antipneumococcus (anti-Pn) Type VIII horse serum, in the antibody excess region and through the equivalence zone, could be represented by the equation R 2 82 rag. antibody N precipitated = 2 RS [...] ~, in which S [...] S VIII precipitated, A = antibody nitrogen precipitated at a reference point in the equivalence zone, and R ~- ratio of A to S at the reference point (of. 1, 2), an equation which may be derived from the law of mass action and which {{has been shown to be}} applicable in many immune systems (3). However, the <b>cross</b> <b>reaction</b> between the specific polysaccharide of Type III pneumococcus (SIII) and Type VIII antiserum was of a distinctly different character. When S III was plotted against antibody N the resulting curve was not characteristic of the above equation but was composed of a steep initial portion, followed by a less steep, linear section. Since <b>cross</b> <b>reactions</b> are not always similar in the reciprocal sense it was thought of interest to make a quantitative study of the S VIII-anti-S Ill reaction, and data on this are included in the present report. An attempt was also made to isolate the antibody reactive in linear fashion in the <b>cross</b> <b>reactions,</b> as it was thought that this might show a simpler behavior toward polysaccharide than the antibody as a whole. Finally, experiments were run at 37 °C. as well as at 0 ° in order to test the effect of temperature on the <b>cross</b> <b>reaction...</b>|$|R

However, the neurological destruction mechanism was remained to be clarified. This study described the <b>cross</b> <b>reaction</b> between EV 71 induced IgG and human brain tissue. Results <b>Cross</b> <b>reaction</b> of the IgG from 30 EV 71 infected patients' sera to human tissues of cerebra was observed, which suggested that some EV 71 antigens could induce IgG cross-reactivity to human cerebra. To identify the regions of EV 71 virus that containing above antigens, the polypeptide of virus was divided into 19 peptides by expression in prokaryotes cell. Mouse anti-sera of these peptides was prepared and applied in immunohistochemical staining with human adult and fetus brain tissue, respectively. The result indicated the 19 peptides can be classified into three groups: strong cross-reactivity, weak cross-reactivity and no cross-reactivity with human brain tissue according the <b>cross</b> <b>reaction</b> activity. Then, the increased Blood Brain Barrier (BBB) permeability and permits IgG entry in neonatal mice after EV 71 infection was determined.

40|$|AIMS: To {{investigate}} the serological <b>cross</b> <b>reaction</b> between legionella and campylobacter using the rapid microagglutination test (RMAT). METHODS: Serum samples from 49 patients with campylobacter infection were tested for legionella antibodies using the indirect {{fluorescent antibody test}} (IFAT) and the RMAT. Serum samples that had positive RMAT titres were retested {{in the presence of}} a campylobacter immunosorbent. The specificity of the immunosorbent was evaluated with serum from patients with genuine legionella infection (legionella culture or antigen positive, or both). RESULTS: Fourteen (28 %) patients with campylobacter infection had positive IFAT titres (> or = 16) and 16 (32 %) patients had positive RMAT titres (> or = 8) in one or more serum samples. In addition, serum samples from 11 of 17 patients with campylobacter infection, previously shown to have positive legionella IFAT titres, were also RMAT positive. Sixteen patients had RMAT titres of > or = 32, including seven with titres of > or = 128. RMAT titres from all but one patient were significantly reduced after campylobacter absorption, but serum samples from 48 patients with legionella infection were unaffected. CONCLUSIONS: Serological <b>cross</b> <b>reaction</b> between campylobacter and legionella can occur in the legionella RMAT, as well as the IFAT.

The animals howed similar protection, as to llfe, to a challenge with H. capsulatum as they did to Blastomyces dermasqtidis.

Salvin obtained homologous sensitivity and immune reaction {{in a variety of}} experimental conditions giving living or dead organisms ofH. capsulatum to mice (Salvin, 1953, 1955 a, b). When 35 -day old mice were immunized with acetone-dried cells of B. dermatitidis and challenged six days later with H. capsulatum, no protection was demonstrable (Salvin, 1953). Reversal of this experiment im-munizing with H. capsulatum and challenging with B. dermatitidis failed likewise to produce demonstrable protection.
