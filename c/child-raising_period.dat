The direction {{and management of the}} child-life of the publishing house {{is in the hands of}} the owners, the bookshop child is also under tight control, but the employees experience less caring attention. What is the explanation for this apparently shifting and tilting balance? Is this a temporary process (one that may be linked to a specific <b>child-raising</b> <b>period),</b> or is it rather the shortage of resources of the busy parents? The developments over time suggest a shift in the centres of gravity and a temporary hesitation concerning the focal points because the shop has been renewed in the few years that have passed since the interviews, and a minor bookshop and a shop in the countryside have also been opened as the so-called family continues to grow.|$|E

The focus of my research is not on children's experiences per se but rather on women survivors' accounts about what happened to their children. I discuss various aspects of these experiences, including: being pregnant and giving birth; caring for children in and outside detention; the harm and abuse of children; losing children; and forced abortions. These stories reveal much about how women cared for and lost children as well as about what happened to children during the violence of 1965. I argue that examining these experiences must therefore also be central to understanding how women and their children survived and coped with the mass violence of 1965 - 1966. I also argue that these stories of caring for children, as well as of how children were harmed or lost, were fundamental parts of many women's testimonies. " (author's abstract...|$|R
