5|$|On January 20, 2003, during {{construction}} of a new canopy at the National Airport station, Metro began running trains through the <b>center</b> <b>track</b> even though it had not been constructed for standard operations, and a Blue Line train derailed at the switch. No injuries resulted but the crash delayed construction by a number of weeks.|$|E
5|$|A {{third track}} along {{much of the}} line north of 96th Street {{has been used in}} the past for peak {{direction}} express service, at least between 96th Street and 137th Street. This <b>center</b> <b>track</b> is currently used only during construction reroutes. There is another unused third track between Dyckman Street and Van Cortlandt Park–242nd Street. Three yards have connections to the line. The 240th Street Yard is located between Van Cortlandt Park-242nd Street and 238th Street. This yard holds 21 layup tracks and can hold the entire rolling stock for the 1. The next yard, 207th Street Yard holds a few trains that are used during rush hours and cleans and overhauls some of the line's fleet. Finally, the 137th Street Yard has six tracks, which hold rush hour turn-around trains.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of the planned extension, the two tracks {{continue}} east of this station for about 700 feet along 205th Street to Webster Avenue, ending at a concrete wall, and this station does not have any crew quarters. Crews are changed at Bedford Park Boulevard, the next station south. Additionally, there is no diamond crossover between the tracks west of this station; here, a <b>center</b> <b>track</b> forms leading west to the Concourse Yard. Because of this, terminating trains arrive on the southern (railroad northbound) track and discharge their passengers before continuing east {{to the end of the}} track. They then use the diamond crossover there to return to this station on the northern (railroad southbound) track and begin service to Manhattan and Brooklyn. Due to the track configuration, trains may reverse into the yard from the southern track, and trains from the yard may start service on the northern track.|$|E

5|$|Stations {{along the}} three-tracked {{stretch of the}} Culver Line are being renovated until early 2018 (excluding Ditmas Avenue and the {{northbound}} platform of Avenue X, which were rehabilitated in 2015–2016), with the <b>center</b> <b>track</b> being used to bypass closed stations. The Coney Island-bound platforms were rehabiliated between June 7, 2016 and May 1, 2017 (May 8 for Avenue U and Avenue X). During {{the second phase of}} the project, beginning on May 22, 2017, the Manhattan-bound platforms will be closed between Avenue U and 18th Avenue until early 2018. Even after the rehabilitation, though, peak-direction express service between Church Avenue and Kings Highway will not be restored due to limitations caused by current track configurations, as the switches at Kings Highway previously used were removed in the 1990s. The interlocking at Kings Highway is scheduled to be modernized as part of the 2020–2024 MTA Capital Plan, and the modernization could include the reinstallation of the necessary track switches.|$|E

50|$|There {{are four}} tracks and two side platforms, much like in local {{stations}} {{on the subway}} system. The two <b>center</b> <b>tracks</b> lead to the 207th Street Yard. They merge with the two outer tracks south of this station and there are crossovers and switches between all four tracks to the north. Some northbound A trains terminate here before being taken out {{of service to the}} yard by switching to the <b>center</b> <b>tracks</b> north of this station.|$|R

25|$|Almost {{everywhere}} express trains run, {{they run}} on the inner one (of 3) or two (of 4) tracks, and local trains {{run on the}} outer two tracks. In a 3-track configuration, the <b>center</b> <b>track</b> can be used {{toward the center of}} the city in the morning and away from the center in the evening, though not every 3-track line has that express service.|$|E
25|$|Past Grant Avenue, {{the line}} joins the former Fulton Street {{elevated}} via a ramp as it enters Queens, swinging somewhat north {{until it is}} over Liberty Avenue. Here, it becomes a three-track line, with the <b>center</b> <b>track</b> coming from Pitkin Yard. Just past Rockaway Boulevard, the IND Rockaway Line branches southward while the Fulton Street Line continues over Liberty Avenue to its terminus at Lefferts Boulevard.|$|E
25|$|Railroad south (geographically east) of the station, {{the line}} gains a <b>center</b> <b>track</b> from Pitkin Yard, leaves the subway tunnel and ramps {{up to the}} {{elevated}} tracks along Liberty Avenue. At the tunnel portal, another track from Pitkin Yard merges with the southbound local track. The line continues as three tracks, towards 80th Street station on Liberty Avenue. The two yard tracks are located under the station.|$|E

25|$|Canal Street on the Main Line {{has four}} tracks and two side platforms. Only the outer local tracks, provide through service via the Montague Street Tunnel. The <b>center</b> <b>tracks,</b> which {{have never seen}} revenue service, begin at the unused lower level of City Hall and run north to here, dead-ending at bumper blocks {{about two-thirds of the}} way through. The <b>center</b> <b>tracks</b> can be used for layups, but this use has been {{completely}} made redundant with the nearby City Hall lower level being used as a layup yard instead.|$|R

25|$|From December 2001 to June 2010, {{this station}} was known on transit maps and {{announced}} on digital announcements as Lower East Side–Second Avenue, when {{it served as}} the southern terminal for V trains, which arrived and departed on either <b>center</b> <b>track.</b> From the V's elimination until July 2017, the center tracks were not used in revenue service, when they were reactivated to accommodate limited rush-hour short turns of southbound M trains.|$|E
25|$|Whitehall Street–South Ferry on the BMT Broadway Line {{has three}} tracks and two island platforms. The outer tracks {{continue}} south into the Montague Street Tunnel to the BMT Fourth Avenue Line in Brooklyn, {{and are used}} by late-night N trains and daytime R trains. The <b>center</b> <b>track,</b> used to terminate late-night R trains from Brooklyn and weekday W trains from Queens, merges with the outer tracks {{at both ends of}} the station.|$|E
25|$|The {{line has}} two {{distinct}} sections, split by the Queensboro Plaza station. It {{begins as a}} three-track subway, with the <b>center</b> <b>track</b> used for express service, at Flushing–Main Street. It quickly leaves the ground onto a steel elevated structure above Roosevelt Avenue, passing Citi Field and the United States Tennis Association's National Tennis Center. A flying junction between Mets–Willets Point and 111th Street provides access to the Corona Yard from the local tracks. At 48th Street in Sunnyside, the line switches to Queens Boulevard and an ornate concrete viaduct begins. The express track ends between 33rd Street–Rawson Street and Queensboro Plaza.|$|E

25|$|The {{north end}} of the Crosstown Line is a flying {{junction}} with the IND Queens Boulevard Line and 60th Street Tunnel Connection just south of Queens Plaza. The line then travels south as a two-track line, except for a center relay track south of Court Square. At the turn from Marcy Avenue to Lafayette Avenue, two center tracks appear, merging into one after crossovers to the main tracks. These tracks were to be used for a split to another line in a 1931 expansion plan. This <b>center</b> <b>track</b> continues through Bedford–Nostrand Avenues and then ends with crossovers to the main tracks, but space remains in the center through Classon Avenue for the third track.|$|E
25|$|East of the station, {{the center}} tracks also {{continue}} disused along Houston, but rise to an upper level and stub-end near Avenue A at bumper blocks. Near the end, these tail tracks begin to separate {{to create a}} provision for a <b>center</b> <b>track</b> which only extends about 10 or 15 feet and stops at the bulkhead {{at the end of}} the tunnel. It was planned that these tracks would continue under the East River to the South Fourth Street Line, part of a never-built system expansion. These tracks east of the station were previously used for train storage but became an oft-frequented spot for the homeless due to its location near local missions and soup kitchens. The area was cleared out in 1990, and corrugated metal walls with bumper blocks were installed just past the east end of the platforms to seal the tunnels.|$|E
2500|$|Just {{south of}} the station, a fifth <b>center</b> <b>track</b> begins, formed by a {{connection}} from each express track. This track merges back into the two express tracks just before 34th Street–Penn Station. This <b>center</b> <b>track</b> {{was used in the}} past for turning rush hour [...] "Gap Trains", which would head back up north. It is currently used for short turning 3 trains during nights.|$|E
