I. The {{experiments were}} based on the assuption that finding the components of odorous substances that are produced by a decrease in freshness of meat would provide a clue for measuring the freshness. First, by separating the fresh meat from the putrefied meat it was found that the odorous substances is composed of volatile basic substances. 1. From the acidic part, seven volatile fatty acids (formic. Acetic, i- and n-butyric, i-valeric, caproic, and <b>caprylic</b> <b>acids)</b> were obtained, and they were identified by comparing the chromatogram of the sample with that of the mixture of pure fatty acids. 2. Between Rf. 0. 04 and 0. 28 were found nine spots of fatty acid that are con-sidered to being to two or three varieties of basic acids. 3. In the fresh meat, the odorous substances obtained were formic and acetic acids. 4. In the putrefied meat, formic, acetic, butyric, valeric, caproic, and capry-lic acids were also found by chromatogram. Judging from the color intensity of the spots, among the six acids, the above-mentioned acetic and caproic acid were great in quantity, but the quantity of i- and n-butyric, formic and <b>caprylic</b> <b>acids</b> was slight. 5. From the basic part, it was found though not clearly, to be only piperidine in the case of fresh meat. 6. In the case of putrefied meat, ammonia, trimethylamine piperidine, pyridine and four unidentified amines were descerned. With regard to quantity, trimetylamine and ammonia were found but pyridine and piperidine were foundonly in small amounts. II.

40|$|Sulphonated {{hydrothermal}} carbon (SHTC), {{obtained from}} d-glucose by mild hydrothermal carbonisation and subsequent sulphonation with sulphuric acid, {{is able to}} catalyse the esterification of glycerol with different carboxylic acids, namely, acetic, butyric and <b>caprylic</b> <b>acids.</b> Product selectivity can be tuned by simply controlling the reaction conditions. On the one hand, SHTC provides {{one of the best}} selectivity towards monoacetins described up to now without the need for an excess of glycerol. On the other hand, excellent selectivity towards triacylglycerides (TAG) can be obtained, beyond those described with other solid catalysts, including well-known sulphonic resins. Recovery of the catalyst showed partial deactivation of the solid. The formation of sulphonate esters on the surface, confirmed by solid state NMR, was the cause of this behaviour. Acid treatment of the used catalyst, with subsequent hydrolysis of the surface sulphonate esters, allows SHTC to recover its activity. The higher selectivity towards mono- and triesters and its renewable origin makes SHTC an attractive catalyst in biorefinery processes.

Microemulsions containing MG and TG were isotropic, fluid, and clear, with internal phase diameters of 27 and 52 nm, respectively. Both MG- or TG-containing microemulsions markedly increased lycopene penetration in the stratum corneum, (6 - and 3. 6 -fold, respectively) and in viable layers of porcine ear skin 2 (from undetected to 172. 6 +/- 41. 1 and 103. 1 +/- 7. 2 ng/cm(2), respectively) compared to a control solution. To assure that lycopene delivered to the skin was active, the antioxidant activity of skin treated with MG-containing microemulsion was determined by CUPRAC assay, and found to be 10 -fold higher than untreated skin. The cytotoxicity of MG-containing microemulsion in cultured fibroblasts was similar to propylene glycol (considered safe) and significantly less than of sodium lauryl sulfate (a moderate-to-severe irritant) at 1 - 50 mu g/mL.

5|$|Brain tissue consumes a {{large amount}} of energy in {{proportion}} to its volume, so large brains place severe metabolic demands on animals. The need to limit body weight in order, for example, to fly, has apparently led to selection for a reduction of brain size in some species, such as bats.

In primates, however, the percentage is much higher—in humans it rises to 20–25%. The energy consumption of the brain does not vary greatly over time, but active regions of the cerebral cortex consume somewhat more energy than inactive regions; this forms the basis for the functional brain imaging methods PET, fMRI, and NIRS.

Dermatophilosis causes extensive damage within the animal industry, including loss of days at work, reduction in milk yield, and deterioriation of hide and meat quality. This disease requires quick diagnostic tools and sustainable treatment to avoid economic losses. ^ The 1029 bp DNA segment of the alkaline ceramidase gene of D. congolensis was targeted to develop a species-specific PCR to speed up the diagnostic and treatment process to minimize economic losses.

After incubation, the mixtures were diluted 10 -fold up to 10 - 4 concentration to obtain countable colonies using Middlebrook 7 H 10 agar plates and LowensteinJensen (L-J) slants. Colony growths of M. tuberculosis were examined in each dilution every week for three to eight weeks. Results: Both brands of VCO at increasing dilution from 1 : 10 to 1 : 10000 lowered the colony counts of M. tuberculosis by 46 % to 100 % on the Middlebrook 7 H 10 agar. Similar results were noted on L-J slants with colony counts decreasing by 25 % to 96 %. Lauric acid solution showed complete inhibition of bacterial growth in both the agar plates and LJ slants. Conclusion: Different VCO preparations containing different amounts of lauric acid exhibited different degree of inhibition against M. tuberculosis. The result of the study suggests the Functional Foods in Health and Disease 2012, 2 (8) : 290 - 299 potential of VCOs agent against the growth of M. tuberculosis Similar effect on other organisms is a possibility and should also be explored. But more studies are needed to replicate the studies using different concentrations of VCOs, lauric acid and other fatty acids in VCO such as myristic <b>acid,</b> caproic or <b>caprylic</b> <b>acids...</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Colorectal cancer, {{breast cancer}} and skin cancer are commonly-reported cancer types in the U. S. Although {{radiation}} and chemotherapy are routinely used to treat cancer, they produce side effects in patients. Additionally, resistance to chemotherapeutic drugs has been noticed in cancers. Thus, {{there is a need}} for effective and safe bioprophylactics and biotherapeutics in cancer therapy. The medicinal value of goat milk has been recognized for centuries and is primarily attributed to three fatty <b>acids,</b> namely capric, <b>caprylic</b> and caproic <b>acids.</b> This research investigates the anticancer property of these fatty acids on human colorectal, skin and mammary gland cancer cells. The cancer cells were treated with various concentrations of fatty acids for 48 h, and cell viability was monitored by the 3 -(4, 5 -dimethylthiazol- 2 -yl) - 2, 5 -diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) reduction assay. Additionally, real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) was performed to elucidate the potential anti-cancer mechanisms of the three fatty acids under investigation. Capric, <b>caprylic</b> and caproic <b>acids</b> reduced cancer cell viability by 70 % to 90 % (p < 0. 05) compared to controls. RT-qPCR data indicated that these natural molecules produced anticancer effects by down-regulating cell cycle regulatory genes and up-regulating genes involved in apoptosis...|$|R
