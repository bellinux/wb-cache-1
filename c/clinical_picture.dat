5|$|Pneumothorax was {{described}} in 1803 by Jean Marc Gaspard Itard, a student of René Laennec, who provided an extensive description of the <b>clinical</b> <b>picture</b> in 1819. While Itard and Laennec recognized that some cases were not due to tuberculosis (then the most common cause), the concept of spontaneous pneumothorax {{in the absence of}} tuberculosis (primary pneumothorax) was reintroduced by the Danish physician Hans Kjærgaard in 1932. In 1941, the surgeons Tyson and Crandall introduced pleural abrasion for the treatment of pneumothorax.|$|E

40|$|Children and {{adolescents}} {{exposed to the}} same source of carbon monoxide {{have been shown to}} demonstrate different <b>clinical</b> <b>pictures</b> (1, 2). The same condition probably may be extrapolated between children with varying ages and hence lung surface areas. Smaller children will receive larger doses of carbon monoxide, because they have greater lung surface area/body weight ratios and increased minute volumes/weight ratios. As carbon monoxide accumulation is expected to be more significant nearer to the ground, another explanation for varying <b>clinical</b> <b>pictures</b> in poisoning events may be the different level of sleeping positions of the casualties. Herein, we report a cluster poisoning of carbon monoxide affecting 5 children from the same family at the same time but in different <b>clinical</b> <b>pictures.</b> [TAF Prev Med Bull 2013; 12 (1. 000) : 118 - 118...|$|R

25|$|The extra {{chromosome}} {{in people}} with idic(15) can be easily detected through chromosome analysis (karyotyping). Additional tests are usually required.

25|$|Adler (1995) cautioned {{the failure}} of modern {{medicine}} to implement the biopsychosocial model, which incorporates all aspects of a patient’s experience in a scientific approach into the <b>clinical</b> <b>picture,</b> often results in chronically-ill patients deferring to non-traditional and alternative forms of therapy, seeking {{to be understood as}} a whole, not a part, which may be problematic among patients with FSS.|$|E

40|$|Mitochondrial {{diseases}} are {{a group of}} disorders due to a mitochondrial respiratory chain deficiency. They may depend on mitochondrial genome (mtDNA-related disorders) {{as well as on}} a nuclear genome defect (nDNA-related disorders). mtDNA-related disorders encompass an increasing number of <b>clinical</b> <b>pictures</b> associated with more than 250 different provisional or confirmed pathogenic changes in mtDNA. Although some clinical syndromes are nosologically defined, most of the cases present with polymorphous phenotypes ranging from pure myopathy to multi-system involvement. Complexity of mitochondrial genetics is in part responsible for the extreme clinical intra- and inter-familial heterogeneity of this group of diseases. In this review, we briefly report an updated classification and overview the main <b>clinical</b> <b>pictures</b> of this class of diseases...|$|R
25|$|The {{prognosis}} of {{a patient}} with severe OTC deficiency is well correlated with {{the length of the}} hyperammonemic period rather than the degree of hyperammonemia or the presence of other symptoms, such as seizures. Even for patients with late onset forms of the disease, their overall <b>clinical</b> <b>picture</b> is dependent on the extent of hyperammonemia they have experienced, even if it has remained unrecognized.|$|E
25|$|Arsenic {{interferes with}} {{cellular}} longevity by allosteric inhibition of an essential metabolic enzyme pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) complex, which catalyzes the oxidation of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA by NAD+. With the enzyme inhibited, the energy {{system of the}} cell is disrupted resulting in a cellular apoptosis episode. Biochemically, arsenic prevents use of thiamine resulting in a <b>clinical</b> <b>picture</b> resembling thiamine deficiency. Poisoning with arsenic can raise lactate levels and lead to lactic acidosis.|$|E
25|$|More {{advanced}} imaging techniques {{can be used}} if the <b>clinical</b> <b>picture</b> is unclear; the exact role of different imaging modalities remains uncertain. Some studies have demonstrated findings on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI scan) that can differentiate between septic arthritis and transient synovitis (for example, signal intensity of adjacent bone marrow). Skeletal scintigraphy can be entirely normal in transient synovitis, and scintigraphic findings do not distinguish transient synovitis from other joint conditions in children. CT scanning does not appear helpful.|$|E

40|$|Developmental disabilities, {{including}} learning difficulties (LD), attention-deficit {{hyperactivity disorder}} (ADHD) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD), are syndromes that have unclear etiologies and are diagnosed {{on the basis}} of their clinical features. Developmental disabilities show high rates of comorbidity, resulting in similar <b>clinical</b> <b>pictures</b> in many cases. However, these similar <b>clinical</b> <b>pictures</b> may be based on different underlying factors that can be determined by microscopic observation or tests. In this study, differential assessments that were based on research using laboratory-based cognitive tasks were proposed for differentiating between the underlying factors that contribute to similar <b>clinical</b> <b>pictures</b> of developmental disabilities. These factors, which should be treated using a different therapeutic approach, include the following: 1) error monitoring (the primary deficit typically observed in LD) and mental effort (typically observed in ADHD) with respect to careless mistakes; 2) response decision (typically observed in ADHD) and motor inhibition (typically observed in oppositional defiant disorder/conduct disorder) with respect to behavioural inhibition and 3) preattentive processing (typically observed in LD) and weak central coherence (typically observed in ASD) with respect to global perception. These differential assessments may provide detailed and individualized understanding and support to individuals with developmental disabilities and critical information for the differential diagnosis of developmental disabilities...|$|R
25|$|The <b>clinical</b> <b>picture</b> {{is often}} {{dominated}} by the underlying cause.The symptoms of acute kidney injury result from the various disturbances of kidney function {{that are associated with}} the disease. Accumulation of urea and other nitrogen-containing substances in the bloodstream lead to a number of symptoms, such as fatigue, loss of appetite, headache, nausea and vomiting. Marked increases in the potassium level can lead to abnormal heart rhythms, which can be severe and life-threatening. Fluid balance is frequently affected, though blood pressure can be high, low or normal.|$|E
25|$|The {{diagnosis}} is {{made on the}} <b>clinical</b> <b>picture.</b> Routine blood tests (complete blood count, electrolytes, renal function, liver enzymes) are typically performed. Mast cell tryptase levels may be elevated if the attack was due to an acute allergic (anaphylactic) reaction. When the patient has been stabilized, particular investigations may clarify the exact cause; complement levels, especially depletion of complement factors 2 and 4, may indicate deficiency of C1-inhibitor. HAE type III is a diagnosis of exclusion consisting of observed angioedema along with normal C1 levels and function.|$|E
25|$|Biopsies of the mucosa {{are taken}} to {{definitively}} diagnose UC and differentiate it from Crohn's disease, which is managed differently clinically. Microbiological samples are typically taken {{at the time of}} endoscopy. The pathology in ulcerative colitis typically involves distortion of crypt architecture, inflammation of crypts (cryptitis), frank crypt abscesses, and hemorrhage or inflammatory cells in the lamina propria. In cases where the <b>clinical</b> <b>picture</b> is unclear, the histomorphologic analysis often plays a pivotal role in determining the diagnosis and thus the management. By contrast, a biopsy analysis may be indeterminate, and thus the clinical progression of the disease must inform its treatment.|$|E

25|$|The extra {{chromosome}} is occasionally {{found in}} the mosaic state, i.e. some of the cells carry the marker chromosome. However, mostly because of the marker's instability and tendency to be lost during cell division (mitosis), some cells are completely normal with 46 chromosomes. Occasionally, cells may {{have more than one}} idic(15), resulting in 48 or 49 chromosomes in all or some of their cells. A similar <b>clinical</b> <b>picture</b> albeit to a milder degree could be expected in individuals that have the extra chromosome 15 material as an interstitial duplication (when the extra piece of chromosome 15 is included within the long arm of one of the two copies of chromosome 15, rather than as a small extra 'marker' chromosome) - often abbreviated to int dup(15); the individual thus having 46 chromosomes.|$|E
25|$|Diagnosis of {{hepatitis}} is {{made on the}} basis of some or all of the following: a patient's signs and symptoms, medical history including sexual and substance use history, blood tests, imaging, and liver biopsy. In general, for viral hepatitis and other acute causes {{of hepatitis}}, the patient's blood tests and <b>clinical</b> <b>picture</b> are sufficient for diagnosis. For other causes of hepatitis, especially chronic causes, blood tests may not be useful. In this case, liver biopsy is the gold standard for establishing the diagnosis as histopathologic analysis is able to reveal the precise extent and pattern of inflammation and fibrosis. However, liver biopsy is typically not the initial diagnostic test because it is invasive and is associated with a small but significant risk of bleeding that is increased in patients with liver injury and cirrhosis.|$|E
25|$|Some vector {{competence}} {{studies have}} been undertaken on Ixodes holocyclus {{with respect to the}} Lyme disease pathogen Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto (with a United States strain). These suggested that the tick can not transmit this strain of spirochaete (. Despite this, there is a strong belief that some kind of Lyme-like spirochaete causes a Lyme-like disease in Australia and that it is carried by Ixodes holocyclus. At the Royal North Shore Hospital in Sydney the Tick-borne Diseases Research Unit continues its study into this issue. Cases of Lyme-like disease are being diagnosed on the basis of clinical signs (often musculoskeletal, chronic fatigue, neurological and dermatological), exclusion of other infections, serology (which is supportive but not conclusive), and response to antibiotic treatment. Initially, antibiotics may cause a worsening of symptoms (the Herxheimer reaction), as spirochaetes are destroyed, which in part supports the diagnosis. This Australian form of Lyme-like borreliosis is associated with a different <b>clinical</b> <b>picture</b> from true Lyme disease of North America.|$|E

40|$|Crohn {{disease is}} a {{pathology}} of the adulthood although, in the last twenty years, has interested also childhood.

The <b>clinical</b> <b>pictures</b> of Crohn’s disease, in many cases, are nonspecific, above all in pediatrics; this fact imposes to the pediatrician to correlate the Crohn’s disease even to common <b>clinical</b> <b>pictures</b> like development deficency and/or anorexia.
