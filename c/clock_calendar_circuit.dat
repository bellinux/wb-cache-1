The clock proved a success and the business grew rapidly, so that a year later the factory moved to larger quarters, continuing to grow until 1874 when a change of management saw the capital increasing to $150,000. This necessitated the construction of a large three-story brick building which burnt down in 1876, but was promptly rebuilt.
