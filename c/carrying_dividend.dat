However, an adverse aspect for companies is related to taxation of this subsequent distribution, due to the risk that tax authorities might reclassify this operation and, implicitly, apply penalties for late payment of dividends, starting with the 1 st of January of the financial year following {{the one in which}} the carry forward of the profits of the previous financial year has been approved, and until the payment of related tax. ...|$|R
50|$|The company, {{incorporated}} {{under the}} 1856 {{and then the}} 1862 Acts, had £60,000 of share capital, divided into 600 £100 shares, each subdivisible by five. Capital could be increased according to art 27 by the general meeting. New shares {{would be the same}} as old shares, and {{there was no mention of}} priority or preference shares. The company wished to buy a meter manufacturing business that was in administration from one John West, and wished to change its articles to allow preferential shares to be allotted to him, as part of the consideration for the deal. There would be 100 £100 shares, <b>carrying</b> a preferential <b>dividend</b> of £5 each.|$|R
40|$|The {{taxation}} {{of capital}} gains for Managed Investment Funds in New Zealand was abolished in October 2007, putting these entities {{on a similar}} footing to private investors. Prior to this change most private investors were not taxed on capital gains from investments in New Zealand companies, whereas Managed Funds were taxed on these gains. New Zealand company <b>dividends</b> <b>carry</b> imputation tax credits and thus had a tax advantage for Managed Funds before October 2007. After the change the value of dividends relative to capital gains declined substantially for Managed Funds. The evidence is that {{the market value of}} the dividends, particularly for high dividends, also declined substantially subsequent to the tax change...|$|R
40|$|Changes in {{dividend}} convey {{information about}} the earnings of the announcing firm which in turn affect the price. Security price depends on current earnings, past earnings, and future prospect of earnings. Dividend relevant theory postulates that dividend policy, dividend initiation and changes in <b>dividend</b> <b>carry</b> {{information about the}} market value of the announcing firms. Accordingly, an unexpected increase in dividends conveys positive information about the future profitability of the firm and vice versa. Firm’s management is better informed than the market about the future prospects of their firm and therefore, their action relating to any financing decision conveys information to the investors. The principal {{purpose of this study was}} to examine the intra-industry information effects of announcements of dividend initiations of the firms associated with Dhaka Stock Exchange (DSE). To test this hypothesis, we used Herfindahl Index and Tobin’s q ratio. The study found that the intra-industry effects of dividend revisions are apparent. ...|$|R
40|$|Unlike an {{important}} series of recent papers, {{we find that}} <b>dividends</b> <b>carry</b> an im-portant message about future earnings. As in previous research, we find that dividend changes are better at “predicting” past rather than future earnings growth rates. However, we show that changes in payout {{have something to say}} about earnings levels over the medium run. A dividend increase indicates that average earnings will be at a higher level in the future. The converse is true in the case of dividend decreases. The finding is extremely robust. This can be understood if we think of a very well-documented feature of payout policy: the nearly-unanimous reluctance to cut dividends. If managers cut dividends only when “they have to”, and only increase them when they are sure they will not have to decrease them again in the near future, then dividend changes will be closely associated with shifts in average earnings. We suggest that this pattern of managerial behavior can be rationalized if share-holders save on monitoring costs and rely to some extent on dividend information. Our results also warn against too literal interpretations of classical signalling models...|$|R
40|$|The main {{aim of this}} {{doctoral}} thesis is to <b>carry</b> the <b>dividend</b> debate into an emerging market context, and contribute more evidence to dividend literature. This, however, is done different to prior research, by examining the dividend policy behaviour of an emerging market {{over a period of}} time, after implementing serious economic and structural reforms in order to integrate with world markets. Accordingly, therefore, attempting to uncover what behaviour the dividend policy of this emerging market shows. In particular, the dividend policies of the companies listed on the Istanbul Stock Exchange (ISE) are analysed. Turkey offers an ideal setting for studying dividend behaviour as a developing country, which implemented major reforms, starting with the fiscal year 2003 in compliance with the IMF stand-by agreement as well as adopting the EU directives and best-practice international standards for a better working of the market economy, outward-orientation and globalisation. Research results suggest that the ISE-listed firms follow the same firm-specific determinants of dividend policy as proposed by dividend theories, and as suggested by empirical studies conducted in developed markets following Turkey’s adoption of the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and inflation accounting, starting with the fiscal year 2003. Specifically, the primary firm-specific determinants of dividend policy are profitability, debt level, firm size, investment opportunities and firm age {{in the context of an}} emerging Turkish market. The findings of this thesis indicate that implementing major economic and structural reforms, adopting more flexible mandatory dividend policy regulations and attempting to prevent insider lending (non-arm’s length transactions) have led the ISE firms to adjust their cash dividends toward their target payout ratio by smoothing their dividends as suggested by Lintner (1956) and as exemplified by companies in developed markets. Hence, Turkish corporations have also been adopting stable dividend policies and using cash dividends as a signalling mechanism since 2003, with the implementation of severe economic and structural reforms.

Hence, Turkish corporations have also been adopting stable dividend policies and using cash dividends as a signalling mechanism since 2003, with the implementation of severe economic and structural reforms. Research evidence reveals that the ISE-listed firms have highly concentrated ownership structures; mostly owned by families followed by foreign investors, whereas other blockholders such as domestic financial institutions and the state, show relatively lower shareholdings. Moreover, evidence implies that the implementation of various major economic and structural reforms in cooperation with the IMF and the EU directives and best-practice international standards, which include the publication of the Capital Market Board (CMB) of Turkey’s Corporate Governance Principles in line with the World Bank and the OECD, starting with the fiscal year 2003, have resulted in significant improvements for the ISE-listed firms corporate governance, transparency and disclosure practices and better shareholder protection. Investors, in general, therefore, have preference for the potential long-run growth opportunity for the stocks they hold in the ISE, since Turkey is a fast-growing market, rather than requiring cash dividends as a monitoring mechanism or to control agency problems. This thesis extends empirical research on dividend policy into an emerging market, which not only passed laws for financial liberalisation, but implemented serious reforms to integrate with world markets by using a large panel dataset from Turkey. Although the implementation of major reforms and regulatory changes may produce different results in different emerging markets, it is believed that this thesis can be a valuable benchmark for further longitudinal and cross-country research on this respect of the dividend puzzle...|$|R
