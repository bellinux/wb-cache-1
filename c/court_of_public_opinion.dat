40|$|This {{thesis is}} an attempt to broaden {{awareness}} of Soviet perceptions management. Perceptions management activities are designed to influence public and policy maker opinion unfavorably toward the United States and favorably toward the Soviet Union. The resources devoted to active measures, propaganda, and disinformation extend throughout the Soviet bureaucratic structure and are directed both internally and abroad. Soviet <b>courting</b> <b>of</b> <b>public</b> <b>opinion</b> within a democracy is designed to turn an open political system against itself. If the United States is to function effectively as a democratic role model, an increased awareness is needed of the particular strengths and weaknesses of democracy, along with a rededication to democratic principles.

This was far lower than the general expectation—one authority thought that the award should have been twice or even three times that amount, given the level of hazard in bringing the derelict into port. Cochrane's final words were harshly critical of Morehouse for his decision, earlier in the hearing, to send Dei Gratia under Deveau to deliver its cargo of petroleum—although Morehouse had remained in Gibraltar at the disposal of the court.

50|$|A contest erupted {{between the}} two {{companies}} in the <b>courts</b> <b>of</b> <b>public</b> <b>opinion</b> and <b>of</b> law, each one claiming to be {{the recipient of the}} land grants. West Side construction was stopped when Portland's guarantee on bond interest was declared in violation of the city charter. Simon G. Elliott of California, promoter of the East Side Company, procured the assistance of businessman Ben Holladay, who in 1868 persuaded the state legislature to reassign the grant to that company, and Congress to extend the time for completion. The first 20 mi, from Portland to New Era, were completed by December 1869, thus enabling the East Side Company to receive its first pieces of land. The terminus of the East Side line was connected to Downtown Portland by ferry; first, with a boat operated by Holladay, and from about 1879 to 1889, with a new boat (later relocated to San Francisco Bay) built and operated by Henry Villard. The West Side Company obtained its own grant through an 1870 law that would give it land for a line from Portland to Astoria with a branch to McMinnville, but its owners sold the company to Holladay in 1870, and it only built about 47 mi between Portland and Saint Joseph (near McMinnville), opening the line in November 1872.|$|R

But most Americans do not hold extreme beliefs about affirmative action; indeed, the American public embraces no coherent conception of what “affirmative action” actually entails. When President Bill Clinton directed a team of aides to undertake a comprehensive review of the federal government’s racial preference policies, the inquiry found that Americans held wide-ranging and conflicting views about what is meant by “affirmative action. ” Investigators concluded that this lack of coherence fostered an atmosphere of confusion about what these policies aimed to achieve and how they were implemented (Edley, 1996).

[...] Milner returned to London in November 1898 for consultations with Chamberlain. [...] Having observed the situation for the past eighteen months, he was now sure of his strategy. [...] Milner proposed that the British government should work up a crisis, giving them a legitimate pretext to intervene, a pretext that would place Britain in the right and the Transvaal in the wrong in the <b>court</b> <b>of</b> <b>public</b> <b>opinion.</b> [...] Chamberlain re-iterated his instruction to Milner that the British government could not be seen to be coercing Kruger; any intervention must be as a result of the Transvaal putting itself in the wrong.

6000|$|In {{the early}} stages I am persuaded there was no malice. He talked but for the {{pleasure}} of airing himself. He was essentially glib, as becomes the young advocate, and essentially careless of the truth, which is the mark of the young ass; and so he talked at random. There was no particular bias, but that one which is indigenous and universal, to flatter himself and to please and interest the present friend. And by thus milling air out of his mouth, he had presently built up a presentation of Archie which was known and talked of in all corners of the county. Wherever there was a residential house and a walled garden, wherever there was a dwarfish castle and a park, wherever a quadruple cottage by the ruins of a peel-tower showed an old family going down, and wherever a handsome villa with a carriage approach and a shrubbery marked the coming up of a new one--probably on the wheels of machinery--Archie began to be regarded in the light of a dark, perhaps a vicious mystery, and the future developments of his career to be looked for with uneasiness and confidential whispering. He had done something disgraceful, my dear. What, was not precisely known, and that good kind young man, Mr. Innes, did his best to make light of it. But there it was. And Mr. Innes was very anxious about him now; he was really uneasy, my dear; he was positively wrecking his own prospects because he dared not leave him alone. How wholly we all lie at the mercy of a single prater, not needfully with any malign purpose!

This paper will first review the socio-historical context as it pertains to the criminalization of cannabis use in Canada.

After summarizing the diverse landscape of cannabis-control regimes in other Western countries, this paper will examine more closely the actual options that exist for cannabis decriminalization in Canada and their possible effects and implications.

The ensuing process of identifying the bones in question opened up what can now be seen as a third narrative in war crime investigations—not that of the document or the witness but rather the birth of a forensic approach to understanding war crimes and crimes against humanity. In the period coinciding with the discovery of Mengele’s skeleton, scientists began to appear in human rights cases as expert witnesses, called to interpret and speak on behalf of things—often bones and human remains. But the aesthetic, political, and ethical complications that emerge with the introduction of the thing in war crimes trials indicate that this innovation is not simply one in which the solid object provides a stable and fixed alternative to human uncertainties, ambiguities, and anxieties.
