40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the influence of light source, LED unit and halogen lamp (HL), on the effectiveness of Enforce dual-cured cement cured under a <b>ceramic</b> <b>disc.</b> Three exposure times (60, 80 and 120 s) were also evaluated. Two experimental groups, in which the polymerization of the dual-cured cement was performed through a <b>ceramic</b> <b>disc,</b> and two control groups, in which the polymerization of the dual-cured cement was performed directly without presence of <b>ceramic</b> <b>disc</b> were subdivided into three subgroups (three different exposure times), with five specimens each: G 1 A- HL 60 s; G 1 B- HL 80 s; G 1 C- HL 120 s; G 2 A- LED 60 s; G 2 B- LED 80 s; G 2 C- LED 120 s; and control groups: G 3 A- HL 60 s; G 3 B- HL 80 s; G 3 C- HL 120 s; G 4 A- LED 60 s; G 4 B- LED 80 s and G 4 C- LED 120 s. Cement was applied in a steel matrix (4 mm diameter, 1. 2 mm thickness). In the experimental groups, a <b>ceramic</b> <b>disc</b> was placed on top. The cement was light-cured through the ceramic by a HL and LED, however, the control groups were cured without the <b>ceramic</b> <b>disc.</b> The specimens were stored in a light-proof container at 37 ºC for 24 hours, then Vickers hardness was determined. A four-way ANOVA and Tukey test (p£ 0. 05) were performed. All specimens cured by LED for 60 s showed inferior values compared with the halogen groups. In general, light-curing by LED for 80 s and 120 s was comparable to halogen groups (60 s and 80 s) and their control groups. LED technology can be viable for light-curing through conventional ceramic indirect restorations, when curing time is increased in relation to HL curing time...|$|R

40|$|The {{effect of}} Y 2 O 3 {{concentration}} on the dielectric properties of <b>ceramic</b> <b>disc</b> capacitors and multilayer capacitors containing 50 dielectric layers with an approximate thickness of 3 µm were investigated. The relative permittivity and temperature coefficient of capacity of multilayer capacitors at {{low and high}} applied field suggest that two types of microstructures formed, depending on yttrium doping concentration. Yttrium concentrations of 1. 5 - 2. 0 mol% yielded identical relative permittivities over a wide temperature range. The permittivities at Y concentrations of 2. 6 - 3. 0 mol% were also identical, but somewhat higher. The relative permittivity of <b>ceramic</b> <b>disc</b> capacitors of similar composition, determined from hysteresis loop measurements as function of applied field, was compared with field-dependent permittivity measurements on multilayer capacitors. The results indicate that polarization measurements on CDCs are a good indicator for the relative permittivity values of MLCCs. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd...|$|R

50|$|The <b>ceramic</b> <b>discs</b> are {{available}} in two types, cast plate and membrane plate. The cast plate is a one piece ceramic plate with a homogeneous surface and a granulated core. The filter medium of the cast plate is the thick walls, separated by ceramic granules. These features form a rigid mechanical structure. The membrane plate type contains a thin membrane over a coarser core and a multi-layer porous structure made of aluminium oxide. The coarse part of the equipment provides mechanical strength to its structure while the intermediate layer acts as a membrane carrier. The outer layer membrane acts as a filtering layer. The filtration layer of the ceramic filter has uniform pores, which means that only a certain size of particles can be filtered by using vacuum ceramic filters.|$|E
