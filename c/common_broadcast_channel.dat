40|$|Abstract—Providing {{security}} and anonymity to users are critical in wireless ad hoc networks. In this paper, a secure anonymous routing scheme is proposed for clustered wireless ad hoc networks. In the proposed scheme, intra-cluster routing uses the <b>common</b> <b>broadcast</b> <b>channel</b> in wireless networks to provide anonymity, while inter-cluster routing uses {{a sequence of}} temporary public keys as the trapdoor information. Symmetric cipher is employed in most part of the proposed scheme to reduce computational complexity and maximize network effi-ciency. Public key is only used to distribute symmetric keys. Both privacy analysis (including sender anonymity, receiver anonymity and sender-receiver anonymity) and attack analysis show {{the effectiveness of the}} proposed scheme against a wide range of strong adversarial attacks.

Indeed, this capacity is not far from a theoretical upper bound.

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} Wiretap, {{an experimental}} routing algorithm which computes maximum-likelihood diversity routes for packet-radio stations sharing a <b>common</b> <b>broadcast</b> <b>channel,</b> {{but with some}} stations hidden from others.

The algorithm is presented {{as an example of}} maximum-likelihood routing and database management techniques useful for richly connected networks of mobile stations. Of particular interest are the mechanisms to compute, select, rank and cache a potentially large number of speculative routes when only limited computational resources are available.

40|$|Abstract — This paper {{examines}} the following wireless data access scenario: {{a number of}} clients are interested {{in a set of}} data items kept at the server. A client sends a query request to inform the server of its desired data item. The server replies in the <b>common</b> <b>broadcast</b> <b>channel.</b> We first define a utility function that considers client’s power consumption in transmit, receive and idle modes. Specifically, utility is expressed as the number of queries that can be completed given a fixed energy source. Based on the utility function, we formulate our power aware wireless data access scheme as a non-cooperative game, called the WDA game. From our theoretical analysis, we show that clients are not always necessary to send query requests to the server. Instead, each client determines the request probability without any explicit communication with one another. Furthermore, we design and evaluate the server and client algorithms for the WDA game. Simulation results confirm that our proposed scheme, comparing with a simple always-request one, increases the utility and lifetime of every client while reducing the number of requests sent, at the cost of a slightly larger average query delay...|$|E
40|$|WTRP (Wireless Token Ring Protocol) is {{a medium}} access control (MAC) {{protocol}} for wireless networks. The MAC protocol through which mobile stations can share a <b>common</b> <b>broadcast</b> <b>channel</b> is essential in wireless networks. In a IEEE 802. 11 network, the contention among stations is not homogeneous due {{to the existence of}} hidden terminals, partially connected network topology, and random access. Consequently, quality of service (QoS) is not provided. WTRP supports guaranteed QoS in terms of bounded latency and reserved bandwidth which are crucial real time constraints of the applications. WTRP is efficient {{in the sense that it}} reduces the number of retransmissions due to collisions. It is fair in the sense that each station use the channel for equal amount of time. The stations take turn to transmit and are forced to give up the right to transmit after transmitting for a specified amount of time. It is a distributed protocol that supports many topologies since not all stations need to be connected to each other or to a central station. WTRP is robust against single node failure. WTRP recovers gracefully from multiple simultaneous faults. WTRP has applications to inter-access point coordination in ITS DSRC, safety-critical vehicle-to-vehicle networking, home networking and provides extensions to sensor networks and Mobile IP. ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—The Medium Access Control (MAC) {{protocol}} {{through which}} mobile stations can share a <b>common</b> <b>broadcast</b> <b>channel</b> {{is essential in}} an ad-hoc network. Due {{to the existence of}} hidden terminals and partiallyconnected network topology, contention among stations in an ad-hoc network is not homogeneous. Some stations are at a disadvantage in access to the shared channel and can suffer severe throughput degradation when load to channel is high. This is known as the “fairness problem”. Existing MAC protocols like IEEE 802. 11 Distributed Foundation Wireless Medium Access Control (DFWMAC) may exacerbate this problem as it uses the binary exponential backoff (BEB) algorithm in contention resolution, which always favors the last succeeding station. This paper reviews the “fairness index”, which is a metric to quantify fairness, and proposes a new estimation based backoff algorithm for the IEEE 802. 11 DFWMAC protocol. The new algorithm can support the case when packet lengths are variable, which is a typical scenario of IEEE 802. 11 compliant implementations that include both the basic CSMA/CA access method and the RTS/CTS access method. Simulation results show that the fairness problem can be very severe with the original BEB algorithm when packet length is variable and our new backoff algorithm can achieve far better fairness without adding much in complexity.

40|$|In ad-hoc {{wireless}} network, the nodes share a <b>common</b> <b>broadcast</b> radio <b>channel</b> {{and it may}} {{be possible}} that multiple nodes access the channel at the same time, resulting in collision. Thus a medium access control (MAC) protocol is needed which can efficiently distribute the use of the shared medium among the nodes. IEEE 802. 11 standard uses DCF (Distributed Coordinated Function) as the MAC scheme. The DCF scheme is based on carrier sense multiple access with collision avoidance (CSMA/CA), which is a random access scheme with carrier sense and collision avoidance through random backoff. It’s main limitation is that, the number of collisions increases with number of sta-tions. This affects other performance parameters such as decreased throughput. Thus after DCF many other MAC protocols have been pro-posed. These MAC schemes proved to result in less number of collisions but their other side is that they are taking variable number of time slots to resolve the contention. One MAC scheme known as CONTI considers both points that is resolving the contention with less number of collisions as well as in constant time. This paper uses the concept of CONTI and extends the scheme to work for multi-rate ad-hoc net-works...|$|R

40|$|A novel broadcast/multicast-capable carrier-reuse WDM-PON {{architecture}} is proposed. Utilizing the splitting capability {{of a power}} splitter and the cyclic property of an arrayed waveguide grating (AWG) at the remote node, the broadcast channel and a dedicated downlink unicast channel can be overlaid and subsequently transmitted to each optical network unit (ONU) simultaneously. Since each ONU can receive a <b>common</b> <b>broadcast</b> <b>channel</b> with electronically coded information, the multicast function can be implemented in a higher layer, similar to the current multicast-capable E-PON or G-PON using IP multicast addresses through a single wavelength channel. Thus, {{there is no need}} for reconfiguration of physical connections for multicast services. The proposed approach is different from the approach of overlaying DPSK multicast data onto NRZ unicast data using the same wavelength. As such, this approach does not require an expensive DPSK receiver at each ONU, and high receiver sensitivity can be achieved since there is no need to restrict the extinction ratio (ER) of the NRZ unicast data to a small value. Simulation studies show that this WDM-PON provides acceptable performance with one 10 Gb/s broadcast channel and thirty-two 10 Gb/s downlink unicast channels, and thirty-two 2. 5 Gb/s uplink unicast channels. Another advantage of this WDM-PON is that the broadcast channel only causes a small interference with the downlink/uplink unicast channels, and it is shared by all the ONUs. The effect of the optical carrier to subcarrier ratio on the bit error rate performance can be mitigated by increasing the extinction ratio of the delay interferometer used at the remote node...|$|E

We derive outer bounds for the rate-equivocation region using auxiliary random variables for single-letterization. Finally, we consider a Gaussian channel and show that both users can have positive secrecy rates, which is not possible for scalar Gaussian <b>broadcast</b> <b>channels</b> without cooperation.
