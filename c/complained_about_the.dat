5|$|The film The Adventures of Greyfriars Bobby, {{released}} in the UK in February 2006, cast a West Highland White Terrier as Bobby. The appearance of a Westie caused protests from the Skye Terrier breed club, which <b>complained</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> filmmaker's use of an incorrect dog breed for the part.|$|E
5|$|Tristano also <b>complained</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> {{commercialization of}} jazz {{and what he}} {{perceived}} to be the requirement to abandon the artistic part of playing in order to earn a living from performing. Later commentators have suggested that these complaints ignored the freedom that he was given by Atlantic and blamed others for what in many cases were the outcomes of his own career decisions.|$|E

5|$|After {{some members}} of the Virginia Tech panel <b>complained</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> missing paper, Virginia Tech decided to release a copy of the paper to the panel during {{the latter part of the}} week of August 25, 2007. Although the Virginia Tech panel has since {{received}} the paper written by Cho for the fiction writing class, the precise contents of that paper have not been released to the public.|$|E
5|$|Conversely, reviewers noted a lack {{of support}} for {{expandable}} storage, the initial absence of cellular connectivity, and the display's lower-than-expected contrast level, {{as well as an}} absence of a rear-facing camera. For the latter, an explanation from Asus claimed that the company decided to omit such a camera so as to not compromise the user experience and competitive pricing. Some consumers reported instances when the screen would not register inputs while the tablet performed data-intensive operations, while others <b>complained</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> build-quality of the screen.|$|E
5|$|Even after Suys' {{proposal}} was officially adopted, Anspach faced strong {{opposition to the}} project. This opposition came first from engineers who felt that the covering was incompatible with Brussels’s geology, would accumulate potentially dangerous gases {{and would not be}} able to handle enough water to prevent floods. Others opposed to the project <b>complained</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> high taxes resulting from its high cost, poor compensation for seized property and the lack of public input into the project. The press accused Anspach of being responsible for demolishing Brussels' old town, and published numerous caricatures mocking him.|$|E

5|$|For his part, Thompson said {{he thought}} the judge was trying to protect Moore's {{criminal}} conviction at any cost. He also <b>complained</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> judge's ethics, saying a local attorney who claimed to have influence on the judge had assured him the case would be dismissed unless the attorney was on Thompson's team, and also claimed that Rockstar Entertainment and Take Two Interactive posted slanderous comments about him on their website.|$|E
5|$|Horse rings, {{remnants}} {{of a time when}} horses and horse-drawn vehicles provided the primary mode of transportation, can be found throughout Portland, Oregon. They were removed from curbs and sidewalks for safety purposes until the late 1970s, when one Portland resident <b>complained</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> rings disappearing. Today, the city of Portland helps to preserve the rings by requiring them to be replaced following sidewalk construction or repair.|$|E
5|$|In 2010, West {{attracted}} {{media attention}} after he publicly <b>complained</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> {{slow pace of}} a game between the Red Sox and Yankees. He also worked the game that year in which Albert Pujols hit his 400th career home run. West has worked several no-hitters, including a 2012 perfect game by Félix Hernández. As of 2016, he has the longest tenure of any MLB umpire. West has appeared in six World Series, three All-Star Games, nine League Championship Series (LCS), eight League Division Series (LDS) and two Wild Card Games.|$|E

5|$|On 1 March 1937 {{he arrived}} at the No. 10 Elementary Training School and Reserve Flying Training Centre at RAF Yatesbury in Wiltshire. It was run by the British Aeroplane Company. He was {{assigned}} to B Flight. MacLachlan was uncomfortable with the military banter and the use of religious profanities. He also <b>complained</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> bills applicants were forced to pay. Mess bills were reportedly £ 2 10s per week and laundry 5s. Most of his salary was expended on these necessities.|$|E
5|$|On 10 September 2007, Licciardello rang a {{talkback}} {{radio station}} {{pretending to be}} someone else, and <b>complained</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> stunt, claiming that it was stupid and anyone involved at the ABC, including Kerry O'Brien, should be jailed for ten years. This stunt aired on the 12 September 2007 episode, and Licciardello said {{he wished he had}} made the call on the evening of the security breach because talkback radio discussion would not have already died down.|$|E
5|$|Reich {{lost his}} {{position}} at the New School in May 1941 after writing to its director, Alvin Johnson, to say he had saved several lives in secret experiments with the accumulator. Johnson was aware of Reich's claims that he could cure cancer, and told him the New School was not an appropriate institution for the work. Reich was also evicted from Kessel Street after his neighbours <b>complained</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> animal experiments. His supporters, including Walter Briehl, gave him $14,000 to buy a house, and he settled into 9906 69th Avenue.|$|E

5|$|Ricordi {{sent his}} agent in Paris, Emanuele Muzio, to {{negotiate}} with Sardou, who preferred that his play be adapted by a French composer. He <b>complained</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> reception La Tosca had received in Italy, particularly in Milan, and warned that other composers {{were interested in the}} piece. Nonetheless, Ricordi reached terms with Sardou and assigned the librettist Luigi Illica to write a scenario for an adaptation.|$|E
5|$|The employees, however, did {{not like}} living so close to their employers. They <b>complained</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> {{distance}} {{to the city and}} the transportation problems, and they criticised the rental rates and the reserves they had to make. After the deaths of Matthes and van Marken, however, the park gradually evolved into a desirable residential area. In 1931 the villa, Rust Roest, which had long been empty, was converted into a school. It was demolished in 1981. Since 1989, the park has been listed as Cultural heritage.|$|E
5|$|The {{net result}} was that little work was done on the Waterloo Medal. In 1832, the Master of the Mint, Lord Auckland, noted that the dies had been long delayed. In 1836, the new Master, Henry Labouchere, also <b>complained</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> delay, feeling the medal could be {{finished}} in 18 months. He offered Pistrucci extra payment if he would take on four apprentices and finish the Waterloo Medal. Pistrucci declined.|$|E

5|$|With {{regards to}} her diet, the three researchers' {{interviews}} revealed {{that in the}} care home she said she always had a sweet (dessert) with every meal. She <b>complained</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> blandness of the food in the care home and, given a choice, would wish to order fried and spicy foods. She occasionally ("more than once") feasted on chocolate in her old age: sometimes over a kilogramme (2.2lb) of chocolate per week.|$|E
5|$|Although {{partially}} blind from glaucoma {{by the age}} of 109 {{and completely}} blind from cataracts by 111, he nevertheless retained his memory and good health until his final days; his medical history showed no signs of high blood pressure, heart or kidney trouble or diabetes. He was able to walk without a cane or walker, preferring not to use one, and was able to feed himself, including Cheerios for breakfast, his favorite vanilla ice cream with his other meals and a daily can of Ensure for energy. While he enjoyed recounting tales from his military experience, he never <b>complained</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> segregated nature of his unit, preferring instead to focus on his own exploits on the job.|$|E
5|$|Cuthbert was the {{recipient}} of a long letter from Boniface who <b>complained</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> lax morals of the clergy in the British Isles, and too much drinking of alcohol by the Anglo-Saxon bishops. Cuthbert also sent letters to Lull who was Archbishop of Mainz and a native of England. During Cuthbert's time as archbishop he no longer claimed authority over all of Britain, like his predecessor Theodore. Pope Gregory III in 735 had sent a pallium to the bishop of York, raising the see of York {{to the status of}} an archbishopric. As a sign of the enhanced status of York, Cuthbert only consecrated bishops south of the Humber and his synods were attended only by bishops from the south of England.|$|E
