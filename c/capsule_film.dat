40|$|Stable, {{homogeneous}} ultrathin {{films of}} uniformly dimensioned dual-pore carbon capsules with mesoporous walls and macroscopic empty cores were fabricated using layer-by-layer methods based on electrostatic interaction between a polyelectrolyte and a surfactant coating {{of the carbon}} capsules. The resulting dual-porous carbon <b>capsule</b> <b>films</b> were investigated as a sensor substrate for vapors of different organic solvents. The carbon <b>capsule</b> <b>films</b> have much higher adsorption capacities than conventional electrolyte films and even than noncapsular mesoporous carbon films. The dual-pore carbon capsules have greater affinities for aromatic volatiles over their aliphatic counterparts, probably due to stronger π-π interactions. Additionally, the adsorption selectivity can be designed. Impregnation of additional recognition components into the carbon capsules permits further control over adsorption selectivity between aromatic and nonaromatic substances and between acids and bases in the prevailing atmosphere. Therefore, it is anticipated that the dual-pore carbon <b>capsule</b> <b>films</b> developed in this work will find application in sensing and separation applications because of their designable selectivity...|$|R

50|$|One of {{the first}} notable online film critics, D'Angelo created his site and began self-publishing short reviews in August 1995. In January 1997, Entertainment Weekly {{included}} The Man Who Viewed Too Much in an article about Internet film criticism, which was then in its infancy. The magazine subsequently hired him to write <b>capsule</b> <b>film</b> reviews for its video section. After contributing to Entertainment Weekly for three years, he became the chief film critic for Time Out New York (2000-2004) before moving to Esquire, where he served as the chief film critic. His writing has also appeared in Variety, The Village Voice, the Salt Lake City Weekly and the Nashville Scene. He has been cited as the 22nd best film critic of all time.|$|E
5000|$|In 1986, the Tribune {{announced}} that celebrated film critic Gene Siskel, the Tribunes best-known writer, {{was no longer}} the paper's film critic, and that his position with the paper had shifted from being that of a full-time film critic to that of a free-lance contract writer who was to write about the film industry for the Sunday paper and also provide <b>capsule</b> <b>film</b> reviews for the paper's entertainment sections. The demotion occurred after Siskel and longtime Chicago film critic colleague Roger Ebert decided to shift the production of their weekly movie-review show—then known as At the Movies with Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert and later known as Siskel & Ebert & The Movies—from Tribune Entertainment to The Walt Disney Company's Buena Vista Television unit. [...] "He has done a great job for us," [...] editor James Squires said at the time. [...] "It's a question of how much a person can do physically. We think you need to be a newspaper person first, and Gene Siskel has always tried to do that. But there comes a point when a career is so big that you can't do that." [...] Siskel {{declined to comment on the}} new arrangement, but Ebert publicly criticized Siskel's Tribune bosses for punishing Siskel for taking their television program to a company other than Tribune Entertainment. Siskel remained in that free-lance position until his death in 1999. He was replaced as film critic in 1986 by Dave Kehr.|$|E
40|$|AbstractCapsule {{retention}} {{is a rare}} complication, {{occurring in}} only 2 % of the patients referred to capsule endoscopy for obscure gastrointestinal bleeding and suspected Crohn's disease. 1, 2 The management of capsule retention depends on its dignity and on being symptomatic or not. The therapeutic options are removal by (device-assisted) enteroscopy, medication (e. g., steroids with suspected Crohn's disease), and surgery. The <b>capsule</b> <b>film,</b> which in most cases pictures the stenosis and its localization, can help in therapeutic decision making. In benign diseases like Crohn's disease or non-steriodal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) -enteropathy, not performing surgery is often recommended. In these cases the application of medication and/or performing peroral or peranal (device-assisted) enteroscopy, both for diagnostic/therapeutic reasons {{and the removal of}} the capsule, are adequate resources.

50|$|Following launch, FTV-2203 {{was in a}} low Earth orbit with an apogee of 650 km, a perigee of 230 km, and 89.6 {{degrees of}} inclination. Within {{a few days of}} launch, it was {{commanded}} to deorbit in order to return its <b>film</b> <b>capsule.</b> This was conducted, however due to the additional altitude provided by the anomaly during launch, it was unable to fully deorbit. The burn lowered its orbit, and it reentered the atmosphere on 31 December 1961. The <b>film</b> <b>capsule,</b> which had separated following the attempted deorbit burn, decayed on 9 January 1962. The satellite had a mass of 2580 kg, and measured 10.21 m in length, with a diameter of 1.52 m.|$|R

50|$|FTV-1132, {{also known}} as the Corona 9042A, was an American area survey optical {{reconnaissance}} satellite which was launched in 1962. It was a KH-5 Argon satellite, based on an Agena-B. The satellite operated successfully, however its <b>film</b> <b>capsule</b> was lost during recovery due to a parachute failure.|$|R
50|$|Samos 2 was an American {{reconnaissance}} satellite launched in 1961 {{as part of}} the Samos program. It was an early electro-optical reconnaissance spacecraft, meaning that it transmitted images to receiving stations on Earth rather than returning them in a <b>film</b> <b>capsule.</b> Samos 2 was a Samos-E1 spacecraft, based on an Agena-A.|$|R
50|$|Launched at 10:59 UTC on November 13, 1986 using a Soyuz-U rocket {{flying from}} the Baikonur Cosmodrome, Kosmos 1792 was {{operated}} in low Earth orbit {{until it was}} recovered on January 5, 1987. In addition to the main spacecraft, two separable <b>film</b> <b>capsules</b> were also returned during the satellite's mission. The satellite had a mass of approximately 7000 kg.|$|R
5000|$|Four CH-37Bs were {{deployed}} to Vietnam in 1963 {{to assist in}} the recovery of downed U.S. aircraft. They were very successful at this role, recovering over US$7.5 million worth of equipment, some of which was retrieved from behind enemy lines. The CH-37 was also used to recover spy satellite <b>film</b> <b>capsules</b> descending from space by parachute.|$|R
50|$|The S-550 capsule is a sphere-cone type lifting {{ballistic}} space capsule, {{similar to}} the shape of the <b>film</b> <b>capsule</b> reentry modules in the Corona spy satellite, but much larger. The general shape was also used by COTS competitor T/Space's CXV capsule. The capsule design shape had a spherical nose section diameter of 0.8 of the base diameter and 10 degree conical half-angle (see Atmospheric reentry).|$|R
50|$|During this period, {{the rival}} CORONA program, which saw its first launch in February 1959, began operation. Samos {{emerged as a}} more {{advanced}} satellite with additional capabilities that due to its larger mass would be launched on the Atlas-Agena booster instead of the Thor-Agena. While CORONA took photographs and returned them to Earth in a <b>film</b> <b>capsule,</b> Samos would instead electronically scan its film and beam images down by radio link.|$|R
50|$|After Samos 3, it {{was decided}} to abandon the Program 101/101A {{satellites}} entirely and switch to a more conventional <b>film</b> recovery <b>capsule,</b> since the one successful mission had not proven the viability of the electro-optical camera system. While the 101/101A satellites separated from the Agena in orbit, the 101B would remain attached and would use it for orbital maneuvers and also deorbiting the <b>film</b> <b>capsule</b> {{at the end of the}} mission.|$|R
50|$|The FGB {{was entered}} from the VA {{spacecraft}} via a short tunnel. At the aft end a pilot station {{was equipped with}} controls and windows for manual docking with the Almaz space station. The docking port was also located here. Operational TKS spacecraft would have delivered KSI <b>film</b> return <b>capsules</b> to Almaz stations. These would have been stored around the docking port for transfer to the <b>film</b> <b>capsule</b> airlock for loading.|$|R

30|$|In various {{fields of}} science such as {{anti-static}} coating for plastics, sensors, light emitting diode, fuel cells, polymer <b>capsules,</b> etc., multilayer <b>films</b> containing nanoparticle have been extensively studied for their potential use, {{but only a}} few studies have been concluded for textile materials [4 – 12]. Generally, polyelectrolyte self-assemblies of different textile fibers and structures were studied and these studies investigated only the possibility of using LbL method for textile materials [13 – 18].|$|R
50|$|Kobalt-M {{satellites}} are {{a type of}} Yantar satellite, Yantar-4K2M. They {{have the}} GRAU index 11F695M. They are optical reconnaissance satellites which use film. The satellite sends two <b>film</b> <b>capsules</b> to earth and returns to earth itself {{at the end of}} its mission. This has the disadvantage that the satellite's life is dependent on how much film it can carry, and information from the satellite is not obtained until the film canister has returned to earth and been developed.|$|R
50|$|Samos 4 was an American {{reconnaissance}} satellite which {{was lost in}} a launch failure in 1961. It was a film-return reconnaissance spacecraft, meaning that it returned images in a <b>film</b> <b>capsule</b> {{at the end of}} its mission. It was operated as part of the Samos programme. Samos 4 was the first of three Samos-E5 spacecraft to be launched; Samos-E5 satellites were based on an Agena-B, and carried a camera with a focal length of 1.67 m, and a resolution of 1.5 m.|$|R
50|$|Additional {{characters}} were added, such as Soviet defector Boris Vaslov, Marine Captain Leslie Anders, 1st Lt Russell Walker, and a United States Marine Corps platoon trained for Arctic warfare. Much of the characterization involving the submarine's crew {{found in the}} novel was jettisoned in favor of these new cinematic creations. Unlike the film, the novel describes little overt Soviet interest in recovering the <b>film</b> <b>capsule</b> other than a spy ship disguised as a fishing trawler waiting outside Holy Loch when the Tigerfish sets sail.|$|R
50|$|Samos 3 was an American {{reconnaissance}} satellite which {{was lost in}} a launch failure in 1961. It was an early electro-optical reconnaissance spacecraft, meaning that it transmitted images to receiving stations on Earth rather than returning them in a <b>film</b> <b>capsule,</b> and {{was to have been}} operated as part of the Samos programme. Samos 3 was the only Samos-E2 spacecraft to be launched. Samos-E2 satellites were based on an Agena-B, and carried a camera with a focal length of 91 cm, and a resolution of 6 m.|$|R
