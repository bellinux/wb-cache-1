50|$|The {{most common}} {{variation}} for home cooks is regional {{to the southern}} United States and incorporates crushed cookies, corn syrup, <b>chopped</b> <b>pecans,</b> and bourbon into a mixture that is formed into balls and coated in powdered sugar to prevent the evaporation of the alcohol. Once molded they are aged {{for up to a}} week, in a sealed container in a cool dark place, before serving. They will stay edible for up to a month before becoming too frail to pick up in one piece as the evaporation process desiccates the packed structure of the cookie.|$|E
5000|$|The name aranygaluska (monkey bread) {{literally}} means [...] "golden dumpling" [...] {{and by the}} 1880s, this dessert {{was being}} referred to in Hungarian literature. Hungarian immigrants subsequently brought this dish {{with them when they}} immigrated to America and began introducing it into the country's food landscape when Hungarian and Hungarian Jewish bakeries began selling it in the mid-twentieth century. In 1972, a cookbook published by Betty Crocker included a recipe for aranygaluska, which they referred to as [...] "Hungarian Coffee Cake". As it became more popular in America, aranygaluska came to be confused with monkey bread in which the balls of dough are not dipped in cinnamon and sugar but only in butter. Monkey bread soon became the more common name for this Hungarian Jewish dessert and therefore what most people know as monkey bread today is actually aranygaluska. Recipes for the bread first appeared in American women's magazines and community cookbooks in the 1950s, but the dish is still virtually unknown outside the United States. The bread is made with pieces of sweet yeast dough (often frozen), which are baked in a cake pan at high heat after first being individually covered in melted butter, cinnamon, sugar, and <b>chopped</b> <b>pecans.</b> [...] It is traditionally served hot so that the baked segments can be easily torn away with the fingers and eaten by hand.|$|E
