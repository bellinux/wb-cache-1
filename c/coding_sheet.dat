They analyzed a film using an analytic method called context analysis. Context analysis is the method of transcribing observed behaviors on to a <b>coding</b> <b>sheet.</b> This method was later used in studying the sequence and structure of human greetings, social behaviors at parties, and the function of posture during interpersonal interaction. Birdwhistell pioneered the original study of nonverbal communication, which he called kinesics. He estimated that humans can make and recognize around 250,000 facial expressions.|$|E

40|$|Code {{voting is}} a {{technique}} used to address the secure platform problem of remote voting. A code voting system consists in secretly sending, e. g. by mail, <b>code</b> <b>sheets</b> to voters that map their choices to entry codes in their ballot. While voting, the voter uses the <b>code</b> <b>sheet</b> to know what code to enter in order {{to vote for a}} particular candidate. In effect, the voter does the vote encryption and, since no malicious software on the PC has access to the <b>code</b> <b>sheet</b> it is not able to change the voter’s intention. However, without compromising the voter’s privacy, the vote codes are not enough to prove that the vote is recorded and counted as cast by the election server. We present a voter verifiable code voting solution which, without revealing the voter’s vote, allows the voter to verify, {{at the end of the}} election, that her vote was cast and counted as intended by just performing the match of a few small strings. Moreover, w. r. t. a general code voting system, our solution comes with only a minor change in the voting interaction...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine how {{accurately}} autism was depicted in the media (specifically in television) when compared to the scientifically accepted definition. Data for this study was gathered using coding sheets that outlined the definitive and secondary characteristics of autism. While watching six episodes of the television show The Big Bang Theory and six episodes of the television show Parenthood, examiners evaluated scenes involving the character with autism using a separate <b>coding</b> <b>sheet</b> for each designated scene. Examiners used the continuous coding method, identifying each instance of particular trait observed throughout the scene. Fifteen different traits were analyzed. Traits were recorded on a <b>coding</b> <b>sheet.</b> Results were analyzed qualitatively then compared to scientific definitions of autism to assess the validity of each show. Characteristics of autism were present in both the adult with autism in The Big Bang Theory and the child with autism in Parenthood. Both shows focused primarily on the DSM-IV features to represent the character with autism. Secondary characteristics were also exhibited, but were not as prominent.

40|$|Code voting {{seeks to}} address the issues of privacy and {{integrity}} for Remote Internet Voting. It sidesteps many of the inherent vulnerabilities of the Internet and client platforms {{but it does not}} provide end-to-end verification that votes are counted as cast. In this paper, we propose a simple technique to enhance the verifiability of code voting by ensuring that the Vote Server can only access the acknowledgement codes if the vote code is correctly registered by a threshold set of Trustees. The mechanism proposed here therefore adds an extra level of verifiability in registering and counting the vote. Voter-verification is simple and direct: the voters need only check that the acknowledgement code returned to them agrees with the value on their <b>code</b> <b>sheet.</b> To ensure receipt-freeness we propose the use of a single acknowledgement <b>code</b> per <b>code</b> <b>sheet,</b> rather than individual acknowledgement codes for each candidate with usual code voting...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} are to: (1) profile the production of Health Policy and Systems Research (HPSR) published between 2000 and 2008 in 12 countries in the Eastern Mediterranean Region (EMR) : Bahrain, Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, Libya, Morocco, Oman, Palestine, Sudan, Syria, Tunisia, and Yemen; (2) identify gaps; and (3) assess the extent to which existing HPSR produced in the region addresses regional priorities pertaining to Health Financing, Human Resources for Health and the Role of the Non-State Sector. This is the first stocktaking paper of HPSR production and gaps in the EMR. Methods Articles indexed on Medline between years 2000 and 2008 for the 12 study countries were selected. A MeSH term based search was conducted using country names. Articles were assessed using a <b>coding</b> <b>sheet</b> adapted for the region which included themes on: Governance Arrangements, Financial Arrangements, Delivery Arrangements, and Implementation Strategies. Identified articles were matched against regional research priorities to assess the extent to which research production aligns with priorities. Results A total of 1, 487 articles (11. 94 %) fit the criteria in the <b>coding</b> <b>sheet.</b> Results showed an increase in HPSR production which peaked after 2005. Most identified articles focused on Delivery Arrangements (68. 1 %), and Implementation Strategies (24. 4 %). Most HPSR addressed priorities in Human Resources for Health (39 %), and some articles focused on Health Financing (12 %) and Role of the Non-State Sector (6. 1 %). Conclusions Despite global calls for producing and translating HPSR into policy, there are still significant gaps in the EMR. More efforts are needed to produce HPSR and align production and translation with the demand for evidence by policymakers. Findings can help inform and direct future plans and activities for the Evidence Informed Policy Network- EMR, World Health Organization- EMR, and the Middle East and North Africa Health Policy Forum, in addition to being useful for countries that host or are planning to host KT platforms in the region. </p...|$|E
