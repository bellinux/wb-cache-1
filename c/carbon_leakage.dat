5|$|One way of {{addressing}} <b>carbon</b> <b>leakage</b> {{is to give}} sectors vulnerable to international competition free emission permits (Carbon Trust, 2009). This acts as a subsidy for the sector in question. Free allocation of permits was opposed by the Garnaut Climate Change Review as it considered there were no circumstances that justify it and that governments could deal with market failure or claims for compensation more transparently with the revenue from full auctioning of permits. The economically efficient option would, however, be border adjustments (Neuhoff, 2009; Newbery, 2009). Border adjustments work by setting a tariff on imported goods from less regulated countries. A problem with border adjustments is {{that they might be}} used as a disguise for trade protectionism. Some types of border adjustment may also not prevent emissions leakage.|$|E
500|$|A {{domestic}} ETS {{can only}} regulate the emissions {{of the country}} having the trading scheme. In this case, GHG emissions can [...] "leak" [...] (<b>carbon</b> <b>leakage)</b> to another region or sector with less regulation (p.21). Leakages may be positive, where they reduce the effectiveness of domestic emission abatement efforts. Leakages may also be negative, and increase the effectiveness of domestic abatement efforts (negative leakages are sometimes called spillover) (IPCC, 2007). For example, a carbon tax applied only to developed countries {{might lead to a}} positive leakage to developing countries (Goldemberg et al., 1996, pp.27–28). However, a negative leakage might also occur due to technological developments driven by domestic regulation of GHGs. This can help to reduce emissions even in less regulated regions.|$|E

40|$|The {{effectiveness}} of unilateral action to curb carbon emissions has beendismissed because of possible “carbon leakages”, this {{referring to the}} rise of emissions in non-participating countries. This paper offers a general equilibrium (GE) exploration of the key mechanisms and factors underlying the size of <b>carbon</b> <b>leakages.</b> We developed a two-region, two-goods simplified GE framework, incorporating threetypes of fossil fuels (coal, oil and low-carbon energy), international trade and capital mobility. The model was designed to make tractable extensive multidimensional sensitivityanalysis. The results suggest that the coal supply elasticity plays a critical role, while substitution elasticities between traded goods and international capital mobility appear relatively less influential. The shape of the production function also matters forthe size of the leakages. Confirming the results obtained with large computable GE models, {{for a wide range of}} parameters’ values, <b>carbon</b> <b>leakages</b> appear to be small. Therefore, the argument that unilateral carbon abatement action taken by a large groupof countries (such as the Annex 1 group) is flawed by significant <b>carbon</b> <b>leakages</b> isnot supported by our sensitivity analysis. The likelihood of small leakages favours in fact the formation of a worldwide coalition to stabilise climate change...|$|R
40|$|We {{study the}} {{interactions}} between fuel efficiency improvements in the transport sector and the oil market, where the efficiency improvements are policy-induced in certain regions of the world. We are especially interested in feedback mechanisms of fuel efficiency such as the rebound effect, <b>carbon</b> <b>leakages</b> and the 2 ̆ 01 cgreen paradox 2 ̆ 01 d, but also the distributional effects via oil price changes for different regions, sectors and oil producers. An intertemporal numerical model of the international oil market is introduced, where OPEC-Core producers have market power. We find that the rebound effect has a noticeable effect on the transport sector, but also on other sectors through lower oil prices in the regions that introduce the policy. There is a small green paradox effect {{in the sense that}} oil consumption increases initially when the fuel efficiency measures are gradually implemented. Finally, there will be significant <b>carbon</b> <b>leakages</b> if the policy is not implemented in all regions, with leakage rates of 35 per cent or higher. Non-OPEC producers will suffer more than OPEC producers by fuel efficiency policies due to high production costs...|$|R

In Section 4, we estimate the carbon footprints and <b>carbon</b> <b>leakages</b> for all prefectures in 2005 and analyze the results.

The perspective of {{a failure of the}} Copenhagen COP 15 to reach a global deal for the Post 2012 period, jointly with unilateral efforts proclaimed by the EU to reach the 20 - 20 - 20 objective unconditionally, have reinforced the momentum over a border adjustment or compensation mechanism throughout the ultimate months of negotiation of the EU Climate and Energy package. Even though the original BTA was discarded while less aggressive forms preferred - such as free quota allocation and, albeit less clearly, offsetting import mechanisms - the final C&E package adopted during the Dec 08 EU Summit was clearly sealed {{from the perspective of a}} significant cost premium imposed by the carbon price on a wide spectrum of energy consuming industries ( [...] .) ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the impact}} of international carbon control measures – {{and the absence of}} such measures – on Australian carbon pricing policies at both a theoretical and empirical level. While theory and interest group advocacy suggest a potential case for destination accounting of carbon emissions and border tax adjustments and/or export exemptions, this case is sometimes exaggerated. For example, in the ferrous metals sector, empirical analysis suggests that gains from such refinements are low since <b>carbon</b> <b>leakages</b> and adverse competitiveness effects are small. In other sectors – such as non-ferrous metals – the effects are more pronounced. Exaggerating the competitiveness costs of carbon pricing runs the risk of policy overreaction and unintended protectionism, dramatically increasing the costs of Australian carbon pricing policies. Providing free and tradable emission quotas to exporters and import competing sectors is a ‘second best’ policy but one with practicality in sectors where adverse competitiveness effects do need to be addressed...|$|R
40|$|There is {{widespread}} recognition that forestry carbon credits {{can reduce the}} net emissions of carbon into the atmosphere. Designing systems to sequester carbon, however, has proven difficult due {{to a number of}} efficiency issues, including leakage. Leakage occurs when policy makers develop carbon projects in specific places which protect some parcels of land, but leave other parcels of land unprotected. This analysis uses a newly developed model of global land use change from an established forestry and land use model, described in Sohngen et al. (1999); Sohngen and Mendelsohn (2003); and Kindermann et al. (2008). To assess <b>leakage</b> we estimate <b>carbon</b> under storage under one scenario where the world is awarded carbon credits and another where tropical developing nations are awarded the credits. We focus our results on several regions, namely Brazil, the rest of South America, Sub-Saharan Africa and Southeast Asia. Carbon prices are assumed to be constant, and range from US$ 0 tC to US$ 900 tC. The model adjusts global land uses to these specific policies, and leakage is assessed by comparing carbon gains within the project areas to net global changes in carbon. A number of policy relevant results emerge. First, the estimates indicate that leakage ranges from 2 % to more than 14 %. Second, as <b>carbon</b> credits increase, <b>leakage</b> decreases across the world. <b>Carbon</b> Sequestration, <b>Leakage,</b> <b>Carbon</b> Credits, Environmental Economics and Policy, Land Economics/Use,...|$|R
40|$|Carbon {{capture and}} {{geological}} storage represents a potential means of managing atmospheric carbon dioxide levels. Understanding {{the role of}} faults, as either barriers or conduits to the flow of carbon dioxide, is crucial for predicting the long-term integrity of geological storage sites. Of particular concern is the influence of geochemical reactions on the sealing behaviour of faults {{and the impact of}} seismicity and stress regime on fault stability. Here, we examine a 135, 000 -year palaeorecord of <b>carbon</b> dioxide <b>leakage</b> from a faulted, natural carbon dioxide reservoir in Utah. We assess the isotope and trace-element composition of U-Th-dated carbonate veins, deposited by carbon-dioxide-rich fluids. Temporal changes in vein geochemistry reveal pulses of carbon dioxide injection into the reservoir from deeper formations. Surface leakage rates increase by several orders of magnitude following these pulses. We show that each pulse occurs around 100 - 2, 000 years after the onset of significant local climatic warming, at glacial to interglacial transitions. We suggest that <b>carbon</b> dioxide <b>leakage</b> rates increase as a result of fracture opening, potentially caused by changes in groundwater hydrology, the intermittent presence of a buoyant gas cap and postglacial crustal unloading of regions surrounding the fault...|$|R

40|$|Presented in {{this study}} is an {{empirical}} analysis of embodied carbon dioxide emissions induced by fossil fuel combustion for the world divided into three supra-national coalitions, i. e., G 7, BRIC, {{and the rest of the}} world (ROW), via the application of a multi-region input-output modeling for 2004. Embodied emission intensities for the three coalitions are calculated and compared, with market exchange rate and purchase power parity separately used to investigate the difference between nominal and real production efficiencies. Emissions embodied in different economic activities such as production, consumption, import, and export are calculated and analyzed accordingly, and remarkable carbon trade imbalances associated with G 7 (surplus of 1. 53 billion tons, or 36 % its traded emissions) and BRIC (deficit of 1. 37 billion tons, or 51 % its traded emissions) and approximate balance with ROW (deficit of 0. 16 billion tons, or 3 % its traded emissions) are concretely revealed. <b>Carbon</b> <b>leakages</b> associated with industry transfer and international trades are illustrated in terms of impacts on global climate policies. The last but not least, per capita consumption based emissions for G 7, BRIC, and ROW are determined as 12. 95, 1. 53, and 2. 22 tons, respectively, and flexible abatement policies as well as equity on per capita entitlement are discussed.
