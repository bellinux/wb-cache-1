5|$|Linezolid is {{effective}} against all clinically important Gram-positive bacteria—those whose cell wall contains {{a thick layer}} of peptidoglycan and no outer membrane—notably Enterococcus faecium and Enterococcus faecalis (including vancomycin-resistant enterococci), Staphylococcus aureus (including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, MRSA), Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, the viridans group streptococci, Listeria monocytogenes, and Corynebacterium species (the latter being among the most susceptible to linezolid, with minimum inhibitory concentrations routinely below 0.5mg/L). Linezolid is also highly active in vitro against several mycobacteria. It appears to be very effective against Nocardia, but because of high cost and potentially serious adverse effects, authors have recommended that it be combined with other antibiotics or reserved for <b>cases</b> <b>that</b> <b>have</b> failed traditional treatment.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the course}} of its history the Oregon Supreme Court has made a number {{decisions}} as the highest court in Oregon. These cases cover {{a wide range of}} topics from the constitutionality of various ballot measures to contract law to torts and even to the location of the capital when Oregon was still a territory. Although small in comparison to the total number of cases the court has decided, some cases have been appealed to the United States Supreme Court. Below are some of the <b>cases</b> <b>that</b> <b>have</b> had scholarly discussion, some of which were later decided by the U.S. Supreme Court.|$|E
5|$|In Hawaiian mythology, {{the peaks}} of the island of Hawaii are sacred. An ancient law allowed only {{high-ranking}} aliʻi to visit its peak. Ancient Hawaiians living {{on the slopes of}} Mauna Kea relied on its extensive forests for food, and quarried the dense volcano-glacial basalts on its flanks for tool production. When Europeans arrived in the late 18th century, settlers introduced cattle, sheep and game animals, many of which became feral and began to damage the mountain's ecological balance. Mauna Kea can be ecologically divided into three sections: an alpine climate at its summit, a Sophora chrysophylla–Myoporum sandwicense (or māmane–naio) forest on its flanks, and an Acacia koa–Metrosideros polymorpha (or koa–ōhia) forest, now mostly cleared by the former sugar industry, at its base. In recent years, concern over the vulnerability of the native species has led to court <b>cases</b> <b>that</b> <b>have</b> forced the Hawai'i Department of Land and Natural Resources to eradicate all feral species on the mountain.|$|E

The County Court's jurisdiction on civil cases is limited to those involving less than $25,000.|$|E
25|$|The second method {{improves}} on {{the first}} by having investigators examine student or patient records looking for probable cases, to catch <b>cases</b> <b>that</b> <b>have</b> not been identified yet. The third method, which is arguably the best, screens a large sample of an entire community to identify possible cases, and then evaluates each possible case in more detail with standard diagnostic procedures. This last method typically produces the most reliable, and the highest, prevalence estimates.|$|E
25|$|A scale {{also allows}} bullets and cases to be sorted by weight, which can {{increase}} consistency further. Sorting bullets by weight has obvious benefits, as {{each set of}} matched bullets will perform more consistently. Sorting cases by weight is done to group cases by case wall thickness, and match cases with similar interior volumes. Military cases, for example, tend to be thicker, while <b>cases</b> <b>that</b> <b>have</b> been reloaded numerous times will have thinner walls due to brass flowing forward under firing, and excess case length being later trimmed from the case mouth.|$|E

25|$|However, {{notwithstanding}} the grant of original jurisdiction, the Court has, through the years, assigned to lower courts {{such as the}} Court of Appeals the power to hear petitions for certiorari, prohibition, mandamus, quo warranto and habeas corpus. As a result, the Court has considerable discretion to refuse to hear these petitions filed directly before {{it on the ground}} that such should have been filed instead with the Court of Appeals or the appropriate lower court. Nonetheless, <b>cases</b> <b>that</b> <b>have</b> attracted wide public interest or for which a speedy resolution is of the essence have been accepted for decision by the Supreme Court without hesitation.|$|E
25|$|The mass {{disappearance}} of the 43 students marked arguably the biggest political and public security crisis Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto had yet faced in his administration (2012–2018). The incident drew worldwide attention and led to protests across Mexico, and international condemnation. The resulting outrage triggered near-constant protests, particularly in Guerrero and Mexico City. Many of them were peaceful marches headed by the missing students' parents, who come from poor families in rural Mexico. Other demonstrations turned violent, with protesters attacking government buildings. Unlike other high-profile <b>cases</b> <b>that</b> <b>have</b> occurred during the Mexican Drug War (2006–present), this case resonated particularly strongly because it highlighted the level of collusion organized crime had reached with local governments and police agencies.|$|E
500|$|The Court {{has heard}} several <b>cases</b> <b>that</b> <b>have</b> {{had a major}} impact on Indiana as well as others that have set {{nationwide}} precedents. The first of these cases, Lasselle v. State (1820), where the Court overturned a circuit court decision that tested slave ownership in the new state by stating [...] "the framers of our constitution intended a total and entire prohibition of slavery," [...] and resulted in all slaves in Indiana being freed. In the Fall Creek Massacre case (1823), State v. Hudson, the Court upheld a lower court's finding that crimes committed against Native Americans were punishable under American laws. This decision lead to the first execution of a white man for crimes against natives. In the Falkenburg v. Jones case (1889), Indiana became the first state to establish the right for a defendant to obtain court records free of charge. The 1909 case of Woessner v. Bullick established that the Court could invalidate a governor's veto if proper veto procedures were not followed, in effect ruling the pocket-veto as unconstitutional. In 1917 the state {{was among the first to}} adopt an Exclusionary rule, established in the case of Callendar v. State, which prevented illegally obtained evidence from be submitted in court. In William v. Smith, a case heard in 1921, the Court overturned Indiana's eugenics laws, the first of their kind in the nation.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Radiotherapy (RT) has various effects such as {{apoptosis}} stimulation, mitosis inhibition, mutagenic effect, {{chromosomal aberration}} and neoplastic transformation. Aim: The {{aim of this}} study was to investigate the effect of RT administered to diffuse glial tumors on the proliferation activity and mitotic activity of the tumor. Material-Method: An overall of 49 re-operated recurrent cases (16 cases had received postoperative RT while 33 cases did not receive RT) diagnosed as glial tumor were included in this study. The tumor cohort consisted of diffuse astrocytoma, oligodendroglioma and oligoastrocytomas. Ki- 67 proliferating index, mitoses and grades of the primary and recurrent tumors were compared. Result: We found that the grades of recurrent tumors were lower than the grade during the first surgery in <b>cases</b> <b>that</b> <b>had</b> RT compared to those <b>that</b> <b>had</b> not. Similarly, Ki- 67 was lower in <b>cases</b> <b>that</b> <b>had</b> received RT. We also noted suppressed mitotic activity in <b>cases</b> <b>that</b> <b>had</b> received RT...|$|R
50|$|With so many {{possible}} symptoms, hysteria was often considered a catchall diagnosis where any unidentifiable ailment could be assigned. As diagnostic techniques improved, {{the number of}} ambiguous <b>cases</b> <b>that</b> might <b>have</b> been attributed to hysteria declined. For instance, before the introduction of electroencephalography, epilepsy was frequently confused with hysteria. Many <b>cases</b> <b>that</b> <b>had</b> previously been labeled hysteria were reclassified by Sigmund Freud as anxiety neuroses.|$|R
