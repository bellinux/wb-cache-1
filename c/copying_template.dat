5000|$|The more {{controversial}} competing mechanism is an RNA/RT-based mechanism (reverse transcriptase model of SHM) which attempts {{to explain the}} production of the full spectrum of strand-biased mutations at A:T and G:C base pairs whereby mutations of A are observed to exceed mutations of T (A>>>T) and mutations of G are observed to exceed mutations of C (G>>>C). This involves error-prone cDNA synthesis via an RNA-dependent DNA polymerase copying the base modified Ig pre-mRNA template and integrating the now error-filled cDNA copy back into the normal chromosomal site. The errors in the Ig pre-mRNA are a combination of adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) RNA editing and RNA polymerase II transcription elongation complex copying uracil and abasic sites (arising as AID-mediated lesions) into the nascent pre-mRNA using the transcribed (TS) DNA as the <b>copying</b> <b>template</b> strand. The modern form of this mechanism thus critically depends on AID C-to-U DNA lesions and long tract error-prone cDNA synthesis of the transcribed strand by DNA polymerase-eta acting as a reverse transcriptase.|$|E
40|$|Previous {{analyses}} of rearranged immunoglobulin (Ig) variable genes (VDJs) {{concluded that the}} mechanism of Ig somatic hypermutation (SHM) involves the Ig pre-mRNA acting as a <b>copying</b> <b>template</b> resulting in characteristic strand-biased somatic mutation patterns at A:T and G:C base pairs. We have since analysed cancer genome data and found the same mutation strand-biases, in toto or in part, in nonlymphoid cancers. Here we have analysed somatic mutations in a single well characterised gene TP 53. Our goal is to understand {{the genesis of the}} strand-biased mutation patterns in TP 53 - and in genome-wide data - that may arise by "endogenous" mechanisms as opposed to adduct-generated DNA-targeted strand-biased mutations caused by well characterised "external" carcinogenic influences in cigarette smoke, UV-light and certain dietary components. The underlying strand-biased mutation signatures in TP 53, for many nonlymphoid cancers, bear a striking resemblance to the Ig SHM pattern. A similar pattern can be found in genome-wide somatic mutations in cancer genomes that have also mutated TP 53. The analysis implies a role for base-modified RNA template intermediates coupled to reverse transcription in the genesis of many cancers. Thus Ig SHM may be inappropriately activated in many non-lymphoid tissues via hormonal and/or inflammation-related processes leading to cancer...|$|E

40|$|Alternative {{lengthening}} of telomeres (ALT) is a telomere length maintenance mechanism {{based on}} recombination, where telomeres use other telomeric DNA as {{a template for}} DNA synthesis. About 10 % of all human tumors depend on ALT for their continued growth, and understanding its molecular details is critically important {{for the development of}} cancer treatments that target this mechanism. We have previously shown that telomeres of ALT-positive human cells can become lengthened via inter-telomeric copying, i. e. by copying the telomere of another chromosome. The possibility that such telomeres could elongate by using other sources of telomeric DNA as <b>copy</b> <b>templates</b> has not been investigated previously. In this study, we have determined whether a telomere can become lengthened by copying its own sequences, without the need for using another telomere as a <b>copy</b> <b>template.</b> To test this, we transduced an ALT cell line with a telomere-targeting construct and obtained clones with a single tagged telomere. We showed that the telomere tag can be amplified without the involvement of other telomeres, indicating that telomere elongation can also occur by intra-telomeric DNA copying. This is the first direct evidence that the ALT mechanism involves more than one method of telomere elongation...|$|R

30|$|In {{light of}} the above problems, I {{suggest that it is}} {{worthwhile}} to revisit the much earlier model of chemical (i.e., non-enzymatic) RNA replication. Orgel, along with many of his students and colleagues, worked on this problem for many years and made considerable progress by demonstrating the partial copying of short RNA templates in the presence of suitably activated nucleotide substrates. In one of the most impressive examples of such chemistry, a full length complement of a 14 -mer all GC template was generated in the presence of activated G and C monomers, albeit in low yield (< 2 %) [14]. Despite such achievements, the efficient and accurate <b>copying</b> of arbitrary <b>template</b> sequences has remained frustratingly out of reach. The problems {{standing in the way of}} robust RNA <b>template</b> <b>copying</b> have been reviewed in detail [15]. Furthermore, as a result of the historical focus on <b>template</b> <b>copying</b> chemistry, the additional issues related to continuing cycles of replication such as strand separation and strand reannealing have seldom been considered. In addition, <b>template</b> <b>copying</b> experiments have been, with few exceptions [9], performed in solution, so that problems related to the compatibility of RNA replication and protocell membranes have also been neglected. Here I will review recent conceptual and experimental advances that point the way to a possible experimental realization of multiple cycles of chemically driven (i.e., non-enzymatic) RNA replication in a manner that could be integrated into a protocell model. I will also discuss the implications of chemical RNA replication for the emergence of the RNA World from the prebiotic chemistry of the early earth.|$|R

For RNA substrates, the rates of hydrolysis and cyclization are comparable to the rates of template-directed polymerization. Since the <b>copying</b> of a <b>template</b> by primer-extension with monomer substrates involves many sequential reaction steps, it is common in such experiments to use a large excess of monomers over template, to ensure that, even in late stages of the reaction, there is at least some activated monomer left. Unfortunately, hydrolyzed monomers act as competitive inhibitors of the copying reaction, since they can bind to the template but cannot be incorporated into a growing chain [49].|$|R

The task is non-trivial, in part due to the need {{to take into account the}} stochastic nature of peak area values. Various methods have been proposed suggesting ways in which this may be done. One recent suggestion is a probabilistic expert system model that uses gamma distributions to model the size and stochastic variation in peak area values. In this paper we carry out a statistical analysis of the gamma distribution assumption, testing the assumption against synthetic peak area values computer generated using an independent model that simulates the PCR amplification process. Our analysis shows the gamma assumption works very well when allelic dropout is not present, but performs less and less well as dropout becomes more and more of an issue, such as occurs, for example, in Low <b>Copy</b> <b>Template</b> amplifications...|$|R

40|$|DNA {{polymerase}} {{activity is}} essential for replication, recombination, repair, and mutagenesis. All DNA polymerases studied so far from any biological source synthesize DNA by the Watson-Crick base-pairing rule, incorporating A, G, C, and T opposite the templates T, C, G, and A, respectively. Non-Watson-Crick base pairs would lead to mutations. In this report, we describe the ninth human DNA polymerase, Polι, encoded by the RAD 30 B gene. We show that human Polι violates the Watson-Crick base-pairing rule opposite template T. During base selection, human Polι preferred T-G base pairing, leading to G incorporation opposite template T. The resulting T-G base pair was less efficiently extended by human Polι compared to the Watson-Crick base pairs. Consequently, DNA synthesis frequently aborted opposite template T, a property we designated the T stop. This T stop restricted human Polι to a very short stretch of DNA synthesis. Furthermore, kinetic analyses show that human Polι <b>copies</b> <b>template</b> C with extraordinarily low fidelity, misincorporating T, A, and C with unprecedented frequencies of 1 / 9, 1 / 10, and 1 / 11, respectively. Human Polι incorporated one nucleotide opposite a template abasic site more efficiently than opposite a template T, suggesting a role for human Polι in DNA lesion bypass. The unique features of preferential G incorporation opposite template T and T stop suggest that DNA Polι may additionally play a specialized function in human biology...|$|R

Scan trueness and precision was investigated by scanning a denture six times and comparing five scans to the sixth. Then the scans of the six CT, CNT and 3 D dentures were compared by aligning, in turn, the copies of each denture to the scanned original. Outcome measures were the mean surface-to-surface distance, standard deviation of that distance and the maximum distance. Student’s unpaired t-tests with Bonferroni correction were used to analyse the results. Results. The repeated scans of the original denture showed a scan trueness of 0. 013 mm (SD 0. 002) and precision of 0. 013 mm (SD 0. 002).
