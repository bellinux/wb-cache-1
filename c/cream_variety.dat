5000|$|Grape-Nut {{ice cream}} {{is a popular}} {{regional}} dish in the Canadian Maritimes, the Shenandoah Valley, Jamaica and New England. One origin story {{is that it was}} created by chef Hannah Young at The Palms restaurant in Wolfville, Nova Scotia, in 1919. She created it when she ran out of fresh fruit to add to ice cream, and decided to throw in some cereal. It proved popular at the restaurant and the Scotsburn Dairy company began mass-producing the ice <b>cream</b> <b>variety,</b> and it sold across the region. [...] Variations of ice cream with Grape Nuts are also called brown bread ice cream.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to {{evaluate}} the extent of free radical scavenging properties and antioxidant effects of crude extracts of sprouted Cicer arietinum (Chick pea/Chana/Bengal gram) seeds. Two main varieties of Cicer arietinum seeds viz. Kabuli-chana (cream seed-coat) and Bengal gram (brown seed-coat) were examined and compared for their free radical scavenging properties and antioxidant effects. A crude methanol extract of the sprouted seeds were prepared. Free radical scavenging properties were evaluated against stable 2, 2 -diphenyl- 1 -picrylhydrazyl radical (DPPH) and hydrogen peroxide radical and the extent of antioxidant effect was assessed by lipid peroxidation induced by ferrous sulphate on the lipid present in the liver homogenate. The results showed that the two Cicer arietinum extracts differed in their capacities to quench or inhibit DPPH, hydrogen peroxide and lipid peroxide. Brown colored Cicer arietinum sprouts showed the greatest activity against DPPH radicals, hydrogen peroxide radicals and lipid peroxide compared to the <b>cream</b> <b>variety.</b> This study is clearly indicating that brown colored Cicer arietinum is effective in scavenging free radicals and has the potential to be a powerful antioxidant...|$|E

40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this research}} were to profile the sensory attributes of ice cream enriched with different contents of wheat fiber gel „Vitacel“ and acacia gum „Fibregum“ and to assess acceptability of ice cream. Some ice <b>cream</b> <b>varieties</b> were manufactured {{with the addition of}} dietary fibres under laboratory conditions and were subjected to sensory descriptive analysis. Eight panel members developed a score sheet of 14 sensory attributes. Additionally, a hedonic scale was used for evaluating the acceptability of the ice cream. 0. 8 and 1. 2 % of „Vitacel“ did not significantly affect the sensory attributes of the ice cream, including texture and overall acceptability. 1 % and 1. 5 % „Fibregum“ did not significantly affect the sensory attributes and overall acceptability and texture acceptability of ice cream, except hardness and coldness. The dependency of the hardness of the ice cream measured instrumentally and evaluated by sensory panel was determined...|$|R

50|$|On March 14, 2015, an {{outbreak}} of listeriosis in Kansas was linked to certain Blue Bell Ice Cream products (Blue Bell Chocolate Chip Country Cookies, Great Divide Bars, Sour Pop Green Apple Bars, Cotton Candy Bars, Scoops, Vanilla Stick Slices, Almond Bars, and No Sugar Added Moo Bars). Blue Bell, the nation's third most popular ice cream brand, says its regular Moo Bars were untainted, as were its ice <b>cream</b> <b>varieties</b> in three-gallon, half-gallon, quart, pint and single-serving containers and its take-home frozen snack novelties. It was the first outbreak of a foodborne illness in the company's history. The items came from the company's production facility located in Broken Arrow, Oklahoma, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), in Washington, D.C. The Atlanta-based U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), also {{a branch of the}} U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), stated that all five of the sickened individuals, including the three who have died (60% mortality rate) were receiving treatment at the same Kansas hospital before developing the listeriosis, suggesting their infections with the Listeria bacteria were nosocomial (acquired, while eating the products, in the hospital). That might also help to explain the higher mortality rate in these cases (60%, versus the more normal 20%-30%): the people, who were all older (three of the five were women) were already hospitalized.|$|R

40|$|A {{listeriosis}} {{outbreak in}} the United States implicated contaminated ice cream produced by one company, which operated 3 facilities. We performed {{single nucleotide polymorphism}} (SNP) -based whole genome sequencing (WGS) analysis on Listeria monocytogenes from food, environmental and clinical sources, identifying two clusters and a single branch, belonging to PCR serogroup IIb and genetic lineage I. WGS Cluster I, representing one outbreak strain, contained 82 food and environmental isolates from Facility I and 4 clinical isolates. These isolates differed by up to 29 SNPs, exhibited 9 pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) profiles and multilocus sequence typing (MLST) sequence type (ST) 5 of clonal complex 5 (CC 5). WGS Cluster II contained 51 food and environmental isolates from Facility II, 4 food isolates from Facility I and 5 clinical isolates. Among them the isolates from Facility II and clinical isolates formed a clade and represented another outbreak strain. Isolates in this clade differed by up to 29 SNPs, exhibited 3 PFGE profiles and ST 5. The only isolate collected from Facility III belonged to singleton ST 489, which was in a single branch separate from Clusters I and II, and {{was not associated with}} the outbreak. WGS analyses clustered together outbreak-associated isolates exhibiting multiple PFGE profiles, while differentiating them from epidemiologically unrelated isolates that exhibited outbreak PFGE profiles. The complete genome of a Cluster I isolate allowed the identification and analyses of putative prophages, revealing that Cluster I isolates differed by the gain or loss of three putative prophages, causing the banding pattern differences among all 3 AscI-PFGE profiles observed in Cluster I isolates. WGS data suggested that certain ice <b>cream</b> <b>varieties</b> and/or production lines might have contamination sources unique to them. The SNP-based analysis was able to distinguish CC 5 as a group from non-CC 5 isolates and differentiate among CC 5 isolates from different outbreaks/incidents...|$|R
50|$|Nestlé {{went on to}} {{introduce}} a Peanut Butter flavor of Frosty Paws ice cream cups in 2005, based on research carried out by its Purina PetCare Company division into dogs' preferred tastes.

50|$|Originally, the Wähe was a food eaten during fasting in the Catholic {{parts of}} Switzerland, {{particularly}} in the East. On the other hand, it was a festive dish in the Protestant areas, above all in the West. In some regions (Freiburg and Waadtland) the Wähe was usually eaten on Friday, when meat was not allowed. Even today, many bakeries offer the Wähe only on Friday because of this tradition. In the mountain regions, the Wähe has been known only since the early 20th century, probably because there ovens were very rare. In the alpine regions, given the prevailing livestock and milk production were prepared mainly Wähe with cheese and <b>cream.</b> The <b>variety</b> with fruit {{was the most common}} in the fruit-growing areas of the rural regions.

5000|$|A Butterbrot is {{commonly}} a single {{slice of bread}} and one [...] "ingredient" [...] {{on top of the}} butter or margarine. For breakfast, this ingredient tends to be sweet and can be marmalade, jam, honey, chocolate spread, hazelnut spread, or the less common peanut butter. For dinner (in Germany, during the working week people in general eat only one cooked meal per day, which is either lunch or dinner) or as boxed lunch, and often also for breakfast, the Butterbrot is eaten with something savoury on top, usually a large slice of cold meat or cheese or sliced German Wurst, or one of the countless <b>cream</b> cheese <b>varieties,</b> or even an entire Schnitzel or halved mince meat patty, or hard boiled egg slices or egg salad, or other spreadable creamy salads, or smoked salmon, or various savoury spreads like liverwurst, including also a wide range of vegetarian spreads available everywhere, because of the strong health food and organic food movement since already over 100 years (see Reformhaus). Boxed lunch Butterbrot can be folded for easier handling, and as such remotely resembles the sandwich. In Austria Butterbrot only refers to a slice of bread with butter. If a topping is added it is named after the topping (e.g. Käsebrot [...] "cheese bread", Wurstbrot [...] "sausage bread").|$|R
