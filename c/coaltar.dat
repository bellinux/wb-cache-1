60|$|Thrift is {{the really}} romantic thing; economy is more romantic than extravagance. Heaven knows I for one speak disinterestedly in the matter; for I cannot clearly {{remember}} saving a half-penny ever since I was born. But {{the thing is}} true; economy, properly understood, is the more poetic. Thrift is poetic because it is creative; waste is unpoetic because it is waste. It is prosaic to throw money away, because it is prosaic to throw anything away; it is negative; it is a confession of indifference, that is, it is a confession of failure. The most prosaic thing about the house is the dustbin, and the one great objection to the new fastidious and aesthetic homestead is simply that in such a moral menage the dustbin must be bigger than the house. If a man could undertake {{to make use of}} all things in his dustbin he would be a broader genius than Shakespeare. When science began to use by-products; when science found that colors could be made out of <b>coaltar,</b> she made her greatest and perhaps her only claim on the real respect of the human soul. Now the aim of the good woman is to use the by-products, or, in other words, to rummage in the dustbin.|$|E

40|$|Globally, an {{estimated}} 2 million deaths occur every {{year as a}} result of tuberculosis. Ghana records over 46, 000 new cases annually despite numerous efforts to curb the disease. One major challenge associated with the control of the disease is patients’ noncompliance with medication. Despite the noncompliance setback, not much information is available on the issue. This paper, therefore, examines patients’ compliance with medication at the Suhum Kraboa <b>Coaltar</b> District in Ghana. A cross-sectional descriptive study was carried out using interview schedules. Data were primarily retrieved from 40 treatment supporters, in addition to 110 previously treated persons registered in 2010 and 2011 with cases of pulmonary tuberculosis. Evidence from the study indicates that 63 percent of the previously treated persons complied with medication which is below the expected national target of at least 85 percent. However, those with treatment supporters significantly complied with medication. Depression, substance abuse, financial problems, and long duration of treatment were other issues that discouraged patients’ adherence to medication. Some patients also attributed supernatural explanations to the source of the disease which negatively affected compliance. Conclusively, future approaches aimed at controlling/eradicating tuberculosis in the district should consider counselling, economic empowerment packages, and detailed education for patients...|$|E
40|$|Preparations of coal-tar and juniper tar (cade oil) {{that are}} used in the {{treatment}} of psoriasis are known to contain numerous potentially carcinogenic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH). Evidence of covalent binding to DNA by components of these mixtures was sought in a) human skin biopsy samples from 12 psoriasis patients receiving therapy with these agents, b) human skin explants maintained in organ culture and treated topically with the tars, and c) the skin and lungs of mice treated with repeated doses of the formulations following the regimen used in the clinic. DNA was isolated from the human and mouse tissues and digested enzymically to mononucleotides. 32 P-Post-labeling analysis revealed the presence of aromatic DNA adducts in the biopsy samples at levels of up to 0. 4 fmol total adducts/μg DNA. Treatment of human skin in organ culture produced similar levels of adducts, while treatment with dithranol, a non-mutagenic therapeutic agent, resulted in chromatograms indistinguishable from those from untreated controls. In mouse skin, <b>coaltar</b> ointment and juniper tar gave similar DNA adduct levels, with a similar time-course of removal: maximum levels (0. 5 fmol/μg DNA) at 24 h after the final treatment declined rapidly to 0. 05 fmol/μg at 7 d, thereafter declining slowly over the succeeding 25 d. However, while coal-tar ointment produced only very low levels of adducts in mouse lung (< 0. 03 fmol/μg DNA), juniper tar produced adducts at a high level (0. 7 fmol/μg DNA) that were persistent in this tissue. These results provide direct evidence for the formation of potentially carcinogenic DNA damage in human and mouse tissue by components of these therapeutic tar preparations...|$|E
40|$|Tesis {{doctoral}} presentada en el Departamento de Ingeniería Química y Tencnología del Medio Ambiente de la Universidad de Oviedo. 2011. Directores: Ramón Álvarez García y Mª Antonia Díez Díaz-EstébanezThe {{environmental impact}} due to waste production, {{both domestic and}} industrial, has become a maximum priority of environmental policies in developed countries. Even though waste management has undergone a significant evolution in the last decades, the waste recovery continues being of great importance to achieve sustainable development and compatible with the environmental protection; so it has been necessary to allocate time and resources to develop processes to ensure that plastic recycling is an economically profitable process, and in this way, it helps to decrease the amount of residues designated to landfill disposal. As a result of recent European legislation for management and recovery of plastic wastes from packaging, is being promoted {{the development of new}} processes of mechanical and chemical recycling and energy recovery, in order to achieve the recycling objectives. Other type of wastes which gives good reasons for special attention are used oils, so common in our daily lives, and used in the operation of industrial machinery, automotive vehicles or transmission hydraulic systems, to mention some of the most significant examples. The loss of their properties after the continued use is unfortunately accompanied by the generation of residual oils, therefore, it is necessary to establish measures to minimize as much as possible the production of these hazardous wastes and promote that the generated wastes are managed by the alternatives which ensure environmental protection and health of people. The development of new recycling ways to allow the recovery of both types of residues is very important in order to keep as many options open, especially when an existing industrial process can be used and it is not necessary any operational variation made by the industry. In this sense, integrated steel plants can be considered as an option for those wastes with technical limitations for conventional recycling. The combination of the blast furnace route and coke plant in the steel industry, provide a way to expand feedstock recycling with economic, social and environmental benefits. In the present work we have studied the viability of this action via, the cocarbonization of the wastes with coal for the production of coke, which feeds the blast furnace to produce iron which subsequently will be transformed into steel. To achieve this general objective, the specific objectives focus on the study of the influence on the coking properties of an individual coal and three coal blends used by the industry for blast-furnace coke production, of the six more common thermoplastics in the domestic wastes (LOPE, HOPE, PP, PS, PET and PVC), and six mixtures of them, covering a wide range of compositions. Also, nine lube-oils were used. Oils have paraffin nature except one of them which is a synthetic oil containing organic esters. Two oils mixtures were prepared based on their thermal behaviour and as reference materials a coal-tar and a <b>coaltar</b> pitch were used. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|This study {{employed}} a case-study approach and cross-case analysis {{to investigate the}} impact of Environmental Information Systems (EIS) and Local Knowledge Systems (LKS) on agro-forestry management and biodiversity conservation. Questionnaire-based interviews with service providers, resource managers and focus group discussions with farmers associated with the United Nations Capacity 21, the Netherlands Tropenbos International (TBI) and the United Nations Project on People Land Management and Conservation (UNPLEC), projects yielded in-depth information on agro-forestry practices in southern Ghana. The findings of the survey revealed that computer-based information systems {{have been used to}} identify areas of resource degradation. This has served as a sanitization tool to organize and intensify tree-planting exercises and agroforestry management activities in the affected areas. Evaluation of individual cases and cross-case analysis of EIS projects in Ghana showed parallels and divergences in the modus operandi of EIS implementation at national and district levels. The Capacity 21 project initiated the District Environmental Resource Information System (DERIS). The project procured datasets (eg. satellite images, software, computers and printers) in 8 pilot districts including Sekyere West and Assin Fosu Districts and offered training and skill development programmes {{under the auspices of the}} Centre for Environmental Remote Sensing and Geographic Information Services (CERSGIS) to equip focal district planning officers to use tools and datasets to analyze the state of the environment and the extent of resource degradation as well as other development-related activities. This fostered cooperation between the national coordinator of the project, district planners and local farmers to organize regular tree-planting exercises and workshops on alternative livelihood activities which have helped to lessen pressure on the environment to some extent. This approach exhibits a greater degree of top-down planning and implementation. The field survey revealed that PLEC used computer-based information systems during the earlier stages of the project to demarcate demonstration sites and capture spatio-temporal variations in agro-ecological conditions. However, during the subsequent phases, the PLEC project relied heavily and predominantly on local agro-ecological knowledge from a diverse group of farmers to assess resource conditions, and promoted the use of various traditional and exotic agro-forestry and agro-diversity management techniques in the Manya Krobo and Suhum Kraboa <b>Coaltar</b> Districts. The PLEC approach was more bottom-up in its philosophy and practice by allowing natural and social scientists to learn from farmers, and the scientists in turn offered technical advice which enabled farmers to improve their local farming techniques and maximize their farm productivity, while at the same time enhancing the capacity of the biophysical environment to support conventional and alternative livelihood activities continually. The Tropenbos International (TBI) project exhibits elements of both top-down and bottom-up implementation approaches. It recognizes the significant role of tailor-made information (computer-based systems and socio-economic studies mainly from the Forest Services Commission and the University of Ghana, respectively) and skill in forest management. The TBI GORTMAN project streamlined the capacity for information collection in the Goaso and Offinso districts. The findings revealed that farmers associated with the three projects apply various knowledge systems and techniques in agroforestry management. These include, mixed cultivation of domestic, economic and medicinal trees as well as food crops. Reasons such as windbreak, construction materials, medicine, food, fuelwood and nutrient enhancement were cited by farmers for practicing agroforestry. Common food crops found on farms include cocoyam, okro, maize, plantain and yams, among others. These crops are the mainstay of family food and income sources. Other livelihood activities include beekeeping, snail rearing and grasscutter raising and livestock breeding. The diversities of agroforestry practices have engendered decades of farm management practices and resource conservation measures. Another challenge of agroforestry management which is common to all the three projects is that farmers are victims of indiscriminate felling of trees on their farms by timber companies which destroys their crops. Farmers repeatedly cited logistical (tools, seedlings etc) challenges and financial constraints as factors that hamper effective application of knowledge systems in agroforestry management. This is a dominant problem that PLEC and TBI farmers face. Capacity 21 farmers benefited initially from logistical supplies but it was short-lived. In view of these problems, the study recommended measures for improving environmental information systems and local knowledge systems applications in agroforestry management and agrodiversity conservation in southern Ghana...|$|E
