30|$|Originally {{introduced}} by H. A. Pohl in 1951, dielectrophoretic (DEP) force {{has been used}} as a striking tool for biological particle manipulation (or separation) for the last few decades. In particular, dielectrophoresis activated <b>cell</b> <b>sorters</b> (DACSes) have been developed for applications in various biomedical fields. These applications include cell replacement therapy, drug screening and medical diagnostics. Since a DACS does not require a specific bio-marker, it is able to function as a biological particle sorting tool with numerous configurations for various cells [e.g. red blood cells (RBCs), white blood cells (WBCs), circulating tumor cells, leukemia cells, breast cancer cells, bacterial cells, yeast cells and sperm cells]. This article explores current DACS capabilities worldwide, and it also looks at recent developments intended to overcome particular limitations. First, the basic theories are reviewed. Then, representative DACSes based on DEP trapping, traveling wave DEP systems, DEP field-flow fractionation and DEP barriers are introduced, and the strong and weak points of each DACS are discussed. Finally, for the purposes of commercialization, prerequisites regarding throughput, efficiency and recovery rates are discussed in detail through comparisons with commercial <b>cell</b> <b>sorters</b> (e.g. fluorescent activated and magnetic activated <b>cell</b> <b>sorters).</b>|$|R

We investigated several different light scattering and fluorescence measurements in several different cell lines, sorting cell fractions from the high and low end of distributions, and measuring volume electronically to determine which sorting strategy yielded the best separated volume distributions.

30|$|Since dielectrophoresis {{was first}} {{reported}} by H. A. Pohl in 1951, {{it has been}} employed as a biological particle manipulating tool in various fields (e.g. cell replacement therapy, drug screening, medical diagnostics, particle filtration and microfluidics) [1 – 10]. Dielectrophoretic (DEP) phenomena occur when micro/nano-particles in a medium are exposed to a non-uniform electric field, causing polarization for particular particles according to their dielectric property [11, 12]. DEP force is classified into two types according to correlations of the dielectric properties of the particles and medium. Positive DEP (p-DEP) force pulls particles toward a higher electric gradient, and negative DEP (n-DEP) force repels particles away from the higher electric gradient. Therefore, various target cells with different dielectric properties can be manipulated by controlling the medium properties or the input voltage condition. In order to manipulate biological particles, consequently, various dielectrophoresis-based techniques, including DEP trapping, DEP field-flow fractionation (DEP-FFF), traveling wave DEP (TwDEP) force and DEP barrier, are performed within a micro fluid channel [13 – 21]. DEP trapping techniques are mainly used to isolate particles within a still fluid utilizing p-DEP force [22 – 25]. The TwDEP force, DEP-FFF and DEP barrier techniques are realized via angled or vertical electrode pairs, and they are generally implemented with n-DEP force within the micro channel with fluidic flow [26 – 32]. The latter techniques have a striking advantage in terms of throughput since the continuous loading of target cells along the fluidic flow allows for continuous cell separation. Therefore, {{there have been many}} studies on the separation of various biological particles, including blood cells [red blood cells (RBCs) and white blood cells (WBCs)], cancer cells [circulating tumor cells (CTCs), leukemia cells and breast cancer cells], submicron particles (bacteria, yeast cells), spermatozoa, stem cells, protein and DNA. Dielectrophoresis activated <b>cell</b> <b>sorters</b> (DACSes) differ from conventional fluorescent activated <b>cell</b> <b>sorters</b> (FACSes) and magnetic activated <b>cell</b> <b>sorters</b> (MACSes) in that they do not require the additional financial and time expenditure necessary for immune-labeling [33 – 38]. In addition, DACSes achieve high separation efficiency owing to the continuous separation in the micro fluid channel. Nevertheless, there are still big hurdles to be overcome with respect to their low throughputs and recovery rates.|$|R

40|$|In {{this work}} we show {{the design and}} {{characterization}} of a microfluidic <b>cell</b> <b>sorter.</b> The device is designed to sort small quantities of live cells labeled with either live dyes or Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP). Manually operated, it reaches frequencies of 10 cells per minute. Sorting occurs through hydrodynamic switching, with low hydrodynamic shear stresses, preserving to a high degree the pre-sorted cell status. Also, the cells are not subjected to any electric or magnetic field. The chip is made from reusable hard plastic material (PMMA) into which microchannels are directly milled with a hydraulic diameter of 70 μm, and one inlet and two outlet reservoirs are drilled through the chip. A syringe pump provides a sheath flow that deflects the cells into either the waste reservoir or collection reservoir, depending {{on the state of}} two fast solenoid valves. The cells are maintained in an isotonic buffer throughout the sorting process. The Peclet number in the channel is large, preventing diffusion of cells to the walls for adhesion.
