25|$|Some {{studies suggest}} people with secure {{attachment}} styles have longer-lasting relationships. This may be {{partly due to}} commitment. People with secure attachment styles tend to express more <b>commitment</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> relationships. People with secure attachment styles {{also tend to be}} more satisfied with their relationships, which may encourage them to stay in their relationships longer. However, secure attachment styles are by no means a guarantee of long-lasting relationships.|$|E
25|$|The Book of Malachi {{was written}} {{to correct the}} lax {{religious}} and social behaviour of the Israelites – particularly the priests – in post-exilic Jerusalem. Although the prophets urged the people of Judah and Israel to see their exile as punishment for failing to uphold their covenant with Elohim, {{it was not long}} after they had been restored to the land and to Temple worship that the people's <b>commitment</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> God began, once again, to wane. It was in this context that the prophet commonly referred to as Malachi delivered his prophecy.|$|E

25|$|Expanding {{knowledge}} about the needs of zoo animals and <b>commitment</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> well being has changed {{the look of the}} National Zoo. Today, animals live in natural groupings rather than individually. Rare and endangered species, such as golden lion tamarins, Sumatran tigers, and sarus cranes, breed and raise their young – showing the success of the zoo's conservation and research programs. The zoo's research team studies animals both in the wild and at the zoo. Its research encompasses reproductive biology, conservation biology, biodiversity monitoring, veterinary medicine, nutrition, behavior, ecology, and bird migration.|$|E
25|$|A {{major feature}} of the tours is a 5- to 10-day mifgash (Hebrew for 'encounter') with Israeli peers, usually {{soldiers}} serving in the Israel Defense Forces, who join the tour. The stated purpose for the mifgash is for the participants and the soldiers {{to get to know}} each other and to better understand each other's world view and Jewish identity. Guided discussion sessions explore topics such as the Jewish tradition in the modern world, how Jewish life in Israel differs from Jewish life abroad, and how mandatory military service impacts young Israelis' perceptions of service and <b>commitment</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> country. More than 65,000 Israelis have participated in the program since 2000.|$|E
25|$|A small 2004 {{study by}} Ellen Paek empirically {{examined}} {{the extent to}} which religiosity, operationalized as religious orientation and religious behavior, is related to the controversial idea of emotional intelligence (EI). The study examined {{the extent to which}} religious orientation and behavior were related to self-reported EI in 148 church attending adult Christians. Non-religious individuals were not part of the study. The study found that the individuals' self-reported religious orientation was positively correlated with their perceiving themselves to have greater EI. While the number of religious group activities was positively associated with perceived EI, number of years of church attendance was unrelated. Significant positive correlations were also found between level of religious commitment and perceived EI. Thus, the Christian volunteers were more likely to consider themselves emotionally intelligent if they spent more time in group activities and had more <b>commitment</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> beliefs.|$|E

25|$|While Barbour {{evidenced}} {{no personal}} history of {{an interest in}} Jewish affairs prior to rejoining the Senate in 1940, the plight of victims of Nazi genocide stirred him deeply. In April 1943, {{along with many other}} Congressmen and Senators, Barbour may have attended a performance of We Will Never Die, a pageant written by Ben Hecht and produced by the Bergson Group to commemorate two million European Jews who had already been murdered. In the fall of 1943, he was one {{of a small group of}} senators and congressmen who, together with the vice president, met with 400 rabbis who marched with the Bergson Group in Washington in 1943, shortly before Yom Kippur, the Jewish Day of Atonement. It was hoped their march would encourage the United States government to take a formal stand against the Holocaust. While President Franklin D. Roosevelt did not meet with the rabbis, Senator Barbour, along with a handful of Congressional colleagues, met them on the steps of the United States Capitol and expressed his <b>commitment</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> cause.|$|E
25|$|In April 1944, Stilwell {{launched}} his final offensive {{to capture the}} Burmese city of Myitkyina. In support of this objective, the Marauders were ordered to undertake a long flanking maneuver towards the town, involving a grueling 65-mile jungle march. Having been deployed since February in combat operations in the jungles of Burma, the Marauders were seriously depleted and suffering from both combat losses and disease, and lost additional men while {{en route to the}} objective. A particularly devastating scourge was a severe outbreak of amoebic dysentery, which erupted shortly after the Marauders linked up with the Chinese Army in India, called X Force. By this time, the men of the Marauders had openly begun to suspect Stilwell's <b>commitment</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> welfare, and no effort to hide their displeasure with their hard-driving commander. Despite their sacrifices, Stilwell appeared unconcerned about their losses, and had rejected repeated requests for medals for individual acts of heroism. Initial promises of a rest and rotation were ignored; the Marauders were not even air-dropped replacement uniforms or mail until late April.|$|E
25|$|To reiterate, Creelman and Turner, {{with equal}} vigor {{and scope of}} investigation, depict very {{different}} regimes; respectively, one progressive and the other oppressive. In spite of their strong <b>commitment</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> reporting, both journalists rarely mention the científicos. Regardless, these first-hand accounts reveal two foreigners’ perceptions of how Indian policy {{was carried out in}} the whole of Mexico, even if they were unaware of {{the inner workings of the}} regime. On the one hand, Creelman stresses the necessity of the Porfiriato’s harshness with which Indians continued to be subjugated and socially marginalized, as was suggested by Limantour, Bulnes, and Cosmes. This treatment, to Creelman, was a justified measure so that Mexico could be modernized. Turner, on the other hand, sees no benefit to such dehumanizing treatment when nearly one half of Mexico’s population is not profiting from the economic progress, but rather, they are suffering from it, even more than they had suffered under previous governments. This, for Turner, was the opposite of modernization. Despite their opposing interpretations of Díaz ’s regime, Creelman and Turner ultimately expose any pretense of a fair and just government as perpetrated by the científicos and Díaz through positivist doctrine. It is this last point that serves as the link to Díaz’s own perceptions and actions—or lack thereof—towards Mexico’s Indians.|$|E
5000|$|Soon after {{recording}} the EP, the band added members, Michael Porter and Andy Hiller.

5000|$|The {{idea for}} the band was {{conceived}} by Shagrath and then of Dimmu Borgir, in 1999. This consisted of the two musicians jamming after Dimmu Borgir rehearsals. With Shagrath on guitars and Arnesen (or [...] "Lex Icon") on drums, they recorded some material, but could take it no further due <b>to</b> <b>their</b> <b>commitments</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> other bands.

500|$|In February 2010, on the House floor, Moran {{called for}} the repeal of Don't Ask, Don't Tell, the {{military}} policy of discharging soldiers on active duty who are openly homosexual.

The partner of the deceased soldier wrote the unit to say how much the victim had loved the military; how they were the only family he had ever known...

500|$|In 1998, the Clintons' {{relationship}} {{became the}} subject of much speculation when investigations revealed that the President had engaged in an extramarital affair with White House intern Monica Lewinsky. Events surrounding the Lewinsky scandal eventually led to the impeachment of the President by the House of Representatives and later acquittal by the Senate. When the allegations against her husband were first made public, Hillary Clinton stated that the allegations were part of a [...] "vast right-wing conspiracy", characterizing the Lewinsky charges as the latest in a long, organized, collaborative series of charges by Bill's political enemies rather than any wrongdoing by her husband. She later said that she had been misled by her husband's initial claims that no affair had taken place. After the evidence of President Clinton's encounters with Lewinsky became incontrovertible, she issued a public statement reaffirming her <b>commitment</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> marriage, but privately was reported to be furious at him and was unsure if she wanted to stay in the marriage. The White House residence staff noticed a pronounced level of tension between the couple during this period.|$|E
