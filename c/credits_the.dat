5|$|Although Leng <b>credits</b> <b>the</b> song's two {{acoustic}} guitar parts to Harrison alone, Spizer suggests that guitarist Peter Frampton may have supplied {{one of these}} parts. Playing the bass, as he did on most of All Things Must Pass, was Klaus Voormann, who would be another to find sanctuary at Friar Park. Harrison offered him refuge from the media in March and April 1971, when reports had Voormann linked to a supposed Beatles offshoot band, along with Harrison, Starr and John Lennon.|$|E
5|$|Despite all {{receiving}} equal billing in the <b>credits,</b> <b>the</b> original principal {{cast members}} were paid different salaries {{in the first}} few years; Baxendale and Nesbitt were the most well-known, so received more than Ripley, Thomson, Norris and Bathurst, who were comparatively less well-known to audiences. Prompted by the continued success of the show, Andy Harries reviewed the salaries in 2000 and decided to pay all six actors the same amount. The amount was not publicly disclosed but was believed to be £20,000 per episode, plus repeat broadcast royalties. Another pay deal for the fourth series in 2001 increased the salaries of the cast to £50,000. For the final series in 2003, they each received £75,000 an episode.|$|E
5|$|Father Dale Grubba, {{the priest}} who had presided over Kulwicki's funeral, {{released}} {{a biography of}} his friend entitled Alan Kulwicki: NASCAR champion Against All Odds in 2009.

The film chronicles Kulwicki's life from racing late models at Slinger Super Speedway, through his rise to NASCAR champion, and ends with his death. The movie was created by Kulwicki's Wisconsin fans for less than $100,000. The star of the film, Brad Weber, was a Kulwicki fan and <b>credits</b> <b>the</b> late driver with being his inspiration to become an actor.|$|E

50|$|Dastar {{might have}} been able to avoid this legal attack entirely if it had <b>credited</b> <b>the</b> {{original}} authors. However, as Scalia noted in the opinion, that would have put them in a bind: <b>crediting</b> <b>the</b> original authors might have implied their sponsorship or approval, which could have exposed Dastar to other lawsuits unless <b>the</b> <b>credit</b> had been carefully worded.|$|R
5|$|Few {{details are}} {{known about the}} {{production}} of the film, but it was shot on a beach resort and used a miniature train. Due the lack of credits, both Louise Fazenda and Henry Mann's roles were provided by Photoplay, in response to an reader inquiry. The film was the first release by the new Joker productions, which was dedicated to producing only short comedy films. Kalton C. Lahue and Samuel Gill credit this production as being Louise Fazenda's film debut. Film historian Richard E. Braff notes that Allen Curtis as the writer, but provides no directorial <b>credits.</b> <b>The</b> single reel production was released on October 25, 1913.|$|E

There are six alien races competing with Tetracorp for these resources. Beginning with one building and one million <b>credits,</b> <b>the</b> player is tasked with building up a successful mining operation to sell as much ore as possible to the Federation.

5|$|In his memoirs, Władysław Szpilman also {{compared}} {{himself to}} Crusoe and, like Fogelman, emphasized the isolation and hopelessness which characterized the Warsaw Crusoes. Szpilman's memoir {{served as a}} basis for a screenplay, written as early as 1945 by the Polish writers Jerzy Andrzejewski and Czesław Miłosz, entitled Robinson of Warsaw. The movie that was eventually filmed, Miasto Nieujarzmione ("Unyoked city"), was heavily censored by the communist authorities, and its original theme changed {{to such an extent that}} Miłosz requested his name be removed from the film's <b>credits.</b> <b>The</b> experience with the film contributed to Miłosz's disillusionment with cinema as an artistic medium.|$|E
5|$|In the <b>credits,</b> <b>the</b> re-imagined {{series is}} said {{to be based on the}} 1976 novel by Terry Nation; however, there are a number of {{differences}} between the series and its source material. In the novel, Jenny Richards survives, whereas her counterpart in the 2008 series, Jenny Collins, does not; this means that Greg Preston and Jenny cannot have a child as the years unfold. Abby Grant still falls in love with Jimmy Garland; however, in the book, he eventually dies from septicaemia.|$|E
5|$|Mike B. Anderson {{stated that}} at least three {{different}} acts of material were written and animated for Krusty's comeback stand-up appearance at Moe's Tavern.

The episode was still being animated three weeks before it was due to air and the production process moved frantically shortly before completion. The Canyonero sequence was originally planned to be displayed during the closing <b>credits.</b> <b>The</b> production team liked the scene so much that they did not want it to be obscured by the credits and gave it its own segment {{at the end of the}} episode.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Credits</b> - <b>The</b> opening <b>credits</b> show <b>the</b> five {{starring}} {{members of}} the show, but through that there are images of notable politicians and celebrities which are targeted in the titles. The titles are always the same except for two changeable titles, which targets persons in recent events. <b>The</b> closing <b>credits</b> simply read all {{the cast and crew}} of the show, though commonly a video is played over half <b>the</b> <b>credits,</b> which is explained in the Conclusion. <b>The</b> closing <b>credits</b> are a frequent (if bizarre) source of humour. For example, Andrew Hansen once sang a song during <b>the</b> <b>credits</b> about how <b>the</b> <b>credits</b> are always played over his song. Another time <b>the</b> <b>credits</b> were shown in Ukrainian. On one episode <b>the</b> <b>credits</b> of <b>the</b> show were replaced with <b>the</b> <b>credits</b> of <b>The</b> New Inventors.
