5|$|Lead {{affects the}} {{peripheral}} nervous system (especially motor nerves) and the <b>central</b> <b>nervous</b> system. Peripheral nervous system effects are more prominent in adults and <b>central</b> <b>nervous</b> system effects are more prominent in children. Lead causes the axons of nerve cells to degenerate and lose their myelin coats.|$|E
5|$|Other {{heavy metals}} noted for their {{potentially}} hazardous nature, usually as toxic environmental pollutants, include manganese (<b>central</b> <b>nervous</b> system damage); cobalt and nickel (carcinogens); copper, zinc, selenium and silver (endocrine disruption, congenital disorders, or general toxic effects in fish, plants, birds, or other aquatic organisms); tin, as organotin (<b>central</b> <b>nervous</b> system damage); antimony (a suspected carcinogen); and thallium (<b>central</b> <b>nervous</b> system damage).|$|E

5|$|Outcome {{is related}} to the extent and {{duration}} of lead exposure. Effects of lead on the physiology of the kidneys and blood are generally reversible; its effects on the <b>central</b> <b>nervous</b> system are not. While peripheral effects in adults often go away when lead exposure ceases, evidence suggests that most of lead's effects on a child's <b>central</b> <b>nervous</b> system are irreversible. Children with lead poisoning may thus have adverse health, cognitive, and behavioral effects that follow them into adulthood.|$|E

50|$|In {{binaural}} fusion, inputs {{from both}} ears integrate and fuse {{to create a}} complete auditory picture at the brainstem.

5|$|The main {{manifestations of}} carbon {{monoxide}} poisoning develop in the organ systems most dependent on oxygen use, the <b>central</b> <b>nervous</b> system and the heart. The initial symptoms of acute carbon monoxide poisoning include headache, nausea, malaise, and fatigue. These symptoms are often mistaken for a virus such as influenza or other illnesses such as food poisoning or gastroenteritis. Headache {{is the most common}} symptom of acute carbon monoxide poisoning; it is often described as dull, frontal, and continuous. Increasing exposure produces cardiac abnormalities including fast heart rate, low blood pressure, and cardiac arrhythmia; <b>central</b> <b>nervous</b> system symptoms include delirium, hallucinations, dizziness, unsteady gait, confusion, seizures, <b>central</b> <b>nervous</b> system depression, unconsciousness, respiratory arrest, and death. Less common symptoms of acute carbon monoxide poisoning include myocardial ischemia, atrial fibrillation, pneumonia, pulmonary edema, high blood sugar, lactic acidosis, muscle necrosis, acute kidney failure, skin lesions, and visual and auditory problems.|$|E
5|$|Amanita regalis is poisonous. A case of {{poisoning}} {{was reported}} from Finland, where three individuals {{believed they had}} consumed the edible parasol mushroom Macrolepiota procera. The symptoms of poisoning, which began 1–2hours after ingestion of the mushrooms, were gastrointestinal—nausea and heavy vomiting. Two had <b>central</b> <b>nervous</b> system manifestations and cholinergic symptoms, including hallucinations, confusion, or loss of consciousness as well as profuse salivation and sweating. All three individuals recovered within 4–24hours without any damage to liver, kidneys or the <b>central</b> <b>nervous</b> system. As this incident demonstrates, cooking the mushrooms does not completely neutralize the toxic components of Amanita regalis. Chemical analysis has shown that this species contains ibotenic acid and muscimol, the same toxic constituents as Amanita muscaria.|$|E
5|$|Bitterman et al. in 1986 and 1995 {{showed that}} {{darkness}} and caffeine would delay {{the onset of}} changes to brain electrical activity in rats. In the years since, research on <b>central</b> <b>nervous</b> system toxicity has centred on methods of prevention and safe extension of tolerance. Sensitivity to <b>central</b> <b>nervous</b> system oxygen toxicity {{has been shown to}} be affected by factors such as circadian rhythm, drugs, age, and gender. In 1988, Hamilton et al. wrote procedures for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to establish oxygen exposure limits for habitat operations. Even today, models for the prediction of pulmonary oxygen toxicity do not explain all the results of exposure to high partial pressures of oxygen.|$|E
50|$|Nikolay Burdenko {{was one of}} {{the first}} to {{introduce}} surgery of the <b>central</b> and peripheral <b>nervous</b> system into clinical practice; he investigated the reason for appearance and the methods of treating shock, made a large contribution to the study of the processes, which appear in the <b>central</b> and peripheral <b>nervous</b> system in connection with the surgical operation in the case of sharp injuries; he developed the bulbotomy - operation on the upper division of the spinal cord. Burdenko created the school of surgeons with a sharply pronounced experimental direction. Works in the domains of the oncology of <b>central</b> and vegetative <b>nervous</b> system, pathology of the liquor circulation, and cerebral blood circulation were the valuable contribution of Burdenko and his school to the theory and practice of neurosurgery.|$|R

5|$|Ctenophores have no brain or <b>central</b> <b>nervous</b> system, {{but instead}} have a nerve net (rather like a cobweb) that forms a ring round {{the mouth and}} is densest near {{structures}} such as the comb rows, pharynx, tentacles (if present) and the sensory complex furthest from the mouth.|$|E
5|$|Hypertonia – Hypertonia {{is marked}} by an {{abnormal}} increase in muscle tension and reduced ability of a muscle to stretch. Hypertonia may result from injury, disease, or conditions which involve damage to the <b>central</b> <b>nervous</b> system (e.g. cerebral palsy).|$|E
5|$|Midazolam {{is known}} to cause {{respiratory}} depression. In healthy humans, 0.15mg/kg of midazolam may cause respiratory depression, which is postulated to be a <b>central</b> <b>nervous</b> system (CNS) effect.

5|$|Symptoms from {{exposure}} to organic lead, which is probably more toxic than inorganic lead due to its lipid solubility, occur rapidly. Poisoning by organic lead compounds has symptoms predominantly in the <b>central</b> <b>nervous</b> system, such as insomnia, delirium, cognitive deficits, tremor, hallucinations, and convulsions.|$|E
5|$|The <b>central</b> <b>nervous</b> system {{consists}} of a brain and paired ventral nerve cords that connect to the brain and run {{along the length of}} the body. The brain is a ring of four ganglia, masses of nerve cells, positioned round the rhynchocoel near its front end – while the brains of most protostome invertebrates encircle the foregut. Most nemertean species have just one pair of nerve cords, many species have additional paired cords, and some species also have a dorsal cord. In some species the cords lie within the skin, but in most they are deeper, inside the muscle layers. The <b>central</b> <b>nervous</b> system is often red or pink because it contains hemoglobin. This stores oxygen for peak activity or when the animal experiences anoxia, for example while burrowing in oxygen-free sediments.|$|E
5|$|According to Lee, she {{received}} a frantic call on June 21, 2009, from an aide on Jackson's staff. The aide reported that Jackson was feeling ill. Lee reported overhearing Jackson complain that {{one side of his}} body was hot, the other side cold. She believed that somebody had given him something that affected his <b>central</b> <b>nervous</b> system. She advised the aide {{to take him to the}} hospital.|$|E
