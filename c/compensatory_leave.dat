50|$|The {{island is}} {{extremely}} isolated and Coast Guardsmen stationed {{on the island}} served one-year tours that were later modified to allow an R&R visit to mainland Japan at the six-month point. At {{the end of this}} isolated tour of duty crew members received an additional 30 days of <b>compensatory</b> <b>leave.</b> While under U.S. administration, on Thursdays a C-130 Hercules from the 345th Tactical Airlift Squadron, Yokota Air Base, Japan, would resupply the island on weekly missions. Often Coast Guardsmen would judge landings by raising placards with large numbers. An unusually long four-hour ground time was scheduled to allow technicians who flew in to perform maintenance on the transmitter and to offload extra fuel from the C-130 to power the island's generator. It also allowed the Coast Guardsmen to read and answer letters while aircrews would snorkel and collect green glass fishing buoys that wash up on the shore. It takes about 45 minutes to walk around the island.|$|E

40|$|This {{article has}} two purposes: {{to explore the}} effects of school and student {{selection}} pro-cedures on the proportions of various student groups that have access to and/or receive Title I services, and to assess whether funding inadequacies or student selection pro-cedures are responsible for current levels of Title I service to disadvantaged students. Data from a demonstration study of compensatory education are used to address both objectives. recent survey of compensatory education programs revealedc ~- 4 that large proportions of elementary students who were lowachievers and / or from poor families were not being served. Nationally, only 47 % of all low-achieving students and 40 % of all students from low-income families were selected for <b>compensatory</b> education, <b>leaving</b> {{more than half the}} population of such students without access to com-pensatory services. Coverage for the doubly disadvantaged-those who were both low achievers and poorl-was only slightly higher than for those who were either low achievers or poor. Using grade equivalent and percentile cutoffs, the proportions of doubly disadvantaged students served was estimated at SO % and 56 %, respectively (Breglio et al., 1978).

40|$|With the {{potential}} for extreme weather conditions, {{it is necessary to}} clarify the policy for office closure, excused absences and the coding of time and attendance (T&A) reports. Please read this policy carefully. Since all employees will be expected to be familiar with this policy if weather conditions so warrant, it is strongly encouraged that each employee keep a copy of this policy handy at home. First, and most important, employees are to presume the office is open for business, regardless of weather conditions or emergency situations that may exist. Each employee is responsible for assessing the weather and transportation conditions that may exist and determining the risk of commuting to work. The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and Forest Service (FS) do not require employees to travel during inclement weather; therefore, a liberal leave policy will be in effect during these periods. Employees who determine the risk is too great will be granted personal leave (annual <b>leave,</b> credit hours, <b>compensatory</b> time and <b>leave</b> without pay [LWOP]). Employees under a flexible schedule may adjust their hours to complete their basic work requirement. However, if conditions are so severe (e. g., public safety authorities urge people to stay home), the office may be closed for {{all or part of the}} day. The primary source of information for FS and BLM employees concerning office closure or delayed arrival due to weather conditions is by contacting either of the following numbers...|$|R
40|$|The {{stock of}} Norwegian {{spring-spawning}} herring Clupea harengus collapsed {{to a state}} of commercial extinction in the 1960 s, probably due to both overexploitation and unfavourable climatic conditions. Since the 1980 s, the stock has fully recovered. Following the collapse, the fish matured at much earlier ages and somewhat larger sizes than previously. Currently, age and size at 50 % maturity have only to some extent returned to pre-collapse levels. Two non-exclusive hypotheses that may account for the maturity changes are (1) the 'compensatory response' hypothesis, predicting that reduced stock size resulting from exploitation leads to faster growth and hence earlier maturity as a phenotypically plastic response to environmental change; and (2) the 'evolutionary response' hypothesis, predicting that intensive exploitation causes selection for early maturation, since few late-maturing phenotypes survive until first spawning. Trends in length-at-age suggest a strong <b>compensatory</b> response, but <b>leave</b> the possibility of evolutionary change unaddressed. In order to disentangle phenotypic and possible genetic changes in maturation, we examined the reaction norm for age and size at maturation to see if any changes had occurred. This reaction norm describes the probabilities of maturing at each relevant age and size. We found small but statistically significant changes in maturation reaction norms; these changes were restricted to 2 out of 6 of the maturation ages. This confirms that growth-related phenotypic plasticity has largely been responsible for the documented changes in maturity, and suggests at most a weak evolutionary response. This is in line with theoretical expectations from the dominating fishing pattern, where pure schools of only mature or only early immature fish were targeted, rather than a fishery on both immature and mature fish simultaneously, as has been the case in stocks of cod Gadus morhua and plaice Pleuronectes platessa, where significant evolutionary responses have been found...|$|R

40|$|Commentators {{have long}} debated how {{to reform the}} {{controversial}} Rule 1 Ob- 5 class action without pausing to ask whether the game is worth the candle. Is private enforcement of Rule lOb- 5 worth preserving, or might we {{be better off with}} exclusive public enforcement? This fundamental but neglected question demands attention today more than ever. An academic consensus has emerged that the typical Rule 1 Ob- 5 class action cannot be defended on <b>compensatory</b> grounds. That <b>leaves</b> the oft-cited, but undertheorized, rationale that private enforcement is a "necessary supplement" to the securities fraud deterrence efforts of the SEC. When this justification is critically examined, however, it proves to be highly debatable. Law and economics scholarship teaches that "bounty hunter" enforcement of an overbroad law, like Rule 10 b- 5, may lead to overdeterrence and stymie governmental efforts to set effective enforcement policy (even assuming away "strike suits" and the agency costs that attend class action litigation); if private enforcement is nevertheless desirable-a contestable proposition-it is because a world without it might result in even greater deviations from optimal deterrence, due to SEC budgetary constraints, inefficiency, and/or capture. By carefully explicating the relative advantages and disadvantages of private Rule 1 Ob- 5 enforcement versus exclusive public enforcement, this Article reveals a new and better way to remedy the shortcomings of the Rule lOb- 5 class action. It proposes that policymakers adopt an "oversight approach" to securities litigation reform by, for example, granting the SEC the ability to screen which Rule 1 Ob- 5 class actions may be filed, and against whom. By muting the overdeterrence threat of private litigation and placing the SEC back at the helm of Rule 1 Ob- 5 enforcement policy, this approach would mitigate the primary disadvantages of private enforcement. Moreover, by preserving a private check on SEC inefficiency and regulatory capture, and allowing the SEC to continue to supplement its budget with private enforcement resources, it would do so without eliminating the primary advantages of the current system. This approach stands in contrast to prior securities litigation reforms, which have responded to the verdeterrence threat posed by Rule 10 b- 5 class actions by rigidly narrowing the scope of private liabilit...|$|R
