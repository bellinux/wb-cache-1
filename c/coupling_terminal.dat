40|$|A novel {{screening}} {{platform for}} potential retroviral fusion inhibitors {{on the basis}} of fully functional membrane‐anchored coiled coil lipopeptide receptors has been established. The work comprises the scrutiny of lateral organization of functional lipids in phase separated bilayers and an in‐depth investigation of the biophysical properties of lipopeptide‐based receptors. Lateral sorting of lipids was detected by the recognition of streptavidin of biotinylated lipids in phase separated bilayers and by nanoscopic patterns in mixed fluorocarbon / hydrocarbon lipid bilayers, employing temperature controlled atomic force microscopy (AFM) as a versatile characterization method. Particular features of fluorocarbon bilayers were additionally investigated in great detail by means of ellipsometry and ATR‐IR spectroscopy. Lipopeptide‐receptors were synthesized {{on the basis of}} a robust and reliable in situ coupling reaction by <b>coupling</b> <b>terminal</b> cysteine modified receptor‐peptides to a maleimide functionalized lipid bilayer. Receptor functionality of the lipopeptides was visualized by specific binding of vesicles and nanoparticles tracked by a multiplicity of characterization methods, such as AFM, ellipsometry, CLSM and fluorescence spectroscopy. Finally, in situ coupling of viral peptides, originating from the fusion protein of HIV resulted in a mimic of the pre‐hairpin intermediate of gp 41. Structural analysis of N 36 ‐lipopepides by means of CD‐spectroscopy in combination with FT‐IR spectroscopy revealed a coiled coil assembly of lipopeptides, which render the aggregates fully functional receptors for potent fusion inhibitors. Thereby, reversible inhibitor binding of T 20 and the corresponding C‐ peptides was detected by AFM and ellipsometry, rendering coiled coil lipopeptides a new promising technique for screening of retroviral fusion inhibitors...|$|E

40|$|During {{the primary}} response, the {{commitment}} of the CD 8 (+) T cell to Blimp- 1 expression and the terminal differentiation that Blimp- 1 induces must be timed so as not to impair the process of clonal expansion. We determined whether the Hippo pathway, which links cell-cell contact to differentiation in other cell lineages, controls Blimp- 1 expression. Activating the CD 8 (+) T cell with antigen and IL- 2 causes expression of the core Hippo pathway components, including the pivotal transcriptional cofactor Yap. Contact between activated CD 8 (+) T cells induces Hippo pathway-mediated Yap degradation and Blimp- 1 expression; a Hippo-resistant, stable form of Yap suppresses Blimp- 1 expression. Cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA- 4) and CD 80 comprise the receptor-ligand pair that mediates contact-dependent Hippo pathway activation. In vivo, CD 8 (+) T cells expressing Hippo resistant-Yap or lacking CTLA- 4 have diminished expression of the senescence marker, KLRG 1, during a viral infection.

40|$|AbstractIn {{the major}} {{peripheral}} plant light-harvesting complex LHCII, excitation energy is transferred between chlorophylls along an energetic cascade {{before it is}} transmitted further into the photosynthetic assembly to be converted into chemical energy. The efficiency of these energy transfer processes involves a complicated interplay of pigment-protein structural reorganization and protein dynamic disorder, and the system must stay robust within the fluctuating protein environment. The final, lowest energy site has been proposed to exist within a trimeric excitonically coupled chlorophyll (Chl) cluster, comprising Chls a 610 -a 611 -a 612. We studied an LHCII monomer with a site-specific mutation resulting {{in the loss of}} Chls a 611 and a 612, and find that this mutant exhibits two predominant overlapping fluorescence bands. From a combination of bulk measurements, single-molecule fluorescence characterization, and modeling, we propose the two fluorescence bands originate from differing conditions of exciton delocalization and localization realized in the mutant. Disruption of the excitonically <b>coupled</b> <b>terminal</b> emitter Chl trimer results in an increased sensitivity of the excited state energy landscape to the disorder induced by the protein conformations. Consequently, the mutant demonstrates a loss of energy transfer efficiency. On the contrary, in the wild-type complex, the strong resonance coupling and correspondingly high degree of excitation delocalization within the Chls a 610 -a 611 -a 612 cluster dampens the influence of the environment and ensures optimal communication with neighboring pigments. These results indicate that the terminal emitter trimer is thus an essential design principle for maintaining the efficient light-harvesting function of LHCII in the presence of protein disorder...|$|R
40|$|Silicon is an {{attractive}} semiconductor material for wide-ranging applications, especially when {{taking advantage of the}} larger surface area of silicon micro and nanowires. Surface functionalization with self-assembled monolayers of (in) organic molecules can be employed to tune the functionality of a substrate towards a desired application. Specifically, solar-to-fuel and sensing devices highly benefit from the use of oxide-free monolayers, since any silicon oxide layer functions as an insulating layer and retards electrical contact with the substrate. For this purpose, hydrosilylation can be used to <b>couple</b> <b>terminal</b> unsaturated carbon-carbon bonds, i. e., 1 -alkenes or 1 -alkynes, onto H-terminated Si which leads to direct Si-C bond formation. The research described in this thesis aims at the formation of molecular monolayers on H-terminated silicon micro and nanowires for solar-to-fuel and sensing devices. In summary, the results described in this thesis demonstrate the versatility of molecular monolayers on H-terminated silicon structures. When applying a monolayer by hydrosilylation, the absence of an insulating oxide layer allows electrical contact between the functionalized headgroup of the monolayer and the substrate. This enables the fabrication of solar-to-fuel devices, in which molecular monolayers ensure electrical passivation of the surface, a controllable doping concentration, covalent or noncovalent immobilization of catalysts, and spatioselective functionalization to couple different catalysts onto the same device. For sensing devices, oxide-free monolayers establish a higher stability of the sensor owing to the direct Si-C bonds, a higher sensitivity due to the selective functionalization of the sensing area only, and a higher specificity when using supramolecular chemistry to make an analyte-specific sensor. These findings offer new perspectives for the development of stabilized silicon micro/nanosystems with engineered functionalities...|$|R
