40|$|We {{propose a}} {{framework}} for compiling programming languages based on concurrent process calculi, in which any computation is expressed {{by a combination of}} processes and communication channels. Our compilation framework realizes a fast dynamic process creation and a low-cost communication between processes. In the framework, a representation of a channel is not allocated in heap, but just put on a register at its creation time. The channel is later elevated to a fully heap-allocated channel as necessary. Under the condition described in the paper, processes may communicate via <b>channels</b> <b>without</b> memory <b>traffic.</b> This correctly implements the semantics of first-class channels, while optimizing the performance in common programming idioms. The framework is given as a set of translation rules from a concurrent calculus to an ML-like sequential program. We developed a compiler for the calculus based on the framework. Experimental results show that sequential programs written in the process calc [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — Campus and {{enterprise}} wireless {{networks are}} increasingly characterized by ubiquitous coverage and rising traffic demands. Efficiently assigning channels to access points (APs) in these networks can significantly affect {{the performance and}} capacity of the wireless LAN. Several research studies have tackled this issue. However, even the state-of-the-art approaches assign <b>channels</b> <b>without</b> considering prevailing <b>traffic</b> demands. The channel assignment problem has a parallel in the wireline world, where recent work has established the tremendous effectiveness of using traffic demands in network engineering decisions. Motivated by this, our paper explores whether {{the quality of a}} channel assignment can be improved by incorporating observed traffic demands at APs and clients into the assignment process. Using extensive simulations over publicly-available wireless traffic traces, as well as synthetic settings, we show that being traffic-aware could substantially improve the overall quality of a channel assignment. We develop and evaluate practical trafficaware assignment algorithms that predict future demands based on historical information and use the predicted demands for assigning channels. Finally we demonstrate the effectiveness of traffic-aware assignment using testbed experiments. I...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} to use Brownian motions to model {{families}} of continuous-time multiuser Gaussian <b>channels</b> <b>without</b> bandwidth limit. It {{turns out that}} such a formulation allows parallel translation of many fundamental notions and techniques from the discrete-time setting to the continuous-time regime, which enables us to derive the capacity regions of a continuous-time white Gaussian multiple access channel with/without feedback, a continuous-time white Gaussian interference <b>channel</b> <b>without</b> feedback and a continuous-time white Gaussian broadcast <b>channel</b> <b>without</b> feedback. In theory, these capacity results give the fundamental transmission limit modulation/coding schemes can achieve for families of continuous-time Gaussian one-hop <b>channels</b> <b>without</b> bandwidth limit; in practice, the explicit capacity regions derived and capacity achieving modulation/coding scheme proposed may provide engineering insights on designing multi-user communication systems operating on an ultra-wideband regime.

40|$|Abroad, large roundabouts are {{accepted}} as a safe and efficient basic form for intersections. In Germany, large roundabouts are also regarded as very efficient but have, until now, exhibited major safety-related shortcomings. It is particularly the solutions based on design principles from {{the sixties and seventies}} which have developed into accident black spots as the level of car ownership has increased. The objective of the research paper was to establish and portray traffic-related and surroundings-oriented fields of application for these solutions on classified roads {{on the basis of a}} systematic investigation of the problem areas of roundabouts with andd <b>without</b> <b>traffic</b> lights. This was based on the results not only of extensive empirical investigations on eleven selected large roundabouts <b>without</b> <b>traffic</b> lights but also of a before-and-after comparison relating to the conversion of three large roundabouts <b>without</b> <b>traffic</b> lights into roundabouts with traffic lights. For existing large roundabouts <b>without</b> <b>traffic</b> lights, recommendations for efficient and cost-saving conversion measures which are intended to reduce safety-related shortcomings were derived from the investigation results. In this respect, the spectrum ranged from the reorganisation of individual designing elements to the subsequent installation of traffic lights. The efficiency of large roundabouts with traffic lights was determined with the aid of empirical investigations and on the basis of results from traffic-simulation runs. As a rule, it is considerably higher than the efficiency of large roundabouts <b>without</b> <b>traffic</b> lights. On the basis of the results of this research paper which, for the first time, went beyond an analysis of the obviously existing safety-related shortcomings of large roundabouts, a distinction with regard to utilisation criteria was made between large roundabouts with and <b>without</b> <b>traffic</b> lights as well as between their locations inside or outside built-up areas. In this respect, it must be borne in mind that it has not yet been possible to prove that large roundabouts <b>without</b> <b>traffic</b> lights are safer with improved designing elements. Therefore, these utilisation criteria must be regarded as provisional. The question relating to the expediency of switching off the traffic lights in periods of light and normal traffic was discussed once again for roundabouts with traffic lights. However, it could not be investigated in great detail within the framework of this research paper. (orig.)
