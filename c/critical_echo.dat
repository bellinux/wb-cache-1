40|$|Abstract. We are {{interested}} in the optimization of the recurrent con-nection structure of Echo State Networks (ESNs), because their topology can strongly influence performance. We study ESN predictive capacity by numerical simulations on Mackey-Glass time series, and find that a particular small subset of ESNs is much better than ordinary ESNs pro-vided that the topology of the recurrent feedback connections satisfies certain conditions. We argue that the small subset separates two large sets of ESNs and this separation can be characterized in terms of phase transitions. With regard to the criticality of this phase transition, we in-troduce the notion of <b>Critical</b> <b>Echo</b> State Networks (CESN). We discuss why CESNs perform better than other ESNs...|$|E
40|$|Recurrent {{networks}} with transfer {{functions that}} fulfil the Lipschitz continuity with K = 1 may be echo state networks if certain {{limitations on the}} recurrent connectivity are applied. It {{has been shown that}} it is sufficient if the largest singular value of the recurrent connectivity is smaller than 1. The main achievement of this paper is a proof under which conditions the network is an echo state network even if the largest singular value is one. It turns out that in this critical case the exact shape of the transfer function plays a decisive role in determining whether the network still fulfills the echo state condition. In addition, several examples with one-neuron networks are outlined to illustrate effects of critical connectivity. Moreover, within the manuscript a mathematical definition for a <b>critical</b> <b>echo</b> state network is suggested...|$|E

30|$|Limitations {{in its use}} also exist. Low echogenicity at surface {{examination}} {{matched with}} contraindications to TEE clearly prevent its use. Whenever there is strict requirement of continuous monitoring (of cardiac output or pulmonary artery pressure) or precise measurement rather than estimation of deemed relevant variables (mainly PAOP or extravascular lung water), ECHO {{is not the right}} tool. In centres where a tradition and adequate training on the use of <b>critical</b> care <b>ECHO</b> exist, this is no frequent [14], and repeated bedside assessment and semi-quantification of hemodynamic variables enable use of ECHO alone as monitoring tool. As it happens with targets of critical care practice other than hemodynamics, integrated monitoring remains fundamental, and ECHO is {{in the best position to}} be used in conjunction with other devices (pulse contour technique based cardiac output monitors, pulmonary artery catheter, PiCCO) [13]. Indeed, it can guide choice between them and timing of use. A final issue is represented by time required to the clinician to acquire sufficient competence in <b>critical</b> care <b>ECHO.</b> For applications beyond focused ECHO, particularly comprehensive hemodynamic monitoring, the training may in fact be demanding [8], and not all physician may be willing to undergo a dedicated training.|$|R
40|$|Although a {{scholarly}} topic over the centuries, emotion was first scientifically approached by Darwin (1872), who advo-cated a functional approach. Soon after, James (1890) started {{a debate about}} the elicitation and differentiation of the emo-tions and even about {{the very definition of}} the term emotion, which still continues. There have been periods of dominance for certain theories, like Tomkins ’ (1962) revival of Darwin’s ideas in the form of discrete or basic emotion theory, a revival of peripheral theories by Schachter (1964), and various reviv-als of Wundt’s (1896) dimensional theory. In the 1960 s, Arnold (1960) and Lazarus (1966) pioneered a new theoreti-cal approach called appraisal theory, which is in essence a systematization of ancient ideas about emotion, reflecting the ideas of Aristotle (1954), Hume (1739 – 1740 / 1969), Spinoza (1677 / 1989), and Sartre (1939). In the 1980 s this approach took on new vigor, with a number of theorists pro-posing variants of appraisal theory, developing concrete pre-dictions, and testing them empirically. Since then, “appraisal” has become a household word in emotion research, but the term is used in widely different forms and different theoreti-cal and atheoretical contexts. This special section attempts to delineate the fundamental architecture of a family of theories that can be rightly called appraisal theories in a strict sense. In this special section we discuss the design features of these theories, their current development, and the empirical support for them, as well as unresolved issues, new developments, and critical objections. Four major contributions outline the scope of the current debate and a group of commentators pro-vide a <b>critical</b> <b>echo.</b> In this special section we focus on the theories of Arnol...|$|E

Here, we describe all the details of the method, including the transition between the two evolution schemes and the details of the numerical implementation for the case of massless scalar fields. We use this scheme to provide more numerical evidence for a recent conjecture on the power-law scaling of the apparent horizon mass resulting from the collapse of subcritical configurations.

40|$|I work in {{the area}} of feminist theory and feminist {{philosophy}} of science. My current research project, which I would like to present in Lund, deals with feminism as critique. What kind of critique is the feminist critique of science? In the wake of poststructuralist inspired antifoundationalism feminism has been given the diagnosis of being in a terrible mess with no uncontested, stable concepts to lean on and no innocent positions outside power expressed in a “we ” that can explain, legitimate and make necessary a specific political agenda. Feminist theory nevertheless tends to <b>echo</b> <b>Critical</b> Theory in that feminist critique explicitly or implicitly is expected to result in argued and qualified justification for a concrete, emancipatory political practice. Thus even if feminism apparently is in a terrible postdeconstructive mess feminist critique of science still unfolds as dialectical critique – i. e. as critique ultimately exercised from an explicit or implicit standpoint outside science. However, dialectical critique is {{out of step with the}} poststructuralist understanding of the relation between knowledge and power; knowledge is always already power. Critique necessarily has to unfold immanent to the very regimes of power/knowledge it seeks to adjudicate. Inside a poststructuralist framework critique thus only makes sense as intervention – i. e. as critique intervening with the object in question aiming at some kind of subversion rather than emancipation.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the determinants of}} "echoing" in antidumping (AD) cases (i. e., different countries sequentially imposing AD measures on the same product from the same exporter). We develop a dynamic game in which two competing importers can choose to impose an AD duty on a third exporting country {{in one of two}} periods, if at all. Assuming that governments are politically motivated (favoring their import competing industries), we find that a country imposes an AD duty in the first (second) period independently of the other country’s actions if its political-economy parameter is "very high" ("high"). Instead, it never introduces AD measures when its political-economy parameter is below a <b>critical</b> "low" threshold. <b>Echoing</b> occurs for intermediate values of the political-economy parameter: a country chooses to impose an AD duty in the second period if and only if the competing importer has done so in the first period. Using a novel AD dataset, we document that echoing is a common practice among both traditional and new users of AD. In line with the conclusions of the theoretical model, the econometric results show that AD measures {{are more likely to be}} introduced in response to other countries’ measures when governments care to some extent, but not too much, about their import-competing industries. Thus, this paper shows that countries’ political-economy-driven trade policies are interdependent and should not be analyzed in isolation...|$|R

It is a widely accepted fact that the computational capability of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) is maximized on the so-called "edge of criticality. " Once the network operates in this configuration, it performs efficiently on a specific application both in terms of: 1) low prediction error and 2) high short-term memory capacity. Since the behavior of recurrent networks is strongly influenced by the particular input signal driving the dynamics, a universal, application-independent method for determining the edge of criticality is still missing. In this paper, we aim at addressing this issue by proposing a theoretically motivated, unsupervised method based on Fisher information for determining the edge of criticality in RNNs.
