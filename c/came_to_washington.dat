5|$|By 1962, Congress {{had passed}} {{legislation}} to deny financial aid grants to Yugoslavia, {{to withdraw the}} sale of spare parts for Yugoslav warplanes, and to revoke the country's most favored nation status. Kennan strongly protested the legislation, arguing that it would only result in a straining of relations between Yugoslavia and the U.S. Kennan <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>Washington</b> {{during the summer of}} 1962 to lobby against the legislation but was unable to elicit a change from Congress. President Kennedy endorsed Kennan privately but remained noncommittal publicly, as {{he did not want to}} jeopardize his slim majority support in Congress on a potentially contentious issue. With U.S.–Yugoslav relations getting progressively worse, Kennan tendered his resignation as ambassador during late July 1963.|$|E
5|$|The new senator {{took his}} seat when Congress convened in December 1857 (the term of his predecessor, James C. Jones, had expired in March). He <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>Washington</b> as usual without {{his wife and}} family; Eliza would visit Washington only once during Johnson's first time as senator, in 1860. Johnson {{immediately}} set about introducing the Homestead Bill in the Senate, but as most senators who supported it were Northern (many associated with the newly founded Republican Party), the matter became caught up in suspicions over the slavery issue. Southern senators felt that those who {{took advantage of the}} provisions of the Homestead Bill {{were more likely to be}} Northern non-slaveholders. The issue of slavery had been complicated by the Supreme Court's ruling earlier in the year in Dred Scott v. Sandford that slavery could not be prohibited in the territories. Johnson, a slaveholding senator from a Southern state, made a major speech in the Senate the following May in an attempt to convince his colleagues that the Homestead Bill and slavery were not incompatible. Nevertheless, Southern opposition was key to defeating the legislation, 30–22. In 1859, it failed on a procedural vote when Vice President Breckinridge broke a tie against the bill, and in 1860, a watered-down version passed both houses, only to be vetoed by Buchanan at the urging of Southerners. Johnson continued his opposition to spending, chairing a committee to control it.|$|E

He comes {{from a long line}} of working people in Scranton—auto salesmen, car dealers, people who know how to make a sale. He has that great Irish gift." [...] Political columnist David S. Broder has viewed Biden as having grown since he <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>Washington</b> and since his failed 1988 presidential bid: [...] "He responds to real people—that's been consistent throughout. And his ability to understand himself and deal with other politicians has gotten much much better." [...] Traub concludes that [...] "Biden is the kind of fundamentally happy person who can be as generous toward others as he is to himself." ...|$|E

By October 1986 the race was heating up, with Rangel the underdog coming close to Representative Tony Coelho from California through use of his personal skills and Rangel arguing that the Democratic leadership needed better regional balance. However, in December 1986, Coelho defeated Rangel in the whip election, 167–78. Rangel attributed his loss to Coelho having funded the campaigns of many House members via his role as chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, later saying, “I had never been so goddamn naive. I <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>Washington</b> as an experienced politician. How did I miss Coelho’s contribution to members?” ...|$|E
500|$|When Harrison <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>Washington,</b> {{he wanted}} to show both that he was still the steadfast hero of Tippecanoe, and that he was a better educated and {{thoughtful}} man than the backwoods caricature portrayed in the campaign. He took the oath of office on Thursday, March 4, 1841, a cold and wet day. He wore neither an overcoat nor hat, rode on horseback to the ceremony rather than in the closed carriage that had been offered him, and delivered the longest inaugural address in American history. At 8,445 words, it took him nearly two hours to read, although his friend and fellow Whig Daniel Webster had edited it for length. After becoming the first head of state to have his photograph taken, Harrison then rode through the streets in the inaugural parade, and that evening attended three inaugural balls, including one at Carusi's Saloon entitled the [...] "Tippecanoe" [...] ball, which at a price of US$10 per person (equal to $ today) attracted 1,000 guests.|$|E

Barber was selected to design the quarter eagle. Both Atiken and Keck objected to the Commission of Fine Arts and to McAdoo; Keck also submitted additional designs. [...] Both men met with McAdoo, Malburn and Dewey in Washington, and agreed to changes to their proposed designs. [...] With that done, the $50 and $1 pieces were approved on March 6, 1915.

500|$|Some critics {{called it}} {{inappropriate}} {{for the first}} lady to {{play a central role}} in matters of public policy. Supporters pointed out that Clinton's role in policy was no different from that of other White House advisors and that voters had been well aware that she would play an active role in her husband's presidency. Bill Clinton's campaign promise of [...] "two for the price of one" [...] led opponents to refer derisively to the Clintons as [...] "co-presidents" [...] or sometimes use the Arkansas label [...] "Billary". The pressures of conflicting ideas about the role of a first lady were enough to send Hillary Clinton into [...] "imaginary discussions" [...] with the also-politically-active Eleanor Roosevelt. From the time she <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>Washington,</b> Hillary also found refuge in a prayer group of the Fellowship that featured many wives of conservative Washington figures. Triggered in part by the death of her father in April 1993, she publicly sought to find a synthesis of Methodist teachings, liberal religious political philosophy and Tikkun editor Michael Lerner's [...] "politics of meaning" [...] to overcome what she saw as America's [...] "sleeping sickness of the soul"; that would lead to a willingness [...] "to remold society by redefining what it means to be a human being in the twentieth century, moving into a new millennium." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1869, Grant {{appointed}} his aide General Ely S. Parker, a Seneca Indian, as {{the first}} Native American Commissioner of Indian Affairs. During Parker's first year in office, the number of Indian Wars per year dropped by 43 from 101 to 58. Chief of the Oglala Sioux Red Cloud wanted to meet President Grant, after learning that Parker was appointed Indian Commissioner. Red Cloud, along with chief of the Brulé Sioux Spotted Tail, <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>Washington,</b> D.C. by train and met with Parker and President Grant in 1870. Grant held no personal animosity towards Native Americans and personally treated them with dignity. [...] When Red Cloud and Spotted Tail first met Grant at the White House on May 7, 1870, {{they were given a}} bountiful dinner and entertainment equal to what was shown to a young Prince Arthur at a White House visit from Britain in 1869. At their second meeting on May 8, Red Cloud informed Grant that Whites were trespassing on Native American lands and that his people needed food and clothing. Out of concern for Native Americans, Grant ordered all Generals in the West to [...] "keep intruders off by military force if necessary". To prevent Native American hostilities and wars, Grant lobbied for and signed the Indians Appropriations Act of 1870–1871. This act ended the governmental policy of treating tribes as independent sovereign nations. Native Americans would be treated as individuals or wards of the state and Indian policies would be legislated by Congressional statutes.|$|E
