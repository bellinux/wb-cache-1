25|$|James Boone Lankershim (1850-1931), {{a wealthy}} wheat farmer and miller whose father owned {{much of the}} San Fernando Valley in the late 19th Century, hired {{architect}} John F. Blee to design the building. Constructed at a reported cost of $200,000, the building opened in 1907 and {{was considered one of}} the finest office buildings in the city. The lobby has a 22-foot ceiling, and the exterior is decorated with elaborate <b>cornice</b> <b>work</b> and spandrel panels with an incised diamond motif. Originally a six-story structure, two additional stories designed by Robert Brown Young & Son were added in 1911.|$|E

The bottom band is of elephants with different expressions, as symbolic supporters of the entire structure. Above it is an empty layer, followed by <b>cornice</b> <b>work</b> with a periodic lion face. Above it is another band of scroll and then cornice band, except {{at the back of}} the temple where a row of horsemen in various riding positions are depicted.|$|E
50|$|In 1711 a brick {{front was}} added to the main hall house, and two wings with tiled roofs, wooden <b>cornice</b> <b>work</b> and large dormers. The grand centre section of the {{building}} includes imitation battlements and a working belfry (believed to have been used previously to call workers on the estate). The pedimented entrance porch includes a coat-of-arms.|$|E
50|$|Zahner {{was founded}} in 1897 by Andrew Zahner as Eagle <b>Cornice</b> <b>Works,</b> serving the region with {{decorative}} <b>cornice</b> <b>works</b> and repair. In 1913, the company became A. Zahner Sheet Metal Company, and {{over the course of}} the century would produce metal-work from industrial kitchen tables to metal work on buildings. In 1989, Andrew Zahner's great-grandson, L. William Zahner III became company president, and is credited with transforming the company from a regional sheet-metal contractor into a national architectural metals and facades producer. He also guided the company towards producing works by artists as well as architects.|$|R
50|$|Designed {{by local}} architects Dufrene and Mendelssohn in 1884, the three-story Specht Building was modeled in the Italian Renaissance Revival Style. This {{was a popular}} style for {{cast-iron}} facade buildings. Christian Specht's company, the Western <b>Cornice</b> <b>Works,</b> manufactured the facade. The company was a manufacturer of galvanized iron cornices, finials and other metal building products. Today the building is renowned for its artistic value by representing this period's usage of iron.|$|R

5000|$|S. Astvatsatsin is a {{cruciform}} type {{church with}} four two-story chambers in the corners. A large circular twelve-faceted drum sits {{on top of}} the church, with pairs of thin decorative columns {{standing at the edge of}} each facet. A conical umbrella type dome rests above. The exterior of the church is simply decorated with edging around the portal and saddles of some small windows, layers of <b>cornice</b> <b>work</b> just above the thin columns on the drum and dome, and some cross relief designs carved into the façades.|$|E
50|$|Baltimore County School No. 7, {{also known}} as Ashland School, is a {{historic}} school building located at Cockeysville, Baltimore County, Maryland. It was constructed in 1882 {{at the entrance to}} the village of Ashland, associated with the Ashland Iron Works. It is built of rough cut marble ashlar a nearby quarry. The exterior reflects the influence of the Queen Anne style with gabled windows, elaborate <b>cornice</b> <b>work,</b> fan-shaped attic vents at the roof peak, and numerous large banks of multi-paned windows. Originally a two-room schoolhouse, it was converted to a private residence in 1930.|$|E

50|$|The {{height of}} the {{structure}} varies from 7 to 15 feet. But the design was uniquely made. There is a wide <b>cornice</b> shaped architectural <b>work</b> {{at the top of}} every single pillar. The two walls consist of a number of designed square holes in a half circular thickened part at the upper portion of the wall.|$|R
50|$|Sawdust {{has been}} used as a {{substitute}} for hair and also instead of sand as an aggregate. Sawdust will enable mortar to stand the effects of frost and rough weather. It is useful sometimes for heavy <b>cornices</b> and similar <b>work,</b> as it renders the material light and strong. The sawdust should be used dry. The sawdust is used to bind the mix sometimes to make it go further.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} {{portion of}} the building, constructed during 1907 and 1908, is six stories tall, buff colored Roman brick with steel frame, with concrete floors and roof. Fronting on East Carson street, the main commercial road in the South Side Flats, it is 108 ft wide by 116 ft deep, with terra cotta first story wall cladding and <b>cornice</b> trim <b>work.</b> A three-story and mezzanine addition, 36 ft wide by 116 ft deep {{was built on the}} building's east side in 1936. A one story addition was added to the rear in 1950. The building has been renovated and rehabilitated several times, including 1967-1968 when it was purchased by Goodwill Industries of Pittsburgh for use as its headquarters, store, and workshop, and again in 2012 when it was converted to use as an apartment building.|$|R
5000|$|Directly {{opposite}} {{the station is}} the now closed Groudle Glen Hotel which was built upon {{the arrival of the}} railway in 1893 and designed by the renowned architect Baillie Scott. It operated as a public bar for many years before being sold by the local brewery in 1999 and converted into a restaurant known as [...] "La Casa". Its remote location ensured that the venture was not entirely successful; however, the new owners did much aesthetic work on the building, restoring stained glass windows, recreating historical signage and completely repainting the building including much of the original detailing such as the [...] "three legs" [...] motifs in the <b>cornice</b> <b>work.</b>|$|E
50|$|The Woods {{brothers}} had the four-story Victor Bank building constructed in 1899; It was completed on December 24, 1899. The Bank Block building was representative of turn-of-the-century commercial buildings. The Italianate structure with bays, large storefront windows and <b>cornice</b> <b>work</b> {{is the largest}} building in Victor. When it opened it held the Woods brothers' bank, First National Bank of Victor, lodging rooms, and consulting and retail businesses. The Woods had a reversal of fortunes. Bank examiners found that the bank was insolvent and closed it on November 4, 1903. The Woods brothers then sold the building. A subsequent bank in the building was the Citizen’s Bank of Victor. It was once considered the most modern edifice in the Cripple Creek District.|$|E
50|$|The {{interior}} naves {{are separated}} by five rounded-arches over rectangular pillars, with salient bases and capitals in granite. These naves are covered by wood ceilings and false vaults over granite cornices. The high choir, in wood, with balustrade overhangs the lower choir and interior baptistry, situated in the tower. In the third pillar opposite the epistle is a wooden pulpit, with rectangular basin over corbels (also in wood) that contort around the pillar with guardrail decorated in palms and crosses, surmounted by baldachin and reached by stone stairs, with guard of wooden balusters, skirting the pillar. At {{the front of the}} lateral naves are chapels under triumphal archways sheltering the retables in polychromatic and gilded woodwork, surmounted by oculae. The archways are surmounted by cornice with curvilinear angles, interconnect with the lateral <b>cornice</b> <b>work.</b>|$|E
25|$|The small shrine was {{inadequate}} for the Jesuits and planning began immediately {{for a new}} church building. The king wanted a new monumental building with three naves but the Society favored a plan more {{in keeping with the}} principles enunciated by the Council of Trent, emphasizing simplicity and functionality. The first stone was laid in 1555, but the building was redesigned and expanded (its present version) in 1565. The royal architect, Alfonso Álvares (1557–1575), appears to have supervised the work from 1566 to 1575, up {{to the level of the}} interior <b>cornice.</b> The <b>work</b> was carried on afterwards by his nephew, Baltasar Álvares (fl. 1570-1624), also royal architect. The building was completed by Filipe Térzi (Filippo Terzi, 1520–97), royal architect to King Philip II of Spain (= Philip I of Portugal, 1580–1598); Térzi made modifications to the exterior façade, the ceiling and roof, and the interior finishings.|$|R
6000|$|... § V. None of {{the types}} are, however, found in {{perfection}} of curvature, except in the best <b>work.</b> Very often <b>cornices</b> are <b>worked</b> with circular segments (with a noble, massive effect, for instance, in St. Michele of Lucca), or with rude approximation to finer curvature, especially a, Plate XV., which occurs often so small as to render it useless to take much pains upon its curve. It occurs perfectly pure in the condition represented by 1 of the series 1-6, in Plate XV., {{on many of the}} Byzantine and early Gothic buildings of Venice; in more developed form it becomes the profile of the bell of the capital in the later Venetian Gothic, and in much of the best Northern Gothic. It also represents the Corinthian capital, in which the curvature is taken from the bell to be added in some excess to the nodding leaves. It is the most graceful of all simple profiles of cornice and capital.|$|R
50|$|The facade on the Boulevard des Batignolles {{combines}} Romanesque and the Renaissance elements.It is over 100 m in length, {{flanked by}} square towers, The decor includes multi-colored geometric brick patterns, serrated <b>cornices,</b> wrought iron <b>work</b> and carved reliefs representing Trade, Industry, Science and Art.The pediment {{of the main}} entrance is crowned by a bust of Athena.The design was not a complete break from the barracks-style schools of the period, but Train had {{tried to make it}} more welcoming and modern.The finished building was praised for its design and appearance, and for achieving good quality at low cost.|$|R
5000|$|The {{foundation}} of the home is constructed of local limestone; quarried from the nearby community of Peewee Valley, Kentucky. Lumber, tools, and other materials used {{in the construction of}} the home were hauled in two-horse wagons, a commonly used conveyance of the time. [...] The two-story frame and weatherboard house has a hipped roof and a one-story veranda, which spans the entire main façade. The front entryway includes an elaborate front door with overhead fanlights and sidelights - a typical feature with the Colonial Revival styles of the period. These features, along with the fine dentil molding of the porch and <b>cornice</b> <b>work,</b> make this house a particularly fine example of Wood's work. The home also features a multiple columned porch distinctive to the style. This home style went on to greatly influence the 1908 design of the W. S. Forrester House; a residence attributed to Henry Frank, a local builder who had served as an apprentice to Wood. [...] Since its completion, Hausgen House has remained intact, with no known changes made to its Colonial Revival styling. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983 and has undergone significant renovations since that time.|$|E
50|$|No. 1. 132-134 North Calumet Road, c. 1905, I.O.O.F Lodge - The International Order of Odd Fellows Lodge {{was built}} c. 1905, {{shortly after the}} devastating fire of 1902. The local chapter {{purchased}} this site in 1910, removed the original wood frame building, and built this brick and stone trimmed building. While of no particular style, the oriel bay, <b>cornice</b> <b>work,</b> and heavy window lintels give the building a modest Neo-Classical Revival influence. The building is a rhomboid to fit the irregular block layout of the downtown.. The lodge used the upper floors {{of the building and}} rented the ground floor to shopkeepers. The wooden storefront configuration of large windows with wood frames and a recessed entry with wood single light door seems to be the original layout. The central and corner piers of brick banded with stone divide the storefront in halves. The south entry leads to a stairs to the upper floor. Taking advantage of the unusual lot, the storefront wraps around to {{the north side of the}} building with a single window to catch the eye of pedestrians up the street. The upper floor is hard fired dark brown face brick. The upper floor windows are one-over-one double hung windows with stone sills and lintels. Over the north half storefront, the second floor has a rectangular oriel window with simple classical ornamentation, and a double window to the front and narrow windows on the sides. The cornice has brick corbels at two points and a table of alternately recessed bricks, creating the impression of dentils. A stone coping caps the parapet, which crow steps down to the west or rear of the building. Datagraphic Printing is housed in the building.|$|E

50|$|The {{basic form}} of minarets {{consists}} of three parts: a base, shaft, and a gallery. For the base, the ground is excavated until a hard foundation is reached. Gravel and other supporting materials {{may be used as}} a foundation; it is unusual for the minaret to be built directly upon ground-level soil. Minarets may be conical (tapering), square, cylindrical, or polygonal (faceted). Stairs circle the shaft in a counter-clockwise fashion, providing necessary structural support to the highly elongated shaft. The gallery is a balcony that encircles the upper sections from which the muezzin may give the call to prayer. It is covered by a roof-like canopy and adorned with ornamentation, such as decorative brick and tile <b>work,</b> <b>cornices,</b> arches and inscriptions, with the transition from the shaft to the gallery typically sporting muqarnas.|$|R

40|$|The paper {{concerns}} the buildings under {{the church of}} St. Eulalia at Cagliari (Sardinia – Italy). Some ruins relating to the Late Antiquity and Early Middle Age put to light during the archaeological excavations from 1990 and 2008 are very interesting to study the urbanism of the ancient town {{as well as the}} wall texture. The stone seems to be the most used through the different phases. In the last period they used also the opus africanum, coming from Africasince Punic age, but re-used in Vandal and Byzantine times. In wall textures as in structural/decorative parts (architraves, <b>worked</b> <b>cornices,</b> etc.) have been used mainly local sedimentary lithologies of the Cagliari Miocene series: i. e., "Pietracantone", "Tramezzario", "Pietra forte". The first two are the most used, but they have frequent decay problems due to their minero-petrographic characteristics and of high porosity. The biodeterioration of cultural heritage caused by different biological agents is very important and should always be considered in relation to environmental conditions such as temperature and humidity. The results of the research in the archaeological area of St. Eulalia showed that microbial contamination was represented by a multiplicity of bacteria and fungi, sometimes visible macroscopically...|$|R

2500|$|The {{monument}} {{is described}} by Kelly's Directory as: [...] "richly carved and gilt, and upon the base within arched recesses are kneeling effigies of the parents, and in smaller recesses effigies of two sons; intermediate columns support a <b>cornice</b> of panel <b>work,</b> enriched with armorial bearings and ornaments" [...] The stone monument was originally completely painted and gilded. Henry and Elizabeth sit within an aedicule and kneel facing each other in prayer {{either side of a}} gabled ark, in front of which lies a covered small child with head on pillow. Columns flank the figures, beyond which kneels a further figure of a son each side, set in front of an arched recess under a portico of four columns, and slightly set back; plinths above the canopies are topped with plain square tapered black columns as pinnacles. The columns either side of Henry and Elizabeth are headed by Corinthian capitals that sit beneath an architrave, frieze and cornice that continue across the monument but set back. Below the set back frieze, and enclosing scrollwork and a memorial plaque, is a chamfered arch with a spandrel each side containing a roundel with embossed decoration. On the frieze run recessed oblong panels separated by relief heads. Above the cornice the line of the columns is continued by plinths, supporting tapered pinnacles topped by moulding and ball. Above the set back cornice is a complete heraldic achievement set within square columns decoratively embossed, and with scrollwork as support at the sides, and topped by a further architrave, frieze and cornice reflecting those below, above which is further scrollwork.|$|R

For while real {{commerce}} {{is founded}} on real necessities or uses, and limited by these, speculation, of which the object is merely gain, seeks to excite imaginary necessities and popular desires, in order to gather its temporary profit from the supply of them. So that not only the persons who lend their money to it will be finally robbed, but the work done with their money will be, for the most part, useless, and thus the entire body of the public injured {{as well as the}} persons concerned in the transaction. Take, for instance, the architectural decorations of railways throughout the kingdom,--representing many millions of money for which no farthing of dividend can ever be forthcoming. The public will not be induced to pay the smallest fraction of higher fare to Rochester or Dover because the ironwork of the bridge which carries them over the Thames is covered with floral cockades, and the piers of it edged with ornamental <b>cornices.</b> All that <b>work</b> is simply put there by the builders that they may put the percentage upon it into their own pockets; and, {{the rest of the money}} being thrown into that floral form, there is an end of it, as far as the shareholders are concerned. Millions upon millions have thus been spent, within the last twenty years, on ornamental arrangements of zigzag bricks, black and blue tiles, cast-iron foliage, and the like; of which millions, as I said, not a penny can ever return into the shareholders' pockets, nor contribute to public speed or safety on the line. It is all sunk forever in ornamental architecture, and (trust me for this!) all that architecture is bad. As such, it had incomparably better not have been built. Its only result will be to corrupt what capacity of taste or right pleasure in such work we have yet left to us! And consider a little, what other kind of result than that might have been attained if all those millions had been spent usefully: say, in buying land for the people, or building good houses for them, or (if it had been imperatively required to be spent decoratively) in laying out gardens and parks for them,--or buying noble works of art for their permanent possession,--or, best of all, establishing frequent public schools and libraries. Count what those lost millions would have so accomplished for you! But you left the affair to [...] "supply and demand," [...] and the British public had not brains enough to [...] "demand" [...] land, or lodging, or books. It [...] "demanded" [...] cast-iron cockades and zigzag cornices, and is [...] "supplied" [...] with them, to its beatitude for evermore.|$|R
