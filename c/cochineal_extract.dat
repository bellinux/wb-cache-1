40|$|Abstract. The {{purity of}} {{synthetic}} carminic acid was quantified using potentiometric and conductimetric titrations, allowing its {{use as a}} secondary standard because {{there is not a}} primary one. Polarographic analysis (in ethanol-water 50 : 50, v/v) of carminic acid showed two reduction signals, each with a different number of electrons. The first reduction had more Nernstian behaviour and can be applied in analyses. Differential pulse polarography (DPP) produced a detection limit of 0. 55 µg mL- 1. The results indicate that DPP can be used to determine carminic acid content in <b>cochineal</b> <b>extracts...</b>|$|R
50|$|This {{tradition}} of retablos was also brought into New Mexico and southern Colorado by Franciscan monks.

5|$|By {{the middle}} of the century, the palette had {{expanded}} to include red, black, green, yellow, and gray which signifies different aspects of the earth as defined by different locations of the reservation. Navajo used indigo to obtain shades from pale blue to near black and mixed it with indigenous yellow dyes such as the rabbit brush plant to obtain bright green effects. Red was the most difficult dye to obtain locally. Early Navajo textiles use <b>cochineal,</b> an <b>extract</b> from a Mesoamerican beetle, which often made a circuitous trade route through Spain and England {{on its way to the}} Navajo. Reds used in Navajo weaving tended to be raveled from imported textiles. The Navajo obtained black dye through piñon pitch and ashes.|$|R

40|$|Purpose: {{the purpose}} of this study was to {{determine}} whether natural dyes facilitate posterior hyaloid detachment (posterior vitreous detachment [PVD]) and retinal internal limiting membrane (ILM) peeling in human eyes. Methods: Open-sky vitrectomy with posterior hyaloid and ILM removal was performed in 86 human cadaveric eyes. After core vitrectomy, 11 different dyes were injected into the vitreous cavity to aid hyaloid detachment and ILM removal. the dyes were allowed to settle on the macula for 5 minutes after PVD and were removed by mechanical aspiration. Intraocular forceps were used for ILM peeling, which was confirmed by light microscopy of the peeled tissue. Acai fruit (Euterpe oleracea) extract and 10 additional dyes from plants or animal sources were tested: pomegranate (Punica granatum), logwood (Haematoxylum campechianum), chlorophyll extract from alfalfa (Medicago sativa), cochineal (Dactylopius coccus), hibiscus (Hibiscus rosa-sinensis), indigo (Indigofera tinctoria), paprika (Capiscum annuum), turmeric (Curcuma longa), old fustic (Maclura tinctoria), and grape (Vitis vinifera). Results: the dyes facilitated PVD and ILM peeling. Acai fruit (E. oleracea) extract, logwood (H. campechianum), cochineal (D. coccus), and old fustic (M. tinctoria) facilitated PVD in all cases; dye-assisted PVD was compared with triamcinolone-assisted PVD performed previously in a comparative model. Acai fruit (E. oleracea) <b>extract,</b> <b>cochineal</b> (D. coccus), and chlorophyll extract from alfalfa (M. sativa) showed the best capability for ILM staining; dye-assisted ILM removal was compared with the ILM peeling guided by indocyanine green staining performed previously in a comparative model. Light microscopy confirmed the ILM removal in all cases. Conclusion: Anthocyanin dye of the acai fruit (E. oleracea) and the dyes from cochineal (D. coccus) and chlorophyll extract from alfalfa (M. sativa) resulted in the best capability for posterior hyaloid and ILM staining in human cadaveric eyes and may be a useful tool for vitreoretinal surgery.

5000|$|Carmine ( [...] or [...] ), {{also called}} cochineal, <b>cochineal</b> <b>extract,</b> crimson lake or carmine lake, natural red 4, C.I. 75470, or E120, is a pigment of a bright-red color {{obtained}} from the aluminium salt of carminic acid; {{it is also a}} general term for a particularly deep-red color. The pigment is produced from some scale insects such as the cochineal scale and certain Porphyrophora species (Armenian cochineal and Polish cochineal). Carmine is used in the manufacture of artificial flowers, paints, crimson ink, rouge and other cosmetics, and some medications. It is routinely added to food products such as yogurt, candy and certain brands of juice, the most notable ones being those of the ruby-red variety.|$|E

40|$|Trametes versicolor (Tv) fungus can degrade {{synthetic}} dyes {{that contain}} azo groups, anthraquinone, triphenylmethane polymers, and heterocyclic groups. However, no references {{have been found}} related to the degradation of natural dyes, such as the carminic acid that is contained in the <b>cochineal</b> <b>extract.</b> Experiments to determine the decolorization of the effluent used in the cotton dyeing process with <b>cochineal</b> <b>extract</b> by means of Tv fungus were done. Treatments to determine decolorization in {{the presence or absence}} of Kirk's medium, glucose, and fungus, with an addition of 50 % (v v- 1) of nonsterilized effluent were performed. Physicochemical characterization was performed at the start and end of the treatment. Degradation kinetics were determined. A direct relationship was found between the dry weight of fungi, pH, and the decolorization system, with higher decolorization at lower pH levels (pH ~ 4. 3). High decolorization (81 % ± 0. 09; 88 % ± 0. 17; and 99 % ± 0. 04) for three of the eight treatments (Kirk's medium without glucose, Kirk's medium with glucose, and without medium with glucose, respectively) was found. Toxicity tests determined an increase in the initial effluent toxicity (7. 33 TU) compared with the final treatment (47. 73 TU) in a period of 11 days. For this system, a degradation sequence of the carminic acid structure present in the effluent by the Tv fungus is suggested, in which it is seen that metabolites still containing aromatic structures are generated...|$|E
40|$|International audienceAnthraquinones {{constitute}} {{the largest group}} of quinoid pigments with about 700 compounds described. Their role as food colorants is strongly discussed in the industry and among scientists, due to the 9, 10 -anthracenedione structure, which is a good candidate for DNA interaction, with subsequent positive and/or negative effect(s). Benefits (Dr Jekyll) and inconveniences (Mr Hyde) of three anthraquinones from a plant (madder color), an insect (<b>cochineal</b> <b>extract)</b> and filamentous fungi (Arpink Red) are presented in this review. For example excellent stability in food formulation and variety of hues are opposed to allergenicity and carcinogenicity. All the anthraquinone molecules are not biologically active and research effort is requested for this strange group of food pigments...|$|E
30|$|From an {{historical}} {{point of view}} considering insects as food is not something new in Western societies. Greeks and Romans were consuming several kinds of insects (like grasshoppers and beetle larvae) which they considered delicacies (DeFoliart 1999). Nowadays consumers eat ingredients derived from insects mainly as additives or accidentally through the food processing. For example, an additive called carmine or cochineal is commonly used to add a red/pink colour to many food products such as yogurts, candies and drinks (Greenhawt and Baldwin 2008). This ingredient is a pigment of a bright-red colour obtained from specific insects (cochinidae), and it is coded as E 120 in the food labelling process. A couple of years ago, the US Food and Drug Administration set up a rule requiring food companies to list <b>cochineal</b> <b>extract</b> and carmine on their labels when they are used in food products or cosmetics, {{but it does not}} require companies to indicate that these ingredients are derived from insects (van Huis 2013).|$|E
