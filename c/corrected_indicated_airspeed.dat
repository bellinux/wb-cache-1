50|$|Position error {{affects the}} <b>indicated</b> <b>airspeed</b> and the <b>indicated</b> altitude. Aircraft {{manufacturers}} use the {{aircraft flight manual}} to publish details of the error in <b>indicated</b> <b>airspeed</b> and <b>indicated</b> altitude across the operating range of speeds. In many aircraft, the effect of position error on airspeed is shown as the difference between <b>indicated</b> <b>airspeed</b> and calibrated airspeed. In some low-speed aircraft, the position error is shown as the difference between <b>indicated</b> <b>airspeed</b> and equivalent airspeed.|$|R
50|$|The <b>indicated</b> <b>{{airspeed}}</b> {{is close}} to the true airspeed only at sea level in standard conditions and at low speeds. At 11,000 m, an <b>indicated</b> <b>airspeed</b> of 300 kn may correspond to a true airspeed of 500 kn in standard conditions.|$|R
5000|$|The {{error in}} <b>indicated</b> <b>airspeed</b> must also not be excessive. Part 23, §23.1323(b) {{includes}} the following requirement for the <b>airspeed</b> <b>indicating</b> system: ...|$|R
25|$|The actual speeds {{represented}} by these designators {{are specific to}} a particular model of aircraft. They are expressed by the aircraft's <b>indicated</b> <b>airspeed</b> (and not by, for example, the ground speed), so that pilots may use them directly, without having to apply correction factors, as aircraft instruments also show <b>indicated</b> <b>airspeed.</b>|$|R
25|$|<b>Indicated</b> <b>{{airspeed}}</b> (IAS) is the {{airspeed indicator}} reading (ASIR) uncorrected for instrument, position, and other errors. From current EASA definitions: <b>Indicated</b> <b>airspeed</b> means the speed of an aircraft as shown on its pitot static airspeed indicator calibrated to reflect standard atmosphere adiabatic compressible flow at sea level uncorrected for airspeed system errors.|$|R
50|$|Calibrated <b>airspeed</b> (CAS) is <b>indicated</b> <b>airspeed</b> <b>corrected</b> for {{instrument}} and position error.|$|R
50|$|An {{airspeed}} indicator {{is used to}} measure <b>indicated</b> <b>airspeed</b> (IAS) in knots.|$|R
50|$|At higher altitudes, the {{air density}} {{is lower than}} at sea level. Because of the {{progressive}} reduction in air density, as the aircraft’s altitude increases its true airspeed is progressively greater than its <b>indicated</b> <b>airspeed.</b> For example, the <b>indicated</b> <b>airspeed</b> at which an aircraft stalls can be considered constant, but the true airspeed at which it stalls increases with altitude.|$|R
50|$|Calibrated {{airspeed}} {{in knots}} is usually abbreviated as KCAS, while <b>indicated</b> <b>airspeed</b> is abbreviated as KIAS.|$|R
5000|$|KCAS is [...] "knots {{calibrated}} airspeed", the <b>indicated</b> <b>airspeed</b> <b>corrected</b> {{for position}} error and instrument error ...|$|R
500|$|... or both, and {{the pilot}} {{maintains}} the same pitch attitude, the <b>indicated</b> <b>airspeed</b> will increase, possibly exceeding ...|$|R
5000|$|... for navigation, CAS is {{traditionally}} calculated {{as one of}} the steps between <b>indicated</b> <b>airspeed</b> and true airspeed; ...|$|R
50|$|At {{increased}} altitude (more accurately, density altitude), for {{the same}} given <b>indicated</b> <b>airspeed</b> (IAS) the aircraft's true airspeed (TAS) will be higher, but the same <b>indicated</b> <b>airspeed</b> limits apply. Likewise, most efficient cruise speed, total drag, available lift, stall speed, and other aerodynamic information depend on calibrated, not true airspeed. Most aircraft exhibit a small difference between the airspeed actually shown on the instrument (<b>indicated</b> <b>airspeed,</b> or IAS) and the speed the instrument should theoretically show (calibrated airspeed or CAS). This difference, called position error, is mainly due to inaccurate sensing of static pressure. It is usually not possible to find a position for the static ports which, at all angles of attack, accurately senses the atmospheric pressure at the altitude at which the aircraft is flying.|$|R
50|$|Only UK {{registered}} aircraft {{of up to}} four {{seats and}} with a maximum <b>indicated</b> <b>airspeed</b> (IAS) of 140 knots may be flown.|$|R

2500|$|Airspeed is {{the speed}} of an {{aircraft}} relative to the air. Among the common conventions for qualifying <b>airspeed</b> are <b>indicated</b> <b>airspeed</b> ("IAS"), calibrated airspeed ("CAS"), equivalent airspeed ("EAS"), true airspeed ("TAS"), and density <b>airspeed.</b> [...] <b>Indicated</b> <b>airspeed</b> is simply what is read off of an airspeed gauge connected to a pitot static system, calibrated <b>airspeed</b> is <b>indicated</b> <b>airspeed</b> adjusted for pitot system position and installation error, and equivalent airspeed is calibrated airspeed adjusted for compressibility effects. [...] True airspeed is equivalent airspeed adjusted for air density, and is also {{the speed of}} the aircraft through the air in which it is flying. [...] Calibrated airspeed is typically within a few knots of <b>indicated</b> <b>airspeed,</b> while equivalent airspeed decreases slightly from CAS as aircraft altitude increases or at high speeds. [...] With EAS constant, true airspeed increases as aircraft altitude increases. This is because air density decreases with higher altitude, but an aircraft's wing requires the same amount of air particles (i.e., mass of air) flowing around it to produce the same amount of lift for a given AOA; thus, a wing must move faster through thinner air than thicker air to obtain the same amount of lift.|$|R
25|$|Calibrated <b>airspeed</b> (CAS) is <b>indicated</b> <b>airspeed</b> <b>corrected</b> for {{instrument}} errors, {{position error}} (due to incorrect pressure at the static port) and installation errors.|$|R
5000|$|An aircraft's <b>indicated</b> <b>airspeed</b> {{in knots}} is {{typically}} abbreviated KIAS for [...] "Knots-Indicated Air Speed" [...] (vs. KCAS for calibrated airspeed and KTAS for true airspeed).|$|R
5000|$|The 33 FTS {{currently}} flies the T-6A [...] "Texan II" [...] {{which has}} 1100 shaft horsepower {{and a maximum}} speed of 316 KIAS (knots <b>indicated</b> <b>airspeed).</b>|$|R
5000|$|The true {{airspeed}} (TAS; also KTAS, for knots {{true airspeed}}) of an aircraft is {{the speed of}} the aircraft relative to the airmass in which it is flying. The true airspeed is important information for accurate navigation of an aircraft. Traditionally it is measured using an analogue TAS indicator, but as the Global Positioning System has become available for civilian use, the importance of such analogue instruments has decreased. Since <b>indicated</b> <b>airspeed</b> is a better indicator of power used and lift available, True airspeed is not used for controlling the aircraft during taxiing, takeoff, climb, descent, approach or landing; for these purposes the <b>Indicated</b> <b>airspeed</b> [...] - [...] IAS or KIAS (knots <b>indicated</b> <b>airspeed)</b> [...] - [...] is used. However, since <b>indicated</b> <b>airspeed</b> only shows true speed through the air at standard sea level pressure and temperature, a TAS meter is necessary for navigation purposes at cruising altitude in less dense air. The IAS meter reads very nearly the TAS at lower altitude and at lower speed. On jet airliners the TAS meter is usually hidden at speeds below 200 kn. Neither provides for accurate speed over the ground, since surface winds or winds aloft are not taken into account.|$|R
40|$|Preliminary {{results of}} one {{phase of a}} control-motion study program are {{presented}} {{in the form of}} plots of load factor. and angular acceleration against <b>indicated</b> <b>airspeed</b> and of time histories of several measured quantities. The results were obtained from 197 maneuvers performed by an F- 86 A jet-fighter airplane during normal squadron operational training. Most of the tactical maneuver 8 of which the F- 86 A is capable were performed at pressure altitudes ranging from 0 to 32, 000 feet and at <b>indicated</b> <b>airspeeds</b> ranging from 95 to 650 miles per hour...|$|R
40|$|Preliminary {{results of}} one {{phase of a}} control-motion study program {{involving}} several jet fighter-type airplanes are presented in time-history form and are summarized as maximum measured quantities plotted against <b>indicated</b> <b>airspeed.</b> The results pertain to approximately 1, 000 maneuvers performed by a Republic F- 84 G jet-fighter airplane during squadron operational training. The data include most tactical maneuvers of which the F- 84 G airplane is capable. Maneuvers were performed at pressure altitudes of 0 to 30, 000 feet with <b>indicated</b> <b>airspeeds</b> ranging from the stalling speed to approximately 515 knots...|$|R
50|$|Another version, {{dedicated}} {{to those who}} fly close air support for ground forces - REALLY close air, the following is from the prospective of flying 50 feet AGL at 400 KIAS (knots <b>indicated</b> <b>airspeed).</b>|$|R

50|$|The aircraft, {{which left}} from Posadas and {{was due to}} land in Aeroparque Jorge Newbery, Buenos Aires, was forced to divert towards Fray Bentos to avoid a storm. Examination of the aircraft's flight data {{recorder}} (FDR) revealed that shortly after the diversion occurred, the aircraft airspeed indicator began to fall to an alarmingly low <b>indicated</b> <b>airspeed.</b> Unbeknownst to the pilots, this was caused not directly, by a loss of power, but by ice formed inside the pitot tube, which reads the airspeed for the indicator by measuring the pressure of inflow air. The ice obstructing the pitot tube reduced the air inflow, thus giving an erroneously low <b>indicated</b> <b>airspeed.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The {{airspeed}} indicator shows the aircraft's speed (usually in knots [...] ) {{relative to the}} surrounding air. It works by measuring the ram-air pressure in the aircraft's Pitot tube relative to the ambient static pressure. The <b>indicated</b> <b>airspeed</b> (IAS) must be corrected for nonstandard pressure and temperature {{in order to obtain}} the true airspeed (TAS). The instrument is color coded to <b>indicate</b> important <b>airspeeds</b> such as the stall speed, never-exceed airspeed, or safe flap operation speeds.|$|R
5000|$|The {{aircraft}} flared reaching 134 Knots <b>Indicated</b> <b>Airspeed</b> (KIAS) and {{an attitude}} of 2 degrees nose-up at 32 feet above ground level (AGL), then 4 seconds later dropped the nose to 3 degrees nose-down at 133 KIAS at touchdown.|$|R

50|$|VX is the <b>indicated</b> forward <b>airspeed</b> {{for best}} angle of climb. This is {{the speed at}} which an {{aircraft}} gains the most altitude in a given horizontal distance, typically used to avoid a collision with an object a short distance away. By contrast, VY is the <b>indicated</b> <b>airspeed</b> for best rate of climb,a rate which allows the aircraft to climb to a specified altitude in the minimum amount of time regardless of the horizontal distance required. VX is always lower than VY.|$|R
40|$|Preliminary {{results of}} {{approximately}} 350 maneuvers {{of all types}} performed by a Lockheed F- 94 B jet interceptor airplane during normal operational training are presented in time-history form and are summarized as maximum load factors, control rates, angular accelerations, and sideslip angles plotted against <b>indicated</b> <b>airspeed...</b>|$|R
40|$|Calibrations of the Friez Aerovane, Wind Measuring Set AN/GMQ- 11, {{manufactured}} by the Friez Instrument Division of the Bendix Aviation Corporation, {{were made in}} the Langley 300 MPH 7 - by 10 -foot tunnel {{at the request of the}} Signal Corps, U, S.

Two propellers snd two generators were tested through a speed range of 15 to 190 knots, The results <b>indicated</b> that at <b>airspeeds</b> greater than 80 knots the instrument <b>indicated</b> <b>airspeeds</b> higher than the tunnel airspeed. ...|$|R
5000|$|In most sailplanes, {{total energy}} {{compensation}} {{is achieved by}} connecting the variometer to the atmosphere via a [...] "total energy probe", that produces vacuum proportional to {{the square of the}} glider's air speed—in effect, a negative pitot. Alternatively, the subtraction may be done electronically by the flight computer based on <b>indicated</b> <b>airspeed</b> (pitot).|$|R
5000|$|The {{airspeed}} indicator (ASI), driven by ram air into a Pitot tube and still air into a barometric static port, and shows {{what is called}} <b>indicated</b> <b>airspeed</b> (IAS). The differential pressure is affected by air density. The ratio between the two measurements is temperature-dependent and pressure-dependent, according to the ideal gas law.|$|R
50|$|In aircraft, {{the static}} {{pressure}} is generally measured using the static ports {{on the side}} of the fuselage. The dynamic pressure measured can be used to determine the <b>indicated</b> <b>airspeed</b> of the aircraft. The diaphragm arrangement described above is typically contained within the airspeed indicator, which converts the dynamic pressure to an airspeed reading by means of mechanical levers.|$|R
50|$|A {{decrease}} in {{density of air}} results in {{decrease in}} both aircraft and Engine performance. High elevation airports are characterized by low pressure and high ambient temperatures. The True Airspeed (TAS) will be higher than the <b>Indicated</b> <b>airspeed</b> <b>indicated</b> by the <b>Airspeed</b> indicator to the pilot in air of low density. This increase in TAS leads to greater touchdown speed hence increases the landing roll. More energy has to be absorbed by the brakes thus demanding the need of a longer runway. An increased density altitude means a longer landing distance.|$|R
