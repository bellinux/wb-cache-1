40|$|AbstractIn {{previously}} published papers by the authors, the specific heat energy loss per cycle (the Q parameter) {{was used to}} rationalize about 120 experimental results generated from constant amplitude, push-pull, stress- or strain-controlled fatigue tests on plain and notched hot rolled AISI 304 L stainless steel specimens {{as well as from}} <b>cold</b> <b>drawn</b> un-notched <b>bars</b> <b>of</b> the same steel, tested under fully-reversed axial or torsional fatigue loadings. It has been shown that Q can be estimated starting from the cooling gradient measured at the critical point immediately after the fatigue test has been stopped. Concerning notched specimens, it was noted that a 3 mm notch tip radius was close to the limitation of applicability of the adopted temperature sensor, consisting in 0. 127 -mm-diameter thermocouples, because of the 1. 5 -to- 2 mm diameter spot of the glue which prevented to measure the maximum temperature level. In this paper, the fatigue-damage-index effectiveness of Q parameter was investigated, carrying out fully reversed axial fatigue tests on 4 -mm-thick AISI 304 L specimens, having 3, 1 and 0. 5 mm notch tip radii. The cooling gradients were measured by using an infrared camera, characterized by a 20 μm/pixels spatial resolution. As a result, all new fatigue data could be rationalized using the same scatter band published previously by the authors...|$|R

Muller understood that the {{temperature rise}}, ∆T, in polymers at <b>cold</b> <b>drawing</b> may be significant [3 – 5]. The temperature rise for PVC was estimated from the first principles as 59 °C, and the problem looked closed. However, for PET temperature rise, ∆T was calculated as 57 °C (Toda 1994), while in experiments, substantially higher ∆T[*]=[*]T[*]−[*]T 0 [*]≈[*] 100 °C was recorded (Kechekyan et al. 1970). In addition, heating-induced fracture was observed at high drawing rates (Kechekyan et al. 1970). Melting of PET fibers near a fracture plane was observed (Hearle et al. 1998). This paper explains the mechanism of this unexpectedly high temperature rise in PET.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Polarization {{modulation}} infrared linear dichroism (PM-IRLD) and ultrarapid-scanning Fourier transform {{infrared spectroscopy}} (URS-FTIR) {{have been used}} to characterize the evolution of molecular orientation and microstructure during and following the step deformation of amorphous poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) above and below its glass transition temperature. The combined use of these techniques allowed a high sensitivity and an unprecedented 10 ms time resolution for the characterization of irreversible polymer deformation using infrared spectroscopy. PM-IRLD results show that the 1410 cm- 1 band of PET, often used as a thickness standard, presents a significant dichroism even at low draw ratios. Using this band, the relaxation kinetics of the phenyl ring was directly shown, for the first time, to be {{similar to that of the}} glycol group in amorphous PET. These results suggest that the relaxation proceeds mainly via cooperative motions involving at least one repeat unit and not only through rotations around the flexible CH 2 -CH 2 and CH 2 -O bonds. The real-time study <b>of</b> the <b>cold</b> <b>drawing</b> <b>of</b> glassy amorphous PET by URS-FTIR showed that a large gauche-to-trans conversion (from 15 % to 60 % of trans conformers) of the glycol groups occurs during the neck propagation. These trans conformers possess a very large and stable molecular orientation. Nevertheless, spectral analysis revealed that the “mesomorphic ” phase, rather than the truly (all-trans) crystalline structure, is produced during <b>cold</b> <b>drawing</b> <b>of</b> PET at room temperature...|$|R

The structure of the three-phase morphology of the {{linear low density polyethylene}} monofilaments was investigated by combining these measurements. It was found that the most important structure variation was found in the intermediate or rigid amorphous phase, whereby the amounts of crystalline and amorphous phases were nearly constant and almost independent <b>of</b> the <b>cold</b> <b>draw</b> ratio.

In the present communication, the work is extended to the production of precipitates in which departure from spherical shape is produced by <b>cold</b> <b>drawing</b> <b>of</b> suitable alloys. Magnetic measurements on the anisotropic specimens so produced are shown to give evidence for the distribution of particle shape, size and structure.

40|$|<b>Cold</b> <b>drawing</b> <b>of</b> steel wires {{leads to}} an {{increase}} of their mechanical strength and to a drop in their ductility. The increase of their mechanical strength has long been related to {{the reduction of the}} various material scales by an intense plastic deformation. Besides, it was discussed in the companion paper that large plastic deformation leads to the loss of the material hardening capabilities and that, in such a case, residual stresses preserve the elongation to failure of wires. Experimental measurements of residual stresses inside the wire have therefore been undertaken. In this paper, lattice parameters as measured using synchrotron diffraction are compared with those calculated using the residual stress fields as determined by the finite-element method. There is a major disagreement between experimental and numerical results that is too large to be attributed to the errors of the finite-element analyses. Therefore, neutron diffraction experiments have also been performed. These measurements show that there is a significant variation of the lattice parameter with the drawing level, which is not inherited from residual stresses, and that variation is very sensitive to the cooling rate after processing. It is therefore proposed that <b>cold</b> <b>drawing</b> would induce a phase transformation of the steel, possibly a martensitic transformation...|$|R

The formulae, which are valid to within an error of fourth order in sample thickness, give the tension in fibers and films as functionals of the histories of the local stretch and its first two spatial gradients. It is shown that the theory obtained by taking the formulae to be exact is consistent with thermodynamical principles. Material response for various types of histories is discussed, and the theory is employed to calculate the creep response of fibers under static loads. Numerical solutions of the evolution equation for the stretch field in creep show that for an appropriate class of materials with slowly fading memory there is a range of applied loads for which an initially homogeneous deformation evolves into a well defined neck whose edges advance at high speed along the fiber {{and in so doing}} transform moderately stretched material into highly stretched (i. e., drawn) material.
