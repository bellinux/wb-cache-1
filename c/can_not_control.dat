Bethesda announced that it was their organization, not Take-Two Interactive, that had handled the ratings application, and that they stood behind it. Bethesda would not contest the change, and would promptly seek to implement the ESRB's demands, without demanding a product recall. Nonetheless, Bethesda stated that Oblivion was not typical of Mature rated titles, and did not contain [...] "central themes of violence" [...] common to such titles. The response asserted that Bethesda's submission to the ESRB was [...] "full, accurate, and comprehensive," [...] following the forms and requirements published by the ESRB, and that nothing was withheld. Bethesda stressed that there was no nudity in their game without a modification, that the company [...] "didn't create a game with nudity" [...] and did not intend for nudity to appear in their game. [...] "Bethesda <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>control</b> tampering with Oblivion by third parties," [...] the press release concluded.|$|E
2500|$|On June 19, 2017, The New York Times in {{conjunction}} with news reporter Carmen Aristegui, and backed by Televisa news reporter Carlos Loret de Mola, reported that the Mexican Government uses a spyware software known as Pegasus, to spy on targets such as Mexican News reporters (and their families) and Civil Rights Leaders (and their families) using text messages as lures. Since 2011, the Mexican Government invested $80 million worth of spyware. Pegasus spyware infiltrates a persons cellphone and reports every detail of their messages, e-mails, contacts and calendars. After the revelation, the Israeli manufacturer of the Pegasus spyware, NSO Group, re-stated it only sold such technology to governments with an 'explicit agreement', that such technology was meant 'only to combat organized crime' by spying on it; although once it sells the software it <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>control</b> who they use it against and basically leaves the government's {{on their own to}} monitor themselves on not abusing the software. The New York Times and independent forensic analysts analyzed the data of 'dozens of messages', multiple times before proving their accusation, and commented of such espionage towards news journalists and civil rights leaders, as 'an effort from the Mexican Government to thwart the battle against corruption infecting every limb of Mexican Society', and how highly unlikely it would be for such espionage it to receive 'Judicial Approval'. Edward Snowden who worked for US government's NSA before revealing it to spy on its citizens, also said all evidence points to the Mexican government being the spy, and on twitter said it is [...] "a crime to the public".|$|E

6000|$|It would seem, {{from all}} {{study of the}} {{essentials}} of money (Book [...] III, Chapter IV), that the necessary part {{of the idea of}} money is [...] that it should have value in itself. No one parts with valuable [...] commodities for a medium of exchange which does not possess value; [...] and we have seen that Legislatures <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>control</b> the natural [...] value of even the precious metals by giving them legal-tender [...] power. Much less could it be done for paper money. Paper, [...] therefore, may, as an instrument of credit, be a substitute for [...] money; but, in accordance with the above test, it can not properly [...] be considered as money in the full sense. Of course, paper money, [...] checks, etc., perform some of the functions of money equally well [...] with the precious metals. F. A.
