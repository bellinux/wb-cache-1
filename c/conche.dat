2500|$|The {{penultimate}} {{process is}} called conching. A <b>conche</b> is a container filled with metal beads, which act as grinders. The refined and blended chocolate mass {{is kept in}} a liquid state by frictional heat. Chocolate prior to conching has an uneven and gritty texture. The conching process produces cocoa and sugar particles smaller than the tongue can detect, hence the smooth feel in the mouth. The length of the conching process determines the final smoothness {{and quality of the}} chocolate. High-quality chocolate is conched for about 72hours, and lesser grades about four to six hours. After the process is complete, the chocolate mass is stored in tanks heated to about [...] until final processing.|$|E
5000|$|The {{composition}} of Belgian chocolate has been regulated by law since 1894 when, {{in order to}} prevent adulteration of the chocolate with low-quality fats from other sources, a minimum level of 35 percent pure cocoa was imposed. Attempts to introduce industry standardisation have met with little success. An attempt by the European Economic Community (EEC) to introducing minimum standards of the amount of cocoa butter substitutes across Europe led to prolonged negotiation but the legislation finally enacted, in 2003, was viewed as excessively lenient in Belgium. In 2007, a voluntary quality standard (to which about 90 percent of the country's chocolate makers adhere) was introduced by the European Union which set certain criteria for a product to be considered [...] "Belgian chocolate". Under this [...] "Belgian Chocolate Code", refining, mixing and <b>concheing</b> must be done inside Belgium.|$|R

5000|$|According to D.W. Prowse (1895) <b>Conche</b> harbor was {{the scene}} of an {{encounter}} between British warships and French fishing in 1702. H.A. Innis (1940) suggests that both French and English fishing fleets used <b>Conche</b> for at least a century before the French employed some English settlers to remain permanently as gardiens. Patrick O'Neill ( [...] n.d.) relates that, according to oral history, no French came to <b>Conche</b> during the Napoleonic War and that several men from southern Newfoundland came built summer fishing rooms in <b>Conche.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Conche</b> {{is located}} on the {{sheltered}} southwest side of a small bay formed by the south side of a T-shaped peninsula, called the <b>Conche</b> Peninsula, which is joined to the mainland by a short, slender isthmus. Although the area is mostly steep cliffs, settlement is concentrated on gentle sheltered slopes and in the small covers north and south of the isthmus.. The settlement to the immediate north of the isthmus was Cape Rouge qv (later Northeast and Southwest Crouse). The community of <b>Conche</b> is that central and western area south of the isthmus which includes Stage Cove. According to E.R. Seary (1960) <b>Conche</b> was mention on a map, published in 1613, that was based on Champlain's voyage of 1612, and Seary speculates that the name <b>Conche</b> is possibly derived from the French family Chibon or Chiban, or from the placename Conches, and abbey in Normandy. <b>Conche</b> was also La Couche in fisheries reports in the 1850s and 1860s.|$|E

5000|$|Innis {{states that}} in 1764 <b>Conche</b> {{sheltered}} three British ships, 164 men and twenty-three boats, while the French Occupied Cape Rouge. In 1786 <b>Conche</b> and Cape Rouge were the ports of twenty-two French ships and 2,040 fishing servants of the Granvillais, {{and there were}} apparently complaints of Indian disturbances. Innis states that in 1787-88, the Slade ledgers of Battle Harbour showed Thomas Riggs, John Jilsed (should be Tilsed, see note below), William Griffin, Ben Brooke, William Cake, James Warne, William Wherry, James Vincent, William Enos, Matthew Legg were fisherman based in <b>Conche,</b> while in 1792 Twelve French ships were reportedly based in <b>Conche</b> (H.A. Innis: 1940).From 1713 to 1904 <b>Conche</b> came within the boundary of the *French Shore qv, and with Croque, Quirpon, Englee, La Scie and Fleur de Lys {{it was a major}} site of French Shore fishing activities. As such, the need for gardiens (year round in-habitants engaged by the French to protect their gear and premises in the winter) arose and by 1800 at least one family had settled at <b>Conche.</b> According to John Dower (aged 38 in 1859), his father James herbert Dower, was [...] "the first man who came to <b>Conche,</b> I believe, about sixty years ago or more that is, c.1790... for some years he was about the only person.

5000|$|Conching redistributes the {{substances}} {{from the}} dry cocoa that create flavor into the fat phase. Air {{flowing through the}} <b>conche</b> removes some unwanted acetic, propionic, and butyric acids from the chocolate and reduces moisture. A small amount of moisture greatly increases viscosity of the finished chocolate so machinery is cleaned with cocoa butter instead of water. Some of the substances produced in roasting of cocoa beans are oxidized in the <b>conche,</b> mellowing {{the flavor of the}} product.|$|E

5000|$|By 1857 {{the first}} census of the {{community}} listed 101 inhabitants (sixteen families), all Irish Roman Catholics, but the settlement was much larger during the French fishing season. In 1858 <b>Conche</b> had nine areas assigned to the French: these had a population of 244 migratory French fishermen, {{and it was one}} of fifty-one harbours which had a Roman Catholic Chapel [...] "erected ...by the French Captaine" [...] which was visited by a priest who lived at Cape Rouge. According to O'Neill a Captain Alano operated a large room on a point which still bears his name, and that the priest and chapel were attached to this room, which was later the site of a Roman Catholic church built by the permanent residents of <b>Conche.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Lindt's {{original}} <b>conche</b> {{consisted of}} a granite roller and granite trough; such a configuration is now called a [...] "long conche" [...] and can {{take more than a}} day to process a tonne of chocolate. The ends of the trough were shaped to allow the chocolate to be thrown back over the roller {{at the end of each}} stroke, increasing the surface area exposed to air. A modern rotary <b>conche</b> can process 3 to 10 tonnes of chocolate in less than 12 hours. Modern conches have cooled jacketed vessels containing long mixer shafts with radial arms that press the chocolate against vessel sides. A single machine can carry out all the steps of grinding, mixing, and conching required for small batches of chocolate.|$|E
5000|$|The {{temperature}} of the <b>conche</b> is controlled and varies for different types of chocolate. Generally higher temperature leads to a shorter required processing time. Temperature varies from around 49 C for milk chocolate to up to 82 C for dark chocolate. The elevated temperature leads to a partially caramelized flavor and in milk chocolate promotes the Maillard reaction. [...] The chocolate passes through three phases during conching. In the dry phase the material is in powdery form, and the mixing coats the particles with fat. Air movement through the <b>conche</b> removes some moisture and volatile substances, which may give an acidic note to the flavor. Moisture balance affects the flavor and texture of the finished product because, after the particles are coated with fat, moisture and volatile chemicals {{are less likely to}} escape.|$|E
5000|$|Relations {{between the}} French and Irish {{settlers}} were ambivalent. The settlers served as protectors of the French property and George Casey reports {{that many of}} them were bilingual. The population grew rapidly and by 1867 a school was reported operating in <b>Conche.</b> Although there were concurrent fishing rights on the French Shore, the settlers, who were allowed to settle at <b>Conche</b> by the French, complained frequently that the French infringed on their lucrative salmon fishery. The French Admirals repeatedly warned the gardiens about their incursions into French fishing territory and English captains frequently investigated complaints and incidents on behalf of both parties. A typical report was a Captain Hamilton's dispatch in July 1864: at <b>Conche</b> he inquired about Facey, a settler son had interfered with French cod seines. and about another settler named Bromley whose stages extensions interfered with the French rooms. The captain concluded that [...] "This is the only place I have visited where a really ill-feeling exists between English and French, owing in a great measure to the English being prevented from putting down salmon nets, it being an excellent salmon post". Incidents continued although they seemed minor enough: In 1875, the captain of a French brig complained that John Casey and other inhabitants had [...] "stripped" [...] his ship; however the investigating British officer concluded [...] "on the whole I believe, the fisherman of the two nations get on well together". In 1876 it was reported that the last French fishing rooms had been abandoned in 1867, however, the French based at La Scie continued to fish in the area, mainly cod, squid and herring, while by 1874 the 180 <b>Conche</b> settlers had exclusive use of the harbour from which they continued to prosecute the lucrative salmon fishery. It was reported that [...] "Conche is a great bay for salmon, and as the French do not interfere, it is the principal fishery.... The total catch was quoted ... at from two hundred to two thousand barrels". Settlers listed at this time were Joy, Kenney, Casey, Pine, Carroll, Kearsey, Hunt, Dower, Fitzpatrick, Ralph, Byrne, Linfield, Bromley, Martin, Flinn, and Flynn. Later settlers included the Hunt, O'Neill, Carey, (Carew), Emberly and Whalen families. By 1901 the population stood at 298 and by 1945 it had risen to 482. In 1963 eighty-four people in nine families resettled in <b>Conche</b> from the Gray Islands qv and by 1966 the population was reported to be 624.|$|E

5000|$|The {{first school}} in <b>Conche</b> was {{established}} about 1860 {{but it was}} 1890 before education was provided on a continual basis, this after a schoolhouse was built {{with the aid of}} a government grant in 1883. In that year the Roman Catholic School inspector reported, [...] "A new school house is course of erection... The school here had been taught in a private house; $80 was given in aid. A young girl belonging to the place is attending the Convent School at Pictow, N.S., to qualify her to take charge of the school. New schools were built c. 1904,1943, and finally 1971. A telegraph office was established in 1912 and a nursing station opened in 1960. The community was supplied by coastal boat until the building of the road to <b>Conche</b> in 1969, and from 1960 to 1974 a 305 m (1000 ft.) gravel airstrip was in operation. In 1978 the United Maritime Fishermen opened a fish plant, which employed twenty people (fity-six at peak) producing processed cod, salmon and herring which was exported to mainland Canada and the United States. In 1981 there was a government wharf and a community stage built in <b>Conche</b> as well as numerous other private wharves. The settlement had a post office, a nursing station, a modern Roman Catholic Church, and a school which served students from Kindergarten to Grade Eleven.
