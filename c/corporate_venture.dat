Likewise the study of <b>corporate</b> <b>venturing</b> is becoming a focus of interest within the US research community. Researchers have recognised the links between <b>corporate</b> <b>ventures</b> and profitability (Zahra, 1991), the effects of ventures on strategic renewal (Guth and Ginsberg, 1990), on fostering innovation (Baden-Fuller, 1995) and on gaining future revenue streams (McGrath, Venkataraman and MacMillan, 1994).

40|$|The paper {{analyzes}} {{how and why}} {{a parent}} firm continues to nurture non-strategic spin-off ventures. The question is addressed in {{a case study of}} a <b>corporate</b> <b>venturing</b> unit of a large technology-based firm in Sweden. Interviews were carried out with executives in the parent firm, the <b>corporate</b> <b>venturing</b> unit and in spin-off ventures. A striking feature of this <b>corporate</b> <b>venturing</b> organization is the continuing investment in spin-off ventures, which the parent organization explicitly regards as non-core. We investigate the spin-off process to find possible explanations for this non-intuitive behavior. We develop a model based on the increasing costs to decrease information asymmetries between the <b>corporate</b> <b>venturing</b> unit and external actors when more resources are devoted to the nascent venture. The model illustrates the competitive advantage of the <b>corporate</b> <b>venturing</b> unit in the early-stage development of internal ventures. We argue that a <b>corporate</b> <b>venturing</b> unit can gain strategic benefits by developing and supporting non-strategic ventures at low cost and low risk by functioning as a strategic trashcan, {{while at the same time}} providing direct financial return from the spin-off ventures. Although the venture is non-core, the parent firm has an informational advantage about its value, but needs to further develop the venture for subsequent sale. The results indicate that the challenge for parent firms is to estimate when they no longer can profit from the information asymmetry, i. e. when the cost for further venture development has reached some critical level. The analysis illustrates how a low-cost/low-risk <b>corporate</b> <b>venturing</b> strategy can force the <b>corporate</b> <b>venturing</b> unit to guesstimate this point. In relation to this, we suggest an explanation of sponsored spin-offs where the parent firm retains partial ownership as an emergent phenomenon, caused by relatively simple environmental restrictions (low cost/low risk), rather than a carefully planned-for strategy...|$|R

40|$|Seven “Corporate Venturing” Strategies to Foster Innovation tackles the question: What should {{companies}} do to accelerate innovation and remain relevant?

One answer is <b>corporate</b> <b>venturing.</b> <b>Corporate</b> <b>venturing</b> is often understood as a corporation making an investment in external startups either directly (off the balance sheet through a <b>corporate</b> <b>venturing</b> unit) or indirectly (through a venture capital fund) for strategic and/or financial gain.

5000|$|Utilities have {{traditionally}} been businesses where the customer is the regulator rather than the rate-payer using the service.

40|$|Despite {{the rapid}} change in today's {{business}} environment there are relatively few studies about corporate renewal. This study aims {{for its part}} at filling that research gap by studying the concepts of strategy, corporate renewal, innovation and <b>corporate</b> <b>venturing.</b> Its purpose is to enhance {{our understanding of how}} established companies operating in dynamic and global environment can benefit from their <b>corporate</b> <b>venturing</b> activities. The theoretical part approaches the research problem in <b>corporate</b> and <b>venture</b> levels. Firstly, it focuses on mapping the determinants of strategy and suggests using industry, location, resources, knowledge, structure and culture, market, technology and business model to assess the environment and using these determinants to optimize speed and magnitude of change. Secondly, it concludes that the choice of innovation strategy is dependent on the type and dimensions of innovation and suggests assessing market, technology, business model as well as novelty and complexity related to each of them for choosing an optimal context for developing innovations further. Thirdly, it directsattention on processes through which corporate renewal takes place. On corporate level these processes are identified as strategy formulation, strategy formation and strategy implementation. On the venture level the renewal processes are identified as learning, leveraging and nesting. The theoretical contribution of this study, the framework of strategic <b>corporate</b> <b>venturing,</b> joins <b>corporate</b> and <b>venture</b> level management issues together and concludes that strategy processes and linking processes are the mechanism through which continuous corporate renewaltakes place. The framework of strategic <b>corporate</b> <b>venturing</b> proposed by this study is a new way to illustrate the role of <b>corporate</b> <b>venturing</b> as a purposefullybuilt, different view of a company's business environment. The empirical part extended the framework by enhancing our understanding of the link between corporate renewal and <b>corporate</b> <b>venturing</b> in its real life environment in three Finnish companies: Metso, Nokia and TeliaSonera. Characterizing companies' environmentwith the determinants of strategy identified in this study provided a structured way to analyze their competitive position and renewal challenges that they arefacing. More importantly the case studies confirmed that a link between corporate renewal and <b>corporate</b> <b>venturing</b> exists and found out that the link is not as straight forward as indicated by the theory. Furthermore, the case studies enhanced the framework by indicating a sequence according to which the processes work. Firstly, the induced strategy processes strategy formulation and strategy implementation set the scene for <b>corporate</b> <b>venturing</b> context and management processes and leave strategy formation for the venture. Only after that can strategies formed by ventures come back to the corporate level - and if found viable in the corporate level be formalized through formulation and implementation. With the help of the framework of strategic <b>corporate</b> <b>venturing</b> the link between corporaterenewal and <b>corporate</b> <b>venturing</b> can be found and managed. The suggested response to the continuous need for change is continuous renewal i. e. institutionalizing corporate renewal in the strategy processes of the company. As far as benefiting from venturing is concerned the answer lies in deliberately managing venturing in a context different to the mainstream businesses and establishing efficientlinking processes to exploit the renewal potential of individual ventures...|$|R
