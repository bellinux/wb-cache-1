5|$|A {{majority}} of multinational corporations find their origins in First World <b>countries.</b> After {{the fall of}} communism, multinational corporations proliferated as more <b>countries</b> focused on global trade. The series of General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) and later the World Trade Organization (WTO) essentially ended the protectionist measures that were dissuading global trade. The eradication of these protectionist measures, while creating avenues for economic interconnection, mostly benefited developed <b>countries,</b> who by using their power at GATT summits, forced developing and underdeveloped <b>countries</b> to open their economies to Western goods.|$|E
5|$|After World War II, {{the world}} {{split into two}} large geopolitical blocs, {{separating}} into spheres of communism and capitalism. This led to the Cold War, during which the term First World was often used because of its political, social, and economic relevance. The term itself was first introduced in the late 1940s by the United Nations. Today, the First World is slightly outdated and has no official definition, however, it is generally {{thought of as the}} capitalist, industrial, wealthy and developed <b>countries.</b> This definition includes Australia & New Zealand, the developed <b>countries</b> of Asia (South Korea, Taiwan, Japan, Singapore) and the wealthy <b>countries</b> of North America and Europe, particularly Western Europe. In contemporary society, the First World is viewed as <b>countries</b> that have the most advanced economies, the greatest influence, the highest standards of living, and the greatest technology. After the Cold War, these <b>countries</b> of the First World included member states of NATO, U.S.-aligned states, neutral <b>countries</b> that were developed and industrialized, and the former British Colonies that were considered developed. It can be defined succinctly as Europe, plus the richer <b>countries</b> of the former British Empire (USA, Canada, Australia, Singapore, New Zealand), Israel, Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan.|$|E

5|$|Although {{regulation}} reducing lead {{in products}} has greatly reduced exposure {{in the developed}} world since the 1970s, lead is still allowed in products in many developing <b>countries.</b> In all <b>countries</b> that have banned leaded gasoline, average blood lead levels have fallen sharply. However, some developing <b>countries</b> still allow leaded gasoline, which is the primary source of lead exposure in most developing <b>countries.</b> Beyond exposure from gasoline, the frequent use of pesticides in developing <b>countries</b> adds a risk of lead exposure and subsequent poisoning. Poor children in developing <b>countries</b> are at especially high risk for lead poisoning. Of North American children, 7% have blood lead levels above 10 μg/dL, whereas among Central and South American children, the percentage is 33 to 34%. About one fifth of the world's disease burden from lead poisoning occurs in the Western Pacific, and another fifth is in Southeast Asia.|$|E

5|$|Currency war, {{also known}} as {{competitive}} devaluations, is a condition in international affairs where <b>countries</b> seek to gain a trade advantage over other <b>countries</b> by causing the exchange rate of their currency to fall {{in relation to other}} currencies. As the exchange rate of a country's currency falls exports become more competitive in other <b>countries,</b> and imports into the country become more expensive. Both effects benefit the domestic industry, and thus employment, which receives a boost in demand from both domestic and foreign markets. However, the price increases for import goods (as well as in the cost of foreign travel) are unpopular as they harm citizens' purchasing power; and when all <b>countries</b> adopt a similar strategy, it can lead to a general decline in international trade, harming all <b>countries.</b>|$|E

5|$|Despite {{sovereign}} debt having risen substantially {{in only a}} few eurozone <b>countries,</b> with the three most affected <b>countries</b> Greece, Ireland and Portugal collectively only accounting for 6% of the eurozone's gross domestic product (GDP), it has become a perceived problem for the area as a whole, leading to speculation of further contagion of other European <b>countries</b> and a possible break-up of the eurozone.

5|$|For many net oil {{importing}} <b>countries</b> the 2000s {{energy crisis}} brought back concerns first raised during the 1973 oil crisis. For the United States, the other developed <b>countries</b> and emerging <b>countries</b> {{their dependence on}} foreign oil has revived concerns about their vulnerability to price shocks and supply disruption. Also, there have been concerns about the uncertainty surrounding peak oil production and the higher cost of extracting unconventional oil. A third issue that has been raised is the threat to national security because most proven oil reserves are concentrated in relatively few geographic locations, including some <b>countries</b> with strong resource nationalism, unstable governments or hostile to U.S. interests. In addition, for many developing <b>countries,</b> and particularly for the poorest African <b>countries,</b> high oil prices have an adverse impact on the government budget and deteriorate their terms of trade thus jeopardizing their balance of payments, all leading to lower economic growth.|$|E
