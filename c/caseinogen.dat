50|$|Unlike many proteins, casein is not coagulated by heat. During {{the process}} of clotting, milk-clotting proteases act on the soluble portion of the caseins, κ-casein, thus {{originating}} an unstable micellar state that results in clot formation. When coagulated with chymosin, casein is sometimes called paracasein. Chymosin (EC 3.4.23.4) is an aspartic protease that specifically hydrolyzes the peptide bond in Phe105-Met106 of κ-casein, and {{is considered to be}} the most efficient protease for the cheese-making industry (Rao et al., 1998). British terminology, on the other hand, uses the term <b>caseinogen</b> for the uncoagulated protein and casein for the coagulated protein. As it exists in milk, it is a salt of calcium.|$|E
40|$|Trypanosomiasis is an {{important}} livestock disease in sub-Saharan Africa. Improvement on host’s nutrition is important in moderating the severity of pathophysiological effect of trypanosomiasis and it also influences the rate of recovery. Earlier researchers demonstrated that dietary supplement of selenium and vitamin E enhanced immune response in white rats. It has also been reported that during pregnancy, immune response is depressed. Leucocytes count has been recognized {{as a measure of}} immune response. This research was therefore conducted using chicks’ marsh fortified with 80 mg of vitamin E and 0. 3 mg of seleni um as control (Diet 1) to determine the effect of dietary supplementati on of moderate protein (combination of 250 g of corn meal, 240 g soyabean meal and 10 g of crayfish) in the chicks ’ mash (Diet 2), high dietary protein (combination of 400 g of <b>caseinogen</b> and 300 g o f soyabean meal) (Diet 3), and high dietary carbohydrate (combination of 400 g dextrose and 300 g cornmeal) (Diet 4) in the chicks ’ mash on the white blood cells count and differential leucocytes count of trypanosome-infected pregnant rats. Dies 1 – 4 were given to rats in Cage A – D, respectively. The rats were i nfected with trypanosomes withi...|$|E
40|$|Trypanosomiasis is {{of great}} {{interest}} to farmers in Sub-Saharan Africa. It is a disease that retards agricultural development in general and needs urgent attention. It has been noted that it causes aneamia in its host which often may lead to death. Many researches showed that dietary supplement can enhance trypanotolerance in various hosts. Diet is important in modulating the severity of its pathophysiological effects and can also influence the rate of recovery. Using a control diet (Diet 1)) was only chicks ’ mash. this research was conducted to determine the effect of moderate protein (mixture of 250 g of corn meal, 240 g of soyabean meal and 10 g of crayfish meal in chicks ’ marsh (Diet 2)), high dietary protein (mixture o f 400 g o f <b>caseinogen</b> and 300 g o f soyabean meal in chicks ’ mash (Diet 3)) and high dietary carbohydrate (mixture of 400 g of dextrose and 300 g of corn meal in chicks ’ mash (Diet 4)) supplementation on rodent trypanomiasis. Di et 1 was used to feed rats in Cage A, Diet 2 was used to feed rats in Cage B, Diet 3 was used to feed rats in Cage C while Diet 4 was used to feed rats in Cage D. At the end of the experiment, it was observed that rats fed with Diet 2 (moderate protein diet) had the highest and significantly different (P < 0. 05) red blood cell count than other treatments. This indicated that adequate nutrition reduces the effect of trypanosome and hence trypanotolerance in rats since trypanosome is known to attack red blood cells and vascular endothelium...|$|E
