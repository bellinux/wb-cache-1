5|$|The {{first modern}} {{population}} census {{in the country}} was conducted in 1857, and 15 more have been performed since then. Since 1961 the censuses are conducted in regular ten-year intervals, with the latest one in 2011. The first institution {{set up in the}} country specifically for the purposes of maintaining population statistics was the State Statistical Office, founded in 1875. Since its founding, the office changed its name and structure several times and was alternately subordinated to other institutions and independent, until the most recent changes in 1992, when the institution became the Croatian Bureau of Statistics. The 2011 census was performed on 1–28 April 2011, recording situation as of 31 March 2011. The first census results, containing the number of the population by settlement, were published on 29 June 2011, and the final comprehensive set of data was published in December 2012. The 2011 census and processing of the data gathered by the census was expected to cost 171.9million kuna (23.3million euro). The 2011 census was performed using new methodology: the permanent population was determined as the enumerated population who lived in the <b>census</b> <b>area</b> for at least 12 months prior to the census, or plans to live in the same area for at least 12 months after the census. This method was also retroactively applied to the 2001 census data.|$|E

40|$|This article {{describes}} the development and application of a modified grouping genetic algorithm (GGA) used to identify sets of optimal ambulance locations. The GGA was modified to consider a special case with only two groups, and the reproduction and mutation schemes were modified to operate more efficiently. It was applied to a case study locating ambulances from a fixed set of alternative locations. The sites were evaluated using data of emergency medical services (EMS) calls summarised over <b>census</b> <b>areas</b> and weighted by network distance. <b>Census</b> <b>areas</b> serviced by the same selected location defined ambulance catchments. The results indicated alternative sites for ambulances to be located, with average EMS response times improved by 1 min 14 s, and showed the impacts of having different numbers of ambulances in current locations and in new locations. The algorithmic developments associated with the modified GGA and the advantages of using <b>census</b> <b>areas</b> as spatial units to summarise data are discussed.
