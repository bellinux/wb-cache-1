25|$|Establishing {{a school}} in Oxford Street, Nicholson taught mathematics, architecture, {{surveying}} and building technology, and he continued to develop the centrolinead, in recognition of which he received the Gold Isis Medal and the sum of 20 shillings from the Society for the Encouragement of the Useful Arts in 1814, and a Silver Medal in 1815. In c. 1816 he sat for portrait artist James Green, the painting being donated to the National Portrait Gallery in London in 1961. The period between 1810 and 1829, during which Nicholson lived in London, was his most prolific as an author. During this time he published Mechanical Exercises (1812), The Builder and Workman's New Director (1822), and The Architectural Dictionary, in two volumes (1812 and 1819). This work was considered {{the most important of}} the numerous works that were to make his reputation as a national authority on building technology {{at a time when the}} building industry was changing rapidly under the influence of scientific research. In addition to practical books relating to building and architecture, Nicholson also wrote about purely scientific, and sometimes rather esoteric subjects. His Treatise on Practical Perspective (1815) included a discussion and full instructions on the use of the centrolinead, while his mathematical works included such titles as An Introduction to the Method of Increments (1817), Essays on the <b>Combinatorial</b> <b>Analysis</b> (1818), and The Rudiments of Algebra (1819). His Essay on Involution and Evolution (1820) earned him the commendation of the Académie des Sciences in Paris. In 1826, at the age of 61, Nicholson visited France and, by the time of his return, had gained sufficient familiarity with the language to be able to translate books on various mathematical subjects. The following year, he began work on an ambitious project entitled The School of Architecture and Engineering, intending to complete it in 12 affordable volumes, costing just 1s 6d each, but he was forced to abandon the work when the publisher, J. and C. Adlard of London was declared bankrupt and only five volumes were ever produced, this being the only project he left unfinished. Suffering a heavy financial loss himself, and in order to economise, Nicholson left London for Morpeth in Northumberland in 1829, where he lived in a small property left to him by a relative. In the meantime, he published A Popular and Practical Treatise on Masonry and Stone-cutting (1828), in which he solved the problem of cutting stones to the pecise shapes required for the construction of a strong skew arch and presented his solution in a form that was useful to other engineers and stonemasons, enabling the stones to be prepared from s at the quarry in advance of the actual construction of the bridge.|$|E

Combinatorial game theory [Berlekamp et al. 1982] applies particularly well to Konane {{because the first}} player unable to move loses and because a game often {{can be divided into}} independent subgames whose outcomes can be combined to determine the outcome of the entire game.

40|$|This volume {{presents}} the proccedings of the 11 th International Workshop on <b>Combinatorial</b> Image <b>Analysis.</b> IWCIA 2006 was the 11 th {{in a series}} of international workshopfs devoted to <b>combinatorial</b> image <b>analysis.</b> Prior meetings took place in Paris (France 1991), Ube (Japan 1992), Wahington DC (USA 1994), Lyon (France 1995), Hiroshima (Japan 1997), Madras (India 1999), Philadelphia (USA 2001), Palermo (Italy 2003) and Auckland (New Zealand 2004). For this workshop we received 59 papers from all over the world. Each paper was assigned to three independent referees and carefully revised. Finally, we selected 34 papers for the conference based on content, significance, relevance, and presentation. Conference papers are presented in this volume in the order they were presented at the conference. The topics of the conference covered <b>combinatorial</b> image <b>analysis,</b> grammars and models for analysis and recognition of scenes or images, combinatorial topology and geometry for images, digital geometry of curves or surfaces, algebraic approaches to image processing, image, point-clouds or surface registration as well as fuzzy and probabilistic image analysis. The programm followed a single-track format with presentations of all published conference papers. Non-overlapping oral and poster sessions ensured that all attendees had opportunities to interact personny with presenters. Among the highlights of the meeting were the talks of our two invited speakers, renowned experts in the field of descrete geometry, digital topology, and image analysis. - David Coeurjolly (University of Lyon, France) : Computational Aspects of Digital Plane and Hyperplane Recognition - Longin Jan Latecki (Temple University, Philadelphia, USA) : Polygonal Approximation of Point Sets. ...|$|R

40|$|A {{number of}} model-based scaling {{methods have been}} {{developed}} that apply to asymmetric proximity matrices. A flexible data analysis approach is proposed that combines two psychometric procedures-seriation and multidimensional scaling (MDS). The method uses seriation to define an empirical ordering of the stimuli, and then uses MDS to scale the two separate triangles of the proximity matrix defined by this ordering. The MDS solution contains directed distances, which define an "extra" dimension that would not otherwise be portrayed, because the dimension comes from {{relations between the two}} triangles rather than within triangles. The method is particularly appropriate for the analysis of proximities containing temporal information. A major difficulty is the computational intensity of existing seriation algorithms, which is handled by defining a nonmetric seriation algorithm that requires only one complete iteration. The procedure is illustrated using a matrix of co-citations between recent presidents of the Psychometric Society.

We show that different versions of the problem are APX-hard even for instances with two sequences. Moreover, we show that the related problem of determining the existence of a feasible solution of the Exemplar Longest Common Subsequence of two sequences is NP-hard. On the positive side, we first present an efficient algorithm for the ELCS problem over instances of two sequences where each mandatory symbol can appear in total at most three times in the sequences. Furthermore, we present two fixed parameter algorithms for the ELCS problem over instances of two sequences where the parameter is the number of mandatory symbols.
