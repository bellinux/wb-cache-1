2500|$|The <b>critical</b> <b>frequency</b> is the {{limiting}} frequency {{at or below}} which a radio wave is reflected by an ionospheric layer at vertical incidence.

2500|$|Ionograms {{show the}} virtual heights and {{critical}} frequencies of the ionospheric layers {{and which are}} measured by an ionosonde. An ionosonde sweeps a range of frequencies, usually from 0.1 to 30nbsp&MHz, transmitting at vertical incidence to the ionosphere. As the frequency increases, each wave is refracted less by the ionization in the layer, and so each penetrates further before it is reflected. Eventually, a frequency is reached that enables the wave to penetrate the layer without being reflected. For ordinary mode waves, this occurs when the transmitted frequency just exceeds the peak plasma, or <b>critical,</b> <b>frequency</b> of the layer. Tracings of the reflected high frequency radio pulses are known as ionograms.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Measurement {{of central}} <b>critical</b> flicker-fusion <b>frequency</b> {{is a common}} {{screening}} test for eye diseases and additionally it {{can serve as a}} useful diagnostic test in numerous neurological and internal diseases. The test might also be used for monitoring purposes. AIM: The aim of the authors was to evaluate a digital central <b>critical</b> flicker-fusion <b>frequency</b> measuring device (IMEA ADR III) in 30 young, healthy Hungarian subjects. METHOD: After a general ophthalmological screening examination, monocular central <b>critical</b> flicker-fusion <b>frequency</b> was measured with four colours. Measurements were carried out on two separate days in three sessions under standardized conditions. Intrasession, intersession and intervisit variabilities, differences in central <b>critical</b> flicker-fusion <b>frequency</b> using the four colours and the effect of certain other influencing factors were determined. RESULTS: There were no statistically significant differences between sessions in the mean and standard deviation of the measurement sets. The central <b>critical</b> flicker-fusion <b>frequency</b> threshold for red colour was significantly lower than for other colours, and the threshold for blue colour was significantly lower than for green. There were no significant differences regarding sex, age, iris colour, and smoking indicating that these factors did not influence the central <b>critical</b> flicker-fusion <b>frequency</b> threshold in these subjects. CONCLUSIONS: Measurement results with the device are reliable and reproducible in healthy, young population in separate sessions. Orv. Hetil., 2016, 157 (27), 1079 - 1086...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. There is lot {{of effort}} to find {{suitable}} measures of interesting-ness of association rules. The most known measures are confidence and support but {{there are tens of}} additional ones. Each association measure can be understood as a function of four independent variables. These variables correspond to frequencies from a fourfold contingency table of antecedent and succedent. A natural way to investigate functions is to study their graphs. However it is hard to deal with graphs of functions of four independent variables; thus graphs are generally not suitable to study association measures. We show that tables of <b>critical</b> <b>frequencies</b> can be used to overcome this difficulty for some important classes of association measures. We give an overview of important classes of asso-ciation measures and then we show how the graphs of tables of <b>critical</b> <b>frequencies</b> describe behavior of corresponding association measures in a reasonable way. ...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} the {{implementation}} of the mathematical model for rotor free oscillations of centrifugal machines is considered {{with the use of the}} computer program “Critical frequencies of the rotor”. The advantage of the program is the possibility of taking into account any advance given analytic dependence of support and seal stiffness on the rotor speed. As a result of numerical calculation on the example of the multistage centrifugal compressor 295 GTS 2 - 190 / 44 - 100 M eigenfrequencies, <b>critical</b> <b>frequencies</b> and corresponding mode shapes are defined. The credibility of the proposed mathematical model is confirmed by theorem of the mutual position for spectrum of eigenfrequencies and correspondent <b>critical</b> <b>frequencies,</b> as well as by comparing the results of dynamic calculation in the program “Critical frequencies of the rotor” with the results of numerical simulation in ANSYS using the 3 D finite element model and drawing the Campbell diagram...|$|R

The two resonators reduce to an inductor and a capacitor respectively. The number of antiresonators reduces to two.If, however, ω∞1 is set to zero (that is, there is no pole of attenuation in the lower stopband) and ω∞2 is set to correspond to the upper <b>critical</b> <b>frequency</b> ωc1, then a particularly simple form of the {{bandpass filter}} is obtained consisting of just antiresonators coupled by capacitors. This was a popular topology for multi-section band-pass filters due its low component count, particularly of inductors.
