40|$|Abstract Avian brood parasites {{depend on}} other species, the hosts, {{to raise their}} offspring. During the {{breeding}} sea-son, parasitic cowbirds (Molothrus sp.) search for poten-tial host nests to which they return for laying {{a few days after}} first locating them. Parasitic cowbirds have a larger hippocampus/telencephalon volume than non-parasitic species; this volume is larger in the sex involved in nest searching (females) and it is also larger in the breeding than in the non-breeding season. In nature, female shiny cowbirds Molothrus bonariensis search for nests without the male’s assistance. Here we test whether, in association with these neuroanatomical and behavioural differences, shiny cowbirds display sexual differences in a memory task in the laboratory. We used a task consisting of finding food whose location was indicated either by the appear-ance or the location of a <b>covering</b> <b>disk.</b> Females learnt to retrieve food faster than males when food was associated with appearance cues, but we found no sexual differences when food was associated with a specific location. Our re-sults are consistent with the view that parasitism and its neuroanatomical correlates affect performance in memory tasks, but the effects we found were not in the expected direction, emphasising that the nature of avian hippocampal function and its sexual differences are not yet understood.

40|$|For a {{convex body}} C in R d, {{what is the}} {{smallest}} number f = fd(C) such that any sequence of smaller homothetic copies of C whose total volume is at least f times the volume of C permits a translative covering of C? László Fejes Tóth conjectured in 1984 that f 2 (C) ≤ 3 for any convex body C in the plane. This conjecture has been only confirmed for parallelograms and triangles: Moon and Moser had shown in 1967 that f 2 (C) = 3 for a square C. Since fd(C) is invariant under affine transformation of C, it follows from Moon and Moser’s result that f 2 (C) = 3 for any parallelogram C. In 2003, Füredi settled the case of triangles with a sharper bound, by showing that f 2 (C) = 2 for a triangle C, and thus confirming a stronger conjecture of A. Bezdek and K. Bezdek for this case. For an arbitrary planar convex body C, the current best bound is f 2 (C) ≤ 6. 5, due to Januszewski. In this paper, we prove that f 2 (D) < 3 for a disk D, and thereby confirm the conjecture of László Fejes Tóth for disks.

40|$|The aim of {{this article}} is to study some asymptotics of a natural model of random {{ramified}} <b>coverings</b> on the <b>disk</b> of degree N. We prove that the monodromy field, called also the holonomy field, converges in probability to a non-random field as N goes to infinity. In order to do so, we use the fact that the monodromy field of random uniform labelled simple ramified <b>coverings</b> on the <b>disk</b> of degree N has the same law as the S(N) -Yang-Mills measure associated with the random walk by transposition on S(N). This allows us to restrict our study to random walks on S(N) : we prove theorems about asymptotics of random walks on S(N) in a new framework based on the geometric study of partitions and the Schur-Weyl-Jones's dualities. In particular, given a sequence of conjugacy classes (λ_N ⊂S(N)) _N ∈N, we define a notion of convergence for (λ_N) _N ∈N which implies the convergence in non-commutative distribution and in P-expectation of the λ_N-random walk to a P-free multiplicative Lévy process. This limiting process is shown not to be a free multiplicative Lévy process and we compute its log-cumulant functional.

We investigate whether the scattering may produce the steep rises in polarization observed blueward of the Lyman limit in some quasars. We suggest and assess two models. In the first model, primary disk radiation with a Lyman edge in absorption passes through a static ionized "skin" <b>covering</b> the <b>disk,</b> which has a temperature about 3 keV and a Thomson optical depth about unity. Electron scattering in the skin smears out the edge and produces a steep rise in polarization at lambda < 912 A. In the second model, the scattering occurs in a hot coronal plasma outflowing from the disk with a mildly relativistic velocity. We find that the second model better explains the data. The ability of the models to fit the observed rises in polarization is illustrated with the quasar PG 1630 + 377. Comment: submitted to ApJ Letter...|$|R
