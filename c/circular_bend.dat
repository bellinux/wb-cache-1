A wide-angle beam-propagation method formulated in a curvilinear coordinate system is used to compute the wave field in the bend.

40|$|Optical {{observations}} on the mesomorphs of benzene-hexa-n-alkanoates, and their admixtures with benzene, show that the planes of these discotic molecules are not perpendicular to the columns {{in which they are}} stacked, as was supposed originally. This evidence comes principally from the occurrence in texture domains of <b>circular</b> <b>bending,</b> between crossed polarizer and analyser, of oblique extinction brushes (i. e., brushes not parallel or perpendicular to polarizer and analyser directions). The obliquity varies from specimen to specimen up to a maximum of about 35 °. A tilted stacking, with a tilt angle (for the optic axes of the molecules) of about 35 °, will fit all the observations. Four alternative variants of such structures, two with the same tilt axes for all molecules, two with a herring-bone alternation between two orientations of tilt axis, all of which give rectangular pseudo-hexagonal lattices, are discussed. It is shown that the departure from hexagonal axial ratio required by these tilted structures is small enough not to be incompatible with the X-ray diffraction evidence previously interpreted as indicating hexagonal symmetry. These structures allow several different twinning modes, and complex optical features in some domains of <b>circular</b> <b>bending</b> are explicable in terms of these twinnings...|$|R

It is found that for the simulated particulate flow system, the particle mass concentration, number concentration, particle polydispersity, mean particle diameter and geometric standard deviation over cross-section increase with time. The distribution of particle mass concentration at different time is independent of the initial particle size. More particles are concentrated at {{outer edge of the}} bend. Coagulation plays more important role at initial stage than that in the subsequent period. The increase of Reynolds number and initial particle size leads to the increase of particle number concentration.

40|$|AbstractThe {{failure of}} cracked rock masses is mainly {{due to the}} {{influence}} of both opening (mode I) and sliding (mode II) of deformation. In this paper, mixed mode I/II fracture toughness of an Iranian white marble (Harsin marble) was investigated both experimentally and theoretically. Several mixed mode fracture tests were conducted on Harsin marble using cracked semi <b>circular</b> <b>bend</b> (SCB) specimens to obtain the mixed mode fracture resistance envelope in the complete range from pure mode I to pure mode II. However, the experimental results were not consistent with the classical mixed mode brittle fracture criteria. It was demonstrated that the low fracture resistance of the tested rock was mainly due {{to the influence of}} large positive T-stresses that exist in the SCB specimen when the specimen is subjected to mixed mode loading. It was also shown that the GMTS criterion which uses three fracture parameters i. e. KI, KII and T can provide significantly better estimates for mixed mode fracture in the Harsin marble when tested by the SCB specimens...|$|E

The analytical solution of the circular beam problem presents the additional advantage to establish some nice properties on the unknown second gradient elastic moduli introduced by Enakoutsa (2014) model and the classical elasticity constants for both incompressible and compressible heterogeneous elastic materials.

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} new model to {{determine}} the head losses at confluences in one-dimensional models of open channel networks, making use of a momentum conservation approach. Momentum conservation has been applied in several theoretical models for confluence head losses, giving satisfactory results in general.

This work reports on the development and application of a theoretical model for the tributary momentum contribution, based on similarities with the flow upstream of a <b>circular</b> <b>bend</b> in a straight open channel. It describes the two-dimensional depth-averaged flow features in the tributary under the assumption of a 90 ° angle confluence in which all channels have equal widths, in order to obtain the resulting momentum contribution.

40|$|Asphalt {{concrete}} {{is commonly}} used as the surface layer on pavements because of its convenience, low cost, and smooth ride (Wagoner, 2005). However, {{there is a significant}} problem with the cracking and deterioration of asphalt concrete roads. The initiation of cracking in asphalt must be better understood in order to further improve pavement design. Fracture energy is the amount of energy needed to separate two surfaces. The semi <b>circular</b> <b>bend</b> (SCB) test can be used to measure the fracture energy of asphalt concrete. Currently, this method uses a semicircular specimen with a rectangular notch in a three-point bend compression test. Using a mechanically inserted rectangular notch creates a stress concentration {{at the top of the}} notch, causing the crack to initiate from one predetermined place: either on the left or the right of the notch. Therefore, the fracture energy found from the load vs. displacement curve may not representative of the true fracture energy of the specimen. In order to better isolate the fracture energy of asphalt concrete, this research will explore the fracture energy results of using a semicircular notch, a fatigue-cracked notch, and the traditional rectangular, mechanically inserted rectangular notch...|$|E

All the fabrics were divided into two groups and mercerization process was applied to the one of the groups. The mercerized fabrics were dyed and printed with reactive dyestuffs. The other non mercerized groups of fabrics were divided into three such as reactive dyed, reactive printed and pigment printed. As a result, 30 different fabrics were obtained.

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{potential}} methods for evaluating a healing system for asphalt pavements. The healing system under investigation involves compartmented calcium-alginate fibres encapsulating an asphalt binder healing agent (rejuvenator). This system presents a novel method of incorporating rejuvenators into asphalt pavement mixtures. The compartmented fibres {{are used to}} distribute the rejuvenator throughout the pavement mixture, thereby overcoming {{some of the problems}} associated with alternate asphalt pavement healing methods, i. e., spherical capsules and hollow fibres. The asphalt healing efficiency methods to be evaluated in this paper include: (i) standard test methods for asphalt pavements, such as the Indirect Tensile Strength test and the 4 Point Bending Fatigue test; and (ii) alternative fracture tests such as the Semi <b>Circular</b> <b>Bend</b> test. The study employs fracture theory in order to evaluate the efficiency of the damage repair. The research findings demonstrate that including compartmented calcium-alginate fibres encapsulating a rejuvenator into an asphalt pavement mix does not significantly improve the healing properties of the asphalt pavement. Nevertheless, the findings indicate that, with further enhancement, compartmented calcium alginate fibres may present a promising new approach for the development of self-healing asphalt pavement systems. Additionally, the test results indicate that the 4 point bend fatigue test is the most suitable test for evaluating the performance of self healing asphalt pavements...|$|E
40|$|Good {{fracture}} {{properties are}} an essential requirement for asphalt pavements {{built in the}} northern part of the US and in Canada for which the predominant failure mode is cracking due to high thermal stresses that develop at low temperatures. Currently, there is no agreement with respect to what experimental methods and analyses approaches to use to investigate the fracture resistance of asphalt materials and the fracture performance of asphalt pavements. This report presents a comprehensive research effort in which both traditional and new experimental protocols and analyses were applied to a statistically designed set of laboratory prepared specimens and to field samples from pavements with well documented performance to determine the best combination of experimental work and analyses to improve the low temperature fracture resistance of asphalt pavements. The two sets of materials were evaluated using current testing protocols, such as creep and strength for asphalt binders and mixtures as well as newly developed testing protocols, such as the disk compact tension test, single edge notched beam test, and semi <b>circular</b> <b>bend</b> test.

In this work, we report the design of an integrated optical programmable power splitter consisting of a Y-junction with programmable phase shifter cascaded to a directional coupler. We used a vectorial mode solver, and {{a combination of a}} transfer matrix method and a 3 -D vectorial coupled-mode theory (CMT) to compute the power transfer ratio of a realistic device structure made of $Si_ 3 N_ 4 $, TEOS, and $SiO_ 2 $ with cross-section as shown in the inset of the figure, and used the results to design a programmable power splitter with more than 20 dB power ratio range. In the simulations, waveguide attenuation values derived from measured attenuation of prefabricated test wafer, has been taken into account.

Furthermore, the Vickers microhardness of the formed samples compared to the parent materials shows an increase of 6 % while the Ultimate Tensile Strength also increased by 7 %.
