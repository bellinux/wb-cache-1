25|$|A pellet stove {{is a type}} of <b>clean-burning</b> stove {{which uses}} small, {{biological}} fuel pellets which are renewable and very <b>clean-burning.</b> Home heating using a pellet stove is an alternative currently used throughout the world, with rapid growth in Europe. The pellets are made of renewable material â€“- typically wood sawdust or off-cuts. There are currently {{more than half a million}} homes in North America using pellet stoves for heat, and probably a similar number in Europe. The pellet stove typically uses a feed screw to transfer pellets from a storage hopper to a combustion chamber. Air is provided for the combustion by an electric blower. The ignition is automatic, using a stream of air heated by an electrical element. The rotation speed of the feeder and the fan speeds can be varied to modulate the heat output.|$|E
25|$|Private {{burning of}} dry cellulosic/paper {{products}} is generally <b>clean-burning,</b> producing no visible smoke, but plastics in household waste can cause private burning {{to create a}} public nuisance, generating acrid odors and fumes that make eyes burn and water. Most urban communities ban burn barrels, and certain rural communities may have prohibitions on open burning, especially those home to many residents not familiar with this common rural practice.|$|E
25|$|Cogeneration can {{be applied}} to any fuel which is combusted for energy. Fossil fuels, biomass and biogas can all be used in CHP plants. Transporting heat over long {{distances}} is impractical, so cogeneration plants are usually small and located close to the energy load. Hence, cogeneration is inherently linked to distributed generation. The urban location of CHP plants makes them very compatible with <b>clean-burning</b> fuels such as natural gas. The health concerns associated with other fossil fuels (see coal above) make them less suitable for areas with high population densities.|$|E
2500|$|Stoves {{fueled by}} alcohol, such as ethanol, offer another modern, <b>clean-burning</b> stove option. Ethanol fueled stoves {{have been made}} popular through the work of Project Gaia in Africa, Latin America and the Caribbean.|$|E
2500|$|Due to {{concerns}} about air pollution, {{efforts have been}} made to improve the stove design over the years. Pellet stoves, for example, are a type of <b>clean-burning</b> stove, and air-tight stoves are another type that combust the wood more completely and therefore reduce the amount of the resulted combustion by-products.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the early}} 19th century a [...] thick seam of {{bituminous}} coal referred to historically as [...] "The Big Vein" [...] {{was discovered in}} the Georges Creek Valley. This coal region became famous for its <b>clean-burning</b> low sulfur content that made it ideal for powering ocean steamers, river boats, locomotives, and steam mills, and machines shops.|$|E
2500|$|The facility, one of {{the largest}} {{of its kind in the}} United States, is used to train Port Authority Police {{officers}} in aircraft rescue and firefighting techniques. It allows officers to train for emergency situations in a controlled environment. [...] The centerpiece of the training center is a [...] pit that uses <b>clean-burning</b> propane to simulate a fire. It also features a -long aircraft mock-up with a broken wing section. Computer controls allow for the creation of firefighting scenarios that vary in size, difficulty and intensity.|$|E
2500|$|Small two-stroke, bolt-on {{gasoline}} bike {{motors and}} adapter kits for bicycles {{had a brief}} surge in popularity in the late 1960s and early 1970s in the United States and Canada. These engine kits were designed or marketed by both small and large companies, including Bike Bug, Tas Spitz, and even Sears, which sold the Free Spirit, and Little Devil engine kits. Most of these kits were designed to use lightweight, low-cost two-stroke engines from Japanese manufacturers such as Tanaka. During the late 1990s, the arrival of inexpensive two-stroke engines and chain-drive transmissions from mainland China, designed to mount to bicycle frames, helped spark {{a new wave of}} United States consumer interest in motorized bicycles. Increasingly tighter United States emissions laws have made it more difficult for traditional two-stroke engines to pass emissions requirements, though Tanaka Inc. has since introduced a <b>clean-burning</b> [...] "Pure Fire" [...] line of two-stroke motors.|$|E
2500|$|The site {{they were}} {{referring}} to {{had belonged to}} the DL On the property were 13 buildings, built between 1865 and 1937 and all listed on the National Register of Historic Places. DL owned {{the route of the}} Phoebe Snow. Phoebe Snow was the name of a fictional character in an advertisement for the DL's use of <b>clean-burning</b> anthracite coal. She was a young woman who frequently rode the DL, always dressed in white. There was never any soot on Phoebe Snows white dress as the DL traveled its route from Hoboken, New Jersey, to Buffalo. The DL merged with the Erie Railroad in 1960 to form the Erie Lackawanna Railway and [...] "kept the Phoebe Snow name alive even after it converted to diesel locomotives in the 1950s." [...] Later, some of the trains that ran on the DL became known individually as the Phoebe Snow. The railroad passed to Conrail, and the site was eventually bought from them by the city of Scranton as the site for Steamtown, USA. According to Linda Greenhouse of The New York Times, [...] "Scranton was once served by five railroads, an almost unthinkable luxury for a city of just over 80,000 people. The passenger trains stopped decades ago, but one memory remains: the Lackawanna's elegant station, just up the street from Steamtown, completed in 1908 and converted into a hotel through a public-private partnership in 1983." ...|$|E

50|$|Most {{transportation}} fuels are liquids, because vehicles usually require {{high energy}} density. This occurs naturally in liquids and solids. High energy density {{can also be}} provided by an internal combustion engine. These engines require <b>clean-burning</b> fuels. The fuels that are easiest to burn cleanly are typically liquids and gases. Thus, liquids {{meet the requirements of}} being both energy-dense and <b>clean-burning.</b> In addition, liquids (and gases) can be pumped, which means handling is easily mechanized, and thus less laborious.|$|E
5000|$|To {{encourage}} {{the development of}} clean fuels, Buckley proposes [...] "rewards (i.e. not grants) be provided for producing systems that convert the U.S. to cleaner-burning energy sources. For example, for vehicles, I recommend a $7 billion reward be granted to the first company or joint venture that produces 10 hydrogen or similarly <b>clean-burning</b> fueling stations and 1,000 vehicles that run on the <b>clean-burning</b> fuel in U.S. metropolitan areas {{with a population of}} 3 million or more." ...|$|E

50|$|A <b>clean-burning</b> stove is a stove {{with reduced}} toxic emissions. The term {{commonly}} refers to wood-burning stoves for domestic heating, {{although it is}} also applied to cooking stoves. It is distinct from a clean-burning-fuel stove, which typically burns clean fuels such as ethanol, biogas, LPG, or kerosene. Studies into <b>clean-burning</b> stoves have shown that they reduce the emissions of dangerous particulates and carbon monoxide significantly, use less fuel than regular stoves, and result in fewer burn injuries. However, the emissions they produce are still {{much greater than the}} safe limits, and they {{do not appear to be}} effective at reducing illnesses such as pneumonia induced by breathing polluted air, which may have many sources.|$|E
50|$|MSU {{joined the}} Chicago Climate Exchange in 2006, {{promising}} a 6% decrease in emissions by 2010 and a 15% decrease by 2015 (versus a 2000 benchmark). The plant receives emissions credits when operating Units 5 and 6 {{due to their}} <b>clean-burning</b> natural-gas boilers.|$|E

50|$|Due to {{concerns}} about air pollution, {{efforts have been}} made to improve stove design. Pellet stoves, for example are a type of <b>clean-burning</b> stove. Air-tight stoves more completely combust wood and eliminate polluting combustion products. In the U.S. since 1992, all wood stoves being manufactured must limit particulate emission.|$|E
