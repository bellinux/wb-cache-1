50|$|With a self-signed <b>certificate</b> by contrast, {{trust of}} the values in the <b>certificate</b> are more {{complicated}} because the entity possesses the signing key, and can always generate a new <b>certificate</b> with different values. For example, the validity dates of a self-signed <b>certificate</b> might not be trusted because the entity could always create and sign a new <b>certificate</b> that contained a valid date range. The values in a self-signed <b>certificate</b> can be trusted when the following conditions are true: the values were (out-of-band) verified when the self-signed was formally trusted, {{and there is a}} method to verify the self-signed <b>certificate</b> has not changed after it was trusted. For example, the procedure of trusting a self-signed <b>certificate</b> includes a manual verification of validity dates, and a hash of the <b>certificate</b> is incorporated into the white list. When the <b>certificate</b> is presented for an entity to validate, they first verify the hash of the <b>certificate</b> matches the reference hash in the white-list, and if they match (indicating the self-signed <b>certificate</b> {{is the same as the}} one that was formally trusted) then the <b>certificate's</b> validity dates can be trusted.

5|$|In {{the nearly}} three decades since passage of the Silver Purchase Act of 1934, the annual demand for silver bullion rose {{steadily}} from roughly 11 million ounces (1933) to 110 million ounces (1962). The Acts of 1939 and 1946 established floor prices for silver of 71 cents and 90.5 cents (respectively) per ounce. Predicated by an anticipated shortage of silver bullion, Public Law 88-36 (PL88-36) was enacted on 4 June 1963 which repealed the Silver Purchase Act of 1934, and the Acts of 6 July 1939 and 31 July 1946, while providing specific instruction regarding the disposition of silver held as reserves against issued <b>certificates</b> and the price at which silver may be sold. It also amended the Federal Reserve Act to authorize the issue of lower denomination notes (i.e., $1 and $2), allowing for the gradual retirement (or swapping out process) of $1 silver <b>certificates</b> and releasing silver bullion from reserve. In repealing the earlier laws, PL88-36 also repealed {{the authority of the}} Secretary of the Treasury to control the issue of silver <b>certificates.</b> By issuing Executive Order 11110, President John F. Kennedy was able to continue the Secretary’s authority. While retaining their status as legal tender, the silver certificate had effectively been retired from use.|$|E
