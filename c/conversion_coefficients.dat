40|$|We {{calculate}} the amplitude-to-phase (AM-to-PM) noise conversion in a modified unitraveling carrier (MUTC) photodetector. We obtained two nulls as {{measured in the}} experiments, and we explain their origin. The nulls appear due to the transit time variation when the average photocurrent varies, and the transit time variation {{is due to the}} change of electron velocity when the average photocurrent varies. We also show that the AM-to-PM <b>conversion</b> <b>coefficient</b> depends only on the pulse energy and is independent of the pulse duration when the duration is less than 500 fs. When the pulse duration is larger than 500 fs, the nulls of the AM-to-PM <b>conversion</b> <b>coefficient</b> shift to larger average photocurrents. This shift occurs because the increase in that pulse duration leads to a decrease in the peak photocurrent. The AM-to-PM noise <b>conversion</b> <b>coefficient</b> changes as the repetition rate varies. However, the repetition rate does not change the AM-to-PM <b>conversion</b> <b>coefficient</b> as a function of input optical pulse energy. The repetition rate changes the average photocurrent.

50|$|At {{this stage}} of the {{analysis}} {{it is important to know}} the internal <b>conversion</b> <b>coefficients</b> for the transitions connecting the known levels. The internal conversion coefficient is defined as the number of de-excitations via e− emission over those via γ emission. If internal conversion takes place, the EM multipole fields of the nucleus do not result in the emission of a photon, instead, the fields interact with the atomic electrons and cause one of the electrons to be emitted from the atom. The gamma that would be emitted after the beta decay is missed, and the γ intensity decreases accordingly: IT = Iγ + Ie− = Iγ(1 + αe), so this phenomenon has to be taken into account in the calculation. Also, the x rays will be contaminated with those coming from the electron conversion process. This is important in electron capture decay, as it can affect the results of any x-ray gated spectra if the internal conversion is strong. Its probability is higher for lower energies and high multipolarities.|$|E

40|$|Introduction International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) has {{provided}} a comprehensive discussion on threshold dose for radiation-induced cataract in ICRP publication 116. Accordingly, {{various parts of the}} eye lens have different radio-sensitivities. Recently, some studies have been performed to develop a realistic eye model with the aim of providing accurate estimation of fluence-to-dose <b>conversion</b> <b>coefficients</b> for different parts of the eye. However, the effect of accommodation, which changes the lens shape and pupil size, on dose <b>conversion</b> <b>coefficients</b> has not been considered yet. In this study, we purport to develop an accommodation-dependent eye model and to study the effects of accommodation on the electron and proton fluence-to-dose <b>conversion</b> <b>coefficients.</b> Materials and Methods Herein, a modified eye model was developed by considering the effects of accommodation on the lens shape and pupil size. In addition, MCNPX 2. 6 Monte Carlo transport code was used to calculate the effects of  eye lens accommodation on electron and proton fluence-to-dose <b>conversion</b> <b>coefficients.</b> Results Calculation of dose <b>conversion</b> <b>coefficients</b> demonstrated that the accommodation causes up to 40 % discrepancy for fluence-to-dose <b>conversion</b> <b>coefficients</b> of electrons in the range of 600 to 800 keV, which is due to the change of eye lens shape during the accommodation of the eye. Conclusion Since the accommodation of the eye change the lens shape and pupil size, it has considerable effect on fluence-to-dose <b>conversion</b> <b>coefficients</b> of electrons at some ranges of incident particle energies that should be considered in simulation.

First, <b>conversion</b> <b>coefficients</b> varied according to the evaporator type. The average yearly conversion coefficient was only 0. 60 for phi 20 evaporator (an evaporation pan with a diameter of 20 cm), whereas it was about 1. 07 for the E 601 's pan, whose rim was about 7. 5 cm above ground. Second, the conversion coefficient changes within a year had the same pattern among the evaporators evaluated. The monthly <b>conversion</b> <b>coefficients</b> had the minimum values in March or April, then increased with time, and reached their maximum values in August or September. After September, the <b>conversion</b> <b>coefficients</b> varied in different directions with time. Third, the <b>conversion</b> <b>coefficients</b> changed from year to year, but their variations between maximum and minimum values were between 0. 06 and 0. 16.
