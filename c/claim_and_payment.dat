40|$|A {{letter report}} {{issued by the}} Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "Asbestos litigation arose out of millions of Americans' lengthy occupational exposure to asbestos which is linked to malignant and nonmalignant diseases. To date, about 100 companies have declared bankruptcy at least partially due to asbestos-related liability. In accordance with Chapter 11 and 524 (g) of the federal bankruptcy code, a company may transfer its liabilities and certain assets to an asbestos personal injury trust, which is then responsible for compensating present and future claimants. Since 1988, 60 trusts have been established to pay claims with about $ 37 billion in total assets. GAO was asked to examine asbestos trusts set up pursuant to 524 (g). This report addresses: (1) How much asbestos trusts have paid in claims and how trusts are administered, (2) How trust <b>claim</b> <b>and</b> <b>payment</b> information is made available to outside parties, and (3) Stakeholder [...] plaintiff and defense attorneys, trust officials, and other interested parties [...] views on whether more trust and claimant information should {{be made available to}} outside parties and efforts to change the trust system and processes. GAO analyzed trust agreements for 44 of 60 trusts and trust distribution procedures for 52 of 60 trusts, as well as financial reports for 47 of 60 trusts for 2009 and 2010. GAO also interviewed U. S. Bankruptcy Court judges and the trustees, general counsels, or directors from 11 trusts [...] ...|$|E

Enacting H.R. 982 would not affect direct spending or revenues; therefore, pay-as-you-go procedures do not apply.|$|R

40|$|Testimony {{issued by}} the Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "In April 2012, GAO found that the Department of Agriculture (USDA) did not report any aggregated data on attorney fee <b>claims</b> <b>and</b> <b>payments</b> made under the Equal Access to Justice Act (EAJA) and other fee-shifting statutes for fiscal years 2000 through 2010, but USDA and other key departments involved—the Departments of the Treasury and Justice—maintained certain data on individual cases or payments in several internal agency databases. However, collectively, these data did not capture all <b>claims</b> <b>and</b> <b>payments.</b> USDA officials stated {{at the time that}} given the decentralized nature of the department and the absence of an external requirement to track or report on attorney fee information, the information was not centrally tracked and decisions about whether to track attorney fee data {{and the manner in which}} to do so were best handled at the agency level. Officials from 29 of the 33 USDA agencies GAO contacted for its April 2012 report stated that they did not track or could not readily provide GAO with this information. The remaining 4 USDA agencies had mechanisms to track information on attorney fees, were able to compile this information manually, or directed GAO to publicly available information sources. GAO found that the Forest Service was the only program agency within USDA that was able to provide certain attorney fee data across the 11 -year period. GAO reported in April 2012 that about $ 16. 3 million in attorney fees and costs in 241 environmental cases from fiscal years 2000 through 2010 was awarded against or settled by the Forest Service (see fig. below). ...|$|R

40|$|Testimony {{issued by}} the Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "The National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP), established in 1968, provides property owners with some insurance coverage for flood damage. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) within the Department of Homeland Security is responsible for managing the NFIP. The unprecedented magnitude and severity of the flood losses from hurricanes in 2005 challenged the NFIP to process {{a record number of}} claims. These storms also illustrated {{the extent to which the}} federal government has exposure for claims coverage in catastrophic loss years. FEMA estimates that Hurricanes Katrina, Rita, and Wilma will generate <b>claims</b> <b>and</b> <b>payments</b> of about $ 23 billion [...] far surpassing the total claims paid in the entire history of the NFIP. This testimony provides information from past and ongoing GAO work on issues including: (1) NFIP's financial structure; (2) the impact of properties with repetitive flood losses on NFIP's resources; (3) proposals to increase the number of policies in force; and (4) the status of past GAO recommendations. ...|$|R

40|$|Damages to coastal {{property}} in southwestern Maine occur {{primarily as a}} result of storms, flooding, and erosion. Maine implemented the Sand Dune Rules in 1983 to protect sand dunes and mitigate coastal property damages. Prior to this study, no indicators of the outcome of these rules were identified or evaluated to determine the effectiveness of their implementation. Assessed building values (1987), National Flood Insurance Program <b>claims</b> <b>and</b> <b>payments</b> (1 978 - l 998), and sand dune permits (1 984 - 1998) for development in Kennebunk and Saco, Maine were evaluated. A geographic information system was created to determine if (1) development on or seaward of frontal dunes or in high-velocity flood zones is at greater risk of damages than development in other beach-system areas. and (2) the setback regulations of the Sand Dune Rules have reduced the risk of damages in high-hazard areas. The indicators support the hypotheses of this study as well as the development of updated maps and an improved permit process. Managers should focus on reducing the number of buildings vulnerable to coastal hazards to mitigate the impacts on property, life, and beach systems. ACKNOWLEDGEMENT...|$|R

The unit of analysis was staff of Offinso Health Insurance Scheme. The total population size of 20 was used. In addition extract from the financial records of the scheme was also used.
