40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the political economy}} of introducing a <b>computerised</b> <b>accounting</b> <b>system</b> in a former French colony in Africa with little government accounting and few financial statistics. The reforms were a condition of structural adjustment programmes imposed by the World Bank to improve governance, decision making and government accountability in a country with a turbulent political history since independence, and weak and often corrupt governance. The reform was unusual in that indigenous civil servants had considerable discretion over the choice and development of the system. Thus the local capability in developing government accounting technology suited to the local context and derived from learning by experience was created. The system was widely regarded as effective but it was abandoned for a French system which ultimately proved problematic. The decision to change the system and its ensuing problems are attributed to North-South relations, indigenous neopatrimonial leadership, and neocolonialism, especially by France in Francophone Africa...|$|E
40|$|The small {{business}} sector {{plays an important}} role in the economic development of a country. The contribution of financial management is considered a critical factor in the success and survival of {{small business}}es. However, not much is known about the extent to which small business owners use financial management practices in making different business management decisions. What are those practices, and how New Zealand (NZ) small business owners use financial information in making management decisions, are questions investigated in this study. This dissertation examines the existing literature to find the contribution of financial information in making organizational and managerial decisions. The literature review suggests that the use of financial information in decision making depends on the owners’ attitude and their level of financial literacy skills. A qualitative approach was adopted to investigate what financial information is used in making business decisions and the barriers the small business owners face in operating their businesses. A questionnaire and semi-structured interviews were used to collect primary data from 12 New Zealand small business owners. Using a questionnaire, this study sought to identify some basic perceptions of New Zealand small business owners regarding the benefits of using financial information in decision making. Semi-structured interviews were then conducted to obtain further explanation of the responses to the questionnaire. The study found that the majority of participants were not aware of the critical business decisions which were significant for the success of their businesses. The low level of financial literacy skills in the participants resulted in the use of individual practices for measuring business performance and making business decisions. Internal and external barriers were the two main types of barriers preventing participants from accessing financial information. Internal barriers included impediments emerging from the internal business environment such as participants’ lack of financial, managerial and IT skills. External barriers comprised barriers beyond the participants’ control. Lower level financial skills and financial constraints prevented participants in implementing a <b>computerised</b> <b>accounting</b> <b>system.</b> The study also found that external accountants were providing annual financial reports to their small business clients without explaining the messages conveyed in these reports. These barriers and issues that confronted small business owners, and affected the business performance, can be overcome by the following proposed intervention strategies. The level of financial literacy skills can be improved by educating and providing training to small business owners about published financial management practices. External accountants need to evaluate the financial management needs of their clients and assist them in understanding the benefits of this information. The accountants also need to encourage the owners to implement a <b>computerised</b> <b>accounting</b> <b>system</b> for better financial management. Most importantly a strong communication link need be existed between the owners and small business supporting organizations to formulate strategies which assist the owners in resolving their financial and non-financial problems...|$|E

40|$|The {{positive}} and negative impacts of information technology (IT) have been continuously discussed and debated by researchers, practitioners and scholars for several years. In the public sector environment, IT {{can be a powerful}} tool for improving the delivery of government services with better collaboration among various governments. Therefore, the Malaysian Government, similar to many other governments, has planned and implemented a number of programmes to embrace the digital world by transforming itself to deliver information and services electronically. In public sector audit and accounting practices, the Malaysian Government has experienced local reform aimed at escalating transparency, streamlining accountability and improving overall financial management in line with international standards and practices. The {{purpose of this study is}} to evaluate the impact of computer-based accounting systems (CBASs) on the effectiveness of performing accounting tasks by Malaysian public sector agencies (PSAs). This study focuses on the impact of performance based outcomes at three levels: individual task, accounting-related task, and organisational level performance. With regard to accounting-related task performance outcomes, this study aims to analyse the impact of CBASs on the typical processes, which are related to budgeting, financial reporting, auditing and financial controlling. This study also seeks to investigate the influence of driving factors comprising management support and organisational resources and capabilities on the effectiveness of the system. In order to achieve the objectives of this study, a conceptual model was developed based on theoretical perspectives from previous studies and in recognition of the practical realities on the ground. A questionnaire-based survey was carried out to seek responses from CBAS users of Malaysian PSAs. A total of 643 questionnaires were distributed and 399 were collected, which resulted in 374 usable responses that were used for data analysis. This study performed two phases of data analyses: preliminary analysis and structural equation modelling (SEM) analysis. The preliminary data analysis was performed using the statistical procedures of SPSS version 18. 0 (also known as PASW 18), while structural equation modelling was performed by AMOS 18. 0. The results showed that the CBASs have no direct impact on individual and organisational performance outcomes. In contrast, the CBASs have impacted directly and significantly on the accounting-related task performance outcomes, comprising budgeting, accounting and reporting, auditing, and controlling tasks in the organisations. Furthermore, this study found that management support and organisational resources and capabilities influenced the effectiveness of CBASs within the organisation. Thus, it can be suggested that the effectiveness of CBASs is influenced by management support and organisational resources and capabilities, which directly impact on the improvement of tasks performed and indirectly on the improvement of individual performance as well as organisational performance. Thus, the CBASs have some „indirect‟ positive effects on performance at the individual and organisational levels. Several implications emerge from the empirical findings. This study contributes to the accounting literature, in general, and government <b>computerised</b> <b>accounting</b> <b>system</b> literature, in particular. The empirical findings with regard to the accountingrelated task performance outcomes suggest that the system may improve the effectiveness and efficiency of financial administration processes and also improve their accounting systems and practices. The findings may also add to our understanding of the current status of CBAS implementation and its significant contributions to organisations and society. This study has also given an insight into the degree and complexities of public financial management issues that often need to be dealt with in PSAs, especially in developing countries and emerging economies. The findings may be useful as guidance for helping organisations to improve their public financial management, which requires continuous commitment from top management and the provision of organisational resources and capabilities for a sustainable system. Moreover, the PSAs should also seriously take into account the impact of the system on the management and employees attached to the system itself in order to make sure that the system is successfully implemented and efficiently operated. As the findings provide an insight into the changes of the system on accounting processes, organisations need to develop new strategies to adapt to the demand of the technology and also to get the best results for the organisations. On the other hand, the public or stakeholders may evaluate the contribution of the system in creating value to the organisations. The findings of this study should also be considered by the decision-makers or policymakers as an input for future strategy formulation and planning to benefit the organisations and their clients.

40|$|Today, many Malaysian SMEs {{are facing}} {{problems}} that hinder the full implementation of <b>computerised</b> <b>accounting</b> information <b>systems</b> (CAIS). These problems {{are related to}} human resources incapable of using the systems and organisation’s inability to adopt the technology and align it with the companies’ strategic policy. The {{purpose of this study}} is to empirically test the impact of CAIS on information quality, focusing on the transparency aspects of corporate governance and strategic decision making (SDM). <b>Accounting</b> information <b>systems</b> (AIS) with a ‘good fit’ and ‘highly praised’ corporate governance (CG) practices have been shown to lead to good firm performance. While the literature has examined the effects of AIS fit on firm performance, few studies have looked at the link between CAIS, information quality and firm performance. Further, while the impact of strategic decision making and CG on firm performance has been widely studied, the role of AIS in this relationship is less clear. Since AIS forms the backbone of a firm’s business information infrastructure, both strategic decision-making process and corporate governance, particularly the transparency dimension, rely on information derived from the system. Using a resource-based view (RBV) framework, hypothesised relationships among variables of interest were examined based on data collected from 336 small and medium size enterprises (SMEs) in Malaysia. Results from partial least square (PLS) analysis suggest that effects of AIS on firm performance were partially mediated by information quality, while a full moderation effect was found for other variables on firm performance. The results thus demonstrate the importance of information quality, SDM and AIS to a greater height, prompting SMEs to revisit their policies on AIS, staff training and largely transparency to better improve firm performance. Outcomes of this study contribute to the body of knowledge on AIS, information quality and SMEs, while helping to trigger interest among SMEs on the importance of having reliable accounting software to produce quality reports...|$|R

40|$|DoctorateGlobalisation, {{information}} technology, and {{in particular}} the development of sophisticated <b>Computerised</b> <b>Accounting</b> <b>Systems</b> (CAS) software, have become driving forces that continue to enhance and transform business needs and practices. A review of the literature suggests that the design of current accounting curricula does not sufficiently expose students to the concepts of globalisation and technology. This study aimed to discover the extent to which existing Australian CAS curriculum models did reflect business needs. Guidance was sought from the literature and from academics' accounts of how they develop the CAS curriculum, and the perceptions of business needs of business professionals, (key knowledgeables and young gun managers), and current students with business experience were explored. The study also considered the match between the CAS curriculum offered at the university where the researcher is employed as a lecturer and business needs, through an exploration of what the cohort of current students with business experience perceived the subject to offer. A mixed-method research strategy of enquiry, using two separate methods of data collection, was used, to better understand the relationship between curricula and business needs. This approach provided numeric trends from the quantitative research and detail from the qualitative research. The study was conducted in three phases: a survey gathered data relevant to the current students with business experience and the young guns, an Internet search for appropriate subject descriptions was made and an analysis was undertaken, and interviews provided rich data as the perceptions of academics, key knowledgeables, young guns and current students with business experience were explored [...] Rogers' (2003) adoption-diffusion study influenced the analysis of data gathered from the Internet search for Australian relevant subject descriptions. Academics were classified into adopter categories on the basis of innovativeness of curriculum content, and thus provided a basis for understanding the aims of their CAS curriculum, their perceived importance of business needs to the curriculum, and why a particular software became a feature of the curriculum. The data was analysed thematically and the key findings were drawn from the participants' experiences in business and at university. All participants were aware of the increasingly dominant role of CAS in business but a variety of different opinions and beliefs were presented as to the value of CAS as a part of university curricula. However, the overall view was that the academic's response must prepare students to participate in the business world, by ensuring curriculum content included learning processes, teaching practices and software offerings that would provide appropriate business solutions. The findings showed a number of impediments to future curriculum design that need to be addressed. These include academic inadequacies, pedagogical beliefs and practices related to the place of software applications in curriculum design, the need for different software solutions for different business problems, and cost factors related to the decision to introduce new technologies. Recommendations were made as to appropriate topics to include in future curriculum design. All cohorts agreed that enterprise resource planning (ERP) solutions will be the future business software solution of choice to both large and small to medium enterprise (SME) businesses, and a solution was proposed for innovative curriculum design in order to master the complexity of such applications.
