5000|$|Grease {{from the}} early Egyptian or Roman eras {{is thought to have}} been {{prepared}} by combining lime with olive oil. The lime saponifies some of the triglyceride that comprises oil to give a <b>calcium</b> <b>grease.</b> In the middle of the 19th century, soaps were intentionally added as thickeners to oils. [...] Over the centuries, all manner of materials have been employed as greases. For example, black slugs Arion ater were used as axle-grease to lubricate wooden axle-trees or carts in Sweden.|$|E
40|$|Resiliency {{tests have}} been {{conducted}} in order to evaluate O-ring sealing response in the revised Space Shuttle SRBs, giving attention {{to the effects of}} temperature and gap-opening rates. Additional testing was conducted to ascertain O-ring responses to simulated SRB field-joint deflections. All tests employed a face-seal fixture mounted on a servohydraulic apparatus. The Viton candidate O-ring material tracked the gap-opening rate better at higher temperatures and lower gap-opening rates; it was also the only material inert to the <b>calcium</b> <b>grease</b> employed. Heaters must be used to maintain the 70 F minimum temperature at which the Viton O-ring will track the required gap opening rate...|$|E
40|$|Lifetime Testing of Corrosion Preventive Compounds (CPCs) was {{performed}} to quantify performance in the various environments to which the Space Shuttle Orbiter is exposed during a flight cycle. Three CPCs are approved for use on the Orbiter: HD <b>Calcium</b> <b>Grease,</b> Dinitrol AV- 30, and Braycote 601 EF. These CPCs have been rigorously tested {{to prove that they}} mitigate corrosion in typical environments, but little information is available on how they perform in the unique combination of the coastal environment at the launch pad, the vacuum of low-earth orbit, and the extreme heat of reentry. Currently, there is no lifetime or reapplication schedule established for these compounds that is based on this combination of environmental conditions. Aluminum 2024 coupons were coated with the three CPCs and exposed to conditions that simulate the environments to which the Orbiter is exposed. Uncoated Aluminum 2024 coupons were exposed to the environmental conditions as a control. Visual inspection and Electro- Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) were performed on the samples {{in order to determine the}} effectiveness of the CPCs. The samples were processed through five mission life cycles or until the visual inspection revealed the initiation of corrosion and EIS indicated severe degradation of the coating...|$|E
30|$|In this study, we {{synthesized}} {{two types}} of <b>calcium</b> sulfonate complex <b>greases</b> (barium soap and calcium soap) and investigated their physical, rheological, and tribological properties in detail. The test {{results showed that the}} evolution of their linear viscoelasticity functions with frequency were quite similar to those of traditional lubricating greases. Moreover, these two <b>calcium</b> sulfonate complex <b>greases</b> had good friction-reducing and antiwear properties at room temperature and at 150 °C. In addition, by adding an organic molybdenum compound (MoDTC) to the base greases, we obtained a very low friction coefficient (0.065) for one of the <b>greases</b> (<b>calcium</b> soap) at 400 N and 500 N (maximum Hertzian pressures of 3.47 GPa and 3.74 GPa, respectively) at 150 °C. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis showed that the tribofilm was composed of some complex oxide species and CaCO 3 that had formed on the worn surface.|$|R
40|$|MoS 2 @oleylamine nanosheets were {{successfully}} synthesized by a novel wet chemistry approach. Two dispersions of nanosheets in Calcium and Lithium based greases were investigated {{with respect to}} rheological and tribological properties. The inclusion of the MoS 2 nanosheets in the in Calcium and Lithium based greases determines slightly higher values of the elastic response and of the complex viscosity of the based greases. The tribological results show a marked decreasing in friction coefficient both in boundary and mixed lubrication regimes achievable through MoS 2 nanosheets dispersion, with average reduction for <b>Calcium</b> and Lithium <b>grease</b> around 35 %. The anti-wear property of MoS 2 nanosheets as additive for <b>Calcium</b> and Lithium <b>greases</b> has been also clearly exhibited in both the above lubrication regimes, leading to an average level of 30 % decreasing on the scar diameter measured on the steel ball worn surface...|$|R

The {{fiction and}} wear {{properties}} of overbased <b>calcium</b> sulfonate complex <b>grease</b> containing anti-oxidant additives were investigated using MFT-R 4000 reciprocating friction and wear tester. The {{results show that}} the overbased calcium sulfonate complex greasecontaining 2 %dialkylated diphenylamine (L 57) having better friction-reducing properties than the grease containing 2, 6 -di-tert-butyl-phenol (L 135) and the grease containing 5 % L 57...|$|R
40|$|In this work, model {{renewable}} and biodegradable {{lubricating greases}} based on castor oil and chemically modified biopolymers (methylcellulose, chitin and cellulosic pulp) were tribologically characterized in a steel–steel ball-on-plates tribological cell coupled to a controlled-stress rheometer, {{and the results}} were compared to those provided by conventional lithium and <b>calcium</b> soap-based <b>greases.</b> Viscous flow, sliding velocity sweep and transient friction tests were carried out and resulting wear scars in the steel plates were evaluated by means of scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Different frictional responses were found depending on the thickener, especially at high temperature. Excepting for most severe conditions, wear is negligible when using chemically modified chitin and methylcellulose-based greases as lubricants.

40|$|The {{operational}} life of bearings is often {{determined by the}} performance of the lubricating grease. The consistency of the grease prevents it from leaking out of the bearing and provides good sealing properties. The possible ingress of water into the bearing will have a considerable impact not only on this consistency but also on the lubricating ability of the grease. There are numerous applications where water ingress may occur, such as in the steel, food, pulp, and paper industries. Some greases are less sensitive to water than others. No specific guidelines are available to select the proper grease for bearings subjected to water ingress. The goal of the article is to {{contribute to the development of}} such guidelines for greases subjected to water ingress by studying the impact of water on grease rheology. Fully formulated, commercially available greases with the most common thickeners and base oils are used as model greases. It will be shown that water strongly influences rheological properties such as zero-shear viscosity, yield stress, and storage modulus. <b>Calcium</b> sulfonate <b>greases</b> were found to become stiffer after absorbing a considerable amount of water, leading to an increase in zero-shear viscosity and yield stress. However, lithium, lithium complex, and polyurea greases were found to soften, with appreciable changes in measured rheological propertie...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{influence}} {{of water on the}} EHL film thickness of six commercial lubricating greases under fully flooded and starved conditions. Although grease can absorb large quantities of water, separation occurs due to pressure and shear, leading to free water. This does not {{have an impact on the}} film thickness under fully flooded conditions. However, water does have an effect on the film thickness under starved conditions where the differences are related to the change in oil bleed. In the presence of water, an increase in oil bleed was found for lithium, lithium complex and polyurea grease. These greases showed a reduction in the levels of starvation and, therefore, thicker films. Water contamination led to lower oil bleed for <b>calcium</b> sulfonate complex <b>greases,</b> which led to an increase in starvation, and therefore, thinner films compared to their uncontaminated counterparts...|$|R
