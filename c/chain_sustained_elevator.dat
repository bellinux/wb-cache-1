The modes {{in which}} Nature {{produces}} variable curves {{on a large}} scale are very numerous, but may generally be resolved into the gradual increase or diminution of some given force. Thus, if a chain hangs between two points A and B, Fig. 95, the weight of <b>chain</b> <b>sustained</b> by any given link increases gradually from the central link at C, which has only its own weight to sustain, to the link at B, which sustains, besides its own, the weight of all the links between it and C. This increased weight is continually pulling the curve of the swinging chain more nearly straight as it ascends towards B; and hence one of the most beautifully gradated natural curves--called the catenary--of course assumed not by chains only, but by all flexible and elongated substances, suspended between two points. If the points of suspension be near each other, we have such curves as at D; and if, as in nine cases out of ten will be the case, one point of suspension is lower than the other, a still more varied and beautiful curve is formed, as at E.

Using a recursive Green’s-function approach, we determine the local {{density of states}} {{of the system and}} find that the end Majorana mode of the wire leaks into the dot, thus, emerging as a unique dot level pinned to the Fermi energy εF of the leads. Surprisingly, this resonance pinning, resembling, in this sense, a “Kondo resonance,” occurs even when the gate-controlled dot level εdot(Vg) is far above or far below εF. The calculated conductance Gof the dot exhibits an unambiguous signature for the Majorana end mode of the wire: In essence, an off-resonance dot [εdot(Vg) = εF], which should have G = 0, shows, instead, a conductance e 2 / 2 h over a wide range of Vg due to this pinned dot mode. Interestingly, this pinning effect only occurs when the dot level is coupled to a Majorana mode; ordinary fermionic modes (e. g., disorder) in the wire simply split and broaden (if a continuum) the dot level. We discuss experimental scenarios to probe Majorana modes in wires via these leaked/pinned dot modes. CNPqCAPESFAPESPFAPEMIGPRP-USPNúcleo de Apoio à Pesquisa Nanofísica Quântica (NAP Q-NANO...|$|R

Due to its ubiquitous role in the energy metabolism, both the oxidation and reduction of the enzyme's substrate co-enzyme Q has been studied vigorously. Here, this vast amount of data is reassessed after probing the substrate reduction steps at the Q(i) -site of the cyt bc(1) complex of Rhodobacter capsulatus using atomistic molecular dynamics simulations. The simulations suggest that the Lys 251 side chain could rotate into the Q(i) -site to facilitate binding of half-protonated semiquinone - a reaction intermediate that is potentially formed during substrate reduction. At this bent pose, the Lys 251 forms a salt bridge with the Asp 252, thus making direct proton transfer possible. In the neutral state, the lysine side chain stays close to the conserved binding location of cardiolipin (CL). This back-and-forth motion between the CL and Asp 252 indicates that Lys 251 functions as a proton shuttle controlled by pH-dependent negative feedback. The CL/K/D switching, which represents a refinement to the previously described CL/K pathway, fine-tunes the proton transfer process. Lastly, the simulation data was used to formulate a mechanism for reducing the substrate at the Q(i) -site...|$|R

40|$|This paper aims {{to study}} the biomechanical effects on {{elevator}} users and the injuries <b>sustained</b> should an <b>elevator</b> crash happen. The analysis will focus on buffer impact, signaling that the earlier mentioned buffer is usually located {{at the bottom of}} the pit. In order to carry out this analysis, a numerical technique based on finite element method will be used, while elevator users will be simulated by means of automotive dummies. Two crash factors will be studied, namely, location of dummy and fall velocity. The analysis criteria will be damages sustained by the dummy, based on biomechanical index such as HIC, CSI, forces, and accelerations...|$|R
