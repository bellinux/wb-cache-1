40|$|Presently in Iran, gas-driven <b>power</b> <b>stations</b> and <b>combined-cycle</b> <b>power</b> <b>stations</b> compete as {{they share}} a common budget {{allocated}} by the government for their establishment. With the government offering gas at subsidized rates, the cost price of electricity production at gas-driven <b>power</b> <b>stations</b> is comparatively lower, thereby enhancing their attractiveness for the investor. Therefore, despite their decreased efficiency, the establishment of such <b>power</b> <b>stations</b> is on the increase which in turn imposes additional costs for the government. On the other hand, {{it would be in}} the best interest of the government to help increase investment in combined cycle <b>power</b> <b>stations</b> which are far superior in terms of efficiency, and which, in the long run, would be profitable.

50|$|The {{efficiency}} of a Rankine cycle is usually {{limited by the}} working fluid. Without the pressure reaching supercritical levels for the working fluid, the temperature range the cycle can operate over is quite small; in steam turbines, turbine entry temperatures are typically 565 °C (the creep limit of stainless steel) and condenser temperatures are around 30 °C. This gives a theoretical Carnot {{efficiency of}} about 63% compared with an actual efficiency of 42% for a modern coal-fired <b>power</b> <b>station.</b> This low turbine entry temperature (compared with a gas turbine) is why the Rankine cycle is often used as a bottoming cycle in <b>combined-cycle</b> gas turbine <b>power</b> <b>stations.</b>|$|R

50|$|The {{efficiency}} of the Rankine cycle {{is limited by the}} high heat of vaporization of the working fluid. Also, unless the pressure and temperature reach super critical levels in the steam boiler, the temperature range the cycle can operate over is quite small: steam turbine entry temperatures are typically around 565 °C and steam condenser temperatures are around 30 °C. This gives a theoretical maximum Carnot efficiency for the steam turbine alone of about 63.8% compared with an actual overall thermal {{efficiency of}} up to 42% for a modern coal-fired <b>power</b> <b>station.</b> This low steam turbine entry temperature (compared to a gas turbine) is why the Rankine (steam) cycle is often used as a bottoming cycle to recover otherwise rejected heat in <b>combined-cycle</b> gas turbine <b>power</b> <b>stations.</b>|$|R

40|$|OVERVIEW: These days, {{against a}} {{background}} of deregulation of the power-generation industry, more and more IPPs (independent power producers) and PPSs (power producers and suppliers) are entering the power-generation market. At the same time, the need for improved energy efficiency is growing. As a result of these circumstances, the number of <b>combined-cycle</b> <b>power</b> plants in the 20 – 100 -MW class being constructed is continuing to increase. Accordingly, to meet these needs, Hitachi is proposing an H- 25 <b>combined-cycle</b> <b>power</b> plant implemented with H- 25 gas turbines (25 -MW class) —which help to improve plant efficiency and shorten start-up and shutdown times. From such a background, Hitachi has developed a new plant control and monitoring system named “Hitachi Integrated Autonomic Control System—Multiplex for turbine control 1000 (HIACS-MULTI 1000) ” for H- 25 <b>combined-cycle</b> <b>power</b> plants. The HIACS-MULTI 1000 is the latest addition to the repertory of HIACS-MULTI systems. As well as attaining improved reliability and maintainability, the HIACS-MULTI 1000 control system is more compact and thus saves equipment space...|$|R
40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to estimate energy and carbon intensities of natural gas <b>combined-cycle</b> <b>power</b> plants and to improve the energy efficiency of power plants through an exergy analysis. Three plants in Thailand were evaluated as case studies in this research using data collected in 2013 – 2014. The results showed that the average carbon and energy intensities of three <b>Combined-Cycle</b> <b>Power</b> Plants were 0. 436 kg CO 2 /kWh and 7. 995 GJ/MWh, respectively. The range of the energy intensity in this study was slightly lower than that of other studies; however, the results of the carbon intensity were in the same range. The result of the exergy analysis illustrated that Heat Recovery Steam generator (HRSG) has the greatest exergy destruction due to the wide temperature range. To summarize, natural gas <b>combined-cycle</b> <b>power</b> plants require less energy and emit less carbon compared to other technologies or fuels. The exergy efficiency of HRSG was 60 %, with an exergy destruction rate of 66. 88 MW.
