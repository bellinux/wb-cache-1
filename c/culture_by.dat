5|$|Buffalo {{inherited}} {{not only}} the status afforded his family, but also had skills praised in his grandfather Andaigweos. Noted for his abilities in hunting and battle, Buffalo was recognized as chief by his people because of his speaking and oratorical skills, which were highly valued in his <b>culture.</b> <b>By</b> the time the Ojibwa of Wisconsin and Minnesota started treaty negotiations with the US Government, Buffalo was {{recognized as one of}} the primary spokesmen for all the bands, not just for the Ojibwa from La Pointe.|$|E
5|$|Canadian {{government}} policies such as official bilingualism; publicly funded health care; higher and more progressive taxation; outlawing capital punishment; strong efforts to eliminate poverty; strict gun control; leniency {{in regard to}} drug use, and, most recently, legalizing same-sex marriage are social indicators of Canada's political and cultural values. American media and entertainment are popular, if not dominant, in English Canada; conversely, many Canadian cultural products and entertainers are successful in the United States and worldwide. The Government of Canada has also influenced culture with programs, laws and institutions. It has created Crown corporations to promote Canadian culture through media and has also tried to protect Canadian <b>culture</b> <b>by</b> setting legal minimums on Canadian content.|$|E

5|$|Goodman and Edson were {{strongly}} influenced {{by the use of}} American Indian <b>culture</b> <b>by</b> Ernest Thompson Seton in his Woodcraft Indians program. They decided to create an honor society of their own at camp that summer, in a manner befitting a boy's interest and understanding. Goodman utilized the appeal of Indian lore and recognition by a Scout's peers as motivational tools. He devised a program where troops chose, at the camp's conclusion, those boys from among their number who best exemplified the ideals of Scouting. Those elected were acknowledged as having displayed, in the eyes of their fellow Scouts, a spirit of unselfish service and brotherhood. Edson helped Goodman research the traditions and language of the Lenni Lenape—also known as the Delaware—who had once inhabited Treasure Island.|$|E

5|$|Native mascots {{are also}} part of the larger issues of {{cultural}} appropriation and the violation of indigenous intellectual property rights, which includes all instances where non-natives use indigenous music, art, costumes, etc. in entertainment and commerce. It has been argued that harm to Native Americans occurs because the appropriation of Native <b>culture</b> <b>by</b> the majority society continues the systems of dominance and subordination that have been used to colonize, assimilate, and oppress indigenous groups. Some see the use of caricatures of Native Americans as sports mascots as contributing to their political and economic marginalization. Where other minorities would be consulted, decisions impacting Native Americans, such as building the Dakota Access Pipeline, are made while excluding Native concerns.|$|E
5|$|People {{relive the}} Wild West both {{historically}} and in popular <b>culture</b> <b>by</b> participating in cowboy action shooting events, where each gunslinger adopts {{his or her}} own look representing a character from Western life in the late 1800s, and as part of that character, chooses an alias to go by. The sport originated in Southern California, USA, in the early 1980s but is now practiced in many places with several sanctioning organizations including the Single Action Shooting Society (SASS), Western Action Shootists Association (WASA), and National Congress of Old West Shooters (NCOWS), as well as others in the USA and in other countries. There are different categories shooters can compete in. There's the gunfighter, frontiersman, classic cowboy and duelist - each with its own specifications.|$|E

The colony tried to contribute to area <b>culture</b> <b>by</b> requiring its members to hold art shows, lectures, and other exhibitions throughout the early 20th century.

5|$|The {{conquest of}} Asia by Alexander the Great exposed the Greeks to ideas from Syria, Babylon, Persia and central Asia. Around 280 BCE, Berossus, a priest of Bel from Babylon, {{moved to the}} Greek island of Kos, {{teaching}} astrology and Babylonian <b>culture.</b> <b>By</b> the 1st century BCE, there were two varieties of astrology, one using horoscopes to describe the past, present and future; the other, theurgic, emphasising the soul's ascent to the stars.

5|$|The {{discovery}} of a colossal head at Tres Zapotes {{in the nineteenth century}} spurred the first archaeological investigations of Olmec <b>culture</b> <b>by</b> Matthew Stirling in 1938. Seventeen confirmed examples are known from four sites within the Olmec heartland on the Gulf Coast of Mexico. Most colossal heads were sculpted from spherical boulders but two from San Lorenzo Tenochtitlán were re-carved from massive stone thrones. An additional monument, at Takalik Abaj in Guatemala, is a throne that may have been carved from a colossal head. This is the only known example from outside the Olmec heartland.|$|E

5|$|The mostly Celtic {{tribes of}} the area were subjugated by {{successive}} Roman campaigns aimed at control of the strategic routes from Italy across the Alps to the Rhine and into Gaul, most importantly by Julius Caesar's defeat of the largest tribal group, the Helvetii, in 58BC. Under the Pax Romana, the area was smoothly integrated into the prospering Empire, and its population assimilated into the wider Gallo-Roman <b>culture</b> <b>by</b> the 2nd century AD, as the Romans enlisted the native aristocracy to engage in local government, built a network of roads connecting their newly established colonial cities and divided up the area among the Roman provinces.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of the {{consequent}} Roman efforts to subjugate all of Germania, the member tribes of the Suebi alliance became displaced, moved east, conquered the Celtic tribes that stood in their way and settled, the Quadi in Moravia, and the Marcomanni in Bohemia. The latter tribe, under Marbod, formed a quasi-state with a huge army and was able to conquer the Lugii tribal association among others. What archeologists see as the Przeworsk <b>culture,</b> <b>by</b> this period (early 1st century AD) is believed to consist first of all of the Lugii tribes. A Roman defeat in the Battle of the Teutoburg Forest (9 AD) stabilized the situation at the periphery of the Empire to some degree. The Lugii and other tribes on Polish lands increasingly became involved in trade and other contacts, through the Marcomanni and Quadi intermediaries, with the Danubian provinces of Rome. The Lugii, according to Tacitus, was a very large union of tribes. In 50 AD they invaded and pillaged the Quadi state created by Vannius, contributing to its fall. The motivation for the expedition were the rumours of the enormous riches that Vannius had accumulated by plunder and charging duties. In 93 AD the Lugii, fighting a war with the Suebi, asked Emperor Domitian for help, and received one hundred mounted soldiers.|$|E

Meanwhile, Marge attempts to stimulate Bart with a little <b>culture</b> <b>by</b> taking the family to the opera. However, this proves disastrous as Bart and Homer are quite disruptive, much to Lisa's joy.

On the bright side, he enjoys newfound attention from Homer and he covers for them when Marge makes another attempt to stimulate Bart's brain by taking them to a film festival. After Bart's chemistry experiment explodes, filling the school lab with green goo, he confesses to Dr. Pryor that he switched tests with Martin.

5|$|Nonetheless, the Norse {{tradition}} {{states that}} Rognvald Eysteinsson received Orkney and Shetland from Harald as an earldom as reparation {{for the death}} of his son in battle in Scotland, and then passed the earldom on to his brother Sigurd the Mighty. Sigurd's line barely survived him and it was Torf-Einarr, Rognvald's son by a slave, who founded a dynasty that controlled the Northern Isles for centuries after his death. He was succeeded by his son Thorfinn Turf-Einarsson and during this time the deposed Norwegian King Eric Bloodaxe often used Orkney as a raiding base before being killed in 954. Thorfinn's death and presumed burial at the broch of Hoxa, on South Ronaldsay, then led to a long period of dynastic strife. Whatever the historical details, it seems likely that Orkney and Shetland were being rapidly absorbed into Norse <b>culture</b> <b>by</b> this time.|$|E
5|$|The long {{nineteenth century}} saw {{profound}} {{cultural and economic}} changes in Belgium. The Industrial Revolution, which began to take effect in Belgium {{during the period of}} French rule, transformed the region's economy {{over the course of the}} period. By 1914, Belgium was acknowledged as one of the most densely industrialized countries in Europe, with notable coal mining and manufacturing industries. The period saw the gradual decline of the various dialects spoken in the country and the establishment of two distinct language groups, French in Wallonia and Dutch in Flanders. French, traditionally spoken by the elite, was given legal predominance across the country. During the nineteenth century, both linguistic groups witnessed a cultural resurgence and developed separate traditions in literature and <b>culture.</b> <b>By</b> the end of the period, the Flemish Movement, seeking legal equality for Dutch language and even regional independence, had emerged in Flanders and a similar movement developed in Wallonia.|$|E
