40|$|A {{spatially}} distributed hydrologic model (WetSpa) is used {{to estimate}} daily river water discharge in the Simiyu river a tributary of Lake Victoria, Tanzania. The model combines topography, landuse and soil maps, and observed daily meteorological time series to predict discharge hydrographs and the spatial distribution of hydrological parameters in the catchment. The elevations in the catchment range from 2000 to 1100 m at the outlet, with average slope of 1. 4 %. The dominant landuse types are, wasteland, grassland, bushland, cultivated land, and a very small area is covered by surface water. The dominant soil types are sandy loam, followed by sandy <b>clay</b> <b>loam,</b> <b>clay</b> <b>loam,</b> <b>clay,</b> loam and sandy clay. There are two distinctive seasons in the Simiyu catchment. Short rains mainly in November, December and January, and long rains in March to May, {{resulting in a total}} average annual precipitation of 700 to 1000 mm. The annual potential evapotranspiration is about 1300 mm, and the river discharge at the catchment outlet ranges from 0 to about 200 m 3 /s. Global parameters of the model are calibrated using three years of daily observed discharge values measured {{at the mouth of the}} river at Lake Victoria. The estimated average travel time of the runoff to the outlet of the catchment is about 2. 4 d and maximum 8 d for the most remote areas. The model results also show that the surface runoff and interflow provide respectively 38. 6 % and 61. 4 % of the total runoff, while the contribution of groundwater drainage is nil. The absence of groundwater drainage is probably due to the high evaporation demand of the atmosphere, which accounts for about 90 % of the total precipitation being lost by evapotranspiration. The annual water balance estimated with the model reveals that the total outflow to Lake Victoria is about 500 &times; 10 6 m 3 per year, which occurs mainly in the wet seasons, i. e. from March to May and from November to January.

Sandblasting is thought to be the primary mechanism, but recent studies suggest that dust emission by direct aerodynamic entrainment can be significant under certain conditions. In this work, using wind tunnel experiments, we investigated some of the lesser understood aspects of dust emission in sandblasting and aerodynamic entrainment for three soil types, namely <b>clay,</b> silty <b>clay</b> <b>loam,</b> and <b>clay</b> <b>loam.</b> First, we explored the role of erodible surface roughness on dust emitted by aerodynamic entrainment. Second, we compared the emitted dust concentration in sandblasting and aerodynamic entrainment under a range of wind friction velocities. Finally, we explored the sensitivity of emitted dust particle size distribution (PSD) to soil type and wind friction velocity in these two processes. The dust concentration in aerodynamic entrainment showed strong positive correlation, no significant correlation, and weak negative correlation, for the <b>clay,</b> silty <b>clay</b> <b>loam,</b> and <b>clay</b> <b>loam,</b> respectively, with the erodible soil surface roughness.

After this, it was possible to produce plastic fiber reinforced cohesive and mixed grained soils up to 1, 5 % reinforcement percentage and glass fiber reinforced soils up to 3 %. Thus, compared to unreinforced soils, considerably higher drained and undrained strengths were reached without significantly disturbing the permeability.

40|$|Abstract. A transfer-function {{method has}} been applied to {{determine}} solute-transport parameters from earlier sections of complete breakthrough data. Time-domain reflectometry allows the measurement of breakthrough data in unsaturated soil. In fine-textured soils, the flow of water must be kept low to maintain unsaturated conditions, and so experiments for a complete breakthrough of solute may last a very long time. Substantial savings of time and computer memory might be achieved if data could be analysed from an earlier section of breakthrough data. Data at 2 vertical positions (input at upper and response at lower position) from a complete breakthrough of calcium chloride applied as a pulse input to 4 unsaturated soils (coarse sand, sandy loam, <b>clay</b> <b>loam,</b> <b>clay)</b> were divided into 4 sets of increasing duration. Transport parameters of calcium chloride were determined by a transfer function, which results in similar values of the parameters from the last 3 datasets in all 4 soils. In the clay soil, however, because of erroneous breakthrough data the fit between the measured and estimated breakthrough curves (BTCs) was poor, but the transport parameters were consistent among different segments of data. We show {{that it is possible to}} determine successfully solute-transport parameters from partial breakthrough data, which include the peak of the response BTC. This transfer-function method is thus a powerful tool to shorten breakthrough experiments...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT. Predicting the {{occurrence}} {{and development of}} fractures is difficult because fracturing in glacial tills and other unconsolidated materials has been observed across many geographic areas, climates, land uses, soil types, and till units. This difficulty led to a statistical investigation of historic geologic and soil data. Soil textures and fracture depths from 9 field sites and 45 soil pedons (140 sample points) were analyzed using statistical and graphical methods. When plotted on the USDA soil texture ternary diagram, the data indicate that tills having less than 10 % clay or greater than 52 % sand are unlikely to support fracturing; conversely tills having greater than 10 % clay or less than 52 % sand {{are more likely to}} do so. Based on the 95 % hexagonal confidence region for soil texture data, tills with less than 55 % sand, 20 - 65 % silt, and 5 - 53 % clay {{would be more likely to}} form fractures. The texture classes of tills predicted to sustain fracturing were mainly <b>clay,</b> <b>loam,</b> <b>clay</b> loam, silty clay loam, and silty clay. The depth of glacial tills having observed fractures ranged from 0. 5 to 215 ft. These results are useful to explain and document how fractures are created in glacial tills and may be a useful tool for field engineers and geologists allowing them to anticipate fractures in glacial tills in Ohio and beyond...|$|E

30|$|The primary {{differences}} between the Case 1 and the Case 2 {{are associated with the}} variations in soil type composition and land cover. Variations in vegetation composition result in change in root depth which leads to a change in amount of water restraining around the plant roots. Crop/mosaic is the main land cover type, covering 91.92  % of the area in sub-catchment 0 and sub-catchment 1 in Case 1 (Table  5). In Case 2, most parts of the headwaters in sub-catchment 0 and sub-catchment 1 (39.38  % of the area) are covered by deep rooted vegetation which are natural forests, while 47.46  % of the area is covered by crop/mosaic (Table  5). According to Table  5, the land cover in Case 2 includes greater area with deep rooted vegetation, and hence, more water restraining around the plant roots than Case 1. Further the simulation results show that, with more deep rooted area, Srz Case 2 is always having a greater value than Srz Case 1 (Fig.  6 c), and hence higher value for ET Case 2 than ET Case 1 (Fig.  6 b; Table  8). In Case 2, sub-catchment 0 and sub-catchment 1 are covered by sandy <b>clay</b> <b>loam,</b> <b>clay,</b> and clay loam whereas in Case 1, both sub-catchments are covered by sandy clay loam, and loam. Percentage areas covered by the different soil groups in sub-catchment 0 and sub-catchment 1 are shown in Table  3. Sandy soils covering substantial area in Case 1 incorporate more ground water recharge than Case 2 (Table  3). Soils in the Case 2 include more clayey soils, which hold lower infiltration rate resulting a higher runoff potential than the soils in Case 1. But this is outweighed by the more runoff generated in the Case 1 due to the lower root zone storage capacities resulting greater simulated discharge in Case 1 than that of Case 2.|$|E

The experiments were carried out at the laboratory of Agriculture Collage of University of Kurdistan. For carry out of the experiments five textures and for each of them three repetitions were used. The studied textures were loamy sand, sandy loam, sandy clay-loam, clay loam and clay. The provided textures infuse inside the PVC cylinder with 30 cm height and 25 cm diameter. The vases were inside the water bath nearly 24 h. After 24 h of saturation, the soil water content of the samples was measured by oven-dry gravimetric and TDR methods. For each textures at any stage of measurement the determination of moisture and di-electric constant were carried out at three capture windows and with three repetitions. In each day the moisture measurement of each texture was carried out by these two methods until a moisture range was determined. The results of this research show that: (1) For all soil textures (loamy sand, sandy loam, sandy clay-loam, <b>clay</b> <b>loam,</b> <b>clay)</b> the measured moisture at the capture windows of 20 ns was more accuracy rather than other capture windows.

This difference is increased when the soil ranged from light to heavy textures. (4) the comparison of the studied textures indicated that with increasing of clay content, the fitted lines slope is decreasing, but the RMSE values have increasing rate which it indicated the effect of clay content on the accuracy of TDR device.

40|$|The {{heterogeneity}} of textures in soil profiles {{is important for}} quantifying the movement of water and solutes through soil. Soil-profile textures {{to a depth of}} 300 cm were investigated at 100 sites in a 100 -km 2 area in the central region of the Heihe River system, where oases coexist with widespread deserts and wetland. The probability distribution of textural-layer thickness was quantified. The vertical transition of the soil textural layers was characterised by a Markov chain-log-normal distribution (MC-LN) model based on the probability of one textural type transitioning to another. Nine types of textural layers were observed: sand, loamy sand, sandy loam, silt loam, loam, clay loam, silty clay loam, silty clay, and clay. Sand was the most frequent in the profiles, whereas silt loam and clay were rare. The layers of sand and silty clay were relatively thick, and the layers of loam and clay were relatively thin. The coefficients of variation ranged from 36 - 87 %, indicating moderate variation in the layer thickness of each textural type. The soil profile was characterised as a log-normal distribution. A x 2 test verified the Markov characteristic and the stability of the vertical change of soil textural layers. Realisations of the soil textural profiles were generated by the MC-LN model. A Monte Carlo simulation indicated that the simulated mean layer thickness of each textural type agreed well with the corresponding field observations. Element values of the transition probability matrix of the textural layers simulated by the MC-LN model deviated < 12. 6 % from the measured values, excluding the data from the layers of clay and silt loam.

40|$|Introduction: Water {{and soil}} {{retention}} curve {{is one of}} the most important properties of porous media to obtain in a laboratory retention curve and time associated with errors. For this reason, researchers have proposed techniques that help them to more easily acquired characteristic curve. One of these methods is the use of fractal geometry. Determining the relationship between particle size distribution fractal dimension (DPSD) and fractal dimension retention curve (DSWRC) can be useful. However, the full information of many soil data is not available from the grading curve and only three components (clay, silt and sand) are measured. In recent decades, the use of fractal geometry as a useful tool and a bridge between the physical concept models and experimental parameters have been used. Due to the fact that both the solid phase of soil and soil pore space themselves are relatively similar, each of them can express different fractal characteristics of the soil. Materials and Methods: This study aims to determine DPSD using data soon found in the soil and creates a relationship between DPSD and DSWRC. To do this selection, 54 samples from Northern Iran and the six classes loam, <b>clay</b> <b>loam,</b> <b>clay</b> loam, sandy clay, silty loam and sandy loam were classified. To get the fractal dimension (DSWRC) Tyler and Wheatcraft (27) retention curve equation was used. Alsothe fractal dimension particle size distribution (DPSD) using equation Tyler and Wheatcraft (28) is obtained. To determine the grading curve in the range of 1 to 1000 micron particle radius of the percentage amounts of clay, silt and sand soil, the method by Skaggs et al (24) using the following equation was used. DPSD developed using gradation curves (Dm 1) and three points (sand, silt and clay) (Dm 2), respectively. After determining the fractal dimension and fractal dimension retention curve gradation curve, regression relationship between fractal dimension is created. Results and Discussion: The results showed that the fractal dimension of particle size distributions obtained with both methods were not significantly different from each other. DSWRCwas also using the suction-moisture. The results indicate that all three fractal dimensions related to soil texture and clay content of the soil increases. Linear regression relationships between Dm 1 and Dm 2 with DSWRC was created using 48 soil samples in order to determine the coefficient of 0. 902 and 0. 871. Then, based on relationships obtained from the four methods (1 - Dm 1 = DSWRC, 2 -regression equationswere obtained Dm 1, 3 - Dm 2 = DSWRC and 4. The regression equation obtained Dm 2. DSWRC expression was used to express DSWRC. Various models for the determination of soil moisture suction according to statistical indicators normalized root mean square error, mean error, relative error. And mean geometric modeling efficiency was evaluated. The results of all four fractalsare close to each other and in most soils it is consistent with the measured data. Models predict the ability to work well in sandy loam soil fractal models and the predicted measured moisture value is less than the estimated fractal dimension- less than its actual value is the moisture curve. Conclusions: In this study, the work of Skaggs et al. (24) was used and it was amended by Fooladmand and Sepaskhah (8) grading curve using the percentage of developed sand, silt and clay. The fractal dimension of the particle size distribution was obtained. The fractal dimension particle size of the radius of the particle size of sand, silt and clay were used, respectively. In general, the study of fractals to simulate the effectiveness of retention curve proved successful. And soon it was found that the use of data, such as sand, silt and clay retention curve can be estimated with reasonable accuracy...|$|E
5000|$|Loam is soil {{composed}} {{mostly of}} sand (particle size > 63 µm), silt (particle size > 2 µm), {{and a smaller}} amount of clay (particle size < 2 µm). Its composition is about 40-40-20% concentration of sand-silt-clay, respectively. These proportions can vary to a degree, however, and result in different types of loam soils: sandy <b>loam,</b> silty <b>loam,</b> <b>clay</b> <b>loam,</b> sandy <b>clay</b> <b>loam,</b> silty <b>clay</b> <b>loam,</b> and loam. In the USDA textural classification triangle, the only soil that is not predominantly sand, silt, or clay is called [...] "loam". Loam soils generally contain more nutrients, moisture, and humus than sandy soils, have better drainage and infiltration of water and air than silt and clay-rich soils, and are easier to till than clay soils. The different types of loam soils each have slightly different characteristics, with some draining liquids more efficiently than others. The mineral composition of a loam soil is typically about 40% sand, 40% silt and 20% clay by weight. The soil's texture, especially its ability to retain nutrients and water are crucial. Loam soil is suitable for growing most plant varieties.|$|R
50|$|Buenavista is {{primarily}} upland municipality characterized by ragged terrain, generally hilly or mountainous with high plains, valleys and swamps. It lies on different slopes from 0-15% and above. There are three (3) types of soil {{that covers the}} municipality. These are Faraon <b>Clay,</b> Catanauan <b>Clay</b> <b>loam</b> and Bolinao <b>Clay</b> <b>loam.</b> This is the most extensive upland soil of the province mostly found in Bondoc Peninsula. Faraon <b>Clay</b> <b>loam</b> covers about 13,133.75 hectares which is 85% of the total land area of the municipality, 10%is said to be catanauan <b>Clay</b> <b>loam</b> and 5% of the total land area in Bolinao <b>Clay</b> <b>loam.</b> The greater portion of the soil types is used for grazing. The low-lying hills are planted to coconut and seasonal crops like corn, root crops, and fruit bearing trees.|$|R
30|$|Soil texture has a {{valuable}} role in groundwater potential.
