50|$|The trunks for DID {{service are}} unidirectional, inbound to the <b>customer</b> <b>PBX.</b> However, the service may be {{combined}} with direct outward dialing (DOD) allowing PBX extensions direct outbound calling capability with identification of their DID telephone number.|$|R
50|$|For {{direct inward dialing}} service, the {{telephone}} company provides one or more trunk lines to the customer for connection to the <b>customer's</b> <b>PBX,</b> and allocates a range of telephone numbers to the customer. Calls to such numbers are forwarded to the <b>customer's</b> <b>PBX</b> via the trunks. As calls are presented to the PBX, the dialed telephone number is signaled to the PBX with Dialed Number Identification Service (DNIS) using a prearranged, usually partial format, e.g., the last four digits. The PBX may use this information to route the call directly to a telephone extension within the organization {{without the need for}} an operator or attendant. The service provides inbound telephone service for many telephone numbers requiring {{only a limited number of}} physical telecommunication circuits to satisfy the average concurrent usage by the customer.|$|R
5000|$|The term {{is often}} used in {{referring}} to a VoIP trunking service that provides the ability for calls to originate on the PSTN and be delivered to a customer's VoIP endpoint. It {{is often referred to}} as [...] "DID" [...] (for Direct Inward Dialing) which more properly refers to a service entirely within the PSTN where individual PSTN numbers can terminate on a <b>customer's</b> <b>PBX.</b>|$|R
50|$|In {{contrast}} to PBX conferencing systems, the two calls are {{joined at the}} Central Office switch, {{rather than at the}} <b>customer</b> premises <b>PBX.</b>|$|R
50|$|A smartnumber is a {{new type}} of voice {{continuity}} number where instead of storing the telephone number in the local BT telephone exchange, it is instead stored in BT's voice continuity 'cloud'. Calls made to a smartnumber can be delivered to any handset anywhere in the UK or the world, thus protecting a company from loss of a telephone exchange, loss of the ISDN or SIP circuits connecting the company to the telephone exchange, loss of the <b>customers</b> <b>PBX</b> on their premises or denial of access to their business premises. Should any of these circumstances occur, the company can use a web-based portal to change the call routing to individual numbers or to large groups of telephone numbers at the same time.|$|R
50|$|For a {{protocol}} that began {{life in the}} 1980s, DPNSS is natively {{a long way from}} VoIP. However, many of the hybrid VoIP PBXs available from manufacturers worldwide provide on-board DPNSS trunk cards. Where they do not, {{a protocol}} converter is necessary. Commercially available equipment offers the ability to convert from DPNSS to Q.Sig. Note that it is also possible to tunnel DPNSS and its associated PCM (G711) over an IP network. This can be point to point where the IP network carries packetised voice N x 64 Kbs speech and a separate IP signalling channel to carry the notional 64 Kbs of DPNSS signalling. A more sophisticated solution uses intelligence {{on the edge of the}} IP network to route voice to the correct node. This is a Voice VPN.Note that this should not be confused with the pre-VOIP 'Voice VPN' deployed by routing calls intelligently in a TDM switching platform, often Nortel DMS100 and <b>customers</b> <b>PBX</b> nodes.|$|R
50|$|West’s Interactive Services line of {{business}} designs, delivers, integrates, manages and optimizes communications applications, services, platforms and networks. West’s technology is considered “omnichannel,” including voice, text, email, push notification, fax, video, web, social media and cloud contact center channels. In most cases, West technology interfaces with a client’s internal systems, such as <b>PBX,</b> <b>customer</b> relationship management and enterprise reporting platforms.|$|R
2500|$|A {{group of}} Nortel alumni have {{created their own}} company, named E-MetroTel, to {{continue}} evolving the Nortel product into a next generation product line called the UCX. [...] Based in Plano, Texas, the company consists {{of a group of}} Nortel engineers and developers who worked on the Nortel Meridian 1, CS1000, CS2100, Meridian Norstar, Business Communication Manager, and SCS platforms, while employed at Nortel. They offer support for some Nortel products. Nortel <b>PBX</b> <b>customers</b> can reuse their phones, line cards and cabinets with their UCX PBX solution.|$|R
50|$|Virtual PBX {{systems or}} hosted PBX systems deliver PBX {{functionality}} as a service, available over the {{public switched telephone network}} (PSTN) or the Internet. Hosted PBXs are typically {{provided by a}} telephone company or service provider, using equipment located in the premises of a telephone exchange or the provider's data center. This means the customer does not need to buy or install PBX equipment. Generally the service is provided by a lease agreement and the provider can, in some configurations, use the same switching equipment to service multiple hosted <b>PBX</b> <b>customers.</b>|$|R
50|$|Before {{a manual}} {{exchange}} was converted to automatic, changes to allocated numbers to facilitate PBX hunting groups were required. In SXS automatic exchanges only some number groups have <b>PBX</b> hunting <b>facility,</b> and within those number groups the main and other numbers in a hunting group {{have to be}} in a certain order. If TUDor 2725 (say) was to be the listed (main) number subsequent numbers must be 2726, 2727, 2728 2729 & 2720; and the PBX hunting group on 2725 is limited to a maximum of 6 incoming lines (although the PBX could also have additional outgoing-only lines to the exchange). A PBX group with 10 PBX-hunting lines would commence with 2721 (say) to 2720, and PBX hunting groups requiring more than 10 incoming lines would be served by special 11-and-over PBX final selectors which could search over several (10-line) levels in succession.|$|R
