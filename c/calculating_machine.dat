25|$|A {{mechanical}} calculator, or <b>calculating</b> <b>machine,</b> was {{a mechanical}} device used to perform automatically the basic operations of arithmetic.

25|$|The {{principle}} of the clock (input wheels and display wheels added to a clock like mechanism) for a direct entry <b>calculating</b> <b>machine</b> couldn't be implemented to create a fully effective <b>calculating</b> <b>machine</b> without additional innovation with the technological capabilities of the 17th century. because their gears would jam when a carry had to be moved several places along the accumulator. The only 17th century calculating clocks that have survived to this day {{do not have a}} machine wide carry mechanism and therefore cannot be called fully effective mechanical calculators. A much more successful calculating clock was built by the Italian Giovanni Poleni in the 18th century and was a two-motion calculating clock (the numbers are inscribed first and then they are processed).|$|E

25|$|Wilhelm Schickard, a German polymath, {{designed}} a <b>calculating</b> <b>machine</b> in 1623 which combined a mechanised form of Napier's rods with the world's first mechanical adding machine {{built into the}} base.

25|$|American George Barnard Grant {{started working}} on his <b>calculating</b> <b>machine</b> in 1869, unaware {{of the works of}} Babbage and Scheutz (Schentz).

The only two Grillet machines known have no carry mechanism, displaying three lines of nine independent dials they also have nine rotating napier's rod for multiplication and division. Contrary to Grillet's claim, it was not a mechanical calculator after all.|$|E
25|$|While thought-capable {{artificial}} beings {{appeared as}} storytelling devices in antiquity, {{the idea of}} actually {{trying to build a}} machine to perform useful reasoning may have begun with Ramon Llull (c. 1300 CE). With his Calculus ratiocinator, Gottfried Leibniz extended the concept of the <b>calculating</b> <b>machine</b> (Wilhelm Schickard engineered the first one around 1623), intending to perform operations on concepts rather than numbers. Since the 19th century, artificial beings are common in fiction, as in Mary Shelley's Frankenstein or Karel Čapek's R.U.R. (Rossum's Universal Robots).|$|E
25|$|It was in Paris, also, that Huygens met {{the young}} diplomat Gottfried Leibniz, there in 1672 on a vain mission to meet Arnauld de Pomponne, the French Foreign Minister. At this time Leibniz {{was working on}} a <b>calculating</b> <b>machine,</b> and he moved on to London in early 1673 with diplomats from Mainz; but from March 1673 Leibniz was tutored in {{mathematics}} by Huygens. Huygens taught him analytical geometry; an extensive correspondence ensued, in which Huygens showed reluctance to accept the advantages of infinitesimal calculus.|$|E

25|$|When {{it became}} clear that France would not {{implement}} its part of Leibniz's Egyptian plan, the Elector sent his nephew, escorted by Leibniz, on a related mission to the English government in London, early in 1673. There Leibniz came into acquaintance of Henry Oldenburg and John Collins. He met with the Royal Society where he demonstrated a <b>calculating</b> <b>machine</b> that he had designed and had been building since 1670. The machine was able to execute all four basic operations (adding, subtracting, multiplying, and dividing), and the society quickly made him an external member.|$|E
25|$|The Olivetti Programma 101 was {{introduced}} in late 1965; it was a stored program machine which could read and write magnetic cards and displayed results on its built-in printer. Memory, implemented by an acoustic delay line, could be partitioned between program steps, constants, and data registers. Programming allowed conditional testing and programs could also be overlaid by reading from magnetic cards. It {{is regarded as the}} first personal computer produced by a company (that is, a desktop electronic <b>calculating</b> <b>machine</b> programmable by non-specialists for personal use). The Olivetti Programma 101 won many industrial design awards.|$|E
25|$|Since the {{negative}} {{answer to the}} halting problem shows that there are problems that cannot be solved by a Turing machine, the Church–Turing thesis limits what {{can be accomplished by}} any machine that implements effective methods. However, not all machines conceivable to human imagination are subject to the Church–Turing thesis (e.g. oracle machines). It is an open question whether there can be actual deterministic physical processes that, in the long run, elude simulation by a Turing machine, and in particular whether any such hypothetical process could usefully be harnessed {{in the form of a}} <b>calculating</b> <b>machine</b> (a hypercomputer) that could solve the halting problem for a Turing machine amongst other things. It is also an open question whether any such unknown physical processes are involved in the working of the human brain, and whether humans can solve the halting problem (Copeland 2004, p.15).|$|E

25|$|By 1865, the Smithsonian Institution began {{a catalog}} of current {{scientific}} papers, which became the International Catalogue of Scientific Papers in 1902. The following year the Royal Society began publication of its Catalogue of Papers in London. In 1868, Christopher Sholes, Carlos Glidden, and S. W. Soule produced the first practical typewriter. By 1872 Lord Kelvin devised an analogue computer to predict the tides, and by 1875 Frank Stephen Baldwin was granted the first US patent for a practical <b>calculating</b> <b>machine</b> that performs four arithmetic functions. Alexander Graham Bell and Thomas Edison invented the telephone and phonograph in 1876 and 1877 respectively, and the American Library Association was founded in Philadelphia. In 1879 Index Medicus was first issued by the Library of the Surgeon General, U.S. Army, with John Shaw Billings as librarian, and later the library issues Index Catalogue, which achieved an international reputation as the most complete catalog of medical literature.|$|E
500|$|From about August 1948, the SSEM was intensively {{developed}} as a prototype for the Manchester Mark 1, initially {{with the aim of}} providing the university with a more realistic computing facility. In October 1948, UK Government Chief Scientist Ben Lockspeiser was given a demonstration of the prototype Mark 1 while on a visit to the University of Manchester. Lockspeiser was so impressed by what he saw that he immediately initiated a government contract with the local firm of Ferranti to make a commercial version of the machine, the Ferranti Mark 1. In his letter to the company, dated 26October 1948, Lockspeiser authorised the company to [...] "proceed on the lines we discussed, namely, to construct an electronic <b>calculating</b> <b>machine</b> to the instructions of Professor F. C. Williams". From that point on, development of the Mark 1 had the additional purpose of supplying Ferranti with a design on which to base their commercial machine. The government's contract with Ferranti ran for five years from November 1948, and involved an estimated £35,000 per year.|$|E
