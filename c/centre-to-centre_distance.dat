40|$|Interferometric {{measurements}} of natural convection-based heat transfer rates around array(s) of heated cylinders have been presented. Experiments {{have been performed}} with single, two cylinders placed {{adjacent to each other}} with varying <b>centre-to-centre</b> <b>distances</b> and three cylinders arranged in a triangular configuration. Mach-Zehnder interferometer has been employed for recording the projection data of temperature field. The interferograms have first been qualitatively interpreted to understand the influence of buoyant plume of one cylinder on the convective phenomena of the other cylinder(s) of the array. Images have then been quantitatively analyzed to retrieve the whole field temperature distributions. Results have been presented in the form of interferometric images, temperature contours, local distribution of heat transfer rates as a function of Rayleigh numbers. Experiments involving two cylinders showed a strong dependence of the net convective phenomena on the relative spacing of the cylinders. While the buoyant plumes originating from each cylinder were almost independent of each other for larger <b>centre-to-centre</b> <b>distances,</b> the plumes were seen to be strongly coupled as the spacing between the cylinders was reduced. Wall heat transfer rates were found to be comparable with those of single cylinder for large cylinder <b>centre-to-centre</b> <b>distances</b> and showed a decreasing trend as the relative spacing is reduced. Experiments on the triangular array of cylinders revealed that the heat transfer rates from the top cylinder were strongly influenced by the thermal plumes rising from the bottom cylinders. The average Nusselt number around the top cylinder in triangular configuration was found to be significantly smaller than that of the single cylinder. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|The flow {{around two}} {{identical}} circular cylinders, arranged in configurations {{where one of}} the cylinders is immersed {{in the wake of the}} other, is studied using numerical simulations. Two aspects of such flows were considered. The first is the stability of nominally two-dimensional time-periodic wakes to three-dimensional perturbations. We investigated flows around tandem and staggered arrangements with diverse <b>centre-to-centre</b> <b>distances.</b> Direct stability analysis and numerical simulations were employed, and the results are compared to those obtained for the flow around an isolated cylinder. The onsets of the three-dimensional instabilities were calculated and the unstable modes are fully described. In addition, we assess the nonlinear character of the bifurcations and physical mechanisms are proposed to explain the instabilities. The second aspect considered in this thesis is the flowinduced vibration experienced by a rigid cylinder when it is mounted on an elastic base and immersed in the wake of a fixed identical cylinder. Tandem arrangements with <b>centre-to-centre</b> <b>distances</b> varying from 1. 5 to 8 cylinder diameters were tested. The flow was simulated using an Arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian approach that coupled the solution of the structure equations with that of the flow. Two- and three- dimensional simulations were performed to assess the mutual influence between the three-dimensional flow structures in the wake and the motion of the cylinder. The response of the downstream cylinder is compared to that of an elastically-mounted rigid isolated cylinder. Based on the simulation results we propose physical mechanisms to explain the origin of the excitation. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceCapes-MEC/BrazilGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

40|$|A {{theory on}} the {{formation}} of moiré patterns by mutually interfering radial gratings is developed. It is shown that the moiré fringes formed inside the circle, which has as diameter the <b>centre-to-centre</b> <b>distance</b> of the gratings, belong to the additive moiré type and they represent families of confocal equilateral hyperbolae. Outside this circle the subtractive moiré pattern is valid, which consists of circles of different radii whose centres lie on the perpendicular bisector of the <b>centre-to-centre</b> <b>distance.</b> For the radial grating moiré gauge the additive moiré pattern is of importance since two sectors of radial gratings are used with a large <b>centre-to-centre</b> <b>distance.</b> The radial gauge is convenient for determining the normal components of strains. The advantage {{of this type of}} gauge over the line grating gauge is that the radial grating corresponds to an infinite number of line gratings of progressively varying pitch. This allows a correct evaluation of displacement and strain at a suitably selected gauge length...|$|E

40|$|Embankment piling is {{a widely}} used {{foundation}} method in geotechnical engineering and the design is mostly based on empirical studies found on experimental or field evidents. Several {{studies have been conducted}} to capture the behaviour of embankment piles by means of numerical models. One of the issues is to simulate the arching effect between the piles. This has raised the question of the optimum pile arrangement. Along the northern coast of Sweden, where soft soil types and dense woodlands are common, timber piles have often been used in piled road and railway embankments. The pile group is designed as a semi-floating deep foundation in soft soil, where the piles are resting on top of the locally common firm glacial till bottom layer, naming the method light embankment piling.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this work was to {{evaluate}} the possible gain in tissue sparing in hadrontherapy when a spatial fractionation of the dose is used. Monte Carlo simulations (GATE v. 6) {{have been used as}} a method to assess the dose distributions in a cylindrical water phantom (16 cm height and 16 cm of diameter). The phantom was irradiated with carbon and oxygen minibeams of 0. 7 mm of beam width, and with protons in a grid geometry configuration. Several <b>centre-to-centre</b> <b>distances,</b> covering a 2 x 2 cm 2 area, have been taken into account. The ratio of the peak-to-valley doses (PVDR) and the penumbrae was used as evaluation parameter, since PVDR {{is considered to be a}} very relevant dosimetric parameter for tissue sparing. Extremely high PVDRs values and very narrow penumbrae were obtained in all depths. This means that this new way of dose delivery might allow the use of higher and potentially curative doses in clinical cases where tissue tolerances are a limit to achieve a curative treatment. The high PVDR obtained and the small penumbrae in comparison with existing radiosurgery techniques, suggest a potential gain in healthy tissue sparing in those new techniques...|$|R

40|$|In {{this thesis}} {{different}} models are considered which {{can deal with}} the interaction between pile foundations and structures. This to find {{the most efficient way to}} model pile foundation structures whereby both the efficiency of the design as building process are taken into account. This are the models D-Pile (geotechnical), Scia Engineer (structural) and Plaxis (geotechnical). Therefore a study is done to the effects which play a role by pile foundation structures and or the different models can deal with this. The study focused on displacement piles which is the most used pile type in the Dutch building practice. The reference project which is used for this study is the foundation structure of a power pylon (as shown in figure 1) To get trust in the models after this study a verification is done for single piles which were subjected to an axial (compression and tension) and horizontal load on top. For piles loaded by axial compression the load-settlement behaviour is compared with the behaviour as one can determine according to NEN 9997 - 1 (EC 7). Hereby one can see that the fact that the numerical model Plaxis does not take into account the installation effects (densification and displacement of the soil around the pile) leads to a deviating load-settlement behaviour in comparison with the behaviour of the other models which are based on empirical relationship (pile tests). This behaviour can be improved by additional tricks like volume expansions of the soil around the pile, but this is not taken into account in this thesis. So therefore Plaxis was not taken into account furthermore. After the verification of single piles, the verification was expanded for pile groups which was subjected to the same loading conditions. Hereby variations were made in the <b>centre-to-centre</b> <b>distances</b> of the piles and the thickness of the cap on top. Hereby can be noticed that the fact that D-Pile cannot take into account the bending stiffness of the pile cap can lead to an unrealistic distribution of pile forces in case of a thin plate with large <b>centre-to-centre</b> <b>distances</b> of the piles. On the other hand the additional settlement of a pile group in comparison with a single pile cannot be taken into account with the chose way of modeling in Scia Engineer, but only by D-Pile. The behaviour of pile groups loaded by tension can differ significant from single piles This effect has to be taken into account manually in both models. For a horizontally loaded group there is a significant difference in results in the bending moments in the pile heads and the displacement of the pile cap, which is caused by the different horizontal springs used in the models. Combining all these knowledge leads to the conclusion that Scia Engineer seems to be the best model for the design of the foundation structure of the power pylon. Hereby both the efficiency of the design process and the structure are taken into account. The reassons for this are: 9 ̆ 5 Besides D-Foundation which is a tool to determine the bearing capacity only one model is needed to analyse the behaviour of the piles and the foundation structure. This model is also used by the structural engineer to determine the distribution of forces and the reinforcement in the structure. 9 ̆ 5 The load-displacement behaviour of (tension) piles is governed by springs which are easy to adjust and it is easy to check if the behaviour is in line with the applicable standards. This is especially the case for tension piles, for which the bearing capacity is dependent on the pile-to-pile distance and the alternation between tensile and compressive loads.

40|$|International audienceMicrobeam {{radiation}} therapy (MRT) uses highly collimated, quasi-parallel arrays of X-ray microbeams of 50 - 600 keV, produced by third generation synchrotron sources, {{such as the}} European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF), in France. The main advantages of highly brilliant synchrotron sources are an extremely high dose rate and very small beam divergence. High dose rates are necessary to deliver therapeutic doses in microscopic volumes, to avoid spreading of the microbeams by cardiosynchronous movement of the tissues. The minimal beam divergence results in the advantage of steeper dose gradients delivered to a tumor target, thus achieving a higher dose deposition in the target volume in fractions of seconds, with a sharper penumbra than that produced in conventional radiotherapy. MRT research over the past 20 years has yielded many results from preclinical trials based on different animal models, including mice, rats, piglets and rabbits. Typically, MRT uses arrays of narrow (approximately 25 - 100 microm wide) microplanar beams separated by wider (100 - 400 microm centre-to-centre) microplanar spaces. The height of these microbeams typically varies from 1 to 100 mm, depending on the target and the desired preselected field size to be irradiated. Peak entrance doses of several hundreds of Gy are surprisingly well tolerated by normal tissues, up to approximately 2 yr after irradiation, {{and at the same}} time show a preferential damage of malignant tumor tissues; these effects of MRT have now been extensively studied over nearly two decades. More recently, some biological in vivo effects of synchrotron X-ray beams in the millimeter range (0. 68 - 0. 95 mm, <b>centre-to-centre</b> <b>distances</b> 1. 2 - 4 mm), which may differ to some extent from those of microscopic beams, have been followed up to approximately 7 months after irradiation. Comparisons between broad-beam irradiation and MRT indicate a higher tumor control for the same sparing of normal tissue in the latter, even if a substantial fraction of tumor cells are not receiving a radiotoxic level of radiation. The hypothesis of a selective radiovulnerability of the tumor vasculature versus normal blood vessels by MRT, and of the cellular and molecular mechanisms involved remains under investigation. The paper highlights the history of MRT including salient biological findings after microbeam irradiation with emphasis on the vascular components and the tolerance of the central nervous system.

These acceptor units were linked at different sites (at the ortho, meta or para positions of one of the phenyl groups of meso-tetraphenylporphyrin) to the donor porphyrins such that the resulting isomeric intramolecular donor-acceptor complexes exhibit different <b>centre-to-centre</b> (ctc) <b>distances</b> and relative orientations. Biexponential fluorescence decay profiles observed for several of these covalently linked complexes were rationalized in terms of the presence of ''closed'' and ''extended'' conformers. Detailed analyses of the fluorescence decay data have provided a comprehensive understanding of the photoinduced electron transfer (PET) reactions occurring in systems containing zinc(II) porphyrin donors. It is observed that although DNB-linked zinc(II) complexes follow the trends predicted for the efficiency of PET with respect to donor-acceptor distance, the TNB-linked zinc(II) porphyrins exhibit a behaviour which is dictated by steric effects. Similarly, although the thermodynamic criteria predict a greater efficiency of charge separation in TNB-linked complexes compared with DNB-linked complexes, the reverse trend observed has been attributed to orientational effects. In the complexes containing free-base porphyrin donors, PET is expected to be less efficient from a thermodynamic viewpoint. In a few of these cases, fluorescence quenching seems to occur by parallel mechanisms other than PET...|$|R
40|$|Nowadays {{football}} stadium encounter {{a lot of}} problems. Often services are outdated and the capacity is often too large or too small. These capacity problems especially occur in stadium that are built for major tournaments. When the tournament is finished, no appropriate tenants can be found and the stadium often remains empty. Another problem for a {{football stadium}} is the infrequent use. Most stadiums are in use only 20 - 25 times a year. Because these times are spread relatively even throughout the year, there are no large periods in which construction or refurbishment can happen. Besides all this, football stadium are unique structures, which require a large investment. Football clubs are often not capable of making such an investment. A lot of possible solutions are researched in the past, such as a demountable stadium or a modular, that can easily be enlarged or reduced by adding or removing extra modules. In this research another possible solution to these problems is drafted. By structurally uncoupling the grandstand structures and the roof structure, a lot of possibilities arise for the stadium. Grandstand structures can easily be enlarged or reduced, services can be refurbished without extensive construction and even movable grandstands can be designed. By moving the grandstand, the stadium can become suitable for other sports or events. Besides the extra possibilities that arise, uncoupling the two structures also causes the opportunity to design both structures in a structurally efficient way. Bendingmoments can be prevented as much as possible,which makes the structure much more efficient. A lot of material can be saved, making the total stadium much cheaper. In this research the roof structure is designed. The starting point in this design was that the structure should be optimal with regards to material usage. Different shapes are designed, which are compared by both structural and functional aspects. A few systems are selected {{that will be used}} for the preliminary calculations. In the preliminary calculations each of the different systems is calculated and optimised with Karamba and Galapagos. The total self-weights of the systems are compared and the best scoring system is analyzed further. This final system is then modeled parametrically. Multiple parameters, like the height, <b>centre-to-centre</b> <b>distances</b> and the different cross-sections, are optimised to determine the optimal design with regards to material usage. After all parameters are optimised, the final design is calculated thoroughly. The results of these calculations are compared to similar structures to check if it really is an optimal design. From the results it follows that similar structures have a larger self-weight. This shows that the design in this research is indeed an appropriate alternative compared to more traditional stadium designs. Besides the final design, also some design options are researched to see their influence on the structural behaviour of the roof structure. These design options are, for instance, a slightly different shape or a roof with a hole in it. These options can be seen as extras for the design. The determination of the structural consequences of these extras show how much they influence the total price of the system. Building Engineerin...|$|R

40|$|The Bog Ecosystem Research Initiative (BERI) {{project was}} {{initiated}} to investigate, at five climatically different sites across Europe, {{the effects of}} elevated CO 2 and N deposition on the net exchange of CO 2 and CH 4 between bogs and the atmosphere, and to {{study the effects of}} elevated CO 2 and N deposition on the plant biodiversity of bog communities. A major challenge to investigate the effects of elevated CO 2 on vegetation and ecosystems is to apply elevated CO 2 concentrations to growing vegetation without changing the physical conditions like climate and radiation. Most available CO 2 enrichment methods disturb the natural conditions to some degree, for instance closed chambers or open top chambers. Free Air CO 2 Enrichment (FACE) systems have proven to be suitable to expose plants to elevated CO 2 concentrations with minimal disturbance of their natural environment. The size and spatial scale of the vegetation studied within the BERI project allowed the use of a modified version of a small FACE system called MiniFACE. This paper describes the BERI MiniFACE design as well as its temporal and spatial performance at the five BERI field locations. The temporal performance of the MiniFACE system largely met the quality criteria defined by the FACE Protocol. One minute average CO 2 concentrations measured at the centre of the ring stayed within 20 ␘f the pre-set target for more than 95 ␘f the time. Increased wind speeds were found to improve the MiniFACE system's temporal performance. Spatial analyses showed no apparent CO 2 gradients across a ring during a 4 day period and the mean differences between each sampling point and the centre of the ring did not exceed 10 ÐObservations made during a windy day, causing a CO 2 concentration gradient, and observations made during a calm day indicated that short term gradients tend to average out over longer periods of time. On a day with unidirectional strong winds, CO 2 concentrations at the upwind side of the ring centre were higher than those made at the centre and at the downwind side of the ring centre, but the bell-shaped distribution was found basically the same for the centre and the four surrounding measurement points, implying that the short term (1 sec) variability of CO 2 concentrations across the MiniFACE ring is almost the same at any point in the ring.

Using the optically detected magnetic resonance technique and the fluorescence fading method, the zero field splitting parameters (D and E) and the kinetic constants of the lowest excited triplet state have been determined for homo-dimers of the free base (H 2 TPP) 2 , of the zinc- compound (ZnTPP) 2 and for mixed dimers. These triplet state parameters can be compared with the results for both monomers. It is found that for the homodimers the results are the same as for the corresponding monomers. Also, no singlet-singlet energy transfer is observed, due to a very small overlap of the fluorescence and absorption spectra. For the mixed dimers we find the same triplet state parameters as for H 2 TPP, due to efficient singlet-singlet energy transfer (vide infra). From our results it can be concluded that the triplet states of both macrocycles in a TPP dimer can be considered as isolated from each other. This is not unexpected, since the triplet excitonic interaction is predicted to be small, due to the small S 0 -T 0 oscillator strength. Thus triplet-triplet energy transfer is unlikely to occur. Triplet excitonic interactions are expected to be observable by magnetic resonance techniques for much shorter distances between both porphyrin rings, than occur in our dimers. The average distance between the centres of both porphyrin macrocycles can be determined, using the spin-spin interaction between two paramagnetic ions, inserted into each of the porphyrin rings. This interaction is observable as a broadening in the solid state EPR powder spectra of Cu-Cu dimers. From these measurements the distances between ring centres in apolar solvents can be determined as: para-para (p,p) dimer 2. 7, ortho-para (o,p) dimer 2. 2 and ortho-ortho (o,o) dimer 2. 1 nm. In polar solvents the relatively apolar porphyrin macrocycles are forced together, resulting in a shorter ring-ring distance. Steric hindrance of the phenyl groups can prevent this folding, however, for some of the dimers. The results obtained by this method are in good agreement with the distances derived from space filling models. It can also be concluded that an endoconformation (cofacial) for the o,o dimer is highly unlikely and that the preferential orientation is the exo- conformation, a situation very similar to the p,p dimer. These results are also confirmed by NMR measurements. We have performed a theoretical analysis of excitonic interaction on the Soret absorptionband. From this analysis, taking into account the presence of proton tautomers in free base porphyrin monomers and -dimers, the energy level shifts are determined as a function of the rotational angle around the linking chain. Comparing the theoretical and experimental data, the preferential orientation, determined from the shift and/or splitting of the absorption band, and the rotational angular distribution, determined by the bandwidth w. r. t. that of the monomer, can be found. For the p,p dimer the porphyrin macrocycles are approximately coplanar with a narrow orientational distribution; the o,o dimer has an exo-conformation and also coplanar macrocycles with a very narrow angular distribution. For the o,p dimer the result is an average perpendicular position of the porphyrin rings, but with a large rotational freedom. Because of steric effects of the bulky phenyl groups the spread in rotation does not extend over the full 2 πrange. In covalently linked metal porphyrins, containing two different metal ions or consisting of a mixed metallo-free base porphyrin, singlet- singlet energy transfer occurs. We have analyzed S-S energy transfer between the zinc-containing and free base moieties in TPP dimers by emission spectroscopy and fluorescence kinetics. From fluorescence and fluorescence-excitation spectra the energy transfer efficiency, the rate of energy transfer, the lifetime of the donor fluorescence and the donor- acceptor distance can be calculated and compared with the results from fluorescence decay experiments. Both sets of values are in very good agreement. The donor-acceptor distance is also in agreement with the distance found by other methods. For the dimers the energy transfer rate constant is ≈ 2 magnitudes higher than that for intersystem crossing and the fluorescence decay, corresponding to an energy transfer efficiency of ≈ 85 %. The energy transfer rate constant is dependent on &lt;r - 6 >, as well as on the relative orientation of the transition dipole moments. Due to the perpendicular position of both porphyrin macrocycles in the o,p dimer the energy transfer rate constant is lower than in the p,p dimer, although the distance between both rings is much shorter. From all measurements, it can be concluded that the properties of the singlet and triplet states of the o,o dimer, are very similar to those of the p,p dimer, apart from the distance effect. The o,p dimer has in some cases a different behaviour, due to the different position and orientation of the porphyrin macrocycles w. r. t. each other in comparison with the other two dimers.

40|$|In this work, we {{considered}} the flow around two circular cylinders of equal diameter placed {{in tandem with}} respect to the incident uniform flow. The upstream cylinder was fixed and the downstream cylinder was completely free to move in the cross-stream direction, with no spring or damper attached to it. The <b>centre-to-centre</b> <b>distance</b> between the cylinders was four diameters, and the Reynolds number was varied from 100 to 645. We performed two- and three-dimensional simulations of this flow using a Spectral/hp element method to discretise the flow equations, coupled to a simple Newmark integration routine that solves the equation of the dynamics of the cylinder. The differences of the behaviours observed in the two- and three-dimensional simulations are highlighted and the data is analysed under the light of previously published experimental results obtained for higher Reynolds numbers.

The reverse transcriptase (p 66 /p 51) is a flat molecule, which can be approximated by an ellipsoid with the half axes of 5. 2 nm, 4. 8 nm and 1. 4 nm. The two subunits p 51 and p 66 having a <b>centre-to-centre</b> <b>distance</b> of 3. 3 +/- 0. 3 nm are attached at their flat sides, slightly shifted sideways.

40|$|The {{wake flow}} {{patterns}} associated with flow past a cylinder and a cylinder-pair in tandem configuration are revisited, compared, and evaluated {{with respect to}} the streamline patterns generated based on potential flow theory and superposition of various potential flow elements. The wakes, which are vortex shedding in the lee of the cylinder(s), are reproduced by placing pairs of equal but opposite circulation elements in the potential flow field. The strength of the circulation elements determines the size of the vortices produced. The streamline patterns of flow past a pair of unequal cylinders in tandem configuration provide an indirect means to establish the threshold condition for the wake transition from that of a single bluff body to alternating reattachment behavior. This threshold condition is found to be a function of the diameter ratio, d/D (diameters d and D, d≤D), spacing ratio, L/D (<b>centre-to-centre</b> <b>distance,</b> L, to cylinder diameter, D), and equivalent incident flow speed, U. A unique functional relationship f (L/D, d/D, U) of this threshold condition is established...|$|E
40|$|A {{three-dimensional}} numerical wave flume {{is employed}} {{to investigate the}} forces exerted by internal solitary waves (ISWs) {{on a pair of}} circular cylinders in tandem arrangement, using large-eddy simulation (LES) model. The effect of the <b>centre-to-centre</b> <b>distance</b> (L) ranging from 1. 5 to 5 diameters (D) is studied for various ISWs amplitudes (ηa) in the two-layer fluid system. Vertical-averaged vorticity distribution and vertical-averaged pressure gradient distribution in each layer are presented to investigate the different hydrodynamic interference between cylinders and the ISWs forces on each cylinder at various L. Furthermore, the force behaviors of the two cylinders are also compared with that of an isolated cylinder in the same environment. The interaction between the two piles occurs in both layers, and it is found that, for 1. 5 ≤L/D< 3. 5, strong mutual interference appears between two cylinders; for 3. 5 ≤L/D< 5, the two cylinders continue to influence each other in a weak-interference state; for L/D≥ 5, the interaction gradually decreases into a noninteracting state.

40|$|In {{order to}} reduce the {{vibration}} transmission in multi-storey wood buildings, it is common to insert viscoelastic elastomer materials between parts of the buildings. The studies presented here investigate to which extent different design choices for the elastomer layers affect the isolation of low-frequency vibrations (0 - 100 Hz). A finite element model of two storeys of a multi-storey wood building, involving blocks of elastomer material in between the storeys, was used to perform numerical investigations. Parametric studies were carried out, considering different properties of the elastomer material and different placements of the elastomer blocks. Considering the transmission from the floor of the upper storey to the underlying ceiling, the material properties of the elastomer material were found to affect the vibration levels appreciably. A too stiff elastomer material can result in an amplification of the vibration levels in the ceiling for certain frequencies, whilst a less stiff material, in general, reduces the vibration transmission. The placement of the elastomer blocks was varied by shifting the position of the blocks while maintaining their <b>centre-to-centre</b> <b>distance,</b> resulting in a small effect on the vibration levels...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. A physics-based {{computational}} model was utilised {{to better understand}} the interactions of fires generated by burning of neighbouring shrubs. The model included large-eddy simulation for flow field turbulence and a two-phase approach for the coupling of solid fuel and gas phases. Two different arrangements consisting of two and three identical shrubs placed adjacent to each other were considered. All shrubs were simultaneously ignited from their base with the aid of separate ground fuels. Both crown and ground fuels were modelled as porous media with thermophysical properties of chamise and excelsior respectively. Modelling results indicated that the peakmass-loss rate and the vertical fire spread rate within a shrub decrease when the shrub separation distance increases. At zero separation, heat release rate normalised by the number of shrubs is enhanced by 5 and 15 % for the two-shrub and the three-shrub arrangements, respectively. Generation of strong vorticity by higher gravitational torque appeared to be the cause for enhanced burning in the three-shrub arrangement. This effect was seen to be much weaker for the two-shrub arrangement. Interactions between the individual fires cease for a <b>centre-to-centre</b> <b>distance</b> of 1. 5 and 2 times the shrub diameter for the two-shrub and the three-shrub arrangement respectively...|$|E
40|$|We {{investigate}} two-dimensional liquid bridges trapped between {{pairs of}} identical horizontal cylinders. The cylinders support forces due to surface tension and hydrostatic pressure which balance {{the weight of}} the liquid. The shape of the liquid bridge is determined by analytically solving the nonlinear Laplace-Young equation. Parameters that maximize the trapping capacity (defined as the cross-sectional area of the liquid bridge) are then determined. The results show that these parameters can be approximated with simple relationships when the radius of the cylinders is small compared to the capillary length. For such small cylinders, liquid bridges with the largest cross sectional area occur when the <b>centre-to-centre</b> <b>distance</b> between the cylinders is approximately twice the capillary length. The maximum trapping capacity for a pair of cylinders at a given separation is linearly related to the separation when it is small compared to the capillary length. The meniscus slope angle of the largest liquid bridge produced in this regime is also a linear function of the separation. We additionally derive approximate solutions for the profile of a liquid bridge making use of the linearized Laplace-Young equation. These solutions analytically verify the above relationships obtained for the maximization of the trapping capacity.
