5|$|Such strategies, which {{minimize}} the maximum loss for each player, are called optimal. Von Neumann showed that their minimaxes are equal (in absolute value) and contrary (in sign). Von Neumann improved and extended the minimax theorem to include games involving imperfect information and games {{with more than}} two players, publishing this result in his 1944 Theory of Games and Economic Behavior (written with Oskar Morgenstern). Morgenstern {{wrote a paper on}} game theory and thought he would show it to von Neumann because of his interest in the subject. He read it and said to Morgenstern that he should put more in it. This was repeated a <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>times,</b> <b>and</b> then von Neumann became a coauthor and the paper became 100 pages long. Then it became a book. The public interest in this work was such that The New York Times ran a front-page story. In this book, von Neumann declared that economic theory needed to use functional analytic methods, especially convex sets and topological fixed-point theorem, rather than the traditional differential calculus, because the maximum-operator did not preserve differentiable functions.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. We {{introduce}} a new level set method for motion in normal direction. It {{is based on a}} formulation {{in the form of a}} second order forward-backward diffusion equation. The equation is discretized by the finite volume method. We propose a semi-implicit time discretization taking into account the forward diffusion part of the solution in an implicit way, while the backward diffusion part is treated explicitly. When forward diffusion dominates, a straightforward reconstruction of the solution is used, while larger (smoothing) stencils are used when backward diffusion dominates. The method is precise on coarse grids and is second order accurate for smooth solutions. Numerical experiments show an optimal <b>coupling</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> <b>and</b> space steps with τ = h, and no stronger CFL condition is required. Numerical tests with the scheme are discussed on representative examples...|$|R
