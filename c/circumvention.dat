5|$|One {{question}} of constitutional interpretation that was highlighted during the parliamentary debates pertained {{to the former}} Article 22H which had been incorrectly inserted into the Constitution by the Constitution (Amendment) Act 1991 in January 1991. Article 22H(1) provided that the President might, acting in his discretion, withhold his assent to any bill passed by Parliament (other than a bill to which Article 5(2A) applied) if the bill provided for the <b>circumvention</b> or curtailment of the discretionary powers conferred upon him by the Constitution. At that time, Article 5(2A), which entrenched certain core constitutional provisions (of which Article 22H(1) was one) by requiring {{the approval of the}} electorate at a national referendum for their amendment, had not been brought into force.|$|E

5|$|The {{first two}} years of Garrard's second term were {{relatively}} uneventful, but in the 1802 General Assembly, legislators approved two bills related to the circuit court system that Garrard vetoed. The first bill expanded the number of courts and provided that untrained citizens could sit as judges in the court system. Garrard questioned the cost of the additional courts and the wisdom of allowing untrained judges on the bench; he also objected to the bill's <b>circumvention</b> of the governor's authority to appoint judges. The second bill allowed attorneys and judges in the circuit court system to reside outside the districts they served. The General Assembly overrode Garrard's second veto, marking the first time in Kentucky history that a gubernatorial veto was overridden and the only time during Garrard's eight-year tenure.|$|E
5|$|By {{succeeding}} her husband, Ranavalona {{became the}} first female sovereign of the Kingdom of Imerina {{since its founding in}} 1540. Her rise to power occurred in a cultural milieu that favored men over women in the political sphere. In the traditional culture of Imerina, rulers were specially endowed with the power to innovate in <b>circumvention</b> of established norms and customs. Sovereigns often mobilized innovation through the creation of new forms of kinship, the traditional basis of the political order. Women, however, were associated with the household, a rigid kinship unit in opposition to the innovating role and power of the sovereign, and so were not viewed as suited to rule. Although female rulers had once been common among the Vazimba, described in oral histories as the original inhabitants of Madagascar, this tradition ended in the central highlands with the reign of Andriamanelo (1540–1575), founder of the Kingdom of Imerina and successor to his Vazimba mother, Queen Rafohy (1530–1540).|$|E

5|$|In August 1994, Parliament {{intended}} to amend Article 22H {{to restrict the}} President's powers thereunder to only non-constitutional bills which provided for the <b>circumvention</b> or curtailment of the President's discretionary powers conferred upon him by the Constitution.

President Ong Teng Cheong stated that in the interest of testing out the system, he wished to have this question referred to the courts for a ruling, and that he would accept as correct whatever interpretation of Article 22H was given by the court. In response to his request, Article 100 was inserted into the Constitution by Parliament for that purpose.|$|E

The paper describes why, {{during the course of the}} project, the architecture-driven approach sometimes proved to be unsuitable to tackle real-world constraints and requirements. Several reasons, e. g. frequently changing device road-maps, made architectural adaptations necessary. This resulted in a trade-off between desirable architectural design iterations and inevitable design <b>circumventions,</b> which finally led to an architecture and software components that proved to be flexible, robust and fit to meet the relevant real-world requirements. 1...|$|R

The migration milieu of Western capitalism actively requires and refutes the migrant, making a volatile life-world of migration in public discourse, policy and everyday life. Rather than focus on the current conceptual reach of super-diversity, my paper directly engages with whether super-diversity has explanatory cogency for this brutal migration milieu. Vertovec’s original outline of super-diversity points to accelerated migrations in which the elaboration of borders and <b>circumventions</b> have become ‘more multiple’, ‘more stratified’ (Vertovec 2007).

5000|$|The {{supreme court}} ruling of 1958 [...] ended a {{practice}} of tax benefits for plutocratic funding of parties by corporate donations. After a variety of <b>circumventions,</b> detours and legislative experiments, this principle was ultimately reinstated in 1992. In 1966 the supreme court (Bundesverfassungsgericht) attempted to {{limit the amount of}} public funding. However, the initial concept failed because tying subsidies to campaign spending turned out to be not working. A more recent ruling of 1992 allowed general subsidies but provided for two kinds of limitation: a matching provision and a maximum amount for direct state funding. The 1994 amendment to the Political Parties Act took care of all three provisions (relative maximum, absolute maximum for subsidies and no tax benefits for political contributions beyond €3,300 per individual and calendar year). Finally Sections 23b, 25 and 31d of the Political Parties Act 2002 tried to perfect the rules, especially by timely publication of large donations.|$|R

40|$|Rabbinic law is {{particularly}} {{well known for}} its use of legal dodges and technical <b>circumventions.</b> This dissertation focuses on three main questions about such loopholes: 1) Why is rabbinic law so replete with them? 2) Are they always permitted, and if not, what are the parameters of their use? 3) What does the use of legal loopholes reveal about rabbinic views {{of the relationship between}} intention and action? We attempt to answer these questions by analyzing a particular subset of rabbinic legal loopholes known as ha`arama (cunning). Tracing the history and use of ha`arama from tannaitic to amoraic sources, this work places rabbinic legal loopholes in context of Biblical and Ancient Near Eastern worldviews, Greco-Roman perspectives, and later contemporaneous Zoroastrian approaches. Working with both tannaitic and amoraic materials, with Palestinian and Babylonian sources, we observe a progression within rabbinic thinking on this front: from rigid legal formalism to a concern for the inner spirit of the law, and from emphasis on the inner spirit of the law to an interest in the inner spirit of the individual legal agent...|$|R
