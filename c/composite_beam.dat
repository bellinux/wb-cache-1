40|$|This paper {{presents}} a numerical {{investigation into the}} effect of construction methods to the structural behaviour of simply supported <b>composite</b> <b>beams.</b> Based on advanced three dimensional finite element models with material, geometrical and interfacial non-linearity, the structural behaviour of <b>composite</b> <b>beams</b> under experimental investigation has been obtained by the authors and other researchers {{with a high level}} of accuracy. By considering the construction method of <b>composite</b> <b>beams</b> in practice, it is important to realize that composite action is only required to be developed during the composite stage, and to resist primarily the imposed loads of the floors. Hence, the shear connectors are not required to resist the dead loads of the <b>composite</b> <b>beams,</b> and this represents typically a 30 % reduction on the forces acting onto the shear connectors. Thus, the structural demand on the shear connectors in <b>composite</b> <b>beams</b> in practice is considerably smaller than that in those <b>composite</b> <b>beams</b> which are fully supported during concrete casting. Through a numerical parametric study, the deformation characteristics of a total of 12 simply supported <b>composite</b> <b>beams</b> are presented, and the differences in the structural behaviour of <b>composite</b> <b>beams</b> due to the construction methods are discussed. It is found that the required slippage of the shear connectors in most simply supported <b>composite</b> <b>beams</b> built on sites are 4 to 5 mm smaller than that in those <b>composite</b> <b>beams</b> built in laboratory; this corresponds to a 30 to 50 % reduction. The findings are very important in quantifying the practical ranges of ductile slippage of shear studs in <b>composite</b> <b>beams,</b> and also in explaining the discrepancies between the slippage requirements of shear studs obtained from previous numerical investigations and the ductile slippages of shear studs measured from standard push-out tests...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a theoretical study on restricted distortional buckling of <b>composite</b> steel/concrete <b>composite</b> <b>beams</b> including {{the effects of}} partial shear interaction. In-plane and out-of-plane finite element formulations {{have been developed to}} investigate the buckling behaviour of steel joist of <b>composite</b> <b>beams</b> in negative or hogging regions. The variation of flexural rigidity along the length of <b>composite</b> <b>beams</b> is considered due to concrete cracking in tension. The results are important, as contemporary design techniques tend to be on the unconservative side neglecting partial shear interaction between the concrete slab and the steel joist. The theoretical investigation starts with developing a governing differential equation that governs the in-plane behaviour of <b>composite</b> <b>beams</b> with partial shear interaction. Its application is for simply-supported and fixed-ended <b>composite</b> <b>beams</b> with a uniform second moment of area along the length. A finite element formulation which accounts for the difference of beams flexural rigidities in hogging and sagging regions is then developed to analyze the <b>composite</b> <b>beams</b> subjected to general loading and end support conditions. The in-plane stress resultants of steel joist are then used as the input data for the out-of-plane finite element model to investigate the out-of-plane buckling behaviour of <b>composite</b> <b>beams.</b> These versatile finite element models are capable of accommodating different types of boundary and loading conditions such as fixed-ended and continuous <b>composite</b> <b>beams.</b> The findings conclude that the critical buckling load of <b>composite</b> <b>beams</b> is larger at the lower degrees of interaction. They can therefore be used to develop more economical and efficient designs...|$|R

50|$|The hybrid <b>composite</b> <b>beam</b> {{is single}} {{structural}} element, a beam. It is constructed as {{a composite of}} three materials steel strands, concrete, and fiber reinforced polymer. The materials are arranged {{in a manner that}} the materials act as what would traditionally be separate structural elements. The concrete is in the shape of an arch and carries compressive load internal to the beam. The steel strands act as a tie for the arch and carry the tensile load internal to the beam. The FRP shell carries the shear and bending moment internal to the beam. This means that the beam acts structurally in a hybrid nature, somewhere between a tied-arch and a beam.|$|E
5000|$|In {{structural}} engineering, {{composite construction}} exists when two different materials are bound together so strongly that they act {{together as a}} single unit from a structural point of view. When this occurs, it is called composite action. One common example involves steel beams supporting concrete floor slabs. [...] If the beam is not connected firmly to the slab, then the slab transfers all of its weight to the beam and the slab contributes nothing to the load carrying capability of the beam. However, if the slab is connected positively to the beam with studs, then {{a portion of the}} slab can be assumed to act compositely with the beam. In effect, this composite creates a larger and stronger beam than would be provided by the steel beam alone. The structural engineer may calculate a transformed section as one step in analyzing the load carry capability of the <b>composite</b> <b>beam.</b>|$|E

Out-of-plane torsional warping of the cross-section is found to be the key factor for an accurate modeling of the torsional behavior of such structures...|$|R
40|$|COMPOSITE BEAMS WITH WEB OPENINGS The {{purpose of}} this {{investigation}} was to study the behavior and develop an ultimate strength model for <b>composite</b> <b>beams</b> with rectangular web openings. Six <b>composite</b> <b>beams</b> with concentric rectangular web openings were tested to failure. Varying moment to shear ratios were used to help develop and verify the ultimate strength model. One steel beam was tested to demonstrate the contribution of the concrete to the capacity of <b>composite</b> <b>beams.</b> Two steel sections were used, while the concrete slab size was held constant for all beams. Three elastic tests were performed on each beam before it was tested to failure. An ultimate strength model was developed to predict the strength of <b>composite</b> <b>beams</b> at the web openings in the form of moment-shear inter-action diagrams. The steel is modeled as an elastic-perfectly plasti...|$|R
