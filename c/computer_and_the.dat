5|$|On 18 January, {{a problem}} with the {{computers}} aboard Mir developed shortly before fuelling of the Soyuz-U rocket was scheduled to commence, about five and a half hours before the launch was due to occur. The launch attempt was scrubbed, or cancelled, and the launch was expected to be delayed by four or five days. On 19 January, the launch was rescheduled for 24 January, giving controllers time to restart the <b>computer</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> station's gyroscopes, which had shut down when the computer failed.|$|E
5|$|Ongoing {{problems}} with avionics systems were {{addressed in the}} Jolly Well program, completed in 1964, which improved components of the AN/ASQ-38 bombing navigational <b>computer</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> terrain computer. The MADREC (Malfunction Detection and Recording) upgrade fitted to most aircraft by 1965 could detect failures in avionics and weapons computer systems, and was essential in monitoring the Hound Dog missiles. The electronic countermeasures capability of the B-52 was expanded with Rivet Rambler (1971) and Rivet Ace (1973).|$|E
5|$|The SG-1000, {{also known}} as the Sega Computer Videogame SG-1000, is a cartridge-based home video game console {{manufactured}} by Sega and released in Japan, Australia, and other countries. It was Sega's first entry into the home video game hardware business, and provided the basis for the more successful Master System. Introduced in 1983, the SG-1000 was released {{on the same day that}} Nintendo released the Family Computer (Famicom for short) in Japan. The SG-1000 was released in several forms, including the SC-3000 <b>computer</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> redesigned SG-1000 II, {{also known as}} the Mark II, released in 1984.|$|E

5|$|The ZX Spectrum {{enjoyed a}} very strong {{community}} early on. Several dedicated magazines were released including Sinclair User (1982), Your Spectrum (1983), rebranded as Your Sinclair in 1986, and CRASH (1984). Early on they were very technically oriented with type-in programs and machine code tutorials. Later on they became almost completely game-oriented. Several general contemporary computer magazines covered the ZX Spectrum in more or less detail. They included Computer Gamer, Computer and Video Games, Computing Today, Popular Computing Weekly, Your <b>Computer</b> <b>and</b> <b>The</b> Games Machine.|$|E
5|$|In December 1974 Bill Gates was {{a student}} at Harvard University and Paul Allen worked for Honeywell in Boston. They saw the Altair 8800 {{computer}} in the January 1975 issue of Popular Electronics and knew it was powerful enough to support a BASIC interpreter. They wanted {{to be the first to}} offer BASIC for the Altair <b>computer,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> software development tools they had previously created for their Intel 8008 microprocessor based Traf-O-Data computer would give them a head start. While their friend, Paul Gilbert, was building the computer, Allen wrote a program that ran on a DEC PDP-10 time-sharing computer that simulated the 8008 system. He also modified DEC's macro assembler to produce the machine code for the 8008 microprocessor. The Traf-O-Data software could be written and debugged before the computer hardware was complete.|$|E
5|$|Much {{research}} {{has been devoted to}} applications of photons in the field of quantum optics. Photons seem well-suited to be elements of an extremely fast quantum <b>computer,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> quantum entanglement of photons is a focus of research. Nonlinear optical processes are another active research area, with topics such as two-photon absorption, self-phase modulation, modulational instability and optical parametric oscillators. However, such processes generally do not require the assumption of photons per se; they may often be modeled by treating atoms as nonlinear oscillators. The nonlinear process of spontaneous parametric down conversion is often used to produce single-photon states. Finally, photons are essential in some aspects of optical communication, especially for quantum cryptography.|$|E

5|$|Steve Jobs is a 2015 American biographical drama film {{directed}} by Danny Boyle and written by Aaron Sorkin. Based on {{the biography of}} the same name by Walter Isaacson as well as interviews conducted by Sorkin, the film is structured into three acts which cover 14 years (1984–1998) in the life of personal computing innovator and Apple Inc. co-founder Steve Jobs, with each act taking place immediately prior to the launch of a key product – the Apple Macintosh, the NeXT <b>Computer</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> iMac. Jobs is portrayed by Michael Fassbender, with Kate Winslet, Seth Rogen, Katherine Waterston, Michael Stuhlbarg and Jeff Daniels in supporting roles.|$|E
5|$|The {{invention}} of electronic {{computers in the}} 1940s, along {{with the development of}} mathematical information theory, led to a realization that brains can potentially be understood as information processing systems. This concept formed the basis of the field of cybernetics, and eventually gave rise to the field now known as computational neuroscience. The earliest attempts at cybernetics were somewhat crude in that they treated the brain as essentially a digital computer in disguise, as for example in John von Neumann's 1958 book, The <b>Computer</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Brain. Over the years, though, accumulating information about the electrical responses of brain cells recorded from behaving animals has steadily moved theoretical concepts in the direction of increasing realism.|$|E
5|$|The {{high regard}} with which The Invincibles {{are held in}} the annals of Australian and world cricket is {{reflected}} in the various honours accorded to the players. Bradman, Lindwall and Miller were among the ten inaugural inductees into the Australian Cricket Hall of Fame in 1996. Hassett, Morris and Harvey were later inducted, so that 20% of the inductees are from the 1948 team. Of these six, all except Hassett were selected in Australia's Team of the Century, with Bradman as captain and Miller his deputy. Bradman, Lindwall, Miller and Harvey are among a group of only 14 Australians in a total of 60 players who have been inducted into the International Cricket Council's Hall of Fame. In The Ten Greatest Test Teams by Tom Graveney with Norman Miller ten teams were compared by a <b>computer</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> 1948 Australians emerged second behind the 1984 West Indians. Graveney strongly disagreed with the result, writing 'there has not been a better team in my lifetime than Don Bradman's Australian tourists of 1948'. The computer regarded Sam Loxton {{as a member of the}} team as he played more Tests in the series than Neil Harvey, if Harvey had been picked the Australians would have been the superior team.|$|E

40|$|This is Closed Access. The {{article was}} {{published}} in the journal, Universal Access in the Information Society [© Springer-Verlag] and is available at: [URL] paper reports the findings from a two-year pilot project called Care OnLine (COL). The COL project has introduced <b>computers</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Internet into the homes of 50 elderly and vulnerable volunteers and provided shared Internet access at five shared schemes housing older people across the Market Harbrorough district of Leicestershire. A specific web portal was designed that was geared towards older and vulnerable people and provided information about the different services available to them, as well as links to a variety of websites. All the volunteers were provided with training in using <b>computers</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Internet, <b>and</b> were interviewed regarding their experiences. Findings related to their attitudes towards, <b>and</b> experiences of, <b>computers</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Internet are reported.

5|$|To {{create the}} {{character}} animations for the game, actors {{were placed in}} front of a gray background and performed the motions, which were recorded on videotape (using a broadcast-quality, $20,000 Sony camera instead of the standard Hi8 camera used for the original Mortal Kombat). The video capture footage was then processed into a <b>computer,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> background was removed from selected frames to create sprites. Towards the end of the game's development, they opted to instead use a blue screen technique and processed the footage directly into the computer for a similar, simpler process. The actors were lightly sprayed with water to give them a sweaty, glistening appearance, while post-editing was done on the sprites afterward to highlight flesh tones and improve the visibility of muscles, which Tobias felt set the series apart from similar games using digitized graphics. Animations of Shang Tsung morphing into other characters were created by Midway's John Vogel using a computer, while hand-drawn animations were used for other parts of the game, such as the Fatalities. For animating Goro and Kintaro, clay sculptures were created by Tobias' friend Curt Chiarelli and then turned into 12-inch latex miniatures that were used for stop motion filming. Because of technical restrictions, the actors' costumes had to be simple and no acrobatic moves such as backflips could have been recorded; the hardest moves to perform were some of the jumping kicks.|$|E
