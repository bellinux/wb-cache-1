5|$|Having {{seen the}} court through the Old Court-New Court controversy, Chief Justice Boyle {{resigned}} in 1826. In December 1828, Mills and Owsley also resigned. Their resignations were {{an attempt to}} silence criticism from the defeated New Court faction that they held their seats {{in defiance of the}} will of the people. Old Court supporters hoped both men would be re-nominated and re-confirmed by the legislature, making the New Court's charge less credible. Accordingly, newly elected governor Thomas Metcalfe submitted both men to the legislature for confirmation, but the nominations were defeated in the state senate. Thus ended Owsley's tenure on the court. It was, at the time, the longest tenure of any Court of Appeals justice except John Boyle. Owsley returned to his legal practice, and his <b>case</b> <b>load</b> soon compelled him to move to Frankfort.|$|E

40|$|We {{investigated}} whether {{installation of}} robot-assisted surgical equipment in hospitals resulted in {{concentration of the}} <b>case</b> <b>loads</b> of radical prostatectomy. We selected 11 areas with populations of around 1 million or more where there were one or more hospitals with robotic equipment and 4 or more without it. In addition, annual changes of <b>case</b> <b>loads</b> for prostatectomy over 4 years from 2010 to 2013 were clearly determined in these areas. The <b>case</b> <b>loads</b> were determined {{based on the results}} of a questionnaire survey for the hospitals with robots and on the Diagnostic Procedures Combination data provided by the Ministry of Health, Labor and Wealth for those without such equipment. The concentration of the <b>case</b> <b>loads</b> was principally defined as when hospitals with robots had more predominant proportion of cases than those without them inthe comparisonbetweencase loads prior to instillationof robots (or inthe initial year of the study) and those in the final years. The 11 selected areas included 44 hospitals with robots and 156 without them. Concentration of <b>case</b> <b>loads</b> was found in 5 areas. In 4 areas, installation of robots did not have a specific relationto the distributionpattern s of <b>case</b> <b>loads</b> inhospitals with or without the equipment. The remaining 2 areas tended to have a weak but not definite concentration of <b>case</b> <b>loads.</b> In the areas in which installation did not influence <b>case</b> <b>loads</b> the further analysis revealed that their <b>case</b> <b>loads</b> had already been concentrated in the initial year (2010) of the study. Although the current results were found in a single department of the hospital, robotic installation may result in concentration of prostatectomy <b>case</b> <b>loads</b> for such hospitals in some areas. The current results are intriguing when we consider the future roles of acutecare hospitals and beds in our country where the number of aged patients having chronic diseases will increase. In conclusion, installation of robotic equipment may result in concentration of prostatectomy <b>case</b> <b>loads</b> insome areas...|$|R
40|$|Structural {{static test}} was {{conducted}} on the CFRP composite co cured MLG(Aft) door to demonstrate the structural integrity of the door and to experimentally determine the deflections and strains at selected locations and to correlate the test values with those obtained by theoretical values. The door was loaded for two pressure <b>load</b> <b>cases</b> and two suction <b>load</b> <b>cases.</b> Pressure <b>load</b> <b>cases</b> are limit <b>load</b> <b>cases.</b> One suction <b>load</b> <b>case</b> corresponds to Design ultimate <b>load</b> <b>case</b> and the other suction <b>load</b> <b>case</b> corresponds to jamming <b>load</b> <b>case.</b> The <b>load</b> v/s deflection/strain behavior was obtained for all <b>load</b> <b>cases.</b> The door successfully withstood the ultimate load without any failure and the maximum deflection was 11. 26 mm and the maximum strain was 1681 micro strains. Both deflections and strains were well within the design requirements. It was therefore concluded that the structural behavior of the door is satisfactory and it was cleared for flight trials. This report deals with the results of the static testing of the door. ...|$|R

25|$|Bites {{can occur}} {{on both the}} victim and the suspect; teeth are used as weapon by the aggressor and in self-defense by the victim. Although they are {{only a small portion}} of most {{forensic}} dentist’s <b>case</b> <b>load,</b> bite marks represent the most challenging aspect of the discipline. In addition to the location of the bite mark the type of severity of the injury may give investigators clues as to the mental state of the offender. Bite marks may be found on the flesh of victims of a violent attack, particularly on the stomach or buttocks. Alternatively they may be found on the suspect, left by the victim during self-defense. Bite marks can be altered through stretching, movement, or change in environment after the bite. There is also no set standard by which to analyse and compare bite marks.|$|E

The following are the results. 1) In the <b>case</b> <b>loaded</b> with colcemide a marked degeneration of cytoplasma and the abnormality in cell division can be recognized. 2) In the <b>case</b> <b>loaded</b> with carzinophilin the pyknosis and disintegration of the nucleus and cytoplasma can be observed. 3) In the <b>case</b> <b>loaded</b> with glucosamine the same as in (2), the pyknosis and disintegration of the nucleus and cytoplasma can be seen. 4) In the case of nitromine, the swelling and destruction of the nucleus and cytoplasma as well as the formation of bubbles can be recognized. 5) In the <b>case</b> <b>loaded</b> with unsaturated fatty acid extract of the roentgenized liver, the pyknosis and disintegration of the nucleus and the disintegration and swelling of cytoplasma, namely, the mechanism acting in two ways as carzinophilin and nitromine combined, can be recognized.

40|$|AbstractAt present, for topological {{optimization}} {{in multiple}} <b>load</b> <b>cases,</b> many researchers use directly traditional Evolutionary Structural Optimization (ESO) method to get respectively the inefficient material set {{that should be}} removed in each <b>load</b> <b>case,</b> then the intersection of all the sets is just the material that should be removed.
