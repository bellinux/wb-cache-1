5|$|In 17th-century Germany, the {{physician}} Eberhard Gockel discovered lead-contaminated wine {{to be the}} cause of an epidemic of <b>colic.</b> He had noticed that monks who did not drink wine were healthy, while wine drinkers developed <b>colic,</b> and traced the cause to sugar of lead, made by simmering litharge with vinegar. As a result, Eberhard Ludwig, Duke of Württemberg issued an edict in 1696 banning the adulteration of wines with litharge.|$|E

Conditions that present similarly and must be ruled out in diagnosing lead poisoning include carpal tunnel syndrome, Guillain–Barré syndrome, renal <b>colic,</b> appendicitis, encephalitis in adults, and viral gastroenteritis in children. Other differential diagnoses in children include constipation, abdominal <b>colic,</b> iron deficiency, subdural hematoma, neoplasms of the central nervous system, emotional and behavior disorders, and intellectual disability.|$|E
5|$|Systemic {{symptoms}} {{resulting from}} anaphylaxis can be dramatic. These may appear within 5 minutes post bite, {{or can be}} delayed for many hours. Such symptoms include nausea, retching and vomiting, abdominal <b>colic</b> and diarrhoea, incontinence of urine and faeces, sweating, fever, vasoconstriction, tachycardia, lightheadedness, loss of consciousness, blindness, shock, angioedema of the face, lips, gums, tongue, throat and epiglottis, urticaria and bronchospasm. If left untreated, these symptoms may persist or fluctuate for up to 48 hours. In severe cases, cardiovascular failure may occur.|$|E

5|$|The open {{nature of}} the New Forest means that ponies are able to wander onto roads. The ponies {{actually}} have right of way over vehicles and many wear reflective collars {{in an effort to}} reduce traffic fatalities, but despite this, many ponies, along with commoners' cattle, pigs, and donkeys are killed or injured in road traffic accidents every year. Human interaction with ponies is also a problem; well meaning but misguided visitors to the forest frequently feed them, which can create dietary problems and sickness (eg <b>colic)</b> and cause the ponies to adopt an aggressive attitude in order to obtain human food.|$|E
5|$|Even a {{slightly}} dehydrated horse is {{at higher risk}} of developing impaction <b>colic.</b> Additionally, dehydration can lead to weight loss because the horse cannot produce adequate amounts of saliva, thus decreasing the amount of feed and dry forage consumed. Thus, {{it is especially important}} for horse owners to encourage their horses to drink when there is a risk of dehydration; when horses are losing a great deal of water in hot weather due to strenuous work, or in cold weather due to horses' natural tendency to drink less when in a cold environment. To encourage drinking, owners may add electrolytes to the feed, additives to make the water especially palatable (such as apple juice), or, when it is cold, to warm the water so that it is not at a near-freezing temperature.|$|E
5|$|In the Western world, about 15% of {{all people}} have gallstones in their {{gallbladder}} but the majority are unaware of this and have no symptoms. Over tenyears, 15–26% will suffer one or more episodes of biliary <b>colic</b> (abdominal pain due {{to the passage of}} gallstones through the bile duct into the digestive tract), and 2–3% will develop complications of obstruction: acute pancreatitis, cholecystitis or acute cholangitis. Prevalence of gallstone disease increases with age and body mass index (a marker of obesity). However, the risk is also increased in those who lose weight rapidly (e.g. after weight loss surgery) due to alterations in the composition of the bile that makes it prone to form stones. Gallstones are slightly more common in women than in men, and pregnancy increases the risk further.|$|E

5|$|The Māori used {{various parts}} of Cordyline australis to treat {{injuries}} and illnesses, either boiled up into a drink or pounded into a paste. The kōata, the growing tip of the plant, was eaten raw as a blood tonic or cleanser. Juice from the leaves was used for cuts, cracks and sores. An infusion of the leaves was taken internally for diarrhoea and used externally for bathing cuts. The leaves were rubbed until soft and applied either directly or as an ointment to cuts, skin cracks and cracked or sore hands. The young shoot was eaten by nursing mothers and given to children for <b>colic.</b> The liquid from boiled shoots was taken for other stomach pains. The seeds of Cordyline australis are high in linoleic acid, one of the essential fatty acids.|$|E
5|$|The cooling {{properties}} of the leaves were used in Britain {{as a treatment for}} trench foot in World War I, and as compresses for ulcers and breast abscesses. Accumulated scientific evidence corroborates that cabbage leaf treatment can reduce the pain and hardness of engorged breasts, and increase the duration of breast feeding. Other medicinal uses recorded in European folk medicine include treatments for rheumatism, sore throat, hoarseness, <b>colic,</b> and melancholy. In the United States, cabbage {{has been used as a}} hangover cure, to treat abscesses, to prevent sunstroke, or to cool body parts affected by fevers. The leaves have also been used to soothe sore feet and, when tied around a child's neck, to relieve croup. Both mashed cabbage and cabbage juice have been used in poultices to remove boils and treat warts, pneumonia, appendicitis, and ulcers.|$|E
5|$|In mid-2005, Salzgeber's then-current Grand Prix mount, Wall Street, was euthanized {{following}} {{an episode of}} <b>colic.</b> This, combined with the recent retirement of Rusty, left her with no Grand Prix-level horses. Wall Street, while a relatively successful dressage horse, had suffered health problems and {{had never been able}} to compete with Rusty as Salzgeber's top horse. In 2008, Salzgeber again began competing at the Grand Prix level on Herzruf's Erbe, who would develop into one of her top international horses. In that year, the pair won the Otto Lorke Prize, given each year to the best German Grand Prix horse under 10 years old. During 2008, Salzgeber and Herzruf's Erbe had won 10 Grand Prix competitions. In 2009, the pair were expected to compete at the European Dressage Championships, but were not chosen for the German team after Herzruf's Erbe sustained an injury at a competition in July. The immediate diagnosis was a severely pulled tendon, although a later diagnosis was that the horse had strained a suspensory muscle, expected to heal in about three months. By early 2010, the horse was again able to be ridden, but was still not in top condition.|$|E
40|$|The article {{provides}} results of studying {{the frequency of}} occurrence of symptoms for functional disorders of the digestive tract in children in their first half a year who are under different types of infant feeding strategies. It was found that 79. 6 % of children in their first half a year {{had been diagnosed with}} the symptoms for disorders of gastrointestinal tract (GIT) function. The most frequent were intestinal <b>colics</b> (56. 1 %), posseting (53. 1 %) and delayed defecation (29. 6 % of cases). A correlation between the intestinal <b>colics,</b> flatulence and posseting was established. It was found that various functional disorders of the digestive tract in infants have common links of pathogenesis.

40|$|International audienceBACKGROUND: Infantile <b>colics</b> or {{excessive}} crying {{represent a}} source of stress for parents and a frequent reason for encounter in primary care. OBJECTIVE: To assess the effectiveness of treatments of this syndrome from a systematic review. INFORMATION SOURCES: Medline, Cochrane and Embase databases. SELECTION OF STUDIES: We used the following inclusion criteria: therapeutic assessment of infant <b>colics</b> or excessive crying, randomized controlled trials or meta-analyses, published in English or French language. Thirty-one randomized controlled trials and one meta-analysis have been included. RESULTS: Allopathic drugs have not proved effectiveness (simethicone, lactase) {{and some of them}} can cause potentially serious adverse reactions (dicyclomine). Protein hydrolysate or soy formulas seem to be effective, but soy milk can induce allergies. Sucrose solutions provide some benefit in studies with low level of evidence. Effectiveness is likely for a probiotics (Lactobacillus reuteri) and for herbal mixtures containing fennel extracts. Evidence is lacking for manual (osteopathy, acupuncture) and behavioural therapies (decreased stimulations, reassurance of parents). LIMITATIONS: The definition of infantile <b>colics</b> and the methods used for crying measurement changed across trials. The included trials were of variable quality, especially with no double-blind procedure in 17 trials. CONCLUSION: The most validated treatments for infantile <b>colics</b> are the substitution of cows' milk by a hydrolysed formula, the use of L.  reuteri and of fennel extracts...|$|R

5|$|The {{leaves of}} red maple, {{especially}} when dead or wilted, are extremely toxic to horses. The toxin is unknown, but {{believed to be}} an oxidant because it damages red blood cells, causing acute oxidative hemolysis that inhibits the transport of oxygen. This not only decreases oxygen delivery to all tissues, but also leads {{to the production of}} methemoglobin, which can further damage the kidneys. The ingestion of 700grams (1.5 pounds) of leaves is considered toxic and 1.4 kilograms (3 pounds) is lethal. Symptoms occur within one or two days after ingestion and can include depression, lethargy, increased rate and depth of breathing, increased heart rate, jaundice, dark brown urine, <b>colic,</b> laminitis, coma, and death. Treatment is limited and can include the use of methylene blue or mineral oil and activated carbon in order to stop further absorption of the toxin into the stomach, as well as blood transfusions, fluid support, diuretics, and anti-oxidants such as Vitamin C. About 50% to 75% of affected horses die or are euthanized as a result.|$|E
5|$|Many horses died as {{a result}} of the {{conditions}} at the front—of exhaustion, drowning, becoming mired in mud and falling in shell holes. Other horses were captured after their riders were killed. Horses also endured poor feeding and care, poison gas attacks that injured their respiratory systems and skin, and skin conditions such as mange. When gas warfare began in 1915, nose plugs were improvised for the horses to allow them to breathe during attacks. Later, several types of gas masks were developed by both the Central and Allied nations, although horses often confused them with feedbags and destroyed them. Soldiers found that better-bred horses were more likely to suffer from shell shock and act up when exposed to the sights and sounds of war than less-well-bred animals, who often learned to lie down and take cover at the sound of artillery fire. Veterinary hospitals were established to assist horses in recovering from shell shock and battle wounds, but thousands of equine corpses still lined the roads of the Western Front. In one year, 120,000horses were treated for wounds or disease by British veterinary hospitals alone. Ambulances and field veterinary hospitals were required to care for the horses, and horse trailers were first developed for use on the Western Front as equine ambulances. Disease was also a major issue for horses at the front, with equine influenza, ringworm, sand <b>colic,</b> sores from fly bites, and anthrax among the illnesses that affected them. British Army Army Veterinary Corps hospitals treated 725,216 horses over the course of the war, successfully healing 529,064. Horses were moved from the front to veterinary hospitals by several methods of transportation, including on foot, by rail and by barge. During the last months of the war, barges were considered ideal transportation for horses suffering wounds from shells and bombs.|$|E
25|$|<b>Colic</b> in horses {{is defined}} as {{abdominal}} pain, {{but it is a}} clinical sign rather than a diagnosis. The term <b>colic</b> can encompass all forms of gastrointestinal conditions which cause pain as well as other causes of abdominal pain not involving the gastrointestinal tract. The most common forms of <b>colic</b> are gastrointestinal in nature and are most often related to colonic disturbance. There are a variety of different causes of <b>colic,</b> some of which can prove fatal without surgical intervention. <b>Colic</b> surgery is usually an expensive procedure as it is major abdominal surgery, often with intensive aftercare. Among domesticated horses, <b>colic</b> {{is the leading cause of}} premature death. The incidence of <b>colic</b> in the general horse population has been estimated between 4 and 10 percent over the course of their lifetime. Clinical signs of <b>colic</b> generally require treatment by a veterinarian.|$|E
40|$|Biliary {{parasitosis}} {{is one of}} {{the important}} causes of biliary obstruction in endemic areas, however due to migration and travel the disease is known to occur in non endemic zones as well.
