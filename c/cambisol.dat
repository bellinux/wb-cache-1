40|$|In {{the period}} when the {{non-ferrous}} metallurgical plant of Zlatna was functioning, both sulfur dioxide and powder of metal sulphides and metal oxides were emitted in the air. Dioxide and trioxide sulfur in contact with rain water convert to sulfuric acid {{that leads to the}} formation of acid precipitation, which in contact with soils leads to its acidification. Soil cover in the Zlatna area is mainly represented by Eutric <b>Cambisols</b> (47. 3 %) Dystric <b>Cambisols</b> (29. 5 %) Luvisols (4. 2 %), regosols (1. 7 %), strongly eroded soils (3. 3 %). Soil resistance to acidification depends on the soil fundamental characteristics such as reaction, texture, content and nature of humus, cation exchange capacity, etc. Based on the calculation of soil buffering capacity indicator for reaction, the vulnerability map to soil acidification in the Zlatna area, Budeni-Izvorul Ampoiului-Mets-Sard-Alba Iulia sector was drawn. Within this area, four classes of soil vulnerability to acidification were designated. Soils with high vulnerability are extended on a small area (2320 ha - 4, 8 %) and are represented by the following soils: Rhodic-dystric <b>Cambisols,</b> Leptirodic-dystric <b>cambisols,</b> Rhodic <b>Cambisols,</b> Rhodic-leptic Regosols, Albic-stagnic Luvisols, Stagnic Luvisols. The soils with high vulnerability are spread over large areas occupying 22 000 ha (45. 5 %).

40|$|Aim of {{this work}} was to test the 2010 version of the WRB soil {{classification}} for compilating {{a map of the}} soil systems of Italy at 1 : 500, 000 scale. The source of data was the national geodatabase storing information on 1, 414 Soil Typological Units (STUs). Though, basically, we followed WRB criteria to prioritize soil qualifiers, however, it was necessary to work out an original methodology in the map legend representation to reproduce the high variability inside each delineation meanwhile avoiding any loss of information. Each map unit may represent a combination of three codominant STUs at the most. Dominant STUs were assessed summing up the occurrence of STUs in the Land Components (LCs) of every soil system, where each LC is a specific combination of morphology, lithology and land cover. STUs were classified according to the WRB soil classification system, at the third level, that is, reference soil group and first two qualifiers, when possible. Since the large number of delineations, map units grouping was needed to make the map more legible. Legend colours were organized according to soil regions groups firstly, then by considering the highest level of soil classification, so resulting a nidificated legend.

Hypereutric <b>Cambisols</b> dominate upslope; Cambic Vertisols and Fluvic <b>Cambisols</b> occur downslope. The soil mineralogy showed abundance of primary serpentine all over the sequence. It is predominant upslope but secondary smectites dominate in the Vertisols. Free Fe-oxides are abundant in all soils but slightly more abundant in the upslope soils. Whereas serpentines hold Ni in a similar and restricted range in every soil (approx. 0. 3 %), Ni contents in smectites may vary a lot and Mg-rich and Al-poor smectites in the Vertisol could hold up to 4. 9 % Ni. Ni was probably adsorbed onto amorphous Fe-oxides and was also exchangeable in secondary smectites. High availability of Ni in soils was confirmed by DTPA extractions. However, it varied significantly along the toposequence, being higher in upslope soils, where Ni-bearing amorphous Fe-oxides were abundant and total organic carbon higher and sensibly lower downslope on the Vertisols: Ni-DTPA varied from 285 mg kg(- 1) in the surface of soil I (upslope) to 95. 9 mg kg(- 1) in the surface of Fluvic <b>Cambisols.</b> Concentration of Ni in Alyssum murale shoots varied from 0. 7 % (Hypereutric <b>Cambisols)</b> to 1. 4 % (Hypereutric Vertisol).

40|$|Background and Purpose: <b>Cambisol</b> is {{the best}} {{represented}} soil in Dinaric beech-fir forests. The paper presents and compares properties of <b>cambisol</b> {{in the areas of}} northern Velebit and Gorski Kotar. Materials and Methods: Localities with cambisols over limestone were selected on Velebit and Gorski Kotar. All the localities were reconnoitred and their affiliation to the association Omphalodo-Fagetum was established. Soil samples were taken in 47 pedological profiles. The following were analyzed: pH values, organic carbon and total nitrogen content, nitrate and ammonia nitrogen content, physiologically active phosphorus and potassium content, and soil texture. The data were statistically processed by Statistica 7. 1. Results: <b>Cambisol</b> on Velebit is deeper than <b>cambisol</b> in Gorski Kotar. A lower pH value was recorded in <b>cambisol</b> on Velebit. Cambisols of Velebit and Gorski Kotar belong to humus-rich soils and soils that are very rich in total nitrogen content. A statistically significantly higher NH 4 + content was recorded within the entire <b>cambisol</b> profiles in Gorski Kotar. The A horizon of <b>cambisol</b> profiles opened on Velebit is poorly supplied with physiologically active phosphorus, whereas in GorskiKotar the supply ranges from poor to good. With regard to texture, <b>cambisol</b> in the A horizon on Velebit and in GorskiKotar is predominantly silty clay loam and in the B horizon it is light clay. Conclusion: Based on the obtained results, the pH value of <b>cambisol</b> on Velebit is lower (more acid) than in all the other localities in GorskiKotar.

40|$|Agricultural {{production}} in the Northern Highlands of Ethiopia is low, stagnant or unsustainable. The objectives {{of this study were}} to explore long-term dynamics of soil organic carbon (C), nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) and the consequences for crop-available N and P to support the design of sustainable farm management practices for higher yields and improved livelihoods in the Northern Highlands of Ethiopia. Simplified soil N and P dynamics modules are described. C dynamics have been linked to the dynamics of organic N via the C:N ratio. The model has been calibrated on the basis of empirical data from the study area. The N and OC modules have been validated on the basis of an empirical data set for fields continuously cultivated for 7 - 53 years in smallholder farms in the Highlands of Ethiopia. The model has been applied for exploration of long-term dynamics of soil N, OC and P and crop available N and P under alternative farm management regimes. The simulation results indicate that, in terms of soil OC, the control management results in 44, 42 and 38 % depletion, respectively, in <b>Cambisols,</b> Luvisols and Leptosols; current management practice (Alt 1) results in 16 % reduction in <b>Cambisols,</b> 32 % in Luvisols, but a 22 % increase in Leptosols; Alt 2 (returning all non-economic organic material to the soil) results in 27 % reduction in Luvisols, whereas in <b>Cambisols</b> and Leptosols it increases by 1 and 57 %, respectively, after 50 years of cultivation. The rates of changes in soil N are similar to those in OC under current management, Alt 1 and Alt 2. In terms of total soil P, the control management and Alt 2 result in 46 and 43 % depletion in <b>Cambisols</b> and 53 and 52 % in Luvisols over the 50 years. On the other hand, Alt 1 results in build-up of total soil P in <b>Cambisols</b> (69 % higher after 50 years), but still to depletion (8 %) in Luvisols. All other management regimes are not 'sustainable' in terms of soil N, OC and P, and lead to 'soil mining'. Finally, the model has been used to estimate the required organic amendments and inorganic P inputs to maintain the current status of soil OC and P, as a benchmark of management practices. To maintain the current status of soil OC, the required composted organic amendments were 5. 3, 15. 0 and 2. 1 Mg ha- 1 annually for <b>Cambisols,</b> Luvisols and Leptosols, respectively. To maintain the current soil P-levels, required inorganic P-doses (in addition to organic P contributions from composted organic fertilizer from 5. 3 (in <b>Cambisols)</b> and 15. 0 (in Luvisols) Mg ha- 1 year- 1) were 8 kg ha- 1 year- 1 in <b>Cambisols</b> and 23 kg in Luvisols. The model is relatively easy to parameterize for specific situations and reproduces the most important aspects of soil nutrient dynamics. The modelling approach developed in this study can support the design of appropriate soil N, OC and P management practices that eventually should lead to higher yields and improved livelihood...|$|R
