For this reason <b>cornelian</b> <b>cherry</b> has been targeted in the EU program BaSeFood (Sustainable exploitation of bioactive components from the Black Sea Area traditional foods) in which uses, composition and traditional foods of local crops are being investigated and compared, in a cross-country perspective. Documentation is being carried on local populations, growing systems, exploitation and commercialisation, local knowledge about uses and perception of health promoting properties, and recipes.

Old plantations and wild stands represent important resources for local communities, that generally do not have the financial or technical resources to transfer their traditional knowledge into products acceptable according to standards of marketing and safety. The fruits are sold on local markets and roadsides, fresh, dried, or processed. Firms use the dried fruits for producing herbal remedies or extracts. A wide range of traditional products are manufactured at home level: compotes, preserves with sugar, without cooking, concentrated preserves without sugar (lekvar), juice and mashed pulp thickenings (the Caucasian fruit leather, Georgian thklapi, with equivalent in southern Russia), pickles in vinegar, sauces and other. The use of <b>cornelian</b> <b>cherry</b> is associated with the popular perception of health promoting properties: disinfectant, anti-diarrhoea, anti-inflammatory, vessel-protectant, especially against haemorrhoids.

40|$|Background and Objectives: Red colored fruits such as <b>cornelian</b> <b>cherry</b> (Cornus mas L) are {{recognized}} as being healthy. The color of these fruits is an important sensory property in assessment of product quality therefore, minimizing the loss {{of color in the}} process is very important. Materials and Methods: In this study, comparison of the color, turbidity, degradation rate of anthocyanin, and rate of evaporation in <b>cornelian</b> <b>cherry</b> (cornus mass L) juice produced from microwave and conventional heating at different operational pressures (12, 38. 5 and 100 K Pa) was investigated. Results: The final brix juice 42  was obtained in 137, 125, and 93 min by conventional heating at 100, 38. 5 and 12 K Pa, respectively. Applying microwave energy decreased the required times to 115, 90 and 75 min at 100, 38. 5 and 12 K Pa, respectively. In both methods, the heating temperature at pressures of 12, 38 and 100 K Pa was 50, 75 and 100 ° C, respectively. The results also showed that hunter lab values (L, a, and b) were decreased with increasing the time of process, turbidity, and degradation rate of anthocyanin. Conclusions: The heating method affects the color, degradation rate of anthocyanins and evaporation rate of <b>cornelian</b> <b>cherry</b> concentrate. Also the results indicated that temperature and time of process are higher in conventional heating than in microwave.

40|$|<b>Cornelian</b> <b>cherry</b> has a {{profound}} cultural and traditional {{meaning to the}} people of the Drvar Valley.

The antioxidant profiles were determined by total antioxidant capacity (2, 2 -diphenyl- 1 -picrylhydrazyl, DPPH), and ferric-reducing antioxidant power (FRAP). Additionally, total polyphenol content (TPC) was investigated. Chemical compositions of juices were tested using the chromatographic techniques: high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC-MS). Adhesion properties of Asaia spp. cells to various abiotic materials were evaluated by luminometry, plate count and fluorescence microscopy. Antioxidant activity of fruit juices expressed as inhibitory concentration (IC 50) ranged from 0. 042 ± 0. 001 (<b>cornelian</b> <b>cherry)</b> to 0. 021 ± 0. 001 g/mL (elderberry).

A significant linear correlation was noted between TPC and antioxidant capacity.
