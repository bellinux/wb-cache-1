[...] "Buddy" [...] Parnell formed the group with friends and fellow {{employees}} of Courtaulds Fibers, a company which owned a portion of the suspected Old Mobile site. Members of the team determined that Donald Harris had been exploring the incorrect location. Based on clues from aerial photographs and French maps, the team located a house of the former settlement in February 1989.

50|$|The raw {{material}} of the brickyard was <b>clay</b> which <b>stemmed</b> {{from a nearby}} Open-pit mining site. By about 1920, fossils were discovered there. Research was conducted by geologists and paleontologists of the University of Göttingen. The clay site was geologically formed in the pliocene epoch. Mining was stopped when the brickyard shut down. Among the fossils that were found are parts of Mammutidae, Giant salamander, fishes and ostracods, too. Calosoma sycophanta was among the insect fossils of the site. A single Comptonia fossil was found, too, which was unique in Europe. A Comptonia leaf was thus integrated in the coat of arms of Willershausen village.|$|R

2500|$|By late 1963, Clay {{had become}} the top {{contender}} for Sonny Liston's title. The fight was set for February 25, 1964, in Miami Beach. Liston was an intimidating personality, a dominating fighter with a criminal past and ties to the mob. Based on Clay's uninspired performance against Jones and Cooper in his previous two fights, and Liston's destruction of former heavyweight champion Floyd Patterson in two first-round knock outs, Clay was a 7–1 underdog. Despite this, Clay taunted Liston during the pre-fight buildup, dubbing him [...] "the big ugly bear". [...] "Liston even smells like a bear", Clay said. [...] "After I beat him I'm going to donate him to the zoo." [...] Clay turned the pre-fight weigh-in into a circus, shouting at Liston that [...] "someone {{is going to die}} at ringside tonight". Clay's pulse rate was measured at 120, more than double his normal 54. Many of those in attendance thought <b>Clay's</b> behavior <b>stemmed</b> from fear, and some commentators wondered if he would show up for the bout.|$|R

60|$|Accordingly, he soon {{reached an}} open plat of turf, on the {{opposite}} side of which, a rock, rising abruptly from a gently sloping plain, offered its grey and weatherbeaten front to the traveller. Ivy mantled its sides in some places, and in others oaks and holly bushes, whose roots found nourishment in the cliffs of the crag, waved over the precipices below, like the plumage of the warrior over his steel helmet, giving grace to that whose chief expression was terror. At the bottom of the rock, and leaning, as it were, against it, was constructed a rude hut, built chiefly of the trunks of trees felled in the neighbouring forest, and secured against the weather by having its crevices stuffed with moss mingled with <b>clay.</b> The <b>stem</b> of a young fir-tree lopped of its branches, with a piece of wood tied across near the top, was planted upright by the door, as a rude emblem of the holy cross. At a little distance on the right hand, a fountain of the purest water trickled out of the rock, and was received in a hollow stone, which labour had formed into a rustic basin. Escaping from thence, the stream murmured down the descent by a channel which its course had long worn, and so wandered through the little plain to lose itself in the neighbouring wood.|$|R
40|$|An {{outbreak}} of bilharzia (Schistosoma mattheei) infestation involving about 100 oxen {{on the farm}} Otthilie near Tolwe in northern Transvaal is described. Infestation of the cattle appears to have occurred per os from a single drinking trough. The cattle showed clinical signs and pathological lesions of both the reinfestation and the acute syndromes. The worm burdens were the highest recorded hitherto in naturally infested cattle. Severe macroscopic <b>clay</b> pipe <b>stem</b> periportal fibrosis, granulomata of the ureters and severe grey pigmentation of the lungs, are described {{for the first time}} in naturally infested cattle. There was more marked liver pigmentation than had been encountered previously in this host. A striking feature in every case was conspicuous congestion and enlargement of the ileo-cecal valve, which was dark red in colour. Treatment of affected animals with injectable trichlorphon controlled the outbreak without causing mass embolism and liver infarcts. At least 11 treatments at a dosage level of 10 - 12 mg/kg per treatment at 3 - 5 day intervals are necessary. Faecal examinations for eggs or miracidia cannot be used to assess the worm burden or the clinical state of the animal. Moreover, it is suggested that this disease may be confused with other conditions and this probably accounts for the rarity of reports of outbreaks in ruminants.

40|$|There are {{currently}} three formula dating techniques available to archaeologists studying 17 th and 18 th century sites using imported English <b>clay</b> tobacco pipe <b>stems</b> based on Harrington's histogram of time periods; Binford's linear formula, Hanson's formulas and the Heighton and Deagan formula. Pipe stem bore diameter {{data were collected}} from 26 sites in Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina and South Carolina in order to test the accuracy and utility of the three formula dating methods. Of the formulas, the Heighton and Deagan proved to be the most accurate, producing formula mean dates closest to the dates assigned to the sites using other dating techniques. It was also determined that all three formula dating methods work better in Maryland and Virginia than in North and South Carolina. Other aspects of pipe stem dating were explored in this paper including regional consumption patterns and the influences Dutch pipes have on formula dating. These questions were addressed specifically on sites from the Chesapeake. This analysis supports recent assertions that the Chesapeake should be split into two sub-regions, the Upper and Lower Chesapeake.   M. A...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{different}} water regimes on the pathogenicity of Meloidogyne graminicola on six rice cultivars were determined in two soil types in three greenhouse experiments. Two water regimes, simulating continuous flooding and intermittent flooding, were used with {{five of the}} cultivars. All cultivars were susceptible to the nematode, but IR 72 and IR 74 were more tolerant than IR 20 and IR 29 under intermittent flooding. All were tolerant under continuous flooding. UPLRi- 5 was grown under multiple water regimes: no flooding; continuous flooding; flooding starting at maximum tillering, panicle initiation, or booting stage; and flooding from sowing until maximum tillering or booting. In sandy loam soil, M. graminicola reduced stem and leaf dry weight, root dry weight, and grain weight under all water regimes. In clay loam soil, the nematode reduced root weight when the soil was not flooded or flooded only for a short time, from panicle initiation, or booting to maturity, and from sowing to maximum tillering. In <b>clay</b> loam soil, <b>stem</b> and leaf dry weight, as well as grain weight, were reduced by the nematode under all water regimes except continuous flooding or when the soil was flooded from sowing to booting stage. These results indicate that rice cultivar tolerance of M. graminicola varies with water regime and that yield losses due to M. graminicola may be prevented or minimized when the rice crop is flooded early and kept flooded until a late stage of development...|$|R

40|$|U radu se obrađuju nalazi keramičkih lula pronađeni na lokalitetu Kula Gornji ugao u povijesnoj jezgri Dubrovnika. Radi se o istočnim ili mediteranskim tipovima lula tj. austrijsko-mađarskom, turskom, talijanskom i zelovskom tipu. Zastupljene su raznovrsne radionice austrijsko-mađarskih i turskih lula, dok su talijanska i zelovska produkcija predstavljene jednim primjerom. Sve lule datiraju se od kraja 17. do početka 20. stoljeća, a svjedoče o popularnosti konzumacije duhana pomoću keramičkih lula. The article {{deals with}} finds of clay pipes at site “Kula Gornji ugao” in the {{historical}} centre of Dubrovnik. All finds belong to the eastern or Mediterranean pipe type, which is represented in this case by finds of pipesof the Austro–Hungarian, Turkish, Italian or Zelovo subtypes. Fragments belonging to the Austro–Hungarian and Turkish workshops are the most numerous ones, whereas the Zelovo and Italian productions are only represented by one fragment. Among the Austro–Hungarian pipes, the most numerous ones are those with the inscription of the then known workshop centre Schemnitz, present–day Banska Štiavnica in Slovakia. On {{one side of the}} stem, those pipes have stamps with inscriptions: BETTLHEIM / SCHEMNITZ, M. HONIG WE / SCHEMNITZ, M. HÖNIG WE / SCHEMNITZ, M. HÖNIG SOHN/ SCHEMNITZ {{and on the other side}} small stamps that are filled with a portrait, coat of arms, vase with flowers (?) and a dot (?). A larger number of pipes were preserved that have an oval–shaped stamp which contains the workshop name LEOPOLD / GROSS. Next to the name is also a small round stamp with an imprinted illustration of an anchor. Pipes with the workshop name GEORG / WEIGAND are represented by four fragments. Next to the rectangular stamp with the afore–mentioned name is also a small round stamp that is filled with floral motifs. Two fragments carry the inscription WOLF / HALPHEN, next to the rectangular stamp is also a round one in which floral motifs were probably imprinted. Fragments with the inscription PHILIPP / KONRAD, ANTON KILLMAYER (?) and CÖLN / CAFÉ are represented by one exemplar. The first two are made of orange clay whereas the pipe with the inscription CÖLN / CAFÉ is made of white clay and belongs to the so–called Coffeehouse type. Apart from the commonly produced clay pipes–with stamps and characteristic shapes– we also find one pipe with a glaze coat over the clay. All those pipes were made in the area of Central and Southern Europe. It is not known where all workshop centres were located, but we know that Phillip Konrad’s workshop was in Theresienfeld in Austria. The pipes were produced in the moulding technique in shades of orange, red, black and white <b>clay.</b> The <b>stem</b> is regularly shorter than the bowl and has the producer’s stamp on it. All pipes have one connecting hole for the tobacco. Amog these finds there is only one Italian pipe type and is decorated with shallow canellures which have decoration of circles above them. Italian pipes were mostly produced in Chioggia because the area abandone with clay of good quality, but also in Bassano which workshops used to produce foreign brands. Our pipe derives from other workshop center but probably was made in northitalian area. The Turkish pipes are very diversely decorated. Some have smaller round or oval stamps displaying the workshop labels in Arabic letters or floral motifs, while others are painted in red paint while others are painted in red and one is glazed. The fragments discussed in this article are decorated with a wide range of floral and geometric motifs; on the ridge is often a V–line that is imprinted by a serrated wheel or straight lines. There are two exemplars represented that have bowls in shape of a flower calyx. Three fragments particularly stand out, their bowls are flattened and turned into a disc–shaped base. All pipes have a connecting hole for the tobacco. They were made in shades of orange, yellow–grey, ochre, red and one exemplar in white–gray clay. It is not easy to determine the workshop centres in which the Turkish pipe type was produced, but they surely were located in the area of the Ottoman Empire, i. e. in the territory of Europe or Asia Minor. Pipes were produced in the village Zelovo in Sinj in the 18 th and 19 th century. It is the only workshop centre that has been registered in Croatia so far. The Zelovo production is characterized by a combination of Turkish, Venetian and Austrian influences. They were produced in moulds and had often reticular decorations, the initials of the master craftsman in the mould and sometimes the production year as well. In this case, the Zelovo production is represented only by one fragment. There is a very diverse range of pipes that originate from different workshops in Central and Southern Europe and the Asia Minor region as it is revealed to us by their shape, decorative motifs and stamps. The most numerous ones are fragments from Austro– Hungarian pipes, the Turkish ones are slightly less numbered whereas the Zelovo and Italian production are represented by only on fragment. All finds belong to the time from the 17 th to 20 th century and bear testimony to the popularity of tobacco use by means of ceramic pipes, but also to the trade relations between Dubrovnik and various workshop centres...|$|R
