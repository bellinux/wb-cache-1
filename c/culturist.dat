40|$|Mangrove forests have various {{benefits}} both {{economically and}} ecological The excessive uses of mangrove for only fulfilling human needs without replanting will endanger the ecosystem. Deforestation of mangrove forests into aquaculture ponds relates to many factors, {{both internal and}} extemal aspects of the aqua <b>culturists.</b> Survey research method was conducted at Jayamukti Village. The research shows that {{majority of the respondents}} completed primary education. Even though the level education of aqua <b>culturists</b> is low, the knowledge about the benefits of mangrove is already known, specifically about conservation and fish nursery.

40|$|Abstract. -"Shrinkage, " or unaccounted-for {{losses of}} fish during cage rearing, is widely {{acknowledged}} among fish <b>culturists</b> who rear salmonid fishes, but {{the extent of}} such losses has not been documented. Over 60, 000 Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) were reared in floating cages at four locations in Puget Sound, Washington, and were hand-counted {{at the beginning and}} end of 200 + d of rearing. Average unexplained losses were 8 - 38 % for individual locations (three to four cages each) and 2. 5 - 46. 5 % for individual cages. When cage netting remains intact, unexplained losses are probably the result of decomposition of carcasses (particularly during disease outbreaks); scavenging by birds, mammals, and fishes; and to a lesser extent, escapes. The economic consequences of losing fish can be important in terms of lost harvest and increased food costs, resulting in true food conversions 10 - 68 % higher than anticipated. It is widely known among commercial fish <b>culturists</b> that when fishes are held within nets in a body of water, a certain portion of fish assumed to be in cages disappears. Though this unexplained loss of fishes has been recognized for decades (Institute of Fisheries Economics 1971; Kennedy 1975; Secretan 1979), it has never been accurately documented. Even today, commercial fish <b>culturists</b> continue to lose important numbers of salmonid fishes from cages in salt water, estimated to range from 10 % to as much as 30...|$|R

40|$|Cultural Reconstruction asks: How did the U. S. {{develop a}} {{national}} culture simultaneously unified and fractured by race? The little-examined history of American magazines offers a vital clue. The dissertation’s first part demonstrates how post– Jacksonian American <b>culturists,</b> deeply {{disturbed by the}} divisive partisanship of “male” politics, turned to the “female ” culture of sentimentality {{with the hope of}} creating a coherent and inclusive nation. These <b>culturists</b> believed a nationally circulating magazine would be the medium of that culture. This belief derived from the wide success of the penny press revolution of the 1830 s. Cutting against the traditional reading of the penny press, Cultural Reconstruction claims that newspapers were a major proponent of sentimentality but were barred from creating a national audience by their intense local appeal. Antebellum magazinists, from Edgar Allen Poe to James Russell Lowell, attempted to adapt the sentimental worldview of the penny press to a national audience, but were frustrated by a series of cultural rifts expressed chiefly in gendered terms. Part two of the dissertation examines how the post–Civil War magazine furthered the project of sentimentality and became the leading medium of national culture. Responding to th...|$|R

30|$|Cage culture {{plays an}} {{important}} role in achieving higher output and generating more export earnings in Malaysia. However, the cost of fingerlings, feed and labour have increased substantially for cage culture in the coastal areas in Peninsular Malaysia. This paper uses farm level data gathered from Manjung, Perak and Kota Tinggi, Johor to investigate the technical efficiency of brackish water fish cage culture using the stochastic frontier approach. The technical efficiency was estimated and specifically the factors affecting technical inefficiencies of fish cage culture system in Malaysia was investigated. On average, 37 percent of the sampled fish cage farms are technically efficient. The results suggest very high degrees of technical inefficiency exist among the cage <b>culturists.</b> This implies that great potential exists to increase fish production through improved efficiency in cage culture management in Peninsular Malaysia. The results indicate that farmers obtained grouper fingerlings from other neighboring countries due to scarcity of fingerlings from wild sources. The cost of feeding for grouper (Epinephelus fuscoguttatus) requires relatively higher costs compared to seabass (Lates calcarifer) production in cage farms in the study areas. Initiatives to undertake extension programmes at the farm level are needed to help cage <b>culturists</b> in utilizing their resources more efficiently in order to substantially enhance their fish production.|$|R
