5000|$|In 1897, {{the company}} {{decided to move}} the {{business}} from Stora Torg to its present premises on [...] "Wester katt" [...] i.e. next to the well. A new house for brewing and malting was built in 1897-98, {{and it is still}} in use today. Apart from the brewhouse another building was built to house a fermentation basement and a cool ship. Electricity and steam entered the scene and turned the manual labour into something that more and more resembled an industry. In 1905 an electrical <b>cooling</b> <b>machine</b> was acquired which made the cooling of the wort and the fermented beer a lot easier. Before the <b>cooling</b> <b>machine</b> was taken into operation ice from frozen lakes was used.|$|E
5000|$|After his father's {{death in}} 1863, Anton Dreher {{continued}} {{the work on}} the brewing process. He started to export this beer first to the Netherlands, then to Triest (now Trieste), where it was known as Birra Dreher, and then to Germany. In 1871, known as the winter without ice, Dreher constructed a <b>cooling</b> <b>machine</b> to process the beer. He continued to develop the brewery, the mechanization, and the fields, and by 1897 the brewery was producing 739.639 Hectoliters of beer, which was more than double the amount produced under his father in the company's most productive year. [...] The following year, the brewery produced 1.25 million Hectoliters, making it the most productive brewery in the world. By 1913, the brewery in Schwechat was united with brewery in Simmering, and the brewery in another suburb of Vienna, St. Marx, and known as The United Breweries of Schwechat, Simmering, and St. Marx: Dreher, Mautner, Meichle Incorporated. Production declined shrank during World War I, when over half of its employees were needed for military service. The Brewery facility in Schwechat was converted to a hospital, and the other breweries produced Kriegsbier (war beer), for distribution to the troops.|$|E
50|$|Exhaust ducts and/or {{open windows}} {{must be used}} at all times to allow air to {{continually}} escape the air conditioned area. Otherwise, pressure develops and the fan/blower in the system is unable to push much air through the media and into the air conditioned area. The evaporative system cannot function without exhausting the continuous supply of air from the air conditioned area to the outside. By optimizing {{the placement of the}} 'cooled air' inlet, along with the layout of the house passages, related doors and room windows, the system can be used most effectively to direct the cooled air to the required areas. A well designed layout can very effectively scavenge and expel the hot air from desired areas without the need for an above ceiling ducted venting system. Continuous airflow is essential, so the exhaust windows or vents must not restrict the volume and passage of air being introduced by the evaporative <b>cooling</b> <b>machine.</b> One must also be mindful of the outside wind direction, as for example a strong hot southerly wind will slow or restrict the exhausted air from a south facing window. It is always best to have the downwind windows open, while the upwind windows are closed.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this project}} is to {{evaluate}} the possibility to integrate, in terms of energy, the future Nya Studenternas IP and Uppsala University Hospital. The focus is on integration of thermal energy solutions. To cover the cooling demand a seasonal snow storage {{and the use of}} <b>cooling</b> <b>machines</b> is studied. For the heat demand a joint heat storage is investigated which is heated partly with the excess heat from <b>cooling</b> <b>machines.</b> The environmental impact in terms of CO 2 emissions is investigated. A conclusion drawn from the project is that the use of district heating and cooling of Nya Studenternas IP and the Uppsala University Hospital could be reduced in several ways by integrating the energy systems of the two facilities. For instance, with the support of a seasonal snow storage and <b>cooling</b> <b>machines</b> for <b>cooling,</b> and heat obtained from the <b>cooling</b> <b>machines</b> for heating, the emissions of CO 2 could be reduced with 36 % based on a Nordic electricity mixture.

40|$|Thermal energy {{collected}} from a PV-solar {{air heating system}} {{is being used to}} provide cooling for the Mataro Library, near Barcelona. The system is designed to utilise surplus heat available from the ventilated PV facade and PV shed elements during the summer season to provide building cooling. A desiccant <b>cooling</b> <b>machine</b> was installed on the library roof with an additional solar air collector and connected to the existing ventilated PV façade and PV sheds. The desiccant cooling cycle is a novel open heat driven system {{that can be used to}} condition the air supplied to the building interior. Cooling power is supplied to the room space within the building by evaporative cooling of the fresh air supply, and the solar heat from the PV-solar air heating system provides the necessary regeneration air temperature for the desiccant machine. This paper describes the system and gives the main technical details. The cooling performance of the solar powered desiccant cooling system is evaluated by the detailed modelling of the complete cooling process. It is shown that air temperature level of the PV-solar air heating system of 70 °C or more can be efficiently used to regenerate the sorption wheel in the desiccant <b>cooling</b> <b>machine.</b> A solar fraction of 75 % can be achieved by such an innovative system and the average COP of the <b>cooling</b> <b>machine</b> over the summer season is approximate 0. 518...|$|E
40|$|Type of {{refrigerant}} {{the most}} recognized {{and the most}} used today in the vapor compression cycle is R- 12 refrigerant (halocarbon group), which is technically quite good. The refrigerant also has low toxicity and low flammable. But, in the mid 1970 ’s known that chlorine has contained in the refrigerant were released into the environment could damage of ozone in the stratosphere and caused greenhouse effect. Because of that, it using has stopped. An alternative refrigerant is hydrocarbon refrigerant (HCR) and one of it is hydrocarbon- 12 (HCR- 12). HCR- 12 have several advantages, besides friendly environmental because have low global warming effect and low destruction of ozone, this type of refrigerator {{can be used as}} direct changer on the refrigerant machine so no needed compressor replacement and more efficient electric energy than R- 12. In this research, did a study experimental to compared R- 12 with HCR- 12 with used vapor compression <b>cooler</b> <b>machine.</b> The result of measurement have been get performance of vapor compression <b>cooler</b> <b>machine</b> COPR (Coefficient of Performance Refrigeration) and COP (Coefficient of Performance Heat Pump) for R- 12 and HCR- 12 relatively are 2. 4 – 9. 8 (COPRHP) and 3. 4 – 10. 8 (COP) and 6. 4 – 14. 1 (COP R) and 7. 4 – 15. 1 (COPHP).

40|$|The use {{of natural}} {{evaporative}} cooling is one of technical solutions of problem of energy efficiency in air conditioning systems. The use of evaporative cooling in the first combined cooling stage allows reducing the load on the condenser of the <b>cooling</b> <b>machine</b> due to reducing of the condensing temperature. This combination allows {{the use of this}} type of system in any climatic conditions, including regions with small water resources. Multi-porous ceramic structure is used in evaporative air coolers and water coolers in this case. The objective {{of this paper is to}} show advantages of the using of porous ceramic as a working attachment, and to show advantages of the proposed scheme of compression-evaporation systems in comparison with standard vapor compression systems. Experimental research proved the fact, that in the film mode cooling efficiency of air flow is between EA= 0, 6 ÷ 0, 7 and is slightly dependent of water flow. For countries with hot and dry climate where reserves of water are limited, it is recommended to use cyclical regime with EA≈ 0, 65 value, or to use channel regime with a value of EA≈ 0, 55. This leads to considerable energy savings. It has been determined, that combined air conditioning system is completely closed on the consumption of water at the parameters of the outside air equal to tA = 32 ºC and XA> 13 g/kg (in system with direct evaporative <b>cooling</b> <b>machine),</b> and tA= 32 ºC and XA> 12 g/kg (in system with indirect evaporative <b>cooling</b> <b>machine).</b> With these parameters, the cost of water in evaporative cooling stage can be fully compensated by condensate from the evaporator chiller...|$|E

40|$|The {{high energy}} demand on {{buildings}} requires efficient installations and {{the integration of}} renewable energy to achieve the goal of reducing energy consumption using traditional energy sources. Usually, solar energy generation and heating loads have different profiles along a day and their maximums take place at different moments. In addition, in months in which solar production is higher, the heating demands are the minimum (hot water is consumed only domestically in summer). <b>Cooling</b> <b>machines</b> (absorption and adsorption) allow using thermal energy to chill a fluid. This heat flow rate could be recovered from solar collectors or any other heat source. The {{aim of this study}} is to integrate different typologies of solar hybrid (photovoltaic and thermal) collectors with <b>cooling</b> <b>machines</b> getting solar trigeneration and concluding the optimal combination for building applications.
