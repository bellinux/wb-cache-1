Using both the event study methodology {{and a variety of}} GARCH models reveal that central bank interventions, especially koruna purchases were fairly ineffective from 1997 to mid- 1998 compared {{to the size of the}} interventions. However, from mid- 1998 to 2002, koruna sales were surprisingly effective in either smoothing the path of the exchange rate or even reversing the appreciating trend up to 60 days. Higher volatility triggered koruna purchases in the period from 1997 to mid- 1998, which in turn leads to higher volatility. This suggests that the CNB tried in vain to calm the markets after the currency crisis. Koruna sales simply yield more forex rate volatility, a by-product of the monetary authorities’ efforts to counter excessive appreciation. central bank intervention, foreign exchange intervention, transition economies...|$|R
40|$|The authors {{study the}} {{dependence}} of the <b>Czech</b> <b>koruna’s</b> exchange rate to the euro on risk factors that cannot be reduced to standard macroeconomic fundamentals. For this purpose, they construct an international asset-pricing model in which the exchange rate is codetermined by a risk factor imperfectly correlated with other priced risks in the economy. The model embeds the standard no-arbitrage setup. It also contains an additional equation that links the autarchic currency price with the foreign-exchange order flow. In the state-space form, the unobserved variables that determine {{the dynamics of the}} asset markets, the autarchic exchange rate, and the FX order flow span a number of macroeconomic and latent risk factors. The model for the Czech koruna/euro exchange rate uses Kalman filter techniques. The results indicate the existence of a “non-fundamental” source of systematic divergence between the observed and the autarchic (i. e. fundamental) FX returns. exchange rate, latent risk, order flow, pricing kernel, state space...|$|R

50|$|In 2012, {{inflation}} {{was expected to}} fall well below the target, leading the CNB to gradually reduce the level of its basic monetary policy instrument, the 2-week repo rate, until the zero lower bound (actually 0.05 percent) was reached in late 2012. In light {{of the threat of}} a further fall in inflation and possibly even of a protracted period of deflation, on 7 November 2013 the CNB declared an immediate commitment to weaken the exchange rate to the level of 27 <b>Czech</b> <b>korunas</b> per 1 euro (day-on-day weakening by about 5 percent) and to keep the exchange rate from getting stronger than this value until at least the end of 2014 (later on this was changed to the second half of 2016).

When a contestant gets the tenth question correct, he leaves with at least 320,000 CZK. Nobody won the main prize. The format was briefly adopted by another TV station under the name Milionář.

40|$|We {{investigate}} the fiscal {{implications of the}} changes in personal income tax implemented in the Czech Republic in January 2006. In addition to evaluating the direct effect of this tax reform, our analysis takes into account its employment effect on the government budget due to individuals entering or leaving employment. We first estimate the probability of working (labor supply) {{as a function of the}} effective net wage and then simulate the impact {{of the changes in}} paid taxes and received benefits on employment. We find that a 10 percent rise in the net wage increases the probability of working by 0. 55 and 0. 18 percentage points for women and men respectively. These estimates suggest that the employment effect is unlikely to substantially alleviate the fall in net budget revenues. We predict that, for the sub-population of prime age employees, net government revenues decline by roughly 8 billion <b>Czech</b> <b>korunas</b> (CZK) as a consequence of the implemented income tax cuts. The employment effect counteracts the decline by only CZK 0. 4 billion. The stimulating effect of the tax reform on employment is reduced by the current benefit system: the incentive to work due to the higher after-tax wage is partially offset by the fall in social benefits once people start working.
