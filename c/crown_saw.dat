On February 26, 1606, he made landfall at the Pennefather River on the western shore of Cape York in Queensland, near the modern town of Weipa. This is the first recorded European landfall on the Australian continent. Janszoon proceeded to chart some 320 km of the coastline, which he thought was a southerly extension of New Guinea.

5000|$|However, {{this did}} not settle the issue of Aboriginal title over the land. At the time the Royal Charter was granted in 1670, the Crown {{did not have the}} {{authority}} to give jurisdiction of sovereignty over the territory already settled and inhabited by the Indigenous people of North America. The Royal Charter ignored the First Nations who were already living on the land and exercising sovereignty over it, and the Hudson’s Bay Company had not acquired title to the land from the Aboriginal communities prior to their negotiations with Canada that began in 1856. Due to the Royal Charter and the later Rupert's Land Act 1868, the Crown held the attitude that they already possessed the land, and that the treaties were a peaceful way to allow for settlement of the Northwest Territories in lands the Crown already owned. While the First Nations understood the treaties to be between nations to share the land (ownership of the land was not a concept in First Nation’s cultures), the <b>Crown</b> <b>saw</b> them as a way to ensure sovereignty over the land from a people who only had sovereignty as a [...] "personal and usufructuary right, dependent upon the good will of the Sovereign" [...] in the Royal Proclamation of 1763 ("at the time of the discovery of America, and long after, it was an accepted rule that heathen and infidel nations were perpetual enemies, and that the Christian prince or people first discovering and taking possession of the country became its absolute proprietor, and could deal with the lands as such.") The Calder v British Columbia (AG) case in 1973 was the first case in Canadian law that acknowledged [...] "a declaration that the aboriginal title, otherwise known as the Indian title, of the plaintiffs to their ancient tribal territory hereinbefore described, has never been lawfully extinguished."

5000|$|Within fifty years, {{during the}} reign of Henry II's son King John, Ashley castle was {{restored}} by a new owner, William Briwere the elder. William Briwere held the manor of Ashley, was a leading counsellor of King John (and later King Henry III), and indeed in early accounts was referred to as one of his [...] "evil advisers". [...] He was also a signatory of Magna Carta (though seemingly a reluctant one), and founded nearby Mottisfont Abbey, a house of Augustinian canons. In 1200 King John granted Briwere a licence to crenellate a number of castles, including, in Hampshire, one at either Stockbridge or Ashley (at Briwere's election). Briwere chose Ashley (referred to in the grant as [...] "Esleg"). [...] In an age when the <b>crown</b> <b>saw</b> a potential rebel stronghold in each castle held by the nobility, and the Anarchy was a recent memory, permission to fortify in this way was a rare privilege. King John is documented as having stayed frequently at Ashley, possibly in connection with hunting expeditions in the royal Forest of Bere - of which the nearby river Test formed the western boundary at the time. [...] Official crown business is known to have been transacted from the castle, as a number of royal letters from this era are headed 'Ashley'. Ashley was the administrative headquarters of West Bere, which stretched from the river Itchen to the river Test. The warden had his manor there, and would have stayed in the castle when in residence (Briwere had other estates as well). Many English forests had a castle headquarters of this sort. In addition to serving as a residence, pleas were heard, poachers sometimes imprisoned and forest officers housed there. Despite its role as an administrative base for crown land, Ashley Castle appears always to have been considered as part of the manor of Ashley rather than as crown property, and the interests of the wardens were often allowed to overrule the interest of the sovereigns whose property {{they were supposed to be}} protecting.|$|E
40|$|From {{the time}} human beings began {{cultivating}} crops, {{the quest for}} fertile crop land has been a prime objective. Since antiquity, farmers expanded their fields by clearing trees within or {{along the edges of}} neighboring forests. Likewise, as the population of Europe grew during the medieval period, the expansion of arable land was an important activity. In England, much of the land was cleared in a piecemeal fashion, via the assarts of both small and large landholders. Land clearance was an economically and environmentally important activity for all levels of society, yet historians, including agricultural historians, have largely ignored the process. From T. A. M. Bishop 2 ̆ 7 s 1935 Economic History Review article 2 ̆ 2 Assarting and the Growth of the Open Fields, 2 ̆ 2 to Charles Young 2 ̆ 7 s The Royal Forests of Medieval England, land clearance has been treated only tangentially.;Assarting had an important impact on the countryside of medieval England, but assarts and their economic and political ramifications have largely been neglected by historians. The study of assarting is essential to understanding the growth of government and the impact it had on the countryside. This study provides a broad examination of the Pipe Roll evidence concerning assarts on royal lands in England between 1154 and 1189, making a contribution not only to land history, but {{to our understanding of the}} development of medieval government and the Exchequer.;The evidence found in the Pipe Rolls indicates that illegal assarting in the Anglo-Norman era not only occurred more frequently than historians heretofore have believed, but that contrary to established notions, it was not truly discouraged by the crown 2 ̆ 7 s Forest Law; The engine driving the land clearance was a growing population and the need for food. The land was clearly worth the price of the fine to the assarters, and evidence suggests that the <b>crown</b> <b>saw</b> the infractions made by assarters as tolerable because of the income it drew from the fines levied on the cleared lands...|$|E
