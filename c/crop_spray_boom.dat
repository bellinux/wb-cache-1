40|$|As {{a result}} of the {{decreasing}} availability of authorized plant protection products, adequate pest control becomes more difficult in many ornamental crops and almost no information is available about the optimization of spray application techniques in ornamental <b>crops.</b> Yet, <b>spray</b> <b>boom</b> systems-instead of the still predominantly used <b>spray</b> guns-might improve <b>crop</b> protection management in greenhouses considerably. Application rate, nozzle type, and configuration will influence the spray deposition and, as such, its efficiency. In this study, spray deposition in ivy pot plants [Hedera algeriensis cv. Montgomery, Hibb. ], grown on hanging shelves in greenhouses, was compared with a traditional spray gun with a disc-core nozzle and a manually pulled trolley equipped with two vertical <b>spray</b> <b>booms.</b> The sprayings with the spray gun were performed at an application rate of 8500 L. ha(- 1). For the vertical <b>spray</b> <b>boom</b> system, two different reduced application rates (2500 and 5000 L. ha(- 1)) with five different combinations of nozzle type, size, and pressure for each application rate were investigated. This research underlined that, besides the application rate, also the spray application equipment used has an important effect on the spray depositions. Nozzle type, size, and pressure on the vertical <b>spray</b> <b>boom</b> system only had a minor effect on the spray deposition. Although the spray gun performed well on the easily accessible crop zone with the runners, its performance in the more dense main crop zone was inferior. With 240 % more sprayed liquid (8500 L. ha(- 1)) and chemicals, the realized depositions in this crop zone were not significantly different from the ones obtained with the vertical <b>spray</b> <b>boom</b> system applying only 2500 L. ha(- 1). Spraying at 5000 L. ha(- 1), the vertical <b>spray</b> <b>boom</b> system achieved a 82. 9 % higher overall spray deposition in the main crop canopy zone compared with the spray gun at an application rate of 8500 L. ha(- 1). For the sprays applied with the vertical <b>spray</b> <b>boom</b> system, doubling the application rate resulted in equally higher spray depositions, except for the inner canopy deposition for which higher application rates were more effective...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT The <b>spray</b> <b>boom</b> {{is one of}} {{the sprayer}} {{components}} that most affect the application quality and may cause phytotoxicity and overlay application problems. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the displacement in the vertical and horizontal movements of the <b>spray</b> <b>booms</b> in three models of self-propelled boom sprayers. The vibrations of the <b>spray</b> <b>boom</b> in the vertical direction was measured using three receivers (GNSS) with RTK differential correction. The vibration measurements in the horizontal direction were determined using a high resolution camera. At the end, the processed data were entered into a spreadsheet for the descriptive statistics. The smallest <b>spray</b> <b>boom</b> movement in the horizontal direction was obtained by the specimen 2. No statistical differences were observed between the different speeds for the <b>spray</b> <b>boom</b> vibration in the horizontal and vertical directions, in the evaluated sprayers. The largest vertical movements of the <b>spray</b> <b>booms</b> were observed for the self-propelled specimen 3. The impact/collision route type showed the highest deviations and, in undulating and gentle to undulating types, {{there was no significant difference}} in deviation values...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Distribution {{pattern of}} <b>spray</b> <b>boom</b> in fields is {{affected}} by several parameters {{which one of the}} important reasons is horizontal and vertical vibrations because of unevenness surfaces. <b>Spray</b> <b>boom</b> movements lead to decrease of spread efficiency and crop yield. Generally, active suspension is employed to control and attenuate the vibration of sprayer booms because these suspensions reduce the high frequency vibration of <b>spray</b> <b>booms</b> thanks to irregularities soil. In this research, a proportional-integral-derivative controller with active force control is used to remove undesired rolling of <b>spray</b> <b>boom.</b> Simulation results depict that the proposed scheme is more effective and accurate than PID control only scheme. The AFC based scheme shows the robustness and accuracy compared to the PID controller...|$|R
40|$|Undesired {{vertical}} and rolling rigid body motions and excessive horizontal {{movements of the}} <b>spray</b> <b>boom</b> {{are some of the}} main sources of an irregular spray pattern. The algorithm presented in this paper, relates unevenness in spray deposition,with these <b>spray</b> <b>boom</b> motions. The method is computationally attractive since no advanced mathematics are involved. The three dimensional static spray distribution model of a nozzle which can be measured quite easily under laboratory conditions is used to calculate the spray deposit distribution generated by the same type of nozzle mounted on a moving <b>spray</b> <b>boom.</b> (C) 1997 Silsoe Research Institute. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|In This Issue: HERBICIDE APPLICATION Weed {{control with}} {{herbicides}} {{depends on the}} uniform application of dependable herbicides. A sprayer is needed which will allow for both uniform application and correct droplet size at desired spray volumes. The sprayer should be of sufficient capacity to handle the acreage involved. AGITATION Agitation of most spray solutions is necessary. Any separation will vary the spray concentration. For a simple orifice jet agitator, a flow of 6 gallons per minute for every 100 gallons of tank capacity is usually adequate. SPRAY BOOMS The use of gauge wheels helps maintain the proper distance between the spray nozzle and the target especially on uneven ground, going across terraces, etc. A <b>spray</b> <b>boom</b> where the height and angle of the spray nozzles can be changed is also desirable. The supply lines to and on the <b>spray</b> <b>boom</b> must be of adequate size for even distribution. It is best to have the supply line coming {{to the center of}} the <b>spray</b> <b>boom</b> section and distribute from that point rather than coming in on the end of the <b>spray</b> <b>boom</b> and running the chance of less pressure at the far end. Many sprayers, now, are being designed with wet booms and are fitted with assemblies that protrude 1 / 3 to 1 / 2 way into the boom which take the spray solution out of the middle of the boom. PVC Schedule 80 makes an excellent wet boom if supported adequately. The wet boom, which takes the spray solution from the middle, will help keep materials like sand and rust in the bottom of the <b>spray</b> <b>boom</b> which can be flushed out of the end of the <b>spray</b> <b>boom</b> when it is cleaned. This requires valves or plugs on the end of the <b>spray</b> <b>boom.</b> Shutoff controls are needed that allow use of 1 / 3 to 1 / 2 of the <b>spray</b> <b>boom</b> when necessary...|$|R

40|$|Spray drift can {{be defined}} as the {{quantity}} of plant protection product that is carried out of the sprayed area by the action of air currents during the application process. This continues to be a major problem in applying agricultural pesticides. The purpose of this research is to measure the amount of sedimenting drift from a horizontal boom sprayer for different (drift reducing) spray application techniques under field conditions and to compare the results with the results from a reference spray, taking into account variations in meteorological conditions during the field drift experiments. Field drift measurements were performed for several combinations of nozzle type (standard flat-fan, low-drift, air inclusion) and size (ISO 02, 03, 04, and 06), spray pressure (2. 0, 3. 0, and 4. 0 bar), driving speed (4, 6, 8, and 10 km h(- 1)), and <b>spray</b> <b>boom</b> height (0. 3, 0. 5, and 0. 75 m) according to ISO 22866 by sampling in a defined downwind area at 24 different positions using horizontal drift collectors. The reference spray was defined as a standard horizontal <b>spray</b> <b>boom</b> without air support, a <b>spray</b> <b>boom</b> height of 0. 50 m, a nozzle distance of 0. 50 m, ISO 110 03 standard flat-fan nozzles at 3. 0 bar (1. 2 L min(- 1)), and a driving speed of 8 km h(- 1), resulting in an application rate of approximately 180 L ha(- 1). Nozzle type as well as spray pressure, driving speed, and <b>spray</b> <b>boom</b> height, have an important effect on the amount of spray drift. Larger nozzle sizes, lower spray pressures and driving speeds, and lower <b>spray</b> <b>boom</b> heights generally reduce spray drift. Concerning nozzle types, air inclusion nozzles have the highest drift reduction potential, followed by the low-drift nozzles and the standard flat-fan nozzles. Drift results are closely linked with droplet size characteristics of the sprays...|$|R

In this regulation, drift reducing spray application techniques can be used to reduce buffer zones. The purpose of this research is to measure and compare the amount of drift sediment for different spray application techniques under field conditions. A drift prediction equation for the reference spraying was used to compare other spraying techniques with the reference spraying, under different weather conditions. Drift measurements were performed for several combinations of nozzle type (flat fan, low-drift, air injection) and size (ISO 02, 03, 04 and 06), spray pressure (2, 3 and 4 bar), driving speed (4, 6, 8 and 10 km. h- 1) and <b>spray</b> <b>boom</b> height (0. 3, 0. 5 and 0. 75 m).

40|$|Pesticide {{application}} {{is an essential}} practice on farms in Kentucky where glyphosate resistant crops and no-till farming strategies are becoming more popular. Off-rate pesticide application errors {{are the result of}} incorrect concentrations applied to an area of the field and may result from velocity changes along the <b>spray</b> <b>boom</b> while the sprayer is turning, pressure changes across the width of the <b>spray</b> <b>boom,</b> and changes in effective boom height due to undulating terrain. In an attempt to estimate potential errors resulting from sprayer turning movements, a method was developed to compare the differences in application areas between control sections across the <b>spray</b> <b>boom.</b> The area covered by the two center boom control section positions was considered the “target rate” and the difference in these areas and the remaining control sections were compared to determine errors in coverage areas. The results of the analysis conducted on three irregular shaped fields (containing impassable grassed waterways) indicated that {{a substantial portion of the}} fields (14 - 24 %) could have been applied well above or below the target application rate +/- 10 %.

5000|$|The main design {{criteria}} were {{set by the}} disposable nature of the aircraft's load and its rugged and hazardous working environment. The first required the load in its hopper to be placed at the aerodynamic center, about 25% chord; safety demanded a good view from the cockpit in all directions but particularly forwards, so the cockpit was placed high behind the hopper with the forward fuselage sloping downwards at 15°. The seat was designed to withstand 40g's [...] The cockpit was open but with two strong, curved longitudinal frames to ease any obstructions, cables and the like, safely over the pilot's head. The leading edges of the undercarriage legs were sharpened to cut through similar hazards. Good low-speed flight characteristics, even with a heavy load, were also essential, calling for a high-lift wing. The all-metal Ag-1 was a cantilever low wing monoplane with an unusually thick (thickness/chord 21%), constant chord wing, fitted with full span slotted flaps and slot-lip ailerons. [...] It had a short centre section with no dihedral and outer panels with 5° of dihedral. The legs of the fixed, conventional undercarriage, with wheels fitted with low pressure tyres, were mounted on this inner wing section, which also contained internal tanks, capacity 150 UG gal (125 Imp gal, 568 L) for <b>crop</b> <b>spraying</b> liquid.
