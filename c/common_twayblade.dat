50|$|These ancient meadows are {{traditionally}} managed by grazing and cutting for hay. They have a rich variety of flora, such as green-winged orchid, bee orchid, <b>common</b> <b>twayblade,</b> pepper saxifrage, adder's tongue fern and ox-eye daisy.|$|E
50|$|The site is {{calcareous}} clay pasture {{with a wide}} variety of plant species, including the herbs oxeye daisy and yellow rattle. There are orchids such as <b>common</b> <b>twayblades</b> and <b>common</b> spotteds.|$|R
50|$|Orchids in this coppiced wood include early-purples, lesser <b>twayblades,</b> <b>common</b> spotteds {{and greater}} butterflies. There are many birds, badgers and deer.|$|R
50|$|Neottia bifolia (syn. Listera australis), <b>common</b> name {{southern}} <b>twayblade,</b> is {{a species}} of terrestrial orchid found in eastern Canada (from Nova Scotia to Ontario) and the eastern United States (from Florida west to eastern Texas and north to Vermont).|$|R
50|$|The neutral {{grassland}} component {{varies in}} character and herb richness. There {{is a strong}} population of green-winged orchid (Orchis morio), together with a few plants of <b>common</b> <b>twayblade</b> (Neottia ovata). In a few areas meadow thistle (Cirsium dissectum) occurs.|$|E
50|$|This is {{a medieval}} coppice with {{standards}} wood on wet boulder clay, and it has bery diverse ground flora, including species typical of ancient woodland. Oak is the main standard tree, and there are orchids such as <b>common</b> <b>twayblade,</b> early purple orchid and butterfly orchid.|$|E
50|$|Sightings of a {{range of}} bird and land life have been noted here. The fauna {{includes}} kingfishers, brown hare, grass snakes , bitterns, ruddy darters, and the great crested grebe. Plant life includes <b>common</b> <b>twayblade,</b> common spotted orchid, spindle, small leaved lime, woodruff, greater stitchwort, sanicle, and the early purple orchid.|$|E
50|$|Neottia convallarioides is {{a species}} of orchid known by the <b>common</b> names broad-lipped <b>twayblade</b> and {{broad-leaved}} twayblade. It was formerly placed in the genus Listera, but molecular phylogenetic {{studies have shown that}} Neottia nidus-avis, the bird's-nest orchid, evolved within the same group, and all species of Listera have been moved to Neottia.|$|R
50|$|Neottia banksiana is {{a species}} of orchid known by the <b>common</b> name northwestern <b>twayblade.</b> It was {{formerly}} placed in the genus Listera, but molecular phylogenetic {{studies have shown that}} Neottia nidus-avis, the bird's-nest orchid, evolved within the same group, and all species of Listera have been moved to Neottia. Older scientific names include Listera banksiana and Listera caurina.|$|R
50|$|Nob End was {{designated}} as a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) (file designation SD70/2) in 1988, under Section 28 of the Wildlife and Countryside Act, 1981. and as a Local Nature Reserve (LNR) in 2000. The contamination of the land from the old chemical works with waste from the Leblanc process has resulted in an alkaline soil that now supports a variety of plants not found elsewhere in Greater Manchester, including many types of orchid, most notable amongst these are Fragrant orchid Gymnadenia conopsea, the Northern Marsh orchid Dactylorhiza purpurella, the Early Marsh orchid Dactylorhiza incarnata and other species such as <b>Common</b> Broomrape, <b>Twayblade,</b> Blue fleabane and Carline thistle. The reserve covers 8.8 hectares (21 acres).|$|R
50|$|Green-winged orchids (Anacamptis morio) {{are also}} {{present on the}} site, {{in one of the}} largest populations within the vice-county of Monmouthshire. This orchid is {{becoming}} increasingly uncommon within Monmouthshire as well as nationally. Other orchids found on the reserve include the common spotted (Dactylorhiza fuchsii), <b>common</b> <b>twayblade</b> (Neottia ovata) and the greater butterfly (Platanthera chlorantha).|$|E
50|$|The {{grassland}} flora {{is made up}} of a {{wide range}} of limestone-loving plants which include field scabious, lady's bedstraw, common bird's-foot-trefoil and oxeye daisy. Various colour-forms of greater knapweed may be found as well as <b>common</b> <b>twayblade.</b> Cowslips bloom in the spring. White campion, common toadflax and mouse-ear hawkweed are also supported. Common cornsalad may also be found which is becoming increasingly rare.|$|E
50|$|The ground flora is {{dominated}} by common woodland plants such as Wild Garlic Allium ursinum, Bluebell Hyacinthoides non-scripta and Yellow Archangel Lamium galeobdolon, but less common species that also occur include Goldilocks Ranunculus auricomus, Alternate-leaved Golden Saxifrage Chrysosplenium alternifolium, Wood Vetch Vicia sylvatica, Common Toothwort Lathraea squamaria, Giant Bellflower Campanula latifolia, <b>Common</b> <b>Twayblade</b> Neottia ovata, Hard Shield Fern Polystichum aculeatum and Thin-spiked Wood Sedge Carex strigosa.|$|E
50|$|Officially {{designated}} a Site of Nature Conservation Importance in an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, {{much of the}} Worth Way forms an important wildlife corridor supporting {{a wide variety of}} fauna and flora. The former railway cuttings and embankments have been progressively colonised by trees, notably silver birch, ash, hazel and sallow, which have developed into mature woodland. In addition, in areas where chalk was used {{in the construction of the}} railway line, chalk-loving plants such as guelder rose, <b>common</b> spotted orchid, <b>twayblade</b> and wild strawberry have flourished. The trees and plants attract in turn a variety of wildlife, including over two hundred species of insect which feed on the sallow. Butterflies are also common, with brimstones in spring, the white admiral and speckled wood from June followed by meadow brown, ringlet and skippers in high summer.|$|R
50|$|A second subcommunity (MG5a) {{is present}} and is characterised by the legume Meadow vetchling (Lathyrus pratensis). Other species present in this subcommunity include Salad burnet (Sanguisorba minor), Quaking grass (Briza media), Pignut (Conopodium majus) and the Orchid species: <b>Common</b> <b>Twayblade</b> (Neottia ovata) and Early Purple Orchid (Orchis mascula). The subcommunity also {{contains}} Meadow barley (Hordeum secalinum), a perennial grass, {{which is a}} characteristic species of the Tees Lowland.|$|E
50|$|The small {{site is a}} {{steeply sloping}} area of meadow and woodland, {{and it has been}} {{designated}} an SSSI as a rare example of unimproved chalk grassland. Grass species include upright brome, false brome and sheep's fescue, and there are many orchids, especially <b>common</b> <b>twayblade</b> and common spotted orchid. There are also many butterflies, such as marbled white and the rare Duke of Burgundy. The woodland has birds such as green woodpeckers and finches.|$|E
50|$|Neottia ovata (eggleaf {{twayblade}} or <b>Common</b> <b>Twayblade)</b> is a terrestrial orchid widespread {{across much}} of Europe, including the British Isles, as well as Siberia, Central Asia, Southwest Asia and the Himalayas. It has been introduced into Ontario, Canada, {{where it has been}} called the Eggleaf Twayblade. It was formerly placed in the genus Listera, but molecular phylogenetic studies have shown that Neottia nidus-avis, the Bird's-nest Orchid, evolved within the same group, and the two genera have been combined.|$|E
50|$|The {{nature reserve}} is {{situated}} in and around Parika bog, and consists {{of a system of}} bogs and small lakes. It is an important habitat for several species of orchid, including coralroot orchid, common spotted orchid and <b>common</b> <b>twayblade,</b> but also other e.g. Nymphaea candida. The bird-life of the nature reserve is also rich; species commonly found here include the lesser spotted eagle, black stork and grey heron. Two trails for visitors have been prepared in the nature reserve.|$|E
50|$|A {{comparison}} of vegetation surveys of Scotstown Moor, performed in 1968 and 1998, {{shows that the}} number of plant species in the area has declined. Species have been lost from all habitat types, although those of the open water and open/waste ground have suffered the most. For example, marsh arrowgrass (Triglochin palustris), early marsh orchid (Dactylorhiza incarnata), <b>common</b> <b>twayblade</b> (Listera cordata), corn spurrey (Spergula arvensis) and various species of dead nettle (Lamium spp.) have all been lost from the site.|$|E
50|$|The meadows {{support a}} show of {{thousands}} (estimated at 45,000) of green-winged orchid in May, a colony of some size {{in this part of}} Gloucestershire. Also flowering in the late spring are <b>common</b> <b>twayblade,</b> adder's-tongue, cowslip, bluebell, and pignut. Taller grass and flowers develop over the summer and produce a haycrop at that time. Recordings include quaking-grass, common knapweed, meadow vetchling, downy oat-grass, field scabious, meadow buttercup, yellow-rattle, oxeye daisy, common bird's-foot trefoil, goat's-beard, fairy flax and Devil's-bit scabious. Meadow saffron flowers following the hay cut.|$|E
5000|$|The site {{consists}} of three unimproved fields described as a [...] "species-rich lowland meadow" [...] classified as type MG5. It is described as the best remaining area of clay or neutral lowland meadow remaining in Suffolk. Floral species include snake's-head fritillary (Fritillaria meleagris), early purple orchid (Orchis mascula), green-winged orchid (Anacamptis morio), pyramidal orchid (Anacamptis pyramidalis), <b>common</b> <b>twayblade</b> (Listera ovata), meadow saffron (Colchicum autumnale), adder's-tongue fern (Ophioglossum vulgatum), pepper saxifrage (Silaum silaus) and rim lichen (Lecanora pulicaris). Notable fauna includes great-crested newt (Triturus cristatus) and barn owl (Tyto alba).|$|E
50|$|Wda {{runs through}} many multispecies {{deciduous}} forests, in which contains diverse lichens. The river meanders also through riparian forests and alder forests. Rare mountain ash brekinii {{can be found}} in the Zygmunt Czubiński Reserve “Brzęki” in Szczerkowo. Next rare and protected plants on Wda's route are: lycopodium clavatum, diphasiastrum complanatum, lycopodium annotinum, sundew, western marsh orchid, heath spotted orchid, lesser butterfly-orchid, broad-leaved helleborine, european <b>common</b> <b>twayblade</b> and arctostaphylos uva-ursi, which are found in Wdecki Landscape Park.This region of Poland houses species like: cranes, common goldeneyes, goosanders, western marsh harriers, ruffs, kingfishers, trouts, common vipers, fire salamanders, tree frogs and great crested newts.|$|E
50|$|From {{the village}} of Kloster over the Hucke to the tourist cafe of Zum Klausner in the Tannengrund valley is a mixed wood of Scots pine, beech, English oak, hornbeam, wild cherry, Swedish whitebeam, {{sycamore}} maple and Norway maple. In the west - on the former clifftop dunes - field maple, hawthorn, silver birch, hazel, willows, roses, fly honeysuckle, buckthorn, blackthorn (sloe), spindle and alpine currant are mainly found. North of Kloster, {{in the area of}} the old bird ornithological station, there are a few large- and small-leaved limes as well as hybrids of both species. Old man's beard, common hop, common polypody, false brome, <b>common</b> <b>twayblade,</b> which has become extremely rare on Hiddensee, and common moonwort, as well as the still common broad-leaved helleborine form an undergrowth. Early bloomers are e. g. wood violet, lesser celandine und ivy-leaved speedwell. The rich orchid communities, for which Hiddensee was formerly well-known have, however, disappeared.|$|E
50|$|The {{vegetation}} of {{the area}} is divided into layers like any natural habitat in the temperate climatic zone. On the field layer are mosses and fungi (penny bun or cep, honey fungus), in addition there is the herbaceous layer, which is characterized by various species depending on the season. In spring when the soil is warmed up quickly by sunlight, spring flowers like hepatica appear, which conjure up blue carpets on the forest floor, followed by anemone. As the temperatures rise, leaves sprout on the trees. The level of sunlight under the trees reduces and species such as Spring Vetchling, Lily of the Valley, May Lily, Moschatel, Herb Paris and Woodruff appear, which flourish under conditions of low light. As the foliage becomes denser, shade-loving summer flowers appear. The first ones are the remaining native orchids of our deciduous forests. On the Streckelsberg: <b>Common</b> <b>Twayblade,</b> Lesser Butterfly-orchid, Bird's-nest Orchid and Red helleborine. Rather less colourful summer flowers in the beech woods are the Small Balsam, Common Figwort, Wood Avens, Wall Lettuce, Baneberry and Enchanter's-nightshade. Characteristic grasses of the herbaceous layer of the beech forest are False Brome, Wood Melick and Giant Fescue. The overlying shrub layer consists of bushes and saplings, such as Elder, Rowan, Fly Honeysuckle, Common Honeysuckle, Dewberry, Raspberry, Blackthorn, Common Ivy, Alpine Currant, Hazel, Goat Willow, Bird Cherry, three species of wild rose, Common Buckthorn and Viburnum. There are also young trees of the species Norway Maple, Sycamore and Silver Birch. The tree layer is dominated by beech trees that are more than 180 years old and, {{on the slopes of}} the hill, by equally ancient Scots Pines.|$|E
