5|$|Since 1869, the Mount Washington <b>Cog</b> <b>Railway</b> has {{provided}} tourists with a train {{journey to the}} summit of Mount Washington. It uses a Marsh rack system {{and was the first}} successful rack railway in the US.|$|E
5|$|The Mount Washington <b>Cog</b> <b>Railway</b> ascends {{the western}} {{slope of the}} {{mountain}}, and the Mount Washington Auto Road climbs to the summit from the east. The mountain is popular with hikers (the Appalachian Trail crosses the summit). Other common activities include glider flying, and annual cycle and running races such as the Auto Road Bicycle Hillclimb and Road Race.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the western}} slope that the <b>Cog</b> <b>Railway</b> ascends is {{straightforward}} from base to summit, the mountain's other sides are more complex. On the north side, Great Gulf—the mountain's largest glacial cirque—forms an amphitheater {{surrounded by the}} Northern Presidentials: Mounts Clay, Jefferson, Adams and Madison. These connected peaks reach well into the treeless alpine zone. Massive Chandler Ridge extends northeast from the summit of Washington to form the amphitheater's southern wall and the incline is ascended by the Mount Washington Auto Road.|$|E
50|$|The practice, though longstanding, is {{considered}} offensive {{by some of}} the <b>Cog</b> <b>Railway's</b> passengers. An off-duty New Hampshire State Trooper and a Forest Ranger began riding the train and arresting hikers who mooned it. During the autumn of 2007, eight hikers were arrested and were to be charged in a federal court, due to the act having taken place in a National Forest.|$|R
50|$|The Schneeberg Railway (Schneebergbahn) is one {{of three}} rack {{railways}} in Austria still operating, and runs from the small town of Puchberg am Schneeberg in Lower Austria up to a plateau beneath the Schneeberg summit. At 2076 m, the Schneeberg is the highest mountain in Lower Austria. The other two working <b>cog</b> <b>railways</b> in Austria are the Schafberg Railway (opened in 1893) and the Achensee Railway (opened in 1889).|$|R
50|$|There {{are various}} types of trains that are {{designed}} for particular purposes. A train can consist {{of a combination of}} one or more locomotives and attached railroad cars, or a self-propelled multiple unit (or occasionally a single or articulated powered coach, called a railcar). Trains can also be hauled by horses, pulled by a cable, or run downhill by gravity.Special kinds of trains running on corresponding special 'railways' are atmospheric railways, monorails, high-speed railways, maglev, rubber-tired underground, funicular and <b>cog</b> <b>railways.</b>|$|R
25|$|The <b>Cog</b> <b>Railway</b> also rosters eight wooden coaches.|$|E
25|$|Tourist railroads {{include the}} Conway Scenic Railroad, Hobo-Winnipesaukee Railroad, and the Mount Washington <b>Cog</b> <b>Railway.</b>|$|E
25|$|The <b>cog</b> <b>railway</b> {{designs and}} builds {{all of its}} {{locomotives}} and passenger coaches at the company shops located {{at the base of}} Mt. Washington.|$|E
50|$|Originally {{almost all}} <b>cog</b> <b>railways</b> were powered by steam {{locomotive}}s. The steam locomotive {{needs to be}} extensively modified to work effectively in this environment. Unlike a diesel locomotive or electric locomotive, the steam locomotive only works when its powerplant (the boiler, in this case) is fairly level. The locomotive boiler requires water to cover the boiler tubes and firebox sheets at all times, particularly the crown sheet, the metal top of the firebox. If this is not covered with water, {{the heat of the}} fire will soften it enough to give way under the boiler pressure, leading to a catastrophic failure.|$|R
2500|$|The steam {{locomotives}} on {{the railway}} generate {{large amounts of}} smoke, nicknamed <b>Cog</b> Smog. The <b>railway</b> is exempted from the state's air-pollution-control law (RSA 125-C:20), which exempts [...] "any steam locomotives and engines or replacements thereof used {{in connection with the}} operation of a railroad or railway which were in operation or on order prior to January 1, 1973, and are located entirely within the state." ...|$|R

25|$|In August 1869, President Ulysses S. Grant visited New England {{to escape}} the Washington heat. During his tour he rode the <b>cog</b> <b>railway</b> {{to the top of}} Mount Washington.|$|E
25|$|The {{most common}} trips on the <b>Cog</b> <b>Railway</b> are {{between the two}} main stations, one at the summit and the other {{adjacent}} to the operators' logistical and repair base.|$|E
25|$|Most of the Mount Washington <b>Cog</b> <b>Railway</b> is in Thompson and Meserve's Purchase, {{with the}} part of the railway nearest to Mt. Washington's summit being in Sargent's Purchase.|$|E
25|$|In 2007, the {{historic}} Mt. Washington <b>Cog</b> <b>Railway</b> added the first biodiesel locomotive to its all-steam locomotive fleet. The fleet has {{climbed up the}} western slopes of Mount Washington in New Hampshire since 1868 with a peak vertical climb of 37.4 degrees.|$|E
25|$|Initially, {{there was}} no way for two trains to pass one another on the Mount Washington <b>Cog</b> <b>Railway.</b> In 1941, a nine-motion switch was invented, and two spur sidings were added, each long enough to divert two {{descending}} trains so that climbing trains could continue to the summit, enabling more round trips per day.|$|E
25|$|Most {{visitors}} reach Zermatt by <b>cog</b> <b>railway</b> {{train from}} {{the nearby town of}} Täsch (Zermatt shuttle). Trains also depart for Zermatt from farther down the valley at Visp and Brig, which are on the main Swiss rail network. The town also has a heliport (ICAO: LSEZ) and a local helicopter operator, Air Zermatt, which also provides alpine rescue services.|$|E
25|$|The {{first of}} two major {{accidents}} in the railway's history occurred in 1929, involving locomotive #1 (first named Hero and later Peppersass because of its vertical boiler's resemblance to a pepper sauce bottle). This locomotive was used to build the railway and was lost for many years, {{as it had been}} moved about the country and placed on display at numerous exhibitions. The owners of the railway at the time (the Boston & Maine Railroad) decided to restore Peppersass and make a commemorative trip for the railway's 60th anniversary. During the ascent, however, the locomotive's front axle broke and the locomotive began descending the mountain at high speed. All but one of its crew jumped to safety (though some suffered broken bones), but one man did not escape and died. The locomotive broke into pieces but the boiler did not rupture, and the pieces were later reassembled to reconstruct the locomotive for static display. It is now located at the <b>Cog</b> <b>Railway</b> Base Station.|$|E
25|$|Control by the Teagues {{began in}} 1931 when Col. Henry N. Teague bought the Cog. He died in 1951, and Arthur S. Teague became general manager, then gained {{ownership}} in 1961. (Arthur Teague was the colonel's protégé but no relation.) After {{he died in}} 1967, the ownership passed to his wife Ellen Crawford Teague who ran the Cog as the world's first woman president of a railway. In 1983, Mrs. Teague sold the railway {{to a group of}} New Hampshire businessmen. Since 1986, the <b>Cog</b> <b>Railway</b> has been controlled and owned by Wayne Presby and Joel Bedor of Littleton, New Hampshire. The Bedor and Presby families also owned the Mount Washington Hotel and Resort in Bretton Woods for the period 1991-2006. In 1995, the railway appointed Charles Kenison the General Manager. These individuals were responsible for a complete revitalization of the railroad, with the assistance of Al LaPrade, a mechanical engineer whose career began at the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard. The Cog has been in continuous operation since 1869, with service interruptions only during the World Wars.|$|E
500|$|Little {{occurred}} on the summit itself until the mid-19th century, when it was developed {{into one of the}} first tourist destinations in the nation, with construction of more bridle paths and two hotels. The Summit House opened in 1852, a [...] stone hotel anchored by four heavy chains over its roof. In 1853, the Tip-Top House was erected to compete. Rebuilt of wood with 91 rooms in 1872–1873, the Summit House burned in 1908, then was replaced in granite in 1915. The Tip-Top House alone survived the fire; today it is a state historic site, recently renovated for exhibits. Other Victorian era tourist attractions include a coach road (1861)—now the Mount Washington Auto Road—and the Mount Washington <b>Cog</b> <b>Railway</b> (1869), both of which are still in operation.|$|E

Some days later found them in Topeka, where they had decided to rest up for a day or two. During that time only one short telegram had come from Mr. Anderson Rover, stating that the Bruno bonds had been sold at a fair profit, but that the Lansing deal was still uncertain.|$|E
