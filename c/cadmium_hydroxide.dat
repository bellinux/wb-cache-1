40|$|This study {{demonstrates}} that the structure of <b>cadmium</b> <b>hydroxides</b> (Cd(OH) (2)) precipitated from a basic cadmium nitrate solution can be finely controlled by adjusting the pH of the precursor solution. The synthesis process involves only pouring the saturated solution into pure water to quench the pH and the total process is finished within 30 s. At a shallow pH quenching, the unstable nanoparticles turned into microparticles via a ripening process. Cd(OH) (2) was precipitated {{in the form of}} one-dimensional nanowires and then two-dimensional plates as the pH quenching was increased. At a large pH quenching, porous aggregates of Cd(OH) (2) were obtained due to the too fast precipitation. The ultrafine Cd(OH) (2) nanowires were readily transformed into CdSe chain-like nanocrystals. The transformation was quick and gave 100 % yield, facilitating massive production of CdSe nanocrystals in an aqueous condition.

Such analysis is important because ethanol reduces its fuel production efficiency by altering the alcoholic fermentation step when in excess. The custom-designed platform integrates gas diffusion separation with voltammetric detection in a single analysis module. The detector relied on a Ni(OH) 2 -modified electrode. It was stabilized by uniformly depositing cobalt and <b>cadmium</b> <b>hydroxides</b> as shown by XPS measurements. Such tests {{were in accordance with}} the hypothesis related to stabilization of the Ni(OH) 2 structure by insertion of Co(2 +) and Cd(2 +) ions in this structure. The separation step, in turn, was based on a hydrophobic PTFE membrane, which separates the sample from receptor solution (electrolyte) where the electrodes were placed. Parameters of limit of detection and analytical sensitivity were estimated to be 0. 2 % v/v and 2. 90 μA % (v/v) (- 1), respectively. Samples of fermentation broth were analyzed by both standard addition method and direct interpolation in saline medium based-analytical curve. In this case, the saline solution exhibited ionic strength {{similar to those of the}} samples intended to surpass the tonometry colligative effect of the samples over analyte concentration data by attributing the reduction in quantity of diffused ethanol vapor majorly to the electrolyte.

There {{is a need to}} explore new alternative approaches to provide toxicity information particularly on this technically demanding area. This research explores the potential of in vitro methods for toxicity assessment of workplace air contaminants. A tiered approach for in vitro toxicity testing of workplace contaminants was designed in which appropriate air sampling and exposure techniques were developed. A diversified battery of in vitro assays including the MTS (tetrazolium salt, Promega), NRU (neutral red uptake, Sigma) and ATP (adenosine triphosphate, Promega) and a multiple human cell system including: A 549 - lung derived cells; HepG 2 -liver derived cells, and skin fibroblasts were used. Primarily the application and merits of in vitro methods for prediction of toxicity of selected workplace contaminants including Ammonium <b>hydroxide,</b> <b>Cadmium</b> chloride, Cobalt chloride, Formaldehyde, Glutaraldehyde, Manganese chloride, Mercuric chloride, Sodium dichromate, Sulphureous acid and Zinc chloride was confirmed. To study the toxicity of airborne contaminants an indirect exposure method was established using air sampling techniques followed by static and dynamic direct exposure methods by culturing cells on porous membranes to reveal representative data relating to human airborne exposures. The static method enabled the measurement of an airborne IC 50 (50 % inhibitory concentration) value for selected volatile organic compounds (VOCs) including: Xylene (IC 50 = 5, 350 - 8, 200 ppm) and Toluene (IC 50 = 10, 500 - 16, 600 ppm) after 1 hr exposure. By implementing the dynamic method, airborne IC 50 values were calculated for gaseous contaminants including: NO 2 (IC 50 = 11 ± 3. 54 ppm; NRU), SO 2 (IC 50 = 48 ± 2. 83 ppm; ATP) and NH 3 (IC 50 = 199 ± 1. 41 ppm; MTS). A higher sensitivity of in vitro methods was observed compared to in vivo published data.

Battery charge capacities were measured at 0, 2 C discharge rate and average electrical power was measured at 0. 2 and 0. 8 C discharge rate. To perform chemical composition analysis, the batteries were vacuum dismantled and their electrodes were characterized by Energy Dispersive X-Ray Fluorescence (EDXRF) and X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) techniques.

30|$|CNTs are {{considered}} {{to be one of the}} most promising adsorbents for wastewater treatment because of their large adsorption capacity for synthetic dyes [15]. Multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) have been shown to surpass <b>cadmium</b> <b>hydroxide</b> nanowire-loaded AC (Cd(OH) 2 –NW–AC) with respect to their efficient removal of safranin O (SO) from wastewater [83]. However, only few studies were reported on the application of CNTs for dye removal from aqueous solution [41, 69, 76, 84, 85, 86]. Moreover, CNTs were typically used directly without further treatment [41, 69, 85]. Therefore, CNT functionalization has been initiated to introduce various functional groups that provide new adsorption sites [15]. Among such modifications, oxidation is an easy method for introducing hydroxyl and carbonyl groups to the sidewalls of CNTs. Oxidized MWCNTs were found to be effective in the removal of methylene red (MR) and methylene blue (MB) from aqueous solutions [87, 88]. Yao et al. [89] reported an adsorption capacity of 41.63  mg g− 1 at 333  K for the removal of MB onto CNTs. Shahryari et al.

This modification involves alterations to typical deposition parameters that eliminate the formation of <b>cadmium</b> <b>hydroxide</b> and keep cadmium ion molarity above 10 - 7 M. The new or atypical parameters developed are pH values below 8. 9 and lower moralities for all chemicals. In order to have complexation of cadmium ion driven mainly by ammonia, parameters that minimized complexation by other chemicals are found. Cadmium acetate concentration below 2 mM and ammonium acetate concentration below 10 mM minimize complexation. In order to keep cadmium ion molarity within the detection limits during complexation with ammonia, ammonia molarity is kept below 0. 05 M. For controlling proposes, decomposition of thiourea is studied with the parameter developed for monitoring of cadmium ion molarity. It is found that thiourea complexes cadmium ions, and it precipitates cadmium sulfide homogenously with cadmium ion molarities above 10 - 7 M and pH value of 8. 9. Thiourea decomposition is suppressed for pH values below 7. 6, and pH values of 8. 2 and 8. 4 are found to suppress homogenous precipitation and favor heterogeneous deposition of cadmium sulfide with a deposition rate between 1 to 2 nm per minute.

A model of this battery system is presented.

The model results are compared to experiments found in the literature. Fundamental analyses as well as engineering optimizations are performed from the results of the battery model.

This model allows for the theoretical examination of the effects of a diffusion coefficient that {{is a function of the}} state of charge of the active material. It is found using present data from the literature that diffusion in the solid phase is usually not an important limitation in the nickel oxide electrode. This finding is contrary to the conclusions reached by other authors. Although diffusion in the nickel oxide active material is treated rigorously with the pseudo 2 -D model, a general methodology is presented for determining the best constant diffusion coefficient to use in a standard one-dimensional battery model. The diffusion coefficients determined by this method are shown to be able to partially capture the behavior that results from a diffusion coefficient that varies with the state of charge of the active material...|$|E
