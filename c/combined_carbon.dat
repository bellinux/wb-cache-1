40|$|Results are {{presented}} {{on the development}} of reversible sorbents for the <b>combined</b> <b>carbon</b> dioxide and trace-contaminant (TC) removal for use in Extravehicular Activities (EVAs). Since ammonia is the most important TC to be captured, data on TC sorption presented in this paper are limited to ammonia, with results relevant to other TCs to be reported at a later time. The currently available life support systems use separate units for carbon dioxide, trace contaminants, and moisture control, and the long-term objective is to replace the above three modules with a single one. Furthermore, the current TC-control technology involves the use of a packed bed of acid-impregnated granular charcoal, which is non-regenerable, and the carbon-based sorbent under development in this project can be regenerated by exposure to vacuum at room temperature. The objective {{of this study was to}} demonstrate the feasibility of using carbon sorbents for the reversible, concurrent sorption of carbon dioxide and ammonia. Several carbon sorbents were fabricated and tested, and multiple adsorption/vacuum-regeneration cycles were demonstrated at room temperature, and also a carbon surface conditioning technique that enhances the <b>combined</b> <b>carbon</b> dioxide and ammonia sorption without impairing sorbent regeneration...|$|E

40|$|Recently, <b>combined</b> <b>carbon</b> and {{hydrogen}} isotope fractionation investigations {{have emerged as}} {{a powerful tool for}} the characterization of reaction mechanisms relevant for the removal of organic pollutants. Here, we applied this approach in order to differentiate benzene biodegradation pathways under oxic and anoxic conditions in laboratory experiments. Carbon {{and hydrogen}} isotope fractionation of benzene was studied with four different aerobic strains using a monooxygenase or a dioxygenase for the initial benzene attack, a facultative anaerobic chlorate-reducing strain as well as a sulfate-reducing mixed culture. Carbon and hydrogen enrichment factors (epsilon(C), epsilon(H)) varied for the specific pathways and degradation conditions, respectively, so that from the individual enrichment factors only limited information could be obtained for the identification of benzene biodegradation pathways. However, using the slope derived from hydrogen vs carbon isotope discriminations or the ratio of hydrogen to carbon enrichment factors (lambda = deltaH/ deltaC approximately epsilon(H) /epsilon(C)), benzene degradation mechanisms could be distinguished. Although experimentally determined lambda values partially overlapped, ranges could be determined for different benzene biodegradation pathways. Specific lambda values were 17 for anaerobic degradation. Moreover, variations in lambda values suggest that more than one reaction mechanism exists for monohydroxylation as well as for anaerobic benzene degradation under nitrate-reducing, sulfate-reducing, or methanogenic conditions. Our results show that the <b>combined</b> <b>carbon</b> and hydrogen isotope fractionation approach has potential to elucidate biodegradation pathways of pollutants in field and laboratory microcosm studie...|$|E
