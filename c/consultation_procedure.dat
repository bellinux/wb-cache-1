25|$|Under the Community, the European Parliament (formerly the European Parliamentary Assembly) had an {{advisory}} role to the Council and Commission. There {{were a number}} of Community legislative procedures, at first there was only the <b>consultation</b> <b>procedure,</b> which meant Parliament had to be consulted, although it was often ignored. The Single European Act gave Parliament more power, with the assent procedure giving it a right to veto proposals and the cooperation procedure giving it equal power with the Council if the Council was not unanimous.|$|E
25|$|Before the Single European Act the <b>Consultation</b> <b>procedure</b> was {{the most}} widely used {{legislative}} procedure in the then European Community. Consultation is still used for legislation concerning internal market exemptions and competition law. The procedure is also used in relation to the Union's advisory bodies such as the Committee of the Regions and the Economic and Social Committee that are required to be consulted under a range of areas under the treaties affecting their area of expertise. Such a procedure takes place in addition to consultation with the European Parliament or the other legislative procedures.|$|E

2500|$|In the few {{remaining}} areas, called [...] "special legislative procedures", Parliament now has either the right of consent to a Council of the EU measure, or vice versa, except in the few cases where the old <b>Consultation</b> <b>procedure</b> still applies, wherein the Council of the EU will only need to consult the European Parliament before voting on the Commission proposal.

2500|$|The {{planning}} {{procedures for}} the ten planning approval sections (including railway power lines) were initiated from December 1993.

40|$|There {{has been}} a long {{tradition}} of debate over workplace democracy in Australia. Yet, workplace democracy remains one of the great unfulfilled promises of Australian labour law. While the current focus on enterprise bargaining in the workplace might encourage us to think about new information and consultation mechanisms at work, there are no legislative provisions imminent. We argue that the voluntary approach of recent Australian governments has failed to create a generally available right to information and consultation at work. In this article we therefore consider how information and <b>consultation</b> <b>procedures</b> could be introduced into Australia, drawing upon the European social partnership model and the Australian experience with employee consultation mechanisms. In particular, the article assesses employee <b>consultation</b> <b>procedures</b> in light of good workplace relations practices. The article examines how the Workplace Relations Act could be amended to incorporate a new model, and assesses its likely effectiveness in the current Australian industrial relations context. 40 page(s...|$|R

In such cases, the <b>consultation</b> <b>procedure</b> also serves to identify political concerns that could later be the focus of a popular referendum to stop passage of the bill at issue.|$|E

50|$|The {{legislative}} procedure for {{adoption of a}} decision varies depending on its subject matter. The ordinary {{legislative procedure}} (formerly known as the Codecision procedure) requires agreement of and allows amendments by both the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union. The Assent procedure requires agreement of both Parliament and Council, but the Parliament can only agree or disagree to the text as a whole - it cannot propose amendments. The <b>Consultation</b> <b>procedure</b> requires agreement of the Council alone, the Parliament merely being consulted on the text.

50|$|European Movement Germany is a not-for-profit, {{registered}} organisation which is recognised {{and supported by}} the Department of Foreign Affairs and by the federal budget at institutional level. It is therefore not a non-governmental organisation in the narrow sense. Although its legal status and institutional relationship to the Foreign Office is similar to the Goethe Institute, EM Germany has not come to a framework agreement with the Foreign Office. It works closely with the European Division of the Foreign Office as regards content and organisation. In accordance with the European Division, certain concepts of European communication and policy-planning were adopted. Within this framework EM Germany provides information sessions on European topics to its member organisations. Topics range from discussions of the Commission’s <b>consultation</b> <b>procedure</b> to information events on the decisions of the European Council.|$|E
5000|$|The term arose {{following}} {{the closure of}} Renault's factory in 1997. Due to the controversial nature of the closure the Belgian government empowered the Conseil National du Travail/Nationale Arbeidsraad (CNT/NAR) {{to report on the}} <b>consultation</b> <b>procedure.</b> Subsequently, on the recommendation of the CNT a law, known as the loi Renault ('Renault law') was passed on 13 Feb 1998. The law added additional requirements in addition to two existing laws of 1975/6 on necessary procedures when a company makes collective redundancies. The law required the company to inform and consult the workers on such redundancies, with reference to the rational for the redundancies, and the selection criteria for those made redundant. Additionally the employer was required to listen to and respond to all of the employees' questions on the redundancies.|$|E
