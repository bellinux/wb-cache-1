40|$|One of {{the goals}} of the European Commission in the energy sector is {{creating}} a single competitive European market. The decision of the European Union to liberalise energy markets has far-reaching consequences not only for gas companies, but also {{for the rest of the}} real economy in view of the fact that natural gas is being used as a primary energy source. In this paper we aim to answer how liberalisation has influenced gas pricing/prices in the Czech Republic and whether the liberalisation goals regarding prices have been fulfilled. Are they still coupled with light and heavy fuel oil and how, or are they decoupled and driven by the supply-demand relationship? Have they decreased? We investigate the individual components of end-customer gas prices according to the value-chain and we define and structure the drivers of these components. We pay extra attention to oil-linked pricing in long-term contracts and the consequences of market liberalisation/unbundling. We provide the reader with a case study from the Czech Republic, one of the Central and Eastern European countries, which, contrary to the old Member States, is buying most of its gas from one supplier (high import dependence, low supply diversity) and where the transmission and distribution network is characterised by a sufficient <b>contractual</b> and physical <b>capacity.</b> We stress that next to basic conditions on the European gas market (import dependency on external gas producers) individual legal and institutional conditions and the initial market structure of each Member State are also important for the results of the liberalisation process...|$|R
40|$|Market {{power is}} the ability of a market {{participant}} to alter the market price of a good or service without losing customers to competition. The participant's price is profitably maintained above a competitive level for a significant period of time. In ideal competitive markets, one would need to lower prices to garner more market share. In uncompetitive markets, participants who know their product is absolutely needed or not substitutable, can profitably raise prices to high levels [i]. In electric energy markets, there are many contributing factors determining competitiveness including market share, market concentration, elasticity of demand, excess <b>capacity,</b> <b>contractual</b> arrangements, price establishment processes and ease of market entry [ii]. The market participants in electric energy markets are the generators supplying electricity. Here the suppliers possessing market power potential can increase revenue without affecting the revenue and electric dispatch of other generators. When a centrally-dispatched electricity market is competitive, economic operation of the grid is transparent and efficient. However when a supplier possess an advantage over others, the benefits of a competitive electricity market may be jeopardized [ix]. Market power problems are complicated in electric markets due to specific properties of electricity and transmission grids [iii]. High concentrations of intensive power use can constrain transmission systems, and the ability of some loads to be served by generators located at remote distances would be limited. The areas where insufficient transmission capacity cannot reliably supply 100 % of the electric load, without relying on generation physically located nearby, are termed "load pockets". Substitutability for the commodity is not readily available in these load pockets. Other sources of inefficiency are limited generation capacity of suppliers and a lack of sufficient energy storage. Generators that can capitalize on transmission deficiencies can iii increase price while maintaining their amount of energy sold. The constraints on the transmission grid allow one or more suppliers to exploit locational advantages to their benefit {{at the expense of the}} end user. There exist many tools widely used for identifying market power potential. Most rely on direct application of concentration measures, such as Residual Supplier Indices and the Hirschmann-Herfindahl Index, which show a single supplier or small number of suppliers dominating the market. These concentration measures are valuable but often fail to capture the true degree of competition [ix]. Concentration measures do not consider price-responsiveness or elasticity of demand, and a detailed representation of the electric grid may not be included. In electric energy markets various network operating limits often present market participants an uncompetitive advantage in small segments of the network, referred to as "local market power. " Concentration measures may fail to identify these market participants exhibiting local geographic advantage when assessing the network as an aggregate [iv]. Distribution factors related to sensitivity of constrained lines and supplier dispatch are used in a PJM three pivotal supplier test that is said to be more accurate than concentration measures [v]. Here each constraint is examined individually to determine whether three suppliers are jointly pivotal in relieving the constraint. A similar approach will be taken in the algorithm of this paper, but will differ in that the simultaneous combined effect of all line constraints will be considered instead of evaluating one at a time. This new work is significant because the presence of multiple line constraints could further provoke market power potential, and these locational advantages may be less evident in the analysis of a lone constraint. The goal of this paper is to outline an algorithmic routine that exploits sensitivity analyses of coupled economic and physical models. Load demand is assumed to be inelastic, iv and only the effect of offer price on the market is studied. Limits are placed on transmission lines known to be easily congested, and a linear programming optimal flow is run. Matrices of dispatch/offer price and revenue/offer price sensitivities are then calculated for further evaluation which will highlight suppliers able to manipulate the market to their advantage. This analysis does not necessarily conclude certain generators are exercising market power or to what extent this potential may be exercised. It serves as a screening tool so that dominant suppliers flagged can be investigated for the possibility of market power potential. The impact of this work will improve the efficiency and reliability of the electric power grid...|$|R

40|$|We {{consider}} a contract manufacturer that serves {{a limited number}} of outsourcers (customers) on a single capacitated production line. The outsourcers have different levels of demand uncertainty and the contract manufacturer faces the question how to allocate the <b>contractual</b> <b>capacity</b> flexibility in an optimal way. The <b>contractual</b> <b>capacity</b> flexibility is a contract parameter that sets the amount of demand the contract manufacturer is obliged to accept from the outsourcers. We develop a hierarchical model that consists of two decision levels. At the tactical level, the contract manufacturer allocates the capacity flexibility to the different outsourcers by maximizing the expected profit. Offering more flexibility to the more uncertain outsourcer generates higher expected revenue, but also increases the expected penalty costs. The allocated capacity flexibilities (determined at the tactical level) are input parameters to the lower decision level, where the operational planning decisions are made and actual demands are observed. We perform a numerical study by solving the two-level hierarchical planning problem iteratively. We first solve the higher level problem, which has been formulated as an integer program, and then perform a simulation study, where we solve a mathematical programming model in a rolling horizon setting to measure the operational performance of the system. The simulation results reveal that when the acceptance decision is made (given the allocated capacity flexibility decision), priority is given to the less uncertain outsourcer, whereas when the orders are placed, priority is given to the most uncertain outsourcer. Our insights are helpful for contract manufacturers when having contract negotiations with the outsourcers. Moreover, we show that hierarchical integration and anticipation are required, especially for cases with high penalty cost and tight capacities.

40|$|This mini-dissertation {{explores the}} South African law of {{contract}} as influenced by the National Credit Act 34 of 2005. The National Credit Act has brought about {{a new era of}} consumer credit regulation and practice, which has introduced comprehensive changes to the consumer credit industry, as well as the {{law of contract}}. The Act provides for applied law of contract, in that, it only applies to credit agreements. A contractual agreement will only be legally binding upon the parties if all the contractual requirements are complied with, which requirements include consensus, <b>contractual</b> <b>capacity,</b> certainty, possibility, legality and formalities. This study illustrates specific provisions of the National Credit Act which have an influence or impact on the general principles of contract. This was done by considering specific provisions of the Act and by having regard to relevant case law. Aspects that inter alia fell outside the scope of this dissertation were the influence of the National Credit Act on the general principles of certainty and possibility.

40|$|In the 1960 s and 1970 s, American society {{came to the}} {{considered}} {{conclusion that}} if eighteen-year-olds can be drafted to fight and possibly die for their country, they {{should be treated as}} adults under the law. Thus, in 1971, the Twenty-Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution, which lowered the voting age to eighteen from twenty one, was proposed and ratified in just three months, making it the fastest amendment in American history. The minimum age for federal and state jury service was also lowered to eighteen from twenty one. And, with regard to contract law, every state passed legislation reducing the age of <b>contractual</b> <b>capacity</b> to eighteen. These changes overrode the centuries-old common law rule that one becomes an adult, {{in the eyes of the}} law, at age twenty-one, this being premised on the then-relevant custom that Englishmen became eligible for knighthood at that age. Despite the fact that all of these reforms remain in place, the federal “Credit CARD Act of 2009 ” established twenty-one as the minimum age to contract for a credit card. This Article criticizes this “infancy rule” of the CARD Act, found in section 301, in two ways. First, in the late twentieth century, we decided that eighteen-year-olds really are adults that deserve to be treated with dignity by the law, and this view has not changed. This basic principle was the driving force behind the Twenty-Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution, which in 1971 lowered the minimum age to vote to eighteen, as well as state and federal statutes that lowered the age to serve on a jury to eighteen, not to mention the state statutes lowering the age of <b>contractual</b> <b>capacity</b> to eighteen. In declaring all those under twenty one to be infants, section 301 runs badly afoul of this broad societal consensus, rolls back the clock to medieval times, and undermines the dignity of eighteen-year-olds. Second, separate and apart from the harm section 301 directly inflicts on young people, the CARD Act’s infancy rule hurts society at large. This is because the state statutory reforms of the 1970 s that endowed eighteen-year-olds with the capacity to enter into binding contracts ushered in the new and hugely beneficial phenomenon of youthful entrepreneurship. Young people, aged eighteen to twenty, were now able to obtain credit and found start-up companies, such as Bill Gates, who founded Microsoft at age nineteen, and Mark Zuckerberg, who founded Facebook at the same age. These and other youthful start-ups employ hundreds of thousands of people, and their products and services improve our lives. Under section 301 of the CARD Act, however, they likely never would have been launched. In short, by hampering youthful entrepreneurship, section 301 harms not only the youths themselves, but society as a whole...|$|E
40|$|According to the {{existing}} regulation, the consent to participate in medical research can be given only by {{a person who has}} the capacity to provide it. As this capacity is not explained in further detail, the author of this paper is interested in determining what it includes and which persons generally have this capacity. The answer to these questions is pursued through a comparative analysis of the legal solutions contained in international regulations as well as in some national regulations on medical research involving human subjects. In {{the first part of this}} paper, the author compares the capacity to give informed consent and the <b>contractual</b> <b>capacity.</b> On the basis of this comparative analysis, the author concludes that there are certain differences between the two as the capacity to give informed consent is generally equaled with the capacity to exercise reasonable judgment. In the second part of this paper, the author asserts that the reasons of legal certainty have imposed the need to associate the capacity to give informed consent with a certain age, which has been accepted in national legislations (by prescribing either the age of maturity or a younger age). In the final part of this paper, the author concludes that linking this capacity to a certain age leads to the following circumstances: the persons under the prescribed age are considered incapable of giving informed consent even though they are capable of exercising reasonable judgment; the persons above the prescribed age are assumed to be capable of giving consent, unless they are physically or mentally incapacitated, which is determined which is determined in the process of obtaining an informed consent for medical research when the researcher accesses the person's capacity to exercise reasonable judgment...|$|E
40|$|Text in AfrikaansThe study investigates {{legal and}} {{administrative}} {{aspects of the}} interaction between public sector and private enterprise effected by state procurement of goods and services. South African government contracts are, despite their elaborate regulation by statutory and administrative prescription, regarded as {{the subject matter of the}} private law of contract. In this regard, they may be distinguished from the contrats administratif of the French and related legal systems and resemble their British and, more closely, federal American counterparts. Important aspects of government procurement, notably the <b>contractual</b> <b>capacity</b> of organs of the state, those administrative procedures which precede the conclusion of agreements with contractors, and the right reserved to the state to rescind, in the public interest, a contract duly entered into, are nevertheless to be determined by the principles of administrative law. The budgeting, audit and parliamentary control of procurement expenditure, along with the invitation of suppliers' bids and the award of contracts, are the principal administrative aspects of the study and are analysed in Chapters III and IV. The pricing of government contracts in South Africa is, with scant exception, determined by competitive tender. Restrictive trade practices and bid preferences awarded by procuring agencies in the pursuit of socio-economic policies were found, in Chapter V, to impede the operation of free market forces. The law of contract features most prominently in the performance of contracts and is examined in Chapter VI. The discussion, depicting the essential provisions of six standard form contracts commonly employed by government for stores and works, is fairly concise. References to British and American procurement law and practice, a consistent feature of the study, are, however, extensive. In South Africa, the settlement of procurement disputes is generally entrusted to the ordillary courts. Chapter VII deals with a number of special remedies accorded to the state, procedural prerequisites for the institution of civil actions against the state, and alternatives to litigation, especially arbitration and administrative appeal. The final chapters survey the efficacy of procurement as an instrument of socio-economic policy, and advance a few recommendations regarding the proper law and more efficient administration of government procurement.

40|$|Studies {{have shown}} that BBBEE parties are {{unsuccessful}} in raising banking finance due {{to a number of}} reasons. The objective of the enactment of the Broad Based Black Economic Empowerment (BBBEE) Act is primarily to promote the participation of black people in the economy. The measurement of BBBEE is determined by the codes of good practice for Qualifying Small Enterprises (QSE), which consists of seven elements namely: ownership, management control, employment equity, skills development, preferential procurement, enterprise development and socio-economic development. Enterprises with annual turnover ranging from R 5 million and R 35 million qualify as QSE. These elements measure the level of BBBEE status. The enactment of the National Credit Act replaced the Usury Act, 1968 and the Credit Agreements Act, 1980. The objective of the act is to promote accessibility to the credit market and to prevent the over-indebtedness of consumers. The Act is applicable to natural persons with <b>contractual</b> <b>capacity</b> and juristic persons with monetary assets or annual turnover of less than R 1 million. This study aims to establish the facilitation of access to banking finance for BBBEE SME’S within the George and Mossel Bay area as these towns form part of the Garden Route Business Banking Division of Nedbank. The effect of the BBBEE and NCA on the accessing of banking finance was studied and analysed. Credit applications are subject to stringent credit scoring systems to rate applicants, monitor performance and manage accounts. The Basel rating which measures the minimum level of capital a bank should hold to protect investors determines the interest rate charged for loans. These ratings affect the accessibility of banking finance.

40|$|Although {{contemporary}} {{criminal law}} accepts {{the system of}} subjective criminal liability for a committed crime, numerous European legal documents as well as criminal laws, especially {{those that have been}} adopted lately, envisage exceptions from this system. Thus, a new form of criminal liability is being introduced: objective liability based on the causation. One of the forms of objective liability is the criminal liability of legal entities, which has been considered disputable for a long time. Obviously, legal entities cannot be held accountable for all types of criminal offences. They cannot be held liable on the grounds of legal provisions regarding mental competence and culpability (as the elements of subjective criminal liability), nor can they be imposed all types of criminal sanctions recognized in criminal legislation in general. In their new or revised criminal legislation, many countries have recognized and inagurated the objective criminal liability of legal persons for committed criminal offences alongside with the predominant system of subjective liability (based on the perpetrator's mental competence and culpability). It is indisputable that some legal entities (such as state authorities) cannot be prosecuted and held liable in criminal proceedings; consequently, there are some exemptions from criminal liability (particularly {{when it comes to the}} state and state bodies), but it does not exclude criminal liability of responsible officials (natural persons) for causing the consequences of a criminal offence. Due to the specific character of legal and <b>contractual</b> <b>capacity</b> of legal entities, law in general and criminal legislations in particular prescribe special legal grounds for establishing criminal liability of legal entities, which differ from the subjective liability of a natural person (perceived as a conscious and reasonable human being acting on his/her own free will) where the consequence of a criminal offence is a result of one's own conduct embodied either in the commission of a criminal offence or in the omission to act. Therefore, contemporary criminal laws have determined special types of criminal sanctions, such as: punishment, security measures, conditional (suspended) sentence and confiscation of material gain obtained by comitting the criminal offence, as well as the instruments, proceedings and conditions under which they may be imposed. Within the framework of the forthcoming reform of the entire penal legislation in the Republic of Serbia, the Serbian legislator may use the legal solutions envisaged in the analyzed documents and criminal legislations as a solid model for implementing the international standards in the field of criminal liability of legal entities. Hence, this paper discusses the particularities governing the application of criminal sanctions for legal entities in the Republic of Serbia, particularly as an instrument of crime control...|$|E
40|$|In {{the last}} few decades, mental {{disorders}} resulting from substance abuse have become a frequent phenomenon, which features diverse forms and degrees of severity. In {{addition to being a}} medical and extremely harmful social phenomenon, substance abuse (commonly known as drug or narcotics abuse) is frequently a subject matter of research in many sciences or scientific disciplines, such as medicine, psychology, sociology, legal science, etc. Drug abusers may develop diverse mental disorders, which largely depends on the type of psychoactive substance which is being abused and the method of taking narcotics (including frequency, daily dose, mode of administration, etc.). In this paper, the author provides an overview of different types of mental disorders according to the applicable International Classification of Mental and Behavioral Disorders. The disturbance of mental functions due to drug abuse (which may or may not result {{in the development of a}} mental disorder) changes the perception and behaviour of drug users. The disturbance of mental functions becomes particularly prominent in the circumstances where substance abuse has turned into a drug addiction; the basic characteristic of the dependence syndrome is an irresistible urge (craving or even compulsion) to take the substance in order to enjoy its effects again or to avoid/relieve the drug addiction crisis or the abstinence syndrome, which may be extremely painful and agonizing. As a consequence of these mental disturbances and other disorders arising from drug addiction, human behaviour may be disrupted to such an extent that a person may demonstrate some criminal conduct, which ultimately makes these mental disorders highly relevant in the field of criminal law. Given the fact that the criminal offender is a drug abuser who may have different forms of mental disorders, there is a need to consider the offender's mental capacity (sanity), which ultimately makes these mental disorders highly relevant from the point of view of forensic psychiatry. The author's primary goal in this paper is to present the basic postulates underlying the perception of drug abuse and drug addiction in forensic psychiatry, both from the theoretical and practical point of view. In exploring the practical aspect of this issue, the author focuses on presenting the basic principles of forensic-psychiatric expertise of criminal offenders who have been diagnosed as having mental disorders caused by drug abuse. The expertise includes different aspects of assessing mental disorders: giving professional opinions on the offender's mental capacity (sanity), assessing the potential danger of recidivism or commission of a more serious criminal act, and giving proposals for relevant of security measures concerning the mandatory treatment of drug addicts both in outpatient clinics and in other relevant in-patient medical institutions. Given the fact that mental disorders stemming from drug abuse frequently have numerous financial, family and professional implications, the author presents some forensic psychiatric attitudes pertaining to the assessment of <b>contractual</b> <b>capacity</b> of these persons, the assessment of their working capacity (including the remaining working ability or temporary inability to work), the assessment of mental capacity for exercising the parental right or custodianship rights. In that context, the author provides the forensic psychiatric aspects of these mental disorders from the aspect of civil law. Drug abuse and drug addiction involve serious and complex socio-pathological problems which are difficult to treat/cure. This paper is the author's contribution to casting light on these issues, primarily from the aspect of forensic psychiatry...|$|E
