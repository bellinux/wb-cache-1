50|$|Between 1605 and 1635 over 100,000 {{paintings}} were produced in Haarlem. Not {{all of these}} have survived, and most have left town, but this does {{say something about the}} artistic climate in the city. At that time art ownership in the city was 25%, a record high. More art has survived up to today from that period in Haarlem than from any other Dutch city, thanks mostly to the Schilder-boeck published by Karel van Mander there in 1604. The former curator Pieter Biesboer has created inventories of Haarlem art and worked on several <b>catalogues</b> <b>for</b> the <b>museum,</b> mostly based on the works created before 1800.|$|R

5000|$|<b>Catalogues</b> <b>for</b> art or <b>museum</b> {{exhibitions}} may {{range in}} scale {{from a single}} printed sheet to a lavish hardcover [...] "coffee table book". The advent of cheap colour-printing in the 1960s transformed what had usually been simple [...] "handlists" [...] with several works to each page into large scale [...] "descriptive catalogues" [...] that are intended as both contributions to scholarship and books likely to appeal to many general readers. The <b>catalogues</b> <b>for</b> exhibitions held at a museum are now often far more detailed than the catalogues of their permanent collections. [...] In the early 21st century, exhibitions that gather items from other institutions (museums, galleries, libraries, etc.) and that are elaborately publicized very often have catalogues {{in the form of}} substantial books.|$|R
50|$|Immediately {{after graduating}} in 1893, Binyon started {{working for the}} Department of Printed Books of the British <b>Museum,</b> writing <b>catalogues</b> <b>for</b> the <b>museum</b> and art monographs for himself. In 1895 his first book, Dutch Etchers of the Seventeenth Century, was published. In that same year, Binyon moved into the Museum's Department of Prints and Drawings, under Campbell Dodgson. In 1909, Binyon became its Assistant Keeper, and in 1913 he was made the Keeper of the new Sub-Department of Oriental Prints and Drawings. Around this time he {{played a crucial role}} in the {{formation}} of Modernism in London by introducing young Imagist poets such as Ezra Pound, Richard Aldington and H.D. to East Asian visual art and literature. Many of Binyon's books produced while at the Museum were influenced by his own sensibilities as a poet, although some are works of plain scholarship - such as his four-volume catalogue of all the Museum's English drawings, and his seminal catalogue of Chinese and Japanese prints.|$|R

Still others reference the printed page as a “body. ” Whether fish, fowl, or human, the body as seen in these prints continues to intrigue us across the centuries and show that even though times change, people and their concerns do not.

5000|$|However, Thelma Golden {{claimed to}} have coined the term ‘post-black’ art with friend and artist Glenn Ligon in the late 1990s. In 2001 the phrase was {{explained}} in detail in the exhibition <b>catalogue</b> <b>for</b> The Studio <b>Museum</b> in Harlem’s exhibition entitled [...] "Freestyle." [...] Freestyle was an exhibition that included twenty-eight up and coming artists of African American backgrounds. Golden defined post-black art as that which includes artists who are “adamant about not being labeled ‘black’ artists, though their work was steeped, in fact deeply interested, in redefining complex notions of blackness.” [...] She continued, “They are both post-Basquiat and post-Biggie. They embrace the dichotomies of high and low, inside and outside, tradition and innovation, with a great ease and facility.” Laura Meyers interprets this as “cutting edge works that are defined by not being defined as African American art.” Golden stated her initial interest {{as an attempt to}} remove some of the negative associations with the phrase black art as well as comment on the diversity of artists of African descent. [...] In the exhibition catalogue, Golden proclaims, “Post-black was the new black.” ...|$|R
