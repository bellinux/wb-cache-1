We investigated the effects of platinum plating of electrode, electrode size, cell potential, and additional stirring on electrolysis properties of deep ocean water (DOW) and DOW concentration products. We also studied the relationships between quality properties of electrolyzed DOW and their storage stability. Results indicated that concentrating DOW to 1. 7 times increased chlorine level in the electrolyzed DOW without affecting electric and <b>current</b> <b>efficiencies</b> of the electrolysis process. Increasing magnesium and potassium levels in DOW decreased chlorine level in the electrolyzed DOW as well as electric and <b>current</b> <b>efficiencies</b> of the electrolysis process. Additional stirring could not increase electrolysis efficiency of small electrolyzer. Large electrode, high electric potential and/or small electrolyzing cell increased chlorine production rate but decreased electric and <b>current</b> <b>efficiencies.</b> High electrolysis intensity decreased storage stability of the electrolyzed seawater {{and the effects of}} electrolysis on DOW gradually subsided in storage. DOW has similar electrolysis properties to surface seawater, but its purity and stability are better.

40|$|Owing to its {{potential}} capability of generating localized non-inductive current, especially off-axis, Electron Cyclotron Current Drive (ECCD) {{is considered a}} leading candidate for current profile control in achieving Advanced Tokamak (AT) operation.

40|$|During Phase I of {{the present}} program, Alcoa {{developed}} a commercial cell concept that has been estimated to save 30 % of the energy required for aluminum smelting. Phase ii involved {{the construction of a}} pilot facility and operation of two pilots. Phase iii of the Advanced Anodes and Cathodes Program was aimed at bench experiments to permit the resolution of certain questions to be followed by three pilot cells. All of the milestones related to materials, in particular metal purity, were attained with distinct improvements over work in previous phases of the program. NiO additions to the ceramic phase and Ag additions to the Cu metal phase of the cermet improved corrosion resistance sufficiently that the bench scale pencil anodes met the purity milestones. Some excellent metal purity results have been obtained with anodes of the following composition: Further improvements in anode material composition appear to be dependent on a better understanding of oxide solubilities in molten cryolite. For that reason, work was commissioned with an outside consultant to model the MeO - cryolite systems. That work has led {{to a better understanding of}} which oxides can be used to substitute into the NiO-Fe 2 O 3 ceramic phase to stabilize the ferrites and reduce their solubility in molten cryolite. An extensive number of vertical plate bench electrolysis cells were run to try to find conditions where high <b>current</b> <b>efficiencies</b> could be attained. TiB 2 -G plates were very inconsistent and led to poor wetting and drainage. Pure TiB 2 did produce good <b>current</b> <b>efficiencies</b> at small overlaps (shadowing) between the anodes and cathodes. This bench work with vertical plate anodes and cathodes reinforced the importance of good cathode wetting to attain high <b>current</b> <b>efficiencies.</b> Because of those conclusions, new wetting work was commissioned and became a major component of the research during the third year of Phase III. While significant progress was made in several areas, much work needs to be done. The anode composition needs further improvements to attain commercial purity targets. At the present corrosion rate, the vertical plate anodes will wear too rapidly leading to a rapidly increasing anode-cathode gap and thermal instabilities in the cell. Cathode wetting as a function of both cathode plate composition and bath composition needs to be better understood to ensure that complete drainage of the molten aluminum off the plates occurs.
