5|$|During evolution, some {{structures}} {{may lose}} their original function and become vestigial structures. Such structures {{may have little}} or no function in a current species, yet have a clear function in ancestral species, or other closely related species. Examples include pseudogenes, the non-functional remains of eyes in blind cave-dwelling fish, wings in flightless birds, the presence of hip bones in whales and snakes, and sexual traits in organisms that reproduce via asexual reproduction. Examples of vestigial structures in humans include wisdom teeth, the <b>coccyx,</b> the vermiform appendix, and other behavioural vestiges such as goose bumps and primitive reflexes.|$|E
5|$|A {{cheerleader}} at school, Lawrence {{also played}} softball, field hockey and basketball, which she {{played on a}} boys team that her father coached. She was fond of horseback riding while growing up and frequently visited a local horse farm. She has a damaged <b>coccyx</b> from being thrown off a horse. The actress has said that {{she knew she would}} be famous from an early age. When her father worked from home, she performed for him, often dressing up as a clown or ballerina. Her first acting assignment was at the age of nine with the role of a prostitute in a church play based on the Book of Jonah. For the next few years, she continued to take parts in church plays and school musicals.|$|E
25|$|Pain at the <b>coccyx</b> (tailbone) {{is known}} as coccydynia.|$|E
25|$|Sacrum and Coccyx: In the US, if both {{bones are}} to be {{examined}} separate cephalad and caudad AP axial projections are obtained for the sacrum and <b>coccyx</b> respectively {{as well as a}} single Lateral of both bones.|$|E
25|$|In humans {{vertebral}} column there are normally thirty-three vertebrae; the upper twenty-four are articulating and separated {{from each other}} by intervertebral discs, and the lower nine are fused in adults, five in the sacrum and four in the <b>coccyx</b> or tailbone.|$|E
25|$|The pelvic {{region of}} the trunk {{includes}} the bony pelvis, the pelvic cavity (the space enclosed by the bony pelvis), the pelvic floor, below the pelvic cavity, and the perineum, below the pelvic floor. The pelvic skeleton is formed {{in the area of}} the back, by the sacrum and the <b>coccyx</b> and anteriorly and to the left and right sides, by a pair of hip bones.|$|E
25|$|When {{viewed from}} in front, {{the width of}} the bodies of the {{vertebrae}} is seen to increase from the second cervical to the first thoracic; there is then a slight diminution in the next three vertebrae; below this there is again a gradual and progressive increase in width as low as the sacrovertebral angle. From this point there is a rapid diminution, to the apex of the <b>coccyx.</b>|$|E
25|$|External {{pressure}} applied over {{an area of}} the body, especially {{over the}} bony prominences can result in obstruction of the blood capillaries, which deprives tissues of oxygen and nutrients, causing ischemia(deficiency of blood in a particular area), hypoxia(inadequate amount of oxygen available to the cells), edema, inflammation, and, finally, necrosis and ulcer formation. Ulcers due to external pressure occur over the sacrum and <b>coccyx,</b> followed by the trochanter and the calcaneus(heel).|$|E
25|$|In primates, {{the pelvis}} {{consists}} of four parts - {{the left and the}} right hip bones which meet in the mid-line ventrally and are fixed to the sacrum dorsally and the <b>coccyx.</b> Each hip bone consists of three components, the ilium, the ischium, and the pubis, and at the time of sexual maturity these bones become fused together, though there is never any movement between them. In humans, the ventral joint of the pubic bones is closed.|$|E
25|$|Pressure ulcers, {{also known}} as {{pressure}} sores, bedsores and decubitus ulcers, are localized damage to the skin and/or underlying tissue that usually occur over a bony prominence {{as a result of}} pressure, or pressure in combination with shear and/or friction. The most common sites are the skin overlying the sacrum, <b>coccyx,</b> heels or the hips, but other sites such as the elbows, knees, ankles, back of shoulders, or the back of the cranium can be affected.|$|E
25|$|During World War II, Gleason was {{initially}} exempt from military service, {{since he was}} a father of two. However, in 1943 the US started drafting men with children. Gleason reported to his induction where the doctors discovered that his broken left arm had healed crooked, the area between his thumb and forefinger was nerveless and numb, a pilonidal cyst existed {{at the end of his}} <b>coccyx,</b> and that he was 100 pounds overweight. Gleason was therefore classified 4-F, and rejected for military service.|$|E
25|$|The {{following}} locations have no discs and {{are therefore}} exempt from the risk of disc herniation: the upper two cervical intervertebral spaces, the sacrum, and the <b>coccyx.</b> Most disc herniations occur {{when a person is}} in their thirties or forties when the nucleus pulposus is still a gelatin-like substance. With age the nucleus pulposus changes ("dries out") and the risk of herniation is greatly reduced. After age 50 or 60, osteoarthritic degeneration (spondylosis) or spinal stenosis are more likely causes of low back pain or leg pain.|$|E
25|$|There {{are seven}} {{cervical}} vertebrae, twelve thoracic vertebrae and five lumbar vertebrae. The number of vertebrae {{in a region}} can vary but overall the number remains the same. The number {{of those in the}} cervical region however is only rarely changed. The vertebrae of the cervical, thoracic and lumbar spines are independent bones, and generally quite similar. The vertebrae of the sacrum and <b>coccyx</b> are usually fused and unable to move independently. Two special vertebrae are the atlas and axis, on which the head rests.|$|E
25|$|The pelvic {{region of}} the trunk is {{the lower part of}} the trunk, between the abdomen and the thighs. It {{includes}} several structures: the bony pelvis, the pelvic cavity, the pelvic floor, and the perineum. The bony pelvis (pelvic skeleton) is the part of the skeleton embedded in the pelvic {{region of the}} trunk. It is subdivided into the pelvic girdle and the pelvic spine. The pelvic girdle is composed of the appendicular hip bones (ilium, ischium, and pubis) oriented in a ring, and connects the pelvic region of the spine to the lower limbs. The pelvic spine consists of the sacrum and <b>coccyx.</b>|$|E
25|$|He {{made his}} {{debut in the}} top makuuchi {{division}} in July 1984, and in the following tournament in September he defeated two yokozuna, Chiyonofuji and Takanosato, and was runner-up with a 12–3 record. He was promoted to komusubi {{for the first time}} in May 1985 and sekiwake in July 1985. However, he suffered an injury to his <b>coccyx</b> (caused by a stool collapsing underneath him) and had to sit out all the next tournament. In May 1986 he suffered another injury, this time in competition, during a bout with Futahaguro. Konishiki came back strongly from this setback and three consecutive double figure scores in 1987 earned him promotion to ōzeki.|$|E
25|$|A typical {{vertebra}} {{consists of}} two parts: the vertebral body and the vertebral arch. The vertebral arch is posterior, meaning it faces {{the back of a}} person. Together, these enclose the vertebral foramen, which contains the spinal cord. Because the spinal cord ends in the lumbar spine, and the sacrum and <b>coccyx</b> are fused, they do not contain a central foramen. The vertebral arch is formed by a pair of pedicles and a pair of laminae, and supports seven processes, four articular, two transverse, and one spinous, the latter also being known as the neural spine. Two transverse processes and one spinous process are posterior to (behind) the vertebral body. The spinous process comes out the back, one transverse process comes out the left, and one on the right. The spinous processes of the cervical and lumbar regions can be felt through the skin.|$|E
25|$|Friedkin went to some {{extraordinary}} lengths, {{reminiscent of}} some directors {{from the old}} Hollywood directing style, manipulating the actors, to get the genuine reactions he wanted. Yanked violently around in harnesses, both Blair and Burstyn suffered back injuries and their painful screams went right into the film. Burstyn injured her back after landing on her <b>coccyx</b> when a stuntman jerked her around using a special effects cable during the scene when Regan slaps her mother. According to the documentary Fear of God: The Making of the Exorcist, however, the injury did not cause permanent damage, although Burstyn was upset the shot of her screaming in pain {{was used in the}} film. After asking Father William O'Malley if he trusted him and being told yes, Friedkin slapped him hard across the face before a take to generate a deeply solemn reaction that was used in the film as a very emotional Father Dyer read last rites to Father Karras; this offended the many Catholic crew members on the set. He also fired blanks without warning on the set to elicit shock from Jason Miller for one of the takes, and only told Miller that pea soup would hit him in the chest rather than the face concerning the projectile-vomiting scene, resulting in his disgusted reaction. Lastly, he had Regan's bedroom set built inside a freezer so that the actors' breath could be visible on camera, which required the crew to wear parkas and other cold-weather gear.|$|E
25|$|The {{posterior}} dorsal hip {{muscles are}} inserted on or directly below the greater trochanter of the femur. The tensor fasciae latae, {{stretching from the}} anterior superior iliac spine down into the iliotibial tract, presses {{the head of the}} femur into the acetabulum but also flexes, rotates medially, and abducts to hip joint. The piriformis originates on the anterior pelvic surface of the sacrum, passes through the greater sciatic foramen, and inserts on the posterior aspect of the tip of the greater trochanter. In a standing posture it is a lateral rotator, but it also assists extending the thigh. The gluteus maximus has its origin between (and around) the iliac crest and the <b>coccyx</b> from where one part radiates into the iliotibial tract and the other stretches down to the gluteal tuberosity under the greater trochanter. The gluteus maximus is primarily an extensor and lateral rotator of the hip joint, and it comes into action when climbing stairs or rising from a sitting to standing posture. Furthermore, the part inserted into the fascia latae abducts and the part inserted into the gluteal tuberosity adducts the hip. The two deep glutei muscles, the gluteus medius and minimus, originate on the lateral side of the pelvis. The medius muscle is shaped like a cap. Its anterior fibers act as a medial rotator and flexor; the posterior fibers as a lateral rotator and extensor; and the entire muscle abducts the hip. The minimus has similar functions and both muscles are inserted onto the greater trochanter.|$|E
500|$|Cats {{have seven}} {{cervical}} vertebrae, as do almost all mammals; 13 thoracic vertebrae (humans have 12); seven lumbar vertebrae (humans have five); three sacral vertebrae like most mammals (humans have five); and a variable number of caudal vertebrae {{in the tail}} (humans retain three to five caudal vertebrae, fused into an internal <b>coccyx).</b> The extra lumbar and thoracic vertebrae account for the cat's spinal mobility and flexibility. Attached to the spine are 13 ribs, the shoulder, and the pelvis. [...] Unlike human arms, cat forelimbs {{are attached to the}} shoulder by free-floating clavicle bones which allow them to pass their body through any space into which they can fit their head.|$|E
500|$|Frogs have no tail, {{except as}} larvae, {{and most have}} long hind legs, {{elongated}} ankle bones, webbed toes, no claws, large eyes, and a smooth or warty skin. They have short vertebral columns, {{with no more than}} 10 free vertebrae and fused tailbones (urostyle or <b>coccyx).</b> Like other amphibians, oxygen can pass through their highly permeable skins. This unique feature allows them to remain in places without access to the air, respiring through their skins. The ribs are poorly developed, so the lungs are filled by buccal pumping and [...] a frog deprived of its lungs can maintain its body functions without them. For the skin to serve as a respiratory organ, it must remain moist. This makes frogs susceptible to various substances they may encounter in the environment, some of which may be toxic and can dissolve in the water film and be passed into their bloodstream. This {{may be one of the}} causes of the worldwide decline in frog populations.|$|E
500|$|Salientia (Latin salere (salio), [...] "to jump") is {{the name}} of the total group that {{includes}} modern frogs in the order Anura as well as their close fossil relatives, the [...] "proto-frogs" [...] or [...] "stem-frogs". The common features possessed by these proto-frogs include 14 presacral vertebrae (modern frogs have eight or 9), a long and forward-sloping ilium in the pelvis, the presence of a frontoparietal bone, and a lower jaw without teeth. The earliest known amphibians that were more closely related to frogs than to salamanders are Triadobatrachus massinoti, from the early Triassic period of Madagascar (about 250 million years ago), and Czatkobatrachus polonicus, from the Early Triassic of Poland (about the same age as Triadobatrachus). The skull of Triadobatrachus is frog-like, being broad with large eye sockets, but the fossil has features diverging from modern frogs. These include a longer body with more vertebrae. The tail has separate vertebrae unlike the fused urostyle or <b>coccyx</b> in modern frogs. The tibia and fibula bones are also separate, making it probable that Triadobatrachus was not an efficient leaper.|$|E
500|$|Bart and Milhouse have {{to remain}} inside The Simpsons house when an ozone hole moves over Springfield. The two dress up as ladies and jump on the bed, singing [...] "Sisters Are Doin' It for Themselves". When Homer comes in abruptly, Bart falls off {{of the bed and}} lands on one of Homer's bowling balls and breaks his <b>coccyx.</b> Dr. Hibbert informs Homer and Marge that Bart will have to use a {{wheelchair}} until the bone has healed. When Bart arrives at Springfield Elementary School the following day, he finds that he cannot enter because the school lacks ramps for the disabled. As Principal Skinner considers a ramp for the school, mafia boss Fat Tony emerges and suggests that his construction company would be a good choice of company to build it. Although the new ramp system almost immediately collapses, Fat Tony informs Skinner that the construction supposedly cost US$200,000 and that the school will still have to pay. In response, Principal Skinner decides to close Springfield Elementary due to lack of funds (having used them to pay off Fat Tony and thus avoid brutal mob reprisals).|$|E
2500|$|The pelvic {{skeleton}} {{is formed}} posteriorly (in {{the area of}} the back), by the sacrum and the <b>coccyx</b> and laterally and anteriorly (forward and to the sides), by a pair of hip bones.|$|E
2500|$|A {{cortisone}} injection {{can also}} be used to give short-term pain relief and reduce the swelling from inflammation of a joint, tendon, or bursa in, for example, the joints of the knee, elbow, and shoulder [...] and into a broken <b>coccyx.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The pelvic {{diaphragm}} {{is composed}} of the levator ani and the coccygeus muscle. [...] These arise between the symphysis and the ischial spine and converge on the <b>coccyx</b> and the anococcygeal ligament which spans between {{the tip of the}} <b>coccyx</b> and the anal hiatus. [...] This leaves a slit for the anal and urogenital openings. [...] Because of the width of the genital aperture, which is wider in females, a second closing mechanism is required. [...] The urogenital diaphragm consists mainly of the deep transverse perineal which arises from the inferior ischial and pubic rami and extends to the urogential hiatus. [...] The urogenital diaphragm is reinforced posteriorly by the superficial transverse perineal.|$|E
2500|$|... 1 January 2015: [...] A {{middle-aged woman}} beaten and {{taken into custody}} after refusing a {{breathalyser}} test while walking home at night. She suffered a fractured <b>coccyx</b> and severe bruising to her head and knees. She filed a complaint and only after she found CCTV footage was the case reexamined by the prosecutor.|$|E
2500|$|The {{vertebrae}} in {{the human}} vertebral column are divided into different regions, which correspond to the curves of the spinal column. The articulating vertebrae are named according to their region of the spine. [...] Vertebrae in these regions are essentially alike, with minor variation. These regions are called the cervical spine, thoracic spine, lumbar spine, sacrum and <b>coccyx.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Charles went house-hunting by day. At {{night he}} thought about [...] "innumerable variations" [...] (which he still thought were {{acquired}} in some way) with competitive nature selecting the best leading to step by step change, while vestigial organs like the human <b>coccyx</b> (tail) were not, as commonly thought, God [...] "rounding out his original thought [...] exhaustion", but ancestral remnants pointing to [...] "the parent of man".|$|E

2500|$|Structures may be {{described}} as being {{at the level of}} a specific spinal vertebra, depending on the section of the vertebral column the structure is at. The position is often abbreviated. For example, structures {{at the level of the}} fourth cervical vertebra may be abbreviated as [...] "C4", at the level of a thoracic vertebra [...] "T4", at the level of a lumbar vertebra [...] "L3". Because the sacrum and <b>coccyx</b> are fused, [...] they are not often used to provide location.|$|E
2500|$|A {{distinction}} is {{made between the}} lesser or true pelvis inferior to the terminal line, and the greater or false pelvis above it. [...] The pelvic inlet or superior pelvic aperture, which leads into the lesser pelvis, is bordered by the promontory, the arcuate line of ilium, the iliopubic eminence, the pecten of the pubis, and {{the upper part of}} the pubic symphysis. [...] The pelvic outlet or inferior pelvic aperture is the region between the subpubic angle or pubic arch, the ischial tuberosities and the <b>coccyx.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The joint {{between the}} sacrum and the <b>coccyx,</b> the sacrococcygeal symphysis, is {{strengthened}} {{by a series}} of ligaments. [...] The anterior sacrococcygeal ligament is an extension of the anterior longitudinal ligament (ALL) that run down the anterior side of the vertebral bodies. [...] Its irregular fibers blend with the periosteum. [...] The posterior sacrococcygeal ligament has a deep and a superficial part, the former is a flat band corresponding to the posterior longitudinal ligament (PLL) and the latter corresponds to the ligamenta flava. [...] Several other ligaments complete the foramen of the last sacral nerve.|$|E
2500|$|There {{is a small}} bone in {{the body}} {{at the base of}} the spinal column called the Luz bone (known by differing traditions as either the <b>coccyx</b> or the seventh {{cervical}} vertebra) from which the body will be rebuilt at the time of resurrection, according to Muslims and Jews who share the belief that this bone does not decay. Muslim books refer to this bone as [...] "^Ajbu al-Thanab" [...] (عَجْبُ الذَّنَب). Rabbi Joshua Ben Hananiah replied to Hadrian, as to how man revived in the world to come, [...] "From Luz, in the back-bone".|$|E

Generally, the soft [...] pronunciation occurs before it also occurs before [...] and [...] {{in a number of}} Greek and Latin loanwords (such as coelacanth, caecum, caesar). The hard [...] pronunciation occurs everywhere else except in the letter combinations , , and [...] which have distinct pronunciation rules. Double [...] generally represents [...] before , as in accident, succeed, and <b>coccyx.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The {{posterior}} {{group includes}} the gluteii maximus, medius, and minimus. [...] Maximus {{has a wide}} origin stretching from the posterior part of the iliac crest and along the sacrum and <b>coccyx,</b> and has two separate insertions: a proximal which radiates into the iliotibial tract and a distal which inserts into the gluteal tuberosity on the posterior side of the femoral shaft. [...] It is primarily an extensor and lateral rotator of the hip joint, but, because of its bipartite insertion, it can both adduct and abduct the hip. [...] Medius and minimus arise on the external surface of the ilium and are both inserted into the greater trochanter. [...] Their anterior fibers are medial rotators and flexors while the posterior fibers are lateral rotators and extensors. [...] The piriformis has its origin on the ventral side of the sacrum and is inserted on the greater trochanter. [...] It abducts and laterally rotates the hip in the upright posture and assists in extension of the thigh.|$|E
