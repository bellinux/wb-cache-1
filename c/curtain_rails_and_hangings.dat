50|$|As of December 2016, {{improvements}} include: converting part of {{the huge}} lounge into a reasonably sized eighth bedroom, converting an unused garage into a large ninth bedroom, erecting a greenhouse, erecting a shed, installing a <b>curtain</b> <b>rail</b> <b>and</b> <b>curtains</b> in the lounge, installing shelving in the lounge-kitchen-bedrooms, installing a large raised bed {{in the garden and}} re-building a garden wall.|$|R
50|$|Some of {{the pews}} {{in the body}} of the church were fitted with brass <b>rails</b> <b>and</b> <b>hangings</b> to make them more private. In the north chapel were the high pews which were raised some feet above the floor and reached by three or four steps. The whole of the nave was filled with paneled pews over which the {{occupiers}} claimed exclusive and permanent right; it was thought something grand to be known as the owner of a 'faculty pew'. The divisions which were exceedingly high, were adorned according to the various owners; some were lined with blue cloth and bedizened with an abundance of large brass-headed nails; others would be scarlet; green baize was the prevailing 'comfort', whilst some of less pretensions were satisfied with paint. These pews were of all shapes and sizes, without the least pretense to uniformity. There was a jealous feeling respecting possession of pews; and it was a common practice for many of the owners to keep the doors carefully locked. When the wicked man came into church, his arrival was announced by the clicking of the locks of pew doors.|$|R
6000|$|They {{started with}} much {{whistling}} and circling, and went away up river under overhanging trees that sometimes swished the funnel, splashing the meadow path {{and making the}} reeds and bulrushes dance with their wash. They went through a reluctant lock, steamed up a long reach, they passed the queerly painted Potwell Inn with its picturesque group of poplars and its absurd new notice-board of [...] "Omlets." ... Theodore was five stone of active happiness; he and the pseudo-twins, strictly under his orders as the universal etiquette of birthdays prescribes, clambered round and round the boat, clutching the awning <b>rail</b> <b>and</b> <b>hanging</b> over the water in an entirely secure and perilous looking manner. No one, unless his father happened to be upset by something, would check him, he knew, on this auspicious day. Mr. Magnet sat with the grey eye on Marjorie and listened a little abstractedly to Mr. Pope, who was telling very fully {{what he would say}} if the Liberal party were to ask his advice at the present juncture. Mrs. Pope attended discreetly, and Daffy and Marjorie with a less restrained interest, to Mr. Wintersloan, who showed them how to make faces out of a fist tied up in a pocket-handkerchief, how to ventriloquize, how to conjure with halfpence--which he did very amusingly--and what the buttons on a man's sleeve were for; Theodore clambering at his back discovered what he was at, and by right of birthday made him do all the faces and tricks over again. Then Mr. Wintersloan told stories of all the rivers along which, he said, he had travelled in steamboats; the Rhine, the Danube, the Hoogly and the Fall River, and particularly how he had been bitten by a very young crocodile. [...] "It's the smell of the oil brings it all back to me," [...] he said. [...] "And the kind of sway it gives you." ...|$|R

50|$|In 2008, {{shortly after}} Daykin moved into his grandparents' home, {{he and his}} {{grandfather}} Stanley Daykin set about converting the garage into a bedroom for him. Daykin wanted both a blackout blind <b>and</b> a <b>curtain</b> <b>rail</b> to ensure no light could break into the room. After Daykin and his grandfather broke several fixings and drill bits attempting to hang the <b>curtain</b> <b>rail,</b> {{he went to the}} local DIY store to find a better solution, but could not find anything suitable. That afternoon they both went to the shed, and created the GripIt invention. The fixing was soon successful in mounting a television on the wall, and Daykin spotted a gap in the market. Four years later a patent was granted for GripIt and the invention was taken to market.|$|R
50|$|A <b>curtain</b> rod, <b>curtain</b> <b>rail,</b> or {{traverse}} rod is {{a device}} used to suspend curtains, usually above windows or {{along the edges}} of showers, though also wherever curtains might be used. When found in bathrooms, curtain rods tend to be telescopic and self-fixing, while curtain rods {{in other areas of the}} home are often affixed with decorative brackets or finial.|$|R
5|$|After {{his release}} from prison in 1951, Berger worked in Stuttgart and Böblingen in his native Baden-Württemberg, <b>and</b> managed a <b>curtain</b> <b>rail</b> factory. He also contributed {{articles}} to the monthly right-wing journal Nation Europa published in Coburg, and occasionally wrote articles encouraging the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation to give greater consideration to {{former members of the}} Waffen-SS. He and his wife Christine had four children: Krista, Wolf, Helgart and Folkart. He died on 5 January 1975 in Gerstetten.|$|R
40|$|In {{this work}} the {{influence}} of Under Sleeper Pads on the dynamic forces on a railway track is investigated. A special interest {{is devoted to the}} effect of using Under Sleeper Pads in a railway track with changing vertical stiffness. The contact force between wheel <b>and</b> <b>rail</b> <b>and</b> the ballast contact forces are examined. For the investigation a finite element model with the length of thirty sleepers is created and calculations are performed with the software LS-DYNA. Three different cases of varying vertical track stiffness are studied: the transition from an embankment to a bridge, a randomly varying track stiffness along the railway track <b>and</b> <b>hanging</b> sleepers...|$|R

Carol and Viv strike {{a deal that}} Viv would sell her the Post Office, planning to buy the B&B but Carol goes behind Viv's back and buys the B&B for herself. Furious at her friend's betrayal, Viv throws Carol {{out of the house}} and she responds by hiding a bag of frozen prawns in a <b>curtain</b> <b>rail.</b> Bob's excuses make Viv suspicious and she entraps him into admitting the existence of another wife, Barbara. Viv forgives him, and decides to try and raise some cash for a honeymoon by entering the Naughty Nylons competition organised by Bob's firm. Viv wins and Bob is fired.|$|R

5000|$|A show {{hunter is}} {{supposed}} to make its movements look effortless; and maintain a long, low, ground-covering stride with a swinging shoulder, and a low head and neck set [...] They are expected to never stop at a fence, cause a knockdown or a rub, and take every fence in good form and hitting every planned stride in between [...] While these characteristics are important for a field hunter, as a knockdown or a rub {{could result in a}} fall for the rider, the way of going is not as important for the field hunter as for the show hunter. The show hunter typically takes the fences at a far slower pace than the field hunter, and in far more controlled conditions. Hunters showing at indoor shows compete on flat, even surfaces over specified [...] "natural type" [...] fences such as coops, post <b>and</b> <b>rails,</b> <b>hanging</b> gates, brush, roll-backs, faux stone and brick walls, <b>and</b> natural-colored <b>rails.</b> Hunters competing at outdoor shows may or may not compete on even surfaces, however even when competing on an outdoor grass course with a couple of rolling surfaces, they still don't have to worry about navigating holes, rocks trees, lumpy cornfields, macadam road surfaces, and the like, which means that their hardiness is not generally tested at the show.|$|R

60|$|One {{afternoon}} {{he was working}} near the road, when he was startled by an outcry from his Chinese laborers, their rapid dispersal from the strawberry beds where they were working, the splintering crash of his fence <b>rails,</b> <b>and</b> a commotion among the buckeyes. Furious at what seemed to {{him one of the}} usual wanton attacks upon coolie labor, he seized his pick and ran to their assistance. But he was surprised to find Jocelinda's mustang caught by the saddle and struggling between two trees, and its unfortunate mistress lying upon the strawberry bed. Shocked but cool-headed, Jackson released the horse first, who was lashing out and destroying everything within his reach, and then turned to his cousin. But she had already lifted herself to her elbow, and with a trickle of blood and mud on one fair cheek was surveying him scornfully under her tumbled hair <b>and</b> <b>hanging</b> hat.|$|R

50|$|Hunters use {{climbing}} {{stands to}} take the stand to different locations easily. Although not permanent like ladder stands <b>and</b> <b>hanging</b> stands, they can relocate a hunter to a different tree easily. Some hunters do leave them in the woods {{at the base of the}} tree. Climbing stands allow hunters that want to hunt from them to use a climbing stand at a location that will not allow them to keep a stand up during the whole season. Often ladder stands <b>and</b> <b>hanging</b> stands do not move easily, so they tend to stay on one tree. Because branches limit climbing stand use, ladder stands <b>and</b> <b>hanging</b> stands allow hunters more options on the trees with many branches at a lower height.|$|R
