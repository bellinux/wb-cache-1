25|$|Most of the {{material}} acquired from the National Marine Fisheries Service Tropical Atlantic Biological (TABL) collection consists of western Atlantic fishes from nearshore shallows to moderate depths, with the families Argentinidae, Atherinidae, Balistidae, Batrachoididae, Belonidae, Bothidae, Branchiostomatidae, <b>Caproidae,</b> Carangidae, Clupeidae, Congridae, Cynoglossidae, Dasyatidae, Engraulididae, Exocoetidae, Fundulidae, Gadidae, Gerreidae, Haemulidae, Hemiramphidae, Lutjanidae, Macrouridae, Monacanthidae, Mugilidae, Ogcocephalidae, Ophichthidae, Ophidiidae, Paralichthyidae, Peristediidae, Priacanthidae, Rajiidae, Sciaenidae, Scombridae, Serranidae, Scorpaenidae, Scyliorhinidae, Soleidae, Sparidae, Sphyraenidae, Stromateidae, Squalidae, Syngnathidae, Synodontidae, Tetraodontidae, and Triglidae most common. These collections have been substantially augmented by the field activities of museum personnel and donations made over the last 20 years. Eastern Atlantic collections from the Gulf of Guinea are available in some abundance. The western Atlantic collections acquired from the National Marine Fisheries Service Pascagoula laboratory and University of Miami are generally from greater depths and represent some of the museum's most valuable resources. Deepwater anguilliform, salmoniform, stomiiform, aulopiform, myctophiform, and ophidiiform families are particularly well represented. For certain families, i.e. searsiidae, alepocephalidae, these collections may be among the best North American holdings from the western Atlantic region.|$|E

50|$|Boarfishes {{are a small}} family, <b>Caproidae,</b> {{of marine}} fishes {{comprising}} two genera and 12 species. They were formerly placed in the order Zeiformes with the dories, but are now placed with the Perciformes since they have many perciform characteristics, for instance in the caudal skeleton. Boarfishes are native to the Indian, Atlantic, and Pacific Oceans, where they are mainly found at depths below 50 m.|$|E

40|$|Acanthuroid fishes {{are often}} {{considered}} archetyal coral-reef fishes. We use characters of both larvae and adults {{to redefine the}} Acanthuroidei to include the traditional acanthuroid families (Acanthuridae, Ephippidae, Luvaridae, Scatophagidae, Siganidae, Zanclidae) and several taxa usually placed within the Percoidei (Antigonia, Chaetodontidae, Drepaneidae, Leiognathidae, Lobotidae, Pomacanthidae). These taxa share a specialised tooth ontogeny. Based on larval morphology (particularly head spination, sculpting on the skull, early development of posteriorly-placed pelvic fins, pigmentation, and body shape) and adult morphology (dorsal gill-arches) the Lobotidae is newly diagnosed to include the genera Lobotes, Datnioides and Hapalogenys. These three genera have traditionally been placed in the families Lobotidae, Datnioididae and Haemulidae, respectively, although Hapalogenys was sometimes placed in a separate Hapalogenyidae. Three-item analysis shows that Lobotidae is the sister group of the remaining acanthuroids. Antigonia and Leiognathidae are nested within a clade consisting of the traditional acanthuroids {{on the basis of}} a number of synapomorphies, including a single postcleithrum, five or fewer branchiostegal rays, absence of the interarcual cartilage and larval morphology. The sister group of the Acanthuroidei remains unclear. We compare this phylogeny of the revised Acanthuroidei with recent phylogenies based exclusively on genetic data. Although the different gene-based phylogenies agree on some aspects, they disagree on others. Similarly, the morphology-based phylogeny has areas of both agreement and disagreement with the gene-based phylogenies. Areas of agreement (where relevant taxa were included in the analysis) include: removal of Hapalogenys from Haemulidae; inclusion of Lobotes, Datnioides and Hapalogenys in Lobotidae; Lobotidae, <b>Caproidae</b> and Leiognathidae related to at least some of the acanthuroid taxa as defined here; Luvaridae and Zanclidae included in Acanthuroidei. The redefined Acanthuroidei includes species that live in a wide variety of habitats: coral reefs, epipelagic oceans, muddy and sandy bottoms, outer continental shelves and slopes, estuaries, mangroves and even fresh water...|$|E
