5|$|Israel entered one artistic gymnast {{into the}} Olympic competition. Two-time Olympian Alexander Shatilov {{qualified}} and claimed his Olympic {{spot in the}} men's apparatus and all-around events via the Olympic Test Event in Rio de Janeiro by participation. Shatilov participated in both the London and Beijing Olympics. He did not advance following the qualification round in the floor and horizontal bar events due to not achieving eighth place or higher in either. Shatilov's loss in the qualification rounds makes Rio his worst Olympic finish ever. In regards to the loss, he said “things didn’t go as I planned, but that happens in sport and there’s nothing I <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>about</b> it. You {{need to know how}} to cope with disappointments and life continues. I trained hard and wanted to have a good competition, but you can’t turn the clock back. I started my floor drill well, but a small mistake cost me and I knew I had no chance after that. I never imagined a scenario like this.” He performed poorly in both the floor and bar routines, scoring 13.5 points in the floor routine, and 14.066 points in the bar routine. The floor exercise was riddled with errors and ended with a landing where it appeared as if he was trying to break a fall.|$|E

25|$|Diamond's next book, , {{published}} in 2005, examines {{a range of}} past societies {{in an attempt to}} identify why they either collapsed or continued to thrive and considers what contemporary societies can learn from these historical examples. As in Guns, Germs, and Steel, he argues against explanations for the failure of past societies based primarily on cultural factors, instead focusing on ecology. Among the societies mentioned in the book are the Norse and Inuit of Greenland, the Maya, the Anasazi, the indigenous people of Rapa Nui (Easter Island), Japan, Haiti, the Dominican Republic, and modern Montana. The book concludes by asking why some societies make disastrous decisions, how big businesses affect the environment, what our principal environmental problems are today, and what individuals <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>about</b> those problems. Like Guns, Germs, and Steel, Collapse was translated into dozens of languages, became an international best-seller, and was the basis of a television documentary produced by the National Geographic Society. It was also nominated for the Royal Society Prize for Science Books.|$|E
25|$|Hartmann {{is also a}} vocal {{critic of}} the effects of {{neoliberal}} globalization on the U.S. economy, claiming that economic policies enacted during and since the presidency of Ronald Reagan have led, in large part, to many American industrial enterprises' being acquired by multinational firms based in overseas countries, leading in many cases to manufacturing jobs'—once considered a major foundation of the U.S. economy—being relocated to countries in Asia and other areas where the costs of labor are lower than in the U.S. and the concurrent reversal of the United States' traditional role of a leading exporter of finished manufactured goods to that of a primary importer of finished manufactured goods (exemplified by massive trade deficits with countries such as China). Hartmann argues that this phenomenon is leading to the erosion of the American middle class, whose survival Hartmann deems critical to the survival of American democracy. This argument is expressed in Hartmann's 2006 book, Screwed: The Undeclared War Against The Middle Class and What We <b>Can</b> <b>Do</b> <b>About</b> It. One of the book's main arguments is that media deregulation leads to corporate media's shifting the American consensus towards the acceptance of privatization and massive corporate profits—which causes the shrinking of the middle class.|$|E

500|$|As {{the release}} of the new album approached, the band and its {{management}} found {{that they would have to}} navigate changes in the music industry, which Hurley described as [...] "a completely different place."

[...] The group's 2007 album Infinity on High sold one million copies, which was considered a disappointment compared to From Under the Cork Trees sales of three million. Trohman attributed this to [...] "the same reason that nobody's records are selling that well: there's so much turmoil in the music industry, so much downsizing, and people are finding different ways to get their music more and more all the time. There's very little we <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>about</b> that as a band. All we can do is try to make great music and hope it connects with people." ...|$|E
500|$|Early in the series, Clark {{was still}} {{learning}} how to handle his life, by learning to control his powers and find the best solution for everyone. His main priority was {{to fit in with}} his friends at school and be an average guy. Initially, Clark's biggest problem was the fact that he could not share his secret with anyone he cared about. According to Welling, [...] "He is burdened with a lot of responsibility. He hasn't been able to choose whether or not he has these abilities. All this responsibility has just been thrust on him, and he has to deal with it. There have got to be times when he goes home and thinks to himself, ‘Why me?' He wishes it could all go away and he could just be normal. That's part of the character dilemma which makes him interesting to play." [...] Welling noted that the show was not about Clark always saving the day, but more about how using his powers [...] "... alienate him from others". Welling reasoned {{that by the end of}} season three, Clark had decided that leaving Smallville and going with Jor-El was something that would save everyone a lot of pain in the long run. Welling described why Clark finally gave in to Jor-El at the end of season three:"If you can't fight them, you might as well join them [...] he was choosing the lesser of two evils to go with Jor-El. I think a combination of those two things would probably sum it up. A lot of times in your life, you get to a point where you go, 'I just can't fight this anymore. There's nothing I <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>about</b> it, so I better get up out of bed and go to work!' And in a sense, that's what Clark had to do. Somehow he had to try to face what it was that was causing him so much pain—and everyone else so much pain—and maybe he reasoned that by causing everyone else a little bit of pain, he could save them a lot of pain in the long run." ...|$|E
