40|$|This paper {{examines}} the dynamically consistent price path {{for a new}} product monopolist, unable to commit to future prices, when consumers must incur setup costs of adopting the product. The authors find that setup costs give rise to a price path with introductory sales: along the path, periods of high prices, during which only locked-in or <b>captive</b> <b>customers</b> buy the product, alternate with sales (low-price) periods, during which new customers adopt the product. As the stock of <b>captive</b> <b>customers</b> increases over time, sales become less frequent; after the customer base reaches some critical level, no further sales take place. They show that the monopolist may hold a "sleeping patient" in which initial sales of the product are postponed to avoid locking into a high-pricing strategy that ignores new customers.

40|$|Two {{different}} ?styles? {{of foreign}} direct investment {{that emerged in the}} global economy {{at the end of the}} nineteenth century combined to electrify Barcelona before WWI.  German electrical equipment manufacturers, in association with specialized investment bankers, began the process of electrification in the 1890 s and 1900 s by setting up subsidiary operating companies in Barcelona as <b>captive</b> <b>customers</b> for their equipment. After 1911 a different style of {{foreign direct investment}}, originating from Canada, deploying different technological, financial and business strategies, created an integrated, regional, hydroelectric monopoly in the region.

40|$|Regulatory {{changes and}} {{technological}} advances have profoundly affected the competitive landscape of credit markets. In this paper, we investigate how intermediaries alter their infor-mation acquisition strategies {{in response to}} increased competition. We specify a model where the severity of asymmetric information between banks and borrowers increases with their infor-mational distance. As the number of active banks grows, investments in information acquisition initially fall with returns to informed intermediation. However, when a critical investment threshold is reached, further entry leads to specialization. Intermediaries optimally refocus in-formational resources in their core markets by retrenching from peripheral segments to fend off competitive threats to their <b>captive</b> <b>customer</b> base.

40|$|Price capped firms enjoy a {{large degree}} of pricing discretion, which may damage <b>captive</b> <b>customers</b> and have adverse effects on the {{development}} of competition when regulated firms also operate in competitive industries. We study two alternative regulatory approaches to limit such a discretion. The first one places a fixed upper limit to the prices charged in captive markets; the other constrains the captive prices relatively to the price asset in the more competitive markets. We refer to the former approach as the Absolute regime, and to the latter as the Relative regime. We analyse the effects on prices, competition, and welfare stemming from the two regimes in a simple model where the regulated firm faces competition by a competitive fringe in some of the markets it serves. We find that the Relative regime is not much more effective in protecting <b>captive</b> <b>customers</b> since <b>captive</b> prices may be identical under both regimes. Moreover, since it makes more costly to the incumbent regulated firm to reduce its competitive price, this is weakly higher than under the Absolute regime. However, this is also the reason why the Relative regime turns out to be more pro-competitive: the total output supplied by competitors and/or the number of firms entering the potentially competitive market might be enhanced under this rule. The effects on aggregate welfare are ambiguous. We provide some evidence that the Relative regime is more likely to positively affect consumers' surplus and social welfare the more efficient is the competitive fringe. price regulation, pricing discretion, competition...|$|R

40|$|This article {{addresses}} the restructuration of the utilities sector/industry, a process generally described as deregulation. At {{the core of}} deregulation processes, {{not only in the}} EU, but also in the US, lies the replacement of old-fashioned forms of state regulation based on ownership control by new forms of regulation based on the operation of an independent regulatory body. In Central and Eastern European countries undergoing economic transition, surviving communist-type behavior, along with half-implemented EU deregulation directives, have led to specifically re-regulated utility markets. The new forms of regulation applied in the process of deregulation have served only to preserve the market protection of former state monopolies. Regulators who manage deregulation processes in the EU style allocate benefits across organized producer and consumer groups, so that the regulators' total utility is maximized. <b>captive</b> <b>customer,</b> cross-subsidy, deregulation, interest group, natural monopoly, public service, re-regulation, regulator, regulatory failure, rent-seeking process...|$|E

40|$|In this paper, a {{realistic}} replenishment model with multiple warehouses (one is primary warehouse (PW) {{from where the}} items are sold and others are secondary warehouses (SWs) where the items are stored) is developed with fuzzy lead-time {{under the assumption that}} the capacities of the warehouses are finite. Inflation and time value of money are taken into account. The items of secondary warehouses are transported to the primary warehouse in continuous release pattern and associated transportation cost is proportional to the distance from PW to SWs. The holding cost of items in SWs has reverse effect with distance. Here, the demand of items is a deterministic function of selling price and the displayed inventory. Deterioration rates of the items are constant and different in different warehouses. The replenishment rate is infinite and the problem is constructed with shortages, which are the mixture of back orders and lost sales. The backlogged demand is assumed to be a function of currently backlogged amount. When an item is out of stock, the loyal and <b>captive</b> <b>customers</b> will wait until the outstanding orders arrive and are served.

40|$|In this dissertation, I analyze {{behavior}} of {{two types of}} financial intermediaries that play critical roles in capital allocation: ratings agencies and merger advisors. Each type of intermediary survives due to (assumed) informational advantages relative to firms and investors. In the following chapters, I analyze how differences in information between market participants and intermediaries lead to signaling behavior related to privately-observed quality. My results explain some seemingly-anomalous aspects of financial markets, and {{provide a framework for}} assessing the impact intermediaries can have on efficient capital allocation. In the first chapter, I examine whether rating agencies strategically manipulate the informativeness of bond ratings in response to competition from private lenders. I model a monopolistic rating agency that caters to a low-quality marginal customer with uninformative ratings. High-quality customers prefer informative ratings but are <b>captive</b> <b>customers</b> of the rating agency in the absence of competition from private lenders. With competition from private lenders, the rating agency uses informative ratings to keep high-quality customers in public markets. The model also suggests that the ratings sector dampens the impact of capital supply shocks, and offers a strategic pricing rationale for the controversial practice of issuing unsolicited credit ratings. In the second chapter, I test predictions of the model using a measure of informativeness based on the impact of unexpected ratings on a debt issuer's borrowing cost. I analyze two events that increased the relative supply of private vs. public lending: the temporary shutdown of the high-yield market in 1989 and legislation in 1994 that reduced barriers to interstate bank lending. After each event, I find that the informativeness of ratings increased for issuers whose relative supply of private vs. public capital increased most. In the third chapter, I analyze how acquiring firms select and pay advisors. I present a model in which an advisor with privately known quality screens targets (due diligence) and improves negotiation outcomes (bidding). When a transaction involves only bidding, advisors pool by offering fees contingent on a completed transaction. By contrast, a transaction involving due diligence can lead to a separating equilibrium and fixed fees. The model predicts that acquirers use advisor market share instead of stock return-based measures to select advisors when synergies are not observable, and that acquirers with better information about advisor quality pay higher fees. I argue that investors in leveraged buyouts are skilled in acquisitions, and find that they pay higher fees for both mergers and tender offers, controlling for assignment and deal characteristics. They are also less likely to include contingent fees than other acquirers. Results suggest skilled investors use private information about advisor ability to hire advisors, and do so primarily to screen targets rather than to improve negotiation outcomes...|$|R
40|$|We {{explore the}} {{transformation}} of consumer credit markets in France through the twentieth-century from a case study. The local, face-to-face credit market in Lens, northern France, developed {{against a background of}} immigration and so was not based on pre-existing social networks but on the attractiveness of credit and of the goods on offer. The entrepreneurs involved innovated by connecting together the Parisian textile networks and demand from working-class Polish families. They profited from their belonging to both Jewish and Polish communities. This credit was expensive, carried no interest, was inseparable from the goods sold and the home service provided, and was not understood by the authorities, staying in a black hole of state control. Two processes put an end to it: (i) the disappearance of a way of life, of the <b>captive</b> <b>customer</b> base, complicating face-to-face identification and requiring use of the state’s means of identification (vital statistics records, identity cards) —with the state guaranteeing the identity of those involved on the market and extending business beyond networks of acquaintances—and (ii) legislative action and reorganization of credit activities to the advantage of commercial banks. The specificity of French credit market is that this is the state which first shaped markets in a move to standardize the economy. This formalization was extended by banks that progressively provided credit regardless of any personal relations...|$|E
40|$|Utilities are {{characterized}} by three features: first, their required technologies are commonly considered specific, sunk investments; second, they display aspects of natural monopoly, including economies of scale and scope in the physical provision of basic services, economies of scale in network planning and management, network externalities and advantages in raising capital; and third, their products are massively consumed, usually by <b>captive</b> <b>customers</b> with fairly inelastic demand. Thus, for example, an electricity company's assets have very little value in an alternative use, network externalities and economies of density imply {{that it may not}} be economical to have multiple wires deployed on the same street, and finally, its product is consumed by a large proportion of a city's population, who have an inelastic demand for electricity. Compare this situation to that of the steel industry, also characterized by large sunk investments. While steel mills have very little value in alternative uses, the economies of scale and scope are trivial compared {{to the size of the}} market. Furthermore, while everyone indirectly consumes steel products, very few individuals pay any attention to the price of steel. Thus, utilities are not characterized simply by specific investments or economies of scale. Or consider the newspaper industry. There are clearly large economies of scale and scope in the operation of city newspapers. Increases in the speed of communication and computer design use have drastically amplified the sector's economies of scale. This has resulted in a reduced number of newspapers per city while readership numbers have remained relatively constant. While readers are usually a relatively large portion of the population (at least of the voting population), newspapers are not utilities, because while there may be a substantial amount of sector specific human capital (reporters' contacts with local politicians may be specific to the locality), the technology is increasingly generic and investments are transferable. Shutting down a newspaper and moving the printing presses, desks, computers, etc, elsewhere has become more and more common. Those three features that distinguish the utility sector from the rest of the economy are at the core of the contracting problems that have traditionally raised the need for governmental regulation of utilities. In the utility sector three types of contracting problems are particularly important: contracting problems between firms and the government, which distort the investment incentives of utility companies; contracting problems between firms and their customers that result in the exercise of market power by the incumbent utility; and contracting problems between governments and interest groups that require governments to distort utility pricing for income distribution (cross-subsidization) purposes. When correcting for these three contracting problems, appropriate regulation will provide the incentives for firms to invest to efficient levels, induce the firms to price their services to second-best levels, creates the framework for productive efficiency and minimize opportunities for cross- subsidization or interest groups capture. ...|$|R

40|$|The thesis {{deals with}} methods of {{electricity}} pricing under various conditions. The {{goal was to}} develop new methods concerning the main theme and to create software tools for calculations. The main aim was pricing of new or enhanced electricity consumption. A method of determining the marginal cost is used. Development {{in the field of}} cost separation to the generation and distribution parts was made. The program MarNakl for calculation was created. The main part of the thesis deals with the economic evaluation of different variants of expansion and renewal of the electricity system. A new formula based on calculation of the average annual economic cost was derived and our personal contribution includes the formula adjustment to cover the tax system and external financing. The theory of real options for project risk decrease evaluation was evolved. The software tool FINAL Rozvoj for calculations of the previously mentioned economic criterion was built. The important issue now is the calculation of tariffs for <b>captive</b> and eligible <b>customers.</b> A new methodology of costing and profit splitting to different consumer group was composed.

40|$|Utilities' {{provision}} {{does not}} excite too many people. Nevertheless, {{the effectiveness of}} the supply of public transport (trains and busses), electricity, gas, water, waste, sports and recreation, medical and social services and urban development influences the shape of an economy and the well-being of its citizens. Frequently, the utilities are arranged by the municipalities which have organised themselves inintermunicipal utilities. As intermunicipal utilities are initially established by the municipal budget, they still constitute the municipal balance sheet. As such, municipalities could sell their share in the intermunicipal utilities to counterbalance financial setbacks (if e. g. budgetsurpluses or unused tax levels are depleted). Knowledge of the value ofthe utility seems essential. Still, 94 % of the Dutch municipalities could not provide full insight in the value of its participations. Among the explanations, they attribute wrong (not up-to-date) information and wrong bookings of assets (Gerritsen, 2002). By using the net assets, De Witte and Moesen (2006) estimated the value of the Flemish intermunicipal utilities at 13 billion euros in 2003 (about 9 % of Flemish GDP). Not a neglectible sector. Besides the lack of knowledge of the value, (public) utilities often face a poor corporate governance structure (De Witte and Moesen, 2007). For example in Flanders, by law mandatory in (public) utilities are required to be politicians. This raises doubts about the objectivity of the appointment (i. e. are they appointed because of intrinsic qualities or because of a political agenda?). In addition, the board of directors (which according to corporate governance rules is preferably small in order to be effective) is often too large and acts as a consolidation price for unelected politicians. Large boards provide incentives for free riding, complexity and low effectiveness. This in turn harms the efficiency of the utility. The quiet life Basically, the two problems are related to a third problem which is intrinsic {{to the nature of the}} goods. The utilities often have a natural monopoly characteristic in that the provision of the good is cheaper at a larger scale. As such, the public utilities are monopolists, or at least regional monopolists. Without facing competition andwith <b>captive</b> <b>customers,</b> the monopolists lack incentives to provide the goods as effective and as efficient as possible. Hicks (1935) illustrated this by the quiet life in which the workers of a monopolistic company are unmotivated (e. g. longer coffee breaks, surfing on the internet, etc.). Leibenstein (1966) showed the problem by pointing to the X-inefficiencies in which the firms' managers overinvest, acquire unnecessary resources to expand (and show) their wealth or in which labour unions bargainfor above-market wages. Moreover, a (regional) monopolist can easily make excessive profits by increasing the prices for the <b>captive</b> <b>customers.</b> To increase the performances of the regional monopolies, society (the principal) should create incentives for the utility (the agent). The incentives could firstly originate from the utilities which anticipate changes in society (when e. g. thanks to increased technological possibilities and to changed ideological preferences a threat of privatization arises). Secondly, regulators could provide incentives by setting maximum prices or maximum revenues (i. e. yardstick competition). Thirdly, a concerned public opinion could stimulate efficiency if performances are published (i. e. sunshine regulation). In a similar sunshine regulatory framework, the performance measure should be comprehensible (e. g. one composite indicator instead of a set of (contradictory) values),correct (e. g. account for diverging exogenous influences among the utilities) and robust to the model assumptions (e. g. they should not rely ona particular functional form which heavily influences the results). Especially the composite indicators could yield clear advantages for both the utilities, the regulator and the public opinion: (1) knowing at a single glance the performance, (2) comparing the overall performance of entities, (3) easiness to explain to outsiders and stakeholders, and (4) setting targets and guiding long term objectives easily. Methodological choice and issues In this thesis, we focus on composite indicators as a tool to provide incentives to regional monopolists. To develop composite indicators for the performance of the utilities, we start from the non-parametric efficiency measurement literature. Relying on only a few assumptions, the non-parametric models `let the data speak for themselves'as they do not require an a priori specified functional form on the data. As such, efficiency is defined as a relative concept in which the input usage and the output production of an evaluated observation is compared to best practice observations. The excessive input use, or output shortfall, relative to the best practice observation is considered as inefficiency. As efficiency is defined in terms of production possibilities, efficiency is technical. The focus on non-parametric models is not unchallanged. The parametric literature is well developed (e. g. Greene, 2007). It is for example relatively easy to explore stastical inference, capture endogeneity and allow for noisy data. In addition, parametric models havein comparison to non-parametric models a high rate of convergence and alow curse of dimensionality. Efficiency evaluations are possible by parametric (e. g. Corrected Ordinarily Least Squares) and semi-parametric (e. g. Stochastic Frontier Analysis) models. Nevertheless, the parametric literature has one major drawback on the non-parametric models. In particular, the models require the a priori specification of the production function. This is extremely problematic in many real life studies as the researcher often has no idea on this specification. A well specified parametric model (thus the same estimated model specification as the true underlying model) delivers superior results (in terms of rate of convergence) than a non-parametric model. However, a wrongly specified parametricmodel delivers inconsistent results. As particularly this true underlying model specification is typically unknown, the main focus of the thesis lies on non-parametric models. Nevertheless, in Chapter 5 we employ parametric models as a robustness test for the non-parametric estimations. There are three intricate issues in the non-parametric models. Firstly, by construction the relative performance evaluation is sensitive to outlying and atypical observations (as these best practice observations could heavily distort the efficiency scores). We deal with these observations by the robust order-m efficiency scores (see Chapter 1). Secondly, the utilities should only be compared to `comparable' utilities, in particular utilities with similar exogenous variables. For this purpose, we use the conditional efficiency estimates (see Chapter 1). Finally, non-parametric efficiency estimates depend on the observed data so that a bias between a true (unobserved) production process and the observed production process could arise. Bootstrapping algorithms provide a solution to estimate the bias (see Chapter 3). Structure and contributions By exploring and developing methodological advances in efficiency measurement, and by carefully examining particular issues in a regional monopolistic sector (i. e. the drinking water sector), thisthesis could be of interest to both academics and practitioners. The academics will focus on the first part of the thesis, whereas the second part will potentially attract the practitioners. This first part explores the theoretical foundationsof the non-parametric efficiency estimation. Alternatively, it can be considered as a general toolbox for regulators. In Chapter 1, we define the traditional Free Disposal Hull and Data Envelopment Analysis model. As has been outlined before, this traditional model suffers from some inconveniences. We show how to reduce the deterministic nature by considering partial frontiers and how to introduce heterogeneity incorporation byusing conditional efficiency estimates. Besides these main topics, we examine panel data applications and non-oriented models. In addition, we propose a procedure to tackle sample size bias by using the robust order-m efficiencies. To make these contributions and the state-of-the-art survey comprehensible, we illustrated the procedures by the use of a real life data set. As is pointed out in Chapter 1, the traditional selection in non-parametric models of heterogenous inputs, outputs and exogenous variables influences the results. In general, the selection of inputs and outputs is rather straightforward and less vulnerable to discussion. However, the more important is the selection of exogenous variables. Evaluated entities operating in a favorable environment will obtain higher efficiency scores. To avoid similar discussions, Chapter 2 develops a model which estimates efficiency without the a priori selection of a set of exogenous variables. In particular, by reinterpreting the metafrontier literature, we propose a model which assesses efficiency while `fully' accounting for the operational environment. Outlying observations are particularly disturbing innon-parametric estimations. In Chapter 3, we suggest a model which detects and analyses a more extensive range of outlying observations. Indeed, the existing outlier detection models are only able to detect a specific range of outlying observations (e. g. super-efficient observations or units with a large leverage). The suggested procedure is able to detect a broad range of outlying observations. The detected observations could be deleted from the sample or could further investigated (as they are potentially the most interesting observations in that they present the best or worst practices). The second part of the thesis applies the non-parametric approaches of the first part to the regional monopolistic drinking water sector (although the toolbox of Part 1 contains more tools than weapply in this thesis). In Part 2, we explain and develop some additional methodologies to tackle the specific research questions in this part. The drinking water sector is an extremely interesting and promising sector to study as (1) the debate is complicated by ideological opinions (e. g. private versus public water provision), (2) these ideological opinions created various regulatory models with a diverging effectiveness, (3) as supra-national bodies (e. g. European Union) do not seem to succeed increating homogenous regulation (in contrast to other network sectors asrailways or electricity), (4) as the responsibility of the water provision (mostly) belongs to the municipalities which often lack the resources to create a strong principal-agent setting, and finally (5) as in the future the importance of a (clean, cheap and efficient) water provision is expected to increase in importance. Studying technical efficiency in the water sector is attractive as we focus on the ability to avoid waste. In Chapter 4, by comparing several regulatory modelsas implemented in 5 countries, we evaluate the effectiveness of incentive mechanisms. By the use of a double bootstrap, we estimate the impact of several exogenous variables and explore some of them more in detail in Chapter 5 and 6 (in particular the scale, scope and incentive regulation). Chapter 4 develops also an alternative and bootstrapping inspired procedure to tackle sample size bias. In Chapter 5, we examine the influence of potential scale economies for both large and small utilities. To investigate the large utilities we consider the Dutch drinking water utilities. However, this complicates the analysis as we have to distinguish scale (or merger) economies from the structural efficiency gains in the sector. The outcome of the specially tailored non-parametric model is compared to parametric specifications. The small utilities are analyzed by considering Portuguese drinking water data. We propose a systematic framework to analyze the existence of scale and scope economies and to detect the optimal scale of operations. Chapter 6 analyses for the Dutch drinking water sector the influence of the public debate. In other words, could a public debate provide an effective alternative to (strict) regulation? If public opinion makers denounce the performance, profits or prices of the utilities, do the utilities change their behavior? We analyze this research question by developing a robust and conditional extension of a profit decomposition model. We relate the outcomes of the profit decomposition to the changes in the regulatory framework. Obviously, the procedures and results of this thesishave a broader application than the drinking water sector. The procedures can easily be adapted to sectors which allow defining input, output and contextual variables. The results could easily be translated to othernetwork sectors (airports, ports, solid waste, etc.) or to sectors which face similar incentive issues (e. g. education, health sector, etc.). status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Dans cette thèse, nous étudions les aspects comportementaux d'agents qui interagissent dans des systèmes de files d'attente à l'aide de modèles de {{simulation}} et de méthodologies expérimentales. Chaque période les clients doivent choisir un prestataire de servivce. L'objectif est d'analyser l'impact des décisions {{des clients}} et des prestataires sur la formation des files d'attente. Dans un premier cas nous considérons des clients ayant un certain degré d'aversion au risque. Sur la base de leur perception de l'attente moyenne et de la variabilité de cette attente, ils forment une estimation de la limite supérieure de l'attente chez chacun des prestataires. Chaque période, ils choisissent le prestataire pour lequel cette estimation est la plus basse. Nos résultats indiquent qu'il n'y a pas de relation monotone entre le degré d'aversion au risque et la performance globale. En effet, une population de clients ayant un degré d'aversion au risque intermédiaire encoure généralement une attente moyenne plus élevée qu'une population d'agents indifférents au risque ou très averses au risque. Ensuite, nous incorporons les décisions des prestataires en leur permettant d'ajuster leur capacité de service sur la base de leur perception de la fréquence moyenne d'arrivées. Les résultats montrent que le comportement des clients et les décisions des prestataires présentent une forte "dépendance au sentier". En outre, nous montrons que les décisions des prestataires font converger l'attente moyenne pondérée vers l'attente de référence du marché. Finalement, une expérience de laboratoire dans laquelle des sujets jouent le rôle de prestataire de service nous a permis de conclure que les délais d'installation et de démantèlement de capacité affectent de manière significative la performance et les décisions des sujets. En particulier, les décisions du prestataire, sont influencées par ses commandes en carnet, sa capacité de service actuellement disponible et les décisions d'ajustement de capacité qu'il a prises, mais pas encore implémentées. - Queuing {{is a fact}} of life that we witness daily. We all have had the experience of waiting in line for some reason and we also know that it is an annoying situation. As the adage says "time is money"; this is perhaps the best way of stating what queuing problems mean for customers. Human beings are not very tolerant, but they are even less so when having to wait in line for service. Banks, roads, post offices and restaurants are just some examples where people must wait for service. Studies of queuing phenomena have typically addressed the optimisation of performance measures (e. g. average waiting time, queue length and server utilisation rates) and the analysis of equilibrium solutions. The individual behaviour of the agents involved in queueing systems and their decision making process have received little attention. Although this work has been useful to improve the efficiency of many queueing systems, or to design new processes in social and physical systems, it has only provided us with a limited ability to explain the behaviour observed in many real queues. In this dissertation we differ from this traditional research by analysing how the agents involved in the system make decisions instead of focusing on optimising performance measures or analysing an equilibrium solution. This dissertation builds on and extends the framework proposed by van Ackere and Larsen (2004) and van Ackere et al. (2010). We focus on studying behavioural aspects in queueing systems and incorporate this still underdeveloped framework into the operations management field. In the first chapter of this thesis we provide a general introduction to the area, as well as an overview of the results. In Chapters 2 and 3, we use Cellular Automata (CA) to model service systems where <b>captive</b> interacting <b>customers</b> must decide each period which facility to join for service. They base this decision on their expectations of sojourn times. Each period, customers use new information (their most recent experience and that of their best performing neighbour) to form expectations of sojourn time at the different facilities. Customers update their expectations using an adaptive expectations process to combine their memory and their new information. We label "conservative" those customers who give more weight to their memory than to the xiv Summary new information. In contrast, when they give more weight to new information, we call them "reactive". In Chapter 2, we consider customers with different degree of risk-aversion who take into account uncertainty. They choose which facility to join based on an estimated upper-bound of the sojourn time which they compute using their perceptions of the average sojourn time and the level of uncertainty. We assume the same exogenous service capacity for all facilities, which remains constant throughout. We first analyse the collective behaviour generated by the customers' decisions. We show that the system achieves low weighted average sojourn times when the collective behaviour results in neighbourhoods of customers loyal to a facility and the customers are approximately equally split among all facilities. The lowest weighted average sojourn time is achieved when exactly the same number of customers patronises each facility, implying that they do not wish to switch facility. In this case, the system has achieved the Nash equilibrium. We show that there is a non-monotonic relationship between the degree of risk-aversion and system performance. Customers with an intermediate degree of riskaversion typically achieve higher sojourn times; in particular they rarely achieve the Nash equilibrium. Risk-neutral customers have the highest probability of achieving the Nash Equilibrium. Chapter 3 considers a service system similar to the previous one but with risk-neutral customers, and relaxes the assumption of exogenous service rates. In this sense, we model a queueing system with endogenous service rates by enabling managers to adjust the service capacity of the facilities. We assume that managers do so based on their perceptions of the arrival rates and use the same principle of adaptive expectations to model these perceptions. We consider service systems in which the managers' decisions take time to be implemented. Managers are characterised by a profile which is determined by the speed at which they update their perceptions, the speed at which they take decisions, and how coherent they are when accounting for their previous decisions still to be implemented when taking their next decision. We find that the managers' decisions exhibit a strong path-dependence: owing to the initial conditions of the model, the facilities of managers with identical profiles can evolve completely differently. In some cases the system becomes "locked-in" into a monopoly or duopoly situation. The competition between managers causes the weighted average sojourn time of the system to converge to the exogenous benchmark value which they use to estimate their desired capacity. Concerning the managers' profile, we found that the more conservative Summary xv a manager is regarding new information, the larger the market share his facility achieves. Additionally, the faster he takes decisions, the higher the probability that he achieves a monopoly position. In Chapter 4 we consider a one-server queueing system with non-captive customers. We carry out an experiment aimed at analysing the way human subjects, taking on the role of the manager, take decisions in a laboratory regarding the capacity of a service facility. We adapt the model proposed by van Ackere et al (2010). This model relaxes the assumption of a captive market and allows current customers to decide whether or not to use the facility. Additionally the facility also has potential customers who currently do not patronise it, but might consider doing so in the future. We identify three groups of subjects whose decisions cause similar behavioural patterns. These groups are labelled: gradual investors, lumpy investors, and random investor. Using an autocorrelation analysis of the subjects' decisions, we illustrate that these decisions are positively correlated to the decisions taken one period early. Subsequently we formulate a heuristic to model the decision rule considered by subjects in the laboratory. We found that this decision rule fits very well for those subjects who gradually adjust capacity, but it does not capture the behaviour of the subjects of the other two groups. In Chapter 5 we summarise the results and provide suggestions for further work. Our main contribution is the use of simulation and experimental methodologies to explain the collective behaviour generated by customers' and managers' decisions in queueing systems as well as the analysis of the individual behaviour of these agents. In this way, we differ from the typical literature related to queueing systems which focuses on optimising performance measures and the analysis of equilibrium solutions. Our work can be seen as a first step towards understanding the interaction between customer behaviour and the capacity adjustment process in queueing systems. This framework is still in its early stages and accordingly there is a large potential for further work that spans several research topics. Interesting extensions to this work include incorporating other characteristics of queueing systems which affect the customers' experience (e. g. balking, reneging and jockeying); providing customers and managers with additional information to take their decisions (e. g. service price, quality, customers' profile); analysing different decision rules and studying other characteristics which determine the profile of customers and managers...|$|R
