50|$|In 1972, the Company {{commissioned}} the square {{building in the}} plaza. Architect Ignacio Carrera-Justiz used <b>cantilevered</b> <b>construction,</b> a style invented by Frank Lloyd Wright. Wright observed how well trees with taproots withstood hurricane-force winds. The building, raised 47 {{feet off the ground}} around a central core, features four massive walls, made of sections of inch-thick hammered glass mural tapestries, designed and manufactured in France. The design came from a painting by German artist Johannes M. Dietz.|$|E
5000|$|The {{resulting}} building {{remains the}} largest non-pillared auditorium in the Chicago area, and has permanent seating for 3,740 people, 2,270 {{on the main}} floor and 1,470 in the balcony. The curved balcony was one of the earliest examples of <b>cantilevered</b> <b>construction,</b> and its curvature - as well {{as the rest of the}} layout of the auditorium - was designed so that all lines focus on the pulpit. Designed in an era before modern sound systems, the building has almost-perfect acoustics, and it is reported that the only element detracting from this aspect is the floor carpet.|$|E
5000|$|The Vann {{stairway}} {{is one of}} {{the oldest}} examples of <b>cantilevered</b> <b>construction</b> in Georgia. This was on one side of the main entrance, which originally faced the Federal Road, and works like a set of scales. To get a set of scales to balance themselves, an equal weight must be applied to each side. Though half of the staircase is suspended over the first floor hallway, roughly six inches of the opposite side of the stairway is in a solid brick wall. The brick wall is far denser than the second landing; this means there will never be enough weight on the landing to “tip the scale.” ...|$|E

5000|$|Ford {{purchased}} 1400 {{acres of}} land in Lansing in 1923 to build an airport to connect southland Chicago with his factories in Detroit. [...] Beginning June 1, 1926, work began on clearing land to build the hangar which was expected to, upon completion, hold three of Ford's Tri-Motor planes. [...] The noted architect, Albert Kahn, oversaw the design and construction of the building. He was Henry Ford's chief architect and wanted to design a space that would solve {{a number of problems}} found in early hangars. [...] He incorporated a number of innovations into the building that had not existed in airplane hangars prior to that time. Most hangars were often poorly designed, temporary buildings that were not well lit. [...] To solve this, Kahn incorporated three distinct features into the building. He used an architectural technique known as <b>cantilevered</b> <b>construction</b> that allowed the interior of the building to be open without need for columns to support the building, as well as reduce wind pressure on the building. [...] In addition he designed the hangar doors on the north and south side of the building to be easily moved by just one person. Operating on a wheeled track located {{on the inside of the}} building, the doors could be opened to any length by one person, regardless of the current wind or weather conditions. [...] In addition, Kahn also looked to improve the overall environment of the building by incorporating as much natural light in the building as possible. As a result, he incorporated five large 15 by 18 foot window openings that, when combined with the open sliding doors, allowed for natural light to reach about 40 percent of the total floor area of the hangar. Ford's dreams of Tri-Motor construction were hampered by the beginning of the Great Depression. Ford stopped making airplanes by July 1932, and rented the airport land and the hangar to his former airport manager Elmer L. Browne, and later the Hammond aviator Guy W. Amick. [...] The hangar and the airport were acquired by the Village of Lansing in 1976 in order to qualify for federal funding. [...] The hangar was in its original use until 2011, when it was vacated for preservation purposes. Efforts to rehabilitate the building to its original appearance are currently underway.|$|E

50|$|During the {{construction}} phase between 2003 and 2005, both the M4 Western Motorway and Wallgrove Road continued to carry traffic as normal. This required {{the use of}} balanced <b>cantilever</b> <b>construction</b> methods to position pre-cast concrete bridge segments at heights of up to 23 m above the active motorway.

40|$|Constructability {{considerations}} are of importance in segmental bridge construction as {{the occurrence of}} failures of bridge superstructures under construction have highlighted. For a safe and economical construction process the interactions between construction loads and the permanent structural system, depending on the chosen erection method, need to be evaluated. Segmental bridges can be constructed with methods like Balanced <b>Cantilever</b> <b>Construction,</b> where individual spans are counterweighted about their substructure support. Time-dependent material properties like strength of the newly cast concrete, as well as shrinkage, creep, and relaxation influence the structural system resistance. Resulting stresses in the unfinished bridge structure during construction can even exceed the final stresses during service. This paper makes an educational contribution by illustrating these concepts with the case study of the Wilson Creek Bridge in Virginia. This five-span cast-in-place bridge was constructed using Balanced <b>Cantilever</b> <b>Construction.</b> Two form travelers were used to construct cantilever arms about the pier tables until the full span was finally connected at midspan; casting cycle duration for a single segment was 7 days. The contractor implemented major constructabilit...|$|R

Traffic counts on both bridges were also depressed due to the effects of the Great Depression and World War II.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} {{bridge is}} of post-tensioned concrete. It has nine spans {{with a total}} length of 660 metres (2,165.4 ft). The deck width is 28.8 metres (94.5 ft).

50|$|Bracing struts {{and wires}} of many kinds were {{extensively}} used in early aircraft to stiffen and strengthen, {{and sometimes even}} to form, the main functional airframe. Throughout the 1920s and 1930s they fell out of use in favour of the low-drag <b>cantilever</b> <b>construction.</b> Most aircraft bracing struts are principally loaded in compression, with wires taking the tension loads. Lift struts came into increasing use during the changeover period and remain in use on smaller aircraft today where ultimate performance is not an issue. Typically they are applied to a high-wing monoplane and act in tension during flight.|$|R

50|$|Ultimately, a cast-in-place {{segmental}} concrete box girder design was decided on. The piers were tapered to echo the pinched-waist {{appearance of the}} old trestle next to it. Construction began in late 2005. Environmental considerations required that no more than 0.2 acre of the protected wetland below the bridge be disturbed during construction, and half that area be permanently disturbed for the bridge piers. The bridge was therefore built from the top down, using a balanced <b>cantilever</b> <b>construction</b> method. To allow concrete construction to continue through the winter, the contractor insulated the forms and ran glycol-filled pipes along their exteriors.|$|R
