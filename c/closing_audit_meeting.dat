40|$|OBJECTIVE: Description of the {{implementation}} of local <b>audit</b> <b>meetings</b> and the identified substandard factors, points of special interest, actions for improvement and {{the opinion of the}} participating health care providers. DESIGN: Descriptive study. METHOD: A new organisation and methodology for perinatal mortality <b>audit</b> <b>meetings</b> was introduced in 15 collaborative structures {{in the northern part of}} the Netherlands in the period September 2007 to March 2010. During these multidisciplinary <b>audit</b> <b>meetings,</b> cases of perinatal mortality selected by the obstetric collaborative group were discussed in a structured way under the direction of an independent chairman. RESULTS: In total 64 <b>audit</b> <b>meetings</b> were held, in which 677 perinatal health care providers took part at least once, and 112 cases of perinatal death were evaluated. 163 substandard factors were identified. These included : not following the protocol, guideline, standard (31 %) or usual care (23 %) and insufficient documentation (28 %) and communication between health care providers (13 %). 442 actions to improve care were reported divided over: 'external collaboration' (15 %), 'internal collaboration' (17 %), 'practice management' (26 %) and 'training and education' (10 %). The most valued aspects of the <b>audit</b> <b>meetings</b> were: their multidisciplinary character, the collaborative search for substandard factors, their security, the learning effect and the positive effect on collaboration. CONCLUSION: Cases of perinatal mortality were discussed in all 15 perinatal collaborative structures in the northern part of the Netherlands. Substandard factors were indentified, but further analysis of these factors merits attention. The participants concluded that the multidisciplinary approach and the collaboration during the <b>audit</b> <b>meetings</b> improved the cooperation between perinatal health care provider...|$|R

Data were entered into a database and summary statistics presented quarterly at <b>audit</b> <b>meetings.</b> Assessment by improvement in questionnaire scores and by interviewing physicians. SETTING [...] 1 District general hospital. PARTICIPANTS [...] About 40 consultant physicians, senior registrars, and junior staff dealing with 140 inpatient records. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES [...] Median scores (range 1 to 9) for each item in the questionnaire; two sets of notes were discussed monthly at "general" <b>audit</b> <b>meetings</b> and clinical management of selected common conditions at separate monthly meetings. RESULTS [...] A significant overall increase in median scores for questions on record keeping occurred after the start of the audit (p less than 0. 01), but interobserver variation was high. The parallel <b>audit</b> <b>meetings</b> on clinical management proved to be more successful than the general audits in auditing medical care and were also considered to be more useful by junior staff. CONCLUSIONS AND ACTION [...] Medical audit apparently resulted in appreciable improvements in aspects of care such as clerking and record keeping.

The empirical evidence is provided by a sample of Italian listed companies. Negative binomial regression is used in the multivariate analysis to test the relationships. Robustness checks provide further empirical support.
