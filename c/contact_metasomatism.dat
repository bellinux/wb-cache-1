5000|$|Karlite is a {{relatively}} newly discovered borate mineral occurring in clinohumite-chlorite marble in calcsilicate-carbonate lenses embedded in amphibolite. The amphibole at the original locale is situated between tectonic units “Zentralgneis” and “Schieferhulle”. Scholars assume that the high boron concentration needed {{for the formation of}} karlite is due to a <b>contact</b> <b>metasomatism</b> created by Hercynian tonalitic magmas, which make up the “Zentralgneis", although the boron content of karlite is not of commercial importance. [...] This mineral was originally discovered in the Furtschaglkar near the Furtschaglhaus in Austria, but has also been found in Russia and France, and was probably formed during the alpine metamorphism of the Alps.|$|E

In this {{classification}} minerals of the kaolin group formed directly from hydrothermal solutions, along with sulphides, sulphates, and pneumatogenic minerals, are separated from the same minerals formed by the hydrothermal-metasomatic ac ion of gases and vapours on aluminosilicate rocks. Some data oll the occurrence of these two types in Azerbaijan are recorded. The origin of the bentonitic clays ("gilabi") of Azerbaljan is also discussed; the geology of the deposits indicates cycles of volcanic activity and long-range transport of volcanic ash. Some twenty to thirty years ago researches in the U. S. S.

Gypsum and anhydrite from the Neogene of the central Jordan valley associated with basalt bodies in the Menahamiya area contain abundant euhedral magnetite and diopside crystals and rarer grossular. The original calcareous shales above the gypsum were transformed into hydrogrossular cemented by secondary calcite and gypsum. The mineralization {{is assumed to be}} due to low-temperature, high water-pressure m taso-matic activity similar to the process of rodingization. The described occurrence is unusual in that the hydro-thermal solutions may have been partly formed in situ by thermal dehydration of the gypsum. In a nearby locality, Tel Shaharit, he mineralization occurred in a calcareous environment producing thomsonite, natrolite, and hydrogrossular. THE Neogene section of the Jordan valley south of the Sea of Galilee, Israel, displays a suc-cession of clastic, calcareous, and, in places, evaporitic (gypsum and anhydrite) rocks. The whole section is characterized by thick basalt flows. In one of the gypsum outcrops, the 'Menahamiya Quarry ' (fig. I), an unusual occurrence of euhedral magnetite crystals was foun...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT) Very high {{temperature}} (> 900 °C) <b>contact</b> metamorphism and <b>metasomatism</b> of aluminous schist xenoliths in the mafic to ultramafic Cortlandt Complex, New York, resulted in formation of bodies of unusual Fe- and Al-oxide-rich rock called emery. During contact heating, disequilibrium thermal decomposition of the protolith schists in one closely examined xenolith produced two end-member materials: a quartzo-feldspathic water-undersaturated melt which partitioned {{much of the}} silica and calcium {{and all of the}} alkalis of the original schist; and a highly aluminous fine-grained emery residuum which contained spinel, magnetite, ilmenohematite, sillimanite, and sporadically corundum. During cooling, melt within the xenoliths was injected as cm-scale veinlets into the silica-poor solid residuum. Local increase in silica activity resulted in progressive silication reactions of spinel-rich residuum to several silicates. A simple model of progressive silication would require that reactions should occur from lower to higher silica content of product silicates in stages, e. g., spinel sapphirine (Si/O= 0. 10), sapphirine garnet (0. 25), garnet orthopyroxene (0. 28), rather than directly from spinel to higher-silic...|$|R
40|$|The {{properties}} of the earth's core are overviewed with emphasis on seismologically determined regions and pressures and seismologically measured density, elastic wave velocities, and gravitational acceleration. Attention is given to solid-state convection of the inner core, and {{it is noted that}} though seismological results do not conclusively prove that the inner core is convective, the occurrence and magnitude of seismic anisotropy are explained by the effects of solid-state convection. Igneous petrology and geochemistry of the inner core, a layer {{at the base of the}} mantle and <b>contact</b> <b>metasomatism</b> at the core-mantle boundary, and evolution of the core-mantle system are discussed. It is pointed out that high-pressure melting experiments indicate that the temperature of the core is ranging from 4500 to 6500 K, and a major implication of such high temperature is that the tectonics and convection of the mantle, as well as the resulting geological processes observed at the surface, are powered by heat from the core. As a result of the high temperatures, along with the compositional contrast between silicates and iron alloy, the core-mantle boundary is considered to be most chemically active region of the earth...|$|E
40|$|The Redstone Archean volcanic-hosted nickel {{sulphide}} deposit {{is located on}} the southern flank of the Shaw dome, near Timmins, Ontario, and is hosted within steeply dipping, southwest-facing dacitic ash flows and tuff of the Deloro or Lower volcanic Supergroup, and overlain by komatiitic flows with spinifex tops of the Tisdale or Upper volcanic Supergroup. A stratabound massive layer of Fe-Ni-Cu sulphides is spatially enclosed by a sequence of metasomatically-derived rocks at the komatiitic/dacitic tuff contact, is flanked by sulphide iron formation, and is locally underlain by Mn-garnet-stilpnomelane rock.;Contact metasomatic rocks consisting of talc, calcicamphibole, chloritite and biotite are developed along komatiitic/dacitic tuff contacts and represent progressive stages of <b>contact</b> <b>metasomatism</b> of both dacitic and komatiitic volcanic rocks by extensive, probably deuteric seafloor, hydrothermal processes. Chloritite caps the {{nickel sulphide}} layer along altered contacts between komatiitic flows and dacitic tuff, and was derived by metasomatic assimilation, involving leaching of SiO(, 2) and introduction of MgO and FeO, assuming relative immobility of Al, Ti, Zr and Y, during serpentinization and talc-carbonate alteration of the adjacent komatiitic rock.;Mn garnet-stilpnomelane rock represents a mixture of volcaniclastic tuff plus chemical precipitate. The Al-Ti-Zr-V-P had a volcaniclastic origin, most of the Fe-Mn-Mg-Ca-Co-Y-Rb were chemically precipitated, whereas Cr, Ni, Sr, Na, Nb, Ba and K have been leached from the dacitic tuff precursor. Y {{appears to have been a}} highly mobile constituent here, perhaps due to its preferential partitioning into Mn garnet.;The juxtaposition of the chloritite member overlying the stratabound nickel sulphide lens implies that the sulphides were emplaced prior to the overlapping komatiitic rocks, probably as a chemical sedimentary layer. The spatial association of sulphide and silicate-facies iron formation with the deposit, mineral and metal zoning within the nickel sulphide layer, and carbonate-enveloped nickel sulphide blebs disseminated in dacitic tuff are all indicative of a volcanic-exhalative origin for the Redstone deposit...|$|E
40|$|The Zhijiazhuang skarn iron deposit is in Laiyuan County, Hebei Province and is {{now being}} mined in open pit. Biotite granite, {{porphyritic}} granite, alaskite and diorite porphyry are discovered in the sampl but only biotite granite {{is closely related to}} the mineralization. The altered wall rock is dolomite interbeded with chert stripes of the Mid-Peroterozoic Gaoyuzhuang Formation. Along with the emplacement of biotite granite the dolomite was thermally metamorphosed to dolomic marble, forsterite marble and periclase marble. The intrusive rocks underwent albitization. Four stages of <b>contact</b> <b>metasomatism</b> are noted. In the first stage, biorite granite was altered to calcic skarn which consisted mainly of diopsidic pyroxene, andradite and trace schorlomite, seyrigite, while the marbles were replaced by diopside, forsterite and minor spinel which comprised the magnesian skarn. The Th of inclusions in andrdite is > 540 degree C; diopside in calcic skarn 450 - 520 degree C; diopside in magnesian skarn 370 - 420 degree C. During retrograde alteration, the calcic skarn was replaced by epidote with minor tremolite phlogopite, chlorite and serpentine. In magnesian skarn, chondrodite replaced forsterite, fine grained diopside and minor tremolite replaced diopside, then they all were replaced by phlogopite, chlorite and serpentine. Magnetite began to deposit after the formation of phlogopite and before serpentinization mainly in exoskarn, followed by the deposition of ludwigite which was replaced later by szaibelyite. The decrepitation temperature f magnetite is 345 degree C; afterwards minor serpentine, calcite, chlorite and pyrrhotite, pyrite, chalcopyrite, galena, sphalerite were precipitated in the sulfide stage. Most of the sulfides were found in magnesian skarn adjacent to endoskarn. The Th of fluid inclusions in calcite of this stage is 250 - 300 degree C. In the final carbonate stage, minor calcite and aragonite filled in fissures, apophyllite grew in vugs or replaced early minerals, and brucite replaced periclase. The size of exoskarn is much larger than that of endoskarn. Roughly the skarns are zoned with respect to diopside/andradite ratio in calcic skarn, diopside/serpentine ration in magnesian skarn, the intensity of retrograde alteration and ore petrography. According to chemical composition of inclusions in diopside, the physiochemical conditions of the fluids are inferred: salinity 51. 01 % NaCleq proximal, 47. 87 % NaCleq distal; pressure 23 MPa; fO 2 about 10 - 23 Pa; pH 7. 58...|$|E
40|$|Hibonite was {{discovered}} in light-colored, Ca-Al-Ti-rich and Si-Fe-poor, achondritic inclusions of the Leoville and Allende HL-group chondrites. Two varieties of hibonite occur: one emits a bright red-orange luminescence under electron bombardment and has high amounts of Al 2 O 3 (87. 7; 87. 9) and low amounts of MgO (0. 65; 0. 8) and TiO 2 (0. 68; 0. 8). The other emits a bright blue luminescence and is low in Al 2 O 3 (78. 7; 79. 2) and high in MgO (3. 3; 3. 7) and TiO 2 (6. 5; 7. 9) (in wt. %). The oxide CaO {{is about the same}} in both varieties. It is suggested that the change in the color of the visible luminescence results from changes in composition. The origin of hibonite which occurs in complex mineral assemblages together with anorthite, gelhenite, wollastonite, aluminous diopside, andradite, Ca-pyroxene, perovskite, spinel, taenite, chromite, and pentlandite, and in close proximity to nodules containing calcite, whewellite, forsterite and many of the aforementioned phases, is discussed. The proposition that hibonite and associated phases originated by <b>contact</b> metamorphism and <b>metasomatism</b> of calcite-dolomite bearing assemblages cannot, at this time, be completely ruled out...|$|R
40|$|The Platreef is a Ni-Cu-PGE mineralised tabular body at {{the base}} of the Rustenburg Layered Suite in the {{northern}} limb of the Bushveld Complex. The reef lies unconformably on a footwall (floor) sequence of Transvaal Supergroup sedimentary rocks and Archaean granite/gneiss basement, and is overlain by a hangingwall (roof) of Main Zone gabbronorites. Structural relationships suggest that the Platreef was emplaced as a broadly horizontal sill-like sheet into the Transvaal Supergroup, but local variations in its thickness and path of intrusion were caused by pre-existing structures in the country rocks. As the Platreef cooled and was nearly crystallised, ductile deformation occurred, possibly as an episode in a longer event. Main Zone magma was emplaced above the deformed, nearly consolidated Platreef and eroded the uppermost portion, locally assimilating mineralised reef. The Main Zone magma also intruded into shear zones as thin dykes down through the Platreef and metasedimentary floor. Structural patterns around a prominent dome in the floor rocks suggest that regional deformation may still have been active when the earliest Main Zone layers were developing, but ceased by Upper Main Zone time. Other studies of the Platreef beyond Sandsloot have shown that its earliest Ni-Cu-PGE mineralisation was orthomagmatic, largely preserved where the floor rocks are unreactive basement granite/gneiss. However, interaction between he Platreef magma and surrounding sedimentary rocks has produced different mineralogical associations and assemblages that were influenced by the local floor and roof rocks along the strike of the reef. At Sandsloot, the floor rocks are represented by reactive siliceous dolomites of the Malmani Subgroup. The Platreef magma caused <b>contact</b> metamorphism and <b>metasomatism</b> of the dolomites, releasing volatiles that entered the reef. These hydrothermal fluids stripped PGE from primary sulphides and redistributed the PGE within the reef and into the metasedimentary country rocks.

40|$|As one of {{the most}} {{valuable}} gemstones, emeralds are known to occur in several countries of the world, such as Colombia, Zambia, Brazil, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Russia, Madagascar and Zimbabwe. The emerald deposits at Sandawana, Zimbabwe, are described, the emeralds from this deposit characterised and a model of emerald formation presented; this is compared with existing models. The emeralds from Sandawana, Zimbabwe, show relatively constant physical properties, with high refractive indices and specific gravities. They are characterized by laths and fibres of amphibole, both actinolite and cummingtonite. Other common inclusions are albite and apatite. Rare, opaque and chromium-rich inclusions constitute a new variety of ilmenorutile. Compared to emeralds from most other localities, fl uid inclusions are rare and small. Sandawana emeralds have very high contents of chromium, sodium, magnesium, lithium and caesium. They can be readily separated from emeralds from most other localities by using traditional gem testing techniques, {{on the basis of a}} combination of physical properties, inclusions and chemistry. In cases of possible doubt, such as in comparison with emeralds from Rajasthan (India), the use of oxygen isotopes is helpful. Sandawana emeralds occur at the contact between greenstones of the Mweza Greenstone Belt (MGB) and pegmatite intrusions. Rare-element granitic pegmatites intruded the MGB just prior to and/or during a main deformation event at 2. 6 Ga, at the southern border of the Zimbabwe craton. Subsequently, a late-stage Na-rich ‘solution-melt’ containing F, P, Li, Be and Cr was injected along shear zones, causing albitisation of the pegmatite and phlogopitization in the greenstone wall-rock. Coeval ductile deformation is indicated by boudinage, pinch-and-swell and folding of pegmatites, by differentiated layering in associated amphibole-phlogopite schist and by the presence of (micro) shear zones. The synkinematic growth of not only phlogopite, but also emerald, fl uorapatite, holmquistite and chromian ilmenorutile, indicates enrichment of Na, K, Li, Be, F, P, Rb, Cs, Ta and Nb in the emerald-bearing shear zone. This suggests that emerald formation is closely related to syntectonic K-Na metasomatism. In this process, microcline, oligoclase, quartz (from the pegmatite) and chlorite (from the greenstones) were consumed, in favour of albite (in the pegmatite), phlogopite, some new actinolite and cummingtonite, holmquistite, fl uorapatite and emerald (at the contact and in the greenstone). Mass balance calculations indicate that a Na- and F-rich hydrous fl uid must have been involved in the alterations that ultimately caused emerald formation. The presence of small, isolated, highly saline brine inclusions in emerald supports this result. Formation of gem-quality emerald occurred in relatively low-pressure domains, such as ‘traps’ under folded pegmatite or pinch areas near pegmatites with pinch-and-swell or boudin structures. Apatite-phlogopite thermometry gives T = 560 - 650 °C, interpreted as the temperature range at which emerald was formed. These temperatures imply contact metamorphic rather than regional metamorphic conditions. From the general conditions of primary consolidation of rare element pegmatites, and from the inferred crystallisation path of the similar Bikita pegmatite, a corresponding pressure of around 2. 5 - 3 kbar appears plausible at Sandawana. Because of the intimate spatial and temporal relationship with magmatic activity, the pegmatitic/hydrothermal nature of the involved fl uid, and the near magmatic temperatures of phlogopite and apatite formation, a magmatic source for the Na-rich fl uids is very likely. It means that intrusion of the pegmatites, and subsequent albitisation and metasomatism during deformation, have been part of a continuous process in a restricted period of time. The Sandawana data lead to a new model of emerald formation, as a product of <b>contact</b> <b>metasomatism</b> at the border of ultramafic rocks and rare-element pegmatites during a deformation event, involving late stage magmatic/hydrothermal activity channelled by shearing. Hence, Sandawana emeralds were formed in the Late Archaean, around 2. 6 Ga, at the border of a major Late Archaean suture zone. As a consequence, they are by far the oldest, compared to other commercially available emeralds. 40 Ar/ 39 Ar dates, varying from 1900 to 2400 Ma, are interpreted as Archaean ages that became partially to completely reset during a Proterozoic thermal overprint. The Sandawana model for emerald genesis does not fit into any of the genetic classification schemes proposed in the literature, and shows that no single theory can be applied to all schist-type deposits. Emeralds of gem quality can be formed in very different geological settings, as long as basic conditions are fulfilled. In this respect, the following factors are essential: availability of beryllium and chromium (± vanadium); means of transport to bring the elements together, that is, fl uids of magmatic, hydrothermal, metamorphic or a combined origin; conditions in which emerald may form as a stable mineral, with temperatures generally from 600 ° down to 300 °C; and sufficient space to grow transparent and well-formed crystals...|$|E
