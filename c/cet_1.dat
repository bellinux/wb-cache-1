In yeast, the capping enzyme is recruited to the RNA polymerase II (Pol II) transcription complex via an interaction between Ceg 1 and the phosphorylated carboxy-terminal domain of the Pol II largest subunit. Previous in vitro experiments showed that the <b>Cet</b> <b>1</b> carboxy-terminal region (amino acids 265 to 549) carries RNA triphosphatase activity, while the region containing amino acids 205 to 265 of <b>Cet</b> <b>1</b> has two functions: it mediates dimerization with Ceg 1, but it also allosterically activates Ceg 1 guanylyltransferase activity {{in the context of}} Pol II binding.

40|$|In 2010 the Basel Committee {{finalised}} {{the global}} framework called Basel III, {{which will have}} a significant impact on the global banking sector. A large part of the framework focuses on capital adequacy, where the Common Equity Tier 1 (<b>CET</b> <b>1)</b> ratio is essential. Through an analysis of four banks from the United Kingdom – HSBC, Barclays, Lloyds Banking Group and Standard Chartered – this thesis aim to examine how these banks have adjusted to the new <b>CET</b> <b>1</b> requirements. In the EU the Basel III framework will be implemented through the capital requirements directive (CRD IV), and in 2012 our sample banks estimated their <b>CET</b> <b>1</b> ratios assuming fully implemented CRD IV. We project the <b>CET</b> <b>1</b> ratios for previous years and find that they have increased this ratio, especially from 2006. This thesis shows that adjustments have been made in both the numerator (<b>CET</b> <b>1)</b> and the denominator, risk weighted assets (RWA). <b>CET</b> <b>1</b> has strengthened due to better quality and increased quantity of equity. However, the main driver behind the increase in the ratios has been a reduction of risk weighted assets. In general, the average riskiness of asset portfolios has been reduced through management actions on the balance sheet. We also find that the impact of Basel III on our sample banks is heterogeneous because of banks’ differences regarding business structures and international exposure. The banks will also face different <b>CET</b> <b>1</b> requirements after the transitional period.

The interaction of <b>Cet</b> <b>1</b> with Ceg 1 elicits > 10 -fold stimulation of the guanylyltransferase activity of Ceg 1. This stimulation is the result of increased affinity for the GTP substrate. A truncated protein, <b>Cet</b> <b>1</b> (201 - 549), has RNA triphosphatase activity, heterodimerizes with and stimulates Ceg 1 in vitro, and suffices when expressed in single copy for cell growth in vivo. The more extensively truncated derivative <b>Cet</b> <b>1</b> (246 - 549) also has RNA triphosphatase activity but fails to stimulate Ceg 1 in vitro and is lethal when expressed in single copy in vivo.

Arabidopsis transgenic plants overexpressing AtHGC 1 phenocopied the T. halophila hgc 1 - 1 mutant in seed germination on media containing NaCl and ABA.

The new shorter error trace not only decreases the time of user’s debugging process but also reduces the simulation time required to verify the bug fixes. Two algorithms <b>CET</b> <b>1</b> and CET 2 are presented to perform the task of compacting the error trace. Both algorithms first use an efficient approach to eliminate the redundant states to generate the unique states of the error trace. Then, <b>CET</b> <b>1</b> build the connected graph of these unique states by computing the reachable states by one cycle for each unique state, and then apply Dijkstra’s shortest path algorithm {{to find out the}} shortest error trace in the connected graph. Compared with <b>CET</b> <b>1,</b> CET 2 computes the reachable states by one cycle for those unique states, when they are needed in Dijkstra’s shortest path algorithm to find the shortest error trace.

40|$|Eukaryotic mRNAs are {{modified}} at the 5 ′ {{end with}} a cap structure. In fungal cells, {{the formation of the}} mRNA cap structure is catalyzed by three enzymes: triphosphatase, guanylyltransferase, and methyltransferase. Fungal capping enzymes have been proposed to be good antifungal targets because they differ significantly from their human counterparts and the genes encoding these enzymes are essential in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In the present study, Candida albicans null mutants were constructed for both the mRNA triphosphatase-encoding gene (<b>CET</b> <b>1)</b> and the mRNA methyltransferase encoding gene (CCM 1), proving that these genes are not essential in C. albicans. Heterozygous deletions were generated, but no null mutants were isolated for the guanylyltransferase-encoding gene (CGT 1), indicating that this gene probably is essential in C. albicans. Whereas these results indicate that <b>Cet</b> <b>1</b> p and Ccm 1 p are not ideal molecular targets for development of anticandidal drugs, they do raise questions about the capping of mRNA and translation initiation in this fungus. Southern blot analysis of genomic DNA indicates that there are not redundant genes for <b>CET</b> <b>1</b> and CCM 1 and analysis of mRNA cap structures indicate there are not alternative pathways compensating for the function of <b>CET</b> <b>1</b> or CCM 1 in the null mutants. Instead, it appears that C. albicans can survive with modified mRNA cap structures...|$|E
40|$|A {{characteristic}} {{feature of}} gene expression in eukaryotes is {{the addition of}} a 52 ̆ 7 terminal 7 -methylguanine 2 ̆ 2 cap 2 ̆ 2 to nascent pre-messenger RNA (mRNA) in the nucleus. It is the 52 ̆ 7 capping process, which proves vital to creating a mature mRNA. The synthesis of an mRNA followed by its capping is a complex undertaking which requires a set of protein factors. The capped mRNA is then exclusively bound by a cap-binding complex (CBC). CBC shields mRNA from exonucleases as well as regulates downstream post-transcriptional events, translational initiation and nonsense mediated mRNA decay (NMD). Any misregulation during capping or in the binding of CBC can lead a number of diseases/disorders. Thus, the process and regulation of capping and CBC binding to mRNA are important fields to study the control of gene expression. Over the years, capping apparatus and CBC have been implicated in post-transcriptional regulation. However, it is not yet known whether CBC plays any role in controlling transcriptional initiation or elongation. Thus, the major research focus in my thesis had been to analyze the role of CBC and capping enzymes in regulation of transcriptional initiation and elongation. The results have revealed the role of CBC in stimulating the formation of pre-initiation complex (PIC) at the promoter in vivo via Mot 1 p (modifier of transcription). Subsequently, we have demonstrated the roles of CBC in transcription elongation, splicing and nuclear export of mRNA. Interestingly, we find that the capping enzyme, <b>Cet</b> <b>1</b> p, decreases promoter proximal accumulation of RNA polymerase II. These results support that <b>Cet</b> <b>1</b> p promotes the release of paused-RNA polymerase II to get engaged into elongating form for productive transcription. Such function of <b>Cet</b> <b>1</b> p appears to be mediated via the Facilitates chromatin transcription (FACT) complex. We find that FACT is targeted to the active gene by the N-terminal domain of <b>Cet</b> <b>1</b> p independently of its capping activity. In the absence of <b>Cet</b> <b>1</b> p, recruitment of FACT to the active gene is impaired, leading to paused-RNA polymerase II. Collectively, the results of my thesis work provide significant insight on the regulation of gene expression by CBC and capping enzyme, <b>Cet</b> <b>1</b> p...|$|E

[Full text {{of this paper is}} not {{available}} in the UHRA]The early evolution of Earth's atmosphere and the origin of life took place at a time when physical conditions at the Earth were radically different from its present state. The radiative input from the Sun was much enhanced in the high-energy spectral domain, and in order to model early planetary atmospheres in detail, a knowledge of the solar radiative input is needed. We present an investigation of the atmospheric parameters, state of evolution, and high-energy fluxes of the nearby star ?? <b>1</b> <b>Cet,</b> previously thought to have properties resembling those of the early Sun. Atmospheric parameters were derived from the excitation/ionization equilibrium of Fe I and Fe II, profile fitting of H??, and the spectral energy distribution. The UV irradiance was derived from Far-Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer and Hubble Space Telescope data, and the absolute chromospheric flux from the H?? line core. From careful spectral analysis and the comparison of different methods, we propose for ?? <b>1</b> <b>Cet</b> the following atmospheric parameters: T eff = 5665 ?? 30 K (H?? profile and energy distribution), log g = 4. 49 ?? 0. 05 dex (evolutionary and spectroscopic), and [Fe/H] = + 0. 10 ?? 0. 05 (Fe II lines). The UV radiative properties of ?? <b>1</b> <b>Cet</b> indicate that its flux is some 35 % lower than the current Sun's between 210 and 300 nm, it matches the Sun's at 170 nm, and increases to at least 2 - 7 times higher than the Sun's between 110 and 140 nm. The use of several indicators ascribes an age to ?? <b>1</b> <b>Cet</b> in the interval ~ 0. 4 - 0. 8 Gyr and the analysis of the theoretical Hertzsprung-Russell diagram (H-R) suggests a mass ~ 1. 04 M. This star is thus a very close analog of the Sun when life arose on Earth and Mars is thought to have lost its surface bodies of liquid water. Photochemical models indicate that the enhanced UV emission leads to a significant increase in photodissociation rates compared with those commonly assumed of the early Earth. Our results show that reliable calculations of the chemical composition of early planetary atmospheres need to account for the stronger solar photodissociating UV irradiation...|$|R
