5|$|Short-period comets have orbits lasting {{less than}} two hundred years. Long-period comets have orbits lasting {{thousands}} of years. Short-period comets are thought to originate in the Kuiper belt, whereas long-period comets, such as Hale–Bopp, are thought to originate in the Oort cloud. Many <b>comet</b> <b>groups,</b> such as the Kreutz Sungrazers, formed from the breakup of a single parent. Some comets with hyperbolic orbits may originate outside the Solar System, but determining their precise orbits is difficult. Old comets that have had most of their volatiles driven out by solar warming are often categorised as asteroids.|$|R

Distant nodes of cometary {{orbits of}} Kreutz family are {{concentrated}} in a plane with ascending node 76 and inclination 267 at the distance from 2 up to 3 a. u. and in a very narrow interval of longitudes. There is a correlation dependence between q and cos I concerning the found plane (coefficient of correlation 0. 41). Similar results are received regarding to cometary families of Meyer, Kracht and Marsden. Distant nodes of these comets are concentrated close three planes (their parameters {{are discussed in the}} article) and at distances 1. 4; 0. 5; 6 a. u. accordingly.

40|$|Recent {{advances}} in distributed systems and transportable software and increasing demand for better quality-of-service (QOS) control in multiservice networks are driving a re-examination of network software architectures. We established the <b>COMET</b> <b>Group</b> (Control Management and Telemedia) at Columbia University's Center for Telecommunications Research {{to provide a}} comprehensive understanding of network software architecture of the 1990 s and beyond.

40|$|A {{satisfactory}} orbital {{solution for}} Comet Howard-Koomen-Michels 1979 XI is {{found on the}} assumption that the comet's line of apsides coincided with that of the Kreutz sungrazing <b>comet</b> <b>group.</b> The derived perihelion distance then shows that this is the first known case of a comet falling into the sun. A dust tail that survived the comet is studied as a particle flow phenomenon controlled by no force other than solar gravity and solar radiation pressure. The tail's outline is interpreted in terms of an onset of dust production, a peak repulsive force on the particles, and a circumsolar dustfree zone due to particle sublimation. It is shown that the surviving debris consisted mostly of absorbing, submicron size particles in hyperbolic trajectories convex to the sun and curving toward the earth. The tail width may be a product of the interaction of charged dust in the tail with a complicated structure of the coronal magnetic field...|$|E
40|$|There is no {{shortage}} of suggestions for the astronomical events that may have given rise to the Bible's descriptions of the Star of Bethlehem. In this account, I consider the question from a linguist's point of view, focusing on the language used to describe phenomena in the sky around 2000 years ago. What would an astrologer have meant by "we have seen his star in the East"? And what events might have been both visible in the conditions described, and considered of significance? Scholars working in this area cluster in groups: the <b>comet</b> <b>group,</b> the planetary group, the supernova group, and so on. None has yet succeeded in delivering a fatal blow to the others' accounts. I may be in a group of one for the time being: the astrological group. I present here a type of argument that may reconcile astronomical events, astrological learning of 2000 years ago and biblical accounts. © 2008 Royal Astronomical Society...|$|E
40|$|Surgery, as a {{scientific}} discipline, should be supported by research. Surgeons depend on the availability and quality of an adequate evidence base to provide best possible care. Randomised trials are often considered the best form of evidence when assessing the efficacy of an intervention. Surgical research has been derided because of the paucity of randomised trials published. Many efforts {{have been made to}} combat this crisis of credibility, including the creation of the IDEAL Collaboration, which aims to improve “the quality of research in surgery by emphasizing appropriate methods, transparency of data and rigorous reporting of outcomes”. This has occurred within the wider context of a drive to improve research standards across the medical research community, with notable examples being the EQUATOR Network, the <b>COMET</b> <b>group,</b> the STaR child health group, the Cochrane Collaboration, the James Lind Alliance and AllTrials initiative. These groups have made strong efforts to improve the design, conduct and reporting of clinical trials. These efforts aimed at improving research standards are likely to influence the surgical literature in a positive way. This thesis is presented as a thesis by publication: containing published and submitted work on the theme of trials and outcomes in surgery. The work presented in the first chapters of this thesis has striven to identify, evaluate and quantify the need for surgical research. The next chapters evaluate research methodology and standards in the surgical literature with a focus on paediatric surgery. The thesis concludes with an evaluation of the impact of research standards within a regulatory framework, from the perspective of medical devices. The overarching purpose of these studies was to promote the underlying theme of the thesis: to inform and improve research standards and outcomes within the field of surgery.
