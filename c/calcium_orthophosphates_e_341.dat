40|$|The present {{overview}} {{is intended}} to point the readers’ attention to the important subject of <b>calcium</b> <b>orthophosphates.</b> These materials are of the special significance because they represent the inorganic part of major normal (bones, teeth and dear antlers) and pathological (i. e. those appearing due to various diseases) calcified tissues of mammals. Due to a great chemical similarity with the biological calcified tissues, many <b>calcium</b> <b>orthophosphates</b> possess remarkable biocompatibility and bioactivity. Materials scientists use this property extensively to construct artificial bone grafts that are either entirely made of or only surface-coated with the biologically relevant <b>calcium</b> <b>orthophosphates.</b> For example, self-setting hydraulic cements made of <b>calcium</b> <b>orthophosphates</b> are helpful in bone repair, while titanium substitutes covered by a surface layer of <b>calcium</b> <b>orthophosphates</b> are used for hip joint endoprostheses and as tooth substitutes. Porous scaffolds made of <b>calcium</b> <b>orthophosphates</b> are very promising tools for tissue engineering applications. In addition, technical grade <b>calcium</b> <b>orthophosphates</b> are very popular mineral fertilizers. Thus ere <b>calcium</b> <b>orthophosphates</b> are of great significance for humankind and, in this paper, an overview on the current knowledge on this subject is provided...|$|R
30|$|The {{nucleation}} {{and growth}} of <b>calcium</b> <b>orthophosphate</b> coatings deposited on Ti 6 Al 4 V substrates from 5 -fold SBF were investigated in details by both atomic force and environmental scanning electron microscopes (Barrere et al. 2004). Scattered <b>calcium</b> <b>orthophosphate</b> deposits of approximately 15 [*]nm in diameter were found to appear after only 10 [*]min of immersion in 5 -fold SBF. Then, they grew up to 60 to 100 [*]nm after approximately 4 [*]h. With increasing immersion time, the packing of <b>calcium</b> <b>orthophosphate</b> deposits with size of tens of nanometers in diameter formed larger globules and then continuous <b>calcium</b> <b>orthophosphate</b> coatings on Ti 6 Al 4 V substrates. The coatings were composed of nano-sized deposits. A direct contact between <b>calcium</b> <b>orthophosphates</b> and the Ti 6 Al 4 V surface was observed (Barrere et al. 2004). A stable solution containing high concentrations of <b>calcium</b> and <b>orthophosphate</b> ions was prepared in another study (Li et al. 2002 b). This solution became supersaturated after NaHCO 3 was added. A uniform coating of approximately 40 -μm thickness was obtained on the substrate after immersion for 24 h. The coatings contained adjustable composition from CDHA to DCPD (Li et al. 2002 b).|$|R
30|$|As {{follows from}} the definition, all types of wet {{deposition}} techniques occur from either solutions or suspensions both aqueous and non-aqueous. Furthermore, all of them occur at moderate temperatures (Nijhuis et al. 2010). Depending on the solution pH, various <b>calcium</b> <b>orthophosphates</b> might be precipitated (Table[*] 1) and, therefore, be deposited as coatings, films and layers. In general, the deposition kinetics depends on the solution supersaturation, concentration of the reagents, temperature, {{presence or absence of}} admixtures, nucleators, inhibitors, etc. As to the precipitation mechanism of <b>calcium</b> <b>orthophosphates</b> from aqueous solutions, this process appears to be rather complicated; for the biologically relevant <b>calcium</b> <b>orthophosphates</b> (OCP, CDHA and HA), the crystallization process occurs via formation of one or several intermediate and/or precursor phases, such as ACP, DCPD and/or OCP. The detailed description of the precipitation mechanisms of various <b>calcium</b> <b>orthophosphates</b> {{is beyond the scope of}} current review; the interested readers are referred to the special literature on the topic (Wang and Nancollas 2008; Wang et al. 2011).|$|R
30|$|Solid {{implants}} prepared {{from various}} materials often possess a poor biocompatibility with a simultaneous {{lack of the}} osteogenic properties {{in order to promote}} bone healing. In addition, direct bone-to-implant contacts are desired for a biomechanical anchoring of implants rather than fibrous tissue encapsulation. All these problems might be solved by applying <b>calcium</b> <b>orthophosphate</b> coatings, films and layers. The aim is to provide the implants with surface biological properties for adsorption of proteins, adhesion of cells and bone apposition. Therefore, the available knowledge on <b>calcium</b> <b>orthophosphate</b> and, most notably, HA coatings, films and layers on various substrates has been summarized in this review. Since all available deposition techniques have both advantages and shortcomings of their own (Table[*] 3), still there are no standard guidelines for depositing <b>calcium</b> <b>orthophosphates</b> on the implant surfaces. In general, dissolution of <b>calcium</b> <b>orthophosphate</b> coatings, films and layers improves implant osseointegration and is the basic requirement for bioactivity. However, this dissolution diminishes the stability and increases the potential for loosening of the implants. <b>Calcium</b> <b>orthophosphate</b> coatings, films and layers of lower solubility and higher stability are desirable for the long-term performance of implants because they promote faster initial bone fixation, bridge larger gaps in the misfit and degrade at a controlled rate.|$|R
40|$|Recent {{developments}} in biomineralization have already demonstrated that nanosized particles {{play an important}} role in the formation of hard tissues of animals. Namely, the basic inorganic building blocks of bones and teeth of mammals are nanodimensional and nanocrystalline <b>calcium</b> <b>orthophosphates</b> (in the form of apatites) of a biological origin. In mammals, tens to hundreds nanocrystals of a biological apatite were found to be combined into self-assembled structures under the control of various bioorganic matrixes. In addition, the structures of both dental enamel and bones could be mimicked by an oriented aggregation of nanosized <b>calcium</b> <b>orthophosphates,</b> determined by the biomolecules. The application and prospective use of nanodimensional and nanocrystalline <b>calcium</b> <b>orthophosphates</b> for a clinical repair of damaged bones and teeth are also known. For example, a greater viability and a better proliferation of various types of cells were detected on smaller crystals of <b>calcium</b> <b>orthophosphates.</b> Thus, the nanodimensional and nanocrystalline forms of <b>calcium</b> <b>orthophosphates</b> have a great potential to revolutionize the field of hard tissue engineering starting from bone repair and augmentation to the controlled drug delivery devices. This paper reviews current state of knowledge and recent developments of this subject starting from the synthesis and characterization to biomedical and clinical applications. More to the point, this review provides possible directions of future research and development...|$|R

30|$|New {{promising}} {{techniques for}} coating medical devices are continuously investigated. Future investigations on various coating processes {{will have to}} include clinical trials to get better understanding of bone responses to coated-implant surfaces, as well as studies on coupling of <b>calcium</b> <b>orthophosphate</b> coatings, layers and films with drugs, growth factors and cells. Although it has been generally accepted that <b>calcium</b> <b>orthophosphate</b> coatings, layers and films improve bone strength and initial osteointegration rate, the optimal coating properties required to achieve maximal bone response are yet to be reported. As such, the use of well-characterized <b>calcium</b> <b>orthophosphate</b> coatings, layers and films cell culture studies, animal studies and clinical studies should be well documented to avoid controversial results.|$|R
30|$|In {{electrochemical}} deposition of <b>calcium</b> <b>orthophosphates,</b> a supersaturated or a metastable aqueous electrolyte containing <b>calcium</b> and <b>orthophosphate</b> ions is used. Various electrochemical reactions {{occurring in the}} electrolyte near electrodes induce local pH increase, and thus, <b>calcium</b> <b>orthophosphate</b> crystals are nucleated and grow on the electrodes (Manso et al. 2000; Duan et al. 2003; Lu et al. 2005). Obviously, only conductive materials might be coated by this technique. A typical setup includes a platinum electrode (anode) and a metallic implant (cathode) connected to a current generator. Since {{electrochemical deposition}} usually occurs on the negatively charged electrodes, in literature it is {{sometimes referred to as}} cathodic deposition (Zhao et al. 2003; Blackwood and Seah 2009; Roguska et al. 2011). The electrochemical reactions occurring with the ions during the deposition of <b>calcium</b> <b>orthophosphates</b> might be found in literature (Kuo and Yen 2002; Yen and Lin 2002).|$|R
40|$|In {{the late}} 1960 ’s, a strong {{interest}} was raised in biomedical applications of ceramic materials (named bioceramics a little bit later). Bioceramics was initially used as reasonable alternatives to metals {{in order to increase}} their biocompatibility. However, within a short period, it has grown into a diverse class of biomaterials, presently including three essential types: relatively bioinert, bioactive (or surface reactive) and bioresorbable bioceramics. This review is limited to bioceramics prepared from <b>calcium</b> <b>orthophosphates</b> only, which belong to the categories of bioactive and bioresorbable compounds. There {{have been a number of}} important advances in this field during the past 30 – 40 years. The research was shifted from an initial study on the develop-ment of bioinert bioceramics towards bioactive and bioresorbable bioceramics, and these different types of <b>calcium</b> <b>orthophosphate</b> bioceramics can be tuned through the structural and compositional control.

40|$|In early 1980 s, {{researchers}} discovered self-setting <b>calcium</b> <b>orthophosphate</b> cements, {{which are}} a bioactive and biodegradable grafting material {{in the form of}} a powder and a liquid. Both phases form after mixing a viscous paste that after being implanted, sets and hardens within the body as either a non-stoichiometric calcium deficient hydroxyapatite (CDHA) or brushite, sometimes blended with unreacted particles and other phases. As both CDHA and brushite are remarkably biocompartible and bioresorbable (therefore, in vivo they can be replaced with newly forming bone), <b>calcium</b> <b>orthophosphate</b> cements represent a good correction technique for non-weight-bearing bone fractures or defects and appear to be very promising materials for bone grafting applications. Besides, these cements possess an excellent osteoconductivity, molding capabilities and easy manipulation. Furthermore, reinforced cement formulations are available, which in a certain sense might be described as <b>calcium</b> <b>orthophosphate</b> concretes. The concepts established by <b>calcium</b> <b>orthophosphate</b> cement pioneers in the early 1980 s were used as a platform to initiate a new generation of bone substitute materials for commercialization. Since then, advances have been made in the composition, performance and manufacturing; several beneficial formulations have already been introduced as a result. Many other compositions are in experimental stages.

30|$|In general, <b>calcium</b> <b>orthophosphate</b> coatings, layers or films {{obtained}} by the electrochemical method have a uniform structure since they are formed gradually through a nucleation and growth process at relatively low temperatures (de Groot et al. 1998). Such coatings might be porous (Duan et al. 2003). Interestingly, {{that in order to}} produce apatite coatings, non-apatitic <b>calcium</b> <b>orthophosphates</b> might be electrochemically deposited, followed by additional treatments (Redepenning et al. 1996; Han et al. 1999 b, 2001; Kumar et al. 1999; Silva et al. 2001). Subsequently, the deposited <b>calcium</b> <b>orthophosphate</b> coatings, layers or films might be heat treated in water steam at 125 °C (Shirkhanzadeh 1993) and/or then calcined at temperatures up to 800 °C to densify and improve its bonding to the substrates.|$|R

40|$|The {{state-of-the-art}} of biocomposites and hybrid biomaterials {{based on}} <b>calcium</b> <b>orthophosphates</b> that {{are suitable for}} biomedical applications is presented in this review. Since these types of biomaterials offer many significant and exciting possibilities for hard tissue regeneration, this subject belongs to a rapidly expanding area of biomedical research. Through successful combinations of the desired properties of matrix materials with those of fillers (in such systems, <b>calcium</b> <b>orthophosphates</b> might play either role), innovative bone graft biomaterials can be designed. Various types of biocomposites and hybrid biomaterials based on <b>calcium</b> <b>orthophosphates,</b> either those already in use or being investigated for biomedical applications, are extensively discussed. Many different formulations, {{in terms of the}} material constituents, fabrication technologies, structural and bioactive properties as well as both in vitro and in vivo characteristics, have already been proposed.

The specific advantages of using biocomposites and hybrid biomaterials based on <b>calcium</b> <b>orthophosphates</b> in the selected applications are highlighted.

30|$|<b>Calcium</b> <b>orthophosphate</b> coatings, {{films and}} layers may {{also lead to}} {{increased}} polyethylene wear from the acetabular cup and, thereby, alleviate the problem of osteolysis.|$|R
30|$|However, {{application}} of various inter-layers (synonym: buffer layers) {{seems to be}} the most important way to influence the adhesion strength of <b>calcium</b> <b>orthophosphate</b> coatings, films and layers to diverse substrates. A big number of the available deposition techniques (see ‘Preparation’ section above), which should be multiplied to a big selection of various substrates, result in a great number of potentially appropriate chemicals to be used as inter-layers between the substrates and <b>calcium</b> <b>orthophosphates.</b> For example, for plasma-assisted deposition methods of <b>calcium</b> <b>orthophosphates,</b> such chemicals as TiO 2 (Rajesh et al. 2011), TiN (Nelea et al. 2000; Yang et al. 2009 b, 2009 c; Man et al. 2009), ZrO 2 (Nelea et al. 2000) or Al 2 O 3 (Nelea et al. 2000), were used as buffer layers. TiO 2 (Nelea et al. 2007; Berezhnaya et al. 2010) and TiN (Nelea et al. 2003) were also used as under-layers for RF magnetron sputtering. Similarly, formation of intermediate layers of titanium hydroxides is required for biomimetic deposition of <b>calcium</b> <b>orthophosphates</b> on Ti (Wang et al. 2008 a). To complicate things even further, one should mention, that mutual inter-diffusion of atoms, ions and molecules of <b>calcium</b> <b>orthophosphates</b> from coatings, films and layers from one side and those of a substrate from another side might occur. Especially, this is valid for high temperature deposition techniques; however, the mutual inter-diffusion might happen for any technique at the post-deposition annealing stage (see section[*]‘Brief knowledge on the important pre- and post-deposition procedures’). Various atomic mixed inter-layers are formed as the result. For example, the width (measured by Auger electron spectroscopy) of such inter-layer between a HA coating and magnesium substrate formed by IBAD technique was found to be approximately 3 [*]μm (Yang et al. 2008). Such inter-layers can reduce the mismatch of thermal expansion coefficients between <b>calcium</b> <b>orthophosphates</b> and substrates, or increase the surface area of the material, wettability or heat conductivity; thus, increasing the bonding strength without affecting biocompatibility. Since the subject of inter-layers appears to be very broad, additional details are not specified further.|$|R
30|$|Several {{studies have}} already {{demonstrated}} that cyclic loading of the coated samples leads to fatigue failure. Further, {{it has been}} shown that a combination of an aqueous environment with stress can result in delamination or accelerated dissolution of <b>calcium</b> <b>orthophosphate</b> coatings, which can influence the long-term stability of the implants (Kummer and Jaffe 1992; Reis et al. 1994; Wolke et al. 1997). For example, <b>calcium</b> <b>orthophosphate</b> coatings were RF magnetron sputtered on Ti- 6 Al- 4 [*]V bars and, afterwards, some of them were annealed at 650 °C to convert ACP into crystalline structure. Then, the coated samples were mechanically tested in either dry or wet (SBF solution) conditions (Wolke et al. 1997). The results of SEM demonstrated that, after cyclic loading conditions in air, the bars coated by crystalline <b>calcium</b> <b>orthophosphates</b> showed a partial coating loss. Furthermore, in wet conditions only the heat-treated sputter-coated bars appeared to be stable. On the other hand, the ACP coatings showed signs of delamination in more stressed regions only (Wolke et al. 1997). Thus, the fatigue properties of amorphous and crystalline <b>calcium</b> <b>orthophosphate</b> coatings, films and layers are different. Furthermore, the fatigue behavior shows substantial differences when tested in either dry or wet/conditions.|$|R
30|$|A {{study by}} Cairns et al. (2010) should be {{described}} especially. <b>Calcium</b> <b>orthophosphate</b> thin films were deposited onto substrates with varying topography. Then, {{a layer of}} fibronectin was deposited from solution onto each surface, and the response of MG 63 osteoblast-like cells was studied. The results revealed that, in all cases, {{the presence of the}} adsorbed fibronectin layer improved cell adhesion, proliferation and promoted early onset differentiation. Moreover, the nature and scale of the response appeared to be influenced by the surface topography of the substrates. Specifically, cells on the fibronectin-coated <b>calcium</b> <b>orthophosphate</b> thin films with regular topographical features in the nanometer range showed statistically significant differences in focal adhesion assembly, osteocalcin expression and alkaline phosphase activity compared to the <b>calcium</b> <b>orthophosphate</b> films without those topographical features (Cairns et al. 2010). Therefore, both an adsorbed bioorganics and a surface topography of the substrates appear to influence cell adhesion and differentiation.|$|R
30|$|Depending on the {{deposition}} technique, {{the thickness of}} the <b>calcium</b> <b>orthophosphate</b> coatings, films and layers varies from nanometric dimensions to several millimeters (Table[*] 3), and this parameter appears to be very important, namely, if <b>calcium</b> <b>orthophosphate</b> coatings, films and layers are too thick, they are easy to break. Furthermore, the outer layers might tend to detach from the inner ones. On the contrary, if <b>calcium</b> <b>orthophosphate</b> coatings, films and layers are too thin, they are easy to dissolve because resorbability of HA, which is the second least soluble among <b>calcium</b> <b>orthophosphates</b> (Table[*] 1), is about 15 to 30 [*]μm per year under the physiological conditions (Gineste et al. 1999). To complicate the situation, the failure mechanisms for thinner and thicker coatings, films and layers appear to be different, namely the failure mode of thinner (50 μm) HA coatings on a Ti alloy was found to be conclusively at or near the coating/bone interface, while that of thicker (200 μm) HA coatings was found to be at the coating/bone interface, inside the HA lamellar splat layer, {{as well as at the}} coating/Ti alloy substrate interface (Wang et al. 1993; Yang et al. 1997). A similar conclusion was made in another study, in which the mechanical behavior of thin (0.1, 1 and 4 [*]μm) <b>calcium</b> <b>orthophosphate</b> coatings was compared (Vercaigne et al. 2000 a). Considering these points, commercial plasma-sprayed HA coatings, films and layers have thicknesses between 50 and 200 μm (Sun et al. 2001), though cells and tissues interact with only top surface, and thus, thickness of approximately 10 [*]nm would be sufficient for cell activity.|$|R
3000|$|Nevertheless, {{one must}} stress that {{although}} many experiments concerning the in vivo studies of <b>calcium</b> <b>orthophosphate</b> coatings, films and layers have indicated a stronger and faster fixation, {{as well as}} more bone ingrowth at the interface, the clinical performance of such coatings, films and layers is still far from the perfection. Some of the major concerns associated with the usage of <b>calcium</b> <b>orthophosphate</b> coatings, films and layers in actual body environment, with regard to their long-term stability can be listed as follows (Hulshoff et al. 1996 a; Caulier et al. 1997 a, 1997 b): [...]...|$|R

The investigations presented therein are meant to reduce this input by looking for the ways of rendering impurities harmless. Soluble acid orthophosphates are the main harmful impurity of phosphogypsum. The studies show that dry insoluble <b>calcium</b> <b>orthophosphates</b> hydrates (1. 09 % and 2. 18 % P 2 O 5 in gypsum) have little effect on W/C, setting times and soundness of Portland cement pastes. Insoluble <b>calcium</b> <b>orthophosphates</b> hydrates {CaHPO 4 ∙ 2 H 2 O, Ca 8 (HPO 4) 2 (PO 4) 4 ∙ 5 H 2 O and Ca 9 (HPO 4) (PO 4) 5 (OH) ∙ 4 H 2 O} formed in acidic medium (pH = 4. 2 - 5. 9) have been destroyed in alkaline medium and reduce standard compressive strength of cement up to 28 %. <b>Calcium</b> <b>orthophosphates</b> hydrates of hydroxyapatite group are stable in alcaline medium, while in dry state they reduce the standard compressive strength of cement until 10 %, but their suspensions prolong setting times of Portland cement as soluble orthophosphates – 2 - 3 times.

30|$|According to this technique, <b>calcium</b> <b>orthophosphate</b> coatings, layers or {{films are}} {{prepared}} by dipping the sample in calcium (usually, nitrate salt) and phosphorus (usually, alkyl phosphates) gels for {{an appropriate time}} at low reaction temperatures. As-formed coatings, layers or films are porous, less dense and have poor adhesion to the substrate. To improve their properties, the samples are annealed at temperatures of 400 °C to 1, 000 °C (Gross et al. 1998 c; Haddow et al. 1999; Montenero et al. 2000; Tkalcec et al. 2001; Liu et al. 2002 b; Metikoš-Huković et al. 2003; Kim et al. 2004 a; Gan and Pilliar 2004; Zhang et al. 2006; Stoica et al. 2008). Depending upon the temperature, different <b>calcium</b> <b>orthophosphate</b> compounds are obtained. The resulting coatings, layers or films can be extremely dense and adhere strongly to the underlying substrate (de Groot et al. 1998). Occasionally, {{in order to improve}} the bond strength between the coating and the substrate, an intervening layer of another compound might be applied prior the sol-gel deposition of a <b>calcium</b> <b>orthophosphate</b> (Kim et al. 2004 b).|$|R

30|$|Matrix {{assisted}} {{pulsed laser}} evaporation technique was developed {{as an alternative}} to PLD for delicate and accurate deposition of <b>calcium</b> <b>orthophosphate</b> films, coatings and layers combined with organic and/or biologic materials. The examples include deposition calcium orthophosphate-based biocomposites with sodium maleate (Negroiu et al. 2008), alendronate (Bigi et al. 2009) and silk fibroin (Miroiu et al. 2010). Thermally unstable <b>calcium</b> <b>orthophosphates,</b> such as OCP (Boanini et al. 2012), might be deposited as well. This technique provides a more gentle mechanism for transferring different compounds, including large molecular weight species, and it is expected to ensure an improved stoichiometric transfer, a more accurate thickness control and a higher uniformity of the coatings.|$|R
30|$|In vivo results {{correlate}} {{well with}} the in vitro ones. Osseointegration rates of porous-surfaced Ti 6 Al 4 V implants with control (unmodified sintered coatings) were compared to porous-surfaced implants modified through the addition of either an inorganic or organic route sol-gel-formed <b>calcium</b> <b>orthophosphate</b> films. Implants were placed in distal femoral rabbit condyle sites and, following a 9 -day healing period, implant fixation strength was evaluated using a pullout test. Both types of <b>calcium</b> <b>orthophosphate</b> films significantly enhanced the early rate of bone in-growth and fixation as evidenced by higher pullout force and interface stiffness compared with controls. However, {{there was no significant}} difference between calcium orthophosphate-coated implants prepared using the two different methods (Gan et al. 2004).|$|R

The in vitro trials using different cell lines revealed that {{in the vast majority}} of the cases, <b>calcium</b> <b>orthophosphate</b> coatings, films and layers enhanced cellular adhesion, proliferation and differentiation, while the results of the in vivo studies revealed that they promoted bone regeneration. For example, a combination of surface geometry and <b>calcium</b> <b>orthophosphate</b> coatings was found to benefit the implant-bone response during the healing phase (Hayakawa et al. 2002). <b>Calcium</b> <b>orthophosphate</b> coatings on titanium implants followed by bisphosphonate-immobilization appeared to be effective in the promotion of osteogenesis on surfaces of dental implants (Yoshinari et al. 2002). A greater percent of bone contact lengths were detected for calcium orthophosphate-coated Ti implants compared with control Ti implants 3 and 12 [*]weeks after implant placement (Ong et al. 2002). Similar results were obtained in other studies (Dalton and Cook 1995; Nguyen et al. 2004; Yan et al. 2006).|$|R
30|$|Bio{{degradation}} (synonyms: {{biotic degradation}} or biotic decomposition) is a chemical dissolution of materials by bacteria and/or other biological means. Since chemical {{composition of the}} body fluids might be considered as constancy, biodegradation of <b>calcium</b> <b>orthophosphate</b> coatings, films and layers {{is controlled by the}} properties of <b>calcium</b> <b>orthophosphates</b> themselves, which include their chemical composition, Ca/P ratio, crystal structure, crystallinity, porosity, lattice defects, particle sizes and purity (de Groot et al. 1998). For example, the dissolution kinetics of HA layers was studied using the dual constant composition method, and dissolution rates decreased when HA crystallinity increased (Tucker et al. 1996). Similar results were obtained in another study: after implantation, HA coatings with crystallinity of approximately 55 % were found to degrade faster and possess better osteoinductivity than those with crystallinity of approximately 98 % (Xue et al. 2005). Although biodegradation supposed to be in vivo process, various in vitro simulations are widely investigated. However, to be closer to the in vivo conditions, the biological assessments of <b>calcium</b> <b>orthophosphate</b> coatings, films and layers are performed in various simulating solutions, such as SBF (Kim et al. 2010; Chen et al. 2009 b; Verestiuc et al. 2004; van der Wal et al. 2005, 2006; Heimann 2009; Łatka et al. 2010; d’Haese et al. 2010; Ntsoane et al. 2011), HBSS (Ueda et al. 2007; Man et al. 2009; Luo et al. 2000), aqueous saline solution (Surmenev et al. 2010; Ueda et al. 2009), Ringer’s solution (Gross and Berndt 1994; Gross et al. 1997), phosphate buffered saline (PBS) (Ueda et al. 2007; Boyd et al. 2006; Coelho et al. 2009 a), Eagle’s minimum essential medium (Lim et al. 2005). Since the simulating solutions often contain dissolved ions of <b>calcium</b> and <b>orthophosphates,</b> both partial dissolution of <b>calcium</b> <b>orthophosphate</b> coatings, films and layers and their re-crystallization occurred (Verestiuc et al. 2004; Heimann 2009; d’Haese et al. 2010; Ntsoane et al. 2011; Lim et al. 2005). For example, as written in the abstract of d'Haese et al. (2010), ‘The soaking in SBF homogenizes the morphology of coatings. The sintered zone disappears, and the pores get filled by the reprecipitated calcium phosphates.’ One should stress that, due to the presence of other ions in the chemical composition of the aforementioned simulating solutions, {{in the vast majority of}} the cases not chemically pure but ion-substituted <b>calcium</b> <b>orthophosphates</b> are precipitated.|$|R
30|$|To {{conclude}} this section, {{one must}} note the following: Even though {{the importance and}} the need for development of <b>calcium</b> <b>orthophosphate</b> coatings, films and layers have been recognized, it is still mostly being explored on research level, and after extensive search of open literature, these coatings appear to have made limited headway into commercialization. In spite of mention of the commercial products such as hip and dental implants produced by Zimmer Orthopedics (Freiburg, Germany), Smith and Nephew (Memphis, TN, USA), and Biomet, the science and technology related to their manufacturing is not disclosed by any one of them due to the proprietary reasons. Hence, at this point it is difficult to bring a detailed discussion on commercialization of <b>calcium</b> <b>orthophosphate</b> coatings, films and layers (Paital and Dahotre 2009 a).|$|R
30|$|By {{means of}} a MAO technique, <b>calcium</b> <b>orthophosphate</b> coatings, films and layers have been {{prepared}} on various metals (Song et al. 2004; Liu et al. 2005; Sun et al. 2007; Wei et al. 2007; Han et al. 2008). For example, MAO was performed on titanium in an electrolyte containing calcium glycerophosphate and calcium acetate using a direct current power supply. The MAO technique appeared to be suitable to form porous and rough ceramic coatings containing Ca and P. Then, the coatings were hydrothermally treated in aqueous solutions with pH within 7.0 to 11.0 (adjusted by adding NaOH) at 190 °C for 10 [*]h in an autoclave. This procedure converted undisclosed <b>calcium</b> <b>orthophosphates</b> into CDHA and/or HA crystals, while the amount of precipitated HA increased with solution pH increasing (Liu et al. 2005).|$|R
30|$|Typically, {{during the}} deposition, a target should be rotated {{to achieve a}} stable {{ablation}} rate. As PLD is usually carried out at high substrate temperatures, a thin oxide layer might be formed on the substrate surface prior to the deposition of <b>calcium</b> <b>orthophosphates</b> and, thereby, it influences its adherence to the substrate (Nelea et al. 2000). The deposited coatings, layers and films frequently consist of several <b>calcium</b> <b>orthophosphates</b> (often with admixtures of other substances, such as CaO, calcium pyrophosphates, etc.) and might contain both amorphous and crystalline phases (Cleries et al. 2000 a; Koch et al. 1990). Biphasic formulations, such as HA[*]+[*]TTCP (Kim et al. 2005 b), might be deposited as well. Interestingly, TTCP in the coatings was not formed by partial conversion of previously deposited HA. Instead, it was produced by nucleation and growth of TTCP itself from the ablation products of the HA target or by accretion of TTCP grains formed during ablation (Kim et al. 2005 b). Furthermore, the PLD-deposited coatings, films and layers might consist of <b>calcium</b> <b>orthophosphates</b> with different morphologies (e.g., granular and columnar), which have different resistance values to delamination (Cleries et al. 2000 a). More to the point, various types of oriented textures might be created as well (Kim et al. 2005 a, 2007 a, 2010). A modification known as ‘transmission laser coating’ has been introduced (Cheng and Ye 2010).|$|R
30|$|On {{the other}} hand, {{there are cases}} (Gineste et al. 1999; de Bruijn et al. 1994; Cleries et al. 2000 b), in which the {{biodegradation}} kinetics of <b>calcium</b> <b>orthophosphate</b> coatings, films and layers appeared to be correlated imperfectly with their solubility values (see Table[*] 1). For example, three types of <b>calcium</b> <b>orthophosphate</b> (HA, ACP and β-TCP) coatings on titanium alloy substrates, deposited by the laser ablation technique, were immersed in SBF {{in order to determine}} their behavior in conditions similar to the human blood plasma. Neither HA nor ACP coatings were found to dissolve in SBF, while a β-TCP coating slightly dissolved. Precipitation of an apatitic phase was favored onto both HA and β-TCP coatings; however, no precipitation occurred onto ACP coating (Cleries et al. 2000 b). Additionally, degradation rates of dental implants with 50 - and 100 -micron thick coatings of HA, FA and fluorhydroxylapatite (FHA) were studied (Gineste et al. 1999). The implants were inserted in dog jaws and retrieved for histological analysis after 3, 6, and 12 [*]months. The thickness of the <b>calcium</b> <b>orthophosphate</b> coatings was evaluated using an image analysis device. HA and FA coatings (even at 100 -micron thickness) were almost totally degraded within the implantation period. In contrast, the FHA coatings did not show significant degradation during the same period (Gineste et al. 1999).|$|R
30|$|Since electrophoretic {{deposition}} {{is designed to}} apply materials to any electrically conductive surface, {{it is used to}} achieve <b>calcium</b> <b>orthophosphate</b> coatings, layers or films on various metallic substrates only (Ducheyne et al. 1986, 1990; Zhitomirsky and Gal-Or 1997; Han et al. 1999 a; Zhitomirsky 2000; Wei et al. 2001; Stoch et al. 2001; Wang et al. 2002; de Sena et al. 2002; Ma et al. 2003 a; Mondragón-Cortez and Vargas-Gutiérrez 2004; Meng et al. 2006, 2008). This approach is especially useful for porous metallic structures. To create coatings, layers or films, <b>calcium</b> <b>orthophosphate</b> powders are suspended in water or other suitable liquids to produce a coating bath, followed by deposition onto a metallic surface. The proper dimensions of the particles to be deposited are very important because the particles must be fine enough to remain in suspension during the coating process. Electrophoretic deposition normally involves submerging a metallic substrate into a container or vessel, which holds the coating bath, and applying direct current electricity using electrodes, where the substrate is one of the electrodes (anode or cathode). An applied electric field is the driving force of the deposition (Besra and Liu 2007). Depending on the mode and sequence of voltage applied, {{electrophoretic deposition}} of <b>calcium</b> <b>orthophosphates</b> can be carried out at either constant (Meng et al. 2006) or dynamic (Meng et al. 2008) voltage.|$|R
30|$|<b>Calcium</b> <b>orthophosphate</b> {{coatings}} {{of various}} thickness ranging from 170 [*]nm up to 1.5 [*]μm were obtained {{depending upon the}} deposition times (Fernandez-Pradas et al. 2001). The coating morphology {{was found to be}} grain-like particles and droplets. During growth, the grain-like particles grew in size, partially masking the droplets, and a columnar structure was developed. The thinnest (170 [*]nm) coating consisted mainly of ACP. The coating of approximately 350 -nm thick also contained HA, whereas even thicker coatings contained some α-TCP in addition to HA. All coatings failed under the scratch test by spalling from the diamond tip; however, the failure load increased as thickness decreased until only plastic deformation and cohesive failure for the thinnest coating was observed (Fernandez-Pradas et al. 2001). Therefore, both the structure and the phase composition of <b>calcium</b> <b>orthophosphate</b> coatings, films and layers might depend on their thickness.|$|R
40|$|Calcium {{phosphate}} ceramics {{are widely}} used as coating materials to orthopedic implants and are found to enhance initial bony ingrowth by stimulating osseous apposition to the implant surface. In this study, two novel <b>calcium</b> <b>orthophosphate</b> materials were selected for coating onto the commonly used orthopedic implant material Ti- 6 Al- 4 V. One was <b>calcium</b> alkali <b>orthophosphate</b> with the crystalline phase Ca 10 [K/Na](PO 4) 7 with a small addition of SiO 2 (AW-Si) {{and the other was}} <b>calcium</b> <b>orthophosphate</b> composed of 70 mol % fluorapatite, Ca 10 (PO 4) 6 F 2 and 30 mol % CaZr 4 (PO 4) 6 (FA 7 Z). The coated implants were placed in cortical and cortico-cancellous bone of sheep femur for six weeks. Retrieved samples were tested for osseointegration and mechanical strength. It was found that both coatings produced enhanced bone/implant contact rate compared to the control when implanted in cortico-cancellous bone. This study demonstrates that the two coatings have the capability of encouraging bone growth, and hence the potential for being used as coating materials on Ti implants. Chaoyuan Wang, Gross A.
