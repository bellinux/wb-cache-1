40|$|Alcohol {{consumption}} {{among young}} adults is widely accepted in modern society {{and may be}} {{the starting point for}} abusive use of alcohol at later stages of life. Chronic alcohol exposure can lead to visual function impairment. In the present study, we investigated the spatial luminance contrast sensitivity, colour arrangement ability, and colour discrimination thresholds on young adults that weekly consume alcoholic beverages without clinical concerns. Twenty-four young adults were evaluated by an ophthalmologist and performed three psychophysical tests to evaluate their vision functions. We estimated the spatial luminance contrast sensitivity function at 11 spatial frequencies ranging from 0. 1 to 30 cycles/degree. No difference in contrast sensitivity was observed comparing alcohol consumers and control subjects. For the evaluation of colour vision, we used the Farnsworth-Munsell 100 hue test (FM 100 test) to test subject's ability to perform a colour arrangement task and the Mollon-Reffin test (MR test) to measure subject's colour discrimination thresholds. Alcohol consumers made more mistakes than controls in the FM 100 test, and their mistakes were diffusely distributed in the FM colour space without any <b>colour</b> <b>axis</b> preference. Alcohol consumers also performed worse than controls in the MR test and had higher colour discrimination thresholds compared to controls around three different reference points of a perceptually homogeneous colour space, the CIE 1976 chromaticity diagram. There was no <b>colour</b> <b>axis</b> preference in the threshold elevation observed among alcoholic subjects. Young adult weekly alcohol consumers showed subclinical colour vision losses with preservation of spatial luminance contrast sensitivity. Adolescence and young adult age are periods of important neurological development and alcohol exposure during this period of life might be responsible for deficits in visual functions, especially colour vision that is very sensitive to neurotoxicants...|$|E

40|$|We {{report on}} {{experiments}} in which observers judged colour appearance {{within the context}} of time-varying colour adaptation. We used pairs of contextual images consisting of a rapid succession of colour surfaces reproduced under different illuminants to analyse the effect of temporal colour adaptation rather than a spatial context on asymmetric matching and also to judge its influence upon the cone excitation components. We used adaptation colour distributions along the red-green and yellow-blue axes (selective conditions) and random colour distributions (non-selective condition). The results of observers ' matches for both conditions showed approximate colour-constant appearance. Although light adaptation did not fully compensate the colour changes, we obtained average colour-constancy index values of 0. 6. The results for the two opponent conditions showed similar contextual effects. No significant differences between each condition were found for the L- and S-cone mechanisms and the three test illuminants. On the contrary, some degree of interaction between the comparison-field cone excitations and the <b>colour</b> <b>axis</b> can be seen when the colour mechanisms are analysed separately. This seems to be more pronounced for the S-cone mechanism and suggests that the selective condition of the adaptation sequence may well affect the observer's chromatic matching response...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND [...] Previous {{studies have}} shown that ophthalmologists using blue-green argon laser may suffer subtle defects in their colour vision. A {{reduction}} in colour contrast sensitivity in the tritan <b>colour</b> confusion <b>axis,</b> an early manifestation of blue cone photoreceptor injury by the high energy photons of the laser, has been demonstrated and has prompted a reappraisal of laser safety in ophthalmology. Argon laser is also frequently used in scientific research, often at higher power output and for longer periods than is used in clinical practice. The scientists operating these lasers are at risk of developing similar phototoxic retinal injury. METHODS [...] The colour contrast sensitivity of 18 scientists who regularly use short wavelength argon laser was investigated. RESULTS [...] Eye protection was infrequently used and individuals had been subjected to between 580 and 7200 hours of cumulative laser exposure during the course of their research. CONCLUSION [...] The use of blue-green argon laser by the scientists investigated was not associated with a significant reduction in colour contrast sensitivity...|$|R

Colours {{distributions}} {{have been}} studied in 12 S 0 galaxies, most of these nearly edge-on, from high reso-lution frames obtained at the CFHT and the Pic du Midi 2 m telescope, supplemented for some purposes by low res-olution frames from the Observatoire de Haute Provence 120 cm telescope. Great {{attention has been given}} to reduce the eects of seeing", resulting from dierent PSF’s in the two frames needed for a colour measurement. Errors from various sources, and their eect upon measured quanti-ties, have been evaluated from the study of pseudo-colours (obtained by applying our measuring techniques to pair of frames taken in the same passband), and from the com-parison of colours data from our various series. Data are given about the following topics: Radial isophotal colour proles, leading to reference colours at re and gradients in 4 colour indices (except for missing data); Reference colours and gradients in possibly dustless re-gions of nearly pure bulge or disk, allowing a comparison between the two components; Dust patterns, seen in 7 objects; Systematic dierences between major and minor <b>axis</b> <b>colours</b> upon isophotal contours (outside dust patterns). Both a redder or bluer major axis are encountered de-pending upon the object, or the central distance in a given object.

40|$|Refraction {{simulators}} {{used for}} undergraduate training at Aston University did not realistically reflect {{variations in the}} relationship between vision and ametropia. This was because they used an algorithm, taken from the research literature, that strictly only applied to myopes or older hyperopes and did not factor in age and pupil diameter. The aim {{of this study was to}} generate new algorithms that overcame these limitations. Clinical data were collected from the healthy right eyes of 873 white subjects aged between 20 and 70 years. Vision and refractive error were recorded along with age and pupil diameter. Re-examination of 34 subjects enabled the calculation of coefficients of repeatability. The study population was slightly biased towards females and included many contact lens wearers. Sex and contact lens wear were, therefore, recorded in order to determine whether these might influence the findings. In addition, iris <b>colour</b> and cylinder <b>axis</b> orientation were recorded as these might also be influential. A novel Blur Sensitivity Ratio (BSR) was derived by dividing vision (expressed as minimum angle of resolution) by refractive error (expressed as a scalar vector, U). Alteration of the scalar vector, to account for additional vision reduction due to oblique cylinder axes, was not found to be useful. Decision tree analysis showed that sex, contact lens wear, iris <b>colour</b> and cylinder <b>axis</b> orientation did not influence the BSR. The following algorithms arose from two stepwise multiple linear regressions: BSR (myopes) = 1. 13 + (0. 24 x pupil diameter) + (0. 14 x U) BSR (hyperopes) = (0. 11 x pupil diameter) + (0. 03 x age) - 0. 22 These algorithms together accounted for 84 % of the observed variance. They showed that pupil diameter influenced vision in both forms of ametropia. They also showed the age-related decline in the ability to accommodate in order to overcome reduced vision in hyperopia...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: Several {{studies have}} shown {{deterioration}} in colour vision at altitudes above 3, 000 m. These {{studies have been conducted}} in photopic (bright daylight) conditions, whereas many military operations take place in mesopic (dim light) conditions. Data suggests that the tritan <b>colour</b> vision <b>axis</b> (blue cones, TA) are more susceptible to hypoxic insult than protan axis (red cones, PA). The objective {{of this study was to}} examine colour vision at high altitude, in mesopic conditions, and using a novel method of assessment to discriminate between the tritan and protan axis. Methods: We examined 42 eyes (21 subjects, mean age 44, range 22 - 71), at sea level and within 12 - 36 hours of exposure to 3300 m. This was done in a darkened room, with refractive error correction. Colour vision was studied using ChromaTestTM, a software programme that analyzes colour contrast threshold (CCT) of both TA and PA. We planned to repeat CCT measurement at 4, 392 m, but technology failure prevented this. Non-parametric paired data was examined using the Wilcoxon signed rank test. Results: There was found to be no change to either the PA (p= 0. 409) or the TA (p= 0. 871) upon ascent. Within the PA 16 eyes had a lower CCT at high altitude, whilst 26 were higher. In the TA 20 eyes had a lower CCT and 22 were higher. At sea level, mean CCT for PA was 4. 21 (SD 2. 29) TA was 7. 06 (SD 1. 77). At 3, 300 m mean CCT for PA was 4. 36 (SD 2. 86) and TA was 6. 93 (SD 2. 39). Conclusions: This experiment revealed no changes to colour vision with exposure to 3, 300 m. This may be below the threshold altitude for cone dysfunction, alternatively colour vision deterioration may be less significant in mesopic conditions...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{construction}} of state {{trajectory of the}} cell {{is not a simple}} task. It must be decided what are the state variables. Since we work with coloured images, it sounds logical to start with the trajectory in RGB <b>colour</b> space. Each <b>axis</b> is then processed via several Rényi entropies. The value of Rényi coefficient spread or collapsed the trajectory along the axis of the state space. Each combination of Rényi coefficients gives us one subtraction of the whole trajectory. The major issue is how to choose the proper combination. However, all subtractions are correct. The single cell trajectory should be divided into several clusters, once the trajectory is constructed. Each cluster of the trajectory represents an event or subset of the states of the cell. Size and position of clusters depends on the trajectory and on number of clusters. We proposed eight clusters now as a first estimation, satisfied by the results: Clusters are well separated; images in transitions between clusters show some changes. Changes are also observable in images at the borders of the clusters. If we compare content of the clusters in different trajectories some images stay in the same cluster but some images may change the cluster. This is caused by the method of acquisition of the trajectory. The different coefficient in the Rényi equation highlights different part of the image so the trajectory can be little bit different as well as size, position and content of clusters...|$|R

We analyse colours of the nuclear regions of intermediate redshift disk galaxies, {{with the aim of}} obtaining empirical information of relative ages of bulges and disks at 0. 1 <z< 1. 3. Methods. We work with an apparent-diameter limited parent sample of 248 galaxies from the HST Groth Strip Survey. We apply a conservative criterion to identify bulges and potential precursors of present-day bulges based on nuclear surface brightness excess above the exponential profile of the outer parts and select a sample of 56 galaxies with measurable bulges. We measure bulge colours on wedge profiles opening on the semi-minor axis least affected by dust in the disk, and compare them to disk, and global galaxy colours. Results. For 60 % of galaxies with bulges, the rest-frame nuclear colour distribution shows a red sequence that is well fit by passive evolution models of various ages, while the remainder 40 % scatters towards bluer colours. In contrast, galaxies without central brightness excess show typical colours of star forming population and lack a red sequence. We also see that, as in the local Universe, most of the minor <b>axis</b> <b>colour</b> profiles are negative (bluer outward), and fairly gentle, indicating that nuclear colours are not distinctly different from disk colours.

40|$|Background: To compare 4 psychophysical {{colour vision}} tests in {{children}} and to decide which test is most suitable for screening in pre-school and early school-age period. Methods: The first test used was a modified Ishihara plates test (Handaya Co. Ltd., Tokyo). The second test ”Colour vision testing made easy” (CVTME) (T. L. Waggoner, 1994) is also based on pseudoisochromatic plates with child-friendly symbols. The third test used was the ”Neitz test of colour vision” (WPS, 2001) and the fourth was ”Mollon-Reffin Minimalist test” (MRM) (version 0. 7, 1994). In the first three tests, the child had to tell {{what he or she}} saw in the picture, whereas in the fourth test the child had to pick the coloured button among distractors. Thirty-seven children (19 girls and 18 boys) from 3 – 9 years of age with normal colour vision (at least one test should be performed without errors) were tested. The number of errors in each of the first 3 tests was registered, whereas in the MRM test the least saturated button distinguished among distractors was registered. Specificity was calculated for each test. Every child was also asked which was his or her favourite test. Results: 16 / 37 children made one or more errors in the modified Ishihara test, among them all {{children under the age of}} 5 years. Nine children made 1 error, three made 2, two made 3 and two children made 5 errors. 8 / 37 children made 1 – 3 mistakes in the CVTME test. Four children made one mistake, three made two and one child made three mistakes. All tested children made at least one mistake in the Neitz test. All gave a wrong description for the figure in the 6 th position of the test. Two 3 -year-old girls were not able to perform the test. The MRM test was not performed in full by 10 / 37 children. Most of these children made errors in the tritan <b>colour</b> vision <b>axis.</b> The highest specificity in all 3 age groups was calculated for CVTME test and MRM test. 28 / 37 children chose the MRM test as their favourite. Conclusions: The modified Ishihara colour test has turned out to be too difficult and therefore unreliable in the youngest children. For children under 5 years of age CVTME was more reliable in this study. For all ages the MRM test was the easiest to perform. Most children in this study subjectively preferred the MRM test...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} {{a novel approach}} {{to the problem of}} determining head pose estimation and face 3 D orientation of several people in low resolution sequences from multiple calibrated cameras. Spatial redundancy is exploited and the head in the scene is approximated by an ellipsoid. Skin patches from each detected head are located in each camera view. Data fusion is performed by back-projecting skin patches from single images onto the estimated 3 D head model, thus providing a synthetic reconstruction of the head appearance. A particle filter is employed to perform the estimation of the head pan angle of the person under study. A likelihood function based on the face appearance is introduced. Experimental results proving the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm are provided for the SmartRoom scenario of the CLEAR Evaluation 2007 Head Orientation dataset. 1 Video Head Pose Estimation This section {{presents a}} new approach to multi-camera head pose estimation from low-resolution images based on Particle Filtering (PF) [1]. A spatial and color analysis of these input images is performed and redundancy among cameras is exploited to produce a synthetic reconstruction of the head of the person. This informationis used to construct the likelihood function that will weight the particles of this PF based on visual information. The estimation of the head orientation will be computed as the expectation of the pan angle thus producing a real valued output. For a given frame in the video sequence, a set of N images are obtained from the N cameras. Each camera is modeled using a pinhole camera model based on perspective projection. Accurate calibration information is available. Bounding boxes describing the head of a person in multiple views are used to segment the interest area where the colour module will be applied. Center and size of the bounding box allow defining an ellipsoid model H = {c,R,s} where c is the center, R the rotation along each axis centered on c and s the length of each <b>axis.</b> <b>Colour</b> information is processed as described in the following subsection...|$|R

40|$|I {{present a}} {{detailed}} study of two Magellanic Irregular galaxies, NGC 4214 and NGC 1156. With relatively high star formation rates and plenty of neutral gas, they are interesting laboratories in which to study the organisational processes that lead to star formation. These galaxies have masses in the ransition region between dwarf irregular and spiral galaxies, and are close analogues of the Large Magellanic Cloud, so it is of interest make detailed observations for later comparative studies. The neutral Hydrogen observations are the highest angular resolution available to date for these galaxies (800 FWHM), with fine velocity resolution (1. 3 km. s‾¹). These show remarkable structure in both objects, including large holes and small clouds of gas (107 Mסּ) with moderate velocity offsets from the general rotation. An large, incompletely evacuated hole (2. 2 kpc diameter) dominates the western half of NGC 1156. Its origin is unclear. The velocity fields of both galaxies show most of the disk is rotating smoothly, but near the centre appear to have significant noncircular motions, probably induced by a stellar bar. Échelle spectroscopy at Hα shows the HII regions are following the same orbits as the neutral gas. The galaxies 2 ̆ 7 optical structure and stellar populations are characterised through multicolour imaging, Hα emission-line imaging and densely-spaced longslit spectra. NGC 4214 exhibits two exponential components in its surface brightness profile, while NGC 1156 {{is consistent with a}} single exponential. In both objects the major axis of the bright bar lies along quite a dfferent position angle to the kinematic major <b>axis.</b> <b>Colour</b> maps reveal varied populations in the bright bars of both galaxies, and the outer disk of NGC 4214. I make detailed comparisons of the galaxies 2 ̆ 7 colour-colour distribution with stellar population models, and employ absorption-line indices from the longslit spectra as cross-checks in a few locations. Taken together the data suggest that over a large fraction of the galaxies there is a young population some tens of Myr old that contributes a few percent of the total stellar mass, though the particular combination of mass fraction and age cannot be uniquely determined. Neither galaxy exhibits strong O/H abundance variations within the bright bar region. Both galaxies are consistent with a model in which a minimum HI surface density (10 ²¹atom. cm‾²) is a necessary criterion for star formation. In NGC 1156 the radial distribution of star-forming regions is well predicted by the disk instability criterion discussed by Kennicutt (1989), while the criterion is less successful in NGC 4214. In a systematic survey of NGC 4214 I identifed 13 holes likely to be expanding or burst shells, roughly in accord with the number expected given the linear resolution and the HII-region population. In a majority of the holes, a star cluster capable of powering the expansion is visible within the hole boundary. However the holes are so young and that I expected all would contain a detectable cluster. In a few regions new star formation appears to have occurred in the walls of the identified holes, but the total number of HII regions near HI holes is consistent with that expected by chance...|$|R
