The mean strain was measured by two strain gauges, opposite each other halfway up the specimen, parallel to the vertical axis. The specimens were tested, and maintained within the defined curing state, within 1  h after removal from the mold. The transverse strain was determined by an unbonded extensometer, with an accuracy of 0.5  μm, that measured changes in diameter at the mid-height of the specimen.

40|$|Abstract. In this work, {{effects of}} {{compressive}} {{stress on the}} ferroelectric properties of 0. 7 PMN– 0. 3 PT ceramics were investigated. The ceramics with the formula (0. 7) Pb(Mg 1 / 3 Nb 2 / 3) O 3 -(0. 3) PbTiO were prepared by a conventional mixed-oxide method. The ferroelectric properties under compressive stress were observed at stress up to 80 MPa using a <b>compressometer</b> {{in conjunction with a}} modified Sawyer-Tower circuit. The results showed that applied stress had a significant influence on the ferroelectric properties of 0. 7 PMN– 0. 3 PT ceramics. Ferroelectric characteristics, i. e. the area of the ferroelectric hysteresis (P-E) loop, the saturation polarization (Psat), the remanent polarization (Pr) and loop squareness (Rsq), decreased with increasing compressive stress, while the coercive field (Ec) remained relatively constant. Stress-induced domain wall motion suppression and non- 180 oC ferroelectric domain switching processes are responsible for the changes observed...|$|E

40|$|In this study, {{effects of}} {{uniaxial}} {{stress on the}} dielectric properties of ceramics in PMN-PZT system were investigated. The ceramics with a formula (1 -x) Pb(Mg 1 / 3 Nb 2 / 3) O 3 -(x) Pb(Zr 0. 52 Ti 0. 48) O 3 or (1 -x) PMN-(x) PZT when x = 0. 0 0. 3 0. 5 0. 7 and 1. 0 were prepared by a conventional mixed-oxide method. Phase formation behavior of these ceramics was studied by an X-ray diffraction (XRD) method. In addition, other physical properties, e. g. firing shrinkage and density, were measured. The dielectric properties under the uniaxial stress of the poled PMN-PZT ceramics were observed at low and high-stress levels using a uniaxial <b>compressometer.</b> It was found that at low stress level (0 - 800 kPa) {{there was no significant}} change in the dielectric constant and the dielectric loss tangent with the applied stress. As the stress level was raised higher (0 - 5 MPa), changes of the dielectric constant with the applied stress were dependent on the ceramic compositions. On the other hand, changes of the dielectric loss tangent with the applied stress were independent of the ceramic compositions...|$|E
40|$|It is {{necessary}} to quantify the thermal insulation and evaporative resistance properties of clothing systems so that the heat exchange between {{the body and the}} environment can be determined and a person's performance in that environment can be predicted using biophysical models. This paper reviews the physical methods for directly measuring resistance data on fabrics and clothing ensembles and discusses problems associated with different techniques. In addition, methods for estimating the resistance values for clothing from different fabric and clothing properties will be mentioned. FABRICS The resistance to dry heat transfer (i. e., insulation) can be measured using the rate of cooling method, the constant temperature method (e. g., guarded hot plate), and heat flow meter. Flat plate instruments or cylinders have been used, with each type having advantages and disadvantages over the other. Fabric insulation can be estimated from thickness, so the <b>compressometer,</b> micrometer, and pendulum methods will be discussed. The evaporative resistance of fabrics can be measured using a sweating hot plate device or cylinder. A liquid barrier of known resistance is needed to keep the fabric dry during the test. Measurements can be made with and without a temperature gradient between the hot body and the environment. Other methods for measuring the diffusion of water vapor through a fabric include the ASTM control dish method and the Canadian DND apparatus. [1 - 10...|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1965 Twelve Acrilan acrylic, twelve Orlon acrylic, {{and twelve}} wool {{blankets}} were studied {{to determine the}} effect of laundering on thermal insulation value. The thirty-six blankets used in this study were selected and purchased by Florence Petzel for use {{in the study of the}} effects of maintenance on wool and acrylic blankets. Specified sections of each of the blankets were laundered zero, one, five or ten times using a soak wash method. Cutting diagrams were then developed for each blanket section. Seven hundred twenty warmth tests specimens, each measuring five inches square, were prepared at the time of Petzel's study. They were kept under constant temperature before the testing began and throughout the testing procedures. The laboratory tests included a thickness reading on the <b>Compressometer</b> and a warmth determination using the Cenco-Fitch instrument. The data from the warmth study is discussed in two parts. The thickness measurements and thermal conductivity values for each laundry interval are noted first. This is followed by a discussion of the significance of the relationship of thickness to warmth. The findings show a loss in the thickness of the Orlon acrylic and Acrilan acrylic blankets during laundering caused by matting and/or a loss of fibers. Conversely, the wool blankets gained continuously in thickness due to shrinkage. The thickest blankets had the lowest thermal conductivity values and were the best insulators; the thinnest blankets had the largest thermal conductivity values and had the least insulation value. This emphasizes the importance of the retention of thickness for the maintenance of warmth. There was not a significant difference in the amount of heat that was transmitted by the Orlon acrylic, Acrilan acrylic or wool blankets. This implies that warmth is dependent upon the thickness of a blanket and the retention of that thickness rather than upon the fiber content. An increase in insulation value was generally followed by a decrease in insulation value if the blanket lost thickness. The insulation value improved if the blanket shrank and became more compact. However, there is a point at which compactness is detrimental to warmth because of the reduction of vital air spaces. It was concluded that the warmth of a blanket is controlled by the thickness of the blanket and its ability to retain that thickness with laundering. It was further concluded that a thickness reading which is interpreted along with data on dimensional stability, yarn count, weight, and breaking strength would be sufficient to predict warmth for consumer purposes and information. It was recommended that subjective testing with individuals be included in future evaluations for more meaningful information. The best guide for the selection of a blanket still appears to be the brand name of a reputable manufacturer and a business firm to which the blanket may be returned if its performance is not satisfactory. One could expect to find warm blankets made from any fiber material provided the blanket is suitably woven and sufficiently thick...|$|E
