40|$|In {{this paper}} we examine {{subjective}} aspects of social reproduction in two countries: Finland and Scotland. Our aims are twofold. The {{first is to}} examine the extent to which individual actors are able to meaningfully negotiate opportunity structures through contrasting the future orientations of young people in two different societies. The central question here relates {{to the extent to which}} individual subjectivities are conditioned by social locations rather than being shaped through a process of exploration and negotiation. Second, as the two countries have different systems of education, vocational training and <b>careers</b> <b>counselling,</b> we wanted to determine the extent to which institutional arrangements shape subjective orientations. In America, the widely tested Wisconsin model of status attainment (which is used to measure social mobility and includes indicators of socio-economic background and educational attainment as well as aspirations) has highlighted the significance of the relationship between subjective processes and labour market outcomes (Sewell and Hauser, 1993), but we have little knowledge of the ways in which subjective orientations are affected by institutional arrangements and models of <b>careers</b> <b>counselling.</b> Sinisalo (1993), however, has argued that across different cultures there are strong similarities in vocational interests. If institutional structures and models of <b>careers</b> <b>counselling</b> are significant, then given the differences in the educational systems of Finland and Scotland, we would expect to find strong variations in the aspirations of young people. If, on the other hand, the aspirations of young people in the two countries are very similar, this would suggest that these arrangements are of little significance...|$|R

40|$|The {{partners}} {{that make}} up the Canadian Labour Force Development Board (CLFDB), which are business, labour, education/training and the employment equity groups, have traditionally viewed <b>career</b> and employment <b>counselling</b> as important. However, information on the avail-ability of <b>career</b> and employment <b>counselling</b> services across Canada has been lacking. There is also little evaluative information to demonstrate the contribution of counselling in helping people make the transition from school to work or unemployment to employment. A survey of <b>career</b> and employment <b>counselling</b> conducted under the sponsorship of the CLFDB showed that little counselling evaluation is being done in the schools, colleges, universities, within community agencies or the Canada Employment Centres. The absence of evaluative informa-tion places the service at risk of being discontinued. Those in leadership positions have to be convinced of the need for more and better evaluation of counselling. A new model or models for the evaluation of <b>career</b> and employment <b>counselling</b> is needed, as are new measurement instruments. Résum...|$|R

An important contribution of <b>careers</b> <b>counselling</b> is to enable clients to recognise tacit beliefs and assumptions that limit the effectiveness of their careers thinking. In the process, this often involves finding problems. This paper outlines how an archetypal problem finding technique - Socratic inquiry - can be adapted and applied in this particular context. Socratic inquiry can enable identification of social scripts which are a source of limiting assumptions. It can also enable cross-examination of these assumptions, and enhance the facility for internal dialogue...|$|R
