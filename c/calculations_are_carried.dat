There are several different forms of parallel computing: bit-level, instruction level, data, and task parallelism. Parallelism has been employed for many years, mainly in high-performance computing, but interest in it has grown lately due to the physical constraints preventing frequency scaling. As power consumption (and consequently heat generation) by computers has become a concern in recent years, parallel computing has become the dominant paradigm in computer architecture, mainly in the form of multi-core processors.|$|E

50|$|Bombsights are {{sighting}} {{devices that}} are pointed {{in a particular}} direction, or aimed. Although the solution outlined above returns a point in space, simple trigonometry {{can be used to}} convert this point into an angle relative to the ground. The bombsight is then set to indicate that angle. The bombs are dropped when the target passes through the sights. The distance between the aircraft and target at that moment is the range, so this angle {{is often referred to as}} the range angle, although dropping angle, aiming angle, bombing angle and similar terms are often used as well. In practice, some or all of these <b>calculations</b> <b>are</b> <b>carried</b> out using angles and not points in space, skipping the final conversion.|$|E
5000|$|A {{computer}} number {{format is}} the internal representation of numeric values in digital computer and calculator hardware and software. [...] Normally, numeric values are stored as groupings of bits, {{named for the}} number of bits that compose them. The encoding between numerical values and bit patterns is chosen for convenience of the operation of the computer; the bit format used by the computer's instruction set generally requires conversion for external use such as printing and display. Different types of processors may have different internal representations of numerical values. Different conventions are used for integer and real numbers. Most <b>calculations</b> <b>are</b> <b>carried</b> out with number formats that fit into a processor register, but some software systems allow representation of arbitrarily large numbers using multiple words of memory.|$|E
50|$|By 1928, {{the idea}} of a {{molecular}} orbital had been advanced by Robert Mulliken, who was influenced considerably by the work of Friedrich Hund. The LCAO method for approximating molecular orbitals was introduced in 1928 by B. N. Finklestein and G. E. Horowitz, while the LCAO method for solids was developed by Felix Bloch, as part of his doctoral dissertation in 1928, concurrently with and independent of the LCAO-MO approach. A much simpler interpolation scheme for approximating the electronic band structure, especially for the d-bands of transition metals, is the parameterized tight-binding method conceived in 1954 by John Clarke Slater and George Fred Koster, sometimes referred to as the SK tight-binding method. With the SK tight-binding method, electronic band structure calculations on a solid need not be carried out with full rigor as in the original Bloch's theorem but, rather, first-principles <b>calculations</b> <b>are</b> <b>carried</b> out only at high-symmetry points and the band structure is interpolated over the remainder of the Brillouin zone between these points.|$|E
