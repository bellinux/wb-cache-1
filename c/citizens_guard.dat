He frequently intervened with occupation authorities, asking them for release of Polish activists. After one of such interventions, in August 1942, Władysław Studnicki was freed.

50|$|National media {{attention}} to this sequence of events was facilitated {{through the efforts of}} Pasadena Heritage executive director Claire Bogaard. Articles appeared in the Los Angeles Times, Washington Post and New York Times. Pasadena enacted an emergency ordinance, known as the Blacker Ordinance, which attempted to limit the ability of people owning homes designed by Greene and Greene to dismantle or otherwise destroy artifacts therein. Although not a direct prohibition, the ordinance delayed for up to one year any changes or alterations, subject to review of a committee of the Planning Commission. Conservation-minded <b>citizens</b> <b>guarded</b> the Blacker house day and night to keep further fixtures from being removed.|$|R
50|$|It {{is found}} {{as a symbol}} in medieval sources among other things {{representing}} St. Olav. This flower {{has been used as}} a symbol of the city at least since the 16th century. It is earliest preserved in the seal of the church chapter of Trondheim used in the 16th century. In the 17th century it was used on a green field in the banner of the <b>citizen</b> <b>guard</b> of the city. It has also been used as a symbol of several guilds such as the masons, bakers, goldsmiths and smiths. In the 18th century the flower replaced the three heads in the seal of Trondheim. The idea of the rose as a symbol of Trondheim may originally have come into being because of a misinterpretation of the last syllable of the city's old name Nidaros.|$|R
60|$|He {{walked to}} the {{entrance}} leading into the first apartment of the temple, and then waited {{to be followed by}} Numerian, who, {{now for the first time}} separated from Ulpius, remained stationary in the position he had last occupied, and looked eagerly around him. No chance of escape presented itself; the mouth of the vault on one side, and the passage through the partition on the other, were the only outlets to the place. There was no hope but to follow the Pagan into the great hall of the temple, to keep carefully at a distance from him, and to watch the opportunity of flight through the doorway. The street, so desolate when last beheld, might now afford more evidence that it was inhabited. <b>Citizens,</b> <b>guards</b> might be passing by, and might be summoned into the temple--help might be at hand.|$|R

50|$|The first bombs felt on Warsaw {{already on}} 1 September 1939. Unfortunately, the most {{important}} representatives of civil and military administration (along with the Army’s Commander-in-Chief, Marshall Edward Rydz-Śmigły) escaped to Romania, taking with themselves much of the equipment and ammunition intended {{for the defense of}} the city. To stop the chaos, President Starzyński seized full civil power, although he had no entitlement to do this. To prevent public disorder, he appointed the <b>Citizen</b> <b>Guard.</b> All time he supported the people’s spirit in radio speeches. On 9 September, the German tank divisions attacked Warsaw from south-west, but the defenders (with a lot of civil volunteers) managed to stop them in the Ochota district. The situation was hopeless. The Germans advanced so many divisions that sooner or later they would conquer the city, all the more so because on 17 September the Soviets invaded east Poland. Three days later the German encirclement around Warsaw closed. On 17 September, the Royal Castle burnt down, then, on 23, the power plant. On 27 September Warsaw surrendered and on 1 October the Germans entered the city. In September 1939, around 31,000 people died, (including 25,000 civilians) and 46,000 were injured (including 20,000 civilians). 10% of the buildings were destroyed. On 27 October, the Germans arrested President Starzyński and deported him to the Dachau concentration camp, where he died in 1943 or 1944 (exact date still unknown).|$|R

2500|$|On 2 August {{there was}} a further {{attempted}} uprising in Shropshire, allegedly led by Byron himself. Mackworth learnt through an informer that several troops of royalist cavalry would meet at various locations across {{the north of the}} county, close to the Welsh border, including Wattlesborough, before proceeding to a general rendezvous at Prees Heath. The aim was to storm Shrewsbury itself: no infantry or artillery are mentioned, so the scheme must have involved a desperate dash, hoping to catch the garrison completely unprepared. Mackworth used the advantages of good intelligence and short, secure supply lines to the full, quietly concentrating forces at Wem. They moved towards Prees Heath under cover of darkness and surprised several parties of royalists before the full assembly could take place, causing the rest to disperse in panic. Mackworth reported to this on 5 August to William Pierrepont, a member of the Derby House Committee, which oversaw the war effort, requesting extra funds to reinforce Shrewsbury's defences. He wanted 250 more men for the garrison, so that he could have rotating daily shifts on guard overnight. He also needed £200 to repair and resupply the castle itself. The events seem to have made a great impression. Derby House gave Mackworth exactly what he asked and on 8 August the House of Lords approved the grants and received and recorded the report and the accompanying letter from Mackworth. Meanwhile, the Committee entrusted Mackworth with the task of securing Montgomery Castle, imperilled by the impending death of Edward Herbert, 1st Baron Herbert of Cherbury (although the Committee thought he was already dead): Samuel More appointed governor and the castle secured. On 24 August the Shropshire committee were able to release a large quantity of arms and ammunition to the mayor and corporation to equip a <b>citizen</b> <b>guard</b> for the town. e ...|$|R

5000|$|Over {{the next}} century at least {{thirteen}} other Bishops were installed. Then in 1436 Heinrich IV of Hewen was appointed Bishop.

[...] Later attempts by the town to secure Free Imperial City status led to further hostilities in 1457. The inhabitants of the city stormed the castle and captured it. Bishop Heinrich responded by besieging the city. Following intervention by Siegmund of Austria as well as Constance and Zürich a compromise was reached. Heinrich then withdrew, but attacked the city a short while later. Catching the <b>citizens</b> off <b>guard,</b> his soldiers stormed the city and captured all the leaders of the revolution. Heinrich executed the leaders of the rebellion and stripped rights away from the city.|$|R
50|$|Body armor or Body armour, or {{personal}} armor/armour is protective clothing, designed to absorb and/or deflect slashing, bludgeoning and penetrating attacks by weapons.

Today there are two main types: regular non-plated personal armor (used by the people mentioned above, except combat soldiers) and hard-plate reinforced personal armor, which is used by combat soldiers, police tactical units, private citizens, and hostage rescue teams.|$|R
50|$|According to {{the draft}} provisions, the National Guard would {{to be allowed to}} shoot without warning if delay in using them (firearms) could create a direct threat to the life or health of a <b>citizen</b> or National <b>Guard</b> soldier.

5000|$|The {{town was}} first {{mentioned}} in 1280 under the Roman name of Castrum Novum, which, literally translated from Latin, means [...] "new town". In 1895, during Austro-Hungarian rule, {{the town was}} officially named Bosanski Novi. At {{the end of the}} last decade of the 19th century, Bosanski Novi had 3,300 people with 550 households. There were wooden bridges across the Una and Sana rivers, which the <b>citizens</b> had to <b>guard</b> against the wild spring and fall floods. For that reason, a symbol of the town was built in 1906-Una quay. In 1872, Bosanski Novi was the first municipality to have a train station on the new Bosnian railway, which afforded it significant cultural and economic advantages over any other Krajina [...] municipalities. The first hospital was established around the same time.|$|R

60|$|I went {{one evening}} to the Opera {{to see that}} {{amusement}} in its birthplace, which is now so widely received over Europe. The Opera House is superb, but can seldom be quite full. On this night, however, it was; the <b>guards,</b> <b>citizens,</b> and all persons dependent on the Court, or having anything to win or lose by it, are expected to take places liberally, and applaud with spirit. The King bowed much on entrance, and was received in a popular manner, which he has no doubt deserved, having relaxed many of his father's violent persecutions against the Liberals, made in some degree an amnesty, and employed many of this character. He has made efforts to lessen his expenses; but then he deals in military affairs, and that swallows up his savings, and Heaven only knows whether he will bring [Neapolitans] to fight, which the Martinet system alone will never do. His health is undermined by epileptic fits, which, with his great corpulence, make men throw their thoughts on his brother Prince Charles. It is a pity. The King is only two-and-twenty years old.|$|R
40|$|<b>Citizen</b> {{soldiers}} (National <b>Guard</b> and Reserves) represent approximately 40 % of the {{two million}} armed forces deployed to Afghanistan and Iraq. Twenty-five to forty percent of them develop PTSD, clinical depression, sleep disturbances, or suicidal thoughts. Upon returning home, many encounter additional stresses and hurdles to obtaining care: specifically, many civilian communities lack military medical/psychiatric facilities; financial, job, home, and relationship stresses have evolved or have been exacerbated during deployment; uncertainty has increased related to future deployment; there is loss of contact with military peers; and there is reluctance to recognize and acknowledge mental health needs that interfere with treatment entry and adherence. Approximately half of those needing help are not receiving it. To address this constellation of issues, a private–public partnership was formed {{under the auspices of}} the Welcome Back Veterans Initiative. In Michigan, the Army National Guard teamed with the University of Michigan and Michigan State University to develop innovative peer-to-peer programs for soldiers (Buddy-to-Buddy) and augmented programs for military families. Goals are to improve treatment entry, adherence, clinical outcomes, and to reduce suicides. This manuscript describes training approaches, preliminary results, and explores future national dissemination...|$|R
