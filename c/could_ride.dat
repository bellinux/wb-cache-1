5|$|Mubarak's top aides, {{family and}} son Gamal {{told him he}} <b>could</b> <b>ride</b> out the turmoil, which {{convinced}} him to cling to power. It was also reported that one son, Alaa, accused his younger brother Gamal of ruining their father's reputation. Eyewitnesses said that the Egyptian army had pulled out troops from many locations near the presidential palace.|$|E
5|$|Shelby and Clarke elected not {{to pursue}} the British fleeing the Battle of Musgrove Mill. Instead, they set their sights on a British fort at Ninety Six, South Carolina, where they were sure they would find Ferguson. However, while en route, Shelby and his men were met with news of General Horatio Gates' defeat at the Battle of Camden. With the backing of General Cornwallis, Ferguson <b>could</b> <b>ride</b> to meet Shelby with his entire force, so Shelby retreated over the Appalachian Mountains into North Carolina.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after the}} {{creation}} of Woodford County, Marshall moved within its borders and was appointed county surveyor by Virginia Governor Beverley Randolph. In this capacity, he surveyed and claimed significant additional tracts of land, becoming one of Kentucky's most wealthy citizens. According to tradition, Marshall was known to boast that he <b>could</b> <b>ride</b> from Frankfort to Versailles, a distance of some , and never enter a tract of land that he didn't own. He was also supposed to have boasted that he measured his silver coinage by the peck, not having time to count the individual coins.|$|E

5|$|From {{around the}} 1860s to just before World War II {{passengers}} <b>could</b> <b>ride</b> to Kittanning Point station near the Curve. Two branch railroads {{connected to the}} main line at Horseshoe Curve in the early 20th century; the Kittanning Run Railroad and the railroad owned by the Glen White Coal and Lumber Company followed their respective creeks to nearby coal mines. The Pennsylvania Railroad delivered empty hopper cars to the Kittanning Point station which the two railroads returned loaded with coal. Across from the station, a spur track on the hillside supplied a coal trestle, where trains could take on fuel and water during the early 1900s. A reservoir was built {{at the apex of}} the Horseshoe Curve in 1887 for the city of Altoona; a second reservoir, below the first, was finished in 1896. The third reservoir, Lake Altoona, was completed by 1913. A macadam road to the curve was opened in 1932 allowing access for visitors, and a gift shop was built in 1940.|$|E
5|$|Hastings {{left the}} failed mining {{operation}} in 1899, and travelled to London. Just after he arrived, the Second Boer War broke out, and the British government called for volunteers to join an expeditionary force. The only qualifications required {{were that the}} recruit <b>could</b> <b>ride</b> and shoot, and Hastings immediately applied to join the Suffolk Imperial Yeomanry. He was accepted, and {{after two weeks of}} training the regiment were given horses and boarded the S.S. Goth Castle to South Africa. The ship reached Cape Town after three weeks, and the regiment disembarked. Their horses were considered too weak to be ridden, and so they were instead discharged and either put down or given to other soldiers. Hastings did not enjoy his time in the army; the weather was poor, the orders given were confusing and they were provided with minimal equipment.|$|E
5|$|Lake James {{was named}} by {{surveyor}} James Watson Riley. It was first surveyed in 1831 by E. H. Lytle, and settlement began shortly thereafter. Settlement {{around the lake}} was initially slow, as there were no roads that provided access. The construction of a small railroad between the city of Angola and the lake's southern tip spurred development, as visitors <b>could</b> <b>ride</b> a train to Angola and connect to the lake. After arriving at the lake by train, many of the original cottage owners took a boat to their cottage. With the exception of Pokagon State Park and a private campground, {{nearly all of the}} lake's shoreline is now developed. Much of the development consists of cottages and homes, which began over 100 years ago. Two additional lakes of significant size, Jimmerson Lake and Snow Lake, are connected to Lake James. Water from these lakes flows west, and eventually reaches Lake Michigan.|$|E

25|$|Roman law and {{tradition}} forbade {{the use of}} vehicles in urban areas, except in certain cases.

25|$|A fun {{park was}} located {{adjacent}} to the pool between the 1980s and early 2000s. The park consisted of Drive World a mini street where visitors <b>could</b> <b>ride</b> mini bikes or mini vehicles around the streets, a mini golf course, a maze, five lane super slide {{and for a time}} a mini roller coaster.|$|E
25|$|So instead Lawrence {{proposed}} {{if possible}} never meeting the enemy, thus giving their soldiers nothing to shoot at, {{unable to control}} anything except what ground their rifles could point to. Meanwhile, Lawrence and the Arabs <b>could</b> <b>ride</b> camels {{into and out of}} the desert, attacking railroad lines and isolated outposts with impunity, avoiding the heavily garrisoned positions and cities.|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{mystery of}} the ranch grows deeper," [...] said Songbird. [...] "I rather wish we had some {{officers}} of the law to consult. We <b>could</b> then <b>ride</b> {{right up to the}} ranch and make our demands." ...|$|R

25|$|Larry is {{credited}} with helping to re-popularize the stripped down, tall handlebar, foot clutched, jockey shifted, no front brake or fender, small gas tank, open piped, kick start only, stock rake choppers that prevailed in the 1960s, before long front ends became popular (Larry explained during his first Biker Build-Off, that he preferred nimbleness in a bike so he <b>could</b> <b>ride</b> at high speeds along the mountain switchbacks).|$|E
25|$|Greater {{ridership}} in the 1980s {{prompted the}} writing and passing {{of a student}} referendum that added a $13 fee to registration costs to create the fare-less system. Students who paid their registration fees <b>could</b> <b>ride</b> the bus by simply showing their registration card with a valid registration sticker, or board for a cash fare of $0.50. This referendum made Unitrans an even more convenient method of transportation for students attending UC Davis.|$|E
25|$|Abbas gained {{strong support}} from the common people. Sources report him {{spending}} {{much of his time}} among them, personally visiting bazaars and other public places in Isfahan. Short in stature but physically strong until his health declined in his final years, Abbas could go for long periods without needing to sleep or eat and <b>could</b> <b>ride</b> great distances. At the age of 19 Abbas shaved off his beard, keeping only his moustache, thus setting a fashion in Iran.|$|E

A Mr Davis put up £100 and the stake {{was held by}} the Sporting Life newspaper. Stanton started at 6am on 25 February and won the bet in 73 hours, riding on a high-wheeled machine at an average speed of 13.5mph.|$|E
25|$|The {{tradition}} Tongan fale {{consisted of}} a curved roof (branches lashed with sennit rope, or kafa, thatched with woven palm leaves) resting on pillars made of tree trunks. Woven screens filled in the area between {{the ground and the}} edge of the roof. The traditional design was extremely well adapted to surviving hurricanes. If the winds threatened to shred the walls and overturn the roof, the inhabitants could chop down the pillars, so that the roof fell directly onto the ground. Because the roof was curved, like a limpet shell, the wind tended to flow over it smoothly. The inhabitants <b>could</b> <b>ride</b> out the storm in relative safety.|$|E
25|$|The sisters {{descended from}} Martin Van Buren, the eighth President of the United States. In 1916, 24-year-old Augusta and 22-year-old Adeline Van Buren, or Gussie and Addie {{as they were}} known, were in their 20s and active in the {{national}} Preparedness Movement. America was about to enter World War I, and the sisters wanted to prove that women <b>could</b> <b>ride</b> {{as well as men}} and would be able to serve as military dispatch riders, freeing up men for other tasks. They also hoped to remove one of the primary arguments for denying women the right to vote. For their ride, they dressed in military-style leggings and leather riding breeches, a taboo at that time.|$|E
