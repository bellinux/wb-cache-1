They extended the FitzGerald–Lorentz contraction hypothesis {{and found out that}} the time coordinate has to be modified as well ("local time"). Henri Poincaré gave a physical interpretation to local time (to first order in v/c, the relative velocity of the two reference frames normalized to the speed of light) as the consequence of <b>clock</b> <b>synchronization,</b> under the assumption that the speed of light is constant in moving frames.

25|$|The work of Lorentz was mathematically perfected by Henri Poincaré who {{formulated}} on {{many occasions}} the Principle of Relativity and tried to harmonize it with electrodynamics.

In 1900 and 1904 he physically interpreted Lorentz's local time as the result of <b>clock</b> <b>synchronization</b> by light signals. And finally in June and July 1905 he declared the relativity principle a general law of nature, including gravitation. He corrected some mistakes of Lorentz and proved the Lorentz covariance of the electromagnetic equations. However, he used the notion of an aether as a perfectly undetectable medium and distinguished between apparent and real time, so most historians of science argue that he failed to invent special relativity.|$|E

40|$|In the {{framework}} of General Relativity we develop a method for analysis of {{the operation of the}} optical position meters in their photodetectors proper reference frames. These frames are non-inertial in general due to the action of external fluctuative forces on meters test masses, including detectors.

We also calculate the response of the simplest optical meters to weak plane gravitational waves and fluctuative motions of their test masses. It is demonstrated that for the round-trip meter analysis in both the transverse-traceless (TT) and local Lorentz (LL) gauges produces equal results, while for the forward-trip meter corresponding results differ in accordance with different physical assumptions (e. g. procedure of <b>clocks</b> <b>synchronization)</b> implicitly underlying the construction of the TT and LL gauges.

2500|$|In a September 1904 lecture in St. Louis named , Poincaré drew some {{consequences}} from Lorentz's {{theory and}} defined (in modification of Galileo's Relativity Principle and Lorentz's Theorem of Corresponding States) the following principle: [...] "The Principle of Relativity, {{according to which}} the laws of physical phenomena must {{be the same for}} a stationary observer as for one carried along in a uniform motion of translation, so that we have no means, and can have none, of determining whether or not we are being carried along in such a motion." [...] He also specified his <b>clock</b> <b>synchronization</b> method and explained the possibility of a [...] "new method" [...] or [...] "new mechanics", in which no velocity can surpass that of light for all observers. However, he critically noted that the Relativity Principle, Newton's action and reaction, the conservation of mass, and the conservation of energy are not fully established and are even threatened by some experiments.|$|E
2500|$|An {{important}} {{example is}} Henri Poincaré, who in 1898 {{argued that the}} simultaneity of two events {{is a matter of}} convention. In 1900, he recognized that Lorentz's [...] "local time" [...] is actually what is indicated by moving clocks by applying an explicitly operational definition of <b>clock</b> <b>synchronization</b> assuming constant light speed. In 1900 and 1904, he suggested the inherent undetectability of the aether by emphasizing the validity of what he called the principle of relativity, and in 1905/1906 he mathematically perfected Lorentz's theory of electrons in order to bring it into accordance with the postulate of relativity. While discussing various hypotheses on Lorentz invariant gravitation, he introduced the innovative concept of a 4-dimensional space-time by defining various four vectors, namely four-position, four-velocity, and four-force. He did not pursue the 4-dimensional formalism in subsequent papers, however, stating that this line of research seemed to [...] "entail great pain for limited profit", ultimately concluding [...] "that three-dimensional language seems the best suited to the description of our world". Furthermore, even as late as 1909, Poincaré continued to believe in the dynamical interpretation of the Lorentz transform. For these and other reasons, most historians of science argue that Poincaré did not invent what is now called special relativity.|$|E

2500|$|From {{experience}} by inertial scenarios (i.e. measurements in inertial frames), Langevin observers synchronize their clocks by standard Einstein convention or by slow <b>clock</b> <b>synchronization,</b> respectively (both internal synchronizations). For a certain Langevin observer this method works perfectly. Within its immediate vicinity clocks are synchronized and light propagates isotropic in space. But the experience when the observers try to synchronize their clocks along a closed path in space is puzzling: {{there are always}} at least two neighboring clocks which have different times. To remedy the situation, the observers agree on an external synchronization procedure (coordinate time t — or for ring-riding observers, a proper coordinate time for a fixed radius r). By this agreement, Langevin observers riding on a rigidly rotating disk will conclude from measurements of small distances between themselves that the geometry of the disk is non-Euclidean. [...] Regardless of which method they use, they will conclude that the geometry is well approximated by a certain Riemannian metric, namely the Langevin-Landau-Lifschitz metric. [...] This is in turn very well approximated by the geometry of the hyperbolic plane (with the negative curvatures -3ω2 and -3ω2r2, respectively). [...] But if these observers measure larger distances, they will obtain different results, depending upon which method of measurement they use! [...] In all such cases, however, they will most likely obtain results which are inconsistent with any Riemannian metric. In particular, if they use the simplest notion of distance, radar distance, owing to various effects such as the asymmetry already noted, they will conclude that the [...] "geometry" [...] of the disk is not only non-Euclidean, it is non-Riemannian.|$|E

Software components of timekeeping, including synchronisation algorithms such as ntpd, RADclock, and ptpd, must deal with the significant and highly variable latencies inherent to common operating systems. Using the DTrace system profiling tool, we provide an accurate breakdown of the latencies between common timestamping locations in the FreeBSD Operating System. We report on how these latency components react to stress patterns of different kinds, and determine which timestamping strategies result in the lowest latency, and the smallest in-host asymmetry. Our results can be used to improve timestamping and timekeeping for software clocks.

The problem is analyzed based on clock delays, cycle times, {{and complexity of the}} asynchronous port controllers. A number of methods are presented. In some cases, it is sufficient to extract all the delays and verify whether the system is susceptible to metastability. In other cases, when high data bandwidth is not required, asynchronous synchronizers or matched-delay asynchronous ports may be employed. Arbitrated clocks may be traded off for locally delayed input and output ports, facilitating high data rates. The latter circuits have been simulated, to verify their performance.

The true universality of basic constants is discussed, considering a class of measurement processes based on the velocity = distance/time interval, which always yields some number when used by an observer. The four-dimensional symmetry framework based on common time for all observers is formulated, and related processes of measuring light speed are discussed. Invariant 'action functions' for physical laws in the new four-dimensional symmetry framework with the common time are established to discuss universal constants.
