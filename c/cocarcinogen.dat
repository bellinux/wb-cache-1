Thus, from this point of view, chronic alcoholism, when integrated in a socioprofessional context of cancer hazard and/or in a spectrum of environmental/dietetic agents which are a potential inducer of carcinogenesis, could exert a promoter or <b>cocarcinogen</b> effect.

40|$|Several of the {{priority}} pollutants discussed in EPA's Ambient Water Quality Criteria documents {{have been reported}} to have promotion or cocarcinogenic activity. For example, phenol appears to have tumor-promoting activity in mice when repeatedly applied after initiation with either 7, 12 -dimethyl- 1, 2 -benzanthracene (DMBA) or benzo(a) pyrene (BaP). Similarly, {{it has been reported that}} 2, 3, 7, 8 -tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) is a potent promoter of liver tumors as well as a <b>cocarcinogen.</b> However, in developing guidelines to derive ambient water quality criteria, it became apparent that satisfactory approaches had not been developed for using promotion/cocarcinogen data in human health risk estimation, nor were available promotion and/or <b>cocarcinogen</b> data on individual chemicals strong enough to permit a defensible quantitative risk estimation, if such approaches had existed. For this reason, the criteria derived for pollutants with reported promotion/cocarcinogenic activities were based on approaches for carcinogenic (e. g., TCDD), toxic (e. g., fluoranthene) or organoleptic effects (e. g., 2, 4 -dichlorophenol). Nonetheless, with advances in studies on both the biological mechanisms and dose/response patterns of promoters and cocarcinogens, it may be possible to develop a scientifically valid quantitative approach to use this type of data for derivation of ambient water quality criteria or other risk assessments. Some progress toward this goal and the problems associated with this effort are discussed...|$|E
40|$|In recent {{experiments}} with yeast strain MP 1, <b>cocarcinogens</b> {{were found to}} be comutagenic and antirecombinogenic and antimutagenic. Substances that were <b>cocarcinogens</b> as well as tumor promoters had an intermediary effect. In course of the present work with S. cerevisiae MP 1 using bile acids per se and in combination with triethylene melamine (TEM), of the following substances dose/effect-curves have been established: Deoxycholic acid, chenodeoxycholic acid, ursodeoxycholic acid, cholesterol (control), ox gall, and of mixture of a bile salts. Bile acids showed all three possible ways of action supporting the hypothesis that mutagenesis is the mechanism by which chemicals induce malignancy, and that <b>cocarcinogens</b> modify the process by enhancement of mutagenicity whereas tumor promoters effect carcinogenesis mainly by the increase of the spontaneous frequency of recombination. In addition to this, experiments have been performed with yeast strain D 61. M for detection of aneuploidy. In these experiments no effects could be observed. According to the present results it seems furthermore possible that in normal cases bile acids neutralize each other, i. e. the comutagenic (corecombinogenic) effect of one substance is antagonized by the antimutagenic (antirecombinogenic) effect of another one. Only if the balance is lost bile acids may be harmful...|$|R

40|$|Only a {{fraction}} of subjects exposed to asbestos develop malignant mesothelioma (MM), suggesting that additional factors may render some individuals more susceptible. We tested the hypothesis that asbestos and Simian virus (SV 40) are <b>cocarcinogens.</b> Asbestos and SV 40 in combination had a costimulatory effect in inducing ERK 1 / 2 phosphorylation and activator protein- 1 (AP- 1) activity in both primary Syrian hamster mesothelial cells (SHM) and primary human mesothelial cells (HM). Ap- 1 activity caused the expression and activation of matrix metalloprotease (MMP) - 1 and MMP- 9, which in turn led to cell invasion. Experiments using siRNA and chemical inhibitors confirmed the specificity of these results. The same effects were observed in HM and SHM. Experiments in hamsters showed strong cocarcinogenesis between asbestos and SV 40 : SV 40 did not cause MM, asbestos caused MM in 20 % of hamsters, and asbestos and SV 40 together caused MM in 90 % of hamsters. Significantly lower amounts of asbestos were sufficient to cause MM in animals infected with SV 40. Our results indicate that mineral fibers and viruses can be <b>cocarcinogens</b> and suggest that lower amounts of asbestos may be sufficient to cause MM in individuals infected with SV 40...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: Because torque teno virus (TTV) {{has been}} implicated in {{tumorigenesis}} as a <b>cocarcinogen,</b> we studied TTV prevalence in saliva and biopsy samples from head and neck cancer (HNCC) patients, patients with premalignant lesions of oral cancer, and controls. We also wished to determine the TTV genotypes in HNCC patients. Methods: A seminested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplifying the N 22 region of the TTV genome, as well as direct sequencing of PCR fragments, was used. Results: TTV prevalence was higher in HNCC patients (saliva: 27 / 71, 38 %; tumor biopsy: 22 / 74, 30 %) than in controls (saliva: 8 / 56, 14 %; oral mucosa: 1 / 19, 5 %). TTV prevalence was also high in patients with premalignant lesions of oral carcinoma (saliva: 9 / 18, 50 %; biopsy: 5 / 21, 24 %). By phylogenetic analysis, TTV belonging mostly to genotypes 1 and 2 was found in HNCC patients. In most of the cases, identical TTV strains {{were present in the}} biopsy and salivary sample of the same HNCC patient. In addition, the same TTV strain was detected in 2 laryngeal carcinoma biopsies obtained from 2 independent patients. Conclusions: Our data are compatible with the idea that TTV might act as a <b>cocarcinogen</b> in certain cases of HNCC. Alternatively, HNCC may facilitate either TTV replication or TTV entry into the saliva. © 2016 S. Karger AG, Base...|$|E
40|$|The {{enhancement}} of the carcinogenicity of benzo(a) pyrene (B[a]P) and 3 -propiolactone (BPL) by the mouse skin cocarcinogens phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) and catechol {{were examined in}} female SEN-CAR mice, 30 per group. The carcinogen and <b>cocarcinogen</b> were applied simultaneously, three times weekly for 490 - 560 days. B(a) P and BPL were used at constant doses of 5 and 50 jig, respectively, in all experiments. PMA was used at three doses, 2. 5, 1. 0, and 0. 5 p. g per application, and catechol was used at one dose, 2 mg per application. Control groups included animals that received carcinogen only, <b>cocarcinogen</b> only, acetone only, and no treatment. The carcinogenicity of B(a) P and BPL were enhanced by the cocarcinogens, particularly in terms of tumor multiplicity. For both carcinogens, the most marked cocarcinogenic effects were observed at the lowest dose of PMA used (0. 5,ug per application). This observation applied for days to first tumor, animals with tumors, tumor multiplicity, and incidence of malignant skin tumors. Catechol applied alone did not induce any tumors; with PMA alone there were significant incidences of benign and malignant tumors, e. g., at a dose of only 0. 5,ug per application, 15 of 30 animals had 28 tumors, 5 of which were squamous carcinomas. In two-stage carcinogenesis experiments with 7, 12 -dimethylbenz(a) anthracene (DMBA) as initiator and PMA as promoter, SENCAR mice showed a greater susceptibility to tumor induction when compared to ICR/Ha mice used in earlier work. This susceptibility was most notable in terms of rate of tumor appearance and tumor multiplicity...|$|E
40|$|Although {{epidemiologic}} {{evidence shows}} {{an association between}} inorganic {{arsenic in drinking water}} and increased risk of skin, lung, and bladder cancers, no animal model for arsenic carcinogenesis has been successful. This lack has hindered mechanistic studies of arsenic carcinogenesis. Previously, we and others found that low concentrations (< or = 5 microm) of arsenite (the likely environmental carcinogen), which are not mutagenic, can enhance the mutagenicity of other agents, including ultraviolet radiation (UVR) and alkylating agents. This enhancing effect appears to result from inhibition of DNA repair by arsenite, but not via inhibition of DNA repair enzymes. Rather, low concentrations of arsenite disrupt p 53 function and upregulate cyclin D 1. Failure to find an animal model for arsenic carcinogenesis might be because arsenite is not a carcinogen per se but acts as an enhancing agent (<b>cocarcinogen)</b> with a genotoxic partner. We tested this hypothesis with solar UVR in hairless but immunocompetent Skh 1 mice. Mice were given 10 mg/L sodium arsenite in drinking water (or not) and irradiated with 1. 7 KJ/m(2) solar UVR 3 times weekly. As expected, no tumors appeared in any organs in control mice or in mice given arsenite alone. After 26 weeks irradiated mice given arsenite had a 2. 4 -fold increase in skin tumor yield compared with mice given UVR alone. The tumors were mostly squamous cell carcinomas, and those occurring in mice given UVR plus arsenite were much larger and more invasive. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that arsenic acts as a <b>cocarcinogen</b> with a second (genotoxic) agent by inhibiting DNA repair and/or enhancing positive growth signaling. Skin cancers in populations drinking water containing arsenic may be caused by the enhancement by arsenic compounds of carcinogenesis induced by UVR (or other environmental agents). It is possible that lung and bladder cancers associated with arsenic in drinking water may also require a carcinogenic partner...|$|E
40|$|A {{model for}} {{spontaneous}} tumour {{formation in the}} rat pancreas is described that requires neither <b>cocarcinogens</b> nor dietary manipulation. Short term hypercholecystokininaemia, when induced by raw soya flour feeding, induces benign and malignant tumours of the rat pancreas. Pancreaticobiliary diversion (PBD) results in hypercholecystokininaemia and in the short term, pancreatic hyperplasia. Longterm PBD was done to establish whether hypercholecystokininaemia thus produced would also lead to pancreatic neoplasia. After a period of 16 - 21 months hyperplastic and adenomatous nodules, one of the latter showing carcinoma in situ, were found in PBD rats but not in sham operated control rats...|$|R
40|$|Mesothelioma, a {{malignancy}} {{associated with}} asbestos, has been recently linked to simian virus 40 (SV 40). We found that infection of human mesothelial cells by SV 40 {{is very different}} from the semipermissive infection thought to be characteristic of human cells. Mesothelial cells are uniformly infected but not lysed by SV 40, a mechanism related to p 53, and undergo cell transformation at an extremely high rate. Exposure of mesothelial cells to asbestos complemented SV 40 mutants in transformation. Our data provide a mechanistic explanation for the ability of SV 40 to transform mesothelial cells preferentially and indicate that asbestos and SV 40 may be <b>cocarcinogens...</b>|$|R

40|$|Despite the {{epidemiological}} {{evidence of}} a correlation between ethanol abuse and hepatocellular carcinoma, some {{of the results of}} experimental and clinical studies remain controversial. Apart from inducing cirrhosis, which may be viewed as a precancerous liver lesion, ethanol may act as a <b>cocarcinogen.</b> Most investigations on this topic have focused on two aspects: ethanol's capacity to induce the cytochrome P- 450 -dependent microsomal biotransformation system and its interference with at least one DNA repair mechanism. Ethanol exposure enhances the capacity of mixed function oxidases to activate many chemical carcinogens, such as dimethylnitrosamine (DMN). On the other hand, ethanol exposure fails to influence DMN-induced liver carcinogenesis. The capacity of alcohol to inhibit DMN-demethylase activity has not been clearly demonstrated in experiments carried out with human tissue. In conclusion, both the effects of ethanol and their underlying mechanisms as regards liver carcinogenesis are open to debate. The link between ethanol abuse and hepatocellular carcinoma appears to be mediated mainly by its capacity to induce cirrhosis...|$|E
40|$|Cigarette smoke induces {{carcinoma}} of the larynx in Syrian golden hamsters and is active as a tumor promoter in hamsters pretreated with a low dose of a PAH, nitrosamine, or nitrosamide. These tumorigenic effects are only observed with total smoke, {{but not with the}} gas phase alone. This demonstrates that the tumorigenic agents reside primarily in the particulate phase. According to fractionation experiments, a number of four- and five-ring aromatic hydrocarbons serve as the major tumor initiators in tobacco smoke. Tumor promoters reside primarily in weakly polaric neutral subfractions and in the weakly acidic portion of the particulate matter and include certain unsaturated hydrocarbons and phenolic compounds. Cocarcinogenic activity is a characteristic feature of tobacco smoke and its particulates. Among the cocarcinogens formed during combustion are catechols and certain nontumorigenic aromatic hydrocarbons and terpenes. Nicotine may also serve as a <b>cocarcinogen</b> as is indicated by preliminary data. The action of tumor promoters and cocarcinogens in tobacco carcinogenesis, the precursors for tobacco smoke promoters and cocarcinogens, and methods for their reduction in smoke are discussed...|$|E

Ingestion of ethanol was begun 4 weeks prior to inhalation of VC and continued for life or termination of the study at two and one-half years from the first VC exposure. In this model system, ethanol potentiated the carcinogenic response to VC in the liver and produced an excess of neoplasms in animals receiving ethanol alone. Inhalation of VC induced angiosarcoma of the liver in 23 % of the exposed animals; ethanol in addition to VC inhalation increased the incidence to 50 %. Concomitant administration of VC and ethanol also produced an excess of hepatocellular carcinoma and lymphosarcoma. Ethanol with or without VC had a strong tumorigenic effect on the endocrine system.

40|$|In {{recent years}} {{a great deal}} of effort has been spent on uncover-ing new {{carcinogens}} and studying the mode of action of well-known carcinogens such as nitroso compounds, aromatic hydrocarbons and aromatic amines and their Occurrence in air, water, foods and other environmental sources. It has been known for about thirty years that some materials, while non-carcinogenic, can enhance greatly the potency of low-levels of known environmental carcinogens. The first such material to be discovered was the tumor promotor, croton oil, derived from the seeds of a tropical plant, Croton tiglium L., indigenous to hdia and Sri Lanka. Researchers interested in chemical carcinogenesis have examined its unusual behavior for many years. The active principles of croton oil, the phorbol esters, were finally isolated and chemically characterized. Re-cently these phorbol esters have become widely available. Consequently, their effects have been examined {{in a wide range of}} biochemical and biological studies. The phorbol esters are not environmental factors in cancer causation since they occur in a toxic plant which is not used as a source of animal or human food. Other known tumor prom-oters are much less active, e. g., anthralin (7, 8 -dihydroxy- 9 -anthrone) and phenol. Thus, the phorbol esters, although valu-able tools in studies on chemical carcinogenesis, are less rele-vant to environmental health and disease than another group of compounds known as <b>cocarcinogens.</b> Many <b>cocarcinogens</b> are ubiquitous environmental agents and only recently have these compounds been given more attention.

The effective dose range of TPA + ENU was very small, i. e., between 2 x 0. 2 and 2 x 0. 33 mg/kg, but the effect was very strong as shown by the steep slope of the dose-effect curve.

The only useful method for investigating comutagenicity and co-recombinogenicity of dioxins in vivo is the spot test with mice. In this test system, a number of <b>cocarcinogens</b> and tumor promoters have shown comutagenic or co-recombinogenic effects.

In the two independent studies, golden Syrian hamsters were used to evaluate the carcinogenic and cocarcinogenic potential of dentifrices containing H,O, and NaHCO,. In the first study, the cocarcinogenic potential of a dentifrice containing 0. 75 % H,OJ 5 % baking soda was compared with that of a commercial dentifrice with similar ingredients except baking soda and H,O,.

We correlated the results with those from transmission electron microscopy and light microscopy. Although the epidermal changes morphologically showed similarities, biologically they differed. With them, distinct changes in the epidermal-dermal junction developed, that could be followed through early, hyperplastic and neoplastic phases. With the SEM the first changes were seen in the basal layer of the epidermis and concerned the cell arrangement. SEM provided information about the localization and development of incipient epidermal carcinomas induced by DMBA-TPA and DMBA treatment, as well as about {{the changes in the}} basal lamina. These can be classified by their surface, their extent and their frequency throughout large regions. Our studies indicate that these changes vary greatly, depending upon the treatment used and the time of their development.

We have now examined a class of substances which are either tumour promoters or anticarcinogens in carcinogenicity tests, depending on the mouse strain used and age of the animals. In the genetic test without activation these substances were antimutagenic and co-recombinogenic. In the presence of activating S 9 -mix they showed co-mutagenic and antirecombinogenic effects.

Using agarose gel electrophoresis we showed that bile acids convert covalently closed circular plasmid DNA to the open circular form, indicating strand breakage. We next treated the single stranded circular DNA of phage M 13 with bile acids and found that the transfection efficiency of this DNA declined up to a thousand-fold.

Two exposure groups from each test atmosphere were also treated by a single subcutaneous injection of either 3 mg or 6 mg of diethylnitrosamine/kg of body weight to evaluate an enhancing effect of diethylnitrosamine on exposure-related changes. Morphologicel evaluation was done by histopathology. Minor changes of the larynx and trachea were investigated by scanning electron miroscopy, which showed a loss of ciliated cells in all exhaust-exposed groups. After exposure to diesel exhaust with or without particles, focal metaplasia and dysplasia of the respiratory epithelium were seen in the oldest animals by scanning electron microscopy. In the same specimens, attached muco us droplets indicated changes in mucous cells and mucous viscosity. Only the exposure to total diesel exhaust significantly increased the tumor rate in the upper respiratory tract of male hamsters treated with 6 mg of diethylnitrosamine per kg of body weight. At the lower diethylnitrosamine dose no exposure-related effects on the tumor rates could be observed.

Some studies {{suggested}} that HPV may play an etiologic role in bronchial carcinogenesis and possibility of a latent HPV infection as a <b>cocarcinogen</b> cannot be excluded. HPV (high risk types) 16 & 18 may affect the cell cycle and inhibit apoptosis, allowing uncontrolled cell division. Aims of study: 1. To use bronchial wash as a non invasive procedure to determine the presence of DNA of high risk types (16 & 18) of HPV in patients with lung cancer using in situ hybridization technique. 2. To Find the association of the score or intensity of viral in situ hybridization signals with histopathological types. Patients, Materials and methods: A prospective study, whereby bronchial wash of 50 patients diagnosed cytologicaly as having lung cancer together with samples from 30 patient having chronic illness as control. Results: The most affected age group was 66 – 70 years (28 % of the cases). Males were affected more frequently than females (64. 0 %). Regarding HPV 16 & 18 and histological types of lung cancer the commonest effected type was squamouse cell carcinoma showed positive signals in 32 % and 28 % for HPV 16 &HPV 18 respectively. Percentage score and intensity score: Lung cancer samples showed low intensity signals for human papilloma virus 16 in 63. 6 % of samples and 44. 5 % for human papilloma virus 18. Conclusions: Human papilloma virus 16 and 18 was detected in cytological bronchial samples of patients with lung cancer in relatively high percentag...|$|E
40|$|Bile acids enhance {{colorectal}} carcinogenesis {{in animals}} and man, perhaps after degradation by faecal anaerobes. The promotional effect of sodium deoxycholate (SDC) {{and its relationship}} to bacteria was examined in male Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 115) which had received a 6 -week course of azoxymethane (total dose 90 mg kg- 1 s. c.) Two groups received 3 X weekly intrarectal (i. r.) instillations of N saline or 0. 12 M SDC for 18 weeks. Another group received SDC i. r. plus metronidazole (22. 5 mg kg- 1) daily in the drinking water. Controls had no instillations or metronidazole alone. By 28 weeks SDC had increased mean colonic crypt depth by 9 % (P less than 0. 001), and had almost trebled colorectal tumour yields from 2. 4 +/- 0. 4 per rat (mean +/- s. e.) in controls to 6. 4 +/- 0. 5 (P less than 0. 001). Tumour yields after SDC + metronidazole (4. 2 +/- 0. 5) remained 75 % higher than in controls (P less than 0. 01) but were 33 % less than after SDC alone (P less than 0. 01), and the increase in crypt depth was maintained at 7 % (P less than 0. 001). Neither metronidazole alone nor saline i. r. had any effect on tumour yield, but metronidazole alone reduced crypt depth by 9 % (P less than 0. 001). Deoxycholate is a potent <b>cocarcinogen</b> and also stimulates mucosal hyperplasia. Metronidazole reduces its tumour-promoting effect, suggesting that faecal anaerobes are important in bile acid cocarcinogenesis...|$|E
40|$|Arsenic {{is a human}} skin, lung, and {{urinary bladder}} carcinogen, and may act as a <b>cocarcinogen</b> in the skin and urinary bladder. Possible modes of action of arsenic carcinogenesis/cocarcinogenesis include {{oxidative}} stress induction and inhibition of DNA damage repair. We investigated the effects of {{arsenic in drinking water}} on DNA damage repair in urinary bladder transitional cells and on micronucleus formation in bone marrow. F 344 rats were given 100 ppm arsenate [As(V) ] or dimethylarsinic acid [DMA(V) ] in drinking water for 1 week. The in vivo repair of cyclophosphamide (CP) -induced DNA damage resulting from a single oral gavage of CP, and the in vitro repair of hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2) - or formaldehyde- induced DNA damage, resulting from adding H 2 O 2 or formaldehyde into cell medium, were measured by the Comet assay. DMA(V) effects were not observed on either CP-induced DNA damage induction or on DNA repair. Neither DMA(V) nor As(V) increased the H 2 O 2 - or formaldehyde- induced DNA damage, and neither inhibited the repair of H 2 O 2 -induced DNA damage. Neither DMA(V) nor As(V) increased the micronucleus frequency, nor did they elevate micronucleus frequency resulting from CP treatment above the level observed by the treatment with CP alone. These results suggest that arsenic carcinogenesis/cocarcinogenesis in the urinary bladder may not be via DNA damage repair inhibition. To our knowledge this is the first report of arsenic effects on DNA damage repair in the urinary bladder...|$|E
40|$|SUMMARY. -The {{behaviour}} of {{the normal}} epidermis of mice on the first 5 days of exposure to a single application of carcinogens and <b>cocarcinogens</b> has been investigated by simple quantitative measurements of cell population, size of cells and thickness of the epidermis. Irritant substances and promoting agents both produce cellular hypertrophy but the respective responses can be distinguished by the massive and persistent hyperplasia associated with promoting activity and the much greater incidence of degenerate cells associated with irritant treatment. Urethane treatment is characterized by induction of a transient hypoplasia which is not {{in agreement with the}} level of cellular division. This response has also been demonstrated after treatment with mild carcinogens or low doses of potent carcinogens. Higher dose levels are followed by a reduction in the mitotic index after about 27 hours. The possibility of developing a preliminary screening test for carcinogenic substances is discussed in the light of these observations. THE application of a carcinogen to the skin of mice induces a thickening of th...|$|R
40|$|Metals {{constitute}} a fundamentally {{important part of}} the total human environment. Since human exposure often involves complex mixtures of metal compounds and, possibly, organic compounds which may be carcinogenic per se, interactions between these compounds may add significantly to human cancer risk. Our present knowledge about these kinds of interactions is very limited. The best investigated area is benzo(a) pyrene (BP) -metal oxide particle interactions in respiratory carcinogenesis in the hamster. Metal oxide particles were also shown to modify the carcinogenic effect of nitrosamines. Several reports describe experiments in which selenium compounds exerted a generally anticarcinogenic and antimutagenic activity. Inorganic arsenic compounds, which are accepted to be carcinogenic in man, have so far been negative in animal experiments except for one recent suggested report. Several authors have, however, suggested that these compounds may act as <b>cocarcinogens</b> due to their inhibition of DNA repair, although animal experiments to demonstrate a cocarcinogenic effect of arsenic compounds have been negative so far, except for one preliminary report. The concentration of zinc in the diet seemed to influence both transplanted tumor growth and the carcinogenicity of several organic compounds, and the possibility of a correlation between dietary zinc and certain cancer forms in man ha...|$|R
40|$|The International Agency for Research on Cancer (1) {{has stated}} that there is {{sufficient}} evidence for the carcinogenicity of radon and its decay products both in humans and in experimental animals. An increased incidence of pulmonary neoplasms has been observed in humans in different groups of underground miners: uranium miners (2 - 6), iron miners (7, 8) and other miners (9, 10) especially those that smoke cigarettes (11 - 13), suggesting that cocarcinogenic mechanisms {{may be involved in}} the pathogenesis of such neoplasia. It has also been shown that lung cancers can be induced in dogs (14) and rats (15, 16) by exposure to radon and its daughters. Experimentally, a cocarcinogenic effect results in increased tumor rates after combined administration of the potential <b>cocarcinogens</b> (17). As combined exposure to various carcinogens is common in some mine environments, the potential cocarcinogenic effects of environmental or industrial airborne pollutants such as tobacco smoke, mineral fibers, diesel exhausts, or minerals from metallic mine ores were studied in rats in combination with radon exposure. This review summarizes the main experimental results obtained in our laboratory over the last 20 years in rats exposed to radon and its decay products. The results of ongoing experiments using combined exposure to radon and other airborne pollutants are also reported...|$|R
