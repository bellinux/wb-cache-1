40|$|This rapport is a {{study of}} {{how to create a}} {{workshop}} that gives high school students <b>concrete</b> <b>tools</b> in building and giving presentations. Through use of rhetorical and pedagogical theory, combined with interviews with high school students, a workshop is made. This workshop is then tried out on two high school classes, followed by them filling out questionnaires regarding the workshop, and interviews with two teachers who have been observing the workshop. Based on this research, the study reaches several conclusions. First of all, shaping the langue to the students’ level of understanding is the key in creating a successful workshop. Subsequently, extensive use of examples is of the outmost importance in making this happen. Examples makes the theory easy to understand, and can relate it to the lives of the students. Secondly, practical exercises {{play a crucial role in}} a successful workshop. Not only explaining the students the different tools for good presentations, but actually making them work with the tools, gives the students experience with the tools, and makes them aware of their own strengths and weaknesses. So a combination of presenting the <b>concrete</b> <b>tools</b> in a language the students can understand through examples, and making them work with the tools in a practical exercise, creates a workshop that successfully gives the students <b>concrete</b> <b>tools</b> in building and giving presentations...|$|R

40|$|International audienceStatement of problemComputer-aided design/computer-aided {{manufacturing}} (CAD/CAM) machining {{influences the}} surface roughness of dental restorations and tool wear. Roughness must be suitable to meet clinical requirements, and the tool must {{last as long}} as possible. PurposeThe purpose of this pilot study was to investigate the influence of the CAD/CAM tool-material couple on tool wear and surface roughness after milling. Material and methodsThree tools (Lyra conical <b>tool</b> <b>Ø</b> 1 mm; GACD SASU, Lyra conical <b>tool</b> <b>Ø</b> 1. 05 mm; GACD SASU, and Cerec cylinder pointed tool 12 S; Sirona Dental Systems GmbH) and 3 CAD/CAM materials (Lava Ultimate; 3 M ESPE, Mark II; VITA Zahnfabrik H. Rauter GmbH, and Enamic; VITA Zahnfabrik H. Rauter GmbH) were tested. The tool wear of 6 tool-material couples at a feed rate of 2 m/min was analyzed before and after 8 minutes of flank and climb milling with optical and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) observations and tool weighing. The surface roughness after milling was observed for 9 tool-material couples for flank and climb milling. Feed rates of 1, 2, 3, and 4. 8 m/min were used for each couple. Ra, Rt, Rz, Sa, Sq, and Sz roughness criteria were measured. A paired comparison of tool-material couples was conducted with the Kruskal-Wallis test. ResultsThe Mark II material led to more severe tool wear. Milling of Lava Ultimate resulted in chip deposits on the tool grit. The Cerec cylinder pointed tool 12 S was less worn for each material tested. The Cerec cylinder pointed tool 12 S and the Lyra conical <b>tool</b> <b>Ø</b> 1. 05 mm provided similar roughness measurements for the 3 materials tested. The Lyra conical <b>tool</b> <b>Ø</b> 1. 05 mm tool provided better roughness than the Lyra conical <b>tool</b> <b>Ø</b> 1 mm <b>tool</b> for the Enamic material. ConclusionTool lifetime calculated by volume of milled material removed should be the measure provided by CAD/CAM manufacturers instead of a number of blocks. This tool lifetime should be provided for the milling conditions associated with the material milled. Material hardness and tool grit are key factors for achieving a given roughness...|$|R
