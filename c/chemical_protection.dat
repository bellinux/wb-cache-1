5|$|When {{directly}} threatened, many mantis species {{stand tall}} and spread their forelegs, with their wings fanning out wide. The fanning of the wings makes the mantis seem {{larger and more}} threatening, with some species enhancing this effect with bright colors and patterns on their hind wings and inner surfaces of their front legs. If harassment persists, a mantis may strike with its forelegs and attempt to pinch or bite. As part of the bluffing (deimatic) threat display, some species may also produce a hissing sound by expelling air from the abdominal spiracles. Mantises lack <b>chemical</b> <b>protection,</b> so their displays are largely bluff. When flying at night, at least some mantises are able to detect the echolocation sounds produced by bats; when the frequency begins to increase rapidly, indicating an approaching bat, they stop flying horizontally and begin a descending spiral toward {{the safety of the}} ground, often preceded by an aerial loop or spin. If caught, they may slash captors with their raptorial legs.|$|E

25|$|Strict {{enforcement}} of anti-arm laws {{which are in}} existence in Singapore since 1823 {{has resulted in a}} relatively disarmed society, where firearms-related crimes are rare. It is therefore not an operational requirement for police officers to wear bullet resistant vests when conducting normal policing duties. However, vests, helmets, and shields are carried in police vehicles and stocked in police establishments and can be rapidly utilize should the situation require it. In addition, <b>chemical</b> <b>protection</b> equipment such as suit, gloves, boots and NBC masks etc. are readily available to be drawn from the maintenance stores. Special units such as the KINS unit are known for utilising the skeletal battle order vest as a direct alternative to the ops kit belt for as they are issued with firearm magazines while on duty. From 2004, new multi-purpose vests were introduced which offer officers protection against most handgun fire, knife thrusts, as well as doubling up as a buoyancy vest should officers fall into deep water.|$|E
500|$|The first {{production}} {{versions of}} the AMX-30, named AMX 30B to distinguish them from the AMX 30A prototypes, were completed in June 1966, manufactured with a welded and cast hull and a fully cast turret. The production version of the tank had a combat weight of [...] The AMX-30's survivability was based on its mobility; French engineers believed that the tank's mobility would have been compromised had they added enough steel plating to protect against modern anti-tank threats, including high explosive anti-tank warheads (HEAT). As a result, the type had the thinnest armour of any main battle tank produced at the time. The turret has a maximum armour thickness of , the armour sloped at 70 degrees on the front plate and 23 degrees on the side, offering protection against [...] armour piercing projectiles. The Line-of-Sight armour values are: [...] for {{the front of the}} hull; [...] for the forward sides of the hull; [...] for the rear sides and rear of the hull; [...] for the hull top and bottom; [...] for the turret front; [...] for the turret sides; [...] for the turret rear and [...] for the turret top. Further protection is offered by a nuclear, biological and <b>chemical</b> <b>protection</b> suit, including a ventilation system.|$|E

It also has two headlights in front of the hull and a searchlight on the right-hand side of the top of the turret. It lagged behind other Soviet armoured fighting vehicles because only the driver had a night vision device and also because it has no fire or NBC (nuclear, biological, <b>chemical)</b> <b>protection</b> systems, which significantly reduced its effectiveness. The lack of NBC protection ended with the PT-76B, which has the PAZ ("protivo-atomnaya zashchita") NBC protection system.

The Kornet is similar in {{function}} to the Khrizantema missile system. The 9P163M-1 carries two 9M133 missiles on launch rails, which are extended from a stowed position during transit. Missiles are re-loaded automatically by the tank destroyer from an internal magazine with 16 rounds (missiles are stored and transported in sealed canisters). Nuclear, biological and <b>chemical</b> <b>protection</b> is provided for the two crew members (gunner and driver) in addition to full armour protection equivalent to the standard BMP-3 chassis. The guidance system of the 9P163M-1 allows two missiles to be fired at once, the missiles operating on different guidance (laser) channels. The first Kornet-T missile carriers were delivered in 2003 to replace the Shturm-S, and the first batch of 20 vehicles entered service in 2012. The Kornet-T is used by motorized units.|$|E

30|$|The UBA sees a {{need for}} a {{systematic}} review of and a political discussion about both the external costs of <b>chemical</b> plant <b>protection</b> in Germany and the distribution of the costs within society. UBA commissioned a study drawing on the work of Waibel and Fleischer [67] to provide scientific clarity. In a second step, it is necessary to discuss the scope for political actions concerning the “societal dimension” of <b>chemical</b> plant <b>protection.</b> This should also address the potential options for political action to compensate for the effects of market distortions and to internalise external costs. Political influence could be exerted by means of reforms to the EU and national farm payments (e.g., increased payments for farms with low PPP use) or a levy on PPPs (which is common practice in some EU Member States, e.g., in Denmark). A study on the introduction of a levy or tax on PPPs in Germany carried out on behalf of the Federal States Schleswig-Holstein, Baden-Wurttemberg, and Rhineland-Palatinate recently reignited a discussion on this topic [70]. The UBA expressly welcomes the discussion about the prospects and the limits of this instrument—both with regard to the internalisation of external costs and to providing incentives to minimise the use of <b>chemical</b> plant <b>protection</b> products.|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the profile of fungal metabolites and antioxidant substances from plants on a representative population of wheat cultivars grown in Poland. Tests were conducted on grain of 23 wheat cultivars in three experimental variants: natural infection (control), <b>chemical</b> crop <b>protection,</b> and artificial inoculation with the fungi F. graminearum and F. culmorum. Grains were analysed in terms of infection rate, mycotoxin, ergosterol, free and bound phenolic acid content, as well as antioxidant capacity. Calculated Fusarium head blight index (FHB index) ranged from 0 % to 24 % in the control, from 0 % to 95 % after inoculation and from 0 to 3 % following <b>chemical</b> crop <b>protection</b> treatments. The highest concentration of ergosterol was detected in seeds from inoculated plots, with a mean value of 26. 69 mg/kg. The highest mean concentration calculated for total toxin content was recorded after inoculation (7. 833 mg/kg). The mean value for ferulic acid for inoculated samples resulted 2574 mg/kg, while for chemically protected samples 1158 mg/kg was obtained. Based on of discriminant analysis genotypes can be separated for inoculation 100 %, for <b>chemical</b> crop <b>protection</b> 95 %, and for natural infection 90 %.
