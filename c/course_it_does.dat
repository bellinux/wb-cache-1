500|$|MSNBC's Patrick Enwright {{listed the}} episode as his ninth {{favorite}} in the show in 2007, saying it [...] "brilliantly skewers new-agey self-help gurus" [...] and adding that [...] "it's also noteworthy for clever pop-cultural references." [...] The authors of the book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, described it as [...] "A very bizarre episode in which everyone just has a good time." [...] DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson wrote: [...] "A certified classic, 'Child' mocks the self-help field and makes a good point along the way. Of <b>course,</b> <b>it</b> <b>does</b> all this with scads of clever moments and becomes a great show. As one who works in psychology, it's hard to resist this program's spoofery." [...] Patrick Bromley of DVD Verdict gave the episode a grade of B+ and described Homer's escapades with the trampoline as [...] "the episode's brightest spot." [...] Turner described the Wile E. Coyote and Road Runner homage as [...] "one of the show's most overt and inspired tributes to the Warner cartoons." [...] Bill Gibron of DVD Talk gave the episode a score of 4.5 out of 5.|$|E
2500|$|Dershowitz {{is one of}} {{a number}} of {{scholars}} at Harvard Law School who have expressed their support for limited animal rights. In his Rights from Wrongs: A Secular Theory of the Origins of Rights (2004), he writes that, in order to avoid human beings treating each other the way we treat animals, we have made what he calls the [...] "somewhat arbitrary decision" [...] to single out our own species for different and better treatment. [...] "Does this subject us to the charge of speciesism? Of <b>course</b> <b>it</b> <b>does,</b> and we cannot justify it, except by the fact that in the world in which we live, humans make the rules. That reality imposes on us a special responsibility to be fair and compassionate to those on whom we impose our rules. Hence the argument for animal rights." ...|$|E
2500|$|Joel Fineman treats Sonnet 65 as epideictic. [...] He injects cynicism {{into the}} Fair Youth sonnets, {{claiming}} that the speaker does not believe fully in the immortalizing power of his verse; that it is merely literary and ultimately unreal. [...] He treats the [...] "still" [...] in line 14 as wordplay, reading it to mean [...] "dead, unmoving" [...] rather than [...] "perpetual, eternal". [...] There is some scholarly debate over this point, though. [...] Carl Atkins, for example, writes that the reader is [...] "not to take the couplet's 'unless' seriously. [...] We {{are not expected to}} have any doubt that the 'miracle' of making the beloved shine brightly in black ink has might. [...] Of <b>course</b> <b>it</b> <b>does</b> - we have been told so before. [...] 'Who can hold back time?' the speaker asks. [...] 'No one, except me,' is the answer". Philip Martin tends toward agreement with Atkins, but refutes the suggestion that the reader is [...] "not to take the couplet's 'unless' seriously," [...] asserting instead that, [...] "the poem's ending is...deliberately and properly tentative". Murray Krieger agrees with Martin's point that, [...] "the end of 65 is stronger precisely because it is so tentative". [...] "The soft, almost non-consonantal 'how shall summer's honey breath hold out' [...] " [...] offers no resistance to Time's 'wrackful siege of batt'ring days'. Krieger suggests that while the sonnet does not resist Time through an assertion of strength, the concession of weakness by the placement of hope solely on a 'miracle,' offers an appeal against Time: [...] "May there not be a strength that arises precisely from the avoidance of it?".|$|E

2500|$|Off-screen, actress Lucy Speed {{had decided}} to leave the serial after playing Natalie for a year, as she was {{reportedly}} “freaked out” by the media attention she was receiving from being in such a high-profile show. In an interview with the ‘’Walford Gazette’’, Speed commented: “I was very frightened by it quite frankly and certainly unprepared for it. I didn't like at all the attention that came with being on such a high-profile show. It simply wasn't what I signed up for in the first place-all that craziness. I was naive, I admit. Of <b>course</b> <b>it</b> <b>does</b> come with the job of being on the show and {{you have to learn to}} deal with it and cope with it. The advantages always outweigh the drawbacks, anyway, but it didn't seem like that to me at the time. I was very young and extremely shy, so it all became a huge difficulty for me…But I also have to make it clear that from the beginning when I joined, I always intended to stay in it for just a year anyway. I honoured my initial one-year contract and then moved on…they did express their interest in signing me for another year, but I politely but firmly declined. They were a bit shocked. I tried to explain in the best way I could my reasons for leaving at the end of my contract and they ultimately understood, and so I left on good terms with them…I had some growing up to do and instinctively knew that growing up more or less in front of the British public for one year was enough!” ...|$|E
