5|$|In the Middle Ages, {{both in the}} Islamic {{world and}} in Europe, {{agriculture}} was transformed with improved techniques and the diffusion of crop plants, including the introduction of sugar, rice, cotton and fruit trees such as the orange to Europe by way of Al-Andalus. After 1492, the Columbian exchange brought New World <b>crops</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> maize, potatoes, sweet potatoes, and manioc to Europe, and Old World <b>crops</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> wheat, barley, rice, and turnips, and livestock including horses, cattle, sheep, and goats to the Americas.|$|E

5|$|As {{a result}} of the dry climate, timber—a main {{component}} in building earthquake-resistant homes—is scarce in Qayen; homes are instead constructed of adobe. The inhabitants of the poverty-stricken region rely on subsistence farming, raising livestock and <b>crops</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> wheat and saffron. When the earthquake struck, much of the population was already working in the fields; for the most part, these people survived. Many of those treated for injuries were found to be undernourished.|$|E
5|$|Banton has a {{primarily}} agricultural economy, with copra {{farming and}} fishing {{as the main}} sources of livelihood. There is also an indigenous raffia palm handicraft industry. Other crops grown in the island are root <b>crops</b> (<b>such</b> <b>as</b> cassava, sweet potatoes), fruits and vegetables. The locals also engage in livestock raising for local consumption, and small-scale shipbuilding of wooden boats and launches.|$|E
50|$|The {{species are}} {{cultivated}} as a grain or vegetable <b>crop</b> (<b>such</b> <b>as</b> {{in lieu of}} spinach), as well as animal feed in Asia and Africa, whereas in Europe and North America, it is commonly regarded as a weed in places <b>such</b> <b>as</b> potato fields.|$|R

5|$|Cabbage was {{probably}} domesticated later in history than Near Eastern <b>crops</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> lentils and summer wheat. Because {{of the wide}} range of crops developed from the wild B.oleracea, multiple broadly contemporaneous domestications of cabbage may have occurred throughout Europe. Nonheading cabbages and kale were probably the first to be domesticated, before 1000 BC, by the Celts of central and western Europe.|$|E
5|$|Climate-related natural {{disasters}} cause massive losses of Indian life and property. Droughts, flash floods, cyclones, avalanches, landslides {{brought on by}} torrential rains, and snowstorms pose the greatest threats. Other dangers include frequent summer dust storms, which usually track from north to south; they cause extensive property damage in North India and deposit large amounts of dust from arid regions. Hail is also common in parts of India, causing severe damage to standing <b>crops</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> rice and wheat.|$|E
5|$|RNA {{interference}} {{has been}} used for applications in biotechnology and is nearing commercialization in others. RNAi has developed many novel <b>crops</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> nicotinefree tobacco, decaffeinated coffee, nutrient fortified and hypoallergenic crops. The genetically engineered Arctic apples received FDA approval in 2015. The apples were produced by RNAi suppression of PPO (polyphenol oxidase) gene making apple varieties that will not undergo browning after being sliced. PPO-silenced apples are unable to convert chlorogenic acid into quinone product.|$|E
50|$|The {{quality of}} soil in the Coleambally Irrigation Area, {{combined}} with growing a water-intensive <b>crop</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> rice, has led to soil salination and high water table problems throughout the area. Efforts to alleviate the soil salination problem since 1995 have minimised the problem.|$|R
40|$|A {{model of}} {{household}} decision-making in dryland agropastoral systems is presented. This {{is used to}} find the optimal combination of crops and livestock that a farmer will choose to keep, depending on household wealth, {{under the assumption that}} farmers act to minimize their long-term probability of destitution. The farmer can choose to plant a high-risk <b>crop</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> maize, a low-risk <b>crop</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> millet, and to keep goats or cattle. An interaction between these components is modelled involving the use of cattle for draft power. It is shown that very poor farmers will choose to plant maize, whereas cattle are kept only {{if they are to be}} used for draft power, and only by the wealthier farmers.

5|$|According to the International Energy Agency, {{cellulosic}} ethanol biorefineries {{could allow}} biofuels {{to play a}} much bigger role in the future than {{organizations such as the}} IEA previously thought. Cellulosic ethanol can be made from plant matter composed primarily of inedible cellulose fibers that form the stems and branches of most plants. Crop residues (such as corn stalks, wheat straw and rice straw), wood waste, and municipal solid waste are potential sources of cellulosic biomass. Dedicated energy <b>crops,</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> switchgrass, are also promising cellulose sources that can be sustainably produced in many regions.|$|E
5|$|Agriculture {{also made}} up an {{important}} part of the Plymouth economy. The colonists adopted Native American agricultural practices and crops. They planted maize, squash, pumpkins, beans, and potatoes. Besides the crops themselves, the Pilgrims learned productive farming techniques from the Native Americans, such as proper crop rotation and the use of dead fish to fertilize the soil. In addition to these native crops, the colonists also successfully planted Old World <b>crops</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> turnips, carrots, peas, wheat, barley, and oats.|$|E

5|$|Cicadas are not major {{agricultural}} pests {{but in some}} outbreak years, trees may be overwhelmed by the sheer numbers of females laying their eggs in the shoots. Small trees may wilt and larger trees may lose small branches. Although in general, the feeding activities of the nymphs do little damage, during the year before an outbreak of periodic cicadas, the large nymphs feed heavily and plant growth may suffer. Some species have turned from wild grasses to sugar cane, and this has affected the crop adversely, {{and in a few}} isolated cases, females have oviposited on food <b>crops</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> date palms, grape vines, citrus trees, asparagus and cotton.|$|E
5|$|Compared to {{many smaller}} Corvus species (such as American crow), ravens prefer {{undisturbed}} montane or forest habitat or rural areas over urban areas. In other areas, their numbers have increased dramatically {{and they have}} become agricultural pests. Common ravens can cause damage to <b>crops,</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> nuts and grain, or can harm livestock, particularly by killing young goat kids, lambs and calves. Ravens generally attack the faces of young livestock, but the more common raven behaviour of scavenging may be misidentified as predation by ranchers.|$|E
5|$|Home to Aboriginal {{groups for}} over 40,000 years, the Riverina was {{originally}} settled by Europeans in {{the mid-19th century}} as a pastoral region providing beef and wool to markets in Australia and beyond. In the 20th century, the development of major irrigation areas in the Murray and Murrumbidgee valleys {{has led to the}} introduction of <b>crops</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> rice and wine grapes. The Riverina has strong cultural ties to Victoria, and the region was the source of much of the impetus behind the federation of Australian colonies.|$|E

5|$|Native Americans {{occupied}} the river valleys surrounding the Metacomet Ridge {{for at least}} 10,000 years. Major tribal groups active in the area included the Quinnipiac, Niantic, Pequot, Pocomtuc, and Mohegan. Traprock was used to make tools and arrowheads. Natives hunted game, gathered plants and fruits, and fished in local bodies of water around the Metacomet Ridge. Tracts of woodland in the river bottoms surrounding the ridges were sometimes burned to facilitate the cultivation of <b>crops</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> corn, squash, tobacco, and beans.|$|E
5|$|The Mesa Verdeans survived using a {{combination}} of hunting, gathering, and subsistence farming of <b>crops</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> corn, beans, and squash. They built the mesa's first pueblos sometime after 650, {{and by the end of}} the 12th century, they began to construct the massive cliff dwellings for which the park is best known. By 1285, following a period of social and environmental instability driven by a series of severe and prolonged droughts, they abandoned the area and moved south to locations in Arizona and New Mexico, including Rio Chama, Pajarito Plateau, and Santa Fe.|$|E
5|$|The area {{occupied}} by Kent Ridge Park and the National University of Singapore was {{formerly known as}} Pasir Panjang Ridge, and was originally a lowland evergreen rainforest. The park's natural vegetation now consists of groves of Tembusu, Acacias and Dillenias. When the first settlers arrived in Singapore in the early 19th century, they grew <b>crops</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> rubber, pepper, gambier and pineapple on the ridge. During World War II, it {{was used as a}} fortress by the British in the defence of Singapore. Many of these plantations were either abandoned or destroyed during the Japanese Occupation (1942–1945), which allowed such crops to grow wild.|$|E
