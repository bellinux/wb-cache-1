5|$|The British {{government}} was also slow {{in responding to}} requests for <b>compensation.</b> While waiting for a response, {{the question of how}} to use any <b>compensation</b> was debated in provincial newspapers and pamphlets.

Others, including William Douglass and Thomas Hutchinson, speaker of the General Court, favoured using the <b>compensation</b> to redeem the paper currency and give Massachusetts a hard currency. In 1748 the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle returned Louibourg to France, with Massachusetts still awaiting <b>compensation</b> for its seizure.|$|E
30|$|We {{find that}} general {{government}} <b>compensations</b> exercise a long-term impact on manufacturing <b>compensations</b> that is stronger for large public sectors.

By contrast, in the short-run, there is no size effect, with each 1 % increase (fall) in government nominal <b>compensations</b> leading on average to 0.25 % increase (fall) in manufacturing <b>compensations,</b> independently of whether the general government is a large or a small employer, a coefficient that is consistent with results from other studies (Afonso and Gomes 2014).|$|R

30|$|This paper {{assesses the}} {{relationship}} {{between public and private}} wages in the EU, as measured by general government and manufacturing <b>compensations,</b> respectively. We find that the long-run relation between the two is stronger when the government is a large employer. Manufacturing <b>compensations</b> are better aligned with productivity and unemployment when general government <b>compensations,</b> to which they generally respond, are set through bargaining. Finally, manufacturing <b>compensations</b> react in the same way whether those in the general government sector are increased or cut, a relation that seems to hold also under fiscal consolidation provided the government is a large employer.|$|R
30|$|We {{have found}} that there are {{significant}} inter-linkages between <b>compensations</b> in the general government and in the manufacturing sector both in the long and in the short run. The long-run relation between government and manufacturing <b>compensations</b> wages is much stronger when the government is a large employer, a result {{that appears to be}} driven mainly by second-round effects via inflation. The other important finding is that in countries where government wages are set by collective bargaining, manufacturing <b>compensations</b> tend to be better aligned with productivity and to be more responsive to unemployment, possibly because bargaining processes are generally closer to the market than unilateral government decisions. Finally, the reaction of manufacturing <b>compensations</b> to changes in government <b>compensations</b> is found to be symmetric. Such symmetry is unaffected {{by the size of the}} public sector. Nevertheless, under fiscal consolidation episodes, the two nominal <b>compensations</b> are correlated only when the government is a large employer, possibly alluding to the effect on prices and wages of some types of expenditure-based fiscal consolidations.|$|R

5|$|Germanwings' {{parent company}} Lufthansa offered victims' {{families}} an initial aid payment {{of up to}} €50,000, separate from any legally-required <b>compensation</b> for the disaster.

40|$|This paper proposes an {{explanation}} for why efficient reforms are not carried out when losers {{have the power to}} block their implementation, even though compensating them is feasible. We construct a signaling model with two-sided incomplete information in which a government faces the task of sequentially implementing two reforms by bargaining with interest groups. The organization of interest groups is endogenous. <b>Compensations</b> are distortionary and government types differ in the concern about distortions. We show that, when <b>compensations</b> are allowed to be informative about the government’s type, there is a bias against the payment of <b>compensations</b> and the implementation of reforms. This is because paying high <b>compensations</b> today provides incentives for some interest groups to organize and oppose subsequent reforms with the only purpose of receiving a transfer. By paying lower <b>compensations,</b> governments attempt to prevent such interest groups from organizing. However, this comes at the cost of reforms being blocked by interest groups with relatively high losses. reforms, interest grou, comnsations, retation...|$|R

In this article, we identify schemes that reduce the number of innocent-pleas without affecting guilty individuals 2 ̆ 7 plea-bargain incentives. Large <b>compensations</b> for exonerees reduce expected costs associated with wrongful determinations of guilt in trial and thereby reduce the number of innocent-pleas. Any distortions in guilty individuals 2 ̆ 7 incentives to take plea bargains caused by these <b>compensations</b> can be off-set by a small increase in the discounts offered for pleading guilty. Although there are many statutory reform proposals for increasing exoneration <b>compensations,</b> no one has yet noted this desirable separating effect of exoneree <b>compensations.</b> We argue that such reforms are likely to achieve this result without causing deterrence losses...|$|R

5|$|Johnson {{believed}} that Congressional business was too slow and tedious, {{and that the}} per diem system of <b>compensation</b> encouraged delays {{on the part of}} members. To remedy this, he sponsored the <b>Compensation</b> Act of 1816. The measure proposed paying annual salaries of $1,500 to congressmen rather than a $6 per diem for the days the body was in session. (At the time, this had the effect of increasing the total <b>compensation</b> from about $900 to $1500. Johnson noted that congressmen had not had a pay increase in 27 years, and that $1500 was less than the salaries of the 28 clerks employed by the government.)

We focus specifically on the spill over of government to manufacturing <b>compensations</b> so as to address the question of the possible effects of certain fiscal policy measures on cost competitiveness via the supply side. Moreover, attention is devoted to the manufacturing sector because much of the literature on wage leadership is indeed concerned with the signalling that comes from wage bargainers in the manufacturing sector. Our estimation strategy aims at determining the strength of the relation between sectoral <b>compensations</b> across government sectors of different size, at assessing whether the way in which government <b>compensations</b> are set has any impact {{on the nature of the}} interaction with the private traded sector, and finally at establishing whether such relation is symmetric holding both when government <b>compensations</b> are increased and when cut and whether periods of large cuts (or fiscal consolidations) make a difference. Whilst our focus is on the relation going from general government to manufacturing <b>compensations,</b> we nonetheless also assess interactions in the opposite direction as a way of validating our results.|$|R

This result may allude to the fact that any bargaining process is “closer to the market” than unilateral government decision and hence closer to what might happen in the private tradable sector.|$|R
