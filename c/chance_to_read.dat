5|$|In May 2009, Chris Hemsworth was in {{negotiations}} {{to portray the}} title role after a back-and-forth {{process in which the}} 25-year-old actor was refused early on, then given a second <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> for the part. Hemsworth's brother, Liam also auditioned for the role, but was passed on by Marvel Studios head Kevin Feige. The next day, Marvel announced that Tom Hiddleston, who had worked with Branagh before and had initially been considered to portray the lead role, had been cast as Loki. In June 2009, Feige confirmed that both Hemsworth and Hiddleston had signed on. Feige mentioned that the film would take place on both modern day Earth and Asgard but Thor's human host, Dr. Donald Blake, would not be included. In July 2009, Marvel announced that Natalie Portman would portray Jane Foster. Jaimie Alexander and Colm Feore were reported to have joined the cast in September, with Alexander portraying Sif and Feore's role unrevealed, though it was thought to be a villain. In an interview with Swedish news site Ystads Allehanda, Stellan Skarsgård stated that he had joined the cast, though he did not specify his role. By late October Anthony Hopkins had been cast as Odin in the film. The following month, Marvel announced that they had cast the Warriors Three; Fandral was to be played by Stuart Townsend, Hogun was to be played by Tadanobu Asano and Volstagg was to be played by Ray Stevenson. Idris Elba was announced to have joined the cast, portraying Heimdall. Natalie Portman revealed that Kat Dennings would be involved in the project, portraying Darcy, a coworker of Portman's Jane Foster.|$|E

500|$|A student, a sacristan and Abel Carvajal, {{together}} in a prison cell, talk because they are [...] "terrified of the silence" [...] and [...] "terrified of the darkness". Carvajal's wife runs all over town, visiting the President and influential figures such as the Judge Advocate, begging for her husband's release because she is left in the dark regarding {{what has happened to}} him. Carvajal is given a <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> his indictment but, unable to defend himself against falsified evidence, is sentenced to execution.|$|E
500|$|Eleanor Roosevelt {{objected to}} the casting of Lionel Barrymore as her late husband, due to {{political}} remarks that Barrymore had made about the president in 1944. Marx delayed Barrymore's scenes while she had a <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> and respond to a letter Barrymore sent her explaining that his remarks had been misinterpreted, {{but she was not}} placated, and Barrymore was replaced in the role by Godfrey Tearle. The War Department and the White House reviewed the script, and both asked for changes. The Army had objected to a scene in which an Army major made a pass at a girl and it was cut from the film, as the Army felt that this was poor conduct for an officer.|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} filmed at a former Chili's in the San Fernando Valley, {{in the city}} of Burbank. The episode was filmed [...] "from dawn, until very late at night", {{according}} to Kaling. During filming breaks, Kaling later joked that she took [...] "ladylike" [...] naps, while Paul Lieberstein made notes on the episode and its script. While filming, many parts of the script were changed so the restaurant would allow the shoot to continue. For instance, in the original script, Pam vomits at Chili's and Dwight responds, [...] "A woman has vomited!" [...] Because the completed script was not available for Chili's to review until shooting had already started, when they were finally given a <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> it, they objected to a customer vomiting in their restaurant. Chili's withdrew its permission to shoot, but, after a few hours, Steve Carell developed a compromise: Pam would fall off her bar stool and Dwight would respond, [...] "A woman has had a seizure!" [...] In the original version, Pam was also to be over-served alcohol by the Chili's staff, but Chili's—feeling that this would reflect poorly on their character as a company—did not want this in the episode either. To solve this issue, the writers had Pam steal drinks off other tables. The writers and producers also agreed to include a scene in which the actual owner of the Chili's restaurant (Jon Bosshart, not an actor) makes it clear that the restaurant does not over-serve alcohol to its customers. [...] Since Jenna Fischer does not drink much in real life, B. J. Novak took her out so she could get drunk while Novak described to her how she was behaving and how it did not match her own perception. She drew upon this experience for her performance.|$|E

5000|$|The most {{accepted}} current {{theory of}} literacy development {{in young children}} is that of emergent literacy, which posits that a child “acquires some knowledge about language, reading, and writing before coming to school.” Literacy skills are acquired “through meaningful and functional experiences that {{require the use of}} literacy in natural settings.” Overall, “a rich literacy environment at home gives children a good <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> learn <b>to</b> <b>read</b> and write easily and <b>to</b> enjoy <b>reading</b> and writing as well.” ...|$|R

Shortly after graduation, when his roommate accused him of stealing a watch, May was jailed in Chemnitz for six weeks and his license to teach was permanently revoked. After this, May worked with little success as a private tutor, an author of tales, a composer and a public speaker. For four years, from 1865 to 1869, May was jailed in the workhouse at Osterstein Castle, Zwickau. With good behaviour, May became an administrator of the prison library which gave him the <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> widely. He made a list of the works he planned to write (Repertorium C.

2500|$|John Houston {{arrived in}} Fort George {{in the fall}} of 1909 and bought {{property}} in South Fort George and began the Fort George Tribune. The first edition was published on November 6, 1909. Unfortunately, other than land claims notices there was little local news for his paper to report. In 1909, South Fort George was a First Nations village, a sawmill and a Hudson's Bay Store. Less than a dozen new residents lived in the infant town-site in tent shacks. [...] The Grand Trunk Pacific Railway, John's favorite villain, was still far away: not even across the Alberta/BC border on the eastern end of construction, and the construction from the western end at Prince Rupert had just begun. John's South Fort George articles were often humorous and included notices as to whose cow recently had a calf and what he'd had to pay for eggs that week. He commented in one article about how his socks often froze to the floor while he sat at his printing press and worked on the newspaper. Nevertheless, whether there was little news to report or not, John was a busy man from November 1909 to March 1910. He responded to approximately 300 letters a month, written mostly by parties interested in purchasing land in the area, and he was working on formulating a platform for the Liberal Party. In March 1910, the work and excessively cold caught up with him and John contracted pneumonia and was pulled on a toboggan down the Blackwater Trail to the Quesnel hospital by his friend and fellow pioneer settler, William J Cooke. John died on March 8 at the hospital in Quesnel, but not before he got a <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> his own obituary, one printed in error by the Vancouver Province. His nurse, knowing his sense of humor, showed him the article, and he supposedly joked that he respected the paper and that they didn't need to make a correction because he was planning on making good on their story. John was laid to rest in Nelson, where there is a memorial in his honor.|$|E

By this time, Emma and he had two children, Joan (1908-1972), who later married the Tarzan film actor James Pierce, and Hulbert (1909-1991). During this period, he had copious spare time and began reading pulp-fiction magazines. In 1929, he recalled thinking that ...if people were paid for writing rot such as I read in some of those magazines, that I could write stories just as rotten. As a matter of fact, although I had never written a story, I knew absolutely that I could write stories just as entertaining and probably a whole lot more so than any I <b>chanced</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> in those magazines.|$|R
