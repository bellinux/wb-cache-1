40|$|Investigations were {{conducted}} by the U. S. Bureau of Mines to develop flowsheets for the recovery of tungsten and gold from four Alaskan scheelite-bearing ores. Basic gravity concentration and cyanide leach tests were performed on all samples. About 46 pct of the tungsten and 30 pct of the gold from one sample were recovered in a gravity concentrate containing 24 pet W 03 (tungstic oxide) and 119 troy ounces per short ton (tr oz/st) Au. Froth flotation of the gravity concentrate resulted in separate tungsten and gold products with grades of 38 pct W 03 and 2, 720 tr oz/st Au and recoveries of 60 and 97 pet, respectively. Additional gold was recovered from the gravity and flotation tailings by cyanidation. Overall recoveries of tungsten and gold from this sample were 28 and 94 pet, respeetively. A flowsheet with mill design parameters was developed that consisted of (1) free gold and scheelite recovery by gravity methods and froth flotation and (2) fme-grained gold recovery by cyanide leaching of reground gravity and flotation tailings, followed by a carbon-in-pulp (<b>CIP)</b> <b>circuit.</b> Data were developed from the Bond mill work index, gold and tungsten flotation, conventional and high-rate thickening, cyanide leaching, and CIP adsorption tests...|$|E

The efficiency of a <b>CIP</b> <b>circuit</b> mainly depends on the effectiveness ofthe adsorption section as it not only determines the amount of soluble gold lost in the residues, but also indirectly affects {{the function of the}} other processes in the plant. Research in this area has declined {{over the past few years}} as a result of a decrease in the gold price. It is now more than ever important to investigate the operating conditions ofthe adsorption process to ensure that a highly effective system is maintained. The adsorption of gold cyanide onto activated carbon is to a large extent dependent on maintaining operating conditions well above those of equilibrium. The Freundlich and the Langmuir isotherms have been used by many researchers to describe the equilibrium conditions of the adsorption process. The general practice in the carbonin- pulp technology is to use an isotherm for the prediction of a circuit's performance. As confidence has increased in the reliability of these predictions, it has become important to acquire knowledge of the equilibrium condition that is driving the process. Previous research findings have indicated that the equilibrium isotherm of gold cyanide adsorption onto activated carbon is influenced by changes in the adsorption conditions down the adsorption train. This equilibrium or isotherm shift may lead to errors in the prediction of gold adsorption rates, which results in the filct that the simulations of the performance of the CIP circuits are not reliable...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (MTech (Chemical Engineering)) [...] Cape Technikon, Cape Town, 1999 Carbon-in-pulp (CIP) and {{carbon-in-leach}} (CIL) {{remain the}} most effective, and widely used processes for gold recovery from cyanided pulps. The {{extensive use of}} carbon in such processes have prompted many researchers to investigate the mechanism of metal cyanide adsorption. Not only has this provided many viable theories {{in the understanding of}} the mechanism, but it has also led to an improved understanding {{of the effects of the}} various operating conditions on the <b>CIP</b> <b>circuit.</b> However, the declining gold price has made gold producers aware of the need to either further optimise existing circuits or find alternative means of operation so as to improve efficiency. It is therefore the aim of this study to investigate the factors which influence the metal extraction circuit. In this study the effects of parameters such as gold and carbon concentrations, slurry density and stirring speed on the adsorption process were investigated. It was found that the effects of gold and carbon concentrations could be determined directly, that is, a definite linear relationship exists between these two parameters and adsorption rate. However, slurry density and stirring speed (power input) have a twofold effect on the process. For this reason two distinct terms called the "blinding" and "mixing" numbers have been identified. It has been shown that all the parameters investigated influences the rate of adsorption during the constant rate adsorption period. However, only solution concentration, carbon concentration and carbon loading influence the process during the diminishing rate of adsorption. This confirmed the belief that intraparticle diffusion is the rate controlling factor during the diminishing rate period. Furthermore, the point at which constant rate adsorption is replaced by the diminishing rate of adsorption is mainly a function of solution concentration...|$|E

40|$|Despite major {{advances}} in the practical use of the carbon-in-pulp (CIP) process, the dynamics of this process are still poorly understood by operating staff. Moreover, the many features of existing models for the CIP process are frequently not appreciated by production personnel. It is {{the aim of this}} paper to review and compare existing empirical and fundamental models, and to identify areas for further development work. Empirical methods, such as the classic and widely used Fleming & Nicol model, are conceptually simple but rather limited in their applicability. Also, it is sometimes impossible to attach any practical significance to the values of their parameters. On the other hand, the more rigorous fundamental models are computationally more complex, but more generally based. Most of these models involve the simultaneous solution of initial value or boundary value problems. In pulps with a low concentration of gold or silver, a simple film diffusion model may be adequate. However, if the process is characterised by incomplete leaching, severe preg-robbing, fouling of the carbon by organics and inorganic precipitates, competitive adsorption by base metal cyanides, or high loadings of gold or silver, then a more complex model may be required. This paper explains how these phenomena could be accounted for in material balance equations. Relatively simple models, however, could be used to study the interaction between the leaching, adsorption, elution and regeneration sections with a view to determine optimal operating conditions. As in the case of adsorption models, such scope still exists for R&D on elution and the development of simulation models for desorption. The transport phenomena associated with the pre-treatment step in AARL elution deserves special attention in this regard. Furthermore, very little work has been published on the modelling of the regeneration step in a <b>CIP</b> <b>circuit.</b> With the development of knowledge-based system (KBS) modelling, new avenues have been opened to the simulation of complex adsorption processes.
