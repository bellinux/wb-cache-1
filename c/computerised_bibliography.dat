40|$|In {{this paper}} I {{want to look}} at a range of {{approaches}} to discourse analysis with a view not to describing any of them in detail but to seeing how they relate {{to each other in the}} discipline. Surveys are a necessary evil at best; they inevitably offend by simplification and omission and ometimes by distortion as well. Despite my best endeavours, this survey is unlikely to be any exception. By way of compensation the latter part of the paper attempts a tentative characterisation of the place of discourse studies within linguistics in general and seeks to suggest why there are differences in focus between such studies; if this part of the paper offends, it will at least offend by commission. Discourse analysis has become over the past few years one of the growth areas of modern linguistics. As a result there is now far more being written every year than any person could possibly read. In estimates prepared for an inter-University working party on a <b>computerised</b> <b>bibliography</b> of ESP and Discourse Analysis, Hoey & de Escorcia reported that in 1981 an estimated 5, 000 papers and 200 books were published on discourse. A consequence of this growth has been a parallel growth in terminological distinctions, reflected most schismatically perhaps in the two labels given to the sub-discipline(s) we study - discourse analysis and textlinguistics.

40|$|The {{prevailing}} {{uncertainty about}} the pharmacoeconomic positioning of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) in the prevention and treatment of chemotherapy-induced febrile neutropenia {{has resulted in a}} number of pharmacoeconomic evaluations published in the past 10 years. These studies vary considerably regarding the approaches used and the results presented. In order to contribute to a clearer pharmacoeconomic positioning of G-CSF, a systematic review of economic evaluations was carried out. The focus of the review was prophylaxis and therapy of chemotherapy-induced neutropenia in patients with cancer. A <b>computerised</b> <b>bibliography</b> search of several databases was conducted yielding 33 studies. The findings demonstrated the cost-saving potential of G-CSF in standard-dose chemotherapy to be limited, with lower costs often seen in the control group. The results of these studies were too heterogeneous to extract a clear recommendation from a cost-saving point of view. The administration of G-CSF after high-dose chemotherapy with stem cell support resulted more often in cost savings in the G-CSF group as compared with standard-dose chemotherapy, illustrating a possible cost-saving potential of G-CSF. In the treatment of established chemotherapy-induced febrile neutropenia, cost savings were found in all studies. This result is surprising but hampered by the small number of studies (n = 5) and remains to be confirmed by more rigourously designed prospective economic analyses. Despite the substantial research on this topic, the economic evaluation of G-CSF is far from being settled and needs further investigation.

40|$|A {{systematic}} review of recent economic evaluations of antenatal screening was conducted. Relevant studies were identified {{from a number}} of sources including <b>computerised</b> databases, <b>bibliographies</b> of economic evaluations, and searches of unpublished manuscripts. Each study identified by the literature searches was categorised {{on the basis of its}} title and abstract. Studies considered relevant to the {{systematic review}} were obtained from libraries. The methodology, results, and policy implications of studies categorised as economic evaluations upon full review were documented. A total of 566 studies were identified by the literature searches, 41 of which were categorised as economic evaluations upon full review. The economic evaluations covered a range of antenatal screening practices, aimed mainly at the prevention of infectious diseases and fetal anomalies. The review highlighted the poor methodological quality of the bulk of economic evaluations of antenatal screening. The study design, data collection methods, and analysis and interpretation of results frequently violated methodological guidelines adopted by health economists. The review also highlighted the narrow definition of benefits adopted by this body of literature, with most studies reporting outcomes in terms of cases detected, cases of particular disorders prevented or, most often, costs averted. The conclusions arrived at differed by area of antenatal screening. There appeared to be clear economic arguments in favour of some forms of antenatal screening, for example, triple test screening for Down's syndrome. Other economic evaluations pertained to specific locations, which suggests that the results may not necessarily be generalisable to different settings. For all areas of antenatal screening, an updating of published economic evaluations may be required to account for evolving economic, epidemiological, and clinical effectiveness evidence. ...|$|R
40|$|Background: In {{the process}} of {{scientific}} communication information get exchanged and scientific publishing plays a dominant role. Publishing of the scientific research results is a basic characteristic of the scientific communication. Methods: We analysed publications from the period 1992 – 2003 {{in the field of}} biomedicine in Slovenia. We used the <b>computerised</b> Slovenian national <b>bibliography</b> for the field of biomedical sciences Biomedicina Slovenica. Number of publications were compared to the funds earmarked by the Ministry of Education, Science and Sport in the period 1992 – 2003. Results: In the targeted period the highest increase of published articles was observed with conference contributions. As far as English articles were concerned, they appeared most frequently in magazines. Articles published in congress miscellanies followed. A comparison between Slovenian and English publications showed that the latter prevailed only with original scientific articles. Conclusions: Using this study, we concluded there is no prevailing correlation pattern between the number of publications and amount of funds earmarked by the Ministry of Education, Science and Sport for research infrastructure. </p...|$|R
