[...] For each class of license, the <b>code</b> <b>group</b> speed requirement is slower than the plain language text requirement.

30|$|The {{final phase}} of coding {{consisted}} of evaluating and comparing the <b>code</b> <b>groups</b> and further combining them to create categories. <b>Code</b> <b>groups</b> represented distinct portions of students’ talk during the interviews. However, quotations within those <b>code</b> <b>groups</b> often co-occurred. This means a single quotation could be assigned more than one <b>code</b> and/or <b>code</b> <b>groups.</b> Consequently, <b>code</b> co-occurrence was used to gauge the level of association between the categories that comprised the final emergent model. Using the patterns of code co-occurrences and my interpretations of how participants talked about key topics also helped determine the semantic relationships between categories and also to inform {{the construction of the}} model.|$|R

2500|$|Through May 2013, the First, Second, and Third Class (commercial) Radiotelegraph Licenses using code tests {{based upon}} the CODEX {{standard}} word were still being issued in the United States by the Federal Communications Commission. [...] The First Class license required 20 WPM <b>code</b> <b>group</b> and 25 WPM text code proficiency, the others 16 WPM <b>code</b> <b>group</b> test (five letter blocks sent as simulation of receiving encrypted text) and 20 WPM code text (plain language) test. [...] It was also necessary to pass written tests on operating practice and electronics theory. [...] A unique additional demand for the First Class was a requirement of a year of experience for operators of shipboard and coast stations using Morse. [...] This allowed the holder to be chief operator on board a passenger ship. [...] However, since 1999 the use of satellite and very high-frequency maritime communications systems (GMDSS) has made them obsolete. [...] (By that point meeting experience requirement for the First was very difficult.) [...] Currently, only one class of license, the Radiotelegraph Operator License, is issued. [...] This is granted either when the tests are passed or as the Second and First are renewed and become this lifetime license. [...] For new applicants, it requires passing a written examination on electronic theory and radiotelegraphy practices, as well as 16 WPM codegroup and 20 WPM text tests. [...] However, the code exams are currently waived for holders of Amateur Extra Class licenses who obtained their operating privileges under the old 20 WPM test requirement.|$|E

50|$|As can be {{seen from}} the {{description}} of Yardley's original break into the <b>code,</b> <b>groups</b> were assigned to kana like “do” and “bo” which in Japanese are not part of the regular alphabet but are created from other kana by adding pronunciation marks.

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, we {{consider}} the distributed source coding problem with a joint distortion criterion. We use random structured codes, specifically nested Abelian <b>group</b> <b>codes</b> to achieve a new inner bound to the rate-distortion region. For certain sources, this inner bound is strictly larger than other known rate regions. This shows that structured quantization followed by structured binning is sufficient to achieve the Berger-Tung rate region. Furthermore, we define the notion of “nested random/group codes ” in which the inner <b>code</b> is a <b>group</b> <b>code</b> and the outer code is a random code such that the quantization operation is a random vector quantization and the binning operation is structured. We use random/group codes to improve upon the rate region achieved using nested <b>group</b> <b>codes.</b> We define two fundamental quantities of Abelian group codes: the “channel <b>coding</b> <b>group</b> entropy ” and the “source <b>coding</b> <b>group</b> entropy ” to present the achievable rate region.

50|$|Code books contain two lists --- one of code {{groups and}} one of {{plaintext}} letters, words, and phrases. Someone encoding a message looks up {{the words in the}} plaintext list and substitutes the corresponding <b>code</b> <b>group.</b> Obviously it is important for that person's sanity that the plaintext be in some sort of order so words can be looked up easily. Since the system is similar for decoding --- look up the <b>code</b> <b>group</b> and substitute the plaintext --- it is equally important to have the code groups in order as well. With a one-part code, both lists are in alphabetical (or numerical) order. This means that you can encode and decode using the same book.|$|E
