5000|$|Until 2004, Visa and MasterCard rules {{prohibited}} issuers {{of their}} cards from issuing American Express {{cards in the}} United States.

Second, comparing subsidiaries and branches, estimated distributions across banks have been relatively similar for Interbank Loans but have become rather different for Interbank Deposits. For <b>Customer</b> <b>Loans</b> and Customer Deposits, the differences across groups are generally greater, especially for Customer Deposits.

40|$|This paper investigates {{interest}} rate risk exposures of listed euro area banks which fall under the Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM). We analyze the period 2005 to 2014, as it includes times of very low {{interest rate}}s in which banks may have pursued a more risky maturity transformation strategy. First, we use the Bayesian DCC M-GARCH model to assess banks' stock price sensitivities to principal components {{of changes in the}} yield curve describing shifts in its level, slope and curvature. Second, we investigate how these sensitivities vary depending on bank-level characteristics (e. g., balance sheet composition, reliance on interest income). Our findings reveal that, on average, banks benefit from positive level shifts and steepening yield curves. Curvature changes affect banks' share prices as well, particularly in times of crises. Further, these sensitivities change in time and depend heavily on the bank's business model and balance sheet composition. Our analysis reveals that banks with larger balance sheets, higher capital ratios, higher parts of <b>customer</b> <b>loans</b> and lower parts of deposits are particularly sensitive to interest rate movements...|$|E
40|$|Synopsis and {{introduction}} Interest {{income is}} {{the main source of}} income to commercial banks. The assignment of interest income to banking products is called funds transfer pricing. Traditionally, funds transfer pricing systems were tost-based; the transfer rate was based on the average costs of funds. In the seventies the shortcomings of a tost-based transfer rate were recognized and a market-based funds transfer rate was suggested as a solution (Haskins & Sells 1972, 174). At that time a single, short-term market rate was suggested as the funds transfer rate for al 1 funds (ibid). Altbough it was recognized that a single market rate did not reflect differences in maturity and interest rate risk (Tewes 1976, 32), no further efforts were initiated to overcome these shortcomings. In Germany, on the contrary, a lot of effort has been devoted {{to the development of a}} funds transfer pricing system that supports the planning and control of <b>customer</b> <b>loans</b> and deposits. The first publications explicitly articulating the need for a market-oriented funds transfer pricing system date fiom 1982. From that moment on many articles and books on this subject were published, and the Marktzinsmethode was developed. Since the Marktzinsmethud...|$|E

40|$|While {{development}} of sound, market-oriented banking systems {{is fundamental to}} the transition, bank intermediation remains stunted after {{a decade or more}} of reform. This paper examines the impact of banking and enterprise reforms and other factors on banking development in transition economies at both the aggregate level and that of individual banks. A unique contribution of the paper is the analysis of a new panel data set of 515 banks in 16 transition economies for the years 1994 - 99. The analyses show that progress in banking reform is {{the sine qua non of}} banking development. However, even where banking reforms have advanced, the real expansion of bank loans has failed to keep pace with output growth. There is significant evidence that privatised banks and those with higher capital-asset ratios are expanding more rapidly than state-owned banks and ab initio private banks. While foreignmajority ownership of a bank is associated with neither stronger nor weaker real growth in its <b>customer</b> <b>loans,</b> a greater presence of foreign banks in a banking system has a positive spillover effect in spurring the real expansion of loans. These results contrast with evidence from the transition economies of relatively strong growth performance by ab initio private and foreign-owned enterprises in the non-financial sectors. Taken together, the findings point to the need for policies that can strengthen supply response of banks to progress in banking and enterprise reforms. These measures include the more effective regulation of the entry and exit of banks, removal of obstacles to the expansion of foreign-owned banks and the transfer of technology and banking skills that expand access to finance, particularly by small and medium-sized enterprises.

40|$|The ongoing {{globalisation}} has {{not stopped}} short of the banking sector. From a political point of view wide voiced concerns {{about the effect of}} such banking globalisation have arisen. From a scientific perspective, one of the open points left for dicussion, is the question which factors shape banks' internationalisation strategies. Additionally, a large literature has recently started to discuss optimal entry modes into international markets in general. This thesis offers four chapters for insight on each of these topics. A case study on Bank Austria in Eastern Europe is presented, yielding insights on bank internationalisation strategies. One key finding is, that the optimal entry mode for banks seems to be closely tied to the banking segment (retail versus wholesale banking) the respective bank operates in. Additionally the thesis offers a theoretical chapter on the optimal entry mode of firms into foreign markets in a world of sequential entry. The primary result of the model is, that Greenfield Investment is an undervalued mode of entry, because it reduces the likelihood of further sequential entry. An open question on when banks follow their customers abroad is also discussed {{with the help of a}} theoretical model. I find that whether banks follow their customers abroad or not depends on the riskiness of respective <b>customer</b> <b>loans,</b> both from a customer cash flow point of view as well as a political risk of blocked repayment transfers by local governments abroad. A wide-voiced concern that smaller enterprises suffer in their ability to source finance from banks as the banking sector consolidates is finally discussed. Such a threat is indeed found in a theoretical analysis, as increased layers of hierarchy in consolidated institutions lead to a likely stop of loan provision to smaller companies within the bank, while due to the relationship-based lending nature of small firm bank finance, the likelihood that another bank acts as a new lender to the small firm set free is low.

40|$|On 6 September 2016, the Minister for Small Business, the Hon. Michael McCormack MP, tasked the Australian Small Business and Family Enterprise Ombudsman with {{undertaking}} {{an inquiry}} into {{the adequacy of the}} law and practices governing financial lending to small businesses. Consistent with other inquiries, the Ombudsman finds almost complete asymmetry of power in the relationship between banks and small business borrowers. This manifests itself in: • extremely complex, one-sided contracts that yield maximum power to banks to make unilateral changes whenever they like and without the agreement of borrowers • inadequate timeframes around key loan milestones that leave borrowers vulnerable • misleading and conflicting signals between bank sales staff and credit risk staff which leaves borrowers vulnerable • lack of transparency and potential conflict of interest in dealings with third parties involved in impaired loan processes, such as valuers, investigative accountant and receivers • significant gaps in access to justice with nowhere to go except the court system, with borrowers having limited resources and banks having overwhelming resources. Since the global financial crisis (GFC), 17 inquiries and reviews have been held and more than 40 recommendations made relating to small business and banking practices. Despite borrowers and stakeholders persistently raising the same issues, the banking industry has taken little action. The Inquiry reviewed a selection of cases submitted to the Parliamentary Joint Committee Inquiry into the Impairment of <b>Customer</b> <b>Loans.</b> About a third of these cases were simply poor business decisions where the bank appears to have acted reasonably, a third a mixture of poor business decisions and poor bank practice and a third with very real issues where bank conduct is unacceptable and possibly unconscionable. The recommendations raised in this report, which also support the initial findings of the Ramsay Review Interim Report, will address these issues going forward. For past cases, where there is a genuine concern, {{there needs to be a}} specific approach to seek a remedy which will allow these bank customers to put their case and to obtain compensation that is binding on the banks.
