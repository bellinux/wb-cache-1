Each wing has a central axis, {{composed}} of three limb bones, the humerus, ulna and radius. The hand, or manus, which ancestrally was composed of five digits, is reduced to three digits (digit II, III and IV or I, II, III depending on the scheme followed), which serves as an anchor for the , one of two groups of flight feathers responsible for the wing's airfoil shape. The other set of flight feathers, behind the <b>carpal</b> <b>joint</b> on the ulna, are called the [...] The remaining feathers on the wing are known as , of which there are three sets. The wing sometimes has vestigial claws. In most species these are lost by the time the bird is adult (such as the highly visible ones used for active climbing by hoatzin chicks), but claws are retained into adulthood by the secretarybird, screamers, finfoots, ostriches, several swifts and numerous others, as a local trait, in a few specimens. Most kinds of bird wings can be grouped into four types, with some falling between two of these types: i) elliptical wings—short and rounded, having a low aspect ratio, allowing for tight maneuvering in confined spaces such as might be found in dense vegetation, which are common in forest raptors and many migratory species of passerines, and species that use a rapid take off to evade predators, such as pheasants and partridges; ii) high speed wings—short, pointed wings that when combined with a heavy wing loading and rapid wingbeats provide an energetically expensive high speed, used by the bird with the fastest wing speed, the peregrine falcon, as well as by most of the ducks and the auks who uses the shape for a different purpose, to [...] "fly" [...] underwater; iii) high aspect ratio wings—typified by low wing loading and which are far longer than they are wide, they are used for slower flight which may take the form of almost hovering (as used by kestrels, terns and nightjars) or in soaring and gliding flight, particularly the dynamic soaring used by seabirds, which takes advantage of wind speed variation at different altitudes (wind shear) above ocean waves to provide lift; and iv) soaring wings with deep slots—common in larger species of inland birds, such as eagles, vultures, pelicans, and storks, the slots {{at the end of the}} wings, between the primaries, reduce the induced drag and wingtip vortices, whilst the shorter size of the wings aids in takeoff (high aspect ratio wings require a long taxi to get airborne).|$|E

40|$|SummaryObjectivesValidate use of {{a commercially}} {{available}} immunoassay for measurement of bone alkaline phosphatase (BAP) in equine serum and synovial fluid (SF), and investigate the effects of osteochondral (OC) injury in horses on BAP concentrations in serum and SF. MethodsSF was collected from 37 joints of 34 Thoroughbred (TB) racehorses undergoing arthroscopic surgery {{for the removal of}} OC fragments from either the <b>carpal</b> <b>joints</b> (n= 18) or the metacarpo-/metatarsophalangeal (MP) joints (n= 19). SF was also obtained from 52 joints of 16 normal TB horses, collected bilaterally from <b>carpal</b> <b>joints</b> of 10 horses (n= 40), and MP joints of six horses (n= 12). Blood was obtained from all 50 horses. A commercially available immunoassay was validated and subsequently used to determine equine serum and SF BAP concentrations. Correlations to radiographic and arthroscopic scores were assessed. ResultsBAP concentrations were significantly lower in serum from horses with OC injury in their <b>carpal</b> or MP <b>joints</b> than in serum from normal horses. SF BAP concentrations in normal and OC injured <b>carpal</b> <b>joints</b> were significantly higher than MP joints. BAP concentrations were significantly higher in SF from OC injured <b>carpal</b> <b>joints</b> than normal. BAP concentrations were affected by joint sampled, with age having a significant interaction. Concentrations of BAP in the serum (22 U/L) and a ratio of SF to serum ≥ 0. 5 were predictive of OC injury. Radiographic and arthroscopic scores significantly correlated with serum BAP concentrations, and SF:serum BAP correlated with arthroscopic scores. ConclusionsDetermination of serum and SF BAP concentrations may be beneficial in the investigation of early joint injury. Joint and injury dependent differences in BAP concentrations allowed the estimation of predictive value for identifying OC injury...|$|R

40|$|The {{testing of}} {{accessory}} motion {{has become a}} very important part of manual therapy practice. Its value is in assessing whether joint mobility is ideal or impaired. Despite its use, there is little evidence in the literature to support the reliability of such testing. Most of the research carried out on accessory motion testing has focused on the spine. In view of this we decided to evaluate the intra- and interrater reliability of accessory motion testing of <b>carpal</b> <b>joints.</b> Two skilled therapists tested the available motion and the end-feel response of <b>carpal</b> <b>joints</b> in 30 students and 15 patients on two separate occasions. Pain scores were also obtained. In students a moderate to good percentage of agreement [67 - 97 %] was obtained for motion testing. In patients the percentage of agreement ranged from 60 % to 100 % and weighted kappa values were between 0. 33 and 1. 0. Intrarater reliability was better than interrater reliability in both groups. Intra- and interrater agreement on end-feel was very good. Overall, the reliability of accessory motion testing of <b>carpal</b> <b>joints</b> was acceptable.

40|$|Objective: To further {{simplify the}} Simple Erosion Narrowing Score (SENS) by {{removing}} scored areas that contribute least to its measurement precision according to Item Response Theory (IRT) based analysis and {{to compare the}} measurement performance of the simplified version to the original. Methods: Baseline and 18 months data of the ‘Combinatietherapie bij reumatoide artritis’ (COBRA) trial were modelled using longitudinal IRT methodology. Measurement precision was evaluated across different levels of structural damage. SENS was further simplified by omitting the least reliably scored areas. Discriminant validity of SENS and its simplification was studied by comparing their ability to differentiate between the COBRA and SSZ arm. Responsiveness was studied by comparing standardized change scores between versions. Results: SENS data showed good fit to the IRT model. <b>Carpal</b> and feet <b>joints</b> contributed least statistical information to both erosion and joint space narrowing scores. Omitting the joints of the foot reduced measurement precision for the erosion score in cases with below average levels of structural damage (relative efficiency compared with the original version ranged 35 %- 59 %). Omitting the <b>carpal</b> <b>joints</b> had minimal effect on precision (relative efficiency range 77 %- 88 %). Responsiveness of a simplified SENS without <b>carpal</b> <b>joints</b> closely approximated the original version (i. e., all ∆ standardized change scores ≤ 0. 06). Discriminant validity was also similar between versions for both the erosion score (relative efficiency = 97 %) and the SENS total score (relative efficiency = 84 %).

The joint space narrowing (JSN) of <b>carpal</b> <b>joints</b> on bilateral hand radiographs was assessed by our computer-based method, using the Sharp/ van der Heijde method as the standard of reference. We compared the JSDI of joints with JSN progression in the follow-up period with that of those without JSN progression.
