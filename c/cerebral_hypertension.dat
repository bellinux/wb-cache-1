40|$|In diffuse or focal primary <b>cerebral</b> venous <b>hypertension</b> such as sinus {{thrombosis}} or operative {{obstruction of}} a major cerebral vein, a severe brain edema associated with frequent hemorrhagic infarction is a common clinical feature. However, pathophysiological changes in the brain tissue characterizing injuries following <b>cerebral</b> venous <b>hypertension</b> have been so far poorly understood, mainly because of an unavailability of a proper experimental model, particularly of small animals in which evaluation of regional changes can be performed using histochemical methods. In order to establish such a model, the author examined several methods for possible production of <b>cerebral</b> venous <b>hypertension</b> in the rat. Among the various methods, retrograde embolization with an autologous blood clot through the external jugular vein was found to constantly produce <b>cerebral</b> venous <b>hypertension</b> with a superior sagittal sinus pressure ranging from 28 to 102 mmHg. Pathophysiological features such as cerebral blood flow, metabolic abnormality and capillary permeability and histopathological findings were examined in this model. The measurement of cerebral blood flow with the autoradiographic method using 14 C-iodoantipyrine revealed that a localized area of decreased blood flow {{first appeared in the}} parasagittal cortex in 15 minutes following the elevation of cerebral venous pressure. A widespread hypoperfused area was observed involving the white matter and basal ganglia after the venous hypertension was sustained for 30 minutes. Cerebral metabolic abnormality assessed by the measurement of NADH fluorescence in the brain slice showed results comparative to those by cerebral blood flow. The area of accumulation of NADH was widened in proportion to the increase of venous pressure and the decrease of cerebral perfusion pressure. The destruction of the blood brain barrier examined by extravasation of Evans blue was found mainly in the white matter in contrast to the changes observed in the gray matter with regard to cerebral blood flow and metabolism. Histopathologically, a mild subarachnoid and/or subdural hemorrhage were observed in 67 % of the cases and intraventricular hemorrhage in 25 %. Necrotic changes in the parasagittal neurons and hippocampal cells were also observed in animals with sustained <b>cerebral</b> venous <b>hypertension...</b>|$|R

30|$|The {{malignant}} cerebral edema that attends severe TBI is {{a primary}} cause of poor neurological outcome and death. In addition to the mass effect of hematomas, the consequences of progressive cerebral swelling results in marked increases in intracranial pressure resulting in impaired cerebral perfusion (vascular effect) and brainstem herniation (mechanical effect) (Stocchetti and Maas 2014). As such, control of traumatic <b>cerebral</b> <b>hypertension</b> is the principle target of brain protective therapies (Brain Trauma Foundation 2007). In those TBI patients in whom ICP control can be achieved, neurological outcomes are generally better. In those who escape conventional treatment guidelines, alternate approaches are employed to prevent herniation and death. In the recently updated Brain Trauma Foundation Guidelines for the Management of Severe TBI, both hypothermia and decompressive craniectomy are second tier therapies to be considered. Hypothermia will lower ICP, but alone, has limited impact on adverse outcomes (Andrews et al. 2015). Unilateral DC, by allowing the swollen hemisphere to decompress through the craniectomy defect, lowers ICP, facilitating cerebral perfusion, and reduces the mechanical displacement of the brain (Gouello et al. 2014; Ecker et al. 2011; Aarabi et al. 2006).|$|E

40|$|The {{effect of}} a heat-killed, {{unencapsulated}} strain of type III group B streptococcus (GBS), COH 1 - 13, on cerebral blood flow (CBF) and prostanoid production was investigated in two separate piglet models. In the first model, we examined the temporal profile of changes in CBF and cerebrospinal fluid cytochemistry in response to GBS challenge during a 6 hour study period. Despite marked leukocytosis at 6 hours, GBS did not significantly affect CBF and other cardiovascular parameters, hematology and cerebral prostanoid production. In the second model, we evaluated the early effect of GBS on CBF autoregulatory function and subsequently employed pharmacologic agents to inhibit the effect of GBS. Cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) was altered by inflating balloon-tipped catheters placed at the aortic root to produce cerebral hypotension and at the descending aorta to produce <b>cerebral</b> <b>hypertension.</b> Piglets inoculated with GBS exhibited a narrow range of CBF autoregulation due to an impairment at the upper limit of CPP, which was prevented by treatment with dexamethasone or ibuprofen.

IN. 1954 our research group reported thatmodest to high level, persistent hyperten-sions could be produced in dogs by bilateral constriction of the carotid sinus area {{by means of a}} plastic clamp which reduced the volume pulse of the sinus and the internal carotid, occipital, and external carotid arteries to ap-proximately one third normal. 1 This report suggested that the hypertension was probably not due to altered carotid sinus function but to altered cerebral hemodynamics.

40|$|The {{management}} of neurosurgical patients {{has changed since}} a few years {{with the development of}} intracranial pressure (ICP) monitoring, the value of which having now become widely recognized. An understanding of pathophysiological mechanisms of increased ICP is mandatory for its management. In the normal state, a variation of volume of any of the intacranial constituants [brain substance, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), arterial and venous blood] is accompanied by an inverse change of the others, so that the total volume and the pressure remain constant. As soon as the compensation mechanisms are outrun, the ICP measured as the ventricular fluid pressure will increase. The relationship between volume and pressure increases is represented by the compliance curve of the intracranial contents. Continuous measurement of ICP is mainly done by two methods :catheterization of a ventricle which allows CSF removal for drainage or analysis and testing of the cerebral compliance (by addition or subtraction of one ml of fluid and noting the change in pressure); recording the extradural pressure, which entails less risk of infection, but does not allow CSF removal and may over-read the intraventricular pressure. The nomrla ICP lies between 10 - 15 mm Hg (15 - 20 cm H 2 O). The recognition of abnormal ICP waves is important :Lundberg first described the large A or plateau waves (50 - 100 mm Hg), accompanied by clinical signs of cerebral hypertension; there are also B waves (up to 50 mm Hg), less significant, usually accompanying a decrease of wakefulness, and C waves seemingly correlated with Traube-Hering-Mayer waves of the blood pressure. ICP may be increased due to disease (tumor, hematoma, edema, CSF blockage or benign <b>cerebral</b> <b>hypertension)</b> or iatrogenic (increased cerebral blood flow with vasodilatation during hypoxia, hypercarbia and anesthesia with most halogenated anesthetics; impaired venous drainage :coughing, straining, positive pressure ventilation with PEEP, etc.). In conclusion, ICP monitoring is a useful tool in neuroanesthesia and in neurological intensive care and in association with other methods of investigation like cerebral blood flow and metabolic rate measurement, CAT scanning, will be contributive in evaluating new treatments.

The {{headache}} of {{high altitude}} and microgravity—similarities with clinical syndromes of <b>cerebral</b> venous <b>hypertension.</b> High Alt. Med. Biol. 12 : 379 – 386. —Syndromes {{thought to have}} <b>cerebral</b> venous <b>hypertension</b> as their core, such as idiopathic intracranial hypertension and jugular foramen outlet obstruction, classically result in headaches. Do they provide an insight into {{the cause of the}} headache that commonly occurs at altitude? The classic theory of the pathogenesis of high altitude headache has been that it results from increased intracranial pressure (ICP) secondary to hypoxemia in people who have less compliant intracranial volumes (Roach and Hackett, 2001). However, there {{does not appear to be}} a correlation between the headache of acute mountain sickness (AMS) and the presence of cerebral edema (Bailey et al, 2006; Wilson et al, 2009). Research has concentrated on arterial perfusion to the brain in hypoxia, but there has been little study of venous drainage. Hypoxia results in markedly increased cerebral blood flow; however, if it has been considered at all, venous outflow has to date been assumed to be of little consequence. Retinal venous distension and the increased venous blood demonstrated by near infra-red spectroscopy and more recently by MRI imply that, in hypoxia, a relative venous insufficiency may exist. Similarly, there is increasing evidence that manifestations of the fluid shift during microgravity is of similar nature to idiopathic intracranial hypertension, which is thought to be primarily a venous insufficiency condition. The unique anthropomorphic adaptations of large brained biped humans with cerebral venous systems that have to cope with large changes in hydrostatic pressure may predispose us to conditions of inflow/outflow mismatch. In addition, slight increases in central venous pressures (e. g., from hypoxia-induced pulmonary vasoconstriction) may further compromise venous outflow at altitude. A better understanding of cerebral venous physiology may enlighten us with regards the pathogenesis of headaches currently considered idiopathic. It may also enable us to trigger headaches for study and hence enable us to develop new treatment strategies...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Activation of the renin-angiotensin (Ang) -aldosterone {{system is}} {{involved}} in the pathology of vascular diseases. Although the blockade of the mineralocorticoid receptor protects against vascular diseases, its role in cerebral aneurysms remains to be elucidated. We treated female rats subjected to renal hypertension, increased hemodynamic stress, and estrogen deficiency for 3 months with the mineralocorticoid receptor blocker eplerenone (30 or 100 mg/kg per day) or vehicle (vehicle control). Eplerenone reduced the incidence of cerebral aneurysms and saline intake without lowering of the blood pressure. In the aneurysmal wall, the production of Ang II and nitrotyrosine was increased. The mRNA levels of Ang-converting enzyme 1 and NADPH oxidase subunits NOX 4, Rac 1, monocyte chemoattractant protein 1, and matrix metalloproteinase 9 were increased. Eplerenone brought about a reduction in these molecules, suggesting that mineralocorticoid receptor blockade suppresses cerebral aneurysm formation by inhibiting oxidative stress, inflamma-tory factors, local renin-Ang system activation, and saline intake. Other female rats implanted with pellets of the mineralocorticoid receptor agonist deoxycorticosterone acetate manifested a high incidence of cerebral aneurysm formation and the upregulation of molecules related to oxidative stress, inflammatory factors, and the local renin-Ang system; their saline intake was increased.
