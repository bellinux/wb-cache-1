South African {{infrastructure}} {{has traditionally}} been funded through general government budgets and dedicated taxes and fees rather than tolls. However since the early 1980 's, the South African Government has adopted a strategy of tolling portions of the national road infra-structure either through PPP's or toll routes owned by the SANRA. This paper investigates whether the approach of tolling the road infrastructure together with the financing, construction and maintenance of roads by means of PPP's is the most efficient economic manner to finance such endeavours. A case study analysis of TRAC, a <b>concession</b> <b>toll</b> road project, highlights the theoretical economic inefficiencies which are primarily present in relation to marginal operating and external costs, misallocation of resources, the costs of collecting tolls, contractual efficiency {{as well as the}} efficiency in raising capital. The decision to toll routes, albeit theoretically economically inefficient, is however contextualized when viewed against the funding needs of Government, particularly {{in light of the fact}} that the South African government will continue to experience severe funding shortfalls for road maintenance, rehabilitation, and construction. However, highway needs are increasing yet public funding sources are constrained by limited resources together with spending priorities in other areas. Ostensibly the decision to toll a route is not based on theoretical economic efficiency issues but rather on a strategy to lessen the financial burden on the state by freeing up more money with the implementation of toll roads. This strategy thus allows the state to maintain those roads funded through the national fiscus by tolling certain routes and thereby continue to maintain and expand the road infrastructure with the given financial constraints...|$|E

5000|$|Most of the Portuguese {{motorways}} are tolled, {{although there}} are also some non-tolled highways, mostly in urban areas, like those of Greater Lisbon and Greater Oporto. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, the Government of Portugal created seven shadow <b>toll</b> <b>concessions,</b> the SCUT <b>toll</b> ( [...] , no costs for the user). In those concessions it were included more than 900 km of motorways and highways, some of them already built, others which were built in the following years. However, due to economical and political reasons, the shadow toll concept was abolished between 2010 and 2011, with electronic toll equipment being installed in these motorways, to charge their users. Having only electronic tolls, former SCUT motorways can now only be used by vehicles equipped with electronic payment devices or vehicles registered in the system.|$|R

40|$|Decision-making {{processes}} for investment in transportation infrastructure and, ultimately, the investment decisions themselves {{are central to}} the performance of transportation systems. Perhaps equally important for performance is the governance framework within which decisions are made. However, because of the complexity of the relationships between frameworks and performance, the evaluation of frameworks is challenging. This paper decomposes some elements of governance of transportation infrastructure into strategy development frameworks and through an agent-based simulation model provides {{a deeper understanding of the}} relationships between strategy development frameworks and system performance. A strategy development framework for transportation can be characterized by the infrastructure ownership structures, cross-modal and cross-sectoral linkages, revenue sources, decision-making {{processes for}} resource allocation, and the geographic scales of the organizations responsible for making infrastructure investments. With the dimensions of a strategy development framework as inputs, agents in a simulation framework make investments in an infrastructure network over time. This study used the national intercity roadway network of Portugal as the context. The results demonstrated the value of using simulation models of complex transportation systems to inform the decisions not only of planners but also of stakeholders who designed strategy development frameworks, for example, by predicting the relative performance of state ownership versus <b>concession</b> arrangements, <b>tolling</b> versus general taxation, and centralized versus decentralized control of investment decisions. Such a tool was viewed as particularly important given the ongoing reorganization of the Portuguese transportation sector, including an increasing reliance on <b>concession</b> agreements, highway <b>tolls,</b> and subnational government participation.

50|$|There was {{an attempt}} in July 1794 to engage millowners in a {{discussion}} about how alternatives to locks might work, but the project appears to have faded away after that. In 1797, the company was wound up, and the Red Moss scheme was also abandoned at the same time. Hadfield and Biddle {{have suggested that the}} scheme might have been a political move, rather than a genuine proposal. In 1805, the Leeds and Liverpool decided to press ahead with the line to Red Moss, but reported that the Manchester Bolton & Bury were no longer ready to do so, although that company kept no record of the event. In 1810, common sense prevailed, and the Leeds and Liverpool agreed to share {{the southern end of the}} Lancaster Canal between Johnson's Hillock and Kirkless, near Wigan. <b>Concessions</b> on <b>tolls</b> agreed between the companies meant that a link to the Manchester Bolton & Bury was unlikely to be built.|$|R
50|$|In October 2001, Tan Sri Wahid was {{appointed}} as MD/CEO for the UEM Group. The takeover by Khazanah Nasional back then received mixed reactions. The first step that Tan Sri Wahid did {{to address these}} predicaments was to unlock {{the value of its}} highway concessions led by PLUS Expressways. The <b>toll</b> <b>concession</b> was reviewed to lower the toll rate increase (from 5% pa to 3.2% pa) but increased every 3 years. This allowed space for UEM's debts to be restructured and thereafter undertook its IPO listing on Bursa Malaysia in July 2002. Another step taken by Tan Sri Wahd was to dispose the non-core assets {{in order to reduce the}} Group's debt to a more manageable level.|$|R
50|$|Until {{the early}} 1980s, the Portuguese {{motorways}} {{did not have}} a proper number, each being referred to by a name (with some sections that were part of a estrada nacional also using the respective Nxx number). The existing motorways at that time (all of them managed under concession) started to receive a proper number of the type Axx. With the application of the PRN 1985, new motorways were built with a few of them being managed directly by the national road agency JAE and not under concession like the others. So, although all motorways were part of an IP or IC, only concessionated ones received the Axx number (whether tolled or not), this latter number being signalized and the IPxx or ICxx number being ignored in the motorway signage. The other motorways - non-concessionated, and therefore, always non-tolled - were signalized with the IPxx or ICxx number. Because, until the 2000s, almost all motorways under <b>concession</b> were <b>tolled,</b> in that time, the existence or not of a signed Axx number helped the drivers to know in advance if a motorway was tolled or not.|$|R
5|$|On 2 January 1965, {{the bridge}} {{committee}} recommended that a limited company be established {{to finance the}} bridge. The three archipelago municipalities, Fjell, Sund and Øygarden, would purchase shares for NOK500,000, while another NOK200,000 would be purchased from the mainland municipalities and Hordaland County Municipality. The company was established as A/S Sotrabrua on 16 October 1965, with the head office located in Fjell. The company was given authority by its owners {{to apply for a}} 20-year <b>concession</b> to collect <b>tolls</b> on a new bridge; if the tolls gave a profit beyond covering the debt of the bridge, it was to be used for further construction of roads on Sotra and Øygarden. The company was formally registered on 12 January 1966.|$|R
50|$|The N3 <b>Toll</b> <b>Concession</b> {{has stated}} that the De Beer's bypass will be {{required}} when daily traffic volumes reach 13,900 vehicles - the current traffic volume at Van Reenen is 11,000 vehicles, and based on projected increases in traffic volumes, the bypass {{will need to be}} operational by the end of 2014, with construction commencing {{in the second half of}} 2011. However, they carefully fail to mention the additional cost this will entail for the general public and road users, which would be paid at the additional toll plaza to be added as part of the new route. Furthermore, the additional impact on congestion this new toll plaza will have on the traffic may in fact be worse than the congestion caused by the steed gradient of the current route.|$|R
50|$|The {{project cost}} , {{all of which}} was financed by debt {{taken up by the}} {{partially}} publicly owned company Ålesund og Giske Tunnel- og Brusamband AS. The fixed link received a <b>concession</b> to collect <b>tolls</b> for 22 years. The project was built in a period with much optimism, and the banks were more than willing to lend large sums for the project. However, by the time the project was finished, the interest rate had increased to 16.5%, and the toll company could not pay the interest, let alone the principal sum. By 1990, the company was nearly bankrupt, but was saved by an agreement with the banks. Other factors contributing to the financial problems was the choice late in the project to include the Giske Bridge and Godøy Tunnel, as well as lower traffic than estimated.|$|R
40|$|The {{waterway}} {{transportation is}} considered the most efficient. Moreover, Brazil has many rivers, besides the extensive coastline, appropriate to navigation. However, this mode of transport is not widely used in the country, especially inland. This study evaluates the possible causes for this. From a historical perspective, a waterway is characterized and its potential use {{in the country is}} evaluated, especially for the distribution of agricultural production. Costs of operation and deployment of a waterway are compared with a railroad. Despite these costs depend on the natural river navigability, the cost structure is favorable to the waterway, specially in rivers of low to medium course. Institutional analysis indicates that despite being the mode of transportation that gets less public investment, there are a greater number of public agents involved, with various plans and programs in progress, but without proper integration. Moreover, {{there is a lack of}} reliable information on the cost of investments needed, exacerbated by the fact that Technical, Economic and Environmental Feasibility Studies are still under development, impairing decision making on such investments. The review recommends that the implementation and operation of waterways should be transferred to the private sector through simple <b>concessions,</b> with <b>toll</b> collection, allowing expedite the necessary work and giving prospects for continuity of operations for carriers, since the maintenance of navigability on the waterways will not depend on public resources...|$|R

50|$|The most {{controversial}} {{development of the}} FT1 highway in Kuala Lumpur was the toll collection at Jalan Kuching FT1. The nine-year concession of Jalan Kuching FT1 was awarded to Kamunting Corporation Berhad, signed on 15 April 1985. In the original concessionaire agreement, Kamunting Corporation Berhad was required to build an interchange at Kepong Roundabout and to upgrade the Jalan Kepong FT54, {{in return for the}} nine-year toll collection rights starting from 1987 until 1996. However, in 1987, the concessionaire agreement was amended, and Kamunting Corporation Berhad was required to add two more lanes from the existing four lanes along Jalan Kuching FT1, resulting another 7-year extension of <b>toll</b> <b>concession</b> which was ended in 2003. The toll collection at Jalan Kuching FT1 had sparked fury among Kuala Lumpurian motorists, and numerous protests were held to urge the government to end the toll collection there. The toll collection at Jalan Kuching FT1 was finally abolished on 8 January 2003.|$|R
40|$|Weigh-in-motion (WIM) {{scales are}} {{installed}} on various higher order roads in South Africa to provide traffic loading information for pavement design, strategic planning and law enforcement. Some WIM systems produce anomalies that cannot be satisfactorily explained even by highly experienced professionals. Much {{of the problem}} relates to the difficulty in determining the appropriate calibration factors to correct systematic measurement error for WIM systems and the inadequacy of data quality management methods. The author has developed a post-calibration method for WIM data, called the Truck Tractor (TT) method, to correct the magnitude of recorded axle loads in retrospect. In addition, it incorporates a series of data quality checks. The TT method is robust, accurate and adequately simple for use on a routine basis {{for a wide variety}} of South African WIM systems. The calibration module of the TT method (i. e. the procedure to determine the calibration factor, kTT) has been accepted by SANRAL and incorporated into the model it uses to quantify the cost of overloading on <b>toll</b> <b>concessions.</b> Some of the data quality checking concepts are also being considered for further use and threshold values for tests are being refined by SANRAL for this purpose...|$|R
50|$|For {{the first}} few months in operation, motorists had to sign out at the Jabor toll plaza to pay the toll fare up until Jabor, before making a loop and {{entering}} the LPT2. Since July 2015 though, the Malaysian Highway Authority had taken responsibility for toll collection of LPT2 until the concession agreement was finalised. Following this, motorists are no longer required to sign out at Jabor, and they can pay the toll fare at the LPT2 toll plazas. Pending the finalization of the <b>concession</b> agreement, the <b>toll</b> fare was calculated until Jabor for the time being, effectively making the Jabor-Kuala Terengganu stretch free of charge. The concession agreement was signed with PLUS in April 2016, and Lebuhraya Pantai Timur 2 Sdn. Bhd., a subsidiary of PLUS, was reportedly appointed to manage the highway. The Terengganu state government had reportedly requested that toll collection be postponed until after the 2016 Hari Raya celebrations in July 2016. Toll collections by LPT2 Sdn. Bhd. formally began on 15 July, when the new toll rates were announced. For example, a trip from Gombak to Kuala Terengganu now costs RM 52.80.|$|R
5000|$|A BOT Project (build operate {{transfer}} project) {{is typically}} {{used to develop}} a discrete asset rather than a whole network and is generally entirely new or greenfield in nature (although refurbishment may be involved).

Even if the host government could borrow money on better conditions than a private company could, other factors could offset this particular advantage.

40|$|As more {{countries}} are {{relying on the}} private sector for provision of public services, Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) {{are at the center}} of this growing trend. Optimal risk allocation through risk transfer to the private sector is the critical issue for the success of these partnerships in achieving best value-for-money (VfM) for the public sector. Using the Portuguese shadow <b>toll</b> <b>concessions</b> (SCUT), this study aims to analyze and evaluate their allocation of risk between the public and private sectors. Accordingly, the first part of the paper examines how risks in the SCUT concessions were allocated. Our analysis indicates that for the most part, with the exception of demand risk, risks were well allocated. The second part of the paper identifies and evaluates the main risks transferred to the private sector. It also goes further in assessing gains before and after risk transfer, if any, to the private sector. We find that risks transferred to the private sector account for a very small share of public sector payments. This paper also concludes that the costs to the public sector, through the payment obligations, far outweigh those assumed by the private sector. Consequently, this paper examines whether the SCUT concessions were successful in regards to achieving VfM. The high gains to the private sector may suggest otherwise. However, given that there was no comparison of VfM between the PPP approach and an alternative procurement route, it is not possible to draw any concrete conclusions...|$|R
