5000|$|The first mass-produced shaft <b>collars</b> {{were set}} <b>screw</b> <b>collars</b> and were used {{primarily}} on line shafting in early manufacturing mills. These early shaft collars were solid ring types, employing square-head set screws that protruded from the <b>collar.</b> Protruding <b>screws</b> {{proved to be}} a problem because they could catch on a worker's clothing while rotating on a shaft, and pull them into the machinery.|$|R
5000|$|Class 6 {{occupies}} the largest proportion of UDC schedules. It contains over 44,000 subdivisions. Each specific field of technology or industry usually {{contains more than}} one special auxiliary table with concepts needed to express operations, processes, materials and products. As a result, UDC codes are often created through the combination of various attributes. Equally, some parts of this class enumerate concepts to a great level of detail e.g. 621.882.212 Hexagon screws with additional shapes. Including: Flank <b>screws.</b> <b>Collar</b> <b>screws.</b> Cap screws ...|$|R
50|$|A stand (of drill pipe) is two {{or three}} joints of drill pipe {{connected}} {{and stood in the}} derrick vertically, usually while tripping pipe. A stand of collars is similar, only made up of collars and a collar head. The <b>collar</b> head is <b>screwed</b> into the <b>collar</b> to allow it to be picked up by the elevators.|$|R
50|$|Set <b>screw</b> <b>collars</b> {{are best}} used when the {{material}} of the shaft is softer than the set screw. Unfortunately, the set screw causes damage to the shaft - a flare-up of shaft material - which makes the collar harder to adjust or remove. It is common to machine small flats onto the shaft at the set screw locations to eliminate this problem.|$|R
5000|$|Elswick Pattern “T”: Had {{an inner}} A tube, A tube {{in two parts}} joined by <b>screwed</b> <b>collar,</b> B tube and half-length wire, jacket and short breech ring. A {{pneumatically}} operated Welin breech block was used {{and they were in}} hydraulic powered mounts. [...] The Armstrong gun was similar to the Vickers gun, but weighed 69.3 metric tons (68.2 long tons).|$|R
50|$|The CKS-1 turret holds 2 lenses. Both {{positions}} {{secure a}} mounting bracket {{to connect to}} lenses. One position is the Cine Kodak mount, with a fixed 25mm lens. The other position is the Kodak S-Mount distinguished by an alignment pin and secured by a <b>screw</b> <b>collar.</b> The latter allows for insertion of interchangeable lenses. The mounting brackets have tilt-up viewfinders with masks according to the focal length.|$|R

5000|$|In Australia, New Zealand {{and many}} {{associated}} South Pacific island nations, the AS/NZ 3123 standard is used. In this series, multiple sizes of three-phase round-pin socket are standardized by current rating and neutral circuit. Each socket accepts plugs {{up to its}} rating, but excludes plugs with a higher current rating or with a neutral pin (if not on the socket). Multiphase plugs and sockets are rated at up to 500 V and all include an earth connection. These plugs and sockets are usually IP56 rated if fitted correctly. A <b>screw</b> <b>collar</b> helps hold plug and socket together.|$|R
50|$|The {{suspension}} {{has greater}} vertical travel and more adjustability than the suspension on the Versys 650 siblings.. On the front thicker/stiffer 41 mm inverted front forks are externally adjustable for preload and rebound damping. The right fork leg carries a damping cartridge while both legs contain springs. The {{rear shock absorber}} is adjustable for rebound damping. Suspension preload is adjustable in the rear via a <b>screw</b> <b>collar</b> on the shock. 2015+ models have an external adjuster. The rear shock/spring is directly connected, without linkages, to a non symmetrical, gull wing, aluminum swing arm instead of the more basic steel swing arm used on the Ninja and ER-6.|$|R
30|$|According to {{the results}} of this study, %RTL {{increased}} significantly with increasing collar length and the percentage of removal torque gaining after load with 0 ° abutments with collar height 4  mm was less than that of 2  mm. This finding matches what was found by Siadat et al. [9] who evaluated the effect of <b>collar</b> length on <b>screw</b> loosening and concluded that an increase in the abutment collar length significantly increase the torque loss of abutment–implant screw after cyclic loading. The abutment collar length acts as vertical cantilever, so increasing abutment collar would lead to an increased vertical cantilever which acts as a force magnifier [8]. Cantilever designs increase bending forces on screws due to the lever effect [17, 18].|$|R
5000|$|A sheave {{can also}} {{refer to a}} pulley which has an {{adjustable}} operating diameter for use with a mechanical belt. This is accomplished by constructing the pulley out of several pieces. The two main [...] "halves" [...] of the pulley can be moved closer together or farther apart, thus altering the operational diameter. The usual construction {{is some sort of}} locking <b>collar</b> or set <b>screws</b> to secure the components, one half with a threaded central shaft and one half with a threaded center. By rotating the components one can [...] "screw" [...] the parts closer together or further apart, thus changing the distance between the two halves and allowing the belt to ride higher or lower in the groove. The adjustments are constrained to a specific range of size and are not limitless. One application of this is the Variomatic automatic transmission.|$|R
5000|$|On Saturday, 14 August 1915, the 08:45 Birmingham to Euston express {{passenger}} train hauled by LNWR George the Fifth Class locomotive No. 1489 lost a taper pin; its {{purpose was to}} lock a <b>screwed</b> <b>collar</b> which retained the offside coupling rod to its crank pin. The coupling rod detached and struck one of the sleepers on the up line; pushing the track out of alignment just as the 08:30 Euston to Holyhead Irish Mail train approached. It consisted of 15 coaches hauled by two locomotives LNWR Renown Class No. 1971 and Precedent Class No. 1189 and was travelling at 60 miles per hour. Both locomotives and every carriage was derailed; several being thrown down an embankment, killing 10 passengers and injuring 21 more. The approximate location of the collision was [...] between Weedon and Stowe Hill tunnel.|$|R
50|$|Many {{artillery}} {{pieces were}} converted from older smooth bore weapons once technical problems in strengthening the original cast iron {{body had been}} overcome. The widely adopted solution, invented in 1863 by William Palliser, consisted of enlarging the bore to accept a wrought iron tube (called the A tube) into which the rifling had been cut. The A tube was closed at the breech end by a wrought iron cup screwed into it. Iron {{was removed from the}} outside of the original gun barrel near to the muzzle so that a cast iron <b>collar</b> could be <b>screwed</b> over it and provide a shoulder at the muzzle to hold the A tube in place. The A tube was also held by a plug screwed into the gun underneath its trunnions. The outside of the breech portion was turned on a lathe so that another wrought iron tube, called the B tube, could be slid over it to strengthen it.|$|R
500|$|In the 2000s, Dan Antoniu {{and other}} Romanian {{aviation}} experts investigated existing {{photographs of the}} Coandă-1910, leading them {{to believe that the}} aircraft presented at the exhibition was not finished, that it was exhibited with many improvisations. Antoniu published Henri Coandă and his technical work during 1906–1918, a 2010 book in which he said that the unfinished state of the aircraft led to Coandă filing several extra patents and starting a new series of studies with the aim of making the machine airworthy. For instance, Antoniu wrote that the exhaust pipes of the Clergét engine appeared free; there were no devices to redirect exhaust gases to the turbine as described in the patent, and there were no heat shields for crew protection. As well, the central attachment of the tubular struts holding the wings to the fuselage, with mere <b>collars</b> secured with <b>screws,</b> was judged by Antoniu as appearing potentially unsafe during take-off or landing because of the [...] "considerable loads on the struts". The X-shaped empennage was covered at high angles by the horizontal stabiliser making it unusable, and any high-speed taxi would put the machine in danger of a nose-over.|$|R
5|$|The aircraft's {{construction}} was a novelty for the time. In {{contrast to the}} monoplane described in the July 1910 patent application, the exhibit was a sesquiplane which complicated the construction, but in return solved lateral stability control issues. The cantilevered wings were held in place at three points by tubular steel struts without any bracing from flying wires. According to Coandă's description the wings were built with metal spars, but existing photographs of the construction show a completely wooden internal structure. The trailing edges of the upper wing could be twisted separately or together for lateral control or braking during landing, and were controlled by pedals in the two-seat open cockpit. The fuselage, painted reddish-brown and highly polished, was described by The Technical World magazine as having a framework of steel, though the construction photographs indicate {{that it had a}} wooden framework. This was triangular in cross-section with convex ribs edged with strips of steel, and strengthened with a covering of heat-shaped moulded plywood. Tubular radiators for engine cooling were located {{on either side of the}} cockpit. The vertical struts from the wings were secured to the fuselage with steel <b>collars</b> fixed with <b>screws.</b> The fuselage terminated in a cruciform empennage with control surfaces at 45° angles to vertical and horizontal. Four triangular surfaces at the rear of the tail were controlled using a pair of large Antoinette VII-style steering wheels mounted outside of the cockpit, one on each side, and were used for pitch and directional control. It was an early instance of what are now known as ruddervators. Forward of the tail was a small horizontal stabiliser. The fuel tank was located in the fuselage between the engine and the cockpit.|$|R
