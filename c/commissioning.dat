5|$|In other countries, {{the state}} played a {{stronger}} {{role in the}} process of <b>commissioning</b> memorials. France, for example, mostly relied on local communities to organise and commission most war memorials, but the state played a comparatively larger role than in Britain and similar countries. A law was passed in 1919 establishing an official role for local government officials {{in the process of}} <b>commissioning</b> memorials; many towns then formed committees to take this process forward, typically at the commune level. Members of the Souvenir Français organisation {{played an important role in}} many of the resulting local committees. In other cases, governments increased their role in <b>commissioning</b> memorials during the inter-war period. In Romania, most memorials in the early 1920s were initially erected by local communities; in 1919 the royal family created the Societatea Cultul Eroilor Morţi to oversee commemoration of the war more generally; the organisation was headed by the Patriarch of the Romanian Orthodox Church. By the 1930s official concern over the diverse range of designs led to increased central control over the process.|$|E
