40|$|AbstractThe {{development}} of a system can start {{with the creation of}} a specification. Following this viewpoint, we claim that often a specification can be constructed from the combination of specifications which can be seen as composition. Event-B is a formal method that allows modelling and refinement of systems. The combination, reuse and validation of component specifications are not currently supported in Event-B. We extend the Event-B formalism using shared event composition as an option for developing (distributed) systems. Refinement is used in the {{development of}} specifications using <b>composed</b> <b>machines</b> and we prove that properties and proof obligations of specifications can be reused to ensure valid composed specifications. The main contributions of this work are the Event-B extension to support shared event composition and refinement including the proof obligations for a <b>composed</b> <b>machine...</b>|$|R
40|$|UML-B is a UML-like {{graphical}} {{front end}} for Event-B that provides support for object- oriented modelling concepts. In particular, UML-B supports class diagrams and state machines, concepts {{that are not}} explicitly supported in plain Event-B. In Event-B, refinement is used to relate system models at different abstraction levels. The same abstraction-refinement concepts can also be applied in UML-B. This work introduces the notions of refined classes, refined state machines and extended classtypes to en- able refinement of classes and state machines in UML-B. This work makes explicit the structures of class and state machine refinement in UML-B. This work also introduces seven refinement techniques which are, adding new attributes and associations, adding new classes, elaborating state, elaborating transition, moving a class event (or a state machine transition), adding new attributes and associations, and adding new classtypes. In Event-B, decomposition is used to decompose a system into components. The same decomposition concepts can be applied in UML-B. This work introduces the techniques of flattening state machines and state grouping to facilitate a decomposition of a UML-B machine. This work also introduces the notion of <b>composed</b> <b>machine</b> which <b>composes</b> the component <b>machines.</b> The <b>composed</b> <b>machine</b> refines a machine which is being decomposed. The <b>composed</b> <b>machine</b> is used to ensure {{the composition of the}} component machines is a valid refinement. Together with the <b>composed</b> UML-B <b>machine,</b> the notions of included <b>machine,</b> <b>composed</b> event and constituent event are introduced. The UML-B drawing tool and Event-B translator are extended to support the new refinement and decomposition concepts. A case study of an auto teller machine (ATM) is presented to validate the extensions of UML-B with regards to the above notions. The ATM case study also demonstrates the above techniques introduced in refinement and decomposition. In addition, this work provides guidelines for performing refinement and decomposition in UML-B and presents a number of generic invariants that may be used when refining a middleware. The middleware is a component via which a requesting component such as an ATM and a responding component such as bank interact in a distributed system.

40|$|AbstractThe {{problem we}} address {{in this paper}} arises in {{large-scale}} manufacturing of bank cheques. Due to security reasons, the cheques must be printed on special (expensive) paper. The {{first step in the}} printing process is to prepare the plates that will be used by the <b>composing</b> <b>machine.</b> If the imprint (image) of a particular cheque is on a plate, each time the <b>composing</b> <b>machine</b> uses this plate a new cheque of this type is produced. Each plate has a predefined number of positions to be impressed. Due to delivery due dates, there is an additional constraint requiring each cheque not to be present in more than a predefined number of different plates. There are two different production costs that have to be considered: overproduction costs and printing costs. Each overproduced cheque can be either destroyed or stored in a proper location under surveillance. Both these alternatives have a huge environmental impact, indeed, on the one hand, paper waste is produced, while, on the other hand there is a huge energy consumption. The problem consists in defining the pattern (i. e. the configuration of cheque images) of each plate to be used and the corresponding frequency, such that total costs are minimized. We study this real world problem that is strictly related to the cutting stock problem with pattern minimization. Such a problem is addressed actually by a large cheque manufacturer in Southern part of Italy. We define a very efficient heuristic to solve it. The proposed solution methodology is currently used by the above mentioned manufacturer to define the cheque allocation of the plates...|$|E

40|$|THEEARLIEST PRINTED {{books are}} not easily dis-tinguished from their {{manuscript}} predecessors. The printers attempted to imitate in their first type faces the prevalent book hands of their Iocality and used the same papers as those available to the scribes. Binders continued to practice their craft as they had for centuries. The original purpose of bindings was to protect the visible cords and sewings of the books. Since leather was the only suitable material avail-able and a scarce commodity in the 15 th century, many manuscripts and incunabula were frequently only half covered with skins, leaving the wooden boards bare. As economic conditions permitted, leather was used to cover the outside completely. Occasionally, other materials found temporary acceptance, but until {{the first quarter of}} the 19 th century a “bound book ” generally meant one covered in animal skin. “Fine bindings ” or “hand-book bindings ” are still produced today, even in the United States, ’ but they were displaced from the general market by three inventions made between 1820 and 1832 : the use of cloth as covering material, the casing-in method and the gold-stamp-ing on cIoth, which made the mass production of books possible. Other inventions helped in the establishment of mass-production methods. Earl Stanhope invented the iron hand press in 1798 which was later improved by the cylinder press of Konig in 1814. The stereo-type plates of William Ged were used in the United States around 1812, the Fourdrinier paper-making machine made its American ap-pearance in 1827, and William Church‘s <b>composing</b> <b>machine</b> was in use here by 1830. 2 From these early beginnings the industry developed over the next one-hundred years by adding refinements to its processes. Mechanization was introduced during the second half of the 19 th century, but basically the changes were minor.

40|$|The {{relative}} obscurity of Linn Boyd Benton and Morris Fuller Benton, is investigated. The two men, {{father and}} son, {{made significant contributions}} to the technology of typesetting and to typeface design, yet they are not now well known in the industry. Linn Boyd Benton invented a pantographic punch-cutting machine, which he later modified to engrave matrices. This machine made the Linotype machine practical, since it took the tedium and great expense out of the making of Linotype 2 ̆ 7 mats. 2 ̆ 7 Benton 2 ̆ 7 s machine was and still is used at the American Type Founders Company, and was copied for use at type founding companies and <b>composing</b> <b>machine</b> manufacturers around the world. Morris Fuller Benton was the first type designer to develop the concept of the type family, and also revived many beautiful types like Baskerville, Bulmer, Bodoni, and Garamond. He designed more types than any other American type designer, {{and many of them are}} still in wide use. Benton 2 ̆ 7 s father collaborated on the original Century type, and Morris Benton designed Century Expanded, Century Oldstyle, Century Catalogue, Century Schoolbook, and all the italic, bold, condensed and extended versions that went along with them. He designed a variety of types, from gothics to moderns to classic revivals. Some of Benton 2 ̆ 7 s types became popular right away, and others, like Souvenir, became popular years after Benton died. The Bentons were written about in the printing literature of their day, but only a few recent and fairly obscure articles have mentioned them. It is shown that the reason for this is most probably due to the modesty and reticence of the Bentons. Both father and son worked for the American Type Founders (ATF) Company, which did not promote its employees but instead advertised its products. So while ATF became the most influential type founding company in the country, the Bentons remained relative unknowns. The story of their professional and personal lives, and the story of ATF 2 ̆ 7 s rise and decline are included. Morris Benton 2 ̆ 7 s type designs are discussed, and the ATF method of making type is given...|$|E

40|$|The {{behavior}} of mobile devices is highly non deterministic and barely predictable {{due to the}} interaction of the user with its applications.

To that end we introduce partial compilers. These compilers can pass sub-programs to several child (partial) compilers, combining the code generated by their children to generate the final target code. We define a set of high-level polymorphic operations manipulating both compilers and partial compilers as first-class values. These mechanisms provide a software architecture for modular compiler construction. This allows the building of a forest of compilers, providing a structured treatment of multistage compilers. ...|$|R
