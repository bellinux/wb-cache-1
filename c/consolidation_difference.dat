40|$|The {{treatment}} of the {{difference arising on consolidation}} has been both a subject of debate (especially in the English-speaking counties) and a source of international diversity in financial reporting. The implementation of the EU Fourth and Seventh Directives could be expected {{to reduce the amount of}} this diversity so far as member states are concerned. To a large extent, the directives imposed methods which were generally accepted in the English-speaking countries; for example, what is now known as the 'former German method' was excluded. Nevertheless, the Directives left a fair amount of flexibility; alternative practices, some generally accepted in the UK and others in the USA, were permitted. This paper compares the {{treatment of}} the <b>consolidation</b> <b>difference</b> in two EU member states, France and the UK, based on an analysis of five years' financial statements of a random sample of seventy companies, in each country (700 sets of financial statements in all). The research shows that, notwithstanding the harmonizing effects of the Directives, substantial differences exist between the French and British treatments. In general, French recommended treatments are quite close to those required by U. S. GAAP, with a major exception in the treatment of 'quasi-goodwill' items such as brands. By contrast, the UK treatments differ from the U. S. and French treatments in some important respects; they also fail to comply with the revised IAS 22. On the other hand, the UK requirements are clearly documented and mandatory; hence the level of compliance is very high. By contrast the French requirements are variously and not always consistently documented and only partly mandatory; the levels of compliance are consequently lower. There was some evidence that the choice of treatment in the UK, as between immediate elimination against reserves and capitalization and amortiz-ation, was influenced by the company's level of gearing. No such choice exists in France, so no comparable analysis was possible. The research suggests that, in the case of the <b>consolidation</b> <b>difference,</b> the EU Directives left an arguably excessive degree of flexibility of treatment, a problem which it has been left to the revised IAS 22 to address. ...|$|E

HypothesisCircumferential lumbar arthrodesis using FFFHA as interbody graft material could be an alternative to achieve interbody fusion without graft subsidence. MethodsA retrospective review of 47 patients (56 levels) treated with lumbar circumferential fusion using FFFHA as interbody material. Consolidation was independently assessed by the two authors using a 3 -type scale; interbody bone graft subsidence was also evaluated. ResultsForty-four of the 47 patients (93. 6 %), and 53 of the 56 levels (94. 6 %) obtained <b>consolidation,</b> without <b>differences</b> between smokers and nonsmokers. Three levels (in three patients) did not fuse; one of them (2. 1 %) required revision. No patient presented graft dislodgment, signs of infection or graft subsidence at the last follow-up.

40|$|After encoding, memory {{contents}} need {{to undergo}} a phase of stabilization {{in order to be}} remembered in the long-term. Such stabilization is referred to as memory consolidation, and is assumed to be observable in less time-dependent forgetting and less susceptibility to interference. Evidence for a role of sleep in the effective consolidation of memories has previously been provided. In addition, research on the so-called testing effect has also indicated a contribution of retrieval practice to long-term memory, as the active retrieval from memory {{has been shown to be}} able to boost retention. This thesis investigated effects of sleep and retrieval on memory consolidation. Effects of sleep-associated memory consolidation were examined by inducing interference in paired-associate learning and by applying list-method directed forgetting: Replicating previous work, sleep was found to be of preferential benefit for memories that are hard to access; thereby, sleep counteracted both incidental and intentional forms of forgetting. Applying the retrieval-practice paradigm, effects of retrieval-associated consolidation were observed: Retrieval was found to stabilize directly retrieved and related memories, thereby making them less susceptible to both time-dependent forgetting and retroactive interference. The data presented here indicate that both sleep and retrieval may be associated with memory <b>consolidation.</b> Possible <b>differences</b> and parallels between sleep-associated and retrieval-associated memory consolidation as well as implications of such a proposal are discussed. ...|$|R

30|$|We {{add to the}} {{existing}} literature in three important respects. First, we explicitly consider {{the role of government}} sector size and estimate whether government compensations exercise a stronger impact on the labour market when the government is a large than when it is a small employer. This would mostly allude to an explicit market mechanism, an issue that has been only tangentially treated in {{the existing}} literature. Second, we account for wage setting modalities in the government sector distinguishing between compensations set by government decision and those set through collective bargaining. Whilst largely ignored by the literature, the latter seems like a crucial issue because it is an indication {{of the extent to which}} changes in government compensations are the result of exogenous fiscal policy decisions or rather part of the broader economy-wide wage setting system. Third, we provide some evidence on whether the spillover from the government to the private tradable sector is symmetric and whether periods of fiscal <b>consolidation</b> make a <b>difference.</b>|$|R

40|$|In equids, {{susceptibility}} to disease caused by Rhodococcus equi occurs {{almost exclusively in}} foals. This distribution might be attributable to the age-dependent maturation of immunity following birth undergone by mammalian neonates that renders them especially susceptible to infectious diseases. Expansion and diversification of the neonatal microbiome contribute to development of immunity in the gut. Moreover, diminished diversity of the gastrointestinal microbiome {{has been associated with}} risk of infections and immune dysregulation. We thus hypothesized that varying composition or reduced diversity of the intestinal microbiome of neonatal foals would contribute to increased susceptibility of their developing R. equi pneu-monia. The composition and diversity indices of the fecal microbiota at 3 and 5 weeks of age were compared among 3 groups of foals: 1) foals that subsequently developed R. equi pneumonia after sampling; 2) foals that subsequently developed ultrasonographic evidence of pulmonary abscess formation or consolidation but not clinical signs (subclinical group); and, 3) foals that developed neither clinical signs nor ultrasonographic evidence of pulmo-nary abscess formation or <b>consolidation.</b> No significant <b>differences</b> were found amon...|$|R
30|$|This paper {{assesses the}} {{relationship}} {{between public and private}} wages, as measured by general government and manufacturing nominal compensations, respectively, on a sample of 17 European Union (EU) countries from 1980 to 2013 applying dynamic ordinary least squares (DOLS) to panel data for the long-run and an error correction model (ECM) for the short run. We focus specifically on the spill over of government to manufacturing compensations so as to address the question of the possible effects of certain fiscal policy measures on cost competitiveness via the supply side. Moreover, attention is devoted to the manufacturing sector because much of the literature on wage leadership is indeed concerned with the signalling that comes from wage bargainers in the manufacturing sector. Our estimation strategy aims at determining the strength of the relation between sectoral compensations across government sectors of different size, at assessing whether the way in which government compensations are set has any impact {{on the nature of the}} interaction with the private traded sector, and finally at establishing whether such relation is symmetric holding both when government compensations are increased and when cut and whether periods of large cuts (or fiscal <b>consolidations)</b> make a <b>difference.</b> Whilst our focus is on the relation going from general government to manufacturing compensations, we nonetheless also assess interactions in the opposite direction as a way of validating our results.|$|R
40|$|Low {{estradiol}} levels during extinction training lead to poor extinction consolidation {{and increased}} fear during extinction recall; however, the {{mechanism by which}} this occurs has not been identified. The renin angiotensin system (RAS), which is often studied {{in the context of}} blood pressure regulation and cardiovascular function, has recently been associated with the stress response and stress related pathologies. Antagonists of the angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT 1 R), which are commonly prescribed to treat hypertension, reduce symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in humans and enhance extinction consolidation in male mice. Since estradiol downregulates many components of the RAS, including AT 1 R, we hypothesized that estradiol modulates the RAS to affect fear extinction consolidation. We predicted that high estradiol levels during extinction training lead to downregulation of RAS components and enhanced extinction consolidation. We show {{for the first time that}} systemic administration of AT 1 R antagonist losartan prior to extinction training reverses the extinction consolidation deficit found in female rats taking a hormonal contraceptive (HC), which reduces estradiol levels. We also found that female rats that receive ovariectomy (OVX) surgery have a deficit in extinction consolidation compared to sham-operated proestrus females, and that systemic treatment with losartan prior to extinction training rescues the deficit in OVX females. Finally, we explore potential mechanisms for how estradiol is regulating the RAS to affect fear extinction <b>consolidation.</b> While <b>differences</b> in RAS components have been extensively studied in OVX females, no studies have examined how HC treatment affects RAS components or how AT 1 R levels differ between males and females in the brain. We found that OVX females have increased AT 1 R ligand binding compared to intact proestrus females in the pituitary gland and ventral subiculum. We also found that HC-treated females have increased circulating angiotensin II (Ang II) peptide levels compared to proestrus females. Our findings have significant clinical implications, suggesting that patients with anxiety disorders such as PTSD should take an AT 1 R antagonist, especially if they have low estradiol levels, prior to an exposure therapy session to improve treatment outcome...|$|R
40|$|Post-training {{administration}} of morphine (0. 25, 0. 5, or 1 mg/kg) dose-dependently impairs retention of an inhibitory avoidance response in mice. The effects on retention performance {{induced by the}} drug appear {{to be due to}} an effect on memory consolidation. In fact, they were observed when drugs were given at short, but not long, periods of time after training, i. e., when the memory trace was susceptible to modulation. Moreover, these effects are not to be ascribed to an aversive or a rewarding or nonspecific action of the drugs on retention performance, because the latencies during the retention test of those mice that had not received a footshock during the training were not affected by post-training drug administration. Pretreatment with either selective D 1 or D 2 dopamine (DA) receptor antagonists SCH 23390 and (-) -sulpiride administered at per se noneffective doses (0. 025 and 6 mg/kg, respectively) potentiated the effects of morphine, while either selective D 1 or D 2 receptor agonists SKF 38393 and LY 171555 at per se noneffective doses (5 and 0. 25 mg/kg, respectively) antagonized the effects of the opiate on memory <b>consolidation.</b> No significant <b>differences</b> were evident between the effects of D 1 and D 2 receptor active compounds, thus suggesting that D 1 and D 2 receptor types are similarly involved in the effects of morphine on memory consolidation, in agreement with previously reported results.

This cross-sectional study investigates differences in declarative memory consolidation among children with primary snoring (PS) and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) compared to controls. We further investigate whether memory <b>consolidation</b> group <b>differences</b> are associated with NREM stage 2 (N 2) sigma (12 - 15 Hz) or NREM slow oscillation (0. 5 - 1 Hz) spectral power bands. In this study, we trained and tested participants on a spatial declarative memory task with cued recall. Retest occurred after a period of daytime wake (Wake) or a night of sleep (Sleep) with in-lab polysomnography. 36 participants ages 5 - 9 years completed the protocol: 14 with OSA as defined by respiratory disturbance index (RDI) > 1 /hour, 12 with primary snoring (PS) and 10 controls. OSA participants had poorer overall memory consolidation than controls across Wake and Sleep conditions [OSA: mean = - 18. 7 % (5. 8), controls: mean = 1. 9 % (7. 2), t = - 2. 20, P = 0. 04]. In contrast, PS participants and controls had comparable memory consolidation across conditions (t = 0. 41; P = 0. 38). We did not detect a main effect for condition (Sleep, Wake) or group x condition interaction on memory consolidation. OSA participants had lower N 2 sigma power than PS (P = 0. 03) and controls (P = 0. 004) and N 2 sigma power inversely correlated with percentage of time snoring on the study night (r = - 0. 33, P< 0. 05). Across all participants, N 2 sigma power modestly correlated with memory consolidation in both Sleep (r = 0. 37, P = 0. 03) and Wake conditions (r = 0. 44, P = 0. 009). Further observed variable path analysis showed that N 2 sigma power mediated the relationship between group and mean memory consolidation across Sleep and Wake states [Bindirect = 6. 76 (3. 5), z = 2. 03, P = 0. 04]. NREM slow oscillation power did not correlate with memory consolidation. All results retained significance after controlling for age and BMI. In sum, participants with mild OSA had impaired memory consolidation and results were mediated by N 2 sigma power. These results suggest that N 2 sigma power could serve as biomarker of risk for cognitive dysfunction in children with sleep disordered breathing...|$|R

40|$|During {{rehabilitation}} after stroke motor sequence {{learning is}} of particular importance because considerable effort is devoted to (re) acquiring lost motor skills. Previous studies suggest that implicit motor sequence learning is preserved in stroke patients but were restricted to the spatial dimension, although the timing of single action components {{is as important as}} their spatial order. As the left parietal cortex is known to {{play a critical role in}} implicit timing and spatiotemporal integration, in this study we applied an adapted version of the SRT task designed to assess both spatial (different stimulus locations) and temporal (different response–stimulus intervals) aspects of motor learning to 24 right-handed patients with a single left-hemisphere (LH) stroke and 24 age-matched healthy controls. Implicit retrieval of sequence knowledge was tested both at Day 1 and after 24 hr (Day 2). Additionally, voxel-based lesion symptom mapping was used to investigate the neurobiological substrates of the behavioral effects. Although LH stroke patients showed a combined spatiotemporal learning effect that was comparable to that observed in controls, LH stroke patients did not show learning effects for the learning probes in which only one type of sequence information was maintained whereas the other one was randomized. Particularly on Day 2, patients showed significantly smaller learning scores for these two learning probes than controls. Voxel-based lesion symptom mapping analyses revealed for all learning probes that diminished learning scores on Day 2 were associated with lesions of the striatum. This might be attributed to its role in motor chunking and offline <b>consolidation</b> as group <b>differences</b> occurred on Day 2 only. The current results suggest that LH stroke patients rely on multimodal information (here: temporal and spatial information) when retrieving motor sequence knowledge and are very sensitive to any disruption of the learnt sequence information as they seem to build very rigid chunks preventing them from forming independent spatial and temporal sequence representations...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Quantitative {{computed}} tomography (qCT) -based assessment of total lung weight (M(lung)) {{has the potential}} to differentiate atelectasis from consolidation and could thus provide valuable information for managing trauma patients fulfilling commonly used criteria for acute lung injury (ALI). We hypothesized that qCT would identify atelectasis as a frequent mimic of early posttraumatic ALI. Methods: In this prospective observational study, M(lung) was calculated by qCT in 78 mechanically ventilated trauma patients fulfilling the ALI criteria at admission. A reference interval for M(lung) was derived from 74 trauma patients with morphologically and functionally normal lungs (reference). Results are given as medians with interquartile ranges. Results: The ratio of arterial partial pressure of oxygen to the fraction of inspired oxygen was 560 (506 to 616) mmHg in reference patients and 169 (95 to 240) mmHg in ALI patients. The median reference M(lung) value was 885 (771 to 973) g, and the reference interval for M(lung) was 584 to 1164 g, which matched that of previous reports. Despite the significantly greater median M(lung) value (1088 (862 to 1, 342) g) in the ALI group, 46 (59 %) ALI patients had M(lung) values within the reference interval and thus most likely had atelectasis. In only 17 patients (22 %), Mlung was increased to the range previously reported for ALI patients and compatible with lung <b>consolidation.</b> Statistically significant <b>differences</b> between atelectasis and consolidation patients were found for age, Lung Injury Score, Glasgow Coma Scale score, total lung volume, mass of the nonaerated lung compartment, ventilator-free days and intensive care unit-free days. Conclusions: Atelectasis is a frequent cause of early posttraumatic lung dysfunction. Differentiation between atelectasis and consolidation from other causes of lung damage by using qCT may help to identify patients who could benefit from management strategies such as damage control surgery and lung-protective mechanical ventilation that focus on the prevention of pulmonary complications.
