5|$|Because of {{the ticket}} {{reselling}} {{that occurred during the}} week after the Super Bowl, and in order to limit that kind of profiteering, Hawaii Senate President Donna Mercado Kim introduced Senate Resolution 12, also known as the Bruno Mars Act. It limits all ticket purchases within 48 hours of the on-sale date to the physical box office. This ensures that anyone who comes to the box office to buy tickets for a show should almost <b>certainly</b> <b>be</b> guaranteed a ticket and discourages ticket scalping. The State Senate in Hawaii passed the law.|$|E
5|$|Only three Milky Way naked-eye {{supernova}} {{events have}} been observed during the last thousand years, though many have been seen in other galaxies using telescopes. The most recent directly observed supernova in the Milky Way was Kepler's Supernova in 1604, but the remnants of two more recent supernovae have also been found. Statistical observations of supernovae in other galaxies suggest they occur on average about three times every century in the Milky Way, and that any galactic supernova would almost <b>certainly</b> <b>be</b> observable with modern astronomical telescopes.|$|E
5|$|The {{estimated}} rate of supernova production in a galaxy {{the size of}} the Milky Way is about one every 50years. This is much higher than the actual observed rate, implying that a portion of these events have been obscured from the Earth by interstellar dust. The deployment of new instruments that can observe across a wide range of the electromagnetic spectrum, along with neutrino detectors, means that the next such event will almost <b>certainly</b> <b>be</b> detected.|$|E

5|$|Because the {{territorial}} boundary {{line between the}} U.S. and British North America (specifically, the province of Quebec until 1791 and Upper Canada thereafter) ran {{through the middle of}} Lake Erie and then up the Detroit River, combined with the prevailing belief regarding the location of the southern tip of Lake Michigan, the framers of the 1802 Ohio Constitution believed it was the intent of Congress that Ohio's northern boundary should <b>certainly</b> <b>be</b> north of the mouth of the Maumee River, and possibly even of the Detroit River. Ohio would thus be granted access to most or all of the Lake Erie shoreline west of Pennsylvania, and any other new states carved out of the Northwest Territory would have access to the Great Lakes via Lakes Michigan, Huron, and Superior.|$|E

25|$|The main {{portion of}} the story is a fiction set in a naturalistic world; in the postscript, magical {{elements}} have entered the narrator's world. The main portion could <b>certainly</b> <b>be</b> seen as a false document; the postscript dissolves the illusion.|$|E
25|$|The Pakistani opening bowlers {{developed}} prodigious Reverse swing {{with the}} old ball, and ripped through the England tail on numerous occasions. Although the quality of those batsmen could <b>certainly</b> <b>be</b> called into question, {{the ease with which}} Wasim and Waqar dismissed the lower order was a significant and series-winning difference for Pakistan.|$|E
25|$|The above {{result may}} or may not be {{perceived}} as surprising. A classical system would display the same property, and a hidden variable theory (see below) would <b>certainly</b> <b>be</b> required to do so, based on conservation of angular momentum in classical and quantum mechanics alike. The difference is that a classical system has definite values for all the observables all along, while the quantum system does not. In a sense to be discussed below, the quantum system considered here seems to acquire a probability distribution for the outcome of a measurement of the spin along any axis of the other particle upon measurement of the first particle. This probability distribution is in general different from what it would be without measurement of the first particle. This may <b>certainly</b> <b>be</b> perceived as surprising in the case of spatially separated entangled particles.|$|E

25|$|Butkus {{recovered}} 27 fumbles in his career, an NFL {{record at}} the time of his retirement. One of his greatest strengths was his ability to rip the ball from a ball carrier's hands. Although back then the statistic was not kept, it has been noted that Butkus would <b>certainly</b> <b>be</b> one of the all-time leaders in the forced fumbles category.|$|E
25|$|Supernatural explanations, such {{as those}} by Father Pio Scatizzi who argues that {{observers}} in Fátima could not be collectively deceived, or that the effect was not seen by observatories in distant places because of divine intervention have been dismissed by critics who say those {{taking part in the}} event could <b>certainly</b> <b>be</b> deceived by their senses, or they could have experienced a localized, natural phenomenon.|$|E
25|$|A {{response}} car {{is similar}} to a patrol car, but is likely to be of a higher specification, capable of higher speeds, and will <b>certainly</b> <b>be</b> fitted with audible and visual warnings. These cars are usually only used to respond to emergency incidents, so are designed to travel fast, and may carry specialist equipment, such as assault rifles, or shotguns. In the UK, each station usually only has one, which is called an area car.|$|E

25|$|As {{a general}} rule, Wallenstein {{is more about}} {{developing}} territories rather than conquering them. However, it can <b>certainly</b> <b>be</b> beneficial to take another player's territory after they have already spent resources to develop it. Because of the reliability of receiving victory points from buildings and the uncertainties of battles due to the cube tower, most players tend to avoid conflict {{in the first year}} in order to amass larger armies for the second year.|$|E
25|$|Mulroney's {{approval}} ratings declined and by 1993 opinion polls showed that his Progressive Conservative Party would almost <b>certainly</b> <b>be</b> {{defeated by the}} Liberals under Chrétien in the election due that year. Mulroney announced his retirement in February, and was succeeded by Minister of National Defence Kim Campbell in June. Campbell managed to pull the PCs to within a few percentage points of the Liberals {{by the time the}} writs were dropped in September.|$|E
25|$|Turkish and {{international}} media speculated that Recep Tayyip Erdoğan would almost <b>certainly</b> <b>be</b> the AKP's {{candidate for the}} Presidency. This was proven correct on 1 July when Erdoğan's candidacy was announced. Abdullah Gül, the outgoing President of Turkey elected in 2007 caused media speculation regarding a potential candidacy in January 2014. He {{announced that he would}} not stand on 29 June 2014. A full list of possible AKP candidates which at one point showed intentions of running for election is as follows.|$|E

25|$|If a {{solar eclipse}} occurs at one new moon, {{which must be}} close to a node, then at the next full moon the Moon is already {{more than a day}} past its {{opposite}} node, and may or may not miss the Earth's shadow. By the next new moon it is even further ahead of the node, so it is less likely {{that there will be a}} solar eclipse somewhere on Earth. By the next month, there will <b>certainly</b> <b>be</b> no event.|$|E
25|$|Given the benign {{nature of}} the {{condition}} and the low seizure frequency, treatment is often unnecessary. If treatment is warranted or preferred by the child {{and his or her}} family, antiepileptic drugs can usually control the seizures easily. Carbamazepine is the most frequently used first-line drug, but many other antiepileptic drugs, including valproate, phenytoin, gabapentin, levetiracetam and sultiame have been found effective as well. Bedtime dosing is advised by some. Treatment can be short and drugs can almost <b>certainly</b> <b>be</b> discontinued after two years without seizures and with normal EEG findings, perhaps even earlier.|$|E
25|$|The {{problem is}} that there are no traces of any Dorians {{anywhere}} until the start of the Geometric period about 950 BC. This simple pottery decoration appears to be correlated with other changes in material culture, such as the introduction of iron weapons and alterations in burial practices from Mycenaean group burials in tholos tombs to individual burials and cremation. These can <b>certainly</b> <b>be</b> associated with the historical Dorian settlers, such as those of Sparta in the 10th century BC. However, they appear to have been general over all of Greece; moreover, the new weapons would not have been used in 1200.|$|E
