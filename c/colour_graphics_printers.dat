50|$|Some {{dot matrix}} printers, {{such as the}} NEC P6300, can be {{upgraded}} to print in colour. This is achieved {{through the use of}} a four-colour ribbon mounted on a mechanism (provided in an upgrade kit that replaces the standard black ribbon mechanism after installation) that raises and lowers the ribbons as needed. <b>Colour</b> <b>graphics</b> are generally printed in four passes at standard resolution, thus slowing down printing considerably. As a result, <b>colour</b> <b>graphics</b> can take up to four times longer to print than standard monochrome graphics, or up to 8-16 times as long at high resolution mode.|$|R
25|$|The game {{uses the}} CGA display mode, the only <b>colour</b> <b>graphics</b> mode {{available}} on the original IBM PC. The mode allows four colours but in DONKEY.BAS there are usually only three on screen.|$|R
50|$|In 2000, version 2.94 was {{the first}} QL {{operating}} system that broke free of the bounds of the QL 8 colour screen, introducing GD2 (Graphic Device Interface Version 2), a QL compatible 16-bit high <b>colour</b> <b>graphics</b> sub-system.|$|R
5000|$|Later IBM <b>colour</b> <b>graphics</b> {{terminals}} were microprocessor driven {{and would}} not have produced flashing streaks. IBM decided to program them to re-create the [...] "green lightning", since the bug had become a feature - a phenomenon known as a misbug.|$|R
50|$|Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade: The Graphic Adventure is {{a popular}} graphic {{adventure}} game (similar to Maniac Mansion or The Secret of Monkey Island) released by LucasArts for DOS, Amiga, Atari ST and Macintosh systems in 1989. The player controls Dr. Jones as he interacts with various characters and visits areas from the film {{in order to find}} the secret of the Holy Grail. The game was re-released twice - first with 256 <b>colour</b> <b>graphics</b> and a full digital soundtrack, and later with 256 <b>colour</b> <b>graphics,</b> minor bugfixes and the original version's MIDI soundtrack. Of all the software adaptions of the film, this one is the most popular with both gamers and critics alike.|$|R
50|$|Access {{was through}} a 80 × 25 serial video terminal. Graphics {{capability}} was {{possible with the}} addition of a third-party <b>colour</b> <b>graphics</b> system from Robinson Systems which plugged directly into the Sage 68000 bus and provided output compatible with a range of colour monitors (e.g. Cotron Sword, Electrohome 1301).|$|R
50|$|To avoid {{attribute}} clash, static graphic displays had to {{be constructed}} with care. Finely-detailed <b>colour</b> <b>graphics</b> were impossible, as colour could only be applied in 8×8 pixel blocks. Careful design could achieve impressive results, as could synchronising colour changes to the refresh rate of the display—usually a television set.|$|R
50|$|With {{some very}} minor variations, the {{magazine}} {{has always been}} published in A5 format.
