5|$|During Western Australia's <b>convict</b> era, {{the prison}} {{was known as}} the <b>Convict</b> Establishment, and was used for convicts transported from Britain. Longer term local prisoners were also held there from 1858, at a cost to the colonial government, as the then-newly {{constructed}} Perth Gaol had been handed over to the British imperial government for use as a <b>convict</b> station for short term prisoners. Local prisoners were also been kept in the Round House, or on Rottnest Island. In 1876 Perth Gaol was transferred back to local control.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} shown that {{environmental}} parameters like changes in temperature and prior residence may affect the cichlid's territorial aggression. The <b>convict</b> cichlids are more aggressive at 30°C as opposed to 26°C, which may be {{explained by the fact that}} <b>convict</b> cichlids tend to set up their breeding sites and spawn at 30°C.|$|E

The respondents {{of the study were}} <b>convicted</b> women of Punjab which were lodged in Ludhiana, Patiala, Bathinda, Gurdaspur, Amritsar, Sangrur, Jalandhar and Hoshiarpur jails. Standard scores, means values, t-test and ANOVA were applied to analyze the data. Results of the present study were that <b>convicted</b> women have more personal satisfaction but less satisfaction from their marital life. There is no impact of age and education on life satisfaction of <b>convicted</b> women. Separated, divorcee and married <b>convicted</b> women are more satisfied from their life than widow and unmarried <b>convicted</b> women. Life satisfaction of <b>convicted</b> women does not depend on marital status. Personality has significant impact on life satisfaction of <b>convicted</b> women...|$|R

5|$|Built between 1857 and 1859, the {{hospital}} was a crucial component of Fremantle Prison. Public works during the <b>convict</b> era relied on <b>convict</b> labour, which could only be provided if the convicts were healthy. From 1886 to 1903, medical services were relocated to the main cell block, with the former building used to keep invalids and female prisoners. The hospital was refurbished and reopened in 1904. It subsequently remained in continuous operation until the prison's closure in 1991.|$|E

The Australian Federal Heritage Minister, Senator Ian Campbell, stated {{that it would be}} included in a nomination of eleven <b>convict</b> areas to become World Heritage Sites. Five years later, the prison was one of eleven former <b>convict</b> sites in Australia inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List in 2010 as the Australian <b>Convict</b> Sites.|$|E

25|$|Australian Jews never {{constituted}} {{more than}} 1% {{of the total}} colonial community. Eight <b>convicts</b> transported to Botany Bay in 1788 aboard the First Fleet {{have been identified as}} Jewish. There were probably more, but exact numbers are not possible as the transportation records did not indicate a <b>convict's</b> religion. Over a thousand more people of Jewish descent are estimated to have been sent to Australia as <b>convicts</b> during the next 60 years. Most of them came from London, were of working-class background and were male. Only 7% of Jewish <b>convicts</b> were female, compared to 15% for non-Jewish <b>convicts.</b> The average age of the Jewish <b>convicts</b> was 25, but ranged as young as 8 to some elderly people.

5|$|After some time, {{they might}} be sent to work on road or other {{projects}} away from these main settlements. Continued good behaviour could see the <b>convict</b> granted a ticket-of-leave, allowing private employment in a specified district of the colony, and eventually a Conditional Pardon, allowing most freedoms, except for returning to England. A Certificate of Freedom would only be granted {{at the end of}} a sentence. Misbehaviour would result in demotion through these levels of work, including returning to <b>convict</b> status within the prison. Re-offenders and captured escapees, after corporal punishment and time in solitary confinement, would be placed on a chain gang undertaking hard labour, typically on roads near Fremantle.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to examine the {{differences}} between <b>convicts</b> and persons with no criminal record, as well as between two groups of <b>convicts</b> ‒ the perpetrators of thefts and the perpetrators of robberies in terms of amorality and socio-economic characteristics. The sample comprised 100 male <b>convicts</b> (51 <b>convicted</b> of theft and 49 of robbery) and 100 males with no criminal record, matching the group of <b>convicts</b> in age. The subjects completed the AMRL 15 questionnaire and a socioeconomic characteristics questionnaire. The results of the descriptive discriminant analysis have indicated that almost all dimensions of amorality are more pronounced in the group of <b>convicts,</b> compared to persons with no criminal record, especially two dimensions within Amorality induced by impulsivity. <b>Convicts</b> are also characterized by economically disadvantaged families. On the other hand, persons <b>convicted</b> of theft are characterized by somewhat higher scores on two dimensions within the Amorality induced by brutality, while persons <b>convicted</b> of robbery have higher anthropological pessimism and more distinct problems with the primary family in terms of mentally ill parents. A general conclusion is that the three groups differ both with regard to amorality and to socio-economic characteristics...|$|R

5|$|During Western Australia's <b>convict</b> era, {{the prison}} {{was known as}} the <b>Convict</b> Establishment, and was used for prisoners transported from Britain. Longer term locally-sentenced prisoners were also held there from 1858, at a cost to the colonial government. In 1868, penal {{transportation}} to Western Australia ceased, and the number of convicts in the colony gradually declined, down to 83 in the mid-1880s. Due to the great expense of sending these convicts back to Britain, the authorities there negotiated with the colonial government to relinquish jurisdiction over them, as well as the prison complex – demolition was considered too expensive. Early negotiations had broken down, but were restarted in August 1883. After one and a half years, a compromise was reached, and the transfer was finalised on 31 March 1886.|$|E

Other elements which contribute to the site's overall heritage significance include the western workshops (1900); new division (1907); and conversion of service building to the female division and the addition of an eastern range (1889–1909).|$|E

5|$|Initially {{known as}} the <b>Convict</b> Establishment (or just The Establishment), Fremantle Prison was {{constructed}} between 1851 and 1859, using <b>convict</b> labour. It was initially used for convicts transported from Britain, but {{was transferred to the}} colonial government in 1886 for use for locally-sentenced prisoners. Royal Commissions were held in 1898 and 1911, and instigated some reform to the prison system, but significant changes did not begin until the 1960s. The government department in charge of the prison underwent several reorganisations in the 1970s and 1980s, but the culture of Fremantle Prison was resistant to change. Growing prisoner discontent culminated in a 1988 riot with guards taken hostage, and a fire that caused $1.8 million worth of damage. The prison closed in 1991, replaced by the new maximum-security Casuarina Prison.|$|E
