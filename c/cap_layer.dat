The use of limestone (Oneota dolomite—a sedimentary limestone composed mainly of calcium carbonate and magnesium) began with the need to improve city sidewalks, most of which were made of wood and burned in the 1862 fire that destroyed 90 percent of the downtown district.

This paper compares two structures, the HEMT with GaN <b>cap</b> <b>layer</b> and the HEMT without GaN <b>cap</b> <b>layer.</b> The sentaurus software simulates the DC and AC {{characteristics of the}} two AlGaN/GaN HEMT structures. The HEMT with GaN <b>cap</b> <b>layer</b> can increase the maximum transconductance gm from 177 ms/mm to 399 ms/mm when the doping concentration of the <b>cap</b> <b>layer</b> is 3 × 10 18 cm- 3 compared with the other structure under the same conditions.

40|$|Abstract. Sputter-deposited FePt films exhibit an {{in-plane}} {{magnetic anisotropy}} when they use MgO as <b>capped</b> <b>layer.</b> The perpendicular magnetic anisotropy of FePt films are enhanced by introducing Ag <b>capped</b> <b>layer</b> instead of MgO <b>capped</b> <b>layer.</b> Although the in-plane coercivity (Hc ⊥) of FePt films decreases slightly after introducing an Ag capper layer {{instead of a}} MgO <b>capped</b> <b>layer,</b> the perpendicular coercivity (Hc ⊥) is increased significantly from 3169 Oe to 6726 Oe. The Auger electron spectroscopy analysis confirms that the Ag atoms diffuse from <b>capped</b> <b>layer</b> into the FePt magnetic layer and the Ag atoms mainly distribute at the grain boundary of FePt. This phenomenon results in the grain boundary energy enhancement and the grain growth inhibition and therefore increases the perpendicular coercivity and decrease the grain size of the FePt film...|$|R
30|$|On the contrary, the Ru <b>cap</b> <b>layer</b> shows a {{completely}} inverse behavior {{compared to the}} Ag <b>cap</b> <b>layer.</b> This {{can be attributed to}} the higher melting point (2, 250 °C) than the FePt film, and the negative thermal stress − 0.54  GPa on FePt thin films listed in the Table  1. Based on the discussion above, the high melting point of Ru helps the Ru <b>cap</b> <b>layer</b> maintain a smooth continuous film until the ordered FePt particles are formed. And the negative thermal stress of the <b>cap</b> <b>layer</b> generates a total in-plane compression stress on the FePt film, which restrains the FePt ordering process. Lastly, we note that the effects of the <b>cap</b> <b>layer</b> on magnetism of 3 -nm-thick FePt films are much more pronounced than the 10 -nm-thick films under the same annealing temperatures.|$|E
30|$|A {{suitable}} <b>cap</b> <b>layer</b> {{is essential}} in magnetic recording media because it can affect the morphology, microstructure, and magnetic property of the magnetic films greatly. For example, Zhao et al. [11] found that the crystallographic ordering of the L 10 FCT FePt phase was significantly promoted when a Ag layer was deposited {{on top of the}} film; Yuan et al. [12] found that a Au <b>cap</b> <b>layer</b> was beneficial for FePt layer forming isolated grains and larger coercivity; Chen et al. [17] found that the exchange couple and magnetic reversal process can be controlled by the Cu <b>cap</b> <b>layer</b> diffusion in Cu/FePt/Pt/CrW multilayers. In this study, the effect of Ru and Ag <b>cap</b> <b>layer</b> on the microstructure and magnetic properties of ultrathin FePt films was investigated by using X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscope (SEM), vibrate sample magnetometer (VSM), and anomalous Hall effect (AHE). We found that the Ag <b>cap</b> <b>layer</b> segregates from the FePt/Ag bilayer after annealing, which lowers the FePt ordering temperature, promotes the FePt thin films to form island structure, and enhances the coercivity, whereas the Ru <b>cap</b> <b>layer</b> shows a completely inverse behavior. The effects can be mainly attributed to the different melting point and thermal expansion stress between the <b>cap</b> <b>layer</b> and the FePt thin films.|$|E

For first <b>capping</b> <b>layers</b> up to 3. 5 nm, the height of the QDs correspond to the thickness of the first <b>capping</b> <b>layer.</b> Nevertheless, for thicknesses higher than 3. 5 nm, a reduction in the dot height compared to the thickness of the first <b>capping</b> <b>layer</b> is observed.

40|$|In {{the design}} of rail track {{structures}} where the subgrade cannot achieve the desired capacity, enabling the required standard of track geometry to be maintained for the speed, axle load and tonnage to be hauled, a <b>capping</b> <b>layer</b> of granular material is placed between the natural ground or the embankment fill material and the ballast to protect the underlying weaker layers. In spite of the important {{role played by the}} <b>capping</b> <b>layer,</b> very little research has been carried out on its performance. The current practice of design of the <b>capping</b> <b>layer,</b> therefore, is based on working stress philosophy where reduced levels of stresses are assumed not to degrade the subgrade. Even on tracks containing a thick ballast layer that ensures allowable levels of working stress the subgrade has been found to have permanently deformed. Design of <b>capping</b> <b>layers</b> based on plastic deformation, therefore, appears appropriate. This thesis aims at determining the load levels that cause detrimental plastic deformation in the <b>capping</b> <b>layer.</b> The suite of material properties that characterise plastic deformations of <b>capping</b> <b>layer</b> is neither readily available nor easily determined. This thesis proposes a cheaper method of evaluating a range of <b>capping</b> <b>layer</b> material properties using penetration tests on specimens contained in California Bearing Ratio (CBR) test moulds coupled with a finite element modelling based back calculation technique.

30|$|In summary, {{the melting}} point and thermal {{expansion}} stress originating from different CTE {{plays an important}} role on the FePt/X (5  nm, X[*]=[*]Ag, Ru) bilayer annealing process. The Ag <b>cap</b> <b>layer</b> segregates from the FePt/Ag bilayer, lowers the FePt ordering temperature, promotes the FePt thin films to form an island structure, and enhances the coercivity. The Ru <b>cap</b> <b>layer</b> increasing the FePt ordering temperature helps to maintain smooth continuous surface, restrains the FePt (001) orientation and the perpendicular magnetic anisotropy. The effects become much more pronounced for the 3 -nm-thick FePt thin films.

Two types of amorphous dielectric layers, ZnS–SiO 2 and GeCrN, were used for sandwiching the SbxTe films to form typical trilayer stacks, which are the active part in applications. The nucleation and growth parameters of SbxTe films {{were found to be}} influenced by the dielectric <b>capping</b> <b>layers.</b> The crystal growth rate is temperature dependent and it reduces when the film is sandwiched between the dielectric layers. The reduction in growth rate differs with the <b>capping</b> <b>layer</b> type. The <b>capping</b> <b>layer</b> influence on the growth rate is pronounced at lower temperatures ~ 160 °C, but tends to vanish at higher temperatures ~ 200 °C.

40|$|This study {{examined}} the effect coextruding a clear HDPE <b>cap</b> <b>layer</b> onto HDPE/wood-flour composites has on the discoloration of coextruded composites exposed to accelerated UV tests. Chroma meter, XPS, SEM, and UV vis measurements accounted {{for the analysis of}} discoloration and degree of oxidation of both uncapped (control) and coextruded composites before and after UV exposures. Two separate discoloration characteristics occurred in the discoloration of composites. For uncapped WPCs (control), chemical changes due to photooxidation resulted in darkening followed by physical changes, including loss of colored wood components from the surface, as well as increased roughness on the surface, which led to lightening of WPCs. By contrast, because a hydrophobic <b>cap</b> <b>layer</b> prevented the loss of colored components from the surface, coextruding a clear hydrophobic HDPE <b>cap</b> <b>layer</b> over WPCs significantly decreased the discoloration during the weathering process. Photooxidation of wood components at the interface accounted for the discoloration of coextruded WPCs before the failure of <b>cap</b> <b>layer.</b> Moreover, as the <b>cap</b> <b>layer</b> absorbed a specified amount of UV light and reduced oxygen available to interface, it decreased the photooxidation rate at the interface compared to that at the WPCs surface. ...|$|E
