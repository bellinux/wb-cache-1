A complete RPV FE model is needed for the calculation of the stresses in the undamaged structure to be used as input for the calculation of the stress intensity factor KI by means of the “weight function” method. This is one step of the methodology developed at University of Pisa (UNIPI) for the deterministic analysis of PTS scenarios. Such methodology is based on the use of a chain of codes and starts with the thermal hydraulic analysis of the NPP with a system code (such as Relap 5, Cathare 2, etc.) for a selected transient scenario. The goal of this step is to estimate the cooling load induced on the internal RPV wall surface by the Emergency Core Coolant (ECC) injection, and provide boundary conditions for the next step. The region of interest is represented by the welding lines in the down-comer region. The next step consists of the 3 D analysis of the down-comer flow and of the temperature field in the RPV wall, using a CFD code with Conjugate Heat Transfer (CHT) capabilities. Once the pressure of the system and the temperature in the RPV wall is known, a stress analysis can be performed by means of a Finite Element (FE) structural mechanics code.

The list of SSCs and the associated degradation mechanisms [known as features, events, and processes (FEPs) ] were based on the list of used nuclear fuel (UNF) storage system SSCs and degradation mechanisms developed by the UFD Storage Task (Hanson et al. 2011). Other sources of information surveyed to develop the list of SSCs and their degradation mechanisms included references such as Evaluation of the Technical Basis for Extended Dry Storage and Transportation of Used Nuclear Fuel (NWTRB 2010), Transportation, Aging and Disposal Canister System Performance Specification, Revision 1 (OCRWM 2008), Data Needs for Long-Term Storage of LWR Fuel (EPRI 1998), Technical Bases for Extended Dry Storage of Spent Nuclear Fuel (EPRI 2002), Used Fuel and High-Level Radioactive Waste Extended Storage Collaboration Program (EPRI 2010 a), Industry Spent Fuel Storage Handbook (EPRI 2010 b), and Transportation of Commercial Spent Nuclear Fuel, Issues Resolution (EPRI 2010 c).

40|$|In this study, we {{investigate}} analytically and experimentally {{the roles of}} quasi-linearly polarized (LP), hybrid, plasmonic and photonic modes in optical detection and excitation with aperture tips in scanning near-field optical microscopy. Aperture tips are tapered and metal-coated optical fibers where small circular apertures are made at the apex. In aperture tips, there exist plasmonic modes that are bound at the interface of the metal cladding to the inner dielectric fiber and photonic modes that are guided {{in the area of}} the increased index in the dielectric fiber core. The fundamental photonic mode, although excited by the free-space Gaussian beam, experiences cutoff and turns into an evanescent mode. The photonic mode also becomes lossier than the plasmonic mode toward the tip aperture, and its power decay due to absorption and reflection is expected to be at least 10 - 9. In contrast, the fundamental plasmonic mode has no cutoff and thus reaches all the way to the tip aperture. Due to the non-adiabaticity of both modes' propagations through the taper below a core radius of 600 nm, there occurs coupling between the modes. The transmission efficiency of the plasmonic mode, including the coupling efficiency and the propagation loss, is expected to be about 10 - 6 that is at least 3 orders of magnitude larger than that of the photonic mode. Toward the tip aperture, the longitudinal field of the photonic mode becomes stronger than the transverse ones while the transverse fields always dominate for the plasmonic mode. Experimentally, we obtain polarization resolved images of the near-field at the tip aperture and compare with the x- and y-components of the fundamental quasi-LP plasmonic and photonic modes. The results show that not only the pattern but also the intensity ratios of the x- and y-components of the aperture near-field match with that of the fundamental plasmonic mode. Consequently, we conclude that only the plasmonic mode reaches the tip aperture and thus governs the near-field interaction outside the tip aperture. Our conclusion remains valid for all aperture tips regardless of the <b>cladding</b> <b>metal</b> type that mainly influences the total transmission efficiency of the aperture tip...|$|E

40|$|Insulated Rail Joints (IRJs) {{experience}} a much shorter fatigue life than continuous rail sections, especially IRJs located in heavy haul rail corridors. IRJs {{are one of}} the most critical components of the rail system since their failure can lead to multiple catastrophic consequences, including; malfunctioning of the track signalling system due to metal contact across the insulating rail gap and, in cases where joints are damaged at the fishplate or rail bolt holes, derailment of railway vehicles. A literature review on the topic revealed that these joints suffer from a wide range of damage, predominately resulting from either the gradual accumulation of metal under plastic flow across the railhead in the vicinity of the rail end post, or rail end spalling and/or rail end post insulation damage. Other failure modes relate to problems with fishplates/joint bar and rail bolt holes. These include: fishplate cracking, delamination of fishplates, bolt looseness and bolt hole cracking. Therefore, IRJs are regarded as high-risk component and are maintained via expensive maintenance programs requiring high standards. Every year rail operators around Australia and the world install tens of thousands of rail joints, due to their early failure, or the risk of failure of either the signalling system and/or the structural track integrity. For the Australian heavy haul rail industry, the economic costs of IRJ maintenance are very high. In this study, approaches to both advanced characterisation of IRJ damage and to improving IRJs service lifetimes were investigated. Damage accumulation in the vicinity of the joint was characterised by advanced metallographic (optical microscopy, SEM and TEM) and neutron diffraction techniques. In the early stage of the project, surface hard facing was selected as a potential approach to improving IRJ lifetimes, and surface clad rail samples were produced and studied via simulation testing and testing of ex-service rails. The initial hard facing experiments involved comparison of the performance of ex-service laser clad IRJ samples (431 stainless steel cladding produced by Jarvie Engineering Private Limited) with that of uncoated IRJ samples manufactured from normal head hardened 60 kg grade rail. The results indicated IRJ lifetimes can be improved by a hard facing of rail ends. Follow-up investigations were performed using both robots TIG MMAW hard facing deposition approach, and experimentation with a choice of <b>cladding</b> <b>metal</b> and geometry of the hard-face rail surface. Experimentation included advanced metallography and electron microscopy, and limited wear testing of cladding materials. Full-scale wheel on track rig testing was also performed on both coated and uncoated samples, which involves cyclic rolling contact loading on railhead surface was the main objective to investigate the railhead damage. It was concluded that ferritic type commercial hard facing alloys, and maraging steels, appear good candidate materials for hard facing by weld deposition in the vicinity of IRJs. They also appear more suitable than the initial 431 stainless steel used in the laser cladding experiments as deleterious effects of thermal contraction during cooling are less in the ferritic alloys. It was also concluded and that geometry of the hard facing profile should include a steep angle of hard facing with the rail surface where it intersects the top surface of the rail head. Neutron diffraction analysis of ex-service IRJs revealed significant stress evolution in the vicinity of the top surfaces of the rail ends abutting the insulating gap. This distribution is characterised by a compressive layer of approximately 5 mm deep and a counterbalanced tensile layer located 5 - 15 mm at the sub-surface region. It exceeded the distribution along the continuous rail. Residual stresses analysis for the laboratory rig tested rail ends revealed similar characteristic to those found in ex-service rail ends. However, in contrast to the ex-service rail ends, the stress distributions in the test rig samples were slightly different and this difference was attributed to the localization of wheel load under the particular test conditions. A separate neutron diffraction examination of residual stresses near bolt-holes across ex-service IRJ fishplates revealed a stress evolution characterised by both compressive and tensile stresses, extended in a 900 and 450 angles to the longitudinal plane. The later results were consistent with a common observation of fishplate fracture originating at bolt holes at 450 to the running rail surface...|$|E

To accomplish the objectives, aluminum 1100 sheet (Al 1100) and stainless steel 304 sheet (SST 304) are bonded by warm rolling under controlled conditions. The 180 degrees peel test is used to determine the bonding property of those <b>clad</b> <b>metals.</b> The experimental results show that the rolling thickness reduction and the entry temperature are two major factors of bonding strength. Minimum thickness reduction at a particular entry temperature is required to bond Al 1100 and SST 304. Increasing of either thickness reduction or entry temperature significantly improves the bonding strength between the two metals. X-ray microanalysis is also performed to characterize the diffusion state at the bonding interface. The diffusion coefficients of aluminum and iron are estimated through experimental method. A thermo-mechanical model was developed to describe the rolling plastic deformation of component metal sheets and the diffusion evolution during a roll bonding process of dissimilar metals. The effect of various rolling conditions on the contact area ratio was quantitatively discussed. Finite element simulation of 2 -D diffusion under the rolling created boundary conditions was performed. The peel strength during the diffusion evolution was predicted by the integrated roll bonding model. The modeling predictions correspond to the experimental results well. The correspondence validates the effectiveness of the thermo-mechanical roll bonding model. Based on experimental observation, this research presents a bonding mechanism for the roll cladding process of dissimilar metals. The roll bonding model can help optimize rolling parameters for varying bonding strength depending on the demands of the application. It can also provide insights into design and analysis of rolling bonding process of other groups of dissimilar metal sheets...|$|R
