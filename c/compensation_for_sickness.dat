2500|$|The mutiny at Spithead (an {{anchorage}} near Portsmouth) {{lasted from}} 16 April to 15 May 1797. Sailors on 16 {{ships in the}} Channel Fleet, commanded by Admiral Lord Bridport, protested against the living conditions aboard Royal Navy vessels and demanded a pay rise, better victualling, increased shore leave, and <b>compensation</b> <b>for</b> <b>sickness</b> and injury. On 26 April a supportive mutiny broke out on 15 ships in Plymouth, who sent delegates to Spithead {{to take part in}} negotiations.|$|E
30|$|The <b>compensation</b> <b>for</b> <b>sickness</b> absence {{has been}} close to the normal wage in Italy during the period we consider. Thus, the {{decision}} for the worker of whether to be present at work cannot be simply explained with the wage penalty deriving from a day of absence. Other types of incentives offered by firms {{play a role in}} affecting the employee’s decision. The threat of dismissal if a worker is perceived as less productive or is considered a ‘shirker’ by his employer is arguably a powerful mechanism in inducing an employee to work hard and not indulging in too many absences (Hesselius 2007).|$|E
40|$|Aim: The aim of {{the present}} study was to analyse if the {{localization}} of unspecific back disorders influenced the yearly direct and indirect costs during a five year period; 1996 to 2001. Methods: Based on the location and the recurrence of neck/shoulder disorders (NSD) and low back disorders (LBD) disorders, 2057 individuals were grouped into six different disorder groups and one control group without disorders. Direct costs were calculated using self-reported data on drug use, health care utilization and ergonomic interventions. Indirect costs were calculated using yearly collected individual register data on personal income and government <b>compensation</b> <b>for</b> <b>sickness</b> absence. The costs for each of the six groups with NSD and/or LBD were estimated by subtracting the costs in the control group from the costs in each disorder group with NSD/LBD. Adjustments were made for age, gender, and other diseases. Results: The indirect costs were ten times higher than the direct costs. The total average individual costs for the subjects with co-occurrence NSD and LBD was $ 6. 000 for the year 2001. This was three to four times higher than for those with solely NSD or solely LBD. The largest increase in costs between 1996 and 2001 was seen in this group. Conclusion: Further studies are required to identify which characteristics in work environment or in life style that causes recurrent and concurrent NSD and LBD...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to {{investigate}} gender policy and gender equality as determinants of health. Data at individual, municipal and country level were employed, and the settings were Sweden and 22 OECD countries. The studies span the time period 1973 - 2008. In Study I, gender equality at municipal level (N= 289) was measured using indicators of political participation, division of labour in {{the private and public}} spheres, and the distribution of economic resources. The outcomes were life expectancy and number of days of <b>compensation</b> <b>for</b> <b>sickness</b> absence and disability. The data were cross-sectional (2000 - 2004) and linear regression was used. Gender equality was correlated with lower life expectancy and higher levels of sickness and disability for both men and women. In Study II, a cohort of parents (N of approx. 75, 000) were followed from 1980 to 1999. The aim was to assess possible interaction between gender equality at couple (between partners) and local level. For this purpose, a combinatorial index was constructed. The outcome was number of days compensated from sickness insurance during 1986 - 1999, with a cut-off point at the 85 % percentile. Logistic regression was used. Among fathers, those who were traditionally unequal with their partner and lived in an equal municipality had higher levels of sick-leave. Mothers who earned less and/or had a lower occupational position than their partner had lower levels of sick-leave, especially when they lived in a traditional municipality. Study III aimed to classify 22 OECD countries into homogenous clusters, using hierarchical cluster analysis for 1979, 1989, 1999 and 2004. Included were indicators of taxes, parental leave, pensions, social insurances and social services in kind to reflect Sainsbury’s three gender policy regimes. The empirical classification did not completely correspond to Sainsbury’s theoretical typology. Rather than an emerging separate gender roles regime, there was a compensatory breadwinner cluster, distinguished by compensatory measures in the pension system directed at carers and extended childcare leave following maternity leave. A male breadwinner cluster was found, with the core feature of having a tax system that supports single (as opposed to dual) earner families. From 1989 there was an earner-carer cluster, characterised by generous parental leave, high social services expenditure, and universal basic pensions. In Study IV, the cluster solution for 2004 and specific policy indicators for 1973 - 2008 were used as predictors, and the outcomes were mortality from external causes and circulatory disease. For this repeated measures model, hierarchical linear regression was used. Both the earner-carer cluster and specific policies, i. e. generous parental leave, high social services expenditure and universal basic pensions, were associated with a smaller gender gap in external cause mortality, primarily due to increased female mortality. For circulatory disease mortality, both the earner-carer and the compensatory breadwinner cluster experienced a larger decrease in male mortality over time. In conclusion, the relationship between gender equality and health differed according to the unit of analysis and the outcome studied, and also varied between men and women. Based on these results, hypotheses for future studies are formulated...|$|E

40|$|Aims: We {{analyzed}} the redistributive outcomes <b>for</b> <b>sickness</b> benefits using a typology of social insurance institutions compared to external factors <b>for</b> <b>sickness</b> risk. Material: Unbalanced panel {{data of the}} Luxembourg Income Study on household earnings, sickness benefits and labour force demography (OECD data) and educational attainment were employed. Method: Gini-coefficients were used for measuring earnings inequality. Relative changes in earnings inequality <b>for</b> <b>sickness</b> benefits were explained by social insurance institutional dummies using multiple regression analyses. Demography and education were included in an extended model. Results: The typology explained the redistributive outcomes as expected. When adding external variables, the observed pattern of the typology could not be repeated. Conclusions: Our {{results indicate that the}} demographic structure and educational attainment have a stronger influence on the redistributive outcome of sickness benefits than the established social insurance typology...|$|R

40|$|This study {{examined}} whether <b>compensation</b> <b>for</b> coarticulation in fricative–vowel syllables is phonologically mediated or {{a consequence of}} auditory processes. Smits (2001 a) had shown that <b>compensation</b> occurs <b>for</b> anticipatory lip rounding in a fricative caused by a following rounded vowel in Dutch. In a first experiment, the possibility that compensation is due to general auditory processing was investigated using nonspeech sounds. These did not cause context effects akin to <b>compensation</b> <b>for</b> coarticulation, although nonspeech sounds influenced speech sound identification in an integrative fashion. In a second experiment, a possible phonological basis <b>for</b> <b>compensation</b> <b>for</b> coarticulation was assessed by using audiovisual speech. Visual displays, which induced the perception of a rounded vowel, also influenced <b>compensation</b> <b>for</b> anticipatory lip rounding in the fricative. These results indicate that <b>compensation</b> <b>for</b> anticipatory lip rounding in fricative–vowel syllables is phonologically mediated. This result is discussed {{in the light of}} other compensation-for-coarticulation findings and general theories of speech perception...|$|R
