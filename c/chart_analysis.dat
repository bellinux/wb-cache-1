50|$|The {{principles}} of technical analysis {{are derived from}} hundreds of years of financial market data. Some aspects of technical analysis {{began to appear in}} Amsterdam-based businessman Joseph de la Vega's accounts of the Dutch financial markets in the 17th century. In Asia, technical analysis {{is said to be a}} method developed by Homma Munehisa during the early 18th century which evolved into the use of candlestick techniques, and is today a technical analysis charting tool. In the 1920s and 1930s Richard W. Schabacker published several books which continued the work of Charles Dow and William Peter Hamilton in their books Stock Market Theory and Practice and Technical Market Analysis. In 1948 Robert D. Edwards and John Magee published Technical Analysis of Stock Trends which is widely considered to be one of the seminal works of the discipline. It is exclusively concerned with trend analysis and chart patterns and remains in use to the present. Early technical analysis was almost exclusively the analysis of charts, because the processing power of computers was not available for the modern degree of statistical analysis. Charles Dow reportedly originated a form of point and figure <b>chart</b> <b>analysis.</b>|$|E

5000|$|The Japanese {{candlestick}} {{chart and}} OHLC charts show {{exactly the same}} data, i.e., the opening, high, low, and closing prices during a particular time frame. Day traders, who by default have to watch the price movements on a chart, prefer to use the Japanese candlesticks, because they show the [...] "live action" [...] price movements by expanding and contracting the candlestick's body, which is easier to grasp (and trade upon) than the standard OHLC bar. Therefore, for dynamic real-time <b>chart</b> <b>analysis,</b> Japanese candlesticks offer advantages over standard OHLC bars. [...] However, for technical analysis of static charts, such as after-market analysis of historical data, the OHLC bars have very clear advantages over the Japanese candlesticks: the OHLC bars do not require color or fill pattern to show the Open and Close levels, {{and they do not}} create confusion in cases when, for example, the Open price is lower than the Close price (a bullish sign), but the Close price for the studied bar is lower than the Close price for the previous bar, i.e. the bar to the left on the same chart (a bearish sign).|$|E
