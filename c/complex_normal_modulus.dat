The specimens were tensioned to failure after enduring a pre-set number of fatigue cycles at various load ratios (defined as the ratio of the maximum load in the fatigue test to the corresponding static strength). The aim of the study is to investigate the effect of fatigue loading on bond strength and failure modes. Both <b>normal</b> <b>modulus</b> (E = 240 GPa) and high modulus (E = 640 GPa) CFRP sheets were used in the tests. The experimental results were compared with those for specimens subjected to static tension alone. It was found that the failure modes of the CFRP-sheet bonded steel plates were not affected greatly by the fatigue loading except for those bonded with high modulus CFRP, where fiber fracture extended over more than one cross-section. The fatigue loads appear to have less effect on the bond strength of high modulus CFRP-sheet bonded steel plates.

40|$|It is well {{established}} that alkali aggregate reaction (AAR) causes extensive random cracking in concrete and reduces the tensile strength, modulus of elasticity and to a certain extent, the compressive strength. This would undoubtedly bring {{the safety of the}} structure into question and may require extensive repairs to be carried out. In this paper RC concrete columns together with concrete cylinders containing reactive aggregate in the form of fused silica were prepared and exposed to 38 °C and 100 % humidity to accelerate the AAR damage. The damaged RC columns were confined with one and two layers of high and <b>normal</b> <b>modulus</b> carbon fibre reinforced polymer (CFRP) and tested under uniaxial compression. A damaged column without CFRP confinement was also prepared for comparison purposes. The results show that the mechanical property of concrete damaged by AAR does not affect the load carrying capacity of RC column. Time of CFRP application and types of CFRP modulus provides active or passive confinement effect on RC columns. Confinement with high modulus CFRP is not effective in controlling the AAR expansion in the concrete due to its low tensile strain capacity.
