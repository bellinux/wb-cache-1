So far, none of these have been successful enough to reach the civilian market and gain commercial success. Even within the military market, use is limited. Around 1848, Sharps introduced a rifle and paper cartridge (containing everything but the primer) system. When new these guns had significant gas leaks at the chamber end, and with use these leaks progressively worsened. This problem plagues caseless cartridge and gun systems to this day.|$|E
50|$|The MEI HELLHOUND 40 mm Low Velocity Multi-Purpose Grenade is a fixed type {{ammunition}} {{designed to}} be fired from a 40 mm Grenade Launcher such as the M79, M203, M320 (attached to the M16 series of rifles or M4 carbine), or Milkor MK-1. The round consists of an A5 filled metal projectile body with a rotating band, a point initiating-base detonating fuze with Safe and Arm technology, and a cartridge <b>case</b> <b>assembly.</b> Upon impact with the target, the firing pin is driven into the detonator, which in turn initiates the spit backcharge, producing a jet which initiates the explosive train from the base forward, resulting in an armor-piercing jet of molten metal and fragmentation of the projectile body. The MEI Hellhound uses the same High-Low Propulsion System as other popular 40mm grenade launchers, which keeps the recoil forces in bounds for an infantry small arm.|$|E

40|$|For {{the past}} two decades, {{virtually}} all manufacturing companies in the United States have adopted or {{are in the process}} of adopting lean manufacturing. Globalization has resulted in the increased availability of reliable, low cost sources putting greater pressures on traditional US manufacturing companies to reduce costs. The need to successfully transform to lean has only grown in importance in this new operating environment, resulting in renewed focus on such initiatives in the United States. This thesis discusses various approaches to lean manufacturing with reference to specific examples from both academia and industry. In particular, lean transformation efforts in Mitchell Engine Company's* Final Assembly Plant will be provided as a case study. Focus on the JP- 3525 fan <b>case</b> <b>assembly</b> cell provides specific examples on how shop floor improvements, assembly cell redesign, and flow can improve process cycle time and decrease variability. The direct result of this work has been a 15 % decrease in cycle time and a 100 % decrease in variability in the JP- 3525 fan <b>case</b> <b>assembly</b> cell. Finally, the role front-line supervisors play in change initiatives will be introduced, discussing the position from both management and labor perspectives.

40|$|The {{system of}} {{correction}} coils (CC) is {{a component of}} the ITER magnet system, required to correct toroidal asymmetries and reduce error magnetic fields detrimental for physical processes in the plasma. It includes 18 coils, inserted in between toroidal field coils and poloidal field coils and split into 3 sets of 6 coils each: bottom correction coils (BCC), side correction coils (SCC), and top correction coils (TCC). BCC and TCC are planar coils, whereas SCC are wound on a cylinder. All CC coils are wound using a 10 kA NbTi cable-in-conduit conductor and are manufactured by ASIPP laboratory (Institute of Plasma Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences), under the responsibility of ITER China. A manufacturing line was installed in 2013 at ASIPP in a dedicated workshop for the construction of the CC. In order to qualify the manufacturing procedures, a comprehensive qualification program has been set up. This program includes a set of mock-ups, manufactured according to the process to be used for the coils and submitted to different tests. These qualification items are winding, insulation and vacuum pressure impregnation, helium inlet/outlet, terminal joints, case material, filler material between winding-pack and case, <b>case</b> <b>assembly,</b> and terminal service box. Qualification of conductor winding, He inlet/outlet manufacture, winding-pack turn and ground insulation installation and impregnation, case material, winding-pack-case filler material is achieved.

Joint qualification, relying on electrical tests of joints in a dedicated test facility, is nearly complete. Remaining qualification items are <b>case</b> <b>assembly,</b> winding-pack insertion into case, and case closure welding.

40|$|We {{report on}} a simple {{carbohydrate}} amphiphile able to self-assemble into nanofibers upon enzymatic dephosphorylation. The self-assembly can be triggered by alkaline phosphatase (ALP) in solution or in situ by the ALP produced by osteosarcoma cell line, SaOs 2. In the latter <b>case,</b> <b>assembly</b> and localized gelation occurs mainly on the cell surface. The gelation of the pericellular environment induces a reduction of the SaOs 2 metabolic activity at an initial stage (≤ 7 h) that results in cell death at longer exposure periods (≥ 24 h). We show that this effect depends on the phosphatase concentration, and thus, it is cell-selective with prechondrocytes ATDC 5 (that express ∼ 15 − 20 times lower ALP activity compared to SaOs 2) not being affected at concentrations ≤ 1 mM.

The layer protects the case from impulsive loads generated by a 20 MJ NIF capsule 10 cm from the sample <b>case</b> <b>assembly.</b> Impulse only from ablating x-rays and hohlraum plasma debris is considered. One dimensional CALE foam response calculations and analytic estimates are used to show that 1 cm of aluminum 6101 -T 6 foam 10 % of solid density is sufficient to attenuate the incoming peak pressure without complete melting on crush-up. Two dimensional DYNA calculations show that a 304 stainless steel spherical shell sample case with an inner radius of 1 cm and a wall thickness of 2 mm encased in 1 cm of foam does not yield to the pressure that is transmitted through the foam by a 220 Pa-sec (2. 2 ktap), 2 GPa (20 kbar) load due to recoil of x- ray ablation. An unprotected spherical shell case subjected to a gentler load with peak pressure reduced to 0. 2 GPa (2 kbar) not only yields but its effective plastic strain exceeds the failure point of 0. 4 in 304 stainless steel after 160 microseconds. Doubling the impulse for the protected case to approximately account for debris loading results in very localized yield and an effective plastic strain that does not exceed 0. 014. (U...|$|E
