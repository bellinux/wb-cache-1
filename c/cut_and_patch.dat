Gubbas {{have more of a}} folk flavour blankets <b>cut</b> <b>and</b> <b>patched</b> into geometric patterns, with limited, embroidery on joining and open space. It is more like appliqué work. Colours are bright and attractive. They are cheap and used for dewan covering or as floor covering—namdas.|$|R

No stranger was I to this beautiful treacherous Spanish brush! I shared with Copple a dislike of it almost {{equal to that}} inspired by cactus. We soon were hot, dusty, dry, and had begun to sweat. The immense distances of the place were what continually struck me. Distances that were deceptive--that looked short and were interminable! That was Arizona. We covered miles in our detours {{and we had to}} travel fast because we knew Edd could round the base of the lower points in quick time.|$|R
40|$|My project {{applies the}} {{theoretical}} {{notion of the}} tactic, as defined by Michel de Certeau in The Practice of Everyday Life, {{as a model for}} art practice. Beginning with images of <b>cut</b> <b>and</b> <b>patched</b> sidewalks, I propose art-making as a way to respond to the accidental and unconsidered aspects of the built world. I try a number of different approaches to a tactical art-making, evaluating each attempt against de Certeau’s descriptions of tactical and strategic operations. With each approach, I encounter paradoxes and contradictions, and ultimately conclude that artwork can never be solely tactical. In spite of these difficulties, de Certeau’s ideas successfully facilitate the development of a broad artistic practice. My final series of work proposes site-specificity as a way to contain the strategic authority that artwork exerts, and begins to look to Gilles Deleuze’s notion of the diagram as a way for my practice to move forward...|$|R

5000|$|The idea {{stayed in}} Bare's head {{for two years}} before he decided to pursue it. [...] "I had a script I had written called The Squirrel which had been on the market but hadn't sold, so I just <b>cut</b> it up <b>and</b> <b>patched</b> scenes {{together}} here and there to make two parallel scripts." [...] The script pages were divided in half, with each half of the page corresponding to what was to appear on screen. Finding a typewriter that could accommodate these unique needs proved challenging for the writer. [...] "My first problem was findinga typewriter with a carriage wide enough to take a legal-size piece of paper sideways, so I could type parallel scripts," [...] Bare said. [...] "Then I had to find a duplicating machine that would do the same thing." ...|$|R
40|$|The {{composite}} {{liquid hydrogen}} tank (tank # 1 of 2) for the X- 33 flight vehicle {{is made up}} of four lobes that have a sandwich construction, bonded to a frame of longerons. Lobes 1 and 4 showed local disbonds to the longerons they were bonded to. The 'bad' areas were <b>cut</b> away <b>and</b> <b>patched</b> with new material. The new material was cured by placing the entire tank in a heated autoclave with no pressure. Upon removal from the autoclave, it was noted that lobe 1 had severe skin/core disbonds on the inner and outer skins. The skins on this lobe were cracked as well. The core was disbonded from the inner skin across the entire acreage, except for spots around the lobe perimeter. The outer skin was separated from the core in a region {{near the center of the}} lobe. Lobe 1 was removed from the tank on January 13, 1999. Bolts were placed through the lobe to hold it together <b>and</b> the <b>cuts</b> on the inner skin were not continuous, but 'tabs' were left for final cutting and removal. Upon closer inspection of the disbonded basesheet, it was noted that there was a lack of filleting into the honeycomb core. Good fillets are critical to bond strength...|$|R

40|$|The Iowa DOT {{has been}} using the AASHTO Present Serviceability Index (PSI) rating {{procedure}} since 1968 to rate the condition of pavement sections. A ride factor and a cracking <b>and</b> <b>patching</b> factor make up the PSI value. Crack <b>and</b> <b>patch</b> surveys have been done by sending crews out to measure and record the distress. Advances in video equipment and computers make it practical to videotape roads and do the crack <b>and</b> <b>patch</b> measurements in the office. The objective {{of the study was}} to determine the feasibility of converting the crack <b>and</b> <b>patch</b> survey operation to a video recording system with manual post processing. The summary and conclusions are as follows: Video crack <b>and</b> <b>patch</b> surveying is a feasible alternative to the current crack <b>and</b> <b>patch</b> procedure. The cost per mile should be about 25 percent less than the current procedure. More importantly, the risk of accidents is reduced by getting the people and vehicles off the roadway and shoulder.

40|$|AbstractA {{modified}} mixed variational {{principle for}} piezoelectric materials is established and the state-vector equation of piezoelectric plates is deduced {{directly from the}} principle. Then the exact solution of the state-vector equation is simply given, {{and based on the}} semi-analytical solution of the state-vector equation, a realistic mathematical model is proposed for static analysis of a hybrid laminate and dynamic analysis of a clamped aluminum plate with piezoelectric patches. Both the plate <b>and</b> <b>patches</b> are considered as two three-dimensional piezoelectric bodies, but the same linear quadrilateral element is used to discretize the plate <b>and</b> <b>patches.</b> This method accounts for the compatibility of generalized displacements and generalized stresses on the interface between the plate <b>and</b> <b>patches,</b> <b>and</b> the transverse shear deformation and the rotary inertia of the plate <b>and</b> <b>patches</b> are also considered in the global algebraic equation system. Meanwhile, there is no restriction on the thickness of plate <b>and</b> <b>patches.</b> The model can be also modified to achieve a semi-analytical solution for the transient responses to dynamic loadings and the vibration control of laminated plate with piezoelectric patches or piezoelectric stiffeners...|$|R

40|$|Prior to {{handling}} test materials, performing equipment setups, and/or conducting this method, testers {{are required}} to read “SAFETY AND HEALTH ” in Part 8, Section G of this method. It {{is the responsibility of}} the user of this method to consult and use departmental safety and health practices and determine the applicability of regulatory limitations before any testing is performed. A. SCOPE This method covers the procedures to be used to determine the suitability of organic and inorganic materials to be used for overlay of Portland cement concrete pavement or structures or for patching spalls in Portland cement concrete. Material set time, compressive strength, flexural strength, bonding strength, chord modulus of elasticity, specific gravity, and absorption are covered. Further testing may be necessary to fully evaluate most materials. This standard may involve hazardous materials, operations, and equipment. This standard does not purport to address all of the safety problems associated with its use. This test method is divided into the following parts: 1. Method of test for compressive strength and flow of overlay <b>and</b> <b>patching</b> materials (using 50 -mm cube specimens). 2. Method of test for set time of concrete overlay <b>and</b> <b>patching</b> material by Gillmore Needles. 3. Method for fabricating concrete specimens of overlay <b>and</b> <b>patching</b> materials. 4. Method of test for flexural strength of concrete overlay <b>and</b> <b>patching</b> materials. 5. Method of test for bonding strength of concrete overlay <b>and</b> <b>patching</b> materials to PCC. 6. Method for fabricating PCC blocks for use in the bond test. 7. Method of test for chord modulus of elasticity of concrete overlay <b>and</b> <b>patching</b> specimens (compressometer method). 8.
