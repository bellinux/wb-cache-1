5000|$|Mowing and {{properly}} labeled herbicides are recommended for weed control. <b>Chemical</b> <b>weed</b> <b>control</b> {{can be used}} in the fall prior to establishment, or before or after planting. Weeds should be mowed just above the height of the growing switchgrass. Hormone herbicides, such as 2,4-D, should be avoided as they are known to reduce development of switchgrass when applied early in the establishing year. [...] Plantings that appear to have failed due to weed infestations are often wrongly assessed, as the failure is often more apparent than real. Switchgrass stands that are initially weedy commonly become well established with appropriate management in subsequent years.Once established, switchgrass can take up to three years to reach its full production potential. Depending on the region, it can typically produce 1/4 to 1/3 of its yield potential in its first year and 2/3 of its potential in the year after seeding.|$|E

The experiment was conducted incomplete randomized blocks design with three replications at the Research Farm of Islamic Azad University of Tabriz Branch in 2013. According to the results, maintenaning the farm for 40 and 60 days under weed interference after 20 days prevented reduction of maize biomass, while weeds interference after 20 days, <b>weed</b> interference and <b>controling</b> <b>weeds</b> after 40 and 60 days resulted in 41. 2 %, 35 %, 25 % and 32. 5 % reduction of forage maize biomass, respectively. Reduction in fresh weight {{of corn and}} fresh weight of leaf and stem were also observed due to interference of weeds after 20 days. If <b>weeds</b> are <b>controlled</b> after 60 days, reduction of corn weight and fresh weight of stem will also results in reduction of biomass. Also, if <b>weeds</b> are <b>controlled</b> after 40 days, stem fresh weight of maize will result in biomass reduction. Corn traits were affected by <b>weeds</b> <b>control</b> treatments.

Winter and summer annual broadleaf weeds have an important economic impact on Nebraska winter wheat. They compete with winter wheat for water, light, space, and nutrients, reducing Nebraska winter wheat yields by an estimated 10 percent each year. The dollar loss, with wheat at $ 2. 50 per bushel, is over $ 2. 1 million per year. Weeds also slow harvest and increase combine repair costs. Producers may be docked at the elevator for excessive grain moisture and/or weed seeds in wheat. Success with reduced and no-till programs is improved with weed-free winter wheat stubble after harvest. In addition, weed seeds from the current crop will survive in the soil and cause problems in future crops.

The experiment was conducted on the experimental farm of Department of Agricultural and Environmental Engineering, University of Agriculture, Makurdi. The field was laid out in a randomized complete block design (RCBD) with four treatments and three replications. The treatments were ploughing and harrowing once (PH), ploughing and harrowing twice (PHH), ploughing and harrowing thrice (PHHH) and no – tillage (NT). A 75 Hp four – wheel drive MF 375 E tractor, 3 – discs MF plough and 14 – discs offset MF harrow were used for the tillage operations. The parameters studied were weed destruction and re – emergence. The total rainfall within the period was 928. 7 mm. Atmospheric temperatures fluctuated between 32 ºC and 39 ºC and the relative humidity was between 70 % and 86 %. Results showed that the soil of the experimental plot was generally dark and was predominantly sandy. Ploughing and harrowing thrice cut down the highest number of weeds and gave the best soil conditions which yielded the least number of weed re – emergence.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} 3 -year {{field study}} was to {{evaluate}} the effect of some stubble crops and weed control methods on the species composition, number and air-dry weight of weeds in a spring barley crop grown in short-term monoculture. The {{study was conducted in}} the period 2009 – 2011 at the Uhrusk Experimental Farm, on mixed rendzina soil classified as very good rye soil complex. It included stubble crops which were ploughed under in each year (control treatment without cover crop, white mustard, lacy phacelia, a mixture of legumes – narrow-leaf lupin + field pea) and 3 weed control methods used in spring barley crops (mechanical, mechanical and chemical, <b>chemical</b> <b>weed</b> <b>control).</b> Veronica persica was the weed species that occurred in greatest numbers in the spring barley crop sown after stubble crops. All cover crops reduced the numbers of Avena fatua which was the dominant species in the control treatment.

The objective is to develop a method of economic analysis of alternative herbicide practices. The data used were taken from a Druchamp winter wheat trial conducted on the Hyslop Agronomy Research Station at Oregon State University in 1966. Diuron and linuron were used at four dosage levels at pre and postemergence. Production functions for the four herbicide treatments were determined for all alternatives. Price ratios of herbicide and wheat were used to determine points of profit maximization. Limits were established for levels of profitable herbicide use. Within these limits, alternatives may be selected depending on the prevailing price ratio conditions. The results from this analysis are in no way indications of recommended herbicide practice due to the experimental data used. One practice however, was found to be superior to all other alternatives in this problem analysis. In the concluding remarks, the values and limitations of this approach are discussed.

(Field bind weed), Trianthema monogymna L., Cuprus rotundus L., Sorghun helepense L. (Pers), Digera avensis L., Echinochloa colona L. (Link) and Cynodon dctylon L. (Pers) during both the study years. The effect of these <b>weed</b> <b>control</b> measures on yield and yield components of wheat (Triticum aestivum (L) Corn (Zea mays L.), Mungbean (Vigna radiata) and cowpeas (Vigna unguiculata) was assessed. Different <b>weed</b> <b>control</b> methods suppressed significantly weed population, fresh and dry matter and increased mortality percentage of weeds under study. Among different <b>weed</b> <b>control</b> techniques, integrated <b>weeding,</b> i. e., <b>chemical</b> <b>weeding</b> at 2 - 3 leaf stage of weeds with a fallow-up hand weeding after 50 days of crop sowing (WC 6) gave promising results closely followed by Mechanical weeding after 20 days of crop sowing with a follow-up hand weeding after 50 days of crop sowing (WC 5) and/or two hand weedings after 20 and 40 days of crop sowing (WC 2). Maximum weed mortality percentage was noted with these treatments. These <b>weed</b> <b>control</b> methods out yielded the yield and yield components of crops under study during both the study years (2003 - 2004). The economic analysis of these <b>weed</b> <b>control</b> techniques showed again better performance of WC 6 (<b>Chemical</b> <b>weeding</b> at 2 - 3 leaf stage of weeds + Hand Weeding at 50 DAS) as compared to rest of the treatments under all cropping patterns {{during the study period}} (2003 - 2004). Maximum percentage value of harvest index was calculated with WC 6 for all cropping patterns. A significant positive interaction between cropping patterns and <b>weed</b> <b>control</b> methods was observed during both of the years...|$|R
40|$|Herbicides and {{fungicides}} {{are widely}} used to kill weeds and plant pathogens in agricultural crops. CropLife Foundation assessed the value of herbicides and fungicides to U. S. farmers by evaluating crop losses to weeds and diseases and quantifying the cost and effectiveness of chemical and alternative control methods. These studies clearly identify barriers {{to the adoption of}} non-chemical methods of pest control as potential replacements for synthetic <b>chemical</b> pesticides. Non-chemical <b>weed</b> <b>control</b> relies primarily on tillage and hand weeding, practices which are labor intensive and expensive. Lack of available labor and high wage rates prohibit use of these techniques for production agriculture. Further, expense involved in non-chemical <b>weed</b> <b>control</b> is a significant constraint to expansion of organic agriculture in the U. S. Genetic resistance to pathogens can be an effective non-chemical disease management tool, but it cannot replace fungicides. Incorporation of disease-resistant genes into desirable varieties is difficult, and genetic resistance commonly breaks down. Under such conditions, fungicides are the only responsive and reliable disease-control method. The comparative ineffectiveness of non-chemical pest-control methods, along with their expense and instability, makes synthetic chemical pesticides the only sustainable means of agricultural <b>weed</b> and disease <b>control.</b> Key words: crop losses, economics, fungicide, herbicides, pest managemen...|$|R
