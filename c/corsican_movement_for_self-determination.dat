50|$|During the 1950s, {{government}} policy changed toward American Indians, and politicians recommended termination {{of many of}} the tribes' special relationships with the government under federal recognition of their status, in favor of assimilation. Over 100 tribes were terminated; those that continued suffered from increased governmental paternalism. During the 1960s and later, with increased activism for civil rights and American Indian rights, the <b>movement</b> <b>for</b> <b>self-determination</b> gained strength.|$|R
50|$|In the mid-1990s, a youth led <b>{{movement}}</b> <b>for</b> <b>self-determination</b> rights {{began on}} the Internet.

Divisions soon emerged between radicals and moderates within ASFAR leading to the formation in 1998 of the National Youth Rights Association (NYRA). NYRA, founded by leaders of ASFAR and YouthSpeak, was founded to professionalize the youth rights movement.|$|R

50|$|During {{the late}} 1980s, {{repartition}} was repeatedly proposed by assorted individuals and small groups. It became popular in some {{sections of the}} Ulster nationalist movement, who were keen to establish a state with a large Protestant majority. Conversely, the Ulster <b>Movement</b> <b>for</b> <b>Self-Determination</b> proposed an enlarged state of Ulster, including all the historic province. This state, were it to have been created, would have had almost equal numbers of nationalists and unionists.|$|R

40|$|This article distinguishes {{resident}} and neighbourhood movements {{on the basis}} of their primary purpose: as <b>movements</b> <b>for</b> neighbourhood defence, <b>movements</b> <b>for</b> <b>self-determination,</b> <b>movements</b> <b>for</b> social inclusion, and <b>movements</b> <b>for</b> radical change. <b>Movements</b> <b>for</b> neighbourhood defence are further classified in terms of the primary threat against which the defence is aimed: excessive increases in rent or property tax, evictions, racial oppression, gentrification, privatisation, and loss of amenity or asset value. Particular attention is paid to the tenants' movement, arguing that it is primarily a <b>movement</b> <b>for</b> social inclusion. It is also argued that Bourdieu's concepts of habitus, field, and crisis provide an effective framework for making sense of {{resident and}} neighbourhood movement...|$|R

In April 2008, Chatterji and Imroz founded the International People's Tribunal on Human Rights and Justice (IPTK), which aims to document and internationally publicize the human rights abuses and state violence in the Indian Kashmir. The Tribunal also sought to document the state of juvenile justice, prisoner rights, the use of land-mines, illegal detentions, and minority issues. It also aimed to analyse the conditions in Kashmir wrought by the presence of Indian military, and the alleged subjugation of <b>movements</b> <b>for</b> <b>self-determination.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Muslim {{women have}} used sports {{as a way}} to {{challenge}} patriarchal norms. In a case study of the Palestinian women's national football team, Gieβ-Stüber and colleagues found that sport had become a [...] "social <b>movement</b> <b>for</b> <b>self-determination,</b> agency, peace and friendship" [...] in the players' lives. Several of the players also saw their athletics as opportunities to challenge assumptions about the roles and capabilities of women. Specifically, player Jackline Jazrawl wanted to use football to prove that [...] "women are free and can do whatever men do". Local Palestinian leaders supported this movement by providing free tickets to home matches, and thousands of men and women attended.|$|R
25|$|During {{the colonial}} period several nationalists {{initiatives}} were developed under the 'Bubi Union' or the 'Grupo Nacionalista Bubi'.

25|$|The Slovene People's Party {{launched}} a <b>movement</b> <b>for</b> <b>self-determination,</b> demanding {{the creation of}} a semi-independent South Slavic state under Habsburg rule. The proposal was picked up by most Slovene parties, and a mass mobilization of Slovene civil society, known as the Declaration Movement, followed. This demand was rejected by the Austrian political elites; but following the dissolution of the Austro-Hungarian Empire {{in the aftermath of the}} First World War, the National Council of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs took power in Zagreb on 6 October 1918. On 29 October, independence was declared by a national gathering in Ljubljana, and by the Croatian parliament, declaring the establishment of the new State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs.|$|R
2500|$|Egyptian Arabic has no {{official}} status, {{and is not}} officially recognized as a language. Standard Arabic, a modernized form of Classical Arabic (Koranic Arabic), is the official language of Egypt (see diglossia). Interest in the local vernacular began in the 1800s, as the Egyptian national <b>movement</b> <b>for</b> <b>self-determination</b> was taking shape. Questions about the reform and modernization of Arabic came to the fore, and for many decades to follow they were hotly debated in Egyptian intellectual circles.

50|$|During {{the latter}} part of the nineteenth century, the impulse towards {{autonomy}} which was felt by some of the propertied and educated elites was frustrated by international, political and economic circumstances outside their control. The production of sugar from cane continued to dominate the Caribbean economies, with oil, minerals and tourism becoming important items in the twentieth century. The influx of American capital and the gradual diminution of European interests in the Caribbean led to the expansion of American influence in the region from the turn of the century onwards, notably in Cuba, Haiti and Santo Domingo. This was the context in which the <b>movements</b> <b>for</b> <b>self-determination</b> worked, complicated everywhere by racial prejudice and disparities in the ownership of property.|$|R

25|$|World War I {{destroyed}} both empires. The Russian Revolution of 1917 led to {{the founding}} of the Soviet Union under the Bolsheviks, and subsequent civil war in Russia. A Ukrainian national <b>movement</b> <b>for</b> <b>self-determination</b> re-emerged, with heavy Communist and Socialist influence. Several Ukrainian states briefly emerged: the internationally recognized Ukrainian People's Republic (UNR, the predecessor of modern Ukraine, was declared on 23 June 1917 proclaimed at first {{as a part of the}} Russian Republic; after the Bolshevik Revolution, the Ukrainian People's Republic proclaimed its independence on 25 January 1918), the Hetmanate, the Directorate and the pro-Bolshevik Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic (or Soviet Ukraine) successively established territories in the former Russian Empire; while the West Ukrainian People's Republic and the Hutsul Republic emerged briefly in the Ukrainian lands of former Austro-Hungarian territory.|$|R
5000|$|Based out of Los Angeles, Gunnar’s stay in Hillside {{happens in}} the context of a {{predominantly}} Black but also Latino population. We are first introduced to the Latinos in Gunnar’s proximity when he walks the halls of his new school and notices the change over time of the school’s demographics. By the 1960s, {{in the context of}} the Civil Rights Movements and other subsequent community <b>movements</b> <b>for</b> <b>self-determination,</b> “The faces of these graduating ninth-graders are dark and overwhelmingly Latino and black.” [...] Gunnar walks down the hall and sees writing in Spanish—“Kathleen y Flaco para siempre con alma” sketched on the wall.

50|$|During the 1920s and 1930s {{there were}} some {{successful}} <b>movements</b> <b>for</b> <b>self-determination</b> in {{the beginnings of the}} process of decolonization. In the Statute of Westminster the United Kingdom granted independence to Canada, New Zealand, Newfoundland, the Irish Free State, the Commonwealth of Australia, and the Union of South Africa after the British parliament declared itself as incapable of passing laws over them without their consent. Egypt, Afghanistan and Iraq also achieved independence from Britain and Lebanon from France. Other efforts were unsuccessful, like the Indian independence movement. And Italy, Japan and Germany all initiated new efforts to bring certain territories under their control, leading to World War II. In particular, the National Socialist Program invoked this right of nations in its first point (out of 25), as it was publicly proclaimed on 24 February 1920 by Adolf Hitler.|$|R
5000|$|The Ulster Clubs {{also became}} {{influenced}} by the ideas of Ulster nationalism {{as an alternative to}} unionism, given that many saw the Anglo-Irish Agreement as a 'sell-out' by the Government of the state to which they claimed loyalty. Hugh Ross was a member and developed his Ulster Independence Movement from within the Ulster Clubs, whilst the Ulster <b>Movement</b> <b>for</b> <b>Self-Determination</b> also emerged from within the clubs. The Treasurer of the Ulster Clubs, Colin Abernethy, who was connected to Ulster nationalism, was killed by the Provisional Irish Republican Army while travelling to work on 9 September 1988. Abernethy was a close friend of Andrew Park who became leader shortly after his murder. The Ulster Clubs also published a document advocating the establishment of a [...] "Dominion of Ulster" [...] within the British Commonwealth penned by future Ulster Unionist Party leader David Trimble.|$|R
50|$|The idea enjoyed {{something}} of a renaissance {{in the aftermath of}} the Anglo-Irish Agreement, with the Ulster Clubs amongst those to consider the notion. After a series of public meetings, leading Ulster Clubs member, Reverend Hugh Ross, set up the Ulster Independence Committee in 1988, which soon re-emerged as the Ulster Independence Movement. After a reasonable showing in the Upper Bann by-election, 1990, the group stepped up its campaigning {{in the aftermath of the}} Downing Street Declaration and enjoyed a period of increased support immediately after the Belfast Agreement (also absorbing the Ulster <b>Movement</b> <b>for</b> <b>Self-Determination,</b> which desired all of Ulster as the basis for independence, along the way). No tangible electoral success was gained however, and the group was further damaged by allegations against Ross in a Channel 4 documentary on collusion, The Committee, leading to the group reconstituting as a ginger group in 2000.|$|R
