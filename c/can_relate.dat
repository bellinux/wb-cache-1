5|$|Aether is a {{video game}} {{designed}} by Edmund McMillen and Tyler Glaiel and published by Armor Games, released on September 3, 2008. Players control a lonely boy and an octopus-like monster that the boy encounters, solving puzzles on different planets to restore them from monochrome to color. The pair travel through space by swinging on clouds and asteroids with the monster's elongated tongue, searching other planets for life to which the boy <b>can</b> <b>relate.</b> It is {{also a part of}} The Basement Collection.|$|E

The Simons Foundation is an organization founded by Jim Simons and his wife Marilyn, and has awarded $130 million for autism research as of 2008. As scientific director, Fischbach collaborates with mathematicians, engineers, chemists, and neuroscientists to try and understand autism more completely. Currently, Fischbach oversees research focusing on the neurobiology of autism and how it <b>can</b> <b>relate</b> to finding a possible cure.|$|E

Fourth, to collect such intelligence as we <b>can</b> <b>related</b> to terrorist networks. Fifth, to collect such intelligence as we <b>can</b> <b>related</b> to the global network of illicit weapons of mass destruction. Sixth, to end sanctions and to immediately deliver humanitarian support to the displaced and to many needy Iraqi citizens.

5|$|The overall {{theme of}} the song puts me {{in the mind of}} a hit from R group Bell Biv Devoe circa 1990 that was also titled Poison, but doesn't fair the {{potential}} to be a number one song like it did close to 20 years ago. Even though the song doesn't seem like it would be a chart topper it does seem album worthy. It's something most <b>can</b> <b>relate</b> to if you've ever been in a relationship. Beyonce sings about a failed relationship that's no good, but yet is so hard to walk away from and ends up being just like Poison.|$|E

5|$|The {{theme of}} a heroine {{moving to a}} strange place where {{she does not know}} the local {{language}} is replicated in Ratnam's later films, Roja (1992) and Bombay (1995). The heroine has a dilemma; because she does not know the language in Delhi she can barely socialise with local people, and she is at loggerheads with the only person with whom she <b>can</b> <b>relate.</b> According to Rangan, the restaurant scene with Manohar and Divya is the first instance in Tamil cinema where a man invites a woman for a cup of coffee. He compared it to Oru Thalai Ragam (1980), in which the protagonists barely spoke. Ratnam said that he was inspired by the Doors and the Beatles and, although it was not uncommon to invite a woman for a cup of coffee, it was not reflected in the Tamil cinema of the time.|$|E

25|$|The {{anomalous}} {{dimensions in}} certain two-dimensional CFTs {{can be related}} to the typical fractal dimensions of random walks, where the random walks are defined via Schramm–Loewner evolution (SLE). As we have seen above, CFTs describe the physics of phase transitions, and so one <b>can</b> <b>relate</b> the critical exponents of certain phase transitions to these fractal dimensions. Examples include the 2d critical Ising model and the more general 2d critical Potts model. Relating other 2d CFTs to SLE is an active area of research.|$|E

25|$|Ubiquitin-mediated {{degradation}} of proteins occurs through the N-end rule pathway. In eukaryotes, including humans, the N-end rule pathway {{is part of}} the ubiquitin system. Composed of a highly selective single-residue code (a single amino acid nucleotide sequence), the N-end rule serves as a mechanism which <b>can</b> <b>relate</b> the stability of a protein to the identity of the amino acid at its N-terminus (the end of the polypeptide with an amino group, which in the ubiquitin system may be involved in the reactive destabilization of the protein).|$|E

25|$|Children {{learn about}} {{different}} gender categories by observing {{various forms of}} media. They often look for gender roles, with whom they <b>can</b> <b>relate</b> to, from books and television. Conversely, these sources of media will also stereotypically shape a child’s understanding for gender acceptable behaviors. Studies examining the effects of gender stereotyping in children’s literature describe that, most often than not, gender views are affiliated with stereotypes which are both culturally and individually constructed. In children’s literature, male characters {{appear to be more}} central as well as less emotional and stronger. Female characters on the other hand worked out their feelings through expression, they are more dependent and usually adopt the roles of more domesticated characters.|$|E
