And we have the advantage over Moses, for we suspect somebody, and he did not know whom to suspect. Certainly not Jethro Bass, the man that lived under his nose and never said anything--and had no right to. Jethro Bass had never taken any active part in politics, though some folks had heard, in his rounds on business, that he had discussed them, and had spread the news of the infamous ticket without a parent. So much was spoken of at the meeting over which Priest Ware prayed. It was even declared that, being a Democrat, Jethro might have influenced some of those under obligations to him. Sam Price was at last fixed upon as the malefactor, though people agreed that they had not given him credit for so much sense, and Jacksonian principles became as much abhorred by the orthodox as the spotted fever.|$|E

50|$|The key for {{comparing}} the displacement between the 4-cycle engine and the rotary engine is {{in studying the}} degrees of rotation for a thermodynamic cycle to occur. For a 4-cycle engine to complete every thermodynamic cycle, the engine must rotate 720° or two complete revolutions of the crankshaft. The rotary engine is different. The engine rotor rotates at 1/3 {{the speed of the}} crankshaft. On two rotor engines, front and rear rotors are 180° offset from each other. Each rotation of the engine (360°) will bring two faces through the combustion cycle (the torque input to the eccentric shaft). This said, it takes 1080° or three complete revolutions of the crankshaft to complete the entire thermodynamic cycle. Obviously, there is a disparity. How <b>can</b> <b>we</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> relatable number to compare to a 4-stroke engine? The best way is to study 720° of rotation of the two-rotor engine. Every 360° of rotation, two faces of the engine complete a combustion cycle. 720° will have a total of four faces completing their cycle. 40ci(654cc) per face times four faces equals 160ci or 2.6L. That's a well-reasoned number and now gives something that can be compared to other engines. In addition, since four faces passed by in the comparison, it’s like a four-cylinder engine. The 13B therefore compares well to a 2.6L 4-cylinder 4-cycle engine.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{consider}} the classical Connected Dominating Set (CDS) problem. Twenty years ago, Guha and Khuller developed two algorithms for this problem - a centralized greedy approach with an approximation guarantee of H(D) + 2, and a local greedy approach with an approximation guarantee of 2 (H(D) + 1) (where H() is the harmonic function, and D is the maximum degree in the graph). A local greedy algorithm uses significantly less information about the graph, and {{can be useful in}} a variety of contexts. However, a fundamental question remained - <b>can</b> <b>we</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> local greedy algorithm with the same performance guarantee as the global greedy algorithm without the penalty of the multiplicative factor of " 2 " in the approximation factor?

40|$|Abstract — Publishing person {{specific}} data while protecting privacy {{is an important}} problem. Existing algorithms that enforce the privacy principle called l-diversity are heuristic based due to the NP-hardness. Several questions remain open: <b>can</b> <b>we</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> significant gain in the data utility from an optimal solution compared to heuristic ones; can we improve the utility by setting a distinct privacy threshold per sensitive value; is it practical to find an optimal solution efficiently for real world datasets. This paper addresses these questions. Specifically, we present a pruning based algorithm for finding an optimal solution to an extended form of the l-diversity problem. The novelty lies in several strong techniques: a novel structure for enumerating all solutions, methods for estimating cost lower bounds, strategies for dynamically arranging the enumeration order and updating lower bounds. This approach can be instantiated with any reasonable cost metric. Experiments on real world datasets show that our algorithm is efficient and improves the data utility. I...|$|E
40|$|Is {{there such}} a thing as {{unadulterated}} nature? All that surrounds us is culturally modified by man somewhere along our past. But culture is only a fictitious conception itself, created in an attempt to break the world into controllable objects. So in what do we find culture? In everything? In the objects or the stories they embrace? Who chooses what’s worth saving and how to save? Choosing what is culture is made from personal, ingrained dichotomies of what’s important and what is not. A selective eye creates a distorted truth, which could have unintentional long-term effects. This thesis will give a historical account of the archaeological discipline’s development in tending to our cultural heritage. By demonstrating its many complications, with examples of forest remains, I will argue for the need of innovation, communication and documentation. Only then <b>can</b> <b>we</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> broader, more varied and slightly less modified picture of the culture we choose to keep...|$|E

The statement in quotations is already a description of that x and it takes 2 kt log t steps to output x. This shows that EASY n t,k ⊂ EASY n 2 kt log t,k. But is this exponential gap really needed?
