While serving in this position, Castle {{introduced}} {{a wide range}} of innovative welfare reforms, including the introduction of the mobility allowance, the Invalid <b>Care</b> <b>Allowance</b> (July 1976) for single women and others who give up their jobs to care for severely disabled relatives, the introduction of a non-contributory invalidity pension for disabled persons who had not qualified for invalidity pension, reforms in child allowances, and the linking of most social security benefits to earnings rather than prices.|$|E
25|$|The Conservatives {{argued that}} the GST cuts would benefit all Canadians, {{including}} low-income earners and those outside the workforce who do not pay income tax. The first GST cut went into effect on July 1, 2006, and no provinces have raised provincial sales tax yet. In addition, the Conservatives rolled back the income tax cut on the lowest tax bracket, restoring it back to 15.5% from 15%, increased and added tax exemption rates and introduced a $100 monthly child <b>care</b> <b>allowance</b> for families with children at or {{under the age of}} six. The Liberals and NDP voiced disapproval over the Conservatives following through on their election promise to replace the Liberal's proposed child care policy with their own, and for replacing Canada's $4 billion environmental policy with a $2 billion Conservative plan. The budget passed third reading without dissent on June 6, 2006 when the members of the Opposition accidentally failed to stand after the Deputy Speaker of the House called for debate.|$|E
2500|$|In the 2006 budget, the Tories {{introduced}} a new child <b>care</b> <b>allowance</b> that gives parents with children under six years of age an allowance of $1200 per year, which is taxable {{in the hands of}} the lower income parent. The allowance is not tied to actual child care expenses, and is available to all parents, regardless of whether or not they use childcare services. The measures have cost the government about $3.7 billion per year. This plan replaced the Liberal government's plan announced in the [...] under Paul Martin who committed $5 billion over five years to enhance and expand early learning and child care in collaboration with provinces and territories. After March 2007, the newly elected Conservatives under Stephen Harper eliminated the bilateral agreements as their first act of power. The child care plan agreements were based on Quebec's universal child care model and had been signed under Paul Martin's Liberal government with several provinces in 2005. [...] The plan was cancelled when they took office and was replaced by the Universal Child Care Benefit (UCCB) $100-a-month cheques for parents with young children with promised tax credits for private or profit care and up to $250 million annually to create child care spaces across the country.|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} {{the ways in which}} clients of social {{services}} in Milevsko and its surrounding areas use <b>care</b> <b>allowances.</b> The opening theoretical part briefly mentions the legislation and manners in which both financial and physical assistance was provided to physically handicapped persons before the Social Services Act came into effect. The second part of the thesis describes matters relating to the provision of <b>care</b> <b>allowances,</b> namely the filing of requests, the course of proceedings for the granting of <b>care</b> <b>allowances,</b> the right to the payment of <b>care</b> <b>allowances,</b> degrees of dependency, and the purposes for which <b>care</b> <b>allowances</b> are intended. The third part introduces the individual registered providers in Milevsko, namely what services they have registered, to whom these services are meant to be provided, and what scope of services the registered providers provide. The practical part traces the particular manners in which <b>care</b> <b>allowances</b> are utilized by their recipients in social services. The aim of the thesis is to find out whether <b>care</b> <b>allowances</b> are sufficient, whether recipients utilize them to buy these services and whether recipients only buy services from registered providers or whether they avail themselves of the care of family members or other natural persons as well...|$|R

40|$|Social care {{services}} in a certain region are highly affected by the demographic development. To evaluate the demand for social {{care services}}, the population, age structure, life expectancy, natality and mortality should be considered. There are 1691 inhabitants living in Vlachovo Březí as at 31 December 2008. Most social care services for the town residents are provided by other municipalities of the Prachatice district. The thesis was aimed at document analysis and a subsequent statistical procedure which, together with future demographic development, formed {{a basis for the}} prognosis of the demand for social care services in Vlachovo Březí at the age groups 0 - 7, 15 - 18 and 65 + years during the 2010 - 2020 period. The other goal was to find out the use of social <b>care</b> <b>allowances</b> by beneficiaries and financial costs of the allowances for 65 + age group in Vlachovo Březí. Based on the prognosis for single age groups and the evaluation of the current social services, the findings are as follows: As an early years child care service (0 - 7 years) does not exist in the district, a necessity of setting up such a facility, which will serve this age group in the district centre (Prachatice), can be expected. Social care services for the age group between 15 - 18 years are currently insufficient so to build a low-treshold facility should become a priority. The age group 65 + is supposed to grow. A senior home has not been established in Vlachovo Březí and the surroundings. There is a possible way in setting up a nursing home with a simultaneous enhancement of community care services. In addition, the research helped us discover the fact that expenses on the social <b>care</b> <b>allowances</b> are not spent effectively and financial costs of them will increase 1. 5 times in the next 10 years. The future revaluation of a current system of the allowance payment or a dependancy rate of the beneficiaries seems to be necessary. There are 1184 beneficiaries in the Prachatice municipality with extended competence as at 31 December 2009. This thesis can serve as a draft plan of social care services in the region. It can also be helpful in further research into this topic and the dissemination of the research findings...|$|R

40|$|The article {{intends to}} be a {{screening}} of family benefits in the 28 Member States of the European Union (EU) and {{to contribute to the}} research of shared trends with respect to family approach in these countries. Four types of family benefits including eight distinctive categories are analysed: child-benefit, child <b>care</b> <b>allowances,</b> child-raising allowances, and other benefits (birth and adoption grants, allowance for single parents, special allowances for children with disabilities, advance payments for maintenance and other allowances). The paper is based on primary and secondary analysis of 28 sets of national data provided through the European Union's Mutual Information System on Social Protection (MISSOC). Three categories of member states are considered: founder member states of the EU, other “old” member states, and the new Central and Eastern ones. Chronological development of national regulations with impact on family benefits is analysed in connection with the moment of becoming a member state. Various forms of family benefits legislation and their main subjects of interest are further researched. The last part of the article looks at the coverage of family benefits. Seven member states operate in this respect based on regulations adopted before EU accession. Belgium, Finland, and Lithuania have the “most preserved” family regulations per category of member states. The first three topics of family regulations are: child, family, and allowance / benefit. The most frequently provided family benefits are: birth and adoption grants, and special allowance for children with disabilities. All eight family benefits are provided in France, Finland, Hungary, and Slovenia. Only two types of family benefits are available in Ireland, Spain, and Cyprus...|$|R
