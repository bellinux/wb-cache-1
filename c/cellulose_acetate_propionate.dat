50|$|A {{film base}} is a {{transparent}} substrate which {{acts as a}} support medium for the photosensitive emulsion that lies atop it. Despite the numerous layers and coatings associated with the emulsion layer, the base generally accounts {{for the vast majority}} of the thickness of any given film stock. Historically there have been three major types of film base in use: nitrocellulose (cellulose nitrate), cellulose acetate (cellulose triacetate, cellulose diacetate, <b>cellulose</b> <b>acetate</b> <b>propionate,</b> and cellulose acetate butyrate), and polyester (polyethylene terephthalate (PET) (Kodak trade-name: ESTAR)).|$|E
40|$|Cellulosic {{derivatives}} (<b>cellulose</b> <b>acetate,</b> <b>cellulose</b> <b>propionate</b> and cellulose acetate-butyrate) as membranes, {{were prepared}} in different ways. These were then characterised by {{differential scanning calorimetry}} (DSC), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and contact angle evaluation. Subsequently, catalase (H 2 O 2 : H 2 O 2 oxireductase; EC 1. 11. 1. 6), alcohol oxidase (Alcohol: oxygen oxireductase; EC 1. 1. 3. 13) and glucose oxidase (â-D-Glucose: oxygen 1 -oxireductase; EC 1. 1. 3. 4) were covalently linked to these membranes. The catalytic activity and stability of these enzymes, when immobilised, were examined. The results obtained showed that the immobilisation ef®ciency and {{the stability of the}} coupled enzymes could be correlated with the studied properties of the supports. The <b>cellulose</b> <b>acetate</b> membrane which was prepared by evaporation gave the more active conjugate support-enzyme. Membranes prepared by the immersion technique were more crystalline and therefore less suitable for enzyme immobilisation. The highly hydrophobic membranes, obtained from the propionate and the butyrate esters of cellulose reduced the activities but gave better storage stability...|$|R
5000|$|<b>Cellulose</b> <b>acetate</b> is {{also known}} as [...] "safety" [...] film and started to replace nitrate film in the 1920s.

The earliest, diacetate, was found to be inferior to nitrate because it had high shrinkage rates. Eastman Kodak then worked with mixed esters of <b>cellulose</b> to create <b>acetate</b> butyrate and <b>acetate</b> <b>propionate,</b> which were used for sheet film, X-rays, amateur roll film, and aerial maps, but they were still found to be inferior to nitrate by the motion picture industry.

50|$|Cellulose diacetate {{film was}} first {{created by the}} German chemists Arthur Eichengrün and Theodore Becker, who {{patented}} it under the name Cellit, from a process they devised in 1901 for the direct acetylation of cellulose at a low temperature to prevent its degradation, which permitted the degree of acetylation to be controlled, thereby avoiding total conversion to its triacetate. Cellit was a stable, non-brittle cellulose acetate polymer that could be dissolved in acetone for further processing. A cellulose diacetate film more readily dissolved in acetone {{was developed by the}} American chemist George Miles in 1904. Mile's process (partially hydrolysing the polymer) was employed commercially for photographic film in 1909 by Eastman Kodak and the Pathé Fréres. Starting with cellulose diacetate, this innovation continued with <b>cellulose</b> <b>acetate</b> <b>propionate</b> and cellulose acetate butyrate in the 1930s, and finally in the late 1940s, cellulose triacetate was introduced, alongside polyester bases. These less flammable substitutes for nitrate film were called safety film.|$|E
5000|$|Nitrate {{dominated}} {{the market for}} professional-use 35 mm motion picture film from the industry's origins to the early 1950s. While cellulose acetate-based so-called [...] "safety film", notably cellulose diacetate and <b>cellulose</b> <b>acetate</b> <b>propionate,</b> was produced in the gauge for small-scale use in niche applications (e.g., printing advertisements and other short films {{to enable them to}} be sent through the mails without the need for fire safety precautions), the early generations of safety film base had two major disadvantages relative to nitrate: it was much more expensive to manufacture, and considerably less durable in repeated projection. The cost of the safety precautions {{associated with the use of}} nitrate was significantly lower than the cost of using any of the safety bases available before 1948. These drawbacks were eventually overcome with the launch of cellulose triacetate base film by Eastman Kodak in 1948. [...] Cellulose triacetate superseded nitrate as the film industry's mainstay base very quickly. While Kodak had discontinued some nitrate film stocks earlier, they stopped producing various nitrate roll films in 1950 and ceased production of nitrate 35mm motion picture film in 1951.|$|E

Cellulose esters such as <b>cellulose</b> <b>acetate</b> <b>propionate</b> (CAP) and cellulose acetate butyrate (CAB) show positive orientation birefringence with extraordinary wavelength dispersion, which is determined mainly by the ester groups rather than the main chains. The acetyl group provides negative orientation birefringence with strong ordinary wavelength dispersion, whereas the propionyl and butyryl groups give positive orientation birefringence with weak wavelength dispersion. Although all groups show ordinary wavelength dispersion, the summation of their orientation birefringences gives extraordinary dispersion. Moreover, the wavelength dispersion {{is dependent on the}} stretching ratio due to the difference in the orientation relaxation of each group. On the contrary, cellulose triacetate (CTA) shows negative birefringence with ordinary wavelength dispersion because it has no positive contribution. However, doping a plasticizer having positive orientation birefringence changes the orientation birefringence of CTA from negative to positive, and the wavelength dispersion from ordinary to extraordinary.
