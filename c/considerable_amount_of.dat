5|$|The film {{gained a}} <b>considerable</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> {{attention}} before its release, forming large fanbases online and becoming an Internet phenomenon, {{due to the}} film's title, casting, and premise. In response to the Internet fan base, New Line Cinema incorporated feedback from online users into its production, and added five days of reshooting. Before and after the film was released, it was parodied and alluded to on television shows and films, fan-made videos, video games, and various forms of literature.|$|E

5|$|A <b>considerable</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> new {{knowledge}} about plant function comes {{from studies of}} the molecular genetics of model plants such as the Thale cress, Arabidopsis thaliana, a weedy species in the mustard family (Brassicaceae). The genome or hereditary information contained in the genes of this species is encoded by about 135 million base pairs of DNA, forming {{one of the smallest}} genomes among flowering plants. Arabidopsis was the first plant to have its genome sequenced, in 2000. The sequencing of some other relatively small genomes, of rice (Oryza sativa) and Brachypodium distachyon, has made them important model species for understanding the genetics, cellular and molecular biology of cereals, grasses and monocots generally.|$|E
5|$|A <b>considerable</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> {{research}} has been done at Mount Baker over the past decade, and it is now among the most-studied of the Cascade volcanoes.

The Mount Baker Volcano Research Center maintains an online archive of abstracts of this work, and an extensive references list, as well as photos.|$|E
