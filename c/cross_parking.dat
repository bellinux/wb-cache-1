40|$|The study - {{which has}} been {{developed}} through a complex simulation - has allowed to propose - given a surface which is already compromised being occupied by a marshalling yard and is renewable with technical interest - the maximum productivity (i. e. handling operations of ITU's/year) which can be obtained in mentioned area. Effects could also be assessed on the throughput which {{can be obtained from}} a gateway terminal function only, or for the sole road-rail combined transport allocated to the terminal itself. The analysis has allowed to establish, in the specific case, that subject area - which is distinct for application requirements but shows generic features - could host a terminal consisting of three identical crane modules, each of them would include three operational tracks, two load-unload aisles for the road vehicles, two siding areas for the ITU's, a sliding surface, a <b>cross</b> <b>parking</b> for the road vehicles and four holding and shunting track...|$|E

50|$|The park is {{administered}} by the Department of Conservation and Natural Resources(DCNR). Cuts in funding from the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania forced the PHMC to reduce park staffing, which resulted in closing the park to the public in late November, 2009. In 2013, the Pennsylvania state budget and fiscal code mandated that the park transfer from PHMC to DCNR. The switch was finalized in early 2016. The Friends of Washington <b>Crossing</b> <b>Park,</b> a 501(c)(3) private, non-profit corporation, was incorporated in January 2010 to support the PHMC in operating Washington <b>Crossing</b> Historic <b>Park,</b> and the park re-opened to the public in the spring of that same year. The Friends of Washington <b>Crossing</b> <b>Park</b> re-opened the park's gift shop in December 2010. Current full-time, on-site staffing consists of 2 museum professionals and 2 maintenance personnel provided by the PHMC, who work in conjunction with the part-time staff of historical interpreters provided by the Friends of Washington <b>Crossing</b> <b>Park.</b> Washington <b>Crossing</b> Historic <b>Park</b> is open for guided tours Monday through Sundays from 10am - 4pm, April 1 - December 31.
