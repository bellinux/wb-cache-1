The TiO 2 /zeolite composite sheet showed excellent performance for <b>crotamiton</b> adsorption without obvious inhibition by other components in the RO concentrate. With ultraviolet irradiation, <b>crotamiton</b> was simultaneously removed through adsorption and photocatalysis. The photocatalytic decomposition of <b>crotamiton</b> in the RO concentrate was significantly inhibited by the water matrix at high initial <b>crotamiton</b> concentrations, whereas rapid decomposition was achieved at low initial <b>crotamiton</b> concentrations.

40|$|Background:  Scabies is an ectoparasitic infection, {{which occurs}} because of direct skin-to skin contact. The ideal {{treatment}} modality {{is still unclear}} and further research on this topic is warranted. The aim {{of the study was}} to com­pare the efficacy and safety of the topical scabicides: permethrin, <b>crotamiton</b> and sulfur ointment. Methods: Fifty four patients with diagnosed scabies were randomly divided into three treatment groups. The first group received 5 % permethrin cream twice with one week interval, the patients from the second group were given <b>crotamiton</b> lotion for two days twice with one week interval, while the third group received 10 % sulfur ointment for two or three weeks. All patients were followed up at 1, 2 and 4 weeks intervals. Results: At one-week follow up the cure rate was significantly higher at permethrin-treated group when compared to <b>crotamiton</b> group (P< 0. 001) and sulfur group (P< 0. 001). At the end of two-week interval, the cure rate at perme­thrin group was 100 %, while at <b>crotamiton</b> group, 66. 7 % and in sulfur group 38. 9 % (P< 0. 001). At 4 -week follow up the applied treatment was effective in all studied individuals. Conclusion: The topical application of permethrin, <b>crotamiton</b> and sulfur was equally efficacious at 4 -week follow up, however permethrin cream showed faster improvement at first and second follow up. Acquiring permethrin is considered as expensive option and <b>crotamiton</b> lotion seems to be cost-less alternative to this cream. </p...|$|E

40|$|Q: What is {{the most}} {{effective}} treatment for scabies? Evidence-based answer: Topical permethrin {{is the most}} effective treatment for classic scabies (strength of recommendation [SOR]: A, meta-analyses with consistent results). Topical lindane and <b>crotamiton</b> are inferior to permethrin but appear equivalent to each other and benzyl benzoate, sulfur, and natural synergized pyrethrins (SOR: B, limited randomized trials). Although not as effective as topical permethrin, oral ivermectin is an effective treatment compared with placebo (SOR: B,a single small randomized trial). Oral ivermectin may reduce the prevalence of scabies at one year in populations with endemic disease more than topical permethrin (SOR: B, a single randomized trial) ...|$|E

40|$|Background: Hailey-Hailey disease (familial benign chronic pemphigus) of the vulva {{is a rare}} {{autosomal}} dominant dermatosis characterized by malformation of desmosomes and bullae, particularly in intertriginous areas. Cases: We reviewed the cases of 5 women followed at a single academic institution {{over a period of}} 17 years. Of the 5 patients, 4 carried a diagnosis of Hailey-Hailey at the time of presentation to our institution, and one was diagnosed on biopsy. 3 were members of a family group. Initial treatment of choice was a topical steroid (betamethasone in 3, fluocinonide and hydrocortisone in 1 each), vulvar skin guidelines, tepid soaks, a skin protectant (A 2 ̆ 6 D ointment, zinc oxide) and additional treatment (<b>crotamiton</b> in 1, clotrimazole in 2, and Polysporin in 1). Final treatment regimens in 3 patients followed long term were zinc oxide/A 2 ̆ 6 D and betamethasone-clotrimazole ointment in all 3, nystatin-triamcinolone ointment in 2, oral minocycline in 1, oral fluconazole prn in 1, and topical tacrolimus in 1. Treatment courses were complicated by superimposed fungal infections, superimposed bacterial infections, and lichen simplex chronicus flares. These were treated with antifungals, topical clindamycin and metronidazole, and steroid-antifungal bursts, respectively. Three of five patients followed long term achieved successful remission with occasional flares. Discussion: Treatment of Hailey-Hailey disease must be tailored to the individual patient. Adherence to vulvar skin care guidelines is critical for the remission of Hailey-Hailey disease. Treatment is long-term and may be complicated by episodes of fungal and bacterial superinfection and lichen simplex chronicus...|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{compare the}} acaricidal {{activity}} of Melaleuca alternifolia (tea tree) oil (TTO) {{and some of}} its individual active components on the itch mite Sarcoptes scabiei var hominis. Design: In vitro acaricide sensitivity assessment. Setting: The Menzies School of Health Research laboratory, located near the Infectious Diseases Ward of the Royal Darwin Hospital, Australia, where patients are admitted and treated for crusted scabies. Participants: Scabies mites (S scabiei var hominis) were collected from a 20 -year-old Aboriginal woman admitted to the Royal Darwin Hospital with crusted scabies. Interventions: Within 3 hours of collection, scabies mites were placed in continuous direct contact with the TTO products and control acaricides and were observed at regular intervals. Main Outcome Measures: Percentage of mites dead at regular observation intervals between 5 minutes and 24 hours during continuous exposure to the TTO products and acaricides. Results: The 5 % TTO and active component terpinen- 4 -ol were highly effective in reducing mite survival times. Statistically significant differences in mite survival curves were observed for 5 % TTO, 2. 1 % terpinen- 4 -ol, 5 % permethrin, and ivermectin (100 μg/g of Emulsifying Ointment British Pharmacopoeia 88). In vivo effectiveness was also observed. Conclusions: Documentation of resistance against antiectoparasiticcompounds is increasing. Reported S scabiei treatment failures with lindane, <b>crotamiton,</b> and benzyl benzoate, as well as likely emerging resistance to 5 % permethrin and oral ivermectin, are of concern and advocate for the identification and development of novel acaricidal drugs. Tea tree oil is a membrane-active biocide extracted from the tree M alternifolia. It is a principal antimicrobial {{in a wide range of}} pharmaceuticals sold in Australia, with themain active component being oxygenated terpenoids. The results suggest that TTO has a potential role as a new topical acaricide and confirm terpinen- 4 -ol as the primary active component...|$|E
40|$|Background: Demodex mites {{are common}} {{commensal}} organisms of the pilosebaceous unit {{in human beings}} and have been implicated in pityriasis folliculorum, rosacea-like demodicosis, and demodicosis gravis. Objective:We sought to describe the spectrum of clinicopathological findings and therapeutic responses of demodicosis in Taiwanese patients. Methods: We conducted a retrospective study to review clinicopathologic findings and therapeutic responses of 34 cases of diagnosed demodicosis. Results: Fifteen cases with positive results of potassium hydroxide examination, standardized skin surface biopsy specimen, and/or skin biopsy specimen, and resolution of skin lesions after anti-Demodex treatment were included for final analysis. Nineteen cases {{were excluded because of}} insufficient positive data to make a definite diagnosis. There were 4 male and 11 female patients (age 1 - 64 years, mean age 38. 7 years). The disease was recurrent or chronic with a duration ranging from 2 months to 5 years (mean 15. 7 months). The skin lesions were acne rosacea-like (n = 8), perioral dermatitis-like (n = 5), granulomatous rosacea-like (n = 1), and pityriasis folliculorum (n = 1). Skin biopsy was performed in 7 patients. Overall, the histopathology was characterized by: (1) dense perivascular and perifollicular lymphohistiocytic infiltrates, often with abundant neutrophils and occasionally with multinucleated histiocytes; (2) excessive Demodex mites in follicular infundibula; and (3) infundibular pustules containing mites or mites in perifollicular inflammatory infiltrate. The skin lesions resolved after treatment including systemic metronidazole, topical metronidazole, <b>crotamiton,</b> or gamma benzene hexachloride. Limitations: Small sample size and a fraction of patients without long-term follow-up are limitations. Conclusion: Demodicosis should be considered in the differential diagnosis of recurrent or recalcitrant rosacea-like, granulomatous rosacea-like, and perioral dermatitis-like eruptions of the face. Potassium hydroxide examination, standardized skin surface biopsy, skin biopsy, or a combination of these are essential to establish the diagnosis. (J Am Acad Dermatol 2009; 60 : 453 - 62. ...|$|E
