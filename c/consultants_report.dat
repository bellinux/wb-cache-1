For example, one municipality {{did not know how}} to value the <b>consultant’s</b> <b>report</b> in relation to the opinions it was to give on the procurement documents [46]. A civil servant in one municipality stated that neither he nor “his” politicians had received any information about the <b>consultant’s</b> <b>report</b> until it was already complete. He was very surprised to hear about the report, and confused as to why and by whom it was prepared. This civil servant decided to call his colleagues in two other municipalities to discuss the <b>consultant’s</b> <b>report.</b> These three civil servants then turned to the PTA president and said that they needed more time to respond to the procurement document, if they were also to consider the conclusions of the <b>consultant’s</b> <b>report</b> [32].

50|$|In {{the early}} 1990s the ACT Government {{progressively}} withdrew rural leases in the Gungahlin district ahead of construction {{work on the}} suburbs of Ngunnawal, Nicholls and Harcourt Hill. The Gold Creek Homestead business fully expected that land planners would retain a respectable buffer zone between the Homestead Site and surrounding houses to cater for extra noise. By 1994, a long timber paling fence stretched along the northern, eastern and western boundaries of the now 41 hectare Gold Creek Homestead site, while to the south, a two-metre high earth noise barrier was erected alongside Gungahlin Drive. With {{the majority of the}} construction work finished, bookings for the Gold Creek hayshed began to recover by mid 1995. Soon after noise complaints from nearby houses during a night-time function in the entertainment led to a suspension of live music at Gold Creek. The ACT Government commissioned a <b>consultants</b> <b>report</b> which estimated the cost of noise abatement measures at $300,000. The government quickly cooled on the idea.

30|$|What other effects did the <b>consultant’s</b> <b>report</b> have? A {{civil servant}} at the {{regional}} cooperation body argued that the <b>consultant’s</b> <b>report</b> was crucial to {{the outcome of the}} procurement document. He stated that “The PTA bought everything in the report” [47]. In addition, the PTA president thought the <b>consultant’s</b> <b>report</b> was relevant, not in a way that changed the procurement document, but rather as it ensured that the process was on the right track. A local politician thought that the <b>consultant’s</b> <b>report</b> was an addition to the procurement report. He believed that the <b>consultant’s</b> <b>report</b> was more research based, which was also important to consider when conducting a procurement. Regarding the timing of the completion of the <b>consultant’s</b> <b>report,</b> the informant believed it was right: “We had time to reflect on the report when it wasn’t too old – we can’t use old data in these kinds of processes” [42]. One consequence of the <b>consultant’s</b> <b>report,</b> besides allowing the regional cooperation body to influence the procurement process, was that other actors (including the PTA) also used the report as a resource to gather political support for their decisions. Not only did the actor mobilizing power resources in the initial stage benefit from this resource mobilization, but other actors could also use the resources to their own benefit.|$|R

40|$|Aim: To {{examine the}} {{productivity}} (both economic and otherwise) of trainees within a radiology department at our institution. Materials and methods: Productivity {{was measured in}} three ways: (1) independent workload contribution, (2) impact on on-call services, and (3) impact on day-to-day practice as perceived by consultant radiologists. Data were collected using retrospective searches on computerized radiology information system (CRIS), analysis of trainees and consultant rotas, and a questionnaire to consultants and trainees. Where possible, productivity was quantified in terms of number of programmed activities (PAs). Results: The contribution of independent work by trainees in a single week was 52. 75 PAs (or 1. 45 PAs per trainee per week). In addition, the on-call contribution was 23. 1 PAs per week (or 0. 93 PAs per trainee per week). When both trainees and <b>consultants</b> <b>report</b> independently, productivity in a single list in most cases increased and can {{be as much as}} 197 %. On calculating the economic impact, this amounts to significant savings of around £ 1. 2 million per year at our institution. Conclusion: Based upon objectively measurable areas of service provision, the employment of trainees yields considerable economic benefit. Furthermore, based upon qualitative methods we have shown that trainees contribute positively in those areas, which are much harder to quantifiably evaluate. These are benefits in addition to fundamental requirement to train future competent radiologists. © 2011 The Royal College of Radiologists. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|Background : Effective {{communication}} {{is considered to}} be essential for the delivery of high-quality care. Communication in palliative care may be particularly difficult, and there is still no accepted set of communication skills for GPs in providing palliative care. Aim : To obtain detailed information on facilitators and barriers for GP-patient communication in palliative care, with the aim to develop training programmes that enable GPs to improve their palliative care communication skills. Design of study : Qualitative study with focus groups, interviews, and questionnaires. Setting : GPs with patients receiving palliative care at home, and end-of-life consultants in the Netherlands. Method : GP (n = 20) focus groups discussing facilitators and barriers, palliative care patient (n = 6) interviews regarding facilitators, and end-of-life consultant (n = 22) questionnaires concerning barriers. Results : Facilitators reported by both GPs and patients were accessibility, taking time, commitment, and listening carefully. GPs emphasise respect, while patients want GPs to behave in a friendly way, and to take the initiative to discuss end-of-life issues. Barriers reported by both GPs and end-of-life consultants were: difficulty in dealing with former doctors' delay and strong demands from patients' relatives. GPs report difficulty in dealing with strong emotions and troublesome doctor-patient relationships, while <b>consultants</b> <b>report</b> insufficient clarification of patients' problems, promises that could not be kept, helplessness, too close involvement, and insufficient anticipation of various scenarios.

On the evidence, says the Commission, the strong growth in executive pay has {{had much to do}} with the growth and global reach of Australian companies themselves.

The other area of interest for this study was to determine if there are relationships between these identified antecedents and estate planning, as well as between death taxes and estate planning in South Africa. The literature review clarifies the concepts of estate planning and death taxes, provides information on the tools available for appropriate estate planning and lists the antecedents that influence estate planning globally. This conceptual framework was used to guide the primary research process in which hypotheses were formulated to provide insight for the research study goals. Non-experimental, quantitative and inferential methods were employed for this study. Primary data was collected via a web-based questionnaire. The questionnaire tested perceptions of estate planning and the antecedents influencing estate planning in South Africa. Owing to the scientific nature of this study, the simple random sampling technique was employed. The SAS package (version 9. 2) was used to analyse the data collected. The results of this study are discussed in detail, confirming the relationship between the antecedents and estate planning as well as the relationship between death taxes and estate planning in South Africa. The results of this study further reveal the positive and negative antecedents influencing estate planning in South Africa.

40|$|Friends of Fresno State. An {{open letter}} to the {{university}} and San Joaquin Valley communities, November 3, 2008. To Dr. John Welty, President, all members of California State University, Fresno and the communities of the San Joaquin Valley. A small group of individuals ("Friends of Fresno State") has been and {{are involved in a}} variety of activities and programs associated with the University. Each of us wants the highest possible level of success for the University, generally, and in its relationship with Fresno and surrounding communities and the greater San Joaquin Valley. Included in this letter are brief biographical summaries of the individuals in our group. Friends of Fresno State began meeting late in 2007. We came together with a shared belief that some of the serious and reasonably well-known issues involving the University and its broad communities of interest both within and outside of the University had reached a level that was becoming harmful. It was our view that it would be worthwhile to find a set of university ???best practices??? that, if implemented, would make significant progress in resolving some of the concerns that have been raised with respect to the university. Through the Fresno Regional Foundation, we contracted with Noll & Associates to conduct a research study on how successful Universities, with Division 1 A Athletic Programs, balance academics, community engagement, and athletics. Our project was welcomed by Dr. Welty and partly supported by the University and administered through the Fresno Regional Foundation. No findings or conclusions or recommendations were discussed outside of Friends of Fresno State and its consultants prior to the issuance of this report. Information is included regarding the process that was followed. Many people were interviewed and their views sought. Leaders of academic institutions, some of which are viewed as similar to Fresno State in 1 nany important respects, were interviewed to enable us {{to get a sense of}} best practices utilized elsewhere. The Friends of Fresno State are pleased to state that we recognize that some of the best practices that are identified in this report are already being utilized at Fresno State. There was no attempt in this research and report to directly analyze any practices, departments or personnel at Fresno State. The inclusion of any specific best practice is, in no way, intended to refer or relate to any deficiency at the University. We believe that the implementation of "best practices" can significantly enhance our University and the University's relationships with the communities it serves as we approach the proud time of Fresno State's lOOth anniversary. Finally, we support the "best practices" included in this report and take full responsibility for commissioning this research. We believe that this research can be significantly helpful to any University with a Division lA athletic program that seeks to balance and make visible its fundamental academic mission with the reality of having a big time athletic program. Friends of Fresno State is extremely appreciative of the excellent work performed by Noll & Associates in the performance of their research contract. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY Over the past fifteen years, Fresno State athletics has emerged as one of the most highly visible facets of the University???s regional and national image. Recent events, including the 2007 - 2008 verdicts and settlements of employment claims and the national championship won by the men???s baseball team, have highlighted the division between those who see the University as moving in a direction they cannot support and those who continue to back the University. Dr. Bud Richter called together a small group of volunteers to discuss how the University might make its major achievements ??? academic, athletic, and community engagement ??? more highly visible, balanced, and understandable to the greater community. How might the University balance the reality of big time athletics with its fundamental academic mission: to create and disseminate knowledge? Three models of college athletics have emerged in the last hundred years: an academic model, with athletics being a completely secondary element in the university???s offering and image (e. g. Dartmouth, U. C. Davis, and University of the Pacific), a commercial model which features an independent athletic program that makes little or no demands on the university budget or personnel (e. g. University of Oregon, Michigan, and University of Southern California), and finally a hybrid model which utilizes significant resources from both the community and the university (e. g. Oregon State, Boise State, Kansas State University). Historically, universities like Fresno State have moved from its early history as an academic model to a hybrid model featuring a fully developed Division 1 A athletic program. While each model has its strengths and weaknesses, the hybrid model requires a very specific focus to ensure a balanced model, specifically one that does not find the athletic elements of the university masking its achievements in academic performance and community engagement. The hybrid model evolves slowly from the academic model and is highly influenced by the fans??? and supporters??? expectations of a commercial model. This evolutionary nature may render it difficult to see as having unique demands. The hybrid model is also challenging to operate for long periods of time in this ???middle ground??? without seeing it as a temporary transition between the academic and commercial models. Even if a university makes this transition it is always a slow and complex evolution with very predictable challenges. Clearly, this is no easy task for any growing university with high expectations. Noll Associates was selected by the Friends of Fresno State, employed through the Fresno Regional Foundation, with some support from the University to seek out the best practices for balancing all elements of the University???s offerings and provide a solid base for its Division 1 A athletics, academics, and community engagement. These best practices for any hybrid model university were derived from broad resources and are offered in the hopes that the University will carefully consider utilizing the ones that fit well with the continuing growth and development of its mission. It is clear, from a careful look at the history of the development of athletics within universities, that creating this balance has been a demanding issue for many universities for more than a hundred years. It is also clear that a careful focus on the best practices offered in this report can enable a university to manage a hybrid model that will positively integrate academics, community engagement, and Division 1 A athletics for the unified strength of all and the detriment of none. Introduction: A. History of the Project In its early years, Fresno State was seen as a regional state college serving the educational needs of the predominantly agricultural San Joaquin Valley. As time has passed, Fresno State athletics has come to dominate the image of the university. Over the past fifteen years, Fresno State athletics has emerged as one of the most visible aspects of the university???s regional and national image. The current public impression of the university has become polarized. Some factions of the community have voiced strong opinions supporting the university, its administration, faculty, and students while others are highly critical. Recent events, including the verdicts and settlements of employment claims by female coaches, have highlighted deeper divisions between those that continue to support the university and those who see the university as moving in a direction they cannot support. Unfortunately, these few but highly publicized events have masked the university???s regional and national influence. Further, these events have some people questioning the fundamental roles of the university. Others are concerned that these events may have a negative effect on the comprehensive capital campaign as it moves to a more public phase. Finally, adverse publicity is distracting those in the academic, administrative, and development centers of the university. A number of people felt that it was time to take a careful look at how to balance the university focus on academic performance and athletics. How might the university make its major achievements ??? athletic, scholastic, community engagement, and academic ??? more highly visible and understandable so that mistakes, when they happen, will be viewed in broader, more balanced context? How might the university balance the reality of big-time athletics with its fundamental academic mission: to create and disseminate knowledge? B. Objective The objective of this project is to discover and develop the best practices to balance academic performance, community engagement, and athletics at Fresno State. The recommendation is that university leadership utilize these best practices so that academic performance will become the primary driver for every decision within the university environment. C.
