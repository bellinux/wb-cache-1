The objectives {{of the study were}} to study the factors affecting the mobile use by farmers, farmers ’ willingness to receive agricultural information through mobile communication technology, and awareness on mobile based agriculture information systems. Primary data were collected at two stages using two structured interview schedules (N= 390, n= 65).

40|$|Power {{dissipation}} in {{switching devices}} {{is believed to}} be the single most important roadblock to the continued downscaling of charge based electronic circuits. At this time there is a lot of interest in analyzing alternative technologies which could enable further downscaling of electronic circuits. It has also been suggested that magnets as collective entities could require significantly low switching energies. In this thesis we analyze the intrinsic switching energy that is dissipated in the switching process of single-domain magnets. One central result is that the intrinsic switching energy of a magnet (which could be composed of millions of spins) is on the order of its energy barrier height Eb. This is different from conventional transistors in that the switching energy is on the order of NE b, N being the number of electronic charges participating in a switching process (usually on the order of thousands). Furthermore a spintronic device is proposed that uses spin at every stage of its operation: information manipulation, transport, storage, input and output are all accomplished with magnets and spin-coherent channels. Contrary to the typical spin/magnet based logic schemes, the all-spin scheme neither relies on ordinary magnetic fields (generated by current carrying wires) nor does it rely on electrical read-out of magnetic states. Binary data are represented by the bi-stable states of nanomagnets (i. e. magnetic polarization) which can be non-volatile. Application of a voltage signal to a magnetic <b>contact</b> (<b>input</b> data bit) creates a spin-current in a channel which can be conveniently guided and routed to another magnetic contact (output data bit) where it determines its final state based on spin-torque phenomenon. The all-spin device could potentially find use for low-power digital logic since it should satisfy the five essential characteristics for logic applications namely nonlinearity, gain, concatenability, feedback prevention and a complete set of Boolean operations. Moreover it could provide a basis for unconventional approaches. For example the spin accumulation in a channel underneath a magnetic contact could provide a weighted average of different inputs that makes it switch (2 ̆ 7 fire 2 ̆ 7) when it exceeds a threshold like neural networks. Alternatively the magnetic contacts on top of the channel could possibly serve as input-output interface for spin-based quantum computing. ...|$|E
25|$|A {{microprocessor-based}} digital {{protection relay}} can replace {{the functions of}} many discrete electromechanical instruments. These relays convert voltage and currents to digital form and process the resulting measurements using a microprocessor. The digital relay can emulate functions of many discrete electromechanical relays in one device, simplifying protection design and maintenance. Each digital relay can run self-test routines to confirm its readiness and alarm if a fault is detected. Digital relays can also provide functions such as communications (SCADA) interface, monitoring of <b>contact</b> <b>inputs,</b> metering, waveform analysis, and other useful features. Digital relays can, for example, store multiple sets of protection parameters, which allows {{the behavior of the}} relay to be changed during maintenance of attached equipment. Digital relays also can provide protection strategies impossible to implement with electromechanical relays. This is particularly so in long distance high voltage or multi-terminal circuits or in lines that are series or shunt compensated They also offer benefits in self-testing and communication to supervisory control systems.|$|R

This system greatly simplifies {{installation and maintenance}} over that required with conventional switching systems. The system is based on microprocessor technology and digital frequency synthesis. Frequency division multiplexing is used over a bandwidth of approximately 300 kHz, and a baseband voice channel (compatible with conventional pager phones) is provided as a backup to assure communication if the multiplex features fail. Multiplex operations are controlled over a 30 -kHz digital channel. The system is designed to operate with up to 16 km (10 miles) of cable plant and a maximum phone separation of 8 km (5 miles).

In this framework, the location of a target is not explicitly estimated. Instead, the location estimation, data association, and tracking are simultaneously solved by combining an observation model with a motion model. Moreover, in this framework, a Kalman or extended Kalman filter is not used because the tracking process treats raw input signals from array sensors directly, instead of using the estimated <b>contacts</b> as <b>inputs.</b>|$|R

50|$|Digital {{protective}} relays {{were in their}} infancy during the late 1960s. An experimental digital protection system was tested in the lab and {{in the field in}} the early 1970s. Unlike the relays mentioned above, digital {{protective relays}} have two main parts: hardware and software. The world's first commercially available digital protective relay was introduced to the power industry in 1984. In spite of the developments of complex algorithms for implementing protection functions the microprocessor based-relays marketed in the 1980s did not incorporate them.A microprocessor-based digital protection relay can replace the functions of many discrete electromechanical instruments. These relays convert voltage and currents to digital form and process the resulting measurements using a microprocessor. The digital relay can emulate functions of many discrete electromechanical relays in one device, simplifying protection design and maintenance.

40|$|Specific binding between {{proteins}} plays {{a crucial}} role in molecular functions and biological processes. Protein binding interfaces and their atomic contacts are typically defined by simple criteria, such as distance-based definitions that only use some threshold of spatial distance in previous studies. These definitions neglect the nearby atomic organization of contact atoms, and thus detect predominant contacts which are interrupted by other atoms. It is questionable whether such kinds of interrupted contacts are as important as other contacts in protein binding. To tackle this challenge, we propose a new definition called beta (b) atomic contacts. Our definition, founded on the b-skeletons in computational geometry, requires that there is no other atom in the contact spheres defined by two contact atoms; this sphere is similar to the van der Waals spheres of atoms. The statistical analysis on a large dataset shows that b contacts are {{only a small fraction of}} conventional distance-based contacts. To empirically quantify the importance of b contacts, we design bACV, an SVM classifier with b <b>contacts</b> as <b>input,</b> to classify homodimers from crystal packing. We found that our bACV is able to achieve the state-of-the-art classification performance superior to SVM classifiers with distance-based <b>contacts</b> as <b>input.</b> Our bACV also outperforms several existing methods when being evaluated on several datasets in previous works. The promising empirical performance suggests that b contacts can truly identify critical specific contacts in protein binding interfaces. b contacts thus provide a new model for more precise description of atomic organization in protein quaternary structures than distance-based contacts...|$|R

The integral equations can be solved numerically by considering the nature of the singularities at the crack tips. The numerical results of the energy release rate showing the effects of the mutual interference of a pair of interface cracks are given for some tribological material coatings on a steel substrate.
