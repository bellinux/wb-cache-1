5|$|Consequently, under Seydlitz's direction, by {{the start}} of the Seven Years' War, the cavalry had become Frederick's pride and joy: it had unrivaled {{training}} and an esprit de corps bolstered by Frederick's <b>confidence</b> <b>in</b> its members, and by their <b>confidence</b> <b>in</b> Seydlitz. The King had issued orders that no Prussian cavalryman would allow himself to be attacked without a commensurate response, under penalty of being cashiered; consequently, Prussian cavalrymen were active, impetuous and aggressive. For the King, Seydlitz's cavalry became the dynamic factor in the army of the state, and would be the tool by which Frederick could challenge empires. In 1756, Seydlitz's cavalry became Frederick's weapon of choice.|$|E
5|$|During trials, {{the player}} cross-examines witnesses. They can move {{backwards}} and forwards through {{statements in the}} testimony, and can choose to press the witness {{for more information on}} a particular statement; sometimes, the witness will revise their testimony based on this. If the player spots a lie or a contradiction in the testimony, they can present evidence to demonstrate the contradiction. If the player presents incorrect evidence, the judge's <b>confidence</b> <b>in</b> the player will be lowered; if the judge's <b>confidence</b> <b>in</b> the player is depleted, the game ends.|$|E

5|$|In retrospect, however, critics often cite Atari's Pac-Man as a {{major factor}} in the drop of {{consumer}} <b>confidence</b> <b>in</b> the company, which contributed to the North American video game crash of 1983. Bill Loguidice and Matt Barton of Gamasutra stated that the game's poor quality damaged the company's reputation. Buchanan commented that it disappointed millions of fans and diminished <b>confidence</b> <b>in</b> Atari's games. Former Next Generation editor-in-chief Neil West attributes his longtime skepticism of Atari's quality to the disappointment he had from buying the game as a child. Calling the game the top video game disaster, Buchanan credits Pac-Man as a factor to the downfall of Atari and the industry in the 1980s. Author Steven Kent also blames the game, along with Atari's E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial, for severely damaging the company's reputation and profitability. Montfort and Bogost stated that the game's negative reception seeded mistrust in retailers, which was reinforced by later factors that culminated in the crash.|$|E
