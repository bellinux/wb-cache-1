500|$|In {{reaction}} to this, former Stanley internee Diana Elias launched a civil action {{case against the}} British government, alleging the distinction of [...] "bloodlink" [...] made by the <b>compensation</b> <b>scheme</b> was discriminatory, and that the Japanese authorities had made no such distinction in their treatment of the internees. [...] Elias' family, including her parents and her grandparents, were all holders of British passports. [...] The [...] "bloodlink" [...] distinction, however, made her ineligible for compensation because she is of Iraqi Jewish ancestry. [...] In July 2005, the High Court in London ruled in her favour, and was subsequently backed by the Court of Appeals when the Ministry of Defence appealed the High Court's decision.

500|$|The {{ability to}} insure ships, cargo, and crew has a {{significant}} impact on the profitability of shipping. Insurance of Irish ships in the 'Long Watch' was problematic. One important aspect of this was that Irish ships usually didn't travel in convoy and insurers such as Lloyd's of London charged a higher premium to insure ships not in convoy. An example of the insurance problems faced, concerns the crew of City of Waterford. When this ship joined Convoy OG 74, the lives of the crew were insured. The ship suffered a collision with the Dutch tugboat Thames, and sank. Waterfords crew was rescued by [...] and then transferred to the rescue ship [...] Walmer Castle was bombed two days later and five of City of Waterfords survivors died. When their families made life insurance claims, they were refused, because at their time of death they were not crew of City of Waterford, but passengers of Walmer Castle.

Thus, we argue for a limited gap reduction between advantageous and disadvantageous regions and show that neither laissez faire nor Rawlsian allocation is secession-proof. ...|$|R
