5|$|By contrast, ovarian cancer, {{the leading}} cause of {{reproductive}} organ <b>cancer</b> <b>deaths,</b> and the fifth commonest cause of <b>cancer</b> <b>deaths</b> in women in the United States, lacks an effective screening programme, and is predominantly a disease of women in industrialised countries. Because it is largely asymptomatic in its earliest stages, more than 50% of women have stage III or higher cancer (spread beyond the ovaries) by the time they are diagnosed, with a consequent poor prognosis.|$|E

5|$|The abundances of {{the noble}} {{gases in the}} {{universe}} decrease as their atomic numbers increase. Helium {{is the most common}} element in the universe after hydrogen, with a mass fraction of about 24%. Most of the helium in the universe was formed during Big Bang nucleosynthesis, but the amount of helium is steadily increasing due to the fusion of hydrogen in stellar nucleosynthesis (and, to a very slight degree, the alpha decay of heavy elements). Abundances on Earth follow different trends; for example, helium is only the third most abundant noble gas in the atmosphere. The reason {{is that there is no}} primordial helium in the atmosphere; due to the small mass of the atom, helium cannot be retained by the Earth's gravitational field. Helium on Earth comes from the alpha decay of heavy elements such as uranium and thorium found in the Earth's crust, and tends to accumulate in natural gas deposits. The abundance of argon, on the other hand, is increased as a result of the beta decay of potassium-40, also found in the Earth's crust, to form argon-40, which is the most abundant isotope of argon on Earth despite being relatively rare in the Solar System. This process is the basis for the potassium-argon dating method.Ar/39Ar dating and errors|accessdate=2008-06-26|publisher=Technische Universität Bergakademie Freiberg|date=2007-01-16|last=Scherer|first=Alexandra |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071014042248/http://geoberg.de/text/geology/07011601.php |archivedate=2007-10-14}} Xenon has an unexpectedly low abundance in the atmosphere, in what has been called the missing xenon problem; one theory is that the missing xenon may be trapped in minerals inside the Earth's crust. After the discovery of xenon dioxide, research showed that Xe can substitute for Si in quartz. Radon is formed in the lithosphere by the alpha decay of radium. It can seep into buildings through cracks in their foundation and accumulate in areas that are not well ventilated. Due to its high radioactivity, radon presents a significant health hazard; it is implicated in an estimated 21,000 lung <b>cancer</b> <b>deaths</b> per year in the United States alone.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Vermont’s breast <b>cancer</b> <b>death</b> rate {{is among}} the highest in the U. S. This study {{analyzed}} the association between breast cancer mortality and occupation in Vermont women. Given that Vermont is a rural state, one initial hypothesis was that occupational exposure to pesticides might partly explain the high death rate. Death certificate data from 1989 - 1993 were analyzed to determine relative risk of breast <b>cancer</b> <b>death</b> according to occupation. Case-control analysis demonstrated increased relative risk of breast <b>cancer</b> <b>death</b> for women in two broad occupational groups: 1) Executive, Administrator and Managers and 2) Professionals. Decreased relative risk of breast <b>cancer</b> <b>death</b> was seen for the occupational group of Homemaker. Data indicated that women in the occupational group of Farming, Forestry, and Fishing were not at increased risk of dying from breast cancer. The associations of occupation and breast cancer mortality in Vermont women do not differ significantly from those seen in larger U. S. studies...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the optimal treatment for a patient with newly diagnosed prostate cancer weighing the individual's risk of disease progression against his risk of non-cancer death. METHODS: We developed a predictive model incorporating clinicopathological tumor variables, patient age, comorbidity status, and primary treatment modality. We identified 6091 patients with clinically-localized prostate cancer managed with radical prostatectomy (n 4117) or radiation therapy (n 1974) from the Cancer of the Prostate Strategic Urologic Research Endeavor database. Fine and Gray competing-risks proportional hazards regression models were used to calculate the risks of prostate cancer-specific mortality (PCSM) and non-prostate <b>cancer</b> <b>death</b> and to generate a nomogram. RESULTS: The median follow-up after treatment was 53 months (interquartile range 30, 80 months). In total, 983 men died during follow-up, including 167 who died of prostate cancer and 816 who died of non-prostate cancer causes. On multivariate analysis, higher Cancer of the Prostate Risk Assessment score and primary treatment with radiation were associated with an increased risk of PCSM, whereas older age, African-American race, and treatment with radiation predicted non-prostate <b>cancer</b> <b>death.</b> The number of comorbidities and receipt of androgen deprivation therapy correlated with an increased risk of non-prostate <b>cancer</b> <b>death,</b> but not PCSM. The resulting nomogram allows quantification and comparison of the 10 -year risk of PCSM and non-prostate <b>cancer</b> <b>death.</b> CONCLUSIONS: Integrating clinicopathological variables with comorbid conditions in a competing-risks model affords quantification and comparison of relative probabilities of PCSM and non-prostate <b>cancer</b> <b>death</b> following treatment. Our model thereby facilitates an individualized approach for counseling patients regarding prostate cancer management. © 2012 Macmillan Publishers Limited All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|In {{studies of}} {{the health effects of}} asbestos, lung <b>cancer</b> <b>death</b> is subject to misclassification.

The standard covariate-adjusted estimate of the rate ratio was 1. 94 (95 % confidence interval: 1. 55, 2. 44), and modified maximum likelihood produced similar results when we assumed that the specificity of outcome classification was 0. 98. With sensitivity assumed to be 0. 80 and specificity assumed to be 0. 95, estimated rate ratios were further from the null and less precise (rate ratio = 2. 17; 95 % confidence inter-val: 1. 59, 2. 98). In the present context, standard estimates for the effect of asbestos on lung <b>cancer</b> <b>death</b> were similar to estimates accounting for the limited misclassification.

40|$|BACKGROUND: In the United States, a black-to-white {{disparity}} in age-standardized breast cancer mortality rates {{emerged in the}} 1980 s and has widened since then. METHODS: To further explore this racial disparity, black-to-white rate ratios (RRs(BW)) for mortality, incidence, hazard of breast <b>cancer</b> <b>death,</b> and incidence-based mortality (IBM) were investigated {{using data from the}} National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program on 244 786 women who were diagnosed with breast cancer from January 1990 through December 2003 and followed through December 2004. A counterfactual approach was used to examine the expected IBM RRs(BW), assuming equal distributions for estrogen receptor (ER) expression, and/or equal hazard rates of breast <b>cancer</b> <b>death,</b> among black and white women. RESULTS: From 1990 through 2004, mortality RR(BW) was greater than 1. 0 and widened over time (age-standardized breast cancer mortality rates fell from 36 to 29 per 100 000 for blacks and from 30 to 22 per 100 000 for whites). In contrast, incidence RR(BW) was generally less than 1. 0. Absolute hazard rates of breast <b>cancer</b> <b>death</b> declined substantially for ER-positive tumors and modestly for ER-negative tumors but were persistently higher for blacks than whites. Equalizing the distributions of ER expression in blacks and whites decreased the IBM RR(BW) slightly. Interestingly, the black-to-white {{disparity in}} IBM RR(BW) was essentially eliminated when hazard rates of breast <b>cancer</b> <b>death</b> were matched within each ER category. CONCLUSIONS: The black-to-white disparity in age-standardized breast cancer mortality was largely driven by the higher hazard rates of breast <b>cancer</b> <b>death</b> among black women, diagnosed with the disease, irrespective of ER expression, and especially in the first few years following diagnosis. Greater emphasis should be placed on identifying the etiology of these excess hazards and developing therapeutic strategies to address them...|$|R
