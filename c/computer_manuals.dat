5000|$|In {{order to}} create better {{computational}} models of language, an understanding of language’s structure is crucial. To this end, the English language has been meticulously studied using computational approaches to better understand how the language works on a structural level. One {{of the most important}} pieces of being able to study linguistic structure is the availability of large linguistic corpora, or samples. This grants computational linguists the raw data necessary to run their models and {{gain a better understanding of}} the underlying structures present in the vast amount of data which is contained in any single language. One of the most cited English linguistic corpora is the Penn Treebank. [...] Derived from widely-different sources, such as IBM <b>computer</b> <b>manuals</b> and transcribed telephone conversations, this corpus contains over 4.5 million words of American English. This corpus has been primarily annotated using part-of-speech tagging and syntactic bracketing and has yielded substantial empirical observations related to language structure.|$|E
5000|$|The Hamnet Players {{were founded}} in 1993 by Stuart Harris, an Englishman living in San Diego, California, a former actor, {{computer}} professional {{and author of}} <b>computer</b> <b>manuals.</b> In December 1993 they debuted the concept of internet theatre with their debut production of [...] "Hamnet", a parody of William Shakespeare's play [...] "Hamlet", followed later in April 1994 with their second production of [...] "PCbeth: an IBM clone of Macbeth,", another parody of a Shakespeare play, this time using [...] "Macbeth". In February 1995 they moved away from Shakespeare and used {{the plot of the}} Tennessee Williams's play [...] "A Streetcar Named Desire", to create their third original piece [...] "An IRC Channel Named #desire". The Hamnet Players performances are a form of vitual theatre, first of all, because they are focused gatherings, just like face-to-face encounters. [...] Although participants could not see one another and their bodies were not co-present to one another, they cooperated to sustain a single focus of attention, taking turns at talking.|$|E
50|$|TIS-100 {{was based}} on an idea that Zach Barth, the founder and lead game {{designer}} of Zachtronics, had years prior. The concept was named The Second Golden Age, which was set in the Middle East sometime in the near future, in which the player would program nanobots to be injected into the player-character's blood as to be able to solve various types puzzles akin to Myst. One aspect would be the player-character coming across a used electronics store and finding an old computer with corrupted areas, which as they worked to clear up, would discover these corrupted areas contained the core of an artificial intelligence. While developing Infinifactory, Barth wanted to try to start work on The Second Golden Age but found the effort, concurrent with Infinifactory, was far too difficult. However, he had completed the assembly-language puzzle aspect, and decided to go ahead and refine only that portion as a full game. To finish off the game, he worked with Keith Holman to write the language's manual inspired by similar <b>computer</b> <b>manuals</b> of the time, and with Matthew Burns to craft a simple story around the game. They used concepts from a Mondo 2000 infographic based on cybertech fashions to write the tongue-in-cheek narrative for the game and manual.|$|E

50|$|Clarence Ellis {{was born}} on May 11, 1943 in Chicago, Illinois. In 1958, at age 15, Ellis applied for {{a job as a}} {{graveyard}} shift computer operator at the manufacturing firm Dover to earn money to help his family. He was offered the job because he was the only applicant. Although his job title was computer operator, his main duties were to walk around all night and be visible to prevent break-ins, and to watch over, but not touch, the company's new computer. At the time, Dover's computer was based on vacuum tube technology (2,400 vacuum tubes), used punch cards as input and output, and filled an extremely large room.In Ellis' free time on the job, he read and re-read the dozens of <b>computer</b> <b>manuals</b> that came with the machine. He taught himself as much as possible about the machine without touching it. Two months after he started the job, Ellis helped the company through an emergency. They had run out of unused punch cards, and needed to use the computer to process payroll by morning. During the emergency, Ellis {{was the only one who}} knew how to recycle the used punch cards. He lifted the hood of the computer and disabled the parity check circuitry. The used punch cards were recycled and the company was able to process the payroll. After this experience, the company began to seek him out whenever they had computer problems, and even asked him to operate and program the computer for them. Ellis states that this experience helped ignite his passion for computing.|$|E
