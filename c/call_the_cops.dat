2500|$|The {{abbreviated}} season {{opened with}} five games in January {{and four of}} them on home ice. The Flames struggled during the month, posting only one victory against three losses in regulation and a shootout defeat that left the team in last place in the Western Conference entering February. The homestand ended with further frustration for the Flames as they lost to the Chicago Blackhawks, 3–2 in a shootout, despite outshooting their opponent 47–19. Chicago goaltender Ray Emery's performance was described as [...] "criminal" [...] by his coach Joel Quenneville: [...] "They've got to <b>call</b> <b>the</b> <b>cops</b> after that performance. (Emery) stole two points. He was spectacular." [...] The Flames defeated the Detroit Red Wings on February 5 for their second win, but the victory came at a cost as starting goaltender Miikka Kiprusoff suffered an injury to his Medial collateral ligament. Injuries continued to impact the Flames' roster, as centre Mikael Backlund suffered a sprained knee in the following game, a 4–3 victory over the Columbus Blue Jackets, and was expected to miss at least four weeks.
