40|$|Annex II of Decision 8 /CP. 4 from COP 4 on "Preparation for {{the first}} session of the Conference <b>of</b> the <b>Parties</b> serving as the Meeting <b>of</b> the <b>Parties</b> to the Kyoto Protocol" {{established}} a joint working group (JWG) on compliance under the SBI and SBSTA. 3 Because {{of the relation between}} the legal and the technical aspects the suggestion is done that this JWG should include both legal and technical experts. 4 Much preliminary and exploratory work remains to be done, including on identifying key issues and options, both in the context of individual Kyoto mechanisms and regarding any broader compliance regime. Issues related to compliance arise under different provisions of the Protocol and it is important to coordinate relevant work under the auspices of different groups so as to develop a coherent compliance system for the Protocol and to avoid unnecessary duplication. 5 Annex II invited Parties also to submit views to the secretariat on matters relating to compliance under the Kyoto Protocol, to be made available by the secretariat in a miscellaneous document. 6 This document contains some main issues in the <b>comments</b> <b>of</b> the <b>Parties</b> and my suggestions about these issues...|$|R
50|$|There {{was much}} {{bitterness}} and {{controversy in the}} aftermath of the Senate preselection result. For example, Humphries refused to attend a dinner that the party executive held for him, because of the way that it had been organised. In May 2014 Humphries was stripped of the Margaret Reid Award for distinguished service, a noteworthy party presentation, by the party's management committee. This was for <b>comments</b> critical <b>of</b> the <b>party</b> and some <b>of</b> its members, such as Opposition Leader Jeremy Hanson, who became Opposition leader after Seselja replaced Humphries as a Senator.One critique in particular, about the Canberra Liberals losing touch with the ACT community, raised the committee's ire, and drew a public rebuke from Hanson.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—This {{paper has}} as its main aim to analyse how {{corporate}} web pages can become an essential tool in order to detect strategic trends by firms or sectors, and even a primary source for benchmarking. This technique {{has made it possible}} to identify the key issues in the strategic management of the most excellent large Spanish firms and also to describe trends in their long-range planning, a way of working that can be generalised to any country or firm group. More precisely, two objectives were sought. The first one consisted in showing the way in which corporate websites make it possible to obtain direct information about the strategic variables which can define firms. This tool is dynamic (since web pages are constantly updated) as well as direct and reliable, since the information comes from the firm itself, not from <b>comments</b> <b>of</b> third <b>parties</b> (such as journalists, academicians, consultants…). When this information is analysed for a group of firms, one can observe their characteristics in terms of both managerial tasks and business management. As for the second objective, the methodology proposed served to describe the corporate profile of the large Spanish enterprises included in the Ibex 35 (the Ibex 35 or Iberia Index is the reference index in the Spanish Stock Exchange and gathers periodically the 35 most outstanding Spanish firms). An attempt is therefore made to define the long-range planning that would be characteristic of the largest Spanish firms...|$|R
40|$|The Bonneville Power Administration (BPA) {{has decided}} to adopt a Power Subscription Strategy for {{entering}} into new power sales contracts with its Pacific Northwest customers. The Strategy equitably distributes the electric power generated by the Federal Columbia River Power System (FCRPS) {{within the framework of}} existing law. The Power Subscription Strategy addresses the availability of power; describes power products; lays out strategies for pricing, including risk management; and discusses contract elements. In proceeding with this Subscription Strategy, BPA is guided by and committed to the Fish and Wildlife funding Principles for the BPA announced by the Vice President of the US in September 1998. This Record of Decision (ROD) addresses the issues raised by commenters who responded to BPA`s Power Subscription Strategy Proposal during and after the comment period that began with the release of the Proposal on September 18, 1998. The ROD is organized in approximately {{the same way as the}} Proposal and the Power Subscription Strategy that BPA developed based on the <b>comments</b> received.

40|$|The {{results of}} the European {{elections}} 2014 in Spain were characterized by the outstanding rise <b>of</b> a new <b>party,</b> Podemos, which obtained five seats in the European Parliament, despite being founded {{few months before the}} elections. The present study analyzes both the content and the presence of emotions in Podemos’ discourse on Facebook during the European electoral campaign. In particular, the affective content <b>of</b> both the <b>party’s</b> discourse and the <b>comments</b> <b>of</b> its followers will be analyzed through a pragmatic linguistic approach applied to a corpus of 163 posts and 215 followers’ comments. Results show an insistence on positive emotions in the party’s discourse and a prevalence of negative emotions in the <b>comments</b> <b>of</b> the citizens. </p...|$|R

Recent efforts have extended the debate to the more specific question <b>of</b> whether <b>party</b> influences are sufficiently strong to bend policy outcomes away from the median position. In this paper, we specify and test four theories of legislative behavior. One is a preference-based, or party-less, theory of behavior. This theory posits no <b>party</b> effects independent <b>of</b> preferences and that equilibrium outcomes are located at the chamber’s median. Each of the others is based on a different theory of the foundations <b>of</b> <b>party</b> effects and yields distinctive predictions about the legislators who will support bills on final passage votes. Our conclusion is that strong-party influences can be found in final passage voting in the House, but not the Senate. In the House, the preference-based theory receives littl...|$|R
