There are several types of devices that can be implanted into patients: pacemakers (PM), implantable cardioverter – defibrillators (ICD) and cardiac resynchronization therapy devices (CRT). All of the above-mentioned devices improve the quality of life and affect the survival. The quality of life is now considered as a significant purpose of treatment of patients with a cardiovascular disease. Surveys on the quality of life are especially useful to cardiac patients as they allow for conducting an overall assessment of their mental and physical state, the quality of life and the effectiveness of the treatment. In the available scientific literature, there are numerous analyses and data on the quality of life of patients with a cardiac pacemaker in different areas of its functionality. The presented review features research projects that measured the quality of life in various respects, e. g. limitations related to poor physical health, the impact of physical activity on everyday life, pain, general perception of health, emotional state and its impact on everyday life, limitations related to emotional problems or to physical health, mental health, vitality, and any issues related to the treatment of cardiac arrhythmias through the implantation of <b>cardiac</b> <b>stimulation</b> <b>devices.</b> In the earliest publications the numbers of participants were very low and thus the results may have been uncertain. However, more recent publications include sufficient number of participants to formulate general conclusions on the quality of life in the overall study population. The quality of life after implantation has improved significantly. Keywords: quality of life, permanent cardiac pacing, literature revie...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background: Chagas disease {{continues}} to be a serious public health problem, and accounts for 25 - 30 % of the indications for <b>cardiac</b> <b>stimulation</b> in Brazil. Objective: To assess clinical and epidemiological characteristics of patients with Chagas disease, younger than 18 years, who had undergone pacemaker implantation in Brazil between 1994 and 2011, and its temporal trend. Methods: This was a cross-sectional analysis of data from the Brazilian Pacemaker Registry database. The following variables were analyzed: year when pacemaker was implanted, location, age, sex, ethnic group, functional class and the main electrocardiographic findings at baseline. Results: In a total of 183, 123 implants performed between 1994 and 2011, 214 implants of <b>cardiac</b> <b>stimulation</b> <b>device</b> in Chagas disease patients aged younger than 18 years were identified. Mean age at implantation was 5. 6 ± 6. 2 years. Second- and third-degree atrioventricular blocks corresponded to 71 % of indications for pacemaker implantation. Fifty-six percent of the procedures were performed in the southeast region. Regarding the total number of pacemaker implants per year, there was a remarkable increase in the implants for all causes. However, time series analysis of the implants in Chagas disease patients younger than 18 years revealed a significant reduction in the annual number of implants. Conclusion: There has been an important {{reduction in the number of}} pacemaker implantations among children and adolescents with Chagas disease, suggesting a reduction in the vertical transmission of the parasite...|$|R

An extract of Brazilian scorpion venom was assayed {{upon the}} isolated {{heart of the}} guinea pig. The typical effect of the venom, in final concentrations {{of the order of}} 10 g/ml, is a short-lasting bradycardia followed by a conspicuous increase in the force and the frequency of cardiac contractions. The venom also produces a marked rise in the phosphoryl-ase a activity of the perfused heart. The bradycardia is blocked by atropine (1 O g/ml) and potentiated by neostigmine (10 #{ 176 }g/ml). The <b>cardiac</b> <b>stimulation</b> is abolished by the beta sympatholytic agent propranolol (1 O g/ml) and by the adrenergic blocking agent bretylium (1 O g/nil); the <b>cardiac</b> <b>stimulation</b> is also absent in the hearts of reserpine-treated guinea pigs. Hexamethonium (1 O g/ml) does not affect either the bradycardia or the <b>cardiac</b> <b>stimulation</b> elicited by the venom in doses which abolish the effects of nicotine.

The region of the bundle of His 7 - 12, the right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) 13 - 23 and the mid-septal region 24 - 26 have been assessed. Most studies involved a small sample size, without randomization, and the criteria used to define the stimulation site might have led to the assessment of heterogeneous groups. Likewise, different methods have been used to evaluate the functional outcome of <b>cardiac</b> <b>stimulation.</b> Therefore, in spite of the demonstration of the deleterious effects of the RV apical stimulation and potential benefits of the alternative sites, conflicting results have been reported and the site of choice for the implant of the right ventricular electrode is yet to be defined. The objective {{of this study is to}} analyze the alternative sites for artificial <b>cardiac</b> <b>stimulation</b> in the context of evidence-based cardiology.

Ever since the first experimental studies, the differences between the artificial stimulation and the physiological activation have not gone unnoticed 27, 28.

This enabled us to infer whether lack of release efficiency was due to fish behaviour or release potential of the square meshes in the section. The results showed that the escape behaviour of haddock can be triggered by mechanical stimulation. In contrast, cod did not react significantly to the presence of mechanical stimulators.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{meta-analysis}} was to quantify the effect of electrical stimulation on chronic wound healing. Fifteen studies, which included 24 electrical stimulation samples and 15 control samples, were analyzed.

The samples were then grouped by type of electrical <b>stimulation</b> <b>device</b> and chronic wound and reanalyzed.

Unilateral facial paresis disables facial muscles on one side causing several problems for facial functions and non-verbal communication. One way to treat facial paresis is electrical stimulation of facial muscles which is a largely examined method. However, different aspects of user experience of facial stimulation have not been systematically investigated. This study examined experience of electrical facial stimulation as well as experience of using two commercial <b>stimulation</b> <b>devices.</b> According to several studies, people judge stimuli and organize experiences through three key dimensions: pleasure, arousal and dominance. These dimensions together with acceptance and naturalness were used to evaluate the user experience of electrical stimulation.

An external computerised programmable system with algorithm control activated by a radio frequency system was used to vary the <b>cardiac</b> <b>stimulation</b> rate in relation to respiration rate in 11 patients implanted with ventricular inhibited pacemakers. In addition, a prototype programmable pacemaker dependent on respiration rate was implanted in two patients. Maximum values of oxygen uptake, minute ventilation, and work time were increased during the exercise stress tests when the variable cardiac pacing rate was used. Thus respiration rate appears to be a valid and stable physiological variable for controlling the <b>cardiac</b> <b>stimulation</b> rate in order to improve cardiac output in patients dependent on pacemakers...|$|R
