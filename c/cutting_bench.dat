All of Goldfinger's female henchwomen in the film except his private jet's co-pilot (black hair) and stewardess (who is Korean) are red-blonde, or blonde, including Pussy Galore and her Flying Circus crew (both the characters Tilly Masterson and Pussy specifically have black hair in the novel). Goldfinger has a yellow-painted Rolls-Royce with number plate [...] "AU1" [...] ("Au" [...] being the chemical symbol for gold), and also sports yellow or golden items or clothing in every film scene, including a golden pistol, when disguised as a colonel. Bond is bound to a <b>cutting</b> <b>bench</b> with a sheet of gold on it (as Goldfinger points out to him) before nearly being lasered. Goldfinger's factory henchmen in the film wear yellow sashes, Pussy Galore twice wears a metallic gold vest, and Pussy's pilots all wear yellow sunburst insignia on their uniforms. Goldfinger's Jetstar hostess, Mei-Lei, wears a golden bottice and gold-accented sarong. [...] The concept of the recurring gold theme running through the film was a design aspect conceived and executed by Ken Adam and art director Peter Murton.|$|E

In the first instance, hot cutting tests are performed with an orthogonal <b>cutting</b> test <b>bench.</b> The emergence of dynamic recrystallization is highlighted thanks to microstructural observations. Then, a finite element model of the hot cutting operation is introduced. The material behaviour is modelled with a specific constitutive model considering the influence of dynamic recrystallization on the plastic flow stress. Finally, the predictive response of this model is compared to the experimental observations...|$|R

40|$|To {{determine}} the rational order of disk tools placement on the working body {{is necessary to}} know {{the maximum amount of}} rock, destroyed by the disk tool in <b>benching</b> <b>cutting</b> mode depending on the tool geometry parameters, physical and mechanical parameters of rocks. The article contains the definition of rational parameters of cutting disk tools as well as power and energy parameters of the destruction process by cutting disks and by executive body of the coal cutter. The rational geometric parameters of cutting discs are specified. It was found that each step of cutting with a minimum depth of penetration has its own maximum height of bench outcrop. The dependence of the volumes of large items destroyed by the disk tool on the cutting step height was determined. The existence of the cyclic alternation of destruction phases, regardless the fracture parameters, the height of the ledge outcrop, and tools like free cutting geometry were found. In contrast to the free <b>cutting</b> in <b>benching</b> mode of destruction two large fragments of rocks in one cycle were observed. Consequently, the cyclical nature of the destruction process in the benching mode will be characterized by two chips and crushing, and this cycling repeats throughout the destruction process with the same parameters of destruction...|$|R

40|$|URL] audienceThe present paper {{investigates the}} brittle-ductile {{transition}} (BDT) {{of the primary}} shear zone during cutting of spheroidal graphite (SG) iron in the austenitization temperature range (around 1000 °C). The experimental tests were performed using a <b>cutting</b> test <b>bench</b> in the <b>cutting</b> speed range of 0. 8 to 1. 6 m. s- 1. The cut surfaces were studied using optical microscopy and Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) analysis techniques. The obtained results revealed either consequent deep fractured regions governed by a brittle-cracking regime (BCR) or a crack-free cut surface governed by a ductile-shear regime (DSR) with large plastic deformations. When cutting data were discussed {{with respect to the}} influences of cutting parameters and obtained cut surface, the correlation is significantly rich. Both cut surface integrity, cutting force curves and metallographic results show a BDT indicating a change in the dominating hot cutting process mechanism. Such a transition is associated with the dynamic recrystallization promoting strain softening and hot cutting by ductile shearing...|$|R

The burial chamber measured [...] (NS by EW) and was [...] high. The chamber contained the bones of an adult male aged between 36 and 55 years old. Although the bones had been disturbed by the looters, {{it is likely that}} he had been laid out on his back with a north-south orientation. A few broken ceramic remains among the looters' debris dated the tomb to the late 8th century AD.|$|R
40|$|A growth {{analysis}} of the rose cv. 'Motrea' was carried out during 6 months after planting, in January. The purpose of the experiment {{was to investigate the}} effect of plant propagation: <b>cutting,</b> stenting, <b>bench</b> grafting or budding. During the first 5 weeks of plant growth, cuttings and stentlings transported between 25 to 50 ␘f the newly formed dry matter into the roots. In contrast bench grafts and bud propagated bushes did not form any new roots during this period. However, during the next 5 months they invested between 6 and 9 g of dry matter resp. in their roots system as compared to only 4 g with the cuttings and stentlings. As a result after 6 months the shoot/root ratio of bench grafts and budded bushes was about 4, whereas that of cuttings and stentlings was about 10. The totally different initial dry weights, ranging from 0. 3 g for cuttings to 12 g for the bushes, were largely compensated by differences in RGR, ranging between 0. 04 and 0. 018 d- 1 resp. The four propagation systems studied implied different genotypes of root stock as well. In future research {{it will be necessary to}} separate the effects of genotype and propagation method. Also a further growth {{analysis of}} the later periods of growth is necessary, including bottom break formation, branching and flowering...|$|R
40|$|International audienceIn {{numerical}} {{approaches for}} high speed machining, the rheological behavior of machined materials is usually {{described by a}} Johnson Cook law. However, {{studies have shown that}} dynamic recrystallization phenomena appear during machining in the tool/chip interface. The Johnson Cook constitutive law does not include such phenomena. Thus, specific rheological models based on metallurgy are introduced to consider these dynamic recrystallization phenomena. Two empirical models proposed by Kim et al. (2003) and Lurdos (2008) are investigated in machining modeling. A two-dimensional finite element model of orthogonal cutting, using an Arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) formulation, is developed with the Abaqus/explicit software. Specific rheological models are implemented in the calculation code thanks to a subroutine. This finite element model can then predict chip formation, interfacial temperatures, chip-tool contact length, cutting forces and chip thickness with also and especially the recrystallized area. New specific experiments on an orthogonal <b>cutting</b> test <b>bench</b> are conducted on AISI 1045 steel specimens with an uncoated carbide tool. Many tests are performed and results are focused on total chip thicknesses and recrystallized chip thicknesses. Finally, compared to numerical results got with a Johnson Cook law, numerical results obtained using specific rheological models to take into account dynamic recrystallization phenomena are very close to experimental results. This work shows also the influence of rheological behavior laws on predicted results in the modeling of high speed modeling...|$|R
40|$|After a heat treatment, {{spheroidal}} graphite (SG) irons offer an efficient compromise between density and mechanical properties. Therefore, these SG irons, also called austempered ductile iron (ADI), {{are intended to}} substitute forged steels for the weight reduction of engine parts. Indeed, they combine strength, fracture toughness and high resistance to abrasive wear at low cost. To save time and energy, ADI components have to be manufactured by a combined casting and forging process followed by a specific heat treatment called austempering. Through this, they compete with forged steel parts. The manufacture of an automotive connecting rod needs to perform the removal of risers and feeder head at 1000 °C just after the casting operation (Meena and El Mansori, 2011). However, this step can cause several surface degradations which jeopardize the forged component viability (Fouilland and El Mansori, 2012). A multiscale analysis is proposed to evaluate the sensitive parameters for the hot cutting process. A global approach consists in experiments on an orthogonal <b>cutting</b> test <b>bench</b> allowing to reproduce the actual stress state observed during the hot cutting process. Several tests are performed with different cutting speeds and observed cut surfaces are discussed. This orthogonal cutting test is modelled with the Abaqus software. Rheological behaviour of SG iron is then determined using Gleeble 3500 system versus temperatures and strain rates. This rheological law is finally implemented in the numerical model which enables to get thermo-mechanical conditions (temperatures, strain rate and plastic deformation) in the primary shear zone. This local approach is a contribution to explain the surface degradation phenomena during hot cutting process on SG iron...|$|R

The influence of different indol- 3 - butiric acid (IBA) concentrations (1, 000, 2, 500, 5, 000 and 7, 500 ppm) was evaluated in early spring 2007. The data was gathered one month after <b>bench</b> <b>cutting</b> plantation. The parameters measured and analyzed were the number of rooted cuttings, the number of cuttings with callus formation and mortality, {{the mean number of}} roots (NR) and the mean main root length (MRL), per rooted cutting. The IBA application influenced the rooting percentage, the NR and the MRL, but the results were IBA concentration independent. In P. laurocerasus rooting ranged from 67 % and 80 %, when IBA was applied, values significantly superior to 37 % of rooted cuttings in the control. The highest NR and MRL values were found in the treatment with 7, 500 ppm IBA (27. 2 of roots per cutting) and with 1, 000 ppm IBA (MRL was 24. 76 mm), respectively. Significantly lower values were obtained in the control: 5. 56 NR and 9. 4 mm of MRL.
