On a map by Frizell dated 1779 it is called the Widow Clifford's mill and mill holding and in 1843 it is named the Ely <b>Cloth</b> <b>Factory.</b> A Mr. Murray then owned it but in 1850, it passed into the hands of Mr. Nickson who converted it into a flour mill.

In 1799, {{he passed a}} resolution ending the labor conflict at the <b>cloth</b> <b>factory</b> in Pociovaliște (presently part of Bucharest). After reforming its system of worker employment and payment, as well as hiring Saxon experts from Transylvania to manage the industry, he denied the workers' request to institute two weeks off for each week of labor, and ordered activities to be resumed, while stressing that it was imperative to respect the Ottoman demand for textiles (see Labor movement in Romania). At the time, the employees did not receive payment, but worked in exchange for tax exemptions.|$|E
25|$|Immediately {{adjoining}} is Church Lane at {{the corner}} of which is a bank built on the site of a Royal Irish Constabulary barracks that was burned down by Anti-Treaty IRA forces in September 1922 during the Irish Civil War. In the lane is an old blocked up doorway of an early eighteenth century type. Church Lane leads to Woodview cottages, which are built partly on the site of an old paper mill. The mill race previously mentioned passed under Butterfield Lane to the paper mill and continued on below Ashfield to turn the wheel of the Ely <b>Cloth</b> <b>Factory.</b> It was later turned into the Owen Doher River at Woodview Cottages. Until recently, when the new road was made to Templeogue, the old mill race could still be traced through the grounds of Ashfield where its dry bed was still spanned by several stone bridges.|$|E
