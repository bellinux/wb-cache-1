25|$|In the 1840s, Comanche raids became larger, more deadly, and {{penetrated}} {{deeply into}} Mexico. In September 1840 and continuing until March 1841 came {{the first of}} the great raids. During this period six Comanche armies numbering between two hundred and eight hundred warriors invaded northern Mexico. The most far reaching of the raids reached the region of San Luis Potosí and Zacatecas 400 miles south of the Big Bend, their most <b>common</b> <b>crossing</b> point into Mexico. 472 Mexicans were reported killed and more than 100 captives were taken from these raids. Many others were left homeless, their livelihoods destroyed, their livestock stolen or killed. So much wealth did the Comanches obtain that the number of raids dropped off slightly for the next three years, but resumed even more intensely between 1844 and 1848—after the Comanches had made peace with Texas.|$|E

50|$|As speeds rose, {{this was}} no longer {{feasible}} and the switch rails were fixed at the heel end, and their flexibility enabled the toe end to open and close.

A difficulty was the <b>common</b> <b>crossing</b> where continuous support to wheels passing was difficult, and the point rail was planed to protect it from direct impact in the facing direction, so that a designed irregularity in support was introduced.|$|E

40|$|The {{charging}} {{behavior of}} carboxyl latex {{surface in the}} presence of poly(diallyl dimethyl ammonium chloride) (DADMAC) was investigated by means of potentiometric titrations and electrophoretic mobility. The titration curves at different ionic strengths show a <b>common</b> <b>crossing</b> point, which coincides with the point of zero mobility, and can be identified with the point of zero charge (PZC). This characteristic behavior is due to the adsorption of the strong cationic polyelectrolyte on the weak acid particle surface, leading to an additional positive charge, and a corresponding shift of the surface potential. These features can be quantified in terms of modified Stern model and the standard electrokinetic model. This model predicts the PZC very well, while the magnitude of the charge and its ionic strength dependence are reproduced only semi-quantitativel...|$|E

40|$|Context: Stochastic {{acceleration}} {{is thought}} to be a key mechanism in the energization of solar flare electrons. Aims: We study whether stochastic acceleration can reproduce the observed soft-hard-soft evolution of the spectral features of the hard X-ray emitted by suprathermal electron. We pay special attention to the effects of particle trapping and escape. Methods: The Fokker-Planck equation for the electron distribution is integrated numerically using the coefficients derived by Miller et al. for transit-time damping acceleration. The electron spectra are then converted to photon spectra for comparison with RHESSI observation of looptop sources. Results: The presence of particle escape softens the model spectra computed in the stochastic acceleration framework. The ratio between the efficiency of trapping and acceleration controls the spectral evolution which follows a soft-hard-soft pattern. Furthermore, a pivot point (that is, a <b>common</b> <b>crossing</b> point of the accelerated particle spectra at different times) is found at around 10 keV. It can be brought into agreement with the observed value of 20 keV by enhanced trapping through an electric potential. Conclusions: The model proposed here accounts for the key features observed in the spectral evolution of hard X-ray emission from looptop sources.
