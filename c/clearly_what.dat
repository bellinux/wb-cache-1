In short, she could popularize while she could neither discover nor invent.|$|E

There is also a necessary implication that notice must not only be given, but that it must be sufficient and accurate.

She told one FBI agent that pursuing the cause of jihad had to take priority. Khan said he believed that the missing children were in Karachi, either with or in contact with Siddiqui's family, and not in US detention. He said that they were seen in her sister's house in Karachi and in Islamabad since 2003.|$|E

25|$|Despite his {{experience}} in the ballet world, Henze had never before composed a subject in the romantic style which Ashton requested, however Ashton had been impressed by Henze's treatment of magical material in his opera König Hirsch. Henze attended many ballet performances at Covent Garden, frequently accompanied by Ashton who told him <b>clearly</b> <b>what</b> he liked {{and what he did}} not like in music for dance. Eventually the work was completed, but when Ashton heard a recording of the orchestrated score he realised {{that he would have to}} revise his ideas; the sustained orchestral sounds were such a contrast to the piano score and made him think very differently.|$|E
25|$|Pre-production began almost {{immediately}} after Broadchurch was given the green light. Heads for each department of the production—cinematography and lighting, editing, casting, make-up and hair, costuming, locations, administration, sound, etc.—were hired, and research began {{in all areas of}} production. Test footage was shot and screened for ITV executives at a pre-shoot meeting, so they could see more <b>clearly</b> <b>what</b> the series' mood and style would be like. Although ITV made a sizeable financial investment in Broadchurch, additional funds were needed because {{of the cost of the}} large ensemble cast. Additional funds were sought from international partners, who were given distribution rights in their territories in return. Before principal photography began, ZDF (German public-service television broadcaster) and BBC America (the American cable and satellite television network jointly owned by the BBC and AMC Networks) came aboard the production as financial partners.|$|E

Screenwriter Simon Kinberg took over from the Butterworths, and eight weeks {{before the start of}} filming, he was replaced by Christopher McQuarrie. McQuarrie was introduced to the project while directing Cruise in Jack Reacher. [...] While reading the earlier script McQuarrie [...] "understood very <b>clearly</b> <b>what</b> the premise of the story was and {{what they were looking for}} in terms of characters". Even if the previous scripts were darker, Cruise stressed the importance of the story's humor to McQuarrie. The actor compared Cage's violent demises to Wile E.

500|$|According to Stefani, {{the various}} {{emotions}} she had {{experienced in the}} past year would be reflected on the album. The first songs written for the album had a sarcastic and humorous vibe, while she later described the other songs as having a [...] "realness" [...] to them. The first song written for the album was [...] "You Don't Know Me", a personal song penned with Rick Nowels. According to the singer, the song was [...] "the first opening of the channel" [...] of her songwriting inspiration. In the early stages, she also wrote a song with Linda Perry called [...] "Medicine Man" [...] while flying to No Doubt's Jazz Festival show in New Orleans. Another song, [...] "Red Flag", was the first song she wrote with J.R. Rotem, Justin Tranter and Julia Michaels. She described it as a [...] "work of art" [...] for [...] "express so <b>clearly</b> <b>what</b> [...] was [...] at the time". They also worked on other songs, such as [...] "Naughty", [...] "Misery", which she considered a [...] "really happy song," [...] and [...] "Make Me Like You", produced by Mattman & Robin, which, having been surprised by the result, she called [...] "so good"! ...|$|E
500|$|Music {{journalist}} Charles Shaar Murray {{likens the}} figure to a feminine ideal: [...] "Sometimes {{she is a}} spirit, sometimes a fantasy, sometimes a woman as solidly, palpably physical as he is". [...] The figure first appears as [...] "Waterfall" [...] in [...] "May This Be Love", where she offers solace and hope, and as [...] "a soulful, loving sprite" [...] in [...] "Little Wing". [...] However, other writers {{have suggested that the}} figure is similar to the guardian angel associated with Christianity, which is <b>clearly</b> <b>what</b> she represents in Hendrix's later song [...] "Angel". Hendrix's brother, Leon, interpreted [...] "Little Wing" [...] (and [...] "Angel") as a general tribute: [...] "He wrote it for his girlfriends, our aunties, and especially for our mama, who looked over us from high above in the afterlife". [...] Hendrix's hand-written lyrics for [...] "Angel" [...] (with the note, [...] "Finished January 14, 1968") use the title [...] "My Angel Catherina (Return of Little Wing)", which suggests that he saw a connection between the two songs. [...] At the time, Hendrix had just finished a short tour of Scandinavia, where he had performed [...] "Little Wing" [...] in concert for the first time. [...] At some point he responded to a question, [...] "Love? I know a girl, Katerina, in Sweden." [...] In a later 1969 interview, Hendrix described his relationships while he was on tour: [...] "So like 'Little Wing' is like one of these beautiful girls that come around sometimes... She was a very sweet girl that came around that gave me her whole life and more if I wanted it. And me with my crazy ass couldn't get it together, so I'm off here and there and off over there." ...|$|E
