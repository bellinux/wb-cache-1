40|$|The {{present study}} {{assessed}} in vivo endocrine disrupting effect of orally administered lambda-cyhalothrin (LCT) on metabolic hormones and correlated it with hematological instabilities. Adult female albino rats were divided in three equal groups; one kept as control and other two treated with 20 and 40 mg/kg BW LCT, respectively by oral gavage for 14 days. At {{the end of}} trial, blood was collected for hormonal and hematological analysis. The results showed that LCT led to reduction in serum triiodothyronine (T 3) and thyroxin (T 4) level (P< 0. 001) without modifying serum thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) level in a dose related manner. Lambda-cyhalothrin also caused a significant (P< 0. 05) reduction in hemoglobin (Hb) concentration, red blood cell (RBC) count, total leukocyte count (TLC), platelets <b>count,</b> <b>pack</b> cell volume (PCV) and lymphocyte count. No significant variation was observed in erythrocytic indices. In sum, orally administered LCT caused reduction in feed intake and body weight along with disruption of hemato-biochemical parameters...|$|E
40|$|Aim: Fasciolosis is a {{parasitic}} disease caused by Fasciola spp. {{of the family}} Fasciolidae (trematodes) characterized by bottle jaw, anemia, progressive debility, and potbelly condition. There are many aspects of fasciolosis remaining unknown thus hemato-biochemical alterations in closantel, triclabendazole + ivermectin, and oxyclozanide + levamisole treated goats were studied. Materials and Methods: A total of 40 naturally fasciolosis infected goats having egg per gram more than 100 were randomly divided into four groups. Goats of Group I-III were treated with three different anthelmintics, whereas, goats of Group-IV were kept as control or untreated. Whole blood, serum, and fecal samples were collected on 0, 7 th, and 30 th day of treatment. Results: During the study, values of hemoglobin, total erythrocyte <b>count,</b> <b>pack</b> cell volume, and total protein were significantly elevated to their normal levels in anthelmintics treated groups. Whereas, values of total leukocyte count, aspartate transaminase (AST), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) were significantly reduced to their normal level in anthelmintics treated groups. The efficacy of closantel (T 1), triclabendazole + ivermectin (T 2), and oxyclozanide + levamisole (T 3) was 99. 63...|$|E

40|$|The {{haematology}} of {{a colony}} of wild allied rock-wallabies, Petrogale assimilis Ramsay, 1877, from north-western Queensland was studied for 20 months. Wallabies were repeatedly trapped at monthly intervals and 511 blood samples from 96 animals were examined, making this the most comprehensive study of the haematology of any macropod species. The morphology of the red blood cells and leucocytes was {{similar to those of}} other marsupials. Large and small lymphocytes were recognised. Binucleate lymphocytes were found in 7. 2 % of blood smears. Normal haematological values were within the published ranges for other marsupials. However, the average white blood cell count (mean +/- s. e. : 9. 03 +/- 0. 92 X 10 (9) L- 1) was close to {{the upper end of the}} range for macropods. The normal (mean +/- s. e.) red blood cell count (5. 24 + 0. 15 X 10 (12) L- 1), packed cell volume (0. 4291 +/- 0. 019 L L- 1) and haemoglobin concentration (14. 07 +/- 0. 41 g dL- 1) of male wallabies were higher than those of females (4. 79 +/- 0. 15 X 10 (12) L- 1, 0. 3952 +/- 1. 19 L L- 1, and 12. 95 +/- 0. 41 g dL- 1, respectively). No gender differences were detected in the white blood cell count (9. 03 +/- 0. 92 x 10 (9) L- 1), mean corpuscular volume (82. 28 +/- 1. 35 fL), mean corpuscular haemoglobin (26. 98 +/- 0. 57 pg) or mean corpuscular haemoglobin concentration (32. 82 +/- 0. 57 g L 1).

Later, its graph became a common example of a fractal curve.

Then we apply these to the W-M function. We show how to compute the boxcounting dimension of its graph, and discuss previous attempts at proving the not yet completely resolved conjecture of the equality of its Hausdorff and box counting dimensions. We also consider a surface generalization of the W-M function, compute its box dimension, and discuss its Hausdorff dimension.
