40|$|The aim of {{the present}} work is the {{development}} of a rapid and effective analytical procedure for the determination of <b>coccidiostats</b> in eggs. Nicarbazin, robenidine, diclazuril, clazuril, toltrazuril and its metabolite were diluted by distilled water and subjected to clean-up by SPE styrene-divinylbenzene columns. <b>Coccidiostats</b> were eluted with methanol and determined by using HPLC-MS/MS. Separation was carried out on ODS column in gradient mode, with methanol–water mixture acidified with 0. 1 % formic acid as an eluent. Tandem mass spectrometry analysis was performed with turboion spray ionisation in positive and negative ion mode by using multi reaction monitoring (MRM). The procedure has been successfully applied for eggs during routine and confirmatory analysis. Validation was performed according to Commission Decision 2002 / 657 /EC criteria by determining linearity, precision, recovery, specificity, decision limit (CCα) and detection capability (CCβ). The recovery of <b>coccidiostats</b> ranged from 80 % to 94 %, with R. S. D. of 15 % for all <b>coccidiostats</b> under investigation...|$|R

40|$|Antimicrobials {{revolutionized}} human {{as well as}} animal {{medicine in}} the 20 th century by providing effective treatment of diseases caused by pathogenic microorganisms. However, microorganisms {{have the ability to}} develop antimicrobial resistant strains. This occurs when microorganisms mutate or when resistance genes are exchanged between them. The use of antimicrobial drugs accelerates the emergence of drug-resistant strains. A priority is to safeguard the efficacy of antimicrobial drugs we depend on for treatment of infectious diseases in humans. Use of antimicrobials in food animals can create a source of antimicrobial resistant bacteria that can spread to humans both by direct contact and through the food supply. Coccidiosis is an intestinal disease in animals caused by unicellular parasites called coccidia. As most of the damage of this infection is done by the time signs of the disease are widespread, preventive measures are preferred. <b>Coccidiostats</b> are animal feed additives used to prevent coccidiosis by inhibiting or killing coccidia. There are two major groups of coccidiostats; ionophores and non-ionophores, the latter also referred to as “non-ionophore coccidiostats” (but also called chemicals). One main difference between these groups is that ionophores also inhibit or kill some bacterial species, whereas non-ionophore <b>coccidiostats</b> do not. Consequently, some bacterial infections may also be controlled by ionophore <b>coccidiostats,</b> e. g. the poultry disease necrotic enteritis caused by the bacterium Clostridium perfringens (C. perfringens). Eleven different <b>coccidiostats</b> have been authorised for use in the EU, both ionophores and non-ionophore <b>coccidiostats.</b> Norway has been exempted from the EEA Agreement in this field and has approved only five; all ionophores. The two ionophore <b>coccidiostats</b> currently used in Norway are narasin for broilers and monensin for turkeys...|$|R
40|$|In poultry farming, {{anticoccidial}} {{drugs are}} widely used as feed additives for the prevention and treatment of coccidiosis. Because <b>coccidiostats</b> and veterinary medicines, in general, are often poorly absorbed, manure from treated animals may contain high concentrations of these compounds. Experimental {{studies have shown that}} the uptake of veterinary medicines by plants from soil containing contaminated manure may occur. This leads to several questions regarding the impact on the environment, resistance problems, and public health and allergy issues. This work describes the development of a quantification method for <b>coccidiostats</b> in vegetables. Vegetables were spiked at 100 mu g kg(- 1) (dry weight) with <b>coccidiostats</b> (monensin, narasin, lasalocid A, salinomycin, diclazuril, and nicarbazin) in order to optimize the extraction and clean-up. Possible critical factors (e. g., extraction solvent) were statistically examined by linear regression with the use of Plackett-Burman and full factorial designs. Final extracts were analyzed with ultra-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry operating in multiple-reaction monitoring mode. Both the synthetic and ionophoric <b>coccidiostats</b> could be determined in a single run with an analysis time of 5 min. The developed method was validated taking into account the requirements of the Commission Decision 2002 / 657 /EC as a guideline. The method is regarded as applicable for its intended purposes with quantification limits between 0. 30 and 2. 98 mu g kg(- 1). This method could be used to establish possible maximum residue limits for <b>coccidiostats</b> in vegetables, as already exist for eggs, meat, and milk...|$|R

40|$|Due to an {{increasing}} demand for natural products to control coccidiosis in broilers, we investigated {{the effects of}} supplementing a combination of ethanolic extracts of Artemisia annua and Curcuma longa in drinking water. Three different dosages of this herbal mixture were compared with a negative control (uninfected), a positive control (infected and untreated), chemical <b>coccidiostats</b> (nicarbazin+narazin and, later, salinomycin), vaccination, and a product based on oregano. Differences in performance (weight gain, feed intake, and feed conversion rate), mortality, gross intestinal lesions and oocyst excretion were investigated. Broilers given chemical <b>coccidiostats</b> performed better than all other groups. Broilers given the two highest dosages of the herbal mixture had intermediate lesion scores caused by Eimeria acervulina, which was higher than in broilers given <b>coccidiostats,</b> but less than in broilers given vaccination, oregano and in negative controls. There was a trend for lower mortality (P = 0 center dot 08) in the later stage of the growing period (23 - 43 days) in broilers given the highest dosage of herbal mixture compared with broilers given chemical <b>coccidiostats.</b> In conclusion, the delivery strategy of the herbal extracts is easy to implement at farm level, but further studies on dose levels and modes of action are needed...|$|R
40|$|<b>Coccidiostats</b> are {{the only}} {{veterinary}} drugs still permitted {{to be used as}} feed additives to treat poultry for coccidiosis. To protect consumers, maximum levels for their presence in food and feed have been set by the European Union (EU). To monitor these <b>coccidiostats,</b> a rapid and inexpensive screening method would be a useful tool. The development of such a screening method, using a flow cytometry-based immunoassay, is described. The assay uses five sets of colour-coded paramagnetic microspheres for the detection of six selected priority <b>coccidiostats.</b> Different <b>coccidiostats,</b> with and without carrier proteins, were covalently coupled onto different bead sets and tested in combination with polyclonal antisera and with a fluorescent-labelled secondary antibody. The five optimal combinations were selected for this multiplex and a simple-to-use sample extraction method was applied for screening blank and spiked eggs and feed samples. A very good correlation (r ranging from 0. 995 to 0. 999) was obtained with the responses obtained in two different flow cytometers (Luminex 100 and FLEXMAP 3 D). The sensitivities obtained were in accordance with the levels set by the EU as the measured limits of detection for narasin/salinomycin, lasalocid, diclazuril, nicarbazin (4, 4 '-dinitrocarbanilide) and monensin in eggs were 0. 01, 0. 1, 0. 5, 53 and 0. 1 µg/kg and in feed 0. 1, 0. 2, 0. 3, 9 and 1. 5 µg/kg, respectively...|$|R
40|$|A new and fit {{to purpose}} multi-analyte method for the {{determination}} of six <b>coccidiostats</b> (monensin A, salinomycin, narasin, composed of its principle components narasin A and its minor component narasin I, lasalocid, semduramicin and maduramicin) in poultry and cattle compound feed by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) has been developed and in-house validated. The concentration level of the target analytes at which the validation experiments {{have been carried out}} varied between 1 and 9 mg kg. The method developed involved a simple extraction of the <b>coccidiostats</b> from the feed samples followed by a clean-up by solid-phase extraction prior to chromatographic analysis. The analytes were quantified either by matrix matched standards or by the standard addition technique, obtaining the following performance profile of the method for the various analyte/matrix combinations. When quantifying against matrix matched standards, the concentration independent intermediate precision expressed in terms of relative percentage standard deviation varied between 4 and 10 % and the relative percentage recovery rates ranged from 87 to 120 % depending on the target analyte and matrix. When using the standard addition technique, the corresponding values for the intermediate precision varied between 2 and 8 % and the relative percentage recovery rate ranged from 73 to 115 %. The limit of detection (LOD) and limit of quantification (LOQ) were different for the various analyte/matrix combinations but were in all cases below 0. 014 mg kg and 0. 046 mg kg respectively. Based on the obtained method performance characteristics, the method is considered suitable for {{the determination of}} ionophore <b>coccidiostats</b> in target feed. The main field of application of the validated method is to enforce European legislation regarding the authorisation of <b>coccidiostats,</b> focusing on the measurement at the authorised levels and at low level in feed during the withdrawal period at which the <b>coccidiostats</b> must not be added to the feed. Overall, the method proposed appears to be appropriate as a confirmatory method for the monitoring of these six ionophore <b>coccidiostats</b> and can therefore be considered as complimentary to the official PHLC-UV methods.

40|$|This article {{presents}} {{a review of}} the current trends in the analysis of <b>coccidiostats</b> in various matrices, focusing principally on screening and rapid methods. Coccidiosis is an infectious disease having a high negative impact on the animal industry. Drugs are therefore necessary to prevent and/or to combat this disease. However, it is also of crucial importance that these veterinary drugs do not enter the human food chain. European legislation has therefore established the boundaries for the use of coccidiosats and has also addressed the unavoidable problem of cross-contamination of the feed, mainly caused by the use of the same production lines. Consequently {{there is a need for}} analytical methods and/or analytical strategies for the monitoring and control of the residues of anticoccidials, both in feed and in the resulting matrices for human consumption. In the frame of the European collaborative project CONffIDENCE, such attempts to establish the required analytical tools were made, which required beforehand {{a review of the}} state of the art in this domain. Aiming at this objective, in this review we consider themost interesting publications since 2000. In essence, both a rapid approach with mainly immunoassays and chromatographic methods were developed. To date, the obstacle to routine use of the first approach has been its inability to detect more than two compounds simultaneously, but recent developments in flow cytometry have made it possible to detect six <b>coccidiostats</b> at once.
