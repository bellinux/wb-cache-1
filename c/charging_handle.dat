40|$|This paper {{presents}} and discusses the cryogenic temperature (77 K) measurement {{results of a}} digital readout integrated circuit (DROIC) for a 32 x 32 long wavelength infrared pixel sensor array designed in 90 nm CMOS process. The chip achieves a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of 58 dB with a <b>charge</b> <b>handling</b> capacity of 2. 03 Ge- at cryogenic temperature with 1. 3 mW of power dissipation. The performance of the readout is {{discussed in terms of}} power dissipation, <b>charge</b> <b>handling</b> capacity and SNR considering the fact that the process library models are not optimized for cryogenic temperature operation of the Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor (MOS) devices.

40|$|Read out {{integrated}} circuit (ROIC) design for quantum dot infrared photodetector (QDIP) array requires large <b>charge</b> <b>handling</b> capacity, low readout noise, minimum detector bias voltage variations, and minimum power dissipation. ROIC design for such applications is challenging due to complex requirements and often needs iterative fabrications {{to meet all}} requirements. In this letter, we propose a decision matrix-based optimization method for large dynamic range ROIC implementation. The optimization method is based on trade off analysis, design, and simulation of identified ROIC parameters. This methodology {{has been applied to}} an actual case, and the optimum ROIC topology was selected using the optimization method described in this letter. The critical specifications are <b>charge</b> <b>handling</b> capacity of greater than 5 Me and low readout noise of less than 600 electrons, in 180 -nm CMOS process. The large dynamic range ROIC consists of a charge integration stage, charge to voltage converters, correlated double samplers, sample and holds, column amplifiers, analog multiplexer, and a buffer amplifier stage. This letter also highlights the measured test chip results of an ROIC array of 30 mu mx 30 mu m pixel size, in which {{we have been able to}} achieve a <b>charge</b> <b>handling</b> capacity of 9. 8 Me and the noise of 350 electrons...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a digital ROIC for staring type arrays with extending counting method to realize very low quantization noise while achieving {{a very high}} <b>charge</b> <b>handling</b> capacity.

Even if the integration capacitance is reduced, it cannot be lower than 1 - 3 fF due to the parasitic capacitance of the comparator. For achieving a very low quantization noise of 161 electrons in a power efficient way, a new method based on measuring the time to measure the remaining charge on the integration capacitor is proposed. With this approach SNR of low flux pixels are significantly increased while large flux pixels can store electrons as high as 2. 33 Ge(-). A prototype array of 32 x 32 pixels with 30 um pitch is implemented in 90 nm CMOS process technology for verification. Measurement results are given for complete readout...|$|R

500|$|The P90 {{is notable}} for being fully ambidextrousâ€”it can be {{operated}} by right or left-handed shooters with equal ease, and without making any {{modifications to the}} weapon. FN Herstal has described it as the [...] "first fully ambidextrous individual automatic weapon." [...] The <b>charging</b> <b>handle,</b> magazine release and backup iron sights are symmetrically distributed {{on both sides of}} the weapon, and the firing selector is located directly at the foot of the trigger, where it can be operated from either side by the shooter's trigger finger or support hand thumb. When fired, the P90 ejects spent cartridge casings downward through a chute located behind the grip, so spent cases are kept out of the shooter's line of sight.|$|E

The air-cooled, gas-operated, magazine-fed assault rifle was made of steel, aluminum alloy and composite plastics, truly cutting-edge for the time. Designed with full and semi-automatic capabilities, the weapon initially did not respond well to wet and dirty conditions, sometimes even jamming in combat. After a few minor modifications, the weapon gained in popularity among troops on the battlefield." ...|$|E
2500|$|The SG 553 is an {{improved}} {{version of the}} SG 552 and was released in 2008. Even though it mostly resembles the SG 552, the SG 553 has one key advantage, the recoil spring is now wrapped around the piston rod like in the SG 550/551 models, which address several reliability issues encountered in the SG 552 and also allows the usage of the standard SG 550/551 <b>charging</b> <b>handle.</b> The SG 553 series rifles have a [...] long sight radius. A long barrel version of the SG 553 known as the SG 553 LB incorporates a [...] barrel with provision to fire rifle grenades and support a bayonet.

2500|$|The AR-15's most {{distinctive}} ergonomic {{feature is the}} carrying handle and rear sight assembly {{on top of the}} receiver. This is a by-product of the original ArmaLite design, where the carry handle served to protect the <b>charging</b> <b>handle.</b> As the line of sight is [...] over the bore, the AR-15 has an inherent parallax problem. At closer ranges (typically inside 15â€“20 meters), the shooter must compensate by aiming high to place shots where desired. The standard AR-15 rifle has a 500mm (19.75inches) sight radius. The AR-15 uses an L-type flip, aperture rear sight and it is adjustable with two settings, 0 to 300 meters and 300 to 400 meters. The front sight is a post adjustable for elevation. The rear sight can be adjusted for windage. The sights can be adjusted with a bullet tip or pointed tool. The AR-15 can also mount a scope on the carrying handle. With the advent of the AR-15A2, a new fully adjustable rear sight was added, allowing the rear sight to be dialed in for specific range settings between 300 and 800 meters and to allow windage adjustments without the need of a tool or cartridge. Current versions such as AR-15A4 use Picatinny rails, which allows the use of various scopes and sighting devices.|$|E

2500|$|The RFB is a {{semi-automatic}} firearm chambered for 7.62Ã—51mm NATO/.308 Winchester ammunition. The RFB uses metric FAL magazines, which insert {{straight into the}} magazine well and {{do not need to}} rock into place. It has a short-stroke gas piston operating system. The rifle uses a patented forward-ejection system via a tube placed over the barrel that ejects the spent case forwards, over the handguard of the rifle. Extraction is accomplished by two extractors, each with two axis of rotation. The extractors may move side-to-side to engage the rim of the case, and pivot upwards to extract the spent case after firing. [...] Empty cases remain in the ejection chute until either the weapon is tilted downwards, the <b>charging</b> <b>handle</b> is operated, or they are pushed out by following cases. Cases drop gently from this chute {{to the left of the}} barrel. To avoid sloppy trigger pull typical of firearms modified into bullpups, the RFB uses a floating linkage bar between the sear and the hammer, allowing the sear to remain above the trigger. The weapon is fully ambidextrous, much in the style of the Belgian F2000 rifle. The RFB is delivered without iron sights. A mil-spec Picatinny rail is provided for mounting a wide range of optics and tactical accessories.|$|E
2500|$|First {{issued in}} 1943, the M1 uses a simple {{blowback}} operation, with the <b>charging</b> <b>handle</b> {{moved to the}} side. The flip-up adjustable Lyman rear sight was replaced with a fixed L sight. Late M1s had triangular guard wings added to the rear L sight, which were standardized on the M1A1. The slots adjoining the magazine well allowing {{the use of a}} drum magazine were removed. A new magazine catch with the provision for retaining drum magazines removed, was produced, but most M1s and later M1A1s retained the original. The less expensive and more-easily manufactured [...] "stick" [...] magazines were used exclusively in the M1, with a new 30-round version joining the familiar 20-round type. The Cutts compensator, barrel cooling fins, and Blish lock were omitted while the buttstock was permanently affixed. Late production M1 stocks were fitted with reinforcing bolts and washers to prevent splitting of the stock where it attached to the receiver. The British had used improvised bolts or wood screws to reinforce M1928 stocks. The M1 reinforcing bolt and washer were carried over to the M1A1 and retrofitted to many of the M1928A1s in U.S. and British service. Late M1s also had simplified fire control switches, also carried over to the M1A1.|$|E
