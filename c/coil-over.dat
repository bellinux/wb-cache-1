25|$|The 20-inch rims on the GT/SC {{are painted}} black and {{are lined with}} Michelin Pilot Supersport rubber. Eibach {{provides}} stiffer <b>coil-over</b> springs {{as well as a}} sway bar kit that should considerably improve the Mustang’s handling credentials standard.|$|E
25|$|The 1984–1987 frames {{will accept}} a 1988 rear cradle. However, the struts must be {{replaced}} with a narrower diameter Carrera <b>coil-over</b> unit with a steel tube extension and offset mounting plates added to replace the Chapman strut unit. Thus yielding a larger, 1984–1987 engine compartment with the ride-quality benefits of the 1988 suspension.|$|E
25|$|Front {{suspension}} was by upper A-arms {{and lower}} lateral links triangulated by the anti-roll bar. Rear suspension was by tapering box-section trailing arms and lower lateral links. The half-shafts had {{no provision for}} plunge and handled some of the lateral forces. There were <b>coil-over</b> shock absorbers and disc brakes at all four corners. Steering was by an unassisted rack and pinion.|$|E
25|$|Touring {{models are}} {{distinguishable}} by their large saddlebags, rear <b>coil-over</b> air suspension {{and are the}} only models to offer full fairings with radios and CBs. All touring models use the same frame, first introduced with a Shovelhead motor in 1980, and carried forward with only modest upgrades until 2009, when it was extensively redesigned. The frame is distinguished by {{the location of the}} steering head in front of the forks and was the first H-D frame to rubber mount the drivetrain to isolate the rider from the vibration of the big V-twin.|$|E
25|$|Dyna-frame {{motorcycles}} {{were developed}} in the 1980s and early 1990s and debuted in the 1991 model year with the FXDB Sturgis offered in limited edition quantities. In 1992 the line continued with the limited edition FXDB Daytona and a production model FXD Super Glide. The new DYNA frame featured big-twin engines and traditional styling. They can be distinguished from the Softail by the traditional <b>coil-over</b> suspension that connects the swingarm to the frame, and from the Sportster by their larger engines. On these models, the transmission also houses the engine's oil reservoir.|$|E
25|$|Sonic Super 4 is a {{race car}} concept that {{demonstrates}} Chevrolet's new small car performance potential, based on Sonic with Ecotec 1.4L turbo engine and six-speed manual transmission. It includes Chevrolet racing graphics, Carbon fiber lower splitter, Carbon fiber rocker panel extensions, Carbon fiber rear diffuser, Tinted headlamps and taillights, Concept Z-Spec high wing rear spoiler, Tow hooks, 18x7.5-inch satin black wheels with street-legal racing tires, SCCA-approved 1¾ -inch chrome moly roll cage, SCCA-approved inner and outer window nets, Z-Spec pedal kit, Racing instrumentation, Racing seat with five-point harness, Fire suppression system, Rearview camera system, Racing steering wheel with quick disconnect, Adjustable <b>coil-over</b> struts and spring kit, four-piston front brake calipers with two-piece drilled rotors, two-piston rear brake calipers with one-piece drilled rotors, Low-restriction air intake and filter, Two-inch cat-back straight-pipe exhaust.|$|E
2500|$|The GTX {{is based}} almost entirely from the Viper, albeit {{with a few}} changes. The exhaust system has been changed into Devon's own {{stainless}} steel variant, a revised intake system, a new one-piece carbon fiber superstructure, carbon fiber body panels, new cast-aluminum unequal-length front and rear suspension wishbones, new <b>coil-over</b> shocks, and StopTech race-inspired aftermarket brakes. The GTX was also intended to produce [...] at 6100 rpm from the Viper-derived 8.4-liter Viper V10.|$|E
2500|$|Built by Los Angeles metalshop, Cartel Customs, and {{displayed}} at 2014 SEMA show, this concept car {{is the first}} targa top version of any 86-based models. Apart from the Porsche 911-style removable roof, it features upgraded and lowered <b>coil-over</b> suspension, 19-in forged chrome wheels, upgrade braking system and a turbocharged engine with a centre exhaust tip. Inside it has an upgraded sound system and two-tone beige/black leather interior (including over the dashboard). The exterior is characterised by enlarged wheelarches and an integrated [...] "duck tail" [...] rear spoiler, and is painted in two-tone Azzurro California Blue with a contrasting black sill line {{up to the roof}} and rear louvre window.|$|E
2500|$|An {{electric}} power steering rack with a 14.3:1 gear ratio is used. The front suspension utilizes a double-wishbone arrangement {{and there is a}} multi-link arrangement at the rear with <b>coil-over</b> dampers at all wheels. The dampers are a monotube design, each with a remote fluid reservoir that includes an expanding and contracting bellows: a purely mechanical system. The LFA further features six-piston front and four-piston rear Brembo monobloc brake calipers with [...] front and [...] rear carbon ceramic discs controlled by Toyota's Electronically Controlled Brake brake-by-wire system. Forged 20-inch BBS wheels fitted with [...] front and [...] rear Bridgestone next-generation Potenza tires are standard. The LFA is equipped with a three-mode Vehicle Dynamics Integrated Management (VDIM) stability control system with Sport setting.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the same}} time in Japan, Toyota {{released}} the 14R-60 model limited to 100 units, inspired by the GT86 TRD Griffon Project of 2013. Its engine power remains the same as the standard models despite featuring various drivetrain changes such as twin central exhausts, a TRD mechanical LSD, a short-shifter, and revised gearing for the six-speed manual transmission. Other changes include extra body reinforcement, a variable-height <b>coil-over</b> spring suspension setup and more rigid suspension bushings. A TRD bodykit with carbonfibre components is complemented by 18inch magnesium wheels and, overall, 14R-60 model results lighter than the base model. Inside there are race-style bucket seats with four-point belts, an Alcantara-clad steering wheel, carbonfibre dashboard trim and yellow piping and highlights. Price-wise, this Japan-only model is listed for , which is significantly higher than the [...] for the base RC model or [...] for the top-of-the-range GT Limited.|$|E
2500|$|In 1983, the GTX {{class of}} the IMSA GT Championship became obsolete, and was {{replaced}} by the IMSA GTP category. As a result, Ford needed a new car, as their Ford Mustang GTX was no longer eligible for competition. Bob Riley was selected to design the car, which, somewhat unusually, was front engined; it used a 2.1-litre turbocharged variant of the Ford Cosworth BDA straight-four engine, capable of producing around [...] Roush Performance and Protofab built the chassis and bodywork, which consisted of carbon fibre panels bonded to a carbon fibre and Nomex composite monocoque chassis, which was reinforced with Kevlar in key areas. The car's aerodynamics were configured to maximize the downforce generated by ground effects, although the suspension was fairly conventional; double wishbones with KONI <b>coil-over</b> springs, and adjustable sway bars {{at both ends of the}} car. Ford's chairman, Philip Caldwell, was positive about the car's development, stating that he felt it was [...] "a clear edge of technological development." [...] The car used a fairly conventional Hewland five-speed manual transmission to transmit the power, and it weighed approximately [...] Three cars were built as part of the program.|$|E

5000|$|... "Bolt-on" [...] {{suspension}} modifications are allowed, {{including most}} <b>coil-over</b> shock-strut systems. Relocation, reinforcement, or custom fabrication of mounting points is not allowed.|$|E
5000|$|Transportation-related struts {{are used}} in [...] "load bearing" [...] {{applications}} ranging from both highway and off-road suspensions to automobile hood and hatch window supports to aircraft wing supports. In vehicle suspension systems, struts are most commonly an assembly of <b>coil-over</b> spring and shock absorber. Other variants to using a <b>coil-over</b> spring as the compressible load bearer include support via pressurized nitrogen gas acting as the spring, and rigid (hard tail) support which provides neither longitudinal compression/extension nor damping.|$|E
50|$|Spec Miatas use a {{specific}} Bilstein shock with an adjustable <b>coil-over</b> suspension with Eibach springs and adjustable {{front and rear}} sway bars, steel braided brake lines.|$|E
50|$|The AP Racing brakes are carbon ceramic discs, {{in which}} are coupled with six-piston {{calipers}} front and rear. The suspension uses a horizontally adjustable <b>coil-over</b> shock setup.|$|E
50|$|Suspension and damping duties {{are handled}} {{by one or}} two shock {{absorbers}} per wheel; usually consisting of one <b>coil-over</b> and one by-pass shock. The trucks are equipped with a steel tube roll cage.|$|E
50|$|Motorcycle shocks do differ {{slightly}} {{in that they}} nearly always use a <b>coil-over</b> spring. In other words, the spring for the rear suspension is a coil spring that is installed over, or around, the shock.|$|E
50|$|Stage Two {{enhancements}} are mechanical. A cold-air intake is fitted {{under the}} hood while a cat-back exhaust replaces the stock setup. Finally, a <b>coil-over</b> suspension implemented at the corners results in a lower ride height and a lower center of gravity.|$|E
5000|$|Produced by Suzuki, it {{was known}} by the {{nickname}} [...] "Suzy" [...] in UK, but in other markets as Youdy. It had a 49 cc two-stroke pivoted engine integral with the transmission, and a <b>coil-over</b> damper mounted to the single-sided swinging arm enclosing the chain final drive.|$|E
50|$|The Europa's four-wheel {{independent}} suspension was also typical Chapman thinking. The front used lightweight pressed steel {{upper and lower}} wishbones with a clever <b>coil-over</b> spring-damper arrangement, all connected to the wheels using off-the-shelf front uprights, ball joints and trunnions.The steering gear was solid-mounted rack and pinion using Truimph Herald components.|$|E

Thus yielding a larger, 1984-1987 engine compartment with the ride-quality benefits of the 1988 suspension.|$|E
50|$|Suspension was {{independent}} {{front and}} rear with <b>coil-over</b> shock absorbers. Brakes were disk front and drum rear. An unusual feature of the rear suspension {{was that it was}} electrically adjustable. Extensive work was done on the type of constant-velocity joint used to provide predictable behaviour but even then Busso felt it was a temporary solution.|$|E
50|$|The basic {{motorcycle}} swingarm is a quadrilateral, {{with one}} short side {{connected to the}} motorcycle's frame with bearings {{so that it can}} pivot. The other short side is the rear axle around which the rear wheel turns. The long sides are connected to the motorcycle's frame or rear sub-frame with one or two shocks with <b>coil-over</b> springs.|$|E
50|$|Front {{suspension}} was by upper A-arms {{and lower}} lateral links triangulated by the anti-roll bar. Rear suspension was by tapering box-section trailing arms and lower lateral links. The half-shafts had {{no provision for}} plunge and handled some of the lateral forces. There were <b>coil-over</b> shock absorbers and disc brakes at all four corners. Steering was by an unassisted rack and pinion.|$|E
50|$|Racing Designs boss, Mark Taylor, {{came up with}} an {{exoskeleton}} car {{featuring a}} space frame chassis with wishbone suspension at each corner and push-rod operated <b>coil-over</b> dampers. Audi's turbocharged 1800cc 4-cylinder engine is mounted longitudinally behind the cockpit to achieve the ultimate in weight distribution. The engine is mated with Audi's 5-speed transaxle gearbox, as used in the Audi A4 and Audi A6.|$|E
50|$|Although {{based on}} the {{two-seater}} vehicle designs, Mondials are slightly larger overall including having appreciably wider front and rear track dimensions. Suspension systems are fully-independent all-round, comprising unequal-length upper and lower wishbones, <b>coil-over</b> damper units and anti-roll bars {{at each end of}} the vehicle. Mondial t vehicles include a driver-adjustable selector to set the electronically controlled damper units, providing three choices of ride-stiffness adjustment.|$|E
