2500|$|The Dan Sandin Image Processor, or [...] "IP," [...] is {{an analog}} video {{processor}} with video signals sent through processing modules that route to an output <b>color</b> <b>encoder.</b> The IP's most unique attribute is its non-commercial philosophy, emphasizing a {{public access to}} processing methods and the machines that assist in generating the images. The IP was Sandin's electronic expression for a culture that would [...] "learn to use High-Tech machines for personal, aesthetic, religious, intuitive, comprehensive, and exploratory growth." [...] This educational goal was supplemented with a [...] "distribution religion" [...] that enabled video artists, and not-for-profit groups, to [...] "roll-your-own" [...] video synthesizer for only the cost of parts and the sweat and labor it took to build it. It was the [...] "Heathkit" [...] of video art tools, with a full building plan spelled out, including electronic schematics and mechanical assembly information. Tips on soldering, procuring electronic parts and Printed Circuit boards, were {{also included in the}} documentation, increasing the chances of successfully building a working version of the video synthesizer.|$|E
50|$|GPU: A {{multiple}} {{graphics processor}} setup. One 16-bit HuC6260 Video <b>Color</b> <b>Encoder</b> (VCE), two 16-bit HuC6270A Video Display Controllers (VDCs), and one HuC6202 Video Priority Controller. The HuC6270A featured Port-based I/O {{similar to the}} TMS99xx VDP family.|$|E
50|$|The TurboGrafx-16 has an 8-bit CPU, a 16-bit video <b>color</b> <b>encoder,</b> and a 16-bit {{video display}} controller. The GPUs {{are capable of}} {{displaying}} 482 colors simultaneously, out of 512. With dimensions of just 14 cm×14 cm×3.8 cm (5.5 in×5.5 in×1.5 in), the Japanese PC Engine is the smallest major home game console ever made. Games were stored on a HuCard cartridge, or in CD-ROM optical format with the TurboGrafx-CD add-on.|$|E
40|$|Human {{vision is}} an {{important}} factor in the areas of image processing. Research has been done for years to make automatic image processing but still human intervention can not be denied and thus better human intervention is necessary. Two most important points are required to improve human vision which are light and <b>color.</b> Gamma <b>encoder</b> is the one which helps to improve the properties of human vision and thus to maintain visual quality gamma encoding is necessary. It is to mention that all through the computer graphics RGB (Red, Green, and Blue) color space is vastly used. Moreover, for computer graphics RGB color space is called the most established choice to acquire desired color. RGB color space has a great effort on simplifying the design and architecture of a system. However, RGB struggles to deal efficiently for the images those belong to the real-world. Images are captured using cameras, videos and other devices using different magnifications. In most cases during processing, in compare to the original outlook the images appear either dark or bright in contrast. Human vision affects and thus poor quality image analysis may occur. Consequently this poor manual image analysis may have huge difference from the computationa...|$|R
50|$|QuickTime Animation uses run-length {{encoding}} and conditional replenishment for compression. When encoding, {{the input}} frame is scanned pixel-wise in raster-scan order and processed line-wise. Within a line, pixels are segmented into runs, {{the length of}} which is variable and signaled in the bitstream. For each run, one of three coding modes is used: same color, skip, or PCM. In same color mode, a run of pixels is represented by a single color in a run-length encoding fashion. If pixels with different colors are joined into a run (of a single <b>color)</b> by the <b>encoder,</b> the coding process is lossy, otherwise it is lossless. The lossless mode is used at the 100% quality level. In skip mode, the run of pixels is left unchanged from the previous frame (conditional replenishment). In PCM mode, the color of each pixel is written to the bitstream, without any compression.|$|R
50|$|The console's CPU is a Hudson Soft HuC6280 8-bit {{microprocessor}} {{operating at}} 1.79 MHz and 7.16 MHz. It features integrated bank-switching hardware (driving a 21-bit {{external address bus}} from a 6502-compatible 16-bit address bus), an integrated general-purpose I/O port, a timer, block transfer instructions, and dedicated move instructions for communicating with the HuC6270A VDC. Its 16-bit graphics processor and video <b>color</b> <b>encoder</b> chip were also developed by Hudson Soft. It holds 8 kB of work RAM and 64 kB of video RAM.|$|E
50|$|Physically, an Image Processor {{system would}} be built out of modules. Several types of modules were defined and {{typically}} would be an aluminum box containing a circuit board inside, video connectors and knobs on front of box and power connector on back of box. The modules would be organized in rows. Individual systems could vary in size and increase in power {{with the addition of}} more modules. Typical modules would be signal sources, combiners and modifiers, effects modules, sync, <b>color</b> <b>encoder,</b> color decoder, and NTSC video interface.|$|E

40|$|An {{apparatus}} and method for comparing internal voltage potentials of {{first and second}} operating electronic components such as large scale integrated circuits (LSI's) in which voltage differentials are visually identified via an appropriate display means are described. More particularly, {{in a first embodiment}} of the invention a first and second scanning electron microscope (SEM) are configured to scan a first and second operating electronic component respectively. The scan pattern of the second SEM is synchronized to that of the first SEM so that both simultaneously scan corresponding portions of the two operating electronic components. Video signals from each SEM corresponding to secondary electron signals generated {{as a result of a}} primary electron beam intersecting each operating electronic component in accordance with a predetermined scan pattern are provided to a video mixer and <b>color</b> <b>encoder...</b>|$|E
