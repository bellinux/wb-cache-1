We show that mice lacking the chemokine Ccl 5 are immune compromised {{to the point}} of delayed viral clearance, excessive airway inflammation and respiratory death after mouse parainfluenza or human influenza virus infection. Virus-inducible levels of Ccl 5 are required to prevent apoptosis of virus-infected mouse macrophages in vivo and mouse and human macrophages ex vivo. The protective effect of Ccl 5 requires activation of the Ccr 5 chemokine receptor and consequent bilateral activation of G(alphai) -PI 3 K-AKT and G(alphai) -MEK-ERK signaling pathways. The antiapoptotic action of chemokine signaling may therefore allow scavengers to finally stop the host cell-to-cell infectious process...|$|R

Some engines instead used a final pinion on a helical spline, similar to that later used for the starters of internal combustion engines: once the main engine started, the pinion would be thrown out of engagement axially along this spline as the flywheel over-speeded the pinion relative to the shaft.|$|R

40|$|Jean-François Parot s {{series of}} crime thrillers {{is set in}} the French capital, {{in the second half of}} the eighteenth century. Although the author is a {{historian}} by training, his writing consists of novels; hence the questionability of his representation s authenticity. The thesis addresses this question through the extensive use of written testimonies from that era, along with references to the works of historians specializing in that period. This process revealed that the novels were based on exceptionally varied and abundant documentation. Because he plays with intertextuality, the author is able to render a very faithful image of Paris during the Enlightenment, going as far as making heard the very words of its inhabitants. Both a magnet and an object of repulsion, the French capital, in this series, perfectly mirrors the way it was perceived in the eighteenth century. However, even though the smallest details usually prove authentic, Jean-François Parot s work often mingles historical reality with fiction. Using the codes of the fictional genres to which it belongs, his writing immerses the reader in a constant flux between the real and the fictional. Moreover, as it was written in the twenty first century, it <b>cannot</b> <b>avoid</b> <b>its</b> contemporary, i. e. postmodern, context, and it consequently betrays a perception of the city fraught with present-day concerns.

In this work, immunopathological changes induced by L. shawl in chronically infected BALB/c mice were investigated. Infected BALB/c mice developed increased lesion size associated with strong inflammatory infiltrate diffusely {{distributed in the}} dermis, with highly infected macrophages. The humoral immune response was predominantly directed toward the IgG 1 isotype. The functional activity of CD 4 (+) and CD 8 (+) T cells showed significantly increased TNF-alpha mRNA levels associated with reduced IFN-gamma expression by CD 4 (+) T cells and the double negative (dn) CD 4 CD 8 cell subset. High IL- 4 levels expressed by CD 8 (+) T cells and dnCD 4 CD 8 and TGF-beta by CD 4 (+) and CD 8 (+) T cells were detected, while IL- 10 was highly expressed by all three cell subpopulations. Taken together, these results show an evident imbalance between TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma that is unfavorable to amastigote replication control.

Though the effects in Norway were at first mixed, as the so-called “golden skirt” problem resulted in only a few women occupying multiple board seats, several European countries followed Norway’s footsteps and mandated some form of gender quotas on corporate boards. France passed the quota law of 2011 to increase women representation at the highest corporate level in the country’s largest firms. In this article, I examine the early effects of the quota. By examining board members of firms that were affected by the law (those in the CAC 40 Index) and comparing them to the slightly smaller public firms (the CAC Next 20), I find that France has thus far <b>avoided</b> <b>its</b> <b>own</b> ‘golden skirt’ situation: the 2011 law has resulted in {{a significant increase in the}} total number of women who hold corporate board seats.

40|$|Hypoxia {{can have}} {{profound}} effects on individual organisms. This chapter {{focuses on the}} mechanisms different kinds of animals possess to avoid, tolerate, and adapt to low levels of oxygen in water; selected examples illustrate these mechanisms. While some organisms can detect and avoid hypoxic water, avoidance is not always possible, {{especially in the case}} of sessile organisms. When an organism <b>cannot</b> <b>avoid</b> hypoxia, <b>its</b> response may depend on the intensity and thz duration of the bout of low oxygen. Examples of responses to hypoxia include a depression in feeding as well as a decrease in molting and growth rates. During acute exposures to hypoxia some organisms can maintain aerobic metabolism by making effective use of a respiratory pigment, or increasing ventilation rates, or increasing the flow of blood past the respiratory surfaces or combinations of all three. Responses to chronic hypoxia are different and include the production of greater quantities of respiratory pigment and changing the structure of the pigment to one with an adaptive higher oxygen affinity. Many organisms respond to hypoxia by switching fiom aerobic to anaerobic metabolism and some simply reduce their overall metabolism. Hypoxia is often accompanied by hypercapnia (an elevation in water C 02), which produces an acidification of the body tissues, including the blood, and has physiological implications that can also be profound and separate from the effects of low oxygen. Finally, there is evidence that hypoxia can inhibit immune responses, causing greater mortality than would otherwise occur when organisms are challenged with a pathogen...|$|R

40|$|The end of {{apartheid}} presents South Africa {{with an opportunity}} to realise its full potential as an important member of the global political economy. This follows a period of three decades of progressive isolation from the global community. The major external challenge facing South Africa now is that the world it is trying to integrate with is much changed from the one it was previously part of. It is of vital importance that as an emerging nation it fully appreciates the nature of this changed world. The global political economy has changed rapidly over the past decade. Mikhail Gorbachev became General Secretary of the Soviet Communist Party and after 1985 he gradually introduced the process of reconstructing the Soviet economy, known as perestroika. This, together with glasnost, began a process of rapid change culminating in the collapse of communism throughout Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union and an end to the Cold War. Thus, western ideas of democracy became dominant and democratic regimes (although not necessarily liberal democratic) became the world's dominant form. Economically, the most important global trend has been that of liberalisation together with what the literature calls globalisation. Rapid advances in transport and communications technology, combined with the trend towards market deregulation have lowered the barriers between national markets; technology and skills, rather than natural resources and cheap labour have become the crucial enabling factors for competing in the global economy. This thesis contends that such a background gives South Africa little choice but to integrate into the global system if it is to secure the best conditions for its economic, social and political development. It also argues, that as a middle-income developing country or economy in transition, the parameters within which it can achieve this integration are fairly narrowly defined. South Africa is quite unique in the nature of its structural problems due to the legacy {{of apartheid}}. It remains a deeply divided society with great extremes of wealth and poverty. Its economy has a dualistic nature with a formal industrial sector and a large underdeveloped informal sector. To compete in the global marketplace South Africa must be able to attract additional production factors and resources from outside. Due to the high levels of protectionism inherited from the apartheid era {{there is a need for}} a reorientation of South Africa's trade policy. Relations with its principal trading partner, the European Union, will be crucially important here. Finally, South Africa <b>cannot</b> <b>avoid</b> <b>its</b> geographical location in Africa. An underdeveloped and politically unstable Southern Africa would greatly reduce South Africa's chances of successful global integration. In contrast a stable, more integrated region, would be to the benefit of South Africa, not least in creating a regional bloc able to exert greater leverage at a global level. However, given that regionalisation may not be wholly compatible with greater global integration, at least in the short to medium term, South Africa faces some difficult policy choices ahead...|$|R

Note that our simulation results demonstrate that DOMCT operates well even without ACK serializing, since ACKs are typically transmitted at the basic data rate and the frame length is relatively short. Another possible solution is the piggybacking of SINR reports in the data frames to reduce the adverse effects of ACK collision. Besides ACK collisions, data and ACK frames can collide also.

40|$|Conditioned place {{preference}} (CPP) is {{a classical}} conditioning paradigm {{used to evaluate}} the rewarding or aversive properties of a stimulus. A stimulus can be an audio, visual, or sensory prompt but can also be stimuli associated with behaviors. Environments associated with sexual and aggressive encounters can become rewarding to both male and female Syrian hamsters regardless of social status. However, we have observed that individually-housed, non-aggressive hamsters find social interaction without aggression or sexual behaviors rewarding. Therefore, we expanded upon our previous experiments using CPP to test the hypothesis that group-housed, male hamsters (n= 12) can develop a preference for a negative social experience such as social defeat. The CPP paradigm consisted of an initial preference test (15 min X 2), a conditioning phase (10 min X 5 days), and a final preference test (15 min). The hamster was placed into a CPP apparatus containing two main testing chambers, black and white, connected by a neutral, clear chamber. The pretest was conducted to establish a baseline for comparison to the posttest to determine changes in {{the amount of time spent}} in either (black/white) chamber. An individually-housed male (n= 11) was paired with a group-housed male in their non-preferred chamber for conditioning. The order of placement in the chambers was alternated daily. Control animals (n= 5) were used to evaluate effects of habituation across conditioning trials. The result of our experiment showed that group- housed animals developed a CPP for social defeat. We observed that the preference scores increased from 0. 34 (± 0. 01) to 0. 41 (± 0. 04), p =. 08 and the difference scores decreased from 243. 67 (± 21. 72) to 171. 25 (± 60. 34), p 3 ̆c. 05. There were no significant differences between pretest and posttest scores for controls for both preference scores and for difference scores from pretest to posttest. The results of this experiment suggest that that our subjects developed a CPP for social defeat and that their response may have been influenced by the type of social defeat. We believe that an escapable defeat with different aggressors’ parings, as was conducted in our experiment, produced social interaction with novelty but with lower stress levels, leading the animals to develop a CPP for social defeat. The hamster’s reactions to the experiment conducted suggest that their response may have been influenced by the type of social defeat that was experienced. There are two types of social defeat models: inescapable and escapable. An inescapable defeat implies that an animal <b>cannot</b> <b>avoid</b> <b>its</b> aggressor whereas an escapable defeat implies that the animal can. Animals exposed to an inescapable defeat have been found to produce generalized aversion and avoidance towards not only a familiar aggressor but a novel, non-aggressive aggressor with the avoidance greater with the familiar aggressor than the unfamiliar; whereas, animals exposed to an escapable defeat only produce avoidance towards its previous aggressor. However, our previous and current research indicates that all Syrian hamsters regardless of social (aggressive/submissive) and housing (group/individual) status all formed a CPP for social behavior, albeit social aggression or social defeat. Our CPP experiment paradigm, similar to that of an inescapable defeat model in that the animal can <b>avoid</b> <b>its</b> aggressors, perhaps produced a positive CPP for social defeat because the hamsters found the controllability of the defeat with novel aggressors across the conditioning trials to be stimulating. While, the hamsters displayed a CPP for social defeat they were not completely resilient and demonstrated higher vigilance to their surroundings as evidenced by the increased duration in the neutral chamber following social defeat. The hamsters’ behaviors suggest that the conducted experiment produced a combination of mild social defeat with novel interactions that produced less aversion and perhaps lower generalized anxiety which was sufficient to develop a CPP for social defeat...|$|R

It then compares this case to German theories of law to determine points at which the work is in dialogue with pressing questions of justice particular to its legal epoch: Der Fall Maurizius (1928) builds a case against the state by juxtaposing positivist and natural law, yet ultimately <b>cannot</b> <b>avoid</b> the axiomatic nature of each position; Das Beil von Wandsbek (1938 - 43) is a Marxist morality play whose concept of justice proves insufficient to <b>its</b> <b>own</b> implied standards; Maria Morzeck oder Das Kaninchen bin ich (1969) engages the GDR's 1961 law reform directly, yet in its development from GDR film to FRG novel softens its critique of the state by thematizing <b>its</b> <b>own</b> literary limitations; and Leben bis Männer (2001) argues against Germany's post-reunification trials of former GDR border guards, but exposes <b>its</b> <b>own</b> plea for a sympathetic view of the GDR.
