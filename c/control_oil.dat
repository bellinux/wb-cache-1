5|$|The next day, American forces {{advanced}} to Kirkuk during Operation Option North, hoping to <b>control</b> <b>oil</b> fields and military airfields {{in and around}} the city. Controlling the oil fields had been a specific operational goal of the Task Force because they were viewed as the most valuable strategic asset in northern Iraq. Between 30 March and 2 April, the 173d Airborne Brigade, along with the Special Forces detachment and the Kurdish forces, engaged and destroyed the 2nd, 4th, 8th and 38th Iraqi Infantry divisions as well as a force loyal to Ansar al-Islam. The brigade used field artillery assets, as well as coordinated airstrikes to attack Iraqi Republican Guard units defending the city. Within a week these units began to fall apart due to desertions. On 10 April the brigade was able to move into the city, securing it after a short urban battle. The entire battle for Kirkuk cost the brigade only nine casualties. During the operation, some of the troops discovered at least two caches of Iraqi gold, totaling more than 2,000 bars. The unit then took part in Operation Peninsula Strike, quelling Ba'ath party resistance and other insurgent groups. These operations, though successful, would have been more effective if the 4th Infantry Division's four heavy brigades were able to enter Iraq through Turkey as originally planned. 4th ID had to relocate their forces from Turkey to Kuwait and were subsequently slowed down in Baghdad. VCorps was not able to surround Baghdad as quickly as it had hoped {{because of a lack of}} available forces in the north. The resulting wear and tear of 4th ID's M1 Abrams and M2 Bradleys made them an ineffective unit in tight urban areas such as Jar Salah. Because their heavily armored tanks required so much maintenance, the 173d incorporated much of 4th ID's area of operation into their own. The 173d secured these areas with company sized detachments, often patrolling the 4th ID's sectors with two unarmored M998 cargo Humvees at any given time.|$|E

Castrated males were injected with either a <b>control</b> (<b>oil)</b> or estradiol in the oil vehicle. As expected, urinary androgens in the castrated males were below normal levels. Additionally, castration by itself rid the males of the capacity to induce growth of the uterus in prepubescent females or to disrupt implantation of the blastocyst in females {{that had previously been}} inseminated. However, when resupplied with estradiol, the castrated males regained the ability to induce uterine growth or halt blastocyst implantation. These studies further support estradiol’s role in mediating the Vandenbergh effect (as well as the Bruce effect).|$|E
50|$|Most {{automotive}} pistons {{have three}} rings: The top two while also <b>controlling</b> <b>oil</b> are primarily for compression sealing (compression rings); the lower ring is for controlling {{the supply of}} oil to the liner which lubricates the piston skirt and the compression rings (<b>oil</b> <b>control</b> rings). At least two piston rings are found on most piston and cylinder combination. Typical compression ring designs will have an essentially rectangular cross section or a keystone (right angled trapezoidal) cross section. The periphery will then have either a barrel profile (top compression rings) or a taper napier form (second compression rings or scraper rings). There are some taper faced top rings and on some old engines simple plain faced rings were used.|$|R
30|$|Located in {{the middle}} of the Tarim Basin, Tazhong is a typical area of {{compound}} reservoirs rich in oil and gas found in the Carboniferous, Silurian and Ordovician strata. The proved, probable and possible reserves (3 P reserves) in the area amount to 5 × 108 tons, so it is of great significance to study the advances and problems in hydrocarbon exploration in the Tazhong area. On the basis of exploration history and analysis of scientific problems, we outline eight achievements: distribution characteristics of reservoirs, stages of reservoir formation, different sources of oil and gas and their respective contributions, the effective regional caprock and reservoir-caprock combinations dominating the vertical distribution of hydrocarbon reservoirs, the control of the Tazhong Palaeo-uplift on reservoir formation and establishing geologic models, structure balance belts influencing the reconstruction and residual potential of reservoirs after accumulation, the rules and mechanisms of fractures <b>controlling</b> <b>oil</b> and gas, and the types of favorable reservoirs and their characteristics of <b>controlling</b> <b>oil</b> and gas distribution. We further point out the main problems about the oil and gas exploration in the Tazhong area and put forward some relevant proposals.|$|R

50|$|The {{history of}} Iran’s oil {{industry}} began in 1901, when British speculator William D’Arcy received a concession from Iran {{to explore and}} develop southern Iran’s oil resources. The discovery of oil in 1908 {{led to the formation}} in 1909 of the London-based Anglo-Persian Oil Company (APOC). By purchasing a majority of the company’s shares in 1914, the British government gained direct control of the Iranian oil industry, which it would not relinquish for 37 years. After 1935 the APOC was called the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company (AIOC). A 60-year agreement signed in 1933 established a flat payment to Iran of four British pounds for every ton of crude oil exported and denied Iran any right to <b>control</b> <b>oil</b> exports.|$|E

5000|$|The {{nationalization}} of oil supplies {{refers to the}} process of confiscation of oil production operations and private property, generally in the purpose of obtaining more revenue from oil for oil-producing countries' governments. This process, which {{should not be confused with}} restrictions on crude oil exports, represents a significant turning point in the development of oil policy. Nationalization eliminates private business operations—in which private international companies <b>control</b> <b>oil</b> resources within oil-producing countries—and allows oil-producing countries to gain control of private property. Once these countries become the sole owners of these confiscated resources in violation of contract law, they have to decide how to maximize the net present value of their known stock of oil in the ground.Several key implications can be observed as a result of oil nationalization. [...] "On the home front, national oil companies are often torn between national expectations that they should 'carry the flag' and their own ambitions for commercial success, which might mean a degree of emancipation from the confines of a national agenda." ...|$|E
