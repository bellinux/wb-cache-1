5|$|Hesketh-Fleetwood {{moved to}} London with Virginie {{and their son}} Louis. He rarely visited Lancashire again, and in 1847 he retired from politics. The family spent some time living in Virginie's home <b>country,</b> <b>Spain.</b> In 1861 Hesketh-Fleetwood {{expressed}} an intention to return to politics, but was prevented from doing so by his failing health. He died {{at his home in}} Piccadilly, London on 12 April 1866, following a lengthy illness. He is buried at Kensal Green Cemetery. His son Rev. Peter Louis Hesketh-Fleetwood (1838–1880) succeeded to the baronetcy, which became extinct on his death. What was left of Hesketh-Fleetwood's land in Lancashire was bought by the Fleetwood Estate Company in 1875.|$|E
5|$|That the Sacs and Foxes did {{claim the}} country generally, where this land lies, is not controverted; nor was their claim ceded to the United States till 1824. And {{this raises the}} {{question}} whether, according to Spanish usage, whilst that power governed Louisiana, an existing Indian claim to territory precluded inhabitation and cultivation under a permit to inhabit and cultivate a particular place designated in the permit, and {{which was in the}} Indian <b>country.</b> <b>Spain</b> had no treaties with any of the Indian tribes in Louisiana, fixing limits to their claims, so far as we are informed. The Indians were kept quiet, and at peace with Spanish subjects, by kind treatment and due precautions, which did not allow obtrusion on lands claimed by them, without written permits from the Governor; but that such permits were usual, cannot be doubted.|$|E

500|$|By 1869, Cuban {{nationals}} were in open {{rebellion against}} their mother <b>country</b> <b>Spain,</b> {{due to the}} unpopularity of Spanish rule. American sentiment favored the Cuban rebels and President Grant appeared {{to be on the}} verge of acknowledging Cuban belligerency. Fish, who desired settlement over the Alabama Claims, did not approve of recognizing the Cuban rebels, since Queen Victoria and her government had recognized Confederate belligerency in 1861. Recognizing Cuban belligerency would have jeopardized settlement and arbitration with Great Britain. In February 1870, Senator John Sherman authored a Senate resolution that would have recognized Cuban belligerency. Working behind the scenes Fish counseled Sherman that Cuban recognition would ultimately lead to war with Spain. The resolution went to the House of Representatives and was ready to pass, however, Fish, worked out an agreement with President Grant to send a special message to Congress that urged not to acknowledge the Cuban rebels. On June 13, 1870 the message written by Fish was sent to Congress by the President and Congress, after much debate, decided not to recognize Cuban belligerency. [...] President Grant continued the policy of Cuban belligerent non recognition for the rest of his two administrations. This policy, however, was tested in 1873 with the Virginius Affair.|$|E
