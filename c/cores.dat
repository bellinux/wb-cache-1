5|$|Every planet {{began its}} {{existence}} {{in an entirely}} fluid state; in early formation, the denser, heavier materials sank to the centre, leaving the lighter materials near the surface. Each therefore has a differentiated interior consisting of a dense planetary core surrounded by a mantle that either is or was a fluid. The terrestrial planets are sealed within hard crusts, but in the giant planets the mantle simply blends into the upper cloud layers. The terrestrial planets have <b>cores</b> of elements such as iron and nickel, and mantles of silicates. Jupiter and Saturn {{are believed to have}} <b>cores</b> of rock and metal surrounded by mantles of metallic hydrogen. Uranus and Neptune, which are smaller, have rocky <b>cores</b> surrounded by mantles of water, ammonia, methane and other ices. The fluid action within these planets' <b>cores</b> creates a geodynamo that generates a magnetic field.|$|E

40|$|A {{prototype}} low-force rotary-percussive rock <b>coring</b> {{tool for}} use in acquiring samples for geological surveys in future planetary missions was developed.
