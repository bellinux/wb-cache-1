This is an increase of the percentage of cage free products from 9% of egg purchases and 20% of pork purchases the company made in 2008. The plan should be completed by 2017.|$|E

5|$|Poultry, {{kept for}} their eggs {{and for their}} meat, include chickens, turkeys, geese and ducks. The great {{majority}} of laying birds used for egg production are chickens. Methods for keeping layers range from free-range systems, where the birds can roam as they will but are housed at night for their own protection, through semi-intensive systems where they are housed in barns and have perches, litter and some freedom of movement, to intensive systems where they are kept in <b>cages.</b> The battery <b>cages</b> are arranged in long rows in multiple tiers, with external feeders, drinkers, and egg collection facilities. This is the most labour saving and economical method of egg production but has been criticised on animal welfare grounds as the birds are unable to exhibit their normal behaviours.|$|E

40|$|The {{role of the}} cancer/testis antigen <b>CAGE</b> in drug {{resistance}} was investigated. The drug-resistant human melanoma Malme 3 M (Malme 3 MR) and the human hepatic cancer cell line SNU 387 (SNU 387 R) showed in vivo {{drug resistance}} and <b>CAGE</b> induction. Induction of <b>CAGE</b> resulted from decreased expression and thereby displacement of DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT 1) from <b>CAGE</b> promoter sequences. Various drugs induce expression of <b>CAGE</b> by decreasing expression of DNMT 1, and hypomethylation of <b>CAGE</b> was correlated with the increased expression of <b>CAGE.</b> Down-regulation of <b>CAGE</b> in these cell lines decreased invasion and enhanced drug sensitivity resulting from increased apoptosis. Down-regulation of <b>CAGE</b> also led to decreased anchorage-independent growth. Down-regulation of <b>CAGE</b> led to increased expression of p 53, suggesting that <b>CAGE</b> may act as a negative regulator of p 53. Down-regulation of p 53 enhanced resistance to drugs and prevented drugs from exerting apoptotic effects. In SNU 387 R cells, <b>CAGE</b> induced the interaction between histone deacetylase 2 (HDAC 2) and Snail, which exerted {{a negative effect on}} p 53 expression. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay showed that <b>CAGE,</b> through interaction with HDAC 2, exerted a negative effect on p 53 expression in Malme 3 MR cells. These results suggest that <b>CAGE</b> confers drug resistance by regulating expression of p 53 through HDAC 2. Taken together, these results show the potential value of <b>CAGE</b> as a target for the development of cancer therapeutics...|$|R
