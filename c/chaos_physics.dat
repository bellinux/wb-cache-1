40|$|Stability {{control in}} laser {{is still an}} {{emerging}} field of research. In this paper the dynamics of External cavity semiconductor lasers (ECSLs) is widely studied applying the methods of <b>chaos</b> <b>physics.</b> The stability is analyzed through plotting the Lyapunov exponent spectra, bifurcation diagrams and time series. The oscillation of the electric field E {{has been reported to}} be either periodic (P 1,P 2, [...] ) or chaotic. The results of the study show that the rich nonlinear dynamics of the electric field |E|^ 2 includes saddle node bifurcations, quasi-periodicity and regular pulse packages. The issue of finding the conditions for creating stable domains has been studied. By considering the dynamical pumping current system coupled with laser, a method for the creation of the stable domain has been introduced. Comment: 12 pages, 12 figure...|$|E
30|$|The {{theory of}} {{nonlinear}} integral equations nowadays {{is a large}} topic which is found in many applications of various branches in mathematics and other fields such as biology, engineering, economics, etc. Meanwhile, the fractional order models and the theory of nonlinear fractional differential equations {{are very important to}} study natural problems because the manner of the trajectory of the fractional order derivatives is nonlocal, which describes that the fractional order derivative has memory effect features. So the theory of nonlinear fractional differential equations can be widely applied in many branches such as the optimal control, finance, <b>chaos,</b> <b>physics,</b> etc. For more details, we refer the reader to [9 – 16] and the references therein. Nowadays, many mathematicians proved the existence and uniqueness of a solution of nonlinear fractional differential equations by using the fixed point results (see in [7, 17] and the references therein).|$|E

Cells that we conditionally consider being "close" to each other and that can "interact " during a "time cycle" (a conditional "time unit"), we call "neighbors". The evolution of automaton is generally specified by a local function (a "rule"), that for a cell juxtaposes for every certain set of neighbor's states a strictly specified state of this very cell in the following moment (cy...|$|E

40|$|Nuclear {{reactions}} {{in which the}} incident projectile is absorbed by the target nucleus and y radiation is then emitted are known as radiative capture reactions. As a class, they are important {{in many areas of}} pure and applied physics. Radiative capture reactions can help determine such nuclear features as the spectroscopic properties of nuclear states (1), the collective band structure and origin of enhanced multi pole decays (2), and the modes of nuclear motion (3, 4). Such spectroscopic properties in turn provide information on spectrum fluctuations in nuclei with high-level densities, which are of interest in <b>chaos</b> <b>physics</b> (5). The interaction of atomic and nU(;lear physics can be studied by the energy shift of a nuclear resonance due to K-shell ionization (6). Radiative capture reactions are also useful in measuring the depth profiles of nuclides in materials (7). Condensed matter effects on nuclear resonances can be studied via channeling features (8). The Lewis effect (9) appears to be sensitive to surface features. The capture y-ray flux emitted from the plasma fuel of a fusion reactor can be. used to measure the plasma temperature (10). Finally, the radiative capture reaction {{is one of the most}} important in the formation of various elements in the universe, and thus it is crucial for the field of nuclear astrophysics (11, 12).

Particular {{attention is paid to}} the analysis of atomic spectra by periodic orbit-type theories. For diamagnetic non-hydrogenic Rydberg atoms, the dynamical explanation for observed spectral features has been disputed.

This provides further evidence that non-hydrogenic systems are most naturally described in terms of diffraction rather than classical chaos. 1 Atoms as Laboratories of Quantum <b>Chaos</b> Atomic <b>physics</b> has provided {{some of the most important}} examples of real, experimentally observable, quantum systems for which the underlying classical motion is chaotic.
