40|$|Lead-acid {{batteries}} (LAB) {{are widely}} used in transportation sector for starting, lighting and ignition application. The possibility of vibration mode of failure occurs in this application due to wear and tear of the road. These vibration causes fatigue failure, particularly between the <b>cast</b> <b>on</b> <b>strap</b> and pillar post leading to loss of electrical connection. In this paper vibration test is conducted on a 12 V/ 75 Ah AGM Valve Regulated Lead-Acid Battery (VRLAB) used for above mentioned application in India. The test is carried out using Electrodynamic Vibration System model SD- 10 - 240 /GT 500 M/DA- 10. The shaker is performed with a sinusoidal excitation, with an acceleration of 2. 143 G and a fixed frequency of 16. 7 Hz. The peak to peak displacement is 4 mm. The deformation and crack propagation features {{on the surface and}} cross sectional area of pillar post and strap in both positive and negative group are observed with Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM). The material is yielded due to improper fusion between pillar post and strap which could not stand the vibration force. During vibration this region is vulnerable for fatigue failure...|$|E
