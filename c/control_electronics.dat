5|$|The top ten drivers {{competed for}} pole {{position}} in Q3 {{and it was}} a battle between the two Mercedes. Lewis Hamilton set his fastest time first with Rosberg right behind him. A much better time in the third sector of the track allowed Rosberg to take his sixth consecutive pole position almost four-tenths ahead of his teammate. Sergio Pérez held third spot for much of the session but was beaten to it by Kimi Räikkönen during the second turn of runs. The two were followed by Daniel Ricciardo and Valtteri Bottas on the third row of the grid. Following a gearbox change after qualifying, Romain Grosjean was demoted five places on the grid. Roberto Merhi and Will Stevens also received five place penalties: Stevens for a change of the <b>Control</b> <b>Electronics</b> unit, Merhi for changes made to his suspension. Both would start the race from the back row of the grid.|$|E

25|$|In {{the case}} of a {{switched-mode}} power supply, a boost converter is inserted between the bridge rectifier and the main input capacitors. The boost converter attempts to maintain a constant DC bus voltage on its output while drawing a current that is always in phase with and at the same frequency as the line voltage. Another switched-mode converter inside the power supply produces the desired output voltage from the DC bus. This approach requires additional semiconductor switches and <b>control</b> <b>electronics,</b> but permits cheaper and smaller passive components. It is frequently used in practice.|$|E

The flooded generators failed, cutting power to the critical pumps that must continuously circulate coolant water through a nuclear reactor for several days in order to keep it from melting down after being shut down. As the pumps stopped, the reactors overheated due to the normal high radioactive decay heat produced in the first few days after nuclear reactor shutdown (smaller amounts of this heat normally continue to be released for years, but are not enough to cause fuel melting).|$|E

40|$|Abstract — In this paper, {{we propose}} {{a model of}} {{distributed}} power system with power electronic controlled loads. Distribution networks transport the electrical energy from the transmission substations to the various loads. There are so many power <b>electronics</b> <b>controlled</b> loads that are connected in the distribution power system. Due to intensive use of power <b>electronics</b> <b>controlled</b> loads in an industry and other consumers in general, the harmonics produces a distortion in distribution network. Therefore, to protect the power system from the power <b>electronics</b> <b>controlled</b> loads, {{it is very important}} to identify the types and number of all the working power <b>electronics</b> <b>controlled</b> loads. The result of this paper shows that the method of calculating the number and also the types of all working power <b>electronics</b> <b>controlled</b> loads in any distribution system. A Multiple Signal Classification (MUSIC) Spectrum technique is used to identify the power <b>electronics</b> <b>controlled</b> loads in distribution power system.

2500|$|Each {{thyristor}} valve will typically contain tens or {{hundreds of}} thyristor levels, each operating at a different (high) potential with respect to earth. [...] The command information {{to turn on the}} thyristors therefore cannot simply be sent using a wire connection – it needs to be isolated. [...] The isolation method can be magnetic (using pulse transformers) but is usually optical. [...] Two optical methods are used: [...] indirect and direct optical triggering. [...] In the indirect optical triggering method, the low-voltage <b>control</b> <b>electronics</b> sends light pulses along optical fibres to the high-side <b>control</b> <b>electronics,</b> which derives its power from the voltage across each thyristor. [...] The alternative direct optical triggering method dispenses with most of the high-side electronics, instead using light pulses from the <b>control</b> <b>electronics</b> to switch light-triggered thyristors (LTTs), although a small monitoring electronics unit may still be required for protection of the valve.|$|E

Analog Devices has demonstrated the commercial viability of this integration by interleaving the micromechanical fabrication steps of an accelerometer with the microelectronic fabrication steps of its <b>controlling</b> <b>electronics.</b> Sandia`s Microelectronics Development Laboratory has integrated the micromechanical and microelectronic processing sequences in a segregated fashion. In this CMOS-first, micromechanics-last approach, conventional aluminum metallization is replaced by tungsten metallization to allow CMOS to withstand subsequent high-temperature processing during the micromechanical fabrication. This approach is a further development of an approach originally developed at UC Berkeley. Specifically, the issues of yield, repeatability, and uniformity of the tungsten/CMOS approach are addressed. Also, material {{issues related to the}} development of high-temperature diffusion barriers, adhesion layers, and low-stress films are discussed.
