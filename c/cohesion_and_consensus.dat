Rituals and marital adjustment were defined and their importance in family life outlined. Five research questions guided the study: (1) Is ritual activity associated with marital adjustment and length of courtship for newlyweds?; (2) Is ritual activity associated with marital satisfaction and length of courtship for newlyweds?; (3) Is ritual activity associated with cohesion and length of courtship for newlyweds?; (4) Is ritual activity associated with consensus and length of courtship for newlyweds?; and (5) Is there a difference between husbands and wives on the number and types of rituals (family celebrations, family traditions, and family interactions) that couples report are most related to their overall marital quality? Ritual activity was measured by a new instrument created for the present study: the Ritual Inventory (RI). Marital adjustment and its components (satisfaction, <b>cohesion,</b> <b>and</b> <b>consensus)</b> were measured using the Revised Dyadi c Adjustment Scale (RDAS).

40|$|Public {{confidence}} in policing is receiving increasing attention from UK social scientists and policy-makers. The {{criminal justice system}} relies on legitimacy and consent to an extent unlike other public services: public support is vital if the police and other criminal justice agencies are to function both effectively and in accordance with democratic norms. Yet we know little about the forms of social perception that stand prior to public confidence and police legitimacy. Drawing on data from the 2003 / 2004 British Crime Survey and the 2006 / 2007 London Metropolitan Police Safer Neighbourhoods Survey, this paper suggests that people think about their local police in ways {{less to do with}} the risk of victimization (instrumental concerns about personal safety) and more to do with judgments of social <b>cohesion</b> <b>and</b> moral <b>consensus</b> (expressive concerns about neighbourhood stability, <b>cohesion</b> <b>and</b> loss of collective authority). Across England and Wales the police may not primarily be seen as providers of a narrow sense of personal security, held responsible for crime and safety. Instead the police may stand as symbolic 'moral guardians' of social stability and order, held responsible for community values and informal social controls. We also present evidence that public {{confidence in}} the London Metropolitan Police Service expresses broader social anxieties about long-term social change. We finish our paper with some thoughts on a sociological analysis of the cultural place of policing: confidence (and perhaps ultimately the legitimacy of the police) might just be wrapped up in broader public concerns about social order <b>and</b> moral <b>consensus...</b>|$|R
40|$|Historically human endeavors {{around the}} globe are in search of {{bilateral}} relationships. Knowledge and commerce has played a very significant role in increasing the ability for humans to connect {{for the betterment of}} the human species. As the means of communication improve, mutual benefits to {{the community as a whole}} also increase. Moreover, the benefits are filtered down to members of the overall community. Recent advancement in electronic communication technologies and in knowledge, in particular, physical, chemical, engineering and medical sciences and philosophies, have facilitated nearly instantaneous multi-cultural interactions. Local problems and solutions have become global. This has generated a need for cooperation, coordination, and co-management at local and global levels. This instant communication and easy access to almost all members of the global community, with minimal cost and effort, causes an increase in uncertainty and lack of clarity in communication and misunderstanding between the members of the community. This leads to a fuzzy and stochastic environment. In short, the 21 st century has seen a significant increase in the need to consider all human endeavors as being subject to random environmental fluctuations. More precisely, currently the human species is highly mobile. In this work, an attempt is made (1) to balance communities working cooperatively and cohesively with one another while preserving member ability to retain individuality and fostering an environment of cultural state diversity. We develop (2) constructive analytic algorithms that provide tools to study qualitative and quantitative properties of multicultural diverse dynamic social networks. Under network parametric space/set conditions (3) cohesion and co-existence of members of multicultural dynamic network are insured. The parametric conditions (4) are algebraically simple, easy to verify, and robust. Moreover, the presented study of parametric representations of cohesion, co-existence and consensus attributes and robustness of multicultural dynamic networks provides a quantitative tool for planning, policy and performance of human mobility processes for members of a multicultural dynamic network. We develop and investigate (5) a deterministic dynamic multicultural network. To exhibit the significance of the analysis, ideas, the complexity and limitations, we present a specific prototype model. This serves to establish the framework for finding explicit sufficient conditions in terms of system parameters for studying a complex dynamic network. Further, we decompose the cultural state domain into invariant subsets (6) and consider the behavior of members within each cultural state subset. Moreover, we analyze the relative cultural affinity between individual members relative to the center of the social network. We then (7) outline the general method for investigating a multicultural cultural network. We also demonstrate the degree of conservatism of the estimates using Euler type numerical approximation schemes. We are then able to consider how changes in the various parametric effects are reflected on the dynamics of the network. The deterministic multicultural dynamic model and analysis is extended (8) to a multicultural dynamic network under random environmental perturbations. We present a detailed prototype model for the purpose of investigation. Introducing the concept of stochastic <b>cohesion</b> <b>and</b> <b>consensus</b> in the context of probabilistic modes of convergence (9), the explicit sufficient conditions in terms of system parameters are given to exhibit the cohesive property of the stochastic network. The effects of random fluctuations are characterized. We then extend the stochastic model (10) to a multicultural hybrid stochastic dynamic network model. By considering a hybrid dynamic, we can explore the properties of a multicultural dynamic under the influence of both continuous-time and discrete-time cultural dynamic systems. This model captures external influences and internal changes that may have an impact on the members and system parameters of the dynamic network. We extend the ideas of global <b>cohesion</b> <b>and</b> <b>consensus</b> to local <b>cohesion</b> <b>and</b> <b>consensus</b> (11). Again, the detailed study is focused on a prototype hybrid multicultural dynamic network. Using the ideas and tools developed from the stochastic network (12), we are able to establish conditions on the network parameters for which the cultural network is locally cohesive. Using Euler-Maruyama type numerical approximation schemes to model the network, we better understand to what extent the analytically developed estimates are feasible...|$|E

The {{purpose of this study}} is to examine any possible negative or positive effects smart phone use may have on partner satisfaction and couple-communication within a married/partnered couple. Participants were divided into a control group and an experimental group. The constructs of communication and relationship satisfaction were measured through a repeated-measures design. The Revised Dyadic Adjustment Scale (RDAS) was used to measure relational satisfaction, and the Primary Communication Inventory was used to measure partner communication. Both surveys were administered at the beginning and end of a 2 -week intervention period. Couples in the experimental group turned off their smartphones for 2 hours each day. Five constructs were analyzed: the total score of the PCI and the RDAS, and the RDAS’s 3 internal constructs of <b>cohesion,</b> satisfaction, <b>and</b> <b>consensus.</b> Five mixed-design ANOVAs were run comparing the 2 groups and measuring any change in the 5 domains. All 5 ANOVAs showed no significant change between the 2 groups after the 2 -week intervention. Pearson’s correlations suggested that some factors may be related to relationship satisfaction growth, including number of years married/partnered, partner phone communication frequency, and partner perception of partner’s smartphone use...|$|R

50|$|Intentionality {{concerns}} the text producer's attitude and intentions as the text producer uses <b>cohesion</b> <b>and</b> coherence {{to attain a}} goal specified in a plan. Without <b>cohesion</b> <b>and</b> coherence, intended goals may not be achieved due to a breakdown of communication. However, depending on the conditions and situations in which the text is used, the goal may still be attained even when <b>cohesion</b> <b>and</b> coherence are not upheld.Even though cohesion is not maintained in this example, the text producer still succeeds in achieving the goal of finding out if the text receiver wanted a piggyback.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{outlines}} {{a general}} and practical {{overview of the}} importance of <b>cohesion</b> <b>and</b> coherence in the Text. Text linguistic studies <b>and</b> defines <b>cohesion</b> <b>and</b> coherence as crucial elements for the Text. Without these a Text would suffer for continuity and clarity and can not be called a text. In our everyday life people communicate with each other through different ways. In every speech, every communication we take a message which is given through text. What would happen if {{there is a lack of}} <b>cohesion</b> <b>and</b> coherence? In this paper we will present some different point of views, definitions and research studies of these terms. <b>Cohesion</b> <b>and</b> coherence will be treated from their role in written text. From the practical point of view different Texts are taken as examples to show their importance of understanding on the part of the reader. Frequently foreign language students may face problems of understanding and decoding a text if it is not clear and lacks the accuracy of <b>cohesion</b> <b>and</b> coherence. A foreign language text may have one element but may miss the other one, for this reason it may loose the concept of communication. Apart from a clear understanding of the differences between these two elements Italian students should be provided with text templates to help them write essays, or different types of written text (argumentative, persuasive, informative est.). The article ends with a conclusion and discussion of the role that <b>cohesion</b> <b>and</b> coherence play in texts and research studies on how to deal with <b>cohesion</b> <b>and</b> coherence in writing...|$|R
