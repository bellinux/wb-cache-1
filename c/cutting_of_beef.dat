50|$|Packing {{methods and}} meat grading {{could not be}} {{included}} in the archaeological investigation because samples of meat included in the investigation were highly disturbed, meaning they were not in situ {{at the time of their}} recovery. Conservation restraints made the excavation of intact casks too costly, however, analysis of both beef and pork carcasses artefacts recovered from William Salthouse found that these examples of imported salted meats would be indistinguishable from Australian terrestrial sites in Australia due to commonalities in butchering techniques. Similarities between the butcher marks on both ribs and vertebrae recovered from the wreck and Australian butchered meats from the First Government House make the cuts of meat indistinguishable. This similarity merits further consideration, since the square <b>cutting</b> <b>of</b> <b>beef</b> samples shows a high degree of similarity. Butchering practices are further complicated by factors such as type of carcase, quality, meat bearing capacity, consumer taste, economic climate and the source of trade training. The range of external factors that impact use of meat type require investigations to address the relationship of site occupants to forms of supply, and the butchering mark morphology and frequency.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Consumer {{perception}} of the healthiness <b>of</b> <b>beef</b> is an important determinant <b>of</b> <b>beef</b> consumption. However, {{little is known about}} how consumers perceive the healthiness <b>of</b> <b>beef.</b> The aim <b>of</b> this study is to shed light on the associations between beef and health. Methods Eight focus group discussions were conducted in four European countries (France, UK, Germany, Spain), each consisting of seven to nine participants. A content analysis was performed on the transcripts of these discussions. Results Although beef was generally perceived as healthful, focus group participants expected positive as well as negative effects <b>of</b> <b>beef</b> consumption on their health. Labelled, branded, fresh and lean beef were perceived as signalling healthful beef, in contrast with further processed and packaged beef. Consumers felt that their individual choices could make a difference with respect to the healthiness <b>of</b> <b>beef</b> consumed. Focus group participants were not in favour <b>of</b> improving <b>beef</b> healthiness during processing, but rather focussed on appropriate consumption behaviour and preparation methods. Conclusions The individual responsibility for health implies that consumers should be able to make correct judgements about how healthful their food is. However, {{the results of this study}} indicate that an accurate assessment <b>of</b> <b>beef</b> healthiness is not always straightforward. The presented results on consumer perceptions <b>of</b> <b>beef</b> healthiness provide insights into consumer decision making processes, which are important for the innovation and product differentiation in the European beef sector, as well as for public health policy decisions related to meat consumption in general and beef consumption in particular. </p...|$|R
