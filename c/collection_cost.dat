Unlike most of the previous analyses of optimal inflationary finance, the model postulates that conventional taxes carry <b>collection</b> <b>costs</b> whereas fiat money can be printed costlessly. For some countries, I measure tax <b>collection</b> <b>costs,</b> use the tax evasion estimates reported in the literature, and then calculate the optimal interest rate based on the model. Comparison of the actual and optimal interest rates demonstrates that the model can in fact partly explain the observed deviations from the Friedman Rule.

40|$|We {{address the}} problem of {{designing}} practical, energy-efficient protocols for data collection in wireless sensor networks using predictive modeling. Prior work has suggested several approaches to capture and exploit the rich spatio-temporal correlations prevalent in WSNs during data collection. Although shown to be effective in reducing the data <b>collection</b> <b>cost,</b> those approaches use simplistic corelation models and further, ignore many idiosyncrasies of WSNs, in particular the broadcast nature of communication. Our proposed approach is based on approximating the joint probability distribution over the sensors using undirected graphical models, ideally suited to exploit both the spatial correlations and the broadcast nature of communication. We present algorithms for optimally using such a model for data collection under different communication models, and for identifying an appropriate model to use for a given sensor network.

In order {{to reveal the}} composition of straw storage and transportation costs, this paper took the field survey data from three straw storage enterprises in Jiangsu Province, Yancheng Jianhu, Yangzhou Gaoyou and Wuxi Yixing as the samples, using the activity -based costing method, made the comparative analysis to the storage and transportation costs of wheat and rice straw. The {{results showed that the}} average storage and transportation costs of these three were 148. 5 yuan&# 183;t - 1 for the wheat and 116. 8 yuan&# 183;t - 1 for rice, the cost of wheat straw was higher than that of rice straw. In the storage and transportation cost of wheat, field <b>collection</b> <b>cost</b> took 52 %, transportation cost took 21 % and storage cost took 27 % while the percentages were 48 %, 21 % and 31 % respectively for rice. So the field <b>collection</b> <b>cost</b> was the highest, followed by the storage cost and the transportation cost. According to the cost analysis, it was concluded that the mechanized bundling and loading operation under the condition of the straw field collection operation would greatly reduce the <b>collection</b> <b>cost</b> and improve the collection efficiency. In the process of transportation, it was more cost-effective to use high-capacity truck than farm tractor, and to save the cost of vehicle purchase than renting. In storage operation, low-cost land should be selected; on the other hand, the flow rate of straw preprocessing should be increased to reduce the straw loss of storage.

Empirical analysis, using data collected in Reading, England, is used to verify the analytic relationships and to assess the benefits of multiday samples in a particular context. ...|$|E

However, factors that influence the feasibility of implementing conservation actions, such as the history of landscape management, and landholders 2 ̆ 7 willingness to engage are often difficult or time consuming to quantify and rarely incorporated into planning.

To test the utility of our best-supported model, we developed 4 alternative investment scenarios based on different input data for conservation planning: social data only; biological data only; potential conservation opportunity derived from modeled feasibility that incurs no social data collection costs; and existing conservation opportunity derived from feasibility data that incurred <b>collection</b> <b>costs.</b> Using spatially explicit information on biodiversity values, feasibility, and management costs, we prioritized locations in southwest Australia to control an invasive predator that is detrimental to both agriculture and natural ecosystems: the red fox (Vulpes vulpes).

However, the neighboring jurisdiction can set policy in response. This establishes the potential for a classical prisoner’s dilemma consideration: in this case to tax (cooperate) or to toll (defect).
