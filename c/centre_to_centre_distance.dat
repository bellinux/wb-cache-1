Of these colonies 468 (49 %) were massive corals and 487 (51 %) were nonmassives.

Twenty of these species were represented by fewer than {{the mean number of}} 13 colonies and 44 % of all colonies of the massive corals present belonged to the species Favites abdita, Montastrea curta and Montastrea annuligera. Although the colonies of massive corals rarely exceeded 50 cm in diameter, they fell into a wide range of sizes. However, the majority of colonies of most species had diameters > 10 cm. Mean annual growth rates varied among species and among colonies of the same species but for most colonies was ≤ 05 cm in diameter yr. The total number of colonies of massive corals (excluding colonies of the genus Porites) increased from 382 to 418 from November 1991 to November 1994, with settlement slightly in excess of mortality each year. However, the total area occupied by massive corals remained essentially constant during this period.

40|$|Anti-collision {{calculations}} {{are done}} during the planning of a new petroleum well. These calculations are {{required in order to}} control the risk of having a well-collision, which is an unwanted event at any cost. The risk of having a well-collision is closely related to the position uncertainty both of the well that is planned and of the existing wells in the given region. Earlier literature has indicated that the distribution of the position errors are more heavy-tailed than a normal distribution, which leads to the question whether the current methods are accurate enough. The currently used industry standard calculates the standard deviation of the <b>centre</b> <b>to</b> <b>centre</b> <b>distance</b> by an approximation, and assumes that the <b>centre</b> <b>to</b> <b>centre</b> <b>distance</b> is normally distributed. In this thesis we use a heavy-tailed Normal Inverse Gaussian (NIG) distribution for the declination error source in MWD magnetic directional surveying, which lead to a position uncertainty that is heavy-tailed relative to the multivariate normal distribution. The parameters of the NIG-distribution are estimated from processed magnetic field data from the Tromsø geomagnetic observation station. The NIG-distribution requires the use of Monte Carlo simulations in order to apply the currently used industry approach. Other error sources are also included in the error model to give a more realistic position uncertainty. Three different anti-collision cases demonstrate the differences in using the NIG error model and the normal error model. We compare the simulation based results against the currently used methodology. The results are very dependent on the well geometries. The results differ significantly, and the NIG error model is the most conservative distribution in most cases, with respect to whether a wellplan should be realized or not. However, there are cases where a normally distributed declination error gives more conservative decisions than the NIG-distribution. As an alternative to change the distribution of the declination error, we propose two corrective actions to improve the existing anti-collision methodology. One action is to exchange one of the approximations in the current methodology with simulations or analytical computations. The other action is to correct for bias in the expected position, which is caused by the NIG error model. </p...|$|E
40|$|The work in {{this thesis}} is {{motivated}} by a need to improve non- destructive testing (NDT) techniques as petrochemical production moves towards harsher environments, with increasing presence of CO 2 and/or H 2 S in the production lines, which in turn lead to an increasing risk of shutdown due to localised corrosion. From a practical NDT point of view, the maximum corrosion depth within the area inspected {{is the most important}} parameter to quantify accurately. However, localised corrosion exhibits a large scatter in shape and growth rate, making it insidious and difficult to detect and size in practice. Initially, relatively simple shaped defects such as infinite notches and single through-thickness holes in plates are considered, comparing the reflection and scattering from them with available results from the literature for validation, before attention is given to more complex defects in pipes, with the fundamental torsional guided wave, T(0, 1), incident. Firstly, a parametric study of the reflection from two and three small circular holes is presented. FE analyses estimating the reflection coefficients (RC) for both part- and through thickness holes at different relative positions are presented, and the validity limits of employing the superposition technique in doing so assessed. Results show that the RC for the T(0, 1) mode is dependent on absolute frequency and axial separation, and independent of circumferential position of the holes. Employing superposition is found to be valid down <b>to</b> defect <b>centre</b> <b>to</b> <b>centre</b> separation <b>distances</b> of two diameters in the worst case, with improved validity with shallower defects. Then the reflection of the T(0, 1) mode from a large number of pit clusters consisting of a random number of pits that have developed randomly in size and depth following certain growth rules is investigated, assessing the relationship between maximum pit depth and maximum RC. Problematic cases where low maximum RCs are obtained from pit clusters with deep maximum pit depth are investigated in detail. Results show that the majority of such clusters consist of a single small and deep pit, with otherwise shallow attack only; such corrosion morphologies are unlikely to occur in practice. With more realistic pit cluster morphologies, where the pit clusters are part of a larger, wider corrosion attack, fewer cases with deep maximum pit depth result in a low maximum RC. A 2 D FFT approach is used to further assess the problematic features identified by studying the relationship between the spatial frequencies of corrosion patches and their RC spectra. Results indicate that sharp changes in depth result in significant reflections at high frequencies, and only to a minor extent affect RCs at lower frequencies. A subsequent analysis of whether pit clusters with sharp sided pits can be represented as a single, complex defect showed {{that it is not a}} valid approximation; as a consequence of the poor agreement found, the maximum depth of the problematic corrosion profiles cannot be well estimated without consideration of the high spatial frequency content of the corrosion profiles.    PhD i elektronikk og telekommunikasjonPhD in Electronics and Telecommunicatio...|$|R
40|$|The {{construction}} of the new airport of Mexico City (NAICM) is challenging, as the subsoil at the site is very weak. The airport, which is under construction at the moment, is located on top of thick layers of Mexico Clay soils. These clayey layers consist of a mixture of both clay particles and pyroclastic volcanic materials. These unique soils are characterised by a high water content and compressibility. Upon loading, the soft soils will settle {{as a result of}} the consolidation process. This consolidation is defined as the dissipation of excess pore water as a result of an increase in stress. The rate of consolidation is governed by the hydraulic conductivity of the soil, which is in general very low in soft soils, and the drainage path. In order to speed up this time consuming process, vertical permeable elements can be installed in the soil. Upon installation of these elements, a reduction in drainage path is realised. This reduction in drainage path allows faster dissipation of excess pore water pressure, hence reducing the consolidation time. Due to the conditions at the site, the design of the runways is challenging. The differential- and residual settlements need to be within strict boundaries in order to keep the runways operational. Prior to the design of the runways, trial embankments have been constructed in order to measure the performance of different soil improvement techniques at this specific site. Based upon this field test results, prefabricated vertical drains (PVDs) were selected as the most efficient soil improvement technique. Besides the PVD trial, the sandpile trial also showed promising results. The PVDs and sandpiles both decrease the drainage path length inside the soft soil layers. The main difference is the relative high stiffness of the sandpiles, the stiffness of the PVDs is negligible. By installing stiff elements in the soft soil, the loads applied on the top of the soils are transferred to deeper and stiffer soils. Hence, the total settlements of the top soft soil layers are reduced. The sandpiles could therefore be feasible alternative to PVDs, applied at locations in which the total settlement needs to be limited. The investigation into the behaviour of sandpiles in Mexico Clay soils is performed in multiple stages. First, analytical models are used for gaining knowledge about the expected sandpile behaviour. In the second stage the FEM software Plaxis 2 D is used for the numerical modelling of the sandpiles, using an axisymmetric model setup. The model is constructed in multiple steps, with increasing complexity. The first models simulate the material behaviour with the Mohr-Coulomb model, in the advanced models the Soft Soil Creep and Hardening Soil models are used. The final numerical model is verified by the measurement data obtained from the field trials. After fitting the numerical model to the field data, the verified model is used in the sandpile sensitivity analysis. In this analysis the sensitivity of the material properties and geometry of the sandpile on the performance are researched. The residual settlements or performance, which is defined as the difference in settlement after construction and over a period of 8 years, is affected by the length, radius and <b>centre</b> <b>to</b> <b>centre</b> (ctc) <b>distance</b> of the sandpile. Adjusting the pile stiffness has minimal effect on the performance of the sandpile. An optimum in performance is found by varying both the pile radius and ctc distance. A combination of a small pile diameter with a small ctc distance results in the best performance. When comparing the performance of both sandpile and PVD, the PVD is found to be more effective in terms of performance. The additional stiffness of the sandpile is not reducing the total settlements, on the contrary, the self-weight of the piles increases the total settlements by providing an additional load to the soft soil layers located underneath the pile tip. In conclusion the sandpiles have no additional benefit over the use of PVDs, therefore the application of sandpiles at the NAICM site is not a feasible alternative to the use of PVDs. NAIC...|$|R

With life cycles of 25 - 30 years of buildings in financial cities and about 40 years in regional centres {{the ground is}} becoming more and more congested with redundant foundations. As the underground development of services and infrastructure already confines the location of building foundations, redundant foundations only add to this problem. The research described in this thesis, using centrifuge model testing, describes how the existing pile foundations in overconsolidated clay are likely to behave when their loading conditions are changed by unloading caused by demolition and subsequent reloading. This is done with the view to re-use the existing pile foundations for the new redevelopments. The influence of the new foundations on the existing foundations is also described. By re-using the foundations, the use of raw materials is reduced, the energy consummation for construction is reduced, the volume of soil from foundation construction is eliminated and the construction time significantly reduced, consequently reducing the whole costing of a structure. Experimental data was obtained from series of twenty one centrifuge model tests undertaken at 60 g. The geometry of the model was such that it was possible to test two sets of foundations with each test. The performance of piles in overconsolidated clay when subjected to load/unload/reload cycles and the influence of supplementary piles used to achieve the required capacity were investigated.

Prior a successful translation of the biological findings into an optimized treatment plan for humans, larger animals than rodents should be treated in MRT, which is one of the aims of the veterinary trials. A realistic scenario for a clinical trial phase I could be an MRT treatment delivered as a boost in order to delay tumor growth and increase the lifespan. The plan to irradiate landrace pigs in such a regim using 3 x 11 Gy as in conventional RT in 1 week compared to 2 x 11 Gy plus 1 MRT irradiation at 11 Gy in the valley at the tumour site is being proposed. This project represents one of the last steps towards clinical application of MRT where microbeam radiation therapy would be applied as a relevant and efficient therapeutic boost for brain tumor management. A phase I clinical trial should first demonstrate the normal tissue tolerance in humans applying a simple cross-fired microbeam array from a maximum of 3 ports prior moving to more sophisticated irradiation geometries. Such potentially interesting irradiation geometries could keep the normal tissue at very low dose values applying a large <b>centre</b> <b>to</b> <b>centre</b> <b>distance</b> of 1200 μm, and in combination with a horizontal microbeam dose delivery from several ports, tumor control could be improved using intersperced beams to deliver a radiotherapeutic relevant valley dose only at the tumour site at tighter ctc spacing.

40|$|In 1997 cracks {{were found}} in the {{relatively}} new movable part of the Van Brienenoord bridge, a repair method for steel orthotropic bridges has searched for ever since. For fixed bridges a solution was found: the steel deck plate is overlayed with a concrete layer with a thickness varying between 50 mm and 120 mm and on top of the repair layer a new wearing surface is created. The concrete layer is either connected by studs or by an epoxy layer. Movable bridges have a thin wearing surface. Due to weight restrictions, {{it is not possible to}} apply a relatively thick concrete layer on top of the steel deck plate. So, different solutions have been researched and the best option seems to be to overlay the steel deck plate with a thin heavily reinforced concrete layer. This method has already been analysed under static loads, but also the fatigue resistance should be guaranteed. This master thesis project aims at designing a 20 mm concrete layer in order to increase the lifespan of an orthotropic steel deck of a movable bridge by replacing the wearing surface of this deck by this concrete layer. The main topic dealt with is to determine the fatigue life of the repaired structure. It is assumed that the governing position in the structure is the connection between the trough web and the steel deck plate above the crossbeam. At this position the largest hogging moment exists. Three different alternatives are defined to come up with the most effective solution, all with the same composition, dimensions and material properties except the type of reinforcement. The repair method consists of a 17 mm thick high strength fibreless concrete layer, on top of an epoxy layer sprinkled in with calcinated bauxite. The different types of reinforcement are: epoxy coated and sprinkled in with sand Carbon Fibre Reinforced Polymer (CFRP), stainless steel and epoxy coated “ordinary” steel reinforcement, all with a bar diameter of 6 mm. The <b>centre</b> <b>to</b> <b>centre</b> <b>distance</b> of the rebars is 12 mm and the concrete cover on the rebars is 6 mm thick. The stresses occurring due to the fatigue loading based on the Eurocode (load model 3) are calculated and the fatigue lifetime of each material is defined. Since uncertainties exist about the fatigue behaviour of the interaction between materials, an experimental research has been started. Test specimens were created and dynamically loaded by a hogging moment in a four point bending test. In the experimental research it became clear that the steel reinforced alternatives fail by reinforcing bar failure, whereas the CFRP alternative fails by debonding of the rebars. Besides these failure modes, concrete cracks occurred in the anchorage zone of the reinforcement. These cracks have been further researched, because they might become critical in practice. It is concluded that the concrete is only governing in case of relatively high moments. Design and ConstructionCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|E
