500|$|The first {{published}} {{account of a}} <b>cross-coupled</b> filter is due to John R. Pierce at Bell Labs in a 1948 patent. [...] A <b>cross-coupled</b> filter {{is one in which}} resonators that are not immediately adjacent are coupled. [...] The additional degrees of freedom thus provided allow the designer to create filters with improved performance, or, alternatively, with fewer resonators. [...] One version of Pierce's filter, shown in figure 3, uses circular waveguide cavity resonators to link between rectangular guide cavity resonators. [...] This principle was not at first much used by waveguide filter designers, but it was used extensively by mechanical filter designers in the 1960s, particularly R. A. Johnson at Collins Radio Company.|$|E
500|$|<b>Cross-coupled</b> {{switched}} capacitor circuits {{come into their}} own for very low input voltages. [...] Wireless battery driven equipment such as pagers, bluetooth devices and the like may require a single-cell battery to continue to supply power when it has discharged to under a volt.|$|E
500|$|The {{need for}} frequency-independent delay in {{satellite}} applications {{led to more}} research into the waveguide incarnation of <b>cross-coupled</b> filters. [...] Previously, satellite communications systems used a separate component for delay equalisation. [...] The additional degrees of freedom obtained from <b>cross-coupled</b> filters held {{out the possibility of}} designing a flat delay into a filter without compromising other performance parameters. [...] A component that simultaneously functioned as both filter and equaliser would save valuable weight and space. [...] The needs of satellite communication also drove research into the more exotic resonator modes in the 1970s. [...] Of particular prominence in this respect is the work of E. L. Griffin and F. A. Young, who investigated better modes for the [...] band when this began to be used for satellites in the mid-1970s.|$|E
50|$|Transmetalation {{is often}} used as {{a step in the}} {{catalytic}} cycles of <b>cross-coupling</b> reactions. Some of the <b>cross-coupling</b> reactions that include a transmetalation step are Stille <b>cross-coupling,</b> Suzuki <b>cross-coupling,</b> Sonogashira <b>cross-coupling,</b> and Negishi <b>cross-coupling.</b> The most useful <b>cross-coupling</b> catalysts tend to be ones that contain palladium. <b>Cross-coupling</b> reactions have the general form of R′-X + M-R → R′-R + M-X and are used to form C-C bonds. R and R′ can be any carbon fragment. The identity of the metal, M, depends on which <b>cross-coupling</b> reaction is being used. Stille reactions use tin, Suzuki reactions use boron, Sonogashira reactions use copper, and Negishi reactions use zinc. The transmetalation step in palladium catalyzed reactions involve the addition of an R-M compound to produce an R′-Pd-R compound. <b>Cross-coupling</b> reactions have a wide range of applications in synthetic chemistry including the area of medicinal chemistry. The Stille reaction has been used to make an antitumor agent, (±)-epi-jatrophone; the Suzuki reaction has been used to make an antitumor agent, oximidine II; the Sonogashira reaction has been used to make an anticancer drug, eniluracil; and the Negishi reaction has been used to make the carotenoid β-carotene via a transmetalation cascade.|$|R
40|$|AbstractA band pass ΣΔ {{modulator}} {{using three}} different noise shaping based cross coupling techniques is proposed here. The {{effective use of}} time interleaving technique along with noise <b>cross-coupling</b> improves {{the performance of the}} modulator. Three variations of the conventional architecture are proposed - simple <b>cross-coupling,</b> extended <b>cross-coupling</b> and dual extended <b>cross-coupling,</b> which enhances effective order of noise shaping for a band pass modulator without significant overhead. By using extended <b>cross-coupling</b> and dual extended cross coupling architectures, the order of NTF is improved and it is evident that the proposed architectures shows a better in-band noise rejection with relaxed circuit specifications...|$|R

In an effort to broaden the range of viable substrates in asym. transformations, two new <b>cross-coupling</b> reactions using vinyl bromide electrophiles were developed. The <b>cross-coupling</b> of vinyl bromides with chlorobenzyl silanes {{in the presence of a}} chiral nickel bis(oxazoline) catalyst and stoichiometric manganese reductant delivers chiral allyl silane products with excellent enantioselectivity.

500|$|The {{method of}} {{coupling}} between non-adjacent resonators {{is not limited}} to mechanical filters. [...] It can be applied to other filter formats and the general term for this class is <b>cross-coupled</b> filter. For instance, channels can be cut between cavity resonators, mutual inductance can be used with discrete component filters, and feedback paths can be used with active analogue or digital filters. [...] Nor was the method first discovered in the field of mechanical filters; the earliest description is in a 1948 patent for filters using microwave cavity resonators. [...] However, mechanical filter designers were the first (1960s) to develop practical filters of this kind and the method became a particular feature of mechanical filters.|$|E

2500|$|Important {{merit of}} the matrix [...] {{is the fact that}} it allows to {{directly}} compute the frequency response of the equivalent network having the inductively coupled resonant circuits,. Therefore it is convenient to use this matrix when designing the <b>cross-coupled</b> filters. The coupling matrices , in particular, are used as coarse models of filters. Utilization of a coarse model allows to quicken filter optimization manyfold because of computation of the frequency response for the coarse model does not consume CPU time with respect to computation for the real filter.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Cesium {{carbonate}} and cesium hydroxide monohydrate {{are effective}} activators for the palladi-um-catalyzed <b>cross-coupling</b> of aryl(dimethyl) silanols with substituted aryl halides.

Manip-ulation of these factors provides an effective coupling method of wide scope and generality. Electron-rich aryl(dimethyl) silanols undergo <b>cross-coupling</b> with aryl iodides and aryl bromides in high yields and high selectivity for the desired <b>cross-coupling</b> prod-ucts.

Although these are not examples of exploiting multipath propagation to send multiple information streams, some of the mathematical techniques for dealing with mutual interference proved useful to MIMO development.

50|$|An {{interesting}} {{feature of}} the rotordynamic system of equations are the off-diagonal terms of stiffness, damping, and mass. These terms are called <b>cross-coupled</b> stiffness, <b>cross-coupled</b> damping, and <b>cross-coupled</b> mass. When {{there is a positive}} <b>cross-coupled</b> stiffness, a deflection will cause a reaction force opposite the direction of deflection to react the load, and also a reaction force in the direction of positive whirl. If this force is large enough compared with the available direct damping and stiffness, the rotor will be unstable. When a rotor is unstable it will typically require immediate shutdown of the machine to avoid catastrophic failure.|$|E

The synthesis of dienes by Negishi coupling was also compared with other methods such as carbonyl olefination (HWE and SG), Heck alkenylation and Suzuki coupling. Pd-catalyzed alkenylation–carbonyl olefination synergistic approach was used in the synthesis of some isomers of trienoic esters. ^ In the last chapter, emphasis is given towards exploring high turnover numbers (TONs) in Pd-catalyzed alkenyl-alkenyl <b>cross-coupling.</b> Negishi coupling between alkenylzirconium species and alkenyl halide lead to the TONs in the range of 105 - 107.
