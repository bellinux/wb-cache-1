Results indicated a reasonable agreement concerning the horizontal distribution of cloudiness in the region, especially for the ERA- 40 data set, but a substantial overestimation of <b>cloud</b> <b>amounts</b> was generally seen for both models. This was particularly evident over land surfaces during the winter season where both models showed <b>cloud</b> <b>amounts</b> exceeding the SCANDIA values with as much as 15 - 20 % in fractional cloud cover units.

Results indicated that a reasonable lower boundary for the optical thickness of detectable clouds for SCANDIA could be approximated to a value close to 1. Apart from completing the filtering attempt of model results for the further clarification and confirmation of the deviations between model simulations and satellite observations, future work will also consider the possibility to define appropriate model data simulation tools to support and facilitate the use of satellite-derived cloud climate data sets (e. g. those derived by the Climate Monitoring SAF) in model validation activities. ...|$|R

When this particular type of cloud is obscured by another type of cloud, the weight {{can be seen as the}} probability of this particular type of cloud being obscured by another type of cloud. With the formula for the "effective" frequency of occurrences of cloud and the formula for "effective" average cloud, this probability can be used to calculate the "effective" time-average <b>cloud</b> <b>amount</b> of this particular type of cloud. By applying this method to the analysis and calculation of the "effective" average <b>cloud</b> <b>amount</b> in the four different seasons as observed by 15 observation stations worldwide, this paper finds that the sum of the "effective" time-average cloud amounts of each type of clouds is far closer to the observed value of the total <b>cloud</b> <b>amount</b> than the sum of the time-average cloud amounts derived by using only the calculation formula for time-average <b>cloud</b> <b>amount,</b> with more than 87 % of the relative errors of the total <b>cloud</b> <b>amount</b> corrections made by the former being smaller than 15 % and all relative errors of the total average cloud corrections made by the latter exceeding 15 %.

Significant increases in cirrus are seen over many land areas, with respect to any surrounding oceans. To aid in interpretation of this result special attention is given to the New Zealand region as a case study for orographic cloud formation. Cirrus is found be more prevalent over New Zealand when compared to the adjacent ocean to the west. ISCCP <b>cloud</b> <b>amounts</b> are also compared with a ten year simulation of the UK Meteorological Office's Unified Model. The model is found to be considerably lacking in both cirrus and total high cloud over major mountain ranges. The model is also found to lack trailing cirrus clouds in the lee of orography despite the inclusion of a prognostic ice variable capable of being advected by the model winds. To improve the simulations of orographic cirrus and high cloud in the Unified Model a linear hydrostatic gravity wave scheme that predicts both the amplitude and phase of subgrid orographic gravity waves is introduced. The temperature perturbation caused by these waves in the troposphere is used to modify the amount of both liquid and ice cloud. One important feature of the parameterisation is that the launch amplitude of the gravity waves is predicted by a directional variance function which accounts for anisotropy in the subgrid orography.

This arises in part from the {{challenging}} deployment of instrumentation in this remote and harsh environment and from the limitations of traditional satellite passive remote sensing over the polar regions.

The extremely low temperatures, absolute humidity levels, and aerosol concentrations found in Antarctica create unique conditions for cloud formation that greatly differ from those encountered in other regions, including the Arctic. During {{the first decade of the}} 21 st century, new results from field studies, the advent of cloud observations from spaceborne active sensors, and improvements in cloud parameterizations in numerical models have contributed to significant advances in our understanding of Antarctic clouds.

In December, a downward trend in net longwave and net total appeared, while an upward trend in net shortwave was seen, and all corresponded to the decrease of <b>cloud</b> <b>amount</b> in this month. On the other hand in June, an upward trend in net longwave forcing was seen, corresponding to the increase of <b>cloud</b> <b>amount.</b> On an average, cloud radiative forcings at Syowa Station represented those of Antarctic costal stations near sea ice area. 昭和基地の過去 50 年間の気象データを解析した結果、近年南極の雲量が増加傾向にあることを示し、この雲量増加とradiative fluxesの相関、季節変動について議論しています...|$|E
40|$|Visible and {{infrared}} digitally encoded images from Meteosat 1 have {{been converted into}} broad band reflected and emitted irradiances in order to derive the radiation budget of the underlying surface/atmosphere. These fluxes were determined once an hour over Western Europe for August 21, 1978, averaged ober a l o lathong grid. This has allowed a daily mean to be calculated from the twenty-four observations and a standard deviation, {{a measure of the}} diurnal variability of the albedo and emitted irradiance. In addition, <b>cloud</b> <b>amounts</b> at three levels were derived every hour. The algorithms developed could in principle be applied to determining radiation budget and cloud parameters in real time from geostationary data, allowing an archive of satellite derived data to be collected. 1...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} simple and fast operator, the “Hidden ” Point Removal operator, which determines the visible points in a point cloud, as viewed from a given viewpoint. Visibility is {{determined}} without reconstructing a surface or estimating normals. It is shown that extracting the points that reside on the convex hull of a transformed point <b>cloud,</b> <b>amounts</b> to determining the visible points. This operator is general – it {{can be applied to}} point clouds at various dimensions, on both sparse and dense point clouds, and on viewpoints internal as well as external to the cloud. It is demonstrated that the operator is useful in visualizing point clouds, in view-dependent reconstruction and in shadow casting.

40|$|We present initial {{results from}} testing a new {{remote sensing system}} called the Active Temperature, Ozone and Moisture Microwave Spectrometer (ATOMMS). ATOMMS is {{designed}} as a satellite-to-satellite occultation system for monitoring climate. We are developing the prototype instrument for an aircraft to aircraft occultation demonstration. Here we focus on field testing of the ATOMMS instrument, in particular the remote sensing of water by measuring the attenuation caused by the 22 GHz and 183 GHz water absorption lines. Our measurements of the 183 GHz line spectrum along an 820 m path revealed that the AM 6. 2 spectroscopic model provdes a much better match to the observed spectrum than the MPM 93 model. These comparisons also indicate that errors in the ATOMMS amplitude measurements are about 0. 3 %. Pressure sensitivity bodes well for ATOMMS as a climate instrument. Comparisons with a hygrometer revealed consistency at the 0. 05 mb level, which is about 1 % of the absolute humidity. Initial measurements of absorption by the 22 GHz line made along a 5. 4 km path between two mountaintops captured a large increase in water vapor similar to that measured by several nearby hygrometers. A storm passage between the two instruments yielded our first measurements of extinction by rain and cloud droplets. Comparisons of ATOMMS 1. 5 mm opacity measurements with measured visible opacity and backscatter from a weather radar revealed features simultaneously evident in all three datasets confirming the ATOMMS measurements. The combined ATOMMS, radar and visible information revealed the evolution of rain and <b>cloud</b> <b>amounts</b> along the signal path during {{the passage of the}} storm. The derived average cloud water content reached typical continental <b>cloud</b> <b>amounts.</b> These results demonstrated {{a significant portion of the}} information content of ATOMMS and its ability to penetrate through clouds and rain which is critical to its all-weather, climate monitoring capability...|$|R
