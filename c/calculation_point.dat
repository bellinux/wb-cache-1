The user selects both the spatial dimension of the problem and order of the highest conserved moment. The accuracy of calculations is maintained on highly irregularly spaced points.

40|$|In {{the present}} study, we applied a novel mesh-free method to solve {{acoustic}} wave equation. Although the conventional finite difference methods determine the coefficients of its operator {{based on the}} regular grid alignment, the mesh-free method is not restricted to regular arrangements of <b>calculation</b> <b>points.</b> We derive the mesh-free approach using the multivariable Taylor expansion. The methodology can use arbitrary-order accuracy scheme in space by expanding the influence domain which controls the number of neighboring <b>calculation</b> <b>points.</b> The unique point of the method is that the approach calculates the approximation of derivatives using the differences of spatial variables without parameters as e. g. the weighting functions, basis functions. Dispersion analysis using a plane wave reveals that {{the choice of the}} higher-order scheme improves the dispersion property of the method although the scheme for the irregular distribution of the <b>calculation</b> <b>points</b> is more dispersive than that of the regular alignment. In numerical experiments, a model of irregular distribution of the <b>calculation</b> <b>points</b> reproduces acoustic wave propagation in a homogeneous medium same as that of a regular lattice. In an inhomogeneous model which includes low velocity anomalies, partially fine arrangement improves the effectiveness of computational cost without suffering from accuracy reduction.

40|$|Calculation and {{measurement}} of performance parameters of public lighting are {{performed in a}} grid of points defined by the CIE publication 140 [1] and European standard EN 13201 - 3. [2] Calculation grid defined in these documents was created {{at a time of}} less powerful computers and less precise measuring technology. Distance between two adjacent calculating points may be even 3 m, depending on the geometry of the road. This arrangement is too sparse {{in view of the fact}} that presently used computers can cope with much more denser grids in a shorter operation time and the measurement can be performed by luminance analyzers with more accuracy as well. Between the results of the calculation with different grid densities of <b>calculation</b> <b>points</b> there can be significant differences. This fact can be influenced by new optical systems and some LED luminaires which, as it was found out by measurements, may contain various local extremes in the LIDC. When calculating the performance parameters of public lighting with given grid density these extremes may fall between <b>calculation</b> <b>points</b> and thus they are not included in the calculation. The solution is to propose a new density of <b>calculation</b> <b>points</b> which would be designed with respect to current possibilities of computer and measuring technology. The paper deals with the influence of grid density to the resulting photometric parameters of public lighting. In computing software, <b>calculation</b> grid of <b>points</b> according to EN 13201 - 3 and calculation grid with half and 2 to 10 -times densification of <b>calculation</b> <b>points</b> will be used in order to capture the impact of given local extremes to the resulting parameters using luminaires with different optical systems.

50|$|The {{construction}} point (Konstruktionspunkt), {{also known}} as the critical point, <b>calculation</b> <b>point,</b> calculation line, K-point and K-spot, is a line across a ski jumping hill which indicates the hill's steepest point in meters. It was formerly used to classify the size of a ski jumping hill, and to calculate the number of points granted by a given jump. Since mid-2004, the hills are instead measured in hill size.|$|E

50|$|In 2004, the International Ski Federation {{replaced}} the <b>calculation</b> <b>point</b> as {{the measurement of}} the size of a hill with hill size. The hill size is the length from the takeoff in a straight line to the knoll and then along the level of the landing slope to the hill size point. The hill size point is calculated based on the technical data of a hill based on radius, angle of inclination and record distance. The <b>calculation</b> <b>point</b> or K-point is slightly further up in the hill and denotes the point where the landing slope is the steepest. It is still used for the calculation of distance points, which along with style points determine the winner of an event. For hills up to large, the scoring system grants 60 points to jumps which reach the critical point. For ski flying hills, 120 points are granted for the critical point length. Based on the hill's length, distance points are calculated, which are added for each meter beyond the critical point and subtracted for each point shorter than the critical point. A meter has more distance points in smaller hills. Hills also have a fall line; a jumper who falls or otherwise touches the ground with their body after the fall line is not penalized.|$|E
30|$|In {{order to}} predict the ground {{movement}} using the GIS functions, the following data, such as <b>calculation</b> <b>points,</b> extraction panels and subsidence parameters should be prepared at first. Meanwhile, the input parameters for ground movement calculations could be separated into two categories.

The second one is entering the calculation data of ground movement, including the extraction panel sequence ID, seam upward angle, inclination of dip, subsidence factor, excavation thickness, horizontal-movement factor, angle of draw and time factor. Since the ground movement is calculated only with the above entering data, the calculation results of each panel would be uncertain once the input data are uncertain.|$|R

FA 2 BOUG computes the complete Bouguer correction (i. e.

In a distant zone we consider the harmonic spherical expansion of the potential of each right rectangular prism representing an elevation grid point. In an intermediate zone we compute the gravitational attraction produced by each prism using the analytic formula. Finally, an inner zone contribution is divided into two parts: a flat-topped prism with a height equal to the elevation of the <b>calculation</b> <b>point,</b> and four quadrants of a conic prism sloping continuously from each square of the inner zone to the <b>calculation</b> <b>point.</b> The program has been applied to the Atlantic-Mediterranean transition zone to obtain a complete Bouguer anomaly map of the area, integrating available onshore Bouguer anomaly with satellite-derived free-air anomaly data. Positive Bouguer anomalies are found in the Atlantic oceanic domain (240 – 300 mGal), central and eastern Alboran Basin (40 – 160 mGal) and SW Iberian Peninsula (> 40 mGal). Major negative Bouguer anomalies are located beneath the west Alboran Basin (<− 40 mGal), the Rif, the Rharb Basin and the Atlas Mountains (<− 120 mGal). An isostatic residual anomaly map of the study area has been computed and compared with the crustal and lithospheric structure inferred from previous work.

30|$|In Eq. (1), a {{distance}} between a neutral axis of virtual GLT and the <b>calculation</b> <b>point</b> of tensile stress of ith lamina, y_i,t, {{was determined by}} Eq. (2). The tensile strength of the lamina was determined in a uniaxial tensile test. The tensile stress of a GLT in bending was not uniform through the depth of beam. The stress distribution in a GLT had a trapezoidal shape, as shown in Fig.  1. Thus, the distance between a neutral axis of virtual GLT and a <b>calculation</b> <b>point</b> of tensile stress profile in the lamina should be considered. Bender et al. [7] used the mid-depth stress criterion. Serrano et al. [8] showed that the mid-depth stress criterion is suitable only for large beam depths. Meanwhile, Mihashi et al. [9] compared three different criteria and showed that a combined failure criterion, modulus of rupture (MOR), and tensile strength gave the best agreement with the corresponding experimental results. In this study, y_i,t was determined by Eq. (2) which {{was derived from the}} combined stress of bending and tension. Equation (2) and k were considered to reflect the actual stress point in GLT.
