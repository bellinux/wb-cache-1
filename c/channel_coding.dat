40|$|In {{order to}} {{evaluate}} performance of strong <b>channel</b> <b>codes</b> in presence of imperfect carrier phase tracking for residual carrier BPSK modulation {{in this paper}} an approximate 'brick wall' model is developed which is independent of the <b>channel</b> <b>code</b> type for high data rates. It is shown that this approximation is reasonably accurate (less than 0. 7 dB for low FERs for (1784, 1 / 6) code and less than 0. 35 dB for low FERs for (5920, 1 / 6) code). Based on the approximation's accuracy, it is concluded {{that the effects of}} imperfect carrier tracking are more or less independent of the <b>channel</b> <b>code</b> type for strong <b>channel</b> <b>codes.</b> Therefore, the advantage that one strong <b>channel</b> <b>code</b> has over another with perfect carrier tracking translates to nearly the same advantage under imperfect carrier tracking conditions.

30|$|We {{investigate}} rotated Walsh-Hadamard spreading matrices for a broadband MC-CDMA {{system with}} robust channel estimation in the synchronous downlink. The similarities between rotated spreading and signal space diversity are outlined. In a multiuser MC-CDMA system, possible performance improvements {{are based on}} the chosen detector, the <b>channel</b> <b>code,</b> and its Hamming distance. By applying rotated spreading in comparison to a standard Walsh-Hadamard spreading code, a higher throughput can be achieved. As combining the <b>channel</b> <b>code</b> and the spreading code forms a concatenated code, the overall minimum Hamming distance of the concatenated code increases. This asymptotically results in an improvement of the bit error rate for high signal-to-noise ratio. Higher convolutional <b>channel</b> <b>code</b> rates are mostly generated by puncturing good low-rate <b>channel</b> <b>codes.</b> The overall Hamming distance decreases significantly for the punctured <b>channel</b> <b>codes.</b> Higher <b>channel</b> <b>code</b> rates are favorable for MC-CDMA, as MC-CDMA utilizes diversity more efficiently compared to pure OFDMA. The application of rotated spreading in an MC-CDMA system allows exploiting diversity even further. We demonstrate that the rotated spreading gain is still present for a robust pilot-aided channel estimator. In a well-designed system, rotated spreading extends the performance by using a maximum likelihood detector with robust channel estimation at the receiver by about 1 dB.|$|R
40|$|We propose {{three new}} design {{algorithms}} for jointly optimizing source and <b>channel</b> <b>codes.</b> Our optimality criterion is {{to minimize the}} average end-to-end distortion. For a given channel SNR and transmission rate, our joint source and <b>channel</b> <b>code</b> designs achieve an optimal allocation of bits between the source and channel coders. Our three techniques include a source-optimized <b>channel</b> <b>code,</b> a channel-optimized source code, and an iterative descent technique combining the design strategies {{of the other two}} codes. The joint designs use channel-optimized vector quantization (COVQ) for the source code and rate compatible punctured convolutional (RCPC) <b>coding</b> for the <b>channel</b> <b>code.</b> The optimal bit allocation reduces distortion by up to 6 dB over suboptimal allocations and by up to 4 dB relative to standard COVQ for the source data set considered. We find that all three code designs have roughly the same performance when their bit allocations are optimized. This result follows from the fact that at the optimal bit allocation the <b>channel</b> <b>code</b> removes most of the channel errors, in which case the three design techniques are roughly equivalent. We also compare the robustness of the three techniques to channel mismatch.
