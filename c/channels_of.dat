5|$|Continuing {{through the}} Cretaceous period {{and into the}} early Tertiary, there was {{uplifting}} {{in the area of}} the Colorado Plateau, the San Juan Mountains, and the La Plata Mountains, which led to the formation of the Mesa Verde pediment with the help of erosion. Small <b>channels</b> <b>of</b> water ran across this formation depositing gravel. Later in the tertiary, the last period of uplift and rock tilting towards the south caused these streams to cut rapidly into the rock removing loose sediment and forming the vast canyons seen today. This caused the isolation of the Mesa Verde pediment from surrounding rock. Today, since the climate is more arid, these erosional processes are slowed.|$|E

5|$|Each {{receiver}} antenna {{was sent to}} one of the <b>channels</b> <b>of</b> the displays in turn, causing one of the displays to refresh. For instance, at a given instant the switch might be set to send the signal to {{the left side of the}} azimuth display. The timebase generator was triggered to start sweeping the CRT dot up the screen after the transmission ended. Reflections would cause the dot to be deflected to the left, creating a blip whose vertical location could be measured against a scale to determine range. The switch would then move to the next position and cause the right-hand side of the display to be redrawn, but the signal inverted so the dot moved to the right. The switching occurred fast enough that the display looked continuous.|$|E

5|$|Organ stops can be {{combined}} in countless permutations, resulting in {{a great variety of}} sounds. A combination action can be used to switch instantly from one combination of stops (called a registration) to another.
