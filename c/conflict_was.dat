5|$|The Chadian–Libyan <b>conflict</b> <b>was</b> {{a series}} of {{sporadic}} clashes in Chad between 1978 and 1987 between Libyan and Chadian forces. Libya {{had been involved in}} Chad's internal affairs prior to 1978 and before Muammar Gaddafi's rise to power in Libya in 1969, beginning with the extension of the Chadian Civil War to northern Chad in 1968. The <b>conflict</b> <b>was</b> marked by {{a series of}} four separate Libyan interventions in Chad, taking place in 1978, 1979, 1980–1981 and 1983–1987. In all of these occasions Gaddafi had the support of a number of factions participating in the civil war, while Libya's opponents found the support of the French government, which intervened militarily to save the Chadian government in 1978, 1983 and 1986.|$|E

5|$|According to {{journalist}} , Enderlin's {{coverage of}} the Israeli-Palestinian <b>conflict</b> <b>was</b> respected by other journalists but was regularly criticized by pro-Israel groups.

40|$|Abstract: Both {{the ethnic}} and the {{religious}} <b>conflicts</b> <b>are</b> rooted in the profoundness of the cultural values system. The ethnic <b>conflict</b> <b>is</b> the result of engaging identity ideologies so as to legitimate an ethnic group, since nation-state and ethnicity are two concepts neither similar nor congruent. Moreover, a pertinent limiting, performed by theorists/specialists, is contradicted by the normative definition of terms, {{through the agency of}} laws, rules, and norms. The religious <b>conflict</b> <b>is</b> the result of the religious disputes. Differently from the previous concept, the terminological limiting in the field of religious <b>conflict</b> <b>is</b> theoretically and normatively stable. In {{spite of the fact that}} both types of conflicts can manifest together, the religious <b>conflicts</b> <b>are</b> shaped in a more acute form of confrontation, because their bases are related to an irrational reference...|$|R

5|$|Allegations {{have been}} made of {{omissions}} in the history described by the film. The absence of discussion of the Israeli-Palestinian <b>conflict</b> <b>was</b> noticed by some viewers. Davis claimed that Leo Strauss's ideas had been formed by his experiences in Germany during the Weimar Republic, and alleged that the film's failure to mention this was motivated by a wish to portray Strauss as concerned with American suburban culture, like Qutb.|$|E
5|$|Aside from rubber collection, {{violence}} in the Free State chiefly occurred in connection with wars and rebellions. Native states, notably Msiri's Yeke Kingdom, the Zande Federation, and Swahili-speaking territory in the eastern Congo under Tippu Tip, refused to recognise colonial authority and were defeated by the Force Publique with great brutality, during the Congo Arab war. In 1895, a military mutiny broke out among the Batetela in Kasai, leading to a 4-year insurgency. The <b>conflict</b> <b>was</b> particularly brutal and caused {{a great number of}} casualties.|$|E
5|$|Chinese and North Vietnamese {{documents}} {{state that}} relations between them worsened in 1973–75. A Vietnamese document claimed that China hindered the eventual reunification, while Chinese documents {{claimed that the}} source of the <b>conflict</b> <b>was</b> Vietnamese policy towards the Spratly and the Paracel Islands. However, the core issue for the Chinese was to minimize Vietnam's cooperation with the Soviets. Increasing Soviet/Vietnamese cooperation left China ambivalent about reunification.|$|E

5|$|Engelbart {{slipped into}} {{relative}} obscurity after 1976. Several of his researchers became alienated {{from him and}} left his organization for Xerox PARC, {{in part due to}} frustration, and in part due to differing views of the future of computing. Engelbart saw the future in collaborative, networked, timeshare (client-server) computers, which younger programmers rejected in favor of the personal computer. The <b>conflict</b> <b>was</b> both technical and ideological: the younger programmers came from an era where centralized power was highly suspect, and personal computing was just barely on the horizon.|$|E
5|$|Following Khumarawayh's {{ascension}} {{to power}} in 884, the Abbasid central government decided to reassert its control over the provinces ruled by him and invaded northern Syria that year. By early 885 the <b>conflict</b> <b>was</b> proceeding favorably for the Abbasids, forcing Khumarawayh to personally take the field and try to stop their advance toward Egypt. In the battle that followed, the Abbasid troops initially defeated the Tulunids and plundered Khumarawayh's camp, but were then ambushed by a Tulunid reserve force and routed in turn.|$|E
5|$|In April 1864, Brazil sent Minister Plenipotentiary José Antônio Saraiva to {{negotiate}} with Atanasio Aguirre, who had succeeded Berro in Uruguay. Saraiva made an initial attempt {{to settle the dispute}} between Blancos and Colorados. Faced with Aguirre's intransigence regarding Flores' demands, the Brazilian diplomat abandoned the effort and sided with the Colorados. On 10 August 1864, after a Brazilian ultimatum was refused, Saraiva declared that Brazil's military would begin exacting reprisals. Brazil declined to acknowledge a formal state of war, and for most of its duration, the Uruguayan–Brazilian armed <b>conflict</b> <b>was</b> an undeclared war.|$|E

5|$|In January 1992, the Sarajevo Agreement {{was signed}} by representatives of Croatia, the JNA and the UN, and a ceasefire called.
