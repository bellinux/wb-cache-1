40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an improvement in}} the colour image segmentation in the Hue Saturation (HS) sub-space. The authors propose to inject (add) a <b>colour</b> <b>vector</b> in the Red Green Blue (RGB) space to increase the class separation in the HS plane. The goal {{of the work is}} the development of an algorithm to obtain the optimal <b>colour</b> <b>vector</b> for injection that maximizes the separation between the classes in the HS plane. The chromatic Chrominace- 1 Chrominance- 2 sub-space (of the Luminance Chrominace- 1 Chrominance- 2 (YC 1 C 2) space) is used to obtain the optimal vector to add. The proposal is applied on each frame of a colour image sequence in real-time. It has been tested in applications with reduced contrast between the colours of the background and the object, and particularly when the size of the object is very small in comparison with the size of the captured scene. Numerous tests have confirmed that this proposal improves the segmentation process, considerably reducing the effects of the variation of the light intensity of the scene.

40|$|Cartoon {{images are}} often stored as pixel-based, raster data. This format {{is not the}} most {{appropriate}} for representing cartoon images that are initially drawn as geometric areas of colour. Raster images cannot be scaled without creating pixelisation artefacts and modification of such images must be performed pixel by pixel. A vector-based representation is a more suitable format for storing cartoon images. This thesis investigates a novel process for converting colour raster images into <b>colour</b> <b>vector</b> images. The process has been refined to facilitate the conversion of colour cartoon images, natively stored as raster data, into a scalable vector representation consisting of areas of uniform colours. The process is composed of a number of stages which are reviewed in some detail. These include; colour quantisation, colour decomposition, shape outlining, path tracing, path simplification, rendering and storage. An investigation into the use of colours in different types of images has been performed and used to improve the colour quantisation stage of the process which was noted to be problematic. Using the enhanced colour quantisation scheme together with additional novel optimisations an efficient colour area-based vectorisation system has been produced. The system has been extended to process multiple sequential images to support efficient conversion of cartoon video sequences into scalable vector animation. The developed colour area-based vectorisation system has been applied to a database of raster cartoon images. The generated vector representation is shown to offer a number of benefits including reduced storage requirements, the ability to render at higher resolutions without creating pixelation artefacts and simplified image manipulation for future modifications.

40|$|Abstract. The {{interpretation}} of colour images {{is presented as}} an inverse problem in which a mapping is sought between image <b>colour</b> <b>vectors</b> and the physiological parameters characterizing a tissue. To ensure the necessary oneto-one correspondence between the image colours and the parameters, the mapping must be unique. This can be established through testing {{the sign of the}} determinant of the Jacobian matrix, a multi-dimensional equivalent of a discrete derivative, over the space of all parameter values. Furthermore, an optimisation procedure is employed to find the set of filters for image capture which generate image vectors minimizing the mapping error. This methodology applied to {{interpretation of}} skin images shows that the standard RGB system of filters provides for a unique mapping between image values and parameters characterizing the normal skin. It is further shown that an optimal set of filters reduces the error of quantification by a factor of 2, on average. ...|$|R

Comparing to their monochromic counterparts, colour image data can offer not only more useful information about landscape but also the correlations among channels. Recently, multivariate mathematical morphology has received increased attention due to its rigorous mathematical theory and its powerful utility in multichannel image analysis. In this paper, a new morphological method for multichannel remotely sensed image processing is presented and analyzed. The proposed method utilizes a multivariate ordering principle based on principal component analysis.

40|$|The idea of {{contrast}} at a pixel, including contrast in colour or higher-dimensional image data, {{has traditionally been}} associated with the Structure Tensor, also named the di Zenzo matrix or Harris matrix. This 2 × 2 array encapsulates how colour-channel first-derivatives give rise to change in any spatial direction in x, y. The di Zenzo or Harris matrix Z has been put to use in several different applications. For one, the Spectral Edge method for image fusion uses Z for a putative colour image, along with the Z for higher-dimensional data, to produce an altered RGB image which properly has exactly the same Z as that of high-D data. As well, Z has been used as the foundation for the Harris interest-point or corner-point detector. However, a competing definition for Z is the 2 × 2 Hessian matrix, formed from second-derivative values rather than first derivatives. In this thesis we develop a novel Z which in the first place utilizes the Harris Z, but then goes on to modify Z by adding some information from the Hessian. Moreover, here we consider an extension to a Hessian for colour or higher-D image data which treats colour channels not as simply to be added, but in a colour formulation that generates the Hessian from a <b>colour</b> <b>vector.</b> For image fusion, results are shown to retain more details and also generate fused images that have smaller CIELAB errors from the original RGB.

40|$|Several {{characteristics}} of kiwifruit determine its {{value to the}} kiwifruit marketing company, Zespri Ltd, and to the grower. The foremost {{of these is the}} dry matter content. Much effort is expended in predicting the final dry matter content of the fruit as early in the season as possible so that the optimal dry matter content can be achieved. Dry matter content is currently measured through a destructive 90 -fruit protocol that may be repeated several times in a season on each maturity block. Remote sensing data available from modern satellites can provide four-colour (red, green, blue and near-infrared) data with resolution down to 1 - 2 m, less than the size of one kiwifruit vine. Many indices can be created from these and correlated to the {{characteristics of}} plants with indifferent results. This thesis presents the development of an index wherein the four colours are used to create a three-dimensional unit <b>colour</b> <b>vector</b> that is largely independent of light level. This transform was used to allow the direct visualisation of data from a number of satellite images of the Te Puke kiwifruit growing area in New Zealand over five years, for which dry matter content values were available from the 90 -fruit protocol. An attenuation model was chosen to correct the top-of-atmosphere light intensities recorded by the satellite cameras to those at ground level. The method of Hall et al., (1991) was found to reduce the variation of fiduciary pixels by the largest amount and was used. The visualisation revealed that there was an axis along which dry matter was ordered by magnitude. A regression line of best fit was applied to this data producing an R 2 value of 0. 51 with a standard mean-square error of 0. 76. This is significantly lower than the average mean-square error of 1. 05 for the 90 -fruit protocol.

Accurate image segmentation of skin lesions {{is one of the key}} steps for useful, early, and non-invasive diagnosis of cutaneous melanomas. In this paper, a modified segmentation algorithm has been used to extract the true border that reveals the global structure irregularity (indentations and protrusions), which may suggest excessive cell growth or regression of a melanoma. The algorithm is applied to the blue channel of the RGB <b>colour</b> <b>vectors</b> to distinguish lesions from the skin and uses background noise reduction to enhance and filter the image of lesion. The algorithm also does not depend on the use of rigid threshold values, because an optimal thresholding algorithm “isodata algorithm " that is used determines an optimal threshold iteratively.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. A {{number of studies have}} shown {{that it is possible to}} use a colour codebook, which has a limited number of colours (typically 100 - 200), to replace the colour gamut and obtain a good quality reconstructed colour image. Thus colour images can be displayed on less expensive devices retaining high quality and can be stored in less space. However, a colour codebook is normally randomly arranged and the coded image, which is referred to as the index image, has no structure. This prevents the use of this kind of colour image representation in any further image processing. The objective of the research described in this thesis is to explore the possibility of making the index image meaningful, that is, the index image can retain the structure existing in the original full colour image, such as correlation and edges. In this way, a three band colour image represented by <b>colour</b> <b>vectors</b> can be transfomled into a one band index image represented by scalar variables. To achieve the scalar representation of colour images, the colour codebook must be ordered to satisfy the following two conditions: (I) codewords representing similar colours must be close together in the code book and (2) close code words in the codebook must represent similar colours. Some effective methods are proposed for ordering the colour codebook. First, several grouping strategies are suggested for grouping the code words representing similar colours together. Second, an ordering function is designed, which gives a quantity. measurement of the satisfaction of the two conditions of an ordered codebook. The code book ordering is then iteratively refined by the ordering function. Finally, techniques, such as artificial codeword insertion, are developed to refine the code book ordering further. A number of algorithms for colour codebook ordering have been tried to retain as much structure in the index image as possible. The efficiency of the algorithms for ordering a colour codebook has been tested by applying some image processing techniques to the index image. A VQ/DCT colour image coding scheme has been developed to test the possibility of compressing and decompressing the index image. Edge detection is applied to the index image to test how well the edges existing in the original colour image can be retained in the index image. Experiments demonstrate that the index image can retain a lot of structure existing in the original colour image if the codebook is ordered by an appreciate ordering algorithm, such as the PNNbased/ ordering function method together with artificial codeword insertion. Then further image processing techniques, such as image compression and edge detection, can be applied to the index image. In this way, colour image processing can be realized by index image processing in the same way as monochrome image processing. In this sense, a three-band colour image represented by <b>colour</b> <b>vectors</b> is transformed into a single band index image represented by scalar variables...|$|R
