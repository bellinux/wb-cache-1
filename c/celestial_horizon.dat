5000|$|In astronomy, the {{meridian}} is {{the great}} circle passing through the celestial poles, the zenith, and the nadir of an observer's location. Consequently, it contains also the horizon's north and south points, and it is perpendicular to the <b>celestial</b> equator and <b>horizon.</b> A <b>celestial</b> meridian is coplanar with the analogous terrestrial meridian projected onto the celestial sphere. Hence, the number of astronomical meridians is infinite.|$|R
40|$|This module uses {{interactive}} simulations {{to introduce}} {{students to the}} <b>horizon</b> and <b>celestial</b> coordinate systems and the apparent rotation of objects in the sky (caused by the Earth's rotation). The simulations demonstrate the horizon plane, azimuth, and altitude; compare {{the advantages and disadvantages}} of the <b>horizon</b> and <b>celestial</b> coordinate systems, and show the paths of stars and other objects as they 'rotate' through the sky. The 'Rotating Star Explorer' lets users place stars, select the observer's position, and run an animation that shows the movements of the stars in both <b>celestial</b> and <b>horizon</b> views. The module includes a pretest, posttest, and a student guide. Educational levels: Middle school, High school, Undergraduate lower division...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: This paper {{presents}} an {{innovation in teaching}} strategy in one major subject in the Maritime Education and Training (MET) program of the Maritime Academy of Asia and the Pacific (MAAP). This strategy makes use of an instructional aid called MAAPCNIA (MAAP Celestial Navigation Instructional Aid), conceptualized and designed by Capt. Daniel S. Torres, Jr. MAAPCNIA encompasses color-coded spheres that depict navigational triangle. This triangle is composed of a blue <b>celestial</b> sphere representing <b>horizon</b> system of coordinates and a white sphere enclosing a globe characterizing time diagram and celestial equator and terrestrial systems of coordinates. With this instrument, celestial spheres can be easily visualized compared when using one-dimensional drawing. Hence, understanding of orthographic projection, which is essentially the core of appreciation and mastery of this tough subject, is enhanced. This paper focuses on the development and impact of MAAPCNIA since its conception in 2004, towards authentic teaching-learnin...|$|R
5000|$|This {{coordinate}} system divides the sky {{into the upper}} hemisphere where objects are visible, and the lower hemisphere where objects cannot be seen since the Earth obstructs vision. The great circle separating the hemispheres is called the <b>celestial</b> <b>horizon.</b> The <b>celestial</b> <b>horizon</b> {{is defined as the}} great circle on the celestial sphere whose plane is normal to the local gravity vector. In practice, the horizon can be defined as the plane tangent to a still liquid surface such as a pool of mercury. [...] The pole of the upper hemisphere is called the zenith. The pole of the lower hemisphere is called the nadir.|$|E
50|$|Some {{examples}} of great circles on the celestial sphere include the <b>celestial</b> <b>horizon,</b> the celestial equator, and the ecliptic. Great circles {{are also used}} as rather accurate approximations of geodesics on the Earth's surface for air or sea navigation (although {{it is not a}} perfect sphere), as well as on spheroidal celestial bodies.|$|E

50|$|In astronomy, a {{vertical}} circle {{is a great}} circle on the celestial sphere that is perpendicular to the horizon. Therefore, it passes through the zenith and the nadir. There is {{a vertical}} circle for any given azimuth, where azimuth is the angle measured east from the north on the <b>celestial</b> <b>horizon.</b> The vertical circle {{which is on the}} east-west direction is called the prime vertical. The vertical circle which is on the north-south direction is called the Local Celestial Meridian (LCM) or Principal Vertical. Vertical circles are part of the horizontal coordinate system.|$|E
50|$|The Midheaven {{is always}} aligned with north or south. However, the Ascendant and Descendant are not {{necessarily}} aligned with east and west, so the Ascendant is not necessarily at 90 degrees to the Midheaven. The Ascendant is the degree of the ecliptic that intersects the eastern <b>celestial</b> <b>horizon</b> at a specific time and location. For observers in the tropics, this will always be close to due east and the Ascendant will always be close to 90 degrees away from the Midheaven. As the observer moves farther north or south it becomes possible for the Ascendant to be {{farther and farther away}} from due east.|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} explores {{evidence for}} the practice of astronomy in central southern England during the Mesolithic and early Neolithic. It argues that those who built the prehistoric structures known as Cotswold-Severn earthen tombs embedded archaeoastronomic intent within their monuments’ architecture for both navigational and calendrical purposes. This research analyses various aspects of the archaeology found within the tombs and claims the monuments show evidence of intended alignment to specific <b>celestial</b> <b>horizon</b> events. The period under investigation is one of transition not just between eras, but possibly in the types of astronomy practised as well, thus there is also investigation into whether there was a shift from a lunar to solar allegiance at this time...|$|E
