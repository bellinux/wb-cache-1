The enclosed cockpit was over the wing leading edge and behind it there was a windowed cabin with access through a starboard-side door. This contained two berths forward and, towards the back, tables for radio-operator and navigator, with a toilet further aft. [...] The fin was <b>integral</b> <b>with</b> the <b>body,</b> rising slowly from it (a characteristic feature of Couzinet's designs) and carrying a pointed, curved, deep and narrow rudder. The Arc-en-Ciel's triangular plan tailplane, mounted near mid-fuselage, had a tapered elevator with a curved cut-out for rudder movement.|$|R
50|$|Midland Electric milk floats were {{produced}} by Midland Vehicles Ltd of Leamington Spa. Their first design was a 10-15 cwt chassis, which {{was launched in}} January 1937. It was designed by J Parker Garner, {{who at the time}} was a well-known designer, having been involved in the manufacturing of vehicles for a number of years. In early 1938, Midland added a model B20 to their range, which was designed for a 20 cwt payload, but was otherwise very similar to the earlier model. It was showcased at the British Industries Fair, held at Castle Bromwich in February. The vehicle on display consisted of a chassis and a van body which had been cut in half, so that visitors to the show could see both the look of the vehicle and the construction of the chassis. By 1943, Midland Electric were producing five models, which could be fitted with various types of bodywork, including a flat-bed truck for coal deliveries. The B12 catered for a payload of 10-12 cwt, the BA12 for 12-15 cwt, the B20 for 18-22 cwt, the B25 for 25-28 cwt, with the largest model, the B30, suitable for 30-35 cwt. They produced a new 10-cwt lightweight design in 1949, which features an all-welded chassis <b>with</b> an <b>integral</b> <b>body</b> frame. The 10-cwt model was called the Midland Vandot when it was showcased at an exhibition in 1953, organised by the Electric Vehicle Association and the South Eastern Electricity Board. The company was listed in a 1956 directory of electric vehicle manufacturers published in Commercial Motor, but the company closed in 1957.|$|R

40|$|The paper surveys recent {{development}} in the highly specialized field of chemical engineering: vehicle exhaust gas aftertreatment, where variable configuration systems are currently introduced or considered. These respond to varying operating conditions by inserting into the gas treatment flowpath different reactors. The main practical problem are the valves for gas flow switching. Usual mechanical valves are costly, failure prone, heavy (especially the solenoid variants), and not robust enough to withstand the adverse conditions of high temperature, vibration, shocks and dripping water and mud at the usual locations under vehicle body. Fluidic no-moving-part valves, inexpensive and robust, are proposed as an attractive alternative. Especially in their novel axisymmetric layout, they may be very compact, in fact <b>integral</b> <b>with</b> reactor <b>body.</b> The qualitative change brought by the new approaches may provide an inspiration {{to other areas of}} chemical engineering...|$|R

In {{order to}} improve the repair quality and {{efficiency}} of automotive body collision damage, and ensure the safety and reliability of the automobile after repairing, the paper discusses the <b>integral</b> <b>body</b> deformation characteristics based on the analysis of automobile impact force. Aiming at structural damage of <b>integral</b> <b>body,</b> the paper makes body damage repair process, analyzes the main factors which affect the body fixed and measurement, and puts forward a method which uses a multi-point pulling and the computer 3 D measurement system to repair the damage. Finally, {{the validity of the}} method is verified by the collision case. The results show that the method can effectively control the position deviation of the body structure not more than 3 mm, it can also improve the repair quality of automotive collision and reduce reworking rates effectively...|$|R

The vehicle was a 200 passenger, liquid hydrogen fueled Mach 6 transport designed to meet a range goal of 9. 26 Mn (5000 NM). A variety of trade studies were conducted {{in the area of}} configuration arrangement, structural design, and active cooling design in order to maximize the performance of each of three point design aircraft: (1) circular wing-body with nonintegral tanks, (2) circular wing-body <b>with</b> <b>integral</b> tanks and (3) elliptical blended wing-body <b>with</b> <b>integral</b> tanks. Aircraft range and weight were used as the basis for comparison.
