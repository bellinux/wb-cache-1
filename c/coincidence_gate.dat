40|$|A {{series of}} Monte Carlo neutron {{calculations}} for a combined gamma/passive neutron coincidence counter has been performed. This type of detector, {{part of a}} suite of non-destructive assay instruments utilised for {{the enforcement of the}} Euratom nuclear safeguards within the European Union, is to be used for high accuracy measurements of the plutonium content of nuclear materials. The multi-purpose Monte Carlo N-Particle (MCNP) code version 4 B has been used to model in detail the neutron coincidence detector and to investigate the leakage self-multiplication of PuO 2 and Mixed U-Pu Oxide (MOX) reference samples used to calibrate the instrument. The MCNP calculations have been used together with a neutron coincidence counting interpretative model to determine characteristic parameters of the detector. A comparative study to both experimental and previous numerical results has been performed. Sensitivity curves of the variation of the detector's efficiency, epsilon, to the (alpha,n), to spontaneous fission neutron emission rate ratio, alpha, and to the reals <b>coincidence</b> <b>gate</b> utilisation factor, fr, are presented. Once bias-corrected, the trends of the real coincidence counts rate as a function of sample mass for three types of sample could be matched within 0. 33 % of experimental results. This result confirms the possible use of MCNP to calculate response trends accurately {{for a wide variety of}} source materials, given a limited experimental calibration set. Sources of the inaccuracy in the calculations have not yet been fully investigated, because of the vast parameter space to be investigated, but values of the <b>coincidence</b> <b>gate</b> utilisation factor derived directly from the MCNP data have been found to be overestimated by about 8. 2 %.

40|$|Large multidetector {gamma}-ray arrays, {{which can}} {{separate}} the prompt {gamma}-ray cascades {{within a single}} fission product nucleus (of moderate yield) from the bulk of prompt {gamma}-rays, has now opened new prospects for studies of yrast excitations in {sup 132 }Sn and the few valence particle nuclei around it. Measurements were performed at Eurogam II using a {sup 248 }Cm source. This paper features {{the results for the}} two and three valence proton N= 82 isotones {sup 134 }Te and {sup 135 }I which exhibit simple clearcut excitation modes, resembling {sup 210 }Po and {sup 211 }At, their well studied N= 126 counterparts in the {sup 208 }Pb region. A search was made for new {sup 135 }I transitions by setting a single <b>coincidence</b> <b>gate</b> on 1134 keV {gamma}-rays; strong 288, 572, 690, 725, 1661, 1695, and 2247 keV coincident {gamma}-rays were identified as {sup 135 }I {gamma}-rays. In summary, yrast excitations to above 5. 5 MeV excitation energy in the 2 - and 3 -proton nuclei {sup 134 }Te and {sup 135 }I have been established and interpreted with help of shell model calculations using empirical nucleon-nucleon interactions.

40|$|A liquid scintillator-based neutron {{coincidence}} counting {{system designed}} to address a number of safeguards applications is under development by the IAEA {{in collaboration with the}} Joint Research Centre-ITU and Hybrid Instruments LTD. Liquid scintillators are a promising technology due to their good fast-neutron detection capabilities. The characteristic fast response of scintillators is particularly beneficial for coincidence counting applications, for which a performance level higher than that associated with moderated thermal detectors might be expected. Fast neutron detection requires no thermalization process and therefore, does not incur the resulting neutron detection delays. These features reduce the length of the <b>coincidence</b> <b>gate</b> by three orders of magnitude, reducing practically at negligible values the accidental coincidence rate which dominates the uncertainty in thermal neutron detectors. Recent progress in fast electronic digitizers offers the possibility to perform on-line, real-time pulse shape discrimination (PSD) between gamma and neutron radiation detection, making this technology suitable for nuclear safeguards and security applications. This paper will describe the experiments and Monte Carlo modelling activities engaged to design a prototype liquid scintillator-based neutron coincidence collar for fresh fuel assembly verification. The characterization of the system response required accurate calibration measurements {{in order to determine the}} operational parameters of the liquid scintillator cell, including gain, pulse shape discrimination and energy thresholds. Extensive Monte Carlo simulations which are essential for the understanding and characterization of the system’s response were also carried out using the MCNPX-PoliMi Monte Carlo code to simulate the radiation transport within the system and to optimize the detector design. The evolution from the different detector configurations we investigated to the characteristic features of the final design will be described...|$|E

40|$|Self-assembled {{quantum dots}} {{comprise}} a versatile system {{with which to}} study quantum effects in the solid state. Many devices have been developed that demonstrate controlled charging of a quantum dot, Rabi oscillation 2, coherent spin control and electrically injected non-classical photon emission. Often referred to as ‘artificial atoms’, quantum dots have discrete energy levels, making them a viable candidate for encoding qubits. However, unlike single atoms, no two quantum dots are alike. This is a complication for quantum-information applications that require qubits initialized in the same state and interactions between remote systems mediated by indistinguishable photons. We report that truly remote, independent, quantum dots can be tuned to the same energy using large applied electric fields. This allows two-photon interference of their emission under <b>coincidence</b> <b>gating</b> and opens up the possibility of transferring quantum information between remote solid-state sources...|$|R
40|$|Temporally-correlated neutron counting, {{including}} the passive neutron coincidence counting (PNCC) and passive neutron multiplicity counting (PNMC) techniques, {{is widely used}} at nuclear fuel cycle facilities for the non-destructive assay (NDA) of plutonium (Pu). Correlated event rates are used to quantify mass values of spontaneously fissile nuclides and derive total Pu mass. These methods are limited in accuracy by uncertainty in the deadtime correction. A pulse train analysis method has been developed and applied to the re-evaluation of deadtime correction factors for correlated neutron counting. The Monte-Carlo transport code MCNPXTM was used to generate a time-stamped list of neutron captures in 3 He. Event times were processed in software to create neutron pulse trains akin to list mode data. The action of multiplicity shift register (MSR) electronics was modeled in software to analyse these pulse trains. Prior to MSR analysis, stored pulse trains could be perturbed in software to apply the effects of deadtime. In this work, an updating (paralyzable) deadtime model was chosen to replicate existing theoretical approaches to deadtime correction. Traditional deadtime correction methods for temporally-correlated neutron counting {{have been found to}} be accuracy limiting in cases where highly correlated rates occur over a short <b>coincidence</b> <b>gate</b> width i. e. high instantaneous rates associated with high multiplicity bursts. Here, empirical results are presented which support the development of an alternative formulism for both the traditional Singles and Doubles deadtime correction factors for PNCC. Deadtime effects are found to be dependent on the level of correlation in the pulse train yet independent of gate fraction, which is set by the shift register gate structure, for Singles deadtime correction factors. Doubles deadtime correction factors were found to have a slight dependence on gate fraction.

40|$|A {{method for}} the {{detection}} of special nuclear materials (SNM) in shielded containers which is both sensitive and easily applicable under field conditions is presented. The method applies neutron induced fission in SNM by means of an external pulsed neutron source with subsequent detection of the fast prompt fission neutrons. Liquid scintillation detectors surrounding the container under investigation are able to discriminate gamma rays from fast neutrons by the so-called pulse shape discrimination technique (PSD). One advantage of these detectors, besides the ability to do PSD analysis, is that the analogue signal from a detection event is of very short duration (typically few tens of nanoseconds). This allows the use of very short <b>coincidence</b> <b>gates</b> for multiple detectors {{for the detection}} of prompt neutrons from the same fission event while benefiting from a low accidental (background) coincidence rate. These features result in a relatively low detection limit of the fissile mass. Another principal advantage of this method derives {{from the fact that the}} external neutron source is pulsed. By proper time gating the interrogation can be done by either epi-thermal or thermal neutrons. These source neutrons do not appear in the neutron signal following the PSD analysis thus providing a fundamental method for separating the interrogating source neutrons from the response in form of fast fission neutrons. The paper describes laboratory tests with multiple detectors at the Pulsed Neutron Interrogation Test Assembly (PUNITA) for the purpose of investigating the measurement principle. Results of thermal and epi-thermal neutron interrogations are shown and discussed. JRC. E. 8 -Nuclear securit...|$|R

40|$|Internal {{conversion}} coefficients were measured by observing with a well-type Nal(Tl) crystal the photon spectra emitted during the de-excitation {{from the first}} excited state to the ground state of Gdl 54,D) y 160, Ybl 70, Ybl 71 and Prl 41 following the respective beta decays of Eul 54, Tbl 60, Tm 170, Tml 71 and Cel 41. The results were obtained by analysis of either the singles spectra, or spectra obtained by coincidence-sum techniques, or both. For the <b>coincidence</b> work <b>gating</b> was done either with high energy gamma rays or with beta particles. The spectra from the Yb isotopes were analyzed on a computer using a least-squares curve-fitting program. The photon detection efficiencies, necessary for the measurements, were calculated with a computer by performing numerical integrations. The following K-shell internal {{conversion coefficients}} were measured directly for first excited state to ground state transitions: 0. 632 ± 0. 016, for Gdl 54; 1. 48 ± 0. 05, for Ybl 70; 6. 9 : 1 : 1. 0, for Ybl 71 and 0. 375 ± 0. 009, for Prl 41. The total internal conversion coefficients were measured for the first excited state to ground state transitions in Gdl 54 and nyl 60 and found to be 1. 20 ± 0. 02 and 4. 52 ± 0. 11, which yield respective K-shell internal conversion coefficients of 0. 637 ± 0. 016 and 1. 54 ± 0. 06 when multiplied by K to total ratios. The results for these 2 +- 3 ̆e 0 + transitions in Gdl 54 and Dyl 60 and for this -t -forbidden Ml transition in Prl 41 are in good agreement with theory. The ratio of the experimental result to the theoretical value is 1. 09 ± 0. 06 for this 2 +- 0 + transition in Ybl 70.

40|$|The initial {{interactions}} rate foreseen at LHC at the designed luminosity of 10 ^ 34 cm- 2 s- 1 is 1 GHz. Such {{an extremely}} large rate must {{be reduced by}} the trigger system to 200 Hz {{in order to allow}} permanenent data storage preserving the much less probable physics signals against a large bakground. The ATLAS Level- 1 muon trigger will be crucial for the online selection of events with high transverse momentum muons and for its correct association to the bunch-crossing of interest. The overall rejection factor is 10 ^ 4. The muon trigger in the barrel region is provided by three layers of Resistive Plate Chmbers (RPC). The logic is based on the search of patterns of hits in the RPC stations consistent with a muon track originated from the interaction vertex. Two pT regimes with different programmable thresholds have been implemented: 3 low-pT trigger thresholds and 3 high-pT one. The associated trigger electronics is based on a custom chip, the Coincidence Matrix (CM), that performs space <b>coincidences</b> and time <b>gates</b> providing also the readout of the RPCs. A package with very detailed simulation of the algorithm and the logic of the hardware components has been developed in order to optimize the performances of the system.

40|$|The proton-proton beam {{crossing}} at the LHC accelerator at CERN {{will have}} a rate of 40 MHz at the project luminosity. The ATLAS Trigger System has been designed in three levels in order to select only interesting physics events reducing from that rate of 40 MHz to the foreseen storage rate of about 200 Hz. The First Level reduces the output rate to about 100 kHz. The ATLAS Muon Spectrometer {{has been designed to}} perform stand-alone triggering and measurement of muon transverse momentum up to 1 TeV/c with good resolution (from 3 % at 10 GeV/c up to 10 % at 1 TeV/c). In the Barrel region of the Muon Spectrometer the Level- 1 trigger is given by means of three layers of Resistive Plate Chamber detectors (RPC) : a gaseous detector working in avalanche mode composed by two plates of high-resistivity bakelite and two orthogonal planes of read-out strips. The logic of the Level- 1 barrel muon trigger is based on the search of patterns of RPC hits in the three layers consistent with a high transverse momentum muon track originated from the interaction vertex. The associated trigger electronics is based on dedicated processors, the Coincidence Matrix boards, performing space <b>coincidences</b> and time <b>gates</b> and providing the RPC readout as well. A detailed simulation of the ATLAS Experiment and of both the hardware components and the logic of the Level- 1 Muon Trigger in the barrel of the Muon Spectrometer has been performed.
