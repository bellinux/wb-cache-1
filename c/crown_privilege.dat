50|$|The Spanish American wars of {{independence}} of {{the early nineteenth century}} disrupted Spain and the Spanish empire, when in 1808 Napoleon Bonaparte invaded the Iberian peninsula, overturned the Spanish Bourbon monarchy, and placed his brother Joseph on the Spanish throne. Bonaparte himself {{is an example of a}} successful general who rose to national power during the massive disruption of the French Revolution and was crowned emperor in 1804. For Spain and Spain's empire, their loss of legitimate monarch to a usurper unleashed forces that might well have remained latent. In Spanish America, the eighteenth-century Bourbon reforms had systematically excluded American-born Spanish men from positions of political power, with the <b>crown</b> <b>privileging</b> Iberian-born officials and imposing economic policies that had deleterious effects in part of the empire. Previously, Spanish America had developed a level of local rule within the empire, with local elites being able to aspire to official positions and economic relations operated within long-established patterns. The Napoleonic invasion of Spain sparked Spanish American movements for autonomy and various regions set up juntas which operated in the name of the displaced Bourbon monarch. With the restoration of Ferdinand VII in 1814 following Napoleon's defeat and his reassertion of absolutist rule, the struggles in many parts of Spanish America become to be for complete independence. Except for Cuba and Puerto Rico, Spanish America had achieved that goal by 1825.|$|R
50|$|The English case of Duncan v Cammel Laird, which {{concerned}} {{sinking of}} HMS Thetis, {{is important in}} this regard. It concerned litigation by widows and dependants during World War I, the accident having occurred before the war. The plaintiffs wanted to access the plans of the submarine {{so that they could}} prove their case. The Ministry of Defence said that this was a sensitive matter, invoking <b>Crown</b> <b>privilege</b> and arguing, accordingly, that it could not be adduced in court. The House of Lords (deciding the case at the darkest point of the war) held that, once the decision to invoke <b>Crown</b> <b>privilege</b> is made in the proper form, it may not be questioned.|$|E

60|$|I {{will now}} cite a few cases, applicable, in my opinion, {{to the present}} question.

50|$|The Crown Proceedings Act 1947 (c. 44) is an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom that allowed, for {{the first}} time, civil actions against the Crown to be brought {{in the same way}} as against any other party.

5000|$|With the Norman {{invasion}} of Ireland in 1169, a powerful Norman family - the Butlers - became the new overlords. Early in the 14th century, {{they were raised}} to the Earldom of Ormond. As the holders of the County Palatine of Tipperary, they were entitled to appoint sheriffs and judges, and to gather certain classes of revenue that would normally {{have been due to}} the <b>Crown.</b> This <b>privilege</b> was withdrawn in 1715.

50|$|The Lordship of Glamorgan {{was one of}} {{the most}} {{powerful}} and wealthy of the Welsh Marcher Lordships. The seat was Cardiff Castle. It was established by the conquest of Glamorgan from its native Welsh ruler, by the Anglo-Norman nobleman Robert FitzHamon, feudal baron of Gloucester, and his legendary followers the Twelve Knights of Glamorgan. The Anglo-Norman Lord of Glamorgan, like all Marcher lords, ruled his lands directly by his own law: thus he could, amongst other things, declare war, raise taxes, establish courts and markets and build castles as he wished, without reference to the <b>Crown.</b> These <b>privileges</b> were only lost under the Laws in Wales Acts 1535-1542. Though possessing many castles, the main seat of the Lordship was Cardiff Castle.|$|R

Finally, the lineage of the Fernández de Heredia remained as owner of this population, taking charge of it in 1388 Gil Ruiz de Lihori, who {{changed his name to}} Juan Fernández de Heredia.

5000|$|Deliberative process {{privilege}} is {{a specific}} instance of the more general principle of executive privilege. It is usually considered to be based upon common law rather than separation of powers, and its history traces back to the English <b>crown</b> <b>privilege</b> (now known as public-interest immunity). [...] In contrast, the presidential communications privilege is another specific instance of executive privilege, usually considered as being based upon separation of powers, {{and for that reason}} it is more difficult to overcome than deliberative process privilege. [...] A significant requirement of the presidential communications privilege is that it can only protect communications sent or received by the President or his immediate advisors, whereas the deliberative process privilege may extend further down the chain of command.|$|E
50|$|Public-interest {{immunity}} (PII), previously {{known as}} <b>Crown</b> <b>privilege,</b> is {{a principle of}} English common law under which the English courts can grant a court order allowing one litigant to refrain from disclosing evidence to the other litigants where disclosure would be damaging to the public interest. This is {{an exception to the}} usual rule that all parties in litigation must disclose any evidence that is relevant to the proceedings. In making a PII order, the court has to balance the public interest in the administration of justice (which demands that relevant material is available to the parties to litigation) and the public interest in maintaining the confidentiality of certain documents whose disclosure would be damaging. PII orders have been used in criminal law against large organised criminal outfits and drug dealers where the identity of paid police informants could be at risk.|$|E
50|$|In Conway v Rimmer, {{twenty-five years}} later, the House of Lords {{revisited}} {{the issue and}} reasserted judicial control. The court said it had been wrong in Duncan; court must always apply its mind; must always make up its own mind {{as to whether the}} circumstances justify State privilege. This case involved a probationary policeman who was not going to have his probation confirmed; he wanted access to confidential staff files that the police had on his performance, that he might make his case stronger thereby. The Minister issued a certificate invoking <b>Crown</b> <b>privilege.</b> This was challenged. The court a quo said it was bound by Duncan, and for perhaps the first time the House of Lords revisited an earlier decision. What could be the harm to the State, it asked, if the performance of an individual policeman is put on table? It might be slightly embarrassing, but it was no national security issue. It was for the court to decide, and the court decided in casu that records should be revealed.|$|E

[...] "Don't you be so talkative!" [...] quoth he; and, indeed, he could hardly find space for a word, and quite as little after his admonition as before. Her nimble tongue ran over the whole system {{of life in the}} hospital. The brethren, she said, had a yearly stipend (the amount of which she did not mention), and such decent lodgings as I saw, and some other advantages, free; and, instead of being pestered with a great many rules, and made to dine together at a great table, they could manage their little household matters as they liked, buying their own dinners and having them cooked in the general kitchen, and eating them snugly in their own parlors. [...] "And," [...] added she, rightly deeming this the <b>crowning</b> <b>privilege,</b> [...] "with the Master's permission, they can have their wives to take care of them; and no harm comes of it; and what more can an old man desire?" [...] It was evident enough that the good dame found herself in what she considered very rich clover, and, moreover, had plenty of small occupations to keep her from getting rusty and dull; but the veteran impressed me as deriving far less enjoyment from the monotonous ease, without fear of change or hope of improvement, that had followed upon thirty years of peril and vicissitude. I fancied, too, that, while pleased with the novelty of a stranger's visit, he was still a little shy of becoming a spectacle for the stranger's curiosity; for, if he chose to be morbid about the matter, the establishment was but an almshouse, in spite of its old-fashioned magnificence, and his fine blue cloak only a pauper's garment, with a silver badge on it that perhaps galled his shoulder. In truth, the badge and the peculiar garb, though quite in accordance with the manners of the Earl of Leicester's age, are repugnant to modern prejudices, and might fitly and humanely be abolished.|$|R

40|$|The goal of {{this thesis}} is to {{critically}} examine the major constituent elements of the State Security system in Canada from a legal perspective. It is a historically-contingent notion essential not {{for the protection of}} the population as a whole, but for the preservation of State hegemony, which is directed almost exclusively against left-wing dissent and protest. As the ideological foundation of State Security in Canada, this notion constitutes the politico-legal framework for each of the arms of the State Security hydra, each of which is examined in some depth: (1) crimes against the State, (2) official State secrets, (3) the right of access to government and personal information, (4) the <b>Crown</b> <b>privilege</b> to refuse disclosure of National Security information, and (5) the centrepiece of State Security, the Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS). While all of the traditional constituents of National Security (subversion, terrorism and espionage) are examined, the overwhelming emphasis of this study is on subversion, protest and dissent. Some areas have been omitted, however, and most notably emergencies legislation, due to time constraints. (Abstract shortened by UMI. ...|$|E
40|$|Medical {{confidentiality}} {{has long}} been recognised as a core element of medical ethics, but its boundaries are under constant negotiation. Areas of debate in twenty-first century medicine {{include the use of}} patient-identifiable data in research, information sharing across public services, and the implications of advances in genetics. This book provides important historical insight into the modern evolution of medical confidentiality in the UK. It analyses a range of perspectives and considers the broader context as well as the specific details of debates, developments and key precedents. With each chapter focusing on a different issue, the book covers the common law position on medical privilege, the rise of public health and collective welfare measures, legal and public policy perspectives on medical confidentiality and privilege {{in the first half of}} the twentieth century, contestations over statutory recognition for medical privilege and <b>Crown</b> <b>privilege.</b> It concludes with an overview of twentieth century developments. Bringing fresh insights to oft-cited cases and demonstrating a better understanding of the boundaries of medical confidentiality, the book discusses the role of important interest groups such as the judiciary, Ministry of Health and professional medical bodies. It will be directly relevant for people working or studying in the field of medical law as well as those with an interest in the interaction of law, medicine and ethics...|$|E

Santa María la Real de Nieva village was founded in 1395 by King Henry III, by the mediation of his wife Catherine of Lancaster. The town’s founding was due to the finding of a buried wooden sculpture of Mary three years before, probably hidden since muslem invasion, in a piece of open ground where the village is now. This fact was considered a miracle, and the Queen ordered the building of a sanctuary and a village around it, to the worship of this Virgin’s image, called Soterraña, an old Spanish word that means 'subterranean'.

What has this discussion to do with a recorded warning to the people of their rashly forming a precipitate judgment against their representatives? What had Mr. Burke's opinion of the danger of introducing new theoretic language, unknown to the records of the kingdom, and calculated to excite vexatious questions, into a Parliamentary proceeding, to do with the French Assembly, which defies all precedent, and places its whole glory in realizing what had been thought the most visionary theories?
