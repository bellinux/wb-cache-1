25|$|On 23 April 2009, Keane was {{appointed}} {{as the new}} manager of Ipswich Town on a two-year contract, {{the day after the}} club had dismissed Jim Magilton. His first game in charge came the following Saturday with a 3–0 away win over Cardiff City, the final league match to be played at Ninian Park. The following week, Ipswich rounded off the season with a 2–1 win over Coventry City. In the 2009–10 season, Keane started to sign some players, some of them from his former club Sunderland. He signed goalkeeper Marton Fulop, midfielders Carlos Edwards and Grant Leadbitter and brought in Jack <b>Colback,</b> David Healy and Daryl Murphy on loan to the club. Ipswich started without a win in their first fourteen matches, making them the last team to record their first win in the whole league, finally winning on 31 October against Derby County and recording their first away win of the season on 29 November against Cardiff City. Their form gradually improved throughout the season, but Ipswich drew far too many games to come anywhere near the promotion race and they finished the season in 15th place. Many inconsistencies in the 2009–10 and the 2010–11 season meant that Keane's Ipswich side never really challenged for promotions {{and as a result of}} a poor run of form, ending up with his side dropping to as low as 21st in the Championship. Keane was dismissed as Ipswich manager on 7 January 2011.|$|E

In November, <b>Colback</b> confirmed that talks of a new deal had started after initially rejecting a new contract in the summer under the management of Di Canio. Further talks over a new contract continued in February. In April, it was reported that <b>Colback</b> had turned down a new contract with the club and was set to depart upon the expiry of the contract. Several Premier League clubs made contract offers to sign <b>Colback,</b> but Sunderland refused to give up on <b>Colback</b> and hoped he would stay at the club.|$|E

50|$|On 20 April, Liverpool {{defeated}} Everton 4-0 in {{the second}} Merseyside Derby of the season. Divock Origi and Mamadou Sakho scored a goal each {{late in the first}} half to give Liverpool a half-time lead. In the 50th minute, Ramiro Funes Mori was given a red card following his tackle on Origi which caused Origi's substitution due to an injury sustained {{as a result of the}} tackle. Origi's substitute, Daniel Sturridge, and Philippe Coutinho added goals. Liverpool was exceptionally dominant in the game, with 37 shots as opposed to Everton's 3, as well as having 67% of the possession. This win moved Liverpool to seventh. On 23 April, Liverpool welcomed former manager Rafael Benítez to Anfield with his new team, Newcastle, and drew 2-2. Despite leading 2-0 at half-time through goals by Daniel Sturridge and Adam Lallana, the lead was cancelled out by a Papiss Cissé header when goalkeeper Simon Mignolet failed to clear a cross and a Jack <b>Colback's</b> low strike which took a huge deflection. Mamadou Sakho was not available for selection as UEFA was conducting an investigation into a possible doping violation; he was replaced by Kolo Touré. On 28 April, UEFA had announced the suspension of Sakho for a provisional period of 30 days following a positive drug test. On the same day, Liverpool traveled to El Madrigal to play Villarreal, but were downed by a late goal from substitute Adrián in the 92nd minute to lose 1-0.|$|R

The Daily Mail described <b>Colback</b> as the [...] "most underrated player in the Premier League" [...] and compared his move to the rival as Sol Campbell joining Arsenal from Tottenham Hotspur.|$|E
50|$|A former left-back, <b>Colback</b> is a left-footed central midfielder {{known for}} his {{versatility}} and efficient playing style; due to his technical skills, passing range and physique, he is neat in possession and rarely gives the ball away, which along with his athletic ability and defensive work-rate, allows him to link-up the defence and the attack effectively. Former England manager Roy Hodgson has likened his abilities to those of Andrea Pirlo.|$|E
50|$|<b>Colback</b> {{began his}} career at Sunderland in 2008, having {{graduated}} from their academy, and broke into the team following loans at Ipswich Town of the Championship. After 115 Premier League appearances with Sunderland, his contract expired and he controversially moved to their local rivals, Newcastle United.

50|$|In the 2015-16 season, Tioté made twenty league {{appearances}} for the side, firstly under Steve McClaren, {{and then}} under Rafael Benítez.

The following summer saw Tioté linked with moves to Turkey and China, but nothing came to fruition. Benítez decided to keep him on as a squad player, and he fell further down the pecking order with Jonjo Shelvey, Jack <b>Colback</b> and Isaac Hayden all starting ahead of him. He made three more appearances for the club - once in the league, in a 1-1 draw with Aston Villa, and twice in the FA Cup, in both third round ties against Birmingham City.|$|E

Despite never making an appearance under Bruce, he made his debut for the first team in Martin O'Neill's first game in charge on 11 December, a 2-1 win over Blackburn Rovers and was credited for the comeback which saw his side overturn a 1-0 deficit, after coming on as a substitute for Jack <b>Colback</b> in the second half.|$|E
