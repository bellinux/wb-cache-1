25|$|The Hong Kong AIDS Foundation is a {{registered}} charitable institution which depends on funding and donations. According to the annual reports of year 2002–2005, the Foundation received funding mainly from the AIDS Trust Fund, donations and income from the seed fund. The greatest contribution in terms of monetary value comes from the seed fund, in which the capital donation came from the Hong Kong SAR Government and The Hong Kong Jockey Club. The Foundation has a continued annual trend of <b>current</b> <b>expenses</b> exceeding current income and therefore relies on the income brought by the seed fund as well as investments which contributes to surpluses {{at the end of}} March throughout the years. The top three donors were AIDS Trust Fund (愛滋病信託基金委員會), Maryknoll China Service and Levi Strauss & Co.in the year 2004–2005. Also, the Foundation is exempted from Hong Kong profits tax as it is {{a registered}} charitable institution. The fund is mainly spent on various projects and activities, library development, education and publicity programs and other administrative costs like salaries for full-time staff. The percentage of expenses spent on staff and allowances has remained high throughout the years – 69% of the total amount of expenditure was allocated under the category of staff and allowances in the year 2005. It is Mr Stephen W.T. Liu, JP who guides and gives advises to the Finance Committee.|$|E

60|$|Troubles {{were coming}} thick upon Ralph Newton. He had {{borrowed}} {{a hundred pounds}} from Mr. Neefit, but this he had done under pressure of a letter from his brother the parson.

Sometimes the promise would be kept,--and sometimes not. The parson, as a bachelor, was undoubtedly a rich man. He had a living of £400 a year, and some fortune of his own; but he had tastes of his own, and was repairing the Church at Peele Newton, his parish in Hampshire. It would therefore sometimes happen that he was driven to ask his brother for money.

30|$|In this context, ETR {{represents}} {{the relationship between}} overall tax expense, including deferred taxes, and pre-tax earnings of the year. Thus, by taking into account provisions for deferred taxes that were simultaneously set aside, this rate disregards any effects that shift <b>current</b> tax <b>expenses</b> or tax payables to later accounting periods. In contrast to this, CurrETR depicts only the <b>current</b> tax <b>expenses</b> excluding deferred taxes, and CashETR indicates the relative size of cash taxes paid (Hanlon and Heitzman 2010). As in most cases of international double taxation the German tax system imposes the exemption method by following the worldwide approach to taxing foreign income, Germany-based multinationals can easily use the benefits of lower foreign tax rates (Spengel 2005). Consequently, profit shifting should not lead to excessively high deferred tax liabilities which could potentially bias tax rate measures.|$|R

Black Sigatoka (also known as black leaf streak) {{has spread to}} banana plantations throughout the tropics from infected banana leaves that were used as packing material. It affects all main cultivars of bananas and plantains (including the Cavendish cultivars), impeding photosynthesis by blackening parts of the leaves, eventually killing the entire leaf.
