He also began a magazine for Catholics titled People of God (Pueblo de Dios), calling for Christians to lead the struggle for human rights. However, the magazine was shut down the following year by Cuba's bishops under government pressure. Payá attempted to run for the National Assembly of People's Power (NAPP) in 1992, but was not allowed to stand.|$|E
5|$|Oswaldo Payá Sardiñas (29 February 1952– 22 July 2012) was a Cuban {{political}} activist. A Roman Catholic, {{he founded}} the Christian Liberation Movement in 1987 to oppose the one-party rule of the <b>Cuban</b> <b>Communist</b> <b>Party.</b> He attracted international attention for organizing a petition drive known as the Varela Project, in which 25,000 signatories petitioned the Cuban government to guarantee {{freedom of speech and}} freedom of assembly as well as to institute a multi-party democracy. In recognition of his work, he received the European Parliament's Sakharov Prize and People in Need's Homo Homini Award.|$|E
5|$|Cuba's {{economy grew}} in 1974 {{as a result}} of high {{international}} sugar prices and new credits with Argentina, Canada, and parts of Western Europe. A number of Latin American states called for Cuba's re-admittance into the Organization of American States (OAS), with the U.S. finally conceding in 1975 on Henry Kissinger's advice. Cuba's government underwent a restructuring along Soviet lines, claiming that this would further democratization and decentralize power away from Castro. Officially announcing Cuba's identity as a socialist state, the first National Congress of the <b>Cuban</b> <b>Communist</b> <b>Party</b> was held, and a new constitution adopted that abolished the position of President and Prime Minister. Castro remained the dominant figure in governance, taking the presidency of the newly created Council of State and Council of Ministers, making him both head of state and head of government.|$|E

5|$|Castro {{believed}} in the need for reform if Cuban socialism was {{to survive in a}} world now dominated by capitalist free markets. In October 1991, the Fourth Congress of the <b>Cuban</b> <b>Communist</b> <b>Party</b> was held in Santiago, at which a number of important changes to the government were announced. Castro would step down as head of government, to be replaced by the much younger Carlos Lage, although Castro would remain the head of the Communist Party and Commander-in-Chief of the armed forces. Many older members of government were to be retired and replaced by their younger counterparts. A number of economic changes were proposed, and subsequently put to a national referendum. Free farmers' markets and small-scale private enterprises would be legalized in an attempt to stimulate economic growth, while U.S. dollars were also made legal tender. Certain restrictions on emigration were eased, allowing more discontented Cuban citizens to move to the United States. Further democratization was to be brought in by having the National Assembly's members elected directly by the people, rather than through municipal and provincial assemblies. Castro welcomed debate between proponents and opponents of the reforms, although over time he began to increasingly sympathise with the opponent's positions, arguing that such reforms must be delayed.|$|E

25|$|The <b>Cuban</b> <b>Communist</b> <b>Party</b> {{was later}} renamed the People's Socialist Party for electoral reasons. Its policy was {{dictated}} from Moscow. At one time, it supported the dictatorship of Gerardo Machado and would later support Fulgencio Batista, in whose government Dr. Juan Marinello and Carlos Rafael Rodriguez were ministers without portfolio. Although covert communist support {{was given to}} Castro and Che Guevara in the Sierra Maestra, the overt People's Socialist Party was critical of Fidel Castro's rise to power until the summer of 1958.|$|E

However, it issued a statement mourning the death of Kim Jong-il. Since the overturn of socialism in the Soviet bloc, the CPC (ML) has largely abandoned its previously strident anti-revisionist position. The CPC (ML) has become strongly supportive of Cuba and the Cuban Revolution and now has close relations with the Cuban Embassy in Ottawa.

2500|$|Eliades Acosta, a {{prominent}} Cuban historian, {{head of the}} <b>Cuban</b> <b>Communist</b> <b>Party's</b> Committee on Culture and {{former director of the}} Jose Marti National Library in Havana, offered the standard Cuban interpretation of the sinking of the Maine (that the United States itself probably did it) in an interview to The New York Times. But Acosta adds that [...] "Americans died for the freedom of Cuba, and that should be recognized. But others wanted to annex Cuba, and that should be criticized. If relations with the United States improve, all these things can be re-examined more fairly". This claim has also been made in Russia. Mikhail Khazin, a Russian economist who once ran the cultural section at Komsomolskaya Pravda, speaking in a 2008 Pravda interview of the need in troubled times to change the psychology of society, to unite it, said that [...] "the Americans blew up their own battleship Maine." ...|$|R
25|$|After {{finishing}} his term in 1944 Batista lived in Florida, returning to Cuba {{to run for}} president in 1952. Facing certain electoral defeat, he led a military coup that preempted the election. Back in power, and receiving financial, military, and logistical support from the United States government, Batista suspended the 1940 Constitution and revoked most political liberties, including the right to strike. He then aligned with the wealthiest landowners who owned the largest sugar plantations, and presided over a stagnating economy that widened the {{gap between rich and poor}} Cubans. Batista outlawed the <b>Cuban</b> <b>Communist</b> <b>Party</b> in 1952. After the coup, Cuba had Latin America's highest per capita consumption rates of meat, vegetables, cereals, automobiles, telephones and radios, though about one third of the population was considered poor and enjoyed relatively little of this consumption.|$|E
25|$|Following the revolutionaries' {{victory on}} 1 January 1959, he was {{appointed}} the director of medical services in Havana and later served as the national Minister of Health from 1960 to 1967, during which time {{he was responsible for}} the development of the country's health sector. In January 1968, reportedly in the aftermath of a personal conflict with Fidel Castro over the running of the health sector, {{he was appointed}} to serve as the Politburo's delegate in the province of Matanzas. He remained in Matanzas until mid-1971; his administration of the province's economy and health sector was successful, particularly in terms of crop outputs, public transport and reduced infant mortality. Upon leaving Matanzas in 1971, he was appointed first secretary of the <b>Cuban</b> <b>Communist</b> <b>Party</b> in the province of Havana and was elected to the Politburo in December 1975.|$|E
25|$|The Second Occupation of Cuba, {{also known}} as the Cuban Pacification, was a major US {{military}} operation that began in September 1906. After the collapse of President Palma's regime, US President Roosevelt ordered an invasion and established an occupation that would continue for nearly four years. The goal of the operation was to prevent fighting between the Cubans, to protect North American economic interests, and to hold free elections. In 1906, the United States representative William Howard Taft, notably with the personal diplomacy of Frederick Funston, negotiated an end of the successful revolt led by the young general Enrique Loynaz del Castillo, who had served under Antonio Maceo in the final war of independence. Estrada Palma resigned, and the United States Governor Charles Magoon assumed temporary control until 1909. In this period, Agustín Martín Veloz and Francisco (Paquito) Rosales founded the embryonic <b>Cuban</b> <b>Communist</b> <b>Party</b> in the area of Manzanillo. Following the election of José Miguel Gómez in November 1908, Cuba was deemed stable enough to allow a withdrawal of American troops, which was completed in February 1909.|$|E
5000|$|During the revolution, Fidel Castro {{created a}} {{propaganda}} structure {{that would serve}} {{as the foundation for}} propaganda dissemination after gaining power. He immediately began organizing an international media empire that included radio stations, a news agency with offices around the world, newspapers, magazines, publishing houses, “friendship” institutes and other organizations that were under direct control of the <b>Cuban</b> <b>Communist</b> <b>Party’s</b> Political Bureau. Castro was so entrenched in the daily nuances of the propaganda apparatus that he would personally visit editorial offices to check on stories in the party’s daily newspaper Granma or visit the headquarters of Cuba’s international news agency Prensa Latina to make statements on breaking news. [...] Castro also wrote editorials on sensitive subject matter most often concerning the United States. The day-to-day components of the media empire were given to Antonio Perez Herrero who became head of the Revolutionary Orientation Department which outlined ideological guidelines of the party and made sure they were followed. [...] Herrero and Department Chief Orlando Fundora Lopez often accompanied Castro abroad to ensure that tight control on the media was not loosened by distance.|$|R
5000|$|On October 3, 1965, Castro {{publicly}} {{revealed an}} undated letter purportedly written {{to him by}} Guevara around seven months earlier which was later titled Che Guevara's [...] "farewell letter". In the letter, Guevara reaffirmed his enduring solidarity with the Cuban Revolution but declared his intention to leave Cuba {{to fight for the}} revolutionary cause abroad. Additionally, he resigned from all his positions in the <b>Cuban</b> government and <b>communist</b> <b>party,</b> and renounced his honorary Cuban citizenship.|$|R

25|$|Although {{contacts}} between Cubans and foreign visitors were made legal in 1997, extensive censorship has isolated {{it from the}} rest of the world. In 1997, a group led by Vladimiro Roca, a decorated veteran of the Angolan war and the son of the founder of the <b>Cuban</b> <b>Communist</b> <b>Party,</b> sent a petition, entitled La Patria es de Todos ("the homeland belongs to all") to the Cuban general assembly, requesting democratic and human rights reforms. As a result, Roca and his three associates were sentenced to imprisonment, from which they were eventually released. In 2001, a group of Cuban activists collected thousands of signatures for the Varela Project, a petition requesting a referendum on the island's political process, which was openly supported by former U.S. President Jimmy Carter during his 2002 visit to Cuba. The petition gathered sufficient signatures to be considered by the Cuban government, but was rejected on an alleged technicality. Instead, a plebiscite was held in which it was formally proclaimed that Castro's brand of socialism would be perpetual.|$|E
25|$|At {{the time}} of his death he was a Cuban marxist revolutionary in Mexico trying to {{organize}} the overthrow of the Cuban government of General Gerardo Machado. This cause was an embarrassment to the <b>Cuban</b> <b>Communist</b> <b>Party,</b> which was trying to gain power by establishing a modus vivendi with Machado. What further disturbed the Cuban communists was that they felt he had fallen under Leon Trotsky's influence. Mella was assassinated on January 10, 1929, while walking home late at night with photographer Tina Modotti. The Mexican government tried to implicate Modotti in the murder, even releasing nude photographs of her by Edward Weston in an attempt to generate public opinion against her. Muralist Diego Rivera played a very active role in defending her and exposing the Mexican government's crude attempt to frame her. It is unclear whether Mella was murdered by the dictatorial Cuban government; if his death had been brought about by Trotsky-Stalin Communist Party feuding; or by a combination of these mutual interests. It is widely speculated that he died by the notoriously bloody hand of Vittorio Vidali.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{argues that}} the nature of ‘idealism’ or ‘utopianism’ in Cuba’s post- 1959 socialist {{transition}} and the peculiarity of Cuban state socialism have been inadequately conceptualised in the literature. It hypothesises that the pervasive state-centrism of Cuba’s prevailing socialist model is a hybrid of ‘statist utopianism’ and the Stalinist imprint of a post- 1970, relative Sovietisation of the Cuban Revolution. Statist utopianism is conceptualised in a Marxist theoretical framework as a distinctive approach to the socialist transition: imposing a communist vision on society rather than striving for its organic realisation. Unlike 16 th– 19 th century Utopian socialism, statist utopianism rests on proletarian state power and has a state-centric dynamic. Statist utopianism is conceptualised as having intrinsic subjective as well as political-economic dimensions. The thesis distinguishes between, and contrasts, ‘organic transcendence’ and statist utopian approaches to the socialist transition. The concept of statist utopianism is grounded historically in the late 1960 s Cuban and early Soviet experiences of socialist transition. Cuba’s 1968 – 70 Revolutionary Offensive, which nationalised the remnant urban private sector, is characterised as a statist utopian ‘great leap forward’. The significance of certain continuities and convergences between Cuba’s late 1960 s ‘idealist’ phase and subsequent partial and uneven Sovietisation have been understated or overlooked. The thesis identifies methodological weaknesses in the ‘historical pendulum’ approach to the periodisation of the Cuban Revolution. It concludes that certain conceptual identities and institutional peculiarities of the prevailing (and now receding) Cuban socialist model comprise a mutually reinforcing state-centric nexus that cannot be explained on the basis of Sovietisation alone, and which therefore seems to be a peculiar hybrid of statist utopianism and the Stalinist imprint of Sovietisation. The concept of statist utopianism developed in this thesis casts the Cuban socialist transition and the <b>Cuban</b> <b>Communist</b> <b>Party’s</b> contemporary renovation project in a distinct light. ...|$|R
