2500|$|The Brazilian {{economy grew}} {{considerably}} {{in the second}} half of the nineteenth century. Coffee was the mainstay of the economy, accounting for 63% of the country's exports in 1891, and 51% between 1901 and 1910. [...] However, sugar, cotton, tobacco, cocoa, and, during the turn-of-the-century rubber boom, rubber were also important. During the first three decades of the 20th century, the Brazilian economy went through periods of growth but also difficulties caused in part by World War I, the Great Depression, and an increasing trend toward coffee overproduction. The four-year gap between the time a coffee tree is planted and the time of the first harvest magnified <b>cyclical</b> <b>fluctuations</b> in coffee prices, which in turn led to the increasing use of government price supports during periods of excess production. The price supports induced an exaggerated expansion of coffee cultivation in São Paulo, culminating in the huge overproduction of the early 1930s.|$|E

Its value is assumed to be positive and less than unity which means that when income increases the whole of it is not spent on consumption. On the contrary, when income falls, consumption expenditure does not decline in the same proportion and never becomes zero. The Keynesian hypothesis is that the marginal propensity to consume is positive but less than unity (...) is of great analytical and practical significance. Besides telling us that consumption is an increasing function of income and it increases by less than the increment of income, this hypothesis helps in explaining1) The theoretical possibility of general overproduction or [...] "underemployment equilibrium" [...] and also2) The relative stability of a highly developed industrial economy. For it implies that the gap between income and consumption at all high levels of income is too wide to be easily filled by investment with the possible consequences that the economy may fluctuate around underemployment equilibrium.Thus the economic significance of the MPC lies in filling the gap between income and consumption through planned investment to maintain the desired level of income.|$|E

Furthermore changes of oxygenated haemoglobin (HbO(2)) and deoxygenated haemoglobin (Hb) were investigated. Measurements were done during two hours of undisturbed daytime sleep. Fifty-eight infants (30 male, 28 female) were included in the study.

The frequency was changing within a range of 3 to 6 cycles/minute. Polynominal regression analysis showed that the relationship of Delta HbO(2) and Delta Hbtot was distinctively stronger compared to the relationship of Delta Hb and Delta Hbtot.

In the framework of the Argentinian economy, the empirical analysis confirms this hypothesis, showing that the elasticity of wages to the unemployment rate decreases with tenure.
