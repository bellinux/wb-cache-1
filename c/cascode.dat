25|$|Lower output resistance: For analog operation, good gain {{requires}} a high MOSFET output impedance, {{which is to}} say, the MOSFET current should vary only slightly with the applied drain-to-source voltage. As devices are made smaller, {{the influence of the}} drain competes more successfully with that of the gate due to the growing proximity of these two electrodes, increasing the sensitivity of the MOSFET current to the drain voltage. To counteract the resulting decrease in output resistance, circuits are made more complex, either by requiring more devices, for example the <b>cascode</b> and cascade amplifiers, or by feedback circuitry using operational amplifiers, for example a circuit like that in the adjacent figure.|$|E
25|$|The {{names of}} the {{terminals}} refer to their functions. The gate terminal may {{be thought of as}} controlling the opening and closing of a physical gate. This gate permits electrons to flow through or blocks their passage by creating or eliminating a channel between the source and drain. Electron-flow from the source terminal towards the drain terminal is influenced by an applied voltage. The body simply refers to the bulk of the semiconductor in which the gate, source and drain lie. Usually the body terminal is connected to the highest or lowest voltage within the circuit, {{depending on the type of}} the FET. The body terminal and the source terminal are sometimes connected together since the source is often connected to the highest or lowest voltage within the circuit, although there are several uses of FETs which do not have such a configuration, such as transmission gates and <b>cascode</b> circuits.|$|E
