5|$|Chord {{inversion}} {{is especially}} simple in major-thirds tuning. <b>Chords</b> are inverted simply by raising {{one or two}} notes three strings. The raised notes are played with the same finger as the original notes. Thus, major and minor <b>chords</b> are played on two frets in M3tuning {{even when they are}} inverted. In contrast, inversions of <b>chords</b> in standard tuning require three fingers on a span of four frets, in standard tuning, the shape of inversions depends on the involvement of the irregular major-third.|$|E
5|$|In contrast, <b>chords</b> {{cannot be}} shifted around the {{fretboard}} in standard tuning, which requires four chord-shapes {{for the major}} chords: There are separate fingerings for <b>chords</b> having root notes {{on one of the}} four strings three–six.|$|E
5|$|Instructional {{literature}} uses standard tuning. Traditionally {{a course}} {{begins with the}} hand in first position, that is, with the left-hand covering frets 1–4. Beginning players first learn open <b>chords</b> belonging to the major keys C,G, andD. Guitarists who play mainly open <b>chords</b> in these three major-keys and their relative minor-keys (Am,Em,Bm) may prefer standard tuning over an M3tuning. In particular, hobbyists playing folkmusic around a campfire are well served by standard tuning. Such hobbyists may also play major-thirds tuning, which also has many open <b>chords</b> with notes on five or six strings; <b>chords</b> with five-six strings have greater volume than <b>chords</b> with three-four strings and so are useful for acoustic guitars (for example, acoustic-electric guitars without amplification).|$|E

5|$|Having exactly three pitch {{classes for}} its open notes (for example {C,E,G}), each major-thirds tuning repeats every note {{in a higher}} octave, because guitars have six strings. Being regular, M3 tunings repeat each note after two strings: this {{repetition}} simplifies the learning of <b>chords</b> and improvisation. Chord inversion is especially simple in major-thirds tuning. <b>Chords</b> are inverted simply by raising one or two notes three strings. The raised notes are played with the same finger as the original notes.|$|E

2500|$|The {{notes of}} a <b>chord</b> form {{intervals}} {{with each of}} the other notes of the <b>chord</b> in combination. [...] A 3-note <b>chord</b> has 3 of these harmonic intervals, a 4-note <b>chord</b> has 6, a 5-note <b>chord</b> has 10, a 6-note <b>chord</b> has 15. [...] The absence, presence, and placement of certain key intervals plays a large part in the sound of the <b>chord,</b> and sometimes of the selection of the <b>chord</b> that follows.|$|R
2500|$|If the 9th is omitted, the <b>chord</b> is {{no longer}} an {{extended}} <b>chord,</b> but an added tone <b>chord</b> (see below). Without the 3rd, this added tone <b>chord</b> becomes a 7sus4 (suspended 7th <b>chord).</b> For instance: ...|$|R
5000|$|In music, tonicization is the {{treatment}} of a pitch other than the overall tonic (the [...] "home note" [...] of a piece) as a temporary tonic in a composition. In Western music that is tonal, the song or piece is heard by the listener as being in a certain key. A tonic <b>chord</b> has a dominant chord; in the key of C major, the tonic <b>chord</b> is C major and the dominant <b>chord</b> is G major or G dominant seventh. The dominant <b>chord,</b> especially {{if it is a}} dominant seventh, is heard by Western composers and listeners familiar with music as resolving (or [...] "leading") to the tonic, due {{to the use of the}} leading note in the dominant <b>chord.</b> A tonicized <b>chord</b> is a <b>chord</b> other than the tonic <b>chord</b> to which a dominant or dominant seventh <b>chord</b> progresses. When a dominant <b>chord</b> or dominant seventh <b>chord</b> is used before a <b>chord</b> other than the tonic, this dominant or dominant seventh <b>chord</b> is called a secondary dominant. When a <b>chord</b> is tonicized, this makes this non-tonic <b>chord</b> sound temporarily like a tonic <b>chord.</b>|$|R
5|$|The chord pattern differs little {{throughout}} the song. On guitar, {{it consists of}} the <b>chords</b> (played with a capo at the fifth fret) of B minor 7, F minor, A minor 7, F, C, E sus. 7 and E7. A variation from this sequence occurs during the repeated last line of each second verse, {{with the addition of}} the <b>chords</b> D7/F and F major 7.|$|E
5|$|Each major-thirds tuning repeats its open-notes {{after every}} two strings, {{which results in}} two copies of the three open-strings' notes, each in a {{different}} octave. This repetition again simplifies the learning of <b>chords</b> and improvisation. This advantage is not shared by two popular regular-tunings, all-fourths and all-fifths tuning.|$|E
5|$|In Five Songs (1956–57) and Musique funèbre (1958) Lutosławski {{introduced}} his {{own brand of}} twelve-tone music, marking his departure from the explicit use of folk music. His twelve-tone technique allowed him to build harmony and melody from specific intervals (in Musique funèbre, augmented fourths and semitones). This system also gave him the means to write dense <b>chords</b> without resorting to tone clusters, and enabled him to build towards these dense <b>chords</b> (which often include all twelve notes of the chromatic scale) at climactic moments. Lutosławski's twelve-note techniques were thus completely different in conception from Arnold Schoenberg's tone-row system, although Musique funèbre does happen {{to be based on}} a tone row. This twelve-note intervallic technique had its genesis in earlier works such as Symphony No. 1, and Paganini Variations.|$|E
5000|$|The thirds in a mixed third <b>chord,</b> also split-third <b>chord,</b> a <b>chord</b> that {{includes}} as its third both the {{major and minor}} third (for a <b>chord</b> on C: C-E-E-G), are usually separated by an octave or more. While a minor <b>chord</b> placed over a major <b>chord</b> of the same root (creating a tension of 9) is somewhat common, a major <b>chord</b> placed over a minor <b>chord</b> of the same root (creating a tension of 11) is not as commonplace. Examples of use of the split-third <b>chord</b> include [...] "Rock And Roll Music", Paul McCartney's [...] "Maybe I'm Amazed", and Jimi Hendrix Experience's [...] "Purple Haze" [...] (dominant seventh sharp ninth <b>chord).</b> Tonic dominant seventh <b>chord</b> with split third include Heatwave's [...] "Boogie Nights". It is [...] "suggested" [...] by the final note and <b>chord</b> of [...] "A Hard Day's Night".|$|R
25|$|By extension, {{standard}} <b>chord</b> notation {{allows for}} the expression of a <b>chord</b> built upon an interval of a minor third and a neutral third; i.e. C–E–G. Whereas a half-diminished seventh <b>chord</b> is achieved by diminishing only one of the two intervals needed to transform a minor seventh <b>chord</b> into a diminished seventh <b>chord,</b> a half-diminished <b>chord</b> without a seventh is thus achieved by only diminishing the fifth note halfway between a minor <b>chord</b> and a diminished <b>chord.</b> It would thus be noted as C, or more explicitly Cno7 to avoid confusion with a half-diminished seventh <b>chord.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The leading-tone seventh <b>chord</b> is half {{diminished in}} C major (B-D-F-A) and fully diminished in C minor (B-D-F-A). However, composers {{throughout}} the Common practice period often employed modal mixture {{when using the}} leading-tone seventh <b>chord</b> in a major key, allowing for the substitution of the half-diminished seventh <b>chord</b> for the fully diminished seventh <b>chord.</b> This mixture is commonly used when the leading-tone seventh <b>chord</b> is functioning as a secondary leading-tone <b>chord.</b> The leading-tone seventh <b>chord</b> contrasts with the subtonic seventh <b>chord</b> in that the subtonic has a flatted seventh (<b>chord</b> root): in C minor, B-D-F-A. The leading-tone seventh <b>chord</b> has a dominant function and {{may be used in}} place of V or V7 [...]|$|R
5|$|In each regulartuning, the musicalintervals are {{the same}} for each pair of {{consecutive}} strings. Other regular tunings include all-fourths, augmented-fourths, and all-fifths tunings.

5|$|For Marquee Moon, Verlaine {{and fellow}} guitarist Richard Lloyd {{abandoned}} contemporary punk rock's power <b>chords</b> {{in favor of}} rock and jazz-inspired interplay, melodic lines, and counter-melodies.
