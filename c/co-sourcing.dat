50|$|<b>Co-sourcing</b> is a {{business}} practice where a service is performed by staff from inside an organization and also by an external service provider. It can be a service performed in concert with a client's existing internal audit department. The scope of work may focus on one or more aspects of the internal audit function. <b>Co-sourcing</b> can serve to minimize sourcing risks, increase transparency, clarity and lend toward better control over the processes outsourced.|$|E
50|$|Examples of <b>co-sourcing</b> {{services}} are supplementing the in-house internal audit staff with specialized {{skills such as}} information risk management or integrity services, providing routine assistance to in-house auditing for operations and control evaluations in peak period activity and conducting special projects such as fraud investigation or plant investment appraisals. Another example of <b>co-sourcing</b> is outsourcing part of software development or software maintenance activities to an external organization, while keeping part of the development in-house. Other internal business activities such as HR and administrative tasks can also be co-sourced by employee leasing companies.|$|E

40|$|This article {{explored}} the perceptions on value added by internal audit functions (IAFs) of South African companies. Six attributes of value added by IAFs (including in-house, outsourced and <b>co-sourced</b> activities) were investigated: organizational status, staffing and work environment, {{the extent to}} which IAFs’ recommendations are implemented, risk assessments, internal audit services and performance measures. Data was gathered via questionnaires from the chief executive officers (CEOs) or the chief operating officers (COOs) or the chief financial officers (CFOs), audit committee chairpersons (CACs) as well as the chief audit executives (CAEs) of 30 large South African companies. The findings revealed that IAFs are perceived to add value. With reference to the attributes investigated, it was found that IAFs report to the CACs, recommendations of IAFs are implemented, IAFs are well managed and not exploited by other functions within the organization and IAFs add value with regard to risk. Given the evolution of internal audit in recent years and the different attributes used in the literature to measure value-adding IAFs, further research could be conducted to identify generally accepted value-added attributes for IAFs, including those in the public sector...|$|R

In this method, glycerin {{was used as}} a stabilizing agent replacing tri-n-octylphosphine oxide (TOPO). Water solution of Na 2 SeO 3 in polyethylene glycol was utilized as Se source. 3 -Mercaptopropionic acid (MPA) provides S source. The phosphine-free Se and S sources were found to be highly reactive and suitable for the synthesis of CdSeS nanocrystals. XRD and HRTEM images confirm the formation of CdSeS nanocrystals in zinc blende structure. The absorption peaks on UV-vis spectra of as-prepared CdSeS nanocrystals are tunable from 330 nm to 440 nm, which blue shifts to shorter wavelength side in comparison with that of pure CdSe nanocrystals. The cubic CdSeS nanocrystals demonstrate narrow PL emissions spectra between 464 and 615 nm. Transmission electron microscopy images show the uniformity for the size distribution of the ternary QDs.

40|$|Lean, as a philosophy, {{has been}} around for quite some time, {{predominantly}} in the manufacturing domain. Since the 1990 s Lean management provides organizations with a way to achieve superior performance by focusing on customer value, innovation and productivity. In 2011 Steven Bell and Michael Orzen comprehensively addressed Lean IT in their groundbreaking publication, and showed that Lean provides an effective and efficient way to do more with less, while achieving higher levels of productivity, quality, customer satisfaction and as a result, competitive advantage. Over the past years many large users of IT have outsourced or <b>co-sourced</b> their IT supply and management services to professional IT service providers. Strategic sourcing models for IT and crafting strategic IT partnerships for the supply, management and use of IT have evolved over time and reached a satisfactory maturity level. At the same time, many IT sourcing relationships have become strategic in terms of intent and importance. To make the next leap, IT sourcing clients and their suppliers are now exploring whether a Lean transformation in their relationship could lead to similar promising results as achieved in the manufacturing domain. Managers who intend to embark on a Lean IT partnering journey, however, unfortunately lack any reference material available to guide them in implementing Lean on an IT partnership level. Courageous people who intend to lead the juggernaut task of Lean transformation in IT partnerships should read this book to gain a thorough understanding of the success factors of applying Lean in IT partnerships. It contains the results of the Nyenrode Lean Institute research project 'Lean IT partnering', conducted by the research cluster ‘Lean Transformation with and in IT’, and presents experienced barriers and drivers for victory. Additionally, it provides the lessons learned from actual case studies and postulates suitable guidelines for successful Lean IT partnerships: Craft an adequate partnering strategy, demonstrate Lean Leadership, and apply the appropriate Lean tools and techniques that fit naturally with the objectives sought for the IT partnership at hand...|$|R
40|$|This report summarises {{existing}} {{work on the}} Devonian source {{rocks and}} migrated oils in the Orcadian Basin. It aims to clarify the current literature {{with regards to the}} contribution of Devonian source rocks to proven hydrocarbon accumulations within the basin by providing a comprehensive summary of;  the quality and maturity of the lacustrine source rocks;  the evidence for Devonian oils in hydrocarbon fields, discoveries, shows and stains;  perceived risks for Devonian-sourced plays. Good quality oil-prone lacustrine source rocks are present in the Devonian both on- and offshore, and are believed to have <b>co-sourced</b> the three Inner Moray Firth oil fields – Beatrice, Lybster and Jacky. Thus an understanding of the distribution and burial history of the Devonian source rocks could be important in the search for new hydrocarbon discoveries in the region. The complex pre-, syn- and post-rift tectonic history has given rise to significant local variability in both the thickness of the Devonian section and the present-day thermal maturity. Offshore, determination of the extent of the Middle Devonian Orcadian Lake, the main source rock interval, is constrained by {{only a limited number of}} well penetrations of the Devonian interval centred on Quadrants 12 & 13, although an oil-correlation study by Robertson Research International (2001) suggested that Devonian source rocks may be developed as far east as Quadrant 15 and may therefore be more widespread than previously thought. Studies have shown that Devonian-sourced oils have some key characteristics meaning they can confidently be differentiated from Jurassic-sourced oils. In particular, the presence of carotane and gammacerane (which can both be indicative of hyper-saline depositional environments), the absence of C 28 -bisnorhopane (commonly found within Jurassic sourced oils), the relatively light carbon isotope ratios and depletion of C 27 steranes are distinguishing features when contrasted to Upper Jurassic to Middle Jurassic sourced hydrocarbons. Basin modelling studies suggest that onshore, the Devonian source rock experienced early hydrocarbon generation, reaching mid-late oil window thermal maturity by the Late Palaeozoic. Offshore, the preferred model is for Mesozoic generation with the onset of oil generation from the Devonian lacustrine source rocks in the Beatrice Field kitchen area in the Early Cretaceous, negating the need to invoke long-range migration from mature Jurassic mudstones to charge the Beatrice structure. This report was completed before the Palaeozoic Project organic geochemistry work on the Orcadian area (Vane et al., 2016), to inform the scope of work on that study. As such, it does not integrate the results of the Palaeozoic organic geochemistry study. This report contains citations of donated proprietary and commercial reports...|$|R

40|$|M. Comm. Corporate {{governance}} {{has become}} {{an important part of}} doing business today, especially {{in the aftermath of the}} massive corporate failures that have occurred in the recent past. Corporate governance legislation and corporate social responsibilities have placed pressure on companies to implement an internal audit function within their organisations. As such boards of directors (boards) have to decide whether they should incur the cost internally by implementing an in-house internal audit function and thereby employing more resources or pay an outsourced service provider to perform this function. This study looks at the fundamental considerations that should be taken into account in determining whether outsourcing the internal audit (IA) function will adequately and effectively address this obligation. Fundamental considerations that should be taken into account in assessing and evaluating the alternative of outsourcing the IA function were formulated on the basis of the literature review performed. Subsequent to this relevant questions associated with these fundamental considerations were formulated. These questions boards or those charged with corporate governance should be focused on in assessing and evaluating the alternative of outsourcing the IA function. The fundamental considerations and relevant questions were then analysed by means of semi-structured interviews to access the validity and appropriateness of these fundamental considerations and relevant questions. The study concludes that the fundamental considerations formulated and relevant questions are valid and appropriate in assisting organisations in deciding on the most effective and efficient manner in which to staff their internal audit function and thereby comply with corporate governance legislation and corporate social responsibilities. Most interviewees believed that a degree of <b>co-sourcing</b> or partial outsourcing was the most beneficial practice in general.

40|$|Irradiating T- 47 D {{cells with}} doses below 1 Gy {{revealed}} that cells of this line express hyper-radiosensitivity (HRS). In {{the present study}} HRS has been investigated when a challenge dose was given 6 or 24 hours after a priming dose delivered with varying dose-rates. In addition {{the effect of a}} challenge dose to T- 47 D cells that had been pre-irradiated for several months by incorporated tritium was investigated. A 60 <b>Co-source</b> at the Radium Hospital was used for all irradiations. It was chosen to give a fixed priming dose of 0. 3 Gy, but dose-rates were varied between 0. 045 Gy/h, 0. 32 Gy/h, 0. 9 Gy/h or high dose-rate (HDR) of 1 Gy/min. Immediately after the priming exposure, the cells were trypsinized and seeded in small flasks (25 cm 2) and incubated for 6 or 24 hours before they received the HDR challenge doses. DNA histograms revealed that the T- 47 D cells in the cell culture used in the experiments with priming exposures of 0. 32 and 0. 045 Gy/h and also in one of the experiments with HDR priming, had been mixed with cells of another stemline. The mixed cell culture (denoted T- 47 Dmix) was also used in the experiment with incorporation of tritium into T- 47 d cells, but in this case it was found from DNA histograms that only the control cells were mixed, but that the cultures exposed to protracted low dose-rate (LDR) irradiation consisted of only T- 47 d cells. Investigations were made that suggested that the cells mixed into the T- 47 D cells were of the line NHIK 3025. The following was observed from the experiments: T- 47 D cells clearly express both HRS/IRR and the adaptive response in the low-dose range (below 1 Gy). NHIK 3025 cells do not express HRS/IRR. T- 47 D cells that had been pre-irradiated by tritium-decay electrons did not express HRS/IRR. T- 47 D cells with functional pRb adapted to the continuous irradiation with electrons from incorporated tritium, while the putative NHIK 3025 cells without functional pRb were eradicated by the same treatment. When priming doses were delivered with the lowest dose-rates used (i. e. 0. 32 Gy/h and 0. 045 Gy/h) the priming effect as measured 6 hours following the termination of the priming exposure seemed to be larger than when the priming dose was delivered with higher dose-rates (i. e. HDR or 0. 9 Gy/h). 24 hours after the priming doses delivered with 0. 32 Gy/h and 0. 045 Gy/h, HRS was still absent (perhaps even further reduced), while 24 hours after a HDR priming dose HRS was partially restored. These results led to speculations concerning: The influence of micro-environmental conditioning effects on the radiation response of NHIK 3025 cells that are growing in a mixed culture with T- 47 D cells under conditions that would normally be lethal for NHIK 3025 cells. An alternative theory for HRS/IRR in which it is assumed that the repair processes of the cell are permanently induced. When radiation damages are so small, that the tissue as a whole would profit from cell suicide relative to repair with the danger of mis-repair, the repair processes are subdued by apoptosis. The involvement of pRb in the suppression of apoptosis of the alternative theory for HRS/IRR and in the adaptation of T- 47 D cells to continuous irradiation by decay electrons from incorporated tritium. The possibility that there are two different regulation pathways for induction of the cell-protective mechanisms that reduce HRS after pre-irradiation: One that is dose dependent, instantly induced by HDR irradiation but not by LDR irradiation, and which induces short-lasting mechanisms. Another pathway that works over time and is induced by LDR and probably also by HDR irradiation. The effect and duration of the mechanisms induced by this late-responding pathway depends on the duration of exposure...|$|R

These reports aimed at {{restoring}} checks and balances in companies to prevent fraudulent behaviour and restore public trust. One of the functions active in many organizations is Internal Audit. This function operates under the umbrella of the Management Board and is geared towards monitoring lower level management. Due to the Corporate Governance reports the interest in the work of internal auditors has increased. In many reports special attention is paid to this function. The Supervisory Board and the Audit Committee are required to oversee the activities and results of external as well as internal auditors. Furthermore, regulators are also keen on the results of their work. The aim {{of this study was to}} research the impact of Corporate Governance reports on the role, position, and scope of services of the Internal Audit Function. Agency Theory and Transaction Cost Economics were applied to further theory around internal auditing. Information asymmetry and asset specificity were used to test whether there was a correlation between high scores on information asymmetry and/or asset specificity for the organization and the size of an Internal Audit Function, the ‘make or buy’ issue, or its scope of services. Results showed that such was the case for the size but not for the ‘make or buy issue or the scope of services. Furthermore, this study contains descriptive characteristics of internal audit functions. Financiële schandalen in het afgelopen decennium hebben geleid tot een stroom aan Corporate Governance rapporten. Deze rapporten hadden tot doel om de beheersingsmaatregelen te versterken en daarmee het vertrouwen van het maatschappelijk verkeer te herstellen. Een van de functies actief in organisaties is Internal Audit. Deze functie opereert onder de hoede van de Raad van Bestuur/Directie en is gericht op het monitoren van het management onder de Raad van Bestuur/Directie. Dankzij die Corporate Governance rapporten is de belangstelling voor het werk van internal auditors toegenomen. In vele rapporten wordt ook aandacht besteed aan deze functie. De Raad van Commissarissen en het Audit Committee worden geacht toe te zien op het functioneren van zowel externe als internal auditors. Ook regelgevers en toezichthouders zijn geïnteresseerd in de resultaten van hun werk. Het doel van deze studie was na te gaan wat de invloed is van de Corporate Governance rapporten op de rol, positie en taakopdracht van de Internal Audit Functie. Agency Theory en Transaction Cost Economics zijn gebruikt om de theorie rondom internal auditing te versterken. Information asymmetry en asset specificity zijn gebruikt om te testen of er een correlatie bestaat tussen hoge scores voor information asymmetry en/of asset specificity van de organisatie en de omvang van de Internal Audit functie, het in- of uitbestedingsvraagstuk en de taakopdracht. De resultaten toonden aan dat dit wel het geval was voor de omvang maar niet voor het in- of uitbestedingsvraagstuk, noch de taakopdracht.

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this {{research}} is to investigate if and how the internal auditing (IA) profession and practitioners exercise ingenuity to deal with the constraints faced by them during the development of IA and implementation of IA activities at the societal and organizational level. The key aim is to explore whether, through exercising ingenuity, the Institute of Internal Auditors (IIA) and IA functions can strengthen and improve IA quality and effectiveness {{in order to meet the}} expectations of management, key stakeholders and the changing role of IA, in order to remain relevant and to survive in the challenging environmental conditions. The data for the study was collected and analysed at both societal and organizational levels, including how they interact each other. The theoretical approach employed in this research offers a valuable lens on the relationship between ingenuity, ingenious strategies and constraints. This theoretical framework offers a way to understand how constraints at societal and organizational levels can be resolved over time as IA evolves. The results of this study found three main constraints: the continuously changing IA role; insufficient resources and capabilities; and low IA status and quality. These led to five main ingenuity strategies that emerged at the societal and organizational levels, such as the use of Risk-Based Internal Auditing (RBIA), <b>co-sourcing,</b> talent management, the continuous improvement of IPPF, and forging collaborative partnerships between internal auditing and risk management. These strategies enable the IIA to improve the quality and effectiveness of IA and assist IA functions to tackle the constraints they face, exercise activities that improve organization operations, and add more value to organizations. This study takes the initiative to categorize ingenious solutions according to types of ingenuity and constraint. The findings of this study (see Chapter 7, 8 and 9) also show that constraints can motivate the IA profession and its practitioners to identify and exercise ingenious practices and become a source for creativity and innovative problem-solving...|$|E
40|$|Insourcing, {{outsourcing}} and <b>co-sourcing</b> {{are three}} approaches to procuring an information system. This research {{contributes to the}} body of knowledge on insourcing an information system; exploring and discussing the enabling and inhibiting factors of the insourcing of an information system in selected government agencies in Malaysia. This study was undertaken in response to a paucity of similar projects and a limited literature focused on developing countries. It considers the post outsourcing context following the decision to insource a major Malaysian Government Information System in 2011. A qualitative research method was used to obtain empirical evidence from selected government agencies through 69 semi-structured interviews in two data collection periods: 2013 - 2014 and 2015. Interviews were conducted with civil servants at all levels, from senior management to clerical staff, including users of the government information system. By using coding principles from grounded theory to analyse the data, seven exciters and six inhibitors of insourcing a government information system were identified and mapped in the analytical framework. Further, this is the first research to use an enhanced model, devised by combining the OPTIMISM model and two distinct theoretical traditions: institutional theory and the capability approach; in order to analyse the insourcing of government information system adoption. The enhanced model was created by mapping the OPTIMISM model (that has a set of dimensions) to an analytical framework comprising the capability approach, institutional theory and technology (ICTs). The main research contribution of this thesis is in the area of capacity building of the internal development team. The increased budget for training, the selection of appropriate training providers and knowledge sharing among experienced and novice developers all contribute to building capacity in the internal development team; and consequently help {{to improve the quality of}} the system which will improve service delivery to the general public. The approach and findings of this study contribute {{to the body of}} knowledge and understanding of the subject in government information system development and implementation, and can also be applied to improving the quality of service delivery. While this study has focused on government information systems, the wider area of eGovernment, and applications serving the needs of the general public, is equally important, and therefore the researcher suggests that insourcing eGovernment applications would also assist in the capacity building of internal IT staff...|$|E
40|$|This report synthesises {{the results}} of the 21 CXRM Palaeozoic project to {{describe}} the Carboniferous and Devonian petroleum systems of the Orcadian Basin to Forth Approaches area (Quadrants 6 – 21). Petroleum systems of the Orcadian study area that involve significant Palaeozoic elements are not wholly contained within Devonian, Carboniferous and Permian strata. A number of producing fields attest to two main proven petroleum systems; i. Co-sourced Devonian oil (with Jurassic oil) within a Jurassic reservoir: the Beatrice, Jacky and Lybster fields; ii. Jurassic-sourced oil in a Devonian and/or Carboniferous reservoir: the Buchan, Stirling, Claymore, Highlander fields. (Jurassic-sourced oil in a Permian (Zechstein) reservoir is also proven in the Carnoustie, Ettrick and Claymore fields, and in a Rotliegend reservoir in the Dee discovery). A number of additional unproven petroleum system elements are considered in this report; i. Possibilities for Devonian and Carboniferous sourcing or <b>co-sourcing</b> (with Jurassic oil) of Devonian, Carboniferous and Permian (Rotliegend) reservoirs in those areas underlain by proven Palaeozoic source rock; ii. Possibilities for migrated Jurassic and/or Devonian and/or Carboniferous hydrocarbons onto horst blocks and the regional Grampian High, into basement, Palaeozoic or younger reservoirs. Focusing on frontier areas north and east of the Inner Moray Firth and from the north-eastern Forth Approaches to Grampian High, integration of a large volume of seismic, well, geophysical, organic geochemistry, maturity and reservoir property data at regional scale has established: Source rocks  A wide extent of potential Devonian lacustrine source rocks mapped seismically from the Inner Moray Firth to the East Orkney Basin and north of the Halibut Horst.  Geochemically-typed Devonian-sourced oil shows, oil seep data outside the area of mature Kimmeridge Clay Formation, burial depth and a limited organic geochemistry/maturity dataset indicative of Devonian source rocks that are potentially mature for oil generation outside the Inner Moray Firth.  Good quality gas- and oil-prone Carboniferous source rocks are mapped from the Witch Ground Graben to north eastern end of the Forth Approaches. Wells drilled on highs indicate oil-window thermal maturity levels. Oil and gas shows and basin modelling indicate Carboniferous strata buried more deeply in adjacent basins may reach gas maturity levels, with Cenozoic maturation.  Key source rock intervals are: o Lower Devonian, lacustrine Struie Formation (Quadrants 11, 12), oil prone. o Middle Devonian, lacustine Orcadia Formation and Eday Group (Quadrants 11 - 15 and possibly Quadrants 19, 20), oil prone. o Visean – Namurian (lower-mid Carboniferous) fluvio-deltaic Firth Coal Formation, gas and oil prone.

40|$|A key {{focus of}} this thesis is if {{migrated}} bitumen from Lower to Middle Jurassic and Cretaceous age sandstones in the 6609 / 11 - 1, 6610 / 7 - 1 and the 6609 / 5 - 1 wells in the Helgeland Basin might originate from Devonian source rock strata. For a possible comparison of source rock facies has nine outcrop samples collected from the Orkneys been used alongside with the Beatrice oil from Moray Firth as references of the lacustrine Middle Devonian organofacies present in the Orcadian Basin, Also, oils from the Judy Field and the Embla Field were included in this investigation as their geochemical signature differs from the typical Kimmeridge derived oils on the Norwegian Shelf, which {{in this study is}} represented by the NSO- 1 oil i. e. oil from the Oseberg Field. Analytical methods i. e. GC-FID and GC-MS were used to generate characterization parameters used for indicating the maturity and also the type of organofacies of bitumen samples and the oil samples. In addition, TOC and Rock-Eval analysis were performed on the source rock samples for assessing the quality i. e. the kerogen type and the generative potential, and also for obtaining additional maturity information. Based on the TOC and Rock-Eval analysis, the HI of the five highest quality source rocks samples is in the range of 313 mg HC/g TOC to 397 mg/ HC/g TOC and those values corresponds to type II kerogen and the overall generative potential of the same five samples is categorized as good to very good, i. e. the TOC values in the range of 1. 48 wt. % to 2. 79 wt. %. The four other samples scores lower in both quality and/or generative potential. Of the nine source rock samples in total, only one scores below the minimum criteria for being categorized as a source rock, i. e. a TOC value of at least 0. 5 wt%. All the three wells i. e. 6609 / 11 - 1, 6610 / 7 - 1 and 6609 / 5 - 1 from which the bitumen bitumen samples studied in this thesis were isolated show evidence of having received migrating oils from a source rock that correlates with the geochemistry of the lacustrine Middle Devonian source rocks of the general Orcadian Basin source rock facies. In particular is the positive identification of β-carotane in the 6609 / 11 - 1, 6610 / 7 - 1 and 6609 / 5 - 1 wells of the highest interest as this biomarker is a type component for the Devonian lacustrine systems. It is thus concluded that there are Devonian source rock systems present in the Helgeland Basin which are of sufficient magnitude to generate and migrate oil into the studied sandstones which are of Early to Middle Jurassic and Cretaceous age. In addition to oil from the likely Middle Devonian source rock, well 6609 / 11 - 1 also contains migrated oil from a terrestrially derived source rock and the upper section in well 6610 / 7 - 1 (depth 2661 m to 2668. 5 m) and also well 6609 / 5 - 1 contains migrated bitumen (oil) which is clearly sourced form a marine derived source, i. e. the Late Jurassic Kimmeridge equivalent. The bitumen samples in the lower section of well 6610 / 7 - 1 (depth 2713. 8 to 2715 m) bears no resemblance of influence from lacustrine Middle Devonian source rocks, but are interpreted to have been sourced mainly from terrestrially derived source rocks, and there is also indications for <b>co-sourcing</b> from the Late Jurassic Kimmeridge equivalent source rocks. Furthermore, oils representing the Embla Field, the Judy Field and the Oseberg Field, are interpreted to have been mixed in the reservoir with petroleum from a lacustrine Middle Devonian source rock equivalent. Also this is totally new information as such has never been described, and it is inferred that such palaeo-oil must have escaped from the Oseberg Field reservoir and the Judy Field reservoirs long before the arrival of the present oil charges. It is thus inferred that also in the drainage areas of Oseberg, Embla and Judy are the Devonian basins which have generated oil. Concerning the maturity, the source rock bitumen samples from the Orkneys are considered marginally mature, and the Helgeland Basin bitumen samples, the Judy oil, the Beatrice oil and the Oseberg oil are considered to be at maturity levels which corresponds {{to the middle of the}} oil window. The Embla oil is highly mature, with a maturity level corresponding to the later part of the oil window. The maturity from the lowest to the highest is as follows: The source rock bitumen samples from the Orkneys - NSO- 1 (Oseberg) - Beatrice - 6609 / 11 - 1 - Judy - 6610 / 7 - 1 upper section - 6610 / 7 - 1 lower section - 6609 / 5 - 1 - Embla...|$|E
