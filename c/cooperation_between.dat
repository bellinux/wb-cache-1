5|$|After the Second World War {{was officially}} {{concluded}} with the capitulation of the Empire of Japan, plans for trying the major German and Japanese war criminals were quickly implemented in 1946. While Japanese officials {{had to face}} the Tokyo Trials, major German war crimes were dealt with at the Nuremberg Trials. Here it was the goal of the Allied prosecutors to portray the limited <b>cooperation</b> <b>between</b> the Third Reich and Imperial Japan as a long-planned conspiracy to divide the world among the two Axis-partners and thereby delivering just another demonstration of the common viciousness expressed by alleged joint long-term war plans. According to modern historic research, however, such a conspiracy did not exist and is considered Allied propaganda. Although there was a limited and cautious military <b>cooperation</b> <b>between</b> Japan and Germany during the Second World War, no documents corroborating any long-term planning or real coordination of military operations of both powers exist.|$|E
