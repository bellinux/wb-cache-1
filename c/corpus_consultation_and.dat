40|$|Collaborative {{learning}} has been increasingly incorporated into learners' corpus consultation {{as a type}} of pedagogic mediation. However, studies found that collaborative {{learning has}} negative aspects as it may cause conflicts and power inequality among members. Given the two sides of collaboration, this study provides a critical investigation on the functions of collaboration in learners' corpus consultation. Through two collaborative corpus analysis sessions, three students of different L 2 proficiency levels assisted each other’s understanding of corpus data to complete group activities. The students’ verbal and nonverbal behaviors during corpus analysis became the main source of investigation, complemented by the results of pre-/post-interviews and the researcher's direct observations. The findings {{of this study suggest that}} collaboration creates significant power inequality among the participants by gradually marginalizing the less capable student in the group from the learning process and increasing the psychological burden for the most capable student. In addition, collaborative work during corpus consultation could impede critical learning opportunities for individual students to pursue personal queries during collaboration. Despite some limitations, the findings of this study provide a realistic picture of collaboration in learners’ <b>corpus</b> <b>consultation</b> <b>and</b> suggest pedagogical implications to corpus-based instruction...|$|E
40|$|International audienceCorpora are {{attributed}} with considerable potential for language learning and teaching, yet the uptake in mainstream teaching practice remains surprisingly limited. In this talk I will briefly review empirical {{research in the}} field, before focusing on the specific case of France, where such corpus use retains a particularly low profile {{for a variety of}} reasons. My own research in French higher education covers a range of issues. Apart from the obvious questions of how French learners react to <b>corpus</b> <b>consultation</b> <b>and</b> whether it ‘works' in terms of immediate learning outcomes, it is relevant to consider longer term benefits, and how different presentations (e. g. hands-on, paper-based) can be used in different contexts (in class, in the computer room, in distance programmes) and for different purposes (not just for learning the language, but also as a reference resource, for translation, and across other areas of study such as literature and civilisation), as well as for different types of learners (in terms of language ability, learning styles, and specialisation). In all cases, my main aim has been {{to make use of the}} most accessible tools (general purpose, free on-line) and the simplest techniques so that students can, if they wish, continue using corpora on their own after completing the courses. Few would argue that corpora provide miracle solutions in all cases, and individual studies tend to be mitigated in their results – inevitably so, given the infinite number of variables involved. However, the picture that emerges from the research as a whole suggests there are grounds for optimism, and that the multiple affordances of language corpora means that they have something to offer for most teachers and learners...|$|E
40|$|An {{increasing}} {{number of studies have}} looked at the value of corpus-based data-driven learning (DDL) for second language (L 2) written error correction, with generally positive results. However, a potential conundrum for language teachers involved in the process is how to provide feedback on students’ written production for DDL. The study looks at DDL-mediated error correction across 61 written samples submitted by 32 tertiary students during a series of short DDL courses. Teachers provided feedback on errors present in the samples, and students highlighted corrections made with or without the corpus. The results suggest that students used corpora to correct errors of word choice, word form, collocations and phrasing, but were less likely to use corpora to correct errors of deletion or morphosyntax. When the corpus was used, students were likely to successfully correct errors of collocation but were less successful for errors of morphosyntax. Post-course questionnaires suggested that perception of the usefulness of DDL for grammar learning was less than that for vocabulary and the learning of phrases, and that time and effort spent on analyzing concordance data and understanding the teacher 2 ̆ 7 s feedback on their writing were perceived as difficulties. To explore these findings further, a qualitative analysis of the feedback teachers provided suggests significant difficulties devising appropriate feedback that promotes autonomous, inductive language acquisition for all error types on the one hand, {{and at the same time}} does not eliminate the need for corpus consultation nor is too vague for students to formulate appropriate corpus queries. This study is therefore an initial yet important step in identifying the type of errors that teachers can address in a timely manner with focused feedback leading to <b>corpus</b> <b>consultation,</b> <b>and</b> how such feedback affects the success of this consultation...|$|E
40|$|Most {{scholars}} {{agree on}} considering corpora {{as a valuable}} source of linguistic information for native and non-native speakers alike. Few researchers, however, have dealt with and systematically analysed the objective difficulties encountered by students while trying to exploit corpus data. The current paper describes a quantitative study of <b>corpus</b> <b>consultation</b> by learners <b>and</b> aims to establish whether different corpus analysis tasks can be considered to have different degrees of intrinsic difficulty. To this end, 26 corpus project work assignments produced by two different groups of students were assessed and tagged according to specific parameters that reflect the skills needed in corpus analysis. The data were analysed applying both parametric (ANOVA) and non parametric tests (Mann-Whitney U-test), which showed that, despite clear individual and teaching/learning environment {{differences between the two}} groups of students, the students’ results in most of the tasks were due to different levels of intrinsic difficulty. This led to the creation of a General Difficulty List of Corpus Analysis Tasks...|$|R
40|$|Alongside {{developments}} in language research, {{the potential of}} corpora as a resource in language learning and teaching has been evident to researchers and teachers since the late 1960 s. Despite publications which emphasise the benefits of <b>corpus</b> <b>consultation</b> for language learners (Bernardini, 2002; Kennedy & Miceli, 2001), {{there is little evidence}} to suggest that direct <b>corpus</b> <b>consultation</b> is coming {{to be seen as a}} complement or alternative to consultation of a dictionary, course book, or grammar by the majority of learners. There is thus a need for research to underpin the integration of corpora and concordancing in the language-learning environment. This study begins with an account of published research relating to course design and structure in the area of <b>corpus</b> <b>consultation</b> by language learners. The focus then narrows to the initial training of learners in <b>corpus</b> <b>consultation,</b> using as an example a course involving undergraduate students on several language degree programmes. The results of the students 2 ̆ 7 <b>consultation</b> of the <b>corpora</b> are examined, including choice of search word(s), analytical skills, the problems encountered, and their evaluation of the activity.

40|$|URL] This {{contribution}} {{reviews the}} idea of discovery learning with corpora, proposed in the 1990 s, evaluating its potential and its implications {{with reference to the}} education of translators today. The rationale behind this approach to data-driven learning, combining project-based and form-focused instruction within a socio-constructivistically inspired environment, is discussed. Examples are also provided of authentic, open-ended learning experiences, thanks to which students of translation share responsibility over the development of <b>corpora</b> <b>and</b> their <b>consultation,</b> <b>and</b> teachers can abandon the challenging role of omniscient knowledge providers and wear the more honest hat of "learning experts". Adding to the more straightforward uses of corpora in courses that aim to develop thematic, technological and information mining competences – i. e., in which training is offered in the use of corpora as professional aids –, attention is focused on foreign language teaching for translators and on corpora as learning aids, highlighting their potential {{for the development of the}} three other European Master's in Translation (EMT) competences (translation service provision, language and intercultural ones) ...|$|R
40|$|Although many {{researchers}} {{have shown the}} positive effects of teacher feedback on second language (L 2) writing, it is still unclear to what extent L 2 learners are able to self-correct their errors accurately in their revisions responding to indirect teacher feedback. Likewise, potential application of electronic corpora that improves L 2 writers 2 ̆ 7 writing skills has been explored over the past decade. However, there are only few empirical studies examining the effect of corpus consultation by L 2 learners on improved learning outcomes. ^ The present study investigated the role that corpus consultation plays in the correction of errors via four types of indirect feedback (uncoded indirect feedback only, coded indirect feedback only, uncoded indirect feedback with <b>corpus</b> <b>consultation,</b> <b>and</b> coded indirect feedback with corpus consultation) for lower level Japanese as Foreign Language (JFL) learners. It also examined whether the use of concordance program enhanced accuracy in writing, and whether any effects of indirect feedback with corpus consultation could be retained over a long-term period. Additionally, their perceptions and attitudes toward the corpus consultation were investigated. ^ The results indicated that, in terms of accuracy gain, uncoded/coded indirect feedback with the corpus consultation led to more accurate error correction than uncoded indirect feedback only. Likewise, from the short-term perspective, uncoded feedback with the corpus consultation was significantly more effective than uncoded/coded indirect feedback only. As to long-term effect, however, corpus consultation had a significant positive effect when uncoded indirect feedback was provided on the students 2 ̆ 7 writings. Overall, the JFL learners expressed positive attitudes toward the use of corpus and agreed that it was beneficial to improve their writing skills. In specific, as compared to traditional references such as a paper-based dictionary and a textbook, they felt that corpus consultation was more helpful. ...|$|E
40|$|Aside {{from their}} {{intrinsic}} {{value for the}} purposes of language description, corpora can be used in language courses under the broad umbrella term of "data-driven learning", or DDL (Johns 1990). They {{can be used as a}} teaching aid or learning tool, but also as a reference resource, particularly for writing and revision / error-correction, with an increasing body of empirical evidence (cf. Boulton in press) largely concerning students needing English for academic purposes. Corpora can also be used as a reference resource in translation, and here the DDL-related research focuses largely on translation trainees (e. g. Beeby et al. 2009). However, as Zanettin (2009) points out, translation is also a staple activity in many undergraduate language programmes where learners may also benefit from <b>corpus</b> <b>consultation,</b> <b>and</b> not just to help with the immediate translation assignment. The techniques involved build on many cognitive and metacognitive skills (O'Sullivan 2007), and once mastered, can be applied to other language courses and a variety of future language needs. The main research question in this paper is thus: Can general language corpora be used by non-translation students for translation purposes? The students in this study are enrolled in a translation course in the third year of a degree in English at the distance education centre of a French university. They have no prior experience of corpus use and are expected only to work only with freely available on-line monolingual corpora of contemporary English. The simple interface provided by Mark Davies ([URL] to large corpora of British and American English (100 million and 400 + million words respectively) is widely used for such purposes, with over two thirds of all users declaring their primary interest as language learning, teaching or translation. The sites are suitable for novice users to navigate and are accompanied by tutorials and help features; this is highly desirable in the distance teaching context where face-to-face input is not an option, and means that the course itself can keep the introduction to the basic concepts and techniques to a minimum. After that, the constraints of the distance context play to the strengths of constructivism as the students explore the corpora on their own; though email contact with the teacher is possible, and there are discussion forums to facilitate peer-to-peer collaboration, these are generally under-used. Following an earlier pilot study, the results presented here are based on on-line examinations where the methodology component requires the students to choose sections of a previously unseen text and demonstrate and explain how they use corpora to solve the problems encountered in context. Comparing data from two sessions shows how the students come to grips with corpora for translation, and allows a qualitative analysis of individual performance on the various techniques used with greater or lesser success. These data are backed up by questionnaires submitted after the examinations to gain feedback from both successful and less successful students. Particular attention is accorded to corpus use beyond the usual concordance lines, including frequencies, register distributions, collocates lists, word comparisons, and so on, which allow the learner to ask not just 'can I say this?', but 'is this appropriate in this translation context?'...|$|E
40|$|In {{the rapidly}} {{changing}} environment of language learning and teaching, electronic literacies have {{an increasingly important}} role to play. While much research on new literacies focuses on the World Wide Web, the aim {{in this study is}} to investigate the importance of <b>corpus</b> <b>consultation</b> as a new type of literacy which is of particular relevance in the context of language learning and teaching. After briefly situating the theoretical and pedagogical context of the study in relation to authenticity and learner autonomy, the paper describes an empirical study involving eight postgraduate students of French. As part of a Masters course they write a short text and subsequently attempt to improve it by using concordancing software to consult a small corpus containing texts on a similar subject. The analysis of the results reveals a significant number of changes made by the learners which may be classified as follows in order of frequency: grammatical errors (gender and agreement, prepositions, verb forms/mood, negation and syntax); misspellings, accents and hyphens; lexico- grammatical patterning (native language interference, choice of verb and inappropriate vocabulary); and capitalisation. The conclusion notes that the situation in which these students found themselves (i. e. faced with a text on which the teacher had indicated phrases which could be improved) is replicated in many cases every day, <b>and</b> suggests that <b>corpus</b> <b>consultation</b> may have a useful role to play in the context of interactive feedback, particularly in cases where traditional language learning resources are of little use.
