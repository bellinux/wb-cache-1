25|$|Activated carbon filters (AC filters) {{can be used}} {{to filter}} vodka and whiskey of organic {{impurities}} which can affect color, taste, and odor. Passing an organically impure vodka through an activated <b>carbon</b> <b>filter</b> at the proper flow rate will result in vodka with an identical alcohol content and significantly increased organic purity, as judged by odor and taste.|$|E
25|$|People {{who lived}} in the PFOA {{contaminated}} area around DuPont's Washington Works Washington, WV facility were found to have higher levels of PFOA in their blood from drinking water. The highest PFOA levels in drinking water were found in the Little Hocking water system, with an average concentration of 3.55 parts per billion during 2002–2005. Individuals who drank more tap water, ate locally grown fruits and vegetables, or ate local meat, were all associated with having higher PFOA levels. Residents who used water <b>carbon</b> <b>filter</b> systems had lower PFOA levels.|$|E
25|$|Visual {{inspection}} cannot {{determine if}} water is of appropriate quality. Simple procedures such as boiling {{or the use}} of a household activated <b>carbon</b> <b>filter</b> are not sufficient for treating all the possible contaminants that may be present in water from an unknown source. Even natural spring water – considered safe for all practical purposes in the 19th century – must now be tested before determining what kind of treatment, if any, is needed. Chemical and microbiological analysis, while expensive, are the only way to obtain the information necessary for deciding on the appropriate method of purification.|$|E

Some filters use more than one filtration method. An {{example of this is}} a multi-barrier system. Jug filters can be used for small quantities of drinking water.

40|$|Recently, {{there has}} been growing concern that {{microbial}} health hazards can be increased {{by the use of}} activated <b>carbon</b> <b>filters</b> in domestic water systems. The present study was undertaken to investigate the effect of <b>carbon</b> <b>filters</b> on the microbial content of water. Results indicated that the microbial content of filtered and unfiltered water increased to about the same level on overnight standing and, in both cases, was reduced by flushing the next day. In addition, the use of activated carbon for the filtration of contaminated well water over a period of 11 weeks had no effect on the total or coliform count. Under use conditions, activated <b>carbon</b> <b>filters</b> were found to have no significant effect on the number of bacteria present in the water...|$|R
2500|$|In 1917, Secretary of the Interior Franklin K. Lane, {{directed}} the Bureau of Mines {{to assist the}} Army and Navy in creating a gas war program.

Manning, formally offered the bureau's service to the Military Committee of the National Research Council, the council appointed a Subcommittee on Noxious Gases. Manning recruited chemists from industry, universities, and government to help study mustard-gas poisoning, investigate and mass-produce new toxic chemicals, and develop gas-masks and other treatments.|$|E
2500|$|West Virginia American Water {{was aware}} of the {{chemical}} spill by noon, but assumed that they could filter it.

This they did at 5:09p.m. West Virginia American Water concluded that its tap water was unsafe for use and instructed its customers to cease using its tap water at 5:45p.m. Freedom Industries failed to contact West Virginia American Water following the spill, and West Virginia American Water was instead notified by the DEP.|$|E

50|$|The Eliminator {{is a small}} {{suction fan}} with an {{activated}} <b>carbon</b> <b>filter</b> cartridge that is placed within the flush tank.
