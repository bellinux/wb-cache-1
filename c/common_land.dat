5|$|By 1875 {{encroachment}} on Malvern's wastelands by landowners {{had reached}} new heights and {{action was taken}} by the people of Malvern and the Commons Society to preserve the hills and <b>common</b> <b>land</b> and to prevent encroachment. Local lords of the manor indicated {{that they would like to}} give their rights to the wastes to the public. After preventing the enclosure of a common in 1882, negotiations were initiated with the owners of the northern hills and the first Malvern Hills Act was secured in parliament in 1884. Later Acts empowered the Malvern Hills Conservators to acquire land to prevent further encroachment on <b>common</b> <b>land</b> and by 1925 they had bought much of the manorial wastelands.|$|E
5|$|Agricultural {{improvement}} and the Industrial Revolution came to Aberdaron in the 19th century. The Inclosure (Consolidation) Act 1801 {{was intended to}} make it easier for landlords to enclose and improve <b>common</b> <b>land,</b> introduce increased efficiency, bring more land under the plough, and reduce the high prices of agricultural production. Rhoshirwaun Common, following strong opposition, was enclosed in 1814; while the process was not completed in Aberdaron, Llanfaelrhys and Y Rhiw until 1861. On the industrial front, mining developed as a major source of employment, especially at Y Rhiw, where manganese was discovered in 1827.|$|E

It includes Great Malvern on the steep eastern flank of the Malvern Hills, {{as well as the}} former independent urban district of Malvern Link. Many of the major suburbs and settlements that comprise the town are separated by large tracts of open <b>common</b> <b>land</b> and fields, and together with smaller civil parishes adjoining the town's boundaries and the hills, the built up area is often referred to collectively as The Malverns.|$|E

5000|$|This was an {{important}} test case for the government, for if the <b>common</b> <b>lands</b> of this grant were rejected, hundreds of thousands—perhaps millions—of acres of other community grant <b>common</b> <b>lands</b> not yet adjudicated would also belong to the government, not to the land grant heirs. ...holding that the <b>common</b> <b>lands</b> belonged {{to the government of}} the United States...

5|$|Unlike Sheriff Hill, Carr Hill and Low Fell, Deckham's {{history is}} sparsely recorded. It {{indicates}} that, {{by the middle}} of the 19th century, there was a small settlement which was part of Gateshead Fell; a wild and treacherous area of <b>common</b> <b>land</b> notable for the criminality of the tinkers and hawkers who lived there. Ordnance survey mapping illustrates the sparsity of buildings in 1860; the area contained little except Deckham Hall, a few other dwellings and two public houses at the point where the old turnpike road branched off towards Carr's Hill. The two public houses were the 'Speed the Plough' and 'The Ship'.|$|E
5|$|From the 16th century, the landowners {{were the}} Carre family, who {{operated}} tight {{control over the}} town, and it grew little in the early modern period. The manor passed from the Carre family to the Hervey family by the marriage of Isabella Carre to John Hervey, 1st Earl of Bristol, in 1688. The town's <b>common</b> <b>land</b> and fields were legally enclosed by 1794, giving ownership mostly to the Hervey family; this coincided with making the Slea into a canal, and heralded the first steps towards modern industry. The Sleaford Navigation brought economic growth until it was superseded by the railways in the mid-1850s. In the 20th century, the sale of farmland around Sleaford by Bristol Estates {{led to the development}} of large housing estates. The subsequent availability of affordable housing combined with the town's educational facilities and low crime rates made it an attractive destination for home-buyers. As a result, the town's population underwent the fastest growth of any town in the county in the 1990s.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the Christchurch Inclosures Act 1802, {{more than}} 70% of the Westover area was <b>common</b> <b>land.</b> The act, {{together}} with the Inclosure Commissioners' Award of 1805, transferred 5000 acres {{into the hands of}} five private owners, including James Harris, 1st Earl of Malmesbury, and Sir George Ivison Tapps. In 1809 the Tapps Arms public house appeared on the heath. A few years later, in 1812, the first official residents, retired army officer Lewis Tregonwell and his wife, moved into their new home built on land purchased from Tapps. The area was well known to Tregonwell who, during the Napoleonic wars, spent much of his time searching the heath and coastline for French invaders and smugglers.|$|E

5|$|The Fasci {{movement}} {{was made up}} of a federation of scores of associations that developed among farm workers, tenant farmers, and small sharecroppers as well as artisans, intellectuals, and industrial workers. The immediate demands of the movement were fair land rents, higher wages, lower local taxes and distribution of misappropriated <b>common</b> <b>land.</b> Between 1889 and 1893 some 170 Fasci were established in Sicily. According to some sources the movement reached a membership of more than 300,000 by the end of 1893. The Fasci constituted autonomous organizations with their own insignia (red rosettes), uniforms and sometimes even musical bands, and their own local halls for reunions and congresses. They were called Fasci (Fascio literally means bundle) because everyone can break a single stick, but no one can break a bundle of sticks.|$|E
5|$|The {{proposal}} {{to build a}} wind farm, in {{a joint venture between}} United Utilities and Peel Holdings, was announced in 2003. Shortly afterwards a pressure group, The Friends of Scout and Knowle Moor, was formed, and on 9 September 2003 representatives of the group attended a meeting of the Metropolitan Borough of Bury's, Ramsbottom and Tottington Area Board to oppose the plans. At the meeting, the spokesperson for the group said that, although they supported the use of alternative energy, they felt that this was the wrong area. Among the objections were that the scheme was contrary to the Unitary Development Plan and the Green Belt, and would adversely affect <b>common</b> <b>land,</b> open countryside and areas of ecological importance and special landscape value. The group also considered that the proposed development would be out of scale with the landscape, adversely affecting peat, water courses and wildlife, and would have a seriously detrimental visual impact, as well as causing a noise nuisance.|$|E
5|$|There was {{rivalry between}} the lords of the manor and borough. The {{lord of the}} manor complained in 1328 that the burgesses were holding private markets, from which he gained no revenue. The rivalry {{continued}} in the 16th century, with Bishop Stanley unsuccessfully challenging {{the right of the}} burgesses to hold markets, believing it should be the right of the lord of the manor. In 1583 the corporation of the borough attempted to usurp the lord of the manor by laying claim to the lordship. They did so because they felt they were fulfilling the duties of the lord: to improve waste and <b>common</b> <b>land</b> and allowing construction on this land, running courts, and mining coal. A compromise was reached, dividing some power between the two parties.|$|E

40|$|The authors {{explore the}} {{transformation}} of <b>common</b> <b>lands</b> in Spain {{in the second half}} of the 20 th Century, when the nation experienced significant structural and political changes. If the 19 th Century was defined by privatisation of <b>common</b> <b>lands,</b> the 20 th Century experienced slight growth, but there were differences among the regions. Although the legal definition and classification of <b>common</b> <b>lands</b> is fixed, and was determined by the municipal entity, new formulas (such as the montes vecinales en mano común regulated in 1968) appeared to solve the tension between the state and local control. Ultimately, flexibility was the main characteristic of the regulations which allowed for adapting uses to a diversity of regional circumstances. Along with the productive and environmental regulations, the use of <b>common</b> <b>lands</b> for social purposes through the distribution of plots for cultivation was emphasised. Nevertheless, at the end of the 20 th Century Spanish legislation concerning <b>common</b> <b>lands</b> was more focused on earlier norms than on the future.

5|$|An Enclosure Act is a {{parliamentary}} authority to fence-off <b>common</b> <b>land,</b> thus making that land private property, while awarding commoners land in compensation. Inclosure {{is the name}} given to the parliamentary statute thus created. The enclosure process began in the 13th century and was supported by Acts of Parliament from 1640. In November 1833, the Isle of Ely intended to apply for Acts of Parliament to enclose the lands of Little Thetford. Officials arrived in the village armed {{with nothing more than}} a notice to be pinned on the Church of England's St. George's church door, but were prevented from doing so by a dozen villagers. They returned later with ten constables, authorised by Ely magistrates, and were confronted this time by 150stick-wielding protesters, who continued to prevent due process. When the clergyman, Henry Hervey Baber, arrived the following afternoon, he was prevented from carrying out his normal Sunday service. Villagers may have rebelled against the church at this time, perhaps believing it was acting on behalf of the establishment in the enclosure acts. This event may have been the trigger that, five years later, encouraged a strong Baptist following amongst the poorer villagers. About half the total area of Little Thetford was eventually enclosed in 1844, seven years after that of Stretham.|$|E
5|$|Ashton Court {{dates back}} to before the 11th century. It is {{believed}} that a fortified manor stood on the site, given to Geoffrey de Montbray, Bishop of Coutances, by William the Conqueror. In the Domesday Book it {{is referred to as}} a wealthy estate owned by the Bishop of Countances, with a manor house, a great hall, and courtyards entered through gatehouses. The property passed through successive owners {{and at the end of}} the 14th century it was considerably expanded when Thomas De Lions, a nobleman originally from France, obtained a permit to enclose a park for his manor. The house was owned by the Choke family for some time. In 1506 it was sold to Sir Giles Daubeney, a knight and a Chamberlain of Henry VII. Henry VIII gave the estate to Sir Thomas Arundel in 1541 and four years later in 1545 Sir Thomas sold it to John Smyth. The Smyth family owned the property for the next 400 years. Smyth also bought the land which had been owned, until the Dissolution of the Monasteries, by Bath Abbey. He used the land to extend the deer park, bringing him into conflict with the residents of Whitchurch, who complained that he had used <b>common</b> <b>land.</b>|$|E
5|$|From {{an early}} age, Hobbs played cricket {{whenever}} he could. His first games were {{played in the}} streets near his house. He was educated at a primary school affiliated with his local Anglican church, St Matthew's, and moved in 1891 to York Street Boys' School, a fee-paying establishment; Hobbs later admitted to being a poor scholar but was successful at sports. He played cricket regularly for the St Matthew's choir team and the York Street school team, and during holidays helped his father at Jesus College. In his final year at York Street, to supplement the family budget, Hobbs took a job working before school hours in the domestic service of a private house. On leaving school in 1895, he worked as an errand boy until his father's connections at the university secured him a summer job as a college servant, chiefly assisting the cricket team. Aged 16, Hobbs became an apprentice gas fitter, and practised cricket on Parker's Piece, an open area of <b>common</b> <b>land</b> in Cambridge, in his spare time. He played for various local clubs but did not initially stand out as a cricketer: although better than most other Cambridge batsmen, no coaches or major teams approached him, and his batting gave little indication of the success which came later.|$|E

5|$|Historians {{have noted}} {{considerable}} political {{conflict in the}} burghs between the great merchants and craftsmen throughout the period. Merchants attempted to prevent lower crafts and gilds from infringing on their trade, monopolies and political power. Craftsmen attempted to emphasise their importance and to break into disputed areas of economic activity, setting prices and standards of workmanship. In the 15th century a series of statutes cemented the political position of the merchants, with limitations {{on the ability of}} residents to influence the composition of burgh councils and many of the functions of regulation taken on by the bailies. In rural society historians have noted a lack of evidence of widespread unrest similar to that evidenced the Jacquerie of 1358 in France and the Peasants' Revolt of 1381 in England, possibly because there was relatively little of the type of change in agriculture, like the enclosure of <b>common</b> <b>land,</b> that could create widespread resentment before the modern era. Instead a major factor was the willingness of tenants to support their betters in any conflict in which they were involved, for which landlords reciprocated with charity and support. Highland and border society acquired a reputation for lawless activity, particularly the feud. However, more recent interpretations have pointed to the feud as a means of preventing and speedily resolving disputes by forcing arbitration, compensation and resolution.|$|E

5|$|Lindow Moss is a {{peat bog}} in Lindow, {{an area of}} Wilmslow, Cheshire, which {{has been used as}} <b>common</b> <b>land</b> since the medieval period. It formed after the last ice age, one of many such peat bogs in {{north-east}} Cheshire and the Mersey basin that formed in hollows caused by melting ice. Investigations have not yet discovered settlement or agricultural activity around the edge of Lindow Moss that would have been contemporary with Lindow Man; however, analysis of pollen in the peat suggests there was some cultivation in the vicinity. Once covering over , the bog has now shrunk to a tenth of its original size. It is a dangerous place; an 18th-century writer recorded people drowning there. For centuries the peat from the bog was used as fuel, and it continued to be extracted until the 1980s, by which time the process had been mechanised. Lindow Moss is a lowland raised mire; this type of peat bog often produces the best preserved bog bodies, allowing more detailed analysis. Lowland raised mires occur mainly in northern England and extend south to the Midlands. Lindow Man is one of 27bodies to be recovered from such areas.|$|E

5|$|Parliamentary {{enclosures}} {{accounted for}} about 4.5 million acres {{of what had been}} open fields, not counting the enclosure of <b>common</b> <b>land</b> and wild 'waste'. In 1700 roughly half England's arable land was already enclosed; {{by the end of the}} enclosure process, almost all of it was. The revolution in the landscape began in about 1750, affecting about 3,000 parishes, especially in the English midlands. Between 1760 and 1800 there were 1,479 enclosure acts, covering 2.5 million acres; another 1.5 million acres were enclosed by 1844, by more than a thousand further acts. Some counties such as Kent, Essex and Devon were little affected, having largely been enclosed much earlier, often directly from forest or moorland. Many miles of new straight hedgerows were laid to mark out the newly enclosed fields of the midlands; in some areas such as Derbyshire, straight limestone walls were used instead. Many straight new roads were created at the same time. Farmhouses remained in the old villages at first, but new red-brick Victorian ones were often built in the middle of their now enclosed land in due course.|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{the coal}} mines of Wales and {{northern}} England, the Cornish mines generally {{did not provide}} housing for their workers, largely owing to the casual nature of work under the tribute team system. Bal maidens would typically travel to the mines from their family homes, some families building homes near the mine. (Until the Inclosure Acts of the late 18th and early 19thcenturies, anyone moving to an area {{had the right to}} build a house on <b>common</b> <b>land,</b> provided they could build it overnight.) They would generally remain living with their families until marriage. (Much of early 19thcentury Cornwall retained the old custom of 'keeping company', by which a couple would not be formally married until the woman became pregnant, and the woman would continue to work and to live with her family until that time.) While some lived at or near the mine at which they worked, mine workers typically walked three to four miles (five to sevenkm) to and from work each day. The miners' cottages were generally crowded and squalid, sometimes with ten or more people living in each small cottage, while the abstraction of the region's water supplies for use in the mines led to serious problems with sanitation and the provision of fresh water.|$|E
