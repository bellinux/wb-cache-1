50|$|Fistula clip closure (OTSC Proctology) is {{the latest}} {{surgical}} development, which involves {{the closure of the}} internal fistula opening with a superelastic clip made of nitinol (OTSC). During surgery, the fistula tract is debrided with a special fistula brush and the clip is transanally applied {{with the aid of a}} preloaded <b>clip</b> <b>applicator.</b> The surgical principle of this technique relies on the dynamic compression and permanent closure of the internal fistula opening by the superelastic clip. Consequently, the fistula tract dries out and heals instead of being kept open by continuous feeding with stool and fecal organisms. This minimally-invasive sphincter-preserving technique has been developed and clinically implemented by the German surgeon Ruediger Prosst. First clinical data of the clip closure technique demonstrate a success rate of 90% for previously untreated fistulae and a success rate of 70% for recurrent fistulae.|$|E
40|$|AbstractDespite {{technical}} and technological advances in Neurosurgery, {{in the last}} four decades, there has been no significant reduction, in the dimensions of the, aneurysm <b>clip</b> <b>applicator</b> forceps. This can be challenging, even to the most experienced neurovascular surgeon, especially when the surgical corridor created remains narrow, despite all possible measures to widen it. The author describes one such situation, where an anterior communicating artery aneurysm was clipped successfully using a simple “hemostat” forceps. The author describes {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} a hemostat forceps, when used as a <b>clip</b> <b>applicator.</b> He also explains how a “custom made” hemostat forceps, can overcome these pitfalls. The author concludes that, though a standard <b>clip</b> <b>applicator</b> forceps is the instrument of choice, to clip aneurysms, a “custom made” set of hemostat forceps can prove superior to conventional clip applicators, in select situations, where the surgical corridor is too narrow and the relatively large dimensions of the <b>clip</b> <b>applicator</b> itself, obliterates visibility of the local anatomy...|$|E

40|$|DE 102009025013 A 1 UPAB: 20110111 NOVELTY - The system (10) has an {{instrument}} storage (12) including storage chambers (16) to receive medical instruments (18). A tubular working channel (14) has a passage (24) {{to guide the}} instruments during interchanging. A proximal end (22) of the channel is connected with the chambers. A displacing device e. g. hydraulic displacing device, displaces the instruments between active and passive positions. A distal end (20) of the channel fixes the instruments in the active position. The storage is displaced relative to the channel so that each chamber is selectively connected with the channel. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is also included for a medical instrument comprising an adapter region. USE - Automatic interchange system for interchanging medical instruments such as laparoscopic instruments e. g. shears, tongs with or without coagulation function, high-frequency resectors, <b>clip</b> <b>applicators</b> and ultrasonic instruments, and laparoscopic optics (all claimed), which are used for minimal-invasive surgery at an abdominal wall of a patient. ADVANTAGE - The system allows a surgeon to use the optimal instrument suited for respective operation steps {{at any time during}} the operation, thus avoiding distraction of concentration of the surgeon while improving quality of the operation...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (MBA) -University of KwaZulu-Natal, Durban, 2003. This {{study was}} an {{investigation}} into the cost-effectiveness of using re-usable instrumentation in laparoscopic surgery. The model used for the study was the laparoscopic cholecystectomy which is the commonest laparoscopic procedure performed by the general surgeons. The study was done at KZNGOV Hospital in Kwazulu Natal, one of the largest tertiary hospitals in the province. The research done was both qualitative and quantitative. An exploratory study was conducted initially by drawing up the case study, and then quantitative and qualitative research was conducted to evaluate the use of re-usable instrumentation in laparoscopic surgery. In order to conduct a more focused design, the three most commonly used laparoscopic instruments were evaluated. These were the trocars (sizes 11. 0 mm and 5. 0 mm), the endoshears / scissors and the <b>clip</b> <b>applicators.</b> The study aimed to assess whether the use of the re-usable instruments was more cost-effective, whether their use in minimal access surgery was feasible, and whether the use of re-usable instrumentation compromised patient well-being. Information for the case study was obtained from the hospital notes of the patients who had a laparoscopic cholecystectomy at KZNGOV Hospital, and from interviews with experienced surgeons. The study found that the re-usable instrumentation used at KZNGOV Hospital had no adverse effects on the patients. The Department of Surgery and the theatre committee at this hospital have chosen an excellent and cost-effective protocol for laparoscopic surgery, and the choice of instrumentation cannot be faulted. Analysis of the results showed a large cost saving obtained by using the re-usable laparoscopic instrumentation, with no adverse patient outcomes...|$|R
50|$|In 1952 Frank Mayfield and George Kees, {{a medical}} illustrator, develop the Mayfield clip and clip applier, {{to shut off}} the blood supply to a brain aneurysm. Mayfield had the idea to develop a small, cross-legged <b>clip</b> and an <b>applicator</b> with tweezers-like dexterity to permit for {{trial-and-error}} placement of the clip across the neck of an aneurysm. The metal clip {{would have to be}} malleable enough so that it could be twisted into shape and still retain its spring recoil. If, after placement, the clip had to be removed, it could be accomplished by using the forceps as if it were tweezers.|$|R
40|$|Miniature {{photonic}} crystal fiber strain sensors with a typical size ~ 200 μm are fabricated and employed as force measurement sensors for a laparoscopic surgical device.

40|$|A {{feasibility}} study on using polymer fiber Bragg sensors (PFBG) for providing force feedback to minimally invasive surgical devices is carried out. For this purpose a 3 mm long PFBG is fabricated and characterized for strain and temperature sensitivities. The PFBG sensor is then integrated onto a commercial laparoscopic <b>clip</b> <b>applicator</b> {{which is used}} as a proof of concept device. The force characterization of the <b>clip</b> <b>applicator</b> is carried out, with a replica setup which simulates the clip forming process of the device. An original clip is then formed without and with synthetic tissue samples of different hardness. The replica device force profile and original clip forming force profile follows the same pattern and thus the calibration data can be used to calculate the original force exerting on the tissues which can help in optimizing the clip formation process or can be used for providing force feedback capability to the device...|$|E
30|$|Due to lack {{of access}} to the fallopian tubes, a 7.5 -mm Filshie <b>clip</b> <b>applicator</b> port was {{inserted}} at each LIF lateral to the rectus muscle {{to gain access to the}} ipsilateral fallopian tube.

40|$|Background: Surgery plus {{adjuvant}} radiotherapy {{is standard}} care for locally advanced prostatecancer (stage pT 3 R 1). Intraoperative low-energy photon radiotherapy offers several advantages overexternal beam radiotherapy, and several systems {{are now available}} for its delivery, using sphericalapplicators which require only limited shielding. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the feasibilityof this technique for the prostate bed. Materials & Methods: Applicators were assessed using MRI image data and cadavericdissection. In cadavers, targeted tissues, defined as a urethral section, both neurovascular bundlesections, the bladder neck and the beds of the seminal vesicles, were marked with metallic surgicalclips. Distances between <b>clips</b> and <b>applicator</b> were measured using CT. A dosimetric study of theapplication of 12 Gy at 5 mm depth was performed using CT images of prostatectomized cadavers. Results: Using MRI images from 34 prostate cancer patients, we showed that the ideal applicatordiameter ranges from 45 to 70 mm. Using applicators of different sizes to encompass the prostate bedin nine cadavers, we showed that the distance between target tissues and applicator was less than 2 mm for all target tissues except the upper extremity of the seminal vesicles (19 mm). Dosimetric studyshowed a good dose distribution in all target tissues in contact with the applicator, with a lowprobability of rectum and bladder complication. Conclusions: Intraoperative radiotherapy of the prostate bed is feasible, with good coverage oftargeted tissues. Clinical study of safety and efficacy is now required...|$|R
40|$|In {{the last}} 12 months, {{as an expert}} in {{pediatric}} laparoscopy and/or court-appointed technical consultant, I {{have been asked to}} give advice in five court actions: in 2 cases some pediatric surgeons had received a notification and in 3 cases a request for compensation for the complications that occurred during a pediatric laparoscopic operation. Starting from the investigation of those cases, we will make some useful observations as for medico-legal aspects of MIS in pediatric age, considering that there are few reports in literature on this topic. In all the 5 cases the surgeons were expert in pediatric laparoscopy. As concerns the prosecuted operations, in 2 cases the patients had been splenectomized in laparoscopy for splenomegaly of hematologic origin, in 1 case a patient had undergone orchidopexy due to intrabdominal testis, in 1 case a herniorraphy for groin hernia, and in another case a cholecystectomy due to idiopathic cholelithiasis. In all cases the surgeon was accused of performing the operation in laparoscopy instead of the required laparotomy. In particular, in all the cases there was the report made by the party’s surgeon—which had not been made by an expert in laparoscopic surgery—which underlined that the surgeon had run the further risk of operating the patient in laparoscopy and that anyway the operation would have been safer if performed in open surgery. Besides, the party’s medico-legal reports criticized the new laparoscopic devices used in some operations to produce hemostasis, such as the ultrasonic scalpel or the <b>clips</b> <b>applicator,</b> by assessing that those devices were not as reliable as the suture ligatures carried out in open surgery. Moreover, the patients’ parents said that they were not clearly informed by the surgeons, although all of them had signed the confirmed consent, and some parents said that itwas not the operating surgeon to show them the informed consent. From the technical point of view, in all cases we saw that the informed consents of the operations written by the surgeons were not very accurate as well as the description of the operation was too synthetic, summed up in few lines without the details necessary to defend the surgeon. Probably, considering the ever-increasing number of lawsuits for compensation against surgeons, it is crucially important that the operating surgeon should verbally inform the patient’s parents at least 24 hours before the operation and then make them sign the informed consent. The presence of a witness—who is going to sign the consensus too—on signing the consent can be an useful device to attest that the surgeon has given a correct and complete information to the patient’s parents. Of extreme importance are the attention and the greatest accuracy of the surgeon in giving {{a detailed description of the}} surgical operation in the registry of operations also in routine operations, such as inguinal hernia, impalpable testis, and cholecystectomy. In our opinion, the international scientific associations, such as the IPEG, APSA, andEUPSA, should define some guidelines on the treatment of single pathologies, which could be adopted by laparoscopic surgeons in their clinical practice. Some guidelines have been already published by few associations (e. g., IPEGguidelines) but they tackle only very fewoperations. In addition, it is important for the surgeon to refer to the international literature, and therefore, laparoscopic surgeons should publish also the case studies on the complications of the operations and not only on the successes or improvements in laparoscopic surgery. Surely the national associations can play an important role in defending prosecuted laparoscopic surgeons, as it has been done by the Italian Society of Videosurgery in Infancy, which constituted a medico-legal commission of experts in laparoscopy that gives free assistance to its members being prosecuted following a laparoscopic operation. We believe that court actions against laparoscopic surgeons will represent a crucial problemin laparoscopy in the following years, and only through the joint work of scientific associations and the minimally invasive surgeons groups it will be possible to reduce it, which is ever increasing almost in Italy. Indeed, if it is not reduced it will produce a great increase in the cost of the surgeons’ insurance policies, with further devastating impacts on the whole National Health Service...|$|R
40|$|Method: Blastocyst {{transfer}} is usually performed 24 hours after aggregation when the morulae have become expanded blastocysts {{and on the}} same day as injection. A little time is given between injection and transfer to allow blastocysts to re-expand. **The Recipient** Careful selection of the recipient is most important as the pups are the end result of a lot of hard work. Two strains of mice are used:RB Swiss and (CBA*C 57 BL 6 /J) f 1. RB Swiss are quiet and make excellent mothers but they become overweight quickly and do exhibit bad planes of anaesthesia. CBA*C 57 mice are hardy and display hybrid vigour. They do not carry excess weight and go under anaesthetic well. This strain can be very nervous when housed separately which could be dangerous to their young. They are most suitable if a young RB Swiss is placed into the cage as a companion which can be removed as soon as the pups are seven days old. By this age destruction of the litter is very unlikely. If the CBA mother is to be housed alone she must not be disturbed for ten days. **Prior to surgery, sterilise the following:** - 3 pairs of curved forceps - 2 pairs of iris scissors - 1 pair suture clamps - 1 serafin clip - sterile suture with needle attached (small - for mouse surgery) - Michelle clips (small size) - Michelle <b>clip</b> <b>applicators</b> - 1 mouth pipette and flame-polished transfer pipette - You will also need an anaesthetic. Rompun / Ketavet is found to be quite effective. To make up 10 ml: - 0. 5 ml 2 % Rompun (20 mg/ml Xylazine) - 0. 5 ml 100 mg/ml Ketavet 100 - Delta Veterinary Lab, 8 Rosemead Rd Hornsby NSW 2077 - Make up to 10 ml with PBS - The dosage is 0. 02 ml/g body weight - Store wrapped in tin foil at 4 °C. - Shake well before use as it tends to separate in the fridge. **The Transfer** 1. Select a mouse that is 2. 5 days pseudo pregnant and weigh. Do not use anything lighter and 25 g or anything heavier than 30 g. Underweight mice tend to re-absorb the embryos as they are not physically ready to support a pregnancy. Overweight mice make surgery difficult in the absorption of anaesthetic into the fat reduces the potency of the anaesthetic. Also, the presence of fat means the presence of blood vessels, and cutting through all the extra fat causes a lot of unnecessary bleeding. This makes it difficult to see what you are doing and may also clog up the tip of your transfer pipette. - Anaesthetise mouse with Rompun / Ketavet, administered intraperitoneally. After administering the anaesthetic, put the mouse back into the box from which it came. The mouse will be more relaxed when placed in a familiar environment and the anaesthetic will act more quickly than it would on a distressed mouse. - To check that the mouse is fully anaesthetised, press or squeeze the pads of the feet. If the mouse can feel this it will try to withdraw its leg from your grasp. Do not commence surgery until there is no reflex reaction to this test. - Take the anaesthetised mouse and shave its lower back. Lay mouse on belly on a petri dish lid taking care to keep the airway clear by resting the teeth {{on the edge of the}} petri dish. This makes it easier to move the mouse around without having to actually touch it. Swab the shaven area with hibitane or 70 % ethanol. - Instruments should have been laid out. Use one pair of iris scissors and one pair of forceps for cutting the skin - call these "outside" instruments. Use one pair of iris scissors and two pair of forceps for working inside the mouse - called the "inside" instruments. - Using the outside forceps and scissors, make a small cut (about 1 cm long) along the dorsal midline of the lower back. Through the shaven, moistened skin it is fairly easy to see blood vessels. Try to avoid these vessels when making the incision (see below). - Using a pair of outside forceps and inside forceps, pick up the skin and separate skin from the body wall and cut the body wall as indicated about 5 mm long, avoiding blood vessels. - If the cut has been made in the right place, the ovarian fat pad is easily visible. If not, the fat pad can be located by lifting the edge of he body wall and scouting around with the other pair of inside forceps. Once you have located the fat pad attach serafin clip to it, taking care not to clip ovary. It is important not to damage the ovary as it is responsible for hormone production throughout pregnancy. Gently ease the ovary, oviduct and part of the uterus out through the incision in the body wall. DO NOT PULL. A traumatised uterus will contract and move quite violently, making surgery difficult and may cause expulsion of the transferred blastocysts. When the tip of the uterus is visible, rest the serafin clip across the mouse's back to hold the uterus in place. If the uterus or uterine horn continually slip back into the cavity it may be necessary to gently lie the mouse on the side being careful not to block the airway. - The transfer pipette should now be loaded. Five or six embryos must be transferred to each horn, any less than this and the chances of a pregnancy resulting are serverely reduced. It may be loaded to suit yourself but this is a method that is popular. Take up a minute amount of DMEM with Hepes in the very tip of the transfer pipette, then make a small bubble by taking up a little air. Then take up some more medium - roughly the same volume as you hope to transfer the blastocysts in. Take up another bubble, same size as before. Then take up your blastocysts in the smallest possible volume of medium, lining them up side by side in the transfer pipette. This is how your transfer pipette should look when loaded. - This will take some practise. Make sure that you are competent at loading a transfer pipette before any attempt at a blastocysts transfer. During surgery is not the time to learn how to load a pipette. If it is likely to take you more than a few minutes to load the transfer pipette, then do not expose the uterus until the pipette has been loaded. This prevents drying out and further trauma tot he uterus. Alternatively, the uterus, ovary, etc. may be moistened repeatedly with a sterile cotton bud and saline. - Once the pipette is loaded and the uterus positioned, move the petri dish lid supporting the mouse to the microscope and turn on the overhead light source. Once the lights and focus have been adjusted and the mouse positioned to suit yourself, gently grasp the top of the uterine horn with a pair of inside forceps. Whilst still holding the horn with one hand, use the other hand to gently insert a 26 gauge hypodermic needle through the uterine wall (close to the oviduct) and into the lumen. Choose an area of the uterus that is relatively devoid of blood vessels as blood will clot in the tip of your pipette and block it. Remove the needle and carefully (so as not to lose the site of the hole), without averting your eyes, pick up the loaded transfer pipette. Gently insert the transfer pipette about 3 mm into the uterine lumen. Gently blow the blastocysts into the uterus, using the air bubbles in your transfer pipette to monitor the transfer. Be careful not to blow any air into the uterus. Once {{transfer is}} complete, quickly rinse out transfer pipette in some HEPES buffer medium (M 2) and check to see if there were any blastocysts stuck in the transfer pipette. If there were, transfer these blastocysts again. - With the transfer complete, the serafin clip can now be removed and the uterus gently eased back into the body. Do not touch the uterus, but ease it back by the edges of the incision in the body wall and allowing the uterus to fall back in, without actually handling it. This procedure is then repeated on the other uterine horn. The incision in the body wall is not sutured. The skin is closed with Michelle clips - two per incision is usually sufficient. Michelle clips are used on the skin instead of suture as the mice will chew at the suture thread and effectively open their wounds up. - Once surgery is complete, the mouse is placed in a box of clean autoclaved sawdust. Under anaesthetic, mammals are unable to retain heat as effectively as when conscious. For this reason, and also because the animal has been shaven, the mouse should be wrapped in a tissue to help keep it warm. This will also be used as bedding until the fur has grown back. It is also very important that the mouse by house alone as anaesthetised animals are often buried by cage mates who think they are dead. All animals should have recovered sufficiently from anaesthetic before being returned to the animal room and left unattended. The cage should be placed on a shelf away from male mice, as strange male pheromones will often cause females to abort. Recipient mice should be handled with care and tiptoed around as pregnant mice are easily upset, sometimes leading to abortion, or even cannibalism of pups. If all goes well and a pregnancy results, the pups should be born sixteen days after the transfer...|$|R
