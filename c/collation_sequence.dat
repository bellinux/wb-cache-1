50|$|Any {{additional}} {{letters were}} often given {{a place in}} the alphabet by defining an alphabetical order or <b>collation</b> <b>sequence,</b> which can vary between languages. Some of the additions, especially letters which only have diacritics added to them, were not considered distinct letters for this purpose. For example, the French é and the German ö are not listed separately in their respective alphabet sequences. In some languages, digraphs are included in the <b>collation</b> <b>sequence</b> (e.g. Hungarian CS, Welsh RH).|$|E
50|$|A {{standard}} algorithm for collating any {{collection of}} strings composed of any standard Unicode symbols is the Unicode Collation Algorithm. This {{can be adapted}} to use the appropriate <b>collation</b> <b>sequence</b> for a given language by tailoring its default collation table. Several such tailorings are collected in Common Locale Data Repository.|$|E
5000|$|TACE16 is {{efficient}} over Unicode Tamil {{by about}} 25.39% when the entire data is of Tamil. The default <b>collation</b> <b>sequence</b> followed (Binary) while using the code space {{values in the}} New TACE16 is not as per Tamil Dictionary order. Some of the uyir-meys (Agara-uyirmeys) are taking precedence over vowels and other Uyirmeys in the New TACE16, the vowels and agarauyir-meys being in the 0B80 - 0B8F block and the other Uyir-meys being in the 0800 to 08FF. Because of this reason, sorting Unicode data looks better than TACE16 data.|$|E
50|$|Several <b>collation</b> <b>sequences</b> {{are used}} to order words. Sequences of the first type are common in South Korea, differing on the {{treatment}} of double jamo consonants in syllable-initial (choseong) and -final (jongseong) position; the second sequence is official in North Korea.|$|R
50|$|In {{the course}} of its use, the Latin {{alphabet}} was adapted for use in new languages, sometimes representing phonemes not found in languages that were already written with the Roman characters. To represent these new sounds, extensions were therefore created, be it by adding diacritics to existing letters, by joining multiple letters together to make ligatures, by creating completely new forms, or by assigning a special function to pairs or triplets of letters. These new forms are given {{a place in the}} alphabet by defining an alphabetical order or <b>collation</b> <b>sequence,</b> which can vary with the particular language.|$|E
