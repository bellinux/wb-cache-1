2500|$|The umbo (literally [...] "knob"), was a decorative-cum-practical {{pouching}} of the toga's fabric, {{draped over}} the left shoulder and rightwards, just above the sinus. Its end was loosely tucked into the balneus, approximately halfway across the <b>chest.</b> <b>Like</b> the sinus, the umbo {{could be used for}} storage. Its added weight and friction would have helped (though not very effectively) secure toga's fabric onto the left shoulder. As the toga developed, the umbo grew in size.|$|E
2500|$|In this episode, {{the female}} {{characters}} all enter a beauty contest. Team Rocket also enters, with James donning a suit with inflatable breasts. One {{scene of the}} episode involved James showing off his artificial breasts for humorous effect, taunting Misty by saying: [...] "Maybe, one day when you're older, you'll have a <b>chest</b> <b>like</b> this!". In one scene, he puffs up his breasts to over twice their original size. When it was dubbed and aired in 2000, all scenes of James in a bikini (about 40 seconds) were edited. There {{were a number of}} other sexualized scenes, such as one in which Ash and Brock are stunned at the sight of Misty in a bikini and another in which an older man appears to be attracted to her.|$|E
2500|$|Like {{previous}} installments of the Dead or Alive franchise, {{the game}} was criticized for objectifying women's bodies. A review in Metro pointed to the series as mostly known for its focus on the breasts of the female characters, alleging that [...] "the majority of its characters are all impossibly well-endowed women, whose breasts wobble about their <b>chest</b> <b>like</b> a pair of blancmanges [...] portrayed as simpering, personality-free automatons." [...] An attempt during development of Dead or Alive 5 to [...] "tone down the sexuality" [...] due to outside criticism was reversed due to criticism from long-term fans and testers. [...] In response to criticism of sexualization of female characters, creative director of the games development team pointed {{to the fact that}} the game's [...] "actions, aesthetics and overall visual presentation is more than obviously set in a light-hearted, over-the-top, candy coated universe" [...] and stated that [...] "we also don't feel that we are demeaning women." ...|$|E

60|$|The general {{aspect of}} the {{forecastle}} was dungeon-like and dingy in the extreme. In the first place, it was not five feet from deck to deck and even this space was encroached upon by two outlandish cross-timbers bracing the vessel, and by the sailors' chests, over which you must needs crawl in getting about. At meal-times, and especially when we indulged in after-dinner chat, we sat about the <b>chests</b> <b>like</b> a parcel of tailors.|$|R

2500|$|The {{reason for}} Frazier's sudden removal {{from the top}} of the card was never explained, but Kevin Nash (Diesel) implied it had {{something}} to do with his wrestling style. Nash said in an interview with Kayfabe Commentaries that Frazier's style was very reckless and he had little regard for the safety of his fellow wrestlers. Nash said that entering the match at SummerSlam, Frazier had already injured [...] "six or eight" [...] of his colleagues in the ring. Nash said that one of the injuries was to one of the Samoans on the roster (Fatu), which he implied was not easy to do and should have raised a red flag. Nash pointed to Frazier's use of a frequently utilized move by wrestlers of comparable size, the sitdown splash. Most wrestlers who perform this move, such as the aforementioned Fatu (who adopted the move later in his career) and Earthquake, do so without incident as they perform it in such a manner that very little of their body weight actually comes in contact with the opponent's body. Frazier, as described by Nash, would kick his legs out while performing the move and thus did not allow himself to stop before impact, which caused all of Frazier's 500-plus pound body weight to shift to his rear end and land on the opponent. Further, Frazier did not perform the maneuver on an opponent's <b>chest</b> <b>like</b> usual, instead using the move on the lower back of his opponents. With this in mind Nash told Frazier to leave the move out of the match. Frazier disregarded the request and performed the sitdown splash on Nash's lower back anyway, which caused his spine to compress and his core muscles to stretch out and left Nash with a badly strained abdomen that affected his performance the rest of the match, along with the feeling that he had suffered some sort of permanent damage to his spine. Backstage, Nash recounted that a furious Vince McMahon was ready to fire Frazier immediately after the match and was about to hand him his release papers, but Nash stepped in and convinced McMahon otherwise as he did not feel Frazier should lose his job over the incident. However, it is worth mentioning that no other wrestlers when asked about Frazier have agreed with this sentiment.|$|E

60|$|From above, you {{entered by}} a plank, with two elects, {{slanting}} {{down from the}} scuttle, which was a mere hole in the deck. There being no slide to draw over in case of emergency, the tarpaulin temporarily placed there was little protection from the spray heaved over the bows; so that in anything of a breeze the place was miserably wet.

2500|$|The {{full-length}} {{version of}} the single included two other tracks, the original B-side [...] "Spoon to Ase" [...] and a remix of the leading track from Shin-shiro, [...] "Native Dancer", rearranged by electronic musician Rei Harakami. [...] "Spoon to Ase" [...] was written to be a song that was the complete opposite to [...] "Aruku Around", and featured a strong acoustic guitar sound that mixed folk and electro genres {{in a similar way}} to Sakanaction's early music. Yamaguchi wanted to include a song like this to illustrate to listeners that Sakanaction released more than just dance music.

5000|$|The field desk is both {{an antique}} and a modern desk form. The antique form is usually made of fine woods and brass fittings.

There is a wide variety of antique field desks, ranging from small suitcase-sized ones to fairly big <b>chests,</b> <b>like</b> the one general Thomas J. [...] "Stonewall" [...] Jackson used during the American Civil War in the United States. Until recently, General Jackson's desk was exhibited in the museum of the Virginia Military Institute (VMI).
