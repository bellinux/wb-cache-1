40|$|We {{study the}} effect of system {{reservoir}} coupling strength on the current flowing through quantum junctions. We consider two simple double quantum dot configurations coupled to two external fermionic reservoirs and calculate the net current flowing between the two reservoirs. The net current is partitioned into <b>currents</b> <b>carried</b> by the eigenstates {{of the system and}} by the coherences induced between the states due to coupling with the leads. We find that <b>current</b> <b>carried</b> by populations is always positive whereas <b>current</b> <b>carried</b> by coherences may be negative. This results in a non-monotonic dependence of the net current on the coupling strength. We find that in certain cases, the net current can vanish at large couplings due to cancellation between <b>currents</b> <b>carried</b> by the states and the coherences. These results provide new insights into the non-trivial role of system-reservoir couplings on electron transport through quantum dot junctions. Comment: 5 pages, 4 figure...|$|R

Copper’s high strength resists stretching, neck-down, creep, nicks and breaks, and thereby also prevents failures and service interruptions. Copper is much heavier than aluminum for conductors of equal <b>current</b> <b>carrying</b> capacity, so the high {{tensile strength}} is offset by its increased weight.|$|E

2500|$|George H. Scholes Ltd. of Manchester first {{introduced}} plugs with a hollow round earth pin between rectangular current-carrying pins in 1926 under the Wylex brand name, this was {{prior to the}} first British Standard for earthed plugs. [...] The Wylex plugs were initially made in three ratings, 5A, 10A and 15A and were unpolarized (the <b>current</b> <b>carrying</b> pins {{were on the same}} centre line as the earth pin). In 1933 an asymmetric polarized version was introduced, with line pin slightly offset from the centre line. [...] In 1934 the dual plug system was introduced with the socket rated at 15A and three sizes of plug, fused 2A and 5A plugs and a 15A plug. [...] The 15A [...] "dual plug" [...] incorporated a socket with narrower apertures than a standard Wylex 15A socket, that accepted only the narrow rectangular pins of the lower-rated plugs. [...] The introduction of a 13A fused plug, rated as 3kW., enabled Scholes to propose their system as a possible solution for the new standard competing with the Dorman & Smith round pin solution, but it was not selected and the completely new BS1363 design prevailed. [...] Wylex sockets were used in council housing and public sector buildings and, for a short time in private housing. They were particularly popular in the Manchester area although they were installed throughout England, mainly in schools, university accommodation, and government laboratories. In some London schools built in the 1960s they were used as low-voltage AC sockets, typically 12V, 5A from a transformer serving one or more laboratories, for microscope lamps etc. [...] Wylex plugs and sockets continued to be manufactured for several years after BS1363 sockets became standard, and were commonly used by banks and in computer rooms during the 1960s and 1970s for uninterruptible power supplies or [...] "clean" [...] filtered mains supplies.|$|E
60|$|I stayed {{some time}} {{at a place where}} I saw a new {{clearing}} on a very steep part of the mountain, and obtained a few interesting insects. In the evening we went on to the extreme southern point, to be ready to pass across the fifteen-mile strait to the island of Kaióa. At five the next morning we started, but the wind, which had hitherto been westerly, now got to the south and southwest, and we had to row almost all the way with a burning sun overhead. As we approached land a fine breeze sprang up, and we went along at a great pace; yet after an hour we were no nearer, and found we were in a violent <b>current</b> <b>carrying</b> us out to sea. At length we overcame it, and got on shore just as the sun set, having been exactly thirteen hours coming fifteen miles. We landed on a beach of hard coralline rock, with rugged cliffs of the same, resembling those of the Ke Islands (Chap. XXIX.) It was accompanied by a brilliancy and luxuriance of the vegetation, very like what I had observed at those islands, which so much pleased me that I resolved to stay a few days at the chief village, and see if their animal productions were correspondingly interesting. While searching for a secure anchorage for the night we again saw the comet, still apparently as brilliant as at first, but the tail had now risen to a higher angle.|$|E
60|$|Notwithstanding their {{critical}} situation, the whole party behind the cover had their eyes fastened on the working countenance {{of the young}} Iroquois, who was agitated by conflicting feelings. First came the eager hope of obtaining success {{where some of the}} most experienced of his tribe had failed, and with it a degree of glory that had seldom fallen to the share of one of his years or a brave on his first war-path; then followed doubts, as the drooping leaves seemed to rise again and to revive in the currents of air; and distrust of hidden danger lent its exciting feeling to keep the eloquent features in play. So very slight, however, had been the alteration produced by the heat on the bushes of which the stems were in the water, that when the Iroquois actually laid his hand on the leaves, he fancied that he had been deceived. As no man ever distrusts strongly without using all convenient means of satisfying his doubts, however, the young warrior cautiously pushed aside the branches and advanced a step within the hiding-place, when the forms of the concealed party met his gaze, resembling so many breathless statues. The low exclamation, the slight start, and the glaring eye, were hardly seen and heard, before the arm of Chingachgook was raised, and the tomahawk of the Delaware descended on the shaven head of his foe. The Iroquois raised his hands frantically, bounded backward, and fell into the water, at a spot where the current swept the body away, the struggling limbs still tossing and writhing in the agony of death. The Delaware made a vigorous but unsuccessful attempt to seize an arm, with the hope of securing the scalp; but the bloodstained waters whirled down the <b>current,</b> <b>carrying</b> with them their quivering burden.|$|E
