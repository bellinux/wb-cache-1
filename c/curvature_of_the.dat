In the center of the village, NY427, named Front Street, intersects with the northern end of NY367, a short highway linking NY427 to the Pennsylvania border.

5|$|Despite {{being the}} most {{distinctive}} feature of Deinonychus, the shape and <b>curvature</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sickle claw varies between specimens.

Ostrom suggested that this difference in {{the size and shape}} of the sickle claws could be due to individual, sexual, or age-related variation, but admitted he could not be sure.|$|E

Wallace, intrigued by the challenge and short of money at the time, designed an experiment in which he set up two objects along a six-mile (10km) stretch of canal. Both objects were at the same height above the water, and he mounted a telescope on a bridge at the same height above the water as well. When seen through the telescope, one object appeared higher than the other, showing the <b>curvature</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> earth.|$|E

5|$|Metal corsets {{for medical}} {{purposes}} {{continued to be}} used in the 18th and early 19th century, although equivalent garments made from canvas were increasingly used in their place. In 1894, A.M.

Made from a cast of the patient's body, the advantages of such a garment were that aluminium was lightweight, durable, thin enough to be worn beneath clothing, and could be worn while bathing. Such corsets were still being recommended in the early 20th century as cheaper and more durable in the longer run than plaster moulds, although their initial expense was greater.|$|E

The vertical format was dictated by the space available in the room for which the painting was commissioned – each in William's set of eight was made {{to be the same}} size. At an unknown date, the panel was cut down on all sides, particularly at the top, so the sky was originally larger and the moon further from the corner of the scene. The scene is approached from an impossible viewpoint – at first only feet from the fray, the perspective gradually ascends to encompass the seas and continents in the background and eventually the <b>curvature</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Earth itself.|$|E
5|$|The {{gymnasium}} has {{a capacity}} of approximately 16,000 and the smaller building can accommodate up 5,300 depending on the events that are taking place. At {{the time it was}} built, the gymnasium had the world's largest suspended roof span. Two reinforced concrete pillars support a pre-stressed steel net onto which steel plates are attached. The bottom anchoring of this steel net is a heavy concrete support system which forms a distinct curve on the interior and exterior of the building. In the interior, this structural anchor is used to support the grandstand seats. The overall <b>curvature</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> roof helps protect the building from the damaging effects of strong winds.|$|E

5|$|The Andean Volcanic Belt {{consists}} of three main volcanic zones: the Northern Volcanic Zone (from 2° N to 5° S), the Central Volcanic Zone (16° to 28° S) and the Southern Volcanic Zone (33° to 46° S). Active volcanism occurs where the Nazca Plate subducts beneath the South American Plate. The plates are separated by shallower subduction zones, with no present-day volcanism. These shallower zones {{have been attributed to}} the high speed of the plate collision, the young age of the subducting oceanic lithosphere and the <b>curvature</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> subducting plate. The most plausible theory is that variations in buoyancy of a subducting plate creates a flat subduction zone. The Cocos, Juan Fernandez and Nazca Ridges are associated with such volcanic gaps where they collide with the oceanic trench. The subduction of spreading ridges can also diminish volcanism, as observed in the Chile Rise further south. The buoyancy of these crustal structures may hinder subduction, reducing water supply to the mantle and inducing the formation of melts.|$|E
5|$|The {{senses of}} Psittacosaurus can be {{inferred}} from the endocast. Large olfactory bulbs are present, indicating the genus had an acute sense of smell. The size of these bulbs are comparable to large predatory theropods, although they likely evolved to avoid predators instead of to seek out prey. The sclerotic rings in reptiles directly show {{the size of the}} eyeball. The rings are not well preserved in Psittacosaurus, with one individual preserving them likely contracted postmortem, but if they {{are similar to those of}} Protoceratops, Psittacosaurus would have had large eyes and acute vision. The <b>curvature</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> semicircular canals is related to the agility of reptiles, and the large curved canals in Psittacosaurus show that the genus was much more agile than later ceratopsians. Comparisons between the scleral rings of Psittacosaurus and modern birds and reptiles suggest that it may have been cathemeral, active throughout the day and for short intervals at night.|$|E

5|$|The term {{track and}} field is {{intertwined}} with the stadiums that first hosted such competitions. The two basic features of a {{track and field}} stadium are the outer oval-shaped running track and an area of turf within this track—the field. In earlier competitions, track lengths varied: the Panathinaiko Stadium measured 333.33metres at the 1896 Summer Olympics, while at the 1904 Olympics the distance was {{a third of a}} mile (536.45m) at Francis Field. As the sport developed, the IAAF standardised the length to 400m and stated that the tracks must be split into six to eight running lanes. Precise widths for the lanes were established, as were regulations regarding the <b>curvature</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> track. Tracks made of flattened cinders were popular in the early 20th century but synthetic tracks became standard in the late 1960s. 3M's Tartan track (an all-weather running track of polyurethane) gained popularity after its use at the 1968 US Olympic Trials and the 1968 Summer Olympics and it began the process in which synthetic tracks became the standard for the sport. Many track and field stadiums are multi-purpose stadiums, with the running track surrounding a field built for other sports, such as the various types of football.|$|E
