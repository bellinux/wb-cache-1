25|$|Despite the {{attachment}} of accretionary texts {{to the original}} Insular/Anglo-Saxon book relating to the Benedictine Abbey at Cerne in Dorset, there are even questions concerning {{whether or not this}} codex was ever physically housed at this monastery. All one <b>can</b> <b>say</b> <b>for</b> certain based on codiclogical evidence is that at some point after the Dissolution in the 16rth century and by 1697 that these accretionary documents from Cerne Abbas were attached to the original Insular/Anglo-Saxon core.|$|E
25|$|This {{notation}} {{means that}} the corresponding Slater determinants have a clear higher weight in the configuration interaction expansion. The atomic orbital concept is therefore a key concept for visualizing the excitation process associated with a given transition. For example, one <b>can</b> <b>say</b> <b>for</b> a given transition that it corresponds to the excitation of an electron from an occupied orbital to a given unoccupied orbital. Nevertheless, one has {{to keep in mind}} that electrons are fermions ruled by the Pauli exclusion principle and cannot be distinguished from the other electrons in the atom. Moreover, it sometimes happens that the configuration interaction expansion converges very slowly and that one cannot speak about simple one-determinant wave function at all. This is the case when electron correlation is large.|$|E

It was also {{shown at the}} Sundance Film Festival in the United States and the Cannes Film Festival in France in 1990. Film producer Terence Chang suggested that The Killers success around the world made several Hong Kong filmmakers jealous: [...] "It created {{a certain kind of}} resentment in the Hong Kong film industry. One thing I <b>can</b> <b>say</b> <b>for</b> sure is, the American, European, Japanese, Korean and even the Taiwanese audiences and critics appreciated The Killer a lot more than it was in Hong Kong." [...] The Killer received a wide release in the United Kingdom on 8 October 1993.|$|E

500|$|The {{film was}} the first Hollywood {{production}} to be filmed with the Red Digital Cinema Camera Company's RED Epic camera and was shot in 3-D at 5K resolution. Cinematographer John Schwartzman {{had this to say}} about the camera: [...] "Today was Epic, Monday December 6 marks the first day the Red Epic camera was used to shoot a major studio motion picture. I <b>can</b> <b>say</b> <b>for</b> certainty the camera does exist and boy is it ready for primetime, as a matter of fact it's a true game changer." [...] Schwartzman felt that the 3D would have been impossible without it. He said, [...] "I can tell you without these cameras it would be impossible to move a 3D rig in the ways that THIS story demands, if Jim and the crew hadn't made these cameras available to us I don't think we could have shot this movie the way our director envisioned it in 3D." [...] Webb wanted cameras small enough to fit on the rigs and swing around very fast, saying that the [...] "RED Epic cameras were the right cameras to do that." [...] Webb continued that [...] "you need to shoot it with a level of velocity and 3D cameras can be very large... and so we need those cameras to mount on rigs that could fly to the air and run to the streets in a certain pace. That allowed us to do it." [...] The Amazing Spider-Man climax was filmed in a 1:78:1 aspect ratio for its IMAX DMR release.|$|E
2500|$|The {{encyclical}} Humani generis redemptionem from 15 June 1917, {{deals with}} blatant ineffectiveness of Christian preaching. According to Benedict XV, {{there are more}} preachers of the Word than ever before, but [...] "in the state {{of public and private}} morals as well as the constitutions and laws of nations, there is a general disregard and forgetfulness of the supernatural, a gradual falling away from the strict standard of Christian virtue, and that men are slipping back into the shameful practices of paganism." [...] The Pope squarely put part of the blame on those ministers of the Gospel who do not handle it as they should. It is not the times but the incompetent Christian preachers who are to blame, for no one today <b>can</b> <b>say</b> <b>for</b> sure that the Apostles were living in better times than ours. Perhaps, the encyclical states, that the Apostles found minds more readily devoted to the Gospel, or they may have met others with less opposition to the law of God.|$|E

On 21 August 2008, rallies were held in Tskhinvali and Sukhumi at which the people of South Ossetia and Abkhazia, respectively, appealed to Russian President Dmitry Medvedev and the Russian Federal Assembly for official recognition of their independence as sovereign states. South Ossetian President Eduard Kokoity flew to Moscow on 23 August 2008 to address the Federation Council of Russia, and in his appeal stated [...] "what the Georgian leadership has done in South Ossetia {{can only be described as}} a Caucasian Stalingrad." [...] On 25 August 2008, President of Abkhazia Sergei Bagapsh also made a presentation to the Federation Council. In his address to the Council, Bagapsh stated [...] "I <b>can</b> <b>say</b> <b>for</b> certain that Abkhazia and South Ossetia will never be [...] part of Georgia." ...|$|E
