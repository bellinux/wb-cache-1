It {{is the only}} sound method to estimate the energy loss in man-made open channels. For various reasons (mainly historical reasons), empirical resistance coefficients (e.g. Chézy, Gauckler-Manning-Strickler) were and are still used. The <b>Chézy</b> <b>coefficient</b> was introduced in 1768 while the Gauckler-Manning coefficient was first developed in 1865, well before the classical pipe flow resistance experiments in the 1920-1930s. Historically both the Chézy and the Gauckler-Manning coefficients {{were expected to be}} constant and functions of the roughness only. But it is now well recognised that these coefficients are only constant for a range of flow rates. Most friction coefficients (except perhaps the Darcy-Weisbach friction factor) are estimated 100% empirically and they apply only to fully rough turbulent water flows under steady flow conditions.|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of this project is to assess the influence of suspended sediment on hydrodynamic properties {{in the study area}} from tidal damping aspect. Firstly, through conducting tidal amplification factor analysis based on real time measured data, seasonal variation in sloping tendency has been observed. The difference in sloping tendency revealed in tidal amplification factor analysis is a result of flow velocity and water depth interaction. In wet season, the sloping tendency in analysis result suggests that tide with higher amplitude experiences less damping as the tidal wave travels upstream than which with lower amplitude; in dry season, tide with higher amplitude experiences more damping than which with lower amplitude. Secondly, a two dimensional clear water flow model has been set up. By comparing the tidal amplification factor analysis result based on model result and with which based on measured data, a disagreement in sloping tendency has been observed in wet season, which indicates that the pattern of flow velocity and water depth interaction in clear water flow is different from which in the reality. Through extensive sensitivity analyses, the disagreement in sloping tendency in tidal amplification factor analysis result persists. Therefore, the conclusion can be drawn as follows: the suspended sediment which has not been considered in the model does have an influence over the hydrodynamic properties. By performing analysis over tidal amplitude and effective <b>Chezy</b> <b>coefficient,</b> the result reveals that the value of effective <b>Chezy</b> <b>coefficient</b> has a high correlation with the tidal amplitude, as higher tidal amplitude associates with higher value of <b>Chezy</b> <b>coefficient</b> and vice versa. In addition, the analysis result suggests that the value of effective <b>Chezy</b> <b>coefficient</b> for this study area should fall in between 60 for neap tide period to 70 for spring tide period. This finding conforms to the explanation proposed from buoyancy destruction aspect: higher tidal amplitude associates with higher suspended sediment concentration and better mixing, which would induce more buoyancy destruction effect and result in a lower bed roughness. Therefore, through analyses conducted in this project, the buoyancy destruction theory has been indirectly supported. I addition, since insufficient sediment information is obtained, this project fails in predict the future situation in a detailed manner. However, as which has been reported in previous literatures, the concentration of suspended sediment would decrease in the future. Some primitive estimation can still be done. As the sediment concentration drops, the hydrodynamic properties in the study area would be more prone to the clear water flow as presented in the model, such that tide with higher amplitude would experience more damping in Jiangyin-Xuliujing reach and less damping in Zhenjiang-Jiangyin reach.

We found that turbulence was affected by the periphyton mat selectively. The largest influence occurred for the velocity distribution, Reynolds stress, coefficient of eddy diffusivity, and velocity cross-spectra.

The periphyton mat increased roughness length by a factor of = 5 whereas the integral resistance to flow (reciprocal <b>Chezy</b> <b>coefficient</b> and Manning's roughness coefficient) was increased by 20 - 25 %.

40|$|In {{the last}} century, various tidal rivers in Europe {{have seen a}} large tidal amplication, which is {{believed}} to be caused by the deepening and channelization of these rivers. Additionally, large increases in suspended sediment concentrations induced by flood dominance are thought to have decreased the effective hydraulic drag, enhancing further tidal amplication. The tidal amplication causes problems with respect to flood defenses and navigational safety. Furthermore, the increased concentration of suspended sediment causes ecological problems. In the meanwhile, ports along these rivers consider further deepening to accompany ever-larger ships. This research aims at {{a better understanding of the}} consequences of deepening and/or a reduced hydraulic drag for tidal asymmetry. Special attention is given to the non-linear behavior of tidal propagation into rivers. Much research has already been done on the implications of deepening tidal rivers. These studies have been done by using either linearized models or fully non-linear ones to solve the Saint Venant equations. This research uses a perturbation model to relate those linear analyses to non-linear behavior. The model uses linear solutions for the water levels and flow velocities (referred to as the leading order solutions) to generate estimates of the effect of the non-linearities, allowing to calculate them separately. By comparing the solutions to those of the fully non-linear SOBEK model we show that this perturbation model provides good estimates of the magnitude and the behavior of the residual and the M 4 tide for values of epsilon up to at least 0. 5. This research also shows that a linearized friction parameter r can be just as sensitive to boundary conditions or geometrical parameters, as it is to quadratic friction parameters such as the <b>Chézy</b> <b>coefficient.</b> This is done by consistently fitting the leading order solutions of the perturbation model to the M 2 frequency solutions of SOBEK with a constant <b>Chézy</b> <b>coefficient.</b> Especially for variations of the imposed tidal wave amplitude, we found a strong sensitivity of the linear friction parameter r. This notion makes the interpretation of changes in r complex and reduces the utility of linearized models. Concerning the role of non-linearities with respect to tidal asymmetry we show that for all realistic depths in the Upper Sea Scheldt, the internally generated M 4 tide and residual flow is of the same order of magnitude or larger than the external M 4 tide and river flow. Moreover, in case of deepening, the relation between the importance of the non-linearities or overtides and the non-linearity parameter epsilon is not trivial. We depicted a range of epsilon which no clear relation to the overtides exists, denoted as the arbitrary range. The main reason for the existence of this range is the complex response of the leading order water level and flow velocity to deepening. The largest non-linearities depend on both these leading order solutions. Additionally, all non-linearities have a different direct dependency on the average water depth h. It is encouraged to continue work with the perturbation model as it shows great analysis potential. The use of a more accurate description of the friction term is recommended.

40|$|Prediction of bottom {{changes in}} rivers and tidal {{channels}} require a thorough {{knowledge of the}} secondary flow, as this flow gives rise to bottom slopes transverse to the main flow direction. In the model used in this research, the computation of the secondary flow field is based upon an, independently computed, depth averaged main flow field. In the computation of the secondary flow it can often be assumed fully developed, i. e. adjusted to the local variables: depth, main flow velocity, etc. In case of variation of bottom topography or of main flow properties in the flow direction, the secondary flow will not be adjusted to these local variables, but will retain information about the situation considered parcels of water have met earlier during their flow. An analogous misadjustment will occur in case of time dependent main flow properties. A theoretical investigation about the degree of adjustment of secondary flow was reported by Booij and Kalkwijk (1982). They describe the rate of adjustment by a relaxation length in case of variation in the flow direction and by a relaxation time in case of variation in time. Both are defined by {{the reduction of the}} misadjustment to a factor l/e of the original misadjustment with respect to the local variables. For the value of the <b>Chezy</b> <b>coefficient</b> of 50 m^ 1 / 2 /s, the relaxation length L of the secondary flow was found to be about 15 times the water depth hand the relaxation time T was found to be about the time needed by the depth averaged flow to cover a distance equal to this relaxation length.

The model has the capability of successfully simulating all surface irrigation phases in blocked-end borders {{for a range of}} inflow rates (0. 01 - 0. 05 m 3 /s per m), longitudinal slopes (up to 1. 00 %), and border lengths (100 - 500 m). To achieve numerical stability over the specified parameter ranges, the model was divided into three parts: (1) advance-phase simulation which uses the four-point implicit solution method of the Saint-Venant equations, with an algorithm that changes the spatial and temporal weighting, in addition to an algorithm that handles the water depth profile at the blocked-end downstream boundary upon completion of the advance phase; (2) simultaneous advance-recession-phase calculations using a hybrid algorithm to solve the governing equations; and (3) recession-phase simulation using the four-point implicit method until (and if) divergence occurs, then the volume-method is applied to complete the simulation. The three parts also involve the use of computational grid management algorithms and a parabolic equation which defines the <b>Chezy</b> <b>coefficient</b> as a function of water depth.

Different optimum values of inflow rate and irrigation cutoff time for a range of longitudinal slopes, border lengths, and soil types were generated. Most of the optimum values are for relatively high inflow rate and rapid cutoff time. In addition, exponential relations were developed, based on the simulation results, to determine the best irrigation time for maximization of the composite irrigation efficiency for specified, non-optimal inflow rates.

40|$|Debris flow is {{a natural}} {{phenomenon}} triggered by special conditions that combine: high intensity rainfall, material available for transport, slopes steep enough to induce flowage, and insufficient protection of the ground by vegetation and/or other erosion control means. These conditions are very common in semiarid and arid regions in Utah, other Western states and {{many other parts of}} the globe. Previously, the two models proposed to solve debris flow are the Bingham plastic model and the dilatants model. Both these models depend upon coefficients that are not easy to obtain. Therefore, they are not very useful in practice. According to the field observations and data reported, most debris flows that occur in nature are laminar. The viscosity of these flows has been as large as 600, 000 time that of water. Reynolds numbers are less or equal to 500 for these debris flows. Laminar debris flows are the subject of this report. A theoretical model based on the Saint-Venant equations of continuity and motion, together with a modified Chezy equation for defining the energy loss, were found to be suitable to describe debris flow in the laminar range. These equations were solved by numerical methods implemented in a computer program. This report covers only steady by gradually varied debris flow solutions. A formula defining the <b>Chezy</b> <b>coefficient</b> as a function of Reynolds number is proposed. A relationship between the debris flow density and its viscosity is also proposed. These relationships are of necessity based on the limited data available for debris flows. Solutions to four examples are given. The results show that this open channel debris flow model reproduces well debris flows observed in nature. These solutions show that debris flows develop depths greater than water flows. The bed slope is the most important variable that affects the ratio of the depth of debris flow to depth of an equivalent volumetric water flow. For milder slopes this depth ratio exceeds ten. The substantially larger depth of debris flow than of equivalent water flow explains in part why debris flows have been observed to stop flowing, leaving an abrupt wave-shaped form on the landscape...|$|E
40|$|In river {{engineering}} morphological predictions {{have to be}} made {{to study}} the implications of changes in a river system due to natural causes or human interference. It regards here time-depending processes. Characteristic parameters of the river have to be forecasted both in time and space. The morphological processes, however, are extremely complex and therefore a substantial degree of schematization is required before e. g. mathematical models can be applied to obtain the predictions wanted. Information about available mathematical models can e. g. be obtained from Jansen (1979) and Klaassen et al (1982). The present physical-mathematical formulation of the morphological problems involved is incomplete. For instance the variation of the width B(x,t) cannot yet be predicted. Therefore in this paper the restriction is made that (relatively) unerodible banks are present. The description of the problem in two (horizontal) space dimensions has not yet led to mathematical models that are used on a routine basis. During the last two decades or so, however, one-dimensional models have been developed gradually to useful tools for practical problems. In these models average values across the width of the river are predicted for the waterlevel h(x,t), the bedlevel z(x,t) and consequently for the water depth a(x,t). There is concern, however, regarding the accuracy of these predictions. Very few possibilities exist to calibrate and verify the mathematical models for a particular river. There are a large number of error sources of which here basicly two will be discussed. Sediment transport s(x,t) has to be predicted from the local hydraulic conditions. Alluvial roughness, for instance expressed in the <b>Chezy</b> <b>coefficient</b> C(x,t), also has to be forecast locally. The available transport predictors and roughness predictors are based on the presence of steady uniform flow. Hence there is already a potential source of errors in applying these predictions in a mathematical model with nonsteady and non-uniform flow. The two types of predictions are linked. In many transport predictors (transport formulae) the alluvial roughness has to be known. As future conditions are considered, this roughness also has to be predicted.

In this connection, there is a practical problem of identifying the slope angle sufficient for the transportation of waste glass in an open rectangular channel. Thus, we must determine the hydraulic characteristics of the two-phase flow to solve the problem. A laboratory research of the particle size distribution pattern was conducted in 2011 at the glass factory in operation in the Tula region. The shape of particles and the condition of the glass surface affect the parameters of their hydraulic transportation. These characteristics are taken into account when calculating the formula and introducing the correction coefficient. The problem of determining the slope of the open channel needed to transport waste glass into the glass melting furnace can be formulated as follows. What should be the angle of the bottom of the channel for hydraulic transport of waste glass, when the particle speed reaches its critical value? The input data are as follows: channel length - 70 meters, cross-section area - 1. 4 m 2.

First, a laboratory experiment was designed to explore the effects of soil microtopography, slope and Reynolds number on the magnitude of Darcy-Weisbach, Manning and <b>Chezy</b> roughness <b>coefficients.</b> It was found that three parameters were necessary to describe the soil surface microtopography. Neural networks developed in a preliminary phase were able to reproduce the roughness coefficients obtained in the laboratory experiment by using five predictor variables: bed slope, Reynolds number, and the three parameters used to describe the microtopography. However, these networks failed to generate roughness coefficients for different input variables (generalization). Second, more complex algorithms were developed as combinations of neural networks in parallel. The algorithm output, the sought hydraulic roughness estimate, was estimated with the arithmetic average of the individual network outputs. Results presented in this study demonstrate that combining multiple neural networks reduced the prediction error and improved on the generalization ability of the neural networks. It was also observed that the estimate accuracy was influenced by the characteristics of the dataset, and especially by the relationship between the roughness coefficient and Reynolds numbers.

Empirical relations were formulated to calculate the bed form resistance and bed load transport rate using a newly defined flow parameter that incorporates the vegetation concentration. The bed elevations and bed form height were measured by the Microsoft Kinect 3 D Camera. It was found that the height of bed form depends on the vegetation concentration, which determines whether ripple/dune or scour holes are dominant on the bed surface. For sparsely vegetated flows, the bed form height and resistance are decrease rapidly as the vegetation concentration was increased, and they decreased gradually when the vegetation concentration was high. To quantify the vegetation induced friction resistance, a 3 D numerical simulation was conducted using the Delft 3 D-FLOW open source program. The study area is Davis Pond freshwater marsh area near New Orleans, Louisiana. The dominant vegetation type for the study area is Panicum hemitomon. The study area was divided into several sub-areas depending on the existence of channels, overbanks, and vegetation height. Several approaches were used to approximate the vegetation roughness; a constant Manning's n coefficient, a time-varying n or <b>Chezy's</b> C <b>coefficient,</b> and the modified momentum and k-ɛ equations for each subarea. To quantify the time varying roughness coefficients, four equations for calculating n values were incorporated in the Delft 3 D-FLOW program in addition to two options offered by this program to calculate C values. It is concluded that the use of the time varying roughness coefficient gives better results than other approaches. Among the selected equations to calculate the time varying vegetation roughness, the equations that account for the effect of the degree of submergence and the vegetation frontal area per unit volume, symbolized as a, gave the closet matches with the observations. The sensitivity of modeling results to the selection of vertical grid (σ–and Z-grids), a value, and grid size were analyzed. It is found that using the σ-grid yielded more accurate results with less CPU times and the best range of a value for the Panicum hemitomon vegetation type is from 8. 160 to 11. 220 m⁻¹. Also it was observed that the adoption of a coarse mesh gives reasonable simulation results with less CPU time compared with a fine mesh. A non-linear relation between the vegetation resistance, in terms of n value, and degree of submergence was observed...|$|R
