The new tenant essentially buys the lease from the original tenant. The <b>capitalization</b> <b>factor</b> is financial and strategic, depending on cost of money, importance of the site to the taker {{and the location of}} the site. The ratio used goes from 0 (poor locations) to 12 (top locations). The remaining number of years of the contract has little or no impact unless it falls under the legal provision of déplafonnement du loyer, in which the landlord is automatically allowed to ask for a new, market-rate rent regardless of the rent paid so far.|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we see the}} {{evolution}} of a capitalized financial event e, with respect to a <b>capitalization</b> <b>factor</b> f, as the exponential map of a suitably defined Lie group G(f,e), supported by the half-space of capitalized financial events having the same capital sign of e. The Lie group G(f,e) depends upon the <b>capitalization</b> <b>factor</b> f and on the event e itself. After the extension of the definition of exponential map of a Lie group, we shall eliminate the dependence on the financial event e, recognizing the presence of essentially one unique financial Lie semigroup, supported by the entire space of capitalized financial events, determined by the <b>capitalization</b> <b>factor</b> f. ...|$|E

In order to attain this objective, we proceed {{on the assumption that the}} non-central moments of the <b>capitalization</b> <b>factor</b> are known. Specifically, to calculate the value of these annuities, we propose two different expressions. First, we suppose that the random interest rate is normally distributed; then, we assume that it follows the beta distribution.

40|$|How {{should one}} conceptualize price-earnings {{multiples}} (earnings <b>capitalization</b> <b>factors)</b> {{when interest rates}} change stochastically? The paper shows that while the multiplier for forthcoming earnings depends on current rates, the multiplier for current earnings depends on lagged rates. With these ideas in place, the paper generalizes Ohlson [1995] model with particular emphasis on the case when earnings provide sufficient accounting information for valuation. Results do {{not depend on the}} stochastic behavior of interest rates. The paper further derives the supporting modified information dynamic and shows how earnings persistence depends on both the current and the lagged rate. ...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{calculate}} the renewal premium of finite risk reinsurance under the assumption that the interest rate shows a stochastic evolution. The problem of the convolution of the random variables involved in the calculation of the premium has been solved by simulating claim paths using the Monte-Carlo method and applying three financial decision criteria: the expected value, the variance and the standard deviation. In the last two criteria we propose to use a stochastic recurrence equation to avoid the problem of dependence between stochastic <b>capitalization</b> <b>factors.</b> The application of the variance criterion and of the standard deviation criterion has allowed us to obtain the reinsurance premium depending on the level of risk aversion of the reinsurer and the volatility of the interest rat...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT. In {{this paper}} we endow {{the space of}} {{financial}} events with some structures, each of them represents basic facts of financial mathematics. We introduce a preordered structure, that we shall call the usual preorder of the financial events plane, and an alge-braic structure, that we call the usual linearoid structure of the financial events plane. The algebraic structures introduced are not void of properties: the usual addition will confer to the space a gruppoid structure and the multiplication by scalars will be a law of action as-sociative and distributive {{with respect to the}} addition. We shall prove that these structures are compatible among them and with the standard topology of the plane. Then we show the possibility of defining new (economically relevant) preorders by the use of capitaliza-tion factors {{and that there is a}} manner (the conjunction) to obtain the usual preorder from infinite continuous families of these new preorders induced by a <b>capitalization</b> <b>factor.</b> 1...|$|E
40|$|This {{study is}} an {{evaluation}} of the relation between farm land values and the returns to farm land. The primary motivation for this study has been to explain the observed relation between farm land values and returns which has in some years been contradictory to the suggested theoretical relation between land values and returns. The primary objective of this study has been to examine the importance of growth of the returns to farm land in explaining the historical levels of farm land and its relationship with the returns to farm land. Data were collected on the values of cash rented farms and estimates of gross cash rents paid on those for 24 states for the period 1929 - 1980. Twelve states were selected for analysis. The 12 states were Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Iowa, Missouri, Pennsylvania, Michigan, South Dakota, Minnesota, Wisconsin, North Dakota, and Oklahoma;The theoretical land value model was developed from the present value approach for determining values. The explanatory variables identified from this approach are the returns to farm land, the capitalization rate, the growth rate of the returns to farm land, the inflation rate, inflation rate, and taxes. Because of lack of data, taxes are not included in the empirical models;The empirical models to determine the association between the explanatory variables and farm land values were estimated by regression analysis. Two basic sets of regression were estimated; one using farm land value per acre as the dependent variable and one using the ratio of gross cash rent to farm land value as the dependent variable. The results of the empirical models indicate that gross cash rents are strongly related to farm land values. In general, the growth rate of gross cash rents did not perform as expected. The coefficient on nominal and real growth rates was significantly different from zero but did not have the correct sign. The coefficients on the lagged growth rates were found to be not significantly different from zero. The general rise in the price level did not appear to {{have a significant impact on}} the nominal or real value of farm land. The <b>capitalization</b> <b>factor</b> was found to be statistically significant in estimating the rent-to-value ratio;Granger causality tests were also applied to the data. Overall, the results did not support the hypothesis that gross cash rents 2 ̆ 2 caused, 2 ̆ 2 in the Granger sense, farm land values...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{three basic}} equity valuation concepts: (1) residual income valuation (RIV); (2) {{in the spirit}} of Miller-Modigliani, the irrelevance of a firm's dividend payout policy; (3) betas/CAPM, to quantify risk and <b>capitalization</b> <b>factors.</b> As a first cut, results show that RIV, concept (1), lacks empirical support while in contrast concepts (2) and (3) hold up reasonably well. To address (2) and (3) we develop a model where earnings and earnings growth determine value. This model supplants RIV because of its greater intuitive appeal and empirical support. A linear function of eps 1, eps 2, dps 1 maps into stock prices and theory specifies the coefficients' admissible magnitudes. Both the concepts of dividend payout irrelevance and risk (cost-of-equity per CAPM) restrict the coefficients. Bvps is value-irrelevant, in both the analytical and empirical analyses. The latter {{can be viewed as a}} case study; it considers S&P 500 firms at two points in time, and the data was hand-collected in real time from a public website (Yahoo!Finance). This scheme ensures perfectly synchronized data and it usefully provides not only consensus forecasts but also real time betas. Overall, the paper contributes by developing valuation concepts and by showing how these can be evaluated empirically. School of Accounting and Financ...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT. In {{the present}} paper we conduct a deep study on some basic {{concepts}} of fi-nancial mathematics. The financial mathematics involves several mathematical tools (even though at elementary level). But these tools are not organized in a theoretical framework. This circumstance affected badly {{on the development of}} financial mathematics and its ap-plications. The aim {{of this paper is to}} present the building of a theoretical structure for the basic part of financial mathematics, all with elementary mathematics. In particular, the goal consists of describing the “evolution ” of an amount of money as a time dependent-process, using the one parameter families of operators. The generalization to the case of the evolution of a portfolio of goods is very natural. In section 1, we define the capitalizations and the family of the <b>capitalization</b> <b>factors</b> of a <b>capitalization.</b> In section 2, we give a definition of capitalization law, more general than the usual one. Furthermore, we introduce the main concept of the paper: the family of operators of a capitalization law. In section 3, we connect the financial laws to the capitalizations. In section 4, we introduce a subclass of capitalization laws (the self-actualizing capi-talization laws). Finally, we characterize them and the classic separable financial laws in the new framework. We have to note that almost all the proofs of the paper are straightforward computa-tions. Nevertheless, we resolved to give them, we did it not so many for desire of com-pletness, but, above all, to build a bridge beetwen the language and thoughts of economists and mathematicians. 1.

40|$|This study appraises {{the impact}} of Spin-off {{decisions}} {{in addition to the}} determinants of share price movement for Malaysian listed companies between 1986 to 2002. The empirical evidence from a sample of 85 Spin-offs shows positive and affirmative announcement effects on stock prices. The parent of the Spin-off companies encounters positive abnormal returns for the two days before and after the announcement day while the Spin-off companies experience comparable effect after the listing date. The analysis is done over a period of 100 days prior and 50 days subsequent to the announcement day. Three different approaches incorporating non-synchronous _ adjustment, i. e. Risk-adjusted, Market-adjusted and Control Sample-adjusted Market Models, were drawn on in the research methodology. Tax, Age, Market <b>Capitalization</b> and Focus <b>factors</b> were considered as possible determinants of Spin-off performance. However, the findings reveal that only Market <b>Capitalization</b> and Age <b>factors</b> are significant to the market price variation. The Cumulative Abnormal Returns surrounding the spin-off announcement day is positively correlated to the Market Capitalization but negatively correlated to the Age. In conclusion, this study validates that {{the impact of}} the returns is determined by the size and conventional age of the companies. The large companies and those that are newly incorporated tend to have a bigger magnitude of the positive wealth effect...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we use survey data to examine support among voters from {{different}} age cohorts for public school spending. The survey asked potential voters in California how {{they intended to}} vote on two initiatives, one a statewide initiative that would increase spending on public schools throughout {{the state and the}} other a local initiative that would increase spending only in the respondent 2 ̆ 7 s local school district. We find that older voters without children generally oppose increases in state spending but are much more willing to support local spending. We examine two explanations for this voting pattern, namely the capitalization of local spending into housing values and intergenerational altruism. Our results do not strongly favor one explanation over the other. Consequently, we conclude that both <b>factors</b> (<b>capitalization</b> and intergenerational altruism) probably play important roles in sustaining support among older voters for local school spending...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the effects of}} bank competition on the risk-taking behaviors of banks in 10 Latin American countries between 2003 and 2008. We conduct our empirical approach in two steps. First, we estimate the Boone indicator, which {{is a measure of}} competition. We then regress this measure and other explanatory variables on the banking "stability inefficiency" derived simultaneously from the estimation of a stability stochastic frontier. Unlike previous findings, this paper concludes that competition affects risk-taking behavior in a non-linear way as both high and low competition levels enhance financial stability, while we find the opposite effect for average competition. In addition, bank size and <b>capitalization</b> are essential <b>factors</b> in explaining this relationship. On the one hand, the larger a bank is, the more it benefits from competition. On the other hand, a greater capital ratio is advantageous for banks that operate in collusive markets, while capitalization only enhances the stability of larger banks under high and average competition. These results are of extreme importance when considering bank regulations, {{especially in light of the}} recent turmoil in the global financial markets. (C) 2012 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|To {{what extent}} are the factors of the Fama-French-Factor Asset Pricing Model related to rates of returns of the Stephen F. Austin State University Student Investment Roundtable Fund? The Fama-French Model is {{believed}} to be a major improvement over the ever-popular Capital Asset Pricing Model, CAPM. The Capital Asset Pricing Model uses a single factor beta to compare the excess returns of a portfolio with the excess returns of the market as a whole, but is said to oversimplify the complex market. On the other hand, the Fama-French Model three-factor adds additional factors to the original CAPM equation. The Fama-French Model adds a factor for stocks with comparably low market <b>capitalization</b> and another <b>factor</b> for stocks with a high book to market value. Historically, these two types of stocks have tended to have had higher rates of return than the overall market. The addition of these two variables for the CSPM equation improves the accuracy of results. The Fama-French Three Factor model explains over 90 % of the variation in excess returns of diversified portfolios returns compared with the average 80 % given by the CAPM. Our goal is to determine the magnitude of explanatory power of the two additional Fama-French factors compared to the market rate of which the SIRF is expected to follow...|$|R
40|$|The present {{research}} “The {{assets of the}} company - a theoretical and practical approach relating particularlyto intellectual capital” focuses on defining the company’s assets, at national level, establishing the components ofthis concept, so that ultimately we can determine the position of the intellectual capital in the total assets of a companyand {{the manner in which they}} can be approached. The theoretical approach is based on the theoretical framework for the identification of the company’s assets,referring to the intellectual capital. The practical approach exemplified through the interview technique is trying toidentify whether the theoretical basis of the intellectual capital can also be transposed into accounting practice. The approach of these terms begins with a short incursion of definitions that refer to assets, intangible assets -intellectual capital, followed by a description of the intellectual capital components and their identification at nationallevel through a practical study.

40|$|We {{study the}} {{volatility}} time series of 1137 most traded {{stocks in the}} US stock markets for the two-year period 2001 - 02 and analyze their return intervals τ, which are time intervals between volatilities above a given threshold q. We explore the probability density function of τ, P_q(τ), assuming a stretched exponential function, P_q(τ) ∼ e^-τ^γ. We find that the exponent γ depends on the threshold in the range between q= 1 and 6 standard deviations of the volatility. This finding supports the multiscaling nature of the return interval distribution. To better understand the multiscaling origin, we study how γ depends on four essential <b>factors,</b> <b>capitalization,</b> risk, number of trades and return. We show that γ depends on the capitalization, risk and return but almost {{does not depend on}} the number of trades. This suggests that γ relates to the portfolio selection but not on the market activity. To further characterize the multiscaling of individual stocks, we fit the moments of τ, μ_m ≡) ^m>^ 1 /m, in the range of 10 < 100 by a power-law, μ_m ∼ ^δ. The exponent δ is found also to depend on the capitalization, risk and return but not on the number of trades, and its tendency is opposite to that of γ. Moreover, we show that δ decreases with γ approximately by a linear relation. The return intervals demonstrate the temporal structure of volatilities and our findings suggest that their multiscaling features may be helpful for portfolio optimization. ...|$|R
