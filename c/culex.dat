5|$|Although Nepenthes rajah is {{most famous}} for {{trapping}} and digesting animals, its pitchers are also host {{to a large}} number of other organisms, which are thought to form a mutually beneficial (symbiotic) association with the plant. Many of these animals are so specialised that they cannot survive anywhere else, and are referred to as nepenthebionts. N. rajah has two such mosquito taxa named after it: <b>Culex</b> rajah and Toxorhynchites rajah.|$|E
5|$|The disease runs most {{rampant in}} the {{subtropical}} conditions which encourage reproduction of its mosquito vectors among which <b>Culex</b> tarsalis is most significant. Mortality rates {{appear to be}} higher than those in other birds, causing local population losses of up to 72% in a single season. Because of this, American crows are a sentinel species indicating the presence of West Nile virus in an area. Crows cannot transmit the virus to humans directly.|$|E
5|$|A {{study in}} La Plata, Argentina shows the {{potential}} for planarians such as Girardia anceps, Mesostoma ehrenbergii, and Bothromesostoma evelinae to reduce populations of the mosquito species Aedes aegypti and <b>Culex</b> pipiens. The experiment showed that G. anceps in particular can prey on all instars of both mosquito species and maintain a steady predation rate over time. The ability for these flatworms to live in artificial containers showed the potential of placing these species in popular mosquito breeding sites, which would ideally {{reduce the amount of}} mosquito-borne diseases.|$|E
5|$|Britain's Sir Ronald Ross, an army surgeon {{working in}} Secunderabad India, proved in 1897 that malaria is {{transmitted}} by mosquitoes, an event now commemorated via World Mosquito Day. He {{was able to}} find pigmented malaria parasites in a mosquito that he artificially fed on a malaria patient who had crescents in his blood. He continued his research into malaria by showing that certain mosquito species (<b>Culex</b> fatigans) transmit malaria to sparrows and he isolated malaria parasites from the salivary glands of mosquitoes that had fed on infected birds. He reported this to the British Medical Association in Edinburgh in 1898.|$|E
5|$|Thermus aquaticus is a {{bacterium}} {{found in the}} Yellowstone hot springs that produces an important enzyme (Taq polymerase) that is easily replicated in the lab and is useful in replicating DNA {{as part of the}} polymerase chain reaction (PCR) process. The retrieval of these bacteria can be achieved with no impact to the ecosystem. Other bacteria in the Yellowstone hot springs may also prove useful to scientists who are searching for cures for various diseases. In 2016, researchers from Uppsala University reported the discovery of a class of thermophiles, Hadesarchaea, in Yellowstone's <b>Culex</b> Basin. These organisms are capable of converting carbon monoxide and water to carbon dioxide and oxygen.|$|E
5|$|As {{with other}} bird families, {{pelicans}} {{are susceptible to}} a variety of parasites. Specialist feather lice of the genus Piagetella are found in the pouches of all species of pelican, but are otherwise only known from New World and Antarctic cormorants. Avian malaria is carried by the mosquito <b>Culex</b> pipens, and high densities of these biting insects may force pelican colonies to be abandoned. Leeches may attach to the vent or sometimes the inside of the pouch. A study of the parasites of the American white pelican found 75 different species, including tapeworms, flukes, flies, fleas, ticks and nematodes. Many of these do little harm, but flies may be implicated in the death of nestlings, particularly if they are weak or unwell, and the soft tick Ornithodoros capensis sometimes causes adults to desert the nest. Many pelican parasites are found in other bird groups, but several lice are very host-specific.|$|E
25|$|Typical genera are <b>Culex,</b> Aedes, and Anopheles.|$|E
25|$|The Asian tiger {{mosquito}} is similar, {{in terms of}} its close socialization with humans, to the common house mosquito (<b>Culex</b> pipiens). Among other differences in their biology, <b>Culex</b> pipiens prefers larger breeding waters and is more tolerant to cold. In this respect, no significant competition or suppression between the two species likely occurs.|$|E
25|$|A {{paper in}} Science found that <b>Culex</b> pipiens {{mosquitoes}} existed in two populations in Europe, one which bites birds {{and one which}} bites humans. In North America 40% of <b>Culex</b> pipiens {{were found to be}} hybrids of the two types which bite both birds and humans, providing a vector for West Nile virus. This is thought to provide an explanation of why the West Nile disease has spread more quickly in North America than Europe.|$|E
25|$|Mosquitoes {{of the genera}} <b>Culex,</b> Anopheles, Culiseta, Mansonia and Aedes may act as insect hosts {{for various}} Plasmodium species. The best studies of these have been the Anopheles {{mosquitoes}} which host Plasmodium parasites that cause human malaria, as well as <b>Culex</b> mosquitoes which host the Plasmodium species that cause malaria in birds. In all cases, only female mosquitoes can be infected with Plasmodium species, since only the females feed on the blood of vertebrate hosts.|$|E
25|$|Tularemia, a {{bacterial}} disease caused by Francisella tularensis, is variously transmitted, including by biting flies. <b>Culex</b> and Culiseta are vectors of tularemia, {{as well as}} arbovirus infections such as West Nile virus.|$|E
25|$|JEV is {{generally}} spread by mosquitoes, specifically {{those of the}} <b>Culex</b> type. Pigs and wild birds serve as a reservoir for the virus. The disease mostly occurs outside of cities. Diagnosis is based on blood or cerebrospinal fluid testing.|$|E
25|$|These infect {{a variety}} of bird species. In general each species of Plasmodium infects one to a few species of birds. Each species is also {{generally}} transmitted by a single insect species. Insect hosts include Aedes aegypti, Mansionia crassipes, and various <b>Culex</b> species.|$|E
25|$|Chilodonella uncinata has a {{cosmopolitan}} distribution. It is suspected {{to act as}} a facultative endoparasite of the larvae of the <b>Culex,</b> Aedes, and Anopheles mosquito larva. It lives in fresh water ponds, lakes, creeks, and bayous where it feeds on bacteria and other microbes.|$|E
25|$|In {{species that}} {{lay their eggs}} in rafts, rafts do not form adventitiously; the female <b>Culex</b> settles {{carefully}} on still water with its hind legs crossed, and as it lays the eggs one by one, it twitches to arrange them into a head-down array that sticks together to form the raft.|$|E
25|$|All Plasmodium {{species are}} {{parasitic}} and require both a vertebrate host and an insect host to reproduce. Known vertebrate hosts include various primates (including humans), birds, rodents, bats, porcupines and squirrels. Mosquitoes {{of the genera}} <b>Culex,</b> Anopheles, Culiseta, Mansonia and Aedes often serve as insect hosts for various Plasmodium species.|$|E
25|$|Plasmodium {{species have}} been {{reported}} from over 3200 species of lizard and 29 species of snake. Only three species — P. pessoai, P. tomodoni and P. wenyoni — infect snakes. Species infecting lizards {{have been reported in}} relatively few insect hosts, including Lutzomyia and Culicoides species, <b>Culex</b> fatigans and Aedes aegypti.|$|E
25|$|The {{species is}} {{considered}} a human ally against the West Nile virus, as the individuals consume <b>Culex</b> mosquito larvae. They also are used as a biological agent in Japan, eating weeds in rice paddies. In Wyoming, the presence of Triops longicaudatus usually indicates {{a good chance of}} the hatching of spadefoot frogs.|$|E
25|$|Even more dramatically, {{in most of}} {{its range}} in North America, the main vector for the Western equine {{encephalitis}} virus is <b>Culex</b> tarsalis, because it is known to feed variously on mammals, birds, reptiles, and amphibians. Even fish may be attacked by some mosquito species if they expose themselves above water level, as mudskippers do.|$|E
25|$|The {{mosquito}} {{group can}} be divided into two branches: one branch contains the neurotropic viruses, often associated with encephalitic disease in humans or livestock. This branch tends to be spread by <b>Culex</b> species and to have bird reservoirs. The second branch is the non-neurotropic viruses which are associated with haemorrhagic disease in humans. These tend to have Aedes species as vectors and primate hosts.|$|E
25|$|The {{virus is}} not {{contagious}} and is spread only by mosquitoes. The main reservoir hosts are kangaroos and wallabies, although horses, possums and possibly birds and flying foxes play a role. Over 30 {{species have been}} implicated as possible vectors, but the major species for Ross River Fever are <b>Culex</b> annulirostris in inland areas, Aedes vigilax in northern coastal regions and Ae. camptorhynchus in southern coastal regions.|$|E
25|$|Corvids are {{reservoirs}} (carriers) for the West Nile {{virus in}} the United States. They are infected by mosquitoes (the vectors), primarily of the <b>Culex</b> species. Crows and ravens are quickly killed by this disease, so their deaths are an early-warning system when West Nile virus arrives {{in an area}} (as are horse and other bird species deaths). One of the first signs that West Nile virus first arrived in the US in 1999 was the death of crows in New York.|$|E
25|$|When {{a female}} reproduces without such {{parasitic}} meals, {{it is said}} to practice autogenous reproduction, as in Toxorhynchites; otherwise, the reproduction may be termed anautogenous, as occurs in mosquito species that serve as disease vectors, particularly Anopheles and {{some of the most important}} disease vectors in the genus Aedes. In contrast, some mosquitoes, for example, many <b>Culex,</b> are partially anautogenous: they do not need a blood meal for their first cycle of egg production, which they produce autogenously; however, subsequent clutches of eggs are produced anautogenously, at which point their disease vectoring activity becomes operative.|$|E
25|$|Batken {{virus was}} first {{isolated}} from hard-bodied ticks {{of the species}} Hyalomma plumbeum plumbeum infesting sheep {{near the town of}} Batken, Kirghizia, now in Kyrgyzstan, in 1970. It has also been found to infect mosquitoes of the species Aedes caspius Pallas and <b>Culex</b> hortensis Ficalbi, also in Kyrgyzstan. Its geographical range is limited to Central Asia, Transcaucasia and the area {{to the north of the}} Caspian Sea. In the laboratory it is highly pathogenic for mice, hamsters and chickens. The virion is variable in shape, with spherical and filamentous forms being observed; it has a diameter of 50–100nm. Batken is considered a DHOV subtype; the viruses have a high degree of sequence identity (90% in the envelope glycoprotein; 96–98% in other proteins), and their antibodies crossreact.|$|E
25|$|Countries {{which have}} had major {{epidemics}} in the past, but which have controlled the disease primarily by vaccination, include China, South Korea, Japan, Taiwan and Thailand. Other countries that still have periodic epidemics include Vietnam, Cambodia, Myanmar, India, Nepal, and Malaysia. Japanese encephalitis {{has been reported}} in the Torres Strait Islands and two fatal cases were reported in mainland northern Australia in 1998. There were reported cases in Kachin State, Myanmar in 2013. The spread of the virus in Australia is of particular concern to Australian health officials due to the unplanned introduction of <b>Culex</b> gelidus, a potential vector of the virus, from Asia. However, the current presence on mainland Australia is minimal. There had been 116 deaths reported in Odisha's backward Malkangiri district of India in 2016.|$|E
25|$|Over 3,500 {{species of}} the Culicidae have already been described. They are {{generally}} divided into two subfamilies which in turn comprise some 43 genera. These figures are subject to continual change, as more species are discovered, and as DNA studies compel rearrangement of the taxonomy of the family. The two main subfamilies are the Anophelinae and Culicinae, with their genera {{as shown in the}} subsection below. The distinction is of great practical importance because the two subfamilies tend to differ in their significance as vectors of different classes of diseases. Roughly speaking, arboviral diseases such as yellow fever and dengue fever tend to be transmitted by Culicine species, not necessarily in the genus <b>Culex.</b> Some transmit various species of avian malaria, {{but it is not clear}} that they ever transmit any form of human malaria. Some species do however transmit various forms of filariasis, much as many Simuliidae do.|$|E
25|$|With {{regard to}} host location, female {{mosquitoes}} hunt their blood host by detecting organic substances such as carbon dioxide (CO2) and 1-octen-3-ol produced from the host, and through visual recognition. Mosquitoes prefer some people over others. The preferred victim's sweat simply smells better than others' {{because of the}} proportions of the carbon dioxide, octenol and other compounds that make up body odor. The most powerful semiochemical that triggers the keen sense of smell of <b>Culex</b> quinquefasciatus is nonanal. Another compound identified in human blood that attracts mosquitoes is sulcatone or 6-methyl-5-hepten-2-one, especially for Aedes aegypti mosquitoes with the odor receptor gene Or4. A {{large part of the}} mosquito’s sense of smell, or olfactory system, is devoted to sniffing out blood sources. Of 72 types of odor receptors on its antennae, at least 27 are tuned to detect chemicals found in perspiration. In Aedes, the search for a host takes place in two phases. First, the mosquito exhibits a nonspecific searching behavior until the perception of host stimulants, then it follows a targeted approach.|$|E
500|$|As {{the size}} and shape of Nepenthes {{pitchers}} vary greatly between species, but little within a given taxon, it is not surprising that many infaunal organisms are specially adapted to life in only the traps of particular species. [...] N. rajah is no exception, and in fact has two mosquito taxa named after it. [...] <b>Culex</b> (Culiciomyia) rajah and Toxorhynchites (Toxorhynchites) rajah were described by Masuhisa Tsukamoto in 1989, based on larvae collected in pitchers of N. rajah on Mount Kinabalu three years earlier. The two species were found to live in association with larvae of <b>Culex</b> (Lophoceraomyia) jenseni, Uranotaenia (Pseudoficalbia) moultoni and an undescribed taxon, Tripteroides (Rachionotomyia) sp. No. 2. Concerning C. rajah, Tsukamoto noted that the [...] "body surface of most larvae are covered in Vorticella-like protozoa". At present, nothing is known of this species with regards to its adult biology, habitat, or medical importance as a vector of diseases. The same is true for T. rajah; nothing is known of its biology except that adults are not haematophagous.|$|E
500|$|Another species, <b>Culex</b> shebbearei, {{has also}} been {{recorded}} as an infaunal organism of N. rajah in the past. The original 1931 record by F. W. Edwards {{is based on a}} collection by H. M. Pendlebury in 1929 from a plant growing on Mount Kinabalu. However, Tsukamoto notes that in light of new information on these species, [...] "it seems more likely to conclude that the species [...] is a new species which has been misidentitied as C. shebbearei for a long time, rather than to think that both C. shebbearei and C. rajah n. sp. are living in pitchers of Nepenthes rajah on Mt. Kinabalu".|$|E
500|$|West Nile virus, a flavivirus, [...] {{was first}} {{identified}} in 1937 {{when it was}} found in the blood of a feverish woman. The virus, which is carried by mosquitoes and birds, caused outbreaks of infection in North Africa and the Middle East in the 1950s and by the 1960s horses in Europe [...] fell victim. The largest outbreak in humans occurred in 1974 in Cape Province, South Africa and 10,000 people became ill. An increasing frequency of epidemics and epizootics (in horses) began in 1996, around the Mediterranean basin, and by 1999 the virus had reached New York City. Since then the virus has spread throughout the US. In the US, mosquitoes carry the highest amounts of virus in late summer, and the number of cases of the disease increases in mid July to early September. When the weather becomes colder, the mosquitoes die and the risk of disease decreases. In Europe, many outbreaks have occurred; [...] in 2000 a surveillance programme began in the UK to monitor the incidence of the virus in humans, dead birds, mosquitoes and horses. The mosquito (<b>Culex</b> modestus) that can carry the virus breeds on the marshes of north Kent. This mosquito species was not previously thought to be present in the UK, but it is widespread in southern Europe where it carries West Nile virus.|$|E
2500|$|Biting {{stress can}} be severe in varied climatic regions (cold {{northern}} or tropics) or conditions of much surface water available for breeding where populations of mosquitoes can become dense. Species of Aedes, Anopheles and Psorophora genera transmit equine encephalitis viruses to horses. <b>Culex,</b> Aedes and Anopheles species of mosquito transmit Plasmodium protozoa that cause types of malaria in birds. <b>Culex</b> mosquitoes transmit West Nile virus between birds and horses; they transmit Rift Valley fever virus to livestock species and humans. The nematode worm Dirofilaria immitis that causes heartworm disease in dogs is transmitted by species of <b>Culex</b> and Aedes. See photograph of microfilaria stage of Dirofilaria immitus in blood of dog; adult worms in dog's heart grow to several centimeters long. (Mosquitoes are of major importance as transmitters of {{many types of}} pathogenic microorganisms to humans causing diseases such as Malaria and Yellow fever. Plasmodium species causing malaria in humans are exclusively transmitted by Anopheles mosquitoes.) ...|$|E
2500|$|Diptera: Oesyrus (botflies), Tipula (crane flies), Musca (house flies), Tabanus (horse flies), <b>Culex</b> (mosquitoes), Empis (dance flies), Conops (thick-headed flies), Asilus (robber flies), Bombylius (bee flies) & Hippobosca (louse flies) ...|$|E
2500|$|Human, cattle, {{and horses}} are {{dead-end}} hosts as the disease manifests as fatal encephalitis. [...] Swine {{acts as an}} amplifying host and has {{a very important role}} in the epidemiology of the disease. [...] Infection in swine is asymptomatic, except in pregnant sows, when abortion and fetal abnormalities are common sequelae. The most important vector is <b>Culex</b> tritaeniorhynchus, which feeds on cattle in preference to humans. It has been proposed that moving swine away from human habitation can divert the mosquito away from humans and swine. The natural hosts of the Japanese encephalitis virus are birds, not humans, and many believe the virus will therefore never be completely eliminated. [...] In November 2011, the Japanese encephalitis virus was reported in <b>Culex</b> bitaeniorhynchus in South Korea.|$|E
2500|$|Some other species, {{for example}} {{members of the}} genus Mansonia, lay their eggs in arrays, {{attached}} usually to the under-surfaces of waterlily pads. Their close relatives, the genus Coquillettidia, lay their eggs similarly, but not attached to plants. Instead, the eggs form layers called [...] "rafts" [...] that float on the water. This is a common mode of oviposition, and most species of <b>Culex</b> are known for the habit, which also occurs in some other genera, such as Culiseta and Uranotaenia. Anopheles eggs may on occasion cluster together on the water, too, but the clusters do not generally look much like compactly glued rafts of eggs.|$|E
2500|$|In 1894, a British-Australian entomologist, Frederick A. Askew Skuse, was {{the first}} to scientifically {{describe}} the Asian tiger mosquito, which he named <b>Culex</b> albopictus (lat. [...] "gnat", [...] "midge" [...] and [...] "white-painted"). Later, the species was assigned to the genus Aedes (gr. , [...] "unpleasant") and referred to as Aedes albopictus. Like the yellow fever mosquito, it belongs to the subgenus Stegomyia (Gr. , [...] "covered, roofed", referring to the scales that completely cover the dorsal surface in this subgenus, and , [...] "fly") within the Aedes genus. In 2004, scientists explored higher-level relationships and proposed a new classification within the Aedes genus and Stegomyia was elevated to the genus level, making Aedes albopictus now Stegomyia albopicta. This is, however, a controversial matter, and the use of Stegomyia albopicta versus Aedes albopictus is continually debated.|$|E
60|$|The {{interview}} {{could hardly}} have ended more auspiciously for Tito, and as he walked out at the Porta Pinti that he might laugh a little at his ease over the affair of the <b>culex,</b> he felt that fortune could hardly mean to turn her back on him again at present, since she had taken him by the hand in this decided way.|$|E
