40|$|The {{direction}} angle {{sensitivity of}} agricultural field backscatter is studied. The direction angle {{is defined as}} the angle between the incident plane and the perpendicular to the row direction. Maximum backscatter power from an angricultural field is expected to occur when the furrow induced slopes are oriented towards the radar, i. e., for a 0 deg direction angle. This effect is known as the <b>cardinal</b> <b>effect.</b> Because of the way the looks are formed in the NASA/JPL airborne synthetic aperture radar (AIRSAR) processor, each look corresponds to a slightly different squint angle. This provides a unique data set to analyze the <b>cardinal</b> <b>effect,</b> as it allows simultaneous observations of the backscatter of a field for sixteen different direction angles. The backscatter variations of the agricultural fields with direction angle at P-, L-, and C-bands is described. The observed variations in backscatter are compared with model predictions. The model predicts that the maximum backscatter occurs for a 0 deg direction angle, but underestimates the backscatter variations with direction angle by more than 10 dB...|$|E

40|$|In {{an earlier}} experiment, {{participants}} played a perfect information game against a computer, which was programmed to deviate often from its backward induction strategy {{right at the}} beginning of the game. Participants knew that in each game, the computer was nevertheless optimizing against some belief about the participant's future strategy. In the aggregate, it appeared that participants applied forward induction. However, <b>cardinal</b> <b>effects</b> seemed to play a role as well: a number of participants might have been trying to maximize expected utility. In order to find out how people really reason in such a game, we designed centipede-like turn-taking games with new payoff structures in order to make such <b>cardinal</b> <b>effects</b> less likely. We ran a new experiment with 50 participants, based on marble drop visualizations of these revised payoff structures. After participants played 48 test games, we asked a number of questions to gauge the participants' reasoning about their own and the opponent's strategy at all decision nodes of a sample game. We also checked how the verbalized strategies fit to the actual choices they made at all their decision points in the 48 test games. Even though in the aggregate, participants in the new experiment still tend to slightly favor the forward induction choice at their first decision node, their verbalized strategies most often depend on their own attitudes towards risk and those they assign to the computer opponent, sometimes in addition to considerations about cooperativeness and competitiveness.

40|$|Changes in the {{headcount}} rate are {{the standard}} metric for gauging how public transfers and taxes affect US poverty. An alternative strategy, one theoretically more appealing and complete, is {{to rely on}} distribution-sensitive indexes (Sen 1976, 1981). How would policy's measured impacts change if such an approach were to be used? This study provides empirical evidence using three selected poverty indexes from the class developed by Foster et al. (1984). Pre- and post-policy values of each index are estimated for the total population and for twenty-three demographic sub-groups using data from March Current Population Surveys covering the period 1992 to 1998. The {{results indicate that the}} alternative indexes produce consistent ordinal rankings of policy's impact. (In contrast, the measured <b>cardinal</b> <b>effects</b> of policy differ substantially across indexes.) The empirical evidence has a clear implication for anti-poverty policy: government transfers and taxes are effective in lowering poverty headcount rates, in reducing the depth of poverty and in lessening the relative deprivation among the poor.

The pope also appointed Corradini as the Pro-Prefect of the Congregation of the Council in April 1718 and as its full prefect on 26 November 1718 until 1721.

40|$|The {{objective}} of the thesis is to characterize the importance of information and consequently also of knowledge as the bases for active dealing in the stock market. The fundamental terms of information credibility, disinformation and information asymmetry, which have a <b>cardinal</b> <b>effect</b> on behaviour of particular participants of the market, are mentioned in the thesis. The theory of effective markets and the factors due {{to which it is}} not able to explain the development and the real state of the contemporary stock markets, are analysed in more detail in the thesis. A considerable part of the thesis is devoted to the analysis and the definition of information need as a basic requirement for making successful investment decisions of an individual, whereas ways to its fulfilment are implied [...] including a description and a division of available information sources. The description and the analysis of several dealing strategies which are directly based on usage of various kinds of information are not missing in the thesis.

40|$|Development {{practitioners}} {{are coming to}} a consensus that participation by the intended beneficiaries improves project performance. But is there convincing evidence that this is true? Skeptics have three objections: 1) "Participation is not objective [...] project rankings are subjective; 2) this subjectivity leads to"halo effects"; 3) better project performance may have increased beneficiary participation {{rather than the other}} way around [...] a statistical association is not proof of cause and effect. The authors show methodologically how to answer each of these objections. Subjectivity does not preclude reliable <b>cardinal</b> measurement. Halo <b>effects</b> do not appear to induce a strong upward bias in estimating the effect of participation. Finally, instrumental variables estimation can help establish a structural cause and effect relationship between participation and project performance [...] at least in the rural water supply projects they studied.

50|$|Briçonnet {{soon had}} cause to repent the advice {{he had given}} to invade Italy. A {{formidable}} league was formed {{for the purpose of}} cutting off the French retreat, and neither the diplomacy nor the entreaties of the French <b>cardinal</b> had any <b>effect</b> on the hostile generals. The prowess of Charles and the valour of his troops alone saved the French from defeat. With 8,000 men the king defeated, at Fornovo, an army of 40,000, and opened a road to France. Soon after this Briçonnet, induced by a tempting promise of preferment for one of his sons, tried to persuade Charles to break off the peace negotiations and support with an army the Duke of Orleans' claims to the Duchy of Milan. Charles, however, preferred the counsels of Philippe de Comines and sacrificed the interests of the duke, and the king's premature death {{put an end to the}} influence of Briçonnet, Louis XII giving his confidence to the Cardinal d'Amboise.|$|R
40|$|In {{this project}} {{we have worked}} with the game: ‘Kort og Godt’, which is a method to create good social {{well-being}} in the classroom. From a critical point of view we have reflected on and discussed {{the effects of the}} game. In order to answer our <b>cardinal</b> question:” What <b>effect</b> can the game ‘Kort og Godt’ have for the individual child?”, we have analysed the game’s introduction video ‘Gult kort til Ebbe’. In our analysis we have, amongst others, taken use of Michel Foucault and Karsten Hundeide, in order to shed light upon different problems in the empirical work, and thereby place the problems in a theoretical frame. From the analysis we have reached some central problems, which are connected {{to the use of the}} game. In our discussion we focus on these and have reached the following conclusion: the game ‘Kort og Godt’ can have a great influence on the child’s self-perception...|$|R

While Antwerp was the capital of Netherlandish commerce as well as the art market, Brussels was the centre of government. Van Mander tells a story that his mother-in-law pushed for the move to distance him from his established servant girl mistress. [...] By now painting had become his main activity, and his most famous works come from these years. His paintings were much sought after, with patrons including wealthy Flemish collectors and <b>Cardinal</b> Granvelle, in <b>effect</b> the Habsburg chief minister, who was based in Mechelen. Bruegel had two sons, both well known as painters, and a daughter about whom nothing is known. These were Pieter Brueghel the Younger (1564-1638) and Jan Brueghel the Elder (1568-1625); he died too early to train either of them. He died in Brussels on 9 September 1569 and was buried in the Kapellekerk.|$|R

In order to study <b>Cardinal</b> Temperature and <b>effect</b> of fluctuation temperature on Germination of Lesser ceandine tuberous root two separated experiments were conducted at Weed Science Laboratory of Faculty of Agriculture Ferdowsi University of Mashhad in 2008. The experiments were a completely randomized design with four replications, In first experiment, temperatures included 1, 5, 10, 15, 20 and 25 ◦C for cardinal temperature. In second experiment fluctuation temperature, included 5 / 10, 7 / 12, 10 / 15 and 15 / 25 ◦C (13 H night/ 11 H day). Results indicated that optimum temperature was different for big and small tuberous roots. But between base and maximum temperature were not difference. Base and maximum temperatures were about 0 ◦C and 25 ◦C for both big and small tuberous roots. The optimum temperature for big tubers and small tubers were 8 ◦C and 14 ◦C, respectively. The result of fluctuation temperature showed that the highest germination occurred in low temperatures.

Within the gamut of side effects attributable to this drug, ophthalmologic manifestations are of crucial importance. In this study, for the first time, {{the aim was to}} provide a systematic literature review regarding this issue. Methods: For the time period 1996 &ndash; 2011, a PubMed search was made for the studies concerning the adverse/beneficial effects of TPM on vision. Overall, 404 citations {{out of a total of}} 2756 TPM-related studies were examined for relevance. Results: A total of 74 relevant studies were reviewed, 65 of which comprise small observational studies describing the ophthalmic side effects of TPM in 84 patients. Of these patients, 66 were affected by ciliochoroidal effusion syndrome as the <b>cardinal</b> ocular side <b>effect</b> of TPM (17 cases of myopic shift and 49 cases of angle closure glaucoma). A comprehensive statistical analysis is provided on these 66 subjects. Other rare side effects of TPM on the vision were also reviewed, including massive choroidal effusion, ocular inflammatory reactions, visual field defects, probable effects on retina, cornea, and sclera, and neuroophthalmologic complications. In addition, a framework is provided to classify these results. Discussion: Due to the expanding spectrum of indications for the administration of TPM, neurologists and psychiatrists should be aware of its diverse ocular side effects. In conclusion, ocular complications following this drug should be taken seriously and be subjected to ophthalmic counseling.
