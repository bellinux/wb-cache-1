5|$|Bauer met {{fellow student}} Ester Ellqvist at the Royal Swedish Academy of Arts. Ellqvist {{studied at the}} {{separate}} department for women, since women {{were not allowed to}} attend the same classes as the men and their education was conducted in a different manner. So, while Ellqvist was talented and ambitious, she did not have an equal opportunity as her male <b>colleagues</b> <b>to</b> develop her artistry.|$|E
5|$|Eli Lilly {{experienced}} dramatic growth during Daniels' {{tenure at}} the company. Prozac sales made up 30–40% of Lilly's income during the mid-to-late 1990s, and Lilly doubled its assets to $12.8 billion and doubled its revenue to $10 billion during the same period. When Daniels later became Governor of Indiana, he drew heavily on his former Lilly <b>colleagues</b> <b>to</b> serve as advisers and agency managers.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Krycek, who {{has beaten}} Dmitri into telling {{him what he}} saw, orders his Russian <b>colleagues</b> <b>to</b> infect him with the black oil. Back in the United States, Werber {{introduces}} Mulder to the wheelchair-bound Cassandra, who considers him a hero of hers. She claims that the aliens {{are in a state}} of upheaval and that she will be abducted by them again. Mulder tells Cassandra there is nothing he can do for her and leaves.|$|E

5|$|On January 3, 2013, Maloney {{was sworn}} into the 113th United States Congress. On his {{second day in}} office, Maloney spoke on the House floor, criticizing a delay in federal Hurricane Sandy aid, and urging House Speaker John Boehner and his <b>colleagues</b> <b>to</b> pass an aid package.|$|E
5|$|There is {{very limited}} data on reproduction. Young are {{probably}} born near {{the start of the}} rainy season, in November–December, when food is plentiful. Six bats were caught at the roost site in Kianjavato, of which only one was a male; this led Bates and <b>colleagues</b> <b>to</b> suggest that the species may be polygynous, with groups consisting of a male and multiple females.|$|E
5|$|Already in 1951, {{relationships}} {{had deteriorated}} enough for Pollock, Newman, Still and Rothko to approach Betty Parsons {{with the idea}} of showing them exclusively, effectively leaving their erstwhile <b>colleagues</b> <b>to</b> fend for themselves. She declined the offer. Over the following three years Pollock, Still and Rothko moved to the Sidney Janis Gallery. After the failure of fellow artists to defend his show at Betty Parsons in 1951 and not been included in the 1952 Fifteen Americans show at the Museum of Modern Art, Newman did not show in New York again until 1959.|$|E
50|$|In 1809 Robberds {{acted as}} {{assistant}} tutor in classics. He began to preach at Filby, Norfolk, {{during the summer}} vacation of 1809. Leaving York at midsummer 1810, he preached {{for a few months}} at the Octagon Chapel, Norwich, and was invited to settle there as <b>colleague</b> <b>to</b> Theophilus Browne; but on 19 December 1810 he was called to Cross Street Chapel, Manchester, in succession to Ralph Harrison, and as <b>colleague</b> <b>to</b> John Grundy.|$|R

5|$|During {{a congressional}} recess in July 1878, Hayes finally sacked Arthur and Cornell (Sharpe's term had expired) and {{appointed}} replacements. When Congress reconvened, Sherman pressured his former Senate <b>colleagues</b> <b>to</b> confirm the President's replacement nominees, {{which they did}} after considerable debate. Jay and other reformers criticized Sherman the next year when he traveled to New York to speak on Cornell's behalf in his campaign for governor of New York. Sherman replied {{that it was important}} that the Republican party win the election there, despite their intra-party differences. His friendliness may also have related, as Arthur's biographer Thomas C. Reeves suggests, to a desire to keep Conkling's New York machine friendly to him as the 1880 presidential election approached.|$|E
5|$|During production, {{the actress}} playing {{the leader of}} the factory workers, Yōko Yaguchi, was chosen by her <b>colleagues</b> <b>to</b> present their demands to the director. She and Kurosawa were {{constantly}} at loggerheads, and it was through these arguments that the two, paradoxically, became close. They married on May 21, 1945, with Yaguchi two months pregnant (she never resumed her acting career), and the couple would remain together until her death in 1985. They would have two children: a son, Hisao, born December 20, 1945, who would serve as producer on some of his father's last projects, and Kazuko, a daughter, born April 29, 1954, who would become a costume designer.|$|E
5|$|Goldsmith scored The Motion Picture over {{a period}} of three to four months, a {{relatively}} relaxed schedule compared to typical production, but time pressures resulted in Goldsmith bringing on <b>colleagues</b> <b>to</b> assist in the work. Alexander Courage, composer of the original Star Trek theme, provided arrangements to accompany Kirk's log entries, while Fred Steiner wrote eleven cues of additional music, notably the music to accompany the Enterprise achieving warp speed and first meeting V'Ger. The rush to finish the rest of the film impacted the score. The final recording session finished at 2:00 am on December 1, only five days before the film's release.|$|E

5|$|Hiʻiaka is {{the outer}} and, at roughly 350km in diameter, the larger and {{brighter}} {{of the two}} moons. Strong absorption features observed at 1.5, 1.65 and 2 µm in its infrared spectrum are consistent with nearly pure crystalline water ice covering much of its surface. The unusual spectrum, and its similarity to absorption lines in the spectrum of Haumea, led Brown and <b>colleagues</b> <b>to</b> conclude that {{it was unlikely that}} the system of moons was formed by the gravitational capture of passing Kuiper belt objects into orbit around the dwarf planet: instead, the Haumean moons must be fragments of Haumea itself.|$|E
5|$|Holloman {{was born}} in Thomaston, Georgia, and moved to Athens, Georgia with his family when he was 17. In Athens, he met Nan Stevens, the two were married on January 24, 1942, and they later had one son. He served as a Seabee for the United States Navy during World War II. After {{returning}} from the war, Holloman became an apprentice in a machine shop for the Georgia Railroad in Macon, Georgia. While working there, he played amateur baseball, and did well enough for his <b>colleagues</b> <b>to</b> convince him {{to try out for}} the Macon Peaches, the local baseball team. He did so, and he was assigned to the Class D Moultrie Packers, where he began his professional career.|$|E
5|$|In late September 2010, the Supreme Court {{considered}} removing presidential immunity. In October, Chief Justice Chaudry {{met with}} his <b>colleagues</b> <b>to</b> discuss troubling media rumours that Zardari's government was planning to fire them; Chaudry requested government assurance that the stories were unfounded. In early January 2011, Zardari signed the 19th Amendment, which lessened the likelihood of future clashes between the President and the judiciary by strengthening {{the power of the}} Chief Justice in deciding judicial appointments.|$|E

5|$|In {{the period}} between 1918 and 1928, the WFL in Swansea {{produced}} two prominent activists in Emily Frost Phipps and her close friend Clara Neal, who were founder members of their branch. Phipps and Neal were teachers and activists, both serving {{as president of the}} National Union of Women Teachers and used that platform to press for equal franchise. Phipps also used her position as editor of the Woman Teacher to urge her <b>colleagues</b> <b>to</b> support public meetings and demonstrations.|$|E
5|$|Ninox boobook fusca {{is found}} on Timor, Roma, Leti and Semau Islands {{in the eastern}} Lesser Sunda Islands. It was {{described}} by Veillot in 1817 as Strix fusca. It has a more grey-brown plumage with no red tinge, unlike other subspecies. it has grey streaks on its belly and white spots on its secondaries, inner wing-coverts and nape. Genetic and call analysis show it to be markedly divergent to the Australian populations of the southern boobook, leading Gwee and <b>colleagues</b> <b>to</b> suggest it be reclassified as a separate species. Its calls are shorter and more frequent than subspecies boobook.|$|E
5|$|Ninox boobook plesseni {{is known}} from Pantar and Alor Islands {{in the eastern}} Lesser Sunda Islands. It was {{described}} by Erwin Stresemann in 1929. The upperparts are grey-brown and heavily spotted and marked with white, giving rise to a cross-barred pattern on its back. Its underparts have longitudinal white streaks and its tail is prominently barred. It lives in Eucalyptus urophylla woodlands, and has an unusual low-pitched call different to subspecies boobook. Genetic and call analysis show it to be markedly divergent to the Australian populations of the southern boobook, leading Gwee and <b>colleagues</b> <b>to</b> suggest it be reclassified as a separate species.|$|E

5|$|Ninox boobook rotiensis {{is found}} on Rote Island in the Lesser Sunda Islands. It was first {{described}} in 1997 by Australian biologists Ronald Johnstone and J.C. Darnell from a female {{collected in a}} mist net in 1990. It is smaller than subspecies boobook, with heavily barred primaries, rump and tail. Locally common, it is known to the local people as Tuterui and Kokorok. Genetic and call analysis show it to be markedly divergent from the Australian populations of the southern boobook, leading Gwee and <b>colleagues</b> <b>to</b> suggest it be reclassified as a separate species.|$|E
5|$|On December 20, 2009, {{during a}} {{counseling}} session with two <b>colleagues</b> <b>to</b> discuss her poor time-keeping, Manning {{was told she}} would lose her one day off a week for persistent lateness. She responded by overturning a table, damaging a computer that was sitting on it. A sergeant moved Manning away from the weapons rack, and other soldiers pinned her arms behind her back and dragged {{her out of the}} room. Several witnesses to the incident believed her access to sensitive material ought to have been withdrawn at that point. The following month, January 2010, she began posting on Facebook that she felt hopeless and alone.|$|E
