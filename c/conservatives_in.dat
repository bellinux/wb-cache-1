5|$|As the Angolan Civil War {{began to}} take on a {{diplomatic}} component, in addition to a military one, two key Savimbi allies, The Conservative Caucus' Howard Phillips and the Heritage Foundation's Michael Johns visited Savimbi in Angola, where they sought to persuade Savimbi to come to the United States in the spring of 1989 to help the Conservative Caucus, the Heritage Foundation and other <b>conservatives</b> <b>in</b> making the case for continued U.S. aid to UNITA.|$|E
5|$|Chandler's mentor Harry F. Byrd led a {{group of}} Southern <b>conservatives</b> <b>in</b> the Senate, and through Byrd's influence, Chandler was {{appointed}} to the Committee on Military Affairs. In 1943, he was part of a five-person delegation from the Military Affairs Committee that traveled the world, inspecting U.S. military bases. He vociferously disagreed with Roosevelt's decision to prioritize European operations in World War II over the war in the Pacific.|$|E
5|$|During {{the years}} {{following}} 1857, none of the cabinets survived long. They quickly collapsed {{due to the lack}} of a majority in the Chamber of Deputies. The Conservative Party had split down the middle: on one side were the ultraconservatives, and on the other, the moderate <b>conservatives.</b> <b>In</b> the wake of Carneiro Leão's cabinet, a new generation of politicians had emerged, eager to acquire more power inside the Conservative Party. Paranhos belonged to this younger age group. These men saw their path to the top ranks as being blocked by the Conservative elders, who would not easily relinquish control.|$|E
50|$|Méthot made {{attempts}} {{to gain a}} Canadian House of Commons seat at the Three Rivers riding, first as a <b>Conservative</b> <b>in</b> the 1935 election then as a Progressive <b>Conservative</b> <b>in</b> the 1945 election. He was unsuccessful with both these campaigns.|$|R
50|$|Measured from a party {{point of}} view, four wards changed hands partly or wholly in 1979, {{compared}} to the previous full-council elections in 1976. In two of those wards the councillors stayed the same but fought under a different party label. In Tongham a councillor who had been elected as an Independent <b>Conservative</b> <b>in</b> 1976 was reelected as a <b>Conservative</b> <b>in</b> 1979. The reverse occurred in Lovelace where a councillor who had been elected as a <b>Conservative</b> <b>in</b> 1976 was reelected as an Independent in 1979.|$|R

5|$|Fairman {{discusses}} {{the efforts of}} <b>conservatives</b> <b>in</b> the United States to censor the word from common parlance in the country, and says these acts {{are opposed to the}} First Amendment to the United States Constitution. Fairman warns against a tendency toward self-censorship. He explains that those who choose to silence themselves tacitly encourage a process by which speech is forbidden through the legal process. He argues that this passivity has an impact of increasing the taboo nature of the word.|$|E
5|$|In Iran, as of May 2014, {{according}} to its Yoga Association, there were approximately 200 yoga centres in the country, a quarter {{of them in the}} capital Tehran, where groups can often be seen practising in parks. This has been met by opposition among <b>conservatives.</b> <b>In</b> May 2009, Turkey's head of the Directorate of Religious Affairs, Ali Bardakoğlu, discounted personal development techniques such as reiki and yoga as commercial ventures that could lead to extremism. His comments were made in the context of reiki and yoga possibly being a form of proselytization at the expense of Islam.|$|E
5|$|In July 1857, Macdonald {{departed}} for Britain to promote Canadian government projects. On {{his return to}} Canada, he was appointed premier {{in place of the}} retiring Taché, just in time to lead the <b>Conservatives</b> <b>in</b> a general election. Macdonald was elected in Kingston by 1,189votes to 9 for John Shaw, who was subsequently hanged in effigy; other Conservatives, however, did badly in Canada West, and only French-Canadian support kept Macdonald in power. On 28 December, Isabella Macdonald died, leaving John A. Macdonald a widower with a seven-year-old son. Hugh John Macdonald would be principally raised by his paternal aunt and her husband.|$|E

5|$|In the Khaki Election of 1900, {{nationalist}} {{concern with}} the Boer War meant that the Conservatives and their Liberal Unionist allies gained a majority of Scottish seats for the first time, although the Liberals regained their ascendancy in the next election. Various organisations, including the Independent Labour Party, joined to make the British Labour Party in 1906, with Keir Hardie as its first chairman. The Unionists and Conservatives merged in 1912, usually known as the <b>Conservatives</b> <b>in</b> England and Wales, they adopted the name Unionist Party in Scotland.|$|E
5|$|On social issues, Lynch is {{considered}} a conservative to moderate Democrat. He is pro-life and has been attacked by pro-choice group NARAL. He sided with <b>conservatives</b> <b>in</b> the 2005 Terri Schiavo case, voting for federal court intervention in the case. In more recent years, he has advocated for and defended funding for Planned Parenthoood. He has sided with Democratic leaders on gay rights issues, however, opposing a Federal Marriage Amendment and supporting granting medical benefits to domestic partners of federal employees. He supports same-sex marriage.|$|E
5|$|The {{moderate}} Conservatives were <b>Conservatives</b> <b>in</b> name only, and did {{not support}} the saquarema ideology and leadership. During the years following 1857, successive cabinets quickly collapsed, unable to muster a majority in the Chamber of Deputies, as the two Conservative wings undercut each other in a fight for dominance. The Emperor asked Caxias to head a new cabinet on 2 March 1861. Among his ministers were José Maria da Silva Paranhos (later Viscount of Rio Branco), whom Caxias had met and befriended during the Platine War while serving as secretary to Paraná.|$|E

5000|$|Perhaps {{his most}} famous legacy is from RFC 760, which {{includes}} a robustness principle often called Postel's law: [...] "an implementation should be <b>conservative</b> <b>in</b> its sending behavior, and liberal in its receiving behavior" [...] (reworded in RFC 1122 as [...] "Be liberal in what you accept, and <b>conservative</b> <b>in</b> what you send").|$|R
5|$|The {{position}} that the general strike could be used, but {{only as a last}} resort, became dominant in the party during the mass strike debate. This caused much concern among the <b>conservatives</b> <b>in</b> the party, especially among many trade unionists. At a meeting in February 1906, the trade unionists were placated by party leaders, who said they would attempt to prevent a general strike at all costs. The FVdG reacted by publishing the secret protocols from the meeting in Die Einigkeit, greatly angering the party leadership.|$|E
5|$|World events {{thereafter}} moved {{against the}} Conservatives. Controversial wars in Afghanistan and South Africa undermined his public support. He angered British farmers {{by refusing to}} reinstitute the Corn Laws in response to poor harvests and cheap imported grain. With Gladstone conducting a massive speaking campaign, his Liberals bested Disraeli's Conservatives at the 1880 general election. In his final months, Disraeli led the <b>Conservatives</b> <b>in</b> Opposition. He had throughout his career written novels, beginning in 1826, and he published his last completed novel, Endymion, shortly before he {{died at the age}} of 76.|$|E
5|$|After these slights, {{speculation}} {{was raised}} that Mathias {{would leave the}} Republican Party, especially as the 1980 elections were approaching. Several prominent <b>conservatives</b> <b>in</b> the state, such as U.S. Representatives Marjorie Holt and Robert Bauman, were considering challenging Mathias for his seat. In contrast, the Democratic {{side of the aisle}} had fewer challengers, suggesting Mathias would win renomination more easily if he were to switch parties. However, Mathias chose to remain as a Republican, and teamed up with eight other Republican senators to express their dissatisfaction with the hard-line wing of the party. Mathias later stated that he had never seriously considered switching parties.|$|E

5|$|In addition, Wang Anshi {{had his own}} {{commentaries on}} Confucian {{classics}} made into a standard and required reading for students hoping to pass the state examinations. This and other reforms of Wang's were too much for some officials to bear idly, as there were many administrative disagreements, along with many personal interests at stake. In any case, the rising conservative faction against the reformer Wang Anshi branded him as an inferior-intellect who was not up to par with their principles of governance (likewise, the reformers branded <b>conservatives</b> <b>in</b> the same labeled fashion). The conservatives criticized Wang's reforms {{as a means of}} curbing the influence of landholding families by diminishing their private wealth in favor of self-sufficient communal groups. The conservatives argued that the wealth of the landholding class should not be purposefully diminished by state programs, since the land holding class was the essential socio-economic group that produced China's scholar-officials, managers, merchants, and landlords.|$|E
5|$|In early 1872, Macdonald {{submitted}} the treaty for ratification, and {{it passed the}} Commons with a majority of 66. The general election was held through late August and early September (future Canadian elections would be conducted, {{for the most part}}, on one day). Redistribution had given Ontario increased representation in the House; Macdonald spent much time campaigning in the province, for the most part outside Kingston. Widespread bribery of voters took place throughout Canada, a practice especially effective in the era when votes were publicly declared; in future elections the secret ballot would be used. Macdonald and the Conservatives saw their majority reduced from 35 to 8. The Liberals (as the Grits were coming to be known) did better than the <b>Conservatives</b> <b>in</b> Ontario, forcing the government to rely on the votes of Western and Maritime MPs who did not fully support the party.|$|E
5|$|Macdonald {{was content}} to lead the <b>Conservatives</b> <b>in</b> a relaxed manner in {{opposition}} and await Liberal mistakes. He took long holidays and resumed his law practice, moving his family to Toronto and going into partnership with his son Hugh John. One mistake that Macdonald believed the Liberals had made was a free-trade agreement with Washington, negotiated in 1874; Macdonald {{had come to believe}} that protection was necessary to build Canadian industry. The Panic of 1873 had led to a worldwide depression; the Liberals found it difficult to finance the railroad in such a climate, and were generally opposed to the line anyway—the slow pace of construction led to British Columbia claims that the agreement under which it had entered Confederation was in jeopardy of being broken.|$|E
