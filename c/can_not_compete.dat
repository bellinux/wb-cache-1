The previously mentioned Abdallah became a vasal of Amara Dunqas.|$|E
2500|$|The United States is {{the only}} one of 30 OECD {{countries}} with no border adjustment element in its tax system. Proponents state that because the FairTax would automatically be border adjustable, the 17% competitive advantage, on average, of foreign producers would be eliminated, immediately boosting U.S. competitiveness overseas and at home. Leo Linbeck, chairman of FairTax.org, has stated that U.S. manufacturers and sellers <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>compete</b> successfully with foreign producers because of U.S. tax policy. [...] "The Ways and Means Committee is tasked with writing the taxation laws that raise revenues for the nation but the fact that foreign nations routinely tax U.S. products upon entry and that these nations forgo national taxes on exports to the United States is a Ways and Means blind spot that has all but killed the 'Made in America' label". Under the FairTax, American companies doing business internationally would be able to sell their goods at lower prices but at similar margins, and this would bring jobs to America. In addition, U.S. companies with investments or plants abroad would bring home overseas profits without the penalty of paying income taxes, thus resulting in more U.S. capital investment. This would result in imports and domestic production competing on a level playing field. Exported goods would not be subject to the FairTax, since they would not be consumed in the U.S.; but imported goods sold in the U.S. would be subject to the FairTax because these products would be consumed domestically.|$|E

40|$|Action {{programming}} languages like Golog {{allow to}} define complex behaviors for agents {{on the basis}} of action representations in terms of expressive (first-order) logical formalisms, making them suitable for realistic scenarios of agents with only partial world knowledge. Often these scenarios include sub-tasks that require sequential planning. While in principle it is possible to express and execute such planning sub-tasks directly in Golog, the system <b>can</b> performance-wise <b>not</b> <b>compete</b> with state-of-the-art planners. In this paper, we report on our efforts to integrate efficient planning and expressive action programming in the Platas project. The theoretical foundation is laid by a mapping between the planning language Pddl and the Situation Calculus, which is underlying Golog, together with a study of how these formalisms relate in terms of expressivity. The practical benefit is demonstrated by an evaluation of embedding a Pddl planner into Golog, showing a drastic increase in performance while retaining the full expressiveness of Golog...|$|R

40|$|Most {{commercial}} available {{natural fibre}} composites {{are based on}} random discontinuous fibre composite systems. The development of continuous natural fibre reinforced polymers is essential for manufacturing materials {{that can be used}} in load bearing applications. Similar to traditional composite polymer materials, high-performance natural fibre composite systems should be based on continuous textile reinforcements like unidirectional tapes or woven fabrics. The first problem to be addressed in this process is the optimisation of the yarn to be used in the manufacturing of the textile reinforcement. Subsequently, a number of different fabric types (i. e. biaxial plain weaves, unidirectional fabrics and non-crimp fabrics) were produced and evaluated as reinforcement in composites manufactured by well established manufacturing techniques such as hand lay-up, vacuum infusion, pultrusion and resin transfer moulding (RTM). As expected, the developed materials <b>can</b> <b>not</b> directly <b>compete</b> in terms of strength with unidirectional glass fibre composites. However, they are clearly able to compete with these materials in terms of stiffness, especially if the low density of flax is taken into account. High mechanical properties were obtained for unidirectional flax composite material...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} I use the {{predictive}} {{distribution of the}} back-, now- and forecasts obtained with a mixed-frequency Bayesian VAR (MF-BVAR) to provide a real-time assessment of {{the probability of a}} recession in the euro area for the period from 2003 until 2013. Using a dataset that consists of 135 monthly data vintages and covers 11 soft and hard monthly indicators as well as quarterly real GDP, I show that the MF-BVAR is able to capture current economic conditions extremely well. For both recession periods in the sample, the Great Recession of 2008 / 2009 and the European debt crisis 2011 / 2013, the MF-BVAR real-time recession probabilities soar right {{at the onset of the}} pending slump of GDP growth. By contrast a BVAR estimated on quarterly data detects both recessions with a substantial delay. While typically non-linear discrete-choice or regime switching models have to be used to predict rare events such as recessions, my results indicate that the MF-BVAR <b>can</b> <b>not</b> only <b>compete</b> with other nowcasting approaches in terms of the accuracy of point forecasts, but also reliably detect rare events through the corresponding predictive distribution which is easily available as a by-product of the estimation procedure...|$|R

40|$|Models {{in which}} dark matter {{particles}} {{communicate with the}} visible sector through a pseudoscalar mediator are well-motivated both from a theoretical and from a phenomenological standpoint. With direct detection bounds being typically subleading in such scenarios, the main constraints stem either from collider searches for dark matter, or from indirect detection experiments. However, LHC searches for the mediator particles themselves <b>can</b> <b>not</b> only <b>compete</b> with [...] or even supersede [...] the reach of direct collider dark matter probes, {{but they can also}} test scenarios in which traditional monojet searches become irrelevant, especially when the mediator cannot decay on-shell into dark matter particles or its decay is suppressed. In this work we perform a detailed analysis of a pseudoscalar-mediated dark matter simplified model, taking into account a large set of collider constraints and concentrating on the parameter space regions favoured by cosmological and astrophysical data. We find that mediator masses above 100 - 200 ~GeV are essentially excluded by LHC searches in the case of large couplings to the top quark, while forthcoming collider and astrophysical measurements will further constrain the available parameter space.

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the reasons for}} the middle income trap in Latin America, where countries have been at the middle income level for decades, and draws out lessons for Asia. The middle income trap captures a situation where a middle income country can no longer compete internationally in standardized, labor-intensive goods because wages are relatively too high, but it <b>can</b> also <b>not</b> <b>compete</b> in higher value added activities on a broad enough scale because productivity is relatively too low. The result is slow growth, stagnant or falling wages, and a growing informal economy. Insufficient development of domestic innovation capabilities {{is at the heart of}} the middle income trap. In Latin America, it is the result of a market-led strategy which generated dismal productivity growth, rapid de-industrialization, a decline in export sophistication in many countries, poor innovation performance, and underinvestment in the requisite social capabilities. The current globalization context provides a challenging context for middle income countries to narrow the capabilities gap, because they have less time to do so, with more players competing in the innovation space and technological innovation changing faster. A comprehensive innovation-focused strategy with strategic active policies is the only way to escape the middle income trap. The nature of the production structure, already existing elements of an innovation eco system, and the possibilities for creating political coalitions in support of a systemic advancement of innovation capabilities are critical factors conditioning the escape from the middle income trap...|$|R
