This global standard was renamed the Electronic Postal Certification Mark (EPCM) in 2007 shortly after a new iteration of the technology was developed by Microsoft and Poste Italiane. The key addition to the traditional postmarking technology was integrity of the electronically postmarked item, meaning any kind of falsification and tampering will be easily and definitely detected. Additionally, <b>content</b> <b>confidentiality</b> is guaranteed since document certification is carried out without access or reading by the postal operator. The EPCM will eventually be available through the UPU to all international postal operators in the 191 member countries willing {{to be compliant with}} this standard, thus granting interoperability in certified communications between postal operators. In the United States, the US Postal Service operates a non-global standard called the Electronic Postmark, although it is soon expected to provide services utilizing the EPCM.|$|E

In our scheme, the stream cipher and permutation encryption are combined to encrypt discrete cosine transform (DCT) coefficients for protecting JPEG image <b>content’s</b> <b>confidentiality.</b> And thus, {{it is easy for}} the content owner to achieve the encrypted JPEG images uploaded to a database server. In the image retrieval stage, although the server does not know the plaintext content of a given encrypted query image, he can still extract image feature calculated from the transition probability matrices related to DCT coefficients, which indicate the intra-block, inter-block, and inter-component dependencies among DCT coefficients. And these three types of dependencies are modeled by the Markov process. After that, with the multi-class support vector machine (SVM), the feature of the encrypted query image can be converted into a vector with low dimensionality determined by the number of image categories. The encrypted database images are conducted similarly. After low-dimensional vector representation, the similarity between the encrypted query image and database image may be evaluated by calculating the distance of their corresponding feature vectors. At the client side, the returned encrypted images similar to the query image can be decrypted to the plaintext images {{with the help of the}} encryption key.|$|R

In particular, deterministic encryption schemes produce distinguishable ciphertexts because encrypting equal plaintext values results in equal ciphertexts. If indistinguishable ciphertexts are outsourced, the SP {{is not able to}} differentiate ciphertexts that encrypt value A from those that encrypt value B.

40|$|Abstract—Content-centric {{networking}} (CCN) project, {{a flavor}} of information-centric networking (ICN), decouples data from its source by shifting the emphasis from hosts and interfaces to information. As a result, content becomes directly accessible and routable within the network. In this data-centric paradigm, techniques for maintaining <b>content</b> <b>confidentiality</b> and privacy typically rely on cryptographic techniques {{similar to those}} used in modern digital rights management (DRM) applications, which often require multiple consumer-to-producer (end-to-end) messages to be transmitted to establish identities, acquire licenses, and access encrypted content.

Our design provides strong end-to-end content security and reduces the number of protocol messages required for user authentication and key retrieval.

In order to stimulate this growth in e-commerce, the adoption of new business models will be required. In this thesis, we propose the idea of bringing the multi-level marketing business model into the e-commerce world. For e-commerce applications to take advantage of the business potential in this business model, some challenging security problems need to be resolved. Our proposed protocol provides a method for fair exchange of valuable items between multiple-parties in accordance with the multi-level marketing business model. It also provides the required security services needed to increase the overall customers' trust in e-commerce, and hence increase the rate of committed online transactions. These security services include <b>content</b> assurance, <b>confidentiality,</b> fair exchange and non-repudiation. The above security services are usually attained through the use of cryptography.

Secu-rity and privacy are among top concerns for public cloud environments. Towards the end-to-end <b>content</b> <b>confidentiality</b> protection, we propose CloudSeal, a scheme for securely sharing and distributing data via cloud-based data storage and content delivery services (e. g., Amazon S 3 and CloudFront). CloudSeal ensures the confidentiality of content stored in public cloud storage services, by encrypting it before sharing at the cloud. To achieve flexible access control policies, CloudSeal further adopts k-out-of-n secret sharing and broadcast revocation mechanisms to renew shared secrets, e. g., when a user joins or leaves a content sharing group. Most importantly, CloudSeal leverages proxy re-encryption algorithm to transfer part of stored cipher content in the cloud, which can be de-crypted by a valid user with updated secret keys. We achieve this prop-erty without modifying most of the encrypted content. This feature is critical for the efficiency of content distribution.
