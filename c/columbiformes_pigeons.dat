40|$|We {{describe}} a new {{genus and species}} of <b>pigeon</b> (<b>Columbiformes)</b> from a single coracoid from the St Bathans Fauna of New Zealand (16 – 19 mya). It is the first columbid species described from pre-Pliocene deposits in Australasia. Two apomorphies identify the fossil as belonging to the ptilinopine group of fruit pigeons, among which it is most similar to Hemiphaga, the large fruit pigeon currently endemic to the New Zealand biogeographic area. This reveals that the Hemiphaga lineage has been in New Zealand since the Early Miocene, which supports recent divergence-date estimates for Hemiphaga and its modern sister taxon (Lopholaimus) based on molecular data.

40|$|Trichomonas gallinae, {{the cause}} of avian trichomonosis, is most {{commonly}} found in the order <b>Columbiformes.</b> Racing <b>pigeons</b> are often treated preventively with nitro-imidazoles which {{could result in the}} emergence of resistant isolates, and these isolates can be a treath to wildlife when exchanges occur. The sequence type of 16 T. gallinae isolates obtained from racing pigeons and 15 isolates from wild pigeons was determined based on the ITS 1 / 5. 8 S rRNA/ITS 2 region sequence. In addition, the resistance profiles of these isolates against five different nitro-imidazoles (metronidazole, dimetridazole, ronidazole, tinidazole and carnidazole) were determined. Two different Trichomonas sequence types were isolated. Sequence type A isolates were recovered from racing and wild pigeons, in contrast to sequence type B which was only isolated from wild pigeons. Isolates with sequence type B were all susceptible to the tested nitro-imidazoles, except for tinidazole-resistance in 3 isolates. Resistance to the nitro-imidazoles was observed more frequently in isolates obtained from racing pigeons than from wild pigeons, with most isolates belonging to sequence type A. A higher percentage of the sequence type A isolated from racing pigeons, in comparison with those isolated from the wild pigeons, were resistant to the nitro-imidazoles and displayed higher mean lethal concentration (MLC) values. Two isolates belonging to sequence type A, 1 recovered from a racing pigeon and 1 from a wild pigeon, displayed a similar resistance pattern, suggesting a potential exchange of resistant isolates between racing pigeons and wild pigeons...|$|R

Three species of chewing lice of the suborder Ischnocera and belonging to two genera were found and identified.

40|$|Studies {{of major}} {{switches}} by parasites between highly divergent host lineages {{are important for}} understanding new opportunities for parasite diversification. One such major host switch is inferred for avian feather lice (Ischnocera) in the family Goniodidae, which parasitize two distantly-related groups of birds: Galliformes (pheas-ants, quail, partridges, etc.) and <b>Columbiformes</b> (<b>pigeons</b> and doves). Although {{there have been several}} cophylo-genetic studies of lice at the species level, few studies have focused on such broad evolutionary patterns and major host-switching events. Using a phylogeny based on DNA sequences for goniodid feather lice, we investigated the direction of this major host switch. Unexpectedly, we found that goniodid feather lice have switched host orders, not just once, but twice. A primary host switch occurred from Galliformes to Columbiformes, leading to a large radiation of columbiform body lice. Subsequently, there was also a host switch from Columbiformes back to Galliformes, specifically to megapodes in the Papua–Australasian region. The {{results of the present study}} further reveal that, although morphologically diagnosable lineages are supported by molecular data, many of the existing genera are not monophyletic and a revision of generic limits is needed. © 2011 The Linnean Society of London...|$|E
40|$|Haemoproteus (Haemosporida, Haemoproteidae) is {{the largest}} genus of avian haemosporidian parasites, some species of which cause lethal {{diseases}} in birds. Subgenera Parahaemoproteus and Haemoproteus are usually accepted in this genus; these parasites are transmitted by biting midges (Ceratopogonidae) and hippoboscid flies (Hippoboscidae), respectively. As of yet, species of Parahaemoproteus have not been reported to infect doves and <b>pigeons</b> (<b>Columbiformes),</b> parasites of these birds have not {{been reported to be}} transmitted by biting midges (Ceratopogonidae). Applying microscopy and PCR based methods, we identified mitochondrial cytochrome b (cyt b) sequences of Haemoproteus sacharovi, a widespread parasite of doves and pigeons. Phylogenetic relationships of dove haemoproteids, which traditionally have been classified in the subgenus Haemoproteus, showed that H. sacharovi and H. turtur, common parasites of doves, branch in the clade with Parahaemoproteus species, indicating that these haemoproteids may belong to this subgenus and are likely transmitted by biting midges. This study provides barcodes for H. sacharovi, clarifies the taxonomic positions of H. sacharovi and H. turtur, and indicates directions for development of classification of avian haemoproteid species. Our analysis shows that the current subgeneric classification of avian haemoproteids is generally effective, but the position of some species may need to be revised...|$|R
40|$|Human chlamydiosis is a {{zoonotic}} disease of avian origin caused by Chlamydia psittaci. The highest infection {{rates have been}} detected in parrots (Psittacidae) and <b>pigeons</b> (<b>Columbiformes),</b> the latter most frequently carry the genotypes B and E. These genotypes {{have been shown to}} also infect humans. Because pigeons (Columba livia) cohabit with humans in urban areas, C. psittaci present in the dust from dry feces of infected pigeons may be transmitted by inhalation and represent a significant public health problem. Between 2012 and 2013 a total of 120 fecal samples were collected from pigeons at four public places (Plaza de la Cultura, Parque Morazán, Parque Central de Guadalupe, Plaza de las Garantías Sociales) in San José, Costa Rica. A nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to amplify a region of the outer membrane protein A gene of C. psittaci. Only one sample was positive in PCR and the positive sample was further subjected to sequencing and genotyping. Sequencing identified this sample as C. psittaci genotype B. This study is the first report to show the presence of this organism in pigeons of Costa Rica, and shows that the infected pigeons may represent a significant risk for humans who visit public places that are inhabited by pigeons...|$|R
30|$|Pigeon Paramyxovirus type 1 (PPMV- 1) is an {{antigenic}} {{and host}} variant of classical Newcastle Disease virus (NDV) or Avian Paramyxovirus type 1 (APMV- 1) that causes Newcastle Disease (ND)-like infection and pathology in pigeons (Ujvari et al. 2003). Including {{the earliest known}} PPMV- 1 (Iraq 78) originating from the Middle-East (ME), and the strains responsible for third panzootic in 80  s involving a pigeon-adopted APMV- 1 are considered likely {{to be derived from}} these ME viruses (Kaleta et al. 1985; Ujvari et al. 2003) and as yet continue to circulate around the globe. The virus has an approximate genomic length of 15192  nt and, despite characteristic F protein cleavage site for velogenic strains (112 GRQKRF 117 or 112 RRKKRF 117 or 112 RRQKRF 117), differences in pathogenicity index range from moderate to no virulence for chicken (Collins et al. 1994; Dortmans et al. 2010). However in recent years, some PPMV- 1 have been reported to be highly pathogenic for chicken after passage either in chicken or chicken embryo indicating their potential to cause ND outbreaks (Dortmans et al. 2011). Today, ND caused by either virulent APMV- 1 or PPMV- 1 is considered endemic to feral and domestic <b>pigeon</b> (<b>Columbiformes)</b> worldwide (Aldous et al. 2004). Clinical symptoms differ depending upon host immune titre and virulence of isolate involved (Dortmans et al. 2011). Most of the times, the observed clinical symptoms relate to neurotropic form of ND including tremors, torticollis and disturbed equilibrium, however naturally infected pigeon also exhibit respiratory symptoms such as sneezing, coughing and tracheal rales (Marlier and Vindevogel 2006).|$|R

40|$|A {{large number}} of Sarcocystis spp. infect birds as {{intermediate}} hosts, but pigeons are rarely affected. We identifi ed a novel Sarcocystis sp. that causes lethal neurologic disease in domestic pigeons in Germany. Experimental infections indicated transmission by northern goshawks, and sequence analyses indicated transnational distribution. Worldwide spread is possible. {{large number of}} Sarcocystis spp. (Protozoa: Apicom-A plexa) may infect birds as intermediate hosts, but wild <b>Columbiformes,</b> which include <b>pigeons,</b> are rarely affected (1 – 3). Among the few species affecting domestic poultry are S. horvathi and S. wenzeli, which affect chickens, and S. rileyi, for which ducks are intermediate hosts (4, 5). S. falcatula {{has been known to}} cause clinical disease in pigeons only after experimental infection; whether this species is pathogenic under natural conditions is not known (6). We recently reported an emerging neurologic disease with lethal outcome for domestic pigeons (Columba livia f. domestica) in Berlin, Germany, caused by a novel Sarcocystis sp. (3). When compared with S. falcatula and other bird-infecting Sarcocystis spp. such as S. lindsayi, the novel species differed in its ultrastructural and genetic features (3, 6, 7). Clinical signs in naturally infected pigeons, which were similar to those caused by Paramyxovirus- 1 or Salmonella typhimurium var. cop. infection, were depression, polyuria, torticollis, opisthotonus, paralysis, trembling, and death. Pigeons had numerous parasitic cysts in their muscles. We hypothesized that pigeons serve as intermediate hosts in a 2 -host life cycle characteristic for Sarcocystis spp., in which pigeons are infected by ingestion of sporocysts shed in feces from an unidentified definitive host (8). We further characterized the parasite genetically, identified its definitive host and life cycle, and determined its causative role in this novel disease of pigeons...|$|R
40|$|Artículo de publicación ISIZebrin II (ZII) is a glycolytic enzyme {{expressed}} in cerebellar Purkinje cells. In both mammals and birds, ZII is expressed heterogeneously, such {{that there are}} sagittal stripes of Purkinje cells with a high ZII expression (ZII+) alternating with stripes of Purkinje cells {{with little or no}} expression (ZII). To date, ZII expression studies are limited to neognathous birds: <b>pigeons</b> (<b>Columbiformes),</b> chickens (Galliformes), and humming-birds (Trochilidae). These previous studies divided the avian cerebellum into 5 transverse regions based on the pattern of ZII expression. In the lingular region (lobule I) all Purkinje cells are ZII+. In the anterior region (lobules II V) there are 4 pairs of ZII+/- stripes. In the central region (lobules VI-VIII) all Purkinje cells are ZII+. In the posterior region (lobules VIII-IX) there are 5 - 7 pairs of ZII+/- stripes. Finally, in the nodular region (lobule X) all Purkinje cells are ZII+. As the pattern of ZII stripes is quite similar in these disparate species, it appears that it is highly conserved. However, it has yet to be studied in paleognathous birds, which split from the neognaths over 100 million years ago. To better understand the evolution of cerebellar compartmentation in birds, we examined ZII immunoreactivity in a paleognath, the Chilean tinannou (Nothoprocta perdicaria). In the tinamou, Purkinje cells expressed ZII heterogeneously such that there were sagittal ZII+ and ZII stripes of Purkinje cells, and this pattern of expression was largely similar to that observed in neognathous birds. For example, all Purkinje cells in the lingular (lobule I) and nodular (lobule X) regions were ZII+, and there were 4 pairs of ZII+/- stripes in the anterior region (lobules II V). In contrast to neognaths, however, ZII was {{expressed in}} lobules VI-VII as a series of sagittal stripes in the tinamou. Also unlike in neognaths, stripes were absent in lobule IXab, and all Purkinje cells expressed ZII in the tinannou. The differences in Zllexpression between the tinannou and neognaths could reflect behavior, but the general similarity of the expression patterns across all bird species suggests that ZII stripes evolved early in the avian phylogenetic tree.

40|$|Two main themes to the avian {{research}} {{presented in}} this thesis are, 1. Deep resolution of birds generally, and 2. Investigation of specific aspects of the New Zealand avifauna. More specifically, this thesis covers phylogeny, and predictions about palaeognaths, pigeons, pelecaniforms and passerines. Significant progress is made in resolving the basal branches of Neoaves. This thesis examines whether the six-way basal Neoavian split of Cracraft (2001) is, in principle, resolvable. New mitochondrial genomes are added to improve taxon sampling, break up long branches, and allow testing of the prior assumptions of six Neoavian groups. This research shows the six-way split is resolvable, although more work is required for specific details. From a life-history perspective, {{it is interesting that}} the two bird-of-prey groups (falcons and buzzards) are very divergent, and may not be sister groups. Molecular dating supports major diversification of at least 12 Neoavian lineages in the Late Cretaceous. Additionally, novel avian mitochondrial gene orders are investigated and a hypothesis put forward suggesting gene conversion and stable intermediate forms allows an apparently rare event (gene rearrangement) to occur multiple times within Neoaves. One of Cracraft’s six groups, informally called the ‘Conglomerati’, is particularly difficult to resolve. The <b>pigeons</b> (<b>Columbiformes)</b> lie within the ‘Conglomerati’, and this chapter examines two aspects along the continuum of pigeon evolution. Firstly the large South Pacific fruit pigeon radiation is examined with mid-length mitochondrial sequences. This clade contains a third of all pigeon species, and has been very successful in island colonisation throughout South East Asia and the Pacific. Secondly, candidates for the closest relative of pigeons are tested using analysis of whole mitochondrial genomes. Highest support was found for the grouping of sandgrouse and pigeon, although they are clearly very divergent. Also within the ‘Conglomerati’ is the traditional order Pelecaniformes, and their close allies the Ciconiiformes. These orders (the P&C) are part of an adaptive radiation of seabird water-carnivores, including loons, penguins, petrels and albatrosses. This group is separate from the large shorebird water-carnivore group; although both appear to have begun radiating abut 70 million years ago. The tropicbird represents a separate, convergent life history and {{is not part of the}} Pelecaniformes, nor within the larger seabird water-carnivore group. Resolution of the basal phylogeny of oscine passerines is important for interpreting the radiation of this group out of the Australasian region. Many endemic New Zealand oscine passerines belong to ‘basal corvid’ lineages, but have not previously been investigated with mitochondrial DNA. This chapter shows that many ‘basal corvid’ lineages are actually ‘basal passerine’ lineages, and there is a discrepancy between nuclear Rag- 1 phylogenies (the most commonly used gene in passerine phylogenetics) and other phylogenies, including mitochondrial, that requires further investigation. Taken as a whole, this thesis adds significantly to our understanding of the evolution of birds, and provides a foundation for future research, not only of phylogenetic relationships, but also of avian life history, long-term niche stability and macroevolution...|$|R
