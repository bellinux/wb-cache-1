It is necessary to find lead compounds for developing novel, powerful, and environmentally-friendly acaricides as an alternative approach to controlling the <b>carmine</b> <b>spider</b> <b>mite</b> because of the serious resistance and residual agrochemicals in the environment. In addition, the study on the acaricidal activities of marine bioactive substances is comparatively deficient. In the present study, the acaricidal activity of venom (NnFV) from the jellyfish Nemopilema nomurai against the <b>carmine</b> <b>spider</b> <b>mite</b> T. cinnabarinus was determined for the first time. The venom had contact toxicity, and the 24 -h LC 50 -value was 29. 1 μg/mL. The mite body wall was affected by the venom, with the mite body having no luster and being seriously shrunken after 24 h. T. cinnabarinus was a potential target pest of NnFV, which had potential {{as a type of}} natural bioacaricide.

40|$|Perceived {{benefits}} of insecticidal transgenic crops include reduced usage of broad-based insecticides, and therefore lower risk to non-target organisms. Numerous studies have documented low or no direct toxicity of Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) -derived toxins against non-target organisms, {{but there has}} been less research on (a) effects of secondary pest infestations on Bt expressing in crops and (b) behavioural responses by predators feeding on host arthropods from Bt crops - both topics are investigated in this study. We quantified predation by the obligate <b>spider</b> <b>mite</b> predator Phytoseiulus persimilis of <b>carmine</b> <b>spider</b> <b>mites</b> (Tetranychus cinnabarinus), reared on Bt or non-Bt corn (Zea mays).

When <b>spider</b> <b>mites</b> infested plants prior to predator release, predatory mites were not capable of controlling <b>spider</b> <b>mite</b> populations in the absence of other pest species. A laboratory experiment showed that predators were hindered by the webbing of <b>spider</b> <b>mites.</b> In a greenhouse experiment, <b>spider</b> <b>mite</b> leaf damage was lower in the presence of thrips and predators than in the presence of whiteflies and predators, but damage was lowest in the presence of thrips, whiteflies and predators. Whitefly control was also improved in the presence of thrips. The lower levels of <b>spider</b> <b>mite</b> leaf damage probably resulted from (1) a strong numerical response of the predator (up to 50 times higher densities) when a second and third pest species were present in addition to <b>spider</b> <b>mites,</b> and (2) from A. swirskii attacking mobile <b>spider</b> <b>mite</b> stages outside or near the edges of the <b>spider</b> <b>mite</b> webbing.

40|$|The <b>carmine</b> <b>spider</b> <b>mite</b> (Tetranychus cinnabarinus) {{is one of}} {{the most}} serious pests on crops and its control mainly depends on {{chemical}} acaricides. The excessive and improper acaricides use has resulted in mite resistance to many acaricides, including fenpropathrin. Previous studies have indicated fenpropathrin resistance is a complex development process involving many genes, but information on resistance mechanism of post-transcription regulation is rare. Using Illumina sequencing, several categories of sRNAs were identified from susceptible (TS) and fenpropathrin-resistant strains (TR) of T. cinnabarinus, including 75 known microRNAs (miRNAs) and 64 novel miRNAs, whose target genes containing 78592 miRNA-target pairs were predicted by 6 algorithms. Also, 12 significantly differently expressed miRNAs were identified between the TS and TR libraries and RT-qPCR validation also performed a well consistency with sequencing. The targets of significantly differentially expressed miRNAs included 7 glutathione S-transferase, 7 cytochrome P 450 and 16 carboxyl/choline esterase genes, their function in fenpropathrin resistance were further analyzed. The present study provides the firstly large-scale characterization of miRNAs in T. cinnabarinus and the comparison between TS and TR strains gives a clue on how miRNA involves in fenpropathrin resistance...|$|E

To gain valuable gene information and molecular basis for the future insecticide resistance study of CSM, the first transcriptome analysis of CSM was conducted. A total of 45, 016 contigs and 25, 519 unigenes were generated from the de novo transcriptome assembly, and 15, 167 unigenes were annotated via BLAST querying against current databases, including nr, SwissProt, the Clusters of Orthologous Groups (COGs), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) and Gene Ontology (GO). Aligning the transcript to Tetranychus urticae genome, the 19255 (75. 45 %) of the transcripts had significant (e-value < 10 - 5) matches to T. urticae DNA genome, 19111 sequences matched to T. urticae proteome with an average protein length coverage of 42. 55 %. Core Eukaryotic Genes Mapping Approach (CEGMA) analysis identified 435 core eukaryotic genes (CEGs) in the CSM dataset corresponding to 95 % coverage. Ten gene categories that relate to insecticide resistance in arthropod were generated from CSM transcriptome, including 53 P 450 -, 22 GSTs-, 23 CarEs-, 1 AChE-, 7 GluCls-, 9 nAChRs-, 8 GABA receptor-, 1 sodium channel-, 6 ATPase- and 12 Cyt b genes.

40|$|The <b>carmine</b> <b>spider</b> <b>mite,</b> Tetranychus cinnabarinus (Boisduval), is an {{economically}} important agricultural pest {{that is difficult}} to prevent and control. Scopoletin is a botanical coumarin derivative that targets Ca 2 +-ATPase to exert a strong acaricidal effect on carmine spider mites. In this study, the full-length cDNA sequence of a plasma membrane Ca 2 +-ATPase 1 gene (TcPMCA 1) was cloned. The sequence contains an open reading frame of 3750 bp and encodes a putative protein of 1249 amino acids. The effects of scopoletin on TcPMCA 1 expression were investigated. TcPMCA 1 was significantly upregulated after it was exposed to 10 %, 30 %, and 50 % of the lethal concentration of scopoletin. Homology modeling, molecular docking, and three-dimensional quantitative structure-activity relationships were then studied to explore the relationship between scopoletin structure and TcPMCA 1 -inhibiting activity of scopoletin and other 30 coumarin derivatives. Results showed that scopoletin inserts into the binding cavity and interacts with amino acid residues at the binding site of the TcPMCA 1 protein through the driving forces of hydrogen bonds. Furthermore, CoMFA (comparative molecular ﬁeld analysis) - and CoMSIA (comparative molecular similarity index analysis) -derived models showed that the steric and H-bond fields of these compounds exert important influences on the activities of the coumarin compounds. Notably, the C 3, C 6, and C 7 positions in the skeletal structure of the coumarins are the most suitable active sites. This work provides insights into the mechanism underlying the interaction of scopoletin with TcPMCA 1.

In this study, the herbivorous mite, Tetranychus urticae, and its predator, Phytoseiulus persimilis, were given a choice between Lima bean plants induced by JA or <b>spider</b> <b>mites</b> and uninduced control plants. Infestation densities resulting in the induction of predator attractants were much lower than thus far assumed, i. e., predatory mites were significantly attracted to plants that were infested for 2 days with only one or four <b>spider</b> <b>mites</b> per plant. Phytoseiulus persimilis showed a density-dependent response to volatiles from plants that were infested with different numbers of <b>spider</b> <b>mites.</b> Similarly, treating plants with increasing concentrations of JA also led to increased attraction of P. persimilis. Moreover, the duration of <b>spider</b> <b>mite</b> infestation {{was positively correlated with}} the proportion of predators that were attracted to mite-infested plants. A pretreatment of the plants with JA followed by a <b>spider</b> <b>mite</b> infestation enhanced the attraction of P. persimilis to plant volatiles compared to attraction to volatiles from plants that were only infested with <b>spider</b> <b>mites</b> and did not receive a pretreatment with JA. The herbivore, T. urticae preferred leaf tissue that previously had been infested with conspecifics to uninfested leaf tissue. In the case of choice tests with JA-induced and control leaf tissue, <b>spider</b> <b>mites</b> slightly preferred control leaf tissue. When <b>spider</b> <b>mites</b> were given a choice between leaf discs induced by JA and leaf discs damaged by <b>spider</b> <b>mite</b> feeding, they preferred the latter. The presence of herbivore induced chemicals and/or <b>spider</b> <b>mite</b> products enhanced settlement of the mites, whereas treatment with JA seemed to impede settlement...|$|R

40|$|Red <b>spider</b> <b>mite</b> Tetranychus sp. {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} pests attacking leaves of Jatropha curcas. The objective of this study was to elucidate life history parameters and abundance of <b>spider</b> <b>mite</b> on two J. curcas cultivars. Field studies were carried out in BALITTRI Pakuwon Sukabumi, and laboratory experiments were conducted at the Department of Plant Protection, Bogor Agricultural University, from June to November 2008. Cultivars significantly affected several life history parameters of the <b>spider</b> <b>mite.</b> Spider mite reared on IP 1 -P cultivar have longer oviposition period and higher fecundity than those on IP 2 -P (7. 00 days and 25. 56 eggs against 5. 00 days and 10. 00 eggs). The sex ratio of <b>spider</b> <b>mite</b> was 3. 2 : 1 on IP 1 -P and 2. 5 : 1 on IP 2 -P. Intrinsic rate of increase was also higher on IP 1 -P. However, field studies indicated that the <b>spider</b> <b>mite</b> were less abundant on this cultivar. These might be due to the presence of other arthropods which were higher on IP 1 -P. In general, the highest population of <b>spider</b> <b>mite</b> occurred in August and the lowest in October–November. Predatory mite Family Phytoseiidae was found associated with <b>spider</b> <b>mite,</b> however its role as natural control agent was not significant...|$|R

40|$|Predation {{is a prime}} {{selective}} force shaping prey behavior. Investment in anti-predator {{behavior is}} traded-off against time and energy for other fitness-enhancing activities such as foraging or reproduction. To optimize this benefit/cost trade-off, prey {{should be able to}} innately and/or by experience modulate their behavior to the level of predation risk. Here, we assessed learned predation risk management in the herbivorous two-spotted <b>spider</b> <b>mite</b> Tetranychus urticae. We exposed <b>spider</b> <b>mites</b> coming from benign (naïve) or high immediate predation risk (experienced) environments to latent and/or no risk and assessed their site choice, activity and oviposition. Benign environments were characterized by the absence of any predator cues, high immediate risk environments by killed <b>spider</b> <b>mites,</b> physical presence of the predatory mite Phytoseiulus persimilis and associated chemosensory traces left on the surface, and latent risk environments by only predator traces. In the no-choice experiment both naïve and experienced <b>spider</b> <b>mites</b> laid their first egg later on leaves with than without predator traces. Irrespective of predator traces presence/absence, experienced mites laid their first egg earlier than naïve ones did. Naïve <b>spider</b> <b>mites</b> were more active, indicating higher restlessness, and laid fewer eggs on leaves with predator traces, whereas experienced mites were less active and laid similar numbers of eggs on leaves with and without predator traces. In the choice experiment both naïve and experienced <b>spider</b> <b>mites</b> preferentially resided and oviposited on leaves without predator traces but experienced mites were less active than naïve ones. Overall, our study suggests that <b>spider</b> <b>mites</b> experienced with high predation risk behave bolder under latent risk than naïve <b>spider</b> <b>mites.</b> Since predator traces alone do not indicate immediate risk, we argue that the attenuated anti-predator response of experienced <b>spider</b> <b>mites</b> represents adaptive learned risk management...|$|R
