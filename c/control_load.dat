There are so many power electronics <b>controlled</b> <b>loads</b> that are connected in the distribution power system. Due to intensive use of power electronics <b>controlled</b> <b>loads</b> in an industry and other consumers in general, the harmonics produces a distortion in distribution network. Therefore, to protect the power system from the power electronics <b>controlled</b> <b>loads,</b> {{it is very important}} to identify the types and number of all the working power electronics <b>controlled</b> <b>loads.</b> The result of this paper shows that the method of calculating the number and also the types of all working power electronics <b>controlled</b> <b>loads</b> in any distribution system. A Multiple Signal Classification (MUSIC) Spectrum technique is used to identify the power electronics <b>controlled</b> <b>loads</b> in distribution power system.

During these periods measurements of electrical power, buoy motion and mooring line forces have been carried out and analyzed to enhance the knowledge about direct driven linear generator WEC dynamics. In the first test period all electrical power was converted to heat over a three phase delta-connected resistive load. To investigate the impact of a non-linear load on the WEC system, the generator was, during the second test period, connected to a non-linear load consisting of a diode rectifier, capacitors and resistors. The <b>control,</b> <b>load</b> and measurement system for the WEC have successively been expanded and now there is a remotely operated measurement system and control system.|$|E

In [11], a {{hierarchical}} framework was developed for an integrated community energy system, with both operating cost minimization and tie-line power smoothing considered as objectives, and thermostatically <b>controlled</b> <b>load</b> was used to smooth the tie-line power according to its demand response potential. An integrated optimal power flow method was developed to obtain the optimal set-points of different components.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to assess a new method of <b>controlling</b> <b>load</b> in Intelligent Networks (INs).

40|$|In {{this thesis}} I {{established}} {{the role of}} Visual Short-Term Memory (VSTM) load in visual detection while comparing to the roles of perceptual load and Working Memory (WM) cognitive <b>control</b> <b>load.</b> Participants performed a short-term memory task combined with a visual detection task (as well as attention task, Chapter 2) during the memory delay. The level and type of load was varied (perceptual load, VSTM load or WM cognitive <b>control</b> <b>load).</b> Measures of detection sensitivity demonstrated that increased VSTM load and perceptual load have both resulted in impaired detection sensitivity that was of equivalent magnitude. In contrast, increased WM cognitive <b>control</b> <b>load</b> had either no effect on detection or under some conditions (when the detection task was combined with an attention task of higher priority) resulted in enhanced detection sensitivity, the opposite effect to VSTM load. The contrasting effects {{of different types of}} memory load rule out alternative accounts in terms of general task difficulty. Other interpretations in terms of changes in attention deployment, response bias, task priorities, verbal strategies, were also ruled out. These VSTM load effects lasted over delays of 4 seconds, were generalized to foveal, parafoveal and peripheral stimuli, and were shown to be predicted from estimates of the effects of load on VSTM capacity. fMRI results (Chapter 4) showed that high VSTM load reduces retinotopic V 1 responses to the detection stimulus and psychophysics experiments (Chapter 5) showed that high VSTM load resulted in reduced effective contrast of the detection stimulus. These results in this thesis clarify the distinct roles of WM maintenance processes from those of WM cognitive control process in visual detection. These findings provide further support to the sensory recruitment hypothesis of VSTM, clarify previous discrepancies in WM research and extend load theory to account for the effects of VSTM load on visual detection...|$|E

40|$|Previous {{studies have}} {{reported}} abnormal prefrontal and cingulate activity during attentional control processing in schizophrenia. However, {{it is not clear}} how variation in attentional <b>control</b> <b>load</b> modulates activity within these brain regions in this brain disorder. The aim of this study in schizophrenia is to investigate the impact of increasing levels of attentional control processing on prefrontal and cingulate activity. Blood oxygen level [...] dependent (BOLD) responses of 16 outpatients with schizophrenia were compared with those of 21 healthy subjects while performing a task eliciting increasing levels of attentional control during event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging at 3 T. Results showed reduced behavioral performance in patients at greater attentional control levels. Imaging data indicated greater prefrontal activity at intermediate attentional control levels in patients but greater prefrontal and cingulate responses at high attentional control demands in controls. The BOLD activity profile of these regions in controls increased linearly with increasing cognitive loads, whereas in patients, it was nonlinear. Correlation analysis consistently showed differential region and load-specific relationships between brain activity and behavior in the 2 groups. These results indicate that varying attentional <b>control</b> <b>load</b> is associated in schizophrenia with load- and region-specific modification of the relationship between behavior and brain activity, possibly suggesting earlier saturation of cognitive capacity...|$|E
