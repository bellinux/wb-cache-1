By so doing, we build a theoretical model explaining how <b>connection</b> <b>modes</b> between leading agribusiness enterprises and rural households affect the firm-level agricultural products export. Analyzing the dataset of 561 national leading agribusinesses of the year 2003, we use Tobit model to estimate the firm-level export effect of the <b>connection</b> <b>modes.</b> The empirical result demonstrates that <b>connections</b> in the <b>mode</b> of stock-cooperation or cooperation contracts have a significant {{positive effect on the}} enterprises export and export ratio. In addition, the connection with more characteristics of factor contract has stronger effect on export than that with commodity contract characteristics. ...|$|R

This paper focuses on a unique topology of DFIG called IG <b>connection</b> <b>mode</b> to help the DFIG ride through grid faults smoothly. Transient analysis of IG <b>connection</b> <b>mode</b> is carried out to derive the generator currents. With this analysis, the control strategy for IG <b>connection</b> <b>mode</b> DFIG was developed. From the simulation results, it is clearly visible that IG mode could work in both normal and low grid voltage conditions. Simulation results clearly show that the DFIG with the proposed mode switching control could smoothly ride through low voltage grid faults while satisfying grid code requirements...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} present {{reliable}} mode {{and structure of}} connection between pole and base for breakaway sign, mode evaluation and structure design were conducted in this paper. AHP was adopted to evaluate connection modes between sign pole and base. Analytic hierarchy with double criterion layer and corresponding judgment matrix were established. Through qualitative analysis, powers of indexes were given and evaluation results were presented based on standardization process of each evaluation index. It shows that brittle <b>connection</b> <b>mode</b> comes in the first place, the plastic <b>connection</b> <b>mode</b> comes second, and rigid <b>connection</b> <b>mode</b> comes last. Two brittle connection structures were designed through the finite element simulation analysis. By ANSYS software, stress data were given for recessed and hole-type connection design structure. It can be found that maximum tensile stress data of two connection structures are all more than ultimate tensile strength of steel. Thus {{it can be concluded}} that two connection structures designed in this paper can be breakaway in collision and protect the safety of vehicle occupants...|$|E

While newer UEs support both <b>connection</b> <b>modes,</b> legacy UEs only support the single connectivity mode.|$|R

We derive a general transfer matrix formalism for parallel coupled quantum scatterers, and apply that theory to demonstrate that the spectral singularities and PT-symmetric transitions of single scattering cells may be observed in coupled systems, at the same or distinct values of the critical parameters, depending on the <b>connection</b> <b>modes</b> under which the scattering objects are coupled. We analyse the influences of the connection configuration on the related transport properties such as spectral singularities and anisotropic transmission resonances...|$|R
50|$|The {{transport}} layer transfers data between source and destination processes. Generally, two <b>connection</b> <b>modes</b> are recognized, connection-oriented or connectionless. Connection-oriented service establishes a dedicated virtual circuit and offers various grades of guaranteed delivery, ensuring that data received {{is identical to}} data transmitted. Connectionless mode provides only best-effort service without the built-in ability to correct errors, which includes complete loss of data without notifying the data source of the failure. No logical connection, and no persistent state of the transaction exists between the endpoints, lending the connectionless mode low overhead and potentially better real-time performance for timing-critical applications such as voice and video transmissions.|$|R

A DSPMBL motor is designed. By using finite element analysis, the field distributions of the DSPMBL motor are obtained. The static characteristics of the proposed motor are also deduced.
