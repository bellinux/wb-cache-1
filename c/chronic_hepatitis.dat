5|$|The {{infectious}} disease hepatitis C {{is caused by}} the hepatitis C virus (HCV), which affects the liver and is transmitted by blood-to-blood contact, or by exposure to another person's infected blood. The infection is often asymptomatic, but chronic infection can cause inflammation of the liver (<b>chronic</b> <b>hepatitis).</b> This condition can progress to scarring of the liver (fibrosis), and advanced scarring (cirrhosis). In some cases, those with cirrhosis go on to develop liver failure or liver cancer.|$|E

40|$|AIMS [...] To {{evaluate}} {{the role of}} hepatocyte expression of leucocyte adhesion molecules and major histocompatibility complex (MHC) antigens in the pathogenesis of <b>chronic</b> viral <b>hepatitis.</b> METHODS [...] The expression of intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM- 1), lymphocyte function associated antigen 3 (LFA- 3), and MHC class I and II antigens on hepatocyte membrane {{in relation to the}} histological and biochemical activities was studied in patients with <b>chronic</b> B <b>hepatitis,</b> <b>chronic</b> persistent <b>hepatitis</b> (CPH) n = 23; <b>chronic</b> active <b>hepatitis</b> (CAH) n = 20; <b>chronic</b> D <b>hepatitis</b> (CAH) n = 6; and <b>chronic</b> non-A, non-B <b>hepatitis</b> (CPH n = 4, CAM n = 6). Six of the latter were hepatitis C virus antibody positive. RESULTS [...] In <b>chronic</b> B <b>hepatitis</b> ICAM- 1 and MHC-I were expressed significantly more in patients with CAH than in those with CPH (p 0. 05) and MHC-II (p > 0. 05). CONCLUSIONS [...] In <b>chronic</b> viral <b>hepatitis</b> hepatocyte expression of ICAM- 1 and MHC-I might be important for immunosurveillance against virally infected hepatocytes, while the expression of LFA- 3 and MHC-II {{does not seem to have}} a role in the pathogenesis of <b>chronic</b> viral <b>hepatitis...</b>|$|R
40|$|There is {{a strong}} {{association}} between porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT) and <b>chronic</b> viral <b>hepatitis</b> C. Therapy for <b>chronic</b> viral <b>hepatitis</b> C may improve PCT.

40|$|IN THIS SUDY, USING THE LEUKOCYTE MIGRATION INHIBITION TEST, WE MEASURED THE SENSITIZATION TO A LIVER - SPECIFIC LIPOPROTEIN (LSP) IN 15 NORMAL SUBJECTS, 10 PATIENTS WITH HBSAG - NEGATIVE <b>CHRONIC</b> ACTIVE <b>HEPATITIS</b> 15, WITH HBSAG - POSITIVE <b>CHRONIC</b> ACTIVE <b>HEPATITIS</b> AND 10 WITH LIVER DISEASE OF NON AUTOIMMUNE TYPE.

40|$|The {{characterisation}} of lymphocytes from liver biopsies {{indicates that}} 'activated' T lymphocytes {{are present in}} the liver in alcohol induced <b>hepatitis,</b> <b>chronic</b> active <b>hepatitis</b> (HBS+ve and -ve), and in primary biliary cirrhosis but not in inactive cirrhosis, <b>chronic</b> persistent <b>hepatitis,</b> extrahepatic and drug induced cholestasis. A greater percentage of lymphocytes bear Fc-receptors in <b>chronic</b> active <b>hepatitis</b> than in alcohol induced hepatitis or cholestatic liver disease. The concentration of 'activated' T cells in the peripheral blood in all groups studied was within the normal range, suggesting that the 'activated' T cells found in the liver were reacting to either native or foreign antigens within the liver.

40|$|The {{research}} of pathomorphological features of liver fibrosis {{in patients with}} <b>chronic</b> viral <b>hepatitis</b> C associated with hepatic steatosis has shown that as opposed to cases of perisinusoidal-central-lobular and portal-septal fibrosis, typical for <b>chronic</b> viral <b>hepatitis</b> C without steatosis, in patients with <b>chronic</b> viral <b>hepatitis</b> C with steatosis in areas of maximal hepatocyte steatosis and steatic cysts firstly focal pericellular-lobular fibrosis develops which then progresses into pericellular intralobular severe liver fibrosis. ...|$|R
25|$|The {{hepatitis}} D virus {{requires that}} a person first be infected with hepatitis B virus, so prevention efforts should focus on limiting the spread of hepatitis B. In people who have <b>chronic</b> <b>hepatitis</b> B infection and {{are at risk for}} superinfection with the hepatitis D virus, the preventive strategies are the same as for hepatitis B.|$|E
25|$|The {{significance}} of these risk factors varies globally. In regions where hepatitis B infection is endemic, such as southeast China, this is the predominant cause. In populations largely protected by hepatitis B vaccination, such as the United States, HCC is most often linked to causes of cirrhosis such as <b>chronic</b> <b>hepatitis</b> C, obesity, and alcohol abuse.|$|E
25|$|Hepatitis has a broad {{spectrum}} of presentations that range from a complete lack of symptoms to severeliver failure. The acute form of hepatitis, generally caused by viral infection, is characterized byconstitutional symptomsthat are typically self-limiting. <b>Chronic</b> <b>hepatitis</b> presents similarly, but can manifest signs and symptoms specific to liver dysfunction with long-standing inflammation and damage to the organ.|$|E
40|$|One {{hundred and}} five {{hepatitis}} B surface antigen (HBsAg) positive patients presenting with <b>chronic</b> persistent <b>hepatitis</b> (n = 46) or <b>chronic</b> active <b>hepatitis</b> without cirrhosis (n = 59) were followed longitudinally {{for one to}} 16 years (mean 5. 5 years) and underwent follow up biopsy. During a mean histological follow up of 3. 7 years, active cirrhosis developed in 21 (20 %) patients one to 13 years after entry to the study with a calculated annual incidence of 5. 9 %. The probability of evolution to cirrhosis was significantly higher in patients with <b>chronic</b> active <b>hepatitis</b> and bridging hepatic necrosis than in those with moderate <b>chronic</b> active <b>hepatitis</b> or <b>chronic</b> persistent <b>hepatitis</b> (p less than 0. 0001). Cox multiple regression analysis showed that the following three variables independently implied poor prognosis: older age, presence of bridging hepatic necrosis, and persistence of hepatitis B virus DNA in serum (p less than 0. 0001). These findings indicate that patients with severe <b>chronic</b> active <b>hepatitis</b> and persistent hepatitis B virus replication are at very high risk of rapid progression to cirrhosis...|$|R
40|$|Thirty-four healthy blood donors, {{found to}} be {{persistent}} HBAg carriers, have been investigated by means of serial liver function tests, bromsulphthalein (BSP) retention, and liver biopsy. Thirty-one of the donors had histological abnormalities including one with cirrhosis, three with <b>chronic</b> aggressive <b>hepatitis,</b> and 11 with <b>chronic</b> persistent <b>hepatitis.</b> In 13 biopsies there were focal areas of necrosis in the liver parenchyma. Serial liver function tests revealed abnormalities {{in each of the}} donors with cirrhosis or with <b>chronic</b> aggressive <b>hepatitis,</b> in seven of the 11 donors with <b>chronic</b> persistent <b>hepatitis,</b> and in seven of the 13 with focal parenchymal necrosis.

40|$|Rabbits given weekly {{injections}} of two human liver-specific proteins, one a cell membrane antigen known as LSP, {{the other a}} cytoplasmic protein known as LP 2, in combination with complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) developed <b>chronic</b> active <b>hepatitis.</b> Although this lesion persisted for at least 1 year in some animals, cirrhosis did not supervene. <b>Chronic</b> active <b>hepatitis</b> was also produced by injection of the membrane protein LSP in CFA, without LP 2. Unexpectedly, injection of a human skeletal muscle extract in CFA also caused <b>chronic</b> active <b>hepatitis.</b> It is possible therefore that sensitization to antigens other than liver-specific proteins may {{play a part in}} the pathogenesis of <b>chronic</b> active <b>hepatitis...</b>|$|R
25|$|Parasites {{can also}} infect {{the liver and}} {{activate}} the immune response, resulting in symptoms of acute hepatitis with increased serum IgE (though <b>chronic</b> <b>hepatitis</b> is possible with chronic infections). Of the protozoans, Trypanosoma cruzi, Leishmania species, and the malaria-causing Plasmodium species all can cause liver inflammation. Another protozoan, Entamoeba histolytica, causes hepatitis with distinct liver abscesses.|$|E
25|$|In these rare, {{more severe}} acute cases, {{patients}} {{have been successfully}} treated with antiviral therapy {{similar to that used}} in cases of <b>chronic</b> <b>hepatitis</b> B, with nucleoside analogues such as entecavir or tenofovir.

40|$|Severe <b>chronic</b> active <b>hepatitis,</b> {{defined as}} the {{presence}} of a fivefold increase in serum aminotransferases and a twofold rise in gamma globulin for at least 10 weeks, is considered a progressive immunological liver disease requiring corticosteroid treatment, particularly when serum autoantibodies and a severe lymphoplasmacellular periportal infiltrate are found in the liver biopsy specimen. A 38 year old man who fulfilled the criteria for severe <b>chronic</b> active <b>hepatitis</b> is described. His sex, his homosexuality, and the presence of antibodies against HIV, however, led to the suspicion of a coinfection with hepatitis C virus (HCV) rather than autoimmune disease. The rapid and complete response to alpha interferon treatment and a recently available positive antibody test for HCV supported this view.

25|$|In {{some parts}} of the world, such as sub-Saharan Africa and Southeast Asia, HCC is the most common cancer, {{generally}} affecting men more than women, and with an age of onset between late teens and 30s. This variability is in part due to the different patterns of hepatitis B and hepatitis C transmission in different populations - infection at or around birth predispose to earlier cancers than if people are infected later. The time between hepatitis B infection and development into HCC can be years, even decades, but from diagnosis of HCC to death the average survival period is only 5.9 months according to one Chinese study during the 1970-80s, or 3 months (median survival time) in Sub-Saharan Africa according to Manson's textbook of tropical diseases. HCC is one of the deadliest cancers in China where <b>chronic</b> <b>hepatitis</b> B is found in 90% of cases. In Japan, <b>chronic</b> <b>hepatitis</b> C is associated with 90% of HCC cases. Food infected with Aspergillus flavus (especially peanuts and corns stored during prolonged wet seasons) which produces aflatoxin poses another risk factor for HCC.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} stages (as with NAFLD and early NASH), most {{patients}} are asymptomatic or have mild right upper quadrant pain, and diagnosis is suspected {{on the basis of}} abnormal liver function tests.
