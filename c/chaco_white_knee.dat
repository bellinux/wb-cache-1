She has blond hair that goes over her shoulders and wears her school uniform with <b>white</b> <b>knee</b> socks. She too is level-headed and assumes the straight-man role, often moderating interactions between Yoshiko and others. She is very sensitive, especially when others point out her small chest, and sometimes loses her patience.|$|R
50|$|P. D. Ross {{was named}} team president, and Frank Jenkins, again the captain. The Club became {{affiliated}} with the new Ottawa Amateur Athletic Club and adopted the red, black and white colours of the Association, and adopted the Club's triskelion logo. The uniform was not yet the 'barber pole' design, but a white jersey with black trim and the Club logo, <b>white</b> <b>knee</b> breeches and black stockings.|$|R
50|$|The folk outfits of {{the region}} are colorful. The most common men's outfit for Muslims and {{orthodox}} was the kilt known as fustanella, embroidered with silver thread, the doublet, short shirt with wide sleeves, the fez, the leather clogs with red topknots and <b>white</b> <b>knee</b> socks. Other parts of the outfit were the silver chest ornamental and the holster embroidered with silver thread used to carry a gun or a pistol.|$|R
5000|$|Traditionally the men wear a <b>white</b> <b>knee</b> length dhoti with a shirt or waist coat, {{white or}} {{coloured}} caps and ornaments like earrings and silver chains around their waist. The women wear a knee length dark blue saree with an aanchal worn {{from the front}} and left loose at the back. Popular accessories include colourful bead necklaces, and metal ornaments such as bangles or thick kadas around their ankles ...|$|R
2500|$|The {{rarely seen}} Tropical White Uniform (also {{referred}} to as Tropical White Short) {{was similar to the}} Summer White Service uniform, except <b>white</b> <b>knee</b> shorts and knee socks were worn. It was colloquially known as the [...] "Captain Steubing" [...] uniform, after the character on The Love Boat TV show. [...] Exceptionally rarely worn, though authorized with this uniform, was a pith helmet, with a Naval Officer's insignia at the front, above the brim.|$|R
2500|$|Following her {{appointment}} to the commission, news of her personal eccentricities began to emerge after reporters discovered she was living out of a 28-foot motor home, which was parked on a lot in rural Virginia. Each morning she was chauffeured from her RV to the AEC offices in Germantown, Maryland, accompanied by her [...] Scottish deerhound Ghillie, and a miniature poodle named Jacques. Media reports commented on her unusual hosiery (<b>white</b> <b>knee</b> socks).|$|R

2500|$|Reaction and {{the degree}} of {{irritation}} to a defensive urticating hair barrage can vary tremendously, based on the species in question. [...] Some, such as those of the Chilean rose tarantula (Grammastola rosea) and the Pinktoe tarantula (Avicularia avicularia), are fairly mild and innocuous to humans. [...] Others, such as those of the Brazilian giant <b>white</b> <b>knee</b> tarantula (Acanthoscurria geniculata), are moderately irritating. [...] Still others, such as the Goliath Birdeater (Theraphosa blondi), are far more severe. [...] These hairs can result in painful rashes, and have been likened to sharp shards of fiberglass.|$|R
50|$|The {{students}} of the school wear uniform. White half sleeved shirt, house T-Shirt, belt, school tie, white socks, white canvas shoes, navy blue socks and navy blue blazer for winter are common for all classes. Boys of Classes I to V must have white shorts, steel grey shorts, black laced boots, while those from Classes VI to XII must wear white trousers, steel grey trousers, black laced boots. Girls irrespective of their classes must wear <b>white</b> <b>knee</b> length box pleaded skirts, steel grey neck pinafore, navy blue and white winter stockings and black buckled shoes.|$|R
50|$|In 1834, the Russian Empire {{introduced}} diplomatic uniforms. As worn until 1917 {{these were}} of dark green (almost black) cloth with bicorn hats and braiding according to rank. Regulations introduced in 1904 specified six {{variations of the}} dark green uniform, depending {{on the nature of}} the occasion for which it was worn. These included plain uniforms without gold braid for office wear, plus <b>white</b> <b>knee</b> breeches and stocking for court functions when royalty were present. Peaked caps and epaulettes of military style were specified for street wear or informal occasions when the bicorn or braided tailcoat was considered unsuitable.|$|R
5000|$|As {{mentioned}} above, the Tracht, or costume, originates {{from the}} Chiemgau area (50 km SE of Munich) around 1900. The ladies {{in the group}} wear a white blouse with puffed sleeves, under a sleeveless dress made with laced bodice and a full Dirndl skirt. The dresses, {{in a variety of}} colours, are actually imported from Germany, as are the Lederhosen that the men wear. These dresses are always worn with an apron, <b>white</b> <b>knee</b> socks and black pumps. The ladies also wear an actual Edelweiss blossom, encased in glass and hung as a pendant from a black velvet band. Should you have the pleasure of witnessing the Bayrisch Guck dance, you will see that the girls wear lace-trimmed bloomers under their Dirndls! ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Sure," [...] said Keogh, as tenderly as {{he would}} have spoken to a child, and he laid a long {{forefinger}} on <b>White's</b> <b>knee.</b> [...] "I see. It's bad to have your art all slugged up like that. I know. You wanted to paint a big thing like the panorama of the battle of Gettysburg. But let me kalsomine you a little mental sketch to consider. Up to date we're out $385.50 on this scheme. Our capital took every cent both of us could raise. We've got about enough left to get back to New York on. I need my share of that ten thousand. I want to work a copper deal in Idaho, and make a hundred thousand. That's the business end of the thing. Come down off your art perch, Carry, and let's land that hatful of dollars." ...|$|R

They all wear sombreros. A few 2 -story wooden {{dwellings}} are visible behind them. A group of people are following them. An American flag is waving in the background...|$|R
50|$|The {{formation}} {{was known}} for its distinctive and elaborate uniforms, also based on that of the Algerian Zouaves, which consisted of a cotton shirt, a vest made of elk hide, a black silk robe, a collarless black silk frock coat, puffy hose, a black and <b>white</b> scarf, <b>knee</b> high leather boots, a red fez with a ram skin brim and a distinctive large embroidered white cross on the chest.|$|R
50|$|Predominantly, {{the music}} video {{comprises}} candy colors and choreography, and a pastel 1950s-theme. It features Trainor in an uncharacteristic wardrobe of sweaters and <b>white</b> <b>knee</b> socks. It opens with Trainor dancing {{in front of}} a pink pastel backdrop. She sports a light blue collared sweater beneath a sundress of the same color, and a material bow headpiece. The clip then switches to a scene with Trainor wearing a headpiece made of roses and a light pink collared-sweater beneath a sundress of the same color. The video returns to the original scene where Trainor engages in a dance scene with four other female dancers who sport similar outfits to her. The scene later sees the five girls dancing while sitting on chairs. The routine is intercepted with Maraschino donning a white collared shirt and light blue shorts performing a dance sequence on his own, which includes him doing split acrobatics. Three women, wearing platinum blonde wigs that cover their forehead and eyes, are also pictured in their own dance routine.|$|R

50|$|The {{characteristics}} of these breeds {{can be found}} in the Australian Draught Horse, which has produced many colours and types within the breed. All solid colours are accepted, excessive white is not favoured on the face or body, <b>white</b> below the <b>knee</b> is acceptable.|$|R
50|$|Despite {{coming off}} major {{surgeries}} on both <b>knees,</b> <b>White</b> had an incredible junior season at Oklahoma {{and won the}} Heisman Trophy in 2003. He completed 278 of 451 passes (61 percent) for 3,846 yards and 40 touchdowns and had a quarterback rating of 158.11.|$|R
5000|$|For grades 12 and 13 (affectionately called [...] "blue coats"): a short sleeved blue coat {{lined with}} white piping worn over a <b>white</b> A-line skirt (<b>knee</b> length), black shoes, white socks {{and a house}} badge to be pinned upon the left collar of their coat.|$|R
40|$|In {{this study}} {{gender and race}} {{differences}} in distal femoral morphology were investigated. Reliable anatomic knee measurements were obtained for 60 knees via MRI and direct scanning of cadaver specimens. The MRI data comprised of 20 White males and 22 White females while the cadaver specimens comprised of 18 Black males. Possible differences were investigated using a type of artificial neural network to classify the data, namely the self-organising map (SOM). The SOM suggested that clear differences are present between genders when absolute measurements are used. Male knees tended to be larger over all the measurements considered. However, when data were normalised for size, the clear differences were diminished and definite clusters were difficult to define. Black male knees tended to have larger condyle radius to anterior-posterior length ratios compared to White males. <b>White</b> male <b>knees</b> tended to be wider than <b>White</b> female <b>knees.</b> It is however suggested than when corrected for size, there exists a large variation among individual knees regardless of gender or race. It is argued that with the large variation in populations it can become advantageous {{not to think about}} gender-specific or race-specific knee replacement designs, but rather patient-specific. © 2011 Elsevier B.

60|$|Far {{and wide}} was a <b>white</b> carpet, <b>knee</b> deep, of hailstones; drifts {{of them were}} heaped up under the eaves and on the steps. When, {{three or four days}} later, those hailstones melted, the havoc they had wrought was plainly seen, for every green growing thing in the field or garden was cut off. Not only was every blossom {{stripped}} from the apple trees but great boughs and branches were wrenched away. And out of the two hundred trees set out by the Improvers by far the greater number were snapped off or torn to shreds.|$|R

30|$|The {{anatomic}} quantification of the meniscal root attachments in New Zealand white rabbit stifles {{found that}} it was similar to the human knee. Particularly, both anterior meniscal roots and the posteromedial meniscal root attachment shared similarities to the human knee joint. Based upon the findings of this study, it is recommended that the rabbit stifle could {{serve as a model for}} the natural history of meniscal root tears and the development of osteoarthritis. Further anatomic investigation of the New Zealand <b>white</b> rabbit <b>knee</b> utilizing a variety of imaging modalities would allow for more detailed structural characterization and further validate its effectiveness as an in vivo model.|$|R
6000|$|Harvey sat up to {{unfasten}} the belt, facing the head {{that had no}} face under its streaming hair. [...] "He's fast still," [...] he whispered to Dan, who slipped out his knife and cut the line, as Harvey flung the belt far overside. The body shot down with a plop, and Dan cautiously rose to his <b>knees,</b> <b>whiter</b> than the fog.|$|R
60|$|The mare frisked, and {{a breeze}} of air blew back a flap of skirt, showing an {{articulate}} knee where the trouser leg narrowed tightly over it.
