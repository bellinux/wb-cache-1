40|$|The concept ''transparency'' was {{introduced}} into the safeguards lexicon in the early 1990 s, and the term ''information barrier'' {{was introduced}} into the safeguards lexicon in the late 1990 s. Although the terms might have been new, the concepts were not. Both concepts {{have been used by}} the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and its inspectors since the early 1980 s, but the terms ''transparency'' and ''information barrier'' were not used for those concepts then. The definitions of these concepts have evolved in recent years, and these concepts have been applied to a broader <b>category</b> <b>of</b> special <b>nuclear</b> <b>material</b> measurement problems.

40|$|While {{substantial}} {{work has}} been performed in the Russian MPC&A Program, much {{more needs to be}} done at Russian nuclear facilities to complete four necessary steps. These are (1) periodically measuring the physical inventory <b>of</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>material,</b> (2) continuously measuring the flows <b>of</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>material,</b> (3) using the results to close the material balance, particularly at bulk processing facilities, and (4) statistically evaluating any apparent loss <b>of</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>material.</b> The periodic closing of material balances provides an objective test of the facility's system <b>of</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>material</b> protection, control and accounting. The statistical evaluation using the uncertainties associated with individual measurement systems involved in the calculation of the material balance provides a fair standard for concluding whether the apparent loss <b>of</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>material</b> means a diversion or whether the facility's accounting system needs improvement. In particular, if unattractive flow material at a facility is not measured well, the accounting system cannot readily detect the loss of attractive material if the latter substantially derives from the former...|$|R

40|$|The Department of Energy {{launched}} the <b>Nuclear</b> <b>Materials</b> Stewardship Initiative in January 2000 {{to accelerate the}} work of achieving integration and cutting long-term {{costs associated with the}} management <b>of</b> the Department's <b>nuclear</b> <b>materials,</b> with the principal focus on excess <b>materials.</b> Management <b>of</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>materials</b> is a fundamental and enduring responsibility that is essential to meeting the Department's national security, nonproliferation, energy, science, and environmental missions into the distant future. The effective management <b>of</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>materials</b> is important for a set of reasons: (1) some materials are vital to our national defense; (2) the materials pose physical and security risks; (3) managing them is costly; and (4) costs are likely to extend well into the future. The Department currently manages <b>nuclear</b> <b>materials</b> under eight programs, with offices in 36 different locations. Through the <b>Nuclear</b> <b>Materials</b> Stewardship Initiative, progress was during calendar year 20 00 in achieving better coordination and integration <b>of</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>materials</b> management responsibilities and in evaluating opportunities to further coordinate and integrate cross-program responsibilities for the treatment, storage, and disposition <b>of</b> excess <b>nuclear</b> <b>materials.</b> During CY 2001 the Departmental approach to <b>nuclear</b> <b>materials</b> stewardship changed consistent with the business processes followed by the new administration.

The Chinese government pays close attention to nuclear security and has set up laws and regulations to govern the use <b>of</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>materials.</b> The companies and operators that use <b>nuclear</b> <b>materials</b> have developed operational manuals and regulations to ensure the protection and control <b>of</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>materials</b> based on national laws and regulations.
