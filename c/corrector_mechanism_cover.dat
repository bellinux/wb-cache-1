40|$|During {{image quality}} {{testing in the}} third and final thermal-vacuum test of the {{integrated}} WFC 3 instrument, an anomaly was discovered whereby the width and peak signal fraction of short exposure PSF images were observed to modulate for alternate exposures in a series. This behavior was traced to vibration of the UVIS shutter when its servo-control loop is enabled, which is believed to induce small (mas level) pointing jitter in the optics, most likely the pick-off mirror and the <b>corrector</b> <b>mechanism</b> (M 1) mirror. We present model computations of the effects of this vibration on several PSF parameters for a range of exposure times, wavelengths and (currently uncertain) degree of severity of the vibration expected on orbit. Only very short (< 10 s) exposures are likely to be significantly affected; this may be partially mitigated by obtaining such exposures using the better-performing side of the shutter...|$|R

40|$|Learning is {{currently}} the focus of much research activity in cognitive science. But, typically, this research is oriented towards either the symbolprocessing paradigm or the connectionist paradigm and therefore tends to generate models of two quite different types. A satisfactory theory of learning will, presumably, deal with the phenomenon in general terms rather than in terms of two special cases, so there {{would appear to be}} a need to try to identify abstractions which generalise the two types of model typically produced. The aim of the present paper is to identify one such abstraction.

40|$|This work {{describes}} {{the design and}} testing of a shutter mechanism for a miniaturized infrared spectrometer developed for the ESA ExoMars Pasteur mission. Unlike most usual <b>cover</b> <b>mechanisms,</b> the conceived one provides a roto-translational motion. This feature allows the sealing of the interferometer main entrance window from dust contamination, {{in addition to the}} usual function of shuttering the instrument field of view. Although this characteristic is strongly desired because it avoids dust deposition and optics contamination while the instrument is not operating, it makes the mechanism design significantly more complex. Moreover, challenging design constraints were faced: the mass budget allowed for no more than 30 g allocation, the expected working thermal range extended down to - 80 C and high vibration levels with an acceleration peak of 670 m/s 2 were predicted during Mars landing. To complete the picture, the <b>mechanism</b> <b>cover</b> was required to provide also a calibration target for the 2 - 25 μm spectral range of the spectrometer. The resulting system is made by a calibrating/shutter cover moved by a purposely designed out of plane cams system which provides the desired motion.

40|$|Abstract. In this paper, {{we propose}} {{to study the}} {{influence}} of different learning mechanisms of social behaviours on a given multi-agent model (Sibertin-Blanc et al. 2005). The studied model has been elaborated from a formalization of the organized action theory (Crozier and Friedberg 1977) {{and is based on}} the modelling of control and dependency relationships between resources and actors. The proposed learning <b>mechanisms</b> <b>cover</b> different possible implementations of the classifier systems on this model. In order to compare our results with existing ones in a classical framework, we restrain here the study to cases corresponding to the prisoner’s dilemma framework. The obtained results exhibit variability about convergence times as well as emergent social behaviours depending on the implementation choices for the learning classifier systems (LCS) and on the LCS parameters. We conclude by analysing the sources of this variability and giving perspectives about the use of such a model in broader cases. 1...|$|R
