5000|$|Many {{commercial}} AFM <b>cantilever</b> <b>tips</b> have pre-measured resonant {{frequencies and}} force constants which are {{provided to the}} customer. As sampling proceeds, the <b>cantilever</b> <b>tip’s</b> position changes, which causes the scanning laser wavelength (650 nm) to deviate from its original position on the detector. The z-piezo scanner then recognizes this deviation and moves vertically to return the laser spot to its set position. This vertical movement by the z-piezo scanner is correlated {{to a change in}} voltage. Sampling in contact mode relies upon intermolecular forces between the tip and surface as depicted by Van der Waals force. As the sampling begins, the tip is moved close to the sample which creates a weakly attractive force between them. Another force which is often present in contact mode is capillary force due to hydration on the sample surface. This force is due to the ability of the water to contact the tip, thus creating an undesirable attractive force. Capillary force, along with several other sources of tip contamination, are key factors in the decreased resolution observed while sampling ...|$|R
5000|$|Several forces {{affect the}} {{behavior}} of the cantilever: attractive and repulsive Van der Waals forces, and electrostatic repulsion. Changes in these forces are monitored by a guide laser that is reflected off the back of the cantilever and detected by a photodetector. Attractive forces between the atoms on the sample surface and the atom at the AFM tip draw the <b>cantilever</b> <b>tip</b> closer to the surface. When the <b>cantilever</b> <b>tip</b> and the sample surface come within a range of a few angstroms repulsive forces come into play as a result of electrostatic interactions. There is also a force exerted from the cantilever pressing down on the tip. The magnitude of the force exerted by the cantilever is dependent upon the direction of its motion, whether it is attracted or repelled from the sample surface When the tip of the cantilever and the surface come into contact, the single atom at the point of the tip and the atoms on the surface exhibit a Lennard-Jones potential. The atoms exhibit attractive forces until a certain point and then experience repulsion from one another. The term ro is the separation at which the sum of the potentials between the two atoms is zero ...|$|E
50|$|Atomic-force {{microscopy}} (AFM) is {{a powerful}} microscopy technique used for studying samples at a nanoscale and {{is often used to}} image protein distribution on a surface. It consists of a cantilever with a tip to scan over the surface. It is a valuable tool for measuring protein-protein and protein-surface interaction. However, the limiting factor of many AFM studies is that imaging is often performed after drying the surface which might affect protein folding and the structure of the protein layer. Moreover, the <b>cantilever</b> <b>tip</b> can dislodge a protein or corrugate the protein layer.|$|E
5000|$|Electrostatic force {{microscopy}} (EFM) {{is a type}} {{of dynamic}} non-contact atomic force microscopy where the electrostatic force is probed. ("Dynamic" [...] here means that the cantilever is oscillating and does not make contact with the sample). This force arises due to the attraction or repulsion of separated charges. It is a long-range force and can be detected 100 nm or more from the sample. For example, consider a conductive <b>cantilever</b> <b>tip</b> and sample which are separated a distance z usually by a vacuum. A bias voltage between tip and sample is applied by an external battery forming a capacitor, C, between the two. The capacitance of the system depends on the geometry of the tip and sample. The total energy stored in that capacitor is U = ½ C⋅ΔV2. The work done by the battery to maintain a constant voltage, ΔV, between the capacitor plates (tip and sample) is -2U. By definition, taking the negative gradient of the total energy Utotal = -U gives the force. The z component of the force (the force along the axis connecting the tip and sample) is thus: ...|$|E

50|$|For contact {{potential}} measurements a lock-in amplifier {{is used to}} detect the cantilever oscillation at ω. During the scan VDC will be adjusted so that the electrostatic forces between the tip and the sample become zero and thus the response at the frequency ω becomes zero. Since the electrostatic force at ω depends on VDC − VCPD, the value of VDC that minimizes the ω-term corresponds to the {{contact potential}}. Absolute values of the sample work function can be obtained if the tip is first calibrated against a reference sample of known work function. Apart from this, one can use the normal topographic scan methods at the resonance frequency ω independently of the above. Thus, in one scan, the topography and the contact potential of the sample are determined simultaneously.This {{can be done in}} (at least) two different ways: 1) The topography is captured in AC mode which means that the cantilever is driven by a piezo at its resonant frequency. Simultaneously the AC voltage for the KPFM measurement is applied at a frequency slightly lower than the resonant frequency of the cantilever. In this measurement mode the topography and the contact potential difference are captured {{at the same time and}} this mode is often called single-pass. 2) One line of the topography is captured either in contact or AC mode and is stored internally. Then, this line is scanned again, while the cantilever remains on a defined distance to the sample without a mechanically driven oscillation but the AC voltage of the KPFM measurement is applied and the contact potential is captured as explained above. It is important to note that the <b>cantilever</b> <b>tip</b> must not be too close to the sample in order to allow good oscillation with applied AC voltage. Therefore, KPFM can be performed simultaneously during AC topography measurements but not during contact topography measurements.|$|E
40|$|When a micro {{cantilever}} with a nanoscale tip is manipulated on a substrate with atomic roughness, e. g., pushing an atomic-scale sample or etching {{the surface}} of the substrate to draw desired patterns, the periodical lateral frictional forces with stochastic fluctuations will induce stick-slip motion of the <b>cantilever</b> <b>tip,</b> which may greatly influence the precision of the nano manipulation. To reduce such a stick-slip motion, we propose a feedback control strategy based on the position estimation of the <b>cantilever</b> <b>tip</b> to compensate the periodical frictional force. Numerical simulations show that the motion of the <b>cantilever</b> <b>tip</b> under feedback control can track the desired trajectory asymptotically. Our proposal can aL be extended to the case when the <b>cantilever</b> <b>tip</b> moves over a Gaussian-shape defection on the substrate and when the stochastic fluctuations in the lateral force are with non-zero correlation time. © 2010 IEEE.

40|$|In the low-Earth-orbit environment, solar {{ultraviolet}} (UV) radiation embrittles {{polymer materials}} through bond breaking and crosslinking. This UV embrittlement increases the surface hardness of the polymer. Before {{the durability of}} polymer materials in the low- Earth-orbit environment can be predicted, the extent of UV embrittlement needs to be determined. However, traditional techniques for measuring the microhardness of materials cannot be employed to measure changes in the hardness of UV-embrittled surfaces because traditional techniques measure bulk hardness and are not sensitive enough to surface changes. A unique technique was used at the NASA Lewis Research Center to quantify polymer surface damage that had been induced by UV radiation. The technique uses an atomic force microscope (AFM) to measure surface microhardness. An atomic force microscope measures the repulsive forces between the atoms in a microscopic <b>cantilevered</b> <b>tip</b> and the atoms {{on the surface of}} a sample. Typically, an atomic force microscope produces a topographic image of a surface by monitoring the movement of the tip over features of the surface.

In this thesis, we {{have studied the}} use of {{integrated}} optical waveguide devices acting as integrated displacement sensors on cantilevers for scanning probe microscopes. These displacement sensors include integrated optical waveguide devices such as Bragg gratings, ring resonators, race track resonators and waveguide Michelson interferometers fabricated on a cantilever to measure the displacement of the <b>cantilever</b> <b>tip</b> due to the forces between surface and the tip. The displacement of the <b>cantilever</b> <b>tip</b> is measured directly from the change of the transmission characteristics of the optical device. As the <b>cantilever</b> <b>tip</b> displaces, the stress on the cantilever surface changes the refractive index of the materials {{that make up the}} integrated optical device which cause variations in its optical transmission characteristics.

40|$|When a micro {{cantilever}} with a nano-scale tip is manipulated on a substrate with atomic-scale roughness, {{the periodic}} lateral frictional force and stochastic fluctuations may induce stick-slip {{motion of the}} <b>cantilever</b> <b>tip,</b> which greatly decreases the precision of the nano manipulation. This unwanted motion cannot be reduced by open-loop control especially when there exist parameter uncertainties in the system model, and thus needs to introduce feedback control.

40|$|In {{this work}} we have {{designed}} a simple system to investigate empirically the image contrast of tapping-mode {{atomic force microscopy}} (TMAFM). We modified the <b>cantilever</b> <b>tips</b> with protein molecules (bovine serum albumin or goat anti-biotin antibody) and used these protein-modified cantilevers to scan poly-L-lysine films and antibody layers deposited on mica in air under ambient conditions. We also investigated the effects of manipulating the setpoint voltage in this system. It was found that extra topographic features with a patchlike appearance were introduced into the TMAFM images of both the poly-L-lysine and antibody films when scanned with the protein-modified tips, even at initial preset setpoints, and were superimposed on the topography of the samples. The surface coverage of the patchlike features in the TMAFM images changes significantly with the setpoint voltage in a reversible and nonlinear manner. These are believed to arise from the surface indentation of the sample or from the structural deformation of the proteins at the tip induced in TMAFM imaging. Interestingly, it was observed in the experiment that no structural alteration or damage was discernible on the sample surface, even after continuous scanning with the protein-modified tips {{for a long period}} of time, with varying setpoint voltage.
