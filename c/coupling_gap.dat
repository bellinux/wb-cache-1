40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this work is to study {{the effect of a}} {{selectively}} etched ferroelectric thin film layer on the performance of an electrically tunable filter. An X-band tunable filter was designed, fabricated and tested on a selectively etched Barium Strontium Titanate (BSTO) ferroelectric thin film layer. Tunable filters with varying lengths of BSTO thin-film in the input and output <b>coupling</b> <b>gaps</b> were modeled, as well as experimentally tested.

40|$|Gas {{detection}} and gas sensing based on hollow core photonic bandgap fiber (HC-PBF) {{is a very}} promising technique due to the long interaction light-gas lengths that are achievable. However, long path-lengths also imply higher gas filling times of the hollow fiber and higher response times of the detection systems what can constitute a serious practical inconvenience. In this paper, the high sensitivity is maintained but the sensor response time is reduced by using multiple <b>coupling</b> fiber <b>gaps.</b> The results and conclusions extracted from a systematic experimental study (comparing the spectra and filling time of different HC-PBF lengths and different number of <b>coupling</b> <b>gaps)</b> are presented and discussed.

40|$|The {{nonlinear}} optical {{response of}} silicene in terahertz (THz) regime is theoretically studied. Since the intrinsic spin-orbit <b>coupling</b> <b>gap</b> of silicene {{is in the}} order of 1 THz, the optical response in few THz frequency regime is strongly enhanced by linear and nonlinear conductivity peaks. Furthermore, these conductivity peaks are gate-tunable. The frequency-tripling nonlinear optical current can be significantly larger than the single-frequency current under a moderate electric field strength of 1000 V/cm.

40|$|Three-dimensional (3 D) locally {{resonant}} sonic materials (LRSMs) are studied theoretically for {{purpose of}} optimising their sub-wavelength performance by coupling resonance and Bragg scattering effects together. Through {{the study of}} effective sound speeds of LRSMs, {{we find that the}} starting frequency of Bragg scattering can be shifted to sub-wavelength region by softening coats of resonators when the matrix is a low shear-velocity medium. A similar result can be achieved by compressing the lattice constant. By using a layer-multiple-scattering method, we investigate the complex band structure and the transmission spectrum of an LRSM whose Bragg gap is already close to the resonance gap in frequency. The wave fields of the composite simulated by COMSOL are further analysed at several typical frequencies. The result shows that the approaching of two kinds of gaps not only broadens the bandwidth of the resonance gap, but also increases the depth of the Bragg gap since the interaction between resonant modes and scattering waves are enhanced. By varying the shear velocity of coats, we obtain a <b>coupled</b> <b>gap,</b> which exhibits a broad transmission gap in the sub-wavelength region. When the loss of coats is considered, the <b>coupled</b> <b>gap</b> can not only maintain a good sound blocking performance, but also perform an efficient absorption in the low frequency region...|$|R

40|$|In {{whispering}} gallery mode resonator sensing applications, {{the conventional}} way to detect {{a change in the}} parameter to be measured is by observing the steady state transmission spectrum through the coupling waveguide. Alternatively, cavity ring-up spectroscopy (CRUS) sensing can be achieved transiently. In this work, we investigate CRUS using coupled mode equations and find analytical solutions with a large spectral broadening approximation of the input pulse. The relationships between the frequency detuning, <b>coupling</b> <b>gap</b> and ring-up peak height are determined and experimentally verified using an ultrahigh Q-factor silica microsphere.

Here, we study the optical response of a cantilever-like, silica, microsphere pendulum, evanescently coupled to a fiber taper. In a whispering gallery mode resonator the cavity mode and motion of the pendulum result in both dispersive and dissipative optomechanical interactions. This unique mechanism leads to an experimentally observable, asymmetric response function of the transduction spectrum which can be explained using coupled-mode theory. The optomechanical transduction, {{and its relationship to}} the external <b>coupling</b> <b>gap,</b> are investigated and we show that the experimental behavior is in good agreement with the theoretical predictions.

40|$|Detailed {{studies and}} {{discussions on the}} {{determination}} of <b>coupling</b> <b>gap</b> and designing of the dipole mode stabilizer rods in an RFQ with intense beams have been done. By making use of the existent cold model of one section RFQ, measuring of the frequencies of the eigen modes, tuning and measuring of the RF field distributions and experiments related to the dipole mode stabilizer rods are carried out. By making comparison between {{the results from the}} experiments and from the computer simulations, the reliability and creditability of the code used in designing the RFQ cavity is proved. In the same time, a beneficial physical discussion on the design of RFQ with stability is given. The cut-off frequency of RFQ cavity is chosen as 351 MHz. The balance between the cut-off frequency and the operating one will compensate by the tuners. The inter-vane voltage is kept constant along the structure in our RFQ design. So, as concerns the operating mode (TE 210) mode, the <b>coupling</b> <b>gap</b> does not affect the operating mode frequency and its RF field distribution since no capacitance exists in the gap for this mode. But it is not the case for other modes, the frequency difference between the operating mode and the neighboring quadrupole modes at its left and right side can be chosen to be equal by adjusting the gap width. For our two-segments RFQ, the left and right side neighboring modes are π mode of TE 210 (π TE 210) and zero mode of TE 211 (0 TE 211), respectively. Simulations show that, when the gap width mmg 8. 1 =, the frequency interval of π TE 210, 0 TE 210 and the interval of 0 TE 210, 0 TE 211 are nearly the same.

40|$|A new slotted ground {{structure}} featuring compact size and spurious-free passband {{in the context}} of microstrip lines is proposed. The compactness of the new structure originates from the lengthened <b>coupling</b> <b>gap</b> in the ground.

The new structure also provides flexibilities in introducing additional functionalities to the bandstop resonators.

40|$|Cortical {{oscillations}} {{are thought}} to be involved in many cognitive functions and processes. Several mechanisms have been proposed to regulate oscillations. One prominent but understudied mechanism is gap-junctional <b>coupling.</b> <b>Gap</b> junctions are ubiquitous in cortex between GABAergic interneurons. Moreover, recent experiments indicate their strength can be modified in an activity-dependent manner, similar to chemical synapses. We hypothesized that activity-dependent gap junction plasticity acts as a mechanism to regulate oscillations in the cortex. We developed a computational model of gap junction plasticity in a recurrent cortical network. We showed that gap junction plasticity can serve as a homeostatic mechanism for oscillations by maintaining a tight balance between two network states: asynchronous irregular activity and synchronized oscillations. This homeostatic mechanism allows for robust communication between neuronal assemblies through two different mechanisms: transient oscillations and frequency modulation. This implies a direct functional role for gap junction plasticity in information transmission in cortex...|$|E
