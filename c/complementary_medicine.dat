40|$|Background: The use of <b>complementary</b> <b>medicines</b> {{in those}} with mental health {{problems}} is well documented. However, their effectiveness is often not established {{and they may be}} less harmless than commonly assumed. Aims: To review the <b>complementary</b> <b>medicines</b> routinely encountered in psychiatric practice, their effectiveness, potential adverse effects and interactions. Method: Electronic and manual literature search on the effectiveness and safety of psychotropic <b>complementary</b> <b>medicines.</b> Results: Potentially useful substances include ginkgo and hydergine as cognitive enhancers, passion flower and valerian as sedatives, St Johnâ 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 9 s wort and s-adenosylmethionine as antidepressants, and selenium and folate to complement antidepressants. The evidence is less conclusive for the use of omega- 3 fatty acids as augmentation treatment in schizophrenia, melatonin for tardive dyskinesia and 18 -methoxycoronaridine, an ibogaine derivative, for the treatment of cocaine and heroin addiction.

25|$|The Swiss Federal Constitution {{defines the}} Swiss Confederation and the Cantons of Switzerland {{within the scope}} of their powers to oversee <b>complementary</b> <b>medicine.</b> In particular, the Federal {{authorities}} must set up diplomas for the practice of non-scientific medicine. The first of such diplomas has been validated in April 2015 for the practice of naturopathy. There is a long tradition for naturopathy and traditional medicine in Switzerland. The Cantons of Switzerland make their own public health regulations. Although the law in certain cantons is typically monopolistic, the authorities are relatively tolerant with regard to alternative practitioners.|$|E
25|$|The Swiss {{programme}} for {{the evaluation}} of <b>complementary</b> <b>medicine</b> (PEK) resulted in the peer-reviewed Shang publication (see Systematic reviews and meta-analyses of efficacy) and a controversial competing analysis by homeopaths and advocates led by Gudrun Bornhöft and Peter Matthiessen, which has misleadingly been presented as a Swiss government report by homeopathy proponents, a claim that has been repudiated by the Swiss Federal Office of Public Health. The Swiss Government terminated reimbursement, though it was subsequently reinstated after a political campaign and referendum for a further six-year trial period.|$|E

40|$|The {{last few}} decades have seen the rise of {{alternative}} medical approaches {{including the use of}} herbal supplements, natural products, and traditional medicines, which are collectively known as ‘Complementary medicines’. However, there are increasing concerns on the safety and health benefits of these medicines. One of the main hazards with the use of <b>complementary</b> <b>medicines</b> is the presence of heavy metal(loid) s such as arsenic (As), cadmium (Cd), lead (Pb), and mercury (Hg). This review deals with the characteristics of <b>complementary</b> <b>medicines</b> in terms of heavy metal(loid) s sources, distribution, bioavailability, toxicity, and human risk assessment. The heavy metal(loid) s in these medicines are derived from uptake by medicinal plants, cross-contamination during processing, and therapeutic input of metal(loid) s. This paper discusses the distribution of heavy metal(loid) s in these medicines, in terms of their nature, concentration, and speciation. The importance of determining bioavailability towards human health risk assessment was emphasized by the need to estimate daily intake of heavy metal(loid) s in <b>complementary</b> <b>medicines.</b> The review ends with selected case studies of heavy metal(loid) toxicity from <b>complementary</b> <b>medicines</b> with specific reference to As, Cd, Pb, and Hg. The future research opportunities mentioned in the conclusion of review will help researchers to explore new avenues, methodologies, and approaches to the issue of heavy metal(loid) s in <b>complementary</b> <b>medicines,</b> thereby generating new regulations and proposing fresh approach towards safe use of these medicines...|$|R
40|$|There is an {{increasing}} interest in <b>complementary</b> and alternative <b>medicines</b> and therapies in Australia and overseas.

In the report ‘Complementary Medicines in the Australian Health System’ 1, the Expert Committee identified a number of concerns and made a series of recommendations to facilitate safe, appropriate and effective use of CMs. One specific concern was the need for consumers and health professionals to have ‘accurate, reliable and independent information’ about CMs and to have appropriate skills to ‘interpret available information’ and ‘discriminate between reliable and unreliable information’ to allow them to make informed decisions about the use of CMs...|$|R

25|$|Dr Michael Dixon was {{appointed}} the Foundation's medical director. From 2005 to 2007, FIH received {{a grant from}} the Department of Health to help organise the self-regulation of complementary therapies. There had been concern that with {{a large proportion of the}} public turning to complementary approaches, there were few safeguards in place to ensure that non-statutorily regulated therapists were safe, trained and would act in an appropriate way. FIH worked to bring together the representative bodies of many complementary professions to talk and agree standards. The result was the formation of the Complementary and Natural Healthcare Council (CNHC) which had hoped to register 10,000 practitioners of <b>complementary</b> <b>medicine</b> by the end of 2009 but which by September 2009 had succeeded in enrolling less than a tenth of that number due to lack of interest on the part of some of their professional associations. The Department of Health is currently continuing to fund the CNHC but future funding will be dependent on substantial progress being made towards the target (which has now been reduced to 2,000). Alternative medicine campaigners argued that the move toward regulation conferred undue respectability on unproven and possibly unsafe CAM approaches.|$|E

40|$|Aims. To {{investigate}} patients' {{attitudes toward}} <b>complementary</b> and alternative <b>medicine,</b> the education nurses provided about <b>complementary</b> and alternative <b>medicine</b> for treating depression and {{to test whether}} such education mediates the effect of <b>complementary</b> and alternative <b>medicine</b> use and attitudes toward <b>complementary</b> and alternative <b>medicine.</b> Background. Although we know that attitudes influence behaviour, very few studies simultaneously explore the relationship between attitudes, education and <b>complementary</b> and alternative <b>medicine</b> use. Design. Survey. Methods. This study was conducted {{as part of a}} larger survey, using face-to-face survey interviews with 206 adult patients aged 50 years or over and hospitalised in conventional hospitals in Taiwan for treatment of depression. The attitudes toward <b>complementary</b> and alternative <b>medicine</b> and patient education about <b>complementary</b> and alternative <b>medicine</b> instruments were specially developed for the study. Results. Participants expressed slightly favourable attitudes toward <b>complementary</b> and alternative <b>medicine.</b> Many participants (50 %) expressed that they were willing to try any potential treatment for depression. They believed that <b>complementary</b> and alternative <b>medicine</b> helped them to feel better and to live a happier life. However, 66 絥 of participants reported that they had inadequate knowledge of <b>complementary</b> and alternative <b>medicine.</b> Participants with a higher monthly income, longer depression duration and religious beliefs hold more positive attitudes toward <b>complementary</b> and alternative <b>medicine.</b> Most participants were not satisfied with the education they received about <b>complementary</b> and alternative <b>medicine.</b> Patient education about <b>complementary</b> and alternative <b>medicine</b> was found to be a mediator for the use of <b>complementary</b> and alternative <b>medicine.</b> Conclusion. Patient education from nurses may predict patients' attitudes toward <b>complementary</b> and alternative <b>medicine.</b> Continuing nursing education is needed to enable nurses to respond knowledgeably to concerns patients may have about <b>complementary</b> and alternative <b>medicine</b> and treatment options. Relevance to clinical practice. This study highlights the potential role of patient education about <b>complementary</b> and alternative <b>medicine</b> as an effective way of adjusting patients' attitudes toward <b>complementary</b> and alternative <b>medicine</b> and to link both patients' preferences for <b>complementary</b> and alternative <b>medicine</b> and health professionals' concerns about the proper use of <b>complementary</b> and alternative <b>medicine</b> for depression management and adverse drug interactions.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: Many {{pediatric}} patients use <b>complementary</b> {{and alternative}} <b>medicine,</b> especially when facing a chronic illness for which treatment options are limited. So far, {{research on the}} use of <b>complementary</b> and alternative <b>medicine</b> in patients with functional gastrointestinal disease has been scarce. This study was designed to assess <b>complementary</b> and alternative <b>medicine</b> use in children with different gastrointestinal diseases, including functional disorders, to determine which factors predicted <b>complementary</b> and alternative <b>medicine</b> use and to assess the willingness of parents to participate in future studies on <b>complementary</b> and alternative <b>medicine</b> efficacy and safety. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The prevalence of <b>complementary</b> and alternative <b>medicine</b> use was assessed by using a questionnaire for 749 children visiting pediatric gastroenterology clinics of 9 hospitals in the Netherlands. The questionnaire consisted of 35 questions on the child's gastrointestinal disease, medication use, health status, past and future <b>complementary</b> and alternative <b>medicine</b> use, reasons for its use, and the necessity of <b>complementary</b> and alternative <b>medicine</b> research. RESULTS: In this study population, the frequency of <b>complementary</b> and alternative <b>medicine</b> use was 37. 6 %. A total of 60. 3 % of this group had used <b>complementary</b> and altern?tive <b>medicine</b> specifically for their gastrointestinal disease. This specific <b>complementary</b> and alternative <b>medicine</b> use was higher in patients with functional disorders than organic disorders (25. 3 % vs 17. 2 %). Adverse effects of allopathic medication, school absenteeism, age <or= 11 years, and a low effect of conventional treatment were predictors of specific <b>complementary</b> and alternative <b>medicine</b> use. Almost all (93 %) of the parents considered it important that pediatricians initiate <b>complementary</b> and alternative <b>medicine</b> research, and 51 % of parents were willing to participate in future <b>complementary</b> and alternative <b>medicine</b> trials. CONCLUSIONS: Almost 40 % of parents of pediatric gastroenterology patients are turning to <b>complementary</b> and alternative <b>medicine</b> for their child. Lack of effectiveness of conventional therapy, school absenteeism, and adverse effects of allopathic medication are more important predictors of <b>complementary</b> and alternative <b>medicine</b> use than the type of gastrointestinal disease.
