500|$|Musically, Title {{comprises}} throwback style sound, 1950s doo wop-inspired {{songs that}} straddle {{the line between}} modern R and melodic pop. The EP's opening track, [...] "All About That Bass" [...] is a bubblegum pop, doo-wop song {{which serves as a}} throwback to 1950s and 1960s music, and contains elements from a complex mix of several genres; R, hip hop, tropical, country and rock and roll. Sonically, [...] "All About That Bass" [...] comprises an earworm hook, early 1960s soul-pop groove, scatting tempo and shimmying melody. Lyrically, [...] "All About That Bass" [...] serves as a <b>callout</b> to embrace one's appearance and promote a positive body image. The song metaphorically refers to the appearance of a woman's bottom. Larger women are described as [...] "bass" [...] and thinner women as [...] "treble", which Trainor implies as a joke about [...] "thick and thin". The lyric [...] "I'm bringing booty back" [...] references Justin Timberlake's [...] "SexyBack" [...] (2006). In the song, she also calls out the fashion industry for creating unreachable standards of beauty: [...] "I see the magazines working that Photoshop / We know that shit ain't real, c'mon make it stop / You know I won't be no stick-figure Barbie doll." ...|$|E

2500|$|For 1961, new 2-door {{sedan and}} hardtop models were released, but no {{changes were made}} to the 4-door sedan and wagon sheet metal. The {{interior}} and exterior trim were changed to provide model year differentiation, a mild form of planned obsolescence. The radiator grille stamping was the same as in 1960, but for 1961 it was painted with a pattern of black squares. The central grille ornament was still pulled from the bottom to release the hood, but it was now faced with an emblem having a white field with the blue-and-red stylized [...] "V" [...] Valiant logo, rather than 1960's red field with gold script [...] "Valiant" [...] <b>callout.</b> The side trim was changed; a [...] stainless spear was placed at the rear of each tailfin crease, a hockey stick-shaped trim was applied to the lower break line, and the front fender/door crease was capped with a long stainless spear.

Matching round [...] "V200" [...] callouts were placed in round housings at the midpoint of the front fender spears.

2500|$|Fender and hood {{stampings}} {{were similar}} to the 1960-'61 items, but neither identical nor interchangeable. At the rear, the cat's-eye tail lamps were deleted. A wraparound stainless trim {{was applied to the}} tailfins, below which were placed round tail lamps set into stamped aluminum bezels. These occupied the space formerly available for optional backup lamps, which for 1962 flanked the license plate below the rear bumper. The spare-tire stamping was eliminated from the deck lid, which was now a smooth stamping with a small central ridge at its trailing edge. On V200 deck lids, a large round emblem surrounded an oblong block-letter [...] "VALIANT" [...] <b>callout</b> on a black field. Similar block-letter/black-field callouts were placed on each front fender. On the Signet, the deck lid was adorned with a smaller round emblem surrounding the red-and-blue stylized-V Valiant logo.|$|E

Due to the terrain in the area, the aircraft was actually only [...] above runway level at the time. Simultaneously to this <b>callout,</b> the FDR recorded a brief pull on the control column, likely done by the first officer, as he instinctively started the go-around sequence of actions. According to the investigation, this attempt at a go-around was completely overridden by the auto-pilot, which was still active, and, in any event, it was not completed (protocol requires that the correct sequence of operations during a go-around attempt involves increasing thrust to takeoff mode and disengaging the autopilot, neither action was done at the time). Flight simulator testing by the investigation concluded that had the first officer completed a go-around at this point, the crash would likely have been avoided despite the violation of minimums and the excessive rate of descent. The investigation found that this was the last moment at which a go-around would have been successful.|$|E
