40|$|University of Minnesota M. S. thesis. May 2013. Major: Animal science. Advisor: Leslie B. Hansen. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); x, 75 pages. Crossbreeding was initiated in two institutional herds of the University of Minnesota in 2000. Montbeliarde (MO) -sired progeny of pure Holstein (HO) and Jersey × HO crossbred (JH) <b>cows</b> along with pure HO <b>cows</b> calved {{for the first}} time from 2005 to 2010 in both herds. Montbeliarde (MO) -sired crossbred <b>cows</b> (n = 57) were compared with pure Holstein (HO) <b>cows</b> (n = 40) for dry matter intake (DMI), production, hip height, body condition score (BCS), and body weight (BW) during the first 150 d of first lactation. Also, production for 305 d was compared for first lactation. This subset of <b>cows</b> from the larger crossbreeding study were housed at the University of Minnesota St. Paul dairy and calved from 2005 to 2007. The MO-sired crossbred <b>cows</b> were composed of MO × HO <b>cows</b> (n = 33) and MO × Jersey/HO <b>cows</b> (n = 24). <b>Cows</b> were individually fed a total mixed ration twice daily. The DMI was measured for the first 150 d of lactation, except DMI was not recorded from d 1 to 3 postpartum to permit <b>cows</b> to acclimate to stalls in a confinement barn. Hip height was measured once between 20 and 172 d postpartum, and BCS and BW were recorded every other week. The MO-sired crossbred <b>cows</b> did not differ from the pure HO <b>cows</b> for 150 -d DMI, 150 -d fat plus protein production, or for 305 -d fat plus protein production. Hip height was similar for MO × HO and pure HO <b>cows,</b> but MO × Jersey/HO <b>cows</b> had shorter hip height than the pure HO <b>cows.</b> Despite the lack of difference for DMI, the MO-sired crossbred <b>cows</b> had significantly greater BCS (3. 30 vs. 2. 74) and BW (551 kg vs. 528 kg) than the pure HO <b>cows.</b> The MO-sired crossbred <b>cows</b> (122 d) had fewer days open than the pure HO <b>cows</b> (150 d). The higher BCS of the MO-sired crossbred <b>cows,</b> especially during early lactation, may have provided an advantage for fertility. Differences for DMI between breed groups were not studied for the latter half of first lactation or for multiparous <b>cows.</b> Subsequently, Montbeliarde (MO) -sired crossbred <b>cows</b> (n = 150) were compared with pure Holstein (HO) <b>cows</b> (n = 163) for production, somatic cell score (SCS), fertility, survival to subsequent calving, mortality, and body measurements during their first five lactations. The MO-sired crossbreds <b>cows</b> consisted of MO × HO <b>cows</b> (n = 59) and MO × (Jersey/HO) <b>cows</b> (n = 91) and were housed in either a high-input, confinement herd (St. Paul) or a low-input, grazing herd (Morris). Body, hoof, and udder measurements of <b>cows</b> were objectively measured. The MO × HO crossbred <b>cows</b> were not different for fat plus protein production during any lactation and had significantly lower SCS during second lactation compared with the pure HO <b>cows.</b> However, the MO × (Jersey/HO) crossbred <b>cows</b> had 5 % lower fat plus protein production with similar SCS compared with pure HO <b>cows</b> at St. Paul. On the other hand, the MO × (Jersey/HO) crossbred <b>cows</b> were not different for fat plus protein production and had lower SCS in third to fifth lactation compared with pure HO <b>cows</b> at Morris. Across herds, the MO-sired crossbred <b>cows</b> had 41 fewer days open and 12 % higher pregnancy rate compared with the pure HO <b>cows.</b> Furthermore, the MO-sired crossbred <b>cows</b> (8 %) had lower mortality rates than the pure HO <b>cows</b> (18 %). Because of superior fertility and lower mortality rates, the MO-sired crossbred <b>cows</b> had greater survival to second (+ 13 %), third (+ 24 %), fourth (+ 25 %), and fifth (+ 17 %) calving in comparison to pure HO <b>cows.</b> For body measurements, MO × HO were similar to pure HO <b>cows</b> for hip height and heart girth, but MO × HO <b>cows</b> had more body condition and greater body weight than pure HO <b>cows</b> during first (+ 39 kg), second (+ 80 kg), and third to fifth (+ 39 kg) lactations. The MO × (Jersey/HO) had more body condition but shorter hip height than pure HO <b>cows,</b> and this resulted in less body weight across the first five lactations. The additional body condition of MO-sired crossbred <b>cows</b> may likely provide an advantage for fertility. Foot angle was steeper and hoof length was shorter for MO × HO <b>cows,</b> but MO × (Jersey/HO) <b>cows</b> were similar to pure HO <b>cows</b> for hoof measurements. The MO-sired crossbred <b>cows</b> had 3. 6 cm less udder clearance and 2. 6 cm greater front teat width than pure HO <b>cows...</b>|$|R

The total number of days in milk of working <b>cows</b> was similar to that of non-working <b>cows.</b> However, days in milk of working supplemented <b>cows</b> were 14 to 39 percent greater than non-working or working non-supplemented <b>cows</b> over two years. Milk yield of non-supplemented <b>cows,</b> whether working or not, was approximately half that of supplemented <b>cows.</b> Even though, over a period of two years, milk production of working <b>cows</b> was not significantly different from that of non-working <b>cows,</b> working non-supplemented <b>cows</b> had the lowest milk yield among all groups. This indicates that work with inadequate feeding would not be a feasible option for a production system involving the use of lactating <b>cows</b> for draft. On the other hand, total milk production of working supplemented <b>cows</b> over three years was only 10 percent lower than that of non-working supplemented <b>cows.</b> There was a dramatic decrease in percentage of <b>cows</b> showing oestrus and in conception rate when work was applied to non-supplemented <b>cows.</b> Once pregnancy was established there was no effect of work on maintenance of pregnancy.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the effects of bovine leukemia virus (BLV) infection on production, reproduction and longevity in dairy cattle. The study population was a commercial Holstein dairy herd of approximately 400 milking <b>cows.</b> Cattle were tested for antibodies to BLV at least annually for three years and when culled. Four groups of culled <b>cows</b> were compared: seronegative <b>cows</b> (n = 79), seropositive <b>cows</b> without lymphocytosis (n = 176), seropositive <b>cows</b> with lymphocytosis (> or = 9, 000 lymphocytes/microliter) (n = 74), and seropositive <b>cows</b> with lymphosarcoma (n = 29). Seropositive groups of <b>cows</b> were bred more times and had longer calving intervals than seronegative <b>cows.</b> The seropositive groups had greater 305 -day ME (mature equivalent) FCM (3. 5 % fat-corrected milk) per lactation and were older when culled than seronegative <b>cows.</b> However, the percent fat per lactation was greater in seronegative <b>cows.</b> In the last complete lactation, differences in 305 -day ME FCM, days open and cull age between groups were reduced and none were significant (p > 0. 05).

Blood samples were collected from 15 late pregnant <b>cows</b> and 15 early lactation <b>cows</b> to measure beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB), non-esterifi ed fatty acids (NEFA), triglycerides (TG), glucose, total protein (TP), albumin, total bilirubin, urea and the activity of aspartate transaminase (AST) and gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT). <b>Cows</b> in early lactation had signifi cantly higher (P 0. 4 mmol/L) was detected in 6 (40 %) of early lactation <b>cows</b> but in none of the late pregnant <b>cows,</b> while subclinical ketosis (BHB> 1. 2 mmol/L) was detected in 14 (94. 4 %) of the early lactation <b>cows</b> and 4 (26. 6 %) of the late pregnant <b>cows.</b> AST activities above 100 U/L were detected in 2 early lactation <b>cows</b> and in none of the late pregnant <b>cows.</b> TG levels below 0. 12 mmol/L and glucose below 2. 5 mmol/L were found in 7 (44 %) and 10 (66. 6 %) of the early lactation <b>cows,</b> respectively, and in none of the late pregnant <b>cows.</b> Early lactation <b>cows</b> {{were found to have}} lower blood serum levels of TG (P 0. 05) activities and higher concentrations of total bilirubin (P> 0. 05) T...|$|R
