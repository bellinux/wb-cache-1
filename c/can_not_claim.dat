These laws include some indications about technical information needed and outlines for procedures for storage application and permitting. However, many issues need a more precise description in guidelines and regulations that define the rules and tasks for industry and authorities alike. Thus, the German Federal Institute of Geosciences and Natural Resources started a discussion {{of some of the}} issues with mining authorities and industry that led to the proposal of some procedures, criteria catalogs and check lists, that may be used for site characterization, risk assessment and monitoring of storage sites. Background for these discussions was the European CCS directive and its technical Annexes. We <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>claim</b> general applicability for these documents, but we tried to be as comprehensive as possible, without getting lost in a consideration of all site-specific particularities.

40|$|The paper {{contains}} {{a review of}} policies towards national minorities in the Republic of Croatia in the past twenty years, {{with reference to the}} perspective of minority rights implementation. The topic has been analysed in relation to two independent variables – the influence of external factors, i. e. the international community, and internal political processes that have had influence on the realisation of national minority rights. Today, as a country and society on the eve of accession to the European Union, along with a legislatively developed and institutionally branched model of the implementation of national minority rights, we <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>claim</b> to have established permanent protection of their rights. The degree of national minority integration in society is the only true indicator of policy success in relation to national minorities.

The Croatian model has been set up in such a way, but {{the manner in which it}} functions will depend on the political will to implement it, the willingness of national minority members to be active subjects of social and political life, as well as on civil society and Croatian society as a whole...|$|E

Contrary to widely made implicit assumptions in constitutional theory and practice, national constitutional legitimacy is not self-standing. Whether a national constitution and the political practices authorized by it are legitimate does not depend only on the appropriate democratic quality and rights respecting nature of domestic legal practices. Instead, national constitutional legitimacy depends, in part, on how the national constitution is integrated into and relates to the wider legal and political world.
