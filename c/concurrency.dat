5|$|Across {{the county}} line in Middletown, the highway shifts towards the west. NY28 begins a <b>concurrency</b> with NY30 in Margaretville, with the routes {{paralleling}} the East Branch of the Delaware River. After crossing the Delaware River, the route ends its <b>concurrency</b> with NY30, and NY28 continues northwest through Andes as Main Street and Delaware Avenue. In {{the village of}} Delhi, the highway becomes known as Andes Road and has a short <b>concurrency</b> with NY10 in the village center. North of Delhi, it continues north towards the hamlet of Meredith, proceeding west past the hamlet. In Franklin, NY28 makes a 90-degree turn to the north at the intersection with {{the eastern end of}} NY357.|$|E
5|$|In {{some cases}} {{parallelism}} is transparent to the programmer, {{such as in}} bit-level or instruction-level parallelism, but explicitly parallel algorithms, particularly those that use <b>concurrency,</b> {{are more difficult to}} write than sequential ones, because <b>concurrency</b> introduces several new classes of potential software bugs, of which race conditions are the most common. Communication and synchronization between the different subtasks are typically some of the greatest obstacles to getting good parallel program performance.|$|E
5|$|K-3 is {{maintained}} by KDOT. In 2012, the {{traffic on the}} route, measured in annual average daily traffic, {{was found to be}} between 130 and 2060 vehicles per day. Most of the traffic was present on the <b>concurrency</b> with US-54. K-3's <b>concurrency</b> with US-54 is included in the National Highway System, a system of highways important to the nation's economy, defense, and mobility.|$|E

50|$|Mile markers reset at <b>concurrencies.</b>|$|R
50|$|Most <b>concurrencies</b> {{are simply}} a {{combination}} of two route numbers on the same physical road. This is often practically advantageous as well as economically advantageous; it may be better for two route numbers to be combined into one along riverways or through mountain valleys. Some nations allow for <b>concurrencies</b> to occur, however, some nations specifically do not allow it to happen. In those nations which do permit <b>concurrencies,</b> it can become very common. In these countries, {{there are a variety}} of concurrences which can occur.|$|R
5|$|SR 11 {{starts at}} Jennings Randolph Bridge, and becomes {{concurrent}} with US 30 and SR 39 {{as it turns}} southwest. The <b>concurrency</b> bends around East Liverpool, SR 39 leaves the <b>concurrency,</b> and SR 7 joins it. The route finally turns north and leaves East Liverpool. It turns northwest, near the southern terminus of SR 170. It intersects the <b>concurrency</b> termini of SR 7 and US 30 in these three miles. SR 11 travels through forests, passes by Lisbon, only connecting with SR 154 at an interchange. The highway travels north to near Leetonia, where it meets SR 344 at a diamond interchange. The forests slowly change into farmland, as it passes under SR 14 and into Mahoning County.|$|E
5|$|The Fulton Chain Lakes which NY28 {{has been}} {{following}} extend into Hamilton County. The highway soon reaches the settlement of Long Lake as it passes south of Raquette Lake. In the hamlet of Blue Mountain Lake, the route begins a wrong-way <b>concurrency</b> with NY30; the <b>concurrency</b> ends in the hamlet of Indian Lake. East of NY30, NY28 begins to shift towards the south.|$|E
5|$|A {{road from}} New Albany to north of Center Village first {{appeared}} on maps in 1924. In 1929, the road was extended to connect to Condit. SR 605 was designated in 1937, following the alignment from US 62, to a junction with the US 36/SR 3 <b>concurrency</b> in Condit. By 1994, jurisdiction of the portion of SR 605 between SR 37 and the US 36/SR 3 <b>concurrency</b> was transferred from the Ohio Department of Transportation (ODOT) to Delaware County, who renamed the road to County Road 605. As {{a result of this}} move, SR 605 took on the routing that it does today.|$|E
50|$|Other <b>concurrencies</b> of a {{tangential}} quadrilateral are given here.|$|R
50|$|<b>Concurrencies</b> include US 98 in Pensacola, US 331 in DeFuniak Springs, US 221 in Greenville, US 301 in Baldwin, and US 1 in Jacksonville. Lesser <b>concurrencies</b> {{with state}} and county roads also exist {{in various parts of}} the state. The segment between US 319 in Tallahassee and US 441 in Lake City also {{includes}} part of the DeSoto Trail.|$|R
50|$|Several {{states do}} not officially have any <b>concurrencies,</b> instead officially ending routes {{on each side of}} one. There are several {{circumstances}} where unusual <b>concurrencies</b> exist along state borders. One example occurs along the Oklahoma-Arkansas state line. At the northern end of this border Oklahoma State Highway 20 runs concurrently with Arkansas Highway 43 and the two roads run north-south along the boundary.|$|R
5|$|At Broadway (NY17K), Newburgh's main street, NY32 turns east. The brief, {{unsigned}} <b>concurrency</b> ends where 17K terminates at US9W (Robinson Avenue), at {{the former}} Broadway School. NY32, however, turns north again, beginning {{the first of several}} concurrencies with US9W.|$|E
5|$|By 1947, M-99 was {{completely}} paved. One segment between Litchfield and Homer was converted back to gravel surface in 1952; {{a change that}} was reverted two years later. By 1960, the former US12/M-99 <b>concurrency</b> through Albion was redesignated Business US12 through the city when the I-94/US12 freeway was completed. Within a year, that business loop was redesignated BL I-94 when the US12 designation {{was removed from the}} freeway and applied to the former US112; at the same time, the US112/M-99 <b>concurrency</b> in Jonesville became US12/M-99 as well.|$|E
5|$|Continuing northward, NY270 {{enters the}} town of Cambria, where it intersects with NY31 (Saunders Settlement Road) and NY93 (Junction Road). This {{intersection}} serves as the western terminus of the NY31/NY93 <b>concurrency</b> and the northern terminus of NY270.|$|E
25|$|Lengthy route <b>concurrencies</b> were {{eliminated}} in the renumbering, {{and the western}} terminus was now a junction with US165 only.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} Kentucky Route 90 Truck accompanies US 68 Truck {{through its}} <b>concurrencies</b> with US 31E and the Cumberland Parkway.|$|R
50|$|<b>Concurrencies</b> include US 98 between Fort Meade and Bartow, and a notably {{long one}} with US 92 between Lake Alfred and {{northern}} DeLand, which itself includes <b>concurrencies</b> with US 192 in Kissimmee, US 441 between Kissimmee and Orlando, SR 50 in Orlando, and SR 46 in Sanford. Others include SR 20/SR 100 between San Mateo and Palatka, and Interstate 10 (I-10), I-95, US 23, and US 1 in Downtown Jacksonville in that order.|$|R
5|$|Here, {{the road}} heads through {{residential}} areas with some commercial establishments, crossing County Route 610 {{in the center}} of town. As the road continues north, it heads through a mix of homes and farmland with a few commercial areas. Route 47 enters inhabited areas again as it crosses into Glassboro. The road continues north and enters business areas before heading into neighborhoods and coming to an intersection with High Street, which runs east as U.S. Route 322/County Route 536 and west as County Route 641. Here, U.S. Route 322 and County Route 536 join Route 47 for a <b>concurrency.</b> The three routes head through commercial areas before U.S. Route 322 and County Route 536 turn to the west on West Avenue. Past this intersection, Route 47 continues north as a three-lane road with a center left-turn lane, passing more buildings. The route intersects County Route 553 and forms a <b>concurrency</b> with that route which lasts until County Route 553 turns north onto Woodbury Avenue. Along this <b>concurrency,</b> the road widens to five lanes as it passes a couple shopping centers. Past the <b>concurrency,</b> Route 47 runs north through suburban localities as a two-lane road, entering Washington Township at the crossing of Kressey Lake. In Washington Township, the road passes more populated areas as well as businesses. Route 47 runs to the east of Bethel Mill County Park before entering more residential areas, crossing County Route 635. The road passes through a mix of homes and commercial establishments with some farmland and wooded areas as it continues through more of Washington Township.|$|E
5|$|In German Flatts, NY28 becomes Columbia Street and intersects the {{northern}} terminus of NY168. In Mohawk, NY28 intersects NY5S. After crossing the Mohawk River, NY28 becomes Mohawk Street and meets I-90 (New York State Thruway) at exit30. In {{the village of}} Herkimer, NY28 has a <b>concurrency</b> with NY5. North of NY5, NY28 begins to parallel the West Canada Creek. In Middleville, it intersects the western terminus of NY29 and {{the northern}} terminus of NY169. The highway executes a 90-degree turn at the three-route junction. NY28 continues towards the north paralleling the West Canada Creek. In Poland, NY28 begins a <b>concurrency</b> with NY8.|$|E
5|$|K-3 first {{appears on}} the 1932 state highway map. At that time, the route was almost {{completely}} gravel; only the <b>concurrency</b> with US-54 was paved. By 1950, the portion of K-3 in Crawford County had been paved. The portion of the route from the CrawfordBourbon county line to {{the west end of}} the <b>concurrency</b> with K-39 was paved in 1953, and the remainder of the road was paved by 1958. No significant changes have been made to the route since then.|$|E
50|$|State Road 28 has <b>concurrencies</b> {{with four}} U.S. routes, {{as well as}} four other Indiana state roads; these are {{described}} below.|$|R
50|$|<b>Concurrencies</b> {{were highly}} discouraged; this {{included}} U.S. Routes and meant that U.S. Route numbers {{would now be}} referred to directly by NJDOT.|$|R
50|$|IL 111 has <b>concurrencies</b> with IL 3 in Alton, U.S. Route 67 (US 67) in Godfrey, and IL 267 from Godfrey to Medora.|$|R
5|$|M-123 {{is a state}} {{trunkline}} {{highway in}} the eastern Upper Peninsula of the U.S. state of Michigan. It {{is one of only}} a few highways in Michigan that curve around and form a U-shape. In fact, M-123 has three intersections with only two state trunklines; it meets M-28 twice {{as a result of its}} U-shaped routing. M-123 also has a rare signed <b>concurrency</b> with a County-Designated Highway in Michigan; in Trout Lake, there is a <b>concurrency</b> with H-40. All of M-123 north of M-28 is a Scenic Heritage Route within the Michigan Heritage Route system.|$|E
5|$|On April1, 1970, the {{southern}} end of the highway was rerouted. The section along Guelph Line was decommissioned and the <b>concurrency</b> with Highway5 was removed. A new direct routing south to the QEW along Bronte Road was established.|$|E
5|$|SH-58 {{continues}} north, meeting US-60 again near Ringwood. It {{then has}} a brief <b>concurrency</b> with State Highway 45 near Helena. Near Jet, it overlaps U.S. Highway 64 and SH-8. North of Cherokee, the Alfalfa County seat, US-64 splits off and State Highway 11 joins the three-route <b>concurrency.</b> North of Driftwood, SH-58 splits off {{on its own}} and passes through Byron and Amorita. It terminates at the Kansas state line, where it becomes a county road.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Concurrencies</b> {{involved}} in this route includes US 70 (SR 1) in Pegram, SR 49 through Ashland City, and SR 12 in downtown Ashland City.|$|R
50|$|In Sweden and Denmark, {{the most}} {{important}} highways use only the European route numbers, which have cardinal directions. In Sweden the E6 and E20 run concurrently for 280 km. In Denmark the E47 and E55 run concurrently for 157 km. There are more shorter <b>concurrencies.</b> There are two stretches in Sweden and Denmark where three European routes run concurrently; these are E6, E20 and E22 in Sweden, and E20, E47 and E55 in Denmark. Along all these <b>concurrencies,</b> all route numbers are signposted.|$|R
50|$|Despite {{its length}} it has {{comparatively}} few <b>concurrencies</b> with any Interstate highways, and those segments are short. In no place {{has it been}} decommissioned as a route.|$|R
5|$|A year later, on May27, 1931, {{the highway}} was {{extended}} north from Woodstock to Shakespeare. As {{a result of}} this, a <b>concurrency</b> with Highway2 was created between Ingersoll and Woodstock. Several months later, on July1, the department assumed {{the remainder of the}} Ingersoll to Port Burwell Road, extending Highway19 south of Tillsonburg.|$|E
5|$|As of 2012, {{the highest}} average annual daily traffic (AADT) count along SH-108 was 5,900, {{measured}} along the <b>concurrency</b> with SH-51. The highest traffic volume on SH-108 alone was an AADT of 1,900, measured north of SH-51. The lowest AADT measured was 1,500, which occurred both in Glencoe {{and south of}} Ripley. No part of SH-108 has been designated {{as part of the}} National Highway System.|$|E
5|$|DE4 has {{an annual}} {{average daily traffic}} count ranging {{from a high of}} 53,936vehicles at the west end of the DE 7 <b>concurrency</b> to a low of 12,033vehicles at the I-95/US 202 interchange. The entire length of DE4 is part of the National Highway System.|$|E
50|$|The South Dakota {{section of}} U.S. 281, with the {{exception}} of <b>concurrencies</b> with U.S. 18 and U.S. 14, is defined at South Dakota Codified Laws § 31-4-229.|$|R
50|$|<b>Concurrencies</b> are {{assigned}} a number {{equal to the}} smaller number of the concurrent routes, or the highest type (Quadrant Route → PA Route → U.S. Route → Interstate).|$|R
50|$|New Hampshire also signs {{nearly all}} route <b>concurrencies</b> {{in the same}} way. However, as signs are being {{replaced}}, they are now more often replaced with traditional sign assemblies.|$|R
