5|$|Accusing the Song {{of violating}} the {{agreement}} and realizing {{the weakness of the}} Song, the Jin generals launched a second punitive campaign, again dividing their troops into two armies. Wanyan Zonghan, who had withdrawn from Taiyuan after the Kaifeng agreement and left a small force in charge of the siege, came back with his western army. Overwhelmed, Taiyuan fell in September 1126, after 260 days of siege. When the Song court received news of the fall of Taiyuan, the officials who had advocated defending the empire militarily fell from favor again and were replaced by <b>counselors</b> <b>who</b> favored appeasement. In mid December the two Jurchen armies converged on Kaifeng for the second time that year.|$|E

2500|$|The American Counseling Association {{has stated}} {{that they do not}} condone any {{training}} to educate and prepare a counselor to practice conversion therapy. <b>Counselors</b> <b>who</b> do offer training in conversion therapy must inform students that the techniques are unproven.

However, [...] "it is of primary importance to respect a client's autonomy to request a referral for a service not offered by a counselor".
