40|$|BACKGROUND: In {{patients}} with {{non-small cell lung cancer}} (NSCLC), approximately 25 % have locally advanced disease. For {{patients with}} irresectable (N 2 - 3 or T 4) or inoperable disease, treatment consists of chemoradiotherapy. <b>Concomitant</b> <b>chemoradiotherapy</b> improves survival compared to sequential chemoradiotherapy in these patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Treatment plans and completion of treatment was evaluated for all patients treated at the St. Antonius Hospital from 2008 - 2011 for NSCLC stage IIIA/B {{not eligible for}} surgery. RESULTS: Between 2008 and 2011, 180 patients with NSCLC stage III were treated at our hospital. A total of 152 patients were not eligible for surgery; in 78 (51 %) patients, primary treatment was chemoradiotherapy; 31 (20 %) were planned for concomitant treatment. The most frequent reasons for refraining from <b>concomitant</b> <b>chemoradiotherapy</b> were limitations of radiotherapy constraints and condition of the patients (87 %). CONCLUSION: Although <b>concomitant</b> <b>chemoradiotherapy</b> is the standard-of-care in patients with stage IIIA/B NSCLC ineligible for surgery, the majority (80 %) of the patients were treated otherwise...|$|E
40|$|Enhancing the {{therapeutic}} index of <b>concomitant</b> <b>chemoradiotherapy</b> for {{head and neck}} cancer Recent studies and meta-analyses have conclusively documented an increase in locoregional control and overall survival rates in patients with advanced head and neck cancer treated with concomitant chemoradio-therapy [1 - 7].

However, <b>concomitant</b> <b>chemoradiotherapy</b> {{has also been shown}} to result in increased toxicity. In particular, acute muco-sitis, myelosuppression and nephrotoxicity (when cispla-tin is included in the regimen) are frequently increased [5 - 13].

40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: This study {{evaluated}} {{the use of}} total lesion glycolysis (TLG) determined by different automatic segmentation algorithms, for early response monitoring in {{non-small cell lung cancer}} (NSCLC) patients during <b>concomitant</b> <b>chemoradiotherapy.</b> MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-seven patients with locally advanced NSCLC treated with <b>concomitant</b> <b>chemoradiotherapy</b> underwent 18 F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET/CT imaging before and in the second week of treatment. Segmentation of the primary tumours and lymph nodes was performed using fixed threshold segmentation at (i) 40 % SUVmax (T 40), (ii) 50 % SUVmax (T 50), (iii) relative-threshold-level (RTL), (iv) signal-to-background ratio (SBR), and (v) fuzzy locally adaptive Bayesian (FLAB) segmentation. Association of primary tumour TLG (TLGT), lymph node TLG (TLGLN), summed TLG (TLGS=TLGT+TLGLN), and relative TLG decrease (DeltaTLG) with overall-survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) was determined using univariate Cox regression models. RESULTS: Pretreatment TLGT was predictive for PFS and OS, irrespective of the segmentation method used. Inclusion of TLGLN improved disease and early response assessment, with pretreatment TLGS more strongly associated with PFS and OS than TLGT for all segmentation algorithms. This was also the case for DeltaTLGS, which was significantly associated with PFS and OS, with the exception of RTL and T 40. CONCLUSIONS: DeltaTLGS was significantly associated with PFS and OS, except for RTL and T 40. Inclusion of TLGLN improves early treatment response monitoring during <b>concomitant</b> <b>chemoradiotherapy</b> with FDG-PET...|$|E

40|$|Full list {{of author}} {{information}} {{is available at the}} end of the articleGlioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most common and lethal type of primary central nervous system neoplasm in adults [1]. Unlike most other tumors that metastasize to distant organs, malignant glioma very rarely metastasizes outside the central nervous system. In this sense, GBM may be regarded as a “local ” tumor [2]. In GBM, standard treatment involves maximal resection followed by <b>concomitant</b> and adjuvant <b>chemoradiotherapy</b> with temozolomide. Even with this with this malignancy remain very poor. Thus, in order to improve the current therapeutic regimens, it is important to explore effective new modalities for GBM patients. Radioactive 125 I seed implantation has been widely applied in the treatment of cancers [3 - 6]. It has been shown to be an effective adjuvant therapy in recurrent GBM [7, 8] and Low-grade (WHO grades I and II) gliomas (LGGs) [9, 10]. Furthermore, several studies have shown that 125 I seed irradiation directly causes more cell death by comparing with 60 CO-γ or X-ray irradiation [11 - 14]. However, few studies of the biological effects of 125 I seed irradiation on GBM cells are available. Epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a ke...|$|R

In glioblastoma, the most malignant intrinsic brain tumor entity in adults, the promoter methylation {{status of the}} gene encoding for the repair enzyme O 6 -methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) indicates increased efficacy of current standard of care, which is <b>concomitant</b> and adjuvant <b>chemoradiotherapy</b> with the alkylating agent temozolomide. In the elderly, MGMT promoter methylation status has recently been introduced to be a predictive biomarker {{that can be used}} for stratification of treatment regimes. This review gives a short summery of epidemiological, clinical, diagnostic, and treatment aspects of patients who are currently diagnosed with glioblastoma. The most important molecular genetic markers and epigenetic alterations in glioblastoma are summarized. Special focus is given to the physiological function of DNA methylation – in particular, of the MGMT gene promoter, its clinical relevance, technical aspects of status assessment, its correlation with MGMT mRNA and protein expressions, and its place within the management cascade of glioblastoma patients.

40|$|Glioma {{has been}} {{considered}} resistant to chemotherapy and radiation. Recently, <b>concomitant</b> and adjuvant <b>chemoradiotherapy</b> with temozolomide has become the standard treatment for newly diagnosed glioblastoma. Conversely (neo-) adjuvant PCV (procarbazine, lomustine, vincristine) failed to improve survival in the more chemoresponsive tumor entities of anaplastic oligoastrocytoma and oligodendroglioma. Preclinical investigations suggest synergism or additivity of radiotherapy and temozolomide in glioma cell lines. Although the relative contribution of the concomitant and the adjuvant chemotherapy, respectively, cannot be assessed, the early introduction of chemotherapy and the simultaneous administration with radiotherapy appear to be key {{for the improvement of}} outcome. Epigenetic inactivation of the DNA repair enzyme methylguanine methyltransferase (MGMT) seems to be the strongest predictive marker for outcome in patients treated with alkylating agent chemotherapy. Patients whose tumors do not have MGMT promoter methylation are less likely to benefit from the addition of temozolomide chemotherapy and require alternative treatment strategies. The predictive value of MGMT gene promoter methylation is being validated in ongoing trials aiming at overcoming this resistance by a dose-dense continuous temozolomide administration or in combination with MGMT inhibitors. Understanding of molecular mechanisms allows for rational targeting of specific pathways of repair, signaling, and angiogenesis. The addition of tyrosine kinase inhibitors vatalanib (PTK 787) and vandetinib (ZD 6474), the integrin inhibitor cilengitide, the monoclonal antibodies bevacizumab and cetuximab, the mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitors temsirolimus and everolimus, and the protein kinase C inhibitor enzastaurin, among other agents, are in clinical investigation, building on the established chemoradiotherapy regimen for newly diagnosed glioblastoma...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVES: Adjuvant <b>concomitant</b> <b>chemoradiotherapy</b> {{has been}} used at our clinic since February 2000 in the {{patients}} with gastric carcinoma. METHODS: Thirty-one gastric carcinoma patients (7 females, 24 males; median age 56 years; range 24 to 77 years) have been evaluated between March 2000 -August 2003. The most frequent symptom was dispepsy (42 %); and the most frequent tumour localisations were cardia, antrum and small curvature as an equal rates (29 %). Operation types were total gastrectomy+lymph node dissection (LND) +splenectomy (29 %), distal subtotal gastrectomy+LND (36 %), and total gastrectomy+LND (29 %). The most frequent histopathological type was adenocarcinoma (58 %). Median 21 (0 - 71) LND removed, and median metastatic lymph node was 5 (0 - 49). AJCC 1997 staging system was used for clinical staging, and the dispertion: stage II 9 (29 %), IIIA 10 (33 %), IIIB 5 (16 %), stage IV 7 (22 %) patients. Total 45 Gy radiotherapy (1. 8 Gy/ fraction, 25 fraction) was delivered to the tumour and regional nodes. All patients have been treated with two opposed fields (anteroposterior/ posteroanterior) and with individual blocs. <b>Concomitant</b> <b>chemoradiotherapy</b> was administered as an intravenous continous infusion (225 mg/m 2 /day 5 -Fluorourasil (5 -FU)) {{has been given to}} 20 (65 %) patients. RESULTS: Median follow up was 19 (4 - 50) months. All of the living patients were under follow up except one. Early side effects were classified as to RTOG, and late toxicity was evaluated according to EORTC / RTOG toxicity criteria. Six patients in only RT group (n= 11), and 12 patients in <b>concomitant</b> <b>chemoradiotherapy</b> group (n= 20) had grade I early gastrointestinal symptoms (nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea).

METHODS: For 28 patients, (18) F-FDG PET was performed before treatment, {{at the end of the}} second week of treatment, and at 2 wk and 3 mo after the completion of treatment. Standardized uptake value (SUV), maximum SUV, metabolic tumor volume (MTV), and total lesion glycolysis (TLG) were obtained. Early metabolic changes were defined as fractional change (DeltaTLG) when (18) F-FDG PET at the end of the second week was compared with pretreatment (18) F-FDG PET. In-treatment metabolic changes, as measured by serial (18) F-FDG PET, were correlated with standard criteria of response evaluation of solid tumors by means of CT imaging (Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors 1. 1). Parameters were analyzed for stratification in progression-free survival (PFS). RESULTS: When compared with early metabolic nonresponders, a DeltaTLG decrease of 38 % or more was associated with a significantly longer PFS (1 -y PFS 80 % vs. 36 %, P = 0. 02).

40|$|Squamous cell {{carcinoma}} {{of the head and}} neck (SCCHN) is a common disease that develops in the upper aerodigestive epithelium. The most important risk factors are tobacco and alcohol consumption. There is also increasing evidence that human papillomavirus plays an important role in the cause of SCCHN. The complex anatomy, the vital functions of the upper aerodigestive tract and the close proximity to vital structures, explain that the goal of treatment is not only to improve survival outcomes, but also to preserve organ function. Radiotherapy and surgery are the standard modalities of treatment, reflecting the locoregional predominance of SCCHN. Chemotherapy plays an important role in the treatment of patients with locoregionally advanced disease, in conjunction with radiotherapy and surgery. Indeed, standard therapy for resectable locoregionally advanced (stage III or IV) SCCHN cancers consists either of surgery and adjuvant chemoradiotherapy or definitive <b>concomitant</b> <b>chemoradiotherapy,</b> depending upon disease site, stage and resectability of the tumour, or institutional experience. <b>Concomitant</b> <b>chemoradiotherapy</b> has been shown in several randomised trials to improve disease-free and overall survival in the postoperative setting for resected disease with poor prognostic factors. Furthermore, multiple randomised studies and meta-analyses have shown that definitive chemoradiotherapy, as well anti-epidermal growth factor receptor treatment in one randomised study, improved disease-free and overall survival when compared with radiotherapy alone. This overview reviews the most relevant published studies on the multidisciplinary management of SCCHN and discusses future strategies to reduce locoregional failures...|$|E
40|$|Clear cell {{adenocarcinoma}} (CCAC) of the uterine cervix {{is a rare}} {{variant of}} cervical adenocarcinoma accounting for approximately 4 - 9 % of this disease. Given the rarity of this pathological entity, the optimal treatment management {{is far from being}} defined. Earlier evidence suggested that the prognosis of patients bearing cervical CCAC is worse than with other histotypes, thus making the investigation of multimodal treatment strategies clinically worthwhile. Herein, we report the first case of locally advanced, large size cervical CCAC in a young woman who was triaged to <b>concomitant</b> <b>chemoradiotherapy</b> followed by radical surgery and experienced a pathologically assessed optimal response to this multimodal approac...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background To {{establish}} recurrence patterns among locally advanced {{head and}} neck non-nasopharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) patients treated with radical (chemo-) radiotherapy and to correlate the sites of loco-regional recurrence with radiotherapy doses and target volumes Method 151 locally advanced HNSCC patients were treated between 2004 - 2005 using radical three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy. Patients with prior surgery to the primary tumour site were excluded. The sites of locoregional relapses were correlated with radiotherapy plans by the radiologist and a planning dosimetrist. Results Median age was 59 years (range: 34 - 89). 35 patients had stage III disease, 116 patients had stage IV A/B. 36 patients were treated with radiotherapy alone, 42 with induction chemotherapy, 63 with induction and <b>concomitant</b> <b>chemoradiotherapy</b> and 10 <b>concomitant</b> <b>chemoradiotherapy.</b> Median follow-up was 38 months (range 3 - 62). 3 -year cause specific survival was 66. 8 %. 125 of 151 (82. 8 %) achieved a complete response to treatment. Amongst these 125 there were 20 local-regional recurrence, comprising 8 local, 5 regional and 7 simultaneous local and regional; synchronous distant metastases occurred in 7 of the 20. 9 patients developed distant metastases {{in the absence of}} locoregional failure. For the 14 local recurrences with planning data available, 12 were in-field, 1 was marginal, and 1 was out-of-field. Of the 11 regional failures with planning data available, 7 were in-field, 1 was marginal and 3 were out-of-field recurrences. Conclusion The majority of failures following non-surgical treatment for locally advanced HNSCC were loco-regional, within the radiotherapy target volume. Improving locoregional control remains a high priority. </p...|$|E

40|$|PURPOSE: Glioblastomas {{are notorious}} for {{resistance}} to therapy, which {{has been attributed to}} DNA-repair proficiency, a multitude of deregulated molecular pathways, and, more recently, to the particular biologic behavior of tumor stem-like cells. Here, we aimed to identify molecular profiles specific for treatment resistance to the current standard of care of <b>concomitant</b> <b>chemoradiotherapy</b> with the alkylating agent temozolomide. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Gene expression profiles of 80 glioblastomas were interrogated for associations with resistance to therapy. Patients were treated within clinical trials testing the addition of concomitant and adjuvant temozolomide to radiotherapy. RESULTS: An expression signature dominated by HOX genes, which comprises Prominin- 1 (CD 133), emerged as a predictor for poor survival in patients treated with <b>concomitant</b> <b>chemoradiotherapy</b> (n = 42; hazard ratio = 2. 69; 95 % CI, 1. 38 to 5. 26; P =. 004). This association could be validated in an independent data set. Provocatively, the HOX cluster was reminiscent of a "self-renewal" signature (P =. 008; Gene Set Enrichment Analysis) recently characterized in a mouse leukemia model. The HOX signature and EGFR expression were independent prognostic factors in multivariate analysis, adjusted for the O- 6 -methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) methylation status, a known predictive factor for benefit from temozolomide, and age. Better outcome was associated with gene clusters characterizing features of tumor-host interaction including tumor vascularization and cell adhesion, and innate immune response. CONCLUSION: This study provides first clinical evidence for the implication of a "glioma stem cell" or "self-renewal" phenotype in treatment resistance of glioblastoma. Biologic mechanisms identified here to be relevant for resistance will guide future targeted therapies and respective marker development for individualized treatment and patient selection...|$|E

40|$|Aims: To {{report the}} outcome with {{radiotherapy}} and <b>concomitant</b> <b>chemoradiotherapy</b> {{in patients with}} locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma base of tongue treated and followed up at single institution {{over a period of}} 15 years. Materials and Methods: This study was carried out by auditing the medical records of 103 patients treated at our institution between 1991 and 2006. Mean age with standard deviation of patients in the Radiotherapy only (group I) and chemoradiotherapy (group II) was 55. 26 ± 14. 16 and 49. 81 ± 12. 16 years. 46 patients were treated with radiotherapy alone and 57 patients were treated with concurrent chemo radiotherapy using infusion cisplatinum 3 weekly and 5 fluorouracil twice weekly. Mean follow up was 13. 35 months. All the patients characteristic and treatment characteristics were recorded. Results: There were 81 men and 22 women in the study. Group I contains 15 and 31 cases of stage III and IV tumors while group II contains 19 and 38 cases of stage III and IV respectively. Group II has shown improved loco regional control rate for the T 3 and T 4 tumors as compared to group I. Disease free survival and overall survival in the group II is 25. 51 months and 22. 53 months while group I has 8. 67 months and 6. 74 months respectively. Grade III mucosal toxicity incidence was higher in group II as compared to group I. Conclusions: In locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of base of tongue tumors <b>concomitant</b> <b>chemoradiotherapy</b> with infusional cisplatinum and 5 fluorouracil results in higher disease free and overall survival as compared to radiotherapy as single modality. This better tumor response with chemoradiotherapy comes at cost of higher incidence of mucosal toxicity...|$|E
