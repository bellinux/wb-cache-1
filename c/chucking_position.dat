5000|$|Later, General Beckman {{introduces}} Shaw as {{an expert}} on the Ring, and places Shaw in command of Operation Bartowski, having been briefed on the team and <b>Chuck's</b> <b>position</b> as the Intersect. When Chuck lures Sydney, the Ring operative after Devon, to the Buy More, Shaw insists on Chuck dealing with his own problems but is ultimately forced down by Casey. He returns to kill Sydney and save Chuck. He is later seen observing the dinner of most of the main characters and pulls out a ring, hinting him to be, or have been, married. In [...] "Chuck Versus First Class", Shaw tells Sarah that he was once married to a fellow spy, Evelyn (later played by Kelly Thiebaud), but that she was killed by a Ring agent five years before.|$|R

30|$|In {{the present}} study, we {{calculated}} {{the value of}} CFS to distinguish between floating/sinking pulses. We found that four subjects who were categorized as overweight based on BMI exhibited different floating/sinking pulse patterns, while the remaining normal weight subjects exhibited the same pattern. Therefore, the thicker subcutaneous tissue layer of overweight subjects exerts an influence on pulse wave measurement. On closer examination, the existing method indicated that these four subjects had a sinking pulse, whereas the proposed method showed a floating pulse. This difference may have occurred when the hold-down pressure {{was strong enough to}} perceive pulse signal at a deep level. Although a new CFS value was calculated in the present study, it was not used to distinguish between floating/sinking pulses, as this distinction can only be defined when all pulse waves on Chon, Kwan, and <b>Chuck</b> <b>position</b> are measured (we measured the pulse wave only on Kwan). Nevertheless, we determined that the correlation coefficient between CFS values for the two different methods was 0.505, indicating that they were not significantly correlated.|$|R
40|$|The {{corrugated}} cardboard {{is widely used}} in manufacturing industries as a packaging and transportation material. Faculty of {{corrugated cardboard}} is depended on the fragility, weight, thickness, toughness and so on. The strength of corrugated cardboard changed with the fabrication process, used atmosphere and variety of loading patterns. On the machining process of corrugated cardboard box, the cutting and ruling technology is very important factor. The effects of these factors {{on the strength of}} corrugated cardboard have not yet enough been identified. In general, the corrugated cardboard was composed with three layer of paperboard. One is outside liner and inside liner and the other is corrugated medium. The top of corrugated medium is bonded with glue on outside or inside layer surface. The bonded space was decided by company standard. The evolutional method of bonding strength had not been established. The development of new simple method has been needed. In this research, to establish the evaluation method of strength of corrugated cardboard material, new practical tensile test and shear test, considering the glue bonding strength, was proposed and the factory of these test method was investigated. In current studies, it was too hard to evaluate the reproductive tensile and shear strength of corrugated cardboard, because of fabrication method of the cut specimen and the deformation of <b>chuck</b> <b>position.</b> On the shear test, as the direction of parallel chuck changed during loading process, the specimen was rotated. In this research, the new developed method of tensile and shear was accomplished, the reproduced strength could be obtained. The fatigue test was tried on the shear test to investigate the effect of thickness of specimen...|$|R

50|$|The episode {{begins as}} Chuck and Casey quit the Buy More. At Castle, Beckman offers <b>Chuck</b> a <b>position</b> {{as an analyst}} on the ongoing Intersect project, which Chuck declines. Beckman informs Casey that he can rejoin his Special Forces unit, but asks Sarah to stay behind a moment. Upstairs, Chuck {{receives}} an extremely large sum of money from the government {{in exchange for the}} work he did for them. Casey gives Chuck his personal number if he ever needs anything, {{and for the first time}} tells Chuck he's done a good job after the two share an awkward hug. Back down in Castle, Beckman reassigns Sarah to the Intersect project alongside Bryce Larkin, who is now at Castle. They are due to head to Zurich the next morning.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. When {{turning and}} {{grinding}} the long axis with cone thin-walled, they are clamped to be deformation easily and positioned difficultly. Based {{on the existing}} theory of clamping with the conical sleeve, we design {{a new type of}} fixture in this paper. The outer cone of the fixture cling to the inner cone of the workpiece, it is sealed hermetically at the both ends. The head of the sleeve stretch out of a cylindrical boss, we can use the three-jaw <b>chuck</b> to <b>position</b> it on the machine tool. Also we use the steady rest to fix the end of the sleeve. The steady rest connect with the shell of a rotary joint. The end of the rotary joint screw with the sleeve, the other end of it is connected with a getter pump. It formatted a vacuum between the sleeve and the workpiece by the use of holes around the circumference of the sleeve. The utility model to the fixture used for thin wall conical parts with long shaft...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. There {{are many}} machines, devices and {{production}} lines that {{are equipped with}} rotating elements (shafts, axes, spindles, trailing and drive wheels, etc.). Correct geometry of these elements ensures trouble-free operation, and, {{in the case of}} machine tools it decides about the correct geometric parameters of the manufactured semi-finished articles and pro-ducts. In this respect, the newly manufactured and operated lathes are checked against the cor-rect geometry of their parts which determine the location of the work-piece and the lathe and their movement These parts are geometrically correct if the errors of their geometrical shape (deviations) do not exceed values designated in the standards. The wearing of lathes reveals the so-called spindle run-out (deviation from circularity). These deviations are determined using mainly the workshop methods. However, due to the considerable sizes of machine tools surveying methods and new methods which use elec-tronic and optoelectronic devices also apply. Authors of this work present the measuring set (which they designed and built themselves) which relies on the two-point fibre signalling device which is installed in the lathe spindle <b>chuck</b> jaws. The <b>position</b> of the signalling device during the lathe spindle rotation is recorded with CCD/CMOS digital camera, and the images are stored on the camera memory card. The aim of the presented research and experimental works was to determine the internal conformity of measurement results that were obtained using the designed and constructed measuring set, to check whether there is a correlation between the results obtained using the dial indicator and to analyse the accuracy of observations that were made using the test set. The designed measuring set enables to determine deviations from circularity during the lathe spindle rotation with the accuracy of ± 0. 02 mm.

40|$|Exhibited in the Library East Commons Exhibition Gallery spring {{semester}} 2009. Resulted from Professor Allison Whitney's poster assignment for ENGL 1102 - English Composition II - Science Fiction – Image, Sound, Text, an undergraduate course {{offered in the}} School of Literature, Communication and Culture (LCC). My poster for "The Right Stuff" highlights some of the films elements which are not present in the original movie poster. I used graphics software to edit and combine various images to create my poster. The background of the poster is a sky gradient. The primary visual element on the poster is {{a photo of a}} Mercury-Atlas rocket from an upward looking angle. Apart from the title and tagline, the poster contains two other visual elements, which are a drawing of the seven astronauts faces and a photo of Chuck Yeager in front of Glamorous Glennis, the X- 1 he used to break the sound barrier. My intention with the poster was to draw some attention to the rockets and the theme of transitioning to the future. The image of the Atlas rocket is placed at the lower left corner of the poster and extends diagonally up and to the right. I applied a motion blur to the image to give it an effect of speed and motion. These physical experiences are present in the film in many scenes and the motion blur conveys this experience to the viewer. Though the "right stuff" refers to the skills of the astronauts {{it is important to recognize}} the "right stuff" possessed by the thousands of engineers and scientists who contributed to the developments of the space program. The inclusion of the photo of the rocket is also intended to show the importance of the hardware used by the astronauts. The images of Chuck Yeager and the astronauts are meant to complement the films tagline, "How the future began. " The photograph of <b>Chuck</b> Yeager is <b>positioned</b> at the bottom right of the poster, and the lines of the rocket lead the viewers attention from Chuck Yeager up to the astronauts. This is meant to be symbolic of the transition from the veteran pilot to the hot shot astronauts. Additionally, the astronauts appear to be looking off into space, which can be interpreted as looking into the unknown future for whatever developments may occur. The title is printed in red and has a blue stroke to encompass the patriotic elements of the movie. The font I selected is futuristic looking and meant to represent the futuristic nature of the space program to the viewer. The font also gives a sense of speed and motion which contributes to showing the theme of the future and its developments. Below the title is the tagline, which is also written in a futuristic looking font. Through my poster I wanted to draw attention to the theme of transitioning to the future. This is the tagline of the movie, but the original poster did nothing to support the tagline. Through the composition and selection of visual elements on my poster I represented this experience to the viewer...|$|R
