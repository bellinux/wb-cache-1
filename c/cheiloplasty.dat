5000|$|<b>Cheiloplasty</b> or lip {{reduction}} (from χείλος kheilos - [...] "lip") is {{the technical}} term for surgery of the lip. It includes lip reduction, {{the process of}} surgically reducing {{the size of the}} lip or lips {{in order to reduce the}} appearance of abnormally large or protruding lips, as well as the process of forming an artificial tip or part of the lips by using a piece of healthy tissue from some neighboring part. The procedure can also be performed to enhance the upper and lower lip for those who wish to make their lips permanently larger.|$|E

40|$|Background:. In {{bilateral}} {{cleft lip}} and palate (BCLP) patients with protrusion and/or torsion of the premaxillae, {{it is difficult}} to achieve a good outcome. We have developed a series of procedures of premaxillary osteotomy with primary <b>cheiloplasty</b> for BCLP patients who did not respond well to presurgical orthodontics (PSO). Methods:. A total of 27 BCLP patients with protrusion and/or torsion of the premaxillae underwent PSO. For 3 BCLP patients in whom the protruded premaxillae could not be returned to a good position, a primary premaxillary osteotomy and gingivoperiosteoplasty (GPP) with <b>cheiloplasty</b> were performed simultaneously. Subsequently, Furlow palatoplasty was performed by one {{and a half years of}} age. Maxillary growth was evaluated by dental occlusion at 4 years of age. Results:. A premaxillary osteotomy and GPP with <b>cheiloplasty</b> were performed at 6 months. The patients’ facial structures improved, their premaxillae were positioned more superiorly, and normal inclination of the incisors was achieved. They had edge-to-edge occlusions or cross bites at 4 years of age. Conclusions:. As advantages, the patients’ facial structures improved, and the alveolar bones were formed by GPP. As a disadvantage, premaxillary necrosis might occur because of poor blood circulation. It is important to secure the following 2 blood supplies: from the periosteum and soft-tissue of the anterior premaxillae and from the periosteum and mucosa of the nasal septum. Synchronous premaxillary osteotomy and GPP with primary <b>cheiloplasty</b> are appropriate when the premaxillae cannot be properly repositioned by PSO or PSO cannot be done...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: This study {{analyzed}} histological and histochemical {{features of}} specimens of the orbicularis oris muscle, and palatal and pharyngeal muscles biopsied during surgery from 33 patients affected by cleft lip and palate. DESIGN: Three groups were studied: 20 patients affected by cleft palate {{with or without}} cleft lip (at the time of primary palatoplasty), seven by cleft lip with or without cleft palate (primary lip closure), and six by cleft lip with or without cleft palate (secondary <b>cheiloplasty).</b> Muscle sections were stained with hematoxylin-eosin, modified Gomori trichrome, ATPase reaction at pH 9. 4, and NADH-TR. Analyzed parameters included organization, muscle fiber size and type, nuclear changes, presence of ragged-red fibers, degree of fibrosis, and presence of inflammatory infiltrate. RESULTS: In all patients who underwent primary palatoplasty and lip closure we noted dystrophic-like alterations of orbicularis oris and palatopharyngeal muscles, such as variability of fiber size, fiber disorganization, and increased fibrosis. The same alterations were found in adult patients submitted to secondary <b>cheiloplasty,</b> notwithstanding surgical repair. Furthermore, in all groups neither neurogenic atrophy nor ragged-red fibers or inflammatory infiltrate were detected.

The analyzed parameters were: organization and type of muscle fibers, presence of ragged red fibers, characteristics of nuclei, degree of fibrosis, presence of adipose tissue and inflammatory infiltrate. Our results showed the presence in the first group and the persistence in the second one, although surgical repair of the schisis, of dystrophic-like alterations of the orbicularis oris muscle such as variability of fiber size, fibers disorganization and increase of connective tissue. We found no neurogenic atrophy, ragged red fiber or inflammatory infiltrate. The marked alterations of lip muscle in children with cleft, that perstist in adults even after surgery, suggest that muscle damage could represent a significant pathogenetic factor in this type of malformation.

40|$|Background The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} changes in nasal growth after the implementation of a preoperative nasal retainer in patients with bilateral incomplete cleft lip. Methods Twenty-six infants with bilateral incomplete cleft lip and cleft palate were included in the study. A preoperative nasal retainer was applied in 5 patients from the time of birth to 2. 6 – 3. 5 months before primary <b>cheiloplasty.</b> Twenty-one patients who were treated without a preoperative nasal retainer were placed in the control group. Standard frontal, basal, and lateral view photographs were taken 3 weeks before <b>cheiloplasty,</b> immediately after <b>cheiloplasty,</b> and at the 1 - and 3 -year postoperative follow-up visits. The columella and nasal growth ratio and nasolabial angle were indirectly measured using photographic anthropometry. Results The ratio of columella length to nasal tip protrusion significantly increased after the implementation of a preoperative nasal retainer compared to the control group for up to 3 years postoperatively (P< 0. 01 for all time points). The ratios of nasal width to facial width, nasal width to intercanthal distance, columellar width to nasal width, and the nasolabial angle, for the two groups were not significantly different at any time point.

Material and methods: The paper will present a literature review with emphasis on the dental particularities and risk factors, including a case report to illustrate the preoperative dental treatment required before primary repair surgeries. Results and discussion: The male boy of African descent first attended HRAC-USP {{at the age of}} eight years, without previous treatment, presenting complete right cleft lip and palate. The intraoral clinical examination revealed presence of seveal carious lesions and need of extractions. The dental treatment planning comprised several sessions and was initiated by pediatric dental management, followed by anmalgam and glass ionomer restorations and tooth extractions, beginning by regions with smaller lesions and where local anesthetics causes less discomfort.

40|$|Cleft lip and palate(CLP) {{is one of}} {{the most}} common craniofacial {{deformities}} that requires systemic management involving a multidisciplinary team approach. Although there has been great improvement in the field of cleft surgery, surgical approach alone cannot resolve the various problems in treating cleft lip and palate. Hence the need for presurgical treatment was appreciated and especially, the concept of presurgical nasoalveolar molding was applied to treat unilateral and bilateral cleft lip and palate patients. Presurgical nasoalveolar molding(PNAM) of unilateral cleft mainly aims to recover nasal symmetry while the objectives of pre-surgical nasoalveolar molding in the bilateral cleft are to elongate the columella, to erect the tip of nose, and to reposition the forward displaced premaxillary region. This report covers the case of fraternal twins diagnosed with bilateral cleft. Retraction of the premaxillary region and nasoalveolar molding were conducted for 70 days until <b>cheiloplasty,</b> using elastic bands and nasoalveolar molding appliances. After <b>cheiloplasty,</b> there had been improvements in the length of columella and the position of forward-displaced premaxilla for both patients compared to their initial states.

40|$|Introduction: Cheilitis granulomatosa causes {{persistent}} idiopathic lip {{swelling and}} ulceration {{and it can}} sometimes {{be recognized as a}} unique or early manifestation of Crohn’s disease. Spontaneous remission is rare and with the lack of controlled trials, different therapeutic approaches have been used. Some cases have been treated with an exclusion diet in the attempt to rule out diet allergens, while the most popular treatments include antibiotics such as tetracycline and clofazimine tranilast, benzocaine topical or intralesional steroids, and <b>cheiloplasty,</b> with different outcomes. Case presentation: We describe the case of a 23 -year-old Caucasian man, primarily diagnosed with cheilitis granulomatosa for a severe lower lip swelling, and then with Crohn’s disease of the terminal ileum and anus. Treatment of Crohn’s disease with an anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha agent (infliximab) successfully induced remission of both the gastrointestinal disease and the oral lesion.

Nasal profiles were evaluated before and after the operation using the photogrammetric method. ResultsThe nasal profiles were improved in all patients, and all skin grafts were well taken, {{with the exception of one}} patient. Columellar height, nostril height, and columella-lip angle increased, and nasal width decreased significantly. The ratios of columellar height to nasal height, columellar height to nasal width, and nasal height to nasal width increased to a statistically significant extent. ConclusionsColumella lengthening with a full-thickness skin graft is a simple and effective method for the repair of severely short columellae in bilateral cleft nose patients. We had satisfactory outcomes, with good color matching and aesthetically pleasing contours...|$|E
40|$|This study aims to {{evaluate}} facial morphology and shape variability {{of the face}} in preschool patients with various types of orofacial clefts following neonatal cheiloplasty; in comparison with age corresponding healthy controls. All patients were operated with the same protocol during {{first two weeks of}} life. This study is based on 3 D facial models analyzes with methods of geometric morphometry and multivariate statistics. Statistically significant differences in the mean facial shape between each of cleft groups and controls were found. Colour coded maps showed, that in patients who have only undergone neonatal <b>cheiloplasty</b> (patients with isolated cleft lip), facial morphology is affected to a lesser extent than in patients with more severe cleft types and underwent palatoplasty (unilateral and bilateral cleft lip and palate). The differences in comparison with controls were in isolated cleft lip patients mostly in the scar area, and also in nasal bridge and chin area. Within cleft types combined with palatal defect, typical differences in maxillary and buccal region were also observed. The differences are not becoming more pronounced in the older age category. Our results suggest that the severity of the defect together with underwent palatoplasty affect facial growth and development more [...] ...|$|E
