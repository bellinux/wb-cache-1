Here, we present structural, geochemical, and stable carbon isotope data from single foraminiferal calcite tests and authigenic Mg-calcite overgrowths in a sediment core recovered from an area of active methane seepage in western Svalbard at ca. 340 m water depth. The foraminifera are from intervals in the core where conventional bulk foraminiferal ? 13 <b>C?</b> 13 <b>C</b> <b>values</b> are as low as ? 11. 3 ‰. Mg/Ca analyses of the foraminiferal tests reveal that even tests {{for which there is}} no morphological evidence for secondary authigenic carbonate can contain Mg-rich interlayers with Mg/Ca up to 220 mmol/mol. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) of the contact point between the biogenic calcite and authigenic Mg-calcite layers shows that the two phases are structurally indistinguishable and they have the same crystallographic orientation. Secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) analyses reveal that the Mg-rich layers are strongly depleted in 13 <b>C</b> (? 13 <b>C?</b> 13 <b>C</b> as low as ? 34. 1 ‰).

40|$|Objective: The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to apply the cash to cash (<b>C</b> 2 <b>C)</b> cycle to companies involved in the shipping & transport aspect of international supply chains. Methodology: Primary data was collected from publically available corporate annual reports for 41 companies operating in four categories of the shipping & transport industry (third party logistics providers (3 PLs), liners, bunker suppliers, and bulk & transport companies) across eleven years (2000 - 2011). The <b>C</b> 2 <b>C</b> <b>values</b> were tested through ordinary least square single variable linear regression to establish relationships between <b>C</b> 2 <b>C</b> and two other financial metrics: return on assets (ROA) and year over year sales growth. In addition, graphical analysis was conducted in order to observe historical trends within the eleven year history. Findings: Statistical analysis conducted in open source programming language R indicated low Multiple R Squared values indicating little predictive ability of <b>C</b> 2 <b>C</b> cycle to either ROA or year over year sales growth. The <b>C</b> 2 <b>C</b> cycle should, thus, be seen as an additional, not replacement tool for performance measurement purposes. Graphical analysis indicated a general trend of stabilization of the <b>C</b> 2 <b>C</b> <b>values</b> across the four categories, although a recent divergence has occurred as the average <b>C</b> 2 <b>C</b> <b>values</b> increased in the bunker industry, stabilized for 3 PLs and liners, and decreased for bulk & tanker companies. Value: This research was a first attempt to apply the <b>C</b> 2 <b>C</b> cycle to companies operating in the shipping & transport industry. Future Research: Future research should focus upon increased application of the <b>C</b> 2 <b>C</b> cycle to service based industries, especially the shipping & transport industry.

40|$|The {{notion of}} {{customers}} co-creating value {{with the firm}} has recently gained considerable attention within the service marketing discipline. The Service-Dominant (S-D) and the Customer-Dominant (C-D) logic in marketing in particular emphasise the active role of customers in the co-creation of value. But further theoretical insights are needed into the process of <b>value</b> co-creation. Specifically, customer-to-customer (<b>C</b> 2 <b>C)</b> <b>value</b> co-creation that takes place as customers come together to socialise, {{interact with each other}} and to be co-present in socially dense service settings, requires further conceptualisation. <b>C</b> 2 <b>C</b> <b>value</b> co-creation is explored in this thesis in the socially dense service setting of multi-day outdoor festivals, using the concept of value-forming social practices as a theoretical lens. The methodological design is guided by the social constructionist stance, which complements the practice-based value approach in co-creation research by emphasising the importance of social contexts. Methods adopted include ethnographic-style participant observation, document and visual materials analysis, and a total of 52 in-depth interviews at five different UK-based outdoor multi-day festivals. Interpretive analysis identifies six distinctive <b>C</b> 2 <b>C</b> co-creation practices: Belonging, Bonding, Detaching, Communing, Connecting and Amiability. Each practice is described in terms of the actions in which it is embodied. The practices are positioned in a two-dimensional framework, with the Value orientation and the Value immersion dimensions reflecting the complexities and ambiguities that exist in social contexts. Aspects of subject- and situation-specific practice elements are examined with regard to their role in influencing the <b>C</b> 2 <b>C</b> co-creation process at festivals. Practice-based segmentation and social servicescape design strategies are proposed, which can be used to support and facilitate <b>C</b> 2 <b>C</b> co-creation. A theoretical contribution is made to the body of knowledge in service marketing, and the S-D and C-D logics in particular, by advancing understanding of what specifically is involved in <b>C</b> 2 <b>C</b> <b>value</b> co-creation. The thesis also offers holistic insights relevant for service marketing practice.

40|$|Floristic quality {{assessment}} is potentially {{an important tool}} for conservation efforts in the northern Great Plains of North America, but it has received little rigorous evaluation. Floristic {{quality assessment}}s rely on coefficients assigned to each plant species of a region’s flora based on the conservatism of each species relative {{to others in the}} region. These ‘‘coefficients of conservatism’’ (<b>C</b> <b>values)</b> are assigned by a panel of experts familiar with a region’s flora. The floristic quality assessment method has faced some criticism due to the subjective nature of these assignments. To evaluate the effect of this subjectivity on floristic quality assessments, we performed separate evaluations of the native plant communities in a natural wetland complex and three restored wetland complexes. In our first assessment, we used <b>C</b> <b>values</b> assigned ‘‘subjectively’’ by the Northern Great Plains Floristic Quality Assessment Panel. We then performed an independent assessment using the observed distributions of species among a group of wetlands that ranged from highly disturbed to largely undisturbed (data-generated <b>C</b> <b>values).</b> Using the panel-assigned <b>C</b> <b>values,</b> mean <b>C</b> <b>values</b> (<b>C)</b> of the restored wetlands rarely exceeded 3. 4 and never exceeded 3. 9, with the highest values occurring in the oldest restored complex; all but two wetlands in the natural wetland complex had a <b>C</b> greater than 3. 9. Floristic quality indices (FQI) for the restored wetlands rarely exceeded 22 and usually reached maximums closer to 19, with higher values occurring again in the oldest restored complex; only two wetlands in the natural complex had an FQI less than 22.

The primary focus of the project is on planning, building and managing of business sites with <b>C</b> 2 <b>C</b> credentials (PAD, p. 18) using sites in Lille Metropole (La Lainiere), London (London Sustainable Industries Park) and Luxemburg (Ecoparc Windhof) as experimental fields. <b>C</b> 2 <b>C</b> BIZZ is not concerned with the internal operations and activities of occupiers or users of the developed site. Accordingly, the scope of the valuation tool is confined to the planning, building and management of <b>C</b> 2 <b>C</b> sites. The deliverable from this component is a compendium of subtools (see Figure 1 below) that may be used to analyse the financial performance of <b>C</b> 2 <b>C</b> credentials in business sites to aid the making of a business case for such developments and evaluating the financial incentives for particular <b>C</b> 2 <b>C</b> site development projects. This entire work is premised on the argument that the wider adoption of <b>C</b> 2 <b>C</b> principles within the built environment depends on the rate of uptake by the private sector. The private sector, being profit driven, are likely to engage in <b>C</b> 2 <b>C</b> site development if they are convinced of its capacity to contribute to their business goals which ultimately is a return on their investment. The tool development described in this document attempts to provide a framework for collating an evidence base that can assist in articulating the business case for <b>C</b> 2 <b>C</b> in business site developments...|$|R

On further addition of diamine the pH of the suspension rose to alkaline values and the monoprotonated species (EDAH § was the main charge balancing cation. Evaporating at room temperature "EDA-H-montmorillonite-H 20 " or EDA-EDAH 2 -mont-morillonite-H 20 " systems containing 300 me EDA/ 100 g clay did not cause loss of nitrogen, but degassing under high vacuum (10 - ~ rnm Hg) did.

40|$|The {{biomarker}} compositions of {{iron sulfide}} nodules (ISNs; upper Pliocene Valle Ricca section near Rome, Italy) that contain the ferrimagnetic mineral greigite (Fe 3 S 4) were examined. In {{addition to the}} presence of specific terrestrial and marine biomarkers, consistent with formation in coastal marine sediments, these ISNs contain compounds thought to originate from sulfate reducing bacteria (SRB). These compounds include a variety of low-molecular-weight and branched alkanols and several non-isoprenoidal dialkyl glycerol diethers (DGDs). In addition, archaeal biomarkers, including archaeol, macrocyclic isoprenoidal DGDs and isoprenoidal glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers are also present. Both SRB and archaeal lipid ? 13 <b>C</b> <b>values</b> are depleted in 13 <b>C</b> (? 13 <b>C</b> <b>values</b> are typically less than ? 50 ‰), which suggests that the SRB and archaea consumed 13 <b>C</b> depleted methane. These biomarker and isotopic signatures are similar to those found in cold seeps and marine sediments where anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM) occurs with sulfate serving as the terminal electron acceptor. Association of AOM with formation of greigite-containing ISNs could provide an explanation for documented remagnetization of the Valle Ricca sediments. Upward migration of methane, subsequent AOM and associated authigenic greigite formation are widespread processes in the geological record that have considerable potential to compromise paleomagnetic records. <br/...|$|R

The three methods selected for measuring root <b>C.</b> E. <b>C.</b> in decreasing order of differentiation between varieties, were equilibration of Ca 45 with chilled fresh roots, exchange of Ca 40 with chilled fresh roots and a titration method using ground dry roots. Displacing P from P saturated fresh roots with NaOH solution was appropriate in differentiating reproducibly between varieties, for measuring root A. E. <b>C.</b> The root <b>C.</b> E. <b>C.</b> and A. E. <b>C.</b> results were expressed as weight <b>C.</b> E. <b>C.</b> or A. E. <b>C.</b> (m. e. / 100 g dry roots), surface area index <b>C.</b> E. <b>C.</b> or A. E. <b>C.</b> (m. e. / 100 g saturated calcium nitrate solution) and <b>C.</b> E. <b>C.</b> or A. E. <b>C.</b> /pot (m. e. / pot). Root type (sett or shoot) had no effect on root <b>C.</b> E. <b>C.</b> <b>values.</b> The <b>C.</b> E. <b>C.</b> for sett roots increased with increasing age whereas that of shoot roots decreased with increasing age. The range of <b>C.</b> E. <b>C.</b> and A. E. <b>C.</b> <b>values</b> for shoot roots was narrow for the varieties examined. Better differentiation between varieties was obtained when <b>C.</b> E. <b>C.</b> was measured by equilibration of Ca 45. Varietal rankings were consistently reproduced in the several experiments when <b>C.</b> E. <b>C.,</b> as measured by the three methods, was expressed on a surface area index or total pot bases. The root <b>C.</b> E. <b>C.</b> and A. E. <b>C.</b> <b>values</b> increased with increasing root weight when greater amounts of potassium were applied in both culture media. The root <b>C.</b> E. <b>C.</b> decreased in soil with better physical conditions. The cane varieties grown in solution and soil were markedly different in their growth and nutrient uptake. In the solution culture the growth and uptake were in the decreasing order of HS 7 - 5 l 74, HS 6 - 5840, HSO- 7209 and NCo 310. In the soil the array was HS 7 - 5 l 74, NCo 310 and HSO- 7209. The <b>C.</b> E. <b>C.</b> and A. E. <b>C.</b> were essentially unrelated to the amounts of cations or anions sorbed by the plant, probably because total ion uptake is primarily controlled by diffusion and active absorption rather than exchange. In solution culture the root weight, root surface area index and exchange capacity values/pot were significantly correlated with shoot weight and, except for P and Si, all nutrients analyzed for. The greatest relationships were obtained with root surface area index. In the soil the root weight was significantly correlated with shoot weight and the uptake of N, Mg and S. The root weight, root surface area index and exchange capacity values/pot measured in the solution culture were related to the root weight, shoot weight and ion uptake in the soil. Possibly the measurement of root weight, root surface area index and exchange capacity values/pot by the solution culture method may aid in making a preliminary assessment of varietal differences in nutrient uptake in the field...|$|R
