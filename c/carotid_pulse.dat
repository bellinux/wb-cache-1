40|$|Ocular pulse {{amplitude}} (OPA) {{is defined as}} the difference between maximum and minimum intraocular pressure (IOP) during a cardiac cycle. Average values of OPA range from 1 to 4 mmHg.

40|$|Abstract—Mean and pulsatile {{components}} of hemodynamic load {{are related to}} cardiovascular disease. Vascular growth factors play {{a fundamental role in}} vascular remodeling. The links between growth factors and hemodynamic load components are not well described. In 3496 participants from the Framingham Heart Study third generation cohort (mean age: 409 years; 52 % women), we related 4 tonometry-derived measures of central arterial load (<b>carotid</b> femoral <b>pulse</b> wave velocity and forward pressure wave, mean arterial pressure, and the global reflection coefficient) to circulating concentrations of angiopoietin 2, its soluble receptor; vascular endothelial growth factor, its soluble receptor; hepatocyte growth factor; insulin-like growth factor 1; and its binding protein 3. Using multivariable linear regression models, adjusted for standard cardiovascular risk factors, serum insulin-like growth factor 1 concentrations were negatively associated with <b>carotid</b> femoral <b>pulse</b> wave velocity, mean arterial pressure, and reflection coefficient (P 0. 01 for all), whereas serum vascular endothelial growth factor levels were positively associated with <b>carotid</b> femoral <b>pulse</b> wave velocity and mean arterial pressure (P 0. 04).

50|$|A minimum {{systolic}} value can {{be roughly}} estimated by palpation, {{most often used}} in emergency situations, but should be used with caution. It has been estimated that, using 50% percentiles, carotid, femoral and radial pulses are present in patients with a systolic blood pressure > 70 mmHg, carotid and femoral pulses alone in patients with systolic blood pressure of > 50 mmHg, and only a <b>carotid</b> <b>pulse</b> in patients with a systolic blood pressure of > 40 mmHg.|$|E
50|$|Because the {{mitral valve}} leaflet doesn't get {{pushed into the}} left {{ventricular}} outflow tract (LVOT) until after the aortic valve opens, the initial upstroke of the arterial pulse will be normal. When the mitral valve leaflet gets pushed into the LVOT, the arterial pulse will momentarily collapse and {{be followed by a}} second rise, as the left ventricular pressure overcomes the increased obstruction that SAM of the mitral valve causes. This can be seen on the physical examination as a double tap upon palpation of the apical impulse and as a double pulsation upon palpation of the <b>carotid</b> <b>pulse,</b> known as bifid pulse.|$|E

The measures of arterial stiffness were the <b>carotid</b> femoral <b>pulse</b> wave velocity, forward pressure wave amplitude, central pulse pressure, augmentation pressure, augmentation index, and mean arterial pressure.

50|$|The pulse {{or heart}} rate is {{the rate at}} which the heart beats while pumping blood through the arteries. Its rate is usually {{measured}} either at the wrist or the ankle and is recorded as beats per minute. The pulse commonly taken is from the radial artery at the wrist. Sometimes the pulse cannot be taken at the wrist and is taken at the elbow (brachial artery), at the neck against the carotid artery (<b>carotid</b> <b>pulse),</b> behind the knee (popliteal artery), or in the foot dorsalis pedis or posterior tibial arteries. The pulse rate can also be measured by listening directly to the heartbeat using a stethoscope. The pulse varies with age. A newborn or infant can have a heart rate of about 130-150 beats per minute. A toddler's heart will beat about 100-120 times per minute, an older child's heartbeat is around 60-100 beats per minute, adolescents around 80-100 beats per minute, and adults' pulse rate is anywhere between 50 and 80 beats per minute.|$|E

In this study, the optimal forces externally applied to the proposed sen-sor were first examined to allow accurate measurement of <b>carotid</b> <b>pulse</b> wave amplitude variations, and {{it was found that}} the force applied when the measured maximum amplitudes of the sensor were obtained yielded the best performance. Next, <b>carotid</b> <b>pulse</b> waves were measured using the sensor with these optimal forces, and the results were compared with <b>carotid</b> <b>pulse</b> pressure values measured using a commercial pulse wave transducer.

40|$|During {{a three-year}} period 10 {{patients}} with critical aortic stenosis were referred to a cardiac referral centre with symptoms and signs of intractable cardiac failure and low cardiac output. In nine patients the correct diagnosis was not suspected at the referring hospital, and in the remaining patient the true severity of the aortic stenosis was not appreciated and cardiomyopathy was suggested as an additional diagnosis. The most common referral diagnoses were severe mitral regurgitation (four patients), congestive cardiomyopathy (two patients), or both (three patients). Only two patients had soft ejection systolic murmurs {{at the base of}} the heart radiating into the neck, and such a murmur appeared in a third patient during medical treatment. The <b>carotid</b> <b>pulses</b> were of small volume but the characteristic slow-rising, anacrotic nature of the pulse could not be appreciated clinically. The diagnosis was suspected in nine patients because of aortic valve calcification detected by lateral chest x-ray examination in seven patients and by x-ray screening of the heart in two, and because of abnormal aortic valve echoes in the echocardiogram of all five patients in whom the aortic valve could be seen. Eight patients underwent aortic valve replacement despite seemingly poor preoperative left ventricular function. Three patients died, of whom two had severe coexistent coronary artery disease. The five survivors all returned to normal lives and needed little or no medication...|$|R
40|$|This is a {{retrospective}} study of 25 patients with secundum-type of ASD, confirmed by catheterization and angiocardiography. As controls, 25 normal subjects of matching age were studied.

The amplitude of the first heart sound relative to that of the second sound (measured from the ratio I/IIA) was similar to that of the controls, Finally, a slight precedence of aortic valve opening (obtained from the carotid upstroke time minus transmission time) over the second component of the first sound (Ib) was found both in ASD and in controls. In view of these facts, a tricuspid contribution to the mechanism of the b component of the first heart sound appears highly unlikely.
