50|$|In 2001, a California {{medical device}} manufacturer, 3Gen, {{introduced}} the first polarized dermatoscope, the DermLite. Polarised illumination, {{coupled with a}} cross-polarised viewer, reduces (polarised) skin surface reflection, thus allowing visualisation of skin structures (the light from which is depolarised) without using an immersion fluid. Examination of several lesions is thus more convenient because physicians {{no longer have to}} stop and apply immersion oil, alcohol, or water to the skin before examining each lesion. With the marketing of polarised dermatoscopes, dermatoscopy increased in popularity among physicians worldwide. Although images produced by polarised light dermatoscopes are slightly different from those produced by a traditional skin <b>contact</b> <b>glass</b> dermatoscope, they have certain advantages, such as vascular patterns not being potentially missed through compression of the skin by a glass contact plate.|$|E
50|$|To {{prepare for}} the film, Ray interviewed and re-interviewed key figures for any {{relevant}} details. He signed some of them as paid consultants and gave several approval over the script.

40|$|International audienceA {{carefully}} controlled, custom-built adhesion {{testing device}} was developed which allows a precise, short dwell {{time on the}} order of milliseconds to be applied during a contact adhesion experiment. The dwell time dependence of the adhesive strength of crosslinked poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) in <b>contact</b> with <b>glass</b> and uncrosslinked styrene butadiene rubber (SBR) in <b>contact</b> with <b>glass</b> and with itself was tested with a spherical probe in a confined Johnson-Kendall-Roberts (JKR) geometry. Analysis of the contact images revealed several unique separation mechanisms which are dependent on dwell time and interfacial properties. PDMS-glass interfaces show essentially no dependence of adhesion on the dwell time while the adhesive strength and separation mechanisms of SBR interfaces are shown to vary drastically for dwell times ranging from 40 to 10 ? 000 ms. This influence of dwell time is particularly pronounced for polymer-polymer (SBR-SBR) interfaces.

40|$|Platelet {{structural}} {{changes such as}} spreading and cytoskeletal reorganization that occur upon contact with synthetic surfaces have been well documented. Structural changes such as spreading will {{vary depending on the}} substrate involved. Although platelet {{structural changes}} following adhesion have been recorded, the cellular mechanisms including changes in intracellular calcium flux underlying these platelet responses are less well understood. In this study, video microscopy was used to image platelet adhesion and spreading while simultaneously imaging intracellular free Ca 2 + levels in individual Fura- 2 loaded human platelets. This was accomplished using fluorescence video microscopy coupled with video enhanced asymmetric illumination contrast (AIC) to image Ca 2 + transients and correlative electron microscopy to image associated structural changes in individual platelets <b>contacting</b> <b>glass</b> and polyvinyl formal, formvar, substrates. Three main points were concluded from this study: 1) Intracellular Ca 2 + levels increase with surface- induced activation on either formvar or glass. 2) In partially spread or fully spread platelets, intracellular Ca 2 + decreases to a steady state value. 3) Plateletplatelet contact leads to intracellular Ca 2 + transients...|$|R

40|$|The {{contact angle}} is a {{critical}} parameter in liquid interface dynamics ranging from liquid spreading on a solid surface on earth to liquid motion in partially filled containers in space. A refractive tilting-plate technique employing a scanning laser beam is developed to conduct an experimental study of a moving contact line, {{with the intention of}} making accurate measurements of the contact angle. The technique shows promise as an accurate and potentially fully automated means to determine the velocity dependence of the contact angle at the intersection of the interface between two transparent fluids with a transparent solid surface. Ray tracing calculations are included to reinforce the measurement concept. The principal experiments were conducted at speeds ranging from 0. 05 to 1. 00 mm/s, both advancing and receding, using an immiscible liquid pair (nonane/formamide) in <b>contact</b> with <b>glass.</b> The <b>contact</b> angle was found to depend for practical purposes only on the sign of the velocity and not on its magnitude for the range of velocities studied.

The prevention comprises the instillation without contact of the collyria, the adequate disinfection of instruments and the frequent hand washing. The disinfection of the tonometers and <b>contact</b> <b>glasses</b> aims particularly the elimination of viruses. If the virus of herpes, hepatitis and acquired immunodeficiency are eliminated by hypochlorite, oxygenated water and alcohol after 10 minutes, the adenovirus which is not coated is on the other hand resistant to alcohol and may survive several days on instruments. Ideally the disinfection would have to be performed between each utilization by soaking in bleach water at 500 ppm, or in chloramine 0. 5 %, or in hydrogen peroxide 3 % (during 10 minutes). The alcohol may damage the glue of diagnostic contact lens. The hypochlorite attacks the metal. In case of possible contact with the blood of the patient, the wear of gloves is counseled (for example for fluorescein angiography) and is of course mandatory for surgical procedures in the office like excision of chalazion or keratotomy.
