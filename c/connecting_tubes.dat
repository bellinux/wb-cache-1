Like the can type combustor, can annular combustors have discrete combustion zones contained in separate liners with their own fuel injectors.

The combustion zones can also [...] "communicate" [...] with each other via liner holes or <b>connecting</b> <b>tubes</b> that allow some air to flow circumferentially. The exit flow from the cannular combustor generally has a more uniform temperature profile, which is better for the turbine section. It also eliminates the need for each chamber to have its own igniter. Once the fire is lit in one or two cans, it can easily spread to and ignite the others. This type of combustor is [...] also lighter than the can type, and has a lower pressure drop (on the order of 6%). However, a cannular combustor can be more difficult to maintain than a can combustor. An example of a gas turbine engine utilizing a cannular combustor is the General Electric J79 The Pratt & Whitney JT8D and the Rolls-Royce Tay turbofans use this type of combustor as well.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Laparoscopic {{adjustable}} gastric banding {{is one of}} {{the most}} frequently done procedures for morbid obesity. In most reported cases, the band itself is the cause of complications. There are only a few reports of morbidities caused by the <b>connecting</b> <b>tube.</b> This presentation describes a case of acute abdomen due to small bowel herniation between the <b>connecting</b> <b>tube</b> and the abdominal wall. This case report aims to remind clinicians of possible complications caused by the <b>connecting</b> <b>tube</b> of a gastric band. Case presentation: We report about a 24 -year-old male patient, who presented with acute abdomen. He had undergone gastric banding three years ago. According to his clinical presentation, the patient was diagnosed as having acute appendicitis. Abdominal exploration revealed, total small bowel herniation between the <b>connecting</b> <b>tube</b> and the abdominal wall. Discussion: Although a simple procedure, laparoscopic gastric banding could have serious complications. Some of these complications could present years after the application of the gastric band. There are a few reports about complications caused by the <b>connecting</b> <b>tube</b> of the gastric band. Conclusion: Complications caused by <b>connecting</b> <b>tube</b> should always be in mind, when assessing acute abdomen in patients with laparoscopic gastric band...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: Bench {{evaluation}} of the hydrodynamic behavior of venous cannulas is a valuable technique {{for the analysis of}} their performance during cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the effect of the internal diameter of the extracorporeal <b>connecting</b> <b>tube</b> of venous cannulas on flow rate (Q), pressure drop (delta P), and cannula resistance (delta P/Q²) values, using a computer assisted test bench. ¦METHODS: An in vitro circuit was set up with silicone tubing between the test cannula encased in a movable reservoir, and a static reservoir. The delta P, defined as the difference between the drainage pressure and the preload pressure, was measured using high-fidelity Millar pressure transducers. Q was measured using an ultrasonic flowmeter. Data display and data recording were controlled using virtual instruments in a stepwise fashion. ¦RESULTS: The 27 F smartcanula® with a 9 mm <b>connecting</b> <b>tube</b> diameter showed 17 % less resistance compared to that with an 8 mm <b>connecting</b> <b>tube</b> diameter. Q values were 7. 22 ± 0. 1 and 7. 81 ± 0. 04 L/min for cannulas with 8 mm and 9 mm <b>connecting</b> <b>tube</b> diameters, respectively. The delta P/Q² ratio values were 72 % lower for the Medtronic cannula with a 9 mm <b>connecting</b> <b>tube</b> diameter compared to that with an 8 mm <b>connecting</b> <b>tube</b> diameter. Q values for the Medtronic cannula were 3. 94 ± 0. 23 and 6. 58 ± 0. 04 L/min with 8 mm and 9 mm <b>connecting</b> <b>tube</b> diameters, respectively. The 27 F smartcanula® showed 13 % more flow rate compared to the 28 F Medtronic cannula using the unpaired Student t-test (p< 0. 0001). ¦CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrated that Q was increased but delta P and delta P/Q² values were significantly decreased when the <b>connecting</b> <b>tube</b> diameter was increased for venous cannulas. The <b>connecting</b> <b>tube</b> diameter significantly affected the resistance to liquid flow through the cannula. Smartcanulas® outperform Medtronic cannulas...|$|R

50|$|All the {{waterways}} in Disneyland are interconnected so {{that they}} may go through a natural process of filtration and de-stagnation much like a lake or pond can do. By connecting the waterways, the rivers and moats could act as a single body of water and prevent fouling like an abandoned swimming pool. To this day all the dark green waters of Disneyland are connected via underground <b>connecting</b> <b>tubes,</b> also allowing for aquatic life to pass through. Upon opening of the Rivers of America, the water was a brown color due to the soil and mostly natural clay that kept the water from sinking (the first fill-the-river day failed as the water was absorbed by the sandy Anaheim substrate). When the rivers and moats were eventually embanked by concrete, they didn't want the water to be clear or it would reveal pipes, guidance tracks, and other hidden functions, so today the rivers are dyed green with chalk, since the chalk doesn't settle and it doesn't bother the wildlife.

50|$|The great {{advantage}} of the tube anemometer {{lies in the fact}} that the exposed part can be mounted on a high pole, and requires no oiling or attention for years; and the registering part can be placed in any convenient position. Two <b>connecting</b> <b>tubes</b> are required. It might appear at first sight as though one connection would serve, but the differences in pressure on which these instruments depend are so minute, that the pressure of the air in the room where the recording part is placed has to be considered. Thus if the instrument depends on the pressure or suction effect alone, and this pressure or suction is measured against the air pressure in an ordinary room, in which the doors and windows are carefully closed and a newspaper is then burnt up the chimney, an effect may be produced equal to a wind of 10 mi/h (16 km/h); and the opening of a window in rough weather, or the opening of a door, may entirely alter the registration.|$|E
5000|$|New testing {{platforms}} are now {{developed to}} solve problems related to cellular interactions. These new platforms are much more complex based on multi-compartmental perfused systems. The main objective of these systems is to reproduce in vivo mechanisms more reliably by providing cell culture environment close to the in vivo situation. Each compartment in the system represent a specific organ of the living organism and thus each compartment has a specific characteristics and criteria. Each compartment in these systems are connected by tubes and pumps through which the fluid flows thus mimicking the blood flow in the in vivo situation. The draw back behind {{the use of these}} perfused systems is that, the adverse effects ( [...] influence of both the biological and non-biological components of the system on the fate of the chemical under study) are more compared to the static systems.
