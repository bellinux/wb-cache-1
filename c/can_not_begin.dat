This {{is the way to}} begin; but you <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>begin</b> unless you are at the beginning. If your children are partly grown, and you find that they are not under your command, the difficulty is much greater. The principles which should govern the management are the same, but they can not be applied by means so gentle. The prison, it may be, must now be somewhat more real, the terms of imprisonment somewhat longer, and there may be cases of insubordination so decided as to require the offender to be carried to it by force, on account of his refusal to go of his own accord, and perhaps to be held there, or even to be tied. Cases requiring treatment so decisive as this must be very rare with children under ten years of age; and when they occur, the mother has reason to feel great self-condemnation--or at least great self-abasement--at finding that she has failed so entirely in the first great moral duty of the mother, which is to train her children to complete submission to her authority from the beginning.|$|E

40|$|We {{present the}} {{evolution}} {{path of the}} first core in rotating molecular cloud core and the evolution during the second collapse phase using axisymmetric numerical calculations. The structure and evolution of the rotating first core {{is characterized by the}} angular momentum J_ core and mass M_ core, both of which increase with time by accretion from the infalling envelope. We find the evolution path of it can be considered as a sequence of equilibrium solutions with a constant J_ core/M_ core^ 2. Such evolution paths are in good agreement with the results of three-dimensional numerical simulations. The evolution paths is completely different from spherical case. Except for extremely small rotation rate of J_ core/M_ core^ 2 < 0. 015 G/(√(2) c_ iso), the first core does not increase in the central density beyond a certain maximum value and <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>begins</b> the second collapse direct and grows in mass by accretion.

40|$|Since the {{appearance}} of marketing and implementation of marketing concept in practice, {{the importance of the}} marketing mix, through which organizations adapt their offer to targeted customer segments, was emphasized. Regardless {{of the fact that the}} product is commonly referred to as the basic (key) instrument of the marketing mix, in the last ten years, due to the rapid and strong development of science, technology, especially information technology, business and society in general, integrated marketing communications (IMK) are becoming increasingly important, without which organizations <b>can</b> <b>not</b> even <b>begin,</b> or end, any significant marketing activity.

Research results confirmed the basic hypothesis as well as an extraordinary influence of IMK to the market share of producers in the placement of gas boilers. Supplementary hypothesis was not confirmed, advertising is not a key promotional instrument.

40|$|The {{following}} is a document influenced by a traditional educational process, which {{is in contrast to}} my educational philosophy, i. e., in regards to my thesis project and my personal beliefs. I attempted to develop a high school based on the individual as the learner, in which he may reinforce his weak areas and strengthen his career goals. This is what I feel education should be, but presently the system forces students to build up school images or stereotype their professors. I took it upon myself to select a project that would challenge my weak areas in order to assure a learning experience during thesis year. My thesis project was an attempt to develop a strong philosophy and concept for the building environment to respond; this environment {{is more important than the}} structure itself. I set out to develop a learning environment in which the student feels is for him and not for the glory of the faculty, staff, or architect.

This expression is not equal to 0 by Lemma  6. In each summand g_w(n)^* pq^* g_w(n) the special edges in p, q won’t cancel. Denote u=r(g_w(n)). We have 0 [...] c=u+∑ν _p,q pq^* ∈ J_ 0; [...] l(p)=l(q)> 1, sd(p)=sd(q)=n, r(p)=r(q), both p and q contain non special edges, pq^* ∈ B(γ [...]), for each summand. Now, as we did above, consider g_u(m)^* c g_u(m)=r(g_u(n))+∑ν _p,q g_u(m)^* pq^* g_u(m) and g_u(m) g_u(m)^* c g_u(m) g_u(m)^*=g_u(m) g_u(m)^* + ∑ν _p,q pq^*, where both p, q in each summand are continuations of g_u(m).

Ames Laboratory, one of the U. S. Department of Energy sites, has developed a robotic sampling system for automation of real-time contaminant analysis in situ which will provide the advantage of lowering the cost per sample, eliminating personnel exposure to hazardous environments, and allowing quicker results. Successful accomplishment of real-time contaminant analysis will require a remote manipulator to perform the sampling tasks in remote and unstructured surroundings, and a remote-controlled guide vehicle to move a remote manipulator into the desired sampling location;This thesis focuses on the design and construction of a remote-controlled guide vehicle to move the robotic sampling system into the contaminated field to obtain soil samples at the desired locations, {{the development of an}} integrated dynamic model of a remote manipulator, the identification of dynamic parameters in the integrated dynamic model, and the design of a mobile robotic sampling system. A four-wheeled vehicle prototype has been constructed and its performance tested manually in the field to verify the design requirements. To remotely control the vehicle, mechanical requirements to activate the brake, throttle, transmission, and steering linkages were determined based on experimental results. A teleoperated control utilizing hundred feet long umbilical cords was first employed to remotely control the vehicle. Next, the vehicle was modified to remotely operate in the field by radio control without the aid of long umbilical cords, satisfying all the design specifications;To reduce modeling error in the robotic system, the integrated dynamic system comprised of a remote manipulator (located on a trailer pulled by the remote-controlled guide vehicle) and its drive system has been modeled. The friction model as a function of velocity is included. The dynamic parameters such as velocity-dependent friction and gravity torque in the integrated dynamic model have been determined based on experimental results;Finally, a robotic arm, a sampling tool, and a soil recovery fixture for a mobile robotic sampling system to be mounted on the remote-controlled guide vehicle have been designed and analyzed. The integrated dynamic model for the robotic arm (mounted on the remote-controlled guide vehicle) and its drive system has also been developed...|$|E

In late years, non-invasive diagnostic method for arteriosclerosis can be done by the diagnosis with high resolution echography. However, even this new diagnostic method <b>can</b> <b>not</b> diagnose until <b>beginning</b> the morphologic changes of the arteries by stenosis. There is little value even if it could be detected the arteriosclerosis after the stenosis of the arteries have progressed. And we thought that it should be non-invasive method for evaluating the arteriosclerosis. We introduced a idea of rheo-logical dynamics into analysis. For example the cross-section area of young elastic artery may expand quick and wide and old one dose narrow and slow expansion by blood pressure. We call it functional tissue characterization, and investigated common carotid artery of about 160 persons. In this way we diagnosed the arteriosclerosis by aging quan-titatively by some parameters by the nonlinear pressure and area of common carotid artery curve. Furthermore, we were able to separate hypertension group and a physically normal group quantitatively as a result of having evaluated the arte-riosclerosis from various vascular disease.
