40|$|The {{rheological}} properties of thermoplastic starch (TPS) melt were investigated {{using the new}} multipass rheometer (MPR). This rheometer consists of two servo-hydraulically driven pistons and a fully <b>closed</b> <b>barrel,</b> enabling pressurisation of sample and preventing moisture loss during the process. The starch samples (with different plasticiser contents, 70 – 110 %, and at different glycerol/water ratio, 1 : 4, 2 : 3, and 3 : 2) were first well transformed into TPS in MPR and then tested at different temperatures (90, 110 and 130 ◦C). The TPS behaved as a shear-thinning material, and the power-law model was used to describe its rheological behaviour. The combination of glycerol and water had the greatest influence on the powerlaw index n while temperature had little influence. By mastercurve study, it was shown that the higher the glycerol/water ratio, the stronger the shear-thinning behaviour was. This was explained by interaction between starch and plasticiser and different structural characteristics at different conditions...|$|E

They use oligonucleotide/oligosaccharide-binding (OB) -folds, a five-stranded β-sheet coiled into a <b>closed</b> <b>barrel,</b> to bind to ssDNA thereby protecting and stabilizing the DNA. In eukaryotes the ssDNA-binding protein (SSB) is known as replication protein A (RPA) and consists of three distinct subunits that function as a heterotrimer. The bacterial homolog is termed SSB and functions as a homotetramer. In the archaeon Haloferax volcanii there are three genes encoding homologs of RPA. Two of the rpa genes (rpa 1 and rpa 3) exist in operons with a novel gene specific to Euryarchaeota; this gene encodes a protein that we have termed RPA-associated protein (rpap). The rpap genes encode proteins belonging to COG 3390 group and feature OB-folds, suggesting that they might cooperate with RPA in binding to ssDNA. Our genetic analysis showed that rpa 1 and rpa 3 deletion mutants have differing phenotypes; only Δrpa 3 strains are hypersensitive to DNA damaging agents. Deletion of the rpa 3 -associated gene rpap 3 led to similar levels of DNA damage sensitivity, as did deletion of the rpa 3 operon, suggesting that RPA 3 and RPAP 3 function in the same pathway. Protein pull-downs involving recombinant hexahistidine-tagged RPAs showed that RPA 3 co-purifies with RPAP 3, and RPA 1 co-purifies with RPAP 1. This indicates that the RPAs interact only with their respective associated proteins; this was corroborated by the inability to construct rpa 1 rpap 3 and rpa 3 rpap 1 double mutants.

40|$|Membrane {{proteins}} are {{key elements}} of the cell since they {{are associated with a}} variety of very important biological functions crucial to its survival. They are implicated in cellular recognition and adhesion, act as molecular receptors, transport substrates through membranes and exhibit specific enzymatic activity. This thesis is focused on integral membrane proteins, most of which contain transmembrane segments that form an alpha helix and are composed of mainly hydrophobic residues, spanning the lipid bilayer. A more specialized and less well-studied case, is the case of integral membrane proteins found in the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria and (presumably) in the outer envelope of mitochondria and chloroplasts, proteins whose transmembrane segments are formed by amphipathic beta strands that create a <b>closed</b> <b>barrel</b> (beta-barrels). The importance of transmembrane proteins, as well as the inherent difficulties in crystallizing and obtaining three-dimensional structures of these, dictates the need for developing computational algorithms and tools that will allow for a reliable and fast prediction of their structural and functional features. In order to elucidate their function, we must acquire knowledge about their structure and topology with relation to the membrane. Therefore, a large number of computational methods have been developed in order to predict the transmembrane segments and the overall topology of transmembrane proteins. In this thesis, I initially describe a large-scale benchmark of many topology prediction tools in order to devise a strategy that will allow for better detection of alpha-helical membrane proteins in a proteome. Then, I give a description of construction of improved machine-learning algorithms and computer software for accurate topology prediction of transmembrane proteins and discrimination of such proteins from non-transmembrane proteins. Finally, I introduce a fast way to obtain a position-specific scoring matrix, which is essential for modern topology prediction methods.

40|$|A beta bulge is {{a region}} between two {{consecutive}} beta-type hydrogen bonds which includes two residues (positions 1 and 2) on one strand opposite a single residue (position x) {{on the other}} strand. Compared to regular beta structure, a beta bulge puts the usual alternation of side-chain direction out of register {{on one of the}} strands, introduces a slight bend in the beta sheet, and locally accentuates the usual right-handed strand twist. Almost all beta bulges are between antiparallel strands, usually between a narrow rather than a wide pair of hydrogen bonds. Ninety-one examples are listed. The two commonest types are the "classic" beta bulge, with position 1 in approximately alpha-helical conformation, and the "G 1 " beta bulge, with a required glycine at position 1 in approximately left-handed alpha-helical conformation, G 1 bulges almost always occur in combination with a type II tight turn. The functional roles of beta bulges probably include compensating for the effects of a single-residue insertion or deletion within beta structure and providing the strong local twist required for form <b>closed</b> beta <b>barrel</b> structures...|$|R
50|$|Triose Phosphate Isomerase is {{a member}} of the alpha and beta (α/β) class of proteins; it is a homodimer, and each subunit {{contains}} 247 amino acids.

Therefore, the enzyme must be in a dimer in order to achieve full function of the enzyme, even though it is not believed that the two active sites participate in cooperativity with each other. Each subunit contains 8 exterior alpha helices surrounding 8 interior beta strands, which form a conserved structural domain called a <b>closed</b> alpha/beta <b>barrel</b> (αβ) or more specifically a TIM barrel. Characteristic of most all TIM barrel domains is the presence of the enzyme's active site in the lower loop regions created by the eight loops that connect the C-termini of the beta strands with the N-termini of the alpha helices. TIM barrel proteins also share a structurally conserved phosphate binding motif, with the phosphate group found in the substrate or cofactors.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT alp barrel {{structures}} {{very similar}} to that first observed in triose phosphate isomerase are now known to occur in 14 enzymes. To understand the origin of this fold, we analyzed in three of these proteins the geometry of the eight-stranded P-sheets and the packing of the residues {{at the center of the}} barrel. The packing in this region is seen in its simplest form in glycolate oxidase. It consists of 12 residues arranged in three layers. Each layer contains four side chains. The packing of RubisCO and TIM can be understood in terms of distortions of this simple pattern, caused by residues with small side chains at some of the positions inside the barrel. Two classes of packing are found. In one class, to which RubisCO and TIM belong, the central layer is formed by a residue from the first, third, fifth, and seventh strands; the upper and lower layers are formed by residues from the second, fourth, sixth, and eighth strands. In the second class, to which GAO belongs, this is reversed: it is side chains from the even-numbered strands that form the central layer, and side chains from the oddnumbered strands that form the outer layers. Our results suggest that not all proteins with this fold are related by evolution, but that they represent a common favorable solution to the structural problems involved in the creation of a <b>closed</b> Q <b>barrel.</b> Key words: protein architecture, packing, evolutionary relationship...|$|R
