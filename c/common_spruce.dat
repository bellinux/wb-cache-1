40|$|In {{forests of}} Gorski kotar, Croatia the fat {{dormouse}} (Glis glis L.) is the numerous dormouse species. In years with high population densities fat dormice start cause damage on trees. Mainly they damage {{the bark of}} <b>common</b> <b>spruce</b> (Picea abies (L.) Karst.). This work presents the analysis of morphological parameters of 248 caught individuals (119 males and 129 females) of fat dormouse. Animals were caught on three locations from year 2001 to 2009 in forests managed by »Hrvatske šume« d. o. o. Zagreb, forest administration Delnice. First location represents forest culture of <b>common</b> <b>spruce</b> (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) (location »a«) under management of forest office Delnice. Second and third locations under management of forest office Mrkopalj represent forest culture of <b>common</b> <b>spruce</b> (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) (location »b«) and natural forest of common beech (association Fagetum montanum croaticum Ht.) (location »c«). Animals were caught with snap traps set individually or in pairs in trees around 1 to 5 meters above ground. Ripe pods of the carob tree were used as bait. Traps were set late afternoon and checked next day {{early in the morning}} or during the day. Body length as morphological parameter was measured with steel tape and body mass with one gram accuracy scale. In total on all three locations 127 individuals were caught in year 2001, 53 individuals in year 2007 and 68 individuals in year 2009. For the whole time period 102 / 248 animals were caught on location »a«, 64 / 248 on location »b« and 82 / 248 on location »c«. On all 3 locations in year 2001 the highest number of animals was recorded reflecting favorable trophical conditions. Analysis of animals showed for all three locations 1 : 1 sex ratio with small difference on location »c« with sex ratio of 1 : 1. 16 (m:f). The data shows max body length with 43. 0 cm that was recorded on location »b« and min with 23. 5 cm on location »a«. Max and min body mass (250 g, 55 g) were recorded on location »a». The maximal body length with tail and body mass were recorded in years with small population densities, which corresponds to previous findings of increased body mass in years with unfavorable trophic conditions (Bieber 1997).

The aim of this study was the bio-guided investigation and the effective recovery of methanol-soluble metabolites of <b>common</b> <b>spruce</b> bark for the development of new dermo-cosmetic agents. The active methanol extract was initially fractionated by Centrifugal Partition Chromatography (CPC) using a triphasic solvent system in a step-gradient elution mode.

In parallel, the chemical composition of each fraction was established by combining a 13 C-NMR dereplication approach and 2 D-NMR analyses. As a result, fourteen secondary metabolites corresponding to stilbene, flavonoid and phenolic acid derivatives were directly identified in the CPC fractions. A high amount (0. 93 g) of E-astringin was recovered from 3 g of crude extract in a single 125 min run. E-Astringin significantly induced the tyrosinase activity while E-piceid, taxifolin, and taxifolin- 3 ′-O-glucopyranoside exhibited significant anti-tyrosinase activity.

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} is to establish, based on the {{morphological}} characteristics of shoots and morpho-anatomical characteristics of needles as well as the content of micro-elements in needles, whether there are differences between Pyramidal Fir (Abies alba var. pyramidalis Carr.) and European Silver Fir (Abies alba Mill.), and between Mišić’s spruce (Picea abies var. misicii Matović & Pavlović) and <b>Common</b> <b>Spruce</b> (Picea abies (L.) Karst.), and to determine in which characteristics these differences are most pronounced. This study showed that Pyramidal fir (PF) has a two-times higher number of lateral shoots in comparison to European silver fir (ESF), but also shorter and thinner shoots and a lower number of needles, which are slightly less densely distributed on a shoot. In addition, PF terminal shoots are significantly longer and thicker than the lateral, and have a higher number of needles. Two-year-old PF needles are longer, wider and thicker in comparison to ESF needles, and have higher values with respect to diameter of the central cylinder, thickness of cuticle and epidermis, thickness of hypodermis and diameter of resin canals. The most pronounced differences between PF and ESF are related to length of shoots, needle width and diameter of the central cylinder (statistically significant differences). In comparison to ESF, PF has a higher percentage of nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium in needles; however, this is statistically significant only in case of phosphorus. The most apparent morphological specificity of Mišić’s spruce (MS) is a rare occurrence of lateral shoots (only once in several years), unlike <b>Common</b> <b>spruce</b> (CS), which has 2 - 3 new shoots every year. MS has far longer and thicker shoots, while its needles are more numerous, longer, thinner and more densely distributed on the shoot in comparison to CS. Additionally, in comparison to CS, MS needles have a larger diameter of central cylinder, but lower thickness of cuticle with epidermis, lower thickness of hypodermis and smaller diameter of the resin canals. The most pronounced differences between MS and CS are related to length, width and thickness of needles and diameter of central cylinder (statistically significant differences).

We wanted to find out the type {{and the extent to which}} such effects on the soil can be measured in a spruce culture established within the pedunculate oak range. In order to define changes in the pedosphere of conifer {{cultures in}} relation to adjacent natural stands, the soil was sampled at three locations in the area of Vrbovec Forest Office. Three cultures of <b>common</b> <b>spruce</b> aged 36 to 40 years were selected in the area of natural stands of pedunculate oak in central Croatia (community Carpino betuli-Quercetum roboris /Ani} 1959 / Rau{ 1969, subass. typicum and fagetosum). Three plots were chosen in each of the cultures to represent treatments, in relation to three plots chosen in natural stands in the immediate proximity of the treatments. The soil in all the six plots is luvisol on loess, typical or pseudogleyic, with acid to very acid reaction in the A horizon and in the surface 5 cm soil. Leaf litter and the surface mineral part of the soil up to 5 cm depth were used to analyze differences among the investigated plots. The quantity of leaf litter was shown to be on average 2 to 3 times higher in spruce cultures. The pH value of the surface mineral soil was considerably lower in spruce cultures. The investigated soil layer in spruce stands contained more humic acids than the soil of natural stands. Of other parameters, although no significant differences could be detected, those in the organic carbon content, the C/N ratio and the humic and fulvic acids deserve special mention since they indicate poorer quality of organic matter in the surface mineral part of the soil...|$|E

40|$|<b>Common</b> <b>spruce</b> (Picea abies Karst.) is a {{tree species}} that occurs {{naturally}} {{in the valleys}} and other frost sites in high mountain regions, where it is free of serious competition of other tree species. Being resistant to frost, the winter colds of the continental and mountainous climate suit it. It is highly tolerant of winter chills of the continental and mountainous climate, it likes areas with abundant precipitation and snow in particular and avoids those with little precipitation and low relative air humidity. In Croatia, it naturally occurs in high mountain areas of Gorski Kotar, Velebit {{and other parts of}} Lika, and especially in frost spots where it is free of competition with other tree species. In Europe, spruce is a favourite tree species for the establishment of forest cultures. It has the properties of both pioneer and transitional tree species. It is highly sensitive to summer droughts. During its growth, in its habitats it creates the conditions for the development of tree species of a climatogenous forest. It develops in regular and uneven-aged stands, while its percentage in selection stands with stable structural and stand conditions is lower. The total growing stock amounts to 13, 200, 000 m³, which accounts for 5. 57 m³/ha of the forested area in Croatia. Its volume share in the highest age and diameter classes is 80 %, which indicates its advanced age and physiological weakening. Regular and uneven-aged spruce forests of high silvicultural form cover an area of 6, 300 ha, of which spruce accounts for 52 % in the composition mixture, silver fir for 35 %, common beech for 11 %, and other species for 2 %. Spruce is currently significantly affected by dieback; at the level of Croatia, the percentage of defoliated crowns is 59. 3 %, while in the Gorski Kotar area alone it is 96. 2 %. Droughts {{are one of the most}} important factors contributing to the physiological weakening and dieback of spruce in Croatia, while in Europe they are the major cause of dieback of catastrophic proportions. Temperatures measured in the past 15 years are the highest in the 150 -year period, with a linear trend of temperature increase amounting to 0. 74 °C. There is controversy as to the causes of droughts: according to many, they are the consequence of global warming, whereas others disagree. Data are given (Fig. 1) on climate change from the past warm period, over the cold one, to the present warm period. Based on average annual temperature deviations for Europe from 1850 to 2009 (Fig. 2), the current warm period has had two cold and three warm sub-periods, which contradicts the frequently emphasised negative impact of man’s activity on climate. Apart from extreme droughts, another cause of spruce dieback is attributed to the impact of the unfavourable »chemical climate« and acid rains arriving most probably from the industrially developed western countries. This is the reason why the lead content in the soils of Gorski Kotar reaches the extreme values of 71 to 128 mg/kg. Accordingly, the unfavourable »chemical climate« and acid rains are the second most important reason for the dieback of not only spruce but other tree species as well (fir, beech). The third cause of dieback is the artificial and natural expansion of spruce into unsuitable sites, coupled with the absence of timely tending and regeneration procedures in natural and artificially established forest cultures. Spruce cannot be managed with the selection method because it is a pioneer species, which does not regenerate in climatogenic and coherently forested sites. It creates the conditions for the return of fir and beech and simultaneously disappears from such stands. Its pioneer properties enable it to expand naturally in all the empty spaces within a broad complex of beech-fir forests in particular, as well as in deforested and degraded forest areas, frost sites, abandoned pastures, meadows, degraded forests such as thickets and scrub and in other areas at higher altitudes. Most of these sites are unsuitable for spruce, causing it to physiologically weaken and decline. Methods of <b>common</b> <b>spruce</b> management used to date have in general not been adjusted to its biological properties and ecological requirements or to the newly created site conditions. In our opinion, in addition to dry periods and unfavourable impact of »chemical climate«, management methods also represent an important cause of dieback. When all the three causes take place simultaneously, the ensuing result is catastrophic dieback. Low intensity dieback occurring in every stand, including a spruce stand, is a normal phenomenon characteristic of management with natural forests and forest cultures. It is usually the consequence of competition between certain species, particularly because tending operations such as cleaning and thinning are not performed, or it is the reaction to minor local site changes. Spruce is the desirable »third species« in selection forests of fir and beech, but with a lower percentage share in the composition mix. It creates the conditions for the return of fir and beech to the sites from which they have disappeared for different reasons. With the return of these species, the spruce gradually undergoes physiological weakening and should generally be removed from the composition mix of selection stands by means of tending and regeneration procedures. Spruce is a tree species whose stands have been subjected either to very little tending or none at all. In regular and uneven-aged stands, regeneration procedures have generally been postponed, while in selection stands spruce has been treated like fir in the selection of trees for cutting. All this has led to the currently unfavourable status of spruce: the spruce is old, over-mature, physiologically weak and prone to dieback in all stand forms. In view of the newly created unfavourable climate conditions, as well as air, water and soil pollution, <b>common</b> <b>spruce</b> should not be expanded into inadequate sites beyond its natural distribution range. If established in southern expositions and on stony and shallow soils, it is subject to premature dieback, so timely measures should be taken to replace it with another species that tolerates such conditions. <b>Common</b> <b>spruce</b> is an important, noble and highly usable species and it should not be neglected in future management. Better knowledge should be acquired of its biological properties, ecological requirements and commercial value. These silvicultural-management properties should be fully observed in the application of management procedures...|$|E
40|$|At {{the time}} of the Kyoto Protocol in 1997, it was decided to {{establish}} an inventory of carbon stocks in French forests. The first stage of this involved 2 studies: {{at the level of the}} whole of France, soil and humus analyses were carried out in 713 sample plots in diverse climatic regions, in which the most represented forest species were beech [Fagus sylvatica], pedunculate oak [Quercus robur], <b>common</b> <b>spruce</b> [Picea abies], Douglas fir [Pseudotsuga menziesii], silver fir [Abies alba] and Scots pine [Pinus sylvestris]; at the stand level, a biomass study was carried out of 127 ecosystems in the 1566 ha Fougeres National Forest in Brittany, and the carbon stock of the tree (woody) and herbaceous biomass computed from the results. Factors affecting the spatial variability of the carbon stock data from the France-wide soil and humus samples included dry matter content and soil type; factors affecting the spatial variability of the carbon stock data from Fougeres included stand age, species and soil type; illustrative data are tabulated from both these studies. The next stage of the study involved extrapolation of the carbon stock data to include all French forests, based on the analysis of the factors causing variation in carbon stocks in the Fougeres National Forest. This gave a total carbon stock of 442 000 - 505 000 t, equivalent to 282 - 322 t C/ha, but the probable error in this estimation is likely to be over 65 %.

However, estimation errors of relevant forest structure variables remain too high for operational use of high spatial resolution satellite imagery, such as Landsat TM/ETM and SPOT HRV, in temperate forests. Very high spatial resolution images that have been acquired by new commercial satellites, such as IKONOS- 2 or QuickBird, are expected to reduce estimation errors to a level that is acceptable by foresters. This study assessed the capability of 1 -m resolution IKONOS- 2 imagery to estimate the five main forest variables-age, top height, circumference, stand density and basal area-in even-aged <b>common</b> <b>spruce</b> stands. They were estimated on the basis of texture features that were derived from the grey-level 1 m-occurrence matrix (GLCM). The coefficients of determination, R- 2, of the best models ranged from 0. 76 to 0. 82 for top height, circumference, stand density and age variables. Basal area was found to be weakly correlated to texture variables (R- 2 = 0. 35). Relative prediction errors of four out of the five studied forest variables were comparable to the usual sampling inventory errors (top height: 10 %; circumference: 15 %; basal area: 16 %; age: 18 %), but the stand density estimation error (29 %) remained too high for use in forest planning. The sensitivity analysis to the GLCM parameters showed that the most important parameters were the texture feature, the displacement and the window size. The orientation parameter had minimal effects on the R- 2 values, even if it influenced the values of the texture features. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved...|$|E

Obična je smreka značajna i vrlo upotrebljiva vrsta kojoj moramo u gospodarskim zahvatima uvažavati biološka svojstava, ekološke zahtjeve i gospodarske vrijednosti, što će joj osigurati veću stabilnost i bolji razvoj na pogodnim staništima i u sastojinama. <b>Common</b> <b>spruce</b> (Picea abies Karst.) is a {{tree species}} that occurs naturally {{in the valleys}} and other frost sites in high mountain regions, where it is free of serious competition of other tree species. Being resistant to frost, the winter colds of the continental and mountainous climate suit it. It is highly tolerant of winter chills of the continental and mountainous climate, it likes areas with abundant precipitation and snow in particular and avoids those with little precipitation and low relative air humidity. In Croatia, it naturally occurs in high mountain areas of Gorski Kotar, Velebit {{and other parts of}} Lika, and especially in frost spots where it is free of competition with other tree species. In Europe, spruce is a favourite tree species for the establishment of forest cultures. It has the properties of both pioneer and transitional tree species. It is highly sensitive to summer droughts. During its growth, in its habitats it creates the conditions for the development of tree species of a climatogenous forest. It develops in regular and uneven-aged stands, while its percentage in selection stands with stable structural and stand conditions is lower. The total growing stock amounts to 13, 200, 000 m³, which accounts for 5. 57 m³/ha of the forested area in Croatia. Its volume share in the highest age and diameter classes is 80 %, which indicates its advanced age and physiological weakening. Regular and uneven-aged spruce forests of high silvicultural form cover an area of 6, 300 ha, of which spruce accounts for 52 % in the composition mixture, silver fir for 35 %, common beech for 11 %, and other species for 2 %. Spruce is currently significantly affected by dieback; at the level of Croatia, the percentage of defoliated crowns is 59. 3 %, while in the Gorski Kotar area alone it is 96. 2 %. Droughts {{are one of the most}} important factors contributing to the physiological weakening and dieback of spruce in Croatia, while in Europe they are the major cause of dieback of catastrophic proportions. Temperatures measured in the past 15 years are the highest in the 150 -year period, with a linear trend of temperature increase amounting to 0. 74 °C. There is controversy as to the causes of droughts: according to many, they are the consequence of global warming, whereas others disagree. Data are given (Fig. 1) on climate change from the past warm period, over the cold one, to the present warm period. Based on average annual temperature deviations for Europe from 1850 to 2009 (Fig. 2), the current warm period has had two cold and three warm sub-periods, which contradicts the frequently emphasised negative impact of man’s activity on climate. Apart from extreme droughts, another cause of spruce dieback is attributed to the impact of the unfavourable »chemical climate« and acid rains arriving most probably from the industrially developed western countries. This is the reason why the lead content in the soils of Gorski Kotar reaches the extreme values of 71 to 128 mg/kg. Accordingly, the unfavourable »chemical climate« and acid rains are the second most important reason for the dieback of not only spruce but other tree species as well (fir, beech). The third cause of dieback is the artificial and natural expansion of spruce into unsuitable sites, coupled with the absence of timely tending and regeneration procedures in natural and artificially established forest cultures. Spruce cannot be managed with the selection method because it is a pioneer species, which does not regenerate in climatogenic and coherently forested sites. It creates the conditions for the return of fir and beech and simultaneously disappears from such stands. Its pioneer properties enable it to expand naturally in all the empty spaces within a broad complex of beech-fir forests in particular, as well as in deforested and degraded forest areas, frost sites, abandoned pastures, meadows, degraded forests such as thickets and scrub and in other areas at higher altitudes. Most of these sites are unsuitable for spruce, causing it to physiologically weaken and decline. Methods of <b>common</b> <b>spruce</b> management used to date have in general not been adjusted to its biological properties and ecological requirements or to the newly created site conditions. In our opinion, in addition to dry periods and unfavourable impact of »chemical climate«, management methods also represent an important cause of dieback. When all the three causes take place simultaneously, the ensuing result is catastrophic dieback. Low intensity dieback occurring in every stand, including a spruce stand, is a normal phenomenon characteristic of management with natural forests and forest cultures. It is usually the consequence of competition between certain species, particularly because tending operations such as cleaning and thinning are not performed, or it is the reaction to minor local site changes. Spruce is the desirable »third species« in selection forests of fir and beech, but with a lower percentage share in the composition mix. It creates the conditions for the return of fir and beech to the sites from which they have disappeared for different reasons. With the return of these species, the spruce gradually undergoes physiological weakening and should generally be removed from the composition mix of selection stands by means of tending and regeneration procedures. Spruce is a tree species whose stands have been subjected either to very little tending or none at all. In regular and uneven-aged stands, regeneration procedures have generally been postponed, while in selection stands spruce has been treated like fir in the selection of trees for cutting. All this has led to the currently unfavourable status of spruce: the spruce is old, over-mature, physiologically weak and prone to dieback in all stand forms. In view of the newly created unfavourable climate conditions, as well as air, water and soil pollution, <b>common</b> <b>spruce</b> should not be expanded into inadequate sites beyond its natural distribution range. If established in southern expositions and on stony and shallow soils, it is subject to premature dieback, so timely measures should be taken to replace it with another species that tolerates such conditions. <b>Common</b> <b>spruce</b> is an important, noble and highly usable species and it should not be neglected in future management. Better knowledge should be acquired of its biological properties, ecological requirements and commercial value. These silvicultural-management properties should be fully observed in the application of management procedures...|$|E
40|$|Background and Purpose: Forest {{cultures}} in continental part of Croatia are mainly based on bracken-covered areas and moors on deserted agriculture soils and pastures. Successful afforestation i. e. establishment of forest cultures depends {{among other things}} on the understanding of habitats and ecology of forest trees. The choice of best species of forest trees for afforestation needs {{to be based on}} the research in soil and climate characteristics of target habitats. The aims of this research were to show mesoclimatic characteristics of Ličko sredogorje and microclimatic and pedological characteristics of Ličko polje. Also, based on habitat characteristics and ecology of forest trees, the aim was to determine species of forest trees suitable for afforestation of bracken-covered areas. Materials and Methods: Climate, microclimate, pedological and plant nutrition researches were done at the area of Lika highlands. Climate analysis was done according to air temperatures, amount of precipitation, relative air humidity and other climate elements and appearances. Composite soil samples were taken from the depth of 0 - 30 cm in order to determine plant nutrition potential. Samples were prepared for further analysis in the laboratory. Results: The highest average annual air temperature of 9. 6 °C was found at weather station Gračac and the lowest at Korenica station (8. 1 °C). Average amount of precipitation for this region was around 1500 mm. Monthly rain factors were ranging from arid to perhumid. Considering thermal character of the climate, the area has moderately warm climate. Average volumetric soil humidity is 14. 2 %. Soil has strong acid reaction, is very humus, good to richly supplied with total nitrogen, content of physiologically active phosphorus and potassium is low, and C/N ration normal. Conclusions: According to habitat characteristics in the area of Ličko sredogorje and ecological demands of forest tree species, forest cultures of Common birch (Betula pendula Roth.), <b>Common</b> <b>spruce</b> (Picea abies Karst.), Eastern white pine (Pinus strubus L.), Black pine (Pinus nigra subsp. austriaca Asch i Gr.), Common pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) and European trembling aspen (Populus tremula L.) can be established...|$|E
40|$|In {{the present}} {{dissertation}} {{the possibilities of}} aggregation of antagonists of bark beetles using allochthonous kairomones were to be analysed. The focus of the analysis was the species of European red-bellied clerids (Thanasimus spp.) in forests of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) and <b>common</b> <b>spruce</b> (Picea abies). Differences in trap efficiency have been analysed using the normal THEYSOHN® - slit trap and those with closed lids filled with a catching liquid. It transpired that significantly more target organisms have been locked in with the closed trap system than with the customary model. As potential attractants for European red-bellied clerids (Thanasimus spp.) standard attractants such as Pheroprax®, Sexowit®, Cembräwit®, Acuwit®, Tomowit® as well as Chalcoprax® have been tested. Furthermore the aggregate effect of individual semiochemicals, which form part of the above attractants, have been analysed in relation to European red-bellied clerids and bark beetles {{which appeared in the}} habitat. The effect of an increase of the emission rate of the attractant onto the target organisms was also part of the analysis. In addition to trials with attractants in THEYSOHN®-slit traps trials with attractants on stems of pine wood and spruce wood have also been conducted and analysed. This was to clarify whether one could aggregate that many antagonists of bark beetles that the stem does not at all or gets less populated with bark beetles. In the course of this analysis it has been attempted to identify further antagonists of bark beetles that could be aggregated with attractants. It was determined that there are important differences in levels of aggregation between the species of Thanasimus formicarius, Thanasimus rufipes and Thanasimus pectoralis with respect to the substances tested. Thanasimus formicarius has been observed in spring and early summer in pine and spruce forests. The concentration of activity of this species was higher in pine forests than in spruce forests. With respect to the tested attractants Thanasimus formicarius showed a stronger preference for Ipsdienol and Ipsenol as for (S) -cis-Verbenol in each case in connection with 2 - 3 - 2 -Methylbutenol. It is also possible to replace 2 - 3 - 2 -Methylbutenol with other substances. The substances of Sexowit® and Acuwit® ((+) -Ipsdienol, (-) -Ipsenol, α- and β-Pinen, 2 -Phenylethanol or rather Ethanol) also seem to have a strong attraction for the Thanasimus formicarius. Thanasimus rufipes and Thanasimus pectoralis mainly appeared from early summer into the late summer and were respectively recorded in the traps. Both species, in comparison to the Thanasimus formicarius, showed a much stronger preference to (S) -cis- Verbenol, respectively attractant mixtures which contained (S) -cis-Verbenol. Thanasimus rufipes has mainly been detected in pine forests and Thanasimus pectoralis in spruce forests. In pine forests Pheroprax® could be confirmed as an effective allochthonous kairomone. In spruce forests, until the completion of this analysis, no definitive attractant could be identified which aggregats European red-bellied clerids (Thanasimus spp.) on the object to be protected without attracting bark beetles (namely Ips typographus) ...|$|E
