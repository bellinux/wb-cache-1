5|$|As the two champions {{appeared}} {{they were}} greeted by a frenzy of excitement and everyone was on their feet to acclaim the two heroes. It was difficult to recognise them. Garin was first, followed by the mud-soaked figure of Cordang. Suddenly, to the stupefaction of everyone, Cordang slipped and fell on the velodrome's cement surface. Garin <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> his luck. By the time Cordang was back on his bike, he had lost 100 metres. There remained six laps to cover. Two miserable kilometres in which to catch Garin. The crowd held its breath as they watched the incredible pursuit match. The bell rang out. One lap, there remained one lap. 333 metres for Garin, who had a lead of 30 metres on the Batave.|$|E
5|$|The {{exhibition}} {{opened on}} July 9, 1962, with Warhol absent. The thirty-two single soup can canvases {{were placed in}} a single line, much like products on shelves, each displayed on narrow individual ledges. The contemporary impact was uneventful, but the historical impact is considered today {{to have been a}} watershed. The gallery audience was unsure what to make of the exhibit. A John Coplans Artforum article, which was in part spurred on by the responding display of dozens of soup cans by a nearby gallery with a display advertising them at three for 60 cents, encouraged people to take a stand on Warhol. Few actually saw the paintings at the Los Angeles exhibit or at Warhol's studio, but word spread in the form of controversy and scandal due to the work's seeming attempt to replicate the appearance of manufactured objects. Extended debate on the merits and ethics of focusing one's efforts on such a mundane commercial inanimate model kept Warhol's work in art world conversations. The pundits <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> an artist would reduce the art form to the equivalent of a trip to the local grocery store. Talk did not translate into monetary success for Warhol. Dennis Hopper was the first of only a half dozen to pay $100 for a canvas. Blum decided to try to keep the thirty-two canvases as an intact set and bought back the few sales. This pleased Warhol who had conceived of them as a set, and he agreed to sell the set for ten monthly $100 installments to Blum. Warhol had passed the milestone of his first serious art show. While this exhibition was on view in Los Angeles, Martha Jackson canceled another planned December 1962 New York exhibition.|$|E

25|$|When critics {{closed in}} and accused Samuel Ireland of forgery, his son {{published}} a confession – An Authentic Account of the Shaksperian Manuscripts – but many critics <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> {{a young man}} could have forged them all by himself. One paper published a caricature in which William Henry is awed by the findings {{when the rest of}} the family forges more of them (as opposed to what was really going on). Samuel Ireland's reputation did not recover before his death in 1800.|$|E

To see my officers engage {{in what appeared to}} be excessive use of force, possibly criminally excessive, to see them beat a man with their batons 56 times, to see a sergeant on the scene who did nothing to seize control, was something I never dreamed I would witness.|$|E

She meets Jaxon, a hot-tempered man with a band, the Midges. He offers Sephy a singing part, but the noughts are prejudiced against her because she is a cross. She begins to neglect Callie Rose.|$|E

25|$|If Campese wanted to, I am sure {{he could}} have sprinted for the corner and scored the try. Instead, he ran {{straight}} at Ackerman. The Welshman obviously knew enough about Campese to realise it was useless to try and tackle him front-on. Instead, he did what I suggested earlier that any defender should do against Campese – he ran with him. It was then that Campese began to zigzag, forcing Ackerman to zigzag, too, looking over one shoulder after another to see which way Campese was heading. I was following about 20 metres behind and <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> what was happening. I {{have no doubt that}} Campese turned it on to make a personal point with Ackerman. When the defence eventually closed in on him, Campese flicked a pass over his shoulder to Michael Hawker, who scored the try.|$|E

25|$|When the {{black-chested buzzard-eagle}} was first {{described}} by Louis Jean Pierre Vieillot in 1819, it {{was placed in}} the genus Spizaetus, as Spizaetus melanoleucus. Nowadays, however, the monotypic genus Spizastur is merged in Spizaetus, and the black-and-white hawk-eagle, originally described as by Vieillot three years earlier as Buteo melanoleucus, is now known as Spizaetus melanoleucus. The earlier use of the specific epithet melanoleucus for the black-and-white hawk-eagle technically precludes its use for the black-chested buzzard-eagle, except when it is placed in Geranoaetus. In fact, in the mid-20th century Buteo fuscescens was the prevailing name for the black-chested buzzard-eagle for some years, but it was eventually dismissed as erroneous. This specific name was established – as Spizaetus fuscescens – by Vieillot for the immature of the black-chested buzzard-eagle at the very same time as he described the adult, because he <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> that such differently-colored birds were conspecific.|$|E
25|$|In early 1989, {{he made a}} {{programme}} (broadcast in July) on {{his visit}} to Russia and his impressions on that country. The BBC originally {{wanted him to do}} a programme on India but the Indian high commission in London, England refused him a visa. When he visited Russia, Powell went to the graves of 600,000 people who died during the siege of Leningrad and saying that he <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> a people who had suffered so much would willingly start another war. He also went to a veterans' parade (wearing his own medals) and talked with Russian soldiers with the aid of an interpreter. However, the programme was criticised by those who believed that Powell had dismissed the Soviet Union's threat to the West since 1945 and that he had been too impressed with Russia's sense of national identity. When German reunification was on the agenda in mid-1989, Powell claimed that Britain urgently needed to create an alliance with the Soviet Union in view of Germany's effect on {{the balance of power in}} Europe.|$|E

[...] On the other hand, Knight's name spread among Singaporeans as the man who brought Adrian Lim to justice, boosting his career. [...] He handled more high-profile cases, and became the director of the Commercial Affairs Department in 1984.

500|$|The filmmakers {{reported}} receiving [...] "lots {{of cards}} and letters" [...] from the church, though {{in their case}} it had limited its response to [...] "loads of legal paperwork". HBO had earlier said that it had put [...] "probably 160 lawyers" [...] onto the task of reviewing the film in anticipation of challenges from the notoriously litigious church. Sheila Nevins of HBO commented that she <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> how aggressive the church had been. Not only did it effectively provide free advertising for the film, but its hostility had made HBO Documentary Films even more determined to produce the film: [...] "I thought, 'They really don't {{want us to do}} it.

[...] William Gerard Hamilton joined in and stated, [...] "He has made a chasm, which not only nothing can fill up, but which nothing {{has a tendency to}} fill up. -Johnson is dead.- Let us go to the next best: There is nobody; -no man can be said to put you in mind of Johnson." ...|$|E
500|$|Written by series creators Cheryl Heuton and Nicolas Falacci, {{the episode}} was filmed twice, once in Boston, Massachusetts {{and once in}} Los Angeles, California, with two {{different}} casts using two somewhat different scripts. The test audience <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> that the three men who portrayed the family {{could be related to}} each other, so the producers made cast changes to the family. [...] They also made several changes {{to the rest of the}} cast to accommodate the changes in the script. [...] Heuton and Falacci changed the script to focus on the brothers' relationship with each other. [...] When filming finished, CBS picked up the episode and the series three weeks later.|$|E
500|$|Despite this, when Caracciola socialised {{with the}} upper Nazi echelons {{he did so}} merely as an [...] "accessory", not as an active member, and at no time was he {{a member of the}} Nazi Party. According to his autobiography, he turned down a request from the NSKK in 1942 to {{entertain}} German troops, as he [...] "could not find it in myself to cheer up young men so that they would believe in a victory I myself <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> in". Caracciola lived in Switzerland from the early 1930s, and despite strict currency controls, his salary was paid in Swiss francs. During the war, he continued to receive a pension from Daimler-Benz, until the firm ceased his payments under pressure from the Nazi party in 1942.|$|E
