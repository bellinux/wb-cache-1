These are the Lex Cornelia De Sicariis, promulgated in the 80s BCE, and the Lex Pompeia de Parricidiis promulgated about 55 BCE. According to a 19th-century commentator, the relation between these two old laws might have been {{that it was the}} Lex Pompeia that specified the poena cullei (i.e., sewing the convict up in a sack and throwing him in the water) as the particular punishment for a parricide, because a direct reference to the [...] "Lex Cornelia" [...] shows that the typical punishment for a poisoner/assassin in general (rather than for the specific <b>crime</b> <b>of</b> <b>parricide)</b> was that of deportation/banishment, i.e., Lex Pompeia makes explicit distinctions for the <b>crime</b> <b>of</b> <b>parricide</b> not present in Lex Cornelia.|$|E

For that breach of religion, Tarquinius had him sewn up in a sack and thrown him on the sea.

40|$|Chapter One of {{this thesis}} explores the {{identity}} of the Eumenides, the resident deities in Sophocles' Oedipus at Colonus. By examining the language and contents of two important ritual acts in the play, it is proven that their title is euphemistic; these goddesses are the transformed Erinyes of Aeschylus. Oedipus and his sinfulness is the focus of Chapter Two. Although he has committed the heinous <b>crimes</b> <b>of</b> incest and <b>parricide,</b> Oedipus seems to be exempt from the Erinyes' hounding. By reviewing the charges laid against him, it is revealed that Oedipus is a morally innocent man. The final chapter deals with Oedipus' apotheosis and the role played by the Eumenides. By examining the play's dramatic action, it is demonstrated that Oedipus, a man of innate heroic nature, is deserving of heroization. But to reach his exalted end, the championship of the Eumenides is required...|$|R

When he returns home, he finds their dead bodies, a strange dagger and a whole host of angry villagers who blame him for killing his family. Rather than stay in the village and face a brutal crucifixion for the grave <b>crime</b> <b>of</b> <b>parricide,</b> Jiro escapes into the night with the dagger and meets with a buddhist monk called Tenkai who works for the Shogunate as an Oniwaban (Secret Police). Tenkai takes the boy face-to-face with the man who supposedly killed his family and gets him to deliver the killing blow. Afterwards, his entire village is set ablaze and the villagers slaughtered to cover up the incident. Tenkai then takes Jiro in at his temple on the island of Ezo, and has his subordinates Shingo and Sanpei train him in the ways of Ninja so that one day, he may learn of his father. Tenkai quickly dispatches Shingo to follow Jiro and make sure he stays to the same path as Tarouza, Jiro's late father.|$|E

40|$|INTRODUCTION Parricide {{is defined}} as a murder of parents by their children; the patricide is murder of father, while matricide is murder of mother. This entity is {{classified}} as homicide, but it differs in the fact that victims are parents and the killers are their children. Mostly, it is associated with psychiatric morbidity. OBJECTIVE To describe sociodemographic and psychopathological characteristics <b>of</b> <b>parricide</b> committers and to analyze circumstances <b>of</b> <b>parricide</b> and psychiatric morbidity in order to achieve better recognition and prevention of risks. METHOD This retrospective study included all homicide autopsy records (1991 - 2005) performed at the Institute of Forensic Medicine, Medical School, University of Belgrade. For further analyses, all parricide records were selected out. The study analyzed all available parameters, which concerned parricide committers, victims and the act itself. Methods of descriptive statistics were used. RESULTS Between 1991 and 2005, there were 948 cases of homicide; of these, 3. 5 % were <b>parricides.</b> The committers <b>of</b> <b>parricide</b> were on average 31. 2 ± 11. 9 years old, 87. 8 % were males, 60. 6 % with psychiatric symptoms most commonly with schizophrenia, alcohol dependence, personality disorder etc. Victims were on average 63. 7 ± 11. 9 years old, 54. 5 % males, and 21. 2 % had a diagnosed mental illness. CONCLUSION Parricide is a rare kind of homicide accounting for 3 % of all homicides. Committers are mostly unemployed males in early adulthood who have mental disorder. The phenomenon <b>of</b> <b>parricide</b> deserves a detailed analysis of the committer (individual bio-psycho-social profile) and the environ- mental factors (family, closely related circumstances) to enable a precise prediction of the act and prevention of the fatal outcome, which logically imposes the need of further studies...|$|R

40|$|The {{most famous}} {{play in the}} history of Irish theater, J. M. Synge’s The Playboy of the Western World has been oddly {{neglected}} in sociology and criminology. This article examines the provenance of the violence around which Playboy’s dizzying text swirls, namely, a tragicomic parricide seemingly twice committed. In particular, we ask: is the text plausible? Though Synge’s authorial intentions are not open to complete reclamation, we explore first, his self-stated reliance on the actual cases of William Maley and James Lynchehaun and, second, whether the representation(s) <b>of</b> <b>parricide</b> in Playboy more or less accurately reflected the presence and character <b>of</b> <b>parricide</b> at the time the controversial play was being imagined and first performed in 1907. The culture wars and associated media frenzy over the play provide an ever-looming backcloth against which to interpret the meanings of intergenerational violence in a colonial society lurching towards national self-determination...|$|R

40|$|In Chile, legally commits {{parricide}} the one that, {{knowing the}} relationships that binds them, kills his/her father, mother or child, {{or any other}} of his/her ascendants or descendants, or spouse or couple. It is a rare crime, being around 4 % of the homicides. The objective of this review is to characterize parricide psychiatrically, which is done basically using international literature. There are different profiles <b>of</b> <b>parricides</b> depending {{on the characteristics of}} the situation in which the crime is committed. The most frequent profile is that of a young male adult, with acute psychotic pathology, associated to drug and alcohol abuse. A second type is represented by adolescents in three situations: the severely abused child, the severely mentally ill child, and the dangerously antisocial child. To kill own children is a form <b>of</b> <b>parricide</b> as well, and there are differences between the psychiatric profiles of neonaticide, infanticide and filicide committers. Femicide is the murder of women committed by men on grounds of gender, and legally constitutes parricide. The most frequent is the intimate femicide, and it is associated with prior violence and drug and alcohol abuse. Parricide, even though it is an infrequent event, it is an important fact between psychiatric patients, being, in consequence, very relevant for the psychiatrist and mental health workers, the knowledge of this issue...|$|R

While both lunacy and the cruelty of parents were understood as possible contexts for parricide, neither were common. The dominant explanation was the gratuitous violence of a selfish individual who lacked compassion and who saw the parent as an obstacle—to an inheritance, riches, marriage, and freedom—to be removed. The article explores these three categories and suggests ways in which this began to change in the mid-eighteenth century...|$|R
