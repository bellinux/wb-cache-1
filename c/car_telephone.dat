5000|$|The {{force of}} the {{explosion}} was powerful enough to launch a mining <b>car,</b> <b>telephone</b> poles, and other equipment across the canyon, a distance of nearly {{a mile from the}} entrance to the mine. [...] The steel gates of the mine were ripped from their concrete foundations. Inside the mine, rails were twisted, roof supports were destroyed, afterdamp and coal dust filled the air, and the lamps of the surviving miners were blown out. As these men attempted to relight their lamps, a second explosion was sparked, killing the remainder of the workers in the mine. A third explosion occurred approximately 20 minutes later, causing a destructive cave-in.|$|E

Among his misdeeds were allowing {{two of his}} sons to travel to [...] "idolatrous lands" [...] (Faysal to England. Saud to Egypt); allowing (what they believed to be) idolatrous nomads from Iraq and Transjordan to pasture their animals in [...] "the abode of Islam"; leniency towards Shiites; the introduction of modern inventions (<b>car,</b> <b>telephone</b> and telegraph); and (what they considered) illegal taxation of nomadic tribes. Ibn Saud attempted to mollify the Ikhwan by submitting their accusations to the religious scholars ('ulama'), who agreed {{on the need for}} more strict policies towards non-sunni subjects, but also affirmed that only the ruler (Ibn Saud) had the right to declare jihad.|$|E

40|$|Current {{use case}} {{guidelines}} typically recommend a goal-driven process for use case creation and, in many cases, this approach indeed works sufficiently well. Yet, in our experience, this goal-driven approach {{does not seem}} to offer the best fit for every kind of function, e. g. for highly context-sensitive automotive driver assistance systems. For these functions we suggest selecting a context-driven process for use case creation. In this paper we first show the effectiveness of goal-driven use case creation for a usual <b>car</b> <b>telephone</b> function. Then we demonstrate the limits of this approach for an adaptive vehicle cruise control function (the Distronic system). Finally we present our basic ideas of a context-driven use case creation process and evidence its advantages as compared to the goal-driven approach using the example of the Distronic function. 1...|$|E
40|$|Each year, {{dozens of}} reports {{containing}} suggestions for measures to improve road safety are {{published by the}} SWOV Institute for Road Safety Research. Some of these recommendations are based on SWOV research, other ones on accident analyses and/or literature research. This note gives an overview of SWOV recommendations which have not yet come into realisation and/or preparation within Dutch road safety policy, but are still of current interest. The overview is based on publications since 1994, and is thematically grouped around `vehicles' and `behaviour of road users'. The vehicle category includes the following: bicycles; mopeds and low-speed mopeds (In Dutch: "snorfietsen"); motorcycles; passenger cars; vans; heavy vehicles; agricultural vehicles; and telematics. The road users' behaviour category contains the following aspects: general and special speed limits; publicity along the road and road safety; alcohol use; drugs; <b>car</b> <b>telephone,</b> older people; traffic education; driver training; and rewarding desired traffic behaviour...|$|E

40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this article}} were to compare the variance explained in anthropometric outcomes when using individual measures of socioeconomic status (SES) versus different approaches to create SES indices within the urban African context, and to examine the influence of SES measured during infancy on child anthropometric outcomes at 7 / 8 years. Data from the 1990 Birth-to-Twenty cohort study set in Johannesburg-Soweto, South Africa, were used (n = 888). Linear regression models were used to investigate the association between SES (individual and index measures) during infancy and anthropometric measures at age 7 / 8 years, controlling for sex, age, and population group. Both individual and index measures of SES explained similar proportions of the variance for each anthropometric outcome. SES measured during infancy influenced weight more than height at age 7 / 8 years in Johannesburg-Soweto. Positive associations were found between SES and the anthropometric measures [...] ownership of a <b>car,</b> <b>telephone,</b> and having an inside flush toilet were the most significant SES variables. The similarities observed in the variance explained relating to the anthropometric outcomes suggest that researchers who want to adjust for SES in analyses could use an SES index to make statistical models more parsimonious. However, using such indices loses information relating to the specific socioeconomic factors that are important for explaining child anthropometrics. If {{the purpose of the}} research is to make policy recommendations for the improvement of child growth, individual SES variables would provide more specific information to target interventions...|$|E
40|$|An aging {{population}} has {{lead to increased}} demand for health-care and an interest in moving health care services from the hospital to the home to reduce the burden on society. One enabling technology is comfortable monitoring and sensing of bio-signals. Sensors can be embedded in objects that people interact with daily such as a computer, chair, bed, toilet, <b>car,</b> <b>telephone</b> or any portable personal electronic device. Moreover, the relatively recent and wide availability of microelectronics that provide the capabilities of embedded software, open access wireless protocols and long battery life has led many research groups to develop wearable, wireless bio-sensor systems that are worn on the body and integrated into clothing. These systems are capable of interaction with other devices that are nowadays commonly in our possession such as a mobile phone, laptop, PDA or smart multifunctional MP 3 player. The development of systems for wireless bio-medical long term monitoring is leading to personal monitoring, not just for medical reasons, but also for enhancing personal awareness and monitoring self-performance, as with sports-monitoring for athletes. These developments also provide a foundation for the Brain Computer Interface (BCI) that aims to directly monitor brain signals {{in order to control}} or manipulate external objects. This provides a new communication channel to the brain that does not require activation of muscles and nerves. This innovative and exciting research field is in need of reliable and easy to use long term recording systems (EEG). In particular we highlight the development and broad applications of our own circuits for wearable bio-potential sensor systems enabled by the use of an amplifier circuit with sufficiently high impedance to allow the use of passive dry electrodes which overcome the significant barrier of gel based contacts...|$|E

50|$|The Germania Cornet Band {{folded in}} the early 1920s. Around the nation, {{the heyday of the}} {{community}} brass band was drawing to a close as phonographs, movies, and radio provided new ways to hear music, and the advent of <b>cars,</b> <b>telephones,</b> and better roads reduced the isolation of rural communities. However these same factors eased the creation of rural community clubs, and the newly-formed Germania Community Club took on a key role in local social life. Throughout the 1930s the club sponsored educational lectures, talent shows, and spelling bees at the hall. They also organized a popular annual picnic that typically included music, dancing, speeches, food concessions, and sporting contests such as races, horseshoes, wrestling, boxing, tug-of-war, and baseball.|$|R
