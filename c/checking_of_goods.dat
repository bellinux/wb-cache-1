40|$|This {{graduation}} project focusses on {{an isolated}} former industrial area in Pantin, a suburb {{just outside of}} Paris. The urban goal is to connect the isolated and neglected site {{to the city of}} Pantin. On the site a former warehouse for the <b>checking</b> <b>of</b> <b>goods</b> by the Parisian customs is situated. This building needs to be transformed for a new use. This is done by transforming the building into a hybrid building which accomodates housing, working and learning. A small city in which different users and functions have a chance to meet and to connect. The emphasis is therefor on collectivity between the different functions, separate functions and users. The story of Esmeralda by Italo Calvino forms the inspiration for the architecture, in which the former and proposed new use come together.

40|$|This study aims to {{describe}} the characteristic of OAQM fund policy at SMA Negeri 3 Salatiga, and {{to describe}} the use of OAQM fund at SMA Negeri 3 Salatiga. This study is a qualitative study using ethnography design. The study is done at SMA Negeri 3 Salatiga. The informant includes the principal and OAQM committee. Data collection method of this research paper uses in-depth interview, observation, and documentation. Data analysis uses an interactive model of analysis started by data reduction, data display, and drawing conclusion. Data validity includes the credibility, transferability, dependability, and confirmability. This study has two findings. The first finding concludes that the OAQM fund policy has four characteristics. The first characteristic is that the policy is started by the formation of OAQM committee which is formed and selected by the school board and the principal based on the principals decree. The structure of the committee in the OAQM management consists of the responsible person, leader, secretary, treasurer, and the responsible person of the program. The second characteristic includes the preparation of OAQM fund submission proposal which {{is done by the}} OAQM committee. The third characteristic of OAQM fund policy is that the determination of OAQM program is through SWOT analysis, in which each program has its responsible person and has a role based on their duties. And the last characteristic of OAQM fund policy is that the committee and the principal prepare the budget plan or OAQM. The second finding shows that the use of OAQM fund is relevant to the budget or OAQM programs which have been set. Those programs include the new students’ recruitment activity, the daily test or learning evaluation, the remedial activity or students’ enrichment, the implementation of learning process, and office supplies. The use of OAQM fund is done by the principles of accountable, transparent, democratic, effective and efficient, orderly administrative and reporting, self-management, participatory and mutual trust. The use of fund for the procurement of goods is accompanied by the administration and special reporting in the form of work order, official report of the procurement and <b>checking</b> <b>of</b> <b>goods.</b> The accountability for the use of fund is done {{in the form of the}} preparation of report by the OAQM committee...|$|E

40|$|We {{propose a}} model and an {{estimation}} technique to distinguish systemic risk and contagion in credit risk. The main idea is to assume, {{for a set of}} $d$ obligors, a set of $d$ idiosyncratic shocks and a shock that triggers the default of all them. All shocks are assumed to be linked by a dependence relationship, that in this paper is assumed to be exchangeable and Archimedean. This approach is able to encompass both systemic risk and contagion, with the Marshall-Olkin pure systemic risk model and the Archimedean contagion model as extreme cases. Moreover, we show that assuming an affine structure for the intensities of idiosyncratic and systemic shocks and a Gumbel copula, the approach delivers a complete multivariate distribution with exponential marginal distributions. The model can be estimated by applying a moment matching procedure to the bivariate marginals. We also provide an easy visual <b>check</b> <b>of</b> the <b>good</b> specification <b>of</b> the model. The model is applied to a selected sample of banks for 8 European countries, assuming a common shock for every country. The model is found to be well specified for 4 of the 8 countries.
