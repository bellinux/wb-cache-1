40|$|Myeloperoxidase (MPO), an {{abundant}} enzyme in phagocytes, has {{been implicated in}} the pathogenesis of various inflammatory diseases including atherosclerosis. The major oxidant produced by MPO, hypochlorous acid (HOCl), is able to modify {{a great variety of}} biomolecules by chlorination and/or oxidation. In this paper the reactions of lipids (preferentially unsaturated fatty acids and cholesterol) with either reagent HOCl or HOCl generated by the MPO-hydrogen peroxide-chloride system are reviewed. One of the major issues has been whether the reaction of HOCl with lipids of low density lipoprotein (LDL) yields predominantly <b>chlorohydrins</b> or lipid hydroperoxides. Electrospray mass spectrometry provided direct evidence that <b>chlorohydrins</b> rather than peroxides are the major products of HOCl- or MPO-treated LDL phosphatidylcholines. Nevertheless lipid peroxidation is a possible alternative reaction of HOCl with polyunsaturated fatty acids if an additional radical source such as pre-formed lipid hydroperoxides is available. In phospholipids carrying a primary amino group such as phosphatidylethanolamine chloramines are the preferred products compared to <b>chlorohydrins.</b> Cholesterol can be converted by HOCl to great variety of oxysterols besides three isomers of <b>chlorohydrins.</b> For the situation in vivo it appears that the type of reaction occurring between HOCl and lipids would very much depend on the circumstances, e. g. the pH and the presence of radical initiators.

40|$|In the {{synthesis}} of biodiesel via the transesterification of vegetable oils, 10 wt[*]% of glycerol is obtained as byproduct. This means that, by increasing the biodiesel production, the glycerol availability also increases and its cost goes down more and more. In order to consume {{the large amount of}} glycerol derived from biodiesel production in a profitable way, only two strategies are possible: (i) use glycerol as raw material to produce fuel additives and (ii) use glycerol as raw material to produce commodities. In the present work, we have briefly considered the first aspect while focusing, in particular, on the second opportunity by reviewing the production of <b>chlorohydrins</b> by glycerol hydrochlorination with HCl. <b>Chlorohydrins</b> are important intermediates in the production of epichlorohydrin used to produce epoxy–resins.
