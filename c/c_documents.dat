40|$|Abstract: An {{important}} part of the European cultural heritage is composed of hand-written documents. Many of these documents were drawn up with iron-gall ink. This type of ink present a serious conservation problem, as it slowly oxidizes ('burns') the paper it is written on, thereby gradually disintegrating the historic document. Acid hydrolysis of the cellulose and/or the oxidation of organic compounds promoted by radical intermediates that are formed due to the presence of Fe 2 + ions are considered to be the cause of the disintegration. mu-XANES measurements were performed with a lateral resolution of 30 - 50 mum {{in order to determine the}} local Fe 2 +/Fe 3 + ratio in 19 th <b>C.</b> <b>documents</b> from the Austrian National Archives and fragments of 16 th <b>C</b> <b>documents</b> from the Polish National Library.

40|$|This is {{the fifth}} {{in a series of}} {{articles}} on ontology-based approaches to modeling. The main focus is on popular ontology languages proposed for the Semantic Web, such as the Resource Description Framework (RDF), RDF Schema (RDFS), and the Web Ontology Language (OWL). OWL is based on description logic. A later series of articles will explore other logic-based languages such as datalog. The first article [3] introduced ontologies and the Semantic Web, and covered basic concepts in the Resource Description Framework (RDF), contrasting them with other data modeling approaches. The second article [4] discussed the N 3 notation for RDF, and covered the basics of RDF Schema. The third article [5] provided further coverage of RDFS, and introduced different flavors of the Web Ontology language (OWL). The fourth article [6] discussed basic features of OWL, mainly using Manchester syntax. The current article explores OWL in more depth.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{collective}} case study {{was to understand the}} successes, challenges, and lessons learned when secondary school administrators implement job-embedded professional development to change the teaching and learning of 21 st century skills. The theories guiding this study were Lev Vygotsky’s social constructivist paradigm, Malcolm Knowles’ adult learning, Abraham Maslow’s hierarchy of needs, and the Partnership for 21 st Century Skills (P 21) framework. Four Virginia secondary schools were studied. Based on the research questions, there were four data-gathering methods for this study: (a) focus groups, (b) individual semi-structured interviews, (<b>c)</b> <b>documents,</b> timelines, and budgets, and (d) researcher’s memos and journal. All data collected were coded and organized into themes. In-case and cross-case analyses provided a thorough description and understanding of the problem. After a review of the results gathered from the three teachers and the administrators at each of the four school sites, a collection of data generated recommendations for school administrators on ways to implement 21 st century skills in their schools. The findings revealed successful practices, challenges, and lessons learned for school administrators to consider when developing a plan to implement job-embedded professional development for 21 st century skills. Two main implications suggested for administrators were to review the information provided on the successful practices shared and to examine the lessons learned presented by the participants from this study. Further research is needed to compare high-performing schools against low-performing schools; schools from differing geographical locations, demographics, and grade levels; leadership impact; and standardized test results...|$|E

The cores span water depths from about 400 to 3000 m and intersect the major water masses in this region. These new data fill a critical {{gap in the}} South Atlantic Ocean and provide the motivation for updating the classic glacial western Atlantic d 13 C transect of Duplessy et al. (1988). The distribution of 13 C of SumCO 2 requires the presence of three distinct water masses in the glacial Atlantic Ocean: a shallow (~ 1000 m), southern source water mass with an end-member d 13 C value of about 0. 3 - 0. 5 per mil VPDB, a middepth (~ 1500 m), northern source water mass with an end-member value of about 1. 5 per mil, and a deep (> 2000 m), southern source water with an end-member value of less than - 0. 2 per mil, and perhaps as low as the - 0. 9 per mil values observed in the South Atlantic sector of the Southern Ocean (Ninnemann and Charles, 2002, doi: 10. 1016 /S 0012 - 821 X(02) 00708 - 2).

40|$|The Pseudomonas aeruginosa plasmid pKLC 102 coexists as a plasmid and a genome {{island in}} clone C strains. Whereas the related plasmid pKLK 106 {{reversibly}} recombines with P. aeruginosa clone K chromosomes {{at one of}} the two tRNALys genes, pKLC 102 is incorporated into the tRNALys gene only close to the pilA locus. Targeting of the other tRNALys copy in the chromosome is blocked by a 23, 395 -bp mosaic of truncated PAO open reading frames, transposons, and pKLC 102 homologs. Annotation and phylogenetic analysis of the large 103, 532 -bp pKLC 102 sequence revealed that pKLC 102 is a hybrid of plasmid and phage origin. The plasmid lineage conferred oriV and genes for replication, partitioning, and conjugation, including a pil cluster encoding type IV thin sex pili and an 8, 524 -bp chvB glucan synthetase gene that is known to be a major determinant for host tropism and virulence. The phage lineage conferred integrase, att, and a syntenic set of conserved hypothetical genes also observed in the tRNAGly-associated genome islands of P. aeruginosa clone C chromosomes. In subgroup C isolates from patients with cystic fibrosis, pKLC 102 was irreversibly fixed into the chromosome by the insertion of the large 23, 061 -bp class I transposon TNCP 23, which is a composite of plasmid, integron, and IS 6100 elements.

It cannot be separated with the figure of teacher as the educator. The high demand itself has strong impacts toward some actions taken by the headmaster of SMK Kesehatan Bakti Indonesia Medika Ngawi in order to upgrade the teacher’s professionalisms. This study uses data collection method as follows: a) deep interview, b) participants observation, and <b>c)</b> <b>documents</b> analysis. Then the collected data through these three methodologies are organized, interpreted, and analyzed deeper to arrange concept and abstraction of the finding result. In the case of the headmaster’s leadership efforts in the managerial aspects to increase the professionalism of the teachers, the writer found some plans of action done by the headmasters for example: conducting workshop and supervision programs, optimizing teachers’ discussion forums (MGMP), and organizing family recreation for fun.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} my {{research}} is to conduct an ethnographic case study of a program change and implementation. The researcher designed and piloted a full-day, alternate day kindergarten program. Few {{studies have been conducted}} in this area and none from an ethographic case study approach with the researcher as participant-observer. ^ The methodology used for the study was that of participant-observer. The collection of data occurred over a period of one year. Data was collected by the following means: interview, observations, recorded verbal and written communications with staff members and parents, parent meetings, parent surveys, examination of attendance records, documentation of telephone messages, tape recordings, and field notes. ^ The study: (A) Describes the program and details its implementation. (B) Focuses on what happens when a school district attempts to gain permission from the Department of Education to conduct a pilot program. (<b>C)</b> <b>Documents</b> the reactions of staff, parents, students and community members when a program is changed. (D) Offers concrete suggestions for implementing a full-day, alternate day kindergarten. ^ Upon reviewing {{the findings of this study}} and the following conclusions can be drawn: (1) The overwhelming majority of parents who had children involved in the study perceived changes in their child to be of a positive nature. (2) Parents liked the flexibility that the full-day, alternate day schedule gave them personally. (3) Teacher and staff attitude affected the acceptance of this method for scheduling kindergarten. (4) Administrative support and encouragement aided in teacher and staff attitude. (5) Very few curricular changes were needed to implement a full-day, alternate day schedule. Permitting teachers to make these changes proved positive. (6) To appease parents and community members, the researcher suggests only beginning the full-day, alternate day method of scheduling during the second semester of the school year. (7) The full-day, alternate day schedule aids in the transition of students from kindergarten to first grade. (8) A cost savings could be realized by eliminating the mid-day bus run. The amount of savings varies with conditions. ...|$|E

Identified external supports were (a) financial support, (b) an expert to present information at the outset, (c) a consultant to address concerns as they arose during implementation, and (d) administrative support. Internal supports they acknowledged as necessary were (a) a gathering place for ongoing interaction during the change process, (b) a pilot group which modeled portfolio implementation, (c) a collegial group open to change and willing to work collaboratively toward that end, and (d) personal investment from every participant. ^ Also they described the shift to maintaining documentation of students 2 ̆ 7 growth as writers and to assessing a collection of student writing in progress rather than as isolated documents. They perceived that the role of the teacher in their portfolio program was altered from teacher as evaluator to teacher as collaborator. ^ The reported successful accommodation of a department-wide portfolio program provides ideas for change agents from classroom teachers to administrators to legislators wishing to introduce portfolios into the curriculum. Further research in the successful accommodation of portfolios would aid not only schools moving toward mandatory or voluntary portfolio use, but also in the implementation of future educational innovative practices. ...|$|E
40|$|We have {{generated}} a 49 -year-long, high-resolution, stable isotope record from a fossil coral, Solenastrea bournoni, to evaluate regional sea surface conditions {{during the middle}} Pliocene (3. 0 +/- 0. 5 Ma) in southwest Florida. Continuous routing of the coral slab at an interval of 0. 76 mm produced similar to 5 to 6 samples per year. The annual cycle is well defined in delta(18) O and delta(13) C records confirming the average yearly growth rate estimated from density banding of 4 to 5 mm/yr. High-density bands are synchronous with the highest delta(18) O and delta(13) C values for 79 % and 45 % of the annual cycles recorded, respectively. The annual range in delta(18) O is 0. 70 to 2. 27 parts per thousand and in delta(13) C it is 0. 31 to 2. 21 parts per thousand. Partitioning of the coral delta(18) O signal into sea surface temperature (SST) changes and delta(18) O(water) changes is difficult to estimate in the ancient. However, isotopic mass-balance calculations, using modern climate data, suggest a partitioning of the delta(18) O signal into and to 12 % salinity and 92 to 88 % temperature at the sea surface. If 100 % of the delta(18) O variation is attributed to temperature, the observed mean annual range in delta(18) O (mean = 1. 54 +/- 0. 37 parts per thousand) corresponds to a seasonal SST range of similar to 7. 0 +/- 1. 7 degrees C (0. 22 parts per thousand/ 1 degrees C), which is a mean of 3. 5 degrees C {{less than that of}} the present day. Isotope data are consistent with the hypothesis that delta(13) C values covary with the number of sunshine hours. Annually, peak delta(18) O values are often observed to precede peak delta(13) C values by one sample (i. e., about 2 months). We infer from the isotope pattern that periods of reduced SST were followed about 2 months later by periods of increased number of sunshine hours. This seasonal pattern {{is similar to that of}} southwest Florida today. Cross-spectral analysis of fossil coral delta(18) O and delta(13) <b>C</b> <b>documents</b> coherency peaks, above the 95 % confidence interval, at annual and subdecadal frequencies (1. 0, 1. 6, 2. 9 and 5 year). The spectral phase angle between delta(18) O and delta(13) C at the annual frequency is - 60 +/- 10 degrees, at the 95 % confidence interval. The temporal equivalent of this angle is approximately 2 months, which confirms visual observations of seasonality from the isotope pattern...|$|E
