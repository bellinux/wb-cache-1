40|$|To {{identify}} {{patterns of}} stability and change in <b>co-occurrence</b> in children between 5 - 11 years, and to assess if they vary by socio-demographic factors. Data from 9548 singleton children from the UK Millennium Cohort Study (MCS) were assessed for <b>co-occurrence</b> of five common adverse conditions: wheeze; longstanding illness; unfavorable weight; injury; and socio-emotional difficulties. We summed adverse conditions (0 - 5) for each child at ages 5, 7, and 11 and identified <b>co-occurrence</b> (≥ 2 conditions). Using multinomial regression, we explored associations between <b>co-occurrence</b> trajectories and child's sex and ethnicity, maternal education, and income quintile. 45. 6 % of children experienced <b>co-occurrence</b> between 5 - 11 years (7 % experienced constant <b>co-occurrence).</b> More children moved into <b>co-occurrence</b> than moved out (16. 9 vs. 11. 9 %). Mutually-adjusted relative risk ratios (aRRR) showed a gradient by maternal education: compared to children with no <b>co-occurrence</b> whose mothers had a higher/degree, children whose mothers had no qualifications {{were more likely to}} move into (aRRR = 1. 32 (95 %CI: 1. 02, 1. 70)), out of (1. 74 (1. 34, 2. 26)), have fluctuating (1. 52 (1. 09, 2. 10)) or constant <b>co-occurrence</b> (2. 58 (1. 76, 3. 80)).

40|$|<b>Co-occurrence</b> {{patterns}} {{are used in}} ecology to explore interactions between organisms and environmental effects on coexistence within biological communities. Analysis of <b>co-occurrence</b> patterns among microbial communities has ranged from simple pairwise comparisons between all community members to direct hypothesis testing between focal species. However, <b>co-occurrence</b> {{patterns are}} rarely studied across multiple ecosystems or multiple scales of biological organization within the same study. Here we outline an approach to produce <b>co-occurrence</b> analyses that are focused at three different scales: <b>co-occurrence</b> patterns between ecosystems at the community scale, modules of co-occurring microorganisms within communities, and co-occurring pairs within modules that are nested within microbial communities. To demonstrate our <b>co-occurrence</b> analysis approach, we gathered publicly available 16 S rRNA amplicon datasets to compare and contrast microbial <b>co-occurrence</b> at different taxonomic levels across different ecosystems. We found differences in community composition and <b>co-occurrence</b> that reflect environmental filtering at the community scale and consistent pairwise occurrences {{that may be used}} to infer ecological traits about poorly understood microbial taxa.

40|$|We {{propose a}} method to extract image {{features}} based on effective higher-order cooccurrences. The proposed method constructs the co-clusters to discriminatively quantize joint primitive quantitative data, such as pair-wise pixel intensities, unlike the standard <b>co-occurrence</b> methods that utilize simple clusters trained in an unsupervised manner for quantizing point-wise data. The discriminative co-clusters effectively exploit the <b>co-occurrence</b> characteristics even by a fewer number of cluster components, resulting in low-dimensional <b>co-occurrence</b> features. By taking advantage of those discriminative co-clusters, the <b>co-occurrence</b> features can be extended to the higher-order <b>co-occurrence</b> features of feasible dimensionality. The higher-order <b>co-occurrence</b> captures richer information in image textures by extracting relationships in multiplets more than only doublets (pairs).

The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine patterns of <b>co-occurrence</b> among individuals of different Neotropical bat fly species. After establishing patterns of <b>co-occurrence,</b> tests on whether variation in fly morphology was linked to observed patterns of <b>co-occurrence</b> were performed. <b>Co-occurrence</b> patterns were determined using null model analyses, and a predominant pattern of aggregation was detected. To examine the relationship between <b>co-occurrence</b> and morphology, geometric morphometric analyses were performed to compare morphologies of co-occurring individuals of different species. Examination of ratios of species-pairs with significant differences in their morphology relative to speciespairs without significant differences resulted in both insight and more questions. Species segregation may result from morphological similarity between co-occurring streblid species, potentially reflecting historical niche overlap leading to competitive exclusion of one species from infesting the host individual. Aggregation of multiple streblid species however, does not appear to be due to differences in morphology. Results also indicate that explanations of <b>co-occurrence</b> patterns are not straightforward, and that multiple mechanisms may underlie patterns of <b>co-occurrence.</b> These results underscore important potential connections between morphology and patterns of <b>co-occurrence,</b> but future research is needed to verify these conclusions and examine other possible contributing mechanisms to patterns of <b>co-occurrence</b> in this biological system...|$|R

40|$|Background: <b>Co-occurrence</b> {{analysis}} {{is a technique}} often applied in text mining, comparative genomics, and promoter analysis. The methodologies and statistical models {{used to evaluate the}} significance of association between co-occurring entities are quite diverse, however. Methodology/Principal Findings: We present a general framework for <b>co-occurrence</b> analysis based on a bipartite graph representation of the data, a novel <b>co-occurrence</b> statistic, and software performing <b>co-occurrence</b> analysis as well as generation and analysis of <b>co-occurrence</b> networks. We show that the overall stringency of <b>co-occurrence</b> analysis depends critically on the choice of the null-model used to evaluate the significance of <b>co-occurrence</b> and find that random sampling from a complete permutation set of the bipartite graph permits <b>co-occurrence</b> analysis with optimal stringency. We show that the Poisson-binomial distribution is the most natural <b>co-occurrence</b> probability distribution when vertex degrees of the bipartite graph are variable, which is usually the case. Calculation of Poisson-binomial P-values is difficult, however. Therefore, we propose a fast bi-binomial approximation for calculation of P-values and show that this statistic is superior to other measures of association such as the Jaccard coefficient and the uncertainty coefficient. Furthermore, <b>co-occurrence</b> analysis of more than two entities can be performed using the same statistical model, which leads to increased signal-tonoise ratios, robustness towards noise, and the identification of implicit relationships between co-occurring entities. Using NetCutter, we identify a novel protein biosynthesis related set of genes that are frequently coordinately deregulated in human cancer related gene expression studies.

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} method of feature <b>co-occurrence</b> {{representation}} based on boosting for object detection. A previously proposed method that combines multiple binaryclassified codes by AdaBoost to represent the <b>co-occurrence</b> of features {{has been shown to}} be effective in face detection. However, if an input feature is difficult to be assigned to a correct binary code due to occlusion or other factors, a problem arises here since the process of binary classification and <b>co-occurrence</b> representation may combine features that include an erroneous code. In response to this problem, this paper proposes a <b>Co-occurrence</b> Probability Feature (CPF) that combines multiple weak classifiers by addition and multiplication arithmetic operators using Real AdaBoost in which the outputs of weak classifiers are real values. Since CPF combines classifiers using two types of operators, diverse types of <b>co-occurrence</b> can be represented and improved detection performance can be expected. To represent even more diversified <b>co-occurrence,</b> this paper also proposes <b>co-occurrence</b> representation that applies a subtraction arithmetic operator. Although cooccurrence representation using addition and multiplication operators can represent <b>co-occurrence</b> between features, use of the subtraction operator enables the representation of <b>co-occurrence</b> between local features and features having other properties. This should have the effect of revising the probability of the detection-target class obtained from local features. Evaluation experiments have shown cooccurrence representation by the proposed methods to be effective. 1...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Determining the {{function}} of uncharacterized proteins is a major challenge in the post-genomic era due to the problem's complexity and scale. Identifying a protein's function contributes {{to an understanding of}} its role in the involved pathways, its suitability as a drug target, and its potential for protein modifications. Several graph-theoretic approaches predict unidentified functions of proteins by using {{the function}}al annotations of better-characterized proteins in protein-protein interaction networks. We systematically consider the use of literature <b>co-occurrence</b> data, introduce a new method for quantifying the reliability of <b>co-occurrence</b> and test how performance differs across species. We also quantify changes in performance as the prediction algorithms annotate with increased specificity. Results We find that including information on the <b>co-occurrence</b> of proteins within an abstract greatly boosts performance in the Functional Flow graph-theoretic function prediction algorithm in yeast, fly and worm. This increase in performance is not simply due to the presence of additional edges since supplementing protein-protein interactions with <b>co-occurrence</b> data outperforms supplementing with a comparably-sized genetic interaction dataset. Through the combination of protein-protein interactions and <b>co-occurrence</b> data, the neighborhood around unknown proteins is quickly connected to well-characterized nodes which global prediction algorithms can exploit. Our method for quantifying <b>co-occurrence</b> reliability shows superior performance to the other methods, particularly at threshold values around 10 % which yield the best trade off between coverage and accuracy. In contrast, the traditional way of asserting <b>co-occurrence</b> when at least one abstract mentions both proteins proves to be the worst method for generating <b>co-occurrence</b> data, introducing too many false positives. Annotating the functions with greater specificity is harder, but <b>co-occurrence</b> data still proves beneficial. Conclusion <b>Co-occurrence</b> data is a valuable supplemental source for graph-theoretic function prediction algorithms. A rapidly growing literature corpus ensures that <b>co-occurrence</b> data is a readily-available resource for nearly every studied organism, particularly those with small protein interaction databases. Though arguably biased toward known genes, <b>co-occurrence</b> data provides critical additional links to well-studied regions in the interaction network that graph-theoretic function prediction algorithms can exploit. </p...|$|R
50|$|By way of definition, <b>co-occurrence</b> {{networks}} are the collective interconnection of terms {{based on their}} paired presence within a specified unit of text. Networks are generated by connecting pairs of terms using a set of criteria defining <b>co-occurrence.</b> For example, terms A and B {{may be said to}} “co-occur” if they both appear in a particular article. Another article may contain terms B and C. Linking A to B and B to C creates a <b>co-occurrence</b> network of these three terms.

5000|$|The main {{hypothesis}} of co-occurrence graphs {{assumes that the}} semantics of a word can be represented {{by means of a}} co-occurrence graph, whose vertices are <b>co-occurrences</b> and edges are co-occurrence relations.

HyperLex is the successful approaches of a graph algorithm, based on the identification of hubs in co-occurrence graphs, which have to cope with the need to tune a large number of parameters. To deal with this issue several graph-based algorithms have been proposed, which are based on simple graph patterns, namely Curvature Clustering, Squares, Triangles and Diamonds (SquaT++), and Balanced Maximum Spanning Tree Clustering (B-MST). The patterns aim at identifying meanings using the local structural properties of the co-occurrence graph. A randomized algorithm which partitions the graph vertices by iteratively transferring the mainstream message (i.e. word sense) to neighboring vertices is Chinese Whispers. By applying co-occurrence graphs approaches have been shown to achieve the state-of-the-art performance in standard evaluation tasks.|$|E
