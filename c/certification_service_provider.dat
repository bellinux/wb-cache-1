40|$|Abstract. Despite a legal {{framework}} being {{in place for}} several years, the market share of qualified electronic signatures is disappointingly low. Mobile Signatures provide a new and promising opportunity for the deployment of an infrastructure for qualified electronic signatures. We analyzed two possible signing approaches (server based and client based signatures) and conclude that SIM-based signatures are the most secure and convenient solution. However, using the SIM-card as a secure signature creation device (SSCD) raises new challenges, because it would contain the user’s private key {{as well as the}} subscriber identification. Combining both functions in one card raises the question who will have the control over the keys and certificates. We propose a protocol called Certification on Demand (COD) that separates <b>certification</b> <b>services</b> from subscriber identification information and allows consumers to choose their appropriate <b>certification</b> <b>services</b> and <b>service</b> <b>providers</b> based on their needs. We also present some of the constraints that still have to be addressed before qualified mobile signatures are possible. ...|$|R

In addition to third party compliance <b>certification,</b> many <b>service</b> <b>providers</b> use enumeration to claim their completeness. The problem with enumerations is that they do not provide a measure of completeness and lack a conceptual model of how the requirements relate to each other and to the system.|$|R

The nation has enacted three E-commerce statutes: (1) the Electronic Signature Law (“ESL”) is third-generation with no exclusions from coverage, and contains an extensive list of penalties for <b>Certification</b> <b>Service</b> <b>Providers</b> (“CSP”) who violate the ESL or other laws; (2) the E-Commerce Law (“ECL”) is distinguished {{by the fact that}} consent of all parties is not required to have a valid E-contract, its provisions pertinent to out-of-court settlement as well as court action, and a range of civil and criminal penalties provided for unlawful E-commerce sellers; and (3) the Cyber-Crime Law establishes a list of computer crimes relating to crime prevention, data confidentiality, computer tampering and online child pornography. Those statutes provide a satisfactory legal foundation for Romanian E-commerce, but they need to be calibrated and supplemented. Recommended changes and additions to Romanian E-commerce law include: (1) enactment of a comprehensive Electronic Transactions Law which will incorporate all laws pertinent to E-commerce, including E-contract rules; (2) recognition of the validity of the electronic form in compliance with several additional requirements of other statutes, including notarization; (3) addition of rules for electronic automated contracts and electronic carriage contracts; (4) more consumer protections for E-buyers; (5) establishment of Information Technology. Courts for resolution of E-commerce disputes; (6) creation of long-arm jurisdiction over foreign E-commerce parties; (7) designation of the Romanian Post Office as an accredited CSP; (8) adoption of a National ID Card containing a digital signature which can be activated by an accredited CSP, including the Post Office; and (9) enactment of a new computer crime, Intentional Injection of a Virus into a Computer System, with onerous penalties for offenders...|$|R

Our first argument is that private and public actors of the transport and energy systems need to share the same image of the future transport system to anticipate, but more importantly to create future transport and energy markets and demand what is necessary for such a transition. Secondly, the system actors need to widen their scope from linear value chain thinking (e.g., [7 – 9]) to a transition-oriented network approach.
