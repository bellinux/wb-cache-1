5|$|A {{key element}} related to battles is demon negotiation, {{the process by}} which new demons are invited to join the Protagonist and <b>can</b> fight {{alongside}} them. The majority of demons <b>can</b> be talked to in battle by the Protagonist, and some allied demons. After selecting the option to talk, the player selects a demon, which initiates a negotiation. For those demons who <b>can</b> talk, the responses vary by both situation and a demon's temperament: some demons <b>can</b> be bribed with Macca and items, some will ask questions related to subjects like philosophy, while others <b>can</b> be influenced by the Protagonist's skills of flattery or eloquence. A negotiation <b>can</b> fail if the wrong responses are chosen, if the Protagonist's demon roster is full, or if another enemy demon interrupts. When in the party, demons <b>can</b> be summoned or dismissed from battle. The level of assigned Magatama <b>can</b> also affect how negotiation goes.|$|E

50|$|The use of <b>cans</b> by craft brewers in the US {{has doubled}} since 2012, with over 500 {{companies}} using <b>cans</b> to package their beverages.

40|$|The {{effects of}} socio-demographic factors on {{consumer}} ratings of product attributes of an experimental <b>canned</b> bighead product were analyzed. OLS techniques {{were used to}} evaluate the effects of experience consuming other <b>canned</b> fish products, race, gender, age, and income on the taste, texture, appearance, and aroma of <b>canned</b> bighead. A logit analysis was then used to measure the effects of these variables on binary choice variables related to preference comparisons and willingness-to-pay as much for <b>canned</b> bighead as for <b>canned</b> salmon and <b>canned</b> tuna. Responses between the comparisons of <b>canned</b> bighead and <b>canned</b> salmon or <b>canned</b> tuna varied. Income, region, and gender significantly affected ratings on product attributes while taste variables significantly affected consumers' willingness-to-pay as much for <b>canned</b> bighead as for <b>canned</b> tuna. Conditional probabilities showed more clearly the effects of age, income, and gender on taste ratings, the subsequent effects of taste on preferences, and ultimately on willingness-to-pay. Probabilities estimated showed that <b>canned</b> bighead competes more favorably with <b>canned</b> tuna than with <b>canned</b> salmon. consumer preferences, structural model analysis, logit, marketing, aquaculture, Demand and Price Analysis, Environmental Economics and Policy, Food Consumption/Nutrition/Food Safety,...|$|R
