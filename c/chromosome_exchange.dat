40|$|The {{induction}} of chromosome exchanges {{was investigated}} in SW- 1573 human lung tumour cells radiosensitized with iododeoxyuridine (IdUrd) and irradiated with gamma-rays. Following treatment chromosome 2 and X were analyzed using {{fluorescence in situ hybridization}} (FISH) with chromosome-specific DNA libraries. The yield of chromosome exchanges involving chromosome 2 was higher than those involving chromosome-X. On the basis of the DNA content the relative involvement of the X-chromosome in exchange frequencies after 2 Gy was much higher than of chromosome 2. After 4 Gy the relative involvement of both chromosomes in exchanges is approximately equal. After radiosensitization, increased <b>chromosome</b> <b>exchange</b> frequencies are observed in both studied chromosomes. For the total <b>chromosome</b> <b>exchange</b> frequencies the sensitizer enhancement ratio (SER) at 2 Gy is 1. 8 and 1. 3 for chromosome 2 and X respectively.

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{investigate}} {{the role of}} kinetics in the processing of DNA double strand breaks (DSB), {{and the formation of}} simple <b>chromosome</b> <b>exchange</b> aberrations following X-ray exposures to mammalian cells based on an enzymatic approach. METHODS: Using computer simulations based on a biochemical approach, rate-equations that describe the processing of DSB through the formation of a DNA-enzyme complex were formulated. A second model that allows for competition between two processing pathways was also formulated. The formation of simple exchange aberrations was modelled as misrepair during the recombination of single DSB with undamaged DNA. Non-linear coupled differential equations corresponding to biochemical pathways were solved numerically by fitting to experimental data. RESULTS: When mediated by a DSB repair enzyme complex, the processing of single DSB showed a complex behaviour that gives the appearance of fast and slow components of rejoining. This is due to the time-delay caused by the action time of enzymes in biomolecular reactions. It is shown that the kinetic- and dose-responses of simple <b>chromosome</b> <b>exchange</b> aberrations are well described by a recombination model of DSB interacting with undamaged DNA when aberration formation increases with linear dose-dependence. Competition between two or more recombination processes is shown to lead to the formation of simple exchange aberrations with a dose-dependence similar to that of a linear quadratic model. CONCLUSIONS: Using a minimal number of assumptions, the kinetics and dose response observed experimentally for DSB rejoining and the formation of simple <b>chromosome</b> <b>exchange</b> aberrations are shown to be consistent with kinetic models based on enzymatic reaction approaches. A non-linear dose response for simple exchange aberrations is possible in a model of recombination of DNA containing a DSB with undamaged DNA when two or more pathways compete for DSB repair...|$|E

Additional studies of 50 g/cm 2 aluminum-shielded, high-energy-proton beams showed minor differences compared to the unshielded protons and lower RBE values found for shielded in comparison to unshielded beams of 2 or 2. 5 GeV.

To investigate if complex <b>chromosome</b> <b>exchanges</b> are induced by the high-LET component of space radiation exposure, damage was assessed in astronauts' blood lymphocytes before and after long duration missions of 3 - 4 months. The frequency of simple translocations increased significantly for most of the crewmembers studied. However, there were few complex exchanges detected and only one crewmember had a significant increase after flight. It has been suggested that the yield of complex chromosome damage could be underestimated when analyzing metaphase cells collected at one time point after irradiation, and analysis of chemically-induced PCC may be more accurate since problems with complicated cell-cycle delays are avoided. However, in this case the yields of chromosome damage were similar for metaphase and PCC analysis of astronauts' lymphocytes.

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{study the}} effect of the {{interaction}} distance on the frequency of inter- and intrachromosome <b>exchanges</b> in individual <b>chromosomes</b> with respect to their DNA content. Assumptions: <b>Chromosome</b> <b>exchanges</b> are formed by misrejoining of two DNA double-strand breaks (DSB) induced within an interaction distance, d. It is assumed that chromosomes in G(0) /G(1) phase of the cell cycle occupy a spherical domain in a cell nucleus, with no spatial overlap between individual chromosome domains. RESULTS: Formulae are derived for the probability of formation of inter-, as well as intra-, <b>chromosome</b> <b>exchanges</b> relating to the DNA content of the chromosome for a given interaction distance. For interaction distances 0 in the present model. The present model also predicts that the probability of intrachromosome exchanges occurring in individual chromosomes is proportional to their DNA content with correction terms. CONCLUSION: When the interaction distance is small, the "surface area" distribution for chromosome participation in interchromosome exchanges has been expected. However, the present model shows that for the interaction distance as large as 1 microm, the predicted probability of interchromosome exchange formation is still close to the surface area distribution. Therefore, this distribution does not necessarily rule out the formation of complex chromosomal aberrations by long-range misrejoining of DSB...|$|R

In Escherichia coli, such genetic rearrangements can occur at high frequencies, independent of the RecA-homologous recombination protein, and are sometimes associated with sister <b>chromosome</b> <b>exchange</b> (SCE). Two mechanisms for RecA-independent genetic rearrangements have been proposed: simple replication misalignment of the nascent strand and its template and SCE-associated misalignment involving both nascent strands.

Because mutations in these exonucleases stimulate tandem repeat deletion, we conclude that displaced 3 ′ ends are a common intermediate in both mechanisms of slipped misalignments. Our results also confirm the notion that two distinct mechanisms contribute to slipped misalignments: simple replication misalignment events are sensitive to DNA polymerase III exonuclease, whereas SCE-associated events are sensitive to exonuclease I. If heterologies are present between repeated sequences, the mismatch repair system dependent on MutS and MutH aborts potential deletion events via both mechanisms. Our results suggest that simple slipped misalignment and SCE-associated misalignment intermediates are similarly susceptible to destruction by the mismatch repair system...|$|E

40|$|Purpose: To combine FISH with pan-telomeric peptide {{nucleic acid}} (PNA) and whole chromosome-specific DNA probes to detect {{complete}} and incomplete <b>chromosome</b> <b>exchanges</b> in human lymphocytes. Materials and methods: Human lymphocytes were irradiated in vitro with 0. 9 Gy low dose-rate (0. 019 Gy/h) tritium β-rays. Metaphase spreads were treated with RNase, fixed in 1 : 3 acetic acid:methanol, and then further treated with KCl, proteinase K and fixed in 4 % paraformaldehyde. Slides were denatured, hybridized for 1. 5 h with an FITC-labelled telomeric PNA probe, and rehybridized overnight with a spectrum-orange whole-chromosome probe specific for chromosomes 1, 2 and 4. Hybridized spreads were washed with 70 % formamide/ 20 x SSC and counterstained with DAPI. Results: All three pairs of labelled chromosomes together with 92 telomeres were readily visible after hybridization. The whole chromosomes 1, 2 and 4 were painted orange, and all telomeres were stained green. Unpainted chromosomes were counterstained blue. In the observed 680 chromosome aberrations induced by tritium β-rays in human lymphocytes after 52 h of culture, no evidence of telomere addition was detected.

Human lymphocytes were irradiated in vitro with various energies of accelerated iron, silicon, neon, or titanium ions and chromosome damage was assessed in using three color FISH chromosome painting in chemically induced PCC samples collected a first cell division post irradiation. The LET values for these ions ranged from 30 to 195 keV/micrometers. Of the particles studied, Neon ions have the highest biological effectiveness for induction of total chromosome damage, {{which is consistent with}} track structure model predictions.

Key parameters in solving these problems were addition of macerozyme in the enzyme mix, the duration of digestion and temperature during the spreading phase. - Results and Conclusions This method was applied to analyse chromosome pairing in metaphase from triploid interspecific cultivars, and it was clearly demonstrated that interspecific recombinations between M. acuminata and M. balbisiana chromosomes do occur and may be frequent in triploid hybrids.

In this work, we recapitulate the evolutionary history of human chromosome 1 and its homologs in placental mammals, putatively the largest physical {{unit in the}} ancestral placental genome. Precise definition of translocation exchange breakpoints in human, carnivore, cetartiodactyl, and rodent-ordered gene maps demonstrate that chromosome breakpoints, previously considered as equivalent, actually represent distinct chromosome positions and exchange events. Multidirectional chromosome painting, using probes from homologs to chromosome 1 in seven mammal species from six orders of placental mammals, confirm the gene-mapping results and indicate that the multiple human chromosome 1 homologs in these species are derived from independent fissions of a single ancestral chromosome. Chromosome painting using human chromosome 1 probes identifies a single human chromosome 1 homolog in phylogenetically distant taxa, the two-toed sloth, cetaceans, and higher primates. The diverse phylogenetic occurrence of a single Hsa 1 synteny among the major clades of placental mammals suggests that human chromosome 1 represents an intact ancestral chromosome, which was variously fissioned {{in the majority of}} placental species.

40|$|Chromosome aberrations were {{measured}} in human peripheral blood lymphocytes after in vitro exposure to 28 Si- ions with energies ranging from 90 to 600 MeV/u, or to 56 Fe-ions with energies ranging from 200 to 5, 000 MeV/u. The LET {{of the various}} Fe beams in this study ranged from 145 to 440 keV/micron and the LET of the Si ions ranged from 48 to 158 keV/ m. Doses delivered were in the 10 - to 200 -cGy range. Dose-response curves for <b>chromosome</b> <b>exchanges</b> in cells at first division after exposure, measured using {{fluorescence in situ hybridization}} (FISH) with whole-chromosome probes, were fitted with linear or linear-quadratic functions. The relative biological effectiveness (RBE) was estimated from the initial slope of the dose-response curve for chromosome damage with respect to -rays. The estimates of RBE(sub max) values for total <b>chromosome</b> <b>exchanges</b> ranged from 4. 4 +/- 0. 4 to 31. 5 +/- 2. 6 for Fe ions, and 11. 8 +/- 1. 0 to 42. 2 +/- 3. 3 for Si ions. The highest RBE(sub max) value for Fe ions was obtained with the 600 -Mev/u beam, and the highest RBE(sub max) value for Si ions was obtained with the 170 MeV/u beam. For both ions the RBEmax values increased with LET, reaching a maximum at about 180 keV/micron for Fe and about 100 keV/ m for Si, and decreasing with further increase in LET. Additional studies for low doses 28 Si-ions down to 0. 02 Gy will be discussed...|$|R
2500|$|During the {{production}} of sex cells, DNA is [...] "reshuffled" [...] {{to ensure that the}} next generation does not inherit, for example, grandpa's chromosome 8, but a mixture of DNA from each parent. Instead, paired <b>chromosomes</b> <b>exchange</b> parallel pieces of DNA, a process called chromosomal crossover, prior to being passed on to the next generation. When particular genes are located physically close together on a chromosome, they tend to be passed on together. The rate at which two genes are passed on together can be used to calculate their distance from each other on the chromosome. Genes which tend to be passed on as a group form what is called a [...] "linkage group." ...|$|R
