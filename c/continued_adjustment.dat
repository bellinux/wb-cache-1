40|$|This paper {{presents}} an empirical {{analysis of the}} progress in U. S. external adjustment through 1988 and prospects for <b>continued</b> <b>adjustment</b> over the years ahead. Our analysis, {{based in part on}} a partial-equilibrium model of the U.

The model was about "on track" in the second quarter of 1988, but did not anticipate the drop off in the trade balance in the second half of the year. We consider various model extrapolations of the U. S. external balance with exchange rates and income growth rates held unchanged. Our model, as well as those of other researchers, indicate that the U. S. external balance will narrow somewhat further during 1989, but will begin to widen again thereafter. This view may be overly pessimistic, due to some limitations of the models. In order to assess the credibility of these projections, we consider the issue of model uncertainty and construct error bands around the model projections using stochastic simulation techniques.

40|$|In a paper {{submitted}} to the Annual World Bank Conference on Development Economics in Paris on May 15 - 16 th 2003 the experience of decoupling farm aid payments in the USA, EU, Mexico and Turkey was reviewed. The paper starts with {{a review of the}} impact of current agricultural support programmes which stimulate overproduction and depress prices, which in turn requires higher levels of support. It points out that most of the benefits of these support programmes are captured by large farms and input-supply industries. It highlights the international spill-over effects of domestic support policies, which either reduce imports or expand exports 'lowering world prices to the detriment of competitive suppliers elsewhere. This it argues needs to be seen against the background of 'the long-term trend of agricultural productivity growing more rapidly than demand' which 'implies <b>continued</b> <b>adjustment</b> pressures at the global level, with agricultural support simply shifting the burden of adjustment to other non-subsidizing countries'. It is against this background that decoupling is then considered. The major argument for decoupling is that 'budgetary payments that are decoupled from agricultural activity altogether would transfer income to selected households most efficiently' so that the 'economic distortions and distributive leakages are thereby minimised'. The benefits of this are 'reduced costs to consumers and taxpayers, improved trade opportunities for competitive suppliers, less stress on the environment and more effective policies to achieve goals'. In reviewing the overall experience of decoupling to date the paper concludes that the results have 'not been encouraging'. It argues that the ideal form of decoupling would be across the whole of the agricultural sector and describes sector-specific decoupling as the third-best option, although it would be a move in the right direction. It argues that if decoupling is not to become simply another subsidy programme it: should be in the form of taxpayer-funded payments that should not require production. Indeed, 'land, labour or any other input should not have to be in agricultural use'; should have eligibility rules that are clearly defined and unchangeable; should not exist in parallel with coupled programmes of support, since these provide incentives to overproduction; should have time limits on the life of the programme; should feature farm payments whose level, both in aggregate and per farm, should be bound at the WTO. Comment: The paper's exploration of the different definitions of decoupling in use suggests that it is very important for ACP countries to actively participate in debates around decoupling in the WTO in order to avoid 'dirty decoupling', that is decoupling which continues to massively distort international trade.

40|$|Bounded {{rationality}} {{provides a}} fundamental economic explanation for nonrationai modes of behavior. These nonrational modes underlie both the erratic perturbations of entrepreneurship and the systematic waves of diffusion they initiate {{which in turn}} guarantee that the economy operates out of equilibrium. <b>Continuing</b> <b>adjustments</b> out of equilibrium are made possible by financial intermediation.

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the experiences and}} challenges of Hungary's monetary policy during the period 1995 – 2000 and {{in view of the}} progress toward EU and EMU membership. The structure of relative prices changed markedly in the past and is expected to continue to change in the future. The reason, in addition to a possible Balassa–Samuelson effect, was the elimination of subsidies and introduction of turnover taxes in the past, and a future convergence toward a price structure prevalent in the EU. In the 1995 – 2000 period, the resulting gap between CPI and PPI led to massive foreign capital inflows. While the policy of sterilised interventions by the National Bank of Hungary was probably the right answer, it was inevitably costly, and was made costlier than necessary by the way it was carried out. <b>Continued</b> <b>adjustments</b> in the price structure in the future will confront monetary policy with the same dilemmas and, resulting in an inflation floor, will complicate the country's conditions of joining EMU within a reasonable time frame after EU accession...|$|R
40|$|AGC was {{implemented}} in first radios {{for the reason}} of fading propagation (defined as slow variations in the amplitude of the received signals) which required <b>continuing</b> <b>adjustments</b> in the receiver’s gain {{in order to maintain}} a relative constant output signal. Such situation led to the design of circuits, which primary ideal function was to maintain a constant signal level at the output, regardless of the signal’s variations at the input of the system. Now AGC circuits can be found in any device or system where wide amplitude variations in the output signal could lead to a lost of information or to an unacceptable performance of the system. Automatic Gain Control (AGC) circuits are employed in many systems where the amplitude of an incoming signal can vary over a wide dynamic range. The role of the AGC circuit is to provide a relatively constant output amplitude so that circuits following the AGC circuit require less dynamic range. If the signal level changes are much slower than the information rate contained in the signal, then an AGC circuit can be used to provide a signal with a well defined average level to downstream circuits. In most system applications, the time to adjust the gain in response to an input amplitude change should remain constant, independent of the input amplitude level and hence gain setting of the amplifier. The large dynamic range of signals that must be handled by most receivers requires gain adjustment t...|$|R
40|$|Healthcare {{managers}} {{are more and}} more interested in the role of general practitioners (GP) in the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. <b>Continuing</b> <b>adjustments</b> of the health organization are the old/new challenge in improving patient care. The European Society of Cardiology guidelines recommend a disease-management program for heart failure (HF); moreover, observational studies and randomized controlled trials have reported better patient outcomes if patients are in charge of cardiologists rather than GPs or other physicians. Patients with chronic HF are often very old and affected by multiple comorbid conditions, by themselves associated with high rates of morbidity and mortality. Furthermore, too many patients receive neither a correct diagnosis nor treatment until advanced disease occurs. New treatment approaches, some of them requiring the expertise of well-trained cardiologists, are ongoing to improve the clinical outcomes. The optimal management of patients with HF needs teamwork, i. e. GPs, cardiologists, nurses and caregivers, since a multidisciplinary program, only, can embody the best answer for outpatients with chronic HF. Currently, the Cardiovascular Center in Trieste is performing an experimental trial, so far never attempted before, in treating patients with chronic HF using a thorough approach with the full involvement of local cardiologists, GPs and nurses. Such approach is, at the same time, as well a challenge as an opportunity: a challenge because conventional clinical habits must be changed; an opportunity because patients can benefit from a proper whole care-group, aimed at prolonging life and reducing morbidity and symptoms...|$|R

40|$|Popular {{discussions of}} family life in {{contemporary}} society have provided a rather bleak characterization of a social institution believed to be more fragile and disorganized than in past times. Although continuing personal ties with other family members is under-stood as important in tempering the impact both of role strain and overload and also of adverse life events, it has been maintained that urban life is in-consistent with the maintenance of such family ties. Detailed studies of relations within the modified ex-tended family characteristic of urban society, how-ever, have shown high rates of contact across genera-tions, together with acknowledgement of mutual obligations perceived as important by family mem-bers. Consideration {{of the role of}} adult family life as a factor determining personal adjustment reveals a dual paradox. The first results from the use of psychological formulations concerning the develop-ment of the mother-infant bond as the basis for por-traying relations within the family of adulthood. These psychological formulations stress the impor-tance of attaining personal autonomy and self-reliance for <b>continuing</b> <b>adjustment</b> in ways which are inconsistent with the extent of mutual caring and interdependence actually reported among adults within the family. A second paradox results from the assumption that older family members may feel par-ticularly isolated from continuing family ties. Not only do reports of life within the multi-generation family contradict this assumption but, ironically, the very continuing obligations and responsibilities which are incurred by older family members across adulthood may be experienced as adversely affecting morale after midlife. Indeed, the most important contribution of these family ties to personal adjust-ment across the second half of life may well be sup-port of personal autonomy rather than the inter...|$|R
40|$|The {{origin of}} my work began in {{personal}} experience rather than with books and formal training. In a very real sense, my interest in studying about Southeast Asian society and history both from interdisciplinary and cross-cultural perspectives, started at the edge. The reason is twofold. First, my introduction to Southeast Asia was based on witnessing the traumatic experience of adjustment of a maritime-nomadic people to a sedentary way of life-a pariah people who, socially and politically, were at the edge, on the margin of society and history.

The choice to opt for Australia, then considered in certain respects to be at the edge of Southeast Asia studies, was deliberate. It allowed me the ultimate practical experience of "passing over" into another culture situated on the rim of Southeast Asia and the chance of studying and working in a different system of education, which at the postgraduate level primarily emphasised research and participation in a variety of intra-university inter-disciplinary seminars.
