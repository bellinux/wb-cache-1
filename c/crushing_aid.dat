5|$|Crush's {{rivalry with}} Vega ended {{when he joined}} the Nation in early 1997. <b>Crush</b> <b>aided</b> Faarooq in his feud with Ahmed Johnson. After his loss to Goldust at King of the Ring, Crush argued with Savio Vega, during Faarooq's WWF Championship title shot, which distracted Faarooq, causing him to lose the match. The {{following}} night on Raw is War, Crush and Vega, {{along with the rest of}} Nation were fired by Faarooq. As a result, Crush began feuding with Faarooq and formed his own biker faction called Disciples of Apocalypse, which was introduced on the June 23 episode of Raw is War.|$|R

When Li Congke sought advice from his officials, Long Min (龍敏) suggested that he create Li Zanhua the Emperor of Khitan and send an army to escort him back to Khitan territory, to create a second front that Khitan's Emperor Taizong would have to deal with. Li Congke gave initial approval to the plan, but the more powerful officials opposed, believing the plan to be useless, and nothing eventually came of it.|$|R

Some time passes and John has recovered physically, but still has amnesia. In addition, from time to time he suffers from severe pain which is somehow tied to his ongoing mutation. He also begins emitting strange, bright energy bursts. John soon learns that he is able to use this energy to heal injuries, as witnessed by <b>Crusher</b> when he <b>aids</b> a patient in her Sickbay.|$|R
40|$|Compressive ice {{failure is}} an {{important}} aspect {{in the design of}} offshore structures in ice environments. The authors concentrate attention on the crushing failure mode. The scale effect is a phenomenon whereby the average pressure decreases with contact area. In classical elasticity, viscoelasticity and plasticity, there is no scale effect. In the case of ice compressive failure, there is ample evidence of a scale effect. Two factors are dominant in this situation. Ice is prone to fracture, thus reducing the volume of material to be <b>crushed,</b> and <b>aiding</b> in the formation of high pressure zones. The second factor in the scale effect is the averaging process that results from the transition from local pressures on small areas (dominated by high pressure zones) to global pressures, where this effect is averaged. The analysis of probabilistic averaging is described with the example of pressures measured on the Molikpaq structure. The implications for design are significant.

40|$|Nordberg, {{a capital}} {{equipment}} manufacturer, performed a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) study on its rock <b>crusher</b> to <b>aid</b> {{in making decisions}} on product design and energy improvements. LCA {{is a relatively new}} cutting edge environmental tool recently standardized by ISO that provides quantitative environmental and energy data on products or processes. This paper commences with a brief introduction to LCA and presents the system boundaries, modeling and assumptions for the rock crusher study. System boundaries include all major life cycle stages except manufacturing and assembly of the crusher. Results of the LCA show that over 99 % of most of the flows {{into and out of the}} system may be attributed to the use phase of the rock crusher. Within the use phase itself, over 95 % of each environmental inflow and outflow (with some exceptions) are attributed to electricity consumption, and not the replacement of spares/wears or lubricating oil over the lifetime of the crusher. Results tables and charts present selected environmental flows, including CO 2 NOx, SOx, particulate matter, and energy consumption, for each of the rock crusher life cycle stages and the use phase. This paper aims to demonstrate the benefits of adopting a rigorous scientific approac...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The {{paper is}} about {{design of a}} Plastic Bottle Crusher which would help to crush the used Plastic bottles and would thereby help in waste {{management}} and disposal. This project aims to design a portable Plastic Bottle crusher that could be installed anywhere and would <b>aid</b> <b>crush</b> of used bottles. This project involves the process of designing the crusher considering forces required for crushing and ergonomic factor that an operator needs. The design of this machine is such that it would require optimum load to crush bottles and will thus not strain the user or operator. After the completion of design process, it could be manufactured and transformed into a Recycle aid able machine. The crusher thus would help in recycling plastic waste. It would also help in reducing the volume of waste generated and will thus help in effective waste management. The crushing of used water bottles will also ensure that the bottles are no used beyond the shelf life of its plastic. Therefore this project {{will prove to be}} a useful asset in many ways...|$|R
50|$|In AD 324, {{the final}} battle between Constantine I, Emperor of the West, and Licinius, Emperor of the East, in which Constantine {{defeated}} Licinius, {{took place at}} Chrysopolis. When Constantine made Byzantium his capital, Chrysopolis, together with Chalcedon, became suburbs. Chrysopolis remained important throughout the Byzantine period because all trade routes to Asia started there, and all Byzantine army units headed to Asia mustered there.During the brief usurpation of the Armenian general Artabasdos, his eldest son, Niketas, was defeated with his forces at Chrysopolis by the army of Constantine V, before Artabasdos was finally deposed by the legitimate emperor Constantine and blinded. For this reason and its location across from Constantinople, {{it was a natural}} target for anyone aiming at the capital. Also, in the 8th century AD it was taken by a small band of Arabs who caused considerable destruction, and panic in Constantinople, before withdrawing. In 988, a rebellion that nearly toppled Basil II began in Chrysopolis, before he was able to <b>crush</b> with the <b>aid</b> of Russian mercenaries.|$|R
5000|$|Mudpuppies use rows {{of teeth}} to eat their prey. [...] Salamanders have three {{different}} sets of teeth: dentary, premaxillary, and vomerine teeth, which are named due to their location in the mouth. All the teeth, despite their different locations, are very similar. They are small and conical, meaning that mudpuppies are homodonts due to their similar shape. The common mudpuppy never leaves its aquatic environment and therefore does not undergo morphogenesis, however many salamanders do and develop differentiated teeth. Aquatic salamander teeth are used to hinder escape of the prey from the salamander, {{they do not have}} a <b>crushing</b> function. This <b>aids</b> the salamander when feeding. When the salamander undergoes the [...] "suck and gape" [...] feeding style, the prey is pulled into the mouth, and the teeth function to hold the prey inside the mouth and prevent the prey form escaping. At both sides of their mouths their lips interlock which allows them to use suction feeding. They are carnivorous creatures and will eat almost anything they can get in their mouths. Typically they prey upon animals such as insects, mollusks, annelids, small fish, amphibians, earthworms, and spiders. The jaw of a mudpuppy also plays a significant role in its diet. The mudpuppy jaw is considered metaautostyly, like most amphibians, meaning that the jaw is more stable, and the salamander has a dentary. This affects their diet by limiting the flexibility of the jaw to take in larger prey. The mudpuppy has few predators but may include fish, crayfish, turtles, and water snakes. Because fishermen frequently catch and discard them, humans are considered to be one of their main predators.|$|R
6000|$|No {{wonder that}} in Lydgate's {{energetic}} nature {{the sense of}} a hopeless misconstruction easily turned into a dogged resistance. The scowl which occasionally showed itself on his square brow was not a meaningless accident. Already when he was re-entering the town after that ride taken in the first hours of stinging pain, he was setting his mind on remaining in Middlemarch in spite of the worst that could be done against him. He would not retreat before calumny, as if he submitted to it. He would face it to the utmost, and no act of his should show that he was afraid. It belonged to the generosity as well as defiant force of his nature that he resolved not to shrink from showing to the full his sense of obligation to Bulstrode. It was true that the association with this man had been fatal to him--true that if he had had the thousand pounds still in his hands with all his debts unpaid he would have returned the money to Bulstrode, and taken beggary rather than the rescue which had been sullied with the suspicion of a bribe (for, remember, {{he was one of the}} proudest among the sons of men)--nevertheless, he would not turn away from this <b>crushed</b> fellow-mortal whose <b>aid</b> he had used, and make a pitiful effort to get acquittal for himself by howling against another. [...] "I shall do as I think right, and explain to nobody. They will try to starve me out, but--" [...] he was going on with an obstinate resolve, but he was getting near home, and the thought of Rosamond urged itself again into that chief place from which it had been thrust by the agonized struggles of wounded honor and pride.|$|R
40|$|Abstract — Experimental {{assessment}} of the suitability of Periwinkle Shell Ash (PSA) for use as filtration loss control additive in water-based drilling mud has been presented. Locally sourced periwinkle shells were soaked overnight in warm water treated with Sodium Chloride (NaCl) to remove dirt and any contaminant. Thereafter, the periwinkle shells were washed and air dried, and then heated in an electric muffle furnace at 995 o C. The calcined shells were then <b>crushed</b> with the <b>aid</b> of a jaw crusher and grinded to fine particles. The ensuing ash was then sieved through BS sieve (75 microns) to obtain a fine ash (nanoparticles). This fine ash particles is the PSA used for the formulation of the mud sample of interest. The filtration characteristics of the formulated mud samples were tested using American Petroleum Institute (API) filter press and in accordance to API recommended practice for field testing water based drilling fluids (API RP 13 B- 1). Filtration control characteristics of the mud samples were demonstrated by the filtrate volume and the thickness and consistency of the mud filter cake deposited on the filter paper after 30 minutes of filtration. Physical examination of the filter cakes indicates that filter cake formed by sample C, prepare with 2. 0 g of PSA, was thinner (0. 75 mm thick) and more consistent than the rest. After 30 minutes of filtration, mud samples A, B, C, and D produced 7. 7 ml, 7. 2 ml, 6. 7 ml, and 7. 0 ml filtrate volumes, respectively. This imply that sample C formulated with 2. 0 g of PSA, which produced the least filtrate volume (6. 7 ml) after 30 minutes of filtration, demonstrated better filtration control characteristics than samples A, B, and D. Addition of PS...|$|R
