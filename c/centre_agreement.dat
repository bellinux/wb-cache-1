In the 1991 parliamentary election, {{he was elected to}} the parliament as a non-party member. He was, however, supported by the electoral committee Center Civic Alliance, closely related but not identical to the political party <b>Centre</b> <b>Agreement</b> (Porozumienie Centrum) led by his brother. He was also the main adviser and supporter of Lech Wałęsa when the latter was elected President of Poland in December 1990. Wałęsa nominated Kaczyński to be the Security Minister in the Presidential Chancellery but fired him in 1992 due to a conflict concerning Jan Olszewski's government.|$|E
5000|$|The Center Civic Alliance (Porozumienie Obywatelskie Centrum), {{abbreviated}} as POC, was a center-right {{electoral alliance}} of several political parties {{that participated in}} the 1991 Polish parliamentary election. The Center Civic Alliance was chiefly organized by the <b>Centre</b> <b>Agreement,</b> drawing in remnants of the Solidarity Citizens' Committees, independents, and Christian right parties, including the Polish People's Christian Forum [...] "Homeland". [...] The alliance was created after its main component, the <b>Centre</b> <b>Agreement,</b> attempted to form a broad alliance supporting President Lech Wałęsa. However, the alliance quickly fell out favor of the president, failing to gain Wałęsa's approval. In its aftermath, <b>Centre</b> <b>Agreement</b> leader Jarosław Kaczyński was subsequently fired from his position as Chief of the Presidential Chancellery.|$|E

Through {{a review of}} the content of agreements we can establish the job classifications for call centre workers, terms and conditions of employment, respondent organizations to the agreement, access to training, forms of discipline and grievance handling procedures, and career path opportunities. In particular we are interested in the range of occupations incorporated into the agreement, the differences between union and non union agreements, and the differences between in house and specialist (outsourced) call <b>centre</b> <b>agreements.</b> In turn we will also examine wage determination processes and negotiated wage increases for call centres alongside the emerging trends across all agreements for other industries...|$|R

40|$|In {{previous}} work, {{experimental data}} {{have demonstrated the}} severity of idling gear rattle depends {{not only on the}} amplitude, but also the phase of an external sinusoidal forcing. One possible explanation for this is in small tooth profile errors. In this paper, we investigate this hypothesis, by deriving an equation of motion incorporating an error function and losses at the mesh interface, values of which are obtained from experimental data. By solving the equations of motion, theoretical gear rattle trajectories are obtained. Theoretical and experimental trajectories are then compared, by way of time domain plots as well as via contour plots linking the amplitude of backlash oscillation to the amplitude and phase of input forcing. For most profile error functions, good agreement is achieved between the model and experimental data. In the case where the profile errors are dominated by misalignment between the gear and shaft <b>centres</b> <b>agreement</b> is less good and suggestions of areas of further study required for model refinement are proposed. <br/...|$|R

Olszewski {{departed}} from the <b>Centre</b> <b>Agreement</b> in the summer of 1992 with a number of other rebel MPs, creating the Movement of the Republic, The new party was joined by other anti-Wałęsa and former Solidarity supporters, carrying a quasi-nationalist and ultra-Catholic platform. As a parliamentarian, Olszewski led his club's opposition to the Small Constitution, believing it did not offer a clear break from the Stalinist constitution of 1956. Olszewski led his party to support the vote of no confidence against Prime Minister Hanna Suchocka in 1993, believing her economic policies had harmed the state. In the subsequent elections that year, Olszewski lost his seat as the electorate swung to the left, despite a failed attempt to reunite rightist forces with the <b>Centre</b> <b>Agreement,</b> now headed by Jarosław Kaczyński.|$|E

50|$|Both {{before and}} after his 1990 {{election}} to the presidency, Lech Wałęsa had a deeply strained relationship with Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki, stemming from Wałęsa's belief that Mazowiecki was not aggressive enough in the dismissal of former Polish United Workers' Party members from senior government and economic positions. Mazowiecki's famous 1989 Thick Line speech (gruba kreska) further exacerbated the splintering. The split {{between the two men}} fractured the original uniting Solidarity Citizens' Committee by 1990, with intellectuals supporting Mazowiecki's new Citizens' Movement for Democratic Action, while workers supported the <b>Centre</b> <b>Agreement,</b> a political movement based around Wałęsa.|$|E
