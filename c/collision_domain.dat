5000|$|A <b>collision</b> <b>domain</b> is {{a section}} of a network {{connected}} by a shared medium or through repeaters where data packets can collide with one another while being sent. The <b>collision</b> <b>domain</b> applies particularly in wireless networks, but also affected early versions of Ethernet. A network collision occurs when more than one device attempts to send a packet on a network segment at the same time. Members of a <b>collision</b> <b>domain</b> {{may be involved in}} collisions with one another. Devices outside the <b>collision</b> <b>domain</b> do not have collisions with those inside.|$|E
50|$|Only {{one device}} in the <b>collision</b> <b>domain</b> may {{transmit}} {{at any one}} time, and the other devices in the domain listen to the network and refrain from transmitting while others are already transmitting {{in order to avoid}} collisions. Because only one device may be transmitting at any one time, total network bandwidth is shared among all devices on the <b>collision</b> <b>domain.</b> Collisions also decrease network efficiency on a <b>collision</b> <b>domain</b> as collisions require devices to abort transmission and retransmit at a later time.|$|E

40|$|Non-cooperative channel {{assignment}}, i. e., {{channel assignment}} for selfish wireless devices, is highly challenging, especially in multiple <b>collision</b> <b>domains.</b> In this paper, we study {{the problem of}} noncooperative multi-radio channel assignment in multiple <b>collision</b> <b>domains</b> {{and focus on the}} fairness issue. We first conduct an analysis of the fairness property of the system assuming no incentive-compatible scheme is deployed. We show that, without any incentive-compatible scheme for channel assignment, the stable states of the system may well be max-min unfair. In order to guarantee fairness, we propose a channel assignment scheme for multiple <b>collision</b> <b>domains</b> that is incentive compatible. We rigorously show that our proposed scheme can always achieve NEs with complete fairness. Simulation results verify that our scheme guarantees complete fairness. I...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Channel {{assignment}} {{is a crucial}} problem for wireless networks, especially for non-cooperative wireless networks, in which nodes are selfish. While {{there have been a}} few studies of non-cooperative, multi-radio channel assignment, most existing studies are restricted to single <b>collision</b> <b>domains</b> only. In this paper, we study the design of incentive-compatible protocols for non-cooperative, multiradio channel assignment in multiple <b>collision</b> <b>domains.</b> First, we show the necessity of designing incentivecompatible protocols for this problem. Specifically, we show that, if no incentive-compatible protocol is deployed, Nash Equilibria (NEs) may have undesired properties, such as Pareto suboptimality and low throughput. In order to prevent the system from converging to the NEs with undesired properties, we propose an incentivecompatible protocol for channel assignment in multiple <b>collision</b> <b>domains.</b> We rigorously show that our protocol guarantees that the system converges to NEs that are Pareto-optimal and have the maximum system-wide throughput. Our simulation results also verify that our protocols are effective in ensuring that the system converges to the desired NEs...|$|R

50|$|Collision {{avoidance}} is used {{to improve}} {{the performance of the}} CSMA method by attempting to divide the channel somewhat equally among all transmitting nodes within the <b>collision</b> <b>domain.</b>|$|E
50|$|The 5-4-3 rule also {{referred}} to as the IEEE way (contrary to the Ethernet way) is a design guideline for Ethernet computer networks covering the number of repeaters and segments on shared-access Ethernet backbones in a tree topology. It means that in a <b>collision</b> <b>domain</b> there should be at most 5 segments tied together with 4 repeaters, with up to 3 mixing segments (10BASE5, 10BASE2, or 10BASE-FP). Link segments can be 10BASE-T, 10BASE-FL or 10BASE-FB. This rule is also designated the 5-4-3-2-1 rule with there being two link segments (without senders) and one <b>collision</b> <b>domain.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Physically {{segmenting}} {{the broadcast}} domains using routers at Layer 3 (or logically with VLANs at Layer 2) {{in the same}} fashion switches decrease the size of <b>collision</b> <b>domains</b> at Layer 2.|$|R
50|$|While some layer two {{network devices}} {{are able to}} divide the <b>collision</b> <b>domains,</b> {{broadcast}} domains are only divided by layer 3 network devices such as routers or layer 3 switches. Separating VLANs divides broadcast domains as well.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—The use of WMNs as {{backbone}} {{for large}} wireless access networks imposes strict bandwidth requirements. It is therefore necessary {{to study and}} quantify the capacity of such systems. In this paper, we argue that the capacity of WMNs should be addressed {{in the context of}} fairness to ensure proper operation of WMNs. Among the fairness schemes, max-min fairness allows fair and efficient use of network resources. We therefore propose an algorithm for max-min capacity calculation, formulated in term of <b>collision</b> <b>domains.</b> In addition, we show how to calculate the effective load of <b>collision</b> <b>domains,</b> assuming IEEE 802. 11 as the MAC protocol. We illustrate our proposed algorithm and validate our results over baseline and general topologies...|$|R
50|$|With twisted-pair Ethernet, {{electrical}} segments can {{be joined}} together using repeaters or repeating hubs. This {{corresponds to the}} extent of a OSI Layer 1 network and is equivalent to the <b>collision</b> <b>domain.</b>|$|E
50|$|Early network {{designers}} often configured VLANs {{with the}} aim of reducing the size of the <b>collision</b> <b>domain</b> in a large single Ethernet segment and thus improving performance. When Ethernet switches made this a non-issue (because each switch port is a <b>collision</b> <b>domain),</b> attention turned to reducing the size of the broadcast domain at the MAC layer. A VLAN can also serve to restrict access to network resources without regard to physical topology of the network, although the strength of this method remains debatable as VLAN hopping is a means of bypassing such security measures if not prevented. VLAN hopping can be mitigated with proper switchport configuration.|$|E
50|$|When {{a twisted}} pair or fiber link segment is used and neither end is {{connected}} to a repeater, full-duplex Ethernet becomes possible over that segment. In full-duplex mode, both devices can transmit and receive to and from {{each other at the}} same time, and there is no <b>collision</b> <b>domain.</b> This doubles the aggregate bandwidth of the link and is sometimes advertised as double the link speed (for example, 200 Mbit/s). The elimination of the <b>collision</b> <b>domain</b> for these connections also means that all the link's bandwidth can be used by the two devices on that segment and that segment length is not limited by the need for correct collision detection.|$|E
30|$|Equation 16 – 28 and 31 are now {{constraints}} to {{a standard}} MILP with Equation 30 as objective function. By solving this MILP we can compute the optimal download rates and handover patterns in each time slot, given we know the PHY rates, <b>collision</b> <b>domains</b> and service requests for the whole system run-time.|$|R
50|$|The {{distinction}} between broadcast and <b>collision</b> <b>domains</b> comes about because simple Ethernet and similar systems use a shared transmission system. In simple Ethernet (without switches or bridges), data frames are transmitted {{to all other}} nodes on a network. Each receiving node checks the destination address of each frame, and simply ignores any frame not addressed to its own MAC.|$|R
40|$|Dynamic {{spectrum}} auctions {{have been}} considered a promising approach to effectively re-distribute spectrum resources in the secondary spectrum market. However, the existing spectrum auctions are limited to allocating spectrum in units of channels. Recently software defined radio technologies make exciting progress in operating radios with variable bandwidths. They push the need for designing more flexible spectrum auction frameworks that allow to allocate spectrum with variable bandwidth to the secondary user. In this paper, we design truthful spectrum auction frameworks in which secondary users can bid for, and then be actually allocated spectra with variable bandwidths. We first present a truthful framework for auctions of variable-bandwidth spectra in single <b>collision</b> <b>domains,</b> which can achieve system efficiency. Then, we propose a similar framework for multiple <b>collision</b> <b>domains</b> and rigorously show that it is also truthful. Results of extensive evaluations demonstrate that both of our spectrum auction frameworks for variable bandwidth are effective...|$|R
5000|$|Segmentation {{involves}} the use of a bridge or a switch (or a router) to split a larger <b>collision</b> <b>domain</b> into smaller ones in order to reduce collision probability, and to improve overall network throughput. In the extreme case (i.e. micro-segmentation), each device is located on a dedicated switch port. In contrast to an Ethernet hub, there is a separate <b>collision</b> <b>domain</b> on each of the switch ports. This allows computers to have dedicated bandwidth on point-to-point connections to the network and also to run in full-duplex without collisions. Full-duplex mode has only one transmitter and one receiver per [...] "collision domain", making collisions impossible.|$|E
50|$|This is as {{compared}} to a <b>collision</b> <b>domain,</b> which would be all nodes on {{the same set of}} inter-connected repeaters, divided by switches and learning bridges. Collision domains are generally smaller than, and contained within, broadcast domains.|$|E
50|$|Collision domains {{are found}} in an Ethernet hub or {{repeater}} environment where each host segment connects to a hub that represents only one <b>collision</b> <b>domain</b> within one broadcast domain. Collision domains are also found in other shared medium networks, e. g. wireless networks such as Wi-Fi.|$|E

A number of possible problems for future research are listed...|$|R
50|$|Bridged {{networks}} {{break up}} <b>collision</b> <b>domains,</b> but the network remains one large broadcast domain. Similarly, layer 2 switches (bridges) cannot break up broadcast domains, {{which can cause}} performance issues and limits {{the size of your}} network. Broadcast and multicasts, along with the slow convergence of spanning tree, can cause major problems as the network grows. Because of these problems, layer 2 switches cannot completely replace routers in the internet work.|$|R
30|$|A final {{direction}} for future {{study is to}} study {{the combination of the}} time <b>domain</b> <b>collision</b> avoidance, together with frequency and/or space <b>domain</b> <b>collision</b> avoidance. This will exploit the possible benefits of a spectrum sensing engine to its fullest.|$|R
50|$|The term <b>collision</b> <b>domain</b> {{may also}} be used to refer to a system in which a single name or {{identifier}} is open to multiple interpretations by different layers or processing. The notion of a namespace has been widely adopted as a software programming practice to avert undesired clashes.|$|E
5000|$|Since {{data bits}} are {{propagated}} at a finite speed, simultaneously {{is to be}} {{defined in terms of}} the size of the <b>collision</b> <b>domain</b> and the minimum packet size allowed. A smaller packet size or a larger dimension would make it possible for a sender to finish sending the packet without the first bits of the message being able to reach the most remote node. So, that node could start sending as well, without a clue to the transmission already taking place and destroying the first packet. Unless the size of the <b>collision</b> <b>domain</b> allows the initial sender to receive the second transmission attempt - the collision - within the time it takes to send the packet he would neither be able to detect the collision nor to repeat the transmission [...] - [...] this is called a late collision.|$|E
50|$|A network bridge connects and filters traffic {{between two}} network {{segments}} {{at the data}} link layer (layer 2) of the OSI model to form a single network. This breaks the network's <b>collision</b> <b>domain</b> but maintains a unified broadcast domain. Network segmentation breaks down a large, congested network into an aggregation of smaller, more efficient networks.|$|E

The proposed mathematical apparatus properly can be used to solve the routing problem. Based on the representation planar König’s of multichannel multiradio mesh-network in the routing problem is solved, which is to identify those <b>collision</b> <b>domains</b> through which traffic is to be transmitted from the sender to the recipient, and so that end-to-end performance requirements have been satisfied.

Based on hypergraph and flat koenigs representation of multi- multilchannel multiradio mesh-network in the work performed consistent solution of problems of distribution of non-overlapping frequency channels and stream routing.

To investigate the dependences among basic parameters, analytic models of the functioning of such networks are elaborated. Calculations made for a relatively large set of values of initial data confirm the necessity of case dependent special investigations on the physical configuration of concrete Ethernet networks.

50|$|Industrial {{networks}} {{often use}} network switches to segment a large system into logical sub-networks, divided by address, protocol, or application.

When an industrial network must connect to an office network or external networks, a firewall system can be inserted to control exchange of data between the networks. To preserve the performance and reliability of the industrial network, general office automation systems are separated from the network used for control or I/O devices. Some Industrial Ethernets use a ring topology to avoid collisions and provide deterministic performance.|$|R
