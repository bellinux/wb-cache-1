2500|$|The Chiapa site is {{important}} because it shows a Mixe–Zoque–Olmec culture which eventually split from the Olmec. The development of the ancient city has been divided into a number of phases. The earliest and most important are the Escalera or Chiapa III (700-500BCE) and Francesa or Chiapa IV (500BCE to 100CE) phase. Olmec influence is strongest in the Escalera phase when it became a planned town with formal plazas and monumental buildings. However, contacts with Mayan areas is evident as well. [...] However, even during this phase, there are significant differences in architecture and pottery which suggest a distinct Zoque identity from the Mixe–Zoque/Olmec cultural base. The distinction grew in the Francesca period as monumental structures were enlarged and pottery was almost all locally made. There is also evidence of participation in long distance trade networks, and the first examples of hieroglyphic writing appear. The earliest Long Count inscription in Mesoamerica derives from this phase, with a date of 36 BCE appearing on Stela 2. At its height, was an independent city on major trade routes. It may have been a major influence for the later Maya civilization as the pyramids in Chiapa are very similar to the E group pyramids found in most of Mesoamerica. The following Horcones phase and Istmo phase to 400 CE show more elaborate tomb construction and craft specialization. By the end of these phases, however, <b>craft</b> <b>activity</b> diminishes and long distance ties contracted even though tombs remain elaborate. The final centuries are associated with the Jiquipilas phase around 400 CE. It is not known what brought down the civilization, but the city became gradually abandoned and appears to have become a pilgrimage site, perhaps by Zoque who had been conquered by the Chiapa people.|$|E

Since she was not carrying high priority cargo, her boats helped transports in landing troops and cargo on D-Day before they began unloading her own cargo on the following day. Although enemy air and small <b>craft</b> <b>activity</b> was intense, Arneb only lost one LCVP. She returned to Leyte on 15 January and ferried troops and supplies to Luzon for the assault on the area around La Paz on the 29th.

50|$|Craftsmanship and {{its role}} in economyGenerally viewed the <b>craft</b> <b>activity</b> appears to be ancient as human {{economic}} activity. This place usually exercised mainly in the urban centers.For Anamorava, craftsmanship has been developed mainly in cities, as in Gjilan, Preshevo and Bujanoc. Gjilan main space center of Anamorava and beyond, once represented a small town with all the characteristics of an oriental town.Obviously today in Gjilan main urban center of the area, craftsmanship it no longer has a role it had in past centuries, but transformed into similar activities of other nature, even today is shown its important role in the lives of residents, the relevant are.Now we give some brief information about the development of craftsmanship in Gjilan surroundings. From the very beginning there was little consideration given little written documents, but also memory, verbal confession respectively anthropology help in this regard.If we start from some old craft, that were once productive, give products as evidence of artifacts that are produced by the human hand.According to data for the years 1914-1928, the craftsmanship speak for many types of crafts, 1914 in Gjilan recorded three jewelry stores. In Gjilan even today there are many shops of jewelry. Currently operating 33 stores of gold and jeweler in Gjilan.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT. This paper {{argues that}} the advent of powerful, {{affordable}} output devices offers {{the potential for a}} vastly expanded landscape of computationally-enriched mathe-matical <b>craft</b> <b>activities</b> in education. While mathematical crafts have a venerable history in classrooms, they have also suffered from a reputation of being both intellectually marginal and technologically retrograde. Nonetheless, this paper argues that <b>craft</b> <b>activities</b> have both intellectual and emotional affordances that are relatively lacking in ‘traditional’ computer-based education; and that the combination of crafts and computation (facilitated by novel output devices and materials) can render such activities still more valuable. As springboards for discussion, the paper describes three software applications geared toward computational crafts (HyperGami, HyperSpider, and MachineShop). Each of these systems highlights its own particular set of issues relevant to the development of output technolo-gies. Using these three systems as objects-to-think-with, the paper describes a wide variety of possible <b>craft</b> <b>activities</b> that could be invented or pursued in the near future with the aid of appropriately designed output devices...|$|R

40|$|The fourth age, as {{the last}} stage of life, {{represents}} a final challenge to find personal meaning {{in the face of}} changing capacities, illness and disability. Participation in valued activities is important for sustaining interest in life and has been associated with enhanced health and well-being. Art and <b>craft</b> <b>activities</b> are a popular form of participation among women in late life with growing international interest in the potential for these types of activities to maintain health and well-being and address problems of social isolation. Drawing on open text comments from 114 women enrolled in the Australian Longitudinal Study on Women’s Health and in-depth interviews with 23 women all aged in their eighties, this paper explores the nature of older women’s participation in art and <b>craft</b> <b>activities</b> and conceptualises links between participation in these activities and health and well-being in late life. Participation in art and <b>craft</b> <b>activities</b> is complex and dynamic, comprising cognitive and physical processes infused with emotion and occurs in the context of social relationships, physical spaces, physical ailments and beliefs about the value of the activities. By participating in art and <b>craft</b> <b>activities,</b> older women find purpose in their lives, contributing to their own psychological well-being while helping and being appreciated by others. They develop a self view as enabled and as such take on new art and craft challenges, continue to learn and develop as art and craft makers and remain open to new possibilities...|$|R

40|$|This {{appendix}} {{presents the}} methodology {{used to estimate}} the potential cancer risk from exposure to diesel particulate matter (PM) emissions from intrastate locomotives and harbor craft activities.

The assumptions used to determine these risks are not based on a specific intrastate locomotive or harbor <b>craft</b> <b>activity</b> pattern. Instead, source parameters that represent possible operating scenarios were used. These estimated risks are used to provide an approximate range of potential risk levels from intrastate locomotive and harbor craft activities. Actual risk levels will vary due to site specific parameters, including the number of locomotives or harbor craft, the operation or activity, emission rates, operating schedules, site configuration, site meteorology, and distance to receptors. The methodology used in this risk assessment is consistent with the Tier- 1 analysis presented i...|$|E
30|$|We {{propose that}} {{computational}} surgery is first {{the result of}} the marriage of progress in manipulation and biology. However, this new field goes beyond that fusion, presenting a cohort of clinical specific challenges resists predictable scientific constructs. Surgery as a science is by nature experimental. As a process, surgery is evolving from a <b>craft</b> <b>activity</b> to an industrial process being performed in a challenging economical context. Computer science has revolutionized the operating room: most new devices are computerized; the operating room is filled with digital equipment that assists and records the operation. Quality and efficiency goals promote mutation of the individual work of a surgeon toward a predictable, error-free sequence in a quantified world. The scientific-recorded activity of surgery and its everyday use on patients produce enormous volumes of digital data demanding enhanced methods for data representation and medical informatics processing with the goal of improving the surgical process. Computational surgery is then, additionally, a technique to improve the surgical process by systematic analysis of a large volume of digital data.|$|E
