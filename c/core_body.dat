5|$|In rodents and primates, {{sufficiently}} {{high doses}} of amphetamine cause dopaminergic neurotoxicity, or damage to dopamine neurons, which is characterized by dopamine terminal degeneration and reduced transporter and receptor function. There {{is no evidence that}} amphetamine is directly neurotoxic in humans. However, large doses of amphetamine may indirectly cause dopaminergic neurotoxicity as a result of hyperpyrexia, the excessive formation of reactive oxygen species, and increased autoxidation of dopamine. Animal models of neurotoxicity from high-dose amphetamine exposure indicate that the occurrence of hyperpyrexia (i.e., <b>core</b> <b>body</b> temperature≥40°C) is necessary for the development of amphetamine-induced neurotoxicity. Prolonged elevations of brain temperature above 40°C likely promote the development of amphetamine-induced neurotoxicity in laboratory animals by facilitating the production of reactive oxygen species, disrupting cellular protein function, and transiently increasing blood–brain barrier permeability.|$|E
5|$|The {{ranges of}} the American and Chinese {{alligator}} extend into regions that sometimes experience periods of frost in winter. Being ectothermic, the internal body temperature of crocodilians falls {{as the temperature}} drops, and they become sluggish. They may become more active on warm days, but do not usually feed at all during the winter. In cold weather, they remain submerged with their tails in deeper, less cold water and their nostrils just projecting through the surface. If ice forms on the water, they maintain ice-free breathing holes, {{and there have been}} occasions when their snouts have become frozen into the ice. Temperature sensing probes implanted in wild American alligators have found that their <b>core</b> <b>body</b> temperatures can descend to around , but as long as they remain able to breathe they show no ill effects when the weather warms up.|$|E
5|$|An elephant's skull is {{resilient}} {{enough to}} withstand the forces generated by the leverage of the tusks and head-to-head collisions. The back of the skull is flattened and spread out, creating arches that protect the brain in every direction. The skull contains air cavities (sinuses) that reduce {{the weight of the}} skull while maintaining overall strength. These cavities give the inside of the skull a honeycomb-like appearance. The cranium is particularly large and provides enough room for the attachment of muscles to support the entire head. The lower jaw is solid and heavy. Because {{of the size of the}} head, the neck is relatively short to provide better support. Lacking a lacrimal apparatus, the eye relies on the harderian gland to keep it moist. A durable nictitating membrane protects the eye globe. The animal's field of vision is compromised by the location and limited mobility of the eyes. Elephants are considered dichromats and they can see well in dim light but not in bright light. The <b>core</b> <b>body</b> temperature averages , similar to that of a human. Like all mammals, an elephant can raise or lower its temperature a few degrees from the average in response to extreme environmental conditions.|$|E

The lowest recorded <b>body</b> <b>core</b> temperatures of all eleven subjects ranged from 34.7 to 36.7 °C with a mean of 36.0 °C.

The unchanged <b>body</b> <b>core</b> temperature was most probably due to his high body fat. In the case study of Knechtle et al. (2009), the successful swimmer who completed 2.2  km in water of 4 °C had a <b>body</b> <b>core</b> temperature of 32 °C after getting out of the water. The body fat percentage of the swimmer was only 23.4 %, compared to the 44.8 % of the present swimmer with the lowest <b>body</b> <b>core</b> temperature of 34.5 °C after the first ‘Ice Mile’. The difference of ~ 2.5 °C in <b>body</b> <b>core</b> temperature is very likely due to the ~ 21 % difference in body fat percentage.|$|R

40|$|INTRODUCTION 'Ice Mile' {{swimming}} {{is a new}} {{discipline in}} open-water swimming introduced in 2009. This case study investigated changes in <b>body</b> <b>core</b> temperature during preparation for and completion of two official 'Ice Miles', defined as swimming 1. 609 km in water of 5 °C or colder, in one swimmer. CASE DESCRIPTION One experienced ice swimmer (56 years old, 110. 2 kg body mass, 1. 76 m body height, BMI of 35. 6 kg/m(2), 44. 8 % body fat) recorded data including time, distance and <b>body</b> <b>core</b> temperature from 65 training units and two 'Ice Miles'. DISCUSSION AND EVALUATION During training and the 'Ice Miles', <b>body</b> <b>core</b> temperature was measured using a thermoelectric probe before, during and after swimming. During trainings and the 'Ice Miles', <b>body</b> <b>core</b> temperature increased after start, dropped during swimming but was lowest during recovery. During training, <b>body</b> <b>core</b> temperature at start was the only predictor (ß = - 0. 233, p = 0. 025) for the increase in <b>body</b> <b>core</b> temperature. Water temperature (ß = 0. 07, p = 0. 006) and <b>body</b> <b>core</b> temperature at start (ß = - 0. 90, p = 0. 006) explained 61 % of the variance for the non-significant decrease in <b>body</b> <b>core</b> temperature. Water temperature (ß = 0. 077, p = 0. 0059) and <b>body</b> <b>core</b> temperature at finish (ß = 0. 444, p = 0. 02) {{were the most important}} predictors for the lowest <b>body</b> <b>core</b> temperature. In 'Ice Miles', <b>body</b> <b>core</b> temperature was highest ~ 6 - 18 min after the start (38. 3 - 38. 4 °C), dropped during swimming by 1. 7 °C to ~ 36. 5 °C and was lowest ~ 40 - 56 min after finish. The lowest <b>body</b> <b>core</b> temperature (34. 5 - 35. 0 °C) was achieved ~ 100 min after start. CONCLUSIONS In an experienced ice swimmer with a high BMI (> 35 kg/m(2)) and a high percent body fat (~ 45 %), <b>body</b> <b>core</b> temperature decreased by 1. 7 °C while swimming and by 3. 2 - 3. 7 °C after the swim to reach the lowest temperature in an official 'Ice Mile'. The swimmer suffered no hypothermia during ice swimming, but <b>body</b> <b>core</b> temperature dropped to < 36 °C after ice swimming. Future athletes intending to swim an 'Ice Mile' should be aware that a large body fat prevents from suffering hypothermia during ice swimming, but not after ice swimming...|$|R

30|$|This {{case study}} {{investigated}} changes in <b>body</b> <b>core</b> temperature in an experienced ice swimmer during preparation for and completion of two official ‘Ice Miles’.

25|$|When someone feels {{left out}} of a situation, they feel {{excluded}} and one possible side effect is for their body temperature to decrease.

30|$|This {{case report}} shows that an {{experienced}} ice swimmer {{with a high}} BMI and high body fat percentage suffered no hypothermia during ice swimming.

25|$|There {{are several}} {{hypotheses}} why most boreotherian mammals have external testes which operate best at a temperature that is {{slightly less than}} the <b>core</b> <b>body</b> temperature, e.g. that it is stuck with enzymes evolved in a colder temperature due to external testes evolving for different reasons, that the lower temperature of the testes simply is more efficient for sperm production.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to compare the acute hepatic {{response}} to diet modification and exercise-induced endotoxemia, and to determine if associations exist between liver damage markers, <b>body</b> <b>core</b> temperature, and IL- 6 responses to a laboratory-based duathlon. Eleven moderately-trained healthy males followed a low-carbohydrate (CHO) and a high CHO diet to change their glycogen stores two-days before completing a duathlon. Blood samples were obtained at rest, immediately after and 1 - and 2 -h following the duathlon for determination of endotoxin-lipopolysaccharide binding protein (LPS-LBP) complex, IL- 6, and liver integrity markers AST, ALT, and AST/ALT ratio. Hydration status and <b>body</b> <b>core</b> temperature were assessed at rest, during, and after the duathlon. Athletes were more dehydrated and had higher AST/ALT ratios in the low- compared to the high-CHO diet trial regardless of the measurement time (p< 0. 05). IL- 6 increased from resting to immediately after, 1 - and 2 -h following duathlon regardless of the diet (p< 0. 05). A higher LPS-LBP complex concentration was observed from rest to immediately after the duathlon. No significant correlations were found between LPS-LBP complex levels and <b>body</b> <b>core</b> temperature. In conclusion, athletes on a low-CHO diet showed higher hepatic structural damage and finished more dehydrated compared to athletes on a high-CHO diet. <b>Body</b> <b>core</b> temperature and LPS-LBP complex levels were unrelated beyond the increase in <b>body</b> <b>core</b> temperature explained by exercise.

25|$|Similarly {{to other}} {{sedative}} hypnotic drugs, zopiclone causes {{a decrease in}} the <b>core</b> <b>body</b> temperature and is effective in decreasing sleep latency. It causes similar alterations on EEG readings and sleep architecture as benzodiazepines and causes disturbances in sleep architecture on withdrawal as part of its rebound effect. Zopiclone reduces both delta waves and the number of high-amplitude delta waves whilst increasing low-amplitude waves. Zopiclone reduces the total amount of time spent in REM sleep as well as delaying its onset. Cognitive behavioral therapy {{has been found to be}} superior to zopiclone in the treatment of insomnia and has been found to have lasting effects on sleep quality for at least a year after therapy.|$|E
25|$|Delayed sleep phase {{disorder}} (DSPD), {{more often}} known as delayed sleep phase syndrome {{and also as}} delayed sleep-wake phase disorder, is a chronic dysregulation of a person's circadian rhythm (biological clock), compared {{to the general population}} and relative to societal norms. The disorder affects the timing of sleep, peak period of alertness, the <b>core</b> <b>body</b> temperature rhythm, and hormonal and other daily cycles. People with DSPD generally fall asleep some hours after midnight and have difficulty waking up in the morning. People with DSPD probably have a circadian period significantly longer than 24 hours.

The endogenous circadian pacemaker generates the 24-hour circadian rhythm that regulates subjective alertness and sleep propensity as well as <b>core</b> <b>body</b> temperature, cognitive functions, and melatonin secretion, as described above. It is also highly sensitive to light, which is its primary synchronization. Misalignment of the circadian rhythm results in disturbed sleep, impaired performance alertness, waking-hour melatonin secretion, and reduced levels of nocturnal secretion of growth hormone. The outcome, therefore, can range from performance error to long-term health decrements.|$|E
