40|$|The {{success of}} supply chains, {{whether they are}} wholeof- {{industry}} chains or internal business chains, depends on integration, <b>coordination,</b> communication <b>and</b> <b>cooperation.</b> However, {{one of the key}} issues faced by enterprises within a supply chain is the tendency for each component in the supply chain to have different goals – particularly since each component is very often an autonomous business unit. This situation can, and very often does, result in a lack of integration, <b>coordination,</b> communication <b>and</b> thus <b>cooperation.</b> This paper describes the use of agent based modeling techniques to investigate whether the distributed computing concept of Integrated Autonomy could also be promoted as a business strategy for managing agrifood supply chains in order to increase efficiencies <b>and</b> <b>coordination</b> across the chain. The results of modeling two different supply chain scenarios in both an industry and in an enterprise environment indicate that IA as a concept can be translated into a practical management strategy with associated performance metrics aimed at increasing efficiencies, <b>coordination</b> <b>and</b> communication across supply chains...|$|R
