40|$|Abstract Background Medical {{research}} {{has not been}} able to establish whether a father's occupational exposures are associated with the development of acute leukemia (AL) in their offspring. The studies conducted have weaknesses that have generated a misclassification of such exposure. Occupations and exposures to substances associated with childhood cancer are not very frequently encountered in the general population; thus, the reported risks are both inconsistent and inaccurate. In this study, to assess exposure we used a new method, an exposure index, which took into consideration the industrial branch, specific position, use of protective equipment, substances at work, degree of contact with such substances, and time of exposure. This index allowed us to obtain a grade, which permitted the identification of individuals according to their level of exposure to known or potentially <b>carcinogenic</b> <b>agents</b> that are not necessarily specifically identified as risk factors for leukemia. The aim of this study was to determine the association between a father's occupational exposure to <b>carcinogenic</b> <b>agents</b> and the presence of AL in their offspring. Methods From 1999 to 2000, a case-control study was performed with 193 children who reside in Mexico City and had been diagnosed with AL. The initial sample-size calculation was 150 children per group, assessed with an expected odds ratio (OR) of three and a minimum exposure frequency of 15. 8 %. These children were matched by age, sex, and institution with 193 pediatric surgical patients at secondary-care hospitals. A questionnaire was used to determine each child's background and the characteristics of the father's occupation(s). In order to determine the level of exposure to <b>carcinogenic</b> <b>agents,</b> a previously validated exposure index (occupational exposure index, OEI) was used. The consistency and validity of the index were assessed by a questionnaire comparison, the sensory recognition of the work area, and an expert's opinion. Results The adjusted ORs and 95 % confidence intervals (CI) were 1. 69 (0. 98, 2. 92) during the preconception period; 1. 98 (1. 13, 3. 45) during the index pregnancy; 2. 11 (1. 17, 3. 78) during breastfeeding period; 2. 17 (1. 28, 3. 66) after birth; and 2. 06 (1. 24, 3. 42) for global exposure. Conclusion This is the first study in which an OEI was used to assess a father's occupational exposure to <b>carcinogenic</b> <b>agents</b> as a risk factor for the development of childhood AL in his offspring. From our results, we conclude that children whose fathers have been exposed to a high level of <b>carcinogenic</b> <b>agents</b> seem to have a greater risk of developing acute leukemia.

40|$|IN work {{related to}} the {{causation}} of human lung cancer, some investigators, appreciating the proposed special cancer environment of the cigarette smoker, seek to support this proposition by discovery of new <b>carcinogenic</b> <b>agents</b> or adjuvant factors in cigarette smoke, to which non-smokers are not especially exposed.

40|$|Background Aspartame (APM) is a {{well-known}} intense artificial sweetener used in more than 6, 000 products. Among the major users of aspartame are children and women of childbearing age. In previous lifespan experiments conducted on Sprague–Dawley rats we have shown that APM is a <b>carcinogenic</b> <b>agent</b> in multiple sites and that its effects are increased when exposure starts from prenatal life. Objective The {{aim of this study}} is to evaluate the potential of APM to induce carcinogenic effects in mice. Methods Six groups of 62 – 122 male and female Swissmicewere treatedwithAPM in feed at doses of 32, 000, 16, 000, 8, 000, 2, 000, or 0 ppm from prenatal life (12 days of gestation) until death. At death each animal underwent complete necropsy and all tissues and organs of all animals in the experiment were microscopically examined. Results APM in our experimental conditions induces in males a significant dose-related increased incidence of hepatocellular carcinomas (P< 0. 01), and a significant increase at the dose levels of 32, 000 ppm (P< 0. 01) and 16, 000 ppm (P< 0. 05).

Many <b>carcinogenic</b> <b>agents</b> (chemicals, radiations and viruses) are known to depress some immunological functions. Although correlation between the degree of immune depression and carcinogenic potency is imperfect (Berenbaum, 1964), there have been suggestions that the process of carcinogenesis may necessarily involve interference with the immunological response of the host (Rubin, 1960; Prehn, 1963; Burnet, 1964).

We examined whether distinct chemical carci-nogens induce a unique transcriptional profile in mam-mary gland cancer that is characteristic of the etiologic agent. Rat mammary gland cancers (n 34) were gener-ated by various carcinogens, including the food-derived heterocyclic amines 2 -amino- 1 -methyl- 6 -phenylimidazo [4, 5 -b]pyridine and 2 -amino- 3, 8 -dimethylimidazo[4, 5 -f] quinoxaline, 7, 12 -dimethylbenz[a]anthracene, N-nitro-somethylurea and 4 -aminobiphenyl. The histopathology of the carcinomas was graded using a modified Scarff-Bloom [...] Richardson scheme and the gene expression pro-files in the carcinomas were evaluated on a 10 K cDNA microarray. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering analysis revealed two major clusters of carcinomas irrespective of the <b>carcinogenic</b> <b>agent</b> that distinguished two groups with different histopathological parameters (degree of differen-tiation, nuclear grade, mitotic activity, epithelial cell growth pattern and necrosis). Using class comparison analysis and hierarchical clustering of all carcinomas irres-pective of histopathology, gene expression profiles were further shown to be statistically differentially expressed according to the <b>carcinogenic</b> <b>agent.</b> These findings indi-cate that the transcriptional program in carcinomas is unique to the etiologic agent and can be observed among a diverse set of carcinogens despite variations in carcinoma histopathology. The ability to use microarray analysis to discern an etiology-specific profile among a pathologically heterogeneous group of breast carcinomas may ultimately be valuable in determining the role of environmental chemical carcinogens in human breast cancer risk...|$|E
