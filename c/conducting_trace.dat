40|$|Background {{interferences}} {{are perhaps}} an unavoidable part of analytical detection schemes, particularly when analyzing trace level samples or when using detectors {{with high levels}} of sensitivity. In liquid chromatography, mobile phase solvents are routinely filtered using membrane filter disks to trap particulates in hopes of minimizing contamination, providing improvements in data output and instrumental operation. In this study, we report that one such filter disk leads to a significant level of contamination in LC and LC/MS experiments. Extractable compounds from nylon membrane filters generate significant background signals in UV absorption chromatograms at 214 nm, and are also detected by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry, with nominal m/z values of 453 and 679. It is shown that rinsing the nylon membranes before their use can reduce, but will not eliminate, the extractable contaminants from the mobile phase. Through MS and tandem MS analysis, we have identified these contaminants as cyclic oligomers of polyamide 66. Based on these results, it is recommended that nylon membrane filters be avoided when <b>conducting</b> <b>trace</b> level analysis, particularly when conducting LC/MS experiments...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—In model storage systems, the {{multilevel}} buffer caches hierarchy {{is widely}} used to improve the I/O performance of disks. In the hierarchy, the referenced pages in second-level buffer cache have larger reuse distance that {{is the number of}} accesses between two references to the same block in a reference sequence. These reuse distances have close value with their lifetime- the time they are conserved in buffer cache. Therefore, this tiny difference can be more easily eliminated by the prefetched (not yet accessed) data that reduces the lifetime of referenced pages. This leads more pages than those replaced by prefetching to lose their re-access opportunity. This anomaly influence can significantly reduce the overall hit ratio of buffer cache and, unfortunately, it is ignored by traditional sequential prefetching algorithms. To address this problem, we propose an Adaptive SEquential Prefetching (named ASEP) that uncovers this anomaly influence and adaptively adjusts the prefetching depth by considering the access characteristics in second-level buffer cache. We extensively evaluate ASEP by <b>conducting</b> <b>trace</b> driven experiments with a prototype implements in Linux (software RAID-MD). The experiments ’ results, under varied workloads from transaction processing applications to Web searching applications, show that ASEP outperforms the default sequential prefetching scheme in Linux kernel and other heuristic schemes, with the response time improvement by up to 49. 7 % and the cache hit ratio improvement ranging from 0. 2 ~ 8. 5 %...|$|E
40|$|The North American {{landscape}} changed tremendously {{following the}} arrival of European settlers. Before European arrival, New England’s landscape was primarily forested. As Europeans moved inland from the eastern seaboard, they cleared the forest for settlement and agricultural use. Eventually the Industrial Revolution made {{a different kind of}} mark on the landscape. Starting in the late 1790 s, the textile mill industry developed throughout the region. Mills were located along swift moving rivers, which later produced power when dams were created along them. Following the early 1900 s mill production decreased, leading to the abandonment of many mills and their adjacent dammed mill ponds. However, the environmental changes wrought by the mill ponds still exist in New England’s landscape. Large volumes of fine sediment have since built up in some of these former mill ponds and concerns about the sediment and water quality have become widespread. Today many former textile mill rivers throughout the U. S and Europe have been tested in an attempt to determine current contamination levels and to apply appropriate strategies if necessary to reduce pollutants to acceptable levels. Little is known about water and sediment quality of the former mill ponds in Scituate, Rhode Island. This research sought to address this problem by <b>conducting</b> <b>trace</b> metal testing of two mill ponds in the Scituate River Watershed: Peabody Pond and Jordon Pond. Results revealed that both ponds contain pollutants from present and past sources, but that contemporary land use practices may be the most harmful to water and sediment quality. Existing mill metal piping left on the landscape and present-day motorways and urban runoff contain large quantities of suspended solids such as copper, lead and zinc with lead showing the highest concentration levels of all metals tested. This research demonstrates that our past landscape activities, specifically New England’s historic textile production, still influences present environmental conditions, and that as human activities on the landscape change, so do threats to environmental quality...|$|E

In a frequency range below 200 MHz radiation from cables is often the dominant emission factor. In higher frequency ranges radiation from PCBs and their housing becomes more relevant.

40|$|As modern-day {{solar cells}} are made {{increasingly}} thin and large, {{it is very}} important for the manufacturer to be able to detect cracks in the finished product. When the cells are to be installed in spacecraft or large panel arrays, it is difficult or impossible to replace faulty cells. Small cracks present during manufacturing may not cause significant performance problems immediately; the affected cells may fail at a later time due to thermal cycling or physical shock. Visual, thermal, and infrared methods of inspection have many limitations and often miss detecting cracks. In this paper we present experimental results obtained from eddy-current measurements that were used to infer locations of cracks in solarcells. EMF measurements were made using primarily hand-wound sensors excited by various current sources. The eddy-current measurements indicated <b>conducting</b> <b>traces</b> on the cells and cracks in the material that could be visually verified.

This {{article is}} {{published}} with open access at Springerlink. com Abstract Neuro-prosthetic devices aim to restore impaired function through artificial {{stimulation of the}} nervous system.

40|$|AbstractThe {{unimolecular}} {{chemistry of}} protonated formic acid, [HCOOH]H+, {{has been investigated}} by analyzing the fragmentation of metastable ions (MI) during flight in a sector mass spectrometer, and by proton transfer to formic acid in a Fourier-transform ion cyclotron resonance (FT-ICR) mass spectrometer. High level ab initio calculations {{have been used to}} model the relevant parts of the potential energy surface (PES). In addition, ab initio direct dynamics calculations have been <b>conducted,</b> <b>tracing</b> out 60 different reaction trajectories. The only stable isomer in the mass spectrometric experiments is HC(OH) 2 +, which is the precursor to both observed ionic products, HCO+ and H 3 O+, via the same saddle point of the potential energy surface. The detailed motion of the dissociating molecule during passage of the post-transition state region of the PES therefore determines which product ion is formed. After passing the TS a transient HC(O) OH 2 + molecule is first formed. High total energy increases the probability that the nascent water molecule will have sufficient speed to escape the HCO+ moiety. Otherwise, typically at low energies, the two units recombine, upon which intra-complex proton transfer is very likely. Eventually, this will give the more stable H 3 O+...|$|R

40|$|The ‘bottom of the pyramid’ (BoP) {{refers to}} the world’s poorest {{socio-economic}} group. In South Africa, consumers in this segment are an increasingly attractive target market for multi-national corporations (MNCs), partly because they constitute {{more than one-third of}} the population. However, a key managerial challenge remains in distributing goods and services to these consumers. This research sought to identify the alternative channels of distribution that firms develop to reach the BoP. Using a qualitative research methodology, eighteen depth interviews were <b>conducted</b> <b>tracing</b> the channels of seven firms from firm to end-user. The results suggest that many MNCs are indeed developing BoP channels, with varying degrees of success. Further, success seems to be driven by the level of managerial commitment. In addition, the BoP in South Africa is best understood as two distinct sub-segments, the urban BoP is characterised by more competition and crime, while the rural BoP has lower population density which heightens logistical challenges. Community involvement, where locals serve as distributors or salespeople, is a central feature of successful strategies to reach the BoP. Finally, the findings suggest that alternative distribution channels present benefits for MNCs in terms of cost to serve, local knowledge and increased penetration.

However, traditional nanophotonics options face limitations such as large device footprints compared with electronics, higher static power due to continuous laser operation, and an upper limit on achievable data rates due to large device capacitances. Nanoplasmonics is an emerging technology that has the potential for providing transformative gains on multiple metrics due to its potential to increase the light-matter interaction. In this paper, we propose and analyze a hybrid opto-electric NoC that incorporates Hybrid Plasmonics Photonics Interconnect (HyPPI), an optical interconnect that combines photonics with plasmonics. We explore various opto-electronic network hybridization options by augmenting a mesh network with HyPPI links, and compare them with the equivalent options afforded by conventional nanophotonics as well as pure electronics. Our design space exploration indicates that augmenting an electronic NoC with HyPPI gives a performance to cost ratio improvement of up to 1. 8 x. To further validate our estimates, we <b>conduct</b> <b>trace</b> based simulations using the NAS Parallel Benchmark suite. These benchmarks show latency improvements up to 1. 64 x, with negligible energy increase.
