40|$|THAI-"Toe-to-Heel" Air Injection, {{is a new}} EOR process, which {{integrates}} {{advanced technology}} and horizontal well concepts, to achieve a potentially very high recovery of heavy oil. It can also realize very substantial in situ upgrading by thermal cracking, producing upgraded oil to the surface. The process operates in a gravity stabilized manner by restricting drainage to a narrow mobile zone. This causes the flow of mobilized fluids to enter directly into the exposed section of a horizontal production well. The process can be operated on primary production, as new technology, as a follow-up to existing technologies, or as a co-process where the advantages of high thermal efficiency are equired. This is achieved by concentrating the energy required for oil mobilization, recovery and thermal upgrading in the reservoir. Combined with clean technology design, THAI offers pathway, to future economic success for the heavy oil industry. Three-dimensional, semi-scaled experimental tests on light "Forties Mix" oil (30. 7 °CDATA[API), Clair, West of Shetlands medium heavy oil (20. 8 °CDATA[API), and heavy Wolf Lake oil (10. 95 °CDATA[API) show that a well-controlled, narrow mobile oil zone is created {{just ahead of the}} combustion front. The width of this narrow zone depends on the characteristics of the heavy oil at reservoir conditions {{and the degree to which}} the very high viscosity of the <b>cold</b> <b>oil</b> seals the horizontal producer well.

40|$|The {{motive for}} {{conducting}} this experiment was {{to observe the}} effects of the environment at a microscopic level to see whether the organisms would thrive or decline in health. The hypothesis of the organisms’ outcome in the different environments was that when they were kept in different conditions, things about their group would change compared to each other, such as amount, pH, and movement. The problem that is being focused on is what would happen to smaller level organisms when put in real life environmental scenarios. The different species of amoebas and protozoa were mixed together in a large container and then were separated equally into smaller containers or 2 ̆ 2 environments 2 ̆ 2 to imitate real world situations. They were left there for 7 days to resemble just a small amount of time in the outside world. The results of the experiment showed that when microscopic organisms were placed in different environments, their amount (quantity), speed, and pH level were affected. The four different environments that were imitated in this experiment were Global Warming (hot), Global Cooling (<b>cold),</b> <b>Oil</b> Spill (oil), and a Disease Outbreak (E.

To record the results, a 1 to 10 scale was created to track movement (1 being least active and 10 being most active), and pH level was checked daily in all of the environments. In the hot environment, there was a large decrease in water, which lead to death of the amoebas and a movement level of 0, while their average pH level was recorded as an 8. The cold environment showed a significant decrease in the movement of the amoebas, putting them as a number 2 on the movement scale, but still having a pH of 7. 5. In the oil filled environment, the algae became attached to the organisms, inhibiting their movement resulting in a 6 on the scale and changing their average pH level to the basic number 8.

40|$|Deposited with {{permission}} of the author © 2008 Faisal Samad LodiThe thesis presents research in achieving faster warm-up of an SI engine, thereby affecting the fuel economy penalty. The faster warm-up relates to faster heating of the cylinder head and engine block, targeting reducing viscous friction in the <b>cold</b> <b>oil</b> as the most likely candidate to improve. The strategy applied was to reduce the coolant flow circulation rate to achieve a faster warm-up of the engine. A lumped parameter model for engine heat transfer, coolant flow and heat capacities, in a single cylinder, based on engine operating points like spark advance, engine speed and MAP was built in Modelica. The engine used for experimentation was a Ford in-line, 4 stroke, 6 -cylinder engine, with a compression ratio of 10. 3 : 1, in which 56 K-type thermocouples were installed at different locations to measure the temperature. The experiments were performed with varying coolant flow rate from normal down to zero, utilizing an electric water pump, over an approximation to the New European Drive Cycle (NEDC), at a speed of 1161 rev/min and load of 48 Nm. The selected speed and load were the average operating condition for 180 seconds of engine running over the urban part of a simulated NEDC. In addition, the coolant circuit was modified to a split cooling supply and the sets of results analyzed to find the reduction in engine warm-up time and fuel consumption. It is shown from the results that the warm-up time of the engine and the fuel consumption were notably reduced, as the flow was reduced from maximum to minimum in steps. On average over an interval of engine running for 300 seconds from cold start, the cylinder head temperature was increased by about 2 °C, the average engine block temperature was increased by about 6. 5 °C and the average cylinder head coolant temperature was increased by about 4 °C. However, the bulk temperature of the oil in the oil sump showed marginal improvement and remained consistent, even at the lowest coolant flow rate. Nonetheless, the improvements in block temperature had significant effects on reducing the friction between the piston and cylinder walls. Analysis of {{the results show that}} the coolant flow pattern changed with the use of an electric water pump. The flow is less evenly distributed around the cylinders with the use of an electric water pump, whilst retaining the mechanical water pump body, compared to the mechanical water pump operation. The model was applied to simulate for two engine operating points, i. e., 1161 rev/min, 48 Nm load and 700 rev/min and 0 Nm load. The model was calibrated at 1161 rev/min, 48 Nm load and validated at 700 rev/min, 0 Nm load. The modeling results were in fair agreement with the experimental results. The model can be employed to investigate electric water pump control. The important finding is that around 3 % fuel consumption savings are possible over the NEDC by management strategies that lead to faster cylinder block warm up, even though this may result in little or no change in oil temperature as measured in the sump.

40|$|Due to {{reduction}} {{of high quality}} oil resources and consequently increase of oil price around the world, new sources of energy should be found to relief the high demand of energy. Hence, countries like Venezuela, United States and particularly Canada came up with their unconventional reservoirs which contain bitumen, extra heavy oil and heavy oil as remarkable sources of energy. Exploitation of such kind of reservoirs was not beneficial {{in the past but}} in recent years due to the increase of oil price tendency to production from heavy oil reservoirs has incredibly increased. The known amounts of heavy oil reserves are 3, 396 billion barrels of initial oil in place, including 30 billion barrels as futuristic additional oil. The whole discovered bitumen reserves are about 5, 505 billion barrels of initial oil in place, including 993 billion barrels as futuristic additional oil. Cold Lake, Athabasca and Peace River which possess more than 60 % of total natural bitumen resources are located in Alberta State of Canada. In this work Athabasca bitumen was used to saturate the porous media and initialize the experimental model. There are different methods to produce from unconventional heavy oil reservoirs based on the principle of lowering bitumen and heavy oil intrinsic viscosity. This reduction may be performed using injection of steam inside the reservoir (increasing the temperature of reservoir contents) or by dissolution of special solvents into the bitumen (solvent injection) or by use of benefits of both of them. Hot water injection, in-situ combustion, steam-assisted gravity drainage (SAGD) and cyclic steam stimulation (CSS) are examples of thermal processes and vapor extraction (VAPEX) is an example of solvent injection method. Among the thermal processes, SAGD is the most efficient and promising method which was pioneered and developed by Butler et al. (1981 b). This method benefits from advantage of horizontal well technology which has a greater contact area to the reservoir. With the remarkable advance in the drilling and reservoir engineering of horizontal well technology, and more successful reports on operations of horizontal wells around the world, the SAGD process, {{became one of the most}} important means of producing bitumen. Gravity drainage is the principal mechanism of recovery process that helps to recover melted, mobile bitumen together with the amounts of steam which are condensed due to contact with <b>cold</b> <b>oil</b> at the boundary of steam chamber via horizontal production well. However, SAGD process has some deficiencies in practical implementation. To overcome these problems, several researchers conducted many experiments and tried different methods and theories. Among these methods, hybrid processes seems to be the best solution and alternative to SAGD. Hybrid processes benefit from advantages of SAGD and VAPEX as the main concept is based on gravity drainage but here, light hydrocarbons are co-injected with steam to improve bitumen viscosity reduction. There is a possibility to build a model physically or numerically and use it for many times to evaluate the special process and find out which parameters are most effective in the production process while the reservoir can only be produced once and then it is not possible to return its conditions to the original conditions. Hence, any fault and mistake is irrecoverable in a real case. The first-hand target of this research was to investigate and evaluate the performance of SAGD and hybrid processes by laboratory test and simulation studies. Expanding-solvent SAGD (ESSAGD) and steam alternating solvent (SAS) are examples of hybrid processes which were investigated by laboratory experiments and simulation studies in this thesis in addition to the SAGD process. Before performing the laboratory tests and simulation studies, first of all it is necessary to perceive the fluid properties (PVT data), fluid-fluid and rock-fluid interaction parameters. The composition of Athabasca bitumen, density and viscosity as fluid properties and interfacial tension between steam and bitumen as fluid-fluid interaction parameter were measured and obtained experimentally. These properties were utilized in simulation studies. Furthermore, a cylindrical model packed with 2 mm sized glass beads were used to conduct the experiments of SAGD, ES-SAGD and SAS processes. Also, the effect of steam injection rate on SAGD performance, impact of solvent injection rate and type on ES-SAGD performance were investigated and eventually all of these processes were compared based on several efficiency indicators. Results divulged that SAS and ES-SAGD represent better recovery factor and lower amount of cumulative steam-oil ratio (CSOR) which are the two main economic factors for evaluation of these processes. However, higher steam injection rate showed higher recovery factor at the expense of higher CSOR in SAGD process. To investigate the solvent type effect on ES-SAGD performance three light hydrocarbons namely, n-pentane, n-hexane and n-heptane were used. Among them pentane yields the best performance at the experimental conditions. Moreover, higher injection rate of solvent displayed promising performance in ES-SAGD. Nowadays, by development of computer technology and thanks to the commercial numerical simulators, the petroleum engineers are able to simulate the real processes and history match the real case data in order to find the future economical plateau. The numerical models have more flexibility in changing parameters which are important for researchers. However, there are some disadvantages in numerical simulations as they can only be used to predict the approximate gross performance of a reservoir. Nevertheless, the simulation model is useful to history match the experimental and field results in order to give us the better understanding of the mechanisms which are involved in the special process. In addition, some researchers were benefited from numerical results to adjust their physical models. However, several field scale simulation studies were carried out to compare the aforementioned processes. Results of simulation studies confirmed that ES-SAGD and SAS are more efficient and prosperous than SAGD process. Also, impacts of various geological and operational parameters were investigated for all processes.

Ce mode d'écoulement, qui ne fait pas intervenir A previous paper [1] {{described an}} experimental device {{designed for the}} study of multiphase displacements by hot fluids in porous media under isothermal conditions together with the results obtained. This type of flow, which {{does not take into account}} the progress of temperature fronts, is not representative of what actually happens in the field when a thermal enhanced oil recovery method is applied. In fact in this case, flows may be considered as quasiadiabatic. To gain a better understanding of the phenomena induced by such adiabatic displacements, new equipment was designed to reproduce conditions close to those in the field. Various experiments were modeled with a simulator developed at Institut Français du Pétrole (IFP), using results obtained under isothermal conditions (for instance, relative permeability curves). There is good agreement between experiments and computation. These experimental results were then compared to those obtained under isothermal conditions. Some hypotheses are put forward to explain the differences observed between the two types of flows. Experiments were carried out in unconsolidated cores made of packed sand. This sand mainly consisted of silica (over 99 weight %). Grain size was between 60 and 100 microns; the corresponding permeability was about 4. 10 to the power of (- 12) m². The fluids consisted of distilled water and Albelf C- 68 oil. New equipment was designed because of problems related to heat losses. For slow displacement rates at high temperatures, a small heat loss results in a decrease in temperature and therefore in steam condensation. Use of nonmetallic parts for the core-holder strongly reduces heat losses radially and longitudinally so that no heating collars are necessary. The experimental device shown in Figs. 1 and 2 can work under either isothermal or adiabatic conditions. It is designed to operate up to 250 °C and 20 bar. The residual oil saturations after steam injection are calculated from the mass balance. Some of these results are shown in Table 1. The parameters modified were the injection flow rate (between 2 and 5 g/min.) and the absolute pressure at the inlet of the porous medium (between 4 and 7 bar). Figures 3 to 6 correspond to an experiment performed under the following conditions :(a) Initial condition: irreducible water saturation. (b) Injection flow rate = 2 g/min. (c) Injection temperature = 220 °C. (d) Absolute pressure at outlet = 3 bar. (e) The injected steam was slightly overheated (this allows to know what is really injected and, due to the rather low enthalpy added compared to the enthalpy of saturated steam, this does not have any significant influence on the heat balance and therefore on the displacement). This experiment shows a very clearcut steam front moving all along the tube. The entire displacement occurs under conditions corresponding to vaporization/condensation equilibrium of steam (Table 2). Experiments were modeled by the TSAR (Thermal Simulator Applied to Reservoir) simulator for thermal methods developed at IFP [2]. This 3 -D model can be used to either simulate field processes or laboratory experiments. Relative permeabilities in function of saturations and temperatures obtained from previous isothermal experiments [1] were used in the simulator. Three-phase permeabilities were computed by the Stone method [4 to 6]. For computing, the following assumptions were made :(a) The porous medium is considered to be as homogeneous and isotropic. (b) There is no interaction between fluids and the mineral phase. (c) Steam is considered to be a perfect gas. (d) Steam is injected at a constant weight rate. (e) Contact time between phases is long enough to assume that local thermodynamic equilibrium is reached. The results of the simulation of the previous experiment are shown in Figs. 8 to 12. The decrease in temperature in the core (in the experiment - Fig. 6 - as well as in the simulation - Fig. 8) corresponds to a pressure decrease along the core as the steam moves towards the outlet. This decrease does not correspond to any heat losses. In fact, as the differential pressure decreases due to oil production, the temperature of the vaporization/condensation equilibrium is reduced. This induces an evolution of the residual oil saturations along the core (Fig. 12). Steam condensation at the steam front level causes an increase in water saturation just ahead (Fig. 10). The results of isothermal [1] and adiabatic displacements in terms of residual oil saturation are given in Fig. 14. The comparison is made on the basis of the temperature corresponding to the steam front. Residual oil saturations are lower under adiabatic conditions than under isothermal conditions. This is due to the fact that the mechanisms are not the same. For our experimental conditions, the characteristics of the oil (Table 3) are such that no stripping effect of the hydrocarbon phase has to be taken into account. The most important effect is assumed to be due to the steam vaporization/condensation effects. Oil recovery is a function of the spreading coefficient for the gas/oil system on the interface with the water phase [18]. One can consider that these properties are very different for a gas/water/oil system. It is then possible that phase changes can modify the displacement and hence the oil recovery. Displacement by hot water is less stable than displacement by cold water. On the contrary, displacement by steam is far less stable than displacement by hot water [19, 20] : in the case of a two-phase displacement, viscous fingering is stabilized essentially by the capillary pressure, in the case of steam injection, condensation occurs rapidly for a gas finger entering <b>cold</b> <b>oil.</b> The main conclusions are as follows :(1) Residual oil saturations to steam after adiabatic displacements are lower than residual oil saturations after isothermal hot-water displacements. (2) Displacements by steam occur under conditions corresponding to steam/water thermodynamic equilibrium. (3) Reduction of oil saturation for adiabatic displacements by steam is mainly due to:- Phase changes inducing modifications in the capillary equilibrium;- Three-phase flow;- Displacement stabilities. (4) All the experiments were simulated very satisfactorily. This cross-checking validates both the physical and numerical models...|$|E
