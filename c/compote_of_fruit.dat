The Star Man examines the children in their catechism and rewards them with small presents if they do well, even if they need a bit of coaching. The Star Boys sing carols and are given a treat for their help. The feast begins with the appearance of the first star. The meal is followed by the exchange of gifts.The remainder of the evening is given to stories and songs around the Christmas tree. In some areas of the country, children are taught that [...] "The Little Star" [...] brings the gifts.
