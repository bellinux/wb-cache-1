The {{aim of this study}} was to determine the localization and speciation of Zn in roots of tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) grown in Zncontaminated substrates. <b>Chemical</b> <b>extractions</b> and EXAFS spectroscopy were applied on whole roots and on isolated cell walls of roots. Our results show that cell walls of roots exhibited a distribution of Zn affinity sites, from water-soluble to non-exchangeable Zn. In whole roots, Zn was bound with oxalate and other COOH/OH groups: the first species was probably intracellular while the second was attributed to Zn bound to the cell walls and, to a lesser extent, to intracellular organic acids. Moreover, Zn-phosphate was also identified, and this species was CuSO 4 -extractable.

40|$|International audienceOnly scarce {{field studies}} concern the {{consequences}} of natural soil organic matter (SOM) and metal interactions on SOM dynamics in soils. We investigated the interactions of four metals (Pb, Zn, Cu and Cd) with the SOM associated to five different size fractions (between 2000 Œºm and b 2 Œºm) of a sandy top soil contaminated by waste water. Metal, organic carbon and nitrogen concentrations were measured and <b>chemical</b> <b>extractions</b> (with Na 4 P 2 O 7 and EDTA) were also performed to assess the variations of SOM-metal interactions irrespective of the size fraction. In addition, as in that selected contaminated site, maize (C 4 plant), replaced C 3 crops 15 years ago, natural isotopic 13 C labelling gave new insights into SOM turnover. First, {{the results suggest that}} metals influence the SOM dynamics in that sandy soil: a C 3 "old carbon" enrichment was observed in the small or clay size fractions, while the "new" C 4 carbon associated with sandy soil particles presents a rapid turnover. Metal accumulation in the clay fraction is attributed to particulate organic matter (poorly associated) and SOM decay which overtime accumulated metals and eventually these metal-SOM associations prevent the biological decomposition of such carbon pools. Moreover, the Œ¥ 13 C signals, C/N ratios and results from <b>chemical</b> <b>extractions</b> clearly showed differences in the origin, nature and reactivity of the SOM {{as a function of the}} size fraction with consequences on the metal behaviour.

40|$|The role of Fe(III) {{minerals}} {{in controlling}} acid mine drainage (AMD) chemistry was studied using samples from two AMD sites [Gum Boot (GB) and Fridays- 2 (FR) ] located in northern Pennsylvania. <b>Chemical</b> <b>extractions,</b> X-ray diffraction (XRD), {{scanning electron microscopy}} (SEM), and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) were used to identify and characterize Fe(III) phases. The mineralogical analysis revealed schwertmannite and goethite as the principal Fe(III) phases in the sediments. Schwertmannite particles occurred as sub-micron sized spheroids. Their transformation into goethite occurred at the GB site where poorly-crystallized goethite rich in surface-bound sulfate was initially formed. In contrast, no schwertmannite transformation occurred at the FR site. The resulting goethite in GB sediments was also of spherical morphology and resulted from an in situ phase transformation involving the conversion of bulkbound schwertmannite sulfate ions into goethite surface complexes. <b>Chemical</b> <b>extractions</b> moreover showed that the poorly-crystallized goethite particles were subject to further crystallization accompanied by sulfate desorption. Changes in sulfate speciation preceded its desorption, with a conversion of bidentate- to monodentate-bound sulfate surface complexes. Laboratory sediment incubation experiments were conducted to evaluate the effect of mineral transformation on water chemistry. Incubation experiments were carried out with schwertmannite-containing sediments and aerobic AMD waters with different pH and chemical composition. The pH decreased to 1. 9 ‚Äì 2. 2 in all suspensions and the concentrations of dissolved Fe and S increased significantly. Regardless of differences in the initial water composition, pH, Fe and S were similar in suspensions of the same sediment.

The incubation experiments demonstrated that schwertmannite transformation controlled AMD water chemistry under no-flow, batch conditions...|$|R
