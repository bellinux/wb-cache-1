TELAR superstructure is a turret containing the fire control radar {{at the front}} and a launcher with four ready-to-fire missiles on top. Each TELAR is operated by a crew of four and is equipped with chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear (<b>CBRN)</b> <b>protection.</b> The radar fitted to each TELAR, {{referred to as the}} 'Fire Dome' by NATO, is a monopulse type radar and can begin tracking at the missile's maximum range (32km/20mi) and can track aircraft flying at between 15m and 22km (50 to 72,000ft) altitudes. It can guide up to three missiles against a single target. The 9K37 system supposedly has much better ECCM characteristics (i.e., is more resistant to ECM and jamming) than the 3M9 Kub system that it replaces. While the early Buk had a day radar tracking system 9Sh38 (similar to that used on Kub, Tor and Osa missile system), its current design can be fitted with a combined optical tracking system with a thermal camera and a laser range-finder for passive tracking of the target.

5000|$|The main {{differences}} between the SU-152G and the ISU-152 {{as well as its}} variants, and that between it and 2S3 made it {{what appeared to be a}} middle ground between these two self-propelled guns. The ISU-152 was intended to be a heavy assault gun from the beginning, which required capability of direct firing, and a weak transition towards firing from closed positions began. In addition, the crew of the vehicles were often poisoned by the exhaust gases after firing in closed combat compartments. Despite the overt advantage of the SU-152G over the ISU-152 in terms of firing from closed positions, serial production of the SU-152G was never put in effect. All the work on Soviet self-propelled guns were put into a halt in the 1960s and only resumed when the First secretary of the TsK KPSS was removed from position. As a result, the 2S3 [...] "Acacia" [...] was made, favorably different from its predecessor with further increased vertical traverse angles, a closed combat compartment, <b>CBRN</b> <b>protection,</b> a turret capable of circular fire and an increased angle.|$|E
5000|$|Warships with <b>CBRN</b> <b>protection</b> {{generally}} have a central citadel, {{with a degree}} of armour protection as well as a filtered air system. Safe rooms on civilian ships, sometimes called [...] "citadels", are increasingly being installed as a countermeasure against piracy. When attacked, the crew can retreat into the safe room and call for help (which in the case of ships of some countries may include the intervention of military forces). Because of the nature of ship construction, the safe room is typically constructed in a concealed location within a void within the ship, to resist efforts by the pirates to find the crew before help arrives. Safe rooms sometimes have facilities to allow the crew to remotely disable the ship's engines and electronic systems, making it impossible for the pirates to sail the ship to a location they control. The safe room is also typically armoured against direct physical attack, to allow the crew to remain safe for a few hours, even if located by the pirates, and to allow rescuing forces full scope for the use of armed force to re-take the ship without risk to the crew.|$|E

A covert CBRN protective layer can be worn under other clothing, with equipment added for full chemical protection when needed. However, it is unknown whether the covert garment offers any alleviation to thermal strain during work compared with a traditional overt ensemble. Therefore, the aim {{of this study was to}} compare thermal strain and work tolerance times during work in an overt and covert ensemble offering the same level of <b>CBRN</b> <b>protection.</b> Methods: Eleven male participants wore an overt (OVERT) or covert (COVERT) CBRN ensemble and walked (4 km·h− 1, 1 % grade) for a maximum of 120 min in either a wet bulb globe temperature [WBGT] of 21, 30, or 37 °C (Neutral, WarmWet and HotDry, respectively). The trials were ceased if the participants' gastrointestinal temperature reached 39 °C, heart rate reached 90 % of maximum, walking time reached 120 min or due to self-termination. Results: All participants completed 120 min of walking in Neutral. Work tolerance time was greater in OVERT compared with COVERT in WarmWet (P 0. 05). Conclusion: Those dressed in OVERT experienced lower thermal strain and longer work tolerance times compared with COVERT in a warm-wet environment. However, COVERT may be an optimal choice in a hot-dry environment. These findings have practical implications for those making decisions on the choice of CBRN ensemble to be used during work...|$|E
