40|$|Antennas are {{devices for}} {{transmitting}} and/or receiving signals which {{make them a}} necessary component of any wireless system. In this paper, a <b>thermal</b> <b>deposition</b> technique is utilized as a method to fabricate antenna structures on substrates. Thin-film deposition is achieved by evaporating a source material (metals in our case) in a vacuum which allows vapor particles to travel directly to the target substrate which is encased with a mask that outlines the desired structure. The material then condenses back to solid state. This method is used in comparison to screen printing, chemical etching, and ink jet printing to indicate advantages and disadvantages to the method. The antenna created undergoes various testing of frequency ranges, conductivity, {{and a series of}} flexing to indicate the effectiveness of the <b>thermal</b> <b>deposition</b> technique. A single band antenna that is operated at 2. 45 GHz intended for wearable and flexible applications was successfully fabricated through this method and tested.

40|$|We {{investigate}} a first-order phase transition from hadronic matter to antikaon condensed matter during the cooling stage of protoneutron stars. The phase transition proceeds through the <b>thermal</b> <b>nucleation</b> of antikaon condensed matter. In this connection we study {{the effect of}} shear viscosity on the <b>thermal</b> <b>nucleation</b> rate of droplets of antikaon condensed matter. Here we adopt the same equation of state for the calculation of shear viscosity and <b>thermal</b> <b>nucleation</b> time. We compute the shear viscosity of neutron star matter composed of neutrons, protons, electrons and muons using the relativistic mean field model. The prefactor in the nucleation rate which includes the shear viscosity, is enhanced by several orders of magnitude compared with the $T^ 4 $ approximation of earlier calculations. Consequently the <b>thermal</b> <b>nucleation</b> time in the $T^ 4 $ approximation overestimates our result.

40|$|Determination of the <b>controlling</b> <b>nucleation</b> and {{recrystallisation}} mechanisms from a samples microstructure {{are essential}} for understanding how the microstructure formed and evolved through time. The aim of our research was to apply a quantified analytical approach to {{the identification of the}} <b>controlling</b> <b>nucleation,</b> recrystallisation and microstructural modification mechanisms. We used electron backscatter diffraction to quantify the microstructures of naturally deformed quartz-rich rocks which were deformed at various temperature and pressure conditions. Our results show that ratios of the recrystallised grain size to the subgrain size with values less than 1 (0. 5 – 0. 7 in the data presented here) suggest bulge nucleation, whereas ratios of ∼ 1 suggest subgrain rotation nucleation. Other supporting evidence for subgrain rotation nucleation is an increase in misorientation from the centre of an original protolith ‘parent’ grain to the edge. All samples show evidence for modification of the microstructure due to grain boundary sliding including increased misorientation angles between grains and movement of recrystallised grains between parent grains. By systematically analysing sample microstructures it is possible to separate out evidence to determine the <b>controlling</b> <b>nucleation</b> and recrystallisation mechanisms, as well as being able to identify microstructure modification mechanisms.

The main {{objective of this}} work {{was to investigate the}} impact on the primary drying stage of an ultrasound <b>controlled</b> ice <b>nucleation</b> technology, compared with usual freezing protocols. Lyophilization cycles involving different freezing protocols (applying a constant shelf cooling rate of 1 °C/min or 0. 2 °C/min, putting vials on a precooled shelf, and <b>controlling</b> <b>nucleation</b> by ultrasounds or by addition of a nucleating agent) were performed in a prototype freeze-dryer. Three protective media including sucrose or maltodextrin and differing by their thermal properties and their ability to preserve a model protein (catalase) were used. The visual aspect of the lyophilized cake, residual water content, and enzymatic activity recovery of catalase were assessed after each lyophilization cycle and after 1 month of storage of the lyophilized product at 4 °C and 25 °C. The freezing protocols allowing increasing nucleation temperature (precooled shelf and <b>controlled</b> <b>nucleation</b> by using ultrasounds or a nucleating agent) induced a faster sublimation step and higher sublimation rate homogeneity. Whatever the composition of the protective medium, applying the ultrasound technology made it possible to decrease the sublimation time by 14 %, compared with the freezing method involving a constant shelf cooling rate of 1 °C/min. Concerning the enzyme activity recovery, the impact of the freezing protocol was observed only for the protective medium involving maltodextrin, a less effective protective agent than sucrose. Higher activity recovery results were obtained after storage when the ultrasound technology or the precooled shelf method was applied. <b>Controlling</b> ice <b>nucleation</b> during the freezing step of the lyophilization process improved the homogeneity of the sublimation rates, which will, in turn, reduce the intervial heterogeneity.

The mixing of protein and precipitant was controlled by changing the flow rate in a plug-based microfluidic system.

Mixing at low flow velocities in a winding channel induces nucleation more effectively than mixing in straight channels. A qualitative scaling argument that relies on a number of assumptions is presented to understand the experimental results.

The success of this therapy is strongly dependent on the precision and control of <b>thermal</b> <b>deposition.</b> Hyperthermia based on induction heating, with thermally self-regulating thermoseeds inserted into the tumorous mass, is used for interstitial treatment. The technique was the subject of the numerical study presented in the paper. The analysis was carried out using coupled electromagnetic heating and thermo-fluid dynamic FEM simulations. During <b>thermal</b> <b>deposition</b> by induction heating of inserted seeds, the simulations estimated the thermal field inside and outside the tumour, as well as the sensitivity of the thermal field to variations regarding seed temperature, configuration and proximity to vessels.
