50|$|The {{protagonist of}} Goemon's Great Adventure is Goemon, a ninja with blue, bushy hair who wields a kiseru. Goemon can jump higher than his friends, throw money, {{and use a}} <b>chain</b> <b>pipe.</b> Goemon's friends Ebisumaru, Yae, and Sasuke feature {{once again in the}} game. Ebisumaru is a fat man with a blue bandana and a love of food. Idolizing James Dean as the {{ultimate}} ninja, he can attack enemies with a decorative paddle, a magic megaphone that causes his shouts to turn to stone, and stomach gas. Yae is a green-haired female ninja, or kunoichi, wielding a Katana. She has the ability to morph into a mermaid in order to swim underwater and use a bazooka. Finally, Sasuke is a fast mechanical ninja who has upgradable projectile attacks such as shuriken and bombs. The villains of Goemon's Great Adventure are Bismaru and Dochuki. Bismaru, a cross-dressing nun (who first appeared in Ganbare Goemon 3), steals Wise Man's resurrection machine to revive Dochuki, an ancient prince of the underworld. While Bismaru fights with his giant robot, Dochuki confronts the party in person.|$|E

50|$|Beating a boss {{can trigger}} a cut scene, after which Goemon appears outside the dungeon or helms his giant robot friend Impact to thwart an enemy robot (although not {{mentioned}} in the manual, these segments of gameplay support the Rumble Pak accessory). These sequences begin with a music video and a high-speed minigame in which Impact must smash structures and avoid hazards while racing across the countryside. The points gained by destroying buildings determine how many health points (measured in oil) Impact will have in the coming battle. Players control Impact from a cockpit behind his eyes where gauges show enemy and player health and ammunition. Impact can punch, kick, defend, reel in opponents with the <b>chain</b> <b>pipe,</b> and use projectile weaponry, including nasal bullets and a laser. Once a boss is defeated, a cut scene of the enemy exploding shows, and the game returns to normal exploration-based play. At the very end is the last boss whose defeat unlocks the ending. Collecting all the fortune cats and beating the game enables an Impact tournament mode with a special image of the robots as the prize for winning.|$|E

40|$|International audienceMultimedia {{services}} and other critical multisite services (e. g., VPN) are becoming mainstream, and they require a guaranteed {{quality of service}} (QoS). Services need to be established across several autonomous systems (ASes), often to connect end-users. Thus, provisioning and control of end-to-end QoS requirements arise {{as one of the}} main challenges in inter-AS management. The contractual approach, consisting in using service-level agreements (SLAs) defined by each crossed AS, allows to negotiate contract chains that satisfy end-to-end requirements. However, establishing such chains by on-demand negotiations does not scale up for large numbers of requests. Hence, we propose a negotiation process to occur before users' requests to establish service are received. The proposed negotiation process results in the selection of aggregated contract <b>chains,</b> called <b>pipes,</b> and a distribution between them. Such a distribution would indicate, for each <b>chain</b> of a <b>pipe,</b> the connection flow it may accept. In this paper, we address the pipe negotiation problem as a network flow problem.

(Jingjing Zou) The pres_debates 2012 data set contained three errors in speech attribution. This has been corrected and the turn of talk (tot) as well. word_stats would throw an error if no poly-syllable words existed. This has been corrected (reported by Nicolas Turenne). NEW FEATURES qdap_df and %&% added to mimic some of the functionality of dplyr's tbl_df and <b>chaining</b> <b>pipe</b> in a more specific, less flexible, qdap oriented way.

A vignette: Cleaning Text & Debugging was added to assist users with cleaning and debugging problems in qdap. pronoun_type, and subject_pronoun_type, object_pronoun_type added to examine usage of subject/object pronouns by grouping variable.

The processing can be viewed as stepwise application of rules, which express assumptions about measurements (constraint programing). Measurements are understood to be primitives with describing features in Geometry, Topology and Photometry as junction points, lines, regions, but single symbols like letters or numerals etc. too. A causes-hierarchy (which contains a part-of concept as a subset) is applied to model complex objects. After every aggregation of primitives to objects of higher semantics, we arrive at a new set of primitives for further analysis. As an example, a simple class hierarchy for a pipe network plan is shown in fig. 1, whereas fig. 2 shows an appropriate part of a network plan to be recognized.
