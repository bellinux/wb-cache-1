50|$|A major {{breakthrough}} was {{achieved in the}} 1950s {{with the discovery of}} well-tolerated oral diuretics, the first of which was <b>chlorothiazide</b> (Diuril). This was derived from the antibiotic sulfanilamide and became available in 1958. A randomized controlled trial sponsored by the Veterans Administration comparing hydrochlorothiazide plus reserpine plus hydralazine versus placebo had to be stopped early because those not receiving treatment developed many more complications and it was deemed unethical to withhold treatment from them. The study continued in people with lower blood pressures and showed that treatment even in people with mild hypertension more than halved the risk of cardiovascular death. In 1975, the Lasker Special Public Health Award was awarded to the team that developed <b>chlorothiazide.</b> The results of these studies prompted public health campaigns to increase public awareness of hypertension and promoted the measurement and treatment of high blood pressure.

These loop diuretics may be combined with thiazide diuretics such as oral metolazone or intravenous <b>chlorothiazide</b> for a synergistic effect. Intravenous preparations are physiologically preferred because of more predictable absorption due to intestinal edema, however, oral preparations can be significantly more cost effective.|$|E
50|$|Diuretics, {{sometimes}} {{known as}} ‘water pills’, are drugs which draw excess fluid from the tissues {{of the body}} and convert it into urine. They are used for the swelling and bloating of premenstrual syndrome, for treating high blood pressure and, in older people, for heart failure caused by weakening of the heart’s pumping mechanism. Diuretics are used to pass drug test because they increase the amount of urine produced by the body. By increasing the amount of urine, it dilutes any drugs in the urine, which makes it harder to identify drugs. Examples of diuretics and masking agents are: bumetanide, <b>chlorothiazide,</b> furosemide, hydrochlorothiazide, probenecid, spironolactone (canrenone), triameterene, and trichlormethiazide.|$|E

40|$|<b>Chlorothiazide</b> (CTZ), {{unlike other}} thiazide diuretics, can form salts. An {{injectable}} formulation containing the sodium salt is available; however neither the physicochemical {{characteristics of the}} salt nor its solid state form have been previously reported. This work reports on the crystal structure of <b>chlorothiazide</b> sodium. The structure was investigated by single crystal X-ray and nuclear magnetic spectroscopy (NMR) analyses and compared to <b>chlorothiazide,</b> while the solid state characteristics were assessed by thermal analysis, powder X-ray diffraction, infrared spectroscopy, dynamic moisture sorption and solubility analysis. The crystal structure of <b>chlorothiazide</b> sodium {{was determined to be}} triclinic; the crystal space group type was P- 1. <b>Chlorothiazide</b> sodium presented a self-assembly polymeric-type suprastucture, where the unit cell comprised two <b>chlorothiazide</b> molecules bonded together with sodium cations through the water bridges.

40|$|The acute {{effects of}} {{intravenous}} (i. v.) probenecid and <b>chlorothiazide</b> on renal urate handling were investigated in paired studies in normal men.

Assuming that PZA selectively inhibits the tubular secretion of urate and that uricosuric agents act by increasing the excretion of filtered urate, then the uricosuric responses (the increment in urate excretion or clearance) should have been unaffected by PZA. Defined in this manner, however, uricosuric responses to probenecid and <b>chlorothiazide</b> were significantly decreased after PZA pretreatment. In order to determine whether PZA diminished other renal actions of <b>chlorothiazide,</b> changes in sodium and inorganic phosphorus excretion were examined. <b>Chlorothiazide</b> produced equivalent natriuretic and phosphaturic responses after PZA pretreatment, indicating that PZA does not interfere with {{at least some of}} the renal actions of <b>chlorothiazide.</b> In separate studies, PZA depressed urate excretion by at least 68 % during the maintenance of chlorothiazide-induced natriuresis and phosphaturia, suggesting that <b>chlorothiazide</b> does not diminish the anti-secretory action of PZA...|$|E
40|$|The {{administration}} of <b>chlorothiazide</b> both to man and to rats results in hyperglycemia following a glucose load.

These effects of <b>chlorothiazide</b> are most likely due to both a direct action of the drug on tissue glucose metabolism and an indirect effect {{which is the result}} of <b>chlorothiazide</b> causing a decrease in the level of serum insulin-like activity which in turn diminishes the activity of insulin-dependent enzymes involved in glucose metabolism...|$|E
40|$|The {{saluretic}} {{effect of}} the thiazide diuretics {{has been attributed to}} inhibition of sodium reabsorption in the distal nephron of the kidney. Recent micropuncture studies have shown, however, that <b>chlorothiazide</b> administration can also inhibit sodium reabsorption in the proximal convolution. To clarify the site of the saluretic effect of <b>chlorothiazide,</b> these micropuncture studies examined the effect of <b>chlorothiazide</b> on chloride transport in the nephron. The effect of <b>chlorothiazide</b> on chloride transport was studied because chlorothiazide's effectiveness as a saluretic is largely due to its ability to enhance sodium chloride excretion; if only changes in sodium transport are examined, it would be then difficult to determine if sodium as bicarbonate or as chloride is affected, since <b>chlorothiazide</b> can inhibit carbonic anhydrase. One group of rats was studied before and after 15 mg/kg per h <b>chlorothiazide.</b> For comparison, another group of rats was studied before and after 2 mg/kg per h benzolamide, a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor. Fractional chloride delivery from the proximal tubule was similarly increased in both groups from 59. 4 to 71. 0 % by <b>chlorothiazide</b> administration, Pless than 0. 0001, and from 54. 3 to 68. 2 % by benzolamide administration, P less than 0. 001. The increased delivery very of chloride from the proximal tubule was largely reabsorbed before the early distal tubule as fractional chloride delivery to this site increased only from 5. 08 to 7. 40 % after <b>chlorothiazide</b> administration, P less than 0. 001, and from 4. 50 to 6. 29 % after benzolamide administration, P less than 0. 01. Benzolamide had no effect on chloride reabsorption in the distal convoluted tubule. However, <b>chlorothiazide</b> administration resulted in a marked decrease in distal tubular chloride reabsorption, the fraction of filtered chloride present at the late distal tubule incresing from 1. 24 to 6. 25 %, P less than 0. 001. Fractional chloride excretion in the urine increased from 0. 29 to 3. 44 %, P less than 0. 001, after <b>chlorothiazide,</b> but did not change after benzolamide. The influence of <b>chlorothiazide</b> on proximal chloride transport presumably is related to its ability to inhibit renal carbonic anhydrase.

40|$|Cellular {{mechanisms}} of <b>chlorothiazide</b> and cellular potassium depletion on Mg 2 + uptake in mouse distal convoluted tubule cells. The {{use of the}} distally-acting diuretic, <b>chlorothiazide,</b> {{has been reported to}} have important effects on renal magnesium handling. The cellular {{mechanisms of}} <b>chlorothiazide</b> action on Mg 2 + uptake was investigated in immortalized mouse distal convoluted tubule (MDCT) cells. Intracellular free Mg 2 + concentration was determined by microfluorescence. Mg 2 + transport was measured as a function of change in intracellular Mg 2 + concentration with time following placement of Mg 2 +-depleted cells into a buffer containing 1. 5 mM magnesium. The uptake rate of Mg 2 + into Mg 2 +-depleted cells was 179 ± 28 nM/second. Mg 2 + uptake was dependent on the membrane voltage as membrane hyperpolarization enhanced uptake whereas depolarization diminished transport. <b>Chlorothiazide</b> increased Mg 2 + uptake by 58 %, from 179 ± 28 to 283 ± 23 nM/second. The ability of <b>chlorothiazide</b> to stimulate Mg 2 + uptake in MDCT cells was concentration-dependent and related to the diuretic-induced hyperpolarization of the plasma membrane. These studies support the notion that acute <b>chlorothiazide</b> administration enhances renal magnesium conservation through its effects on Mg 2 + transport within the distal convoluted tubule. Since chronic <b>chlorothiazide</b> administration may result in hypokalemia as well as hypomagnesemia, Mg 2 + uptake was determined in potassium-depleted MDCT cells. Mg 2 + uptake was diminished, 80 ± 24 nM/second, in potassium depleted cells. Hyperpolarization of the plasma membrane with the cell permanent anion, SCN−, corrected Mg 2 + uptake in potassium depleted cells suggesting that the basis for diminished uptake may, in part, be due to depolarization of the membrane voltage. In summary, acute <b>chlorothiazide</b> stimulates Mg 2 + transport in MDCT cells. We postulate that chronic <b>chlorothiazide</b> use may lead to hypokalemia that in turn diminishes Mg 2 + transport in the distal tubule resulting in urinary magnesium-wasting...|$|E

40|$|A close {{relationship}} has been observed between the clearance rates of sodium and calcium {{under a variety of}} diuretic conditions. The thiazide diuretics act differently in dissociating the renal tubular reabsorption of sodium and calcium. This phenomenon has been further investigated using recollection micropuncture and clearance techniques in a group of 14 dogs subjected to three consecutive experimental phases: expansion to 3 % of body weight (BWt) with Ringer's solution, <b>chlorothiazide</b> infusion at 20 mg/kg/h, and furosemide in a prime of 10 mg/kg/ and a 10 mg/kg/h infusion. Diuretic losses were balanced with infusion of equal volumes of Ringer's solution throughout the experiment. <b>Chlorothiazide</b> increased the fractional excretion (FE) of sodium almost threefold while FECa was not significantly altered. Furosemide increased FENa and FECa to an approximately equal, and more marked, degree. This dissociation of sodium and calcium reabsorption after <b>chlorothiazide</b> was also evident in the superficial distal tubule, where (tubule fluid/plasma sodium) (TF/PNa) increased from 0. 32 to 0. 49 (P < 0. 01) and TF/(ultrafiltrate) UFCa was unchanged (0. 35 - 0. 31). Furosemide markedly reduced the transtubular concentration gradient for both sodium (0. 86) and calcium (0. 94). TF/PInul in decreased progressively from 3. 79 to 2. 78 to 2. 33 in three phases. In the late proximal tubule, <b>chlorothiazide</b> induced a fall of TF/PInul in from 1. 57 to 1. 44 (P < 0. 01), but the ratio TF/UFCa: TF/PNa was unchanged.

An approximate rigid-body crystal energy landscape using these five conformations produced a diverse range of low energy crystal structures, with the anhydrous structure among the most stable.

40|$|Angiotensin II {{was used}} as a probe to study the effect of changes in perfusate flow rate on the renal {{clearance}} parameters of <b>chlorothiazide</b> in the isolated perfused rat kidney. Perfusion studies were performed in five rats with no angiotensin II present in the perfusate and in five rats with a 1 – 4 ng/min infusion of angiotensin II into the perfusate. Angiotensin II had a dramatic effect on the renal hemodynamics, resulting in a 43 % decrease in perfusate flow, a 16 % decrease in glomerular filtration rate (GFR), and a 45 % increase in filtration fraction. Values for the fractional excretion of glucose were low and consistent, with or without angiotensin II. Although the unbound fraction (fu) of <b>chlorothiazide</b> was unchanged between treatments, the renal (CL r) and the secretion clearances were reduced by about 50 % in the presence of angiotensin II; the excretion ratio [ER=CL r /(fu·GFR) ] was reduced by 38 % with angiotensin II present in the perfusate. Analysis of the data was complicated by the presence of a capacity-limited transport for renal tubular secretion. Transport parameters (±SD) were obtained and the corrected intrinsic secretory clearance [(V max /GFR) /K m] of <b>chlorothiazide</b> was 123 ± 18 without angiotensin II vs. 72. 8 ± 30. 0 with angiotensin II.
