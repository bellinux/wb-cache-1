40|$|This paper summarises the {{findings}} of a questionnaire study investigating the language pro-files and practices of cross-border workers in Luxembourg. The study was undertaken in 2009 and includes 128 cross-border workers from 35 workplaces from different sectors, including the health sector, higher education and research, the manufacturing industry and the service sector. The study suggests that all the participants have a multilingual profile and have learnt at least one language in addition to their first one {{in the course of their}} life. A second result is that French is used in all the workplaces under investigation. But, at the same time, the major-ity of the <b>cross-border</b> <b>worker</b> participants have a multilingual professional life, most of them using more than one language at work on an everyday basis. This multilingualism comes in the form of a wide range of multilingual practices, including language accommodation, use of a lingua franca, code-switching and receptive multilingualism. Furthermore, two thirds of the participants report having learnt Luxembourgish either formally or informally, and half of those who have not learnt it, would like to do so in the future...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{explores the}} temporary migration of Mexican women who reside in Mexican border cities and travel daily to American border cities to labor in domestic service. Based on in-depth interviews and participant observation with domestic workers, employers, {{and community members}} in the paired border cities of Laredo, Texas and Nuevo Laredo, Mexico, I study this frequent movement across international borders to analyze how this movement creates and reinforces inequalities of class, gender, and nationality in these borderlands. This study explores three distinct but interrelated themes regarding Mexican women’s migration. First, I examine the pre-emigration context that drives Mexican women to temporarily migrate as undocumented domestic laborers to border cities in the United States. I do so by analyzing {{the social and economic}} conditions in Mexico that have motivated working-class women to seek employment outside their country. Second, I analyze the recurrent movement of women crossing international borders, whose legal entry into U. S. border cities is complicated by their undocumented employment in domestic service. This pseudo-legal migration creates a space wherein different areas represent “safe” and “risky” zones for the <b>cross-border</b> <b>worker.</b> Finally, I examine the (re) production of difference by domestic workers and employers. I explore how borders and boundaries in the lives of cross-border workers span the political and geographic divide that they cross daily and permeate the dynamics between workers and employers. I deploy the concept of symbolic boundaries to analyze the production of difference and how difference is negotiated in the relations between Mexican domestic workers and Mexican American employers. This study makes a contribution to the discipline of sociology by examining the temporary migration of workers which has been largely absent in the scholarship of migration. The movement of these women contributes {{to an understanding of the}} social inequalities embedded their migration and their labor as workers. It also brings attention to the inequalities of social class, gender, and nationality among co-ethnic women, who are typically essentialized in the literature and depicted as a homogeneous group...|$|E

40|$|Due to the {{weakening}} of state borders within the European Union and the favorable economic situation of Luxembourg, {{there has been a}} steep rise in migration across Luxembourg’s borders. Of special prominence are <b>cross-border</b> <b>workers,</b> who live in the surrounding border regions of France, Belgium and Germany and now make up 44 percent of the workforce. This increasing presence of ‘foreigners’ is prompting substantial change to Luxembourg’s traditionally triglossic language situation, where Luxembourgish, French and German have coexisted in public use. In this situation, competing language ideologies are likely to emerge, reflecting the interests of different groups. Horner and Weber (2008) discuss the presence of two opposing language ideologies among the autochthonous population: the trilingual language ideology (trilingualism as the ‘language’ of Luxembourg); and the nationalist language ideology (Luxembourgish as the only true language of Luxembourg), which latter they claim has increased in reaction to the rise in <b>cross-border</b> <b>workers.</b> Little research has been done on the language ideologies of <b>cross-border</b> <b>workers</b> themselves, however. Encountering Luxembourg’s multilingualism, <b>cross-border</b> <b>workers</b> may adopt one of the ideologies above, or one of two further competing ideologies: that of societal multilingualism as a problem or as an opportunity.

40|$|Over {{one million}} new {{immigrants}} {{arrive in the}} United States each year. This spring, Americans saw several times that number pour into the streets, protesting proposed changes in U. S. immigration and guest work policies. As the signs they carried indicated, most migrants come to work, {{and it is in}} the workplace that the impact of large numbers of newcomers is most keenly felt. For those who see both the free movement of people and the preservation of decent working conditions as essential to social justice, this presents a seemingly unresolvable dilemma. In a situation of massive inequality among countries, to prevent people from moving in search of work is to curtail their chance to build a decent life for themselves and their families. But from the perspective of workers in the country that receives them, the more immigrants, the more competition, and the worse work becomes. As an advocate for immigrant workers for over twenty years, I have often spoken from the heart of that dilemma. This Article proposes a way out. In it, I develop the idea of 2 ̆ 2 transnational labor citizenship, 2 ̆ 2 a new approach to structuring cross-border labor migration that draws on, but goes beyond, current theories of transnational political citizenship. Transnational labor citizenship reconceptualizes the relationship among the governments of immigrant sending and receiving countries, civil society labor institutions, such as unions and worker centers, and private actors. Inspired by recent efforts to organize workers as they move across borders, transnational labor citizenship would link permission to enter the United States in search of work to membership in <b>cross-border</b> <b>worker</b> organizations, rather than to the current requirement of a job offer from an employer. This Article offers the new concept of 2 ̆ 2 labor citizenship 2 ̆ 2 as a lens for understanding the challenges unions face in taking the leap to an open attitude toward the future flow of migrants. By labor citizenship I mean the ways in which workers 2 ̆ 7 organizations create membership regimes, set and enforce rules for those who belong, and approach their goal of improving wages and working conditions. I begin in Part II by elaborating the concept of labor citizenship, drawing on the nation-state citizenship framework and emphasizing the key pragmatic and normative roles of borders in union organizing. In Part III, I trace the interactions between labor citizenship and its nation-state counterpart, arguing that in the context of large-scale immigration, the boundaried nature of labor citizenship is frequently its undoing, creating a recurring conflict between solidarity and defense. In Part IV, I lay out the dilemma of guest work as the last frontier in this progression. I draw on the history of both the bracero and more recent temporary work visa programs in the United States to argue that even a 2 ̆ 2 good guest work program 2 ̆ 2 would not address the challenges of establishing labor citizenship in a transnational world because guest work proposals inevitably preserve barriers between 2 ̆ 2 guests 2 ̆ 2 and residents that undermine efforts to raise or even maintain wages and working conditions. In Part V, I lay out my proposal for transnational labor citizenship, and in Part VI, I explore practical and theoretical hurdles and suggest how they might be overcome...|$|E

40|$|In {{the wake}} of the EU's Eastern {{enlargement}} the high disparity in wages is likely to result in a considerable influx of foreign workers.

If, by way of transition periods (similar to those used in the EU Southern enlargement), the freedom of movement can be postponed until the year 2015, the number of migrants and <b>cross-border</b> <b>workers</b> will be reduced by one fourth, owing to the economic catching-up process of the Eastern countries.

40|$|This article {{deals with}} the {{reconfiguration}} of collective action by workers {{who live and work}} in different adjoining nations in Europe, i. e. <b>cross-border</b> <b>workers.</b> Such workers take advantage of open borders, but still rely on systems of social insurance and taxation that are not quite the same in every country. The article's central argument is that the associations representing Western European <b>cross-border</b> <b>workers</b> - in this case study in France, Germany, Belgium, Luxembourg and Switzerland - are increasingly defending them by recourse to law, especially Community law, rather than by the militancy practised by 'traditional' trade unions that largely organize at the national scale. The article aims at understanding how 'expertise' in EC law governing transnational workers is gained and how recourse to law is developed. Cross-border leaders focus on specialized legal activities and on lobbying the authorities of the European Community; this is their specific answer {{to the fact that the}} trade unions do not really defend <b>cross-border</b> <b>workers</b> and that initiating action at nation-state level is a complicated business. Finally, the article explains how a Europeanization of defence practices, which is rather original in nature and was initially 'located' in border areas, is being implemented and how it contributes to the ongoing debate on the multi-scalar strategies of trade unions and social movements.

30|$|According to Table  4, {{the direct}} {{budgetary}} costs of short-time work in Luxembourg rose from € 16 per hour lost in 2009 to € 18.2 in 2013. This {{implies that the}} average cost of one job saved increased from approximately € 2900 per month in 2009 to € 5500 in 2013. From a government perspective, the direct benefit of STW consists of lower payments of unemployment benefits to those who would have lost their job otherwise. As discussed earlier, the situation of Luxembourg is specific because about half of the labour force are <b>cross-border</b> <b>workers.</b> If they lose their employment in Luxembourg, their unemployment benefits are paid by their respective country of residence. At the same time, during the Great Recession <b>cross-border</b> <b>workers</b> were more severely affected by job losses. This impedes us from precisely calculating the budgetary costs of paying unemployment benefits to people having been laid off in the absence of STW availability. As an approximation and an upper bound, we assume that one half of the employees that would have lost their job in the absence of STWA would have received unemployment benefits in Luxembourg (i.e. we consider the share of <b>cross-border</b> <b>workers</b> in the private sector employment in Luxembourg and assume that resident and <b>cross-border</b> <b>workers</b> have the same likelihood of being involved in STW and losing their job in its absence). Focusing on the peak period of STW use in 2009, this would imply approximately additional 870 unemployed and annual budgetary cost of € 27.6 million. Hence, from a pure Luxembourg perspective, the rough approximation of benefits of the STW programme lie below its direct costs. If we include in the approximation the budgetary costs of the <b>cross-border</b> <b>workers</b> saved through STW in Luxembourg, we would arrive at a figure that is closer but still below the direct costs of the STW programme. The benefit of STW in terms or lower budget costs related to otherwise higher unemployment only applies as long as the people remain unemployed. A more sophisticated cost–benefit analysis would {{have to take into account}} not only the average duration of unemployment spells but also consider social costs of unemployment such as the deterioration of human capital during unemployment, long-term unemployment etc.|$|R

The study presents an extensive historical background and takes up an empirical investigation of this little-known corner of France, in a survey of language use amongst 120 <b>cross-border</b> <b>workers,</b> conducted in 1998. The consequences of mobility in this case are that the respondents do not find themselves in a stable diglossic situation, but rather in a situation of linguistic flux.

40|$|International audienceThe {{significant}} increase in number of <b>cross-border</b> <b>workers</b> in the Greater Region mainly to Luxembourg generates many flows predominantly made by car. For {{more than half of}} them travel time exceeds one hour and a half to go back in a day just to get to work. Such routes represent a large cross-border working catchment area that is relatively hard to define, where the complex living spaces sometimes spread over the four countries of the Greater Region. This complexity shows cultural attachment phenomena, but also spatial logics connected to urban structure that exists on both sides of border regarding transportation infrastructures and urban amenities offer. In that context, do <b>cross-border</b> <b>workers</b> perform their daily activities in connection with home (in France, Belgium or Germany) or with workplaces (in Luxembourg) ? Are the chains of activities, which compose the cross-border workers' activity spaces, reflecting a cross-border integration?. This paper aims to tackle this problem, on one hand, by using new procedures of geovisualization interested in the construction of cartographic and geo-statistical indicators for cross-border integration and, on the other hand, by proposing socio-demographic profiles for <b>cross-border</b> <b>workers.</b> The measures of action spaces have already been the subject of empirical researches, but chains trip haven't been mobilized to our knowledge in part of a geo-statistical measure of cross-border integration. 2.

A spatial analysis associated with a cartographic visualization enables to carry out centrographic analysis of activities places. These indicators related to individual living spaces are used for constructing a cross-border integration synthetic indicator.

40|$|Since almost 150 years, Luxembourg {{depends on}} {{two kinds of}} migration, {{qualified}} and non-qualified, {{in order to deal}} with the workforce needs of its economy. Compared to the other EU Member States, Luxembourg is the country with the largest proportion of foreigners; however, this foreign population is mainly composed of EU citizens. Due to its size and geographic position, Luxembourg was able to have access to a very particular form of economic migration: <b>cross-border</b> <b>workers.</b> Globalisation has also played a decisive role in the development of economic migration for the Luxembourgish labour market. The financial centre was obliged to become highly specialised in order to remain competitive in regards to other financial centres and to maintain its volume of business. In order to maintain its competitive advantage, Luxembourg needs highly skilled personnel, which the country has found, up until now, within the Greater Region. This reality is even more pronounced with regards to the labour market: the number of actives (salaried and non-salaried) on 31 March 2014 shows that Luxembourgish nationals represented only 31 %, EU citizens 65 % and third-country nationals only 4 %. <b>Cross-border</b> <b>workers</b> from Belgium, France and Germany represented 42 % of the workforce and the resident migrant population (EU citizens and third-country nationals) 28 %. <b>Cross-border</b> <b>workers,</b> which consist of skilled and highly skilled labour are substantially attracted for two reasons: 1) more competitive salaries on the Luxemburgish labour market; and 2) a geographical location which allows the commuting of <b>cross-border</b> <b>workers.</b> The attitude of the successive governments was to adapt immigration to the economic needs of the country. The government policy intends to focus on attracting highly added value activities focussed on new technologies (biomedicine and information as well as communication technologies – focusing on IT security), logistics and research. However, being one of the smallest countries in the European Union, Luxembourg has limited human resources to guarantee the growth not only of the financial sector but also of the new technologies sectors. The government introduced the highly qualified worker residence permit in the bill on free movement of persons and immigration approved by law of 29 August 2008 almost a year before of the enactment of the Blue Card Directive to facilitate the entry of third-country national highly qualified workers. However, this reform was isolated and incomplete and took place without making a real evaluation of the workforce demand of the different sectors of the economy. Even though until now Luxembourg has been relying on the workforce from the Greater Region, for some socio-economic and political stakeholders, highly qualified workforces began to become scarce in the Greater region. In addition to the <b>cross-border</b> <b>workers,</b> the lifting of restrictions to access all the sectors of the labour market for citizens of the new Member States (EU- 8) can be considered as a mitigating factor for the need to make an evaluation of the workforce demand, because the high salaries paid in Luxembourg became a real pull factor for the highly qualified workers. As a consequence, the political authorities did not foresee a systematic plan on how to address labour shortages in specific sectors of the economy, because there has not been a significant need for doing so...|$|R

40|$|Despite {{its small}} size (2586 km 2), the Grand-duchy of Luxembourg {{is a strong}} {{economic}} locomotive. Indeed, among the 380 000 available jobs in the country, 44 % are occupied by <b>cross-border</b> <b>workers</b> from France, Belgium and Germany. While the commuting behavior and the activity chains of the <b>cross-border</b> <b>workers</b> have been largely studied (Carpentier, 2012, Drevon et al., 2013, Gerber, 2012) {{this is not the}} case for the population living in Luxembourg. This scientific contribution aims at analyzing the daily activity chains of resident population. Do residents perform all their activities in Luxembourg? If not, in which country do they go and for which type of activity? Due to the small size of the country and plausible attraction for surrounding countries (linked to familial reasons, nationality, past residential place of residence, differentials in prices etc.) the people living in Luxembourg might conduct some activities in Belgium, France or Germany. Between June and July 2015, a multi-day survey has been implemented on 52 staff members of the University of Luxembourg working, at that time, at Walferdange campus. These individuals provided information regarding their daily activities (activity duration and location, activity type) and their travel behavior (travelling time and mode) for two weeks. Among the respondents, 35 participants are living in Luxembourg and provided information for 490 days and 1850 activities in total. The studied population is interesting in many aspects. First of all, the individuals were working in Walferdange, a city located 8 km north of Luxembourg-city, so a central geographic position. Second, this is a high-qualified and international population. Actually, the education level of the respondents is high (45 % have a PhD degree, 37 % a master degree) and many of them moved to Luxembourg because of the attractive labour market. Third, the income of the surveyed population is higher than the average national salary. With its limited area, one would think that individuals living in Luxembourg would cross the borders quite often for shopping, leisure activities [...] . However, Luxembourg has abundant and various services (shopping malls, leisure and cultural places [...] .). Indeed close to 30 % of the respondents had all their activities in Luxembourg and out of the 1850 total activities, only 130 had been done in a neighboring country. But on the other hand, one fourth of the respondents had done 75 % of total activities outside Luxembourg. In a way to better understand the mobility behavior of resident population, a detailed activity chain analysis will be presented. This will be completed by a spatial analysis of the activities, in order to examine the effects of the borders on non-work related activities. Finally, different activity behaviors will be identified through a multivariate analysis. The results of this explorative analysis will be compared to the abundant literature regarding the behavior of the <b>cross-borders</b> <b>workers...</b>|$|R

These new forms of (net) working, facilitated by the digitalization of the labour market, pose new challenges to worker mobility law in the European Union and the cross-border application of labour law. For example, in case employees are (fully or partly) tele-working at home, from different countries, for a business situated in an EU member state, or in different countries, the question is whether European free movement law applies and how this relates to principles of applicable (labour) law. The question is not only if they are workers in the understanding of labour law, but also whether they are <b>cross-border</b> <b>workers</b> in the context of free movement of workers/services principles...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} role of {{language}} in determining the degree of substitutability between foreign and native workers. To this end, we focus on Switzerland, an immigration-receiving country with four official languages spoken, three of which in common with bordering countries. We modify the model proposed by Ottaviano and Peri (2012) {{to account for the}} linguistic background of native and immigrant workers. We find that language plays a central role in determining the elasticity of substitution between foreign and native workers and accounts for much of their imperfect substitutability. These findings are robust to a number of robustness checks, such as different specifications of the model structure and the inclusion of <b>cross-border</b> <b>workers.</b> Then, we compute the total wage change for native and foreign workers caused by new immigration in flows. In the long run, the average percentage wage changes for native and foreign workers are quite small and not significant...|$|R
40|$|In French border regions, the {{unemployment}} durations of communes increase with {{distance from the}} border to a threshold of about thirty kilometres, then slightly decrease after this threshold. Depending on the definition of exit from unemployment, differences in unemployment durations between border communes and those located around thirty kilometres from the border are one to eight months, while controlling for the labour force composition. In order to explain this "border effect", we first use a spatial autoregressive model estimated by maximum likelihood. Then we calculate residual durations of unemployment using a linear model estimated by ordinary least squares. The advantage of living near the border is mainly due to certain effects of social composition, especially the proportion of <b>cross-border</b> <b>workers,</b> who {{improve the quality of}} informational and relational networks. This scenario applies to communes close to Belgium, Luxembourg, Switzerland and Spain, but it seems less effectual near the borders with Germany and Italy...|$|R
40|$|Between 1999 and 2004 Switzerland fully {{opened its}} border region (BR) to <b>cross-border</b> <b>workers</b> (CBW), who are foreign {{residents}} commuting to Switzerland for work. In this paper, we exploit {{the timing of}} implementation {{and the fact that}} CBW commute almost exclusively to municipalities close to the border to estimate the effect of this policy on foreign labor supply and on native labor market outcomes, using a difference-in-difference approach. We find that opening the border to CBW increased their employment within 10 minutes of commuting time from the border by 4 to 5 percentage points. The increased inflow was mainly constituted of highly-educated workers and it was associated with an increase of wages of highly-educated Swiss workers and no significant changes of wages of other workers. We also find weak evidence that employment and hours worked by less educated native workers increased. Native highly-educated workers became more likely to fill top managerial positions after the liberalization and they became more likely to stay in border regions. Occupation upgrading and complementarity with highly-educated natives, particularly strong in highskilled manufacturing and knowledge-intensive services, contribute to explaining these effects of CBW on natives...|$|R

Unemployment has remained low compared to other European countries. These significant social changes have been absorbed without substantially widening income disparities, facilitated by the generous welfare system made affordable by the strong economy. However, this favourable overall picture masks weaknesses in the design of labour market institutions and social transfers that reduce incentives to work for resident workers. Despite the strong economy, this has resulted in lower employment rates for certain groups of residents, notably those who are second–earners, younger or older, or from poorer socioeconomic backgrounds. Furthermore, the incentives provided by existing labour market institutions could make adjustment to changed economic prospects more difficult. The functioning and adaptability of the labour market could be improved without undermining social cohesion through a range of related measures. This could include aligning minimum wag...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we deal with}} {{cross-border}} flows of people within the Euroregion Galicia-North of Portugal, paying particular attention to those led by workers. Based on data for daily mobility between the places of residence and work (commuters), it can be defined, within this territory, the so-called Polycentric Urban Regions (PUR) of Vigo and Porto. These regions should constitute significant referents of cross-border mobility, whose importance we begin to realize by estimating the movement of passengers across border crossings linking the south of Galicia and the north of Portugal.  In this context, given the non-existence of official statistics, the reports prepared by the Eures Galicia/Região Norte office provide relevant information about the flow of <b>cross-border</b> <b>workers</b> in the area, which we have complemented by conducting two surveys directed, respectively, to involved workers and companies, and data from a recent study on labour mobility in the Euroregion. The evidence demonstrates the quantitative importance achieved in the territory analyzed by this interesting phenomenon of cross-border work and allows a description of its characteristics that shows the difficulties faced {{by the process of}} construction of a European labor market...|$|R
40|$|The {{relationship}} between the labor market and international trade is a broad and complex subject {{that has been the}} focus of significant attention in recent years. Discussion and analysis in this area has covered a number of discrete issues, including the effect of shifting trade patterns on employment levels and earnings in domestic markets, the impact of wage levels and labor legislation on the location of production facilities, and the positive and negative aspects of the <b>cross-border</b> movement of <b>workers,</b> among others. The continuing importance of labor issues within the larger trade debate is highlighted by the inclusion of measures relating to labor standards and/or the <b>cross-border</b> movement of <b>workers</b> in recent bilateral and multilateral trade agreements such as the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS), and the U. S. –Oman Free Trade Agreement. This paper aims to provide background for future work on trade-related labor issues by describing how labor issues such as internationally recognized labor standards and the <b>cross-border</b> movement of <b>workers</b> have been addressed by international organizations, as well as in U. S. trade legislation and recent trade agreements...|$|R
