40|$|Theorists of {{narrative}} claim {{that time and}} space are parts {{of narrative}} fabric, affecting our basic understanding of a text {{and the way in}} which we build mental images of what we read. Yet most definitions foreground time at the expense of space. Because of this, narrative space remains a relatively unexplored territory. This analysis focuses on three narrative concepts: space, spatial schemata – <b>container</b> – and <b>description.</b> Theoretical approaches are based on works of such narrative theorists as British Teresa Bridgeman, Americans Marie Laurie Ryan and Ruth Ronen. The main ideas which this article holds on are such: container is an essential concept to our understanding of inside and outside of narrative (a whole narrative may be constructed on whether protagonists are inside or outside it); description in narrative is much more than just a decoration – it may have an impact on the meaning, interpretation, and perception of the text. In this paper, using Aleksandra Fomina’s novel “Mes vakar buvom saloje” (2011) as a case study, it is explored what space and containers mean in this narrative, how do they affect the reader and his perception of depicted narrative world. Here it is presumed that a closer look to the space, <b>containers</b> and its <b>description</b> of the novel “Mes vakar buvom saloje” may reveal different interpretation of the novel. Postcolonialism based on propositions of American narrative theorist Patrick Williams is also invoked in the analysis. Postcolonial approach to this narrative provides opportunities to relate themes developed in the novel (the reality of post- Soviet country, emigration, problematical identity of a colonized subject, questions of historical memory) with wider cultural context. Analysis focuses on such narrative space and containers as: islands – the island of Nemunas, Great Britain, Soviet Union as an island; house identified as “Karaliaus Mindaugo Proto Bokštas” (“The tower of mind of King Mindaugas”); Kaunas; London; squatts etc. In order to investigate what these containers mean, it is important to take notice to whom it belongs to, when, where and how it is depicted and who can enter it as well. Just for the wider perspective, article also discusses quite a different spatial form of narrative – spatial extension of the text – which refers to the spatiality of the text as a material object and to the readers interface with it...|$|R

We study the time average of local correlation functions and show that both the quench action approach and the GGE formalism are applicable for the long time average of local correlation functions. We find that the time average of the system corresponds to an eigenstate of the Lieb-Liniger Hamiltonian and that this eigenstate is related to an eigenstate of a Lieb-Liniger Hamiltonian with periodic boundary conditions on an interval of twice the length and with twice as many particles (a doubled system). We further show that local operators with support {{far away from the}} boundaries of the hard wall have the same expectation values with respect to this eigenstate as corresponding operators for the doubled system.

The goal of this thesis is to reduce transshipment times by using model predictive scheduling, combined with a switching max-plus linear system <b>description.</b> <b>Container</b> terminals generally utilize cranes to load and unload ships, specialized equipment to store containers in large stacks, and vehicles to transport containers between cranes and stacks. An unloading cycle generally consists of three distinct steps, which are the unloading by a quay crane, the transport from the crane to the stack, and finally the stacking. The dynamics of this transportation {{system as a whole}} can be influenced by choosing the vehicle which is assigned to each of the container jobs, and by choosing the order in which vehicles and stacking cranes handle their containers. The dynamics of this system are mainly determined by {{the time it takes to}} perform each of these steps, and by synchronizations between the steps. This makes it possible to describe this system with a switching max-plus linear (SMPL) model. This thesis will show how one can describe the container transport system as an SMPL system. Furthermore, this thesis will show how the goal of minimizing transshipment times can be reached with the use of model predictive scheduling (MPS). It will be shown that the MPS problem for this SMPL system can be rewritten as a mixed integer linear programming problem, for which various efficient solvers exist.
