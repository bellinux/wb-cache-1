5000|$|The {{declination}} symbol , (lower case [...] "delta", abbreviated dec) {{measures the}} angular distance {{of an object}} perpendicular to the celestial equator, positive to the north, negative to the south. For example, the north celestial pole has a declination of +90°. The origin for <b>declination</b> is the <b>celestial</b> equator, which is the projection of the Earth's equator onto the <b>celestial</b> sphere. <b>Declination</b> is analogous to terrestrial latitude.|$|R
40|$|Continual {{refinement}} of models and estimation methods {{is an integral}} part of improving VLBI measurements of Earth orientation and position along with advances in instrumentation and observing strategy. The modeling of the troposphere continues to be challenging with recent improvements in treating the mean gradient and gradient variations affecting the terrestrial reference frame scale and <b>celestial</b> <b>declinations</b> near the current limits of accuracy. Revised models of nutation and solid Earth tides are implemented in CALC 9. 0 to conform to the latest IERS Conventions along with other changes to facilitate use by VLBI correlators. Using data since 1995 the celestial reference frame has been extended and improved consistent with the definition and 0. 25 mas accuracy limit of the ICRF. The current definition of the VLBI terrestrial reference frame places a floor on the accuracy of station velocities at the 0. 4 mm/yr level. The establishment of the IVS (International VLBI Service for Geodesy and Astrometry) in the past year will provide a forum for further improvements of VLBI data analysis...|$|R
50|$|Chapters {{seven to}} {{seventeen}} {{of the text}} deals essentially with subjects of astronomy, viz.

50|$|The Perseus Family {{includes}} several constellations {{associated with the}} Perseus myth: Cassiopeia, Cepheus, Andromeda, Perseus, Pegasus, and Cetus (representing the monster sent to devour Andromeda). Menzel also included a few neighboring constellations: Auriga, Lacerta, and Triangulum. Except for Cetus, these constellations all lie north of the ecliptic.

50|$|Using a {{nautical}} almanac, the <b>declination</b> (<b>celestial</b> latitude), and the Greenwich {{hour angle}} (celestial longitude) are obtained {{of the observed}} object for the time of observation. The assumed longitude is now added or subtracted to the Greenwich Hour Angle of the object to obtain the local hour angle, that is the difference in longitude between the DR position and the geographical position of the object.|$|R
50|$|Norton’s Star Atlas became highly {{popular because}} of its {{convenient}} arrangement of dividing the sky into six vertical slices, or gores, like portions of a globe. Each gore covered 4 hours of right ascension, from declination 60 degrees north to 60 degrees south, drawn on a projection specially designed by Norton. The north and south polar regions of the sky were covered by separate charts on a standard azimuthal equidistant projection, extending from the <b>celestial</b> poles to <b>declination</b> 50 degrees north and south.|$|R

The sample covers the <b>celestial</b> region with <b>declination</b> δ> 0 and galactic latitude |b_II| > 20 and comprises sources with a count rate > 0. 06 counts s^- 1 and a source extent likelihood of 7. In an optical follow-up identification program we find 378 (76) of these sources to be clusters of galaxies. [...] ...|$|R
5000|$|As {{seen from}} {{locations}} in the Earth's Northern Hemisphere, <b>celestial</b> objects with <b>declinations</b> greater than 90° − [...] (where [...] = observer's latitude) appear to circle daily around the celestial pole without dipping below the horizon, and are therefore called circumpolar stars. This similarly occurs in the Southern Hemisphere for objects with declinations less (i.e. more negative) than −90° + [...] (where [...] is always a negative number for southern latitudes). An extreme example is the pole star which has a declination near to +90°, so is circumpolar as seen {{from anywhere in the}} Northern Hemisphere except very close to the equator.|$|R
50|$|In astronomy, {{the hour}} circle of a {{celestial}} object {{is the great}} circle through the object and the celestial poles. It is perpendicular to the <b>celestial</b> equator. The <b>declination</b> of an object as observed on the celestial sphere is the angle measured along the hour circle of that object to the celestial equator. In other words, it is analogous to meridians or longitudes on a globe. A meridian on the celestial sphere matches an hour circle at any time. So called because the angle between the planes of the hour circles (or the difference in longitudes) of two objects is sometimes measured in hours (or hours, minutes, and seconds), one revolution (360°) being equivalent to 24 hours, or 1 hour being equivalent to 15°.|$|R
500|$|Each star's {{approximate}} {{position on}} the celestial sphere is given using the equatorial coordinate system. [...] The celestial sphere is an imaginary globe of infinite size with the Earth at its center. [...] Positions on the celestial sphere are often expressed using two coordinates: declination and sidereal hour angle, which are similar to latitude and longitude {{on the surface of}} the Earth. [...] To define declination, the Earth's equator is projected out to the celestial sphere to construct the <b>celestial</b> equator, and <b>declination</b> is measured in degrees north or south of this celestial equator. [...] Sidereal hour angle is a measurement between 0 and 360 degrees, indicating how far west a body is from an arbitrarily chosen point on the celestial sphere called the First Point of Aries.|$|R
500|$|Epsilon Eridani {{has a high}} proper motion, moving −0.976arcseconds {{per year}} in right {{ascension}} (the celestial equivalent of longitude) and 0.018arcseconds per year in <b>declination</b> (<b>celestial</b> latitude), for a combined total of 0.962 arcseconds per year. The star has a radial velocity of [...] (away from the Sun). The space velocity components of Epsilon Eridani in the galactic co-ordinate system are [...] = , which means that it is travelling within the Milky Way at a mean galactocentric distance of 28.7kly (8.79kiloparsecs) from the core along an orbit that has an eccentricity of 0.09. The velocity and heading of Epsilon Eridani indicate {{that it may be}} a member of the Ursa Major Moving Group, whose members share a common motion through space. This behaviour suggests that the moving group originated in an open cluster that has since diffused. The estimated age of this group is [...] years, which lies within the range of the age estimates for Epsilon Eridani.|$|R

50|$|Longitude by {{chronometer}} is a method, in navigation, {{of determining}} longitude using a marine chronometer, which {{was developed by}} John Harrison {{during the first half}} of the eighteenth century. It is an astronomical method of calculating the longitude at which a position line, drawn from a sight by sextant of any celestial body, crosses the observer's assumed latitude. In order to calculate the position line, the time of the sight must be known so that the celestial position i.e. the Greenwich Hour Angle (Celestial Longitude - measured in a westerly direction from Greenwich) and <b>Declination</b> (<b>Celestial</b> Latitude - measured north or south of the equational or celestial equator), of the observed celestial body is known. All that can be derived from a single sight is a single position line, which can be achieved at any time during daylight, when both the sea horizon and the sun are visible. To achieve a fix, more than one celestial body and the sea horizon must be visible. This is usually only possible at dawn and dusk.|$|R
