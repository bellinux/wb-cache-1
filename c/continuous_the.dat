The anthem is also played on New Year's Eve after the New Year Address by the President.

According to the law, when the anthem is played officially, everybody must stand up (in case the national flag is raising, facing to the flag), men must remove their headgear (in practice, excluding those in military uniform and clergymen). Uniformed personnel must give a military salute when the anthem plays.|$|E

25|$|Thomas Hunt Morgan {{began his}} career in {{genetics}} as a saltationist, and started out trying to demonstrate that mutations could produce new species in fruit flies. However, the experimental work at his lab with the common fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, which helped establish the link between Mendelian genetics and the chromosomal theory of inheritance, demonstrated that rather than creating new species in a single step, mutations increased the genetic variation in the population. By 1912, after years of work on the genetics of fruit flies, Thomas Hunt Morgan showed that these insects had many small Mendelian factors (discovered as mutant flies) on which Darwinian evolution could work as if variation was fully <b>continuous.</b> <b>The</b> way was open for geneticists to conclude that Mendelism supported Darwinism.|$|E
25|$|Continuous phase {{transitions}}, such as order-disorder {{transitions in}} metallic alloys and ferromagnetic-paramagnetic transitions, involve {{a transition from}} an ordered to a disordered state. In terms of correlation functions, the equal-time correlation function is non-zero for all lattice points below the critical temperature, and is non-negligible for only a fairly small radius above the critical temperature. As the phase transition is <b>continuous,</b> <b>the</b> length over which the microscopic variables are correlated, , must transition continuously from being infinite to finite when the material is heated through its critical temperature. This {{gives rise to a}} power-law dependence of the correlation function as a function of distance at the critical point.

25|$|The 206L LongRanger is a {{stretched}} variant with {{seating for}} seven. The fuselage, stretched {{a total of}} , adds two rear-facing seats between {{the front and rear}} seats. Since 1975, Bell has produced more than 1,700 LongRangers across all variant types. In 1981, a military version was released, the 206L TexasRanger. The original 206L used an Allison 250-C20B engine, and a series of model upgrades replaced this engine with more powerful versions; the 206L-1 used a 250-C28, and the 206L-3 and 206L-4 used the 250-C30P. In both applications, the 250-C30P is derated from 650hp for takeoff and 501hp <b>continuous.</b> <b>The</b> 206L-3 is transmission–limited to 435hp for take-off, and the 206L-4 is transmission-limited to 495hp. The derating of the C30P produces an advantage in hot-day and high-altitude operations as it can produce the rated horsepower at higher altitudes and temperatures where applications that use the maximum rating of the engine at sea level suffer accelerated performance deterioration with increases in temperature and altitude. The 206L-3 and L-4 have not been offered in a twin configuration under those model designations.|$|E

500|$|Crystal Dynamics {{focused on}} believability rather than realism to re-develop the character, posing {{decisions}} around the question, [...] "What could Lara do?", and giving her action more freedom. The designers updated Lara Croft's move set {{to make her}} movements appear more fluid and <b>continuous.</b> <b>The</b> animations were also updated so the character could better interact with environmental objects. The developers introduced a feature that causes the character's skin and clothing to appear wet after swimming and dirty after rolling on the ground. Responding to criticism directed at the character controls in Angel of Darkness, Crystal Dynamics redesigned the character's control scheme to provide what it felt was the best third-person action experience. The developers also introduced close-quarter melee manoeuvres. Crystal Dynamics updated the character model to add more realism, but retained past design elements. The polygon count increased to over 9,800. More {{attention was paid to}} the character's lip synching and facial expressions to allow for dynamic emotional responses to in-game events. In redesigning the character's appearance, Crystal Dynamics updated Croft's hairstyle, wardrobe, and accessories. Her shirt was changed to a V-neck crop top, her body was given more muscle tone, and her hair braid was switched to a pony tail. The voice actor for Lara Croft was initially rumoured to be Rachel Weisz, but the role was eventually given to Keeley Hawes. Crystal Dynamics retained the design changes for the next game, Tomb Raider: Anniversary, a remake of the first game. The designers aimed to portray Croft with more emotional depth, and focused on the character's desire to achieve the end goal of the game, culminating in killing one of the antagonists. The developers used the death to evoke guilt in Croft afterward and illustrate that shooting a person should be a difficult choice.|$|E
