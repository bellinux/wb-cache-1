5|$|Between the 16th and 19th centuries, the Malay Archipelago was {{gradually}} {{taken over by}} the European <b>colonial</b> <b>powers,</b> beginning {{with the arrival of the}} Portuguese at Malacca in 1509. The early dominance of the Portuguese was challenged during the 17th century by the Dutch, who came to control most of the ports in the region. The Dutch established a monopoly over trade within the archipelago, particularly in spices, then the region's most important product. Other <b>colonial</b> <b>powers,</b> including the British, were limited to a relatively minor presence.|$|E
5|$|After Tiku's death, the <b>colonial</b> <b>powers</b> {{hoped that}} he would be forgotten, a hope which was not realised; Tandibua' rebelled in 1917, and other local rebellions arose in {{different}} areas of Sulawesi until the Dutch withdrawal following the Japanese occupation. During the occupation, the Japanese forces used Tiku as a symbol of Torajan struggle against colonial aggression, working to unite the people against Europeans. However, this was poorly received in conquered areas such as Baruppu' and Sesean, where Tiku was remembered as a man who killed others to steal their wives.|$|E
5|$|All {{this changed}} with the Libyan coup d'état of 1 September 1969 that deposed Idris and brought Muammar Gaddafi to power. Gaddafi claimed the Aouzou Strip in {{northern}} Chad, referring to an unratified treaty signed in 1935 by Italy and France (then the <b>colonial</b> <b>powers</b> of Libya and Chad, respectively). Such claims had been previously made when in 1954 Idris had tried to occupy Aouzou, but his troops were repelled by the French Colonial Forces.|$|E

5|$|Early {{development}} of the women's game at the time <b>colonial</b> <b>powers</b> brought football to Sierra Leone and the continent was limited, as <b>colonial</b> <b>powers</b> in the region tended to take concepts of patriarchy and women's participation in sport with them to local cultures that already had similar concepts already embedded in them. Other factors on the continent impact the {{development of}} the game, including limited access to education, poverty among women in the wider society, and fundamental inequality present in the society that occasionally allows for female specific human rights abuses. When quality players are developed in Africa, they often leave for greater opportunities elsewhere Continent wide; most of the funding for women's football in a country and for the women's national team comes from FIFA, not the national football association. Future success for women's football in Africa is dependent on improved facilities and access by women to these facilities. Attempting to commercialise the game is not the solution, as demonstrated by the existence of many youth and women's football camps held on the continent that have resulted in improved national team performance as players progressed through the system.|$|E
5|$|Archaeological, {{linguistic}} and anecdotal {{evidence suggests that}} Taiwan's indigenous peoples have undergone a series of cultural shifts to meet the pressures of contact with other societies and new technologies. Beginning in the early 17th century, Taiwanese aborigines faced broad cultural change as the island became incorporated into the wider global economy by a succession of competing colonial regimes from Europe and Asia;. In some cases groups of aborigines resisted colonial influence, but other groups and individuals readily aligned with the <b>colonial</b> <b>powers.</b> This alignment could be leveraged to achieve personal or collective economic gain, collective power over neighboring villages or freedom from unfavorable societal customs and taboos involving marriage, age-grade and child birth.|$|E
5|$|In 1962 he {{investigated}} the mysterious death of Enrico Mattei, the powerful president of Italy's state-owned {{oil and gas}} conglomerate ENI who died in suspicious circumstances {{in a plane crash}} on October 27, 1962. During his controversial tenure of ENI, Mattei had made many enemies. He tried to break the oligopoly of the 'Seven Sisters' (a term Mattei coined to refer to the dominant oil companies of the mid-20th century), and brokered an oil import deal with the Soviet Union {{in the middle of the}} Cold War over intense protests from NATO and the U.S. in 1959, while supporting independence movements against <b>colonial</b> <b>powers</b> such as Algeria.|$|E

5|$|International {{attitudes to}} the {{federation}} were critical, {{particularly from the}} Afro-Asian bloc in the United Nations. At {{a time when most}} <b>colonial</b> <b>powers</b> were rushing their colonies towards independence, the federation seemed to its opponents to be an unwelcome obstacle. In Britain, Labour grew more critical, and African nationalists in the federation itself became more vocal, dissatisfied with the liberalisation that was taking place, and demanding faster moves towards African advancement. The Governor of Northern Rhodesia, Sir Arthur Benson, wrote a secret letter to his superiors in Britain, highly critical of Welensky and the federation; this letter remained undiscovered until 1958, when Huggins revealed it to Welensky.|$|E
5|$|More new lands were {{opening up}} to European <b>colonial</b> <b>powers,</b> the botanical riches being {{returned}} to European botanists for description. This was a romantic era of botanical explorers, intrepid plant hunters and gardener-botanists. Significant botanical collections came from: the West Indies (Hans Sloane (1660–1753)); China (James Cunningham); the spice islands of the East Indies (Moluccas, George Rumphius (1627–1702)); China and Mozambique (João de Loureiro (1717–1791)); West Africa (Michel Adanson (1727–1806)) who devised his own classification scheme and forwarded a crude theory of the mutability of species; Canada, Hebrides, Iceland, New Zealand by Captain James Cook's chief botanist Joseph Banks (1743–1820).|$|E
5|$|The British {{transferred}} rule of Demerara to the Dutch in 1802 {{under the}} terms of the Peace of Amiens, but took back control of it a year later. In 1812, the British merged Demerara and Essequibo into the colony of Demerara-Essequibo. The colonies were ceded to Britain by treaty between the Netherlands and Britain on 13 August 1814. Stabroek, as the colony's capital was known under the Dutch, was renamed as Georgetown in 1812. The <b>colonial</b> <b>powers</b> appointed a governor to rule in their stead, and the local legislation was decided on by a Court of Policy.|$|E

5|$|Colonial {{rule in the}} Congo {{began in}} the late 19th century. King Leopold II of Belgium, {{frustrated}} by Belgium's lack of international power and prestige, attempted to persuade the Belgian government to support colonial expansion around the then-largely unexplored Congo Basin. The Belgian government's ambivalence about the idea led Leopold to eventually create the colony on his own account. With support from a number of Western countries, who viewed Leopold as a useful buffer between rival <b>colonial</b> <b>powers,</b> Leopold achieved international recognition for a personal colony, the Congo Free State, in 1885. By the turn of the century, however, the violence of Free State officials against indigenous Congolese and the ruthless system of economic extraction had led to intense diplomatic pressure on Belgium to take official control of the country, which it did in 1908, creating the Belgian Congo.|$|E

5|$|In {{the past}} few decades, {{the legacy of the}} League of Nations started to be {{reviewed}} by historians as the League Archives at Geneva were better explored, and the United Nations faced similar troubles to those of the interwar period. The current consensus state that, even though the League failed to achieve its ultimate goal of world peace, it did manage to build new roads towards expanding the rule of law across the globe; strengthened the concept of collective security, giving a voice to smaller nations; helped to raise awareness to problems like epidemics, slavery, child labor, colonial tyranny, refugee crisis and general working conditions through its numerous commissions and committees; and paved the way for new forms of statehood, as the mandate system put the <b>colonial</b> <b>powers</b> under international observation.|$|E

5|$|La Rose and La Marguerite are rival {{societies}} that commemorate the Anglo-French {{heritage of the}} island; the factions represent the warring <b>colonial</b> <b>powers,</b> between whose hands Saint Lucia changed fourteen times. La Rose is held on August 30 while La Margurite is held on October 17. The societies {{date back to the}} early 19th century, when each village was home to competing organizations of the Roman Catholic Church. Both societies draw on English royalty traditions and have a number of positions, including the King, Queen, Prince, Princess and various lower titles like the Chief of Police and nurse. La Rose and La Marguerite meet once weekly except during Lent. At these meetings, which are on Saturday for La Rose and Sunday for La Marguerite, members sing or play instruments and dance. La Marguerite meetings feature the membership in a seat chorus with a leader, the chantwèl, standing, while La Rose meetings include instruments like the tanbouwen (tambourine), baha (wooden trumpet), chakchak (rattles), guitar and gwaj (scraper).|$|E
5|$|The {{onset of}} the First World War in Europe {{eventually}} showed how far German–Japanese relations had truly deteriorated. On 7 August 1914, only two days after Britain declared war on the German Empire, the Japanese government received an official request from the British government for assistance in destroying the German raiders of the Kaiserliche Marine in and around Chinese waters. Japan, eager to reduce the presence of European <b>colonial</b> <b>powers</b> in South-East Asia, especially on China's coast, sent Germany an ultimatum on 14 August 1914, which was left unanswered. Japan then formally declared war on the German Empire on 23 August 1914 thereby entering the First World War as an ally of Britain, France and the Russian Empire to seize the German-held Caroline, Marshall, and Mariana Islands in the Pacific.|$|E
5|$|The {{status of}} a British outpost in Singapore seemed {{initially}} in doubt as the Dutch government soon protested to Britain for violating the Netherlands' sphere of influence. But as Singapore rapidly emerged as an important trading post, Britain consolidated its claim on the island. The Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1824 cemented the status of Singapore as a British possession, carving up the Malay archipelago between the two <b>colonial</b> <b>powers</b> with the area north of the Straits of Malacca, including Singapore, falling under Britain's sphere of influence. In 1826, Singapore was grouped by the British East India Company together with Penang and Malacca to form the Straits Settlements, administered by the British East India Company. In 1830, the Straits Settlements became a residency, or subdivision, of the Presidency of Bengal in British India.|$|E

5|$|World War I {{broke out}} in July 1914. By September 1914, the war had spread to Africa as the British and Belgians began a long {{military}} campaign against the German colonial army in German East Africa. In Nyasaland, the major effect {{of the war was}} massive recruitment of Africans to serve as porters in support of the Allied armies. Porters lived in extremely poor conditions which left them exposed to disease and mortality rates among them during the campaigns were high. At the same time, the recruitment of porters created a shortage of labour which increased the economic pressures on Africans in Nyasaland. Millenarians at the time believed that World War I would be a form of Armageddon, which they believed would destroy the <b>colonial</b> <b>powers</b> and pave the way for the emergence of independent African states.|$|E
