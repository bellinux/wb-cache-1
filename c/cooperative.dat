40|$|<b>Cooperatives</b> are {{especially}} important in current agri-food markets.

5|$|The <b>cooperative</b> {{gameplay}} {{originated from}} players' requests and from anecdotes of players {{working together on}} the same computer or console to solve the game's puzzles. Wolpaw likened this to players working together on the same computer to solve point-and-click adventure games. The <b>cooperative</b> campaign was also inspired by Valve's Left 4 Dead <b>cooperative</b> games, in which players enjoyed discussing their personal experiences with the game when they had finished playing it. While the single player campaign in Portal 2 is designed to avoid frustrating the player, the <b>cooperative</b> levels focus on coordination and communication, and Valve recognizes {{they are much more}} difficult than the single-player puzzles. Valve did not include timed puzzles in the single-player campaigns in Portal and Portal 2, but found that their inclusion in the <b>cooperative</b> mode is effective and gives players a positive feeling after they successfully plan and execute difficult maneuvers. Each puzzle chamber in the <b>cooperative</b> mode requires four portals to solve to prevent puzzles being solved by the actions of only one player. As soon as a playtester discovered a way to complete a puzzle with one set of portals, the level was sent back to the designers for further work. Except in a few cases, Valve designed the chambers so that both players would remain in sight of each other to promote communication and cooperation. Some of the puzzle chambers were designed asymmetrically; one player would manipulate portals and controls to allow the other player to cross the room, emphasizing that the two characters, while working together, are separate entities. The designers soon realized that the ability to tag surfaces with instructional icons for one's partner was a necessary element, since they found this to be more effective for cooperation than simple, verbal instructions.|$|E

Based on the Farrell’s concept of efficiency, this paper selected inputs and output factors for agricultural <b>cooperatives</b> by using fuzzy Delphi method (FDM), there are four input factors among them, namely the number of employment, assets, operating expenses and management costs, but there are two output factors, namely the number of members and operating income. Furthermore, this paper used data envelopment analysis to establish efficiency boundary function and obtained the operating efficiency of agricultural <b>cooperatives.</b> In terms of all of the agricultural <b>cooperatives,</b> there are total 14 agricultural <b>cooperatives</b> in the 104 DMU, and their values of operating efficiency are both one. In addition, business entities and models of various types of agricultural <b>cooperatives</b> are not the same, so this study fit vegetables and fruit and livestock farming <b>cooperatives,</b> which was proposed by Golany and Roll in 1989. In the terms of efficiency of vegetables and fruits of agricultural <b>cooperatives,</b> the operating efficiency values of ten ones are one, however, the livestock operators with the operating efficiency who have twelve. Finally, the use of AHP further distinguished the efficient operation of agricultural <b>cooperatives</b> in order to select the best business model.
