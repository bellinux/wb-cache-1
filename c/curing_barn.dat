2500|$|Tobacco is {{cultivated}} annually, and can {{be harvested}} in several ways. In the oldest method still used today, the entire plant is harvested at once by cutting off the stalk at {{the ground with a}} tobacco knife. It is then speared onto sticks, four to six plants a stick and hung in a <b>curing</b> <b>barn.</b> In the 19th century, bright tobacco began to be harvested by pulling individual leaves off the stalk as they ripened. The leaves ripen from the ground upwards, so a field of tobacco harvested in this manner involves the serial harvest of a number of [...] "primings", beginning with the volado leaves near the ground, working to the seco leaves {{in the middle of the}} plant, and finishing with the potent ligero leaves at the top. Before this, the crop must be topped when the pink flowers develop. Topping always refers to the removal of the tobacco flower before the leaves are systematically removed, and eventually, entirely harvested. As the industrial revolution took hold, harvesting wagons used to transport leaves were equipped with man-powered stringers, an apparatus that used twine to attach leaves to a pole. In modern times, large fields are harvested mechanically, although topping the flower and in some cases the plucking of immature leaves is still done by hand. Most tobacco in the U.S. is grown in North Carolina, Kentucky, and Virginia.|$|E

50|$|The {{curing process}} was crucial, and flue curing {{was the most}} modern, {{scientific}} method available in the 1930s. The kiln at 12 Chisholm Trail used this new technology, closely resembling drawings of a model flue <b>curing</b> <b>barn</b> in the Queensland Agricultural Journal of August 1931. The flues carried heat at ground level from the outside furnace, across the barn {{and back to the}} chimney outlets, raising the temperature inside the kiln and thereby curing the tobacco.

50|$|Several factors {{contributed to}} the failure of the Townsville tobacco industry. It was {{generally}} considered that the Experimental Farm at Mareeba contributed greatly {{to the success of the}} industry in that area. Although the Townsville and District Development Association agitated for a government Experimental Farm in this area to provide support for local inexperienced growers, this never eventuated. Water was always a problem as tobacco growers relied on the northern wet season. Failure of the season had drastic consequences, as did a heavy season. The tobacco plant was particularly prone to diseases and pests. Inexperienced farmers lacked the expertise to deal with these diseases, as well as cope with the complicated curing process. Government fiscal policy did not always favour the local grower: increased excise on home-grown tobacco and reduced duties on imports were blamed for the unsatisfactory position of the industry in 1934. This variety of causes often meant farmers could not sell a large enough portion of their crop at prices high enough to cover their capital outlay. Capital required to establish a tobacco farm was estimated at around £950, a considerable sum in the 1930s. This included the cultivation of 15 acres, deposit on land, a small hut, clearing, <b>curing</b> <b>barns,</b> bulk shed, horses, farm equipment and some labour costs.|$|R
50|$|One of {{the major}} costs was the {{construction}} of a <b>curing</b> <b>barn,</b> or barns, {{depending on the size of}} the farm. Local tobacco kilns were essential as it was imperative that tobacco leaf be cured immediately after harvesting, and a number of kilns appeared in the Hervey's Range and Woodstock areas. Kiln walls had to be insulated and farmers used different materials, according to their means and the availability of local resources. Different constructions in the Townsville area included brick, two layers of corrugated iron filled with sand, bush timber coated with cement plaster, home-made concrete brick, reinforced concrete, and sun-dried bricks of clay and chopped grass.|$|E

50|$|The {{object of}} curing was to obtain leaf {{with a bright}} yellow colour {{similar to that of}} a fresh ripe lemon. After cutting, several tobacco leaves were strung together, tied to a stick at regular spaces, and then hung on tier poles in the <b>curing</b> <b>barn.</b> The leaf was then cured in an {{extremely}} complicated process involving three distinct stages: yellowing the leaf, fixing the colour and killing the leaf, and completely drying the leaf. The first stage needed a warm humid atmosphere to complete the ripening process; the second increased the heat and lowered the humidity through controlled ventilation until leaf veins were substantially dry; and the third further increased heat and decreased ventilation until the entire leaf and stem was completely dried. This process necessitated specialized knowledge to control heat, humidity and ventilation, and could differ slightly depending on the type and condition of the crop. This challenged inexperienced farmers entering the tobacco industry.|$|E

5000|$|The tobacco {{plants are}} {{manually}} kept suckerless and pruned to exactly 12 leaves through their early growth. In late June, when {{the leaves are}} a dark, rich green and the plants are 24-30 inches (600 to 750 mm) tall, the whole plant is harvested in the late evening and hung to dry in a sideless <b>curing</b> <b>barn.</b> Once the leaves have partially dried but are still supple (usually less than 2 weeks in the barn), any remaining dirt is removed and the leaves are moistened with water and stemmed by hand.

The tobacco is kept under pressure using oak blocks and massive screw jacks, forcing nearly all {{the air out of}} the still-moist leaves. Approximately once a month the pressure is released, and each of the torquettes is worked by hand to permit a little air back into the tobacco. After a year of this treatment, the perique is ready for consumption, although it may be kept fresh under pressure for many years. Extended exposure to air degrades the particular character of perique. The finished tobacco is dark brown - nearly black - very moist with a fruity, slightly vinegary aroma. [...] The fruity aroma is the result of hundreds of volatile compounds created by anaerobic fermentation of the tobacco.

40|$|This paper {{reports on}} {{the third year of}} a series of studies {{involving}} burley production practices and <b>barn</b> and chamber <b>curing</b> methods on the formation of tobacco specific nitrosamines (TSNAs). The TSNA formation in various tobaccos continues as a topic of importance to the tobacco industry. The significant formation of TSNAs in burley tobacco occurs after the yellowing phase of curing and is dependent on several factors, notably the fertility level during growth and the curing environment and moisture during the later stages of curing and post-curing conditions.

40|$|In 2012, 7. 5 {{million tonnes}} of tobacco leaf were grown {{in more than}} 120 countries. Two-thirds (64. 8 %) of this {{production}} was produced by three countries, China (42. 3 %), Brazil (11. 4 %), and India (11. 1 %). Like smoking prevalence, tobacco production has shifted from high-income to low and middle-income countries. Between and 1961 and 2006, global production of tobacco leaf rose from 57 % to 90 % in low and middle-income countries in Sub-Saharan Africa, Latin America and Asia. For many farmers, particularly, but not exclusively, in low and middle-income countries, tobacco is considered {{an important source of}} income. A number of observers, however, have described how industry control of tobacco growing and the leaf trade has resulted in cycles of indebtedness, particularly among farmers contracted directly by leading cigarette manufacturers. Further, short-term, unreliable income is often offset by damage caused by tobacco cultivation to the local environment, costs of fertilisers and pesticides, dangerous working conditions and illness experienced by farm workers, food insecurity and child labour (see Section 10. 15). For governments, tobacco growing provides income through trade and taxation, {{at least in the short}} term. From the tobacco industry’s perspective, production costs in low and middle-income countries are lower, and markets are often less regulated. Since the late 1970 s, concerns have been raised regarding the environmental impacts of tobacco growing. Tobacco leaf cultivation is labour-intensive, requires significant pest and disease control, use of fertilisers, and extensive water supply. While some tobacco leaf is air, or sun-dried, the majority of cultivated leaf, particularly in low and middle-income countries is flue- <b>cured</b> in <b>barns</b> using heat produced by burning wood, coal or gas. Manufacturing cigarettes from tobacco crops generates a further range of hazardous chemical by-products, including ammonia, nicotine hydrochloric acid and toluene. In high-income countries, appropriate disposal of these chemicals is strictly regulated; the same may not be true in developing countries where tobacco manufacturing is increasingly concentrated. In response to growing concerns around the environmental impacts of leaf growing, leading tobacco companies have taken steps to address these issues, generally as part of broader corporate social responsibility (CSR) agendas. Analysis of industry initiatives, however, demonstrates that they have been aimed at deflecting attention from environmental impacts of tobacco cultivation issues, and at influencing public and policy-maker attitudes toward tobacco companies. 6 page(s...|$|R
