2500|$|Land Rover 127s {{were built}} on a special {{production}} line, and all started life as 110 4x4 chassis (the model was initially marketed as the 110 <b>crew</b> <b>cab,</b> before the more logical 127 name was adopted). These were then cut in two and the [...] of extra chassis length welded on before the two original halves were reunited. These models did not receive their own dedicated badging like the other two models, instead they used the same metal grille badges as used on the Series III 109 V8 models, that simply said [...] "Land-Rover".|$|E

The VZ Utes remained on sale well after the introduction of Holden's next-generation VE series, as did the VZ Wagons. By December of the same year, the Crewman and all AWD variants of the ute were gone from showrooms after Holden ceased production, and the One Tonner range was discontinued. VZ Utes were superseded by the VE series equivalent released in September 2007.

2500|$|During {{a safety}} car {{situation}} on Lap 160 of the 2012 Daytona 500, Earnhardt Ganassi Racing driver Juan Pablo Montoya's car had a suspension part failure, and it lost control on turn 3, sharply veering {{right into a}} safety truck and jet dryer trailer, causing a massive diesel/jet fuel fire. As it was seen on video, sparks were seen emanating from Montoya's car right before its hard collision with the jet dryer trailer and left driver's side of the truck. Montoya was treated at the infield care center and released. Montoya's report over the radio after the incident was [...] "I left the pits and felt a really weird vibration and I came back in and checked the rear end {{and said it was}} okay and I got into the backstraight and we were are going fourth gear but wasn't going that fast. Every time I got on the gas I could feel the rear squeezing. When I was telling the spotter to have a look how the rear was moving the car just turned right." [...] The driver of the Chevrolet Silverado <b>Crew</b> <b>Cab,</b> Duane Barnes, was taken to a local hospital for observation and was resting comfortably. He was an employee at Michigan International Speedway, a sister track of Daytona. The tracks often share jet dryer equipment on race weekends to help in case of rain such as the case on Sunday, the original scheduled start time of the race. The entire incident took about two hours to clean up before the last 40 (later extended to 42 due to a Green-white-checkered finish) laps were able to be completed.|$|E

5000|$|... == Decline == Even in the United States, {{the bucket}} seat has largely {{replaced}} the bench seat; the bucket {{is viewed as}} [...] "sportier", and smaller cars have made the middle position less viable. For high performance cars, bucket seats help keep the driver in place during high accelerations. Some pickup and larger trucks are still available with bench seats which would {{only be able to}} seat two if bucket seats were fitted, though some extended and <b>crew</b> <b>cabs</b> retain them to keep costs down since separate availability of bucket seats (captain's chairs) adds to the parts cost.|$|R

50|$|Current {{and recent}} {{operational}} scenarios now call for logistic trucks of the FMTV type {{to at least}} {{have the option of}} cab armoring. When it entered production, armoring was not considered an option for the FMTV.The first protection solution for the FMTV was not in answer to such scenarios, but was developed by Stewart & Stevenson and O'Gara-Hess & Eisenhardt Armoring Company (OHE). Called the <b>Crew</b> Protected <b>Cab,</b> it was specifically for the HIMARS variant and offered flash and Foreign Object Debris (FOD) protection during launch. Designs followed for an Enhanced <b>Crew</b> Protected <b>Cab,</b> and later an Armor Protected Cab, each adding more ballistic capability against direct fire, artillery burst and mines.|$|R
