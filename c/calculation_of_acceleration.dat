The aim {{of this article is}} to create a better understanding of the complexity of acceleration claims. It should also lead to new insights into claim procedures and the substantiation of acceleration costs. The impacts and delays which may result in acceleration claims on a project were analysed as they form the basis for establishing liability in terms of a particular contract. Matters of principle that are applicable to acceleration claims, regardless of the form of contract recommended for use in the South African construction industry, were also examined. The findings indicate that there are significant differences on a number of aspects regarding the <b>calculation</b> <b>of</b> <b>acceleration</b> costs on construction projects between contractors, consultants and employers/developers. The majority of the respondents, however, were of the opinion that of the various methods used for calculating acceleration costs, the time impact analysis is most frequently applied, but that the modified total cost approach is the method most suitable on projects where there is a significant increase in the scope of work, something that occurs regularly on construction projects...|$|E

Instead of a bathtub curve, the desirable shape of a failure rate covering the entire life of a good product, which might be called hockey-stick line, is introduced. From the hockey-stick line and the definition of reliability, two measurements are extracted. The terms r-reliability (failure rate) and durability (product life) are explained. The conceptual analysis of failure mechanics explains that reliability technology pertains to design area. The desirable shape of hazard rate curve of electronic items, hockey-stick line, clarifies that Mean-Time-to-failure (MTTF) as the inverse of failure rate can be regarded a nominal life.

We also presented a software design methodology for embedded real-time systems. Here we describe a system developed using this methodology and discuss its advantages.

40|$|This thesis {{considers}} liquid motion within moving open containers. The {{objective is}} to determine the open-loop acceleration profile for moving the container in minimum time without excessive slosh. This very common problem in the packaging industry has a significant influence on production capacity and quality. Traditionally, motion control problems have been solved with purely mechanical devices. The introduction of modern servo systems to control movement has increased flexibility and it is now possible to vary the acceleration profile depending on the product. Since the fluid dynamics of different products are very different (for example compare skim milk with yoghurt) {{they do not have the}} same optimal acceleration profile. This has lead to an increased interest in systematic methods for <b>calculation</b> <b>of</b> <b>acceleration</b> profiles. Experiments show that slosh exhibits two nonlinear behaviors: amplitude dependent oscillation frequency and asymmetric oscillation. The surface elevation was measured with a infrared laser displacement sensor. A linear second order oscillator was used, which captures the basic behavior, to model the slosh. The acceleration profiles were calculated by solving different optimal control problems both numerically and analytically. The performance of the obtained acceleration strategies were evaluated in experiments. The experiments show that the acceleration profiles calculated by solving a minimum-energy problem gives the best performance. The minimum-time strategies fails due to low model accuracy.

40|$|Service life {{prediction}} {{is an important}} topic in wood research, {{especially with regard to}} the Construction Products Regulation (CPR). Both laboratory tests as well as in-service performance testing is therefore essential, in combination with proper monitoring and analysis tools. A crucial concept is variability and the incorporation of variability in tests and analysis. In this paper we focus on the use of probability density functions (pdf) to describe time-to-failure in field tests as such build further on the pdf fitting as described in part I of this publication. The statistical approach elaborated here, shows that statistically sound results can be obtained even if data are censored, i. e. when for some samples the time-to-failure criterion has not been reached yet or when the exact date of failure is not known e. g. due to non-continuous monitoring, which is normally the case for field testing. Different wood species and treatments exposed in an EN 252 set-up are compared for the test site Hamburg, Germany, and illustrate how a reference product has a longer time-to-failure than e. g. pine sapwood, and shows the sharp failure of the latter. The comparison of double layer samples at different sites resulted in the <b>calculation</b> <b>of</b> <b>acceleration</b> factors compared to the Hamburg site. Also, acceleration factors for shaded and non-shaded set-up were calculated. Seemingly, such an analysis is valuable to rate different sites and to compare different set-ups.

40|$|In {{the field}} of {{hydraulic}} power plant, the leading edge cavitation is often responsible of sever erosion which may cause a premature shutdown of energy production with costly consequences. This type of cavitation is characterized by an attached vapour cavity {{at the leading edge}} of the blades. Transient vapour vortices are generated and convected by the mean ow to the pressure recovery region where they collapse violently. The resulting water hammer pressure is responsible of material damage. In order to investigate the cavitation erosion problem, many theoretical and experi- mental research has been performed in hydrodynamics, mechanical science and metallurgy. We intend in the present work to describe the hydrodynamic attack and provide new mathematical model to characterize and predict the pressure impulses induced on solid surface by repeated collapses of transient cavities. First, the dynamics of a single vortex collapse is performed in the IMHEF Cavitation Vortex Generator. High speed visualization shows systematic rebound of such cavity after the collapse. This explosive rebound is due to the dissolved gas and leads to the generation of a strong shock waves which propagates in the liquid and the solid as well. Assuming Tait'equation for water, an estimation of the shock overpressure has been performed by image processing. Overpressure as high as 2 GPa has been thus measured. Furthermore, the maximum potential energy of the cavity and the uid corresponding to the maximum volume of the cavity stands as a good basis to characterize the collapse overpressure. Investigation of the shedding process by an attached cavity is carried out in the IMHEF High Speed Cavitation Tunnel on a 2 D NACA 009 blade. The hydrofoil is equipped with 30 piezo resistive pressure transducers. Beside the pressure acquisition, cavitation induced vibrations as well as the main cavity dimensions are synchronously acquired. Pressure spectra and cavitation patterns analysis leads us to consider the free and the forced regime of the main cavity. The forced regime occured when the von Karman vortices frequency matches the first natural frequency of the hydrofoil. In this case, the main cavity pulsation as well as the shedding process are modulated by the blade vibration fre- quency. In the free regime, the main cavity may be stable or unstable. Stable cavitation is characterized by small amplitude of the main cavity pulsation. In this case, the tran- sient cavities have a small size compared to the cavity length and the shedding process is highly instationnary. The unstable cavitation is characterized by large amplitude of main cavity pulsation. The shedding process is modulated by the main cavity pulsation witch is governed by a Strouhal like law. The Strouhal number depends on the incidence angle and stands between 0. 2 and 0. 32. The cavitation induced vibrations are found to be highly modulated by the main cavity pulsations. Envelope <b>calculation</b> <b>of</b> <b>acceleration</b> signals allows to identify the shedding frequency. This result is validated in a centrifugal pump model. In this case, vibration signal is found to be modulated by the blade passing frequency. Furthermore, we have shown that the use of two accelerometers allows a better cavitation detection through the coherence function corresponding to the acceleration envelopes in well chosen frequency band. Amplitude demodulation of vibration signals stands as a promising technique that may allow in short future the cavitation monitoring in hydraulic machines. Analysis of the previous results allows to build the model of Cavitation Erosion Power. This model is based on the assumption that the pressure aggressiveness of a single cavity is proportional to its potential energy. Furthermore, in the lake of direct measurements of the vapour volume of the transient cavities, the main cavity length is used to scale the dimension of the erosive cavities. The cavitation Erosion Power is related to the macroscopic parameters in a simple way. The validation of this model is performed in the case of isolated hydrofoil by assuming that the pressure uctuations downstream of the main cavity is characteristic of the cavitation aggressiveness. In hydraulic runners, the leading cavitation is often in the forced regime and the Strouhal law is no more available. In this case, the shedding frequency is unknown. In order to overcome this problem and calculate the cavitation erosion power, vibratory approach may be used to measure the shedding frequency...|$|E
40|$|A {{doctoral}} thesis submitted in partial fulfilment {{of the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Assessment of wielded implement performance is important {{to a variety of}} human endeavours and often critical to success in a sports context, particularly so in the game of tennis. Tennis racket design and manufacture is a multimillion business involving 10 major international companies. Tennis participation is currently estimated at around 60 million individuals worldwide. Thus the importance of optimum racket performance to maximise competitive advantage and minimise the risks of injury is clear. This thesis presents work to enable advances in tennis racket performance with respect to player feel perception, measurement of physical phenomena and the correlation of these aspects within real play contexts. To investigate feel perception a methodology was adapted from the existing literature. Interview testing was conducted to elicit a comprehensive range of tennis specific vocabulary. The end goal was to create a perception relationship map or ‘feel map’. The inductive analysis was used to link all the related clustered themes identified from the vocabulary to sub and base themes describing the relationship. Further analysis introduced higher level general dimensions that unified common base themes. The resulting feel maps were created from both English and German sample groups, with a view to subsequent comparison. To complete the map and broaden its application a wide scale questionnaire was distributed to a tennis playing population. The responses provided data indicating percentile use of selected vocabulary within the tennis community and the relative importance players associate with assorted perception groups. Visual representations of the data were introduced to the map for quick and easy use and an associated lexicon compiled to provide a reference for more detailed information. The feel maps and lexicon provide users with a versatile tool {{in the form of a}} ‘perception relationship model’. The map itself can act as an overall research guide for future work in the field. The addition of percentile use and relative importance data mean the map can be used to create more informed and subtle player test questionnaires or as a design aid, with interdependency links indicating which additional factors should be considered or exploited for their influence on the characteristic areas in question. Interestingly the general dimensions of highest relative importance were sound and grip respectively. This may be due to the basic level of interaction between player and racket which ultimately has to be perceived either through the grip or from the sound. A perception test questionnaire was also created with the use of the feel map and later used to study the correlation between objective and subjective measures. To best attain objective measures from the racket an innovative instrumentation system was created. Two alternative systems were designed and tested, the first based on wired instrumentation and data capture the second based on wireless technologies as these became available. Both systems were required to take measures of grip pressure and acceleration with 6 degrees of freedom. The first system utilised uniaxial accelerometers mounted on an aluminium bracket, and a triaxial accelerometer inserted inside the butt of the racket arranged to allow measurement and <b>calculation</b> <b>of</b> <b>acceleration</b> from the required 6 degrees of freedom. The system could be adapted to include either TekScan multi-cell full grip coverage force measurement, or 2 single point higher sample rate single cell grip force sensors. All data was fed via 15 m of cable to data acquisition systems. This restricted the participants’ freedom of movement and encumbered the racket and thus the systems application, making it unsuitable for extensive perception or fatigue testing. The second system utilised a compact data logger with an integrated on board tri-axial accelerometer small enough to be mounted within the racket handle. A revised mount overcame the need for the aluminium throat bracket, moving the uniaxial accelerometers into a bulbous addition to the butt of the racket. The system was capable of capturing 8 channels simultaneously which allowed for the 6 accelerometers and two single cell grip force sensors to be located under the grip. The system was more difficult to adapt and maintain than the wired system, but improved freedom and reduced added weight to the racket made the system far more suitable for the planned perception and fatigue testing. Fatigue testing conducted with the wireless device investigated the effect of full body fatigue on players’ performance by monitoring the resultant effects in the racket. The protocol was based on the multistage fitness test, designed to progressively increase in difficulty until volitional fatigue. Heart rate data indicated that the protocol was successful in fatiguing the participants to a point at or near their VO 2 max. Unfortunately, with the wireless system in its early stages of development, the device failed mid way through testing. The limited data set that was collected indicated that technique was affected by fatigue. Further research is required to confirm this finding and to make comparisons between racket types during the fatiguing process. The wireless device was adapted to make it more durable and reliable before the planned perception testing was conducted. A protocol was developed to investigate the affect of changing racket moment of inertia on player perception and physical measures. The test questionnaire developed from the feel map was used to evaluate player perception ratings of various elements of racket feel, and the wireless instrumentation system was used as part of methodology designed to compile a set of comparable physical data. A detailed analysis of the results revealed that there was some evidence of correlation between the perceptions of power, balance, flexibility and control and the moment of inertia of the racket. In a design optimisation context, however, more definitive correlations would be more useful. These would be expected to be found with future testing utilising a wider range of racket properties. The research proves to a large extent the original hypothesis that through the use of non invasive instrumentation and improved player perception elicitation techniques it is possible to substantially and usefully improve the objective and subjective assessment of tennis racket performance in play to enable investigation of better design characteristics and fatigue related injury phenomena...|$|E

By comparison of the results {{it was found that}} the deviations were small, therefore it was concluded that the simulation was successfully performed...|$|R
5000|$|Singer's speculations were correct; Sharpless's {{calculations}} {{were affected}} by differences between observations. Additionally, the orbital decay is caused not by atmospheric drag, but by solid body tidal forces not considered by Shklovsky. Nonetheless, Sharpless's work stands as the first useful <b>calculation</b> <b>of</b> Phobos's secular <b>acceleration.</b> (His calculations for Deimos, conversely, were deemed [...] "barely significant" [...] due to their high systematic error.) Both Sharpless and Shklovsky have craters on Phobos named in their honor.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Two {{methods of}} {{determining}} a quasi-steady acceleration component arising {{on board the}} International Space Station were compared. The first method {{was based on the}} <b>calculation</b> <b>of</b> the <b>accelerations</b> by telemetry information about station attitude motion. The second method consisted in direct measuring the accelerations by a thriaxial low frequency accelerometer and subsequent smoothing measurement data. The measurement data were produced by MAMS. Comparison <b>of</b> the <b>acceleration</b> values, obtained by different ways, was carried out as a result of constructing the approximation <b>of</b> the measured <b>acceleration</b> values by their calculated values. The approximation was constructed by the least squares method. Ajustable parameters were the constant biases in measurement data and coordinates of the accelerometer position in the coordinate system, connected to the centre of mass of the station. Both methods gave similar results. The received estimations of the accelerometer coordinates can be used for the more precise definition of the position of the station centre of inertia.
