5|$|In particular, after 1849, Wagner resented Meyerbeer's {{continuing}} {{success at}} a time when his own vision of German opera had little chance of prospering. After the May Uprising in Dresden of 1849, Wagner was for some years a political refugee facing a prison sentence or worse should he return to Saxony. During his period of living in exile he had few sources of income and little opportunity of getting his own works performed. The success of Le prophète sent Wagner over the edge, and he was also deeply envious of Meyerbeer's wealth. In reaction he published, under a pseudonym, his 1850 essay 'Jewishness in Music'. Without specifically naming Meyerbeer, he interpreted the popular success of the latter as the undermining of German music by alleged Jewish venality and willingness to cater to the lowest tastes, and attributed the supposed poor quality of such 'Jewish music' to Jewish speech and song patterns, which 'though the cultured son of Jewry takes untold pains to strip them off, nevertheless they shew an impertinent obstinacy in <b>cleaving</b> to him'.|$|E
5|$|The {{amorphous}} form is {{an assortment}} of carbon atoms in a non-crystalline, irregular, glassy state, not held in a crystalline macrostructure. It is present as a powder, and is the main constituent of substances such as charcoal, lampblack (soot) and activated carbon. At normal pressures, carbon {{takes the form of}} graphite, in which each atom is bonded trigonally to three others in a plane composed of fused hexagonal rings, just like those in aromatic hydrocarbons. The resulting network is 2-dimensional, and the resulting flat sheets are stacked and loosely bonded through weak van der Waals forces. This gives graphite its softness and its <b>cleaving</b> properties (the sheets slip easily past one another). Because of the delocalization of one of the outer electrons of each atom to form a π-cloud, graphite conducts electricity, but only in the plane of each covalently bonded sheet. This results in a lower bulk electrical conductivity for carbon than for most metals. The delocalization also accounts for the energetic stability of graphite over diamond at room temperature.|$|E
5|$|According to Thai tradition, however, Thado Dhamma Yaza and Maha Chakkraphat {{engaged in}} single elephant-combat. (The custom {{of the time}} was for two commanders/leaders of the same status to fight in single combat. It is unclear {{as to why the}} Siamese king would have {{accepted}} to face someone of lesser rank. If he did issue the challenge, he would have challenged his counterpart Tabinshwehti and accepted to face only Tabinshwehti.) The Thai narrative continues that Maha Chakkraphat's elephant panicked and gave flight, charging away from the enemy; Thado Dhamma Yaza swiftly gave chase. Fearing for the life of her husband, Queen Sri Suriyothai charged ahead to put her elephant between the King and the Viceroy, thereby blocking his pursuit. The Viceroy then engaged the Queen in single combat, fatally <b>cleaving</b> her from shoulder to heart with his spear, also wounding her daughter—both mother and child met their deaths {{on the back of the}} same elephant. It is said that the Viceroy did not know he was fighting a woman until his blow struck—as she fell dying her helmet came off, exposing her long hair. Prince Ramesuan and Prince Mahin then urged their elephants forward to fight the Viceroy, drove him and his remaining forces from the field, then carried the bodies of their mother and sister back to Ayutthaya. The Siamese king meanwhile rallied his army, and retreated in good order back towards the capital. The Burmese chronicles however do not mention any instance of single combat (on elephant-back or otherwise) by the viceroy of Prome.|$|E

The Braves discover that Ivy is Raubahn's trusted advisor Eline Roaille, who is captured at the gates of a Garlean Castrum. A new Scion, Moenbryda, arrives from Sharlayan and provides critical advice for locating Iceheart. Using her body as a vessel, Iceheart summons Shiva into herself and challenges the Warrior of Light. Though the adventurer's band defeats Shiva, Iceheart escapes, bidding the meddler to consult with Midgardsormr. Based on the player's encounters with Lahabrea and Shiva, Moenbryda hypothesizes that Ascians may be permanently destroyed by trapping their souls within white auracite and <b>cleaving</b> them with a blast of pure aether, much like Hydaelyn's blade of light. Lucia of the Temple Knights requests that the Warrior of Light investigate suspicious activity at the Keeper of the Lake. At its apex, the adventurer discovers that Midgardsormr lives on, slowly regenerating from his apparent death. He divulges that Nidhogg, one of his seven children, has rallied the Dravanian horde to renew their attack on Ishgard. Sensing the hero's connection to Hydaelyn, Midgardsormr invokes an ancient pact with the Mothercrystal and seals away her blessing as a test of the player's worth. The Ascian Nabriales takes advantage of the opportunity to infiltrate the Scions' headquarters in pursuit of Louisoix's staff. Moenbryda sacrifices herself to create the blade of light necessary to completely destroy the Ascian.|$|E

40|$|Time of {{the first}} {{cleavage}} {{has been used as}} an indicator to determine developmental rate and quality of embryos in many species. The aim {{of this study was to}} examine effect of time {{of the first}} cleavage on cat embryo development and blastocyst quality. After in vitro fertilization, embryos were observed twice at 27 and 42 hours. Embryos <b>cleaved</b> at 27 hours post-fertilization (pf) were classified as early <b>cleaved</b> embryos and were separated from the remainder which were determined as delayed <b>cleaved</b> embryos (<b>cleaved</b> between 27 and 42 hours). These two groups were separately cultured in the same condition for 7 days to observe embryo developmental and blastocyst formation rates. To evaluate the embryo quality, cells of the blastocyst were classified into inner cell mass (ICM) and trophectoderm cell (TE). The results showed that the percentages of the 8 -cell and morula of the early <b>cleaved</b> embryos and the delayed <b>cleaved</b> embryos were not different (100. 0 vs. 96. 0 % and 97. 1 vs. 92. 0 %, respectively; p> 0. 05), whereas the blastocyst rates of the early <b>cleaved</b> embryos were greater than the delayed <b>cleaved</b> embryos (68. 4 vs 20. 0 %; p< 0. 05). The total and ICM cell numbers of the blastocysts derived from the early <b>cleaved</b> embryos were higher than those of the delayed <b>cleaved</b> embryos (85. 9 vs 71. 6 cells, p< 0. 05). Moreover, the early <b>cleaved</b> embryos had a higher percentage of ICM cells than the delayed <b>cleaved</b> embryos (38. 0 vs 31. 9 %, p< 0. 05).

25|$|Silica can {{be drawn}} into fibers at {{reasonably}} high temperatures, and has a fairly broad glass transformation range. One other advantage is that fusion splicing and <b>cleaving</b> of silica fibers is relatively effective. Silica fiber also has high mechanical strength against both pulling and even bending, provided that the fiber is not too thick and that the surfaces have been well prepared during processing. Even simple <b>cleaving</b> (breaking) of {{the ends of the}} fiber can provide nicely flat surfaces with acceptable optical quality. Silica is also relatively chemically inert. In particular, it is not hygroscopic (does not absorb water).|$|E

25|$|The enzyme {{works by}} <b>cleaving</b> the adenosylcobalamin C-Co(III) bond, giving the carbon and cobalt (III) atoms each an electron.
