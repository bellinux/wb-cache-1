5|$|Like the United States, the Soviet Union (USSR) {{carried out}} {{research}} on multiple enrichment technologies for the Soviet atomic bomb project. A trial electromagnetic process {{was carried out}} in 1946 with a <b>calutron</b> using a magnet taken from Germany. A site was chosen for an electromagnetic plant at Sverdlovsk-45 in 1946. The pilot plant, known as Plant 418, was completed in 1948. A more efficient design was developed in which the particle beams were bent by 225° instead of 180° as in the American <b>calutron.</b> It was used to complete the uranium enrichment process after technical difficulties were encountered with the gaseous diffusion process. Uranium enriched to about 40 percent uranium-235 was brought to Sverdlovsk-45 for final enrichment to between 92 and 98 percent. After the problems with the gaseous diffusion process were resolved in 1950, it was decided not to proceed with a full-scale electromagnetic plant. , it remains operational. In 1969, a research <b>calutron</b> known as S-2 was built at Arzamas-16 for high-efficiency separation of isotopes of heavy elements like plutonium.|$|E
5|$|In 1941, with World War II {{raging in}} Europe but the United States not yet at war, Feynman {{spent the summer}} working on {{ballistics}} problems at the Frankford Arsenal in Pennsylvania. After the attack on Pearl Harbor had brought the United States into the war, Feynman was recruited by Robert R. Wilson, who was working on means to produce enriched uranium for use in an atomic bomb, as part of {{what would become the}} Manhattan Project. Wilson's team at Princeton was working on a device called an isotron, which would electromagnetically separate uranium-235 from uranium-238. This was done in a quite different manner from that used by the <b>calutron</b> that was under development by a team under Wilson's former mentor, Ernest O. Lawrence, at the Radiation Laboratory of the University of California. On paper, the isotron was many times more efficient than the <b>calutron,</b> but Feynman and Paul Olum struggled {{to determine whether or not}} it was practical. Ultimately, on Lawrence's recommendation, the isotron project was abandoned.|$|E
5|$|Tennessee Eastman {{was hired}} to manage Y-12 on the usual cost plus fixed fee basis, with a fee of $22,500 per month plus $7,500 per {{racetrack}} for the first seven racetracks and $4,000 per additional racetrack. Workers were recruited in the Knoxville area. The typical recruit was a young woman, a recent graduate of a local high school. Training was initially conducted at the University of Tennessee. Training switched to Berkeley from April to September 1943, where it {{was conducted on the}} XA <b>calutron</b> and a 1:16 scale model of the Alpha racetrack, and then to Oak Ridge when the XAX <b>calutron</b> became available. Some 2,500 operators would be required once all the Alpha II calutrons were available. The Tennessee Eastman payroll at Y-12 ballooned from 10,000 in mid-1944 to 25,000 in mid-1945. For security reasons, the trainees were not informed of the purpose of the equipment they were taught to operate.|$|E
5|$|The {{workforce}} at Y-12 {{dropped from}} a wartime peak of 22,482 on 21 August 1945 to less than 1,700 in 1949. All the <b>calutrons</b> were removed and dismantled, except for the XAX and XBX training tracks in Building 9731, and the Beta 3 racetracks in Building 9204–3. In 1947, Eugene Wigner, {{the director of the}} Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), asked the Atomic Energy Commission for permission to use the Beta <b>calutrons</b> to produce isotopes for physics experiments. Permission was granted, and a wide range of isotopes was produced. Lithium-6 from the Beta <b>calutrons</b> was used for research into thermonuclear weapons. Many other isotopes were used for peaceful scientific and medical purposes. The Beta 3 racetracks were transferred to the ORNL in March 1950. By the mid-1950s, the Beta <b>calutrons</b> had produced quantities of all the naturally occurring stable isotopes except those of osmium, which had to wait until April 1960. The <b>calutrons</b> continued to produce isotopes until 1998. , they are still on standby.|$|R

5|$|The {{experiments}} with the 184-inch magnet {{led to the}} construction of a prototype <b>calutron</b> called the XA. It contained a rectangular, three-coil magnet with a horizontal field in which the <b>calutron</b> tanks could stand side by side, with four vacuum tanks, each with a double source. At the 25 June 1942 meeting of the S-1 Executive Committee, which had superseded the S-1 Uranium Committee on 19 June, there was a proposal to build the electromagnetic plant at Oak Ridge, where the other Manhattan Project facilities would be located, for reasons of economy and security. Lawrence lodged an objection due to his desire to have the electromagnetic separation plant located much nearer to Berkeley. The Shasta Dam area in California remained under consideration for the electromagnetic plant until September 1942, by which time Lawrence had dropped his objection. The 25 June meeting also designated Stone & Webster as the primary contractor for the design and engineering.|$|E
5|$|A <b>calutron</b> is a mass {{spectrometer}} originally designed {{and used for}} separating the isotopes of uranium. It was developed by Ernest Lawrence during the Manhattan Project and was based on his earlier invention, the cyclotron. Its name was derived from California University Cyclotron, in tribute to Lawrence's institution, the University of California, where it was invented. Calutrons {{were used in the}} industrial-scale Y-12 uranium enrichment plant at the Clinton Engineer Works in Oak Ridge, Tennessee. The enriched uranium produced was used in the Little Boy atomic bomb that was detonated over Hiroshima on 6 August 1945.|$|E
5|$|After the 1990–91 Gulf War, UNSCOM {{determined}} that Iraq had been pursuing a <b>calutron</b> program to enrich uranium. Iraq chose {{to develop the}} electromagnetic process over more modern, economic, and efficient methods of enrichment because calutrons were easier to build, with fewer technical challenges, and the components required to build them were not subject to export controls. At the time the program was discovered, Iraq {{was estimated to be}} two or three years away from producing enough material for nuclear weapons. The program was destroyed in the Gulf War. Consequently, the Nuclear Suppliers Group added the electromagnetic separation equipment to its guidelines for transfers of nuclear-related dual-use equipment, material and technology.|$|E
50|$|<b>Calutrons</b> were {{inefficient and}} {{expensive}} {{to build and}} operate. As soon as the engineering obstacles posed by the gaseous diffusion process had been overcome and the gaseous diffusion cascades began operating at Oak Ridge in 1945, all of the <b>calutrons</b> were shut down. The gaseous diffusion technique then became the preferred technique for producing enriched uranium.|$|R
50|$|The Y-12 {{facility}} began {{operating in}} November 1943, separating uranium-235 from natural uranium, which is 99.3% uranium-238, by using <b>calutrons</b> to perform electromagnetic isotope separation. Y-12 separated the uranium-235 for Little Boy, the nuclear weapon that was dropped on Hiroshima, Japan on August 6, 1945. K-25, another facility in Oak Ridge, produced enriched uranium using gaseous diffusion. However, K-25 {{did not begin}} operating until March 1945 and fed slightly enriched uranium to Y-12's Beta <b>Calutrons</b> as the push to obtain enough uranium 235 for Little Boy came in the early summer of 1945. The S-50 Thermal Diffusion Plant at the K-25 site also provided feed material for Y-12's Beta <b>Calutrons.</b>|$|R
5|$|Groves {{authorized}} Alpha II in September 1943. This {{consisted of}} two new Alpha process buildings, 9201-4 and 9201-5, another Beta, 9204-2, an extension to the Alpha chemistry building, and a new Beta chemistry building, 9206. When 9206 opened, the old Beta chemistry building, 9203, was converted into a laboratory. Work started on the new Alpha II process buildings on 2 November 1943; the first racetrack was completed in July 1944, and all four were operational by 1 October 1944. The Alpha II racetracks were configured in a linear layout rather than an oval, although they were still called racetracks. In all, there were 864 Alpha <b>calutrons,</b> arranged in nine racetracks of 96. There were only 36 <b>calutrons</b> in each Beta racetrack, {{for a total of}} 288 <b>calutrons,</b> although only 216 of them were ever operated.|$|R
5|$|When the <b>calutron</b> {{was first}} {{operated}} on 2 December 1941, {{just days before}} the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor brought the United States into World War II, a uranium beam intensity of 5 microamperes (μA) was received by the collector. Lawrence's hunch about the effect of the air molecules in the vacuum chamber was confirmed. A nine-hour run on 14 January 1942 with a 50 μA beam produced 18 micrograms (μg) of uranium enriched to 25% uranium-235, about ten times as much as Nier had produced. By February, improvements in the technique allowed it to generate a 1,400 μA beam. That month, 75 μg samples enriched to 30% were shipped to the British and the Metallurgical Laboratory in Chicago.|$|E
5|$|Other {{researchers}} also investigated electromagnetic isotope separation. At Princeton University, a {{group led by}} Henry D. Smyth and Robert R. Wilson developed a device known as an isotron. Using a klystron, {{they were able to}} separate isotopes using high-voltage electricity rather than magnetism. Work continued until February 1943, when, in view of the greater success of the <b>calutron,</b> work was discontinued and the team was transferred to other duties. At Cornell University a group under Lloyd P. Smith that included William E. Parkins, and A. Theodore Forrester devised a radial magnetic separator. They were surprised that their beams were more precise than expected, and, like Lawrence, deduced that it was a result of stabilization of the beam by air in the vacuum chamber. In February 1942, their team was consolidated with Lawrence's in Berkeley.|$|E
5|$|The <b>calutron</b> {{is a type}} of sector mass spectrometer, an {{instrument}} in which a sample is ionized and then accelerated by electric fields and deflected by magnetic fields. The ions ultimately collide with a plate and produce a measurable electric current. Since the ions of the different isotopes have the same electric charge but different masses, the heavier isotopes are deflected less by the magnetic field, causing the beam of particles to separate out into several beams by mass, striking the plate at different locations. The mass of the ions can be calculated according to the strength of the field and the charge of the ions. During World War II, calutrons were developed to use this principle to obtain substantial quantities of high-purity uranium-235, by taking advantage of the small mass difference between uranium isotopes.|$|E

25|$|Sector mass spectrometers {{known as}} calutrons were {{developed}} by Ernest O. Lawrence and used for separating the isotopes of uranium during the Manhattan Project. <b>Calutron</b> mass spectrometers were used for uranium enrichment at the Oak Ridge, Tennessee Y-12 plant established during World War II.|$|E
25|$|In the {{electromagnetic}} isotope separation process (EMIS), metallic uranium is first vaporized, and then ionized to positively charged ions. The cations are then accelerated and subsequently deflected by magnetic fields onto their respective collection targets. A production-scale mass spectrometer named the <b>Calutron</b> was developed during World War II that provided {{some of the}} 235U used for the Little Boy nuclear bomb, which was dropped over Hiroshima in 1945. Properly the term 'Calutron' applies to a multistage device arranged in a large oval around a powerful electromagnet. Electromagnetic isotope separation has been largely abandoned in favour of more effective methods.|$|E
25|$|Other {{universities}} {{were eager to}} secure cyclotron technology, and Thornton helped the University of Michigan set up one in 1935. In 1940 he left Berkeley for a position as {{an associate professor at}} Washington University at St. Louis, where he again built a cyclotron, but he returned to Berkeley in 1942 at Lawrence's request to assist with the development of the <b>calutron.</b> This was a device for uranium enrichment using electromagnetic separation, as part of the Manhattan Project, the effort to develop atomic bombs during World War II. He worked in Boston with Stone and Webster, and eventually became assistant director of the Process Improvement Division of the Tennessee Eastman Corporation at the Clinton Engineer Works at Oak Ridge, Tennessee. During the war he became a naturalized US citizen.|$|E
50|$|Uranium {{tetrachloride}} {{is produced}} commercially by {{the reaction of}} carbon tetrachloride with pure uranium dioxide UO2 at 370 °C. It {{has been used as}} feed in the electromagnetic isotope separation (EMIS) process of uranium enrichment. Beginning in 1944, the Oak Ridge Y-12 Plant converted UO3 to UCl4 feed for the Ernest O. Lawrence's Alpha <b>Calutrons.</b> Its major benefit being the uranium tetrachloride used in the <b>calutrons</b> is not as corrosive as the uranium hexafluoride used in most other enrichment technologies This process was abandoned in the 1950s. In the 1980s, however, Iraq unexpectedly revived this option as part of its nuclear weapons program. In the enrichment process, uranium tetrachloride is ionized into a uranium plasma.|$|R
500|$|Electromagnetic isotope {{separation}} used devices known as <b>calutrons,</b> {{a hybrid of}} two laboratory instruments, the mass spectrometer and cyclotron. The name was derived from [...] "California university cyclotrons". In November 1943, Lawrence's team at Berkeley was bolstered by 29 British scientists, including Oliphant.|$|R
5|$|Electromagnetic {{separation}} for {{uranium enrichment}} was {{abandoned in the}} post-war period {{in favor of the}} more complicated, but more efficient, gaseous diffusion method. Although most of the <b>calutrons</b> of the Manhattan Project were dismantled {{at the end of the}} war, some remained in use to produce isotopically enriched samples of naturally occurring elements for military, scientific and medical purposes.|$|R
500|$|In 1945, the British {{atomic bomb}} project built a 180° <b>calutron,</b> similar in design to an American Beta <b>calutron,</b> at the Atomic Energy Research Establishment at Harwell, Oxfordshire. Owing {{to the success}} of the gaseous {{diffusion}} plant at Capenhurst, electromagnetic separation was not pursued by the United Kingdom, and the <b>calutron</b> was used to separate isotopes for research. The 180° design was not ideal for this purpose, so Harwell built a 90° <b>calutron,</b> HERMES, the [...] "Heavy Elements and Radioactive Material Electromagnetic Separator". It was inspired by France's SIDONIE and PARIS separators at the Laboratoire René Bernas of the University of Paris IX in Orsay, and PARSIFAL at the military research laboratory of the Commissariat à l'énergie atomique et aux énergies alternatives in Bruyères-le-Châtel. Israel, Japan and France also built some research calutrons, including the SOLIS and MEIRA separators at the Soreq Nuclear Research Center. There is also CERN's Isotope Separator On-Line Detector (ISOLDE), which was built in 1967. [...] Four research and production calutrons were built at the China Institute of Atomic Energy in Beijing of identical design to those of the USSR in the early 1960s. A <b>calutron</b> at the Saha Institute of Nuclear Physics at Bidhan Nagar in India was used to produce plutonium for India's first nuclear test on 18 May 1974.|$|E
500|$|At Princeton, Wilson {{eventually}} {{took over}} Smyth's project {{the development of}} an alternative approach to electromagnetic separation from Lawrence's <b>calutron</b> method, used for the purpose of separating the fissile uranium-235 isotope of uranium from the much more common uranium-238, which is a key step to producing an atomic bomb. By 1941 the project had produced a device called the [...] "isotron," [...] which, unlike the <b>calutron,</b> used an electrical field to separate the uranium instead of a magnetic one.|$|E
500|$|Lawrence {{had a large}} {{cyclotron}} {{under construction}} at Berkeley, one with a [...] magnet. This was converted into a <b>calutron</b> that was switched on {{for the first time}} on 26 May 1942. Like the 37-inch version, it looked like a giant C when viewed from above. The operator sat in the open end, whence the temperature could be regulated, the position of the electrodes adjusted, and even components replaced through an airlock while it was running. The new, more powerful <b>calutron</b> was not used to produce enriched uranium, but for experiments with multiple ion sources. This meant having more collectors, but it multiplied the throughput.|$|E
5000|$|After September 1942 when General Leslie Groves was {{appointed}} {{as the military}} director of the Manhattan Project, Groves funded design and construction of a gigantic array of <b>calutrons</b> for separation of uranium isotopes. The US Army Corps of Engineers contracted with several manufacturing companies including Westinghouse Electric then in East Pittsburgh, PA. Westinghouse assigned Walter Roman to be Manager of separator design.|$|R
50|$|Upon {{finishing}} the Guggenheim Fellowship in 1942, Powell began {{work in the}} Manhattan Project. He became head of the magnet group, which designed the magnets for the <b>calutrons.</b> Developed by Ernest O. Lawrence, these large machines were used to separate uranium isotopes. Powell worked on the pilot models first at the Radiation Laboratory at University of California, Berkeley {{and then on the}} racetracks at Oak Ridge, Tennessee.|$|R
50|$|An {{even better}} {{material}} than copper, except for its high cost, would be silver as this has even lower resistivity. Silver {{has been used}} in rare cases. During World War II the Manhattan project to build the first atomic bomb used electromagnetic devices known as <b>calutrons</b> to enrich uranium. Thousands of tons of silver were borrowed from the U.S. Treasury reserves to build highly efficient low-resistance field coils for their magnets.|$|R
500|$|The 37-inch {{cyclotron}} at Berkeley was dismantled on 24 November 1941, and its magnet used {{to create}} the first <b>calutron.</b> Its name came from California University and cyclotron. The work was initially funded by the Radiation Laboratory from its own resources, with a $5,000 grant from the Research Corporation. In December Lawrence received a $400,000 grant from the S-1 Uranium Committee. The <b>calutron</b> consisted of an ion source, {{in the form of}} a box with a slit in it and hot filaments inside. Uranium tetrachloride was ionized by the filament, and then passed through a [...] slot into a vacuum chamber. The magnet was then used to deflect the ion beam by 180°. The enriched and depleted beams went into collectors.|$|E
500|$|The {{problem was}} that the beams {{interfered}} with each other, producing a series of oscillations called hash. An arrangement was devised that minimized the interference, resulting in reasonably good beams being produced, in September 1942. Robert Oppenheimer and Stan Frankel invented the magnetic shim, a device used to adjust the homogeneity of a magnetic field. These were sheets of iron about [...] in width that were bolted to {{the top and bottom of}} the vacuum tank. The effect of the shims was to slightly increase the magnetic field in such a way as to help focus the ion beam. Work would continue on the shims through 1943. The main <b>calutron</b> patents were Methods of and apparatus for separating materials (Lawrence), Magnetic shims (Oppenheimer and Frankel), and <b>Calutron</b> system (Lawrence).|$|E
500|$|The Alpha racetracks were a 24-fold {{magnification}} of the XA <b>calutron</b> {{that could}} hold 96 <b>calutron</b> Alpha tanks. The calutrons were upright and arrayed {{facing each other}} in pairs of inner and outer machines. To minimize magnetic losses, and to economize on steel consumption, the assembly was curved into an oval shape that formed a closed magnetic loop [...] long, [...] wide and [...] high, {{in the shape of}} a racetrack; hence the name. The two Alpha I buildings, 9201-1 and 9201-2, each contained two racetracks, with only one in the Alpha I, 9201-3. The Beta racetracks were smaller, linear in shape, and optimized for recovery rather than production, with only 36 instead of 96 process bins. The four Alpha II racetracks were also linear in configuration. They incorporated many improvements, the most important being that they had four sources instead of just two. They also had improved magnets and vacuum systems.|$|E
50|$|Pilot {{plants were}} {{built at the}} Anacostia Naval Air Station and the Philadelphia Navy Yard, and a {{production}} facility at the Clinton Engineer Works in Oak Ridge, Tennessee. This was the only production-scale liquid thermal diffusion plant ever built. It could not enrich uranium sufficiently for use in an atomic bomb, but it could provide slightly enriched feed for the Y-12 <b>calutrons</b> and the K-25 gaseous diffusion plants.|$|R
500|$|In February 1945, {{slightly}} enriched 1.4 percent uranium-235 {{feed material}} began arriving from the S-50 liquid thermal diffusion plant. Shipments of product from S-50 were discontinued in April. S-50 product was fed into K-25 instead. In March 1945, Y-12 began receiving feed enriched to 5 percent from K-25. The output {{of these plants}} was {{in the form of}} uranium hexafluoride (...) [...] It was converted to uranium trioxide, which then went into the usual process for conversion to uranium tetrachloride. On 5 August 1945, K-25 started producing feed enriched to 23 percent, enough to be fed straight into the Beta racetracks. The remaining Alpha product was then fed into K-25. By September 1945, the <b>calutrons</b> had produced 88 kilograms of product with an average enrichment of 84.5 percent, and the Beta racetracks turned out another 953 kilograms enriched to 95 percent {{by the end of the}} year. Enriched uranium from the <b>calutrons</b> provided the fissile component of the Little Boy atomic bomb used in the atomic bombing of Hiroshima in August 1945.|$|R
