25|$|To {{achieve a}} loose patch <b>clamp</b> <b>on</b> a cell membrane, the pipette is moved slowly towards the cell, until the {{electrical}} {{resistance of the}} contact between the cell and the pipette increases to a few times greater resistance {{than that of the}} electrode alone. The closer the pipette gets to the membrane, the greater the resistance of the pipette tip becomes, but if too close a seal is formed, and it could become difficult to remove the pipette without damaging the cell. For the loose patch technique, the pipette does not get close enough to the membrane to form a gigaseal or a permanent connection, nor to pierce the cell membrane. The cell membrane stays intact, and the lack of a tight seal creates a small gap through which ions can pass outside the cell without entering the pipette.|$|E

2500|$|After Gizmo {{finds a way}} out of the vent, Mohawk tortures him {{by beating}} him, {{shocking}} him with an electrical wire, putting him in the photocopier, putting Velcro strips on him and ripping them off, and finally ramming him with a toy train while the other gremlins cause the fire sprinklers to go off and spawn a gremlin army that throws the building into chaos. Billy attempts to lure the gremlins into the lobby, where sunlight will kill them; after Billy briefs <b>Clamp</b> <b>on</b> gremlin knowledge, Clamp exits through a secret tunnel to cover the front of the building in a giant sheet to trick the creatures. The gremlins devour serums in the lab; one becomes the intelligent Brain Gremlin, who plans to use a [...] "genetic sunblock" [...] serum to immunize them to sunlight. One gremlin turns into a female, while a third becomes pure electricity and is trapped in Clamp's answering machine by Billy. All the while [...] "Grandpa Fred" [...] films the chaos on camera with help from a Japanese tourist named Mr. Katsuji.|$|E
2500|$|The {{illustration}} to {{the right}} shows a bascinet with a type of detachable nasal (nose protector) called the bretache or bretèche made of sheet metal. The bretache {{was attached to the}} aventail at the chin, and it fastened to a hook or <b>clamp</b> <b>on</b> the brow of the helmet. According to Boeheim, this type of defence was prevalent in Germany, appearing around 1330 and fading from use around 1370. The bretache was also used in Italy; one of the first representations of it is on the equestrian statue of Cangrande I della Scala, who died in 1329. It is also shown on the tomb of Bernardino dei Barbanzoni in the Museo Lapidario Estense in Modena, executed ca. 1345–50. An advantage of the bretache was that it could be worn under a great helm, but afforded some facial protection when the great helm was taken off. Use of the bretache preceded and overlapped with that of a new type of visor used with the bascinet, the [...] "klappvisor" [...] or [...] "klappvisier".|$|E
2500|$|In some of {{the many}} {{interviews}} where she told her life story, Florence Taylor suggested that she had designed up to 100 houses in Sydney during her stint as an architect between 1900 and 1907. Although she left no easy records specifying where these were located, some aspects of her design work have now been documented. In 1907 she worked with her employer John Burcham <b>Clamp</b> <b>on</b> the basement of the Farmers Department store in Pitt Street Sydney, perhaps the first example of a woman contributing to commercial architectural design in Sydney. Also in 1907 she provided a perspective drawing for the winning competition entry for the Commercial Traveller's Building in Sydney (which was demolished {{to make way for the}} MLC Centre in the 1970s). Again in 1907 she won prizes in several architectural design sections of the [...] "First Australian Exhibition of Women's Work" [...] in Melbourne in 1907. Her winning design for a kitchen was published in the NSW Institute of Architects' journal in November 1907. Her second-prize winning design for a seaside cottage had to waited another 50 years before being published in one of her own journals, Construction, on 24 December 1958. Further research has uncovered houses probably designed by Florence Taylor at 12 Florence Street Cremorne, Hogue House in Kareela Road Cremorne and a house built in the 1920s for her sister Annis in Thomas Street Roseville.|$|E

60|$|Rollo {{accordingly}} kept back in Jennie's state room, {{though he}} advanced as {{near to the}} door as he could, and looked in {{to see what had}} happened. He found that his little round window had been burst open by a heavy sea, and that a great quantity of water had rushed in. His couch, which was directly under the window, was completely drenched, and so was the floor; though most of the water, except that which was retained by the bedding and the carpet, had run off through some unseen opening below. When Rollo got where he could see, the chambermaid was busy screwing up his window tight into its place. It has already been explained that this window was formed of one small and very thick pane of glass, of an oval form, and set in an iron frame, which was attached by a hinge on one side, and made to be secured when it was shut by a strong screw and <b>clamp</b> <b>on</b> the other.|$|E
6000|$|... [Illustration: Fig. 1 {{shows the}} simple {{apparatus}} which carries the prism and {{on which the}} photograph is mounted. The former {{is set in a}} round box which can be rotated in the ring {{at the end of the}} arm and can be clamped when adjusted. The arm can be rotated and can also be pulled out or in if desired, and clamped. The floor of the instrument is overlaid with cork covered with black cloth, on which the components can easily be fixed by drawing-pins. When using it, one portrait is pinned down and the other is moved near to it, overlapping its margin if necessary, until the eye looking through the prism sees the required combination; then the second portrait is pinned down also. It may now receive its register-marks from needles fixed in a hinged arm, and this is a more generally applicable method than the plan with cross threads, already described, as any desired feature--the nose, the ear, or the hand, may thus be selected for composite purposes. Let A, B, C, ... Y, Z, be the components. A is pinned down, and B, C, ... Y, Z, are successfully combined with A, and registered. Then before removing Z, take away A and substitute any other of the already registered portraits, say B, by combining it with Z; lastly, remove Z and substitute A by combining it with B, and register it. Fig. 2 shows one of three similarly jointed arms, which <b>clamp</b> <b>on</b> to the vertical covered with cork and cloth, and the other carries Fig. 3, which is a frame having lenses of different powers set into it, and on which, or on the third frame, a small mirror inclined at 45º may be laid. When a portrait requires foreshortening it can be pinned on one of these frames and be inclined to the line of sight; when it is smaller than its fellow it can be brought nearer to the eye and an appropriate lens interposed; when a right-sided profile has to be combined with a left-handed one, it must be pinned on one of the frames and viewed by reflection from the mirror in the other. The apparatus I have drawn is roughly made, and being chiefly of wood is rather clumsy, but it acts well.] ...|$|E

40|$|Experimental panel flutter {{data have}} been {{obtained}} at Mach numbers from 1. 2 to 3. 0 for buckled rectangular panels {{and the effect of}} a pressure differential has been determined. Increasing the pressure differential was effective in eliminating flutter on most of the panels tested. The effects of the variables in the panel flutter parameter ((square root of m(exp 2) - 1) * (E/q)) (exp 1 / 3) t/l (where M is the Mach number, q is the dynamic pressure, E is Young's modulus, and t and l are the panel thickness and length, respectively) were investigated for buckled panels <b>clamped</b> <b>on</b> the front and rear edges and a critical value of this parameter of 0. 44 is indicated at zero pressure differential when the panel width-length ratio is 0. 69. An estimated flutter boundary is presented for buckled panels <b>clamped</b> <b>on</b> four edges, with width-length ratios of 0. 21 to 4. 0. This boundary shows that the panel width is more significant than the panel length when the ratio of width to length is less than approximately 0. 5. Panels <b>clamped</b> <b>on</b> four edges and buckled in two half waves in the direction of flow were found to be particularly susceptible to flutter. The results of limited tests on panels with applied damping, curvature, and lengthwise stiffeners are also presented and discussed...|$|R
