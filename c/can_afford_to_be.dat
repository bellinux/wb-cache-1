5000|$|Higher {{income and}} non-sustainable use of resources: As {{the global economy}} grows, wealthy people consume more food and goods, which have <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{produced}} {{with a lot of}} water and energy.

6000|$|... "The man who bets {{more than}} he <b>can</b> <b>afford</b> <b>to</b> lose <b>is</b> simply a gambler, whether he does so on {{racehorses}} or on cards.

50|$|Critics of SB-32 {{note that}} CARB {{has too much}} un-checked power in {{regulating}} California, and that the legislative branch should have more involvement. However, the passage of AB-197 assuaged many of these critics. Other critics of SB-32 argue that the cap-and-trade program is actually a tax, levied without a two-thirds vote of the Legislature. See Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006 {{for a discussion of}} the current legal challenges facing the cap-and-trade program. Still, further critics assert that the benefits of the CARB-favored cap-and-trade program are not shared equally by all Californians. One preliminary report asserts that polluters who <b>can</b> <b>afford</b> <b>to</b> <b>are</b> continuing <b>to</b> pollute, buying their way out of making actual reductions. And those polluters tend <b>to</b> <b>be</b> located in or near low-income communities that are frequently also communities of color, where their continued emissions of particulate matter and the like are degrading residents’ health.|$|R

60|$|The truth is, that {{recklessness}} has {{a distinct}} tendency to produce coolness. And {{there is no one}} who <b>can</b> <b>afford</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> so deliberate, and of whom other men are so much afraid, as the man who has obviously made up his mind to die fighting.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I will be serious--serious enough. I <b>can</b> <b>afford</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> so, as I have {{received}} my medical passport for to-morrow.

"Very well," [...] {{said the}} baronet, {{willing to change}} the conversation, [...] "you have been so {{fortunate}} of late, you <b>can</b> <b>afford</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> generous; and I advise you to cultivate harmony with your neighbor, or I may take my arms down, and you may lose your noble visiters--see my room prepared." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "Phillips's {{contributions}} {{to the study of}} slavery clearly outweigh his deficiencies. Neither saint nor sinner, he <b>was</b> subject <b>to</b> the same forces-- bias, selectivity of evidence, inaccuracy--that plague us all. Descended from slave owners and reared in the rural South, he dominated slave historiography in an era when Progressivism was literally for whites only. Of all scholars, historians <b>can</b> ill <b>afford</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> anachronistic. Phillips was no more a believer in white supremacy than other leading contemporary white scholars." ...|$|R
40|$|As author Carol Dyhouse covers in her book, Girl Trouble: Panic and Progress in the History of Young Women, despite massive advancements in education, work opportunities, {{political}} rights, {{and personal}} and reproductive freedoms, moral hysteria has accompanied popular rhetoric regarding {{the place of}} young women in society since the Victorian era. <b>Can</b> we <b>afford</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> optimistic {{about the impact of}} modernity on girls? Katherine Williams recommends this insightful, and often witty, read to anyone interested in gender studies, or social histories...|$|R
3000|$|... 26 Forgone {{income is}} an {{opportunity}} cost of participating in the program, i.e., what the household would have earned if the households had not participated in the program. This <b>is</b> unlikely <b>to</b> <b>be</b> zero -- the poor <b>can</b> rarely <b>afford</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> idle. As forgone income in not observable once a household starts working in a program, one way <b>is</b> <b>to</b> assess the forgone income by assessing how much a similar household, which is not currently participating in the program, <b>is</b> able <b>to</b> earn.|$|R

"Sergeant Dunham, we are old fellow-campaigners--that is, as {{campaigns are}} carried on {{here in the}} wilderness; and we have done so many kind acts to each other that we <b>can</b> <b>afford</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> candid--what has caused {{you to believe that}} a girl like Mabel could ever fancy one so rude as I am?" ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{hope you}} do have that trust, for your own sakes, {{for the sake of}} your own happiness, your own sound peace of mind; for then, and then only, you <b>can</b> <b>afford</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> hopeful {{concerning}} yourselves, your families, your country, and the whole human race. It must be so. If you believe that He who hung upon the cross for all mankind is your refuge and strength, and the refuge and strength of all mankind, then, amid all the changes and chances of this mortal life, you <b>can</b> <b>afford</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> still calm in sudden calamity, patient in long afflictions; for you know that He is God, He is the Lord, He is the Redeemer, He is the King.

6000|$|... "And rightly," [...] he said. [...] "Rightly, Comrade Jarvis. She is not {{unworthy of}} your affection. A most companionable animal, {{full of the}} highest spirits. Her knockabout act in the {{restaurant}} would have satisfied the most jaded critic. No diner-out <b>can</b> <b>afford</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> without such a cat.

50|$|On a {{per unit}} area basis (e.g. per square meter or per square foot), {{bungalows}} <b>are</b> more expensive <b>to</b> construct than two-story houses, because a larger foundation and roof area {{is required for the}} same living area. The larger foundation will often translate into larger lot size requirements, as well. Due <b>to</b> this, bungalows <b>are</b> typically fully detached from other buildings and do not share a common foundation or party wall: if the homeowner <b>can</b> <b>afford</b> the extra expense of a bungalow relative to a two-story house, they <b>can</b> typically <b>afford</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> fully detached as well.|$|R

I am for messy vitality over obvious unity. I include the non sequitur and proclaim duality.|$|R
