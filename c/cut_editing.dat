5000|$|A {{camera is}} used instead of a stage light to provoke the {{characters}} into action; Minghella uses a jump <b>cut</b> <b>editing</b> technique {{to make it seem}} as though there are even more than two repetitions of the text. He “made the equipment into a threatening force by switching it with bullying speed from one face to another, forcing unusual speed of delivery for the actors. Juliet Stevenson told Katharine Worth that during rehearsals she had wondered whether the lines were being delivered too fast for viewers to take in their sense but theatre critic, Alice Griffin … thought that the lines ‘came across more clearly and more easily understandable than sometimes in the theatre.’ This she attributed partly to Minghella’s use of close-up, a recurring feature of the film versions naturally enough.” ...|$|E
50|$|Welles {{estimated}} that the editing of the film in a distinctive and experimental style would take approximately one year of full-time work (which was how long he had spent on the experimental, rapidly <b>cut</b> <b>editing</b> of his previous completed film, F for Fake - like F for Fake, the film would have averaged approximately one edit per second, and would have lasted around half an hour longer). On F for Fake, Welles had used three separate moviolas, arranged side-by-side, to simultaneously edit the film. He would perform the cuts to the negative himself, then leave an editing assistant at each moviola to complete the edit while {{he moved to the}} next moviola to begin the next edit. The Other Side of the Wind necessitated even more complicated editing, and Welles lined up five moviolas in a semi-circle around a table, with a staff of assistants to help him.|$|E

5000|$|Before a {{deal was}} put {{together}} in 1998, Oja Kodar screened Gary Graver's rough cut of the film {{for a number of}} famous directors in the 1980s and 1990s, seeking their help in completing the film, but they all turned it down for various reasons. These included John Huston (who was by then terminally ill with emphysemia and was unable to breathe without oxygen tubes), Steven Spielberg, Oliver Stone, Clint Eastwood and George Lucas. Lucas reportedly claimed to be baffled by the footage, saying he didn't {{know what to do with}} it, and that it was too avant garde for a commercial audience. Kodar subsequently accused both Eastwood and Stone of plagiarism from the film, citing Eastwood's performance in Unforgiven (1993) as a copy of John Huston's, including one line of dialogue ("I'm Marvin P. Fassbender." [...] "Of course you are."), and Stone's adoption of the film's distinctive rapidly <b>cut</b> <b>editing</b> and camera style for his JFK (1991), Nixon (1995) and Natural Born Killers (1994). Given the film's unreleased status, it is impossible to verify the accuracy of her accusations of plagiarism.|$|E
5000|$|... "The {{greatest}} lie, I think, {{in dramatic}} TV is the cop who stands over a body and pulls up {{the sheet and}} mutters, Damn and looks down sadly. To a real homicide detective, its just a days work." [...] David Simon Homicides purpose was to provide its viewers with a no-nonsense, police procedural-type glimpse {{into the lives of}} a squad of inner-city detectives. As opposed to many television shows and movies involving cops, Homicide initially opted for a bleak sort of realism in its depiction of [...] "The Job", portraying it as repetitive, spiritually draining, an existential threat to ones psyche, often glamour- and glory-free—but, nonetheless, a social necessity. In its attempt to do so, Homicide developed a trademark feel and look that distinguished itself from its contemporaries. For example, the series was filmed with hand-held 16 mm cameras almost entirely on-location in Baltimore (making the idiosyncratic city something of a character itself). It also regularly used music montages, jump <b>cut</b> <b>editing,</b> and the three-times-in-a-row repetition of the same camera shot during particularly crucial moments in the story. The episodes were also noted for interweaving as many as three or four storylines in a single episode. NBC executives often asked the writers to focus on a single homicide case rather than multiple ones, but the show producers tended to resist this advice.|$|E
5000|$|David Bordwell states, since 1960, US studio filmmaking {{has entered}} a [...] "post classical" [...] period, and that {{although}} it is argued this so-called [...] "post-classical" [...] period changed cinema to an incoherent narrative, films today still generally abide by the same principles as classical filmmaking. This post-classical style of editing, {{sometimes referred to as}} the [...] "MTV Style" [...] of video editing, which has become the visual language of American culture, is a way to edit using fast paced, very quick cuts between shots. Since the 1930s, the average shot length in feature films has decreased from 8-11 seconds to 4.3-4.9 seconds. In the 1970s, average shot length was between 5 and 8 seconds for feature films, dramas, musicals, romance while comedies often contained shorter ASLs. In the 1980s, average shot lengths (ASL) in the double digit range virtually disappeared from feature films. Movies such as Top Gun, and Pink Floyd: The Wall (which were influenced by music videos) demonstrated ASLs from 3-4 seconds. Prior to 2006, this fast <b>cut</b> <b>editing</b> was most prevalently seen in fast paced action movies such as Michael Bay's Armageddon (1998 film) and Pearl Harbor (film) (2001), although they could be found (less often) in other genres of film as well. Editors who had once labored to preserve the illusion of continuous time and space were now fracturing time at space at will. These decreased shot lengths, and jump cuts led not only to a new visual style, but a new generation of narrative, a new style of storytelling.|$|E

40|$|Figure 1 : Sample outputs of our viewer-centric, {{interactive}} editing tool for stereo-cinematography. (I) Input stereo pair, (II) digitally altered versions: (a) modified horizontal image translation, (b) modified field-of-view (FOV), and (c) moved (dolly) virtual camera forward while changing the perceived depths of vertical window edges (proscenium arch). Note the parallax changes {{in all the}} results. A digital editor provides the timeline control necessary {{to tell a story}} through film. Current technology, although sophisticated, does not easily extend to 3 D cinema because stereoscopy is a fundamentally different medium for expression and requires new tools. We formulated a mathematical framework for use in a viewer-centric digital editor for stereoscopic cinema driven by the audience’s perception of the scene. Our editing tool implements this framework and allows both shot planning and after-the-fact digital manipulation of the perceived scene shape. The mathematical framework abstracts away the mechanics of converting this interaction into stereo parameters, such as interocular, field of view, and location. We demonstrate <b>cut</b> <b>editing</b> techniques to direct audience attention and ease scene transitions. User studies were performed to examine these effects. ...|$|E
