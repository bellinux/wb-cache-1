5|$|The {{slopes of}} Licancabur are {{unstable}} {{and prone to}} rock falls. Some of the instability {{may be due to}} earthquakes, snow, wind or geothermal effects (resulting in thermal stress), and it frustrated a 1920s attempt by a Chuquicamata engineer to <b>climb</b> <b>the</b> mountain.|$|E

5|$|A {{group of}} {{mountain}}eers dressed in Alpine costumes used to <b>climb</b> <b>the</b> mountain in early years, and eight divers {{between the ages}} 17 and 24 would dive off the waterfall.

5|$|Along with Annie Smith Peck, Workman was {{recognized}} {{during the early}} 20th century {{as one of the}} most famous female climbers in the world. Their rivalry demonstrated that women could <b>climb</b> <b>the</b> most remote and difficult terrain on the planet. Women had climbed regularly in the Alps since the 1850s, but in the Himalayas, mountaineering had been dominated by wealthy English men. No other women, however, climbed in the Himalaya until well after World War I, by which time improvements in equipment and organization had shifted that nature of risks and difficulties of expeditions.|$|E
5|$|Businesses in Chinatown {{attempted}} to raise $200,000 {{to build an}} 11-story bell tower pagoda {{at the south end}} of the park. The tower was planned to be constructed of brick and stone with a hollow interior. While visitors would not have been able to <b>climb</b> <b>the</b> structure, they would have been able to walk through an entrance at its base. Chicago Sun-Times writer Lee Bey believed the bell tower to be the park's most important feature. Despite the Taiwanese government making an early commitment to help finance the tower, it was never constructed.|$|E

50|$|The {{roles of}} the leader and second in simul {{climbing}} are very different {{than they are in}} free <b>climbing.</b> If <b>the</b> leader falls during free <b>climbing</b> <b>the</b> second (follower) is pulled up from their belay station.

5|$|Demand from {{middlemen}} {{and specialized}} animal trade mafias {{has increased the}} profitability of slow loris hunting and driven many hunters to catch any they spot by climbing or shaking trees. In the Mondulkiri Province in Cambodia, slow lorises are shaken out of trees and then bludgeoned {{to death with a}} stick. In Indonesia, slow lorises are worth more alive, so hunters <b>climb</b> <b>the</b> tree to reach them and place a V-shaped stick around their neck to immobilize them. If the slow loris is found in with an infant, the parent is often killed.|$|E

The top was {{therefore}} reached first by René Pottier, without dismounting, at an average speed of 20km/h. Cornet, who reached the top second, had to wait 20 minutes for his bicycle with higher gear, because his support car had broken down.|$|E
