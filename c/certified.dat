40|$|Abstract. Guaranteeing {{correctness}} of compilation {{is a major}} {{precondition for}} correct software. Code generation {{can be one of}} the most errorprone tasks in a compiler. One way to achieve trusted compilation is <b>certifying</b> compilation. A <b>certifying</b> compiler generates for each run a proof that it has performed the compilation run correctly. The proof is checked in a separate theorem prover. If the theorem prover is content with the proof, one can be sure that the compiler produced correct code. This paper presents a <b>certifying</b> code generation phase for a compiler translating an intermediate language into assembler code. The time spent for checking the proofs is the bottleneck of <b>certifying</b> compilation. We exhibit an improved framework for <b>certifying</b> compilation and considerable advances to overcome this bottleneck.
