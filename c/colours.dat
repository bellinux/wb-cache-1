The only sporting body in South Africa that was allowed to retain Springbok <b>colours</b> was the South African Rugby Union as an act of conciliation towards the white minority who made up the majority of the national rugby union team.|$|E

40|$|In {{this chapter}} the {{importance}} of <b>colour</b> as a design, marketing and sales tool for industry is outlined {{to substantiate the need}} for a strong knowledge of <b>colour</b> and the need to work confidently and proficiently with <b>colour.</b> The chapter is designed in a manner that promotes knowledge development and inspiration, and for the more proactive reader a rich experience of <b>colour</b> can be gained by working through the chapter activities, initially at a computer and later with pigments (paints, dyes), which is highly encouraged and recommended. This workshop approach enables you to experiment with <b>colour</b> mixing and <b>colour</b> schemes to better appreciate <b>colour</b> and its application, without which the theories become just a concept; there really is little substitute for experimentation. A short history of <b>colour</b> is given that focuses on the building of the scientific underpinning of the most predominant theories of <b>colour</b> used today in relation to textile-based products (fashion). Insight is also given into <b>colour</b> psychology in relation to creating colour-ways, <b>colour</b> ranges and <b>colour</b> themes and to <b>colour</b> forecasting. <b>Colour</b> terminology is given and discussed throughout the chapter and the following fundamental theories and <b>colour</b> characteristics are also discussed: •	The principles of additive <b>colour</b> mixing and subtractive <b>colour</b> mixing •	The six-hue <b>colour</b> wheel and the twelve-hue <b>colour</b> wheel •	<b>Colour</b> schemes and <b>colour</b> combinations •	Metamerism •	<b>Colour</b> deficiency (<b>colour</b> blindness) •	<b>Colour</b> measuremen...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} {{relationship}} between <b>colour</b> perception and <b>colour</b> language. Three questions are addressed. The first relates {{to the influence of}} colour- category membership on <b>colour</b> perception, the second to potential influences of <b>colour</b> language on <b>colour</b> perception. The third question asks whether non-linguistic differences in <b>colour</b> perception may influence differences in <b>colour</b> language. Experimental studies provide evidence for categorical <b>colour</b> perception. However, unlike previous studies, the experiments reported here found no evidence that linguistic <b>colour</b> categories underpin, or influence, <b>colour</b> perception. The reasons for this difference are discussed. The findings support the view that linguistic <b>colour</b> categories reflect non-linguistic perceptual <b>colour</b> categories. Finally evidence is presented suggesting that physiological differences in <b>colour</b> perception may influence the <b>colour</b> categories encoded by languages...|$|R
5|$|Sometimes {{the colour}} of a tile is {{understood}} {{as part of the}} tiling; at other times arbitrary <b>colours</b> may be applied later. When discussing a tiling that is displayed in <b>colours,</b> to avoid ambiguity one needs to specify whether the <b>colours</b> are part of the tiling or just part of its illustration. This affects whether tiles with the same shape but different <b>colours</b> are considered identical, which in turn affects questions of symmetry. The four colour theorem states that for every tessellation of a normal Euclidean plane, with a set of four available <b>colours,</b> each tile can be coloured in one colour such that no tiles of equal colour meet at a curve of positive length. The colouring guaranteed by the four-colour theorem does not generally respect the symmetries of the tessellation. To produce a colouring which does, it is necessary to treat the <b>colours</b> as part of the tessellation. Here, as many as seven <b>colours</b> may be needed, as in the picture at right.|$|E

40|$|Australian {{blackwood}} (Acacia melanoxylon R. Br.) is {{a high-quality}} appearance-grade hardwood species native to eastern Australia. Heartwood <b>colour</b> varies from pale cream, straw, golden-brown, red-brown and walnut, with prominent annual growth rings; sapwood <b>colour</b> is generally pale cream. This wide <b>colour</b> range in heartwood {{is associated with}} both between- and within-tree variation. Colorimetry was used to quantify the phenotypic range and variation in heartwood and sapwood <b>colour</b> in stem cores taken from 19 -year-old trees belonging to 16 open-pollinated families. The trees were located in three progeny trials in northern Tasmania, Australia. Cores were also visually classified into four <b>colour</b> and four <b>colour</b> variability classes. Both heartwood and sapwood had very wide <b>colour</b> ranges and high between- and within-tree <b>colour</b> variation. Analysis of variance showed that colorimetry can be successfully used to quantify heartwood <b>colour</b> and <b>colour</b> variability, with lightness and redness differing significantly between visual <b>colour</b> grades, while within-tree maximum <b>colour</b> difference (maximum ΔE 76) was the best derived <b>colour</b> trait in discriminating grades of heartwood <b>colour</b> variation.

5|$|Animals produce colour in {{different}} ways. Pigments are particles of coloured material. Chromatophores are cells containing pigment, which can change their size {{to make their}} colour more or less visible. Some animals, including many butterflies and birds, have microscopic structures in scales, bristles or feathers which give them brilliant iridescent <b>colours.</b> Other animals including squid and some deep-sea fish can produce light, sometimes of different <b>colours.</b> Animals often use {{two or more of}} these mechanisms together to produce the <b>colours</b> and effects they need.|$|E
5|$|As {{the game}} {{gradually}} {{moved away from}} being a pursuit for wealthy amateurs to one dominated by working-class professionals, kits changed accordingly. The clubs themselves, rather than individual players, were now responsible for purchasing kit and financial concerns, along {{with the need for}} the growing numbers of spectators to easily identify the players, led to the lurid <b>colours</b> of earlier years being abandoned in favour of simple combinations of primary <b>colours.</b> In 1890 the Football League, which had been formed two years earlier, ruled that no two member teams could register similar <b>colours,</b> so as to avoid clashes. This rule was later abandoned in favour of one stipulating that all teams must have a second set of shirts in a different colour available. Initially the home team was required to change <b>colours</b> {{in the event of a}} clash, but in 1921 the rule was amended to require the away team to change.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{understand}} CIE (Commission Internationale del Eclairage) <b>Colour</b> Rendering Index (CRI) and its deficiencies. Another aim was to find out limitation of CIE CRI for LEDs. Finally, current works on <b>colour</b> rendering of LEDs was examined in the study. CIE (Commission Internationale del Eclairage) <b>Colour</b> Rendering Index (CRI) is the only internationally recognized <b>colour</b> rendering metric. This metric expresses the <b>colour</b> rendering properties of light sources based on <b>colour</b> shift of test objects when illuminated by reference illuminant and test source. The CIE method to obtain CRI is called CIE test <b>colour</b> (sample) method. Despite of prominence, CIE test <b>colour</b> method has numerous deficiencies. The problems of CIE test <b>colour</b> method became more serious when applied to white light emitting diode based sources. Various studies have indicated that even LEDs with low values of CIE CRI can produce visually appealing, vivid, and natural light. CIE technical committee TC 1 - 62 concluded that the CIE CRI is generally not applicable to predict the <b>colour</b> rendering rank order of white LEDs light sources. The <b>colour</b> quality of light sources is not just a <b>colour</b> difference. <b>Colour</b> discrimination, <b>colour</b> harmony, <b>colour</b> preference, <b>colour</b> acceptability, visual clarity, and brightness are some known dimensions of light source <b>colour</b> quality. For different application different light sources are suitable and relevant dimensions of light source <b>colour</b> quality should be used to select appropriate light sources as per the application.
