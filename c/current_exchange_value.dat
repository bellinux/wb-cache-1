5000|$|List {{argued that}} statesmen had two responsibilities: [...] "one to {{contemporary}} society {{and one to}} future generations". Normally, most of leaders' attention is occupied by urgent matters, leaving little time to consider future problems. But when a country had reached {{a turning point in}} its development, its leaders were morally obliged to deal with issues that would affect the next generation. [...] "On the threshold of a new phase in the development of their country, statesmen should be prepared to take the long view, despite the need to deal also with matters of immediate urgency." [...] List's fundamental doctrine was that a nation's true wealth is the full and many-sided development of its productive power, rather than its <b>current</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>values.</b> For example, its economic education should be more important than immediate production of value, and it might be right that one generation should sacrifice its gain and enjoyment to secure the strength and skill of the future. Under normal conditions, an economically mature nation should also develop agriculture, manufacture and commerce. But the two latter factors were more important because they better influenced the nation's culture and independence. These factors were especially connected to navigation, railways and high technology, while a purely agricultural state tended to stagnate. But, List claims, only countries in temperate regions were adapted to grow higher forms of industry. On the other hand, tropical regions had a natural monopoly in the production of certain raw materials. Thus, there was a spontaneous division of labor and confederation of powers between these two groups of countries.|$|R

40|$|A {{series of}} cermet powders of {{composition}} NixCo(1 -x) O-YSZ were synthesized for testing as cermet anode materials for SOFCs. The Co is found by powder XRD to become {{incorporated into the}} crystal lattice of the NiO, thus forming a true alloyed material. SEM and EDS results show two types of particles upon sintering to 1380 oC: small, amorphous particles of YSZ and large, crystalline particles of nickel. 	The electrochemical oxidation of hydrogen on a cermet anode composed of Ni 0. 7 Co 0. 3 O-YSZ was investigated using a series of many button cells. Through EIS data, cyclic voltammetry data, the <b>exchange</b> <b>current</b> densities for these button cells were determined. Although a relatively large variation was found (expected {{to be due to}} microstructural variation) the average values for both methods of measurement is in good agreement in hydrogen. 	Following reduction in pure hydrogen, the fuel was changed to a mixture with high concentration of H 2 S. It was found that a concentration of 10 % H 2 S/H 2 produced a sudden change in anode microstructure and resulted in loss of <b>exchange</b> <b>current</b> density. Lowering the amount of H 2 S in the initial fuel feed, which allowed for a more gradual microstructural change, allowed the cell to eventually function at concentrations in excess of 10 % H 2 S/H 2. It was determined by OCV values in various concentrations of H 2 S/H 2 that hydrogen is the predominant fuel of choice, even if H 2 S is available. Following electrochemical testing, slow cooling in a 10 % H 2 S/H 2 mixture following produced metal sulfide spheres, as determined by SEM and EDS. 	Investigation in hydrocarbon, alcohol and biodiesel fuels was then undertaken to test the fuel variability of the given cermet anode material. Methane containing 10 % H 2 S was found to have increased <b>exchange</b> <b>current</b> density relative to poisoned hydrogen. Ethane and biodiesel experienced no increase in <b>exchange</b> <b>current</b> density, but a lengthening of the functional lifetime of the cell was observed, indicating reduced carbon poisoning. Methanol is a promising oxygen-containing SOFC fuel since it produced <b>exchange</b> <b>current</b> density <b>values</b> larger than hydrogen, and showed no evidence of coke formation by post-mortem SEM. 	Since oxygen-containing fuels are known to decompose in the gas phase at typical SOFC operating temperatures, the performance in a mixture of various CO/H 2 fuels was then investigated. The Ni 0. 7 Co 0. 3 O-YSZ cermet anode gave higher <b>exchange</b> <b>current</b> density <b>values</b> for low ratio of CO/H 2 fuels in the range 20 / 80 and 30 / 70 compared to pure H 2. This is the first example of a Ni-based anode providing higher performance with a CO/H 2 mixed fuel than for a pure H 2 fuel. Finally, continuous running of a cell with fuel ratio 25 / 75 CO/H 2 for 7 days produced <b>exchange</b> <b>current</b> density <b>values,</b> which were observed to increase significantly above the values for pure H 2 during days 1 - 4 followed by deterioration below the value for hydrogen on subsequent days...|$|R

Pyroprocessing has been selected to recover uranium from the scrap produced {{in the manufacture of}} this novel fuel type. Electrorefining, the main separation process of pyroprocessing, is modeled through a novel approach using corrosion theory. To use corrosion theory, knowledge of uranium polarization and kinetic parameters such as Tafel constant, transfer coefficient and <b>exchange</b> <b>current</b> density are required. Uranium polarization was investigated at five temperatures and three scan rates in both the anodic and cathodic directions. Anodic polarization of uranium revealed complex behavior caused by a buildup of a film-like material. This material was identified as a precipitate, K 2 UCl 5, which forms as U 3 + ion concentration exceeds a solubility limit in the diffusion layer adjacent to the electrode surface. The presence of the film material on the anode caused the polarization to experience reduced current density and a passive region of overpotential where current density was independent of overpotential. At large overpotentials, 3 ̆e 250 mV, active dissolution behavior was observed. The temperature dependence of the polarization behavior was examined and supports the conclusion that precipitation of K 2 UCl 5 is the cause for the behavior. ^ Kinetic parameters were obtained from polarization data taken carefully in the pre-Tafel region to avoid film formation interference. The Oldham-Mansfeld method was used to analyze the data and obtain polarization resistance, Tafel constant, transfer coefficient and <b>exchange</b> <b>current</b> density <b>values</b> of high precision. The data were compared to the values available in the literature. Tafel constant values agreed reasonably well, while <b>exchange</b> <b>current</b> density did not. Errors in the methodology used in the literature to produce the <b>exchange</b> <b>current</b> density <b>values</b> were identified as the potential cause of the disagreement. ^ The complex uranium polarization behavior observed in the experimental work was modeled empirically and the empirical polarization model implemented in an electrorefiner model constructed in MatLab using corrosion theory. The model was compared to data obtained by experiment at laboratory-scale. The comparison demonstrated that the empirical polarization model developed is a good first approximation of the electrochemical behavior of the system, but a physically meaningful model should be developed in the future to better elucidate the chemistry in the system. ...|$|R

Under this approach, the effective exchange rate can be calculated as a ratio of the normalized <b>exchange</b> <b>value</b> of currency against the US dollar to the normalized <b>exchange</b> <b>value</b> of the benchmark currency basket against the US dollar. Normalized exchange rate refers to the <b>current</b> <b>exchange</b> rate divided by the exchange rate against the US dollar in the base year, which effectively scales up the exchange rate of a [...] "small value" [...] currency like the Japanese yen, worth a small fraction of a dollar, and scales down the exchange rate of a [...] "big value" [...] currency like the British pound, worth much more than a dollar. Thus, all standardized or normalized currencies in the base year are worth US$1 in the base year. The US dollar is used for convenience, but, in principle, any other currency could be used instead without affecting the results. The benchmark currency basket is a GDP-weighted basket of the major fully convertible currencies of the world. Since GDP data are available with a lag, the GDP weights used in Ho are GDPs dated two years ago.

The other part of the value of this particular commodity was labour that was not paid to the worker—unpaid labour. This unpaid labour was retained by the owner of the means of production. In capitalist society, the capitalist owns the means of production and therefore the unpaid labour is retained by the capitalist as rent or as profit.
