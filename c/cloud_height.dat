40|$|To {{investigate}} {{the contribution of}} the roughness or unevenness of cloud top surfaces upon solar radiation, the <b>cloud</b> top <b>heights</b> of the stratocumulus clouds over the ocean were measured by means of the stereophotographic method using an aircraft over Wakasa Bay in the Japan Sea and around Amami Islands in the Pacific Ocean during the winter monsoon seasons of 1989, 1990 and 1991. <b>Cloud</b> top <b>heights</b> were photographed by a motor-driven camera which was fixed pointing downward at {{the central part of the}} aircraft fuselage floor. As a result, it was found that there were a fine structure of the periodic roughness of several hundred meters and an undulation of relatively longer cycles of several kilometers of <b>cloud</b> top <b>heights.</b> Furthermore, the relationship between the horizontal scale and <b>cloud</b> top <b>height</b> difference, and reflectance of stratocumulus clouds was discussed...|$|R
50|$|<b>Cloud</b> <b>height</b> {{is often}} {{related to the}} {{intensity}} of precipitation generated by a cloud: deeper clouds tend to produce more intense rainfall. For instance, cumulonimbus clouds can develop vertically through {{a substantial part of}} the troposphere and often result in thunderstorms with lightning and heavy showers. By contrast, very thin clouds (such as cirrus clouds) do not generate any precipitation at the surface of the Earth.|$|E
5000|$|Storm {{intensity}} quantification: Another {{advantage of}} IC detection {{is that the}} flash rate (number per minute) {{is proportional to the}} 5th power of the convective velocity of the updrafts in the thundercloud. This non-linear response means that a small change in <b>cloud</b> <b>height,</b> hardly observable on radar, would be accompanied by a large change in flash rate. For example, a hardly noticeable 10% increase in <b>cloud</b> <b>height</b> (a measure of storm severity) would have a 60% change in total flash rate, which is easily observed. “Total lightning” is both the generally invisible (in daylight) IC flashes that stay within the cloud as well as the generally visible CG flashes that can be seen extending from cloud base to ground. Because most of the total lightning is from IC flashes, this ability to quantify storm intensity occurs mostly through detection of IC discharges. Lightning detectors that sense only low frequency energy detect only IC flashes that are nearby, so they are relatively inefficient for predicting microbursts and quantifying convective intensity.|$|E

40|$|A newly {{developed}} daytime cloud property retrieval algorithm, FAME-C (Freie Universität Berlin AATSR MERIS Cloud), is presented. Synergistic observations from the Advanced Along-Track Scanning Radiometer (AATSR) and the Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS), both {{mounted on the}} polar-orbiting Environmental Satellite (Envisat), are used for cloud screening. For cloudy pixels two main steps are carried out in a sequential form. First, a cloud optical and microphysical property retrieval is performed using an AATSR near-infrared and visible channel. Cloud phase, cloud optical thickness, and effective radius are retrieved, and subsequently cloud water path is computed. Second, two <b>cloud</b> top <b>height</b> products are retrieved based on independent techniques. For cloud top temperature, measurements in the AATSR infrared channels are used, while for cloud top pressure, measurements in the MERIS oxygen-A absorption channel are used. Results from the cloud optical and microphysical property retrieval serve as input for the two <b>cloud</b> top <b>height</b> retrievals. Introduced here are the AATSR and MERIS forward models and auxiliary data needed in FAME-C. Also, the optimal estimation method, which provides uncertainty estimates of the retrieved property on a pixel basis, is presented. Within {{the frame of the}} European Space Agency (ESA) Climate Change Initiative (CCI) project, the first global cloud property retrievals have been conducted for the years 2007 – 2009. For this time period, verification efforts are presented, comparing, for four selected regions around the globe, FAME-C cloud optical and microphysical properties to cloud optical and microphysical properties derived from measurements of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on the Terra satellite. The results show a reasonable agreement between the cloud optical and microphysical property retrievals. Biases are generally smallest for marine stratocumulus clouds: − 0. 28, 0. 41 μm and − 0. 18 g m − 2 for cloud optical thickness, effective radius and cloud water path, respectively. This is also true for the root-mean-square deviation. Furthermore, both <b>cloud</b> top <b>height</b> products are compared to <b>cloud</b> top <b>heights</b> derived from ground-based cloud radars located at several Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) sites. FAME-C mostly shows an underestimation of <b>cloud</b> top <b>heights</b> when compared to radar observations. The lowest bias of − 0. 3 km is found for AATSR <b>cloud</b> top <b>heights</b> for single-layer <b>clouds,</b> while the highest bias of − 3. 0 km is found for AATSR <b>cloud</b> top <b>heights</b> for multilayer <b>clouds.</b> Variability is low for MERIS <b>cloud</b> top <b>heights</b> for low-level <b>clouds,</b> and high for MERIS <b>cloud</b> top <b>heights</b> for mid-level and high-level single-layer clouds, as well as for both AATSR and MERIS <b>cloud</b> top <b>heights</b> for multilayer <b>clouds...</b>|$|R
