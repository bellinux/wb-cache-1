40|$|The present paper {{deals with}} the {{fracture}} analysis of the frame {{of a very large}} pump. The complex geometry of the structure as well as loading conditions were responsible of premature fracture failures localized in the neighborhood of the bolted connection between the <b>column</b> <b>pipe</b> and the basement plate. Retrofitting solutions and appropriate countermeasures were proposed after long lasting hydrodynamic and structural analyses that needed to account for very strict operational and time constraints. The fracture strength as well as the vibration behavior of the structure were considered taking advantage of both numerical FE calculations and experimental insitu measurements. The parallel numerical and experimental analyses leaded to a set of modifications of the structure hereunder described in detail. The integration among experimental and theoretical results concurred to obtain a suitable solution for a quite complex case study because it allowed improving aspects related to both the strength and the loading conditions of the structure...|$|E

With each bounce, a pressure relief valve {{at the top of}} the <b>pipe</b> <b>column</b> releases some of the compressed air making each successive bounce smaller until the carriage reaches the loading platform.|$|R

Through large-scale analysis software ANSYS, this paper analyzes the steel column base by finite element numerical simulation analysis,and discuss the fracture behavior of steel <b>pipe</b> <b>column</b> and fillet weld in different thickness, axial compression ratio and different sectional area. The results showed that, the section of most likely break focus on the ends {{and in the middle of}} the steel <b>pipe</b> <b>column</b> and fillet weld,and with the increase of thickness, cracking capability of the steel <b>pipe</b> <b>column</b> and fillet weld first increased and then decreased, and axial compression ratio of the specimen has little effect for cracking capability,and with the increase of sectional area, the less prone to fracture of the steel <b>pipe</b> <b>column</b> and fillet weld. ...|$|R

A {{guide post}} {{is used to}} {{separate}} pavement from roadway and widely used for car parks, pedestrian safe zones and refuge islands {{as well as for}} asset protection such as <b>columns,</b> <b>pipes</b> from impacts [1]. But it is very easily hit hard by cars. This study uses the contradiction matrix in the TRIZ method, 39 engineering parameters, and 40 inventive and innovative principles to identify the areas of improvement to address the above problems. When the guide post is hit by a vehicle, a flexible structure located between base and cylinder can curve and spring back to original position, and therefore endures more powerful hit. In addition, the spring back function lets the guide post automatically return to original position to alert drivers. This structure will has more durable service life, so, {{it can be used to}} reduce the maintenance times, and cost for the users...|$|R

2500|$|With each major {{earthquake}} comes {{new understanding}} {{of the way in}} which buildings respond to them. Advances in the technology associated with testing systems, design and seismic modeling software, structural connections, structural forms, and seismic force resisting systems have accelerated dramatically since Northridge. There is an array of building forms and systems that are no longer legal to build. [...] An example is the previously popular [...] "soft-story" [...] multifamily apartments. These buildings typically look like a three-story box on a narrow lot, where the upper two floors overhang the lower floor and are supported on <b>pipe</b> <b>columns</b> so cars can be parked underneath. Because the ground level is soft relative to the upper floors, the upper portion can sway and fall onto the carport below. Today, no wood floors are allowed to extend more than an additional 15% beyond the shear wall or other lateral-load resisting element of the floor below. This typically results in overhangs not exceeding three or four feet, compared to the 20 to 40 feet that were previously built. If an architect still wants this type of design, the structural engineer may specify that the previously used <b>pipe</b> <b>column</b> design be replaced with a laterally stiff steel [...] "moment frame". This can also mitigate the problem of the soft-story structure by stiffening the soft ground floor.|$|R

Specifically, artificial ground is built at the height that does not inter-fere with existing sheds using sockets modularized with column-beam joints of an outer diaphragm type shown in Fig. 2. Then, the ground is jacked down to a specified height after removing existing sheds, and finally it is jointed with columns by filling in the gaps between columns and sockets with mortar or concrete.
