2500|$|Accordingly, a {{standard}} Mk I K9834 (the 48th production Spitfire) {{was taken off}} the production line and modified for the attempt on the World Speed Record. All military equipment was removed and the hinged gun panels, radio door and flare chute opening were replaced with removable panels. A special [...] "sprint" [...] version of the Merlin II, running on a special [...] "racing fuel" [...] of gasoline, benzol and methanol, {{with a small amount of}} tetraethyl lead was able to generate 2,100hp (1,565kW) for short periods. This drove a Watts <b>coarse</b> <b>pitch,</b> four bladed wood propeller of [...] in diameter. Cooling the more powerful engine was achieved using a pressurised water system. This required a deeper radiator inside a lengthened duct which extended to the trailing edge of the starboard wing. A larger diameter oil cooler was fitted under the port wing. The wingspan was reduced to 33ft 9 in (10.28 m) and the wingtips were rounded.|$|E

The group joined the Forces Aériennes Françaises Libres in June 1940. They arrived in Britain in mid-July.|$|E
5000|$|Several {{designs were}} tried, {{including}} a small bladder of pressurized {{air in the}} propeller hub providing the necessary force to resist a spring that would drive the blades from fine pitch (take-off) to <b>coarse</b> <b>pitch</b> (level cruising). At a suitable airspeed a disk {{on the front of}} the spinner would press sufficiently on the bladder's air-release valve to relieve the pressure and allow the spring to drive the propeller to <b>coarse</b> <b>pitch.</b> These [...] "pneumatic" [...] propellers were fitted on the DH88 Comet aircraft, winner of the famed long distance 1934 Mac Robertson race and in the Caudron C.460 winner of the 1936 National Air Races, flown by Michel Detroyat. Use of these pneumatic propellers required presetting the propeller to fine pitch prior to take-off. This was done by pressurizing the bladder with a bicycle pump, hence the whimsical nickname Gonfleurs d'hélices (prop inflater boy) given to the aircraft ground mechanics in France up to this day.|$|E
50|$|Finer and <b>coarser</b> <b>pitch</b> cables {{are also}} available. For instance, the {{high-speed}} ATA interface cable used for computer hard disk interfaces ULTRA-ATA has 0.025-inch (0.64-mm) pitch. Finer pitches, {{as small as}} 0.3 mm, are found in portable electronic equipment, such as laptops; however, portable electronic equipment usually uses flexible flat cables (FFC).|$|R

This works for both fine and <b>coarse</b> <b>pitches,</b> and also produces an approximate 75 percent thread.|$|R
25|$|Gashing is a {{machining}} process used {{to rough out}} <b>coarse</b> <b>pitched</b> gears and sprockets. It is commonly used on worm wheels before hobbing, but also used on internal and external spur gears, bevel gears, helical gears, and gear racks. The process is performed on gashers or universal milling machines, {{especially in the case}} of worm wheels. After gashing the gear or sprocket is finished via hobbing, shaping, or shaving.|$|R
5000|$|The basic {{principles}} of the ISO metric screw thread are defined in international standard ISO 68-1 and preferred combinations of diameter and pitch are listed in ISO 261. The smaller subset of diameter and pitch combinations commonly used in screws, nuts and bolts is given in ISO 262. The most commonly used pitch value for each diameter is the <b>coarse</b> <b>pitch.</b> For some diameters, one or two additional fine pitch variants are also specified, for special applications such as threads in thin-walled pipes. ISO metric screw threads are designated by the letter M followed by the major diameter of the thread in millimeters (e.g. M8). If the thread does not use the normal <b>coarse</b> <b>pitch</b> (e.g. 1.25 mm {{in the case of}} M8), then the pitch in millimeters is also appended with a multiplication sign (e.g. [...] "M8×1" [...] if the screw thread has an outer diameter of 8 mm and advances by 1 mm per 360° rotation).|$|E
50|$|A {{centrifugal}} {{twisting force}} is experienced by any asymmetrical spinning object. In the propeller it acts to twist the blades {{to a fine}} pitch. The aerodynamic centre of pressure is therefore usually arranged to be slightly forward of its mechanical centreline, creating a twisting moment towards <b>coarse</b> <b>pitch</b> and counteracting the centrifugal moment. However in a high-speed dive the aerodynamic force can change significantly and the moments can become unbalanced.|$|E
50|$|The common V-thread {{standards}} (ISO 261 and Unified Thread Standard) {{include a}} <b>coarse</b> <b>pitch</b> {{and a fine}} pitch for each major diameter. For example, -13 belongs to the UNC series (Unified National Coarse) and -20 belongs to the UNF series (Unified National Fine). Similarly, ISO261 M10 (10mm (398 thou) nominal outer diameter) has a coarse thread version at 1.25mm pitch (49 thou) and a fine thread version at 1 mm (39 thou) pitch.|$|E

5000|$|A ground-adjustable {{propeller}} is {{a simple}} type of aircraft variable-pitch propeller where the blade angle can be adjusted between pre-set limits of fine and <b>coarse</b> <b>pitch.</b> [...] As its name implies, a ground-adjustable propeller may be adjusted only when the aircraft {{is on the ground}} and when the engine is not running. To adjust the propeller, the blades are loosened in the hub, a new angle set and then the hub tightened.|$|E

5000|$|A metric ISO {{screw thread}} is {{designated}} by the letter M followed by {{the value of the}} nominal diameter D (Dmaj in the diagram above) and the pitch P, both expressed in millimetres and separated by the multiplication sign, × (e.g., M8×1.25). If the pitch is the normally used [...] "coarse" [...] pitch listed in ISO 261 or ISO 262, it can be omitted (e.g., M8). Tolerance classes defined in ISO 965-1 can be appended to these designations, if required (e.g., M500- 6g in external threads). If, for instance, only M20 is given then it is <b>coarse</b> <b>pitch</b> thread.|$|E
5000|$|The {{history of}} milling cutters is intimately {{bound up with}} that of milling machines. Milling evolved from rotary filing, {{so there is a}} {{continuum}} of development between the earliest milling cutters known, such as that of Jacques de Vaucanson from about the 1760s or 1770s, through the cutters of the milling pioneers of the 1810s through 1850s (Whitney, North, Johnson, Nasmyth, and others), to the cutters developed by Joseph R. Brown of Brown & Sharpe in the 1860s, which were regarded as a break from the past for their large step forward in tooth coarseness and for the geometry that could take successive sharpenings without losing the clearance (rake, side rake, and so on). De Vries (1910) reported, [...] "This revolution in the science of milling cutters took place in the States about the year 1870, and became generally known in Europe during the Exhibition in Vienna in 1873. However strange it may seem now that this type of cutter has been universally adopted and its undeniable superiority to the old European type is no longer doubted, it was regarded very distrustfully and European experts were very reserved in expressing their judgment. Even we ourselves can remember that after the <b>coarse</b> <b>pitched</b> cutter had been introduced, certain very clever and otherwise shrewd experts and engineers regarded the new cutting tool with many a shake of the head. When, however, the Worlds Exhibition at Philadelphia in 1876, exhibited to European experts a universal and many-sided application of the <b>coarse</b> <b>pitched</b> milling cutter which exceeded even the most sanguine expectations, the most far-seeing engineers were then convinced of the immense advantages which the application of the new type opened up for the metalworking industry, and from that time onwards the American type advanced, slowly at first, but later on with rapid strides".|$|R

40|$|The {{deformation}} {{behavior and}} failure mechanisms of parallel-aligned, horseshoe-patterned, stretchable conductors encapsulated in a polymer substrate were investigated by numerical and experimental analyses. A design guideline for the optimal pitch between the conductors was proposed through numerical analysis, and two extreme cases-fine and coarse pitches-were investigated by in situ experimental observations. The experimental results {{demonstrate that the}} stretchable conductors enable elongation up to 123 and 135 % without metal rupture for the fine and <b>coarse</b> <b>pitches,</b> respectively. The difference between these numbers is much smaller (12 %) than expected from the simulations. It is found and confirmed by a modified simulation model {{that the reason for}} this is interfacial delamination, the onset of which depends on the pitch of the conductors and occurs before metal rupture of the conductors. The definition of 'stretchability of the electronic interconnects' is discussed based on the facts that two different failure mechanisms occur: interfacial delamination and metal rupture...|$|R

The usefulness of this invention received mixed reviews from the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME).

50|$|The {{engine is}} {{designed}} to operate at a constant speed, no matter the thrust output—a characteristic permitted by the Astafan's use of precise fuel metering and fan blade pitch adjustment. To control the engine, the pilot first sets the speed lever, which adjusts fuel flow {{in proportion to the}} selected engine speed. Then the pilot moves the thrust lever (analogous to a throttle), actuating the fan pitch piston by way of a mechanical linkage and hydraulic valve, and varying the blade pitch. In response, the speed governor holds engine speed steady by adjusting fuel delivery to the combustor. The control system also monitors turbine temperature and adjusts blade pitch (and therefore engine load) to maintain it within the preferred range of 350 °C to 450 °C. Additionally, the system automatically protects against excessive fuel delivery or unusual changes in blade pitch. Using the thrust lever, pilots can start an Astafan in fine pitch (for minimal resistive torque), select takeoff (<b>coarse)</b> <b>pitch,</b> feather the fan, or even reverse the fan pitch in flight (with the fan providing reverse thrust in lieu of conventional reversers).|$|E

50|$|In this {{mechanism}} the reversing rod {{is controlled by}} a screw and nut, worked by a wheel in the cab. The nut either operates on the reversing rod directly or through a lever, as above. The screw and nut may be cut with a double thread and a <b>coarse</b> <b>pitch</b> to move the mechanism as quickly as possible. The wheel is fitted with a locking lever to prevent creep {{and there is an}} indicator to show the percentage of cutoff in use. This method of altering the cutoff offers finer control than the sector lever, but it has the disadvantage of slow operation. It is most suitable for long-distance passenger engines where frequent changes of cutoff are not required and where fine adjustments offer the most benefit. On locomotives fitted with Westinghouse air brake equipment and Stephenson valve gear, it was common to use the screw housing as an air cylinder, with the nut extended to form a piston.

40|$|Ball Grid Array (BGA) {{packages}} offer increased I/O density {{with relatively}} <b>coarse</b> <b>pitches,</b> {{when compared to}} peripheral-leaded SMT packages of the same I/O count. Although the question “Does {{the lack of a}} compliant lead in the BGA solder joint reduce reliability? ” continues to be asked, there is evidence of steady industry acceptance of this technology. Micro-BGA technology, one example of chip-scale packaging, is an extension of this technology which allows designers to approach multi-chip module densities while continuing to employ surface mount assembly techniques. The reliability concern, however, is exaggerated since the volume of solder decreases with the finer pitch micro-BGA devices. At the same time, increased use of surface mount on flex circuits, particularly in small form factor products, is demonstrating the ability of flex to mitigate the stress created in a solder joint during thermal excursions. This paper summarizes work being done at Teledyne Electronic Technologies on assemblies employing microBGA packages on both rigid and flexible substrates. These assemblies include BGA pitches down to 0. 5 mm and pad diameters down to 0. 3 mm. Solder joint fatigue and/or cracking as a potential failure mechanism is examined, and reliability analysis data is presented as part of an overall assessment of the microBGA technology for use in products in the medical and communications markets.

5000|$|As the war progressed, {{aircraft}} designers demanded ever-increasing {{amounts of}} power. Inline engines {{were able to}} meet this demand by improving their upper rev limits, which meant more power. Improvements in valve timing, ignition systems, and lightweight materials made these higher revs possible, {{and by the end}} of the war the average engine had increased from 1,200 rpm to 2,000. The rotary was not able to do the same due to the drag of the rotating cylinders through the air. For instance, if an early-war model of 1,200 rpm increased its revs to only 1,400, the drag on the cylinders increased 36%, as air drag increases with the square of velocity. At lower rpm, drag could simply be ignored, but as the rev count rose, the rotary was putting more and more power into spinning the engine, with less remaining to provide useful thrust through the propeller.One clever attempt to rescue the design, in a similar manner to Redrup's British [...] "reactionless" [...] engine concept, was made by Siemens AG. The crankcase (with the propeller still fastened directly to the front of it) and cylinders spun counterclockwise at 900 rpm, as seen externally from a [...] "nose on" [...] viewpoint, while the crankshaft and other internal parts spun clockwise at the same speed, so the set was effectively running at 1800 rpm. This was achieved by the use of bevel gearing at the rear of the crankcase, resulting in the eleven-cylindered Siemens-Halske Sh.III, with less drag and less net torque. Used on several late war types, notably the Siemens-Schuckert D.IV fighter, the new engine’s low running speed, coupled with large, <b>coarse</b> <b>pitched</b> propellers that sometimes had four blades (as the SSW D.IV used), gave types powered by it outstanding rates of climb, with some examples of the late production Sh.IIIa powerplant even said to be delivering as much as 240 hp.|$|R
40|$|Behavioral {{adaption}} to {{a changing}} environment {{is critical for}} an animal’s survival. How well the brain can modify its functional properties based on experience essentially defines the limits of behavioral adaptation. In adult animals {{the extent to which}} experience shapes brain function has not been fully explored. Moreover, the perceptual consequences of experience-induced changes in the brains of adults remain unknown. Here we show that the tonotopic map in the primary auditory cortex of adult rats living with low-level ambient noise underwent a dramatic reorganization. Behaviorally, chronic noise-exposure impaired fine, but not <b>coarse</b> <b>pitch</b> discrimination. When tested in a noisy environment, the noise-exposed rats performed as well as in a quiet environment whereas the control rats performed poorly. This suggests that noise-exposed animals had adapted to living in a noisy environment. Behavioral pattern analyses revealed that stress or distraction engendered by the noisy background could not account for the poor performance of the control rats in a noisy environment. A reorganized auditory map may therefore have served as the neural substrate for the consistent performance of the noise-exposed rats in a noisy environment...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} a plain hole on the fatigue {{properties}} of a body undergoing uniaxial loading is a well-studied area. However, for the case of threaded holes that are not being used together with a bolt, little {{can be found in}} the literature. In this project, stress concentration factors, Ktn, for threaded holes, following the ISO metric standard, have been calculated using finite element models in ANSYS. Based on theser esults, estimations of the fatigue notch factor, Ktf, for the threaded holes were derived. The magnitude of Ktf depends on how the notch sensitivity index, q, is being determined. In this project, both Neuber’s and Peterson’s formulas were used as estimates of q and a comparison between the two methods was made. The stress concentration factors for the threaded holes were significantly higher than the corresponding stress concentration factors for plain holes. As the size of the hole and the surrounding body was increased, Ktn decreased. In the fatigue analysis, Peterson’s formula predicted higher values of the fatigue notch factor compared to Neuber’s and could therefore be useful in design purposes. Furthermore, the reduction in fatigue strength for the threaded holes, compared to the plain holes, was calculated. These results showed that the percentage decrease in fatigue strength for threaded holes was approximately the same, regardless if Neuber’s or Peterson’s estimation of q was used. The reduction in fatigue strength for threaded holes with a <b>coarse</b> <b>pitch,</b> compared to plain holes, varied from about 16 % for the smallest diameter tested(M 6) to about 10 % for the biggest (M 68). The corresponding reduction for threaded holes with a fine pitch varied from about 14 % for the smallest diameter (M 6) to about 9 % for the biggest (M 64). As the size of the hole and the surrounding body was increased, the threads’ effect on the fatigue strength decreased...|$|E
