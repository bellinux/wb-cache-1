40|$|Background: Cisplatin {{is one of}} {{the most}} ototoxic {{chemotherapy}} drugs, resulting in a permanent and irreversible hearing loss in up to 50 % of patients. Cisplatin and gentamicin are thought to damage hearing through a common mechanism, involving reactive oxygen species in the inner ear. Aspirin has been shown to minimise gentamicin-induced ototoxicity. We, therefore, tested the hypothesis that aspirin could also reduce ototoxicity from cisplatin-based chemotherapy. Methods: A total of 94 patients receiving cisplatin-based chemotherapy for multiple cancer types were recruited into a phase II, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial and randomised in a ratio of 1 : 1 to receive aspirin 975 mg tid and omeprazole 20 mg od, or matched placebos from the day before, to 2 days after, their cisplatin dose(s), for each treatment cycle. Patients underwent pure tone audiometry before and at 7 and 90 days after their final cisplatin dose. The primary end-point was <b>combined</b> <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> (cHL), the summed hearing loss at 6 kHz and 8 kHz, in both ears. Results: Although aspirin was well tolerated, it did not protect hearing in patients receiving cisplatin (p-value = 0. 233, 20 % one-sided level of significance). In the aspirin arm, patients demonstrated mean cHL of 49 dB (standard deviation [SD] 61. 41) following cisplatin compared with placebo patients who demonstrated mean cHL of 36 dB (SD 50. 85). Women had greater average hearing loss than men, and patients treated for head and neck malignancy experienced the greatest cHL. Conclusions: Aspirin did not protect from cisplatin-related ototoxicity. Cisplatin and gentamicin may therefore have distinct ototoxic mechanisms, or cisplatin-induced ototoxicity may be refractory to the aspirin regimen used here. <br/...|$|E

We found that the proteins are in close enough proximity to form complexes and that these complexes preassemble at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Defects in any one of the three USH proteins disrupt formation and trafficking of the complex and result in diminished levels of the other proteins, generalized trafficking defects and ER stress that triggers apoptosis.

DESIGN: Prospective longitudinal follow-up study {{within the framework of}} a structured post-ECMO follow-up program. SETTING: Outpatient clinic of a level III university hospital. RESULTS: Tone audiometry was performed by standardized protocol in 136 children aged 5 to 12 years. <b>Hearing</b> <b>loss</b> was considered clinically significant when > 20 dB. Hearing was normal in 75. 7 % of children. Five children (3. 7 %) had bilateral sensorineural or <b>combined</b> <b>hearing</b> loss; 3 of them received special audiological care (2. 2 % of total sample). Of the 24 children with congenital diaphragmatic hernia, 19 (79. 2 %) had normal hearing; and only 2 (8. 3 %) had mild SNHL, unilateral in one of them. Follow-up at 24 months of age had shown normal verbal and non-verbal developmental scores. Language development and intelligence median (range) scores at 5 years of age were also normal: receptive language development 104 (55 - 133); syntactical development 104 (68 - 132); and lexical development 101 (50 - 141) for 89 children; intelligence quotient was 104 (68 - 132) in 106 children.

40|$|AbstractUsher {{syndrome}} (USH), clinically and genetically heterogeneous, is {{the leading}} genetic cause of <b>combined</b> <b>hearing</b> and vision <b>loss.</b> USH is classified into three types, based on the hearing and vestibular symptoms observed in patients. Sixteen loci {{have been reported to}} be involved in the occurrence of USH and atypical USH. Among them, twelve have been identified as causative genes and one as a modifier gene. Studies on the proteins encoded by these USH genes suggest that USH proteins interact among one another and function in multiprotein complexes in vivo. Although their exact functions remain enigmatic in the retina, USH proteins are required for the development, maintenance and function of hair bundles, which are the primary mechanosensitive structure of inner ear hair cells. Despite the unavailability of a cure, progress has been made to develop effective treatments for this disease. In this review, we focus on the most recent discoveries in the field with an emphasis on USH genes, protein complexes and functions in various tissues as well as progress toward therapeutic development for USH...|$|R

40|$|The <b>combined</b> <b>hearing</b> {{and visual}} {{impairments}} associated with congenital deafblindness severely diminish {{access to information}} from the environment and impede opportunities for interaction and development of symbolic language. Congenital deafblindness involves the impairment of both vision and hearing {{to such an extent}} that an individual cannot function as someone who is deaf or as someone who is blind. The term congenital deafblindness covers a spectrum of combinations of varying degrees of vision and <b>hearing</b> <b>loss.</b> A total absence of vision and hearing lies at one end, while at the other end, residual vision or hearing, or some residual facility in both senses, is available. The degree of impairment varies within this population, which precludes generalising as regards successful remediation strategies. Concomitant physical or cognitive impairments will bring further challenges. People with congenital deafblindness who are able to use their residual sight or residual hearing are at a relative advantage, availing of communicative options that make use of the residual sense. Nonetheless, individuals who present with impairments within the spectrum of <b>combined</b> <b>hearing</b> and vision <b>loss</b> are at a great disadvantage when developing communication. Educational strategies for promoting communication and language in this population generally advocate an individualised approach (see McInnes and Treffrey, 1982; Van Dijk, 1986; Nafstad and Rødbroe, 1999; Chen and Downing, 2006). Many different strategies may be utilised when supporting language acquisition. Such methods involve the use of sign systems and tangible objects of references. Examples of sign systems are formal sign language, adaptive signs and natural gestures. Tangible objects of reference are those that are used to refer to other objects, people, places and activities. They can be concrete representations, for example a spoon used to refer to dinner time, or abstract representations, for example an arbitrary piece of fabric that is used to refer to a day of the week. Stereotypic behaviours are commonly observed in individuals who are deafblind. Idiosyncratic or stereotypic behaviours may appear unconstructive but could prove beneficial to developing communication. A type of echolalia (using signs instead of speech) and imitation rituals are sometimes exhibited by individuals who are deafblind, and may be significant in efforts to communicate for this population...|$|R

In another word the mean age of <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> detection decreased as the <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> increases(in moderate- profound <b>hearing</b> <b>loss)</b> (P< 0. 01). Conclusion: among the refrence sources for refering children with <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> the least refering was related to physicians. Adversly the mean age of doubting and detection of <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> increased in children with family history of <b>hearing</b> <b>loss.</b> (P< 0. 01). Meanwhile no relationship was detected between the age of diagnosis of <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> and the number of deaf members in the family(P< 0. 02) ...|$|R

An injection of {{salicylic acid}} induced <b>hearing</b> <b>loss,</b> while an injection of zinc reversed the <b>hearing</b> <b>loss.</b> An injection of magnesium in the zinc-deficient rats did not reverse the induced <b>hearing</b> <b>loss.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Hearing</b> <b>loss</b> is {{classified}} as mild, moderate, severe or profound. Pure-tone audiometry for air conduction thresholds at 500, 1000 and 2000 Hz is traditionally used to classify the degree of <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> in each ear. Normal hearing thresholds {{are considered to be}} 25 dB sensitivity, though it has been proposed that this threshold is too high, and that 15 dB (about half as loud) is more typical. Mild <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> is thresholds of 25-45 dB; moderate <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> is thresholds of 45-65 dB; severe <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> is thresholds of 65-85 dB; and profound <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> thresholds are greater than 85 dB.|$|R
