5|$|A movie <b>conclusion</b> <b>to</b> {{the series}} was {{announced}} in April 2011, just a month after {{the series was}} announced.

5|$|After Thermopylae, all of Boeotia and Attica {{fell to the}} Persian army, which {{captured}} and burnt Athens. However, a larger Allied army fortified the narrow Isthmus of Corinth, protecting the Peloponnesus from Persian conquest. Both sides thus sought a naval victory that might decisively alter {{the course of the}} war. The Athenian general Themistocles succeeded in luring the Persian navy into the narrow Straits of Salamis, where the huge number of Persian ships became disorganised, and were soundly beaten by the Allied fleet. The Allied victory at Salamis prevented a quick <b>conclusion</b> <b>to</b> the invasion, and fearing becoming trapped in Europe, Xerxes retreated to Asia leaving his general Mardonius to finish the conquest with the elite of the army.|$|E

5|$|After the <b>conclusion</b> <b>to</b> her {{feud with}} Jacqueline, Kim made two minor {{pay-per-view}} appearances {{in a short}} feud against Robert Roode, before outlasting nine other competitors in a ten-woman gauntlet match to become the inaugural TNA Women's Knockout Champion on October 14, 2007 at Bound for Glory. She made her first title defense on November 11 at Genesis, where she retained the renamed TNA Women's Knockout Championship by defeating Roxxi Laveaux, ODB, and Angel Williams. Kim then began a feud with Awesome Kong over the championship. Their first encounter occurred on December 2 at Turning Point, which resulted in Kim retaining the title due to a disqualification by Kong. On January 6, 2008 at Final Resolution, Kim defeated Kong in an acclaimed second encounter to retain the championship under no disqualification rules. In their third and final encounter in the main event of the January 10 episode of TNA Impact!, Kong defeated Kim to win the TNA Women's Knockout Championship, however also suffering a concussion {{at the hands of}} Kong after being powerbombed in the ring three times.|$|E
5|$|Although {{not known}} as a {{reformer}} before his appointment, Robert returned in 1051 from Rome, where {{he had gone to}} be confirmed by the papacy, and opposed the king's choice for Bishop of London {{on the grounds that the}} candidate was not suitable. Robert's attempts to recover church property that had been appropriated by Earl Godwin contributed to the quarrel between the earl and the king. When Godwin returned to England in 1052 Robert was outlawed and exiled, following which King Edward appointed Stigand to the archbishopric. The appointment was either a reward from Godwin for Stigand's support during the conflict with Edward or a reward from King Edward for successfully negotiating a peaceful <b>conclusion</b> <b>to</b> the crisis in 1052. Stigand was the first non-monk to be appointed to either English archbishopric since before the days of Dunstan (archbishop from 959 to 988).|$|E
5|$|At first, {{the game}} was titled Parasite, and {{was meant to be}} {{unrelated}} to the Infinity series, but when development began in May 2003, it was codenamed Project Infinity 3. In September of the same year, they added the subtitle The Age of Infinity. Development was troubled by creative differences between Nakazawa and Uchikoshi; Nakazawa was unhappy with Uchikoshi's idea for the game's ending, and had a different ending in mind, which they were having disagreements over. They also did not have the time to write everything that they had wanted, so they ended up with an ending that Uchikoshi described as only being half-finished. At the time of the game's release, a sequel was planned, which would have included a <b>conclusion</b> <b>to</b> the game's story. In 2013, Uchikoshi looked back on the game, saying that while {{he would have liked to}} rewrite some portions of the scenario that he felt were boring or that did not advance the story much, he would not have changed or added anything in terms of the content of the game; he felt that his ending was still in the story, and still felt happy with it.|$|E
