5|$|After her defeat, Bondfield {{returned}} to her NUGMW post. The TUC, suspicious of her perceived closeness to MacDonald, was cool towards {{her and she was}} not re-elected to the General Council. She remained Labour's <b>candidate</b> <b>at</b> Wallsend; in the general election of 1935 she was again defeated. She never {{returned to}} parliament; she was adopted as the prospective Labour candidate for Reading, but when it became obvious that the election due for 1940 would be delayed indefinitely by war, she resigned her candidacy.|$|E

5|$|Following {{the regular}} season, {{speculation}} surrounded whether Turner Gill would leave Buffalo for another school's head coaching position. He {{was identified as}} a <b>candidate</b> <b>at</b> two schools: Syracuse and Auburn. In neither case was Gill hired; Syracuse opted for New Orleans Saints offensive coordinator Doug Marrone, while Auburn passed him over in favor of Iowa State head coach Gene Chizik, a move that prominent former National Basketball Association (NBA) player, Basketball Hall-of-Famer, and Auburn alumnus Charles Barkley claimed was due to racism. Gill ended up signing a contract extension with Buffalo.|$|E
5|$|Jennings, {{seeking to}} advance his {{political}} career, {{ran for the}} Senate twice, but was defeated in both attempts. In 1825 he was a senate <b>candidate</b> <b>at</b> {{a time when the}} Indiana General Assembly elected the state's senators to Congress. On the first ballot Isaac Blackford came in first, the incumbent governor, William Hendricks, came in second, and Jennings was third. On the fourth ballot Hendricks won the senate seat. In his second attempt Jennings lost to James Noble.|$|E
5|$|After her defeat, Bondfield resumed {{her work}} for NUGMW and was re-elected to the TUC Council. In 1926 she {{supported}} the TUC's decision {{to hold a}} General Strike, and also the decision to call it off after nine days. Following the resignation of Sir Patrick Hastings in June 1926, Bondfield was adopted as the Labour <b>candidate</b> <b>at</b> Wallsend, and won the subsequent by-election with a majority of over 9,000. Meanwhile, she had accepted appointment to the Blanesburgh Committee, which the Conservative government had set up to consider reforms to the system of unemployment benefit. Her private view, that entitlement to benefits should be related to contributions, was not widely shared in the Labour Party or the TUC. When the committee made recommendations along these lines she signed the report, which became {{the basis of the}} Unemployment Insurance Act 1927. Bondfield's association with this legislation permanently shadowed her relationship with the Labour movement.|$|E

5|$|He {{was elected}} to the West Virginia Senate in 1874 and served {{alongside}} R.B. Sherrard and David Pugh, representing the Eleventh Senatorial District. He unsuccessfully ran for election in the Twelfth Senatorial District for a judicial seat in 1883. In 1890, he served as {{the vice president of the}} West Virginia Bar Association from West Virginia's 2nd congressional district. By 1907, he was president of the Mineral County Bar Association, and in 1909 he served on the bar association's Committee on Legal Education. In 1892 Clayton was under consideration as a Democratic candidate for a long term on the Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia, but was not elected as the party's <b>candidate</b> <b>at</b> the state convention.|$|E
5|$|In 1906, Marshall {{declined}} his party's {{nomination to}} run for Congress. He did hint to state party leaders {{that he would be}} interested in running for Indiana governor in the 1908 election. He soon gained the support of several key labor unions, and was endorsed by Louis Ludlow, a reporter for the Indianapolis Star. Despite this support, Marshall was a dark horse <b>candidate</b> <b>at</b> the state convention. Initially, Thomas Taggart, Indiana Democratic Party boss, did not support him because of Marshall's support of prohibition. Taggart wanted the party to nominate anti-prohibitionist Samuel Ralston, but the prohibitionist and anti-Taggart factions united with Marshall's supporters. Taggart swung Ralston's delegates in support of Marshall to oppose L. Ert Slack, a temperance candidate, giving Marshall the votes he needed to win the nomination.|$|E
5|$|In May 1878, Weaver {{accepted}} the Greenback nomination for the House of Representatives in the 6th district. Although Weaver's political career up to then {{had been as}} a staunch Republican, Democrats in the 6th district thought that endorsing him was likely {{the only way to}} defeat Sampson, the incumbent Republican. Since the start of the Civil War, Democrats had been in the minority across Iowa; electoral fusion with Greenbackers represented their best chance to get their candidates into office. Hard-money Democrats objected to the idea, but some were reassured when HenryH. Trimble, a prominent Bloomfield Democrat, assured them that if elected Weaver would align with House Democrats on all issues other than the money question. Democrats declined to endorse any <b>candidate</b> <b>at</b> the 6th district convention, but soft-money leaders in the party circulated their own slate of candidates that included Democrats and Greenbackers. The Greenback–Democrat ticket prevailed, and Weaver was elected with 16,366 votes to Sampson's 14,307.|$|E

5|$|On August 27, 2013, Hickenlooper {{asked the}} Colorado Supreme Court to clarify if a voter had {{to vote for}} recall in order {{to vote for a}} {{replacement}} <b>candidate.</b> <b>At</b> the same time, Libertarian Jan Brooks turned in petitions to be on the ballot against Morse while Democrat Richard Anglund announced his write-in candidacy against Giron. On August 28, the Supreme Court ruled that a voter did not have to vote to recall in order to vote for a replacement, but that the Senators could only be recalled by a majority vote. Secretary of State Gessler announced that Brooks did not have sufficient signatures to qualify for the ballot, leaving only Republican opponents on the ballot.|$|E
5|$|Ebert spent a {{semester}} as a master's {{student in the}} department of English there before attending the University of Cape Town on a Rotary fellowship for a year. He returned from Cape Town to his graduate studies at Illinois for two more semesters and then, after being accepted as a PhD <b>candidate</b> <b>at</b> the University of Chicago, he prepared to move to Chicago. He needed a job to support himself while he worked on his doctorate and so applied to the Chicago Daily News, hoping that, as he had already sold freelance pieces to the Daily News, including an article on the death of writer Brendan Behan, he would be hired by editor Herman Kogan. Instead Kogan referred Ebert to the city editor at the Chicago Sun-Times, Jim Hoge, who hired Ebert as a reporter and feature writer at the Sun-Times in 1966. He attended doctoral classes at the University of Chicago while working as a general reporter at the Sun-Times for a year. After movie critic Eleanor Keane left the Sun-Times in April 1967, editor Robert Zonka gave the job to Ebert. The load of graduate school and being a film critic proved too much, so Ebert left the University of Chicago to focus his energies on film criticism.|$|E
5|$|The UK Independence Party (UKIP) {{candidate}} was chosen via a selection committee, unlike previous mayoral candidate selections {{that had been}} made by London-based party members. The supposed favourite for selection among party members was Suzanne Evans, UKIP Deputy Chairman, former Interim Leader, Welfare Spokesman and candidate for Shrewsbury and Atcham in the 2015 general election. Press such as The Spectator speculated that the decision had been moved to a committee to allow for the selection of national party leader Nigel Farage's preferred candidate, Peter Whittle, Culture Spokesman and candidate for Eltham in the 2015 general election. UKIP claimed that the changed selection process was intended to produce a candidate with the potential for receiving the most votes. Whittle was eventually selected, and announced as the <b>candidate</b> <b>at</b> the UKIP party conference on 26 September 2015. No shortlist was released but others who had stated their intention to stand had included: Alan Craig, former leader of and mayoral candidate in 2008 for the Christian Peoples Alliance, and UKIP candidate for Brent North in the 2015 general election; Peter Harris, candidate for Dagenham and Rainham in the 2015 general election; Richard Hendron, LGBT activist and candidate for Brentford and Isleworth in the 2015 general election; Elizabeth Jones, candidate for Dartford in the 2015 general election; David Kurten, candidate for Camberwell and Peckham in the 2015 general election; Winston McKenzie, perennial candidate and UKIP candidate for Croydon North in the 2015 general election; and Shneur Odze, former Hackney councillor.|$|E
