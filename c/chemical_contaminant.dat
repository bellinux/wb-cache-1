40|$|<b>Chemical</b> <b>contaminants</b> {{may occur}} in our food from various sources.

They typically pose a health concern, resulting in strict regulations of their levels by national governments and internationally. Therefore, analysis of relevant <b>chemical</b> <b>contaminants</b> is an essential part of food safety testing programs to ensure consumer safety and compliance with regulatory limits.

The report is part of a project to integrate various analytical specialties to assess linkages between <b>chemical</b> <b>contaminants</b> and the condition of coral reefs. In this phase of the project, over 120 <b>chemical</b> <b>contaminants</b> were analyzed in sediments collected, including a number of organic (e. g., hydrocarbons), inorganic (e. g., metals), and biological (bacterial) compounds/analytes. The report also provides a preliminary analysis of the association between sediment contaminants and coral species richness. Overall, the levels of <b>chemical</b> <b>contaminants</b> in the study area between Guanica Bay and the town of La Parguera were fairly low. At most of the sites sampled, particularly adjacent to the town of La Parguera, concentrations of organic and inorganic contaminants were below the median values from NOAA’s National Status and Trends Program, which monitors the Nation’s coastal and estuarine waters for <b>chemical</b> <b>contaminants.</b> Elevated levels of a number of contaminant classes were seen at the two sites sampled within Guanica Bay. An initial analysis of modeled PAH (hydrocarbon) data and coral species richness (reef building species) indicated a strong negative correlation between the presence of PAHs in the sediments and coral species richness. Additional work is needed to assess possible reasons for this observed pattern. (PDF contains 126 pages) ...|$|R

5000|$|Remediation {{began in}} 2005 after {{production}} of chlorinated solvents by ICI {{over many years}} resulted in significant contamination of the [...] aquifer, a high quality sand aquifer located below the eastern suburbs of Sydney, New South Wales. The main <b>chemical</b> <b>contaminant</b> found in groundwater around the old ICI site is EDC (1,2-dichloroethane), a persistent organic pollutant and byproduct of the manufacture of PVC. Orica has built an A$167 million Groundwater Treatment Plant (GTP) to achieve containment of this contamination and provide high quality industrial water to Botany Industrial Park. Water produced by Orica's GTP saves Sydney's potable water supply around [...] per day (approx 0.5% of Sydney's water demand). Residents in the area were banned from accessing the groundwater.

50|$|In the 1940s, {{with the}} advent and {{widespread}} use of pesticides such as DDT, the brown pelican numbers plummeted {{due to the lack}} of breeding success. By the 1960s, it had almost disappeared along the Gulf Coast and had suffered almost complete reproductive failure in southern California, due to DDT usage in the United States. In 1972, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) banned DDT usage in the United States, and limited the use of other pesticides. Since then, there has been a decline in <b>chemical</b> <b>contaminant</b> levels in the brown pelican eggs, and a corresponding increase in its nesting success. The Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries’ reintroduction program from 1968 to 1980 re-established the brown pelican, which restored the population numbers in Texas and California.

40|$|Drinking water {{policies}} are written {{descriptions of the}} approach taken by the Program to implement a statute, regulation, court order, or other agency order, and may include the Program’s current practice, procedure, or method of action based on that approach. Any generally applicable directives or criteria that {{provide the basis for}} imposing penalties or sanctions, or for granting or denying Program approvals, must either be in statute or established in a rule. POLICY STATEMENT: The Department of Health, Office of Drinking Water (ODW) rules are designed to ensure water systems provide safe and high quality drinking water in a reliable manner and in a quantity suitable for intended use (WAC 246 - 290 - 001 [2][b]). When a primary standard violation occurs, the purveyor shall: (1) notify the department, (2) notify its consumers, (3) determine the cause of the contaminant, and (4) take action as directed by the ODW (WAC 246 - 290 - 320 [1][b][i] – [iv]). The need to provide for a short-term alternative water supply occurs when an acute <b>chemical</b> <b>contaminant</b> is present over the maximum contaminant level (MCL), or when a chronic <b>chemical</b> <b>contaminant</b> is at a concentration considered acute by the department’s Office of Environmental Health Assessment (OEHA). Alternative water is not required for coliform MCL where a Boil Water Advisory is in place or where boiling water is feasible. When directing a water purveyor to take action to address an acute <b>chemical</b> <b>contaminant</b> over the MCL, or a chronic <b>chemical</b> <b>contaminant</b> at a concentration considered acute by OEHA, ODW may use a bilateral compliance agreement (BCA) or a departmental order identifying the appropriate course of action the purveyor will take to remediate the contamination. In the interim, while development of permanent remediation activities is progressing, ODW will require the water purveyor to provide a short-term alternative water supply meeting drinking water standards. The water system shall provide the short-term alternative water supply to all customers who request it. Failure to provide an alternative water source may lead to enforcement as outlined in WAC 246...|$|E

40|$|This report {{contains}} a {{chemical and biological}} characterization of sediments from the St. Thomas East End Reserves (STEER) in St. Thomas, U. S. Virgin Islands (USVI). The STEER Management Plan (published in 2011) identified <b>chemical</b> <b>contaminants</b> and habitat loss as high or very high threats {{and called for a}} characterization of <b>chemical</b> <b>contaminants</b> as well as an assessment of their effects on natural resources. The baseline information contained in this report on <b>chemical</b> <b>contaminants,</b> toxicity and benthic infaunal community composition can be used to assess current conditions, as well as the efficacy of future restoration activities. In this phase of the project, 185 <b>chemical</b> <b>contaminants,</b> including a number of organic (e. g., hydrocarbons and pesticides) and inorganic (e. g., metals) compounds, were analyzed from 24 sites in the STEER. Sediments were also analyzed using a series of toxicity bioassays, including amphipod mortality, sea urchin fertilization impairment, and the cytochrome P 450 Human Reporter Gene System (HRGS), along with a characterization of the benthic infaunal community. Higher levels of <b>chemical</b> <b>contaminants</b> were found in Mangrove Lagoon and Benner Bay in the western portion of the study area than in the eastern area. The concentrations of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), DDT (dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane), chlordane, zinc, copper, lead and mercury were above a NOAA sediment quality guideline at one or more sites, indicating impacts may be present in more sensitive species or life stages in the benthic environment. Copper at one site in Benner Bay, however, was above a NOAA guideline indicating that effects on benthic organisms were likely. The antifoulant boat hull ingredient tributyltin, or TBT, was found at the third highest concentration in the history of NOAA’s National Status and Trends (NS&T) Program, which monitors the Nation’s coastal and estuarine waters for <b>chemical</b> <b>contaminants</b> and bioeffects.
