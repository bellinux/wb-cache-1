60|$|Here was {{a pretty}} pass, indeed, thought Barney. It was {{sufficiently}} embarrassing to be mistaken for the king, but to be thrown into this false position in company with {{a beautiful young woman}} to whom the king was engaged to be married, and who, with the others, thought him to be the king, was quite the last word in <b>impossible</b> <b>positions.</b>|$|R

50|$|The South Africa Film and Publications Act, No. 65 of 1996 {{can be seen}} to {{demonstrate}} the move of the liberation state from concern for its citizens and residents, to forcing them to comply, using increasingly draconian tactics, which put an accused at a severe disadvantage as regards the burden of proof, and puts the media in the <b>impossible</b> <b>position</b> of having to submit material to the Board before publication.|$|R

If the vehicle's center of mass moves outside of the wheelbase or axle track, the vehicle will become statically unstable, and will tend to tip over. At speed, a vehicle can become dynamically unstable, meaning that it can be tipped over by an obstacle smaller than its static stability limit, or by excessive acceleration or tight turning. Without articulation, this can be an <b>impossible</b> <b>position</b> from which to recover.|$|R

50|$|In {{relation}} to realist objections, Feyerabend returns to an argument elaborated by Carnap and comments {{that the use}} of such abstract concepts leads to an <b>impossible</b> <b>position,</b> as «...theoretical terms receive their interpretation by being connected with an observational language and those terms are empty without that connection.» (Feyerabend, pp. 373). As before it follows that they {{can not be used to}} confer significance to the observational language as this observational language is its only source of significance, with which it is not possible to make a translation but only a restatement of the term.|$|R

50|$|Some critics {{believe that}} in Hamletmachine, Mueller deconstructs the <b>impossible</b> <b>position</b> of an Eastern European {{intellectual}} {{at the peak of}} the Cold War as well as the seemingly disappearing agency of the author. Likewise, Opheliamachine captures the current historical moment with all its entrapments: the dissolution of national and gender identities, the loss of agency and the solipsism of contemporary lives in an increasingly fragmented—if connected—world, the brutal, animal-like quality of modern relationships, the collapse of a social order and its distinction, the chaos and violence that follows.|$|R

40|$|The authors {{propose a}} new way to defease the legacy costs of America's defined benefit pension system that will help ensure its viability. The {{proposal}} would allow companies to exchange their legacy pension debt for another liability with more attractive terms-to the benefit of the sponsor, the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC), and the plan participants. The transparency gained by separating the past from future liabilities will give better insight into sponsors' balance sheets. And it could take the PBGC out of the <b>impossible</b> <b>position</b> of insuring against events over which the insured have considerable control. 2006 Morgan Stanley. ...|$|R

50|$|The Thema Mundi ("World Theme", with 'theme' being a {{word that}} also means chart) was a mythical {{horoscope}} used in Hellenistic astrology that shows the supposed positions of the seven visible planets (including the Sun and Moon) {{at the beginning of}} the universe. It purports to exemplify the logic behind the sign rulerships, exaltations, and meanings of the aspects, among other things. The purely symbolic nature of the chart is readily perceived from the <b>impossible</b> <b>positions</b> of Venus and Mercury in it. In the late Middle Ages there has been a confusion between a horoscope of the world and the thema mundi.|$|R

He {{finished}} a close second in the King George VI Chase and then started second favourite for the Gold Cup in March.

50|$|While in Die Pechbrenner {{the fate}} of the boy’s family who work in resin {{extraction}} is described in detail, in Granite it is only touched upon. In the first edition, 13 year-old Josef helps the desperate stranger, thus bringing the plague into his family. As a punishment, his father abandons him on an inaccessible rock, thereby condemning him to starvation. Only thanks to the help from two other survivors, the little girl Magdalena and the servant Knut, does he manage to get out of his <b>impossible</b> <b>position.</b> All three find {{their way out of the}} wood. The ending of the first edition, as well as the beginning, largely agrees with Granite.|$|R
5000|$|This line {{is spoken}} in a {{conversation}} with Marla's husband Cedric about his <b>impossible</b> <b>position</b> of running the Barksdale investigation while trying to further his career. Extended to the episode as a whole the quote can also mean that if you do not become involved with the drug trade, commonly referred to as [...] "The Game", you will not lose your life. This is most obviously evidenced in the episode by the murder of William Gant, about which D'Angelo exclaims, [...] "he ain't have to testify"; if Gant had chosen not to testify he would not have become involved in D'Angelo's murder trial and would have still been alive.|$|R
60|$|But he {{soon found}} himself in the <b>impossible</b> <b>position</b> of having to serve two masters. On the one hand there was Russia, and the {{orthodox}} Russians whose tsar he was, and on the other there were the Poles, who had made him so at a price, and who now demanded payment. Because he saw that this payment would be difficult and fraught with peril to himself he would--after the common wont of princes who have attained their objects--have repudiated the debt. And so he was disposed to ignore, or at least to evade, the persistent reminders that reached him from the Papal Nuncio, to whom he had promised the introduction into Russia of the Roman faith.|$|R
50|$|Acamas (foaled 2 May 1975) was a British-bred French-trained Thoroughbred racehorse and sire. The last notable horse {{owned by}} the French breeder Marcel Boussac he showed promise as a two-year-old in 1977 when he {{finished}} a close third in the Grand Criterium. He reached his peak {{in the following year}} when he won the Prix Lupin and the Prix du Jockey Club, coming from an apparently <b>impossible</b> <b>position</b> in the latter race. He then finished second in the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes in England, but was later disqualified after failing a dope test. At the end of his three-year-old season he was retired to stud but proved largely infertile.|$|R
50|$|India objected {{first of}} all that the {{resolution}} placed India and Pakistan on an equal footing, ignoring the complaint of Pakistani aggression and Kashmir's legal accession to India. Secondly, it objected {{to the absence of}} allowance for it to retain troops in the state for its defence. It also felt the requirement of a coalition government would put Sheikh Abdullah, then Prime Minister of Kashmir, in an <b>impossible</b> <b>position.</b> It said that the powers conferred on the Plebiscite Administrator were far too wide and undermined the state's sovereignty. It felt that provision for the return of all refugees was unrealistic. Finally, India wanted Pakistan to be excluded from the conduct of the plebiscite.|$|R
50|$|Palestinian {{president}} Mahmoud Abbas, defying widespread popular Palestinian {{support for}} the kidnapping {{as a means of}} securing the release of Palestinians held in Israeli jails, criticized the action, saying the youths must be returned, and that Palestinian Authority security was cooperating with Israel to try to locate them. Abbas' office released a statement condemning the kidnapping and the Israeli response of raids and arrests. At US urging, Abbas was working closely with Israel to coordinate the search for the teens. A PA spokesman stated that holding Palestinian authorities responsible for kidnappings in Area C of the West Bank, where Israel exercises full military control and prohibits a Palestinian police presence places the PA in an <b>impossible</b> <b>position.</b>|$|R
