Budín de Pan (bread pudding), Bienmesabe - little yellow cakes soaked in coconut cream, Brazo Gitano - Puerto Rican style sponge cake with cream and / or fruit filling, Buñuelos de viento - Puerto Rican wind puffs soaked in a vanilla, lemon, and sugar syrup, Natilla - (spice-milk custard), Tembleque (coconut pudding), Flan (egg custard), Flancocho - cake mix, cream cheese, caramel, and egg <b>custard</b> <b>mix</b> backed {{together}} using then flan method, Bizcocho de Ron (rum cake), Mantecaditos - Puerto Rican shortbread cookies, Polvorones - a crunchy cookie with a dusty sweet cinnamon exterior, Turrón de Ajónjolí - a toasted sesame seed bar, bound together by honey and caramelized brown sugar, Mampostiales - very thick, gooey candy bar of caramelized brown sugar and coconut chips, challenging to chew and with a strong, almost molasses-like flavor, Dulce de cassabanana - musk cucumber cooked in syrup topped with walnuts and sour cream on the side, pastelillos de guayaba (guava pastries), Besitos de Coco (coconut kisses), and Tarta de Guayaba (guava tarts).|$|E
40|$|In August 1994, 30 of 135 (23 %) bakery plant {{employees}} and over 100 people from South Wales and Bristol in the United Kingdom, {{were affected by}} an outbreak of gastroenteritis. Epidemiological studies of {{employees and}} three community clusters found illness in employees {{to be associated with}} drinking cold water at the bakery (relative risk 3 · 3, 95 %, CI 1 · 6 – 7 · 0), and in community cases with eating custard slices (relative risk 19 · 8, 95 %, CI 2 · 9 – 135 · 1) from a variety of stores supplied by one particular bakery. Small round-structured viruses (SRSV) were identified in stool specimens from 4 employees and 7 community cases. Analysis of the polymerase and capsid regions of the SRSV genome by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) demonstrated viruses of both genogroups (1 and 2) each with several different nucleotide sequences. The heterogeneity of the viruses identified in the outbreak suggests that dried <b>custard</b> <b>mix</b> may have been inadvertently reconstituted with contaminated water. The incident shows how secondary food contamination can cause wide-scale community gastroenteritis outbreaks, and demonstrates the ability of molecular techniques to support classical epidemiological methods in outbreak investigations...|$|E

40|$|One {{hundred and}} thiry-three vanilla slices, {{purchased}} from {{shops in the}} West Yorkshire Metropolitan County, were examined to determine the numbers and types of bacteria present {{at the time of}} purchase. The surface colony count at 37 degrees C was greater than 10 (3) /g in 67 / 133 (50 %) of the samples examined, Bacillus cereus being found at that concentration in 21. 8 %, coliform bacilli including E. coli in 5. 3 %, Staphylococcus aureus in 3 - 0 % and Streptococcus faecalis in 0 - 8 %. Thirty-four strains of B. cereus were serotyped and 11 (32 %) of these were typable with the sera available. Preparation of <b>custard</b> <b>mixed</b> in the laboratory suggests that the milk or milk powder used in the mix may be the major source of B. cereus in the final product. Many of the present methods of manufacture, distribution and storage allow organisms present in the custard at manufacture the opportunity to multiply and possibly reach numbers which present a risk of food poisoning...|$|R
5000|$|A quiche is a savoury custard tart. Some {{kinds of}} timbale or {{vegetable}} loaf {{are made of}} a <b>custard</b> base <b>mixed</b> with chopped savoury ingredients.

50|$|Cornstarch {{is used as}} a {{thickening}} agent in liquid-based foods (e.g., soup, sauces, gravies, <b>custard),</b> usually by <b>mixing</b> it with a lower-temperature liquid to form a paste or slurry. It is sometimes preferred over flour alone because it forms a translucent, rather than opaque mixture. As the starch is heated, the molecular chains unravel, allowing them to collide with other starch chains to form a mesh, thickening the liquid (Starch gelatinization).|$|R
40|$|Three {{different}} {{plant products}} diets – i) neem (Azadirachta indic A. Juss) oil mixed diet (neem oil mixed @ 80 ml/kg of normal diet), ii) neem seed powder mixed diet (neem seed powder mixed @ 80 g/kg of normal diet) and iii) custard apple (Annona reticulata L.) seed powder <b>mixed</b> diet (<b>custard</b> apple seed powder mixed @ 80 g/kg of normal diet) were separately fed to mature rats (Rattus rattus) with single dose feeding of 80 g per pair {{in a day}} on 13 th week-age during the experimenting years, 2012 / 013 and 2013 / 014. In control group only normal diet without neem and custard apple constituents were fed. Sterility test of rat was conducted up to 38 and 28 weeks-age in first and second year, respectively. The test rats were fed normal diet during whole experimenting periods except the one day when they were fed only the neem or <b>custard</b> apple <b>mixed</b> diet on the age of 13 th week. Efficacy of the mixed diets on rat-sterility was determined based on pregnancy and parturition by the rats. The two years' results confirmed that all the tested three mixed diets – neem oil mixed diet, neem seed powder <b>mixed</b> diet, and <b>custard</b> apple seed powder mixed diet were effective to stop pregnancy and parturition in rats during whole experimenting periods up to 38 and 28 weeks-age with single dose feeding of 80 g per pair (40 gm/rat) in a day on 13 th week-age of the rats; whereas the pregnancy and parturition were observed in the rats that were fed only the normal diet. It is expected, neem and <b>custard</b> apple <b>mixed</b> diets can be utilized in reducing the economically important rodent populations in rice-wheat cropping system in future...|$|R
