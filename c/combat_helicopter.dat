25|$|In September 2012, ground {{tests for}} the first {{production}} Rudra were completed. It featured a turret gun, rockets, air-to-air missiles and could carry air-to-ground missiles like the anti-tank helicopter-launched Nag. HAL was awarded with a combined order of 76 Rudras for the Indian army, the primary customer, and the Indian air force. It was reported that the weapons platforms and avionics of HAL Rudra and the under-development Light <b>Combat</b> <b>Helicopter</b> would be the same.|$|E

25|$|Several {{land and}} naval {{variants}} of the Lynx {{have been produced}} along with some major derivatives. The Westland 30 was produced as a civil utility helicopter; it did not become a commercial success and {{only a small number}} were built during the 1980s. In the 21st century, a modernised variant of the Lynx was designed as a multirole <b>combat</b> <b>helicopter,</b> designated as the AgustaWestland AW159 Wildcat; the Wildcat is intended to replace existing Lynx helicopters. The Lynx remains in production by AgustaWestland, the successor to Westland Helicopters.|$|E
25|$|On 2 June, {{fighting}} re-erupts in Benghazi when Ansar al-Sharia militants attacked Haftar's forces, {{the latter}} responding with <b>combat</b> <b>helicopter</b> strikes {{in the west}} of the city. At least 22 people were killed and 70 wounded, with both sides accusing one another of indiscriminate firing on residential areas. It started the previous day, when aircraft pounded one of the militants' compounds in region. The education ministry closed schools and postponed exams until the violence is quelled and hospitals called for blood donations. Residents in south Benghazi set up checkpoints to avoid being taken by cross-fire in case rival fighters decided to take shelter in their homes. There was also fighting in the eastern town of Al-Marj where dozens were wounded.|$|E
25|$|The Air Force and Army {{will also}} use their Advanced Light {{helicopters}} (ALH) (HAL Dhruv) and the HAL Light <b>Combat</b> <b>Helicopter</b> (LHC) as Nag carriers. The ALHs will {{be equipped with}} IRDE (DRDO) developed HELITIS (Heliborne Imaging and Targeting systems) {{with a combination of}} a FLIR and laser range finder in a stabilised turret for target acquisition and designation. The thermal imager is likely to be imported, but the gimballed turret, stabilisation, laser range finder and associated electronics have been designed in India and will be manufactured locally. The Nag ATGM is regarded as a highly capable missile, even though its development has been protracted, mainly due to the technological challenges of developing a state of the art IIR sensor equipped top attack missile. The Nag is still cheaper than most imported missiles in its category and is earmarked for the Army and Air Force.|$|E
