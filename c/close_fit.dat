5|$|In {{conversations with}} Eidelman, Meyer {{mentioned}} {{that since the}} marches that accompanied the main titles for the previous Star Trek films were so good, he {{had no desire to}} compete with them by composing a bombastic opening. He also felt that since the film was darker than its predecessors, it demanded something different musically as a result. He mentioned the opening to Igor Stravinsky's The Firebird as similar to the foreboding sound he wanted. Two days later Eidelman produced a tape of his idea for the main theme, played on a synthesizer. Meyer was impressed by the speed of the work and the <b>close</b> <b>fit</b> to his vision. Meyer approached producer Steven Charles-Jaffe with Eidelman's CD, which reminded Jaffe of Bernard Herrmann; Eidelman was given the task of composing the score.|$|E
25|$|Laterally compressed, or ziphodont teeth, are {{characteristic}} of Sebecus and other sebecosuchians. Although the teeth vary in size, they are homodont, having a similar shape throughout the jaw. At {{the tips of the}} upper and lower jaws, the teeth are rounder in cross-section. The fourth dentary tooth is raised in the lower jaw to form an effective canine. The foremost teeth of the lower jaw are much smaller and lower than the fourth tooth. At the tip of the jaw the first dentary tooth is procumbent, or directed forward. The teeth of the upper and lower jaws form an alternate pattern to allow the jaw to close tightly. A notch is present between the maxilla and premaxilla bones of the upper jaw, accommodating the fourth dentary tooth when the jaw is closed. The procumbent first dentary teeth fit {{between the first and second}} premaxillary teeth. This <b>close</b> <b>fit</b> allows the serrated edges of the teeth shear with one another.|$|E

The appropriateness of its theme {{in relation to the}} Great Exhibition was also questioned. The Art Journal pointed out the contradiction between [...] "the effigy of a valiant crusader" [...] and [...] "the great Peace congress of 1851" [...] and asked why [...] "a foreign sculptor alone" [...] was being selected to commemorate a British exhibition. The Lord Mayor of London, Thomas Challis, was similarly critical, declaring that the statue depicted [...] "muscular power and the almost savage ferocity of war ..., while ... the Great Exhibition afforded an example of the cordial amity of nations." [...] His criticism was perhaps not unrelated {{to the fact that he}} was promoting a rival scheme to commemorate the Exhibition. Others criticised the statue's lack of realism.

2500|$|The Morning Post left Moisson on {{delivery}} to Farnborough at 10:15 {{in the morning}} of 26 October 1910, carrying eight people including the pilot Louis Capazza [...] and three passengers: the designer Henri Julliot, the newly appointed commander of the Army Balloon School Major Sir A. Bannerman, and a representative of the Morning Post. [...] By two o'clock it had reached Brighton on the English southern coast, it then travelled north over Horsham towards Aldershot. [...] It soon approached North Camp at Farnborough for an attempted landing on the common close to the Army Balloon Works. Due to the strong winds it took a number of approaches to the common before troops managed to grab the ropes and secure the airship. The airship was towed to a balloon works shed specially built to house it. It was soon realised it would be a <b>close</b> <b>fit</b> but as it had been measured to fit for the Morning Post all that was required was that care was taken in moving the airship into the shed. With all but ten feet inside the shed, a large hiss was heard as the envelope had caught on a girder. A number of troops were under the airship as it collapsed but nobody was hurt.|$|E
2500|$|Semi-dry {{suits are}} {{effectively}} a thick wetsuit with nearly watertight seals at wrist, neck and ankles and zip. They are typically used {{where the water}} temperature is between [...] The seals limit the volume of water entering and leaving the suit, and a <b>close</b> <b>fit</b> minimises pumping action caused by limb motion. The wearer gets wet in a semi-dry suit but the water that enters is soon warmed up and does not readily leave the suit, so the wearer remains warm. The trapped layer of water does not add to the suit's insulating ability, and any water circulation past the seals still causes heat loss, but semi-dry suits are cheap and simple compared to dry suits, and do not fail catastrophically. They are made from thick Neoprene, which provides good thermal protection, but lose buoyancy and thermal protection as the trapped gas bubbles in the neoprene foam compress at depth. Semi-dry suits are usually made as a one piece full suit with slick inside surface neoprene wrist, cuff and neck seals [...] Two-piece sets {{tend to be a}} one piece full length suit, sometimes described as [...] "long johns", plus accessories to be worn over, under or with the one-piece suit, such as a shortie tunic, which may be worn separately in warm water, but has no flush-limiting seals at the openings. Semi dry suits do not usually include hoods, boots or gloves, so separate insulating hoods, boots and gloves are worn.|$|E

30|$|The box plots in Fig.  6 do {{not show}} which {{learning}} method is a <b>closer</b> <b>fit</b> to the observed empirical data. RMSE was computed on each replication across the time periods for both learning methods. The average RMSE for each study area by learning method is in Table  2. In general, both learning methods have low RMSE values across each study area. However, there is difference between the learning methods. Belief learning has lower average RMSE values (meaning a <b>closer</b> <b>fit)</b> than Q-learning for all the study areas. This indicates that belief learning is a <b>closer</b> <b>fit</b> to the observed data than Q-learning. The box plots {{of the distribution of}} RMSE values by learning method in Fig.  7 show the variance in the belief learning results are much smaller. The box plots graphically show the mean and median RMSE values for belief learning are lower than Q-learning. Paired t-tests comparing these RMSE distributions for each study area confirm the RMSE for belief learning is statistically significant lower than Q-learning for all study areas at 99 % confidence. F-tests comparing RMSE variances also confirm belief learning is statistically significant lower than Q-learning for all study areas at 99 % confidence.|$|R

60|$|At seven o’clock {{this morning}} the Beloochees began to arrive, having started at midnight. The {{advanced}} guard were therefore exactly the same time doing the distance that we were. Their baggage, however, has been dropping in all day, for it was loaded on camels, {{and most of these}} animals stuck fast in the narrow passages of the pass, and had to be unloaded to enable them to get through; and this happened again and again. The pass, in fact, is not, as yet, practicable for camels; mules can manage it, but it is a very <b>close</b> <b>fit</b> for them, and it will be some time yet before camels can pass with their burdens. I suppose after to-day’s experience camels will not be again employed this side of Koomaylo until the pass has been widened. Some of the poor animals were stuck fast {{for a couple of hours}} before they could be extricated. There are now a hundred of them lying down within fifty yards of my tent. I consider the camel to be the most ridiculously-overpraised animal under the sun. I do not deny that he has his virtues. He is moderately strong—not very strong for his size, for he will not carry so much as a couple of good mules; still he is fairly strong, and he can go a long time without water—a very useful quality in the desert, or on the sea-shore of Abyssinia. But patient! Heaven save the mark! He is without exception the most cantankerous animal under the sun. When he is wanted to stand up, he lies down; when he is wanted to lie down, he will not do it on any consideration; and once down he jumps up again the moment his driver’s back is turned. He grumbles, and growls, and roars at any order he receives, whether to stand up or lie down; whether to be loaded or to have his packs taken off. When he is once loaded and in motion he goes on quietly enough; but so does a horse, or a donkey, or any other animal. After having made himself as disagreeable as possible, there is small praise to him that he goes on when he cannot help it. I consider the mule, which people have most wrongfully named obstinate, to be a superior animal in every respect—except that he wants his drink—to the much-bepraised camel.|$|E
