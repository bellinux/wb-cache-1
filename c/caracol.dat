5|$|In 561, {{the king}} {{now known as}} Sky Witness {{installed}} a ruler {{at the site of}} Los Alacranes. Sky Witness played a major part in the political events of the Maya region. He became the overlord of the city of <b>Caracol,</b> to the south of Naranjo, which had previously been a vassal of Tikal. In 562, according to a damaged text at <b>Caracol,</b> Sky Witness defeated Tikal itself and sacrificed its king Wak Chan K'awiil, thus ending his branch of the royal dynasty at Tikal. This catastrophic defeat began a 130-year hiatus for Tikal, reflecting an extended period of dominance by Calakmul. This event is used as a marker to divide the Early Classic from the Late Classic. Sky Witness is also mentioned at Okop, a site much further north in Quintana Roo. The last reference to Sky Witness occurs at <b>Caracol</b> and is dated to AD 572. The text is damaged but probably records the death of this powerful king.|$|E
5|$|Stela 30 is {{the first}} {{surviving}} monument to be erected after the Hiatus. Its style and iconography {{is similar to that}} of <b>Caracol,</b> one of the more important of Tikal's enemies.|$|E
5|$|The site, however, {{was often}} at war and {{inscriptions}} tell of alliances and conflict with other Maya states, including Uaxactun, <b>Caracol,</b> Naranjo and Calakmul. The site was defeated {{at the end}} of the Early Classic by <b>Caracol,</b> which rose to take Tikal's place as the paramount center in the southern Maya lowlands. The earlier part of the Early Classic saw hostilities between Tikal and its neighbor Uaxactun, with Uaxactun recording the capture of prisoners from Tikal.|$|E

5000|$|In {{the view}} of the {{substantial}} expansion from the site core into the surrounding area during his reign, K'an II might be considered <b>Caracol's</b> most successful ruler. The wealth underlying this expansion was widespread, as indicated by the quality of grave goods and architecture in the outlying districts; <b>Caracol's</b> system of roadways also expanded to accommodate the growing population.|$|R

5|$|A revival can be {{identified}} by {{the dedication of the}} first new monument in a century and a half, raised by the otherwise unknown king, K'awiil Yopaat, in 653. Continued contact with Copán is evident, as well as longer distance contacts, possibly with <b>Caracol</b> in Belize. At about the same time major construction work was undertaken in the acropolis, including the building of the site's first ballcourt.|$|E
5|$|As well as E-Groups, the Maya built other {{structures}} dedicated to observing {{the movements of}} celestial bodies. Many Maya buildings were aligned with astronomical bodies, including the planet Venus, and various constellations. The <b>Caracol</b> structure at Chichen Itza was a circular multi-level edifice, with a conical superstructure. It has slit windows that marked the movements of Venus. At Copán, a pair of stelae were raised to mark {{the position of the}} setting sun at the equinoxes.|$|E
5|$|The Maya {{had a long}} {{tradition}} of mural painting; rich polychrome murals have been excavated at San Bartolo, dating to between 300 and 200 BC. Walls were coated with plaster, and polychrome designs were painted onto the smooth finish. The majority of such murals have not survived, but Early Classic tombs painted in cream, red, and black have been excavated at <b>Caracol,</b> Río Azul, and Tikal. Among the best preserved murals are a full-size series of Late Classic paintings at Bonampak.|$|E

5|$|Aveni {{claims that}} another {{building}} {{associated with the}} planet Venus {{in the form of}} Kukulcan, and the rainy season at Chichen Itza is the <b>Caracol.</b> This is a building with circular tower and doors facing the cardinal directions. The base faces the most northerly setting of Venus. Additionally the pillars of a stylobate on the building's upper platform were painted black and red. These are colours associated with Venus as an evening and morning star. However the windows in the tower seem to have been little more than slots, making them poor at letting light in, but providing a suitable place to view out.|$|E
5|$|B'alam Nehn (often {{referred}} to as Waterlily Jaguar) was the first king to actually record his position in the dynastic succession, declaring that he was seventh in line from K'inich Yax K'uk' Mo'. Stela15 records that he was already ruling Copán by AD504. B'alam Nehn is the only king of Copán to be mentioned in a hieroglyphic text from outside of the southeastern Maya region. His name appears in a text on Stela16 from <b>Caracol,</b> a site in Belize. The stela dates to AD534, but the text is not well understood. B'alam Nehn undertook major construction projects in the Acropolis, building over an early palace {{with a number of}} important structures.|$|E
5|$|Hieroglyphic texts at Seibal {{indicate}} that the city's newly refound vigour was sponsored by a new alliance formed by the cities of <b>Caracol</b> and Ucanal in the east, two sites that had so far survived the spreading Classic Maya collapse. It is likely that they were attempting to reopen the old Pasión-Usumacinta trade route and were drawn to Seibal by its defensible location overlooking the Pasión River. Seibal's refounding took place in AD 830 with the installation of Wat'ul Chatel as a vassal of Chan Ek' Hopet of Ucanal. The new king dedicated a new building and stelae in 849, overseen by Jewel K'awil of Tikal, and Chan Pet, king of Calakmul. Wat'ul Chatel built an innovative new temple-stelae arrangement {{to the south of}} the Central Plaza of GroupA. StructureA-3 consists of a low radial pyramid with an inventive arrangement of sculpted monuments.|$|E

5|$|A {{criticism}} {{of this method}} {{is that it can}} be statistically weak. Schaefer in particular has questioned how robust the claimed alignments in the <b>Caracol</b> are. Because of the wide variety of evidence, which can include artefacts as well as sites, there is no one way to practice archaeoastronomy. Despite this it is accepted that archaeoastronomy is not a discipline that sits in isolation. Because archaeoastronomy is an interdisciplinary field, whatever is being investigated should make sense both archaeologically and astronomically. Studies {{are more likely to be}} considered sound if they use theoretical tools found in archaeology like analogy and homology and if they can demonstrate an understanding of accuracy and precision found in astronomy. Both quantitative analyses and interpretations based on ethnographic analogies and other contextual evidence have recently been applied in systematic studies of architectural orientations in the Maya area and in other parts of Mesoamerica.|$|E
5|$|The Maya {{political}} landscape was highly complex and Maya elites engaged in political intrigue to gain {{economic and social}} advantage over neighbours. In the Late Classic, some cities established {{a long period of}} dominance over other large cities, such as the dominance of <b>Caracol</b> over Naranjo for half a century. In other cases, loose alliance networks were formed around a dominant city. Border settlements, usually located about halfway between neighbouring capitals, often switched allegiance over the course of their history, and at times acted independently. Dominant capitals exacted tribute in the form of luxury items from subjugated population centres. Political power was reinforced by military power, and the capture and humiliation of enemy warriors played an important part in elite culture. An overriding sense of pride and honour among the warrior aristocracy could lead to extended feuds and vendettas, which caused political instability and the fragmentation of polities.|$|E
5|$|The six {{sites with}} {{particularly}} outstanding architecture or sculpture are Chichen Itza, Palenque, Uxmal, and Yaxchilan in Mexico, Tikal in Guatemala and Copán in Honduras. Other important, but difficult to reach, sites include Calakmul and El Mirador. The principal {{sites in the}} Puuc region, after Uxmal, are Kabah, Labna, and Sayil. In {{the east of the}} Yucatán Peninsula are Coba and the small site of Tulum. The Río Bec sites of the base of the peninsula include Becan, Chicanná, Kohunlich, and Xpuhil. The most noteworthy sites in Chiapas, other than Palenque and Yaxchilan, are Bonampak and Toniná. In the Guatemalan Highlands are Iximche, Kaminaljuyu, Mixco Viejo, and Q'umarkaj (also known as Utatlán). In the northern Petén lowlands of Guatemala there are many sites, though apart from Tikal access is generally difficult. Some of the Petén sites are Dos Pilas, Seibal, and Uaxactún. Important sites in Belize include Altun Ha, <b>Caracol,</b> and Xunantunich.|$|E

5|$|Uneh Chan {{maintained}} his alliances with {{cities in the}} east and he is depicted on <b>Caracol</b> Stela 4 supervising an event involving king Yajaw Te' K'inich of that city that occurred before 583. Calakmul again sacked Palenque on 7 April 611 under the personal direction of Uneh Chan. Palenque was now ruled by king Ajen Yohl Mat who had gained some sort of independence from Calakmul, provoking the new invasion. The immediate aftermath of this second victory over Palenque involved the deaths of the two most important nobles at the city, Ajen Yohl Mat himself and Janab Pakal, a high-ranking member of the royal family and possibly co-ruler. Janab Pakal died in March 612 and Ajen Yohl Mat a few months later. Their deaths so soon after the sacking of the city suggests that their demise was directly linked to Calakmul's triumph. Palenque suffered a lengthy decline in its fortunes after this date before it was able to recover from its disastrous war with Calakmul. The wars against Palenque may have been undertaken by Uneh Chan in order to seize control of wealthy trade routes that passed through the western Maya region.|$|E
5|$|Triadic pyramids first {{appeared}} in the Preclassic. They consisted of a dominant structure flanked by two smaller inward-facing buildings, all mounted upon a single basal platform. The largest known triadic pyramid was built at El Mirador in the Petén Basin; it covers an area six times as large as that covered by Temple IV, the largest pyramid at Tikal. The three superstructures all have stairways leading up from the central plaza on top of the basal platform. No securely established forerunners of Triadic Groups are known, but they may have developed from the eastern range building of E-Group complexes. The triadic form was the predominant architectural form in the Petén region during the Late Preclassic. Examples of triadic pyramids are known from as many as 88 archaeological sites. At Nakbe, there are at least a dozen examples of triadic complexes and the four largest structures in the city are triadic in nature. At El Mirador there are probably as many as 36 triadic structures. Examples of the triadic form are even known from Dzibilchaltun in the far north of the Yucatán Peninsula, and Q'umarkaj in the Highlands of Guatemala. The triadic pyramid remained a popular architectural form for centuries after the first examples were built; it continued in use into the Classic Period, with later examples being found at Uaxactun, <b>Caracol,</b> Seibal, Nakum, Tikal and Palenque. The Q'umarkaj example {{is the only one that}} has been dated to the Postclassic Period. The triple-temple form of the triadic pyramid appears to be related to Maya mythology.|$|E
5|$|Unlike the Aztecs and the Inca, the Maya {{political}} system never integrated the entire Maya cultural area {{into a single}} state or empire. Rather, throughout its history, the Maya area contained a varying mix of political complexity that included both states and chiefdoms. These polities fluctuated greatly in their relationships {{with each other and}} were engaged in a complex web of rivalries, periods of dominance or submission, vassalage, and alliances. At times, different polities achieved regional dominance, such as Calakmul, <b>Caracol,</b> Mayapan, and Tikal. The first reliably evidenced polities formed in the Maya lowlands in the 9th century BC. During the Late Preclassic, the Maya {{political system}} coalesced into a theopolitical form, where elite ideology justified the ruler's authority, and was reinforced by public display, ritual, and religion. The divine king was the centre of political power, exercising ultimate control over the administrative, economic, judicial, and military functions of the polity. The divine authority invested within the ruler was such that the king was able to mobilize both the aristocracy and commoners in executing huge infrastructure projects, apparently with no police force or standing army. Some polities engaged in a strategy of increasing administration, and filling administrative posts with loyal supporters rather than blood relatives. Within a polity, mid-ranking population centres would have {{played a key role in}} managing resources and internal conflict.|$|E
