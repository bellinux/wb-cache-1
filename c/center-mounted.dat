5|$|The {{ejection}} seat is {{a version of}} the ACES II (Advanced Concept Ejection Seat) commonly used in USAF aircraft, with a <b>center-mounted</b> ejection control. The F-22 has a complex life support system, which includes the on-board oxygen generation system (OBOGS), protective pilot garments, and a breathing regulator/anti-g (BRAG) valve controlling flow and pressure to the pilot's mask and garments. The pilot garments were developed under the Advanced Technology Anti-G Suit (ATAGS) project and are to protect against chemical/biological hazards and cold-water immersion, counter g-forces and low pressure at high altitudes, and provide thermal relief. Suspicions regarding the performance of the OBOGS and life support equipment have been raised by several mishaps, including a fatal crash.|$|E
25|$|In {{order to}} keep the {{interior}} uncluttered, a number of convenience functions were integrated into multifunction controls. For example, the power windows and mirrors were controlled by a single instrument. Also, the <b>center-mounted</b> instrument cluster was canted slightly toward the driver. The displacement of these gauges {{to the middle of the}} dash was intended to offer an unimpeded view of the hood and the road ahead.|$|E
25|$|In 1989, Deere {{replaced}} the 6620, 7720, and 8820 {{with a new}} line of completely redesigned 'Maximizer' combines that included the 9400, 9500, and 9600 walker combines. These combines were completely redesigned and featured a <b>center-mounted</b> cab, rear-mounted engine, and more comforts in the cab. Also in 1989, Deere was inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame. In 1997, Deere celebrated 50 years of self-propelled combine production, and the 1997 models featured a 50th-anniversary decal. In 1998, the 9410, 9510, and 9610 were introduced. These were essentially the same machines, but with minor upgrades. Deere dealers offered '10 series' upgrades to owners of older 9000 series Maximizer combines. In 1999, Deere introduced the 50 series Maximizer combines. These machines featured significant cosmetic upgrades including a more streamlined appearance, improved ergonomics in the cab, PTO shaft-style header hook-up, and the larger models were available as rotary machines which were a complete departure from the combines that Deere had built in the past.|$|E

50|$|For side-mount chinrests, {{the clamp}} {{is placed on}} the bass side of the instrument; <b>center-mount</b> rests are placed so that the chinrest {{straddles}} the tailpiece. The latter may be considered a safer installation, as the clamps get support from the bottom block, and there is less chance that overtightening will cause damage.|$|R
500|$|The pilot flies {{primarily}} {{by means of}} an armrest-mounted side-stick controller (instead of a traditional <b>center-mounted</b> stick) and an engine throttle; conventional rudder pedals are also employed. To enhance the pilot's degree of control of the aircraft during high-g combat maneuvers, various switches and function controls were moved to centralised [...] "hands on throttle-and-stick (HOTAS)" [...] controls upon both the controllers and the throttle. Hand pressure on the side-stick controller is transmitted by electrical signals via the FBW system to adjust various flight control surfaces to maneuver the F-16. Originally the side-stick controller was non-moving, but this proved uncomfortable and difficult for pilots to adjust to, sometimes resulting in a tendency to [...] "over-rotate" [...] during takeoffs, so the control stick was given a small amount of [...] "play". Since introduction on the F-16, HOTAS controls have become a standard feature on modern fighters.|$|E
2500|$|The most {{significant}} change for 1967 was Buick's replacement of its venerable 425 [...] "nailhead" [...] with {{an entirely new}} [...] V8. [...] Its [...] and [...] of torque were a significant performance improvement. Gasoline mileage improved slightly, but remained low. Powerful disc brakes with Bendix four-piston calipers became optional for the front wheels but most Riviera continued to be ordered with Buick's highly capable ribbed aluminum brake drums. Cosmetically, changes were few, and were limited to {{the addition of a}} wide, full-width, <b>center-mounted</b> horizontal chrome grille bar that stretched over the headlight doors and outboard parking lights. Sales eased to 42,799 for the 1967 model year. The Riviera had full instrumentation.|$|E
2500|$|The 1970 Javelins {{featured}} a new front-end design {{with a wide}} [...] "twin-venturi" [...] front grille incorporating the headlamps and a longer hood. It also had a new rear end with full-width taillamps and a single <b>center-mounted</b> backup light. This was a one-year-only design. Side marker lights were now shared with several other AMC models. The exterior rear view mirror {{featured a}} new [...] "aero" [...] design {{and in some cases}} matched the car's body color. The three [...] "Big Bad" [...] exterior paints continued to be optional on the 1970 Javelins, but they now came with regular chrome bumpers. Underneath the restyle was a new front suspension featuring ball joints, upper and lower control arms, coil springs, and shock absorbers above the upper control arms, as well as trailing struts on the lower control arms.|$|E
50|$|The {{machine oil}} tank is <b>center-mounted</b> {{in the rear}} float section.|$|E
5000|$|Previas {{were also}} the first van to pass all US safety {{standards}} as pertaining to front impact, driver air bag, passenger air bag, <b>center-mounted</b> brake light, ABS, daylights, etc.|$|E
50|$|In 2011, Thomas {{marked the}} {{introduction}} of the Saf-T-Liner EFX, its first all-new front-engine bus since 1994. Using similar design features as the Saf-T-Liner HDX (its windshield and upper bodywork), the EFX also utilized a <b>center-mounted</b> Freightliner instrument panel.|$|E
50|$|According to the company's website, the Enigma has an , <b>center-mounted</b> 8-cylinder engine. It has a {{top speed}} of 340 km/h (211 mph). The body and chassis are made of carbon fiber and Kevlar, giving the Enigma a total weight of 1,240 kg.|$|E
50|$|The wing {{is built}} from {{aluminum}} tubing {{and covered with}} pre-sewn Dacron sailcloth envelopes. Controls are conventional three-axis, with dual controls and <b>center-mounted</b> control sticks. Lockwood offers optional flaps {{as part of its}} STOL kit. The single seat Drifter and XP503 are both stressed for +6/-3g.|$|E
50|$|The Aptera 2 Series {{featured}} optional roof-mounted {{solar panels}} {{for running a}} heat pump, always-on climate control, and keyless ignition and entry. An in-car touch screen computer served as entertainment, navigation, and communication system. Side mirrors replaced rear-view cameras on the final prototypes, though one <b>center-mounted</b> camera remained.|$|E
5000|$|The {{redesign}} of the Bronco for 1992 {{would include the}} addition of a number of safety features, including front crumple zones, three-point seatbelts for the rear seat, and a <b>center-mounted</b> rear brake light. In 1994, as with the F-150, the Bronco received a standard driver-side airbag and reinforced internal door beams.|$|E

50|$|The {{original}} powertrain layout {{mounted on}} the left at the rear was changed to a <b>center-mounted</b> powertrain, with ventilation through the roof on all LFS models starting in 2009. However, some demonstrators and test buses were built in 2008 with this update. In 2013 a new fourth generation rear layout was introduced and became standard mid 2013. Some early 2013 models were delivered with the third generation rear.|$|E
5000|$|The {{interior}} {{was inspired by}} spacecraft images and environments portrayed in 2001: A Space Odyssey, according to Ford. It {{is described as a}} [...] "lounge atmosphere", meant to provide a relaxing experience while traveling. The instrument panel includes flush-mounted, touch-sensitive controls and a single, multi-function gauge display with primary driving information. A <b>center-mounted</b> dual-view screen provides a camera view and secondary driver-oriented information, and also allows the front-seat passenger to view DVD movies and work on the Internet.|$|E
5000|$|The Reflex {{features}} 2+1 seating, with a <b>center-mounted</b> rear [...] "love seat" [...] for 2 {{children or}} one adult, {{that also includes}} a fold-out rear-facing child seat. [...] "Ford Reflex is a small car that doesn't feel small," [...] says Freeman Thomas, director, Ford North American Strategic Design. [...] "It is a gorgeous sporty car that delivers guilt free performance with a hybrid engine. And thanks to its innovative approach to the interior, it has space for growing families." ...|$|E
5000|$|The voltage {{applied to}} the {{deflection}} yoke is adjusted by various means (transformers, capacitors, center-tapped windings) so that the half-way voltage on the sawtooth's cliff is at the zero mark, meaning that a negative voltage will cause deflection in one direction, and a positive voltage deflection in the other; thus, a <b>center-mounted</b> deflection yoke can use the whole screen area to depict a trace. Frequency is 15.734 kHz on NTSC, 15.625 kHz for PAL and SECAM).|$|E
5000|$|GM used cast {{aluminum}} cylinder heads featuring 4 valves per cylinder. The heads used dual overhead cams driven through the [...] "maintenance-free" [...] cam-drive chain case. The cams act directly on hydraulic lifters {{on the ends}} of the valves and are fed with a lubrication passage drilled through the cylinder head lengthwise. The intake valves are inclined at 25°, while the exhaust valves are canted to 7° with <b>center-mounted</b> platinum-tipped spark plugs. The cam covers are magnesium for light weight and sound damping.|$|E
5000|$|The e-volo VC-2 (or VC-200) is {{the second}} {{in a series of}} {{multirotor}} designs from the German company e-volo. The single-place, 16 motor, all-electric e-volo VC1 [...] "Volocopter" [...] was demonstrated on 21 October 2011. The VC2 is the next follow-on with 18 engines suspended around an aluminum truss frame that includes a <b>center-mounted</b> seat, battery, and Battery Management Unit. The proof-of-concept aircraft will be used to develop the E-volo VC Evolution 2P, a two-passenger enclosed volocopter with extended range and weight capabilities.|$|E
5000|$|The {{aluminium}} bodywork {{was done}} by Rocco Motto. It was a one-piece two-seater with an elegant, sinuous, sporting shape. The large <b>center-mounted</b> grille {{was made up of}} seventeen vertical bars, and was flanked by large headlights. The streamlined broad front defines the lines that drop to the rear wheels affecting even the doors. Instead of a fixed windshield, Bandini chose to fit two [...] "slides". The rear wheels are particularly pronounced, while the rear is low and tapered. The wheels are Borrani wires.|$|E
50|$|The {{aircraft}} {{is built}} from tubing {{and includes a}} partial cockpit fairing. The side-by-side seating configuration is unusual in powered parachutes, but was intended to make dual instruction easier. In flight steering is accomplished via dual foot pedals that actuate the canopy brakes, creating roll and yaw. On the ground the aircraft has a <b>center-mounted</b> bicycle handlebar that controls the nosewheel steering. The main landing gear incorporates steel spring rod suspension. The aircraft was factory supplied {{in the form of}} an assembly kit or could be delivered ready-to-fly.|$|E
50|$|While {{using the}} same two-box layout and proportions, the 1992 {{redesign}} of the E-Series was given a far more aerodynamic body than its predecessor. Although Ford utilized the longest forward body of any full-size van, the hood was angled downward slightly and the windshield raked back; if specified, all side window glass was flush-mounted. For the first time, the E-Series utilized flush-mounted wraparound taillights and flush-mounted headlights (the latter were an option, standard on Club Wagons). In addition, the E-Series was the first full-size van to utilize a <b>center-mounted</b> brake light.|$|E
50|$|The {{interior}} of the new, larger, X5 is completely new. It has a large <b>center-mounted</b> display screen and the simplified iDrive, a man-machine interface system {{also found in the}} rest of the BMW model range. The E70 further incorporates many comfort options such as a glass panorama-roof, and, for the first time in a BMW, an optional third row seat which has increased the seating capacity in E70 to 7 passengers, addressing criticism of the E53 model which had been regarded as being slightly too small for this market segment.|$|E
50|$|A mini sprint is an American type of open-wheel racing vehicle. Mini sprint cars {{resemble}} {{the shape of}} a full-size sprint car and the size of a midget car. Although often used liberally to describe several different types of motorcycle-powered open-wheel racing cars, the term mini sprint actually applies to cars that have an upright-style chassis (the driver sits upright in the seat as in a sprint or midget), a <b>center-mounted</b> 4-cylinder motorcycle engine and dimensions and appearance that are similar to today’s midget. Mini sprints are chain driven and use 13 in wheels and tires.|$|E
5000|$|D. H. [...] "Dave" [...] Ward founded Ward Body Works in Conway, Arkansas in 1933 when he [...] "lowered {{the roof}} of a wooden bus for Mr. Carl Brady of the Southside Schools". Southside Schools were located about 15 miles north of Conway. [...] A {{blacksmith}} by trade, Ward grew his business primarily on body repair of bus bodies in the area. [...] In 1936, he built his first complete school bus body. One of the first manufacturers of the time to use all-metal construction, the first school bus made by Ward Body Works featured removable safety-glass windows and perimeter and <b>center-mounted</b> seating.|$|E
5000|$|Double-tension is {{a method}} of {{applying}} tension to drum heads. Drum manufacturers use several methods to apply tension to drum heads; the preferred way is to tighten the heads with a hoop that is held tight to the drum shell {{with a number of}} individual threaded rods which connect to stanchions mounted with bolts onto the outside of the drum shell. When there are individual stanchions for both the lower head and the upper [...] "struck" [...] head, or when there is one common <b>center-mounted</b> stanchion that accepts the threaded rods from both the upper and lower drum heads, that {{is said to be a}} double-tension drum.|$|E
5000|$|The Lockheed L-1011 TriStar, {{commonly}} referred to as the L-1011 (pronounced [...] "L-ten-eleven") or TriStar, is a medium-to-long-range, wide-body trijet airliner by Lockheed Corporation. It was the third wide-body airliner to enter commercial operations, after the Boeing 747 and the McDonnell Douglas DC-10. The airliner has a seating capacity up to 400 passengers and a range over 4000 nmi km. Its trijet configuration has three Rolls-Royce RB211 engines with one engine under each wing, and a third engine, <b>center-mounted</b> with an S-duct air inlet embedded in the tail and the upper fuselage.

Their contribution to the programme consisted of a modified 9000 with the steering wheel replaced with a <b>center-mounted</b> joystick. This setup removed the risk of body and facial injury {{in the event of an}} accident. It also provided easier and cheaper airbag installation, as well as improved instrument panel visibility. This prototype was tested by Jeremy Clarkson in an episode of Top Gear; the segment was revisited in Series 18, Episode 5 of the current Top Gear series, where Clarkson and James May paid tribute to the fallen automotive marque.|$|E
5000|$|The XP-100 {{was based}} on Remington's short action bolt action carbine, the Remington Model 40X, which {{influenced}} the later Remington Model 600 rifle. [...] The XP-100 was initially introduced with a 10¾" [...] barrel set into a nylon stock with an unusual <b>center-mounted</b> grip. Chambered in [...]222 Remington in early prototypes, the short barrel produced significant noise and muzzle flash. Subsequently the case was shortened to reduce powder capacity to a volume more suited to the shorter barrel of a pistol. The resulting cartridge, the [...]221 Fireball, produced factory loaded velocities of over 825 m/s (2,700 ft/s) from the short barrel, and accuracy rivaling the parent [...]222 Remington, {{one of the most}} accurate cartridges made.|$|E
