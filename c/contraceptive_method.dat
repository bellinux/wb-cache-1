2500|$|The condom is {{the most}} popular form of {{contraception}} used by teenagers. Among sexually active 15- to 19-year-olds, from 2002 to 2010 more than 80% of females and more than 90% of males reported using at least one method of birth control during their last intercourse. In 1995, only 71% of girls and 82% of boys reported using contraception the last time they had sex. In 2006–2010, one in five sexually active female teens (20%) and one-third of sexually active male teens (34%) reported having used both the condom and a hormonal method the last time they had sex. [...] Less than 20% of girls at risk for unintended pregnancy were not using any <b>contraceptive</b> <b>method</b> the last time they had sex.

40|$|Background: Kahama {{district}} in Shinyanga region has Contraceptive Prevalence Rate (CPR) of 16 %, {{which is far}} {{below the national average}} of 27 %. Little is known on factors contributing to the low level of utilization of contraceptives in Kahama district, and particularly among women in stable marital relations. Objectives: To determine the prevalence of current use of <b>contraceptive</b> <b>methods</b> among women in stable marital relations attending health facilities; describe the types of <b>contraceptive</b> <b>methods</b> used among women in stable marital relations attending health facilities; assess socio-cultural factors (beliefs including religious, husband’s approval, and spouse communication) in relation to use of <b>contraceptive</b> <b>methods</b> among women in stable marital relations attending health facilities; determine the association between socio–demographic factors (age, occupation, education level, access, number of children) and use of <b>contraceptive</b> <b>methods</b> among women in stable marital relations attending health facilities. Methods: A cross-sectional study on <b>contraceptive</b> <b>methods</b> use was conducted among 314 women and 20 service providers in ten wards from ten health facilities. Data were collected using structured and in-depth interview questionnaires. Information gathered included socio-demographic, socio – cultural characteristics, accessibility of <b>contraceptive</b> <b>methods,</b> current use and access to information. Results: Thirty five percent of women in stable marital relations reported to be using <b>contraceptive</b> <b>methods.</b> Highest (58 %) use of contraceptives was reported among women in formal employment. Factors found to be significantly associated with contraceptive use were: education level, occupation, traditional cultural beliefs, and support from husband/partners and access to information while religion, decision maker on desired number of children in the family were not found to be significantly {{associated with the use of}} <b>contraceptive</b> <b>methods.</b> Conclusion: Prevalence of contraceptive use among women in stable marital relations is 34. 5 % than that in the general population of women with the age of 15 - 49 years inKahama district (16 %, 2011 district report). Socio-demographic factors like education level and occupation were found to influence the use of <b>contraceptive</b> <b>methods</b> among women in stable marital relations. Moreover, socio-cultural factors like religious beliefs and husband/partner support were also crucial in influencing the use of <b>contraceptive</b> <b>methods.</b> Recommendations: District Health Management teams should develop interventions that will enable women in stable marital relations to understand the importance of using <b>contraceptive</b> <b>methods.</b> Since this study did not involve men, further studies are needed to determine the extent of use of <b>contraceptive</b> <b>methods</b> among men and associated factors...|$|R
