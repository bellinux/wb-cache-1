25|$|The ICAR 36 was a high-wing {{cantilever}} monoplane {{of mixed}} construction, with a closed cockpit, single engine, and fixed landing gear. It had a welded steel tube fuselage, covered with plywood, and tapered single-spar, plywood-covered wings. The crew of two {{sat in the}} <b>cockpit,</b> <b>forward</b> of the wing, which was equipped with a radio and could be fitted with twin controls. The cabin for six passengers, with wide rectangular windows and access doors at the rear, was aft and below the cockpit / wings. There were also two baggage compartments.|$|E
2500|$|Leading French {{constructor}} Matra {{based their}} 4WD {{car on the}} MS80 with which they won the [...] Constructors' Championship, and {{from the rear of}} the <b>cockpit</b> <b>forward</b> the cars looked virtually identical, save for the driveshaft to the front wheels. At the back the engine was mounted back-to-front with the gearbox directly behind the driver, but tellingly the Ferguson transmission [...] and other necessary additions left the car 10% heavier than the two-wheel drive sister cars. Like the Lotus 63, the MS84 made its first appearance at the Dutch Grand Prix, where Jackie Stewart tried the car out but opted to use his MS80, as he would for the rest of the season.|$|E
2500|$|To {{deliver the}} fuel, two Douglas C-1 {{single-engine}} transports were also modified, s/n 25-428 designated [...] "Refueling Airplane No. 1" [...] and s/n 25-432 as [...] "Refueling Airplane No. 2." [...] The biplane C-1s were {{evolved from the}} Douglas World Cruiser design, with the pilots side-by-side in an open <b>cockpit</b> <b>forward</b> of the wing. Two [...] tanks were installed in their cargo compartments, attached to a lead-weighted [...] length of [...] fire hose. The nozzle of the hose had a quick-closing valve on the tanker's end and was tightly wrapped with copper wire, one end {{of which could be}} attached to a corresponding copper plate mounted in Question Mark to ground the hose. The C-1's would each carry a third crewman in the cargo compartment to reel out the hose, lower a supply rope, and to work the shutoff valve.|$|E
5000|$|Improved {{visibility}} as the <b>cockpits</b> are <b>forward</b> of the swept wings.|$|R
50|$|Crew {{accommodation}} {{was rather}} {{like that of}} the Valkyrie and the Southampton, with dual control tandem open <b>cockpits</b> <b>forward</b> of the wings, a gunner's position in the extreme nose and two staggered dorsal gunner's cockpits aft of the wings. Since the A.14's purpose was that of a hull demonstrator, the armament was probably never installed.|$|R
2500|$|Skylark 3B: <b>cockpit</b> moved <b>forward</b> 76mm, {{overall length}} {{increase}} by 80mm. 24 built.|$|R
2500|$|The Bison was {{designed}} to meet British Specification 3/21 for a carrier-based fleet spotter and reconnaissance aircraft. An order for three prototypes was placed in October 1921, together with three of the competing design from Blackburn Aircraft, the Blackburn Blackburn. Avro's design, the Type 555 Bison, was a two-bay biplane, powered, like the Blackburn, by a Napier Lion engine. The deep slab-sided fuselage was constructed of steel tube, with the pilot sitting in an open <b>cockpit</b> <b>forward</b> of the wings, and the engine cowling sloping steeply down ahead of the pilot. [...] An enclosed cabin with large rectangular windows on each side housed the navigator and radio operator and all their equipment, with sufficient headroom to stand upright, while a cockpit for a gunner armed with a Lewis gun on a Scarff ring was provided in the rear fuselage. [...] The upper wings were mounted directly {{on the top of}} the fuselage.|$|E
2500|$|The R.B.1 was a three-engined, three-bay biplane. The equal-span wings were {{of mixed}} wood-and-metal construction, with ailerons fitted to both {{upper and lower}} wings and floats fitted under the wingtips, while the {{aircraft}} had a large biplane tail (with a span of 30ft (9.14 m) with three fins and rudders. [...] The aircraft's hull had a wooden structure covered in plywood, with a V-bottom with two steps to give good water handling. [...] Three 650hp (485kW) Rolls-Royce Condor III water-cooled V12 engines driving four-bladed propellers were mounted in individual nacelles between the wings. It carried a crew of five, with two pilots sitting {{side by side in}} a <b>cockpit</b> <b>forward</b> of the wings, with nose and dorsal gun positions mounting Lewis guns on Scarff rings, with provision for a further two guns which could be operated through portholes in the rear fuselage. [...] Bomb racks under the wings could carry up to 1,040lb (470kg) of bombs.|$|E
2500|$|In 1937, the German Ministry of Aviation {{issued a}} {{specification}} for a short-range, three-seat reconnaissance aircraft {{with a good}} allround view to support the German army in the field, replacing the Henschel Hs 126, which had just entered service. [...] A power of about 850–900hp (630–670kW) was specified. The specification was issued to Arado and Focke-Wulf. [...] Arado's design, the Ar 198, which was initially the preferred option, was a relatively conventional single-engined high-wing monoplane with a glazed gondola under the fuselage. [...] Focke-Wulf's chief designer Kurt Tank's design, the Fw 189, was a twin-boom design, powered by two Argus As 410 engines instead of with an expected single engine. As a [...] "twin-boom" [...] design like the earlier Dutch Fokker G.I from 1938, the Fw 189 used a central crew gondola for its crew accommodation, which for the Fw 189 would be designed with a heavily glazed and framed [...] "stepless" [...] <b>cockpit</b> <b>forward</b> section, which used no separate windscreen panels for the pilot (as with many German medium bombers from 1938 onwards). Blohm & Voss, however, proposed as a private venture something even more radical: chief designer Dr. Richard Vogt's unique asymmetric BV 141. Orders were placed for three prototypes, each of the Arado and Focke-Wulf designs, in April 1937.|$|E
25|$|Revised {{production}} {{version with}} <b>cockpit</b> moved <b>forwards.</b> Navy designation Navy Type 10-2 Carrier Fighter.|$|R
50|$|The CW-12 and CW-16 {{shared the}} same basic design as {{conventional}} single-bay biplanes with staggered wings braced with N-struts. The pilot and instructor sat in tandem, open <b>cockpits,</b> the <b>forward</b> <b>cockpit</b> of the CW-12 having a single seat, while the CW-16's <b>forward</b> <b>cockpit</b> could seat two passengers side-by-side. Both versions of the aircraft were available {{in a variety of}} engine choices, and some CW-16s were exported as trainers to the air forces of Bolivia and Ecuador.|$|R

50|$|Training {{version with}} an {{additional}} <b>cockpit</b> <b>forward</b> of the normal one, {{in place of a}} radar. ten built and four converted from standard interceptors.|$|E
50|$|Placing the <b>cockpit</b> <b>forward</b> of {{the wing}} to balance {{the weight of the}} engine(s) aft {{improves}} visibility for the crew. Similarly any front armament can be used more easily..|$|E
50|$|The R.VII, an {{incremental}} improvement on the almost identical Zeppelin-Staaken R.IV, had two engine pods, each with tandem pusher engines, {{large enough for}} some inflight maintenance by flight mechanics housed in <b>cockpits</b> <b>forward</b> of the nacelle engines, driving the large pusher propellers throuch clutches, gearboxes and shafts. A further two engines were mounted in {{the nose of the}} fuselage, driving a single tractor propeller in similar fashion.|$|R

50|$|An-2V (Vysotnyy - high altitude) - Six {{aircraft}} were built, at the Kiev factory, as weather reconnaissance An-2V's for use at high altitude. Powered by the ASh-62IR/TK turbo-charged engine, they {{differed from}} the 'An-6 Meteo' by not having the observers <b>cockpit</b> <b>forward</b> of the fin.|$|E
50|$|The CAMS 31 was a wooden-built two-bay equal span biplane with {{stabilising}} floats {{under each}} wing {{and an open}} <b>cockpit</b> <b>forward</b> of the lower-wing for the pilot. Powered by a Hispano-Suiza 8Fb inline piston engine driving a pusher propeller, the engine was strut mounted between the wings. The CAMS 31 was armed with two fixed hull-mounted Vickers machine-guns in the bow.|$|E
5000|$|The 500L {{platform}} {{was based}} on Fiat's [...] "Small" [...] platform, first used with the Fiat Grande Punto, and further developed since its launch in 2005. With the 500L, the platform is both longer and wider, to accommodate the 500L's cab forward architecture. The concept prioritizes interior volume and reduction of the vehicles volume dedicated to mechanicals, moving the <b>cockpit</b> <b>forward,</b> {{toward the front of}} the car.|$|E
50|$|The XT3D torpedo bomber (BuNo 8730) {{was first}} flown in 1931, {{it has been}} {{described}} as a large and ugly aircraft. Of metal construction with a fabric covering the XT3D had folding wings and an arrestor hook for carrier operation. With a fixed tailwheel landing gear and powered by a Pratt & Whitney R-1690 Hornet radial engine, the XT3D had three open <b>cockpits,</b> <b>forward</b> for the gunner/bomb-aimer, centre for the pilot, rear for another gunner.|$|R
50|$|The {{pilot was}} {{accommodated}} {{in an open}} <b>cockpit</b> just <b>forward</b> of the wings, and the passengers sat in an enclosed cabin further forward.|$|R
50|$|In US Navy or US Coast Guard service, the craft’s crew {{comprised}} two gunners and the coxswain. Though the gunners {{would normally}} occupy the two gunner's <b>cockpits,</b> <b>forward,</b> during landing, they had other duties also. One acted as the bowman {{while the other}} served as the mechanic. The coswain {{was in charge of}} the boat and crew. His position was at the wheel directly behind the gunner's cockpits and only slightly off-set to the port side. From here he steered and operated engine controls.|$|R
50|$|The pilot sat {{in an open}} <b>cockpit</b> <b>forward</b> of {{the wing}} for optimum {{visibility}} during deck landings and behind him in an enclosed, windowed cabin were the navigator and wireless operator, who could access an open gunner's position further aft. The pilot was able to enter the cabin if needed, {{in which case the}} navigator could fly the aircraft from a rear folding seat provided with duplicate controls.|$|E
5000|$|In early 1929, Fokker {{designed}} and built a prototype of a single-engine cargo aircraft, probably to meet a requirement from KLM. The F.XIV was a high-wing monoplane powered by a [...] Gnome-Rhône Jupiter VI radial engine and had a fixed tailwheel undercarriage. Two pilots sat in an enclosed <b>cockpit</b> <b>forward</b> of the wing's leading edge, while the aircraft's cabin could carry 1240 kg in a 5 m long cabin.|$|E
50|$|Farman Aviation Works {{designed}} and built in 1924 what was a bulky unequal span two-bay biplane {{for use as a}} day bomber. The pilot had a <b>cockpit</b> <b>forward</b> of the wing leading edge, the observer/gunner had a cockpit in a cut-out in the wing trailing edge. The B.2 was tested with different combinations of engines and radiators and it required modification to the fin and rudder for problems with directional stability. Despite all these modifications the aircraft did not meet the required performance and was not ordered into production.|$|E

50|$|Wiweko Soepono, {{a former}} Garuda Indonesia director, {{is also known}} as {{inventor}} of the modern two-man <b>cockpit</b> design (<b>Forward</b> Facing Crew Cockpit/FFCC) for Garuda Indonesia Airbus A300 aircraft.|$|R
5000|$|... (Oochebno Trenirovochnyy Istrebitel' [...] - fighter trainer) - Factory-built two-seat trainer version, front <b>cockpit</b> moved <b>forwards,</b> dual {{controls}} fitted, 20 built in 1934 but not used by VVS ...|$|R
50|$|Later in 1911 the {{aircraft}} was modified to include another <b>cockpit</b> <b>forward</b> {{of the pilot}} for a passenger. The wingspan was increased and the modified aircraft was re-designated the Flanders F.3. It flew successfully {{for a number of}} months until it was destroyed in a fatal accident on 13 May 1912 when Mr. E.V.B Fisher was piloting it with an American passenger Mr. Mason when it crashed at Brooklands killing them both. In 1912 the War Office ordered four monoplanes based on the F.3 and designated the Flanders F.4.|$|E
5000|$|The B-D 22 was an unequal span biplane {{powered by}} two [...] Hispano-Suiza inline piston engines. It had an open <b>cockpit</b> <b>forward</b> of the wings {{for the pilot}} and {{co-pilot}} to sit side-by-side and gunner's positions midships and at the bow and the wings could be folded for stowage. The French Naval aviation ordered five and designated them as the HB.3 although {{they appear to have}} been little used. A commercial transport version was developed with the gunner's positions removed and a cabin for six passengers installed behind the pilot's cockpit.|$|E
50|$|After the {{relative}} {{success of the}} FVA-1 Schwatze Düvel and FVA-2 Blaue Maus, Wolfgang Klemperer designed and built the canard FVA-3 Ente. Using similar construction methods to the earlier gliders, Klemperer built the FVA-3 from wood with fabric covering, the thick cantilevered mainplane supporting a wide fuselage, extending forwards from the centre section, enclosing the side-by side <b>cockpit</b> <b>forward</b> of the mainplane and supporting the forward plane which was mounted on spherical bearings to provide control in pitch and yaw. On the ground the FVA-3 was supported by two fixed skids faired by large trousers similar to the FVA-1 and FVA-2.|$|E
50|$|Developed as {{an updated}} version of the Savoia S.16 for the Regia Aeronauticas {{maritime}} patrol squadrons. A biplane flying boat the S.59 had two side-by-side <b>cockpits</b> <b>forward</b> of the wings and a low cockpit fitted with a 7.7 mm (.303 in) Lewis Gun. The prototype was powered by a 268 kW (360 hp) Rolls-Royce Eagle engine and first flew in 1925. It was underpowered and 40 production aircraft were built with a 298 kW (400 hp) Lorraine-Dietrich 12Db V12 engine which did not cure the limited performance but the first aircraft was delivered in 1926.|$|R
50|$|The Vancouver was {{developed}} {{as a replacement for}} the Varuna in response to a Royal Canadian Air Force requirement for a flying boat to transport men and equipment to forest fires. The main difference from the Varuna was a duralumin hull and more powerful engines. The two flight crew were located in two tandem open <b>cockpits,</b> <b>forward</b> of the wing. The main cabin could accommodate a firefighting team of six men and all the required equipment. Five aircraft were delivered to the Royal Canadian Air Force, one was later converted into a coastal patrol aircraft.|$|R
50|$|Simulation of the ARH Eurocopter Tiger {{flight model}} was {{improved}} in VBS3 v3.4 and 3.6. These include {{improvements to the}} <b>cockpit</b> system, <b>forward</b> air refueling points, and weapon simulations.|$|R
