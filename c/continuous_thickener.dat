40|$|Sludges {{resulting}} from {{water and wastewater}} treatment processes consist of agglomerated individual particles producing aggregates of various sizes and densities. Particle size, particle density, aggregate size and aggregate density are characteristics which determine the amenability of a suspension to continuous gravity thickening. To investigate {{the effects of these}} suspension characteristics on compression zone behavior, precipitation softening water treatment sludges and diatomaceous earth suspensions were gravity thickened in a pilot-scale <b>continuous</b> <b>thickener.</b> The effects of raking on thickening performance in the compression zone and the effects of suspension characteristics on channeling were also investigated;The behavior of the sludges in the compression zone of the <b>continuous</b> <b>thickener</b> was characterized using sludge concentration profiles and permeability and compressibility relationships. Suspension aggregate size and density were evaluated using a velocity-voidage correlation for hindered settling of the suspensions;When judged {{on the basis of the}} sludge concentration profiles and resulting underflow concentrations from the <b>continuous</b> <b>thickener,</b> the thickening performance of the sludges examined in this investigation was significantly affected by the sludge aggregate characteristics. Correlations between aggregate characteristics and permeability and compressibility explained the differences in thickening behavior;The occurrence of channeling in the compression zone was a function of aggregate characteristics for the diatomaceous earth suspensions, whereas compression zone channeling occurred for all softening sludges examined in this investigation, regardless of aggregate properties;Raking the compression zone obliterated channeling, causing poorer thickening performance of those suspensions which channeled in the compression zone...|$|E

40|$|Based on {{the steady}} {{state and the}} {{transient}} solutions of the phenomenological theory of sedimentation, a software was developed for the design and simulation of batch and continuous thickening. The paper presents {{a brief description of}} the phenomenological theory of sedimentation and its application to batch and continuous thickening with two appropriate initial and boundary con-ditions. The software permits the simulation of batch sedimentation and the design and simulation of <b>continuous</b> <b>thickeners.</b> For batch thickening, the initial and critical concentration and the height of the initial suspension have to be entered together with the parameters of the flux density function and the effective solid stress. The output is a settling plot showing as many lines of constant concentration as requested and a plot of the concentration profile for several times. For continuous thickening, the program cal-culates the unit area and the area of a thickener required to treat a given feed rate. The input is the solid feed rate and the required underflow concentration, together with the thickening parameters. One example shows the application...|$|R
40|$|Phenomena {{that involve}} the {{settling}} of particulates {{in a host}} fluid are encountered in many practical systems which find applications {{in many areas of}} industry. A numerical model has been developed to simulate the settlement of non-flocculated particulate suspensions in batch sedimentation. The non-flocculated mode of the model is extended to predict the performance of a continuous gravity thickener. The various particle species within the particulate susepnsion are represented as separate phases with distinct concentrations and velocities. A multiphase representation of the settling process gives greater detail of the interactions present between the particulates. The build up of the sediment as well as a prediction of the compression point for flocculated suspensions, is modelled using a revised version of packing theory. The build up of floes in the free setting region is incorporated via population balances. Also, as well as the above theoretical work, experimental work has been undertaken to obtain data for non-flocculated suspensions. For batch sedimentation this data {{is in the form of}} density profiles and for the <b>continuous</b> <b>thickener</b> it is in the form of concentration profiles. The proposed model compares favourably with this experimental data and gives closer predictions than does a model representing the state of the art, at this point in time, for non-flocculated batch sedimentation...|$|E
40|$|The {{ability to}} {{economically}} thicken a sludge {{to the desired}} concentration and the accuracy with which <b>continuous</b> <b>thickener</b> performance can be predicted from batch settling data are governed by the flocculent nature of the suspension. A number of variables contribute to the flocculent nature of a suspension and the tendency {{for the formation of}} particle-particle attachments results in aggregate formation at low suspension concentrations and the formation of compressible sediments at high concentrations;An investigation was conducted in which the batch settling characteristics of a laboratory-prepared suspension were determined {{as a function of the}} magnitude of the flocculent nature, as governed by the dosage of a low-molecular-weight polyelectrolyte, and the intensity of mixing prior to settling. The results were quantified in terms of the characteristics of the aggregates which formed during settling as estimated by the application of a velocity-voidage correlation for the hindered settling of spherical particles;Two distinct modes of batch settling behavior were observed. At low concentrations, the suspensions underwent hindered settling as an assemblage of aggregates whose size and density were a function of the polyelectrolyte dosage. The intensity of mixing prior to settling had no direct effect on the aggregate properties. At intermediate and higher concentrations, the interaggregate porosity remained constant and the aggregate buoyant densities were inversely proportional to the aggregate diameters raised to some power [...] a diameter-density relationship that resulted from the basic aggregate structure and that was a function of the polyelectrolyte dosage and not of the intensity of pretreatment mixing;The role of aggregate formation in batch settling of flocculent suspensions was conceptually modeled and the effects of suspension concentration on the initial batch settling velocity were quantified for the two modes of settling. An expression was derived for constant interaggregate porosity settling in which the settling velocity was shown to be a function of the particle and fluid properties and the aggregate diameter-density relationship...|$|E

The thickening and filtration operations in these processes are still not completely understood. The successful design and operation consolidation equipment {{must be based on}} the properties of the target suspension. The quantitative characterisation of suspensions in settling and compression was the prime objective of this thesis. In a general consolidation model, the behaviour of suspensions in settling and con 1 pression is fully defined by two parameters; the compressive yield stress function and the hindered settling function. The compressive yield stress quantifies the strength of the suspension network in compression and determines the maximum concentration achievable for any given applied force. The hindered settling function quantifies the hydrodynamic drag forces experienced by consolidating particles in the suspension and determines the settling velocity and the time scale for the consolidation process. These suspension consolidation parameters were determined using a variety of techniques. For measurement of the compressive yield stress, two centrifuge based techniques and a pressure filtration technique were evaluated both independently and with each other - with good results. It was thus verified that the compressive yield stress is a material property of suspensions in compression. For measurement of the hindered settling function, two pressure filtration techniques were developed using a custom built apparatus. Measurements were successfully made using these techniques for the first time. The materials used in the study were three aqueous metal oxide suspensions systems; Zr 02, Ti 02 and A 120 3. The shear and compression rheology of these systems is fully controlled by manipulation of the particle surface chemistry which changes the suspension micro-structure. The validity of the general consolidation model was systematically studied using suspensions prepared under various conditions. Factors studied were the effects of flocculation state, initial concentration, steric stabilisation, suspension preparation methods and prior shear and compression history. These factors affected the compression rheology to varying degrees and were quantified. The conditions for maximum consolidation were determined. A correlation between shear and compression rheology also generated a useful empirical relationship {{that can be used in}} design and operation of consolidation equipment. Finally, the measurement of the compressive yield stress and hindered settling function of a suspension was applied to the prediction of the concentration profile and sediment height in an operating <b>continuous</b> <b>thickener.</b> With some refinement, the model and techniques used in this study are a viable means for design and optimisation of continuous thickeners based on the material properties of the suspension.
