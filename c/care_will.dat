25|$|The {{benefits}} of parental investment to the offspring {{are large and}} {{are associated with the}} effects on condition, growth, survival and ultimately, on reproductive success of the offspring. However, these benefits can come at the cost of parent's ability to reproduce in the future e.g. through the increased risk of injury when defending offspring against predators, the loss of mating opportunities whilst rearing offspring and an increase in the time to the next reproduction. Overall, parents are selected to maximize the difference between the benefits and the costs, and parental <b>care</b> <b>will</b> be likely to evolve when the benefits exceed the costs.|$|E

25|$|Thailand has {{observed}} global patterns of an enlarging elderly class: as fertility control is encouraged and medical advances are made, births shrink and lives age. The Thai government is noticing {{and concerned about}} this trend, but tends to let families care for their elderly members rather than create extraneous policies for them. As of 2011, there are only 25 state sponsored homes for the elderly, {{with no more than}} a few thousand members of each home. Such programs are largely run by volunteers and are questionable by quality of care, considering there is not always a guarantee <b>care</b> <b>will</b> be available. Private care is tough to follow, often based on assumptions. Because children are less likely to care for their parents, private caretakers are in demand. Volunteer NGOs are available but in very limited quantities.|$|E
25|$|When {{trustees}} fail {{in their}} main duties, the law imposes remedies {{according to the}} nature of the breach. In general, breaches of rules surrounding performance of the trust's terms can be remedied through an award of specific performance, or compensation. Breaches of the duty of <b>care</b> <b>will</b> trigger a right to compensation. Breaches of the duty to avoid conflicts of interest, and misapplications of property will give rise to a restitutionary claim, to restore the property taken away. In these last two situations, the courts of equity developed further principles of liability that could be applied even when a trustee had gone bankrupt. Some recipients of property that came from a breach of trust, as well as people who had assisted in a breach of trust, might incur liability. Equity recognised not merely a personal, but also a proprietary claim over assets taken in breach of trust, and perhaps also profits made in breach of the duty of loyalty. A proprietary claim meant that the claimant could demand the thing in priority to other creditors of the bankrupt trustee. Alternatively, the courts would follow an asset or trace its value if the trust property was exchanged for some other asset. If trust property had been given to a third party, the trust fund could claim back the property as of right, unless the recipient was a bona fide purchaser. Generally, any recipient of trust property who knew about the breach of trust (or maybe ought to have known) could be made to give back the value, even if they had themselves exchanged the thing for other assets. Lastly, against people who may never have received trust property but had assisted in a breach of trust, and had done so dishonestly, a claim arose to return the property's value.|$|E

They state further: [...] "however, most evidence for these roles comes from in vitro, animal, and epidemiological studies, not the randomized clinical trials considered to be more definitive.

[...] Few teenagers can withstand the cultural pressure which categorizes bottle feeding as a norm. Therefore, new teenage mothers need more concerted prenatal anticipatory guidance, specialized lactation education and an increase of face-to-face postpartum support. [...] To succeed with the task at hand, inpatient nursing <b>care</b> <b>will</b> have to be tailor to the unique needs of this population. [...] Positive perception of inpatient postpartum nursing care {{have been found to be}} an incredible influence in a young mother's success with breastfeeding. [...] In a study conducted in the United States, young mothers reported positive postpartum experiences, especially in respect to breastfeeding initiation and mother-infant bonding, when their nursing care was targeted for adolescent mothers. The mothers reported that they felt better cared for and more motivated to initiate and sustain breastfeeding when nurses where friendly, patient, respectful and understanding of their individual needs. [...] Maternal self-confidence is a contributing factor that influences positive breastfeeding outcomes especially among adolescent mothers. Empowerment, compassion, understanding and patience are key when caring for young moms.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the final}} quatrain, the poet begins to {{describe}} his downfall and continuing/ worsening sickness. The line [...] "Past cure I am, now reason is past care," [...] is a play on an old proverb which is usually read [...] "'past care, past cure' expressing the traditional wisdom, that, if a patient is incurable, <b>care</b> <b>will</b> not help him". [...] Many scholars have speculated what exactly the play on the common proverb means, since it is extremely unlikely Shakespeare misused a common and well known phrase. One could read the line as a potential marker for the madness the poet says is taking over his body, becoming so muddled and crazed with the fever, he can not even properly use a common saying. Scholars W.G. Ingram and Theodore Redpath also propose, [...] "Shakespeare is here not merely reproducing the proverb [...] [...] [...] but playing with it, for [...] [...] [...] he has here inverted it. The case is past cure, because the physician has ceased to care." [...] To further prove and point out the [...] "frantic-mad" [...] and [...] "random [...] "bablings" [...] of the poet past cure and care, G. Blakemore Evans observes that [...] "The poet's frenzied state of mind {{is illustrated by the}} harshly extreme indictment of his mistress in the following couplet." ...|$|E
2500|$|Some [...] "hospital services" [...] {{can be done}} as {{inpatient}} services, {{which would}} be reimbursed under Part A; or as outpatient services, which would be reimbursed, not under Part A, but under Part B instead. The [...] "Two-Midnight Rule" [...] decides which is which. In August 2013, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services announced a final rule concerning eligibility for hospital inpatient services effective October 1, 2013. Under the new rule, if a physician admits a Medicare beneficiary as an inpatient with an expectation that the patient will require hospital care that “crosses two midnights,” Medicare Part A payment is “generally appropriate.” However, if it is anticipated that the patient will require hospital care for less than two midnights, Medicare Part A payment is generally not appropriate; payment such as is approved will be paid under Part B. The time a patient spends in the hospital before an inpatient admission is formally ordered is considered outpatient time. But, hospitals and physicians can {{take into consideration the}} pre-inpatient admission time when determining if a patient’s <b>care</b> <b>will</b> reasonably be expected to cross two midnights to be covered under Part A. In addition to deciding which trust fund is used to pay for these various outpatient vs. inpatient charges, the number of days for which a person is formally considered an admitted patient affects eligibility for Part A skilled nursing services.|$|E

They have their own traditions to give us, formed in the society's work of teaching since 1802, and the fruit of the experience gathered, to speak only of Australia and New Zealand, of over 500 Brothers teaching more than 20,000 boys". Liston added, [...] " ... if I know the Brothers at all, the boys under their <b>care</b> <b>will</b> be put to hard work - an excellent thing - and teachers will not do for them what they should do for themselves.

Teachers will feel it their daily duty to fit the boys to bear life's burdens with a spirit of nobility and to meet life's problems with unfaltering courage".
