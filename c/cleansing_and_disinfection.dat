25|$|Macewen {{was born}} near Port Bannatyne, Isle of Bute, Scotland in 1848 and {{studied at the}} University of Glasgow, {{receiving}} a medical degree in 1872. He was greatly influenced by Joseph, Lord Lister (1827–1912), who revolutionised surgery by developing antisepsis, {{by the use of}} phenol, thus decreasing drastically the enormous mortality of surgical patients due to infections. By following Lister and adopting systematically the use of scrubbing (deep <b>cleansing</b> <b>and</b> <b>disinfection</b> of hands and arms), sterilisation of surgical tools, use of surgical gowns, and (recently discovered) anaesthesia, Macewen {{became one of the most}} innovative surgeons of his time and was able to greatly advance modern surgical technique and improve the recovery of patients.|$|E

Most widely used are the detergent solu-tions that incorporate materials such as hexachloro-phene and germicides such as the cationic quaternary ammonium solutions (the "quats"), that is, benzal-konium chloride (Zepharin®, Detergex®, Deter-gicide®) and phenolic germicide detergents (Am-phyl®, Tergisyl®, Staphene®). This control of environmental contamination is becoming increas-ingly important with the rising prevalence of op-portunistic infections, especially those caused by gram-negative bacilli such as Pseudomonas aeru-ginosa, other species of pseudomonas, Klebsiella...|$|E
40|$|Endoscopic {{procedures}} performed worldwide {{have increased}} considerably in recent years. In addition to diagnosis, many cases previously necessitating surgery now often {{can be carried}} out by endoscopic techniques. However, endoscopy has introduced its own infection risk. Most reports of gastrointestinal endoscopy-associated infection describe sepsis after endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) in patients with biliary tract obstruction. During this study, which was conducted by Infection Control Committee of Ankara University Hospital, 13 out of 1147 (1. 1 %) and 17 out of 922 patients (1. 8 %) had ERCP related sepsis in 2002 and 2003 respectively, at the ERCP Unit of Gastroenterology Department. Sepsis-caused mortality were 23. 1 and 29. 4 % in 2002 and 2003 respectively. The first four causative agents were Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas spp, Klebsiella spp and Enterobacter spp. Type and frequency of the causative agents remind that both endogenous and exogenous mechanisms are together responsible for the infections emerging from ERCP Unit. Besides, increasing isolation of Pseudomonas spp. brings out the strong need for re-evaluation of infection control measures, mainly effective <b>cleansing</b> <b>and</b> <b>disinfection</b> of endoscopes...|$|E
40|$|Campylobacter is {{responsible}} for human bacterial enteritis and poultry meat is recognised as a primary source of infection. In slaughterhouses, cleaning <b>and</b> <b>disinfection</b> procedures are performed daily, {{and it has been}} suggested that disinfectant molecules might select for antibiotic resistant strains if shared targets or combined resistance mechanisms were involved. The aim of the study was to investigate if cleaning <b>and</b> <b>disinfection</b> procedures in poultry slaughterhouses select for antibiotic resistance in Campylobacter jejuni and C. coli and to determine the genotypes of isolates collected after cleaning <b>and</b> <b>disinfection.</b> Nine sampling visits were made to four French slaughterhouses. Samples were collected from transport crates and equipment surfaces, before and after cleaning <b>and</b> <b>disinfection.</b> Minimal inhibitory concentrations of the recovered C. jejuni and C. coli isolates to six antibiotics and two disinfectants were measured. The C. jejuni isolates collected from equipment surfaces after cleaning <b>and</b> <b>disinfection</b> were subjected to PCR-RFLP typing. Twenty-five C. jejuni isolates and 1 C. coli were recovered from equipment surfaces after cleaning <b>and</b> <b>disinfection</b> during five visits to three different slaughterhouses. Those isolates did not show an increased resistance to the tested antibiotics compared to isolates collected before cleaning <b>and</b> <b>disinfection.</b> Only one or two genotypes were recovered after cleaning <b>and</b> <b>disinfection</b> during single visits to each slaughterhouse. This observation suggests that such genotypes may be particularly adapted to survive cleaning <b>and</b> <b>disinfection</b> stress. Understanding the survival mechanisms of Campylobacter should facilitate the implementation of better-targeted strategies and reduce the public health burden associated with Campylobacter infection...|$|R

40|$|In the {{applications}} of industrial hygiene, {{it is of}} utmost importance to define the potential risk factors in the business enterprise in question, to pay sufficient consideration to those factors, and to spend every effort for their checking and elimination. In that sense, <b>cleansing</b> <b>and</b> <b>disinfection</b> applications have a basic importance. Food hygiene covers all the efforts spent {{in order to ensure}} the proper conditions for the production of healthy food at every stage of the production process, extending from the farm to the table. Cleansing is the removal of the dirt or food leftovers found on the tools and equipment contacting food, and preventing their conversion into a convenient millieu for the reproduction of microorganisms. Cleansing is the process of removing not only the visible dirts and leftovers, but also {{a large part of the}} visible microorganisms. Disinfection is applied after cleansing; it is the process of disintegration of microorganisms which can cause contamination, or reduction of those microorganisms to minimum levels so that they can not create any harmful effects.

40|$|PURPOSE: An {{outbreak}} of gram-negative bacteremia in patients undergoing {{endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography}} (ERCP) was investigated to determine the sources of infection and to control transmission. PATIENTS, METHODS, AND RESULTS: The incidence of post-ERCP bacteremia increased from 1. 6 % (60 of 3, 696) procedures to 3. 6 % (53 of 1, 454) procedures (relative risk 2. 3, p < 0. 0001) after endoscopes were processed in a new automated disinfector. Bacteremia involved nine species of Pseudomonas and Enterobacteriaceae, which were also isolated from processed endoscopes. Seven epidemic strains with highly related genomic macrorestriction profiles each infected 2 or more patients, accounting for 29 (55 %) episodes of post-ERCP bacteremia. Strains recovered from endoscopes and from the disinfector were associated with 22 (42 %) and 5 (9 %) bacteremic episodes respectively. Effective endoscope disinfection was achieved by <b>cleansing</b> <b>and</b> <b>disinfection</b> of a blind channel not processed in the disinfector, additional isopropanol- air flush of all channels, and auto-disinfection of the disinfector. In the following period, the incidence of post-ERCP bacteremia returned to the pre- epidemic rate (1. 7 %, p = 0. 0001). CONCLUSION: Bacterial genome fingerprinting by macrorestriction analysis enabled delineation of a multi-strain {{outbreak of}} post-ERCP bacteremia. Cross-contamination, {{and to a lesser}} extent, common- source contamination, appeared related to inadequate disinfection of endoscopes processed in an automated disinfector.

40|$|Cost {{effective}} control of avian diseases and food borne pathogens remains {{a high priority}} for all sectors of the poultry industry with <b>cleansing</b> <b>and</b> <b>disinfection,</b> vaccination and competitive exclusion approaches being used widely. Previous studies showed that Bacillus subtilis PY 79 (hr) was an effective competitive exclusion agent for use in poultry to control avian pathogenic Escherichia coli serotype O 78 :K 80. Here we report experiments that were undertaken to test the efficacy of B. subtilis PY 79 (hr) in the control of Salmonella enterica serotype Enteritidis and Clostridium perfringens in young chickens. To do this, 1 -day-old and 20 -day-old specific pathogen free (SPF) chicks were dosed with a suspension of B. subtilis spores prior to challenge with S. Enteritidis (S 1400) and C. perfringens, respectively. For both challenge models, a single oral inoculum of 1 x 10 (9) spores given 24 h prior to challenge was sufficient to suppress colonisation and persistence of both S. Enteritidis and C perfringens. In particular, the faecal shedding of S. Enteritidis, as measured by a semi-quantitative cloacal swabbing technique, was reduced significantly for the 36 days duration of the experiment. B. subtilis persisted in the intestine although with decreasing numbers over the same period. These data add further evidence that B. subtilis spores may be effective agents in the control of avian diseases and food borne pathogens...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} if lairages of pig slaughterhouses can act as a source of contamination of slaughtered pigs with Salmonella. The prevalence and variety of serotypes of Salmonella in the lairages of two pig slaughterhouses were determined, and the efficacy of the usual cleaning <b>and</b> <b>disinfection</b> on the presence of Salmonella was estimated. Lairages of two pig slaughterhouses were sampled three times when pigs were present. Furthermore, these lairages were sampled after the usual cleaning <b>and</b> <b>disinfection,</b> whereas the lairage of one slaughterhouse was sampled an additional time after improved cleaning <b>and</b> <b>disinfection.</b> Samples were collected by swabbing floor and wall surfaces and collecting the residing fluids on the floor throughout the lairage. Salmonella was isolated in 70 to 90 % of the samples when pigs were present. The usual cleaning <b>and</b> <b>disinfection</b> reduced the level of contamination with Salmonella to 25 % positive samples, whereas improved cleaning <b>and</b> <b>disinfection</b> reduced this level to 10 % positive samples. It is concluded that the waiting period in the lairage of at least 2 h contains a substantial risk for slaughter pigs to become infected with Salmonella, especially for pigs originating from Salmonella-free herds. The usual cleaning <b>and</b> <b>disinfection</b> of the lairage were not sufficient to eliminate this risk, whereas an improved procedure for cleaning <b>and</b> <b>disinfection</b> still was unsatisfactory...|$|R
40|$|Cleaning <b>and</b> <b>disinfection</b> of {{the broiler}} stable {{environment}} {{is an essential}} part of farm hygiene management. Adequate cleaning <b>and</b> <b>disinfection</b> is essential for prevention and control of animal diseases and zoonoses. The goal of this study was to shed light on the dynamics of microbiological and non-microbiological parameters during the successive steps of cleaning <b>and</b> <b>disinfection</b> <b>and</b> to select the most suitable sampling methods and parameters to evaluate cleaning <b>and</b> <b>disinfection</b> in broiler houses. The effectiveness of cleaning <b>and</b> <b>disinfection</b> protocols was measured in six broiler houses on two farms through visual inspection, adenosine triphosphate hygiene monitoring and microbiological analyses. Samples were taken at three time points: 1) before cleaning, 2) after cleaning, <b>and</b> 3) after <b>disinfection.</b> Before cleaning <b>and</b> after <b>disinfection,</b> air samples were taken in addition to agar contact plates and swab samples taken from various sampling points for enumeration of total aerobic flora, Enterococcus spp., and Escherichia coli and the detection of E. coli and Salmonella. After cleaning, air samples, swab samples, and adenosine triphosphate swabs were taken and a visual score was also assigned for each sampling point. The mean total aerobic flora determined by swab samples decreased from 7. 7 +/- 1. 4 to 5. 7 +/- 1. 2 log CFU/ 625 cm(2) after cleaning and to 4. 2 +/- 1. 6 log CFU/ 625 cm(2) after disinfection. Agar contact plates were used as the standard for evaluating cleaning <b>and</b> <b>disinfection,</b> but in this study they were found to be less suitable than swabs for enumeration. In addition to measuring total aerobic flora, Enterococcus spp. seemed to be a better hygiene indicator to evaluate cleaning <b>and</b> <b>disinfection</b> protocols than E. coli. All stables were Salmonella negative, but the detection of its indicator organism E. coli provided additional information for evaluating cleaning <b>and</b> <b>disinfection</b> protocols. Adenosine triphosphate analyses gave additional information about the hygiene level of the different sampling points...|$|R

40|$|Early {{identification}} of an outbreak {{is one of}} the main advantages of routine epidemiological surveillance. Enterococcus spp. used to be regarded as microorganisms of low pathogenicity, because they are part of the normal microbial flora of the gastrointestinal and genitourinary tract. Recently, they have emerged as important pathogenic agents, sometimes causing infections with high mortality rates. We studied a clustering of primary bloodstream infections caused by Enterococcus faecalis in a cardiology hospital neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). Four cases of primary bloodstream infection by E. faecalis were detected from April 15 to May 13, 2004, during active infection surveillance. The isolates were sensitive to glycopeptides. Some aspects of the management of these patients, including the date of insertion and placement of a central venous catheter, prescription of a specific medication, contiguity of beds, personnel attending the patients, and occurrence of diarrhea were analyzed to look for factors that might affect the spread of the microorganisms. Measures taken to hamper the spread included contact precautions throughout the unit, <b>cleansing</b> <b>and</b> <b>disinfection</b> of equipment and surfaces, bathing children with 2 % chlorhexidine-gluconate-containing soap, professional reeducation, and reinforcement of all measures to prevent infections. We suggest that there is a need to re-evaluate preventive infection measures and to review the strategies aimed at decreasing the nosocomial infection rate in the NICU...|$|E

Airborne fungi are one of these microbes and {{the major source of}} hospital indoor contamination that will be able to cause airborne fungal diseases. In the current study, the total count and diversity of the airborne filamentous and yeasts fungi were investigated in indoor and outdoor air of selective wards of Emam Reza Educational, Research and Treatment Center. This cross-sectional study was performed during the fall season. One hundred and ninety-two environmental samples of indoor and outdoor air from hematology, infectious diseases, Ear, Nose and Throat (ENT) and Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) wards were collected by open plate technique (on Sabouraud dextrose agar media) once a week. The cultures were then examined and evaluated according to macroscopic and microscopic examination criteria. In this study, 67 (62. 03 %) of indoor samples and 81 (96. 42 %) of outdoor samples were positive for fungi. The most isolated fungi were yeast species (17. 12 %), Penicillium spp. (16. 34 %), Alternaria spp. (14. 39 %), Aspergillus niger (11. 28 %), A. flavus (8. 95 %), respectively. Almost all of the wards showed high rates of contamination by various fungi. However, the analysis of the data showed that indoor air of hematology ward had the highest fungal pollution. In contrast, the outdoor air of ENT had the highest fungal pollution.

40|$|BackgroundThe {{present study}} aimed {{to assess the}} {{efficacy}} of computer-based endoscope cleaning <b>and</b> <b>disinfection</b> using a hospital management information system (HMIS). MethodsA total of 2, 674 gastroscopes were eligible for inclusion in this study. For the processes of disinfection management, the gastroscopes were randomly divided into 2 groups: gastroscope disinfection HMIS (GD-HMIS) group and manual group. In the GD-HMIS group, an integrated circuit card (IC card) chip was installed to monitor and record endoscope cleaning <b>and</b> <b>disinfection</b> automatically <b>and</b> in real time, whereas the endoscope cleaning <b>and</b> <b>disinfection</b> in the manual group was recorded manually. The overall disinfection progresses for both groups were recorded, and the total operational time was calculated. ResultsFor the GD-HMIS group, endoscope disinfection HMIS software was successfully developed. The time to complete a single session of cleaning and disinfecting on a gastroscope was 15. 6 [*]minutes (range, 14. 3 - 17. 2 [*]minutes) for the GD-HMIS group and 21. 3 [*]minutes (range, 20. 2 - 23. 9 [*]minutes) for the manual group. Failure to record information, such as the identification number of the endoscope, occasionally occurred in the manual group, which affected the accuracy and reliability of manual recording.
