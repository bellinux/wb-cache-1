40|$|The {{topic of}} photo-equality in {{hardcopy}} technologies {{has been widely}} discussed {{from the beginning of}} digital printing until today. Photographic quality prints can be made on desk-top printers with little compromises in permanence and performance. The paper compares the status of ink-jet prints in professional and desktop systems with commercial photography. The gamut of typical ink-jet dye and pigment-based prints and the influence of using more than four metamerism channels was investigated. In a 6 -channel system, the addition of green and orange leads to a similar increase in gamut as the addition of diluted cyan and magenta. However, multi-level printing allows more <b>continuous</b> <b>tone</b> type <b>tone</b> <b>reproduction</b> and better image quality. Diluted colorants provide the gamut gain in high lightness areas. As light metamerisms are prevalent in pictorial images and natural scenes, diluted metamerisms are more beneficial to metamerism and <b>tone</b> <b>reproduction</b> for a photo-quality printing system than hexachrome metamerisms. Colorant stability considerations limit the ink dilutions as very diluted metamerism dots may suffer from permanence defects. Photographic images may be displayed in areas with natural daylight, tungsten light or fluorescent light. They are expected to exhibit a neutral tone scale under all con-ditions. Very brilliant colorants and certain pigments are shown to have appreciable metamerism metamerism which leads to unacceptable metamerism shifts under mixed illumination. The reproduction of certain important metamerisms is another factor in colorant selection and printer design for photographic reproduction. The paper tint of many ink-jet systems is very bright compared to typical photographic prints and their limitations in minimum density...|$|R
40|$|The {{investigation}} {{examined the}} printing {{characteristics of the}} association product plate, a <b>continuous</b> <b>tone</b> lithographic process which utilizes a synthetic, light-sensitive coating variably ink-receptive according {{to the degree of}} exposure it receives. The methodology was designed to determine (1) the printing range of the plate, (2) the effective sensitivity of the coating to varying amounts of exposure within this range, and (3) the degree to which adherence to ideal <b>tone</b> <b>reproduction</b> could be achieved through systematic variation of exposure. The plate is not commercially available, therefore it was necessary to consult patent literature and prior research to obtain details of the coating composition and plate manufacture. A number of pre-trial tests were conducted to optimize the manufacturing process and achieve a desirable balance of coating resiliency and printability. After optimizing plate manufacture, equal-interval <b>continuous</b> <b>tone</b> gray scales were printed on a conventional lithographic press to determine the printing characteristics of the plate. The characteristic curves which were generated by plotting printed densities against negative densities revealed low highlight contrast and high midtone and shadow contrast within a relatively narrow log exposure range of. 75 - 1. 10. Faulty <b>tone</b> <b>reproduction</b> can often be corrected by modifying the contrast gradients of the film negative(s) used for plate exposure. In halftone lithography, this procedure selectively alters dot area to achieve desired print reflectance. In the case of <b>continuous</b> <b>tone</b> processes, tone corrected negatives selectively modify the ink receptivity of the plate coating. VIII In order to test the effects of exposure modulation on the <b>tone</b> <b>reproduction</b> characteristics of the plate, an optical matrix was sensitometrically generated from <b>continuous</b> <b>tone</b> panchromatic film. Various film development techniques were used to alter negative contrast and obtain gray scales with diverse equal-interval log E increments within the response range of the plate. The matrix was used for exposing plates of similar manufacture to generate print data for analysis. Printed densities obtained from the matrix were used to construct conventional characteristic curves, as well as response profiles relating printed density differences to log exposure increments. A mathematical model of the Jones <b>tone</b> <b>reproduction</b> diagram was used to calculate tone correction factors in terms of relative log exposure and to reconstruct tone corrected negative scales. Printed densities obtained from the test matrix were used to gauge the effect of the corrected scales on <b>tone</b> <b>reproduction.</b> This method, in essence, emulated the Jones-type approach to tone correction in a single print run, thereby reducing manufacturing and printing variables. The data revealed a high degree of success in correcting mid-tone and shadow reproduction through exposure modification. Although some areas of non-linear plate response were persistent, these were primarily due to shortcomings in the methodology rather than plate failure. Optical tone correction of the low highlight contrast was significantly more problematic. Given the relatively short printing range of the plate, the required negative gradient eliminates many original tonal values. Other means physical and/or chemical are required to lengthen the tonal range and raise highlight contrast in order to improve overall plate performance...|$|R
40|$|Printing {{without the}} use of a {{halftone}} screen pattern offers many advantages, although most processes utilized are impractical for long run commercial printing. Screenless lithography provides a practical means of making unscreened reproductions. While screenless lithography has been in use for many years, its working mechanisms have only recently been explained. Past studies have investigated many of the factors which contribute to the <b>continuous</b> <b>tone</b> effect of screenless printing, but none have scientifically determined if ink film thickness variation is a contributing factor. Positive working lithographic plates were exposed to control scales, processed, inked, and allowed to dry. These plates were then cross-sectioned and observed under a high magnification microscope to determine if variations in ink film thickness exist. Results showed that variations did indeed exist. These variations were shown to occur not only between areas of different density, but also within areas of uniform density. The different ink film thicknesses that exist on screenless lithographic plates affect their <b>tone</b> <b>reproduction</b> characteristics and contribute to their <b>continuous</b> <b>tone</b> capabilities...|$|R
40|$|A {{relationship}} between preferred <b>tone</b> <b>reproduction</b> and final picture size is suggested {{in many forms}} in the literature and in practical experience. This project uses photographic halftone prints varying in <b>tone</b> <b>reproduction</b> and produced at different sizes to investigate this relationship. The <b>tone</b> <b>reproduction</b> variations are introduced electronically using an RCA color scanner and a method of eigenvector analysis is used to reduce these <b>tone</b> <b>reproductions</b> down to their important components.

Due to large differences in quality rating from observer to observer and an incomplete selection of <b>tone</b> <b>reproductions,</b> no definite relationship was determined.

40|$|The {{halftone}} process {{is so much}} a part of printing today that it is often hard for printers to conceive of the notion of reproducing an image without a screen. Before the idea of breaking up an image into small dots came along however, printing was being done with lithographic methods which produced excellent results and the main concern of the theorist and technician was how to produce a more consistent, higher-quality, <b>continuous</b> <b>tone</b> image. Perhaps it is unfortunate that the advent of the {{halftone process}} distracted thought from this area to such a large degree, since it wasn 2 ̆ 7 t until the early 19502 ̆ 7 s, a century after the first photo-lithographic prints were made with bitumen on stone that interest became centered once again on the possibilities of creating <b>continuous</b> <b>tone</b> images using conventional commercial equipment. This revived interest in 2 ̆ 2 screenless 2 ̆ 2 methods of reproduction gave rise to many processes which employed concentional offset lithographic equipment to produce <b>continuous</b> <b>tone</b> images. While some variation was present in the approach of each of these processes, their fundamental principles were closely aligned with conventional lithography and it was eventually hypothesized and generally accepted that the mechanism of image formation in these plates had to do with the grain structure of the substrate being used. While excellent results were achievable with these plates, they exhibited a lack of consistency and a touchiness in the area of exposure which made them unsuitable for adoption in commercial use on more than a limited basis. In 1969 the Association Products Plate was introduced. This plate was unusual in that it seemed to be based in principle more on the collotype process than on conventional lithography; that is, it depended more fully on the light sensitive material being used than on the substrate. This plate too, exhibited lack of consistency and exposure problems which limited its adoption. Unlike the so called 2 ̆ 2 random dot 2 ̆ 2 processes mentioned above, the image forming mechanism of the Association Products Plate has not been satisfactorily defined. In choosing to study the Association Products Plate from the standpoint of coating variations it was hoped to arrive at a demonstrable relationship between the coatings and subsequent <b>tone</b> <b>reproduction,</b> such that, as the coatings moved from the influence of the plate grain, <b>tone</b> <b>reproduction</b> should exhibit greater consistency and predictability. This, it was hoped, would establish the coatings themselves as the primary imaging agents, pointing the way to further study. The results did not support this contention...|$|R

40|$|The {{thesis is}} an {{evaluation}} of preferred <b>tone</b> <b>reproduction</b> {{as a function of}} reproduction size. When photographs are reproduced photomechanically using the halftone process the main limitation in achieving a facsimile reproduction is the density range of the printing process. Because the printing processes normally used cannot achieve the same high density range as a photograph, tonal compression must occur. The manner in which the tonal compression is achieved has an important effect upon the appearance of the <b>reproduction.</b> The <b>tone</b> <b>reproduction</b> curve is a graphic method used to describe the relationship between the density of the original and the density of the reproduction. A variety of <b>tone</b> <b>reproduction</b> curves can be used to describe a variety of prints whose <b>tone</b> <b>reproduction</b> has been varied. Experimental work was conducted to determine if pre ferred <b>tone</b> <b>reproduction</b> is different for reproductions of varying size. Low key, normal key, and high key original photographs were reproduced using the halftone process with five variations of <b>tone</b> <b>reproduction</b> at a small, medium and large size. A group of twenty-one viewers was used to evaluate the reproductions. The results of the <b>tone</b> <b>reproduction</b> evaluation suggest that preferred <b>tone</b> <b>reproduction</b> varies relative to size primarily with low key scenes. To a lesser extent preferred <b>tone</b> <b>reproduction</b> varies relative to size with normal key scenes. There appears to be no difference in preferred <b>tone</b> <b>reproduction</b> relative to size with high key scenes. The results seem to indicate that with low key originals, viewers prefer small size (32 ̆ 2 x 2 5 / 162 ̆ 2) repro ductions with 2 ̆ 2 open 2 ̆ 2 or lower density midtones and shadows. At the middle size (8 1 / 22 ̆ 2 x 6 5 / 82 ̆ 2), viewers prefer darker midtones and shadows, sacrificing some detail. At the largest size, viewers rated the reproduction with 2 ̆ 2 open 2 ̆ 2 shadows very poor while rating a reproduction with darker midtones and shadows as best. The reproduction with the darkest shadows, losing all detail, was rated the poorest. The only difference in preferred reproduction relative to size in normal key subjects was that at the smallest size the preferred reproduction was a curve that accentuates the contrast in the midtones. At the medium and large sizes the preferred curve was the curve that corresponds most closely to equal visual differences in brightness throughout the range of tones. This is similar to results obtained by Yule in previous studies. The preferred reproductions chosen when using a high key subject were very consistent from small to medium to large. The preferred reproductions for this subject were different than that for low and normal key scenes...|$|R

40|$|The ordered-dither halftoning {{technique}} which reproduces <b>continuous</b> <b>tones</b> with spatially encoded binary imaging elements uses the digital halftone screen. The effect at the microstructural level of four screens on <b>tone</b> <b>reproduction,</b> spatial signal reproduction, and quantization noise is evaluated {{by measuring the}} <b>tone</b> <b>reproduction</b> curve (TRC), the two-dimensional Fourier transform of a constant density patch, the degree of harmonic distortion (THD), the system Modulation Transfer Function (MTF), and the Wiener Spectrum (WS) produced by each screen. The applicablity of these five conventional image evaluation metrics on binary output is also evaluated. Spatial averaging is done to convert the binary output to a more linear form. The TRCs {{were found to be}} identical with a full output average reflectance range and a contrast of 1. 0 / 255. 0. The curves were step-wise linear, displaying 65 reproducible average reflectance levels. Fourier analysis of the binary structure showed that aliasing was likely to occur with the Diamond Dot and Bryngdahl screens, while aliasing from the Bayer and Allebach screens was unlikely. The THD plots showed that the Diamond Dot screen produced the highest degree of non-linearity, followed by Bryngdahl. The Bayer and Allebach screens produced the lowest THD. The line edge derivative approach to determining MTF did not yield useful MTF results for the halftoned forms. The Weiner spectrum for the Diamond Dot and Bryngdahl screens contained components at the halftone cell frequency, while the spectrum for the Bayer and Allebach screens contained components at much higher frequencies. Using these results, it was concluded that all the traditional metrics are valid for binary output except the line edge derivative approach for the MTF which did not yield the traditional MTF...|$|R
