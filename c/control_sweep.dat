40|$|Abstract We {{present a}} sweep-based {{approach}} to human body modeling and deformation. A rigid 3 D human model, given as a polygonal mesh, is approximated with <b>control</b> <b>sweep</b> surfaces. The vertices on the mesh {{are bound to}} nearby sweep surfaces and then follow the deformation of the sweep surfaces as the model bends and twists its arms, legs, spine and neck. Anatomical features including bone-protrusion, muscle-bulge, and skinfolding are supported by a GPU-based collision detection procedure. The volumes of arms, legs, and torso are kept constant by a simple control using a volume integral formula for sweep surfaces. We demonstrate {{the effectiveness of this}} sweep-based human deformation in several test animation clips...|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} sweep-based {{approach}} to modeling and deformation of three-dimensional objects. We approximate the deformable parts {{of an object}} using sweep surfaces. The vertices on the object boundary are bound to the sweep surfaces and then follow their deformation. For practical applications, we apply this approach to 3 D human body modeling and deformation, and then extend it to the freeform deformation and to the elastic deformation of three-dimensional objects. For human modeling and deformation, a simple skeleton structure is extracted from user-specified feature points; after that, <b>control</b> <b>sweep</b> surfaces that approximate human arms, legs and torso are automatically generated. The vertices on the model are bound to nearby sweep surfaces and follow the deformation of the sweep surfaces as the model bends and twists its arms, legs, spine and neck. Anatomical features including bone-protrusion, muscle-bulge, and skin-folding are also supported. We then extend the sweep-based approach to the freeform deformation of three-dimensional objects.

40|$|Results of {{a wide-ranging}} {{investigation}} of the scaling of gas injection processes are reported. The research examines how the physical mechanisms at work during a gas injection project interact to determine process performance. In particular, the authors examine: the interactions of equilibrium phase behavior and two-phase flow that determine local displacement efficiency and minimum miscibility pressure, the combined effects of viscous fingering, gravity segregation and heterogeneity that <b>control</b> <b>sweep</b> efficiency in 2 - and 3 -dimensional porous media, the use of streamtube/streamline methods to create very efficient simulation technique for multiphase compositional displacements, the scaling of viscous, capillary and gravity forces for heterogeneous reservoirs, {{and the effects of}} the thin films and spreading behavior on three-phase flow. The following key results are documented: rigorous procedures for determination of minimum miscibility pressure (MMP) or minimum miscibility enrichment (MME) for miscibility have been developed for multicomponent systems; the complex dependence of MMP`s for nitrogen/methane floods on oil and injection gas composition observed experimentally is explained for the first time; the presence of layer-like heterogeneities strongly influences the interplay of gravity segregation and viscous fingering, as viscous fingers adapt to preferential flow paths and low permeability layers restrict vertical flow; streamtube/streamline simulation techniques are demonstrated for a variety of injection processes in 2 and 3 dimensions; quantitative scaling estimates for the transitions from capillary-dominated to gravity-dominated to viscous-dominated flows are reported; experimental results are given that demonstrate that high pressure CO{sub 2 } can be used to generate low IFT gravity drainage in fractured reservoirs if fractures are suitably connected; and the effect of wetting and spreading behavior on three-phase flow is described. 209 refs...|$|E

Changes to the turbulence structure in the region closer to the wall have been examined using hot-wire anemometry. Control of each detected sweep event has been obtained by using multiple injections whose number is proportional to the duration of the event.

40|$|This project {{examines}} {{three major}} {{areas in which}} CO{sub 2 } flooding can be improved: fluid and matrix interactions, conformance <b>control,</b> <b>sweep</b> efficiency, and reservoir simulation for improved oil recovery. This report discusses the activity during the calendar quarter covering October 1, 1999 through December 31, 1999 that covers mostly the second fiscal quarter of the project's third year. Injectivity experiments were performed on two Indian limestone cores. In tests on the first core, a variety of brine, CO{sub 2 } WAG, and oil contaminant injection schemes indicated infectivity reduction due to phase conditions and contamination. The results are only quantitative because of plugging and erosion in the core. To date, tests on the second core have investigated the effects of long-term brine stability on the reduction of fluid-rock interaction, in order to quantify fluid effects on infectivity. The authors continue {{to develop a new}} approach in reservoir simulation to improve the history matching process on clusters of PCs. The main objective was to improve simulation of complex improved oil recovery methods, such as CO{sub 2 }-foam for mobility control and sweep enhancements. Adsorption experiments using circulation and flow-through methods were used to determine the loss of surfactants for economic evaluation. A sacrificial agent, lignosulfonate, was used to reduce the adsorption of the primary foaming agent in both Berea sandstone and Indian limestone. The lignosulfonate has also shown a chromatograph effect, advancing more rapidly through the reservoir, thus initially adsorbing onto the rock before the primary foaming agent arrives. Therefore, considering the simplicity of operation and economics of reducing the cost of expensive surfactant to improve oil recovery, coinjection of lignosulfonate with the primary foaming agent might be a practical approach to consider for field application...|$|E

40|$|We {{investigate}} degradation {{mechanisms in}} AlGaN/GaN HEMTs which were repeatedly {{driven into the}} current-controlled off-state breakdown or subject to 60 s voltage- or current-controlled off state stresses. The current-controlled sweep in to the breakdown allows the sustainability of breakdown {{that can not be}} observed in the voltage <b>controlled</b> <b>sweep.</b> Only temporal changes were observed in the HEMT dc performance after repetitive sweeps, which were explained by charging/discharging of the HEMT surface at the gate-to-drain access region and in the GaN buffer below the gate. Similar changes were observed also if high-voltage stress has been applied on the drain; however, permanent degradation appears after 60 s current-controlled breakdown stress. In this case, the drain leakage current, as well as the breakdown current, increases significantly. On the other hand, the breakdown voltage, as well as the gate characteristics, remains unaltered. We suggest that the avalanche-injection process is governing the off-state breakdown event with a dominant role of the potential barrier at the channel-buffer interface.
