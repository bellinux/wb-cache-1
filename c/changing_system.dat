40|$|We {{identify}} an emergent {{class of}} database systems {{that has not}} been dealt with extensively in the literature that we call ARCS (Active, Rapidly <b>Changing</b> data <b>Systems)</b> databases. ARCS databases may be used to manage a class of systems, known as rapidly <b>changing</b> <b>systems.</b> Examples of such systems include network management systems, automated financial management systems and intelligent vehicle highway systems. These systems impose certain unique requirements on databases that monitor and control them. These requirements are such that traditional data and transaction management models appear inadequate. We present an analysis of data and transaction characteristics in ARCS systems and discuss why conventional database notions are inadequate.
