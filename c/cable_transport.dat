50|$|The first <b>cable</b> <b>transport</b> system, {{installed}} on the Bastille in 1875, was built by the Porte de France Cement Company for freight. This <b>cable</b> <b>transport</b> system connected a quarry on Mount Jalla, just over the Bastille, and Grenoble. It was abandoned in the early 20th century.|$|E
5000|$|There {{are a few}} notable {{advantages}} to using <b>cable</b> <b>transport</b> including: ...|$|E
5000|$|Reliability and {{efficiency}} - Modern <b>cable</b> <b>transport</b> has, on average, {{less than one}} minute wait times between vehicles.|$|E
5000|$|Energy Efficient - Due to <b>cable</b> <b>transport’s</b> use {{of gravity}} and counterbalancing, many systems {{generate}} are self-sufficient in terms of power during off-peak times.|$|R
50|$|Remote Skylights are optical systems {{capable of}} {{providing}} natural light to unlit locations. An arrangement of parabolic reflectors and optical fiber <b>cables,</b> <b>transport</b> natural sunlight to areas {{that would otherwise be}} dark or be lit artificially.|$|R
5000|$|There are two {{approaches}} to constructing a space elevator. Either the cable is manufactured in space {{or it is}} launched into space and gradually reinforced by additional <b>cables,</b> <b>transported</b> by climbers into space. Manufacturing the cable in space {{could be done in}} principle by using an asteroid or Near-Earth object.|$|R
50|$|Nepal is a {{landlocked}} Himalayan {{country where}} transportation {{can be difficult}} due to its mountainous terrain. Nevertheless, there are transport mediums such as road transportation and water transportation. Being a landlocked and mountainous country, road transportation is the easiest way of traveling in Nepal. However, <b>Cable</b> <b>transport</b> is an emerging transport mode in Nepal. Manakamana Cable Car and Chandragiri Cable Car are the two <b>cable</b> <b>transport</b> providers in Nepal.|$|E
5000|$|High safety - Accidents {{relating}} to <b>cable</b> <b>transport</b> are extremely rare. Over 10,000 CTPs transport billions of people each year yet cable transports have some the best safety records of any mode of transport.|$|E
50|$|Infrastructure is {{the fixed}} {{installations}} that allow {{a vehicle to}} operate. It consists of a way, a terminal and facilities for parking and maintenance. For rail, pipeline, road and <b>cable</b> <b>transport,</b> the entire way the vehicle travels must be built up.|$|E
5000|$|Three basic {{approaches}} for constructing a space elevator have been proposed: First, using in-space resources to manufacture the whole cable in space. Second, launching and deploying a first seed cable and successively reinforcing the seed cable by additional <b>cables,</b> <b>transported</b> by climbers. Third, spooling two cables {{down and then}} connecting the ends, forming a loop.|$|R

50|$|More recent {{developments}} are being classified under {{the type of}} track that their design is based upon. In 1868 the Westside and Yonkers railway came into operation according to Andrea Marocchi. After {{the success of this}} operation, several other projects were initiated in New Zealand and Chicago. The social climate around pollution is allowing for a shift from cars back to the utilization of <b>cable</b> <b>transport</b> due to their advantages. However, for many years they were a niche form of transportation used primarily in difficult-to-operate conditions for cars (such as on ski slopes as lifts). Now that <b>Cable</b> <b>Transport</b> Projects (CTP) are on the incline the social effects are beginning to become more significant.|$|E
5000|$|Although {{accidents}} involving <b>cable</b> <b>transport</b> are a rare occurrence, there have still been some pretty tragic and serious {{incidents in the}} past. These are ranging from simple power outages causing the cart {{to come to an}} unexpected halt or the cart unfortunately crashing: ...|$|E
50|$|<b>Cable</b> <b>transport</b> {{is a broad}} mode where {{vehicles}} are pulled by cables instead of an internal power source. It is most commonly used at steep gradient. Typical solutions include aerial tramway, elevators, escalator and ski lifts; {{some of these are}} also categorized as conveyor transport.|$|E
40|$|<b>Cable</b> car <b>transport</b> is an {{essential}} part of the facilities offered for summer tourism and a necessary feature of Austrian winter tourism. In 1992 <b>cable</b> car <b>transport</b> produced a value-added of AS 5. 5 billion, approximately as much as streetcar and bus transport. During the past 15 years the number of persons <b>transported</b> by <b>cable</b> cars has increased by an average of 6. 3 percent p. a. (summer + 1. 5 percent, winter + 7 percent). Around 90 percent of all transport cases occur during the winter season. The construction of new cable cars has given strong impulses to winter tourism, and has contributed to the development of a strong export-oriented cable car and ski industry in Austria. Winter tourism causes considerable ecological damage to the sensitive habitats in mountain valleys. The direct damages caused by the construction and operation of cable cars and of ski runs are only a minor part of these overall damages.

50|$|Giulio Ceretti, (1868, Bologna - 1934 Milan) was an Italian {{engineer}} and entrepreneur, {{active in the}} area of <b>cable</b> <b>transport.</b> Ceretti built the first aerial cableway with intermediate supports, {{and was one of the}} first engineers ever to design and install mechanical systems in harbours and dock yards in order to speed-up the loading and unloading of cargo ships.|$|E
5000|$|A surface lift is a {{means of}} <b>cable</b> <b>transport</b> that {{transports}} skiers and snowboarders, in which riders remain on the ground as they are pulled uphill. Once prevalent, they have gradually been overtaken in popularity by higher-capacity aerial lifts like chairlifts and the gondola lift. Today, surface lifts are most often found on beginner slopes and very small ski areas.|$|E
50|$|Additionally {{the hike}} from Middle Vodno (557m) to the Krstovar Peak(1066m), where the Millennium Cross is located, {{has become a}} highly {{attractive}} leisure activity. The increase in interest in this activity {{can be attributed to}} the opening of a bus-line that makes round-trips from the Skopje City Centre to Middle Vodno, as well as the availability of <b>cable</b> <b>transport</b> from Middle Vodno to Krstovar Peak.|$|E
50|$|Other than Earth's Moon, {{no other}} {{body in the}} Solar System has been {{explored}} and examined for possible future human colonization more intently than Mars. In Wanderers, Wernquist starts with NASA photographs and crafts three scenes showing the possible Martian future: in the first, the cabin of a theorized space elevator descends down its <b>cable,</b> <b>transporting</b> supplies to a Mars colony below, in the second, workers in space suits wait {{near the edge of}} Victoria Crater for approaching dirigibles, and in the third, a group of hikers (who are presumably accustomed to watching red sunsets on Earth) enjoy the sight of the Martian sky glowing blue around the setting sun.|$|R
50|$|<b>Cable</b> car <b>transport</b> {{systems are}} a viable {{transportation}} system for various situations.

50|$|Infrastructure is {{the fixed}} {{installations}} that allow {{a vehicle to}} operate. It consists of a roadway, a terminal, and facilities for parking and maintenance. For rail, pipeline, road and <b>cable</b> <b>transport,</b> the entire way the vehicle travels must be constructed. Air and watercraft are able to avoid this, since the airway and seaway {{do not need to}} be constructed. However, they require fixed infrastructure at terminals.|$|E
50|$|<b>Cable</b> <b>{{transport}}</b> {{is a broad}} {{class of}} transport modes that have cables {{as the foundation for}} transporting things, people, or vehicles. The cable may be driven or passive; items may be moved by pulling, sliding, sailing, or by drives within the object being moved on cableways. The use of pulleys and balancing of loads going up and down are common elements of cable transport.They are also used in mountainous areas.|$|E
5000|$|The {{future of}} the <b>cable</b> <b>transport</b> {{certainly}} looks promising, {{as the need for}} reducing the transportation costs and air pollution is rapidly growing. Also, it is necessary to take into consideration the various cable-APM (Automated People Mover) characteristics, because they possess different properties, suit different needs and therefore can be used to solve a variety of transportation issues.

5000|$|Rocktram (also, Rockfram) is an unincorporated {{community}} in Napa County, California. It lies at {{an elevation of}} 13 feet (4 m). Rocktram {{is located on the}} Southern Pacific Railroad, 3 mi south of Napa, at the junction with the Napa Valley Railroad and the Basalt Rock Company rock tram. This area got its name from an overhead tramway between the Basalt Rock Company quarry and a plant located on the Napa River. [...] The tram crossed California State Route 221 near what is now Kaiser Road. Metal containers that hung from a steel <b>cable</b> <b>transported</b> rock from Basalt’s quarry on the hills east of the highway to the plant on the river. The rocks were loaded on barges and floated down to construction sites from Sacramento to San Francisco. Rocks from Basalt were used in the construction of Treasure Island and most of the Bay Area bridges.|$|R
50|$|Mode of {{transport}} {{is a term}} used to distinguish substantially different ways to perform. The different modes {{of transport}} are air, water, and people transport, which includes rail, road and off-road transport. Other modes also exist, including pipelines, <b>cable</b> <b>transport,</b> and space transport. Human-powered transport and animal-powered transport are sometimes regarded as their own mode, but these normally also fall into the other categories. In general, transportation {{is used for the}} movement of people, animals, and other things.Each mode of transport has a fundamentally different technological solution, and some require a separate environment. Each mode has its own infrastructure, vehicles, and operations.|$|E
5000|$|An {{aerial lift}} {{is a means}} of <b>cable</b> <b>transport</b> in which cabins, cars, gondolas or open chairs are hauled above the ground by means of one or more cables. Aerial lift systems are {{frequently}} employed in mountainous territory where roads are relatively difficult to build and use, and have seen extensive use in mining. Aerial lift systems are relatively easy to move, and are and have been used to cross rivers and ravines. In more recent times, the cost-effectiveness and flexibility of aerial lifts has seen an increase of gondola lift being integrated into urban public transport systems.|$|E
