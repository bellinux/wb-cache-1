60|$|But {{certainly}} {{the best example}} of Mr. Wells's fallacy {{can be found in the}} example which he himself chooses. It is quite true that we see a dim light which, compared with a darker thing, is light, but which, compared with a stronger light, is darkness. But the quality of light remains the same thing, or else we should not call it a stronger light or recognize it as such. If the <b>character</b> <b>of</b> <b>light</b> were not fixed in the mind, we should be quite as likely to call a denser shadow a stronger light, or vice versa If the <b>character</b> <b>of</b> <b>light</b> became even for an instant unfixed, if it became even by a hair's-breadth doubtful, if, for example, there crept into our idea of light some vague idea of blueness, then in that flash we have become doubtful whether the new light has more light or less. In brief, the progress may be as varying as a cloud, but the direction must be as rigid as a French road. North and South are relative in the sense that I am North of Bournemouth and South of Spitzbergen. But if there be any doubt of the position of the North Pole, there is in equal degree a doubt of whether I am South of Spitzbergen at all. The absolute idea of light may be practically unattainable. We may not be able to procure pure light. We may not be able to get to the North Pole. But because the North Pole is unattainable, it does not follow that it is indefinable. And it is only because the North Pole is not indefinable that we can make a satisfactory map of Brighton and Worthing.|$|E

The heath and changes of weather were quite blotted out from their eyes for the present. They were enclosed {{in a sort of}} luminous mist, which hid from them surroundings of any inharmonious colour, and gave to all things the <b>character</b> <b>of</b> <b>light.</b> When it rained they were charmed, because they could remain indoors together all day with such a show of reason; when it was fine they were charmed, because they could sit together on the hills. They were like those double stars which revolve round and round each other, and from a distance appear to be one. The absolute solitude in which they lived intensified their reciprocal thoughts; yet some might have said that it had the disadvantage of consuming their mutual affections at a fearfully prodigal rate. Yeobright did not fear for his own part; but recollection of Eustacia's old speech about the evanescence of love, now apparently forgotten by her, sometimes caused him to ask himself a question; and he recoiled at the thought that the quality of finiteness was not foreign to Eden.|$|E

Colonnade rose over colonnade; the {{pediment}} of the western front was lifted into a detached and scenic wall; story above story sprang the multiplied arches of the Campanile, and the eastern pyramidal fire-type, lifted from its foundation, was placed upon the summit. With the superimposed arcades of the principal front arose the necessity, instantly felt by their subtle architects, of a new proportion in the column; the lower wall inclosure, necessarily {{for the purposes of}} Christian worship continuous, and needing no peristyle, rendered the lower columns a mere facial decoration, whose proportions were evidently no more to be regulated by the laws hitherto observed in detached colonnades. The column expanded into the shaft, or into the huge pilaster rising unbanded from tier to tier; shaft and pilaster were associated in ordered groups, and the ideas of singleness and limited elevation once attached to them, swept away for ever; the stilted and variously centered arch existed already: the pure ogive followed--where first exhibited we stay not to inquire;--finally, and chief of all, the great mechanical discovery of the resistance of lateral pressure by the weight of the superimposed flanking pinnacle. Daring concentrations of pressure upon narrow piers were the immediate consequence, and the recognition of the buttress as a feature in itself agreeable and susceptible of decoration. The glorious art of painting on glass added its temptations; the darkness of northern climes both rendering the typical <b>character</b> <b>of</b> <b>Light</b> more deeply felt than in Italy, and necessitating its admission in larger masses; the Italian, even at the period of his most exquisite art in glass, retaining the small Lombard window, whose expediency will hardly be doubted by anyone who has experienced the transition from the scorching reverberation of the white-hot marble front, to the cool depth of shade within, and whose beauty will not be soon forgotten by those who have seen the narrow lights of the Pisan duomo announce by their redder burning, not like transparent casements, but like characters of fire searing the western wall, the decline of day upon Capraja.|$|E

50|$|Together with KFKI colleagues, {{he carried}} out a famous low-intensity {{interference}} experiment, a quantum-mechanical process in which low-intensity photon beams interfere with themselves—although the experiments originally sought to refute this possibility. These interference results involving {{a small number of}} photons are significant for appreciating the quantum nature of light. The measurements he carried out in connection with the dual <b>character</b> <b>of</b> <b>light</b> (self-interference of few photons) supplied results that were expected on the basis of quantum mechanics; yet, due to the requirements of extremely high accuracy, measurements of this kind had not been carried out before Jánossy. Spurred by this famous photon experiment, Schrödinger was quick to write a letter, in which he emphasized the importance of the result. In both the measurement of cosmic radiation and the low intensity interference experiment, precision of the correct results is of fundamental importance, which justified Jánossy's interest in the statistical evaluation of measurements.|$|E

40|$|International audienceWe {{introduce}} {{a technique to}} decompose the scattered near field of two-dimensional arbitrary metaatoms into its multipole contributions. To this end we expand the scattered field upon plane wave illumination into cylindrical harmonics as known from Mie's theory. By relating these cylindrical harmonics to the field radiated by Cartesian multipoles, {{the contribution of the}} lowest order electric and magnetic multipoles can be identified. Revealing these multipoles is essential for the design of metamaterials because they largely determine the <b>character</b> <b>of</b> <b>light</b> propagation. In particular, having this information at hand it is straightforward to distinguish between effects that result either from the arrangement of the metaatoms or from their particular design...|$|E
40|$|As {{discovered}} by Philip Anderson in 1958, strong disorder can block propagation of waves {{and lead to}} the localization of wave-like excitations in space. Anderson localization of light is particularly exciting in view of its possible applications for random lasing or quantum information processing.

Localization is recovered if the vector <b>character</b> <b>of</b> <b>light</b> is neglected.

40|$|In {{this article}} we present a closed {{analytical}} description for few-cycle, focused electromagnetic pulses of arbitrary duration and carrier-envelope-phase (CEP). Because of the vectorial <b>character</b> <b>of</b> <b>light,</b> not all thinkable one-dimensional (1 D) shapes for the transverse electric field or vector potential can be realized as finite energy three-dimensional (3 D) structures. We cope with this problem by using a second potential, which {{is defined as a}} primitive to the vector potential. This allows to construct fully consistent 3 D wave-packet solutions for the Maxwell equations, given a solution of the scalar wave equation. The wave equation is solved for ultrashort, Gaussian and related pulses in paraxial approximation. The solution is given in a closed and numerically convenient form, based on the complex error function. All results undergo thorough numerical testing, validating their correctness and accuracy. A reliable and accurate representation of few-cycle pulses is e. g. crucial for analytical and numerical theory of vacuum particle acceleration. Comment: 8 pages, 5 figure...|$|E
