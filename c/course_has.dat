5|$|The Barnard Run is {{a school}} competition, {{consisting}} of a cross-country trial over a hilly course. It {{is the most important}} sporting event in the school year. The <b>course</b> <b>has</b> varied considerably over the years. It dates back to 1892 when Lord Barnard donated and presented the trophy. The race takes place annually {{at the end of the}} first half of the Spring Term. The girls' and younger boys' race is 2¾ miles while the senior boys' is 4 miles.|$|E

5|$|The {{city also}} {{contains}} {{one of the}} nation's top rated golf courses, Southern Hills Country Club, {{which is one of}} only two courses that have hosted seven men's major championships: three U.S. Opens and four PGA Championships, the most recent in 2007. The <b>course</b> <b>has</b> held five amateur championships and from 2001 to 2008 the LPGA had a regular tour stop, latterly known as the SemGroup Championship at Cedar Ridge Country Club. In addition, Tulsa has two golf courses designed by famed golf course architect A.W. Tillinghast: the Oaks Country Club and Tulsa Country Club.|$|E
5|$|The {{jet stream}} moves from West to East {{bringing}} changes of weather.

For example, in 2007 and 2012, Britain experienced severe flooding {{as a result of the}} polar jet staying south for the summer.|$|E
5|$|Tiger Woods Design {{has taken}} on two other courses, neither of which has materialized. In August 2007, Woods {{announced}} The Cliffs at High Carolina, a private course in the Blue Ridge Mountains near Asheville, North Carolina. After a groundbreaking in November 2008, the project suffered cash flow problems and suspended construction. A third course, in Punta Brava, Mexico, was announced in October 2008, but incurred delays due to issues with permits and an environmental impact study. Construction on the Punta Brava <b>course</b> <b>has</b> not yet begun.|$|E

5|$|Antiquarians {{and historians}} have been {{interested}} in the ditch since the 19th century, but much of its <b>course</b> <b>has</b> been built over. Between 1990 and 1997, the University of Manchester Archaeological Unit excavated sections of the ditch in Denton, Reddish, Levenshulme and Platt Fields, in an attempt to determine its age and purpose. Although no date was established for the ditch's construction, the investigations revealed that the bank {{to the north of the}} ditch is of 20th century origin. Together with the ditch's profile, which is U-shaped rather than the V-shape typically used in military ditches and defences, this suggests that the purpose of the earthwork was to mark a territorial boundary. The conclusion of the project was that the ditch was probably a boundary marker.|$|E
5|$|In 1988, Stephen E. Loeb {{proposed}} that accounting ethics education should include seven goals (adapted {{from a list}} by Daniel Callahan). To implement these goals, {{he pointed out that}} accounting ethics could be taught throughout accounting curriculum or in an individual class tailored to the subject. Requiring it be taught throughout the curriculum would necessitate all accounting teachers to have knowledge on the subject (which may require training). A single <b>course</b> <b>has</b> issues as to where to include the course in a student's education (for example, before preliminary accounting classes or near the end of a student's degree requirements), whether there is enough material to cover in a semester class, and whether most universities have room in a four-year curriculum for a single class on the subject.|$|E
5|$|Ornais and Dooneys Gate both {{suffered}} fatal {{falls on}} the first circuit. Ornais incurred a cervical fracture at the fourth fence (a plain 4ft 10-inch obstacle) and Dooneys Gate fractured his thoracolumbar at fence six (the 5ft Becher's Brook). Aintree had made significant modifications to its National Course in recent years, including improving veterinary facilities and reducing the severity of some fences, but another notable change was highlighted in this race – that the <b>course</b> <b>has</b> been widened to allow more fences to be bypassed if necessary. As the remaining contenders on the second circuit approached the 20th fence, arrowed signposts and marshals waving chequered flags signalled them to bypass on the outside as Ornais' body was covered by a tarpaulin on the landing side. Two jumps later and they were again diverted, this time around the famous Becher's Brook, where veterinary staff attended to Dooneys Gate. This {{was the first time}} since the modern course was finalised in the 1880s that only 28 fences were jumped.|$|E

5|$|Sleaford Town F.C. {{played in}} the United Counties League Premier Division for the 2014–15 season. Formed as Sleaford Amateurs F.C. in 1920, the club was renamed Sleaford Town in 1968. In 2007 it moved to its present grounds at Eslaforde Park. Sleaford Rugby FC's clubhouse opened in 1999 off the A153. Sleaford Golf Club was founded in 1905 and had roughly 100 members the {{following}} year, which increased to 193 in 1911. The original golf <b>course</b> <b>has</b> been altered. In 2014, the club had roughly 600 members. Sleaford Cricket Club has grounds at London Road; the earliest record of the club is in 1803. The town {{is also home to}} Bristol Bowls Club, an all-discipline gymnastics club founded in 1996. An outdoor lido opened in 1872 on riverside land owned by the Bristol estate but handed over to the community as public baths. Indoor facilities were built in the 20th century and the old lido became Sleaford Leisure Centre. In 2011 Kesteven District Council received a grant of £2.85 million, to fund reconstruction of the centre and its gym.|$|E
5|$|The tournament has {{a number}} of traditions. Since 1949, a green jacket has been awarded to the champion, who must return it to the clubhouse one year after his victory, {{although}} it remains his personal property and is stored with other champions' jackets in a specially designated cloakroom. In most instances, only a first-time and currently reigning champion may remove his jacket from the club grounds. A golfer who wins the event multiple times uses the same green jacket awarded upon his initial win (unless he needs to be re-fitted with a new jacket). The Champions Dinner, inaugurated by Ben Hogan in 1952, is held on the Tuesday before each tournament, and is open only to past champions and certain board members of the Augusta National Golf Club. Beginning in 1963, legendary golfers, usually past champions, have hit an honorary tee shot {{on the morning of the}} first round to commence play. These have included Fred McLeod, Jock Hutchinson, Gene Sarazen, Sam Snead, Byron Nelson, Arnold Palmer, Jack Nicklaus, and Gary Player. Since 1960, a semi-social contest at the par-3 <b>course</b> <b>has</b> been played on Wednesday, the day before the first round.|$|E
