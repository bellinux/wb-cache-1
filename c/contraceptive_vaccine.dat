5|$|Public Law 105-229, {{commonly}} referred to as the Shackleford Banks Wild Horses Protection Act, states that the Bankers on Shackleford Island are to be jointly managed by the National Park Service and another qualified nonprofit entity (currently the Foundation for Shackleford Horses). The herd is limited to 120–130horses. Population management is achieved through adoption and by administering the <b>contraceptive</b> <b>vaccine</b> Porcine zona pellucida (PZP) to individual mares via dart. The island's horse population is monitored by freeze branding numbers onto each animal's left hindquarter. The identification of individuals allows the National Park Service to ensure correct gender ratios and to select which mares to inject with PZP.|$|E
5|$|The BLM {{management}} of the herd has included improvements to the range to give the horses additional access to water, and numerous roundups that {{have resulted in the}} removal and adoption of hundreds of horses to private individuals, including over 50 horses in 2009, and another 44 in 2012. In 2015, a plan was approved to gather 6-12 one and two year old horses annually until the <b>contraceptive</b> <b>vaccine</b> the mares are given can lower birth rates more. This resulted in the most recent gather and removal of 17 horses and 1 foal. Once again, every horse captured was adopted. The Pryor Mountains Wild Horse Range {{is one of the most}} accessible areas to view feral horse herds in the United States and tourism to the area has increased in recent years.|$|E
25|$|In 2012, {{researchers}} from Brawijaya University {{in conjunction with}} pharmaceutical company Bio Farma received {{a grant from the}} Indonesian government to develop a zona pellucida <b>contraceptive</b> <b>vaccine</b> for human use. Instead of pigs, the zonae pellucidae for the program are harvested from cows. The program hopes to mass-produce a <b>contraceptive</b> <b>vaccine</b> in Indonesia in 2013 at the earliest.|$|E
25|$|While <b>contraceptive</b> <b>vaccines</b> can be {{delivered}} remotely, they still require administration to each individual animal {{that is to be}} made infertile. Thus <b>contraceptive</b> <b>vaccines</b> have been used to control only relatively small populations of wildlife. Australia and New Zealand have large populations of European invasive species for which such approach will not scale. Research in these countries has therefore focused on genetically modifying viruses or microorganisms that infect the unwanted invasive species to contain immunocontraceptive antigens.|$|R
40|$|Vaccines {{have been}} used {{successfully}} to treat and eradicate infectious diseases; this has encouraged a major drive towards development of <b>contraceptive</b> <b>vaccines</b> (immunocontraception) as an additional method against rising human and animal populations. Despite three decades worth of research in this field, there are no licensed human <b>contraceptive</b> <b>vaccines</b> and less than ten for use in animals. The development of peptide antifertility vaccines has had a substantial impact on improving safety and specificity of immunogens, but has resulted in efficacy problems.

25|$|Mucosal immunity, which {{includes}} immune {{function in the}} female reproductive tract, is not as well understood as humoral immunity. This may be an issue for certain <b>contraceptive</b> <b>vaccines.</b> For instance, in the second LDH-C4 primate trial that had negative results, all of the immunized macaque monkeys developed high antibody titers against LDH-C4 in serum, but antibodies against LDH-C4 were {{not found in the}} monkeys' vaginal fluids. If antibodies against LDH-C4 do indeed inhibit fertilization, then this result highlights how the difference in the functioning of mucosal immunity from humoral immunity may be critical to the efficacy of <b>contraceptive</b> <b>vaccines.</b>|$|R
25|$|In 1987, a {{pharmaceutical}} company called Zonagen (later renamed Repros Therapeutics) was {{started with the}} goal of developing zona pellucida vaccines {{as an alternative to the}} surgical sterilization of companion animals and eventually as a contraceptive for human use. The products would be based on research being done at the Baylor College of Medicine by Bonnie S. Dunbar that was funded by Zonagen. However, the relationship between Zonagen and Bonnie Dunbar ended acrimoniously in 1993. Despite claims later that year that development of a <b>contraceptive</b> <b>vaccine</b> was imminent and an agreement with Schering AG for funding for joint development of a <b>contraceptive</b> <b>vaccine</b> for human use, no vaccine was made commercially available and the agreement with Schering was terminated after primate studies were disappointing. The company would go on to pursue other projects and be renamed.|$|E
25|$|Throughout the 1990s, {{there was}} a {{resurgence}} of research in immunocontraception targeting sperm {{with the hope of}} developing a <b>contraceptive</b> <b>vaccine</b> for human use. Unlike earlier research which explored the contraceptive effect of immune responses to whole sperm cells, contemporary research has focused on searching for specific molecular antigens that are involved with sperm function.|$|E
25|$|BLM {{began its}} roundup of feral horses on the Pryor Mountains range in early September 2009. After several days, 130 of 188 feral horses were rounded up. Forty-six horses were {{put up for}} adoption, while the freed mares were given a <b>contraceptive</b> <b>vaccine</b> {{to help keep the}} herd {{population}} down. The Forest Service also closed a portion of the Custer National Forest to livestock grazing after about 40 feral horses moved into the area, but rounded these up as well and returned them to the range.|$|E
5|$|Methods of male {{birth control}} include condoms, vasectomies and withdrawal. Between 25 and 75% of males who are sexually active would use {{hormonal}} birth control {{if it was}} available for them. A number of hormonal and non-hormonal methods are in trials, {{and there is some}} research looking at the possibility of <b>contraceptive</b> <b>vaccines.</b>|$|R
5|$|Birth {{control is}} also being {{considered}} {{as an alternative to}} hunting as a means of controlling overpopulation in wild animals. <b>Contraceptive</b> <b>vaccines</b> {{have been found to be}} effective in a number of different animal populations. Kenyan goat herders fix a skirt, called an olor, to male goats to prevent them from impregnating female goats.|$|R
25|$|Typically immunocontraception {{involves}} {{the administration of}} a vaccine that induces an adaptive immune response which causes an animal to become temporarily infertile. <b>Contraceptive</b> <b>vaccines</b> {{have been used in}} numerous settings for the control of wildlife populations. However, experts in the field believe that major innovations are required before immunocontraception can become a practical form of contraception for human beings.|$|R

Also in 2009, BLM also placed [...] "guzzlers" [...] on the range. [...] A guzzler is a precipitation (usually rainwater) collection device which traps water in a storage tank ranging in size from a few to several thousand gallons. The storage tank can be above-ground, partially buried, or below-ground. A mechanical valve releases water into a drinking trough from the storage tanks, allowing animals access to the water. When the valve senses that the water level in the trough is low, it opens and allows more water into the drinking area. Five guzzlers were placed in undergrazed areas to encourage the horses to better utilize this forage.|$|E

25|$|Also in {{the late}} 1980s, {{research}} began into the use of vaccines based around zonae pellucidae harvested from pigs {{for the purpose of}} wildlife control.

40|$|Multiple {{immunotherapy}} {{approaches are}} under development to treat various chronic diseases or conditions. Thanks to dramatic technological improvements, {{the field of}} vaccinology can now extend from prophylaxis to therapy, and from infectious diseases to dysimmune disorders like cancer or autoimmunity, or even to non-immune related conditions, including neurological or cardiovascular disorders. Life-style vaccines defined as vaccines to manage chronic conditions in healthy individuals can, therefore, also be envisaged. Three examples will be reviewed and discussed here, from both technical and ethical aspects: <b>contraceptive</b> <b>vaccines,</b> vaccines to treat addictions, and anti-dental caries vaccines. Vaccines have classically been developed to prevent infectious diseases. Thanks to a technological revolution in molecular biology, immunology and other vaccine-related techniques along with an enhanced understanding of disease mechanisms, {{it is possible to}} consider immune-related approaches to the treatment of various diseases rather than limiting immune approaches to the prevention of infectious diseases.

25|$|Immunocontraception {{is one of}} the few {{alternatives}} to lethal methods for the direct control of wildlife populations. While there was research into the use of hormonal contraception for wildlife control as early as the 1950s that produced pharmacologically effective products, they all proved to be ineffective for wildlife control for a variety of practical reasons. Field trials of immunocontraception in wildlife, on the other hand, established that <b>contraceptive</b> <b>vaccines</b> could be delivered remotely by capture gun, were safe to use in pregnant animals, were reversible, and induced long-lasting infertility, overcoming these practical limitations.|$|R

50|$|The {{company was}} {{organized}} on August 28, 1987 as Zonagen, {{to try to}} develop birth control methods based on modification of the zona pellucida—a part of the oocyte.

50|$|Zonagen, Inc. {{was formed}} in 1987 by Dunbar, Baylor {{and a group of}} investors that {{included}} Ross Perot and Lloyd Bentsen III, son of a former treasury secretary.

25|$|One {{concern about}} the use of {{hormonal}} contraceptives in general, but especially in wildlife, is that the sex steroid hormones that are used are easily passed from animal to animal. This can lead to unintended ecological consequences. For instance, fish exposed to treated sewage effluents were found to have concentrations of the synthetic hormone levonorgestrel in blood plasma higher than those found in humans taking hormonal contraceptives. Because the antigens used in <b>contraceptive</b> <b>vaccines</b> are protein, not steroids, they are not easily passed from animal to animal without loss of function.|$|R

50|$|Her research, {{which had}} been {{progressing}} well, ground to a complete halt according to Brian Wallstin of the Houston Press newspaper in his article “Biological Disaster.” The company, went public in 1993 with claims that a <b>contraceptive</b> <b>vaccine</b> was imminent.

50|$|White-tailed deer may be {{controlled}} with contraceptives in suburban areas, {{where they are}} sometimes a nuisance.

40|$|Despite high {{expectations}} of safer, effective, economical, longer acting contraceptives, to date, {{there are no}} licensed <b>contraceptive</b> <b>vaccines</b> available in the market. Nevertheless, a role for vaccines undoubtedly exists {{as an aid to}} birth spacing and as a nonsurgical means of generating sterility. The research concerned in the area so far has been successful on the feline population, with room still for exhaustive studies on humans. The future of <b>contraceptive</b> <b>vaccines</b> holds great promise in terms of comfort, price, efficacy, rare complications, and possibly nonselective action on animal populations as well as on humans. This brief review deals with the basic aspects of immunocontraceptives along with the efforts done so far. There is a need for further research in aspects involving the rate of evolution of contraception resistance based on genetics, resistance phenotypes, or cross generation effects. Gonadotropin-releasing hormone and luteinizing-hormone have not been investigated in humans, as both reported impotency in animals; the follicle-stimulating hormone has been shown to cause oligospermia; zona pellucida has also not been studied in humans as it causes irreversible oophoritis, while the sperm has the potential for success in humans based on the data from immunoreproductive studies. Even as the position of the human chorionic gonadotropin vaccine looks hopeful, research on other possible targets continue with an eventual aim of discovering a vaccine that is more immunogenically effective...|$|R
40|$|This {{review of}} the {{immunobiology}} of FSH and inhibin in animal research studies emphasizes unique behaviors of their antibodies potentially applicable to <b>contraceptive</b> <b>vaccines.</b> FSH is a di-peptide with an alpha subunit shared by LH and FSH, but a beta subunit that determines the hormone's biological action. Antibodies raised against ovine FSH in primates have induced temporary luteal inadequacy when passively transferred on specific days of the cycle. These antibodies are unusual for having different biological activity from that estimated from Scatchard plots of binding affinity. FSH antibodies passively administered to male primates have the potentially useful ability to cause temporary testicular dysfunction without compromising testosterone secretion of libido. Antibodies against intact FSH blocked FSH receptors markedly better than those raised against the beta subunit. Another unusual feature was that boosters with ovine FSH were less effective in monkeys that are boosters with heterologous FSH, either human or pork. Inhibin is also a di-peptide, synthesizes by luteal or Leydig cells, that regulates FSH synthesis and secretion. Inhibin antiserum increases circulating FSH, a connection that is being investigated for increasing ovulatory rates in sheep and cattle. Inhibin is also made in the prostate. Antibodies against human inhibin cause sperm agglutination, and raise the FSH level in male rats enough to reduce sperm counts. Much more basic research on this peptide, apparently released by at least 2 sites in the male, is needed before <b>contraceptive</b> <b>vaccines</b> can be developed...|$|R
40|$|The Sexual Revolution in the United States {{significantly}} changed {{attitudes and}} behavior and {{has led to an}} increased prevalence of risky sexual practices.

Approximately 19 million new STI cases occur each year: about half in young persons aged 15 to 24. About 750, 000 teenagers become pregnant each year.

40|$|Sperm antigens were {{assessed}} {{for their ability}} to induce cell-mediated immune (CMI) responses. Purified fertilization antigen (FA-I), protamine, and the lithium diiodosalicylate (LJS) -solubilized sperm preparation activated presensitized lymphocytes to secrete soluble mediators that activated macrophages and significantly inhibited sperm motility and embryonic development. The FA-), however, was the most potent antigen in inducing proliferative response as well as the release of soluble mediators. US-sperm preparation, which contained nu-merous antigens, showed the least activity. The unsensitized control spleen cells did not secrete any factor(s) when activated with the antigen. In conclusion, these results indicate that sperm antigens can specifically induce (CMI) factors that have detrimental effects on sperm motility and pre#{ 252 }nplantation embryos.

25|$|A vaccine induces active {{immunity}} when antigens are injected into {{an animal that}} cause it to produce desired antibodies itself. In passive immunity the desired antibody titers are achieved by injecting antibodies directly into an animal. The efficacy of such an approach for immunocontraception was demonstrated {{as early as the}} 1970s with antibodies against zonae pellucidae in mice during the investigation of the mechanism by which such antibodies inhibited fertility. Because the variability of individual immune response is an obstacle to bringing <b>contraceptive</b> <b>vaccines</b> to market, there has been research into the approach of contraception through passive immunization as an alternative that would be of less duration, but be closer to market. Research done using phage display technology on lymphocytes from immunoinfertile men led to the isolation, characterization, and synthesis of specific antibodies that inhibit fertility by acting against several of the known sperm antigens.
