5|$|Around 15:00, {{masses of}} Russian troops started {{preparations}} for the assault on Polish positions near the Jerozolimskie Gate. A strong force under Muraviev and Nostitz occupied positions {{on both sides of}} the road towards Cracow, near Rakowiec. The screening force included the Grenadier Brigade (ca. 1700 infantry, 16 guns), Cuirasseur Brigade (ca. 1,300 cavalry, 16 guns), Guard Uhlans Regiment (392 cavalry) and three cavalry regiments (ca. 1,700 cavalry, 16 guns). Between the screening forces two columns were formed. The left column commanded by Col. Nikolai Lukash was composed of Lutsk and Samogitian Infantry Regiments (1989 men altogether), with the Finland Guard Regiment in reserve (1,374 men). The <b>column</b> <b>was</b> to storm the Fort 74. The right <b>column</b> <b>was</b> commanded by Col.

This <b>column</b> <b>was</b> to assault Fort 72.

Hopkins continued to cruise off Block Island that night, hoping to catch more easy prizes. He organized the fleet into a scouting formation of two columns. The right or eastern <b>column</b> <b>was</b> headed by USS Cabot and was followed by Hopkins' flagship USS Alfred, which had 20 guns and was the largest ship of the fleet. The left <b>column</b> <b>was</b> headed by the USS Andrew Doria and was followed by USS Columbus. Behind these came USS Providence, with USS Fly and USS Wasp trailing farther behind as escorts for the prizes. The need to provide crews for the prize ships further reduced the fighting effectiveness of the fleet.|$|E

5|$|Artillery and 90mm {{tank fire}} {{destroyed}} seven more North Korean T-34 tanks, three more SU-76 towed guns, and several trucks and personnel carriers.

The North Korean <b>column</b> <b>was</b> completely destroyed. US patrols after daylight estimated the North Koreans had suffered 1,300 casualties in the fight.
