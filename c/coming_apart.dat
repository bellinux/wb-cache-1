25|$|The {{emergency}} {{portion of}} each triple valve is activated by the extremely rapid rate of reduction of train line pressure. Due {{to the length}} of trains and the small diameter of the train line, the rate of reduction is high near the front of the train (in the case of an engine operator-initiated emergency application) or near the break in the train line (in the case of the train line <b>coming</b> <b>apart).</b> Farther away from the source of the emergency application, the rate of reduction can be reduced to the point where triple valves will not detect the application as an emergency reduction. To prevent this, each triple valve's emergency portion contains an auxiliary vent port, which, when activated by an emergency application, also locally vents the train line's pressure directly to atmosphere. This serves to propagate the emergency application rapidly along {{the entire length of the}} train.|$|E
25|$|The {{critical}} architectural innovation {{designed for}} this purpose consisted of a wooden skeleton called the gaiola pombalina (Pombal Cage), a flexible rectangular frame with diagonal braces enabling structures to withstand the overload and stress of an earthquake without <b>coming</b> <b>apart.</b> This wooden frame was erected atop walls with barrel vault arches on a masonry foundation, giving solidity and weight {{to the first floor}} of the buildings, intended for occupation by shops, offices and warehouses. All new structures in the downtown area were erected on pine log pilings driven into the sandy soil of the Baixa, to ensure the effective support of their weight. They were arranged according to their importance in a horizontal hierarchy based on proximity to the street (the uppermost storey would be reserved for poorer families with few possessions, usually having lower ceilings, communal balconies, smaller windows and smaller rooms). All the buildings had masonry firewalls separating them from each other. The standardization of façades, windows, doors, simple geometric patterns in the hallway tiles, etc. permitted accelerated progress of the works through the mass production of these elements on site.|$|E

500|$|In {{the first}} book he ponders the origin {{and nature of the}} universe, {{considering}} theories by Xenophanes, Hesiod, Leucippus, Heraclitus, Thales, and Empedocles before arguing that the universe was created from the four elements and is governed by a divine spirit. Manilius holds the view that the universe is made up of two spheres: one solid (the Earth) and one hollow (the [...] "sphere of stars", often known as the firmament). The constellations are fixed in the firmament; the Earth is stationary and the firmament revolves around it, accounting for the movement of the stars at night. The planets, the moon, and the Sun revolve around the Earth in the space between its surface and the edge of the firmament. Because the Earth is {{in the center of the}} universe, it is equidistant on all sides from the firmament; thus, it remains in place at the center, as it is not compelled to [...] "fall" [...] in any specific direction. According to Manilius, the universe is ruled by a god (conspirat deus) and governed by reason (ratione gubernat); however, he is vague about the exact relationship between the deity, the universe, and reason. After Manilius finishes describing the universe, he discusses the constellations and stars and the celestial circles. In this section, Manilius places particular emphasis on the Milky Way, and he proposes six explanations for this unique celestial body: it is the place in the sky where either two hemispheres are <b>coming</b> <b>apart</b> or together, it is the former path that the Sun traveled, it is the route Phaethon took when he drove the sun chariot of Helios, it is milk that was spilled from Juno's breast, it is a concentration of small stars, or it is the abode of dead heroes. Manilius agrees with the latter point and finishes his discussion of the Milky Way by considering heroes who have earned a place in the heavens. The first book then concludes with an exploration of cometswhich Manilius sees as harbingers of disasters, such as plagues.|$|E

2500|$|A major ongoing {{critique}} about womanist {{scholarship is}} the failure of many scholars to critically address homosexuality within the black community. [...] Walker's protagonist in <b>Coming</b> <b>Apart</b> uses writings from two African-American lesbians, Audre Lorde and Louisah Teish, to support her argument that her husband should stop consuming pornography. She posts quotes from Audre Lorde above her kitchen sink. In Search of Our Mother's Garden states that a womanist is [...] "a woman who loves another woman, sexually and/or non-sexually", yet despite <b>Coming</b> <b>Apart</b> and In Search of Our Mother's Garden, {{there is very little}} literature linking womanism to the lesbian and bisexual issue. [...] Womanist theologian Renee Hill cites Christian influences as the cause of the lack of sympathy towards heterosexism and homophobia. Black feminist critic Barbara Smith blames it on the Black community's reluctance {{to come to terms with}} homosexuality. [...] On the other hand, there is an increase in the criticism of heterosexism within womanist scholarship. Christian womanist theologian Pamela R. Lightsey, in her book Our Lives Matter: A Womanist Queer Theology (2015), writes, [...] "To many people, we are still perverts. [...] To many, the Black pervert is the most dangerous threat to the American ideal. [...] Because the Black conservative bourgeoisie has joined the attack on our personhood, Black LGBTQ persons cannot allow the discourse to be controlled such that our existence within the Black community is denied or made invisible." [...] An additional critique lies within the ambivalence of womanism. In Africana womanism and African womanism, the term is associated with black nationalist discourse and the separatist movement. Patricia Collins argues that this exaggerates racial differences by promoting homogeneous identity. This is a sharp contrast to the universalist model of womanism that is championed by Walker. The continued controversy and dissidence within the various ideologies of womanism serves only to draw attention away from the goal of ending race and gender-based oppression.|$|E

40|$|Falciparum malaria {{may have}} {{infected}} Homo sapiens (and perhaps H erectus) in the Asia Pacific region {{for more than}} 100, 000 years. This estimate {{is based on the}} gene frequency of alpha-thalassaemia, the protection it affords against falciparum malaria and assumptions of untreated mortality from the infection. Up {{until the end of the}} 19 th century, there was a high mortality from malaria in the coastal parts of Malaya, but the malaria control campaign, begun in 1901 at Klang, was described by Sir Ronald Ross as the first successful antimalarial work in the (then) British Empire. This was extended to Singapore in 1911. When the Far Eastern Association of Tropical Medicine held its Fifth Biennial Congress in Singapore in 1923, malaria was still a major killing disease in parts of Malaya and Sarawak. The mechanism of life-threatening malaria involves cytoadherence of parasitised erythrocytes in microvascular beds, a process enhanced by the products of macrophage activation induced by malarial pyrogen. Improvements in the chemotherapy of life-threatening falciparum malaria with chloroquine and quinine have been countered by the emergence of resistant strains. Artemisinin derivatives may become the treatment of choice during the <b>coming</b> decade. <b>Apart</b> from traditional anti-mosquito methods, control of malaria now involves the use of insecticide-impregnated bed nets, new entomological strategies, including genetic manipulation of mosquitoes and selective chemoprophylaxis.

2500|$|Womanism has various {{definitions}} and interpretations. At its broadest definition, it is a universalist ideology for all women, regardless of color. A womanist is, according to Walker's 1979 story <b>Coming</b> <b>Apart,</b> an African-American heterosexual woman willing to utilize wisdom from African-American lesbians {{about how to}} improve sexual relationships and avoid being sexually objectified. [...] In the context of men's destructive use of pornography and their exploitation of Black women as pornographic objects, a womanist is also committed to [...] "the survival and wholeness of an entire people, male and female" [...] through confronting oppressive forces. Walker's much cited phrase, [...] "womanist is to feminist as purple is to lavender" [...] suggests that Walker considers feminism {{as a component of}} the wider ideological umbrella of womanism. It focuses on the unique experiences, struggles, needs, and desires of not just Black women, but all women of color in addition to critically addressing the dynamics of the conflict between the mainstream feminist, the Black feminist, the African feminist, and the Africana womanist movement. However, there is Black nationalist discourse prevalent within womanist work and for this reason scholars are divided between associating womanism with other similar ideologies such as Black feminism and Africana womanism or taking the stance that the three are inherently incompatible.|$|E
2500|$|The Revolutionary War soldier Nathan Hale (Yale 1773) was the {{prototype}} of the Yale ideal in the early 19thcentury: a manly yet aristocratic scholar, equally well-versed in knowledge and sports, and a patriot who [...] "regretted" [...] that he [...] "had but one life to lose" [...] for his country. Western painter Frederic Remington (Yale 1900) was an artist whose heroes gloried in combat and tests of strength in the Wild West. The fictional, turn-of-the-20th-century Yale man Frank Merriwell embodied the heroic ideal without racial prejudice, and his fictional successor Frank Stover in the novel Stover at Yale (1911) questioned the business mentality that had become prevalent at the school. Increasingly the students turned to athletic stars as their heroes, especially since winning the big game became {{the goal of the}} student body, and the alumni, as well as the team itself.Along with Harvard and Princeton, Yale students rejected elite British concepts about 'amateurism' in sports and constructed athletic programs that were uniquely American, such as football. The Harvard–Yale football rivalry began in 1875. Between 1892, when Harvard and Yale met in one of the first intercollegiate debates and 1909 (the year of the first Triangular Debate of Harvard, Yale and Princeton) the rhetoric, symbolism, and metaphors used in athletics were used to frame these early debates. Debates were covered on front pages of college newspapers and emphasized in yearbooks, and team members even received the equivalent of athletic letters for their jackets. There even were rallies sending off the debating teams to matches, but the debates never attained the broad appeal that athletics enjoyed. One reason may be that debates do not have a clear winner, {{as is the case in}} sports, and that scoring is subjective. In addition, with late 19th-century concerns about the impact of modern life on the human body, athletics offered hope that neither the individual nor the society was <b>coming</b> <b>apart.</b>|$|E

40|$|In FB {{research}} {{some studies}} have investigated the position of women involved as successors in the succession process, but very few studies have analysed women as incumbents. Until a few years ago, this issue {{would have been considered}} of little importance, given the very small number of women-owned businesses involved in a succession process. However, the increasing quantity of female firms raises questions about the specificities of a succession process from mother to son. This kind of process could indeed be a recurring one in the <b>coming</b> years. <b>Apart</b> from a few exceptions, in analyses of the succession process, women have often been described as mediators between family members, patient wives, mothers responsible for bringing up the future heir, or women living in the shadow of their husbands, fathers, sons, or brothers. An important role in transmitting family and business values to the children has been recognised by women. Women in this role have been defined as "chief emotional officer" (Jimenez, 2009), being that they hold the emotional leadership of the FB. But what happens when a woman, especially a mother, is the main actor of the succession process? Can she also act as emotional leader? Which behaviours reveal that she is acting as an emotional leader? And how does this role affect the outcome of the succession process? To answer these research questions, this paper presents an eight-year longitudinal case study (Yin, 2013). The main character is a woman who founded and ran a business and recently passed the leadership to her son. Results show that even if she was the founder, owner and leader of the business, she never lost her role as emotional leader. This behaviour has proven to be very beneficial for the succession process and business survival...|$|R

40|$|Sir Arnold Theiler Memorial Lecture {{delivered}} during Faculty Day, University of Pretoria, Faculty of Veterinary Science on August 27, 2009, Onderstepoort, South Africa. Beginning {{with the}} Swiss-born Arnold Theiler, many veterinarians have made major {{contributions to the}} understanding of infection and immunity. Sir Arnold Theiler first came to prominence when he produced a smallpox vaccine to protect mine workers, the went on to found the great South African tradition in veterinary infectious disease research. His son Max was awarded the 1951 Nobel Prize for developing the yellow fever vaccine that is still used today. That back and forth between veterinary and human medicine has, of course, been a long tradition, particulary when it comes to pathogens. My personal scientific journey began at age 17 when I started at the University of Queensland School of Veterinary Science and at least in the public sense, peaked almost 40 years later when the Nobel Foundation recognized my Swiss colleague Rolf Zinkernagel and I for discovering the basis of cell-mediated immunity. At least in those distant days when I was an undergraduate, veterinarians weren't too interested in genetics and degenerative conditions, but were well trained to deal with infections. My interest in viral pathogenesis and immunity began as an undergraduate and remains fundamental to what I do in science today. I'll relate some of that personal journey from student, to veterinary scientist, to experimental pathologist, to research immunologist to being a public advocate for rational enquiry and cultural values that emphasize an evidence-based view of the world. Now as then, we may begin our professional lives with one focus, but may end up somewhere very different. A training in veterinary Science gives a respect for reality, a knowledge that the world can never be a totally safe place, a set of practical skills, a sold scientific grounding and an understanding of ecological balance and sustainable production systems. That can be a pretty good place to startas we seek to do our part in dealing with the all too real problems that face humanity through this <b>coming</b> century. <b>Apart</b> from anything else, the challenge of feeding people will be very much to the fore.
