5000|$|Restriction enzymes can {{generate}} {{a wide variety}} of ends in the DNA they digest, but in cloning experiments most commonly-used restriction enzymes generate a 4-base single-stranded overhang called the sticky or <b>cohesive</b> <b>end</b> (exceptions include NdeI which generates a 2-base overhang, and those that generate blunt ends). These sticky ends can anneal to other compatible ends and become ligated in a sticky-end (or <b>cohesive</b> <b>end)</b> ligation. EcoRI for example generates an AATT end, and since A and T have lower melting temperature than C and G, its melting temperature Tm is low at around 6°C. For most restriction enzymes, the overhangs generated have a Tm that is around 15°C. [...] For practical purposes, sticky end ligations are performed at 12-16°C, or at room temperature, or alternatively at 4°C for a longer period.|$|R

The reaction is markedly stimulated by ATP, Mg 2 +, spermidine, and one or more uncharacterized factors present in extracts of uninfected Escherichia coli cells.

50|$|Unlike plasmids, {{they can}} also be {{packaged}} in phage capsids, which allows the foreign genes to be transferred into or between cells by transduction. Plasmids become unstable after a certain amount of DNA has been inserted into them, because their increased size is more conducive to recombination. To circumvent this, phage transduction is used instead. This is made possible by the <b>cohesive</b> <b>ends,</b> also known as cos sites. In this way, they are similar to using the lambda phage as a vector, except all the lambda genes have been deleted {{with the exception of the}} cos sequence.|$|E

In the modified vector, EMBL 3 cos, all the phage coding sequences are placed {{to the right of}} the cloning sites so that the left <b>cohesive</b> <b>end</b> is separated by only 200 bp, rather than 20 kb (as in conventional lambda vectors), from the inserted DNA fragment. We show that reliable restriction maps can be rapidly constructed from partial digests of clones made in this vector by labelling the left <b>cohesive</b> <b>end</b> with a complementary 32 P-labelled oligonucleotide. In addition, we quantify the restriction of clones containing human DNA by the McrA and McrB systems of E. coli and show that the use of Mcr- plating strains can increase the yield of recombinant phage up to tenfold, to give cloning efficiencies of greater than or equal to 10 (7) pfu/microgram of human DNA...|$|R

40|$|Integrated {{hepatitis}} B virus (HBV) DNA {{is found}} in hepatocellular carcinomas which develop in HBV carriers. Presented here are the results of analyses of four integrants that show chromosomal rearrangements associated with the integrated HBV DNA. Two clones (p 4 and C 15) {{were found to have}} large inverted repeating structures, each consisting of HBV genome along with flanking cellular sequences. The structure must have arisen by duplication of the primary integrant, including the flanking cellular DNA, followed by recombination within the viral DNA. One of the two viral arms in each clone joins to the other viral arm at the "cohesive end region. " Two clones (DA 2 - 2 and DA 2 - 6) were found to have integrated HBV sequences, each flanked by cellular DNAs from different chromosomes (chromosome X joined to 17 and chromosome 5 joined to 9). They must be the products of cellular DNA translocations using the integrated HBV DNA as the switch point. The viral DNA in each clone is a continuous stretch of a single virus genome with one <b>end</b> in the <b>cohesive</b> <b>end</b> region. These complex structures seem to have been produced by activation of the <b>cohesive</b> <b>end</b> of an integrant viral genome, followed by its recombination with another chromosomal DNA...|$|R
50|$|This method {{results in}} a library of genes with {{multiple}} crossovers from several parental genes. This method does not require sequence identity among the parental genes. This does require one or two conserved amino acids at every crossover position. It begins with alignment of parental sequences and identification of consensus regions which serve as crossover sites. This {{is followed by the}} incorporation of specific tags containing restriction sites followed by the removal of the tags by digestion with Bac1, resulting in genes with <b>cohesive</b> <b>ends.</b> These gene fragments are mixed and ligated in an appropriate order to form chimeric libraries.|$|E
50|$|Since blunt-ended DNA {{fragments}} have no <b>cohesive</b> <b>ends</b> to anneal, {{the melting}} temperature {{is not a}} factor to consider within the normal temperature range of the ligation reaction. The limiting factor in blunt end ligation is not {{the activity of the}} ligase but rather the number of alignments between DNA fragment ends that occur. The most efficient ligation temperature for blunt-ended DNA would therefore be the temperature at which the greatest number of alignments can occur. The majority of blunt-ended ligations are carried out at 14-25 °C overnight. The absence of stably annealed ends also means that the ligation efficiency is lowered, requiring a higher ligase concentration to be used.|$|E
5000|$|A sticky or {{cohesive}} end has protruding single-stranded strands with unpaired nucleotides called overhangs, each overhang can anneal with another complementary one to form base pairs. The two complementary <b>cohesive</b> <b>ends</b> of DNA can anneal together via hydrogen bonding, {{the stability of}} these paired ends depends on the melting temperature of the paired overhangs. DNA ligase can join two adjacent strands of DNA by forming a covalent bond between the sugar-phosphate moieties of adjacent nucleotides to join the two together via a phosphodiester bond in a process called ligation. The blunt ends however do not have such protruding strands, and therefore cannot anneal together, and consequently ligation between blunt ends is less efficient.|$|E

50|$|Longer {{overhangs}} {{are called}} <b>cohesive</b> <b>ends</b> or sticky ends. They {{are most often}} created by restriction endonucleases when they cut DNA. Very often they cut the two DNA strands four base pairs from each other, creating a four-base 5' overhang in one molecule and a complementary 5' overhang in the other. These ends are called cohesive since they are easily joined back together by a ligase. Also, since different restriction endonucleases usually create different overhangs, {{it is possible to}} cut a piece of DNA with two different enzymes and then join it with another DNA molecule with ends created by the same enzymes. Since the overhangs have to be complementary in order for the ligase to work, the two molecules can only join in one orientation. This is often highly desirable in molecular biology.|$|E
50|$|In 1991, Zabarovsky et al. {{proposed}} {{a new approach}} for construction of jumping libraries. This approach included the use of two separate λ vectors for library construction, and a partial filling-in reaction that removes {{the need for a}} selectable marker. This filling-in reaction worked by destroying the specific <b>cohesive</b> <b>ends</b> (resulting from restriction digests) of the DNA fragments that were nonligated and noncircularized, thus preventing them from cloning into the vectors, in a more energy-efficient and accurate manner. Furthermore, this improved technique required less DNA to start with, and also produced a library that could be transferred into a plasmid form, making it easier to store and replicate. Using this new approach, they successfully constructed a human NotI jumping library from a lymphoblastoid cell line and a human chromosome 3-specific NotI jumping library from a human chromosome 3 and mouse hybrid cell line.|$|E
5000|$|A nick in the DNA (i.e. a {{break in}} one strand of a {{double-stranded}} DNA) can be repaired very efficiently by the ligase. However, a complicating feature of ligation presents itself when ligating two separate DNA ends as the two ends need to come together before the ligation reaction can proceed. In the ligation of DNA with sticky or <b>cohesive</b> <b>ends,</b> the protruding strands of DNA may be annealed together already, therefore it is a relatively efficient process as it is equivalent to repairing two nicks in the DNA. However, in the ligation of blunt-ends, which lack protruding ends for the DNA to anneal together, the process is dependent on random collision for the ends to align together {{before they can be}} ligated, and is consequently a much less efficient process. [...] The DNA ligase from E. coli cannot ligate blunt-ended DNA except under conditions of molecular crowding, and it is therefore not normally used for ligation in the laboratory. Instead the DNA ligase from phage T4 is used as it can ligate blunt-ended DNA as well as single-stranded DNA.|$|E

40|$|Diseases {{caused by}} Mycobacterium tuberculosis, M. leprae and M. avium, cause {{significant}} {{morbidity and mortality}} worldwide. Effective treatments require that the organisms be speciated and that drug susceptibilities for the causative organisms be characterized. Reporter phage technology has been developed as a rapid and convenient method for identifying mycobacterial species and evaluating drug resistance. In this report we describe the construction of luciferase reporter phages from mycobacterio-phage D 29 DNA. Shuttle phasmids were first constructed with D 29 {{in order to identify}} non-essential regions of the D 29 genomes and to introduce unique cloning sites within that region. Using this approach, we observed that all of the D 29 shuttle phasmids had the cosmid vector localized to one area of the phage genome near one <b>cohesive</b> <b>end.</b> These shuttle phasmids had been constructed with a cosmid that could be readily excised from the D 29 genome with different sets of restriction enzymes. Luciferase reporter phages were made by substituting the luciferase cassette for the cosmid vector. Recombinant phages with the luciferase cassette fall into two groups. One group produced light and had the expression cassette oriented with the promoter directing transcription away from the <b>cohesive</b> <b>end.</b> In contrast, the other group had the expression cassette in the opposite orientation and failed to produce light during lytic infection, but did produce light in L 5 lysogens which are known to repress D 29 promoters. These results suggest that a phage promoter of the D 29 phage can occlude the expression of a promoter introduced into this region. D 29 luciferase reporter phages are capable of detecting low numbers of L 5 lysogens like L 5 luciferase phages. However, unlike L 5 luciferase phages, D 29 luciferase phages can readily infect M. tuberculosis and M. bovis BCG, demonstrating that these phages can be used to evaluate drug susceptibilities of many types of mycobacteria...|$|R

Walter Gilbert and Allan Maxam at Harvard also developed sequencing methods, including one for [...] "DNA sequencing by chemical degradation".

Advancements in sequencing were aided by the concurrent development of recombinant DNA technology, allowing DNA samples to be isolated from sources other than viruses.|$|E
5000|$|Two {{issues are}} {{involved}} {{when considering the}} temperature of a ligation reaction. First, the optimum temperature for DNA ligase activity which is 37°C, and second, the melting temperature (Tm) of the DNA ends to be ligated. The melting temperature is dependent on length and base composition of the DNA overhang—the greater the number of G and C, the higher the Tm since there are three hydrogen bonds formed between G-C base pair compared to two for A-T base pair—with some contribution from the stacking of the bases between fragments. For the ligation reaction to proceed efficiently, the ends should be stably annealed, and in ligation experiments, the Tm of the DNA ends is generally much lower than 37°C. The optimal temperature for ligating <b>cohesive</b> <b>ends</b> is therefore a compromise between the best temperature for DNA ligase activity and the Tm where the ends can associate. [...] However, different restriction enzymes generates different ends, and the base composition of the ends produce by these enzymes may also differ, the melting temperature and therefore the optimal temperature can vary widely depending on the restriction enzymes used, and the optimum temperature for ligation may be between 4-15°C depending on the ends. Ligations also often involve ligating ends generated from different restriction enzymes in the same reaction mixture, therefore {{it may not be}} practical to select optimal temperature for a particular ligation reaction and most protocols simply choose 12-16°C, room temperature, or 4°C.|$|E

Analysis of EcoRI endonuclease expression in vivo revealed that, in contrast to DSBs containing damaged or modified termini, chromosomal DSBs retaining complementary ends could be repaired in rad 52 mutants and in G 1 -phase Rad+ cells. Continuous EcoRI-induced scission of chromosomal DNA blocked the growth of rad 52 mutants, with most cells arrested in G 2 phase. Surprisingly, rad 52 mutants were not more sensitive to EcoRI-induced cell killing than wild-type strains. In contrast, endonuclease expression was lethal in cells deficient in Ku-mediated end joining. Checkpoint-defective rad 9 mutants did not arrest cell cycling and lost viability rapidly when EcoRI was expressed. Synthesis of the endonuclease produced extensive breakage of nuclear DNA and stimulated interchromosomal recombination.
