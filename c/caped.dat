40|$|<b>Cape</b> Verdeanness {{is another}} name for <b>Cape</b> Verdean {{cultural}} identity. Postcolonial <b>Cape</b> Verdeanness refers to <b>Cape</b> Verdeanness as it has expressed itself since July 5, 1975, {{the first day of}} <b>Cape</b> Verdean independence. Postcolonial <b>Cape</b> Verdeanness has previously been described at length in the social sciences scholarship. Postcolonial <b>Cape</b> Verdeanness has previously been implicitly rather than explicitly represented in descriptions of postcolonial <b>Cape</b> Verdean poetry in the scholarly literature. This study is a first of its kind consideration of postcolonial <b>Cape</b> Verdeanness. It is also the first time <b>Cape</b> Verdeanness of any kind has been explicitly represented by means of a review of <b>Cape</b> Verdean cultural productions. The methods of this study include a review of the findings of the social sciences regarding postcolonial <b>Cape</b> Verdeanness, a review of the scholarly literature on postcolonial <b>Cape</b> Verdean poetry, and an analysis of a group of postcolonial <b>Cape</b> Verdean poems, including contributions from both the <b>Cape</b> Verdean Islands and the <b>Cape</b> Verdean diaspora. The findings of this study are that postcolonial <b>Cape</b> Verdean poetry provides a significant lens into postcolonial <b>Cape</b> Verdeanness that both overlaps and complements the lens on <b>Cape</b> Verdeanness provided by the social sciences. Furthermore, postcolonial <b>Cape</b> Verdeanness demonstrates a rupture from colonial-era <b>Cape</b> Verdeanness. Because of this rupture, <b>Cape</b> Verdeanness has now expanded to reflect universal concerns in addition to specifically <b>Cape</b> Verdean ones. [URL]...|$|R

25|$|Dancer in a café depicts strikingly fashionable {{women and}} men {{at the height of}} Parisian fashion in 1912. The dancer dressed in a directoire-style beaded and {{embroidered}} green silk velvet and chiffon <b>caped</b> evening gown embellished with celluloid sequins and gold trim, her hair coiffed in an elegant chignon, appears on a low stage or table performing for patrons or guests, all fashionably dressed and coiffed in silk and beaded net gowns, silver brocade and lace full-length gowns, ostrich-plumed hats, patterned suit, fedora and black tie. The artist depicts the figures and background as a series of subdivided facets and planes, presenting multiple aspects of the café scene simultaneously. This {{can be seen in the}} deliberate positioning of light, shadow, the nonconventional use of chiaroscuro, of form and color, and the way in which Metzinger assimilates the fusion of the background with the figures. The manifold surface has a complex geometry of reticulations with intricate series of (almost mathematical looking) black lines that appear in sections as underdrawing and in others as overdrawing.|$|E
25|$|She {{intended}} the final corrida of the 1949 season, in Jaén, Spain, {{to be the}} last of her career. She appeared in the ring together with the matadors Manolo Vázquez and Antonio Ordóñez. After performing on horseback with the bull, Cintrón rode to the box of the presidente and asked for permission to dismount for the kill. Permission was denied. This was her signal to leave the arena, and leave the killing of the bull to the novillero assigned to her for that task. Instead, she dismounted, grabbed his sword and muleta, <b>caped</b> the bull and prepared it for the kill. She actually went in for the kill and then dramatically let the sword drop to the sand. The bull charged. Cintrón stepped from his path and simulated the kill by touching his shoulders with her fingers as he rushed by. Pandemonium erupted in the stands and the audience threw hats and red carnations at her feet. The novillero then entered the ring and performed the kill, as originally planned.|$|E

Jackson {{felt that it}} served as the episode's highlight, and further assessed that she emulated actress Linda Hamilton. [...] "After a season of whining, there {{had to have been}} at least a few fans pulling for the walkers in her early scenes, but she quickly became Linda Hamilton-badass, braining zombies with her foot," [...] he said. Likewise, Kine asserted that [...] "the badass she has tried so hard to convince us all she is finally came across." [...] Ryan thought that Andrea's struggle to survive was a strong way to build up the exodus of the group. She spoke of her scene with Michonne: [...] "She'd fought so hard to live that I wanted Andrea to fend off that final batch of walkers successfully. When it appeared she might not live, I was, quite rightly, {{on the edge of my}} seat. And the appearance of the <b>caped</b> figure—towing two armless walkers, no less—was as dramatic as could be." ...|$|E
500|$|The Daily Telegraphs Tom Hoggins {{praised the}} game's sense of {{progress}} in discovering and mastering the character abilities, and the [...] "show-stopping brutality" [...] of the improved combat system. Hoggins highlighted the Catwoman campaign as a [...] "delight" [...] and fitting lithe contrast to Batman's strength, but lamented the campaign's short length. The Guardians Nick Cowen labeled it the best Batman game of all time, praising the variety of side missions and content, the large cast of iconic characters, and the satisfying challenge of the Riddler missions. The Australian Official PlayStation Magazine awarded a perfect score of 10 stating that the game [...] "is not only the best superhero game ever made, it's {{one of the best}} games ever made... it brings the <b>Caped</b> Crusader's world to life better than any comic, movie or television show before it".

500|$|Anarky's {{appearance}} in Batman: Arkham Origins included a speech {{delivered at the}} conclusion of the character's story arch. The player is given the opportunity to observe Anarky after he has been defeated, and watch as the teenager enters a monologue in which he laments the downfall of society, tries to reconcile his admiration for Batman, and ultimately denounces the <b>Caped</b> Crusader as a false hero. Nick Dinicola of PopMatters, in comparing the game to its predecessor, Batman: Arkham City, asserted that the narrative of Origins consistently challenged Batman's ideological reasons for acting as he does, whereas City uncritically took his motivations as a given. [...] "Anarky’s wonderful speech takes Batman to task for the contradictions in his symbolism," [...] writes Dinicola, choosing that moment in the game as one of several examples of this theme. [...] "Considering that Batman is very explicitly a symbol of fear, Anarky is equating the rise of Batman with the downfall of society." [...] Dinicola was also of the opinion that the willingness to use characters like Anarky to scrutinize Batman's heroism, rather than simply assert it, allowed the game to ultimately prove and uphold Batman as a heroic figure in a way City could not. To Dinicola, this validated the act of challenging a superhero's traditional interpretation in service to the story.|$|E
