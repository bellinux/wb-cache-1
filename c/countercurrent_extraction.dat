5000|$|Chromatography methods {{changed little}} after Tsvet's work until the {{explosion}} of mid-20th century research in new techniques, particularly thanks {{to the work of}} Archer John Porter Martin and Richard Laurence Millington Synge. By [...] "the marrying of two techniques, that of chromatography and that of countercurrent solvent extraction", Martin and Synge developed partition chromatography to separate chemicals with only slight differences in partition coefficients between two liquid solvents. [...] Martin, who had previously been working in vitamin chemistry (including attempts to purify vitamin E), began collaborating with Synge in 1938, brought his experience with equipment design to Synge's project of separating amino acids. After unsuccessful experiments with complex <b>countercurrent</b> <b>extraction</b> machines and liquid-liquid chromatography methods where the liquids move in opposite directions, Martin hit on the idea of using silica gel in columns to hold water stationary while an organic solvent flows through the column. Martin and Synge demonstrated the potential of the methods by separating amino acids marked in the column by the addition of methyl red. [...] In a series of publications beginning in 1941, they described increasingly powerful methods of separating amino acids and other organic chemicals.|$|E

In this research, almost completely separation of V(V) and Cr(VI) with primary amine N 1923 was firstly demonstrated by employing multistage <b>countercurrent</b> <b>extraction</b> (MCE) with annular centrifugal contactors (ACCs). The optimum operation conditions of single-stage extraction with ACC were determined by systematic experiments, and best conditions of the rotor speed, the flow rate and the flow ratio of organic phase to aqueous phase were obtained. The loaded-organic phase can be reused for extraction process after stripping with ammonia/sodium hydroxide. Vanadium, in the leaching/aqueous solution with the initial pH of 6. 1, was reached to extraction equilibrium by three-stage <b>countercurrent</b> <b>extraction</b> with ACCs. V(V) and Cr(VI) were separated through 21 stages of <b>countercurrent</b> <b>extraction</b> with ACCs. 95. 1 % of vanadium and almost none of chromium were extracted, with the separation factor approaching infinity. Through the mechanism of hydrogen bond association and different species of two metals in the leaching/aqueous solution, an in-depth analysis to correlate the results obtained and the chemical reactions with ACCs {{has been made in}} order to establish a firm conclusion with aim of the guidance in industrial application.

40|$|International audienceThis work {{concerns}} the purification of wet process phosphoric acid (WPA) by solvent extraction with {{methyl isobutyl ketone}} (MIBK) at 40 degreesC. For this purpose, an exhaustive study of the multicomponent extraction system WPA-MIBK was carried out. In a first step., {{the distribution of the}} main components (H 3 PO 4, H 2 O, MIBK) and the major impurities of WPA (Ca 2 +, Mg 2 +, Al 3 +, Fe 3 +, SO 42 -, F-) between the conjugated phases was systematically studied. Then, expression of phase compositions in terms of H 3 PO 4, H 2 O and MIBK on an impurity-free basis enabled us to compute the characteristics of the H 3 PO 4 <b>countercurrent</b> multistage <b>extraction</b> using the Mac Cabe-Thiele method. Both as-received and water-saturated MIBK were considered as solvent. From graphical results, optimum conditions to conduct the extraction of H 3 PO 4 from concentrated WPAs (53. 5 - 58 % P 2 O 5) were determined.

Membrane based separation relies on the exploitation of surface forces {{and the use of}} a membrane wetted by one of the phases; however, successful separation requires accurate control of pressures making the operation and implementation cumbersome. Here we present an improved separator design that integrates a pressure control element to ensure that adequate operating conditions are always maintained. Additionally, the integrated pressure control decouples the separator from downstream unit operations. A detailed examination of the controlling physical equations shows how to design the device to allow operation across a wide range of conditions.

The optimal conditions of MMCE for the extraction of DMY can be determined to be the ratio of the extraction solvent to plant material of 30 : 1, the extraction time of 5 min, the extraction temperature of 110 °C and the microwave power of 600 W. In addition, the extraction efficiency of the MMCE method was compared with that of the microwave static batch extraction (MSBE) under the optimum extraction conditions.

40|$|The meat {{of sharks}} {{and other members}} of the family Elasmobranchii {{contains}} urea. Urease, present in fish muscle or released by microbes grown during storage, catalyzes the decomposition of urea to ammonia, which is responsible for off-flavor and odor in products from fish containing urea. Therefore, it is necessary to r~move urea in the preparation of FPC (fish protein concentrate) from shark meat, if the FPC is to be utilized as a highly nutritive animal protein supplement in food to combat human malnutrition in developing and underdeveloped countries. For the production of urea-free FPC, multistage cross-current solvent <b>extraction,</b> multistage <b>countercurrent</b> solvent <b>extraction</b> and an aqueous phosphate process in combination with multistage <b>countercurrent</b> solvent <b>extraction</b> were tried, Ethanol (95 %) and commercial hexane were used as solvents to remove urea, moisture and lipids in the crosscurrent and countercurrent methods. In the aqueous phosphate process, hexametaphosphate at pH 4. 0 was used to precipitate protein from an aqueous medium while urea was removed with the water phase. Subsequent solvent extraction reduced the moisture and lipid levels to below the FDA limits of 10 % and 0. 5 %, respectively. In all stages the solvent was added in the ratio of one ml per gram of ground raw fish. Starting with shark meat containing 1. 1 % urea and 13. 4 % lipids, the urea and lipid levels in the FPC were 0. 16 and 0. 61 %, respectively, following <b>countercurrent</b> solvent <b>extraction</b> using three ethanol stages followed by three hexane stages with 15 minute extraction periods. Six crosscurrent ethanol extractions with 60 minute extraction periods reduced the urea level in the FPC to a trace, while the lipid was 0. 41 %. The FPC produced by these methods was white or light cream colored with no or slight amine and fishy odor and good functional properties. The FPC produced by the aqueous phosphate process followed by <b>countercurrent</b> solvent <b>extraction</b> was better in color, odor, flavor and texture than FPC produced by the solvent extraction alone.

40|$|A {{procedure}} for {{the recovery of}} aromatic extracts from raw grape-spirit (alcohol strength 73 vol. %) {{by means of a}} <b>countercurrent</b> supercritical fluid <b>extraction</b> (CC-SFE) on a pilot plant scale is presented. The effect of the solvent-to-feed ratio at 7, 8, 10, and 20 kg CO 2 /kg Feed on the extraction of flavor compounds, operating at constant pressure of 100 bar and extraction temperature of 50 °C have been studied. Increasing the solvent-to-feed ratio from 7 to 20 kg CO 2 /kg Feed, the total volatile compounds yield decreases from 64 to 5 % and that of ethanol from 85 to 49 %. The highest concentration of volatile compounds has been obtained at 7 and 8 kg CO 2 /kg Feed solvent-to-feed ratio. Mixtures containing grape-spirit (alcohol strength 40 vol. %) added with 30 % (v/v) of different extracts have been tested and judged by a panel. Sensory evaluation indicated as preferred the mixtures added with the extracts obtained at lowest solvent-to-feed ratio...|$|R
40|$|A plant level {{simulation}} of the UREX+ 3 a separations {{process has been}} developed using AMUSE for solvent extraction calculations coupled with Aspen Plus for other operations. AMUSE, an Excel based application developed at Argonne National Laboratory [1], performs a rigorous calculation of <b>countercurrent</b> solvent <b>extraction</b> processes using thermodynamically based distribution coefficients specifically designed for nuclear separations. Aspen Plus [2] models simulate other separations plant operations such as head end assembly chopping and dissolution, product solidification, acid recovery, off-gas treatment and waste water treatment. The model predicts that 55 feed streams and 14 output streams will be generated by separations plant operation. On the basis of one metric ton of initial reactor fuel, the model predicts a plant throughput of approximately 200 metric tonnes of material. Approximately half is treated waste water. Another 30 % is gas emissions arising from feed to the calcination furnaces. The gas stream is treated for discharge to the environment. About 5 % of the throughput is product material. Another 10 % is recovered organics and acid that may be recycled. The remaining 5 % is contaminated waste that requires disposal. While these results are preliminary, the model has successfully simulated operation of the UREX+ 3 a separations process. Coupling AMUSE to Aspen Plus provides rigorous solvent extraction calculations directly within the plant simulation, greatly increasing {{the accuracy of the}} model. Many areas, such as acid recycle, can be optimized to improve performance and reduce material usage and waste generation. The rigorous plant simulation model resulting from this work provides a framework to conduct such studies. The model is easily modified to simulate other variations of the UREX+ process...|$|R
