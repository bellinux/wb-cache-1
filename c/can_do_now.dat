500|$|The {{impact was}} a {{substantial}} news event reported and discussed online, in print, and on television. There {{was a genuine}} suspense because experts held widely differing opinions over {{the result of the}} impact. Various experts debated whether the impactor would go straight through the comet and out the other side, would create an impact crater, would open up a hole in the interior of the comet, and other theories. However, twenty-four hours before impact, the flight team at JPL began privately expressing a high level of confidence that, barring any unforeseen technical glitches, the spacecraft would intercept Tempel 1. One senior personnel member stated [...] "All we <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>now</b> is sit back and wait. Everything we can technically do to ensure impact has been done." [...] In the final minutes as the impactor hit the comet, more than 10,000 people watched the collision on a giant movie screen at Hawaii's Waikiki Beach.|$|E
500|$|On January 27, 1991, at a music {{industry}} {{party at the}} Po Na Na Souk club in Hollywood, Dr. Dre assaulted television host Dee Barnes of the Fox television program Pump it Up, because he felt dissatisfied with her news report about the feud between the remaining N.W.A members and Ice Cube. Barnes filed a $22.7 million lawsuit {{in response to the}} incident. Subsequently, Dr. Dre was fined $2,500, given two years' probation, ordered to undergo 240 hours of community service, and given a spot on an anti-violence public service announcement on television. The civil suit was settled out of court. Barnes stated that Young [...] "began slamming her face and the right side of her body repeatedly against a wall near the stairway." [...] Dr. Dre later commented [...] "People talk all this shit, but you know, somebody fucks with me, I'm gonna fuck with them. I just did it, you know.

Behind the scenes high-ranking Air Force officers are soberly concerned about the UFOs. However, through official secrecy and ridicule, many citizens are led to believe the unknown flying objects are nonsense...

[...] In 1962, in his letter of resignation from NICAP, he told director Donald Keyhoe, [...] "I know the UFOs are not U.S. or Soviet devices.

[...] Leibowitz objected that the argument was [...] "an appeal to passion and prejudice" [...] and moved for a mistrial. Knight agreed that it was an appeal to passion, and Callahan overruled the motion. Knight continued, [...] "We all have a passion, all men in this court room to protect the womanhood in Alabama." [...] For his summation, solicitor Wade Wright reviewed the testimony and warned the jury, [...] "that this crime could have happened to any woman, even though she was riding in a parlor car, instead of box car." ...|$|E

He asked Yoshijirō Umezu if [...] "the war should be continued even at the risk of launching a coup d'état," [...] to which Umezu concluded that, [...] "There is nothing we <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>now</b> but to comply with the Emperor's decision." [...] Anami then confronted a Colonel Saburo Hayashi in a washroom and asked about [...] "the possibility of attacking a large American convoy rumored to be outside of Tokyo." [...] Hayashi dashed Anami's suggestion by reaffirming the Imperial decision while noting the presence of the convoy was only a rumor. Finally, his brother-in-law Lieutenant Colonel Masahiko Takeshita confronted Anami first suggesting Anami resign, which would topple the government, then suggesting he support the coup. To the first, Anami noted that the fall of the government would not stop the Imperial edict, while to the second, he replied that he wished to go to the Army Ministry first.|$|E
