40|$|We aim at {{detecting}} moving {{objects in}} color image sequences acquired with a mobile camera. This issue is of key importance in many application fields. To accurately recover motion boundaries, we exploit a fine spatial image partition supplied by a MRF-based color segmentation algorithm. We introduce a region-level graph modeling {{embedded in a}} Markovian framework to detect moving objects in the scene viewed by a mobile camera. This is stated as the binary segmentation into regions <b>conforming</b> or <b>not</b> <b>conforming</b> to the dominant image motion assumed {{to be due to}} the camera movement. The method is validated on real image sequences...|$|R
40|$|Limit {{standards}} are probabilistic requirements or benchmarks regarding {{the proportion of}} replications <b>conforming</b> or <b>not</b> <b>conforming</b> to a desired threshold. Sample proportions resulting from the analysis of replications {{are known to be}} beta distributed. As a result, standard constructs for defining a confidence interval on such a proportion, based on critical points from the normal or Student’s t distribution, are increasingly inaccurate as the mean sample proportion approaches the limits of 0 or 1. We consider the Bayesian relationship between the beta and binomial distributions as the foundation for a sequential methodology in the analysis of limit standards. The benefits of using the beta distribution methodology are variance reduction, and smaller sample size (when compared to other analysis methodologies). ...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{stimulated by}} the {{publication}} some years ago in France of a small book on medical reasoning, legal and medical reasoning are compared. The question that is asked is whether {{the differences between the}} two types of reasoning will permit one to have a better understanding of some of the methodological and epistemological issues associated with legal reasoning. It will be argued that although medical and legal reasoners do share things in common, legal reasoning, perhaps unlike medical reasoning, is actually concerned less with the explanation or even comprehension of texts or the facts of a dispute (explicatio causæ) and more with what will be termed the ‘manipulation’ of facts (accommodatio factorum). Lawyers purify and (or) construct ‘virtual’ factual situations out of perceived ‘actual’ factual situations in order to make them <b>conform</b> or <b>not</b> <b>conform</b> in an isomorphic way with factual situations implied by a legal text or precedent. Medical reasoning is equally complex but facts are read in a different way...|$|R
40|$|The article {{argues that}} masculinity and {{femininity}} {{should not be}} understood narrowly as mutually exclusive bipolar opposites. Every individual. female or male should he assessed on a continuum of femininity and masculinity qualities. Thus. it is the 'amount' or preponderance of either masculinity or femininity traits that vary from one individual to another in both males and females. We will also argue that not all females are necessarily feminine and that not all males are necessarily masculine. With close reference to the two written plays, we will further argue that femininity or masculinity should not he simplistically understood to be determined only {{by the process of}} socialisation. It will be argued that it is not only socialisation that determines one's masculinity or femininity as to suggest so is to not only be deterministic, but also essentialist. static and dichotomous. It will be concluded that masculinity or femininity in males and females is the outcome of one's willingness to <b>conform</b> or <b>not</b> <b>conform</b> to societal expectations and to some extent, the biology...|$|R
40|$|In this research, we {{examined}} the malleability of processing fluency from the angle of people's a priori expectation of how fluently stimuli will be processed. Results from three {{studies suggest that the}} value of the fluency experience is contingent on how easy or difficult people expect the incoming information would be processed. Specifically, participants had higher evaluations of the target when their experienced processing fluency <b>conformed</b> (vs. did <b>not</b> <b>conform)</b> to their expected processing fluency. We also found that the interactive effect between expected fluency and experienced fluency was mediated by a sense of assurance when people's subjective fluency experience conformed to their expectations. Moreover, we showed that a positive effect of processing fluency occurred when people are under cognitive load (affective route); and interpreting the fluency experience in terms of one's expected fluency occurs when people had enough cognitive capacity (interpretive route).

40|$|The {{fronting}} {{of the mid}} {{and high}} back vowels /ow, u, uw / differentiates the major dialects of English in North America. In particular, the fronting of these vowels {{has been described as}} a feature of two regional vowel movements: the California Movement and the Canadian Shift. The purpose of the present study is to document the production of these vowels in the speech of residents of Portland, Oregon, and see if this Pacific Northwest speech illuminates dialect research by seeing how patterns here <b>conform</b> or do <b>not</b> <b>conform</b> to patterns others elsewhere. Data were collected from a sample of eighteen Portland speakers. Nine males and nine females from three different age groupings and two different social classes were interviewed in order to elicit naturalistic speech. Word-sized files containing relevant vowel tokens were extracted from each interview. Each vowel token was then analyzed in a three-step process: 1) Vowel formants were calculated and measured with spectrographic analysis. 2) The data from each speaker were normalized to account for physiological differences...|$|R
