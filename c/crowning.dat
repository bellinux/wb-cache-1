5|$|A {{coronation}} is the act {{of placement}} or bestowal of a crown upon a monarch's head. The term generally also refers {{not only to the}} physical <b>crowning</b> but to the whole ceremony wherein {{the act of}} <b>crowning</b> occurs, along with the presentation of other items of regalia, marking the formal investiture of a monarch with regal power. Aside from the <b>crowning,</b> a coronation ceremony may comprise many other rituals such as the taking of special vows by the monarch, the investing and presentation of regalia to the monarch, and acts of homage by the new ruler's subjects and the performance of other ritual deeds of special significance to the particular nation. Western-style coronations have often included anointing the monarch with holy oil, or chrism as it is often called; the anointing ritual's religious significance follows examples found in the Bible. The monarch's consort may also be crowned, either simultaneously with the monarch or as a separate event.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} tree <b>crown</b> envelope shape modeling {{from the}} perspective of optical passive remote sensing. The aims are 1) to review the specific requirements of <b>crown</b> shape models and ground measurement techniques in optical remote sensing, and 2) to present preliminary results from empirical, parametric <b>crown</b> shape and volume modeling of Scots pine and Norway spruce applicable in Finland. Results indicated that the basic dimensions (maximum radius, its height and <b>crown</b> length) of tree <b>crowns</b> were better predicted for pines, but the profile shape of {{the upper part of the}} <b>crowns</b> varied more than in spruce. Pine <b>crowns</b> were also slightly less concave than spruce <b>crowns.</b> No regularities were observed concerning the lower part of the <b>crowns.</b> The asymmetry of <b>crowns</b> increased as a function of tree age for both species, spruce <b>crowns</b> being more asymmetric than pine <b>crowns.</b> A comparison of measured <b>crown</b> volume with several simple geometrical <b>crown</b> shape envelopes showed that using a cone as a <b>crown</b> shape model for Scots pine and Norway spruce underestimates <b>crown</b> volume most severely. Other <b>crown</b> envelope shape models (e. g. ellipsoids) rendered <b>crown</b> volumes closer to the measured volume and did not differ considerably from each other...|$|R

5|$|Bridges over {{waterways}} {{had been}} known in China since the ancient Zhou dynasty. During the Song dynasty, large trestle bridges were constructed, such as that built by Zhang Zhongyan in 1158. There were also large bridges made entirely of stone, like the Ba Zi Bridge of Shaoxing, built in 1256 and still standing today. Bridges with pavilions <b>crowning</b> their central spans were often featured in such paintings as the landscapes of Xia Gui (1195–1224). Long, covered corridor bridges, like the 12th-century Rainbow Bridge in Wuyuan, Jiangxi province, which has wide stone-based piers and a wooden superstructure, were also built.|$|E

5|$|Casting metalware in Chamba is {{an ancient}} tradition, {{dating back to the}} Bronze Age period, with items {{typically}} made out of copper or brass, and also iron, especially in the traditional making of implements and weapons by blacksmiths.

5|$|<b>Crowning</b> ceremonies {{arose from}} a worldview in which monarchs {{were seen as}} ordained by God to serve not merely as {{political}} or military leaders, nor as figureheads, but rather to occupy a vital spiritual place in their dominions as well. Coronations were created to reflect and enable these alleged connections; however, the belief systems {{that gave birth to}} them have been radically altered in recent centuries by secularism, egalitarianism and the rise of constitutionalism and democracy. During the Protestant Reformation, the idea of divinely ordained monarchs began to be challenged.|$|E
5|$|During royal coronations, however, {{separate}} banners {{for each}} of the two constituent nations of the Commonwealth were still used. Crown (i.e., Polish) and Lithuanian standard-bearers carried the furled banners in a procession to the royal cathedral where, shortly after the anointment and just before the <b>crowning</b> of the king-elect, they handed the banners to the primate who unfurled them and handed them to the kneeling king. The king would then stand up and give the unfurled banners back to the standard-bearers.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Objective. The aim of {{the study}} was to provide data on the {{fracture}} strength of monolithic high translucent Y-TZP <b>crowns</b> and porcelain-veneered high translucent Y-TZP <b>crown</b> cores and to compare that data with the fracture strength of porcelain-veneered Y-TZP <b>crown</b> cores and monolithic lithium disilicate glass-ceramic <b>crowns.</b> Materials and methods. Sixty standardized <b>crowns</b> divided into six groups (n = 10) were fabricated: monolithic high translucent Y-TZP <b>crowns,</b> brand A, monolithic high translucent Y-TZP <b>crowns,</b> brand B, veneered high translucent Y-TZP <b>crown</b> cores, brand A, veneered high translucent Y-TZP <b>crown</b> cores, brand B, heat-pressed monolithic lithium disilicate <b>crowns</b> and veneered Y-TZP <b>crown</b> cores. All <b>crowns</b> were thermocycled, cemented onto dies, cyclically pre-loaded and finally loaded to fracture. Results. The monolithic Y-TZP groups showed significantly higher fracture strength (2795 N and 3038 N) compared to all other groups. The fracture strength in the veneered Y-TZP group (2229 N) was significantly higher than the monolithic lithium disilicate group (1856 N) and the veneered high translucent Y-TZP groups (1480 N and 1808 N). Conclusions. The fracture strength of monolithic high translucent Y-TZP <b>crowns</b> is considerably higher than that of porcelain-veneered Y-TZP <b>crown</b> cores, porcelain-veneered high translucent Y-TZP <b>crown</b> cores and monolithic lithium disilicate <b>crowns.</b> The fracture strength of a <b>crown</b> made of monolithic high translucent Y-TZP is, with a large safety margin, sufficient for clinical use for the majority of patients. Porcelain-veneered Y-TZP <b>crown</b> cores show higher fracture resistance than monolithic lithium disilicate <b>crowns...</b>|$|R

5|$|In 597, a Benedictine monk {{had been}} sent by Pope GregoryI to start {{converting}} Pagan England to Christianity. The monk, Augustine, became the first Archbishop of Canterbury. Within two centuries, the ritual of anointing monarchs with holy oil and <b>crowning</b> them (initially with helmets) in a Christian ceremony had been established, and regalia took on a religious identity. There was still no permanent set of coronation regalia; each monarch generally had a new set made, with {{which he or she}} was usually buried upon death.|$|E

40|$|Little {{is known}} about the <b>crown</b> system and its {{association}} with plant growth and development in spring cereals. This study investigated temperature, seeding depth and genotypic effects on <b>crown</b> development of barley; relationships between <b>crown</b> and seminal root systems; and classification and description of <b>crown</b> systems under deep seeding. Two greenhouse experiments were performed using PVC tubes. Low temperature and deep seeding reduced percentage and rate of emergence but increased <b>crown</b> number, <b>crown</b> depth, and <b>crown</b> weight in most genotypes. <b>Crown</b> number, <b>crown</b> depth and <b>crown</b> weight showed increased associations with seminal root, whole root, and shoot weight at low temperature and deep seeding in most genotypes. Deep plantings showed that <b>crown</b> systems of barley can be classified as unicrown, bicrown and multicrown types with some variants.
