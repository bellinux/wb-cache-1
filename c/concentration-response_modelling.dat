30|$|The major {{criticism}} {{regarding the}} ECxx concept {{is the need}} of specifying a mathematical <b>model</b> for the <b>concentration-response</b> relation. Such a model is not needed for the NOEC. However, a library of standard <b>concentration-response</b> <b>models</b> exists, from which an appropriate problem-specific model can be selected. For {{the example of the}} FET, a binary four-parameter logistic model (see Fig.  1 a and Appendix) has been found suitable [27 – 29]. The ECxx concept does not rely on using the logistic model; it can be adapted to every other strictly monotone <b>concentration-response</b> <b>model.</b> Also, non-parametric approaches can be used [26].|$|R
40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} a computational model for chem-ical sensor arrays {{inspired by the}} first two stages in the olfactory pathway: distributed coding with olfactory receptor neurons and chemotopic convergence onto glomerular units. We propose a monotonic <b>concentration-response</b> <b>model</b> that maps conventional sensor-array inputs into a distributed activation pattern across a large population of neuroreceptors. Projection onto glomerular units in the olfactory bulb is then simulated with a self-orga-nizing model of chemotopic convergence. The pattern recognition performance of the model is characterized using a database of odor patterns from an array of temperature modulated chemical sensors. The chemotopic code achieved by the proposed model is shown to improve the signal-to-noise ratio available at the sensor inputs while being consistent with results from neurobiology.

40|$|The use of no-observed effect {{concentrations}} (NOECs) as {{summary statistics}} for low toxic effects has been severely criticized in the ecotoxicological literature. <b>Concentration-response</b> <b>models</b> represent an appealing alternative. They consider the whole information onthe toxic {{action of the}} pollutant that can be gained from a chronic ecotoxicity study. Point measures of the toxic action, such as the p%-effective concentration (ECp) and the p%-lethal concentration (LCp) can easily {{be obtained from the}} fitted response curve. This paper illustrates the attractiveness of the nonlinear regression approach by means of a study on the impact of the pesticide dinoseb on the survival of the micro-crustacean 'Daphnia magna'. We point out some little known pitfalls, such as the infringement of the regularity conditions that guarantee the validity of the asymptotic approximations to the distribution of the maximum likelihood estimator and classical test statistics. This occurs for instance if threshold models are used, where the threshold parameters are estimated from the data. A way to overcome this difficulty is to resort to non-parametric resampling techniques to simulate the distribution of the statistic of interest. Attention has to be paid to the definition of an appropriate sampling plan...|$|R
40|$|The Species Sensitivity Distribution (SSD) {{is a key}} tool {{to assess}} the {{ecotoxicological}} threat of contaminant to biodiversity. It predicts safe concentrations for a contaminant in a community. Widely used, this approach suffers from several drawbacks: i) summarizing the sensitivity of each species by a single value entails a loss of valuable information about the other parameters characterizing the concentration-effect curves; ii) it does not propagate the uncertainty on the critical effect concentration into the SSD; iii) the hazardous concentration estimated with SSD only indicates the threat to biodiversity, without any insight about a global response of the community related to the measured endpoint. We revisited the current SSD approach to account for all the sources of variability and uncertainty into the prediction and to assess a global response for the community. For this purpose, we built a global hierarchical <b>model</b> including the <b>concentration-response</b> <b>model</b> together with the distribution law for the SSD. Working within a Bayesian framework, {{we were able to}} compute an SSD taking into account all the uncertainty from the original raw data. From model simulations, it is also possible to extract a quantitative indicator of a global response of the community to the contaminant. We applied this methodology to study the toxicity of 6 herbicides to benthic diatoms from Lake Geneva, measured from biomass reduction...|$|R
40|$|This article {{presents}} a computational architecture for sensor-based machine olfaction based on biologically plausible {{models of the}} early stages in the olfactory pathway. We derive a <b>concentration-response</b> <b>model</b> that maps conventional sensor-array patterns into activation patterns for a population of olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs). A chemotopic convergence model is employed to generate spatial activation patterns at the glomerular layer {{that are consistent with}} neurobiology. These glomerular images serve as inputs to an implementation of Freeman’s KIII neurodynamics model. 1 Experimental An array of four temperature-modulated metal-oxide chemoresistors (TGS 2610, 2611, 2620 and 2600) was employed to collect a database of sensor-array patterns on serial dilutions of three organic solvents. The sensors were placed in a 30 -ml vial containing 6 -ml of the analytes, and excited with two 150 -sec periods of a 1 - 7 V sinusoidal heater voltage. The second cycle was sampled down to 5 measurements to generate a 20 -dimensional feature vector. For visualization purposes, the feature vector was projected down to a two-dimensional space by means of Principal Components Analysis (PCA). Figure 1 (left) illustrates the resulting patterns for three organic solvents (acetone (A), isopropyl alcohol (I) and ammonia (M)) at four water dilution levels (1 : strongest; 4 : weakest). To make the pattern-classification problem non-trivial, these dilution levels were chosen close to the isothermal detection threshold of the sensor array...|$|R
40|$|The fish early life-stage (FELS) test {{guideline}} (OECD 210 or OCSPP 850. 1400) {{is the most}} frequently used bioassay for predicting chronic fish toxicity and supporting aquatic ecological risk assessments around the world. For each chemical, the FELS test requires a minimum of 360 fish and 1 to 3 months from test initiation to termination. Although valuable for predicting fish full life-cycle toxicity, FELS tests are labor and resource intensive and, due to an emphasis on apical endpoints, provide little to no information about chemical mode of action. Therefore, {{the development and implementation of}} alternative testing strategies for screening and prioritizing chemicals has the potential to reduce the cost and number of animals required for estimating FELS toxicity and, at the same time, provides insights into mechanisms of toxicity. Using three reference chemicals with well-established yet distinct adverse outcome pathways (AOPs) in early life stages of fish, we proposed FELS-specific AOPs as conceptual frameworks for identifying useful chemical screening and prioritization strategies. The reference chemicals selected as case studies were a cardiotoxic aryl hydrocarbon receptor agonist (2, 3, 7, 8 -tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin), neurotoxic acetylcholinesterase inhibitor (chlorpyrifos), and narcotic surfactant (linear alkylbenzene sulfonate). Using qualitative descriptions for each chemical during early fish development, we developed generalized AOPs and, based on these examples, proposed a three-tiered testing strategy for screening and prioritizing chemicals for FELS testing. Linked with biologically based <b>concentration-response</b> <b>models,</b> a tiered testing strategy may help reduce the reliance on long-term and costly FELS tests required for assessing the hazard of thousands of chemicals currently in commerc...|$|R

In this chapter, PK-PD models, describing the therapeutic effects of drugs used for the therapy of allergic diseases have been reviewed.

40|$|BenMAP is {{the result}} of years of {{research}} and development, and reflects methods based on the peer-reviewed health and benefits analysis literature. BenMAP is first and foremost a tool for estimating health and welfare benefits associated with air pollution regulations proposed or finalized by the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency. Secondary objectives in developing BenMAP were to provide a well documented, flexible, and relatively easy to use program that could be shared with the public to enhance the transparency of our complex benefits analyses. The basis of BenMAP is a damage function approach to estimating changes in the incidence of health effects and valuing those changes. This approach is consistent with many recently published health impact and benefit assessments (see for example Banzhaf et al., 2002; Levy et al., 2001; Kunzli et al., 2000; Levy et al., 1999; and Ostro and Chestnut, 1998). The specific theoretical approach and underlying inputs to the <b>models</b> (<b>concentration-response</b> functions, spatial interpolation methods, etc.) have for the most part been reviewed and accepted individually by both the EPA Science Advisory Board and by the National Academy of Sciences Committee on Estimating the Health-Risk-Reduction Benefits of Proposed Air Pollution Regulations.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an overview of}} the ozone human exposure and health risk analyses developed under sponsorship of the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). These analyses are being used in the current review of the national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS) for ozone. The analyses consist of three principal steps: (1) estimating short-term ozone exposure for particular populations (exposure model); (2) estimating population response to exposures or concentrations (exposure-response or concentration-response models); and (3) integrating concentrations or exposure with <b>concentration-response</b> or exposure-response <b>models</b> to produce overall risk estimates (risk model). The exposure model, called the probabilistic NAAQS exposure model for ozone (pNEM/ 03), incorporates the following factors: hourly ambient ozone concentrations; spatial distribution of concentrations; ventilation state of individuals at time of exposure; and movement of people through various microenvironments (e. g., outdoors, indoors, inside a vehicle) of varying air quality. Exposure estimates are represented by probability distributions. Exposure-response relationships have been developed for several respiratory symptom and lung function health effects, {{based on the results of}} controlled human exposure studies. These relationships also are probabilistic and reflect uncertainties associated with sample size and variability of response among subjects. The analyses also provide estimates of excess hospital admissions in the New York City area based on results from an epidemiology study. Overall risk results for selected health endpoints and recently analyzed air quality scenarios associated with alternative 8 -hour NAAQS and the current 1 -hour standard for outdoor children are used to illustrate application of the methodology...|$|R
40|$|Models {{describing}} dose–response {{relationships are}} becoming increasingly popular in ecotoxicology. They allow simple and thorough evaluations of toxicity test results, including inter- and extrapolations to concentrations or exposure times other than those tested. Simple parametric regression models are of particular interest because their parameters may be attributed mechanistic meanings {{and they can be}} applied without sophisticated mathematical and computational support. We recently proposed a four-parameter logistic regression model to fit the survival data of `Daphnia magna' under dinoseb stress. The model parameters are the maximum survival time, the minimum time required for an individual to die, effect concentration, EC 50, and a curve shape parameter. This model has now been applied to compare the lethality and reproduction toxicity of `D. magna' and the growth inhibition of `Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata' under dinoseb stress. It can be fitted adequately to all the measured data and the parameters can be attributed biological meanings in any of the three endpoints. A comparison of the <b>modeled</b> <b>concentration-response</b> functions of all three endpoints for dinoseb toxicity shows that the range of ECs with respect to both `D. magna' and algae is steep (a decrease of between 0. 1 and 0. 6 mg/L). The survival and reproduction of `D. magna' exhibit similar characteristic concentration–response functions and toxicities. The statistical no-effect concentration (SNEC) is 0. 14 (survival) and 0. 11 (reproduction) mg/L, respectively. On the other hand, algae seem to be less sensitive to dinoseb than `D. magna', (SNEC: 0. 48 mg/L). However, further investigations of individual algae may lead to a more suitable comparison. We speculate that the four parameters of the model function can be related to specific properties of chemicals and organisms. Characterization of these properties would allow simple and appropriate estimation of the toxic effects of these chemicals...|$|R
40|$|Azaspiracids (AZAs) are a {{group of}} {{lipophilic}} polyether toxins that were discovered in shellfish from Ireland in 1995, following a food poisoning incident. Both the limited availability of pure AZAs and the co-occurrence in shellfish of other toxins in combination with AZAs have so far prevented an in-depth evaluation {{of the performance of}} the EU reference test, the mouse bioassay (MBA), for this toxin group at the regulatory limit. The present study evaluated the performance of the mouse bioassay at the example of a mussel tissue homogenate, naturally contaminated with AZAs, diluted with uncontaminated tissues to appropriate concentration levels. Concentrations were determined using liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS-MS) (7 levels ranging from levels less than the limit of quantification to a maximum of ca. 2. 24 mg/kg in hepatopancreas, which corresponds to a maximum whole flesh AZA 1 -equivalent of ca. 0. 34 mg/kg). Replicate homogenates of each concentration level were analysed by MBA on 7 independent occasions over 6 weeks. Inhomogeneity between replicate aliquot portions was evaluated using LC-MS-MS and ranged from 1. 8 to 6. 6 % RSD for the six levels contaminated above quantification limits. This variation was similar to the variability of the LC-MS-MS method within a batch, and the difference between replicate aliquots could thus be considered negligible. Other uncertainties considered in the study included the short- and long-term variability of the LC-MS-MS method, toxic equivalence factors, relative response factors in mass spectrometric detection, additional analogues and matrix effects. A <b>concentration-response</b> curve was <b>modelled</b> as a 4 -parametric logistic fit to a sigmoidal function, with an LC 50 of 0. 70 mg AZA 1 -equivalent/kg hepatopancreas tissue. Furthermore, the mathematical model of the lethality data from this study suggests that occasional negative mouse assays at high concentrations, previously observed in the Irish statutory monitoring, are at least partly due to the biological variation of mice and can be understood on a statistical basis. The mathematical <b>model</b> of the <b>concentration-response</b> curve also describes the probability of a positive mouse bioassay at the current regulatory limit of 0. 16 mg/kg to be ca. 95 %. Therefore, it appears that the mouse bioassay performs very well in the implementation of this limit. Hence, the present study very strongly suggests that the MBA and LC-MS-MS techniques can be considered equivalent in the implementation of the current regulatory limit of 0. 16 mg/kg for Azaspiracids in shellfish.
