[...] In Lake Malawi, the predatory cichlid Nimbochromis livingstonii have been seen first {{remaining}} stationary with their abdomen on or near sand and that then dropping onto their sides. In a variant behaviour, some N. livingstonii fell through the water column and landed onto their side. The fish then remained immobile for several minutes. Their colour pattern was blotchy and suggested a rotting carcass. Small inquisitive cichlids of other species often came near and they were suddenly attacked by the predator. About a third of the death-feigning performances led to an attack, and about one-sixth of the attacks were successful. Another African cichlid, Lamprologus lemairii, from Lake Tanganyika, has been reported to do the same thing. A South American cichlid, the yellowjacket cichlid Parachromis friedrichsthalii, also uses death feigning. They turn over onto their sides {{at the bottom of the}} sinkholes they inhabit and remain immobile for as long as 15 minutes, during which they attack the small mollies that come too close to them. [...] The <b>comb</b> <b>grouper</b> Mycteroperca acutirostris may also be an actor, though in this case the behaviour should be called dying or illness feigning, rather than death feigning, because while lying on its side the fish occasionally undulates its body. In 1999, off the coast of southeastern Brazil, one juvenile <b>comb</b> <b>grouper</b> was observed using this tactic to catch five small prey in 15 minutes.|$|E

50|$|The fish often schools. In some areas, the {{juvenile}} is often found with the jellyfish Chrysaora lactea, {{with which it}} can find protection from predators. Several juveniles at once may shelter {{under the umbrella of}} the jellyfish, where they may be protected by the tentacles, or hide behind the umbrella, using it as a shield. When away from the jellyfish, it is sometimes eaten by the <b>comb</b> <b>grouper</b> (Mycteroperca acutirostris). The grouper is known to follow the jellyfish, waiting for the scads to come out. The fish is prey for many other animals, as well. It made up the majority of the diet of the yellowtail amberjack (Seriola lalandi) in one survey.|$|E
40|$|Diplectrum formosum (the sand perch), Diplectrum radiale (the aquavina), Epinephelus marginatus (the dusky grouper) and Mycteroperca acutirostris (the <b>comb</b> <b>grouper)</b> {{are four}} {{sympatric}} serranid of remarkable ecological and commercial importance. This {{study investigated the}} feeding of these four species in the São Sebastião Channel, São Paulo State (southeastern Brazil), comparing their diet, habitat utilization and morphological features related to foraging. These four serranids are opportunistic visual predators that use a total of nine different tactics to capture their preys, feed mostly on crustaceans {{during the day and}} twilight, and keep stationary and quiescent at night. The ecomorphological study was conducted to test its predictive value to infer lifestyles. It was verified that such analysis should be used carefully and must be complemented by field observations. Although morphologically and behaviorally very similar, D. formosum and D. radiale showed different preferences to the substratum type used by large individuals, which are exclusively sit-and-wait predators. On the other hand, E. marginatus displayed more sedentary habits than M. acutirostris, the most versatile predator from the studied species. The studied species of Diplectrum and E. marginatus can be regarded as benthic serranids, while M. acutirostris could be viewed as a nektobenthic species...|$|E
40|$|Although fishers' {{knowledge}} has been recently considered into management programmes, {{there is still}} the need to establish a better understanding of fishers' perceptions and cognition. Fishers can provide novel information on the biology and ecology of species, which can potentially be used in the management of fisheries. The knowledge fishers have and how they classify nature is empirically based. It is common, for example, to observe that fishers' taxonomy is often represented by the generic level, one of the hierarchical categories of folk classification that is somewhat analogous to the Linnean genus, as it groups organisms of a higher rank than the folk species. In this study we compiled the knowledge fishers have on local fish, such as their folk names, diet and habitat. Methods: Five coastal communities widely distributed along the Brazilian coast were studied: two from the northeast (Porto Sauipe and Itacimirim, in Bahia State, n of interviewees = 34), two from the southeast (Itaipu at Niteroi and Copacabana at Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro State, n = 35) and one from the south coast (Pantano do Sul, in Santa Catarina State, n = 23). Fish pictures were randomly ordered and the same order was presented to all interviewees (n = 92), when they were then asked about the species name and classification and its habitat and diet preferences. Results: Fishers make clusters of fish species, usually hierarchically; fishers of the coast of Brazil use mostly primary lexemes (generic names) to name fish; and fishers did not differentiate between scientific species, since the same folk generic name included two different scientific species. Fishers provide information on species to which there is scarce or no information on diet and habitat, such as Rhinobatos percellens (chola guitarfish, arraia viola or cacao viola), Sphoeroides dorsalis (marbled puffer, baiacu), Mycteroperca acutirostris (<b>comb</b> <b>grouper,</b> badejo) and Dasyatis guttata (longnose stingray, arraia, arraia manteiga). Conclusions: fishers' knowledge on fish diet and fish habitat can be strategic to management, since their knowledge concentrates on the fishery target species, which are the ones under higher fishing pressure.
