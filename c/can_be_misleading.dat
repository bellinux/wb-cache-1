25|$|One {{should also}} keep {{the purpose of}} the {{analysis}} in mind when choosing the prior distribution. In principle, uninformative and flat priors, that exaggerate our subjective ignorance about the parameters, may still yield reasonable parameter estimates. However, Bayes factors are highly sensitive to the prior distribution of parameters. Conclusions on model choice based on Bayes factor <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>misleading</b> unless the sensitivity of conclusions to the choice of priors is carefully considered.|$|E
25|$|The {{median income}} for a {{household}} {{in the city}} was $30,463, and the median income for a family was $48,289. Males had a median income of $31,396 versus $24,611 for females. The per capita income for the city was $16,566. About 8.7% of families and 24.2% of the population were below the poverty line, including 10.1% of those under age 18 and 7.8% of those age 65 or over. However, traditional measures of income and poverty <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>misleading</b> when applied to cities with high student populations, such as Manhattan.|$|E

25|$|However, {{anatomical}} comparisons <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>misleading,</b> as not all anatomical similarities {{indicate a}} close relationship. Organisms that share similar environments will often develop similar physical features, {{a process known}} as convergent evolution. Both sharks and dolphins have similar body forms, yet are only distantly relatedâ€”sharks are fish and dolphins are mammals. Such similarities are a result of both populations being exposed to the same selective pressures. Within both groups, changes that aid swimming have been favored. Thus, over time, they developed similar appearances (morphology), even though they are not closely related.|$|E
25|$|Culture or PCR are {{the current}} means for {{detecting}} {{the presence of}} the organism, as serologic studies only test for antibodies of Borrelia. OspA antigens, shedded by live Borrelia bacteria into urine, are a promising technique being studied. The use of nanotrap particles for their detection is being looked at and the OspA has been linked to active symptoms of Lyme. High titers of either immunoglobulin G (IgG) or immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibodies to Borrelia antigens indicate disease, but lower titers <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>misleading,</b> because the IgM antibodies may remain after the initial infection, and IgG antibodies may remain for years.|$|E
25|$|Primary {{progressive}} aphasia (PPA), {{while its}} name <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>misleading,</b> {{is actually a}} form of dementia that has some symptoms closely related to several forms of aphasia. It {{is characterized by a}} gradual loss in language functioning while other cognitive domains are mostly preserved, such as memory and personality. PPA usually initiates with sudden word-finding difficulties in an individual and progresses to a reduced ability to formulate grammatically correct sentences (syntax) and impaired comprehension. The etiology of PPA is not due to a stroke, traumatic brain injury (TBI), or infectious disease; it is still uncertain what initiates the onset of PPA in those affected by it.|$|E
50|$|Spam 2.0 is {{parasitic}} in nature. They {{may exist}} on legitimate and often official websites. If such information persists, the trust in such pages is diminished, spam is effectively promoted by trusted sources, many users <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>mislead</b> or lead to scams and computer malware and such legitimate sites may be blacklisted which then deprives all others of legitimate content. As {{a result of}} the success and impact rates of spam 2.0, it is far more popular amongst spammers and has far greater negative socio-economic impact.|$|R

25|$|Within {{contemporary}} {{forms of}} music (sometimes {{referred to as}} Contemporary Commercial Music), singers are classified by the style of music they sing, such as jazz, pop, blues, soul, country, folk, and rock styles. There is currently no authoritative voice classification system within non-classical music. Attempts {{have been made to}} adopt classical voice type terms to other forms of singing but such attempts have been met with controversy. The development of voice categorizations were made with the understanding that the singer would be using classical vocal technique within a specified range using unamplified (no microphones) vocal production. Since contemporary musicians use different vocal techniques, microphones, and are not forced to fit into a specific vocal role, applying such terms as soprano, tenor, baritone, etc. <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>misleading</b> or even inaccurate.|$|E
25|$|A notable {{disadvantage}} {{of the method}} is that the lensing cannot be repeated, because the chance alignment never occurs again. Also, the detected planets will tend to be several kiloparsecs away, so follow-up observations with other methods are usually impossible. In addition, the only physical characteristic that can be determined by microlensing is {{the mass of the}} planet, within loose constraints. Orbital properties also tend to be unclear, as the only orbital characteristic that can be directly determined is its current semi-major axis from the parent star, which <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>misleading</b> if the planet follows an eccentric orbit. When the planet is far away from its star, it spends only a tiny portion of its orbit in a state where it is detectable with this method, so the orbital period of the planet cannot be easily determined. It is also easier to detect planets around low-mass stars, as the gravitational microlensing effect increases with the planet-to-star mass ratio.|$|E
25|$|Calvinists {{broke from}} the Roman Catholic Church in the 16th century. Calvinism differs from Lutherans {{on the real}} {{presence}} of Christ in the Eucharist, theories of worship, {{and the use of}} God's law for believers, among other things. As declared in the Westminster and Second Helvetic confessions, the core doctrines are predestination and election. A basic principle is that they deny the Catholic teaching that humans can achieve salvation through their actions. The protestant part of this reformation was considering that the Bible be interpreted by itself, meaning the parts that are harder to understand are examined in the light of other passages where the Bible is more explicit on the matter. The term Calvinism <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>misleading,</b> because the religious tradition which it denotes has always been diverse, {{with a wide range of}} influences rather than a single founder. The movement was first called Calvinism by Lutherans who opposed it referring to French reformer John Calvin, and many within the tradition would prefer to use the word Reformed.|$|E

5000|$|... "Hilbert scheme" [...] {{sometimes}} {{refers to}} the punctual Hilbert scheme of 0-dimensional subschemes on a scheme. Informally this <b>can</b> <b>be</b> thought of as something like finite collections of points on a scheme, though this picture <b>can</b> <b>be</b> very <b>misleading</b> when several points coincide.|$|R
500|$|Feminist {{economics}} {{argue that}} {{gender and race}} {{must be considered in}} economic analysis. Amartya Sen argues that [...] "the systematically inferior position of women inside and outside the household in many societies points to the necessity of treating gender as a force of its own in development analysis." [...] He {{goes on to say that}} experiences of men and women, even within the same household, are often so different that examining economics without gender <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>misleading.</b>|$|E
500|$|Another {{psychological}} theory used by Blassingame is role theory. According to this theory, [...] "a person's {{behavior is}} generally {{determined by the}} socially defined roles or the behavioral patterns expected of him in certain situations." [...] Blassingame asserts that through applying interpersonal and role theory to the fugitive slave narratives, historians can determine [...] "the extent to which slaves acted the way their masters expected them to behave" [...] and how the Sambo, Jack, and Nat personality types <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>misleading.</b>|$|E
500|$|The word [...] "constant" [...] <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>misleading.</b> It {{means that}} they are {{material}} constants; but they may vary with frequency. In particular, R is heavily influenced by the skin effect. [...] Furthermore, while G has virtually no effect at audio frequency, it can cause noticeable losses at high frequency {{with many of the}} dielectric materials used in cables due to a high loss tangent. [...] Avoiding the losses caused by G is the reason many cables designed for use at UHF are air-insulated or foam-insulated (which makes them virtually air-insulated). [...] The actual meaning of constant in this context is that the parameter is constant with distance. [...] That is the line is assumed to be homogenous lengthwise. [...] This condition is true {{for the vast majority of}} transmission lines in use today.|$|E
50|$|Expressing N {{in terms}} of {{relativistic}} mass-energy and momentum, rather than rest mass and velocity, avoids extra Lorentz factors. However, relativistic mass is discouraged by some authors since it <b>can</b> <b>be</b> a <b>misleading</b> quantity to apply in certain equations.|$|R
5000|$|In this sense, {{the idea}} of [...] "part-writing rules" [...] <b>can</b> <b>be</b> {{somewhat}} <b>misleading.</b> Wise pedagogues understand that such rules aren't there to be [...] "broken," [...] but to help students hone their perception and develop judgment about the larger principles.|$|R
40|$|This article {{presents}} a case report of osteoarticular tuberculosis affecting lumbar sacral column non-typical attack. The diagnosis remains a medical challenge because the symptoms and bone lesions are not specific and <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>mislead</b> with other morbidity such as inflammatory, circulatory, metabolic, traumatic, congenital and tumoral diseases. The disease is degenerative and the prognosis not satisfactory. Besides the clinical aspects and laboratory, imaging results, including computed tomography and magnetic ressonance, are discussed. A PCR system targeting the IS 6110 of M. tuberculosis was positive, strongly suggesting {{the presence of}} this pathogen. This assay would be particularly indicated when quick and sensitive diagnosis of tuberculosis is required...|$|R
500|$|The carronade {{was adopted}} by the Royal Navy in 1779; the lower muzzle {{velocity}} of the round shot when fired from this cannon was intended to create more wooden [...] when hitting the structure of an enemy vessel, as they were believed to be deadly. The carronade was much shorter, and weighed between a third to a quarter less than an equivalent long gun; for example, a 32pounder carronade weighed less than a ton, compared with a 32pounder long gun, which weighed over 3tons. The guns were, therefore, easier to handle, and also required less than half as much gunpowder, allowing fewer men to crew them. Carronades were manufactured in the usual naval gun calibers, but were not counted in a ship of the line's rated number of guns. As a result, the classification of Royal Navy vessels in this period <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>misleading,</b> as they often carried more cannon than were listed.|$|E

500|$|Various {{lines of}} {{evidence}} undermine a proposed link between thiomersal and autism. For example, although advocates of a thiomersal-autism link consider autism {{a form of}} [...] "mercury poisoning," [...] the typical symptoms of mercury toxicity are significantly different from symptoms seen in autism. Likewise, the neuroanatomic and histopathologic features of the brains of patients who have mercury poisoning, both with methylmercury as well as ethylmercury, have significant differences from the brains of people with autism. Previous episodes of widespread mercury toxicity in a population such as in Minamata Bay, Japan would also be expected to lead to documentation of a significant rise in autism or autism-like behavior in children should autism be caused by mercury poisoning. However, research on several episodes of acute and chronic mercury poisoning have not documented any such rise in autism like behavior. Although some parents cite an association between the timing of onset of autistic symptoms with the timing of vaccinations as evidence of an environmental cause such as thiomersal, {{this line of reasoning}} <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>misleading.</b> Associations such as these do not establish causation as the two occurring together may be only coincidental in nature. Also, genetic disorders that have no environmental triggers such as Rett syndrome and Huntington's disease nevertheless have specific ages when they begin to show symptoms, suggesting specific ages of onset of symptoms does not necessarily require an environmental cause.|$|E
