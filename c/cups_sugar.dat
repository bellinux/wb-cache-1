40|$|The Nebraska Master Mix {{can be used}} to {{make many}} dishes easily. The {{homemade}} mix offers the advantage, over bought mixes, of choosing your own combination of ingredients. For example, you may want to try the whole wheat version with margarine for a deliciously different mix. Simple meals and leftovers can be sparked up by adding a homemade hotbread or other food made from the Nebraska Master Mix. The Nebraska Master Mix is lower in fat than some but gives very good results. Sugar has been reduced in some of the recipes, but other ingredients have been used to enhance flavor. Thus in banana bread only 1 / 4 <b>cup</b> <b>sugar</b> is used but more banana is called for than in traditional recipes. Families of one or two may prefer to halve the MIX and very large families double it. This Home Extension Guide includes recipes for the Nebraska Master Mix, breads, pancakes, tortillas, turnovers, pizza dough, coffee cake, brownies, and cookies...|$|R

50|$|For {{domestic}} purposes one {{can create}} the exact equivalent of brown sugar by mixing white sugar with molasses. Suitable proportions are about one tablespoon of molasses to each <b>cup</b> of <b>sugar</b> (one-sixteenth of the total volume). Molasses comprises 10% of brown sugar's total weight, which is about one ninth of the white sugar weight. Due to varying qualities and colors of molasses products, for lighter or darker sugar, reduce or increase its proportion according to taste.|$|R

These concentrates contain one part sucralose for each two parts water. A quarter teaspoon of concentrate substitutes for one <b>cup</b> of <b>sugar.</b> Pure, dry sucralose undergoes some decomposition at elevated temperatures. In solution or blended with maltodextrin, it is slightly more stable. Most products containing sucralose add fillers and additional sweetener to bring the product to the approximate volume and texture of an equivalent amount of sugar.|$|R

50|$|The strip doesn't promote Satanism, {{but rather}} sets {{it up for}} satire, along with Christianity (so as not to favour either side). A typical strip might begin with a {{dramatic}} ritual, summoning forth Satan, only {{for him to be}} asked to change a light bulb or lend the family a <b>cup</b> of <b>sugar.</b> In another story Mavis is made Queen of Hell while Satan takes a Mediterranean holiday, but when he returns he finds she's converted his domain into a Nail Bar. The humour is light-hearted and mostly inoffensive, although slight criticism has actually been received by both Christians and Satanists.|$|R
5000|$|... "Unlidded" [...] mugs and lidded tankards may be {{the most}} {{familiar}} pewter artifacts from the late 17th and 18th centuries, although the metal was also used for many other items including porringers, plates, dishes, basins, spoons, measures, flagons, communion <b>cups,</b> teapots, <b>sugar</b> bowls, beer steins, and cream jugs. In the early 19th century, changes in fashion caused a decline in the use of pewter flatware. At the same time, production increased of both cast and spun pewter tea sets, whale-oil lamps, candlesticks, and so on. Later in the century, pewter alloys were often used as a base metal for silver-plated objects.|$|R

5000|$|Eggs {{are placed}} on diet cubes or host plants. The eggs hatch and develop at {{different}} speeds depending on temperature. The larvae are moved to fresh diet or leaves as their food spoils or is consumed. When they start to [...] "wander", {{they are about to}} pupate, so are placed in a pupation chamber. Pupation chambers are holes drilled into a wood board. The Manduca larvae are sealed in the chamber using a stopper and allowed to pupate. After pupation, the pupae are placed in a breeding or colony chamber to eclose. Providing a <b>cup</b> of <b>sugar</b> water and a tobacco (or related) plant will allow mated females to oviposit fertile eggs, which can then be reared.|$|R

Controversy arises when Sam's pretty daughter Anne (Patricia Cutts) becomes romantically involved with RAF officer Victor Stevens (Peter Forbes-Robertson). There is disapproval from Victor's wealthy parents, Sir Andrew and Lady Diana Stevens (Garry Marsh and Grace Arnold), who object to the match on grounds of class. Lady Diana even offers money to the Twigg family to call off the relationship, which enrages father Sam. However, when RAF man Victor is reportedly shot down in action, parental attitudes soften.|$|R

50|$|A common {{cycle is}} based on the {{addition}} of one <b>cup</b> each of <b>sugar,</b> flour, and milk every five days, with bread baked and extra starter shared every tenth day. The ten-day cycle produces five cups of starter, which must be either used to bake bread, given away, or used to start a new cycle. A common suggestion is to bake one loaf of bread, give away three cups of starter, and to save the remaining one for the next cycle.|$|R

Alternatively, you can simply add 1 to 2 whole vanilla beans to an airtight jar containing 1 to 2 cups of white sugar; let the mixture age for approximately 2 weeks then use 2 tablespoons in place of one packet of vanilla sugar; continue to replace sugar as it is used and the beans will last indefinitely.|$|R
5000|$|American Sweetheart was {{produced}} in pale pink, translucent white (Monax), with dessert sets produced in ruby red, Ritz blue, and crystal. The pattern was an elaborate design of lacy swirls, finely detailed and quite feminine, created from a mold-etched pattern. The translucent white, when held up to the light, had a faint bluish hue to it. This unique colored glass is called [...] "Monax" [...] and is sometimes mistaken as milk glass, which is thicker and whiter. American Sweetheart's Monax dishware is thinner, more opaque {{and appears to be}} more delicate. Plates, saucers, bowls, sugar and creamer sets, salt and pepper sets, tumblers, pitchers were created with this pattern. The dessert sets included plates, <b>cups,</b> saucers, <b>sugar</b> and creamer sets, console bowls, and tid-bit sets. American Sweetheart was referred to as the R-pattern and produced from 1930 to 1936.|$|R
