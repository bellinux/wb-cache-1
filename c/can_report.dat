5|$|In the United Kingdom, {{access to}} illegal content (such as child pornography) was {{strictly}} self-regulated by individual internet service providers. This began when BT Group introduced Cleanfeed, a server-side filtering system which uses {{data obtained from}} the Internet Watch Foundation. The IWF is a Quango organisation that operates a website where users <b>can</b> <b>report</b> web pages containing illegal or dubious content {{to be added to}} their blacklists. This was implemented in order to prevent users from accessing this material, since it is illegal to possess an indecent image of a child under the age of 18 per the Protection of Children Act. British ISPs were later obligated by the government to implement filters for illegal content by the beginning of 2007.|$|E

40|$|According to the Children's Bureau of Taiwan (2007), {{the number}} of Taiwanese {{children}} abused and neglected sharply increased from 6, 059 to 10, 094 between 2000 and 2006. Reports of abused and neglected children also rose from 8, 494 to 13, 986 in that period. This followed enactment of the Children and Youth Welfare Law in 2003 imposing a range of health, education and social welfare professionals, including nurses, the statutory duty to report suspected {{child abuse and neglect}}. Previous studies in Taiwan have indicated that despite the legislation, a range of factors continue to act against nurses reporting child abuse and neglect (CAN) cases according to the law. Previous research had examined factors that influence <b>CAN</b> <b>reporting</b> by health, education, and welfare professionals including registered nurses in Taiwan. The study herein sought to extend knowledge of these factors by identifying and assessing nurses' self-efficacy as a prime factor influencing professional commitment to legal <b>reporting</b> of <b>CAN.</b> The aims of this research were to: (1) examine influencing factors of nurses' likelihood to <b>report</b> <b>CAN</b> in Taiwanese health care settings, and (2) develop and test a new instrument Child Abuse and Neglect Reporting Self Efficacy (CANRSE) to measure nurses' self-efficacy in <b>CAN</b> <b>reporting.</b> The research was conducted in two phases. Phase one investigated nurses' experience with <b>CAN</b> <b>reporting</b> and examined relationships between nurses' perceptions, attitudes, knowledge, and likelihood to <b>report</b> <b>CAN</b> cases. Two hundred and thirty-eight nurses from emergency departments, paediatric units and community centres in Taiwan completed a survey. The results showed that using a series of vignettes, a significant relationship existed between the likelihood to <b>report</b> <b>CAN</b> and perception, attitude, and knowledge. Notably, perception was the most significant variable in predicting nurses' likelihood to <b>report</b> <b>CAN</b> cases. Findings indicated nurses had poor perceptions of recognizing and <b>reporting</b> <b>CAN</b> and lacked faith in child protection services. Knowledge of Taiwanese <b>CAN</b> <b>reporting</b> laws was poor. In general, most nurses believed that they needed more training courses on the recognition and <b>reporting</b> of <b>CAN.</b> These findings, in particular the importance of perceptions of legal reporting behaviour, were worthy of further investigation. In Phase two, a measure of CANRSE was developed and tested. Data were collected from 496 nurses working in Taiwanese health care settings. Development of the CANRSE was guided by an extensive literature review, findings from Phase one of the study and by an expert panel. The CANRSE consisted of five sections: (1) demographic information, (2) efficacy-expectation for suspected cases, (3) efficacy-expectation for known cases, (4) outcome-expectation of <b>CAN</b> <b>reporting,</b> and (5) likelihood to <b>report</b> <b>CAN.</b> The influence of nurses' self-efficacy on their likelihood to <b>report</b> <b>CAN</b> cases was also analysed. Structure of the CANRSE was supported by structural equation modeling using AMOS 6. 0. Additionally, correlation and regression analyses were applied to investigate the validity and reliability of the CANRSE. CANRSE met accepted psychometric standards for reliability and validity in this study. Nurses' CAN self-efficacy yielded strong prediction over personal characteristics, experience as a nurse, experience as a parent, and age. Thus, the research provides an important contribution to the literature relating to mandatory reporting by professional groups in particular nurses. It was the first research to successfully develop a new instrument to evaluate nurses' selfefficacy in <b>CAN</b> <b>reporting.</b> The findings provide a basis for understanding the influence of Taiwanese nurses' decision making for <b>CAN</b> <b>reporting.</b> Further research <b>can</b> extend the scope of CAN training programs and their evaluation...|$|R

40|$|AbstractTaiwan {{nurses are}} {{mandated}} to report known or suspected {{child abuse and}} neglect (CAN), and self-efficacy is known to have an important influence on professional behaviors. The aim {{of this study was to}} develop and test the <b>CAN</b> <b>reporting</b> self-efficacy (CANRSE) scale as a measure of nurses’ self-efficacy to <b>report</b> <b>CAN.</b> A sample of 496 nurses from Southern Taiwanese hospitals used the CANRSE scale. The psychometric evaluation of the scale included content validity, exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses, convergent validity, as well as Cronbach’s α and test−retest reliability. Satisfactory internal consistency (Cronbach’s α =  0. 92) and test−retest reliability were demonstrated. Confirmatory factor analysis supported the proposed models as having acceptable model fit. Exploratory factor analysis and regression analyses showed that the CANRSE scale had good construct validity and criterion-related validity, respectively. Convergent validity was tested using the general self-efficacy scale and was found to be satisfactory (r =  0. 53). The results indicate the CANRSE is reliable and valid, and further testing of its predictive validity is recommended. It can be used to examine the influence of professional self-efficacy in recognizing and <b>reporting</b> <b>CAN</b> cases and to evaluate the impact of training programs aimed at improving <b>CAN</b> <b>reporting...</b>|$|R

Non-angakkuq could experience hallucinations, and almost every Alaskan Native <b>can</b> <b>report</b> memories of ghosts, animals in human form, or little people living in remote places. Experiences such as hearing voices from ice or stones were discussed as readily as everyday hunting adventures. Neither were ecstatic experiences the monopoly of angakkuit (reverie, daydreaming, even trance were not unknown by non-angakkuit), and laypeople (non-angakkuit) experiencing them were welcome to report their experiences and interpretations. The ability to have and command helping spirits was characteristic of angakkuit, but laypeople could also profit from spirit powers through the use of amulets. In one extreme instance a Netsilingmiut child had 80 amulets for protection. Some laypeople had a greater capacity than others for close relationships with special beings of the belief system; these people were often apprentice angakkuit who failed to complete their learning process.|$|E

25|$|Residents {{may also}} choose to purchase, or rent, land from another Resident (a Resident landlord) {{rather than from}} Linden Lab. On a private region, the {{built-in}} land selling controls allow the landlord to sell land {{in the region to}} another Resident while still retaining some control. Residents purchasing, or renting, land from any other party than Linden Lab are not required to hold a Premium membership nor to necessarily pay a tier fee, although typically the landlord will require some form of upfront or monthly fee to compensate them for their liability to pay the land use fee charged by Linden Lab. However Linden Lab acknowledges only the landlord as the owner of the land, and will not intervene in disputes between Residents. This means, for example, that a landlord can withdraw a Resident's land from availability, without refunding their money, and Linden Lab will not arbitrate in the dispute unless it is a clear-cut matter of 'land fraud'. Users <b>can</b> <b>report</b> such matters to Linden Lab if they occur and they will look into it.|$|E
25|$|Since {{the late}} 1990s, housing {{policy has been}} a devolved matter, and state support for the homeless, {{together}} with legal rights in housing, have therefore diverged to a certain degree.

Currently, the service does not operate on a statutory basis, and the involvement of local authorities is merely due to political pressure from the government and charities, with funding being provided by the government (and others) on an ad-hoc basis.
