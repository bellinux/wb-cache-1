25|$|The day itself <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>determined,</b> {{but it is}} {{said that}} in April, 1808, Naomi went missing. Mr. Adams {{gathered}} a search party and followed the horse tracks to now Randleman, North Carolina, where they found Naomi Wise's body in the river. Mrs. Ann Davis, a resident close to the water, confirmed that she had heard a woman screaming the night before. The coroner from Asheboro examined the drowned and battered body of Naomi and found her pregnant.|$|E
25|$|Unfortunately, {{interpretation}} of the microneurographic readings can be difficult because axonal membrane potential <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>determined</b> from this method. A supplemental method used to better understand these readings involves examining recordings of post-spike excitability and shifts in latency; these features are associated with changes in membrane potential of unmyelinated axons like C fibers. Moalem-Taylor et al. experimentally used chemical modulators with known effects on membrane potential to study the post-spike super-excitability of C fibers. The researchers found three resulting events. Chemical medulators can produce a combination of loss of super-excitability along with increased axonal excitability, indicating membrane depolarization. Secondly, membrane hyperpolarization can result from a blockade of axonal hyperpolarization-activated current. Lastly, a non-specific increase in surface charge and {{a change in the}} voltage-dependent activation of sodium channels results from the application of calcium.|$|E
25|$|The {{size of the}} tagma of the Excubitors and its subdivisions <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>determined</b> with certainty; as {{with the}} other tagmata, {{scholars}} are of differing opinions regarding its numerical strength. Drawing on the lists of officers and accounts of Arab geographers Ibn Khurdādhbah and Qudāmah, historian Warren Treadgold suggested an establishment strength of c. 4,000 men, which for the Scholae and the Excubitors rose to c. 6,000 with {{the division of the}} regiments in the mid-10th century. Other scholars, most prominently John Haldon, have revised estimates to some 1,000 men for each tagma. For security reasons, both the Scholae and the Excubitors were scattered in garrisons in Thrace and Bithynia rather than being stationed within Constantinople, making it harder for them to be used in mounting a coup.|$|E

25|$|In Yalḳ. i, § 736 {{is found}} a {{citation}} {{relating to the}} same verse, which cannot be traced to any other midrash, and is doubtless taken from Midrash Esfah. To this midrash may possibly be referred a passage in the Halakot Gedolot (ed. Warsaw, p.282b) and a fragment on Num. xvii. 14, xx. 1-3, in Wertheimer, Batte Midrashot, iii. 8-10, which agrees in its concluding words with the excerpt in Yalḳ., Num. 763 on Num. xx. 3 (found also ib. 262, on Ex. xvii. 2, which begins with the same words). The name of the midrash shows {{that it must have}} begun with Num. xi. 16. The other excerpts in the Yalḳuṭ from the Midrash Esfah, §§ 737, 739, 742, 764, 773, and 845, are based on Num. xi. 24, xii. 3-7, xii. 12, xxi. 9, xxvi. 2 (found also ib. 684, on Num. i. 2, which begins with the same words), and Deut. vi. 16; the extent of the midrash, however, <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>determined.</b>|$|E
500|$|The first {{occasion}} {{after the}} mourning period that re-allowed concerted church music was {{the feast of}} Visitation, Thursday [...] It is possible that Bach produced his {{new version of the}} Magnificat for this occasion, although Christmas of the same year as first performance date for the new version is possible too: it <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>determined</b> with certainty on which day around 1732–1735 the Dmajor version of the Magnificat was first performed, and until when Bach amended the score to its final state. Around 1733 Bach filed two cantatas by Gottfried Heinrich Stölzel, for the fifth and the sixth Sunday after Trinity (5 and 12 July in 1733): Bach may have relied on church music by other composers for the services in Leipzig in July 1733, while composing and copying out the performance parts of the extensive first part of the Mass in Bminor.|$|E

Around this time, very solid defences were built which did not include the bath-house or mansio sites.

Other mansio sites around Britain appear to have been abandoned at this time. This did not imply an end to the posting service at Letocetum, it may have been a less costly reorganisation.

2500|$|Anyway, by {{choosing}} the title Shahanshah (king of kings), Ardashir revealed his inclination toward government. During about 226-227, Ardashir experienced a {{failed attempt to}} conquer Hatra, which was previously unsuccessfully tried by Trajan and Septimius Severus, while on a crusade for taking the northwest regions of the land. It {{should be noted that}} in the late Parthian era, Hatra had become semi-dependent due to the gradual deterioration of the central government. After that unsuccessful attempt of Ardashir's in the west, he started taking eastern lands and dominating large Parthian landlords, local noblemen and large Iranian houses and was successful. The exact extent and limits of Ardashir's ruled domain <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>determined</b> correctly. Ardashir's domain in the west was probably extended to the traditional borders between the Romans and Parthians in the northwest; in the east, the Kushan and Turan and probably Merv Desert rulers surrendered to Ardashir's empire; and in the southwest, the northern part of [...] "Arabic shores of the Persian Gulf"were taken by war.|$|E
2500|$|Displacements, torsions, strangulations, and impactions may be {{identified}} on rectal examination. Other non-specific findings, such as [...] small intestinal loops, {{may also be}} detected, and can play a major part in determining if surgery is necessary. Thickness of the intestinal walls may indicate infiltrative disease or abnormal muscular enlargement. Roughening of the serosal surface of the intestine can occur secondary to peritonitis. Horses that have had gastrointestinal rupture may have gritty feeling and free gas in the abdominal cavity. Surgery is usually suggested if rectal examination finds severe distention of {{any part of the}} GI tract, a tight cecum or multiple tight loops of small intestine, or inguinal hernia.

2500|$|Various {{interpretations of}} the meaning of the picture have been offered: the {{conflict}} between youth and old age, time as the devourer of all things, the wrath of God and an allegory of the situation in Spain, where the fatherland consumed its own children in wars and revolution.
