5|$|Dirge of Cerberus is {{an action}} {{role-playing}} third-person shooter. Battles occur in real-time, with the HUD displaying {{information such as}} Vincent's hit points and magic points, the currently selected item and quantity thereof, and a <b>cross-hair</b> to aid in targeting enemies. The action is viewed from an over-the-shoulder perspective similar to Resident Evil 4, although players can switch to a first-person perspective if they wish. Defeating enemies yields EXP, {{and at the end}} of each stage, the player can either use that EXP to level up, increasing Vincent's stats, or convert it to Gil (the in-game currency), which can then be used to purchase items and equipment upgrades.|$|E
500|$|... 3D {{also has}} certain {{optional}} in-game differences that affect play, {{such as the}} concise over the shoulder third-person view {{and the addition of}} crouch-walking. Firing in this third-person view substitutes an open <b>cross-hair</b> for the standard down-the-barrel sighting of the standard FPS view. This method of aiming can seem less precise, but does allow for a greater margin of error in accuracy. 3D makes use of the 3DS console's gyroscope, which is used to maintain balance when walking across a bridge or standing on tree branches. The camouflage system has also been updated, allowing the player {{to make use of the}} 3DS' camera to make a custom camouflage pattern. The port features numerous graphical improvements over the initial PlayStation 2 version including better character models and the addition of normal mapping. Despite this, the framerate has been criticized for falling far below the other versions of Snake Eater. Snake Eater 3D has met with positive reviews, averaging 77.74% at GameRankings based on 34 reviews, and 78/100 at Metacritic based on 46 reviews.|$|E
2500|$|The {{highway system}} has a <b>cross-hair</b> and loop freeway {{structure}} {{similar to that}} of Texas cities like Houston and Dallas. The loop consists of the Outer Loop Freeway Interstate 220 on the north and the Inner Loop Freeway, Louisiana Highway 3132, on the south, forming approximately an [...] semi-loop around downtown. Another loop is formed by the Bert Kouns Industrial Loop (Louisiana Highway 526) and circles further south bisecting Interstate 49. Interstate 49 now extends north to Interstate 30 in Arkansas.|$|E

50|$|No {{matter which}} method of bore {{sighting}} is used, {{the result is}} to align the <b>cross-hairs</b> of the scope {{to the spot where}} the barrel is pointing at a particular distance. Because of variations in the trajectory of ammunition and other factors the bore-sighted rifle will probably not shoot to the exact spot that the <b>cross-hairs</b> indicate, and live ammunition will need to be fired to fine-tune the sighting process.|$|R
5000|$|For {{focusing}} {{of the eye}} piece, {{point the}} telescope to the sky or hold a piece of white paper in front of telescope. Move the eye-piece in and out until a distinct sharp black image of the <b>cross-hairs</b> is seen. This confirms proper focusing.|$|R
2500|$|An {{important}} aspect of the game was the ability to hunt. Using guns and bullets bought over the course of play, players select the hunt option (#8) and hunt wild animals to add to their food reserves. In the original version, there were no graphics and players were timed on how fast they could type [...] "BANG," [...] "WHAM," [...] or [...] "POW," [...] with misspelled words resulting in a failed hunt. In the first full-graphics version, players controlled a little man who could aim a rifle in one of eight directions and fire single shots at animals. In later versions, players hunted with a <b>cross-hair</b> controlled by the mouse or touch screen (or the Wii Remote pointer in the Wii version). Bison were the slowest moving targets and yielded the most food, while rabbits and squirrels were fast and offered very small amounts of food. Deer (eastern section) and elk (western section) were in the middle in terms of speed, size, and food yield; bears were between bison and deer in all three properties. While the number of wild game shot during a hunting excursion is limited by only the player's supply of bullets, the maximum amount of meat that can be carried back to the wagon is 100 pounds in early versions of the game. In later versions, as long as there were at least two living members of the wagon party, 200 pounds could be carried back to the wagon. In the later version, players could hunt in different environments. For example, hunting during winter would result in graphics showing grass covered in snow. In later versions, the over-hunting of animals would result in [...] "scarcity" [...] and reduce the number of animals that appeared later in the game. [...] Also, some versions also allow the player to go fishing, with the 40th anniversary version released on Wii and Nintendo 3DS using motion controls to cast the fishing rod.|$|E

5000|$|Dead Zero in sniper and {{precision}} shooting usage {{refers to the}} desirable state of affairs where after several trial shots (called [...] "ranging shots") the vertical part of the <b>cross-hair</b> on the reticle has been adjusted for the distance and elevation of the target, and the horizontal part of the <b>cross-hair</b> has been adjusted for windage, and so the crossing of the two {{in the field of}} view of the shooter corresponds to the anticipated point of impact. The cross-hairs meet on the target just as one sees on movie and TV use of telescopic sights.|$|E
40|$|Gyroscopes and gyrotheodolites {{need to be}} {{calibrated}} in arranged {{time period}} for their proper function. As known these instruments measure horizontal angles from the astronomical North (astronomical Azimuth) with an accuracy of ± 3 ″. This calibration is done with a collimator system, which is a level telescope set to the infinity. As an instrument is {{placed in front of}} the collimator’s telescope, its <b>cross-hairs</b> are aligned with the <b>cross-hairs</b> of the collimator and the instrument measures the astronomical azimuth of the direction between the point where it is forced centered and the point where the collimator’s <b>cross-hairs</b> coincide. This work presents a method for the accurate determination of the astronomical azimuth of a given direction. The theoretical analysis, of a new method, which leads, to the determination of the astronomical azimuth, in short time (about 20 min) is described. The achieved accuracy is also given. This determination may be done by astrogeodetic observations to the Polaris (α Ursa Minoris) by using a new-constructed system consisting of a high accuracy total station connected with a GPS receiver, which provides accurate UTC time. The astronomical azimuth will be transferred accurately to the demanded direction at the collimator system {{at the time of its}} installation by an autocollimation procedure using convenient equipment. An application of the methodology at a specific collimator is presented accompanied by the results and the achieved accuracy...|$|R

This {{is the process of}} {{adjusting}} the scope so that the bullet's points-of-impact is at the point-of-aim (centre of scope or scope's <b>cross-hairs)</b> for a specific distance. A rifle and scope should retain its zero as long as possible under all conditions to reduce the need to re-zero during missions.|$|R
50|$|The M16 reticle {{features}} a range-estimator and a three-point <b>cross-hair</b> that provides an aiming point for close range, 200m and 400m. The same reticle {{is also used}} for the M203 and the M79.|$|E
50|$|While the {{traditional}} thin crossing lines are {{the original and}} still the most familiar <b>cross-hair</b> shape, they are really best suited for precision aiming at high contrast targets, as the thin lines are easily lost in complex backgrounds, such as those encountered while hunting. Thicker bars are much easier to discern against a complex background, but lack the precision of thin bars. The most popular types of <b>cross-hair</b> in modern scopes are variants on the duplex <b>cross-hair,</b> with bars that are thick on the perimeter and thin out in the middle. The thick bars allow the eye to quickly locate {{the center of the}} reticle, and the thin lines in the center allow for precision aiming. The thin bars in a duplex reticle may also be designed {{to be used as a}} measure. Called a 30/30 reticle, the thin bars on such a reticle span 30 minutes of an arc (0.5º), which happens to be close to 30 inches at 100 yards. This enables an experienced shooter to deduce (as opposed to guess or estimate) the range within an acceptable error limit.|$|E

40|$|The {{apparatus}} used in {{the experiment}} which {{is the subject of}} this communication is related to that named after Puccianti. It consists essentially of identical tubes about 85 cm. long with optically plane parallel ends placed in the arms of an interferometer and filled to the same pressure with hydrogen. A powerful discharge was passed through one of the tubes while "white-light" fringes from a high intensity carbon arc were being observed. The fringes were made horizontal and focussed on the narrow vertical slit of a spectroscope or a very fast spectrograph. The fiducial point was provided in the visual observations by the <b>cross-hairs</b> of the spectroscope and in the photographic by a very fine wire stretched horizontally across the slit of the spectrograph. The field presented was then a bright continuous spectrum traversed by a number of almost horizontal slightly curved and very black fringes and also by the very sharp horizontal shadow of the <b>cross-hairs</b> or the wire across the slit...|$|R

50|$|For the Wii U Virtual Console {{release of}} Duck Hunt, the Wii Remote {{is used in}} the place of an NES Zapper. During gameplay, a <b>cross-hair</b> is used to shoot the ducks, but the <b>cross-hair</b> can be turned off. Other NES Zapper game re-releases {{followed}} suit. On the original NES hardware, the screen would flash every time the NES Zapper's trigger was pulled. Due to the fact most modern TV sets cannot support the NES Zapper, only CRT TV sets made before the early 2000s work with the original NES version of Duck Hunt. This also meant the NES emulation required additional coding to support the Wii Remote pointer feature.|$|E
50|$|Raven Software's November 1994 release CyClones {{featured}} a rather primitive {{implementation of the}} free look; main movement was via keyboard (with turning and strafing via key combinations), but the on-screen weapon aim point was moved independently via the mouse. Moving the aim point {{against the edge of}} the screen would cause the viewpoint to shift up (only temporarily) or to the side (again, haltingly). Unfortunately, this system proved cumbersome and Raven Software did not develop this particular system further. The 1993 DOS version of Bram Stoker's Dracula also used the mouse to aim the player's weapon <b>cross-hair,</b> similar to CyClones, but the player's viewpoint was controlled entirely by the keyboard and did not move with the <b>cross-hair.</b>|$|E
50|$|To measure {{an unknown}} slope, the {{surveyor}} first sights a target along that slope and then adjusts {{the angle of}} the level until the bubble is centered on the <b>cross-hair.</b> Once this is done, the slope may be read from the scale.|$|E
50|$|Article IV {{defines the}} make-up the {{judicial}} {{branch of the}} state and prohibits the legislature from inhibiting its function. Similar to the federal government, the power to impeach state officials and judges, in the <b>cross-hairs,</b> are given to the state House of Representatives. The Senate can remove a person from office with a 2/3 majority vote after an impeachment. This article also deals with the necessary qualifications of a judge and confers the power of judicial review with the state’s Supreme Court.|$|R

2500|$|With the {{enormous}} {{success of the}} early games, dozens of developers jumped into the development and manufacturing of video arcade games. Some simply copied the [...] "invading alien hordes" [...] idea of Space Invaders and turned out successful imitators like Namco's Galaxian, Galaga, and Gaplus, though they took the shoot 'em up genre further with new gameplay mechanics, more complex enemy patterns, and richer graphics. Galaxian introduced a [...] "risk-reward" [...] concept, while Galaga {{was one of the}} first games with a bonus stage.

50|$|The game is mission-based, {{with each}} mission {{separated}} by a cut scene video. On harder difficulties, there are more objectives that must be completed before the player can progress. These extra objectives involved collecting various intelligence documents, blueprints, or destroying parts of the environment.

Had a vessel's service speed fallen short of her contract performance specifications, BC Ferries could levy a fine of CAD $160,000 (€100,000) per tenth of a knot below specifications. If the ferries had fallen one knot below specifications, BC Ferries could similarly cancel the contract for a full refund. However, as BC Ferries is in dire needs of new ships to replace its ageing, single hulled V-class ferries, a problem increasingly in the media <b>cross-hairs</b> since the March 22, 2006 foundering of , it was unlikely the corporation would have cancelled any new ferry for being too late or too slow.|$|R

50|$|A {{gyroscope}} was attached, via mechanical linkage, to {{an optical}} monocular sight {{to form the}} gyro rate unit or GRU. Gyroscopes, when spinning, keep their spin axes pointed in a given direction if they are undisturbed. As the <b>cross-hairs</b> of the optical sight are kept centred on the moving aircraft the mechanical linkage will pull the gyroscope {{in the direction of}} the aircraft movement. The force required to move the gyroscope is proportional to the observed target movement across the line of sight. This force was measured by the deflection of a spring-loaded device and the deflection measurement was combined with rangefinder, and/or, radar measured target range and altitude in a specialized computer, the gyro rate unit box (GRUB).|$|R
