It was found that 39 chemical compounds repelled bees (primarily alkaloids, <b>coumarins,</b> and saponins) and three terpene compounds attracted bees.

5|$|In some countries, other <b>coumarins</b> {{are used}} instead of warfarin, such as {{acenocoumarol}} and phenprocoumon. These have a shorter (acenocoumarol) or longer (phenprocoumon) half-life, and are not completely interchangeable with warfarin. Several types of anticoagulant drugs offering the efficacy of warfarin without a need for monitoring, such as dabigatran, apixaban, edoxaban and rivaroxaban, have been approved {{in a number of}} countries for classical warfarin uses like the more common types of atrial fibrillation, and others in the same drug classes are under development. There is a reversal agent available for dabigatran (idarucizumab) but not for apixaban, edoxaban and rivaroxaban.|$|E

25|$|Vitamin K is an {{essential}} factor to a hepatic gamma-glutamyl carboxylase that adds a carboxyl group to glutamic acid residues on factors II, VII, IX and X, as well as Protein S, Protein C and Protein Z. In adding the gamma-carboxyl group to glutamate residues on the immature clotting factors Vitamin K is itself oxidized. Another enzyme, Vitamin K epoxide reductase, (VKORC) reduces vitamin K back to its active form. Vitamin K epoxide reductase is pharmacologically important as a target of anticoagulant drugs warfarin and related <b>coumarins</b> such as acenocoumarol, phenprocoumon, and dicumarol. These drugs create a deficiency of reduced vitamin K by blocking VKORC, thereby inhibiting maturation of clotting factors. Vitamin K deficiency from other causes (e.g., in malabsorption) or impaired vitamin K metabolism in disease (e.g., in liver failure) lead {{to the formation of}} PIVKAs (proteins formed in vitamin K absence) which are partially or totally non-gamma carboxylated, affecting the coagulation factors' ability to bind to phospholipid.|$|E

500|$|Dicoumarol was {{a product}} of the plant {{molecule}} coumarin (not to be confused with Coumadin, a later tradename for warfarin).

40|$|Introduction: A large {{proportion}} of the <b>coumarin</b> dose variability is explained by environmental factors and by common genetic variants in the VKORC 1 and CYP 2 C 9 genes.

Areas covered: This review discusses the current state of <b>coumarin</b> pharmacogenetics, the evidence from recent randomized controlled trials and economic evaluations regarding the possible clinical implementation of genotype-guided <b>coumarin</b> dosing. Expert opinion: When the VKORC 1 and CYP 2 C 9 genotypes are available before the start of <b>coumarin</b> therapy in individuals of European ancestry, a genetic-guided algorithm should be used for dose determination.
