50|$|For VIM-VAR steels, {{the surface}} of the cooled {{electrodes}} must be ground to remove surface irregularities and impurities before the next vacuum remelt. Then the ground electrode is placed in a VAR furnace. In a VAR furnace the steel gradually melts drop-by-drop in the vacuum-sealed <b>chamber.</b> <b>Vacuum</b> arc remelting further removes lingering inclusions to provide superior steel cleanliness and further remove gases such as oxygen, nitrogen and hydrogen. Controlling the rate at which these droplets form and solidify ensures a consistency of chemistry and microstructure throughout the entire VIM-VAR ingot. This in turn makes the steel more resistant to fracture or fatigue. This refinement process is essential to meet the performance characteristics of parts like a helicopter rotor shaft, a flap actuator on a military jet or a bearing in a jet engine.|$|E
50|$|Double chamber sealers {{require the}} entire product {{to be placed}} in a plastic bag within the machine. Once the product is placed in the machine on the seal bar, the lid is closed and air is removed. Then a seal bar inside the chamber seals the product in the bag, after sealing the bag the chamber is {{refilled}} with air by the automatic opening of a vent to the outside. This oncoming pressure squeezes all remaining air in the bag. The lid is then opened and the product removed. Double chamber sealers are typically used for medium-volume packaging, and also have the capability to vacuum seal liquids. The lid generally swings from one side to another, increasing production speed over a single chamber model. Double <b>chamber</b> <b>vacuum</b> packaging machines generally have either spring-weighted lids or fully automatic lids.|$|E

40|$|AbstractTo {{understand}} the suppression effect of <b>vacuum</b> <b>chamber</b> scales on gas explosion in a tunnel, {{we compared the}} gas explosion flame and pressure propagation in a tunnel with the <b>vacuum</b> <b>chambers</b> of different cross sections and lengths. The suppression effects of <b>vacuum</b> <b>chambers</b> on gas explosion were assessed by the flame propagation distance, the flame propagation velocity, and the overpressure-impulse rule (P-I rule). The results indicate that 1) the <b>vacuum</b> <b>chamber</b> can absorb the explosion wave and explosion energy {{as much as possible}} {{at the beginning of the}} gas explosion; 2) for the <b>vacuum</b> <b>chambers</b> with the same cross section and at a certain range of lengths, the suppression effects are enhanced with the chamber length increasing; however, over the range of the <b>vacuum</b> <b>chamber</b> length, the suppression effects will not be improved any more by increasing the <b>vacuum</b> <b>chamber</b> length; and 3) the <b>vacuum</b> <b>chambers</b> with larger cross sections are of more effective flame quenching and explosion suppressing...|$|R
40|$|A <b>vacuum</b> <b>chamber</b> {{is used as}} a {{new method}} to {{suppress}} gas explosion. Explosion propagation characteristics were studied in a system composed of rectangular pipes and a <b>vacuum</b> <b>chamber.</b> The volume of the <b>vacuum</b> <b>chamber</b> was adjusted by inserting PVC sheets into it. Two groups of explosion suppression experiments were conducted. In one group, the distance between the <b>vacuum</b> <b>chamber</b> and the explosive source point was 3 [*]m and in the other group, this distance was 4 [*]m. The results demonstrated that the effect of explosion suppression of the <b>vacuum</b> <b>chamber</b> is related to the <b>vacuum</b> <b>chamber’s</b> critical volume. When the volume of the <b>vacuum</b> <b>chamber</b> was greater than the critical volume, the chamber exhibited a good explosion suppression effect. When the volume of the <b>vacuum</b> <b>chamber</b> was less than the critical volume, it could not suppress the explosion, and the explosive pressure and flame were stronger than those measured {{in the absence of the}} <b>vacuum</b> <b>chamber.</b> On the basis of the experimental results, we further analyzed the suppression mechanism of the <b>vacuum</b> <b>chamber</b> and concluded that stretching of the explosion flame front as well as alteration of the composition of the explosive gas led to the explosive flame being extinguished...|$|R

To investigate the annealing temperature {{effect on the}} fabrication of self-assembled Au droplets, each growth was performed at 50 °C, 100 °C, 150 °C, 250 °C, 350 °C, 550 °C, 700 °C, 800 °C, 850 °C, 900 °C, and 950 °C, respectively. Initially, 1 -mm-thick singular 4 -in. p-type Si (111) wafers were 1 [*]×[*] 1 cm 2 diced by a wire-sawing machine and treated with a conventional RCA clean. Each sample is degassed at 850 °C for 15 min under a <b>chamber</b> <b>vacuum</b> of 1 [*]×[*] 10 − 4 Torr, and subsequently, 2 -nm-thick gold films were deposited in a plasma ion-coater chamber under a pressure of 1 [*]×[*] 10 − 1 Torr {{at a rate of}} 0.05 nm/s with 3 -mA ionization current. For a systematic annealing, a computer-operated recipe was run and the ramping-up rate was at 2.3 °C/s under 1 [*]×[*] 10 − 4 Torr. After reaching each target annealing temperature, 30 s of annealing time was given for each sample, and finally, the temperature was quenched down immediately after finishing each growth to minimize Ostwald ripening [19, 25]. The quenching process was kept identical for all samples. An atomic force microscope (AFM) was utilized for the surface morphology characterization, and XEI software was used for analyzing the obtained data.|$|E

40|$|The growth {{process of}} {{vertically}} aligned {{single-walled carbon nanotube}} (SWNT) films was investigated by means of in situ optical analysis and scanning electron microscopy. The measurements reveal that {{the growth of the}} SWNT film decreases after longer reaction times. This decrease is attributed to a combination of a diminishing growth rate and burning of the SWNTs due to oxygen in the growth chamber. Using an observed correlation between the optical absorbance of SWNT films and the film thickness, the general behavior of the SWNT film growth process was determined. It was found that burning of the SWNT film could be suppressed by enhancing the quality of the <b>chamber</b> <b>vacuum</b> seal, which also lead to thicker film growth.
