Interference of economic crises, natural disasters and other emergencies may cause the node fails in social <b>cooperation</b> <b>networks.</b> To further study the influences of node failure on the total fitness degree and the cooperative ratio in social <b>cooperation</b> <b>networks,</b> the update rules of individual strategy and networks self-repair are constructed {{on the basis of the}} social <b>cooperation</b> <b>networks</b> and evolutionary game theory. For different types of social <b>cooperation</b> <b>networks,</b> the dynamic evolution in the <b>cooperation</b> <b>networks</b> with node failure is respectively analyzed by the agent-based simulation experiments. Simulation results show that the node failure not only reduces the total fitness degree of various social <b>cooperation</b> <b>networks,</b> but also reduces the cooperative ratio in two-group and multi-group <b>cooperation</b> <b>networks.</b> However, in the single-group <b>cooperation</b> <b>networks,</b> the cooperative ratio is improved by node failure. In addition, by introducing the self-repair rules, the emergence of a few of new cooperative nodes can break the stable state and promote the total fitness degree and the cooperative ratio of <b>cooperation</b> <b>networks...</b>|$|R

Our main research {{hypothesis is that}} the {{membership in}} <b>cooperation</b> <b>networks</b> {{is related to the}} degree of the knowledge spillover. The approach has two scenarios: cost symmetry and cost asymmetry. We first develop an analytical model with three stages: firstly, firms decide whether to participate in a cooperative research network; secondly they simultaneously choose the level of R&D output, and finally they choose the level of output. Then we proceed with computational simulations to verify our hypothesis. From our results, we were able to conclude that cooperation leads to an improvement on RJV firms’ position in the market as they produce more than others with the same production conditions. Additionally, cooperating firms have to spend fewer resources on research, which turns the network a tremendous success on the productive efficiency level...|$|R

It is common to find associations of various prestigious universities collaborating in a high-­‐technology research project including a very specialized teaching as well. This is the most common <b>cooperation</b> <b>networks</b> among higher education institutions in developed countries. An increasingly common type of networking between developed and developing universities is related to cooperation for development. This is the case of many universities in Africa that are needed for external help in order to improve its capabilities. Numerous memorandums of understanding regarding first world institutions that collaborate with universities in developing countries describe contributions of eventual visiting professors, teaching material and courses. But probably there exist another type of more important, but less explored association, such as networking among developing universities.
