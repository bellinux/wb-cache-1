2500|$|Foxes are omnivores. The diet of foxes {{is largely}} {{made up of}} {{invertebrates}} such as insects, and small vertebrates such as reptiles and birds, and can include eggs and plants. Many species are generalist predators, but some (such as the <b>crab-eating</b> <b>fox)</b> have more specialized diets. Most species of fox consume around [...] of food every day. Foxes cache excess food, burying it for later consumption, usually under leaves, snow, or soil. Foxes tend to use a pouncing technique where they crouch down to camouflage themselves in the terrain, then using their hind legs, leap up with great force to land {{on top of their}} targeted prey. Using their pronounced canine teeth, foxes grip on to their prey's neck and either shake until the prey is dead, or until the animal can be disemboweled.|$|E

40|$|Background: The {{relationships}} between heterogeneities in host infection and infectiousness (transmission to arthropod vectors) can {{provide important insights}} for disease management. Here, we quantify heterogeneities in Leishmania infantum parasite numbers in reservoir and non-reservoir host populations, and relate this to their infectiousness during natural infection. Tissue parasite number was evaluated as a potential surrogate marker of host transmission potential. Methods: Parasite numbers were measured by qPCR in bone marrow and ear skin biopsies of 82 dogs and 34 <b>crab-eating</b> <b>foxes</b> collected during a longitudinal study in Amazon Brazil, for which previous data was available on infectiousness (by xenodiagnosis) and severity of infection. Results: Parasite numbers were highly aggregated both between samples and between individuals. In dogs, total parasite abundance and relative numbers in ear skin compared to bone marrow increased with the duration and severity of infection. Infectiousness to the sandfly vector was associated with high parasite numbers; parasite number in skin was {{the best predictor of}} being infectious. <b>Crab-eating</b> <b>foxes,</b> which typically present asymptomatic infection and are non-infectious, had parasite numbers comparable to those of non-infectious dogs.

40|$|Abstract: The Brazilian savanna, {{also known}} as Cerrado, {{is one of the}} world's richest and most ecologically {{invaluable}} tropical savanna regions. There are few studies in Brazil about the diseases that affect the wild canids of this biome, which may be harmful to wildlife populations and public health. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the occurrence of antibodies against Leptospira spp. in three Cerrado wild canids species using the microscopic agglutination test (MAT). Serum samples were tested from 19 <b>crab-eating</b> <b>foxes</b> (Cerdocyon thous), 14 maned wolves (Chrysocyon brachyurus), and seven hoary foxes (Lycalopex vetulus), all free-ranging animals found in the municipalities of Araguari and Uberlândia, Minas Gerais State, and Cumari, Goiás State, Brazil. Fourteen (35 %) of these samples were seropositive. The most frequent serovars detected in the samples were Copenhageni and Hardjo, but reactions to the serovars Autumnalis, Grippotyphosa, Hebdomadis, Wolffi, and Icterohaemorrhagiae also occurred. Notwithstanding other reported results, this study is the first to report the presence of antibodies against Leptospira spp. in L. vetulus. The three species of wild canids examined may act as potential hosts for several serovars of leptospira in Brazil's savanna environment...|$|R

40|$|The {{spread of}} enteric viruses of {{domestic}} animals {{and human beings}} to wild species can be facilitated by the resistance of these viruses {{on the environment and}} their ability to be transmitted by water and contaminated food. The health status of the populations of pampas foxes (Lycalopex gymnocercus) and <b>crab-eating</b> <b>foxes</b> (Cerdocyon thous) is largely unknown and the landscapes occupied by these animals in southern Brazil have been threatened by human occupation and expansion of agriculture. In this work, the search of genomes of human and canine adenoviruses in feces from these wild carnivores was used to track the dissemination of domestic animals and human pathogens to the free-living populations in a wildlife reserve located in southern Brazil. This was performed by virus-specific differential real-time polymerase chain reactions (qPCR) on stool specimens, avoiding capture and additional stress to the animals. Genus-specific conventional reverse-transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) was complementarily performed aiming the detection of enteroviruses (EV) and rotaviruses (RV) on these same samples. HAdV genomes were found on 14 out of the 17 (82. 35 %) stool samples analysed, whereas CAV was found co-infecting 5 of these samples. RV genomes were detected on 7 of the 17 samples (41. 18 %) and all samples were negative for EV. The results point to the dispersion of HAdV and RV at a high rate to these species of South American wild carnivores, which can be an effect of growing anthropisation of the habitat of these animals. </p...|$|R

40|$|Evaluating {{the risk}} of disease {{spill-over}} from domestic dogs to wildlife depends on knowledge of inter-specific contact rates and/or exposure to aetiological agents in dog environments. Here, contact rates of <b>crab-eating</b> <b>foxes</b> (Cerdocyon thous) with sympatric domestic dog populations were measured over 25 months in Amazon Brazil. Foxes and dogs were serologically and clinically monitored for exposure to canine parvovirus (CPV- 2) and canine distemper virus (CDV), pathogens known to have caused wildlife population declines elsewhere. Twenty-two of 24 (92 %) tagged foxes visited one or more houses in a median 2 (range 1 - 3) villages per night where dog densities ranged from 7. 2 to 15. 4 per km(2) (mean 9. 5 per km(2)). Foxes spent an average 6. 4 % (0 - 40. 3 %) of their 10 h nocturnal activity period in villages, the equivalent of 38 m (range 0 - 242) per night. The rate of potential exposure to disease agents was thus high, though varied by 3 orders of magnitude for individual foxes. Overall, 46 % of the fox population was responsible for 80 % of all contacts. None of the 37 monitored foxes however showed serological or clinical evidence of infection with CPV- 2 or CDV. Seroprevalences for CPV- 2 and CDV antibodies in the local domestic dog population were 13 % (3 / 23) and 9 % (2 / 23), respectively. and 89 % of 97 monitored pups born during the study presented clinical signs consistent with active CPV- 2 infection (haemorrhagic diarrhoea, vomiting, rapid morbidity and emaciation). Although {{there was no evidence}} for infection with either virus in foxes, the high level of contact of foxes with peridomestic habitats suggests that the probability of potential spill-over infections from dogs to foxes is high.
