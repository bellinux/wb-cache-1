5|$|A mayor-council {{government}} {{has been in place}} in Tulsa since 1989 when the city converted from a city commission government deemed wasteful and less efficient.

The prequel was made available for the full game in October 1999 as a custom map campaign, adding two extra missions and hosting it on Battle.net. In addition, the full release of StarCraft included a secondary campaign entitled Enslavers. Consisting of five missions played as both the Terrans and the Protoss, Enslavers {{is set in the}} second campaign in StarCraft and follows the story of a Terran smuggler who manages to take <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Zerg cerebrate and is pursued by both the Protoss and Terran Dominion.

5|$|By {{the late}} 1990s the Society's {{membership}} {{had dropped to}} a few dozen, and under the <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> new warden it invited Knight {{to return to the}} group in order to help promote it. Knight agreed, leaving his own lodge to publish two works by Fortune based on her material in the Society's archive, and authoring a biography of her. The 1990s saw a number of pioneering biographical studies of Fortune, including Alan Richardson's in 1991 and Janine Chapman's in 1993. Richardson's book relied heavily on the recollections of Christine Hartley, while the publication of Fielding and Carr was based upon the authors' interactions with older members of the Society. However, in 2007 Graf noted that Fortune had yet to receive much scholarly attention.|$|E
5|$|Castro stockpiled {{weapons for}} a planned {{attack on the}} Moncada Barracks, a {{military}} garrison outside Santiago de Cuba, Oriente. Castro's militants intended to dress in army uniforms and arrive at the base on July 25, the festival of St James, when many officers would be away. The rebels would seize control, raid the armory and escape before reinforcements arrived. Supplied with new weaponry, Castro intended to arm supporters and spark a revolution among Oriente's impoverished cane cutters. The plan was to then seize <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Santiago radio station, broadcasting the Movement's manifesto, hence promoting further uprisings. Castro's plan emulated those of the 19th century Cuban independence fighters who had raided Spanish barracks; Castro saw himself as the heir to independence leader and national hero José Martí.|$|E
5|$|Church {{and state}} {{maintained}} close {{relations in the}} Anglo-Saxon period, both socially and politically. Churchmen attended royal feasts as well as meetings of the Royal Council. During Æthelstan's reign these relations became even closer, especially as the archbishopric of Canterbury had come under West Saxon jurisdiction since Edward the Elder annexed Mercia, and Æthelstan's conquests brought the northern church under the <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> southern king for the first time.|$|E

5|$|Despite this policy, Belgium was invaded {{without warning}} by German forces on 10 May 1940. After 18 days of fighting, the Belgian {{military}} surrendered on 28 May {{and the country}} was placed under the <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> German military government. Between 600,000 and 650,000 Belgian men (nearly 20% of the country's male population) had been mobilized to fight.|$|E
5|$|Domination: Two teams {{compete to}} control various control points to earn points. Standard maps contain three control points. Control of these points is {{initially}} accomplished through occupation (physically occupying the space), but <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> point continues until a player from another team occupies the space. The first team {{to reach the}} point limit, or that has the most points when a time limit has expired, wins.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} 1950s, Charles H. Zimmerman of the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) {{developed}} {{a system for}} <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> rotorcraft in which, with the rotors mounted {{on the underside of}} the aircraft, the machine could be steered by the pilot through the simple shifting of his weight, and kept stable through the actions of his natural reflexes. Known as kinesthetic control, and similar in principle to the mechanics of riding a bicycle or a surfboard, it was hoped that the concept would allow for pilots to operate an aircraft with little to no training time. NACA testing proved that the idea had merit, and several companies, including Bensen Aircraft, Hiller Aircraft, and de Lackner Helicopters, began development of rotorcraft using the concept.|$|E
