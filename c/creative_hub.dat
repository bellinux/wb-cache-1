25|$|Manchester {{city centre}} has many nightclubs, {{many of which}} follow in the {{footsteps}} of the Haçienda nightclub which has now closed; the site has been redeveloped as a housing complex. There is a gay village around the Canal Street area in the east of the city centre, which plays host to an annual Gay Pride Festival, and a large Chinatown with numerous far eastern style restaurants. The area to the west which is bisected by Deansgate and crossed by Peter Street is also well-provided with bars and some clubs (e.g. The Moon under Water and Ampersand). Rafters was a nightclub located in St James's Buildings. A number of reputable bands played concerts at Rafters in the 1970s and 1980s. Rafters closed in 1983. In its final years the DJ was Mike Shaft who appeared on Piccadilly Radio with Takin' Care of Business. After that the club was renamed as Jilly's which existed to 1993, after which the club was called MusicBox. The city centre also has many bars, mostly located in the Northern Quarter, regarded by some as the central district's <b>creative</b> <b>hub.</b> The quarter is well-provided with bars of various sizes; these include 'TV 21', 'Bar Fringe', the cocktail bar 'Apotheca' and 'Trof'. Live music venues may also be found here, including the well-known 'Night & Day Cafe', newcomer 'MOHO Live' and jazz bar 'Matt & Phred's'.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} {{reflects on}} the potential of innovation networks made up of ‘creative hubs’ as facilitators of design in a local context, by using the SPRNG! project from Leeuwarden as a case study, analyzing the initiative based on a systemic multilevel design perspective. In this approach, an iterative four phase cyclic design process is being combined with a hierarchical systems perspective (Joore 2012). Briefly described, <b>creative</b> <b>hubs</b> are physical spaces that host artists, designers, small companies, collaborations or events related to these. While providing networking opportunities, these <b>hubs</b> also help <b>creative</b> individuals to achieve their aims. <b>Creative</b> <b>hubs</b> receive many different names, varying from ‘collectives’ to ‘incubators’, yet {{it is possible to}} identify a common goal of improving creative businesses holistically...|$|R
40|$|Santiago, Chile's capital city, has {{undergone}} numerous {{changes in its}} urban fabric due the process of economic globalisation since mid 1980 s, affecting its social, physical and economic configurations. But behind all those changes, the concentration of high knowledge-based activities has been proof critical to improve the innovation capacity of the city; in Santiago's case those are the information and communications technologies (ICT) and biotechnology, mainly clustered in central areas. Several government initiatives have encouraged new approaches to improve these technology concentrations, most of them based in the 'Technology Park' typology, disconnected from the traditional networks of knowledge. In this context, the University Neighborhood of Santiago (UNS) project could reveal some clues where to encourage future development. Thus, the unplanned formation of <b>creative</b> <b>hubs</b> in areas in regeneration is presented as two complementary processes that could lead a more sustainable approach to the future development of city historical centres.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} the results of an international study of creative industry policies and strategies, based on a survey of public-sector creative city initiatives and plans and their underlying rationales. As well as this survey and an accompanying literature review, interviews were carried out with senior policy-makers and intermediaries from Europe, North America, Africa and south-east Asia. The paper considers the scope and scale of so-called new-industrial clusters in local cultural and creative quarters and sub-regional <b>creative</b> <b>hubs,</b> which are the subject of policy interventions and public—private investment. The semantic and symbolic expansion of the cultural industries and their concentration in once-declining urban and former industrial districts, to the creative industries, and now to the knowledge and experience economy, is revealed in economic, sectoral and spatial terms. Whilst policy convergence and emulation are evident, manifested by the promotion of creative spaces and industry clusters and versions of the digital media and science city, this is driven by a meta-analysis of growth in the new economy, but one that is being achieved by old industrial economic interventions and policy rationales. These are being used to justify the redevelopment of former and residual industrial zones, with cities utilising the <b>creative</b> quarter/knowledge <b>hub</b> as a panacea to implement broader city expansion and regeneration plans...|$|R
40|$|Culture-oriented {{activities}} conducted by diverse actors in selected urban areas {{may lead to}} the formation of unique quarters of production and consumption of cultural goods and services which function both as <b>creative</b> <b>hubs</b> and leisure spaces. Such cultural quarters may develop spontaneously or as a result of official designation and major public investment. Referring to the debate on cultural quarters in Western Europe, this article aims to examine the issue of the spatial concentration of cultural and creative activities within a selected large city in Poland. The author analyses recent transformations of two historic quarters in Cracow (Kazimierz and Podgórze) and considers the extent to which both areas can be regarded as successful cultural quarters. She describes their emergence and the changes observed in them in terms of groupings, character and number of creative-sector firms established there, pondering whether their role is limited to a function as centres of commercial cultural entertainment and night-life consumption, or whether they indeed stimulate the development of a creative economy...|$|R

The concepts of value networks, team mental models and shared ownership are used to design and analyse two co-design workshops that took place within the consortium: a co-reflection and a co-creation workshop. We will use the same concepts to reflect on how a bottom-up approach can be used for designing Smart Textile Services, and how a designer can contribute to this process. Further, we will indicate how we are planning to pursue this bottom-up approach in future research...|$|R

40|$|The 2000 s {{were marked}} by a {{resurgence}} of interest in creativity and cities. If the rapid global proliferation of the Internet and digital media technologies in the 1990 s had set off enthusiasm for a post-industrial ‘new economy’, where the significance of location would be in decline, the 2000 s saw an energetic search by artists, entrepreneurs, investors, policy-makers, journalists and many others to uncover the well-springs of creativity {{and its relationship to}} place (Flew 2012 a). This chapter begins with a discussion of the discourses or ‘scripts’ that have emerged to try and conceptualise the relationship between creativity and cities, notably theories of creative clusters, creative cities and creative class theories. Such work can be seen as representing a growth in the field of cultural economic geography although – as is noted in the chapter – it possesses some significant gaps. Among the issues that are drawn out in this book, and discussed in this chapter, are: the need to move beyond ‘imagined geographies’ of creative inner cities and come to terms with empirical evidence that suggests significant concentrations of the creative workforce in suburbs and regional cities; the relevance of urban cultural policy as a variable in the rise of cities as <b>creative</b> <b>hubs</b> or, in a different model, media capitals; and the challenges of bringing together cultural research with economic discourses in ways that get beyond caricatured representations of the ‘other’, as found, for instance, {{in some of the most}} influential framings of the concept of neo-liberalism...|$|R

40|$|There is a {{long history}} of the arts and artists having a {{positive}} impact in communities, particularly those communities facing economic decline or change. When commercial business can no longer feasibly operate within the high streets, artists have tended to move in, quietly and slowly, to fill the empty spaces and deserted buildings, pulling up the shutters and recreating the once-vibrant community of people, life and activity. As the name of the project suggests, 'Recreate' is about recreating what once existed within these communities with an emphasis on creativity as a driver for change. Over the last two years, French and UK organisations, who share a common belief in the transformative nature of the arts, have collaborated on the delivery of a number of projects and initiatives bringing together artists, decision-makers, local communities and cross-border partners in both countries. Recreate has offered a number of disused spaces a new lease of life through refurbishment developments, writing a new story for these once forgotten buildings. The purpose of these <b>creative</b> <b>hubs</b> has been to provide vital support and working spaces for artists. In many ways, the project has only just started its journey, creating seeds of activity rather than trying to harvest them. Over the coming years, it will be the legacy of the Recreate project and the new partnerships forged that will continue to grow the creative ecology in SouthEast England and Northern France. This publication brings together the wide body of work undertaken by the Photography Department at UCA Rochester. These projects have provided students with invaluable professional experience on live briefs in the UK and across the Channel, nurturing a new generation of creative individuals that will soon navigate the creative landscape when they leave formal education.

40|$|The author {{focuses on}} how urban {{policies}} and the clustering of creative industries has influenced urban outcomes. The set of creative industries include those with output protectable under some form of intellectual property law. More specifically, this sub-sector encompasses software, multimedia, video games, industrial design, fashion, publishing, and research and development. The cities that {{form the basis for}} the empirical investigations are those where policy-induced transitions have been most evident, including Boston; San Francisco; San Diego; Seattle; Austin; Washington, D. C.; Dublin (Ireland); Hong Kong (China); and Bangalore (India). The key research questions are: 1) What types of cities are creative? 2) What locational factors are essential? 3) What are the common urban policy initiatives used by creative cities? The author explores the importance of the external environment for innovation and places it in the larger context of national innovation systems. Based on a study of development in Boston and San Diego, he isolates the factors and policies that have contributed to the local clustering of particular creative industries. In both cities, universities have {{played a major role in}} catalyzing the local economy by generating cutting-edge research findings, proactively collaborating with industries, and supplying the needed human capital. In addition, these two cities benefited from the existence of anchor firms and active industry associations that promoted fruitful university-industry links. Many cities in East Asia are aspiring to become the <b>creative</b> <b>hubs</b> of the region. But their investments tend to be heavily biased toward infrastructure provision. Although this is necessary, the heavy emphasis on hardware can lead to underinvestment in developing the talents and skills needed for the emergence of creative industries in these cities.
