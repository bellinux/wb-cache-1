5|$|As a judge, Parker was {{notable for}} {{independently}} researching each <b>case</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> heard. He was {{generally considered to}} be pro-labor and was an active supporter of social reform legislation, for example upholding a maximum-hours law as constitutional. In the 1902 decision Roberson v. Rochester Folding Box Co, Parker found against a woman whose face had been used in advertisements without her permission, ruling that this use did not violate her common law privacy rights. The decision was unpopular in the press and led to the passage of a privacy law by the New York State Legislature the following year. In the same year, Parker upheld the death sentence given to convicted murderer Martha Place, who became the first woman to be executed by electric chair.|$|E
5|$|Plavalaguna {{is killed}} when the Mangalores attack the cruise ship, but Dallas succeeds in {{retrieving}} the stones from the Diva. During his {{struggle with the}} Mangalores he kills their leader. Meanwhile, Zorg arrives, shooting and seriously wounding Leeloo before taking a carrying <b>case</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> presumes contains the stones back to his spacecraft, leaving behind a time bomb that forces the liner's occupants to evacuate. Discovering the case to be empty, Zorg returns to the ship and deactivates his bomb, but a dying Mangalore sets off his own device, destroying the ship and killing Zorg. Dallas, Cornelius, Leeloo, and talk-show host Ruby Rhod escape with the stones aboard Zorg's spacecraft.|$|E
5|$|There are a {{large number}} of battles {{attributed}} to Wellington. Although many leave the impression that he was present or in command at those actions, it was sometimes the <b>case</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> entrusted other officers to engage the enemy, such as at remote locations, and that he could not have attended them all in person. Similarly, Wellington was not usually in command of rear guard actions, during advances or retreats, despite his army engaging in them often. Engagements where the lack of his presence is absolutely certain, or where his position is unconfirmed by records and accounts, are not included in his battle record.|$|E
50|$|Winick {{was also}} among the first jury consultants, using tools of {{sociology}} to advise lawyers on jury selection. Among the <b>cases</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> advised were those of Jean Harris and Claus von Bulow, both accused murderers.|$|R
5000|$|Hall {{has written}} several novels about a Plymouth-based {{television}} crime reporter, Dan Groves, nicknamed [...] "The TV Detective", who often helps police to solve <b>cases</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> is reporting on. The books are all set in Devon.|$|R
2500|$|In February 2005, Nissim Elmann, {{portrayed by}} {{prosecutors}} as a [...] "fixer", {{pleaded guilty to}} seven felonies and six misdemeanors.

25|$|In 1983, Louis Eppolito – {{a former}} New York Police Department (NYPD) detective {{who worked on}} behalf of the New York Mafia – was {{suspected}} in a corruption <b>case</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had provided NYPD intelligence reports on to Rosario. Rosario was also linked to the Pizza Connection probe, where dealers would sell drugs from pizzerias.|$|E
25|$|During {{the next}} two years, the messianists began publicizing their message on {{television}} and in newspaper advertisements. Some of Schneerson's collected speeches from the previous two years of his life were collected into pamphlets and published under the title Besuras Hageula. These especially were distributed by the messianic chasidim in an effort to bolster the <b>case</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> would be the Messiah despite his illness and that the coming of the Messiah is imminent. Such publications was used to bolster the hope that Schneerson would be the Mashiach.|$|E
25|$|A Magarha, Abdelbaset al-Megrahi {{was born}} in Tripoli on 1 April 1952 to a poor family. Although little is known of his early life, in 1971 he spent nine months {{studying}} in Cardiff, Wales and in the late 1970s he made multiple visits to the United States and Great Britain. Later, he {{was the head of}} security for Libyan Arab Airlines (LAA), and director of the Centre for Strategic Studies in Tripoli. It was alleged by the FBI and the prosecution in the Lockerbie <b>case</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was also an officer of the Libyan intelligence service, Jamahiriya el-Mukhabarat.|$|E

50|$|The {{next section}} shows {{a handful of}} {{cartoons}} that his editors rejected (or, in a few <b>cases,</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> never even bothered submitting), usually because they were considered in poor taste. Larson responds to everyone who's taken the trouble to complain, with a large print of a boy making a face.|$|R
5000|$|Hurkos and his {{endorsers}} maintained <b>that</b> <b>he</b> {{was a great}} psychic detective. By 1969, {{he cited}} the successful solution of 27 murder cases in 17 countries. However, {{in some cases the}} detectives assigned to these <b>cases</b> countered <b>that</b> Hurkos contributed no information unobtainable from newspapers and, in some <b>cases,</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had no part in the investigations whatsoever.

25|$|Gaitán, a {{practicing}} attorney, arrived home {{early on the}} morning of the 9th of April after the successful ending to a <b>case</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had been involved with. He returned to his office around 9:00a.m., where he worked on political matters till the afternoon. Later that day he was invited to lunch by a political supporter, Plinio Mendoza Neira. Other sympathizers would join them as well including a newspaper editor, a fellow politician and a physician. On their way out, the group was surprised by a lone gunman who fired several times at Gaitán from the front. Gaitán fell to the ground.|$|E
25|$|There {{are some}} {{exceptions}} for very {{high or low}} rolls, deemed criticals. No matter {{the level of the}} skill, a die roll of 18 is always a critical failure, and a roll of 3 or 4 is always a critical success (a roll of 17 is a critical failure as well, unless the character relevant skill level is 16 or more). The Game Master may decide in such cases that, in first case (a roll of 18, or 10+ over the modified skill level), the character has failed miserably and caused something disastrous to happen or, in the other <b>case,</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> or she succeeds incredibly well and gains some benefit as a result.|$|E
25|$|Susan Cooper's Dark Is Rising {{sequence}} (which commenced with Over Sea, Under Stone in 1965 and {{now more}} commonly bound {{in a single}} volume) have been compared to the Harry Potter series. The second novel, also called The Dark Is Rising, features a young boy named Will Stanton who discovers on his eleventh birthday {{that he is in}} fact imbued with magical power; in Will's <b>case,</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> is the last of the Old Ones, beings empowered by the Light to battle the Dark. The books open in much the same way, with Will finding that people are telling him strange things and that animals run from him. John Hodge, who wrote the screenplay for the film adaptation of , made substantial changes to the novel's plot and tone to differentiate it from Harry Potter.|$|E
50|$|A subplot of {{the novel}} {{involves}} Hopkins' relationship with his family. He adores his three daughters and deeply loves his wife, though he is chronically unfaithful to her. His wife loves Lloyd, but begins to realize that his habits are not healthy for their children, particularly his propensity for telling them about the <b>cases</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> has worked on.|$|R
50|$|Depending on the {{complexity}} and seriousness of the charge, the accused should not only be told of his right, but {{should be encouraged to}} exercise it. He should be given a reasonable time within which to do so. He should also be told in appropriate <b>cases</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> is entitled to apply to the Legal Aid Board for assistance.|$|R

In the end, the success of storm prediction using CAPE index is assessed...|$|R
25|$|Like his renowned British tenor {{predecessors}} Sims Reeves and Edward Lloyd, Coates had a famously protective wife. Moore {{refers to}} Coates' home life as serene, with an adorable spouse, sons and daughters; but he thought, despite Coates's good humour, {{he was not}} a happy person because he {{was too much of a}} worrier. Coates developed financial headaches, too. He wasted a good deal of money in a legal <b>case</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> launched against the Performing Right Society, in which he argued that he should not have to pay a royalty to perform music in public which had been brought to him in manuscript, and which therefore, by agreeing to sing it, Coates had encouraged the publishers to publish. He lost the case, and it preyed on his mind and finances for long after, though he refused offers of financial support from other singers. In his last years he thought of going back on the stage and started to slim, but he was seized with anaemia and became permanently confined to bed, frustrated at being unable to assist his country as the Second World War took hold. In July 1940, Gerald Moore presented a half-hour broadcast in tribute to their work together, and received a last letter from him in friendship and gratitude.|$|E
500|$|Coke {{has come}} under {{criticism}} for his examples to justify his decision. The first <b>case</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> gave, Tregor's Case, was seriously misquoted. Coke stated, [...] "Herle said some statutes are made against law and right, which those who made them perceiving, would not put into execution". In fact, there is no reference to [...] "law and right" [...] {{is found in the}} original text; Herle wrote that [...] "there are some statutes made which he himself who made them does not will to put into execution", meaning only that some statutes are poorly drafted, and if they cannot be interpreted to work, Parliament would accept the courts not applying them. Theodore Plucknett wrote, [...] "Whoever reads the whole of Herle's remarks can see that he did not regard the statute then under discussion as falling within this category; on the contrary, he suggested a perfectly obvious and straightforward interpretation of it.... Coke's first authority is far from convincing".|$|E
500|$|Salt Lake City police placed Bundy on 24-hour surveillance, and Thompson flew to Seattle {{with two}} other detectives to {{interview}} Kloepfer. She told them that in the year prior to Bundy's move to Utah she had discovered objects she [...] "couldn't understand" [...] in her house and in Bundy's apartment: a set of crutches; a bag of plaster of Paris that he admitted stealing from a medical supply house; a meat cleaver, never used for cooking, that he packed {{when he moved to}} Utah; surgical gloves; an Oriental knife in a wooden <b>case</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> kept in his glove compartment; and a sack full of women's clothing. Bundy was perpetually in debt, and Kloepfer suspected he had stolen almost everything of significant value that he owned. Once, when she confronted him over a new TV and stereo, he warned her, [...] "If you tell anyone, I'll break your fucking neck." [...] She said Bundy became [...] "very upset" [...] whenever she considered cutting her hair, which was long and parted in the middle. She would sometimes awaken {{in the middle of the}} night to find him under the bed covers with a flashlight, examining her body. He kept a lug wrench, taped halfway up the handle, in the trunk of her car—another Volkswagen Beetle, which he often borrowed—"for protection". The detectives confirmed that Bundy had not been with Kloepfer on any of the nights during which the Pacific Northwest victims had vanished, nor on the day Ott and Naslund were abducted. Shortly thereafter, Kloepfer was interviewed by Seattle homicide detective Kathy McChesney, and learned of the existence of Stephanie Brooks and her brief engagement to Bundy around Christmas 1973.|$|E

50|$|After {{serving in}} World War II, he practiced probate {{and civil rights}} law and was counsel for Roosevelt University in Chicago {{from the time of}} the school’s {{inception}} during the 1940s until his retirement four decades later.

2500|$|The Sadlers {{were both}} {{respected}} physicians, and William Sadler was a debunker of paranormal claims, who {{is portrayed as}} not believing in the supernatural. In 1929, he published a book called The Mind at Mischief, in which he explained the fraudulent methods of mediums and how self-deception leads to psychic claims.

2500|$|The {{decision}} of Baker v. Carr {{was one of}} the most wrenching in the Court's history. The case had to be put over for reargument because in conference no clear majority emerged for either side of the case. Associate Justice Charles Evans Whittaker [...] was so torn over the <b>case</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> eventually had to recuse himself for health reasons. The arduous decisional process in Baker is often blamed for Whittaker's subsequent health problems, which forced him to retire from the Court in 1962.|$|E
50|$|Cornell {{spent over}} 50 years {{investigating}} the paranormal {{and came to}} the conclusion <b>that</b> most paranormal <b>cases</b> turn out to have natural explanations such as the result of fraud, pranks and misidentification. <b>He</b> believed <b>that</b> many sightings of ghosts, hauntings and poltergeists are products of the human mind. Cornell estimated that of the 800 <b>cases</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> investigated, only twenty percent were difficult to explain and only a handful were paranormal.|$|R

2500|$|According to {{an investigative}} report {{published}} in January 2011 by Georgetown University, the Federal Bureau of Investigation used vein matching {{to determine that}} the perpetrator in the video of the killing of Pearl was most likely Mohammed, identifying him through a [...] "bulging vein" [...] running across his hand that was visible in the video. Federal officials had been concerned that Mohammed's confession obtained through waterboarding would not hold up in court. They intended to use this forensic evidence to bolster their <b>case</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had murdered Pearl.|$|E

50|$|The Daemonolatreiae {{contains}} citations from a {{great many}} authors, ancient and modern, including Johann Weyer, who is cited as an authority {{as if there were}} no differences between his position and that of Rémy.
