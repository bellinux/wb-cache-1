25|$|All {{types of}} {{asbestos}} fibers {{are known to}} cause serious health hazards in humans. Amosite and <b>crocidolite</b> are considered the most hazardous asbestos fiber types; however, chrysotile asbestos has also produced tumors in animals and is a recognized cause of asbestosis and malignant mesothelioma in humans, and mesothelioma has been observed in people who were occupationally exposed to chrysotile, {{family members of the}} occupationally exposed, and residents who lived close to asbestos factories and mines.|$|E

2500|$|<b>Crocidolite</b> {{commonly}} {{occurs as}} soft friable fibers. Asbestiform amphibole may also occur as soft friable fibers but some varieties such as amosite are commonly straighter.

2500|$|Amphiboles {{including}} amosite (brown asbestos) and <b>crocidolite</b> (blue asbestos) were formerly used in {{many products}} until the early 1980s.

50|$|<b>Crocidolite</b> {{asbestos}} was mined in South Africa, Bolivia {{and also}} at Wittenoom, Western Australia. Bolivian <b>crocidolite</b> {{was used in}} Kent Micronite cigarette filters in the 1950s. Blue asbestos was also used in early gas masks. In the mid-20th century, asbestos was confirmed to be harmful, leading to the halt of production.|$|E

50|$|Glaucophane, <b>crocidolite,</b> riebeckite and arfvedsonite form a {{somewhat}} special group of alkali-amphiboles. The first two are blue fibrous minerals, with glaucophane occurring in blueschists and <b>crocidolite</b> (blue asbestos) in ironstone formations, both resulting from dynamo-metamorphic processes. The latter two are dark green minerals, which occur as original constituents of igneous rocks rich in sodium, such as nepheline-syenite and phonolite.|$|E
50|$|The Australian Blue Asbestos Company {{employed}} 6,500 men and 500 {{women in}} the mining and milling of <b>crocidolite</b> at Wittenoom between 1943 and 1966. This cohort has been traced periodically for vital status and cause of death since 1975. By 1986 there were 85 deaths from pleural and peritoneal mesothelioma. None occurred within ten years of first exposure to <b>crocidolite.</b> A survey of dustiness in the industry conducted in 1966 has provided a basis for estimates of cumulative <b>crocidolite</b> exposure {{of the members of}} the cohort. Exposure-response relationships have been examined. Mesothelioma incidence rates increase exponentially with time since first exposure and also increase with intensity of exposure to <b>crocidolite.</b> Mathematical modelling of the relationship between mesothelioma incidence and intensity of exposure, duration of exposure and time since first exposure results in an estimate of up to 700 cases of mesothelioma in this cohort by the year 2020.|$|E

50|$|Tiger iron is mined {{primarily}} in South Africa and Western Australia. Tiger's eye is composed chiefly of silicon dioxide (SiO2) and is coloured mainly by iron oxide. The specific gravity ranges from 2.64 to 2.71. It is {{formed by the}} alteration of <b>crocidolite.</b>|$|E
50|$|Four of the {{amphibole}} minerals {{are among}} the minerals commonly called asbestos. These are: anthophyllite, riebeckite, cummingtonite/grunerite series, and actinolite/tremolite series. The cummingtonite/grunerite series is often termed amosite or brown asbestos; riebeckite is known as <b>crocidolite</b> or blue asbestos. These are generally called amphibole asbestos.|$|E
50|$|The fibrous {{forms of}} riebeckite {{are known as}} <b>crocidolite</b> and {{are one of the}} six {{recognised}} types of asbestos. Often referred to as blue asbestos, it is considered the most hazardous. In 1964 Dr Christopher Wagner discovered an association between blue asbestos and mesothelioma.|$|E
50|$|The {{mountains}} {{were named}} for the asbestos which was mined in the 20th century and is found as a variety of amphibole called <b>crocidolite.</b> Veins occur in slaty rocks, and are associated with jaspers and quartzites rich in magnetite and brown iron-ore. Geologically {{it belongs to the}} Griquatown series.|$|E
5000|$|Mineral fibers {{include the}} {{asbestos}} group. Asbestos {{is the only}} naturally occurring long mineral fiber. Six minerals have been classified as [...] "asbestos" [...] including chrysotile of the serpentine class and those belonging to the amphibole class: amosite, <b>crocidolite,</b> tremolite, anthophyllite and actinolite. Short, fiber-like minerals include wollastonite and palygorskite.|$|E
50|$|The use of <b>crocidolite</b> (blue) {{asbestos}} {{was banned}} in 1967, while {{the use of}} amosite (brown) asbestos continued {{in the construction industry}} until the mid-1980s. It was finally banned from building products in 1989, though it remained in gaskets and brake linings until 31 December 2003, and cannot be imported, used or recycled.|$|E

Asbestos with particularly fine fibers is also referred to as [...] "amianthus".|$|E
50|$|It {{typically}} forms dark-blue elongated to fibrous crystals {{in highly}} alkali granites, syenites, rarely in felsic volcanics, granite pegmatites and schist. It occurs in banded iron formations as the asbestiform variety <b>crocidolite</b> (blue asbestos). It occurs {{in association with}} aegirine, nepheline, albite, arfvedsonite in igneous rocks; with tremolite, ferro-actinolite in metamorphic rocks; and with grunerite, magnetite, hematite, stilpnomelane, ankerite, siderite, calcite, chalcedonic quartz in iron formations.|$|E
50|$|Between 1948 and 1966, CSR {{operated}} mines at Wittenoom, Western Australia {{that produced}} 161 000 tons of <b>crocidolite</b> fibre. During this time, {{thousands of workers}} and their families, visitors, tourists, consultants and Government officials were exposed to potentially lethal levels of blue asbestos almost a thousand times higher than occupationally regulated at the time. Many of them would develop fatal diseases due to this, such as pleural mesothelioma and lung cancer.|$|E

Amosite and <b>crocidolite</b> are considered the most hazardous asbestos fiber types; however, chrysotile asbestos has also produced tumors in animals and is a recognized cause of asbestosis and malignant mesothelioma in humans, and mesothelioma has been observed in people who were occupationally exposed to chrysotile, {{family members of the}} occupationally exposed, and residents who lived close to asbestos factories and mines.|$|E
5000|$|Asbestiform is {{a crystal}} habit. It {{describes}} a mineral that {{grows in a}} fibrous aggregate of high tensile strength, flexible, long, and thin crystals that readily separate. The most common asbestiform mineral is chrysotile, commonly called [...] "white asbestos", a magnesium phyllosilicate part of the serpentine group. Other asbestiform minerals include riebeckite, an amphibole whose fibrous form is known as <b>crocidolite</b> or [...] "blue asbestos", and brown asbestos, a cummingtonite-grunerite solid solution series.|$|E
50|$|Serious mining of <b>crocidolite</b> {{in these}} {{mountains}} started in 1893 when open-cast quarrying produced 100 tons of material. By 1918 underground mining had started and scattered mines {{were to be}} found from Prieska to Kuruman {{along the length of}} the range, and mills were constructed at both of these towns. Between 1950 and 1960 production had risen to 100,000 tons, each mine was doing its own milling and the tailings dumps had grown in size.|$|E
