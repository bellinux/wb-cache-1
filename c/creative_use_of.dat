25|$|Traditional {{arts are}} based on the <b>creative</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> local and natural materials. The {{tradition}} of silk weaving and lamba production exemplifies this form of art. The weaving of raffia and other local plant materials has been used to create a wide array of practical items such as floor mats, baskets, purses and hats. Wood carving is a highly developed art form, with distinct regional styles evident in the decoration of balcony railings and other architectural elements. Sculptors create a variety of furniture and household goods, aloalo funerary posts, and wooden sculptures, many of which are produced for the tourist market. The decorative and functional woodworking traditions of the Zafimaniry people of the central highlands was inscribed on UNESCO's list of Intangible Cultural Heritage in 2008.|$|E

25|$|Commissioner Safir {{implemented}} a comprehensive Fugitive Strategy and established thirty-nine major anti-drug initiatives {{throughout the city}} including the Northern Manhattan Initiative. He created model blocks in each borough to prevent eradicated drug dealing from returning and he introduced closed circuit television {{to ensure the safety}} of housing development residents, park visitors and subway riders. Concerned for officer and public safety, Safir expanded firearms training and introduced Firearms Training Simulators. Under his leadership, firearms discharge incidents decreased from 344 in 1995 to 155 in 1999. He developed and implemented Operation Condor, a <b>creative</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> personnel resources, that continues to be a centerpiece of current NYPD crime reduction strategy.

25|$|Following {{the end of}} {{his second}} Gubernatorial term, Kean was named President of Drew University, a small liberal arts {{university}} in Madison, New Jersey. Kean's considerable standing as a popular former governor of the state was helpful as he undertook an upgrading of the university's campus and academic programs by stressing the primacy of teaching, the <b>creative</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> technology in the liberal arts, and the importance of international education. During Kean’s presidency, applications to Drew increased by more than 40 percent; the endowment nearly tripled; and more than $60 million was committed to construction of new buildings and renovation of residence halls and other older buildings. Kean was extremely popular among the student body; he would frequently eat lunch unannounced with students in the dining hall, and was a regular spectator at Drew sporting events. Kean served as Drew's President until 2005, teaching a highly selective political science seminar.|$|E
25|$|Stylistically, techno is {{generally}} repetitive instrumental music, often produced {{for use in}} a continuous DJ set. The central rhythmic component is most often in common time (4/4), where time is marked with a bass drum on each quarter note pulse, a backbeat played by snare or clap on the second and fourth pulses of the bar, and an open hi-hat sounding every second eighth note. The tempo tends to vary between approximately 120 to 150 beats per minute (bpm), depending on the style of techno. The <b>creative</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> music production technology, such as drum machines, synthesizers, and digital audio workstations, is viewed as an important aspect of the music's aesthetic. Many producers use retro electronic musical devices to create what they consider to be an authentic techno sound. Drum machines from the 1980s such as Roland's TR-808 and TR-909 are highly prized, and software emulations of such retro technology are popular among techno producers.|$|E

[...] He made <b>creative</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> language with a poetical sense, employing multilingual puns in a fanciful mix of dialects from different ethnic backgrounds. [...] Herriman used metafictional techniques associated with postmodernism; his characters were self-aware, he frequently drew attention to himself and his drawings as drawings in his strips, and he emphasized the subjectivity of language and experience.|$|E

500|$|According to Julien, Sgt. Pepper {{represents}} the [...] "epitome {{of the transformation}} of the recording studio into a compositional tool", marking the moment when [...] "popular music entered the era of phonographic composition." [...] Its lasting commercial success and critical impact are largely due to Martin and his engineers' <b>creative</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> studio equipment while originating new processes. Artistic experimentation, such as the placement of random gibberish in the run-out groove, is one of the album's defining features. In the opinion of the Beatles historian Mark Lewisohn, Sgt. Pepper {{represents the}} group's last unified effort, displaying a cohesion that would begin deteriorating immediately following the album's completion and that had entirely disappeared by the release of The Beatles in 1968. Emerick notes the minimal involvement of Harrison and Starr, viewing Sgt. Pepper as a work of Lennon and McCartney that was less a group effort than any of their previous releases.|$|E
500|$|The song plays over a {{scene in}} the film when the yellow {{submarine}} travels through the Sea of Science, during the Beatles' quest to free Pepperland from the music-hating Blue Meanies. Referring to the psychedelic imagery in the animation, author Stephen Glynn considers that this segment [...] "only 'makes sense' when read as attempting an audio-visual recreation of the hallucinogenic state". Jeremiah Massengale, an academic {{in the field of}} visual communication, highlights the sequence as one of many technical innovations introduced by the 1968 film, saying: [...] "accompanying multi-colored, square portrait paintings of the Beatles during 'Only a Northern Song', there's a <b>creative</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> an oscillator picking out the sound waves of the track." [...] Glynn cites the drug-inspired imagery of this and two other song sequences as the true reason that Rank pulled Yellow Submarine from its UK cinema run, rather than the company's official reasoning that the film had performed poorly at the box office.|$|E

Columnist Ryō Koarai commended Charlotte for pulling in the viewer from the first episode due to Yuu's surprising, unorthodox personality in contrast with how he uses his superhuman ability in his everyday life. Writer Seiji Nakazawa lauded Charlotte for defying the [...] "moe anime" [...] stereotype at first glance and for instead being {{what he describes as}} a [...] "human drama". He notes that Charlotte is written {{in much the same way}} as Maeda's previous works by inserting jokes between serious moments to offer some relief to the viewer.

40|$|This {{interdisciplinary}} {{scoping study}} critically discusses {{the relationship between}} communities and their <b>creative</b> <b>uses</b> <b>of</b> digital technologies: the nature <b>of</b> this <b>use,</b> {{its impact on the}} formation and sustenance of communities, and the potential this holds for social change. We start by providing brief working definitions of creativity, digital technologies and community as understood in this study, while drawing attention to the ways that technologies have helped shape communities and societies since the nineteenth century. Further, we discuss the interconnection between design, <b>creative</b> <b>uses</b> <b>of</b> technology and community empowerment, underlining the potential of digital tools for communities that are not inherent to the technology but embedded by design and realised through use. We then highlight how the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> digital technologies have helped redefine the nature, organisation and identity of communities, as well as enabled the emergence of community types. We problematize these implications in relation to space, social bonds and everyday life, as well as present current forms of enabled collective actions aimed at social change. Finally, we provide recommendations for future research based on themes of community empowerment, digital literacy, open information sharing, technology design and cultural expressions that have emerged from this study...|$|R

500|$|Portal {{consists}} {{primarily of}} a series of puzzles that must be solved by teleporting the player's character and simple objects using [...] "the Aperture Science Handheld Portal Device", a device that can create inter-spatial portals between two flat planes. The player-character, Chell, is challenged and taunted by an artificial intelligence named GLaDOS (Genetic Lifeform and Disk Operating System) to complete each puzzle in the Aperture Science Enrichment Center using the portal gun with the promise of receiving cake when all the puzzles are completed. The game's unique physics allows momentum to be retained through portals, requiring <b>creative</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> portals to maneuver through the test chambers. This gameplay element is based on a similar concept from the game Narbacular Drop; many of the team members from the DigiPen Institute of Technology who worked on Narbacular Drop were hired by Valve for the creation of Portal, making it a spiritual successor to the game.|$|E

Elizabeth Sweedyk, associate computer science professor at Harvey Mudd College, called Donkey Kong Jr. Math a realistic educational video game, criticizing such games as [...] "not fun." [...] 1UP.coms Kevin Gifford called it a game that children {{would never want to}} play. Fellow 1UP.com writer Jeremy Parish commented that the game shouldn't be judged on being an educational game, citing quality educational titles as The Oregon Trail and Where in the World Is Carmen Sandiego?. However, he noted that it should be judged for being a boring game. Ars Technica's Frank Caron compared it to other educational games, calling it [...] "no Brain Age" [...] and preferring to play Math Blaster instead. Educational video game developer Traci Lawson wondered whether the word game Bookworm would have been as well received by players when they were children; she felt that they would be intimidated by it, comparing this to how she felt when she played Donkey Kong Jr. Math. In contrast to the negative reception, Allgame's Skyler Miller called it a <b>creative</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> Donkey Kong Jr.s graphics and gameplay.|$|E
