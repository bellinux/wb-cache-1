There {{are a number of}} reasons affected by the software project failures. According to empirical evidence, inadequate testing resources are one of the major factors that contribute to the poor quality. The main objectives of this study are to study the risk factors that affect the software quality to provide some recommendation to minimize the risk of poor quality. There are three main factors affecting to software quality namely proper testing, test planning and QA team which are directly impacted to the software quality risks. To conduct this study, I employed an open-ended questionnaire for collecting qualitative data from responses analyzed them using thematic approach method. The participants with their experiences agreed only with requirement clarity and clearly defined acceptance criteria, not with adequate unit testing and finally and also with that not doing regression testing force to quality failures. As of data analysis, not having proper formal test planning, initial test planning not being realistic, not following quality risk management, non-proper process and <b>contingency</b> <b>action</b> <b>planning</b> also lead to the risk of poor project quality.

40|$|Oral rabies {{vaccination}} (ORV) targeting specific wild Carnivora {{species has}} emerged as an integral adjunct to conventional rabies control strategies to protect humans and domestic animals. ORV has been applied with progress toward eliminating rabies in red foxes (Vulpes vulpes) in western Europe and southern Ontario, Canada. Beginning in the 1990 ’s, coordinated ORV was implemented in Texas to contain and eliminate variants of rabies virus in the gray fox (Urocyon cinereoargenteus) and coyote (Canis latrans) and in several eastern U. S. States {{with the goal of}} preventing spread of raccoon (Procyon lotor) rabies. The primary components of the control strategy include: enhanced rabies surveillance, coordinated ORV, use of natural barriers to bolster ORV, and <b>contingency</b> <b>actions</b> to treat emerging foci. The National Rabies Management Program, which is a cooperative program that began in 1997, has progressively grown to meet rabies control needs and currently includes ORV in 16 eastern states and Texas and Arizona. Annually, approximately 11 million baits are distributed over about 200, 000 km 2 in strategic locations to contain and eliminate variants of the rabies virus in coyotes, gray foxes and raccoons. Canine rabies in coyotes has been eliminated from Texas and a maintenance ORV barrier created along the Rio Grande in Texas has been challenged in 2001 and 2004, underscoring its importance in preventing re-infection with canine strain of rabies from Mexico. Hotspots in or near ORV zones targeting gray fox rabies, as well as breaches in ORV zones focused on raccoon rabies in Ohio and Massachusetts (Cape Cod) continue to be treated to restore the integrity of original ORV efforts. Development of new or improved oral rabies vaccines and baits that are also effective in vaccinating striped skunks (Mephitis mephitis) are among several key challenges facing the program. Skunks appear to help maintain the raccoon variant and serve to re-infect areas (Guerra et al. 2003), potentially confounding our ability to achieve long-term rabies management goals with currently available tools. A more comprehensive discussion of the current status of ORV in the U. S., including advances in enhanced rabies surveillance, application of <b>contingency</b> <b>action</b> <b>plans,</b> and research and management initiatives to address challenges facing rabies control in terrestrial wildlife nationally is provided by Slate et al.

40|$|Abstract Background In {{order to}} improve the {{transition}} from an intention {{to a change in}} health behaviour, <b>action</b> <b>planning</b> is a frequently used behavioural change method. The quality of <b>action</b> <b>plans</b> in terms of instrumentality and specificity is important in terms of supporting a successful change in health behaviour. Until now, little has been known about the predictors of <b>action</b> <b>plan</b> generation and the predictors of high quality <b>action</b> <b>plans</b> and, therefore, the current study investigates these predictors. Method A randomised controlled trial was conducted to improve physical activity (PA) and fruit and vegetable (FV) consumption using a web-based computer tailored intervention. During the 8 -week intervention period, participants in the intervention arm (n[*]=[*] 346) were guided (step-by-step) to generate their own <b>action</b> <b>plans</b> to improve their health behaviours. Demographic characteristics, social cognitions, and health behaviour were assessed at baseline by means of self-reporting. Whether participants generated <b>action</b> <b>plans</b> was tracked by means of server registrations within two modules of the intervention. Results The <b>action</b> <b>planning</b> component of the intervention regarding physical activity and fruit and vegetable consumption was used by 40. 9 and 20. 7  % of the participants, respectively. We found that participants who were physically active at baseline were less likely to generate <b>action</b> <b>plans</b> concerning physical activity. With regards to generating fruit and vegetable <b>action</b> <b>plans,</b> participants with a high risk perception and a strong intention to eat fruit and vegetables on a daily basis made more use of the <b>action</b> <b>planning</b> component for this behaviour. Finally, the large majority of the <b>action</b> <b>plans</b> for physical activity (96. 6  %) and fruit and vegetable consumption (100  %) were instrumental and about half of the <b>action</b> <b>plans</b> were found to be highly specific (PA[*]=[*] 69. 6  %/FV[*]=[*] 59. 7  %). The specificity of the <b>action</b> <b>plans</b> is associated with having a relationship and low levels of negative outcome expectancies. Conclusion Risk perception and intention are predictors of using the application of <b>action</b> <b>planning.</b> Increasing the motivation to change behaviour should be prioritised in interventions concerning changes in health behaviour before participants are asked to generate <b>action</b> <b>plans.</b> This would also make the intervention suitable for unmotivated people. For those participants who already perform the desired health behaviour prior to the intervention, <b>action</b> <b>plans</b> might be less relevant. Nevertheless, using a guided step-by-step approach to generate <b>action</b> <b>plans</b> resulted in highly instrumental and specific <b>action</b> <b>plans</b> and might be integrated into other interventions concerning changes in health behaviour.
