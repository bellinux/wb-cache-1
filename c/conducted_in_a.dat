5|$|Bauer met {{fellow student}} Ester Ellqvist at the Royal Swedish Academy of Arts. Ellqvist {{studied at the}} {{separate}} department for women, since women {{were not allowed to}} attend the same classes as the men and their education was <b>conducted</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> different manner. So, while Ellqvist was talented and ambitious, she did not have an equal opportunity as her male colleagues to develop her artistry.|$|E
5|$|Pitched battles were <b>conducted</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> similar fashion: the velites {{would gather}} at the front and fling {{javelins}} to cover the advance of the hastati. If the hastati failed to break the enemy, they would fall back on the principes, who along with the hastati, had been re-equipped with pila rather than spears. If the principes could not break the enemy they would retire behind the triarii, who would then engage the enemy.|$|E
5|$|Arsenal {{scored the}} game's only {{goal in the}} 24th minute; set-up by Walcott, Oxlade-Chamberlain managed to cut inside César Azpilicueta {{on the right and}} shoot the ball into the top-left corner of Courtois's net. It was the first goal Chelsea had conceded against Arsenal in 506 minutes. Most of the action in the first half was <b>conducted</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> {{congested}} midfield, with Fàbregas attempting to sedate the rhythm and the Arsenal midfielders forcing their opponents to play narrow. This favoured Arsenal, who had space to counter-attack had Chelsea lost the ball. Ramires nearly levelled the scoreline in the 33rd minute, but his curling effort failed to creep into the bottom right-hand corner. Ramires then missed another chance, heading the ball high and over the Arsenal goal after good work by Rémy. Arsenal created another chance to score four minutes before the break, when Oxlade-Chamberlain's cross found Monreal, who under pressure from Ivanovic headed over. Rémy, often a lone figure upfront, was ruled offside late on.|$|E

5|$|By October 1797, {{the plan}} to attack Ireland had been {{abandoned}} and the British North Sea Fleet was again at full strength. During a brief period replenishing supplies at Yarmouth, news reached Duncan on 10 October that the Dutch had sailed on a raiding cruise and {{he returned to the}} Dutch coast, intercepting de Winter's fleet on its way back to the Texel. The Dutch formed a line of battle in shallow coastal waters to meet Duncan's attack, which was <b>conducted</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> confused mass, the British fleet separating into two groups that struck the vanguard and rear of the Dutch fleet, overwhelming each in turn and capturing eleven ships, including de Winter's flagship Vrijheid. On the return journey, three of the captured ships were lost, and none of the surviving Dutch prizes was ever suitable for active service again. Both sides suffered heavy casualties during the battle as each fleet had been trained to aim at the hulls of their opponents, maximising the damage to personnel.|$|E
5|$|During that time, Shapiro {{instructed}} ex-captive orangutans in {{the acquisition}} {{and use of}} signs following the techniques of psychologists R. Allen Gardner and Beatrix Gardner, who taught the chimpanzee, Washoe, in the late 1960s. In the only signing study ever <b>conducted</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> great ape's natural environment, Shapiro home-reared Princess, a juvenile female, which learned nearly 40 signs (according to the criteria of sign acquisition used by psychologist Francine Patterson with Koko, the gorilla) and trained Rinnie, a free-ranging adult female orangutan, which learned nearly 30 signs over a two-year period. For his dissertation study, Shapiro examined the factors influencing sign learning by four juvenile orangutans over a 15-month period.|$|E
5|$|Fish are {{the primary}} {{component}} of the river otter's diet throughout the year. Every study done on the food habits of the river otter has identified varying fish species as being the primary component of its diet. For instance, an Alberta, Canada study involved the collection and analysis of 1,191 samples of river otter scats collected during each season. Fish remnants were found present in 91.9% of the scat samples. Moreover, a western Oregon study revealed fish remains were present in 80% of the 103 digestive tracts examined. Crustaceans (crayfish), where regionally available, are the second-most important prey for otters. Crustaceans may even be consumed more than fish. For example, a study <b>conducted</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> central California marshland indicated crayfish formed nearly 100% of the river otter's diet at certain times of the year. However, river otters, as foragers, will immediately take advantage of other prey when readily obtainable. Other prey consumed by river otters includes fruits, reptiles, amphibians, birds (most especially moulting ducks which render the birds flightless and thus makes them easier to capture), aquatic insects, small mammals, and mollusks.|$|E

When Nagaraju blames Krishnadevaraya for sending a palanquin to her house for Rani Vasam, Krishnadevaraya defends his action and reminds Nagaraju that {{it was he who}} had asked him to send Malliswari to Rani Vasam.

5|$|On 7 May, {{a second}} {{operation}} {{was conducted by}} the same units, {{this time in the}} northern Armenian town of Voskepar. Under the same pretext as the previous operation, the joint forces entered Armenia with tanks and other armored vehicles, claiming that militia units were staging attacks from that area into Azerbaijan. The operation was <b>conducted</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> similar manner but with deadlier results. In addition to the arbitrary arrests of twenty men in towns surrounding Voskepar, a bus carrying thirty Armenian policemen was attacked by elements of the 23rd Division, killing eleven of the officers and arresting the rest. The OMON units also took part in razing and looting the outlying villages around Voskepar. Residents were similarly forced to leave their homes and thus ceded them after signing a form which stated that they were leaving their homes at their own volition.|$|E

This led to impromptu collaborations and a distinctive sound that is featured on the three albums. Frequent visits to the studio were made by fellow neo soul and hip hop recording artists associated with the Soulquarians collective such as Erykah Badu, Q-Tip, Talib Kweli, James Poyser, and Mos Def. Voodoos sessions also had visitors not associated with the project, including record producer Rick Rubin, comedian Chris Rock, and rock musician Eric Clapton. D'Angelo previewed songs for them, which they found impressive.|$|E
5|$|The Field Museum of Natural History (FMNH) also {{conducted}} excavations {{south of the}} town of Emery from 2009 to 2010, with permits from the Utah Geological Survey. These excavations were <b>conducted</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> site discovered by Akiko Shinya in 2008, FMNH locality UT080821-1, which has been named Akiko's Site in her honor. During the excavations, 167 disarticulated but closely associated elements were collected in two plaster jackets. One of these plaster jackets, containing elements from the hip and vertebrae, was given the specimen number FMNH PR 3847; the specimen was subsequently described by McDonald along with Terry Gates, Lindsay Zanno, and Peter Makovicky in 2017. Another locality discovered by the FMNH is the Triple Peak quarry, FMNH locality UT130904-2, which contains a bonebed of over 400 juvenile bones that belong to at least four individuals.|$|E

5|$|All {{members of}} the SASR are {{parachute}} qualified, and each member of a patrol {{has at least one}} specialisation, including medic, signaller, explosive expert or linguist. Counter terrorist training includes close quarters battle (CQB), explosive entry, tubular assault (in vehicles such as in buses, trains and aircraft) and in high rise buildings, as well as room and building clearance. This training is <b>conducted</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> range of advanced facilities, including electronic indoor and outdoor CQB ranges, outdoor sniper range, and urban training facilities at Swanbourne. Additional facilities include a special urban complex, vertical plunging range, method of entry house, and simulated oil rig and aircraft mock-ups in order to provide realistic training environments for potential operational scenarios. Free-Fall training includes High Altitude Parachute Operations (HAPO) either High Altitude Low Opening (HALO) or High Altitude High Opening (HAHO) conducted at a maximum of 25,000 feet. SASR personnel also provide training in weapons handling to ASIS operatives at Swan Island in Victoria. Despite a possible reduction in rank, SASR operators receive significant allowances, which make them among the highest-paid soldiers in the Australian Defence Force, with a trooper (equivalent to a private) reportedly earning about $100,000 per annum in 2006.|$|E
