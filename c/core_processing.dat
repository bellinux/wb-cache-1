50|$|With {{multi-core}} processors, additional performance {{improvements in}} interrupt handling {{can be achieved}} through receive-side scaling (RSS) when multiqueue NICs are used. Such NICs provide multiple receive queues associated to separate interrupts; by routing each of those interrupts to different <b>cores,</b> <b>processing</b> of the interrupt requests triggered by the network traffic received by a single NIC can be distributed among multiple cores. Distribution of the interrupts among cores can be performed automatically by the operating system, or the routing of interrupts (usually referred to as IRQ affinity) can be manually configured.|$|R

30|$|Two {{different}} mapping {{approaches are}} proposed in [18], {{but they do}} not allow task migration, i.e. once a task is assigned to a <b>processing</b> <b>core,</b> it remains there until its computation is finished.

30|$|We observe from Figure 3 {{that the}} {{performance}} of the proposed algorithm with up to eight <b>processing</b> <b>cores</b> reached nearly ideal speedup for the three largest image sizes. From ten <b>processing</b> <b>cores</b> and up, the computation for smaller images, 50 × 50 and 100 × 100, had a reduced speedup, probably due to the overhead of creation of threads only to process a limited amount of data. On the other hand, for images larger than 200 × 200, the speedups obtained by increasing the amount of <b>processing</b> <b>cores</b> were ever increasing. However, for 50 × 50 image size, {{we were not able to}} get linear speedup.|$|R
40|$|Submitted {{for review}} to MICRO- 40 conference the 9 th of June 2007 This paper {{introduces}} an advanced hardware based approach for accelerating Software Transactional Memory (STM). The proposed solution focuses on speeding up conflict detection that grows polynomially {{with the number}} of concurrently running transactions and shared to transaction-local address resolution, which is the most frequent STM operation. This is achieved by logic split in two hardware units: Transaction <b>Processing</b> <b>Core</b> and Transactional Memory Look-Aside Buffer. The Transaction <b>Processing</b> <b>Core</b> is a separate hardware unit which does eager conflict detection and address resolution by indexing transactional objects based on their virtual addresses. The Transactional Memory Look-aside Buffer is a per-processor extension that caches the translated addresses by the Transaction <b>Processing</b> <b>Core.</b> The effect of its function is a reduced bus traffic and the time spent for communication between the CPUs and the Transaction <b>Processing</b> <b>Core.</b> Compared with other existing solutions, our approach mainly differs in proposing an implementation that is not based on the processor cache but a separate on-chip core, uses virtual addresses, does not require application modification and is further enhanced by Transactional Memory Look-Aside Buffer. Our experiments confirm the potential of the Transaction <b>Processing</b> <b>Core</b> to dramatically speed up STM systems. Postprint (published version...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{we study}} {{the impact of}} {{application}} task mapping on the reliability of multiprocessor system-on-chip (MPSoC) application {{in the presence of}} soft errors. Based on this study, we propose a novel system-level design optimization of an MPSoC application through joint power minimization and reliability improvement. The power minimization is carried out using voltage scaling technique, while reliability improvement is achieved through careful choice of application task mapping on the homogeneous MPSoC <b>processing</b> <b>cores.</b> The overall aim is to minimize the number of single-event upsets (SEUs) experienced by the MPSoC application for suitably identified voltage scaling of the system <b>processing</b> <b>cores</b> such that the power is reduced and the specified real-time constraint is met. We evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed design optimization using a number of different applications, including MPEG- 2 video decoder and synthetic applications. We show that for an MPEG- 2 decoder with four <b>processing</b> <b>cores,</b> the proposed soft error-aware optimization produces a design with 38 % less SEUs than soft error-unaware design optimization for an arbitrary soft error rate of 10 ? 9, while consuming 9 % less power and meeting a given real-time constraint. Furthermore, we investigate the impact of architecture allocation (allocation of <b>processing</b> <b>cores)</b> and show that for an MPSoC with six <b>processing</b> <b>cores</b> and a given real-time constraint, the proposed optimization produces design with up to 7 % less SEUs compared to soft error-unaware designs at the cost of 5. 5 % higher power...|$|R

50|$|It is {{produced}} by inserting a 'target' rod rich in non-radioactive cobalt-59 into a reactor core where free neutrons will be captured, turning cobalt-59 into cobalt-60. After retrieval from the <b>core,</b> <b>processing</b> can extract the cobalt-60 for manufacture into a useful radiation source. The {{vast majority of the}} world's cobalt-60 supply - over 80% - has traditionally come from Canada's National Research Universal (NRU) reactor at Chalk River. In general, the supply situation for medical and industrial isotopes is shaky thanks to a reliance on this kind of aging research reactor.
