2500|$|Another tax issue {{arose in}} 2007. The parents of several Montana {{schoolchildren}} {{filed suit in}} the United States District Court for the District of Montana against PPL Montana. The parents argued that all riverbeds in Montana are owned by the state, are held in trust {{for the benefit of}} all the people, and that such riverbeds constitute a portion of state lands which must be taxed or leased to provide support for public schools. The plaintiffs argued that PPL Montana and its predecessor, Montana Power, only leased these riverbeds from the state and did not own them. The parents sued to force PPL to pay rent due. (At no time in the past had the state sought rental income from Montana Power, and no payments by Montana Power or PPL Montana had ever been made.) Although the federal suit was dismissed for lack of a federal issue, PPL Montana filed suit in Montana's First Judicial District Court seeking a declaratory judgment in its favor, arguing that the Federal Power Act preempts the parents' suit and denies states the power to make companies pay for the use of riverbeds. The state district court held against PPL's request for summary judgment on all counts. The two parties then went to trial, which lasted from October 22 to October 30, 2007. On June 13, 2008, the state district court ruled in favor of the state (although it denied the state's request for interest on the rent due). PPL Montana appealed to the Montana State Supreme Court. [...] On March 30, 2010, the Montana State Supreme Court held (5-to-2) that the state district court had not erred in its rulings on various issues of summary judgment, that riverbeds were state public trust lands (but not school trust lands) under the Montana Constitution, and that the district court's <b>calculation</b> <b>of</b> <b>payments</b> due was appropriate. PPL Montana, appealed to the Supreme Court of the United States, and in November 2010 the Supreme Court asked the United States Solicitor General for the views of the federal government. Finally, on February 22, 2012, the U.S. Supreme Court held in PPL Montana v. Montana (No. 10–218, dec. February 22, 2012) that the Montana Supreme Court had erred in finding all of the riverbeds beneath all PPL Montana dams navigable. [...] The unanimous U.S. Supreme Court held that the correct test is whether the portion of the riverbed under each specific dam (not the entire river, nor even a large or small portion of a river) was navigable at the time of statehood. [...] If it was, then the riverbed is [...] "navigable" [...] and may be taxed. [...] The case was remanded back to the state supreme court for further hearings.|$|E

It is used to inform decisions on dietary requirements to optimize growth, in gilts to promote longevity and finally {{to assist in the}} <b>calculation</b> <b>of</b> <b>payments</b> to producers that allow for general adiposity. Currently for reasons of tradition and ease, total adipose thickness measurements are made at one or multiple sites although it has been long recognized that up to three well defined layers (outer (L 1), middle (L 2), and inner (L 3)) may be present to make up the total. Various features and properties of these layers have been described. This paper examines the contribution of each layer to total adipose thickness at three time points and describes the change in {{thickness of}} each layer per unit change in body weight in normal growing pigs. Methods A group of nine pigs was examined using 14 MHz linear array transducer on three separate occasions. The average weight was 51, 94 and 124 kg for each successive scan. The time between scanning was approximately 4 weeks. The proportion of each layer to total thickness was modeled statistically with scan session as a variable and the change in absolute thickness of each layer per unit change in body weight was modeled in a random regression model. Results There was a significant change in ratios between scans for the middle and inner layers (P Conclusion These results demonstrate that subcutaneous adipose layers grow at different rates relative {{to each other and to}} change in body weight and indicate that ultrasound can be used to track these differences. </p...|$|E
40|$|Abstract {{copyright}} ADRN {{and data}} collection copyright owner. The Tax Credit Claimants dataset provides information {{about the number of}} families that receive Working Tax credit (for people who are working and on a low income) and Child Tax credit (for people that are responsible for children) in the UK. The dataset provides information on household composition, level of entitlement and employment status of the household. Additionally, the data provides information on families who benefit from help with their child care costs. Information is taken from application, renewal packs and change of circumstances sent to HMRC. The current tax credit system was introduced in April 2003 when the existing tax credits (Working Families’ Tax Credit, Disabled Person’s Tax Credit and Children’s Tax Credit) were replaced with Working Tax Credit and Child Tax Credit. The actual Tax Credit Claimants dataset contains data from its introduction in 2003 onwards. The Tax Credits dataset provides a snapshot of claims paid in each quarter. Aggregate data&# 160;are published twice a year in April and December and are available from the HMRC website. The dataset holds information relating to claims in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. The dataset can be geographically referenced to the lower layer super output area. To {{give you an idea of}} the size of dataset, in 2008 / 09 more than 6 million families containing 10 million children were receiving tax credits. These included 455, 000 tax credit recipients without children. Working Tax and Child Tax Credits are available for the majority of households in the UK. The amount of entitlement depends upon a range of factors including&# 58; how many children you have living with you; whether you work – and how many hours you work; if you pay for childcare; if you or any child living with you has a disability; if you’re aged 50 plus and are coming off benefits; and income levels. Those eligible for a tax credit receive either a full or partial amount depending on their income levels. Please note that this dataset does not include records of people who are eligible for tax credits but choose not to claim them, not does it include records of those who are ineligible or who make an unsuccessful claim. Quarterly datasets are available showing a snapshot of claims at particular dates, along with an annual dataset showing the average number of claims over the year and their entitlement. Published counts of Tax Credits data at small area level are rounded so the published total number of claimants in a larger area may possibly not match the summed totals from data tables produced at smaller geography. The Tax Credit dataset geographical areas are calculated using the postcode and address information reported on the claim. Accurate linking using the National Insurance Number, Child Benefit Number, or names and addresses can then occur. Most HMRC data do contain names and addresses. If the data were released to researchers in the future HMRC would need to consider the detail released to ensure the dataset was not disclosive. Variables within the dataset may be subject to statistical disclosure control techniques to prevent disclosure and confidentiality breaches. The dataset is considered to be of a very high quality. It is a full record of all claimants in any one year. Information is taken from application or renewals for the Working Tax and Child Tax Credits, so is not subject to a sampling error. &# 160; Anyone attempting to defraud the system is liable to prosecution and so is a deterrent for false claims. The HMRC also carry out a number of standard checks to ensure overall quality of the data. Before conducting any research it is recommended that you gain an understanding of both Working Tax and Child Tax Credits as both the eligibility criteria and the <b>calculation</b> <b>of</b> <b>payments</b> are complex. If you are considering time series research please consider how changes in the eligibility criteria over time could impact upon the data and your findings. Generally, the take up of tax credits is relatively high; however, in areas with low levels of take-up of tax credits, the data may not adequately represent the eligible population. Research Usage and Linkage The Tax Credits dataset has a wide variety of research uses. It can provide an insight into income levels of a geographical area and more specifically provide information on&# 58; The analysis of the number of low and middle income families by geographical area; The number of children living in low or middle income families in a geographical area; The number of lone-parents (and children living in lone-parent household) in a geographical area. The data has also been used in other specific circumstances, such as the creation of the Indices of Deprivation by Communities and Local Government. The research team involved was not allowed direct access to the data though. Instead, they wrote code in SAS and sent this to HMRC. There, staff reviewed and revised it in discussion with the research team, and finally produced the small area level counts needed to meet the specification of the project. In total, the process took 14 months from initial discussions to receipt of data by the research team. The Tax Claimants dataset is linked by the HMRC with other datasets that they hold, including the Child Benefit dataset. It is linked using either the National Insurance number or Tax Credit address to enable in depth analysis of families income. The dataset is also linked to Department for Work and Pensions Longitudinal Study which combines benefits, income and employment data. </div...|$|E

The <b>calculations</b> <b>of</b> direct <b>payment</b> rates and the distribution <b>of</b> these <b>payments</b> were based on the database of the Hungarian Agricultural and Rural Development Agency for 2011, and the moving averages of the descriptive parameters of farms were obtained from the Farm Accountancy Data Network. To assess the structural impacts an agent-based simulation model was developed. Decisions were modelled at the micro-level and macro-outcomes were modelled as the consequences of these micro-level decisions. From an economic point of view, the Redistributive Payment would have no real advantage over the capping <b>of</b> direct <b>payments</b> in Hungary as the Redistributive Payment would benefit only farms of relatively small size and would shift funding away from even mid-sized family farms in Hungary.

40|$|Abstract — This paper {{presents}} a decentralized negotiation protocol for cooperative economic scheduling in {{a supply chain}} environment. For this purpose we designed autonomous agents that maximize their profits by optimizing their local schedule and offer side payments to compensate other agents for lost profit or extra expense if cumulative profit is achievable. To further increase their income the agents have to apply a randomized local search heuristic to prevent the negotiation from stopping in locally optimal contracts. We show that the welfare could be increased by using a search strategy similar to Simulated Annealing. Unfortunately, a naïve application of this strategy makes the agents vulnerable to exploitation by untruthful partners. We develop and test a straightforward mechanism based on trust accounts to protect the agents against systematic exploitation. This “Trusted ” Simulated Annealing mechanism assures truthful revelation of the individual opportunity cost situation {{as the basis for}} the <b>calculation</b> <b>of</b> side <b>payments.</b> I...|$|R

A mortgage is a form of annuity (from the perspective of the lender), and the <b>calculation</b> <b>of</b> the periodic <b>payments</b> is based on the time value of money formulas. Certain details may be specific to different locations: interest may be calculated {{on the basis of a}} 360-day year, for example; interest may be compounded daily, yearly, or semi-annually; prepayment penalties may apply; and other factors. There may be legal restrictions on certain matters, and consumer protection laws may specify or prohibit certain practices.|$|R
