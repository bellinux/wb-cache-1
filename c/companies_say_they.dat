5000|$|Founded in 2010 by Carlos Hernandez and Andrey Yruski, Chiching.com, the San Francisco company, {{recently}} (June 2013) {{created a}} transparent NYOP model that allows buyers {{to select the}} businesses {{that they want to}} buy from as well as the pricing and value that they want to ask for. This new model is dynamic. A customer creates an offer and sends it to the businesses they select. The first business to accept the offer will accept the discounted voucher as payment toward the total bill. This is a highly dynamic model that gives businesses the ability to only accept offers that are profitable and timely. After the bidding, if no dealer has accepted the user's price, the user receives nothing. If a businesses has accepted the offer's discount terms, the customer must use their voucher during the business hours that were specified on the voucher. This transparent use of NYOP system helps establish goodwill in the marketplace and educated consumers what types of deals are reasonable.There are also a number of relatively new services that are offering [...] "Name your price" [...] to their customers.

It would be prudent to strengthen our safety net and labor market to absorb a shock from autonomous-vehicle technology, as well as ensure that autonomous-vehicle technology is safe and reliable. This will be a challenge, given the recent change in the party controlling the executive branch, and its new secretary of transportation. Strengthening the unemployment insurance system, improving apprenticeship programs, making higher education more affordable, and committing to full employment can not only minimize the harm to displaced workers, but can provide them with opportunities that lead to fulfilling and economically sustaining jobs. This is good policy whether or not autonomous vehicles are around the corner...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{analyzes}} {{the relationship between}} Swedish video game companies and the institutions for Archive, Libraries and Museums (ALM). The aim is to further the discussion regarding preservation of digital games. The thesis is based on semi-structured interviews with four video game companies and three institutions; an archive, a library and a museum. The theoretical foundation resides within practice theory, {{with the assumption that}} a practice is a combination of what people do and what they say. By analyzing what video game <b>companies</b> <b>say</b> <b>they</b> do the authors ascertain which methods of preservation is currently. The analysis is a cross-examination of the seven interviews with the result indicating that while video game companies are interested in the preservation of digital games they do not participate actively in the discussion on the best method of doing so. Communica- tion between video game companies and ALM institutions has room for improvement, as it is virtually non- existent. Furthermore, the findings indicate different motivations for preserving games and it is unclear which perspective the preservation should have; a technical perspective, cultural perspective or for the company’s bene- fit. In conclusion the current situation is that ALM institutions preserve games with a cultural and/or a technical perspective while game companies preserve their games for the company’s benefit. ...|$|E
40|$|Between one-third and {{one-half}} of employees participate directly in company performance through profit sharing, gainsharing, employee ownership, or stock options. This {{flies in the}} face of concerns about the free rider problem and worker risk aversion in group incentives, and raises many questions about the effects on firms and workers. This paper lays out the major reasons we may see such "shared capitalism" plans, and reviews recent nationally representative surveys on the prevalence of these plans. We also introduce the NBER shared capitalism data, based on questions added to the 2002 and 2006 General Social Surveys (GSS) and more than 40, 000 employee surveys from 14 companies with different combinations of shared capitalism plans. We find that while shared capitalism exists broadly throughout the economy, it is more likely in larger establishments. The free rider effect may be countered by the use of other policies to create productive teamwork and a cooperative culture: shared capitalism is positively linked to workplace decision-making, training, job security, teamwork, the ability to easily observe co-worker performance, and low levels of supervision. Also, more risk-averse employees avoid participating in several types of shared capitalism, but two-thirds of even the most risk-averse employees in these <b>companies</b> <b>say</b> <b>they</b> want shared capitalism as part of their pay package. The effects of these plans for both workers and firms are more fully explored in accompanying papers. ...|$|E

40|$|Testimony {{issued by}} the Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "As consumer debt has risen to historic levels, {{a growing number of}} for-profit debt settlement companies have emerged. These <b>companies</b> <b>say</b> <b>they</b> will negotiate with consumers' creditors to accept a lump sum settlement for 40 to 60 cents on the dollar for amounts owed on credit cards and other unsecured debt. However, there have been allegations that some debt settlement companies engage in fraudulent, abusive, or deceptive practices that leave consumers in worse financial condition. For example, it has been alleged that they commonly charge fees in advance of settling debts or without providing any services at all, a practice on which the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) recently announced a proposed ban due to its harm to consumers. The Committee asked for an investigation of these issues. As a result, GAO attempted to (1) determine through covert testing whether these allegations are accurate; and, if so, (2) determine whether they are widespread, citing specific closed cases. To achieve these objectives, GAO conducted covert testing by calling 20 companies while posing as fictitious consumers; made overt, unannounced site visits to several companies called; interviewed industry stakeholders; and reviewed information on federal and state legal actions. GAO did not use the services of the companies it called or attempt to verify the facts regarding all of the allegations it found. ...|$|E
40|$|Introduction Canadians, {{and many}} people around the world, are {{increasingly}} purchasing, and using, electronic devices meant to capture and record the relative levels of a person’s fitness. Unlike past fitness devices, such as pedometers, electronic fitness trackers are designed to display aggregate fitness information automatically on mobile devices and, frequently, on websites developed and controlled by the company that makes the given device. This automatic collection and dissemination of fitness data began with simply monitoring the steps a person had taken in a day. Contemporary consumer fitness wearables collect {{a broad range of}} data. The number of floors, or altitudinal changes, a person climbs a day is measured, levels and deepness of sleep, and heart rate activity are all captured by best-of-class consumer-level fitness trackers. And all of this data is of interest to the wearers of the devices, to companies interested in mining and selling collected fitness data, to insurance companies, to authorities and courts of law, and even potentially to criminals motivated to steal or access data retained by fitness companies. This report explores what information is collected by the companies which develop and sell {{some of the most popular}} wearables in North America. Moreover, it explores whether there are differences between the information that is collected by the devices and what <b>companies</b> <b>say</b> <b>they</b> collect, and what they subsequently provide to consumers when compelled to disclose all the personal information that companies hold about residents of Canada. In short, the project asks: 	Were data which are technically collected noted in companies’ privacy policies and terms of service and, if so, what protections or assurances do individuals have concerning the privacy or security of that data? 	What of that data is classified by the company as ‘personal’ data, which is tested by issuing legally compelling requests for the company to disclose all the personal data held on a requesting individual? 	Does the information received by the individual match what a company asserts is ‘personally identifiable information’ in their terms of service or privacy policies...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this paper is to focus on {{investigating}} and benchmarking green operations initiatives in the automotive industry documented in the environmental reports of selected companies. The investigation roadmaps the main environmental initiatives taken by the world's three major car manufacturers and benchmarks them against each other. The categorisation of green operations initiatives that is provided in the paper can also help companies in other sectors to evaluate their green practices. Design/methodology/approach: The first part of the paper is based on existing literature on the topic of green and sustainable operations and the "unsustainable" context of automotive production. The second part relates to the roadmap and benchmarking of green operations initiatives based on an analysis of secondary data from the automotive industry. Findings: The findings show that the world's three major car manufacturers are pursuing various environmental initiatives involving the following green operations practices: green buildings, eco-design, green supply chains, green manufacturing, reverse logistics and innovation. Research limitations/implications: The limitations of this paper start from its selection of the companies, which was made using production volume and country of origin as the principal criteria. There is ample evidence that other, smaller, companies are pursuing more sophisticated and original environmental initiatives. Also, there might be a gap between what <b>companies</b> <b>say</b> <b>they</b> do in their environmental reports and what they actually do. Practical implications: This paper helps practitioners in the automotive industry to benchmark themselves against the major volume manufacturers in three different continents. Practitioners from other industries will also find it valuable to discover how the automotive industry is pursuing environmental initiatives beyond manufacturing, apart from the green operations practices covering broadly all the activities of operations function. Originality/value: The originality of the paper is in its up-to-date analysis of environmental reports of automotive companies. The paper offers value for researchers and practitioners due to its contribution to the green operations literature. For instance, the inclusion of green buildings as part of green operations practices has so far been neglected by most researchers and authors in the field of green and sustainable operations. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited...|$|E
