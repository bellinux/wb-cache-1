40|$|BACKGROUND: Despite the {{dramatic}} {{decline in the}} incidence of invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) observed since the introduction of conjugate vaccination, it is feared that several factors may undermine the future effectiveness of the vaccines. In particular, pathogenic pneumococci may switch their capsular types and evade vaccine-conferred immunity. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here, we first review the literature and summarize the available epidemiological data on <b>capsular</b> <b>switch</b> for S. pneumoniae. We estimate the weekly probability that a persistently carried strain may switch its capsule from four studies, totalling 516 children and 6 years of follow-up, at 1. 5 x 10 (- 3) /week [4. 6 x 10 (- 5) - 4. 8 x 10 (- 3) /week]. There is not enough power to assess an increase in this frequency in vaccinated individuals. Then, we use a mathematical model of pneumococcal transmission to quantify the impact of <b>capsular</b> <b>switch</b> on the incidence of IPD in a vaccinated population. In this model, we investigate a wide range of values for the frequency of vaccine-selected <b>capsular</b> <b>switch.</b> Predictions show that, with vaccine-independent switching only, IPD incidence in children should be down by 48 % 5 years after the introduction of the vaccine with high coverage. Introducing vaccine-selected <b>capsular</b> <b>switch</b> at a frequency up to 0. 01 /week shows little effect on this decrease; yearly, at most 3 excess cases of IPD per 10 (6) children might occur due to switched pneumococcal strains. CONCLUSIONS: Based on all available data and model predictions, the existence of <b>capsular</b> <b>switch</b> by itself should not impact significantly the efficacy of pneumococcal conjugate vaccination on IPD incidence. This optimistic result should be tempered {{by the fact that the}} selective pressure induced by the vaccine is currently increasing along with vaccine coverage worldwide; continued surveillance of pneumococcal populations remains of the utmost importance, in particular during clinical trials of the new conjugate vaccines...|$|E
40|$|The {{implementation}} of nationwide pneumococcal vaccination {{may lead to}} alterations in the pneumococcal population due to selective pressure induced by the vaccine. To monitor such changes, pneumococcal isolates causing invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) before (2004 - 2005, n = 1154) and after (2008 - 2009, n = 1190) the {{implementation of}} the 7 -valent pneumococcal vaccine (PCV 7) in 2006 in the national immunization program (NIP) of The Netherlands were characterized by molecular typing using multiple-locus variable number tandem repeat analysis (MLVA) and capsular sequence typing (CST). The IPD incidence after the implementation of PCV 7 in children = 5 years of age, the overall IPD incidence remained constant, but the IPD incidence due to vaccine serotypes declined in this age cohort as well, indicating herd immunity. IPD incidence of non-vaccine serotypes 1 and 22 F isolates increased significantly and a shift in genetic background of the isolates belonging to these serotypes was observed. In general the composition of the pneumococcal population remained similar after the introduction of PCV 7. Both before and after introduction of the vaccine several possible <b>capsular</b> <b>switch</b> events were noticed. We found 4 isolates from the pre-vaccination period in which the serotype 19 F capsular locus had been horizontally transferred to a different genetic background. Remarkably, none of the 5 post-vaccination isolates in which we observed possible capsule switch belonged to the 19 F serotype, possibly due to vaccine induced pressure. In the post-vaccine implementation period we found no evidence for <b>capsular</b> <b>switch</b> of a vaccine serotype to a non-vaccine serotype, indicating that <b>capsular</b> <b>switch</b> is not the main driving force for replacement.

40|$|Background. A {{quadrivalent}} meningococcal conjugate vaccine (MCV 4) was licensed in the United States in 2005; no serogroup B {{vaccine is}} available. Neisseria meningitidis changes its capsular phenotype through <b>capsular</b> <b>switching,</b> which {{has implications for}} vaccines that do not protect against all serogroups. Methods. Meningococcal isolates from 10 Active Bacterial Core surveillance sites from 2000 through 2005 were analyzed to identify changes occurring after MCV 4 licensure. Isolates were characterized by multilocus sequence typing (MLST) and outer membrane protein gene sequencing. Isolates expressing capsular polysaccharide different from that associated with the MLST lineage were considered to demonstrate <b>capsular</b> <b>switching.</b> Results. Among 1160 isolates, the most common genetic lineages were the sequence type (ST) – 23, ST- 32, ST- 11, and ST- 41 / 44 clonal complexes.

40|$|The {{polysaccharide}} capsule {{is a major}} antigenic factor in Streptococcus agalactiae (Lancefield group B streptococcus [GBS]). Previous observations suggest that exchange of capsular loci is likely to occur rather frequently in GBS, even though GBS is not known to be naturally transformable. We sought to identify and characterize putative <b>capsular</b> <b>switching</b> events, {{by means of a}} combination of phenotypic and genotypic methods, including pulsed-field gel electrophoretic profiling, multilocus sequence typing, and surface protein and pilus gene profiling. We show that <b>capsular</b> <b>switching</b> by horizontal gene transfer is not as frequent as previously suggested. Serotyping errors may be the main reason behind the overestimation of capsule switch-ing, since phenotypic techniques are prone to errors of interpretation.

40|$|Neisseria meningitidis is {{a leading}} {{bacterial}} cause of sepsis and meningitis globally. Beginning with an epidemic among Hajj pilgrims in 2000, capsular group W (W) sequence type (ST) 11 emerged as {{a leading cause of}} epidemic meningitis in the African ‘meningitis belt’ and endemic cases in South America, Europe, Middle East and China. Previous genotyping studies were unable to reliably discriminate less virulent W ST- 11 strains in circulation since 1970 from the Hajj epidemic strain (Hajj clone). It is also unclear what proportion of more recent W ST- 11 disease clusters were caused by direct descendants of the Hajj clone. This work analyzes whole genome sequences of a global collection of over 250 meningococcal strains isolated from patients with invasive meningococcal disease globally from 1970 to 2014 using phylogenetic analyses, detailed examination of the capsule gene cluster (cps) and genes encoding major surface antigens. We found that all W ST- 11 strains were descendants of an ancestral strain that had undergone unique capsular switching events. We identified two distinct, conserved, recombination events within W ST- 11 cps genes with W ST- 22 and Y ST- 23 as most likely donor lineages. In addition, the Hajj clone and its descendants were distinct from other W ST- 11 strains in that they shared a common antigen gene profile and had undergone further recombination involving virulence genes encoding factor H binding protein (fHbp), nitric oxide reductase (nor), and nitrite reductase (aniA). These data suggest that the W ST- 11 <b>capsular</b> <b>switch</b> involved two separate recombination events and that current global W ST- 11 meningococcal disease is caused by strains bearing this <b>capsular</b> <b>switch.</b> Emergence of the Hajj clone may be related to recent acquisition of a distinct antigen-encoding gene profile and variations in meningococcal virulence genes.

40|$|The {{introduction}} of the seven-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV 7) in Portugal led to extensive serotype replacement among carriers of pneumococci, with a marked decrease of PCV 7 types. Although antimicrobial resistance was traditionally associated with PCV 7 types, no {{significant changes in the}} rates of nonsusceptibility to penicillin, resistance to macrolides, or multidrug resistance were observed. This study aimed to investigate the mechanisms leading to maintenance of antimicrobial resistance, despite marked serotype replacement. We compared, through molecular typing, 252 antibiotic-resistant pneumococci recovered from young carriers in 2006 and 2007 (era of high PCV 7 uptake) with collections of isolates from 2002 and 2003 (n 374; low-PCV 7 -uptake era) and 1996 to 2001 (n 805; pre-PCV 7 era). We observed that the group of clones that has accounted for antimicrobial resistance since 1996 is essentially the same as the one identified in the PCV 7 era. The relative proportions of such clones have, however, evolved substantially overtime. Notably, widespread use of PCV 7 led to an expansion of two Pneumococcal Molecular Epidemiology Network (PMEN) clones expressing non-PCV 7 capsular variants of the original strains: Sweden 15 AST 63 (serotypes 15 A and 19 A) and Denmark 14 ST 230 (serotypes 19 A and 24 F).

After the introduction of the conjugated pneumococcal vaccine PCV 7, which covered the seven most frequent serotypes in IPD in the USA, an increase in IPD caused by non-vaccine serotypes was observed, and serotype 19 A, which belongs to sequence type (ST) 199, was among the most prevalent STs.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Serotype 19 A {{invasive}} pneumococcal disease (IPD) increased {{annually in}} the United States after {{the introduction of the}} 7 -valent conjugate vaccine (PCV 7). To understand this increase, we characterized serotype 19 A isolates recovered during 2005. METHODS: IPD cases during 1998 - 2005 were identified through population-based surveillance. We performed susceptibility testing and multilocus sequence typing on 528 (95 %) of 554 serotype 19 A isolates reported in 2005. RESULTS: The incidence of IPD due to serotype 19 A increased from 0. 8 to 2. 5 cases per 100, 000 population between 1998 and 2005 (P <. 05), whereas the overall incidence of IPD decreased from 24. 4 to 13. 8 cases per 100, 000 population (P <. 05). Simultaneously, the incidence of IPD due to penicillin-resistant 19 A isolates increased from 6. 7 % to 35 % (P <. 0001). Of 151 penicillin-resistant 19 A isolates, 111 (73. 5 %) belonged to the rapidly emerging clonal complex 320, which is related to multidrug-resistant Taiwan(19 F) - 14. The remaining penicillin-resistant strains were highly related to other clones of PCV 7 serotypes or to isolates within major 19 A clonal complex 199 (CC 199).

The virulence potential of the three clones was poor even at high inoculum (10 (5) CFU per mouse) concentrations in the mouse septicemia model and was undetectable in the pneumonia model. Capsular type 3 transformants of clones 6 A and 19 A prepared in the laboratory produced lethal infection at low cell concentration (10 (3) CFU per mouse) but the same transformants became impaired in their potential to colonize, indicating the importance of the capsular polysaccharide in both disease and colonization. The three clones were compared to the genomes of 56 S. pneumoniae strains for which sequence information was available in the public databank. Clone 15 A (ST 63) only differed from the serotype 19 F clone G 54 in a very few genes including serotype so that this clone may be considered the product of a <b>capsular</b> <b>switch.</b> While no strain with comparable degree of similarity to clone 19 A (ST 276) was found among the sequenced isolates, by MLST this clone is a single locust variant (SLV) of Denmark 14 -ST 230 international clone. Clone 6 A (ST 2191) was most similar to the penicillin resistant Hungarian serotype 19 A clone...|$|E

40|$|Neisseria meningitides {{is one of}} {{the leading}} causes of {{bacterial}} meningitis. The epidemiology of invasive meningococcal disease varies in different countries and regions. This review summarizes the available data from China describing the burden of meningococcal disease, N. meningitidis serogroups, and vaccination programs. Meningococcal serogroup A (MenA) was predominant for several decades in China. However, since 2000, invasive meningococcal disease caused by MenC, MenW, or MenB has increased. MenC, belonging to a hyperinvasive clonal sequence type ST- 4821 (CC 4821), emerged in Anhui Province and was subsequently disseminated over two-thirds of all Chinese provinces. Serogroup W (CC 11) is endemic and causes death. Serogroup B (CC 4821) originated from serogroup C (CC 4821) via a <b>capsular</b> <b>switching</b> mechanism. Polysaccharide A and C meningococcal vaccines have been introduced into national routine immunization programs and have effectively reduced invasive meningococcal disease. However, the vaccination strategy must be revised based on the epidemic trends in meningococcal disease in China...|$|R

Materials and methods The bacterium receptor strain C 2135 was cultivated and had its mutant DNA donor M 2 and M 6, which received a receptor strain and MWCNT at three different concentrations. The inhibition effect of DNAse on the DNA in contact with nanoparticles was evaluated. Results The results indicated an in increase in the transformation capacity of N. meninigtidis in different concentrations of MWCNT when compared with negative control without nanotubes. A final analysis {{of the interaction between}} DNA and MWCNT was carried out using Raman Spectroscopy. Conclusion These increases in the transformation capacity mediated by MWCNT, in meningococci, indicate the interaction of these particles with the virulence acquisition of these bacteria, {{as well as with the}} increase in the vaccination escape process. </p...|$|R
40|$|Streptococcus pneumoniae is a gram-positive {{bacterium}} {{that can be}} found in both healthy carriers as well as in people that have developed disease. One of the major virulence factors of pneumococci is their polysaccharide capsule. Based on the capsule that surrounds the bacteria, pneumococci are divided into at least 90 different serotypes. Some serotypes seem to be more related to virulence than others. I have with comparative genome hybridization microarray technique, studied gene differences between 18 epidemiological well-characterised pneumococcal strains with different potential to cause disease. A microarray chip based on two sequenced pneumococcal genomes, R 6 and TIGR 4, has already been designed. According to Hierarchical clustering, both the serotype and the genetic type as assessed by MLST (sequence type or ST) seem to have impact on the relationship of clinical isolates. Most clinical isolates of the same serotype are clustered together except for serotype 14 isolates that seem to be more divergent. Further more the number of genes that are divergent between clinical isolates compared to R 6 and TIGR 4 differ from 65 to 289. Preliminary results indicate that although there is diversity among clinical isolates some are more closely related to each other then others. Absent genes seem to be evenly distributed among all 18 clinical isolates tested but hypothetical genes and genes for cell envelope are two groups of role categories that are absent to the largest extent in all isolates. According to results from microarray analysis, a gene region, spr 0112 -spr 1015 - is present in all type 9 V isolates and absent in many isolates of serotype 14, 19 F and 7 F. These results have been confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Conserved genes in a region around the capsule genes have been sequenced to identify marker genes for a capsulular switch between serotype 9 V and 14. Preliminary results of the sequencing showed that as much as 750 kb might have been transferred in the event of <b>capsular</b> <b>switch...</b>|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} {{various aspects}} on pneumococcal disease, {{pneumococcal conjugate vaccine}}s (PCVs) and the societal impact of PCV implementation in children. Implementation of 7 -valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV 7) in the Dutch national immunization program for infants led to a shift from vaccine to non-vaccine serotypes (i. e. replacement disease) in invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD). This shift was observed in all age groups, including non-vaccinated persons, due to indirect effects. Indirect were caused by a reduction in nasopharyngeal colonization of vaccine serotypes in children and subsequent transmission (i. e. herd effects). Also after PCV 7 {{was replaced by a}} 10 -valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV 10) we observed herd effects for extra serotypes covered by PCV 10. Replacement disease following PCVs was primarily caused by expansion of pre-existing non-vaccine serotypes (NVT) rather than <b>capsular</b> <b>switch</b> variants. Despite replacement disease IPD incidence has decreased dramatically in children < 5 year old. Also in elderly aged 65 and older net IPD incidence decreased. The magnitude of herd effects and extent of disease caused by NVT strains was different between sexes in particular among 20 – 39 year-olds. Though these differences were subtle gender is an epidemiological factor to consider in the surveillance of IPD. Shifts in serotypes coincided with changes in clinical syndromes in IPD (i. e. increase in empyema incidence) and outcomes (i. e. decreased IPD case-fatality) for the post-PCV 7 period. Also we showed that despite herd effects underlying conditions such as chronic lung or cardiovascular disease and HIV/AIDS persist as important risk factors for IPD in the post-PCV 7 period. In addition, the long-term mortality after pneumococcal pneumonia remained high. The impact of PCVs on the microbiological aetiology of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in hospitalised adults for other pathogens than S. pneumoniae was unchanged. Potential disturbances of PCVs on the nasopharyngeal microbiome therefore do not seem to translate into a higher proportion of other pathogens in the aetiology of CAP. At last, we vaccinated former pneumococcal CAP patients and former CAP patients infected by another other identified pathogen. In both groups 13 -valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV 13) was immunogenic...|$|E
40|$|The heptavalent pneumococcal {{conjugate}} vaccine (PCV 7) {{was introduced}} in the United States (US) in 2000 and has significantly reduced invasive pneumococcal disease; however, the incidence of nonvaccine serotype invasive disease, particularly due to serotype 19 A, has increased. The serotype 19 A increase can be explained in part by expansion of a genotype that has been circulating in the US prior to vaccine implementation (and other countries since at least 1990), but also by the emergence of a novel "vaccine escape recombinant" pneumococcal strain. This strain has a genotype that previously was only associated with vaccine serotype 4, but now expresses a nonvaccine serotype 19 A capsule. Based on prior evidence for capsular switching by recombination at the capsular locus, the genetic event that resulted in this novel serotype/genotype combination might be identifiable from the DNA sequence of individual pneumococcal strains. Therefore, the aim {{of this study was to}} characterise the putative recombinational event(s) at the capsular locus that resulted in the change from a vaccine to a nonvaccine capsular type. Sequencing the capsular locus flanking regions of 51 vaccine escape (progeny), recipient, and putative donor pneumococci revealed a 39 kb recombinational fragment, which included the capsular locus, flanking regions, and two adjacent penicillin-binding proteins, and thus resulted in a <b>capsular</b> <b>switch</b> and penicillin nonsusceptibility in a single genetic event. Since 2003, 37 such vaccine escape strains have been detected, some of which had evolved further. Furthermore, two new types of serotype 19 A vaccine escape strains emerged in 2005. To our knowledge, this is the first time a single recombinational event has been documented in vivo that resulted in both a change of serotype and penicillin nonsusceptibility. Vaccine escape by genetic recombination at the capsular locus has the potential to reduce PCV 7 effectiveness in the longer term. Citation: Brueggemann, A. B. et al. (2007).

40|$|We {{carried out}} multilocus {{sequence}} typing (MLST) on 148 pneumococcal carriage isolates collected from children < 24  months old in the Upper River Division, the Gambia. MLST revealed a diverse population. Seventy-six different sequence types (STs) were found, {{the most common}} of which were 802 and 919, associated with 23 F and 6 A serotypes, respectively. Comparison with the MLST database showed that only 11 of the STs found in the present sample had been reported outside Africa. Six STs showed evidence of <b>capsular</b> <b>switching</b> (172, 802, 847, 1730, 1736, and 1737). Serotype switches were confirmed by microarrays that detected capsule genes. Of isolates analyzed by using microarrays, 40 / 69 (58 %) harbored the tetM resistance determinant. A statistical genetic analysis to detect recombination found that 49 / 144 (34 %) isolates showed significant (P < 0. 05) evidence of admixture, which is greater than that observed in similar samples from the United Kingdom (5 %) and Finland (2 %). We hypothesize that large amounts of admixture could reflect the high prevalence of multiple carriage in this region, leading to more opportunities for homologous recombination between strains. This could have consequences for the population response to conjugate vaccination...|$|R
40|$|The 7 -valent pneumococcal {{conjugated}} vaccine (PCV 7) {{has affected}} the genetic population of Streptococcus pneumoniae in pediatric carriage. Little is known however about pneumococcal population genomics in adult invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) under vaccine pressure. We sequenced and serotyped 349 strains of S. pneumoniae isolated from IPD patients in Nijmegen between 2001 and 2011. Introduction of PCV 7 in the Dutch National Immunization Program in 2006 preluded substantial alterations in the IPD population structure caused by serotype replacement. No evidence could be found for vaccine induced <b>capsular</b> <b>switches.</b> We observed that after a temporary bottleneck in gene diversity after the introduction of PCV 7, the accessory gene pool re-expanded mainly by genes already circulating pre-PCV 7. In the post-vaccine genomic population a number of genes changed frequency, certain genes became overrepresented in vaccine serotypes, while others shifted towards non-vaccine serotypes. Whether these dynamics in the invasive pneumococcal population have truly contributed to invasiveness and manifestations of disease remains to be further elucidated. We suggest the use of whole genome sequencing for surveillance of pneumococcal population dynamics that could give a prospect on the course of disease, facilitating effective prevention and management of IPD...|$|R
