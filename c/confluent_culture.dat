50|$|However, it is {{important}} to note that contact-inhibited cells undergo cell cycle arrest, but do not senesce. In fact, it has been shown that contact-inhibited cells resume normal proliferation and mitogen signaling upon being replated in a less <b>confluent</b> <b>culture.</b> Thus, contact inhibition of proliferation may be viewed as a reversible form of cell cycle arrest. Furthermore, to transition from cell cycle arrest to senescence, contact-inhibited cells must activate growth-activating pathways such as mTOR. Once cells in high-density cultures become confluent enough such that the cell area falls below a critical value, the adhesion formations trigger pathways that downregulate mitogen signaling and cell proliferation. The growth-promoting mTOR pathway is therefore inhibited, and consequently the contact-inhibited cells cannot transition from cell cycle arrest to senescence. This has crucial implications in cancer therapy; even though cancer cells are not contact-inhibited, confluent cancer cell cultures still suppress their senescence machinery. Therefore, this may be a plausible explanation why senescence-inducing cancer therapy drugs are ineffective.|$|E
50|$|A {{cobblestone}} area-forming cell (CAFC) assay is a cell culture-based empirical assay. When plated onto a <b>confluent</b> <b>culture</b> of stromal feeder layer, {{a fraction}} of HSCs creep between the gaps (even though the stromal cells are touching each other) and eventually settle between the stromal cells and the substratum (here the dish surface) or trapped in the cellular processes between the stromal cells. Emperipolesis is the in vivo phenomenon in which one cell is completely engulfed into another (e.g. thymocytes into thymic nurse cells); on the other hand, when in vitro, lymphoid lineage cells creep beneath nurse-like cells, the process is called pseudoemperipolesis. This similar phenomenon is more commonly known in the HSC field by the cell culture terminology cobble stone area-forming cells (CAFC), which means areas or clusters of cells look dull cobblestone-like under phase contrast microscopy, {{compared to the other}} HSCs, which are refractile. This happens because the cells that are floating loosely on top of the stromal cells are spherical and thus refractile. However, the cells that creep beneath the stromal cells are flattened and, thus, not refractile. The mechanism of pseudoemperipolesis is only recently coming to light. It may be mediated by interaction through CXCR4 (CD184) the receptor for CXC Chemokines (e.g., SDF1) and α4β1 integrins.|$|E
40|$|The {{extracellular}} microenvironment plays a {{key role}} in regulation of cellular functions and growth control. We show here that membrane-type 1 matrix metalloproteinase (MT 1 -MMP) acts as a growth promoter in <b>confluent</b> <b>culture.</b> When MT 1 -MMP was silenced in HT 1080 fibrosarcoma cells, cells created three dimensional (3 D) fibronectin matrix in a <b>confluent</b> <b>culture,</b> and growth of cells embedded within it was retarded. Formation of 3 D fibronectin matrix initiated by MT 1 -MMP silencing was impeded by knockdown of either FN or integrin β 1, which resulted in restoration of cell growth. When cells in 3 D fibronectin matrix were treated with integrin β 1 inhibitory antibody, cells underwent S phase entry. These results suggest that MT 1 -MMP prevents growth suppression by 3 D fibronectin matrix, which is mediated through integrin β 1. © 2013 Elsevier Inc...|$|E

40|$|The Na+/H+ {{exchanger}} isoform 1 (NHE- 1) is a ubiquitous membrane glycoprotein {{present on}} most eukaryotic cells.

The effect of culture density on the intracellular pH (pHi) and activity of NHE- 1 of human MRC 5 fibroblasts was thus investigated using fluorometry with BCECF, NHE- 1 abundance with western blotting and NHE- 1 phosphorylation using specific polyclonal antibodies.

During G 2 microvilli increase in number and the cells thicken in anticipation of rounding up for mitosis. It appears that the changes observed here reflect the changing capacity of CHO cells during the cycle to respond to contact with other cells in the population, because, {{as noted in the}} succeeding paper (Rubin and Everhart), CHO cells in sparse nonconfluent cultures do not show the same wide range of changes during the cell cycle.

Caco- 2 cells spontaneously differentiate either in <b>confluent</b> <b>culture</b> or when treated with butyrate, a molecule present naturally in the diet. Here, we compared CLCA 1 expressional levels between patients with and without colorectal cancer (CRC) and determined the functional role of CLCA 1 in differentiation and proliferation of Caco- 2 cells. We showed that: 1) CLCA 1 and CLCA 4 expression were down-regulated significantly in CRC patients; 2) CLCA 1 expression was up-regulated in Caco- 2 cells induced to differentiate by <b>confluent</b> <b>culture</b> or by treatment with sodium butyrate (NaBT); 3) Knockdown of CLCA 1 with siRNA significantly inhibited cell differentiation and promoted cell proliferation in Caco- 2 confluent cultures, and 4) In Caco- 2 3 D culture, suppression of CLCA 1 significantly increased cell proliferation and compromised NaBT-induced inhibition of proliferation.

In general, subconfluent, actively growing cells yielded higher amounts of infectious virus than did confluent contact-inhibited cells. The higher yield of infectious virus was correlated with {{a greater percentage of}} cells producing viral antigens within the first 48 h after infection. In <b>confluent</b> <b>cultures,</b> 25 to 50 % of the cells produced viral antigens within the first 48 h postinfection.

40|$|A {{regenerative}} calcium wave is {{an increase}} in cytosolic free calcium concentration ([Ca 2 +]i) which extends beyond the stimulated cells without decrement of amplitude, kinetics of [Ca 2 +]i increase and speed of propagation. The aim {{of the present study was}} to test the hypothesis that such a wave could be evoked by bradykinin stimulation and by scraping cultured endothelial cells from porcine coronary arteries. Calcium imaging was performed using the calcium-sensitive dye fura- 2. A wound or a delivery of bradykinin to two to three cells on growing clusters of ≈ 300 cells caused an increase in [Ca 2 +]i which was propagated throughout the cluster in a regenerative manner over distances up to 400 μm. This wave spread through gap junctions since it was inhibited by the cell uncoupler palmitoleic acid. The same experiments performed in <b>confluent</b> <b>cultures</b> caused a rise in [Ca 2 +]i which failed to propagate in a regenerative way. The wave propagation probably failed because the confluent cells were less dye coupled than the growing cells. This was confirmed by immunohistology which detected a dramatic decrease in the number of connexin 40 gap junctions in the <b>confluent</b> <b>cultures.</b> The regenerative propagation of the wave was blocked by inhibitors of calcium-induced calcium release (CICR) and phospholipase C (PLC), and by suppression of extracellular calcium, but not by clamping the membrane potential with high-potassium solution. We conclude that regenerative intercellular calcium waves exist in cultured islets but not in <b>confluent</b> <b>cultures</b> of endothelial cells.

In this study an established cell line of baby hamster kidney cells (BHK 21 / 13) and its polyoma virustransformed derivative (py-BHK) were used. The following results were obtained using an immune adherence (IA) method, in which the {{reactivity of}} Forssman antigen was expressed in terms of proportion of IA-positive cells. 1. When the BHK cells were collected from a sparse culture showing no cell-cell contact, 70 - 85 % of the cells were IA-positive.

As the cell density increased, the reactivity of the antigen decreased. Only 30 - 40 % of the cells were IA-positive, when a <b>confluent</b> <b>culture</b> was used. It is likely that the cell-cell contact is responsible for the alteration of cell surface leading to a decrease in the reactivity of IA reaction. 2. In the case of py-BHK cells, about 90 % of the cells were IA-positive, irrespective of the cell density. 3. The reactivity of the antigen was tested on the BHK cells through their cell cycle, showing that the reactivity increased to 70 - 90 % in a near S phase, while it decreased to about 45 % in M and G 1 phases. 4. When the BHK cells of a <b>confluent</b> <b>culture</b> were treated with trypsin or neuraminidase, the reactivity of Forssman antigen increased to an extent comparable to that of py-BHK cells.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to examine the}} cell cycle characteristics of bovine fetal and adult somatic cells (fetal fibroblasts, adult skin and muscle cells, and cumulus cells) after culture {{under a variety of}} conditions; 1) growth to 60 - 70 % confluency (cycling), 2) serum starvation, 3) culture to confluency. Cell-cycle phases were determined by flow cytometry with propidium iodide staining enabling the calculation of percentages of cells in G 0 / G 1, S and G 2 / M. The majority was in G 0 / G 1 regardless of cell type and treatment. Serum-starved or <b>confluent</b> <b>cultures</b> contained higher percentages of cells in G 0 / G 1 (89. 5 - 95. 4 %; P< 0. 05). Percentages of cells in G 0 / G 1 increased as cell size decreased regardless of the cell type and treatment. In the serum-starved and <b>confluent</b> <b>cultures,</b> about 98 % of small cells were in G 0 / G 1. Serum-starved cultures contained higher percentages of small cells (38. 5 - 66. 9 %) than cycling and <b>confluent</b> <b>cultures</b> regardless of cell type (P< 0. 05). After trypsinization of fetal fibroblasts and adult skin cells that were serum-starved and cultured to confluency, the percentages of cells in G 0 / G 1 increased (P< 0. 05) on incubation for 1. 5 (95. 7 - 99. 5 %) or 3 hr (95. 9 - 98. 6 %). These results verify that serum starvation and culture to confluency are efficient means of synchronizing bovine somatic cells in G 0 / G 1, and indicate that a more efficient synchronization of the cells in G 0 / G 1 can be established by incubation for a limited time period after trypsinization of serum-starved or confluent cells...|$|R
40|$|Human skin {{fibroblasts}} synthesize and accumulate glycosaminoglycans (GAG). Recently, {{we reported}} that fibroblasts incubated in thyroid hormone-deficient media accumulate more GAG than do cultures incubated {{in the same}} media enriched with 0. 1 μM triiodothyronine (T 3) (1981. Endocrinology. 108 : 2397). The current study characterizes that enhanced accumulation. <b>Confluent</b> <b>cultures</b> were maintained in thyroid hormone-deficient media without or with added T 3, labeled with [3 H]acetate and analyzed for total [3 H]GAG and [3 H]hyaluronic acid content...|$|R
40|$|Increased serum {{concentration}} in the medium of a <b>confluent</b> <b>culture</b> increases the overlapping of cells and the average rate of cell movement. The relationship between these two serum activities and serum release of growth inhibition was studied. The increase in overlaps {{does not appear to}} be directly related to release of growth since it occurs well after growth has been initiated. The increased rate of cell movement occurred immediately after the addition of serum and was quantitatively proportional to the stimulation of DNA synthesis over a range of serum concentrations, implying that both movement and growth are released by a common serum activity. Direct microscopic observation and time-lapse films reveal a reduction in cell contacts concurrent with the increase in cell movement. Experiments showed that cell movement at low cell densities, where cell contacts are minimal, was rapid in low serum concentration and was not stimulated by increasing the serum concentration. This suggests that the serum effect on cell movement involves cell contacts and is due to release of cell contacts in the confluent monolayer. The primary action of serum may be the disruption of adhesive cell contacts...|$|E
40|$|AIM: The role of ischaemic {{preconditioning}} (IPC) on liver regenerationfollowing surgery remains inconclusive. The aim of {{the study}} was toassess the effect of IPC on mediators involved in regeneration producedby human hepatocytes, using an in-vitro hypoxia-reoxygenation modelto mimic ischaemia-reperfusion injury (IRI). METHODS: Following extraction from samples obtained fromliver resection (n= 5), <b>confluent</b> <b>culture</b> flasks of hepatocytes weresubjected to IRI (1 hour hypoxia + 1 hour reoxygenation), IPC prior toIRI (10 minutes hypoxia + 10 minutes reoxygenation + 1 hour hypoxia+ 1 hour reoxygenation), intermittent clamping (IC, 15 minuteshypoxia + 5 minutes reoxygenation x 3 + 1 hour reoxygenation) andcompared to controls. The production of various mediators wasdetermined over 48 hours. RESULTS: Interleukin (IL) - 8, granulocyte-colony stimulating factor(G-CSF) and IL- 1 -receptor antagonist (IL- 1 ra) were produced byhepatocytes. IPC prior to IRI did not influence the production ofIL- 8, G-CSF and IL- 1 ra by hepatocytes compared to IRI over thestudy period. Similarly, IC did not significantly influence the profileof these mediators compared to IRI in this model. CONCLUSION: IPC, as well as IC did not influence the productionof pro-regenerative mediators in a hepatocyte model of IRI. The roleof IPC in liver regeneration remains to be determined...|$|E
40|$|Cells of {{the mouse}} line Balb/ 3 T 3 as well as three virus-induced transformants and two {{spontaneous}} transformants grown in vitro have been studied for their topography by scanning electron microscopy. The parent cell in <b>confluent</b> <b>culture</b> closely resembles an endothelial cell in its form and {{in the structure of}} its association with adjacent cells. The tumorigenic transformants produced by SV 40, murine sarcoma virus, or polyoma viruses are fusiform to pleomorphic and distinctly different from the cell of origin. They show relatively smooth surfaces except for blebs and marginal microvilli. Perhaps most surprising is the similarity they bear to one another. This is made the more singular by the very different form shown by the tumorigenic transformants of spontaneous origin. One of these, S 2 - 4, possesses a thickened rather than the lamellar form of the parent A 31 cell and is covered by long microvilli and many spherical blebs. The other, TuT 3, more closely resembles the cell of origin but shows extensive ruffling at its margins. All transformants grow without evidence of contact inhibition. The significance of the surface morphologies and the factors influencing cell form are discussed...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: Cisplatin {{was found}} to radiosensitize SW- 1573 cells by {{inhibition}} of PLDR. Therefore, it was investigated whether cisplatin combined with gamma-radiation leads {{to an increase in}} the number of chromosomal aberrations or apoptotic cells compared with radiation alone. METHODS: <b>Confluent</b> <b>cultures</b> of the human lung carcinoma cell line SW- 1573 were treated with 1 microM cisplatin for 1 h, 4 Gy gamma-radiation, or a combination of both. Cell survival was studied by the clonogenic assay. Aberrations were analysed by FISH in prematurely condensed chromosomes (PCC) and the induction of apoptosis by counting fragmented nuclei. RESULTS: A radiosensitizing effect of cisplatin on cell survival was observed if time for PLDR was allowed. An increased number of chromosomal fragments were observed immediately after irradiation compared with 24 h after irradiation whereas color junctions are only formed 24 h after irradiation. No increase in chromosomal aberrations was found after combined treatment, but a significantly enhanced number of fragmented nuclei were observed when <b>confluent</b> <b>cultures</b> were replated after allowing PLDR. CONCLUSION: The inhibition of PLDR by cisplatin in delayed plated SW- 1573 cells did not increase chromosomal aberrations, but increased the induction of apoptosi...|$|R
40|$|To {{understand}} the relationship between the proliferation of epidermis and its arachidonic acid metabolism, we studied human keratinocytes grown in vitro at confluent or nonconfluent densities. Keratinocyte cultures incubated with [14 C]arachidonic acid synthesized prostaglandin (PG) E 2 PGD 2, PGF 2 alpha, and small quantities of 6 -keto-F 1 alpha. Nonconfluent cultures, however, synthesized fourfold more PGE 2 than did <b>confluent</b> <b>cultures.</b> When proliferation was studied using [3 H]thymidine incorporation into DNA, it was found that this increased synthesis of PGE 2 was accompanied by a fourfold increase in the rate of proliferation. When PGE 2 synthesis was inhibited by indomethacin, the rate of proliferation of nonconfluent cultures was decreased 40 %, while the rate of proliferation of <b>confluent</b> <b>cultures</b> was unchanged. Addition of 1 ng/ml of PGE 2, but not PGF 2 alpha, PGD 2, or a stable analog of PGI 2 to the indomethacin-treated nonconfluent cultures restored the initial rate of proliferation. These results suggest that PGE 2 is a growth-promoting autocoid for epidermis. The synthesis of PGE 2 by epidermis may be enhanced in wound healing and disease states where epidermal continuity is disrupted...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Measurements of the {{transepithelial}} {{electrical resistance}} correlated with freezefracture observations {{have been used}} to study the process of tight junction formation under various experimental conditions in monolayers of the canine kidney epithelial cell line MDCK. Cells derived from previously <b>confluent</b> <b>cultures</b> and plated immediately after trypsin-EDTA dissociation develop a resistance that reaches its maximum value of several hundred ohmscm 2 after ~ 24 h and falls to a steady-state value of 80 - 150 ohms-cm 2 by 48 h. The rise in resistance and the development of tight junctions can be completely and reversibly prevented by the addition of 10 /~g/ml cycloheximide at the time of plating, but not when this inhibitor is added more than 10 h after plating. Thus tight junction formation consists of separable synthetic and assembly phases. These two phases can also be dissociated and the requirement for protein synthesis after plating eliminated if, following trypsinization, the cells are maintained in spinner culture for 24 h before plating. The requirement for protein synthesis is restored, however, if cells maintained in spinner culture are treated with trypsin before plating. Actinomycin D prevents development of resistance only in monolayers formed from cells derived from sparse rather than <b>confluent</b> <b>cultures,</b> but new mRNA synthesis is not required if cell...|$|R
