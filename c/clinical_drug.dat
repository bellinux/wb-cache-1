5|$|Certain {{mushrooms}} enjoy usage as therapeutics in folk medicines, such as Traditional Chinese medicine. Notable medicinal mushrooms with a well-documented {{history of}} use include Agaricus subrufescens, Ganoderma lucidum, and Ophiocordyceps sinensis. Research has identified compounds produced by {{these and other}} fungi that have inhibitory biological effects against viruses and cancer cells. Specific metabolites, such as polysaccharide-K, ergotamine, and β-lactam antibiotics, are routinely used in clinical medicine. The shiitake mushroom {{is a source of}} lentinan, a <b>clinical</b> <b>drug</b> approved for use in cancer treatments in several countries, including Japan. In Europe and Japan, polysaccharide-K (brand name Krestin), a chemical derived from Trametes versicolor, is an approved adjuvant for cancer therapy.|$|E

40|$|Cells {{respond and}} adapt to various {{extracellular}} changes. Environmental stresses, {{such as high}} osmolarity and acute glucose deprivation, rapidly and transiently shut down translation initiation and actin polarization in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Certain <b>clinical</b> <b>drugs,</b> such as local anesthetics and antipsychotic phenothiazines, and cationic surfactants also cause shutdowns similar to those triggered by environmental stresses. These compounds all have an amphiphilic structure, a cationic hydrophilic region, surfactant activity, {{and the ability to}} lyse yeast cells. Since low concentrations of these compounds shut down intracellular reactions in the absence of cell lysis, the compounds might change the state of the cell's membrane by intercalating into the membrane and thus generate signals for the shutdown, as do environmental stresses. The intracellular shutdowns caused by stresses might essentially be the same as the paralysis caused by <b>clinical</b> <b>drugs</b> at the cellular level...|$|R

40|$|Objectives: To {{evaluate}} {{the suitability of}} the ATC/DDD Index (Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) Classification System/Defined Daily Dose) for analyzing prescription lists in the U. S. Methods: We mapped RxNorm <b>clinical</b> <b>drugs</b> to ATC. We used this mapping to classify a large set of prescription drugs with ATC and compared the prescribed daily dose to the defined daily dose (DDD) in ATC. Results: 64 % of the 11, 422 <b>clinical</b> <b>drugs</b> could be precisely mapped to ATC. 97 % of the 87, 001 RxNorm codes from the prescription dataset could be classified with ATC, and 97 % of the prescribed daily doses could be assessed. Conclusions: Although the mapping of RxNorm ingredients to ATC appears to be largely incomplete, the most frequently prescribed drugs in the prescription dataset we analyzed were covered. This study demonstrates the feasibility of using ATC in conjunction with RxNorm for analyzing U. S. prescription datasets for drug classification and assessment of the prescribed daily doses. 1...|$|R

40|$|Background The RxNorm and NDF-RT (National Drug File Reference Terminology) are a {{suite of}} {{terminology}} standards for <b>clinical</b> <b>drugs</b> designated {{for use in the}} US federal government systems for electronic exchange of clinical health information. Analyzing how different drug products described in these terminologies are categorized into drug classes will help in their better organization and classification of pharmaceutical information. Methods Mappings between drug products in RxNorm and NDF-RT drug classes were extracted. Mappings were also extracted between drug products in RxNorm to five high-level NDF-RT categories: Chemical Structure; cellular or subcellular Mechanism of Action; organ-level or system-level Physiologic Effect; Therapeutic Intent; and Pharmacokinetics. Coverage for the mappings and the gaps were evaluated and analyzed algorithmically. Results Approximately 54 % of RxNorm <b>drug</b> products (Semantic <b>Clinical</b> <b>Drugs)</b> were found not to have a correspondence in NDF-RT. Similarly, approximately 45 % of drug products in NDF-RT are missing from RxNorm, most of which can be attributed to differences in dosage, strength, and route form. Approximately 81...|$|R
