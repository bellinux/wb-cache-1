50|$|A <b>cable</b> <b>assembly</b> is the {{composition}} {{of one or more}} electrical cable(s) and one or more connectors. A <b>cable</b> <b>assembly</b> is not necessarily suitable for connecting two devices but can be a partial product (e.g. to be soldered onto a printed circuit board with one side, the connector mounted to the housing). Cable assemblies can also take the form of cable trees, used to connect many electrical components. In all cases the combination of the electrical cable and the connector determines the performance of the <b>cable</b> <b>assembly</b> as a whole.|$|E

50|$|When used in {{relation}} to communications wiring, RS-422 wiring refers to cable made of 2 sets of twisted pair, often with each pair being shielded, and a ground wire. While a double pair cable may be practical for many RS-422 applications, the RS-422 specification only defines one signal path and does not assign any function to it. Any complete <b>cable</b> <b>assembly</b> with connectors should be labeled with the specification that defined the signal function and mechanical layout of the connector, such as RS-449.|$|E
