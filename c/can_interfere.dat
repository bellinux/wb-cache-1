5|$|Since inverter-fed motor cables' {{high-frequency}} current spikes <b>can</b> <b>interfere</b> {{with other}} cabling in facilities, such inverter-fed motor cables {{should not only}} be of shielded, symmetrical-geometry design but should also be routed at least 50cm away from signal cables.|$|E
5|$|Zinc oxide {{nanoparticles}} {{can enhance}} the antibacterial activity of ciprofloxacin. It {{has been shown that}} nano ZnO which has the average size between 20nm and 45nm {{can enhance the}} antibacterial activity of ciprofloxacin against Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli in vitro. The enhancing effect of this nanomaterial is concentration dependent against all test strains. This effect may be due to two reasons. First, zinc oxide nanoparticles <b>can</b> <b>interfere</b> with NorA protein, which is developed for conferring resistance in bacteria and has pumping activity that mediate the effluxing of hydrophilic fluoroquinolones from a cell. Second, zinc oxide nanoparticles <b>can</b> <b>interfere</b> with Omf protein, which is responsible for the permeation of quinolone antibiotics into the cell.|$|E

5|$|High {{levels of}} {{molybdenum}} <b>can</b> <b>interfere</b> with the body's uptake of copper, producing copper deficiency. Molybdenum prevents plasma proteins from binding to copper, {{and it also}} increases the amount of copper that is excreted in urine. Ruminants that consume high levels of molybdenum suffer from diarrhea, stunted growth, anemia, and achromotrichia (loss of fur pigment). These symptoms can be alleviated by copper supplements, either dietary and injection. The effective copper deficiency, can be aggravated by excess sulfur.|$|E
5|$|When airways are damaged, air {{can escape}} {{from them and}} be trapped in the {{surrounding}} tissues in the neck (subcutaneous emphysema) and mediastinum (pneumomediastinum); if it builds up to high enough pressures there, it can compress the airways. Massive air leaks from a ruptured airway can also compromise the circulation by preventing blood from returning to the heart from the head and lower body; this causes a potentially deadly reduction {{in the amount of}} blood the heart is able to pump out. Blood and other fluids can build up in the airways, and the injury <b>can</b> <b>interfere</b> with the patency of the airway and interfere with its continuity. However, even if the trachea is completely transected, the tissues surrounding it may hold it together enough for adequate air exchange to occur, at least at first.|$|E
5|$|Morpholinos <b>can</b> <b>interfere</b> with pre-mRNA {{processing}} steps {{either by}} preventing splice-directing small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNP) complexes from binding to their targets at {{the borders of}} introns on a strand of pre-mRNA, or by blocking the nucleophilic adenine base and preventing it from forming the splice lariat structure, or by interfering with the binding of splice regulatory proteins such as splice silencers and splice enhancers. Preventing the binding of snRNP U1 (at the donor site) or U2/U5 (at the polypyrimidine moiety and acceptor site) can cause modified splicing, commonly excluding exons from the mature mRNA. Targeting some splice targets results in intron inclusions, while activation of cryptic splice sites can lead to partial inclusions or exclusions. Targets of U11/U12 snRNPs can also be blocked. Splice modification can be conveniently assayed by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and {{is seen as a}} band shift after gel electrophoresis of RT-PCR products.|$|E

5|$|Arboreal animals {{frequently}} have elongated limbs {{that help them}} cross gaps, reach fruit or other resources, test the firmness of support ahead and, in some cases, to brachiate (swing between trees). Many arboreal species, such as tree porcupines, silky anteaters, spider monkeys, and possums, use prehensile tails to grasp branches. In the spider monkey, {{the tip of the}} tail has either a bare patch or adhesive pad, which provides increased friction. Claws can be used to interact with rough substrates and reorient the direction of forces the animal applies. This is what allows squirrels to climb tree trunks that are so large to be essentially flat from the perspective of such a small animal. However, claws <b>can</b> <b>interfere</b> with an animal's ability to grasp very small branches, as they may wrap too far around and prick the animal's own paw. Frictional gripping is used by primates, relying upon hairless fingertips. Squeezing the branch between the fingertips generates frictional force that holds the animal's hand to the branch. However, this type of grip depends upon the angle of the frictional force, thus upon the diameter of the branch, with larger branches resulting in reduced gripping ability. To control descent, especially down large diameter branches, some arboreal animals such as squirrels have evolved highly mobile ankle joints that permit rotating the foot into a 'reversed' posture. This allows the claws to hook into the rough surface of the bark, opposing the force of gravity. Small size provides many advantages to arboreal species: such as increasing the relative size of branches to the animal, lower center of mass, increased stability, lower mass (allowing movement on smaller branches) and the ability to move through more cluttered habitat. Size relating to weight affects gliding animals such as the sugar glider. Some species of primate, bat and all species of sloth achieve passive stability by hanging beneath the branch. Both pitching and tipping become irrelevant, as the only method of failure would be losing their grip.|$|E
