5|$|In Half-Life, players usually fight {{alone and}} only {{occasionally}} encounter friendly non-player characters who assist them, such as security guards and scientists. While Decay still features levels {{where this is}} the <b>case,</b> <b>significant</b> sections in Decay are dedicated to working with friendly non-player characters, usually escorting them to various objectives and protecting them in firefights. An array of enemy characters from Half-Life populate the game, including alien lifeforms such as headcrabs and Vortigaunts, as well as human soldiers sent in to contain the alien threat. The players {{have access to a}} limited selection of Half-Lifes weaponry to assist them in the game. Although developed after Opposing Force, no non-player characters or weapons from the earlier expansion appear in Decay.|$|E
500|$|It is {{possible}} that the marriage with Elisiv had been agreed to already during Harald's first time in Rus', or that they at least had been acquainted. During his service in the Byzantine Empire, Harald composed a love poem which included the verse [...] "Yet the goddess in Russia/ will not accept my gold rings" [...] (whom Snorri Sturluson identifies with Elisiv), although Morkinskinna claims that Harald had to remind Yaroslav of the promised marriage when he returned to Kiev. According to the same source, Harald had spoken with Yaroslav during his first time in Rus', requesting to marry Elisiv, only to be rejected because he was not yet wealthy enough. It is in any <b>case</b> <b>significant</b> that Harald was allowed to marry the daughter of Yaroslav, since his other children were married to figures such as Henry I of France, Andrew I of Hungary and the daughter of Constantine IX.|$|E
50|$|Critical mass {{experiments}} {{determine the}} quantity of fissile material required for criticality {{with a variety of}} fissile material compositions, densities, shapes, and reflectors. They can be sub-critical or super-critical, in which <b>case</b> <b>significant</b> radiation fluxes can be produced. This type of test resulted in several criticality accidents.|$|E
50|$|Surgery for {{scoliosis}} {{is performed}} by a surgeon specializing in spine surgery. For various reasons, it is usually impossible to completely straighten a scoliotic spine, but in most <b>cases,</b> <b>significant</b> corrections are achieved.|$|R
50|$|In several {{districts of}} Paris, people were {{allegedly}} illegally registered on the electoral rolls {{in an attempt}} to modify the outcome of elections. In some egregious <b>cases,</b> <b>significant</b> numbers of people were registered at the address of a hotel or of a shop.|$|R
50|$|There are {{a variety}} of {{software}} tools available today to support systematic testing within an organization.

5000|$|It is {{important}} that the line is not rigid, in which <b>case</b> <b>significant</b> force would be lost in the bending of the line tightly around the cylinder. (The equation must be modified for this case.) For instance a Bowden cable is to some extent rigid and doesn't obey the principles of the Capstan equation.|$|E

In constitutional cases, {{not only are the}} actual facts of the <b>case</b> <b>significant</b> but the surrounding social, economic and political facts are equally significant. A shift in these latter factors is as important in deciding a case as any other change in the facts. It is this consideration that Chief Justice Duff ignored.|$|E
5000|$|A {{mutant protein}} is the protein product encoded by a gene with mutation. Mutated protein can have single amino acid change (minor, but still in many <b>cases</b> <b>significant</b> change leading to disease) or {{wide-range}} amino acid changes by e.g. truncation of C-terminus after introducing premature stop codon.|$|R

In the latter <b>case,</b> <b>significant</b> numbers of London's A&R men had {{contacted}} Gillett's studio {{by the time he had}} finished playing the song — sending Dire Straits on their journey to global stardom.|$|E
50|$|In either <b>case</b> <b>significant</b> {{amounts of}} code to manage records must be {{provided}} in protected routines to ensure file integrity. An alternate to a Record-oriented file is a stream. In a stream file, in which the file system treats files as an unstructured sequence of bytes.

This approach significantly reduces the size {{and complexity of the}} library and reduces the number of utilities required to maintain files.|$|E

50|$|Various {{movement}} disorders {{can result}} in the inability to walk independently, necessitating {{the use of a}} gait trainer. Such motor disability may be due to a medical condition from childhood, such as cerebral palsy, spina bifida, or other developmental disabilities. Or, walking impairment may be due to a later injury or illness, such as a traumatic brain injury, incomplete spinal cord injury or stroke. Regardless of the cause of disability, the child or adult may learn to walk, or recover the ability to walk, through walking practice. Recent discoveries in the field of neuroplasticity indicate the human potential for improvement in motor skills through activity-based therapy, despite neural damage from condition or injury. Although total independence in gait may not be achieved in every <b>case,</b> <b>significant</b> gains can be made in muscle strength and neuromotor control for walking, through locomotor training.|$|E
30|$|The most {{interesting}} associations {{were found in}} the triple-positive vs. triple-negative <b>cases.</b> <b>Significant</b> elevation was found in case of E 2 /SHBG, E 1 S, E 1 S/E 1 and TE in the fourth quartile with a significant trend. Serum AD also showed significantly elevated OR in the third quartile but the trend was not seen. The OR of BMI decreased remarkably without any trend (Table  2).|$|R

In this <b>case,</b> <b>significant</b> lightening ΔL* and a high total colour difference ΔE* were observed.

40|$|The {{prospects}} of creating positron–electron plasmas confined in a stellarator are discussed.

40|$|The {{feasibility}} of using diffuse reflectance {{in combination with}} Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy to obtain information on cured graphite fiber reinforced polymeric matrix resin composites was investigated. Several graphite/epoxy, polysulfone, and polyimide composites exposed to thermal or radiation environments were examined. An experimental polyimide-sulfone adhesive tape was also studied during processing.
