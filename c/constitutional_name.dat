5|$|A poll {{following}} the 2008 summit showed that 82.5 percent of citizens surveyed opposed changing the <b>constitutional</b> <b>name</b> {{in order to}} join NATO. Elections were called {{following the}} 2008 summit, resulting in further support for the centre-right pro-NATO party, VMRO-DPMNE. The elections were marred by violence that was criticized by NATO members. Ethnic tensions have persisted in Macedonia, and NATO has called for dialogue following clashes {{such as those in}} the city of Kumanovo in 2015, which were blamed in part on the delay in NATO and European integration. NATO membership in general is supported by 81 percent according to a November 2014 poll. On 12 June 2017, Prime Minister Zoran Zaev signaled that he will consider alternatives names for the country in order to strike a compromise with Greece, settle the naming dispute, and lift Greek objections to Macedonia joining the alliance. Zaev also floated the idea of Macedonia joining the alliance under the provisional name it uses at the United Nations.|$|E

25|$|Greek {{objections}} likewise held up {{the wider}} international recognition of the Republic of Macedonia. Although the Republic applied for membership of the United Nations on 30 July 1992, its application languished in diplomatic limbo for nearly a year. A few states—Bulgaria, Turkey, Slovenia, Croatia, Belarus and Lithuania—recognized the republic under its <b>constitutional</b> <b>name</b> before its admission to the United Nations. Most, however, waited {{to see what the}} United Nations would do. The delay had a serious effect on the Republic, as it led to a worsening of its already precarious economic and political conditions. With war raging in nearby Bosnia and Herzegovina and in Croatia, the need to ensure the country's stability became an urgent priority for the international community. The deteriorating security situation led to the UN's first-ever preventative peacekeeping deployment in December 1992, when units of the United Nations Protection Force deployed to monitor possible border violations from Serbia.|$|E
50|$|The Act {{came into}} effect on 19 May 1938 {{pursuant}} to a Treasury Order. One of the Act's effects was to throw into doubt whether Irish citizens were still British subjects. Legal arguments were raised {{that as the}} Constitution of Ireland declared Ireland a sovereign independent state, {{the passing of the}} Act which recognised one of the Irish state’s <b>constitutional</b> <b>names,</b> also recognised its sovereignty. Notably, these arguments were raised in the Murray v Parkes case, 1942.|$|R
5000|$|The frigates were {{originally}} {{designated by the}} letters A through F until March 1795, when Secretary of War, Timothy Pickering, prepared a list of ten suggested names for the ships. President Washington was responsible for selecting five of the names: Constitution, United States, President, and Congress, each of which represented a principle of the United States Constitution, together with Constellation which derived from the blazon of the Arms of the United States, [...] "13 stars, forming a constellation." [...] The sixth frigate, Chesapeake, remained nameless until 1799, when Secretary of the Navy, Benjamin Stoddert, designated her a namesake of the Chesapeake Bay, ignoring the previous <b>Constitutional</b> <b>naming</b> protocol.|$|R

25|$|In due course, {{the same}} {{convention}} {{was adopted by}} many other international organisations and states but they did so independently, not {{as the result of}} being instructed by the UN. For its part, Greece did not adopt the UN terminology at this stage and did not recognise the Republic under any name. The rest of the international community did not immediately recognise the Republic, but this did eventually happen at the end of 1993 and start of 1994. The People's Republic of China was the first major power to act, recognising the Republic under its <b>constitutional</b> <b>name</b> on 13 October 1993. On 16 December 1993, two weeks before Greece was due to take up the European Community presidency, six key EC countries—Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom—recognised the Republic under its UN designation. Other EC countries followed suit in quick succession {{and by the end of}} December, all EC member states except Greece had recognised the Republic. Japan, Russia and the United States followed suit on 21 December 1993, 3 February 1994, and 9 February 1994 respectively.|$|E

500|$|At the 2008 Bucharest summit, Greece {{blocked a}} {{proposed}} invitation because it believed that its neighbor's <b>constitutional</b> <b>name</b> implies territorial aspirations toward its own region of Greek Macedonia. NATO nations {{agreed that the}} country would receive an invitation upon resolution of the Macedonia naming dispute. Macedonia sued Greece at the International Court of Justice (ICJ) over their veto of Macedonia's NATO membership. The ICJ ruled in December 2011 that Greece was wrong to have blocked its neighbor's bid, finding them in breach of a 1995 interim accord that allowed Macedonia to join international organizations under the name [...] "the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia", which is how NATO, {{with the exception of}} Turkey, recognizes their bid. Greece also blocks Macedonia's accession to the European Union over the naming dispute. In March 2016, Macedonian Defense Minister Zoran Jolevski stated his hope that his country's handling of the European migrant crisis might bring it closer to NATO membership.|$|E

2500|$|The {{inhabitants}} of the Republic of Macedonia are overwhelmingly opposed to changing the country's name. A June 2007 opinion poll found that 77 per cent of the population were against {{a change in the}} country's <b>constitutional</b> <b>name,</b> and 72 per cent supported the Republic's accession to NATO only if it was admitted under its <b>constitutional</b> <b>name.</b> Only 8 per cent supported accession under the reference [...] "the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia".|$|E
2500|$|A {{number of}} states {{recognise}} the Republic of Macedonia by its <b>constitutional</b> <b>name.</b> A few had recognised it by this name from the start, while most others had switched from recognising it under its UN reference. By September 2007, 118 countries (61% of all UN member states) had recognised the Republic of Macedonia under its <b>constitutional</b> <b>name.</b> Some observers had suggested that the gradual revision of the Greek position means that [...] "the question appears destined to die" [...] in due course. On the other hand, attempts by the Republic to persuade international organisations to drop the provisional reference have met with limited success. A recent example was the rejection by the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe of a draft proposal to replace the provisional reference with the <b>constitutional</b> <b>name</b> in Council of Europe documents.|$|E

2500|$|The {{compromise}} {{reference is}} always used in relations when states not recognising the <b>constitutional</b> <b>name</b> are present.

2500|$|The dispute has {{escalated}} to {{the highest}} level of international mediation, involving numerous attempts to achieve a resolution. In 1995, the two countries formalised bilateral relations and committed to start negotiations on the naming issue, {{under the auspices of the}} United Nations. Until a solution is found, the provisional reference [...] "the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia" [...] (sometimes unofficially abbreviated as FYROM) is used by international organisations and states which do not recognise translations of the <b>constitutional</b> <b>name</b> Republic of Macedonia (Република Македонија, Republika Makedonija). UN members, and the UN as a whole, have agreed to accept any final agreement on a new name resulting from negotiations between the two countries. The parties are represented by Ambassadors Vasko Naumovski and Adamantios Vassilakis, under the mediation of Matthew Nimetz. Nimetz has worked on the issue since 1994.|$|E
2500|$|... 12 July 2007 – The European Parliament {{issues the}} 2006 Progress Report on the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia Both Greece and the Republic declare a [...] "victory" [...] – The report is {{critical}} of the Bilateral Immunity Agreement with the USA (which violates {{the principles of the}} Rome Statute); failures in the implementation of the Badinter principle; the Khaled El-Masri affair; the renaming of Skopje Airport to [...] "Alexander the Great"; and other issues such as environmental protection and neighborly relations. Two proposed amendments referring to Bulgaria and Greece's failure to recognise a Macedonian minority living in these countries, and one referring to the <b>constitutional</b> <b>name</b> Republic of Macedonia, were rejected. On the other hand, the EU reiterated that the naming issue will not be considered in the accession process (although Greece's ability to veto remains intact). EuroMPs from the ruling Greek New Democracy party voted in favor of the resolution; those from the opposition PASOK party voted against.|$|E
2500|$|A major {{obstacle}} for the accession {{process is the}} Republic's still-unresolved objection by Greece over its name. While the country prefers to be called by its <b>constitutional</b> <b>name,</b> Republic of Macedonia, the European Union, in acknowledgment of concerns raised by Greece, has maintained a practice of recognising it only as the [...] "former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia", the compromise [...] "provisional reference" [...] introduced by the United Nations in 1993. Greece, as any other EU country, has veto power against new accessions, and continues to block Macedonian accession unless the naming issue is resolved beforehand. In April 2008, at the NATO summit in Bucharest, Greece rejected all proposals by the Macedonian government and UN mediator Matthew Nimetz – including the name [...] "Republic of Macedonia (Skopje)" [...] – and vetoed Macedonia's accession to NATO. As Macedonia would have also agreed to accede as the [...] "Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia", the Greek veto breached the 1995 Interim Agreement.|$|E
