50|$|Ringing is a {{telecommunication}} {{signal that}} causes a bell or other device to alert a telephone subscriber to an incoming telephone call. Historically, this entailed sending a high-voltage alternating current {{over the telephone}} line to a <b>customer</b> <b>station</b> which contained an electromagnetic bell. It is therefore also {{commonly referred to as}} power ringing, to distinguish it from another signal, audible ringing, which is sent to the originating caller to indicate that the destination telephone is in fact ringing.|$|E
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} is to propose advanced technical and operational techniques to cope with the time variant responses of LMDS wireless communication channels which are largely affected by rain fading. In an LMDS network, due to the random characteristics of rain, a <b>customer</b> <b>station</b> (CS) could sometimes receive signals from a distant interferer, but not from a close by default base station (BTS). Cell-site diversity (CSD) can take advantage of such scenarios and acts as an effective rain fading mitigation scheme. However, detailed analysis of the CS antenna, switching algorithm and access plan when employing CSD has not been carried out. This work proposes some useful components that could be implemented within a CSD scheme to achieve reliable performance...|$|E
40|$|In the {{automotive}} market, geometrical quality {{can often be}} just that competitive edge that attracts the <b>customer.</b> <b>Station</b> cycle time influences plant throughput and required plant investment costs. During product and process development, these two important characteristics are addressed by tolerance analysis and off-line programming. In {{the automotive}} industry, tolerance analysis and off-line programming are basically sequentially applied with only limited interaction. We argue that this partial separation can lead to suboptimal geometrical quality or station cycle time. Targeting the process layout design of a sheet metal assembly station, we argue that geometrical quality and station cycle time often {{are influenced by the}} same set of parameters. In addition, we argue that geometrical quality and station cycle time often are subject to trade-off, i. e. that a certain parameter change influences one characteristic favourably and the other unfavourably. For instance, fixture geometries that are effective in terms of geometrical quality, do often constitute bulky obstacles that have a significant negative influence on station cycle time. Furthermore, welding concepts that favor geometrical quality usually entail longer robotic travel and require lower robot operating speeds...|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} a two-stage tandem queue with single-server first station and multiserver second <b>station.</b> <b>Customers</b> arrive to <b>Station</b> 1 {{according to a}} batch Markovian arrival process (BMAP). A batch may consist of heterogeneous customers. The type of a customer is determined upon completion of a service at <b>Station</b> 1. The <b>customer's</b> type is classified {{based on the number}} of servers required to process the request of the <b>customer</b> at <b>Station</b> 2. If the required number of servers is not available, the customer may leave the system forever or block Station 1 by waiting for the required number of servers. We determine the stationary distribution of the system states at embedded epochs and derive the Laplace-Stieltjes transform of the sojourn time distribution. Some key performance measures are calculated, and illustrative numerical results are presented...|$|R

40|$|Processing cheques {{manually}} is {{been done}} {{for decades and}} more efficient systems are still under research. In this entire processing system, providing a secured transaction with efficient verification is what more important. An instance cheque clearance system is proposed comprising of an unmanned customer and an operator station, and means for providing communication with secure transaction. The <b>customer</b> <b>station</b> includes an OMR scanner to scan a given cheque and a cash dispenser to withdraw the cash. Secure means are provided for enabling the operator to verify {{the identity of the}} cheque bearer by recognizing MICR number, Cheque number, Signature and amount through various techniques. This will be later implemented through MATLAB[Matrix Laboratory]. OCR[Optical Character Recognition] is a method of verifying the cheque number,amount and the MICR [Magnetic Ink Character Recognition] number. Our main aim is to detect whether the cheque is valid or not by verifying the signature and account payee which can be validated using binarization. For customer the signature is fed into the process in which the original images are resized to a specified size and there images are converted to binary values which will be compared with the original signature stored in the bank database. A secret pin number is given by the cheque bearer to check drawer for a secure transaction. The validation process is done using java. This pin number is generated from a kit where the secret number for each cheque is has been saved in a PIC microcontroller as well as the bank database. A keypad is connected to an LCD [Liquid Crystal Display] to which the user can type the cheque number and view its corresponding PIN number in the display. Once the PIN number is verified in the cheque station then the amount can be withdrawn or transacted at the same moment by the user...|$|E
25|$|The first Panel-type exchanges {{were placed}} in service in Newark, New Jersey, on January 16, 1915 at the Mulberry central office, and on June 12 in the Waverly central office.

5000|$|AT&T {{described}} the product as [...] "a method for pushbutton signaling from <b>customer</b> <b>stations</b> using the voice transmission path." [...] In {{order to prevent}} consumer telephones from interfering with the MF-based routing and switching between telephone switching centers, DTMF frequencies differ {{from all of the}} pre-existing MF signaling protocols between switching centers: MF/R1, R2, CCS4, CCS5, and others that were later replaced by SS7 digital signaling. DTMF was known throughout the Bell System by the trademark Touch-Tone. The term was first used by AT&T in commerce on July 5, 1960 and was introduced to the public on November 18, 1963, when the first push-button telephone was made available to the public. It was a registered trademark by AT&T from September 4, 1962 to March 13, 1984. It is standardized by ITU-T Recommendation Q.23. In the UK, it is also known as MF4. In the UK, it is a requirement that the higher frequency tone is 1-4dB Louder than the low frequency tone.|$|R

40|$|We {{consider}} gated polling {{systems with}} two special features: (i) retrials, and (ii) glue or reservation periods. When a type-$i$ customer arrives, or retries, during a glue period of station $i$, {{it will be}} served in the next visit period of the server to that <b>station.</b> <b>Customers</b> arriving at <b>station</b> $i$ in any other period join the orbit of that station and retry after an exponentially distributed time. Such polling systems {{can be used to}} study the performance of certain switches in optical communication systems. For the case of exponentially distributed glue periods, we present an algorithm to obtain the moments of the number of <b>customers</b> in each <b>station.</b> For generally distributed glue periods, we consider the distribution of the total workload in the system, using it to derive a pseudo conservation law which in its turn is used to obtain accurate approximations of the individual mean waiting times. We also consider the problem of choosing the lengths of the glue periods, under a constraint on the total glue period per cycle, so as to minimize a weighted sum of the mean waiting times...|$|R

40|$|We {{consider}} a two-station tandem queue loss model where <b>customers</b> arrive to <b>station</b> 1 {{according to a}} Poisson process. A gatekeeper who has complete knowledge {{of the number of}} <b>customers</b> at both <b>stations</b> decides to accept or reject each arrival. A cost c 1 is incurred if a customer is rejected, while if an admitted <b>customer</b> finds that <b>station</b> 2 is full {{at the time of his}} service completion at station 1, he leaves the system and a cost c 2 is incurred. Assuming exponential service times at both stations, an arbitrary but finite buffer size at station 1 and a buffer size of one at station 2, we show that the optimal admission control policy for minimizing the long-run average cost per unit time has a simple structure. Depending on the value of c 2 compared to a threshold value c∗, it is optimal to admit a customer at the time of his arrival either only if the system is empty or as long as there is space at station 1. We also provide the closed-form expression of c∗, which depends on the service rates at both stations, the arrival rate and c 1.
