40|$|As the {{legislation}} on vehicle emissions {{is becoming more}} and more stringent, increasing attention has been paid to the fine particles emitted by diesel and gasoline vehicles. The high number emission of fine particles has been shown to have a large impact on the atmospheric environment and human health. Researchers have shown that gasoline engines, especially Gasoline Direct Injection (GDI) engines, tend to emit large amounts of small size particles compared to Port Fuel Injection (PFI) gasoline engines and diesel engines fitted with Diesel Particulate Filters (DPFs). As a result, the particle number emissions of GDI engines will be restricted by the EU 6 legislation. The particulate emission level of GDI engines means that they would face some challenges in meeting the EU 6 requirement. This thesis undertakes research in the following area. Firstly, the filtration efficiencies of glass fibre filters were quantified using a Cambustion Differential Mobility Spectrometer 500 (DMS 500) to see if all of the particles from the sampled gas can be collected by the filters. Secondly, various valve timings and different injection modes such as double injection with a second injection after compression, single early injection and split early injection were implemented to measure the Particulate Matter (PM) emissions and combustion characteristics of a GDI engine under warm-up operating conditions. Thirdly, the techniques for removing volatile particles were investigated using a catalytic Volatile Particle Remover (VPR) and an Evaporation Tube (ET) with hot air dilution under various test conditions. The results show that for the glass fibre filters tested here, the transmission efficiencies of the particles are very low, indicating that PM sampling using fibre filters is an effective method of studying the particulate emissions from the engine. Particle number emissions using double injection with injection after compression were much higher than those with single injection during the intake stroke. Under 1200 rpm, 110 Nm <b>cold</b> <b>engine</b> <b>operation,</b> no reduction effect on PM emissions was shown by using split intake injection to further facilitate homogeneous mixture formation compared with single intake injection. Valve timings showed moderate effects on particulate emissions. Properly adjusted timing for exhaust valve closure led to reduced particulate emissions by a factor of about 2 and the combustion characteristics were not adversely affected much. The VPR temperature and exhaust residence time did not show much effect on the catalytic VPR performance once the mass flow rate of exhaust was above 0. 09 g/s. Generally, the transmission efficiencies of the VPR follow the trends of the scaled PMP counting efficiency specification. Hot air dilution is effective in reducing the small size particles. At 23 nm, the transmission efficiencies are within the error range of the PMP specification. The catalytic VPR and the Evaporation Tube were all found to be effective in reducing the particle number of small size (nucleation mode) particles. Both systems have some particle loss mainly due to the physical effects of diffusion and thermophoresis. Until now, GDI engines have not been optimised for reducing particulate emissions as the focus has been on gaseous emissions and fuel economy. With careful re-optimisation of the catalyst light-off and engine calibration (especially for transients) then there is scope for GDI engines to meet forthcoming emissions legislation.

First of all, a comprehensive description of the simulation environment properly tailored for cooling systems modeling is introduced and all its geometric, fluid-dynamic and thermodynamic characteristics are described in depth. Then, the model has been validated through an exhaustive numerical vs. experimental comparison, involving both <b>cold</b> and hot <b>engine</b> <b>operation,</b> {{for a wide range of}} rotational speeds. The general good accordance obtained between calculated and measured results clearly demonstrate the reliability of the numerical model.

40|$|AbstractIn {{an urban}} setting, the <b>cold</b> <b>engine</b> {{pollutant}} emission of vehicles constitutes a important fraction of total pollutant emission. Cold start emission {{is difficult to}} estimate, as {{it depends on the}} local fraction of vehicles running on <b>cold</b> <b>engines.</b> In principle knowledge of this fraction requires the knowledge of travelers’ activity plans. The paper proposes a different approach: to use parking data, and parking dynamics, in order to estimate the volume of traffic running on <b>cold</b> <b>engine</b> which is generated in any link at any time. A macroscopic traffic flow model, derived from the GSOM family (generic second order modeling), is used to propagate the flow of vehicles running on <b>cold</b> <b>engines.</b> The model is dynamic, it is compatible with cross-entropy dynamic assignment, and can thus be used with various levels of data availability. The main innovations of the paper are: the GSOM model with cold emission travel time as an attribute, the parking in/outflow model, and the use of parking dynamics for the estimation of cold start emission...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe proper {{strategy}} of internal combustion <b>engine</b> <b>operation</b> {{is one of}} the basic aims being taken into account in a design process, in a phase of building the first design of a specified engine, verification of geometrical and operational parameters for a real object (comparing to a brief foredesign) to the moment when one obtains the final design of the engine. This particular purpose of such process is also important during combustion <b>engine</b> <b>operation</b> in a stationary or traction applications. Undoubtedly, the assessment of the main processes taking place in such engines, especially combustion processes runs, in {{the point of view of}} the correct diagnosis and <b>engine</b> <b>operation</b> management, is convergent with present and future combustion engines design trends and with the world environment protection requirements. That is why the paper concerns the assessment of a combustion process correctness in a direct injection compression-ignition engine on the basis of vibration signal runs and their digital processing. The method of such diagnosis was implemented to identify quality and quantity changes of main processes characteristics and diagnostic parameters regarding with <b>engine</b> work conditions, <b>operation</b> time and with some problems appearing in specified engine working cycles. The paper gives scientific solutions for precise diagnosis of combustion process correctness and some failures that could take place in combustion of compression-ignition and direct injection engines.
