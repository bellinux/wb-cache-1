Results indicate that, because the non-conventional GPS observations are directly assimilated into the initial analyses by 3 DVAR system, better initial elds and 24 -h simulation for the severe precipitation event are achieved than those under the MM 5 /LitterR objective analysis scheme. Further analysis also shows that the individual component of <b>meteorological</b> <b>observation</b> network plays their special positive role in the improvement of initial eld analysis and forecasting skills. 3 DVAR scheme with or without radiosonde and pilot observation has the most signicant in uence on numerical simulation, and automatic and conventional surface <b>meteorological</b> <b>observations</b> rank second. After acquiring the supplement information from the other <b>meteorological</b> <b>observations,</b> the ground-based GPS precipitable water vapor data can more obviously re ect initial eld assimilation and precipitation forecast.
