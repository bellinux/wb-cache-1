40|$|To {{examine the}} {{mechanisms}} of holo-caeruloplasmin biosynthesis, we measured the serum <b>caeruloplasmin</b> concentration and oxidase activity, hepatic <b>caeruloplasmin</b> mRNA content and hepatocyte <b>caeruloplasmin</b> biosynthesis and secretion in normal and copper-deficient rats. Copper deficiency resulted in a near-complete loss of serum <b>caeruloplasmin</b> oxidase activity, yet only a 60 % reduction in serum <b>caeruloplasmin</b> concentration and {{no change in the}} abundance of hepatic <b>caeruloplasmin</b> mRNA or the rate of <b>caeruloplasmin</b> biosynthesis. Both interleukin- 1 alpha and lipopolysaccharide increased hepatic <b>caeruloplasmin</b> mRNA content and <b>caeruloplasmin</b> biosynthesis in normal and copper-deficient animals, but neither mediator increased <b>caeruloplasmin</b> oxidase activity in the copper-deficient group. Pulse-chase studies in primary hepatocytes from normal and copper-deficient rats revealed that the secretory rates for newly synthesized <b>caeruloplasmin</b> were identical, despite little or no holo-caeruloplasmin synthesis in hepatocytes of copper-deficient rats. We conclude that hepatocyte copper content has no effect on hepatic caeruloplasmin-gene expression or <b>caeruloplasmin</b> biosynthesis and that the incorporation of copper into newly synthesized <b>caeruloplasmin</b> is not a rate-limiting step in the biosynthesis or secretion of the apoprotein from rat hepatocytes...|$|E
40|$|Aim—To {{investigate}} the neonatal diagnosis of Wilson's disease from <b>caeruloplasmin</b> isoforms in cord blood.  METHODS—Serum <b>caeruloplasmin</b> isoforms were measured in 5 - 10 ml cord blood from 10 fresh umbilical cords using sodium dodecyl {{polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis}} (SDS PAGE) and western blotting and analysed by densitometry. Total <b>caeruloplasmin</b> concentrations were determined by nephelometry and <b>caeruloplasmin</b> oxidase by p-nitrophenyldiamine.  RESULTS—Although total <b>caeruloplasmin</b> concentrations are reduced in neonates, the plasma isoform was significantly reduced or absent in patients with Wilson's disease.

We have demonstrated transcription of <b>caeruloplasmin</b> mRNA by a well-differentiated human uterine epithelial adenocarcinoma cell line, Ishikawa, and by human uterine endometrium and purified endometrial glands. Identical CP- 2 nucleotide sequences were obtained for partial <b>caeruloplasmin</b> transcripts from human liver and Ishikawa cells, indicating that CP- 2 transcripts are produced by uterine epithelial lining cells. The synthesis of <b>caeruloplasmin</b> protein was demonstrated for Ishikawa cells and another uterine adenocarcinoma cell line, ECC 1. Peptide-mapping analysis indicated that <b>caeruloplasmin</b> secreted by Ishikawa cells was structurally identical with the protein synthesized by the human hepatoblastoma cell line HepG 2. The secretion of a 135, 000 -M(r) <b>caeruloplasmin</b> by Ishikawa and ECC 1 cells, comparable {{with that of the}} human hepatoblastoma cell line, HepG 2, indicated similar processing of uterine and hepatic <b>caeruloplasmin.</b> Incorporation of 67 Cu into <b>caeruloplasmin</b> was demonstrated for Ishikawa and ECC 1 cells, suggesting that the human uterus produces a bioactive form of <b>caeruloplasmin</b> and possesses the necessary metal transporters and intracellular machinery for copper incorporation into this protein...|$|E

40|$|Hormonally {{produced}} {{changes in}} the synthesis and secretion of the serum copper-containing protein <b>caeruloplasmin</b> were studied in primary cultures of rat liver parenchymal cells isolated by the collagenase-perfusion technique. A rabbit antibody directed against rat <b>caeruloplasmin</b> was used to immunoprecipitate labelled <b>caeruloplasmin.</b> Isolated liver cells synthesized and secreted <b>caeruloplasmin</b> {{over a period of}} 3 days. Synthesis and secretion of this protein was enhanced when cells were treated with dexamethasone. The accumulation of copper was also moderately enhanced with glucocorticoid treatment. Inclusion of adrenaline in the culture medium resulted in elevated incorporation of copper into newly synthesized <b>caeruloplasmin</b> as well as an increase in 64 Cu-labelled <b>caeruloplasmin</b> in the culture medium. However, adrenaline did not seem to increase the secretion of 3 H-labelled protein, despite the elevation in secreted 64 Cu-caeruloplasmin. This may be due to a large increase in the intracellular pool of 64 Cu caused by enhanced accumulation of this metal when adrenaline is included in the incubation medium. Enhanced copper accumulation was also seen when cells were treated with glucagon. Adrenaline-stimulated accumulation of 64 Cu could be inhibited by including phenoxybenzamine, an alpha-adrenergic blocker, in the culture medium.

40|$|To {{understand}} the role of copper in initiating protein alterations in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) as reported previously, concentrations of copper anc <b>caeruloplasmin</b> were determined in RA patients. The mean copper concentration of the RA population examined was 24. 8 mumol/l (157. 5 mug/ 100 ml), and the mean <b>caeruloplasmin</b> concentration in this RA population was 45. 52 mg/ 100 ml. These values are not different from those reported by previous workers. However, when the RA population was divided into three groups according to sex and oestrogen therapy {{it was found that}} <b>caeruloplasmin</b> and copper concentrations in the group of female RA patients on oestrogens was significantly different from other groups (P less than 0. 001). A highly significant (P less than 0. 01) positive correlation was obtained between copper and <b>caeruloplasmin</b> concentrations (r = 0. 91). Concentrations of copper and <b>caeruloplasmin</b> failed to explain the low sulphydryl content of plasma which was observed to be independent of these two parameters. Increased alpha 2 -globulin concentration, which was refractory to chrysotherapy but 'finger-printed' with a pure preparation of <b>caeruloplasmin</b> in electrophoresis, along with the absence of Kayser-Fleischer rings, supports the contention that copper is not present in a free ionic state in RA patients. This study shows that only a concurrent oestrogen therapy raises copper and <b>caeruloplasmin</b> concentration significantly in a female RA population. Past investigators appear to have overlooked this fact, and it could be that a disproportionate sex distribution (more female rheumatoid arthritics) could cause misleading results in RA studies. The role of oestrogens, copper, and <b>caeruloplasmin</b> in causing exacerbation of RA symptoms is discussed...|$|E
40|$|Investigation {{of copper}} status {{can be a}} {{diagnostic}} challenge. The non‐caeruloplasmin‐bound copper (NCC) has deficiencies; accordingly, the copper:caeruloplasmin ratio has been suggested as an alternative index of copper status.

In addition to making the interpretation of copper easier, the copper:caeruloplasmin ratio should also enable adjustment for relatively high <b>caeruloplasmin</b> concentrations without recourse to producing gender‐ and age‐derived intervals. The copper:caeruloplasmin ratio has weaknesses similar to those identified for NCC in that immunological methods used for <b>caeruloplasmin</b> can cross react with apocaeruloplasmin {{and there is no}} standardised method for <b>caeruloplasmin.</b> <b>Caeruloplasmin</b> assays also have uncertainty from precision, bias and specificity and, accordingly, method‐related differences may have a large effect on the copper:caeruloplasmin ratio {{in a manner similar to}} the NCC...|$|E

40|$|AbstractLDL {{oxidation}} {{within the}} arterial wall {{may contribute to}} the disease of atherosclerosis. There is some evidence that elevated plasma levels of copper are associated with an increased risk of coronary artery disease.

Low concentrations of CuSO 4 (< 1 μM) could catalyse the macrophagemediated modification of LDL. Native <b>caeruloplasmin</b> was unable to catalyse the modification of LDL at pH 7. 4, but could do so after preincubation at acidic pH. After preincubation at acidic pH, concentrations of <b>caeruloplasmin</b> as low as 30 μgml (about one-tenth of the human plasma level) could catalyse significant LDL oxidation when added to macrophages.

40|$|Indian Childhood Cirrhosis (ICC) is {{associated}} with excessive copper ingestion and hepatic deposition, is preventable by preventing copper ingestion and is partially treatable by copper chelation. However, copper administration causes only minimal hepatic damage in the rat and an acute rather than chronic liver injury in sheep. The hypothesis is explored that a second hepatic insult is synergistic with copper in causing cirrhosis. D-galactosamine was administered, to control rats and to rats orally dosed with copper acetate, to induce an acute hepatic injury documented by serum transaminases and liver histology. Surprisingly, copper-dosed rats (liver copper 607 + 129 ug/g, controls 48 + 7) were resistant to galactosamine-induced injury. Oral copper reduced the quantitative faecal anaerobical 1 y cultured bacterial count, suggesting that reduction in gut-derived portal vein endotoxin may explain the protective effect. Using the carbon tetrachloride model, copper again ameliorated, rather than aggravated, the hepatic injury. Impaired prostaglandin or leukotriene synthesis are discussed as possible mechanisms. To evaluate a possible disorder of copper transport in ICC, copper distribution amongst human serum proteins was investigated. In normal adults, copper was associated with <b>caeruloplasmin</b> (71 + 4 %), "transcuprein" (7 + 2 %), albumin (19 + 4 %) and with amino acids (2 + 3 %). <b>Caeruloplasmin</b> and caeruloplasmin-copper concentrations were low in neonates and symptomatic Wilson's disease. In contrast to the neonate, Wilson's disease exhibited raised total serum copper and non-caeruloplasmin-copper. In ICC, serum levels of <b>caeruloplasmin</b> and caeruloplasmin-copper were normal, but transcuprein- and albumin-bound copper were elevated. Raised concentrations of non-caeruloplasmin-copper in ICC and Wilson's disease perhaps represent overspill into the serum from a copper-laden liver. In serum from children with malignancy, copper and <b>caeruloplasmin</b> concentrations were high as previously reported. Unexpectedly transcuprein- and albumin-bound copper were also markedly elevated. It is to be determined whether this results from tissue catabolism of <b>caeruloplasmin</b> or from increased hepatic <b>caeruloplasmin</b> synthesis and copper turnover. <b>Caeruloplasmin</b> gene expression was investigated in adult and neonatal rat liver, {{to determine whether the}} copper profile seen in neonates results from a pre-translational defect in <b>caeruloplasmin</b> synthesis. Detection of mRNA in samples of Northern blotted polyadenylated RNA, using a 32 P-labelled <b>caeruloplasmin</b> cDNA probe, demonstrated that the mRNA species isolated from the neonates was not different from that in the adults, with an apparent size of 4400 nucleotides.

On {{the assumption that the}} binding of <b>caeruloplasmin</b> could reflect a greater need for copper, we sought to determine whether the transfer of 67 Cu from <b>caeruloplasmin</b> was accelerated in haemin-induced compared with non-induced K 562 cells. Cu,Zn superoxide dismutase (CuZnSOD) was the recipient. Haemin induction caused the K 562 cells to lose CuZnSOD activity. By 96 h, the level of SOD activity was less than 60 % of that of non-induced cells. The loss was confined entirely to the CuZn form, MnSOD activity staying essentially unchanged. Although CuZnSOD activity declined with the haemin induction, the incorporation of [4, 5 - 3 H]lysine into immunoprecipitable CuZnSOD protein was unaffected. There was also no change in CuZnSOD mRNA concentration in haemin-induced cells. Thus a loss of enzyme did not correlate with a decline in the synthesis de novo of CuZnSOD protein. When 48 h-induced cells were transferred to a medium supplemented with 0. 2 microM-caeruloplasmin, CuZnSOD activity was restored to control levels in 24 h. <b>Caeruloplasmin</b> also stimulated the incorporation of [3 H]lysine into immunoprecipitable CuZnSOD protein. <b>Caeruloplasmin</b> addition may have affected a post-translational regulatory site for CuZnSOD biosynthesis, possibly by providing copper for the newly synthesized enzyme...|$|E

Mobility-shift analysis using an oligonucleotide encoding this region identified specific binding of proteins from rat liver nuclear extract, {{and some of these}} complexes were supershifted using antisera to the C/EBP alpha and beta family members. Mobility-shift studies using a polypeptide encoding the DNA-binding domain of C/EBP alpha also revealed a specific interaction with this region of the <b>caeruloplasmin</b> promoter, and DNAase I footprinting using this polypeptide protected the identical region from - 93 to - 48. Co-transfection of expression plasmids encoding C/EBP alpha or a related leucine-zipper factor D-binding protein (DBP) revealed a C/EBP-specific increase in reporter gene activity in HepG 2 cells transfected with caeruloplasmin-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase containing the - 93 to - 48 region. A similar result was obtained when these constructs were co-transfected into mouse L cells which were shown not to express the endogenous <b>caeruloplasmin</b> gene.

In this paper we have investigated the role of copper and <b>caeruloplasmin</b> in the abnormal biliary copper transport and characterizes Wilson's disease. Using SDS/PAGE and Western blotting, we have demonstrated the presence of holocaeruloplasmin in liver samples from patients with Wilson's disease (abnormal biliary copper excretion) and in control patients (normal biliary copper excretion). The presence of holocaeruloplasmin was also confirmed by measurement of <b>caeruloplasmin</b> oxidase activity using staining with o'Dianisidine. In contrast with the findings in liver tissue, holocaeruloplasmin was absent from bile from patients with Wilson's disease, but as expected it was present in the bile from control subjects.

In conclusion, we have demonstrated that copper incorporation in <b>caeruloplasmin</b> is normal in patients with Wilson's disease contrary to previous reports. Secondly, we have shown that the defect in Wilson's disease appears to lie in the biliary canalicular excretion of holocaeruloplasmin resulting in its retention within the hepatocyte causing copper toxicosis.

40|$|A {{comparative}} {{study has been}} carried out of the oxidation of 5 -hydroxytryptamine and related compounds by the oxidase present in the gill plates of Mytilus edulis and of <b>caeruloplasmin,</b> the copper containing oxidase of mammalian plasma. Both preparations oxidized indole derivatives carrying a hydroxyl group in the 4 -, 5 -, 6 -, or 7 - position. The oxidation of bufoteni ne was compared with that of its 4 - and 6 -hydroxy analogues; the 4 -hydroxy analogue is psil ocine, a naturally occurring hallucinogenic compound. Bufotenine and the 6 -hydroxy analogue were oxidized by both preparations with the formation of brown pigments; psilocine was more rapidly oxidized with the appearance of a blue colour. 4 -Hydroxytryptamine and 7 -hydroxytryptamine were also oxidized, the former with the formation of a blue compound. The N- 1 -methyl derivatives of both bufotenine and psilocine were also oxidized. The Mytilus preparation acted also on 4 -, 5 -, and 7 -hydroxytryptophan and on 5 -hydroxyindole, none of which was oxidized by <b>caeruloplasmin.</b> The Mytilus enzyme also oxidized 5 -hydroxyindoleacetic acid. Paraphenylenediamine, a very good substrate of <b>caeruloplasmin,</b> was much more slowly oxidized by the gill plate enzyme. The evidence suggests that the two enzymes catalyse the same reactions, but that the substrate specificity of the mammalian oxidase is somewhat more restricted. Both enzymes are “hydroxyindole oxidases,” not specific for 5 -hydroxyindoles alone. Inhibitors of the Mytilus oxidase included inhibitors of copper enzymes but not edetate or carbon monoxide. The action of pig serum on 5 -hydroxytryptamine was due to <b>caeruloplasmin</b> and not to amine oxidase...|$|E
40|$|Abstract The study {{objective}} was to evaluate the effect of occupational lead exposure on blood concentrations of zinc, iron, copper, selenium and proteins related to them, such as transferrin, <b>caeruloplasmin</b> and haptoglobin. The examined group consisted of 192 healthy male employees of zinc–lead works. By the degree of lead exposure, the exposed group was subdivided into three subgroups. The control group was composed of 73 healthy male administrative workers. The markers of lead exposure (blood levels of lead and zinc protoporphyrin) were significantly elevated in the exposed group compared with the control group. Additionally, con-centrations of copper and <b>caeruloplasmin</b> were raised. The significant increase in haptoglobin level was observed only in the low exposure group. Selenium levels were signifi-cantly decreased, whereas iron, zinc and transferrin levels were unchanged in the exposed group compared with the control group. There were positive correlations between the lead toxicity parameters and the copper and <b>caeruloplasmin</b> levels. In conclusion, the effect of occupational exposure to lead on the metabolism of trace metals appears to be limited. However, significant associations between lead exposure and levels of copper and selenium were shown. Changed levels of positive acute-phase proteins, such as caeruloplas-min and haptoglobin, were also observed...|$|E
40|$|Serum {{copper and}} thiol levels an <b>caeruloplasmin</b> {{activity}} were determined and compared with measurements of articular index, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and zinc and haemoglobin levels {{in patients with}} rheumatoid arthritis. Superoxide dismutase activity, thiol, zinc, and copper levels of haemolysate were measured and compared {{with each other and}} to the above parameters. In serum, <b>caeruloplasmin</b> activity increased and thiol levels decreased, whereas in the haemolysate superoxide dismutase activity decreased and thiol levels increased. It is suggested that the changes in copper levels and in the activities of process which may be copper-dependent between plasma and cytosol in patients with rheumatoid arthritis reflect a change in oxidative status of the blood which may have implications in the pathogenesis of the disease...|$|E
40|$|A novel {{method is}} {{reported}} for isolation of bovine <b>caeruloplasmin</b> from plasma; {{it involves a}} rapid and mild procedure, namely two column chromatographies with stepwise elution and one (NH 4) 2 SO 4 precipitation, and results in a proteolytically undegraded homogeneous protein. The general structure of the protein, as evaluated by molecular-weight determination and amino acid composition, {{is very similar to}} that established for human and rat <b>caeruloplasmin.</b> Copper determination and e. p. r. spectral analysis on the native and NO-treated protein gave a metal-to-protein stoichiometry of six atoms of copper per molecule. Three copper atoms were detectable by e. p. r., with Type 2 /Type 1 ratio = 1 : 3 in most samples. The protein is very sensitive to storage and/or handling. A component was isolated from aged samples, which was found to contain approximately four copper atoms per 125000 daltons, two of which were detectable by e. p. r. with the characters of Type 2 copper. However, the same component was found to be present, although to a lesser extent, in the fresh preparation and {{does not seem to be}} related to proteolytic degradation. This component has no oxidase activity. On the basis of these results it is suggested that <b>caeruloplasmin</b> molecules are intrinsically heterogeneous with respect to both copper content and copper type, and this can explain the intriguing stoichiometry regarding the different types of copper centres...|$|E
