Identity in the city, through the creation and association with “public memories ” of citizens causes the sense of interest and dependence which leads the inhabitants of the city toward becoming a citizen, which is a more active level of being just inhabitants. Although the identity is the effect of the culture of its citizens, it affects the process of becoming a citizen and can cause the formulation of criteria related to the participation and judging of observers and residents. Urban identity is a reflection of all the local people’s traditions, culture and aspirations grouped together. It reflects their needs, successes, failures and future. Constricted, the city is understood and interpreted through the technical rather than the sensory, yet it is the sensory from which people build their feeling and emotion. Sensuous requirements may <b>coincide</b> <b>or</b> <b>conflict</b> <b>with</b> other demands but cannot be separated from them in designing or judging urban spaces. The static physical setting, activities and meaning constituted three basic elements of urban identity places. Since place identity is a sub-structure of the self-identity of person consisting of broadly conceived cognitions about the world in which the individual lives. These cognitions represent memories, ideas, values, meanings and conceptions of behavior and experience. This study investigates and compares basic elements of urban identity in Zanjan city entrances with using Analytical Hierarchy Process Method and the proposed recommendations for the increase identity...|$|R
40|$|Visual form {{analysis}} {{is fundamental to}} shape perception and likely plays {{a central role in}} perception of more complex dynamic shapes, such as moving objects or biological motion. Two primary form-based cues serve to represent the overall shape of an object: the spatial position and the orientation of locations along the boundary of the object. However, it is unclear how the visual system integrates these two sources of information in dynamic form analysis, and in particular how the brain resolves ambiguities due to sensory uncertainty and/or cue conflict. In the current study, we created animations of sparsely-sampled dynamic objects (human walkers or rotating squares) comprised of oriented Gabor patches in which orientation could either <b>coincide</b> <b>or</b> <b>conflict</b> <b>with</b> information provided by position cues. When the cues were incongruent, we found a characteristic trade-off between position and orientation information whereby position cues increasingly dominated perception as the relative uncertainty of orientation increased and vice versa. Furthermore, we found no evidence for differences in the visual processing of biological and non-biological objects, casting doubt on the claim that biological motion may be specialized in the human brain, at least in specific terms of form analysis. To explain these behavioral results quantitatively, we adopt a probabilistic template-matching model that uses Bayesian inference within local modules to estimate object shape separately from either spatial position or orientation signals. The outputs of the two modules are integrated with weights that reflect individual estimates of subjective cue reliability, and integrated over time to produce a decision about the perceived dynamics of the input data. Results of this model provided a close fit to the behavioral data, suggesting a mechanism in the human visual system that approximates rational Bayesian inference to integrate position and orientation signals in dynamic form analysis...|$|R
40|$|Broadly, {{this thesis}} is {{concerned}} with the symbolic meanings and values of places. In particular, my primary concern is to find out the meanings and values of religious buildings for different groups of people and I have chosen to examine-this using multi-religious but officially secular Singapore as a case study. Specifically, my study objectives are as follows: first, to find out the symbolic meanings and values of religious buildings for individuals of the major religious groups in Singapore, namely the Muslims, Christians, Hindus and 'Chinese religionists'; second, to analyse the state's conceptions of religious buildings in Singapore and the roles it plays in shaping religious landscapes; and third, to examine {{the extent to which the}} state's conceptions of religious places <b>coincide,</b> complement <b>or</b> <b>conflict</b> <b>with</b> the meanings invested by religious individuals and groups, and with what effect. The central argument of my thesis is that individuals invest a multitude of meanings in their religious buildings which are intensely sacred, personal and social in nature. Conversely, there are two levels at which the state deals with religious buildings. They are political symbols in that they are used to endorse political rhetoric about state support for religion. At the same time, religious buildings are also treated within a functionalist framework of planning whereby provisions are made for religious buildings within new towns just as provisions are made for schools, housing, town centres, playgrounds and so forth. Demolition takes place as urban redevelopment takes precedence over other values. When this happens, the state then attempts to use ideologically hegemonic arguments to persuade people that these are natural and rational ways of dealing with religious buildings. Clearly, sacred meanings and personal and social attachments have no place in the state's scheme of things. Individuals are then faced with a situation where they will have to resist and/or cope. I examine both the strategies of resistance and the forms of adaptations adopted by various groups and individuals. In conceptual terms, I draw from four broad research directions. From humanistic geography, I adopt concepts related to human environmental experiences. From the history of religion and the comparative study of religion, I derive conceptual notions of religious experience and religious symbolism. Sociology, political studies and in particular, the 'new' cultural geography, offer useful insights into cultural politics and ideological landscapes. Finally, planning theory provides some of the input necessary to an understanding of the production and annihilation of place. Methodologically, I have used a variety of approaches. These include, first, an extensive questionnaire survey to establish the broad trends in patterns of religious worship in Singapore. Second, in-depth interviews were conducted with a much smaller number of individuals from the various religious groups, including religious functionaries, for more intensive information about meanings and values. Third, official documents and transcripts of public discourses by state representatives were analysed. Together with interviews with some state representatives (planners, bureaucrats and a politician), they allow me to interpret state conceptions of religious places...|$|R
