5|$|In the 1630s, {{the texts}} of these annals were {{compiled}} into a single, enormous compendium, known as the Annals of the Four Masters.

5|$|It {{is known}} {{that a variety of}} {{different}} coins were minted by Edmund's moneyers during his reign. The letters AN, standing for 'Anglia', only appear on the coins of Edmund and Æthelstan of East Anglia: they appear on Edmund's coins as part of the phrase + EADMUND REX AN. Later specimens read + EADMUND REX and so it is possible for his coins to be divided <b>chronologically.</b> Otherwise, no chronology for his coins has been confirmed.|$|E
5|$|Manga-News {{reviewed}} the story arc positively. They praised {{several aspects of}} the story arc: the plot and narration for being captivating and for including famous London settings, references to Sherlock Holmes, and the Wimbledon competition; the characterization for the antagonist Sabara Hades; and the romance between Shinichi and Ran which was described as an event readers had been waiting for. Manga-News however criticized how Shinichi and Ran's interaction were covered by flashbacks instead of happening <b>chronologically.</b> AnimeLand reviewed volume 71 and called it the best since volume 59.|$|E
5|$|Production {{designer}} Arthur Max led the film's design staff.

Giger, and designers Ron Cobb and Chris Foss, including their designs for that film which Scott had been unable to develop at the time.|$|E

5|$|The Piano Concerto No. 24 in C minor, K. 491, is a concerto {{composed}} by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart for keyboard (usually a piano or fortepiano) and orchestra. Mozart composed the concerto {{in the winter}} of 1785–1786, finishing it on 24 March 1786, three weeks after the completion of the Piano Concerto in A major. As Mozart intended to perform the work himself, the soloist's part was not fully written down. The premiere was in early April 1786 at the Burgtheater in Vienna. <b>Chronologically</b> the work is the twentieth of Mozart's 23 original piano concertos.|$|E
5|$|The Wimbledon Championships {{are played}} {{in the last week}} of June and the first week of July, and has been <b>chronologically</b> the third of the four Grand Slam tournaments of the tennis season since 1987.

5|$|The episodes aired from October 7, 2007 to March 23, 2008 on Chiba TV and TV Saitama, {{with the}} episodes later {{broadcast}} on KBS Kyoto, Sun TV, Tokyo MX TV, TV Aichi, TV Hokkaido, TV Kanagawa, and TVQ Kyushu Broadcasting Co. The {{order that the}} episodes air in is nonlinear; for instance, the first episode broadcast is the sixth episode <b>chronologically.</b> The exceptions are episodes four, eight, and episodes sixteen through twenty, which {{are in the same}} broadcast and chronological order.|$|E
5|$|The {{episodes of}} the Japanese anime {{television}} series , officially named Ah! My Goddess: Flights of Fancy in North America, are directed by Hiroaki Gōda, animated by Anime International Company, and produced by TBS and Kodansha. Like its predecessor, the anime {{does not follow}} the manga <b>chronologically.</b> The plot follows the adventures of Keiichi and Belldandy {{in the aftermath of}} the Lord of Terror fiasco.|$|E
5|$|The {{historian}} Guy Halsall {{argues that}} as Ælle immediately preceded the late sixth-century King Ceawlin as Bretwalda, {{it is far}} more likely that Ælle dates to the mid sixth century, and that the Chronicle has moved his dates back a century in order to provide a foundation myth for Sussex which puts it <b>chronologically</b> and geographically between the origins of the kingdoms of Kent and Wessex.|$|E
5|$|The sujet (syuzhet), or the {{presentation}} of the film, is structured with two timelines: one in color and one in black-and-white. The color sequences are alternated with black-and-white sequences. The latter are put together in chronological order. The color ones, though shown forward (except for the very first one, which is shown in reverse), are ordered in reverse. <b>Chronologically,</b> the black-and-white sequences come first, the color sequences come next.|$|E
5|$|The {{theories}} and system of interpreting ancient art devised by Johann Joachim Winckelmann influenced European tastes for decades. His major work, History of Ancient Art, {{was published in}} 1764 and translated into French in 1766 (the English translation came later, in 1881). In this major work Winckelmann initiated the tradition of dividing ancient art into periods, classifying the works <b>chronologically</b> and stylistically.|$|E
5|$|Among the {{supporting}} roles, {{one of the}} highest-profile pieces of casting was Malcolm McDowell as Soho porn baron Benny Barrett. Barrett appears in scenes across various episodes from 1966 through to 1979, but the production could only afford him for three weeks. This was because McDowell was then a resident in the United States. All of McDowell's scenes were therefore shot by Stuart Urban {{as part of the}} first block of filming, as opposed {{to the rest of the}} production which was filmed roughly <b>chronologically.</b> This was considered more than worthwhile, however, for the prestige of being able to use an actor such as McDowell, predominantly a film actor who rarely did television work.|$|E
5|$|At Edinburgh University, Childe {{focused on}} research, and {{although}} reportedly very kind towards his students, had difficulty speaking to large audiences; he organised the BSc degree course {{so that it}} began studying the Iron Age, progressing <b>chronologically</b> backward to the Palaeolithic, confusing many students. Founding the Edinburgh League of Prehistorians, he took his more enthusiastic students on excavations and invited guest lecturers to visit. Involving them in experimental archaeology, {{of which he was}} an early proponent, in 1937 he performed experiments to understand the vitrification process that had occurred at several Iron Age forts in northern Britain.|$|E
5|$|<b>Chronologically,</b> it is {{difficult}} to establish guidelines that illustrate the evolution of Gaudí's style faithfully. Although he moved on from his initially historicist approach to immerse himself completely in the modernista movement which arose so vigorously in the last third of the 19th century in Catalonia, before finally attaining his personal, organic style, this process did not consist of clearly defined stages with obvious boundaries: rather, at every stage there are reflections of all the earlier ones, as he gradually assimilated and surpassed them. Among the best descriptions of Gaudí's work was made by his disciple and biographer Joan Bergós, according to plastic and structural criteria. Bergós establishes five periods in Gaudí's productions: preliminary period, mudéjar-morisco (Moorish/mudéjar art), emulated Gothic, naturalist and expressionist, and organic synthesis.|$|E
5|$|Fat Tony & Co. was {{confirmed}} on 3 August 2013, with series production beginning on 5 August 2013. It was not branded as Underbelly due {{to changes in}} funding with Screen Australia, but <b>chronologically</b> acts as a direct sequel to the first series of the show, {{with most of the}} same cast playing the same characters with only one or two exceptions. Based on Tony Mokbel, the series covers the manhunt for Mokbel that lasted 18 months, and dismantled his drug empire. It was filmed in Greece. It first aired on 23 February at 8.40pm on Channel 9.|$|E
5|$|God of War: Betrayal is a {{two-dimensional}} (2D) side-scrolling action-adventure mobile game developed by Javaground and Sony Online Entertainment's (SOE) Los Angeles division, {{and published by}} Sony Pictures Digital. Released for mobile phones supporting the Java Platform, Micro Edition (Java ME) on June 20, 2007, it is the third installment in the God of War series, and the fifth <b>chronologically.</b> Loosely based on Greek mythology, Betrayal is set in ancient Greece with vengeance as its central motif. The player controls the protagonist Kratos, who became the new God of War after killing the former, Ares. Kratos is framed {{for the murder of}} Argos and pursues the true assassin across Greece, resulting in a confrontation with Olympian messenger Ceryx.|$|E
5|$|He {{contends that}} the {{presentation}} of the Quran and its suras was dictated by Muhammad and that the task of Abu Bakr was to collect the Quran between its two covers and transcribe it into one copy, while Uthman's task was to fix the transcription and unify it to prevent variant readings. He also expresses doubts that Ali, as it is alleged, had made a <b>chronologically</b> arranged collection. Darwaza was very critical of other modern interpreters who used certain verses of the Quran to deduce and support scientific theories. He argues that those people have done harm to Islam by trivializing the sacred character of the Quran.|$|E
