50|$|Nevertheless, the Community's {{intent to}} reshape the {{programme}} of National Socialism threatened Hitler's absolute authority. The underlying premise of the Community was, in effect, democratic: neither Munich nor the Führer could {{have all the answers}} and the best solution was a comradely, communal and cooperative effort by <b>concerned</b> <b>party</b> members, who would combine their skills and intelligence to formulate a winning programme.|$|E

5000|$|Along with resolving an examinee's {{testamentary}} capacity, {{a forensic}} specialist observes {{for signs of}} undue influence by a <b>concerned</b> <b>party</b> that exploits an emotionally vulnerable individual who might otherwise be cognitively intact. The testamentary capacity matter is most frequently raised posthumously, when an aggrieved heir contests the will entered into probate. For this reason, the forensic psychiatrist or forensic psychologist studies the testatrix’ cognition through videotape record of the drafting of the will, or by reviewing email, letters and other records.|$|E
50|$|A crucial {{element to}} the success of {{international}} labour standards is proper monitoring and enforcement. When monitoring international labor standards, agencies rely on three major types of information: information from international organisations, like the ILO, information from national agencies, and information from non-governmental organizations. Upon locating and determining the necessary data, monitoring agencies then need to process and sift through the results to analyze compliance with certain international labor standards. Finally after compliance analysis, recommendations and required adjustments are then communicated to the <b>concerned</b> <b>party.</b>|$|E

5000|$|The Act's {{full name}} is [...] "An Act {{to amend the}} Vital Statistics Act in {{relation}} to adoption information and to make consequential amendments to the Child and Family Services Act".

However, Section 229 of the Act states it may not be necessary to comply with the notice requirements should the Fair Work Commission be 'satisfied that it is appropriate in all the circumstances to do so'.|$|E
5000|$|Norse law-system {{is called}} Wergild. It {{is similar to}} the actual Werglid system of law that was used by the Anglo-Saxons; every class of {{individual}} that a person can murder is set with a specific amount of Norse Sceattas that the murderer must repay to the <b>concerned</b> <b>party,</b> or they can instead be subjected to a punishment of the hurt party's choice. The administration of werglid is overseen by the Jarl. The holy men of the Norse do not have a worldly werglid that their attacker must pay; as the Chaos Gods themselves will avenge any slight made upon their priests.|$|E

50|$|The {{other factor}} that {{prevented}} {{the emergence of}} a national political consensus <b>concerned</b> <b>party</b> factionalism. After sixteen years of one-party rule, most Sudanese favored the revival of the multiparty system. In the aftermath of Nimeiri's overthrow, approximately forty political parties registered with the TMC and announced their intention to participate in national politics. The political parties ranged from those committed to revolutionary socialism to those that supported Islamism. Of these latter, the NIF had succeeded the Islamic Charter Front as the main vehicle for the Muslim Brotherhood's political aspirations. However, policy disagreements over the sharia, the southern civil war, and the country's future direction contributed to the confusion that characterized Sudan's national politics.|$|E
50|$|As the Hugocarlista {{strategy}} embraced diluting {{the powers}} of Secretariado by new bodies in the governing scheme, the position of Sáenz-Díez decreased. He found {{it increasingly difficult to}} co-operate with the young entourage of Don Carlos Hugo, estranged by their ambiguous socially-driven rhetoric. Though at that time some likewise <b>concerned</b> <b>party</b> pundits dissociated themselves from Comunión, Sáenz-Díez did not; unhappy by what he dubbed camarilla of the prince, in the mid-1960s he merely started to withdraw to the second row. As key associate of Valiente, he still counted within the party, though gradually moved from executive to decorative bodies. In 1966 he was appointed to Consejo Privado of Don Javier, intended as camouflage to now almost open Progressist bid for power.|$|E
5000|$|Sharing {{his view}} as to the reasons for his arrest, he {{explained}} that:In the past three months, a far-reaching defamation campaign was launched against me {{in a number of}} Israeli newspapers accusing me of supporting terrorism and violence and condoning suicide attacks. I have a strong conviction that the slander, assault and arrest are all part of a chain of accusations meant to deliver a message to me, {{and the rest of the}} Christian and Moslem religious leaders ... The Israeli authority has launched a campaign aiming at silencing all those nationalistic voices in Jerusalem and claiming that these voices support terrorism, violence, etc. I believe that the only <b>concerned</b> <b>party</b> is the Israeli authority. In my case there could be some elements involved from within the Church itself, and this is something that I cannot disregard, especially that there are those who do not share my stance on issues pertaining to the Palestinian-Israeli conflict.|$|E

5000|$|While the {{position}} also {{existed in the}} former Central Legislative Assembly of British India, and holders of it there included Motilal Nehru, it received statutory recognition through the Salary and Allowances of Leaders of Opposition in Parliament Act, 1977 which defines the term [...] "Leader of the Opposition" [...] as that member of the Lok Sabha or the Rajya Sabha who, for the time being, is the Leader of that House of the Party in Opposition to the Government having the greatest numerical strength and recognised, as such, by the Chairman of the Rajya Sabha or the Speaker of the Lok Sabha. However, {{in order to get}} formal recognition, the <b>concerned</b> <b>party</b> must have at least [...] 10% of the total strength of the House (55 seats in the Lok Sabha). If any party fails to get 10% seats in opposition, the House will not have recognised leader of the opposition. A single party has to meet the 10% seat criteria, not an alliance.|$|E
5000|$|With a {{group of}} other Chicago-based musicians, Captain Sky began {{recording}} around 1978 and released The Adventures of Captain Sky in that year followed quickly by Pop Goes The Captain in 1979. Both albums were released by AVI Records. Several singles were released from these albums, most notably “Wonder Worm” and “Super Sporm.” By 1980, Captain Sky had moved to TEC records and on that imprint released his third album <b>Concerned</b> <b>Party</b> #1. After several more singles, The Return of Captain Sky, his final album was released in 1981 back on AVI records.That particular album was not authorized or endorsed by Captain Sky. It was a humorous attempt of frustration by the label due to the Captain's departure from A.V.I. Since that time, Captain Sky has released singles sporadically on various labels and older tracks have been included on various compilations.Captain Sky also signed with Philly World Records, WMOT, and as a concept artist with Sweet Mountain/Sugar Hill Records.Several artists made mention of Captain Sky or sampled his work. The Sugar Hill Gang mentioned him by name, giving him credit for his contributions {{to the creation of}} the street sound and rap genre in the very first rap hit, Rapper's Delight. Daryl Cameron, the creator and character/performer [...] "Captain Sky", is credited as songwriter, producer, musician, arranger and vocalist on his previously released material.|$|E
5000|$|In February 2015, Kim's girlfriend was {{reported}} to be pregnant with his child. Kim stated that he would take full responsibility if his girlfriend was found pregnant. His agency later reported that his girlfriend could not be contacted even before the issue came out, thus, they could not confirm if the pregnancy was true. [...] On May 3, it {{was reported}} that Kim's girlfriend had filed a mass Psychological injury lawsuit against more than 100 netizens for posting malicious comments about them during their scandal. On the same day, it was reported that Kim was being sued by his former girlfriend as well, for a sum of $1.48 million for the mental damages from her relations with Kim. She filed another lawsuit worth $1.2 million for child support. On the following day, it was reported {{that he was going to}} be enlisted on May 12. Kim's lawyer said the case will not influence his attendance in the military as the civil suit can go on without the <b>concerned</b> <b>party,</b> with a substitute. When the DNA testing confirms him as the father, he would take responsibility. His lawyer also stated that they would not settle with Kim's ex-girlfriend this time. On June 3, 2015, at pre-trial proceedings, Kim's ex-girlfriend did not provide any medical evidence to prove her pregnancy. Kim and his ex-girlfriend Ms Choi were still debating on the fatherhood of the new born baby and had yet to reveal any details about the DNA test as of 30 October 2015.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} purposely is to deeply {{figure out}} and understand about {{the estimation of}} contract {{in accordance with the}} civil code and the essence of the contract estimation for the <b>concerned</b> <b>parties.</b> A judicial-normative approach is applied here and the data source used in this research is simply in the form of secondary data comprising primary, secondary, and tertiary materials. Subsequently, those legal materials are analyzed using a descriptive-qualitative method. The result of the research shows that the interpretation of the contract is still needed by considering that indistinctness in the formula of contract content is often found. The interpretation of the contract is done to match the intentions of all <b>concerned</b> <b>parties.</b> To this point, there will be no any differences in fulfilling the pretasi in accordance with what has been regulated in the contract formula. In this case, both <b>concerned</b> <b>parties</b> must find the essence of a new agreement by interpreting the contract fairly. However, such interpretation is not simple as each of parties commonly has a high subjectivity that is by interpreting the contract by considering their own interest and benefit. On the other hand, the interest of other parties sometimes is not accommodated well...|$|R
