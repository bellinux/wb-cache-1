The conference dealt with the „Transition to fanning in the Baltic” and its main purpose was to exchange experience in the research on the beginnings of productive economy in the Baltic Sea region. The following subjects were discussed: 1. Social and economic organization of the late Mesolithic hunter-gatherers. 2. Contacts between the late Mesolithic hunter-gatherers and early farming societies. 3. Cultural changes and responses within the hunter-gatherers societies occurring through contact with early farming societies. 4. Management of non-domesticated plant and animal resources by late Neolithic hunter- -gatherers. 5. Health and demographic changes at the agricultural transition. 6. Explanations for the adoption of farming. 7. Continuity and change at the agricultural transition: the <b>case</b> <b>of</b> <b>acculturation</b> <b>of</b> hunter-gatherers by early farming communities of the adoption of farming by the resident hunter-gatherers.

40|$|The Leco from North of La Paz were {{considered}} to have disappeared {{by the end of}} the 20 th century; however in 1997, two groups of Leco re-emerged independently from each other, one in Larecaja and one in Apolo. In the former the claim was less violent than in the latter, where Quechua peasants share language, culture and kinship, and refuse to recognize the land rights and the identity of their “Indigenous Leco” neighbours. The thesis aims to understand ethnohistorically both resurgences, and tries to go beyond essentialism to understand the heterogeneous melting pot from where the Apoleños come. Apolobamba, because it connects highlands and lowlands, received Andean influences (puquina, aymara and quechua) early on. Its inhabitants, the Chuncho of the Incas then the Spaniards, show hybrid ethnolinguistic and socio-cultural features. The ethnic diversity was reduced in the 18 th century Franciscan Missions, where the ethnolinguistic border between an Andean South and the “savages” of the North was drawn at the Tuichi river. The liberal Republican period, with the construction of a national identity, once again shrank regional diversity and increased “Andeanization”. Apolistas and then Apoleños emerged from these interethnic mixes defined more geographically than ethnically. The Leco revival happens in an auspicious national and international context, but the Leco language was still spoken two or three generations ago on the Mapiri’s banks. It raises the question of social transformation and continuity: are we dealing with a <b>case</b> <b>of</b> <b>acculturation,</b> ethnogenesis, camouflage or resistance...|$|R

The {{purpose of this study is}} to investigate the relationship between the degree <b>of</b> <b>acculturation</b> and preference for American food. The study is applied on East Asian students residing in Texas, USA. Length of residence in the U.

40|$|Restricted until 24 July 2010. This {{dissertation}} {{examines the}} effect <b>of</b> <b>acculturation</b> on Latino health disparity {{based on a}} bi-dimensional model <b>of</b> <b>acculturation.</b> First, the author reviews the literature <b>of</b> <b>acculturation</b> and introduces two models of acculturation: uni-dimensional and bi-dimensional models <b>of</b> <b>acculturation.</b> The author critiques previous studies in public health {{by pointing out that}} this scholarship predominantly relied on an uni-dimensional model <b>of</b> <b>acculturation,</b> consequently ignoring bilingual groups, which is currently almost half of the Latino population in the U. S.; Next, this dissertation applied a bi-dimensional model <b>of</b> <b>acculturation</b> in the health disparity discipline and empirically tests the effect <b>of</b> <b>acculturation</b> on Latino health attitudes and behaviors regarding diabetes, obesity, and substance use. First, the comparison among bilinguals, English monolinguals and Spanish monolinguals reveals their differences in terms of their health access, health status, health problem solving capacities, and healthy behavior and lifestyle. Second, the author investigates the communication environment in which the three groups (i. e., English monolinguals, Spanish monolinguals, and bilinguals) are situated and theirhealth information seeking behaviors.; The result of the study shows that bilinguals are clearly different from English monolinguals and Spanish monolinguals in terms of many health attitudes and behaviors. It suggests that when the comparison goes beyond a binary model (English and Spanish speakers) and bilinguals are not disregarded, it may provide more accurate explanation of the effect <b>of</b> <b>acculturation.</b> Discussion about the limitations and implications of the study follows...|$|R

Specifically, the current study investigated the effects <b>of</b> <b>acculturation</b> and acculturation risk factors on adolescents 2 ̆ 7 global self-worth and self-perceptions of competence. Eighty-three Latino adolescents completed a series of questionnaires regarding behavioral and cognitive aspects <b>of</b> <b>acculturation,</b> acculturation risk factors (i. e., acculturation stress, acculturation conflict, and perceived ethnic discrimination), and perceptions of global self-worth and competence across various domains (i. e., behavioral conduct, physical appearance, and social acceptance). Results indicated that Latino orientation and bicultural orientation on the behavioral measure <b>of</b> <b>acculturation</b> were positively associated with perceived competence regarding behavioral conduct. Additionally, acculturation stress was negatively associated with global self-worth and perceived competence regarding physical appearance and social acceptance. Similarly, acculturation conflict and perceived ethnic discrimination were negatively associated with global self-worth and perceived competence regarding behavioral conduct, physical appearance, and social acceptance. Exploratory analyses also revealed that specific cultural orientations (i. e., Latino orientation, orientation to mainstream U. S. culture, and bicultural orientation) on the behavioral and cognitive measures <b>of</b> <b>acculturation</b> were significant predictors of global self-worth and perceived competence regarding behavioral conduct. Additionally, the acculturation risk factors (i. e., acculturation stress, acculturation conflict, and perceived ethnic discrimination) were significant predictors of global self-worth and perceptions of competence across various domains (i. e., behavioral conduct, physical appearance, and social acceptance). However, moderation analyses indicated that the effects <b>of</b> <b>acculturation</b> conflict and perceived ethnic discrimination on Latino adolescents 2 ̆ 7 global self-worth largely depended on their cultural orientation on the behavioral and cognitive measures <b>of</b> <b>acculturation.</b> For interventions aimed at improving global self-worth and perceptions of competence in Latino adolescents, these results highlight the importance <b>of</b> assessing <b>acculturation</b> and acculturation risk factors.

Using a qualitative, phenomenological design, 10 Latina participants of Caribbean backgrounds who received similar scores on the Bidimensional Acculturation Scale were interviewed with regard to their experiences in several life areas. There were three areas of focus in the current study: (1) The themes <b>of</b> <b>acculturation</b> that were identified in the interviews; (2) whether degree <b>of</b> <b>acculturation</b> varies by and/or within a situation or is better accounted for by a summative score across contexts; and (3) whether there are themes that pertain primarily to the context of gender, and specifically to being a woman in the Hispanic community.
