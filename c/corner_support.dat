These chickee camps were arranged according to matrilineal clans and multiple living units surrounded a shared central cooking chickee.

5000|$|The square {{symmetrical}} towers are in {{the neoclassical}} style, resembling tall pavilions rather than towers, with each facade pedimented and the whole surmounted by a cupola decorated with blind windows interspersed by Ionic columns. At ground floor level two unfluted ionic columns at each <b>corner</b> <b>support</b> a decorative cornice. The columns are decorative only, and appear to serve no structural purpose. The design of the towers creates {{the impression that the}} building was once more of a miniature cathedral than a parish church. However, {{the main body of the}} church was small and occupied the (now empty) site between the two towers. It was a single story structure with a simple hipped roof and an entrance portico at its centre. This part of Adam's church was demolished in 1870, when the new parish church in New Road was built. The remaining towers are Grade I listed and a scheduled monument.|$|E

In contrast to the Kuala Lumpur railway station, the Ipoh station's exterior is more distinctively Western in design, drawing elements of late-Edwardian Baroque architecture and incorporating moderate rustication {{on the base of}} the ground floor, opened pointed and arched pediments, extensive use of engaged columns, and a large central dome over the porte-cochère, while integrating vernacular elements such as deep, open air loggias into the ground floor and upper floor of the building (the ground floor's loggia measures at 183 metres, the length of the station's frontage).

50|$|In origin the {{building}} was of the Second Empire style of design. Subsequent to its mid-1860s additions, a mansard roof third story was added in 1868. This continued largely unused throughout its existence. In 1905 Koenig hired contractor Perre O. Unger to convert the original arched lower story entrance into a plate glass storefront with ornamental <b>corner</b> <b>support</b> column, and also installed {{the building}}'s signature 2-ton Diebold safe. In 1922 the upper storefront was remodeled to modernized appearance by contractor Michael Sweeney, {{at which point the}} building's cornerstone was removed and given to the Golden Masonic lodge, which had long since moved out of the building. In 1941 the plate glass storefront was extended partially along {{the south side of the}} building and clerestory covered. In 1992 the storefront, with a canopy added in the 1960s, was thoroughly renovated to an approximation of its 1922 appearance. After a nearly catastrophic fire gutted the rear upper floor with water heavily damaging the rest of the building on November 3, 2005, the interior was stripped completely and building thoroughly reinforced, a new rear replacement roof installed, and new more historically accurate upper story windows installed. The distinctive row of chimneys on the 12th Street side, mostly missing since being pared down in 1933, were restored, making the building look more historic after the fire than it did before.|$|E

They are both in the Parther style of architecture and stand on raised platforms. The larger of the two contains the mortal remains of Malik Ambar and resembles Nizam Shah's dargah. Though the smaller is also of the same general appearance, it does not have the facade decorated with recesses and cusped arches in stucoo plaster. At a short distance from Malik Ambar's tomb is the open tomb of Tana Shah, the last of the Golkonda kings. To the north of the town is the tomb of Nizam Shah Bhairi which was converted into a trvelles' bungalow by the officers of the contingent stationed at Aurangabad during British days. The mausoleum {{at the base of the}} hill close by was erected for himself by Khoja Firoz while engaged in building the tomb of Nizam Shah Bhairi. The dargah of Ahmad Nizam Shah (1489-1509) is built on a raised platform and has an open court all round. It is quadrangular in plan, the walls rising high and plump with the parapet. A projecting string course divides the facade into two portions, the lower of which has three compartments on each face. Each compartment again has a rectangular recess covered by a horse-shoe arch.

40|$|This {{investigation}} {{is concerned with}} the application of finite difference methods to the solution of thin elastic shallow shells. In particular, the ruled surface hyperbolic paraboloid is systematically studied to determine the influences of boundary conditions, geometric shape and material properties. The method developed for representing and solving the discretised system is suitable for use on digital computers of limited storage capacity and arithmetic speed. For all boundary types considered, solutions upon successively finer difference grids have demonstrated convergence to the analytic solution. A number of methods for accelerating this convergence were found to result. in an increase of total computational labour for a given numerical accuracy. The considerable differences in the behaviour of the degenerate clamped and free edged shells demonstrate the necessity of theoretical solutions embodying the influence of edge members. A number of numerical - physical analogues for the shell-edge member interaction are studied to ensure compatibility with the degenerate boundary conditions upon choice of suitable beam dimensions. The construction and testing of a "perspex" model with varied boundary and <b>corner</b> <b>support</b> conditions is described. Results from these tests are used as a basis for comparison with theoretical solutions and to provide additional information concerning the critical influence of the corner diagonal thrust.

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the bending of <b>corner</b> <b>supported</b> rectangular plates under transverse uniformly distributed load. It is shown herein that the commonly used Ritz method does not predict accurate stress resultants, especially the twisting moment and the shear forces. Firstly, these stress resultants do not fully satisfy the natural boundary conditions, and secondly they exhibit oscillations in the distribution of the stress resultants in the plate domain and give rise to significant errors in the maximum values. As a remedy to the aforementioned problems, we propose the use of (a) the Lagrange multiplier method to ensure the satisfaction of the natural boundary conditions and (b) a surface-smoothing technique to post-process the solution to eliminate the oscillations in the distribution of stress resultants. To illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed strategy, we compare the solutions with those obtained by commercial finite element software.

40|$|The {{robustness}} or {{structural integrity}} of light steel framing and modular constructions {{is important because}} these are relatively new structural forms, in which the components have different forms of inter connectivity in comparison with primary steel frames. There is also an increased {{need to understand the}} sensitivity of these forms of construction to so called ‘accidental actions’ including terrorist threats. Various forms of construction using light steel and modular technologies are identified and their implications for ‘robustness’ are reviewed. For light steel framing, multiple inter connections provide robustness by tying action and alternative load paths in the event of one or more elements being severely damaged. For modular construction, a scenario based approach is required in which modules are selectively removed and the horizontal and vertical forces in the connections between the modules can be calculated explicitly. Load tests on modular units demonstrate the torsional and ‘deep beam’ action of the modules. Stressed skin tests are presented which show that modules are able to span as deep beams with one longitudinal support removed with minimal displacements, indicating that the torsional stiffness of the ‘box’ provides a high level of robustness. Removal of a <b>corner</b> <b>support</b> again demonstrated the role that torsional action of the box plays in redistributing loads away from damaged sections of a structure...|$|E
40|$|Non-ductile {{reinforced}} concrete structures built {{prior to the}} introduction of seismic codes are susceptible to severe structural damage during an earthquake. Past earthquakes have demonstrated, for example, the high likelihood of shear failure of non-ductile columns. Failure of a column within a building system creates a discontinuous load path due to loss of axial load carrying capacity. When this occurs, the system has to redistribute loads to other load bearing members to prevent progressive collapse. Although several studies have been conducted to understand the behavior of the beam-column frame system under support failure, the role of the beam-slab system under such failure scenarios has observed much less attention in the literature. Large-scale experiments were conducted on two one-third scale {{reinforced concrete}} beam- slab models to investigate their behavior under different support failure scenarios. Test results demonstrate that the beam-slab system was able to continue to carry large vertical forces despite the occurrence of a simulated column failure, while redistributing the loads to the adjacent support locations. Compared to predictions using Yield Line Theory, an enhancement in load capacity of more than 50 % was observed. This reserve capacity is largely attributed to the presence of in-plane forces that develop as the system redistributes load. A nonlinear finite element model is implemented and its property selection and model protocol parameters evaluated by comparing its response to that observed in the tests. Subsequently, the validated finite element model is used to conduct a parametric analysis varying the different design parameters to common ranges found in practice. The emphasis of this aspect of the study is on characterizing the ultimate load carrying capacity of the system under the more critical <b>corner</b> <b>support</b> failure scenario. Results from the parametric analysis on the beam-slab system numerical model further corroborate observations from the experimental phase of the study. Namely the presence of in -plane membrane forces and increased load carrying capacity on average by 50 % compared to the Yield Line Theory estimates. An analytical model is presented, which proves to increase the reliability of estimating the ultimate load carrying capacity of the system by considering the in-plane membrane forces that occur due to the presence of the sla...|$|E
