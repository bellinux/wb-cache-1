I think the song, more than anything, is about having a sense of urgency; about how we are you know, living on borrowed time essentially and people are becoming much {{more aware of the}} environment and how we're destroying the planet. We can't just keep distracting ourselves we do have to educate ourselves and wake up and do something about it. You know {{at the same time we}} don't want to be boring and serious and not have fun so it's kind of like well if we're going to save the planet <b>can</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> a good time while we are doing it? ...|$|E

2500|$|Labour MPs {{who want}} to exit the European Union on left-wing grounds have {{expressed}} their concern over being marginalised by Conservative and UKIP domination of the Vote Leave campaign. Labour donor John Mills was replaced by Conservative peer Lord (Nigel) Lawson {{as chairman of the}} group on 5 February 2016, which prompted {{a source close to the}} campaign to tell The Morning Star that [...] "Given that we need to win over Labour and socialist voters to win, how <b>can</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> a Tory grandee leading the campaign? Labour Leave's position in the campaign is very difficult after this." [...] The Green Party of England and Wales' representative in the House of Lords, Baroness Jones, previously supported Vote Leave but withdrew her support for the organisation following its decision to appoint Lawson as its chairman, tweeting that she [...] "Will vote to Leave EU but can't work with an organisation with so little judgement as to put Lawson at its head." [...] However, in mid-March Labour MP Gisela Stuart replaced Lawson as Chair of Vote Leave ...|$|E

2500|$|Rubber Soul was the group's first release not {{to feature}} their {{name on the}} cover, an {{uncommon}} tactic in 1965. The [...] "stretched" [...] effect of the cover photo came about after photographer Bob Freeman had taken some pictures of the group wearing suede leather jackets at Lennon's house. Freeman showed the photos by projecting them onto an album-sized piece of cardboard to simulate how they would appear on an album cover. The unusual Rubber Soul album cover came to be when the slide card fell slightly backwards, elongating the projected image of the photograph and stretching it. Excited by the effect, they shouted, [...] "Ah! <b>Can</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> that? Can you do it like that?", to which Freeman said he could. The distinctive lettering was created by photographer Charles Front, who recalled that his inspiration was the album's title: [...] "If you tap into a rubber tree then you get a sort of globule, so I started thinking of creating a shape that represented that, starting narrow and filling out." [...] The rounded letters used on the sleeve established a style that became ubiquitous in psychedelic designs and, according to The Guardian, [...] "a staple of poster art for the flower power generation".|$|E
