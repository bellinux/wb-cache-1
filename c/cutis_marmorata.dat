50|$|<b>Cutis</b> <b>marmorata</b> telangiectatica congenita or CMTC {{is a rare}} {{congenital}} vascular {{disorder that}} usually manifests in affecting the blood vessels of the skin. The condition was first recognised and described in 1922 by Cato van Lohuizen, a Dutch pediatrician whose name was later adopted in the other common name {{used to describe the}} condition - Van Lohuizen Syndrome. CMTC is also used synonymously with congenital generalized phlebectasia, nevus vascularis reticularis, congenital phlebectasia, livedo telangiectatica, congenital livedo reticularis and Van Lohuizen syndrome.|$|E
50|$|<b>Cutis</b> <b>marmorata</b> also {{occurs in}} {{decompression}} sickness (DCS). Although {{it is considered}} Type I DCS, which is non-neurological, it is typically treated as if the patient has the more severe Type II DCS. This is because past experience in diving medicine has shown that patients initially presented with only this symptom have a high likelihood of progression to neurological, Type II, DCS without prompt treatment. The marbling does not resolve until few days after treatment, but any pruritus (itching) will likely disappear upon initial recompression.|$|E
50|$|Diagnosis {{is usually}} based on {{clinical}} observation. Various sets of criteria {{have been suggested}} to identify the disorder in an individual patient, all of which include macrocephaly {{and a number of}} the following: somatic overgrowth, <b>cutis</b> <b>marmorata,</b> midline facial birthmark, polydactyly/syndactyly, asymmetry (hemihyperplasia or hemihypertrophy), hypotonia at birth, developmental delay, connective tissue defect and frontal bossing. Currently no consensus exists about which diagnostic criteria are definitive and so evaluation by a medical geneticist or other clinician with familiarity with the syndrome is usually needed to provide diagnostic certainty. It is not clear if there are some features which are mandatory to make the diagnosis, but macrocephaly appears essentially universal though may not be congenital. The distinctive vascular abnormalities of the skin often fade over time, making the diagnosis challenging in older children with this condition.|$|E
50|$|Two key {{features}} of AOS are aplasia cutis congenita {{with or without}} underlying bony defects and terminal transverse limb defects. Cutis aplasia congenita is defined as missing skin over any area of the body at birth; in AOS skin aplasia occurs at the vertex of the skull. The size of the lesion is variable and may range from solitary round hairless patches to complete exposure of the cranial contents. There are also varying degrees of terminal limb defects (for example, shortened digits) of the upper extremities, lower extremities, or both. Individuals with AOS may have mild growth deficiency, with height in the low-normal percentiles. The skin is frequently observed to have a mottled appearance (<b>cutis</b> <b>marmorata</b> telangiectatica congenita). Other congenital anomalies, including cardiovascular malformations, cleft lip and/or palate, abnormal renal system, and neurologic disorders manifesting as seizure disorders and developmental delay are sometimes observed. Variable defects in blood vessels have been described, including hypoplastic aortic arch, middle cerebral artery, pulmonary arteries. Other vascular abnormalities described in AOS include absent portal vein, portal sclerosis, arteriovenous malformations, abnormal umbilical veins, and dilated renal veins.|$|E

40|$|Cutis Marmorata" skin {{symptoms}} after diving, {{most frequently}} {{in the form of}} an itching or painful cutaneous red-bluish discoloration are commonly regarded as a mild form of decompression sickness (DCS), and treated with oxygen inhalation without reverting to hyperbaric recompression treatment. It has been observed that the occurrence of <b>Cutis</b> <b>Marmorata</b> is frequently associated with the presence of a Patent Foramen Ovale (PFO) of the heart, and indeed, with a properly executed contrast echocardiographic technique, these patients have an almost 100 % prevalence of PFO. Only occasionally, <b>Cutis</b> <b>Marmorata</b> is accompanied by other symptoms of DCS. These symptoms usually are in the form of visual distortions, vertigo, or mild, vague but generalized cerebral dysfunction (such as abnormal fatigue, clumsiness, concentration problems). The pathogenesis of these other manifestations is clearly emboligenic, and we hypothesize that <b>Cutis</b> <b>Marmorata</b> is also a manifestation of gas bubbles embolizing the brain stem: the site of autonomic nervous system regulation of skin blood vessel dilation and constriction. The consequences of this hypothesis are that <b>Cutis</b> <b>Marmorata</b> skin decompression sickness should no longer be considered a mild, innocuous form but rather a serious, neurological form and treated accordingly.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} {{the distribution of}} skin lesions, clinical features, and associated abnormalities in children with <b>cutis</b> <b>marmorata</b> telangiectatica congenita at onset and during follow-up. DESIGN: Retrospective survey of the available medical data with an average follow-up of 1 year 5 months (range, 0 - 7 years). SETTING: Pediatric Dermatology Unit (Department of Dermatovenereology) of the Sophia Children's Hospital in Rotterdam, the Netherlands. PATIENTS: The diagnosis of <b>cutis</b> <b>marmorata</b> telangiectatica congenita was clinically established in 35 patients between July 1988 and February 1997. In 33 cases, the typical mottled, blue-violet pattern was present from birth and was readily visible at rest. In 2 cases, the skin lesions initially appeared less reticulated, mimicking a capillary malformation. RESULTS: The skin lesions were almost generalized in 4 children (11 %), whereas they were more localized in the other 31 children (89 %). Associated anomalies, usually minor and sometimes questionable, were noted in 80 % of the patients. Most patients showed a definite improvement of their mottled vascular skin lesions within 2 years. The lesions had totally disappeared, or only faded residual lesions remained. CONCLUSIONS: We believe that <b>cutis</b> <b>marmorata</b> telangiectatica congenita is a relatively mild condition. The prognosis is usually good, with minor associated anomalies. Improvement of the mottled, vascular pattern is usually observed within 2 years. We recommend careful clinical examination of all patients to exclude any associated anomalies. Patients should be referred to a neurologist or an ophthalmologist only if symptoms are present or if vascular lesions are present around the eyes...|$|E
