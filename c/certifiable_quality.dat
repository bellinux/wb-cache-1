50|$|There {{have been}} a number of {{initiatives}} in Europe to create a universal quality standard that could benchmark the quality of the translation services and gain recognition through independent audit certification. This includes the Italian UNI 10574 Standard, the Austrian Önorm D 1200 and Önorm D 1201 Standards, the Dutch Taalmerk Standard and the German DIN 2345 Standard. In 1999 the EUATC (European Union of Associations of Translation Companies) saw the need to develop an industry specific quality standard. This initiative built on previous standards which had been established by some national associations of translation companies. This standard was the first European wide initiative. In 2003 the EUATC took this standard to the next level. They started working with CEN, the European standards body, in April 2003 with the aim of creating a <b>certifiable</b> <b>quality</b> process standard for translation. The public consultation period started in September 2004 and EN 15038 was published by May 2006. The EUATC is made up of national associations of translation companies throughout Europe and these national associations have been translating the standard into their own language and cooperating with their national standardisation bodies for publication and certification by independent third party auditors.|$|E
40|$|In {{the present}} paper, a Quality Systems Theory is presented. <b>Certifiable</b> <b>Quality</b> Systems are treated and {{interpreted}} {{in accordance with}} a Thermodynamics-based approach. Analysis is also conducted {{on the relationship between}} Quality Management Systems (QMSs) and systems theories. A measure of entropy is proposed for QMSs, including a virtual document entropy and an entropy linked to processes and organisation. QMSs are also interpreted in light of Cybernetics, and interrelations between Information Theory and quality are also highlighted. A measure for the information content of quality documents is proposed. Such parameters can be used as adequacy indices for QMSs. From the discussed approach, suggestions for organising QMSs are also derived. Further interpretive thermodynamic-based criteria for QMSs are also proposed. The work represents the first attempt to treat quality organisational systems according to a thermodynamics-related approach. At this stage, no data are available to compare statements in the paper...|$|E
40|$|The biomass and {{biofuels}} {{markets have}} increased substantially {{in the last}} two decades, mainly driven by the national and European policy targets on green energy. The same positive trend is registered in particular for wood pellet markets. In comparison with other wooden biofuels (firewood or wood-chips) pellets have a number of positive aspects such as: -	regular and optimized shape; -	wide range of energetic applications (to produce thermal energy, syngas, electricity); -	high solid density resulting in the concentration of a huge amount of energy in small volume; -	high calorific value on volume bases (i. e. : energy density); -	high energetic conversion factors due to the efficiency and regularity of their burning; -	possibility to enhance the qualitative parameters of some biomasses or bio-wastes in a recycling perspective. The supply chains of wood pellets were traditionally based on residues and by-products from the lumber production industry which could be purchased at low cost locally. Even if these raw materials represent the best option, the potential of residual biomasses has now already reached its availability limit and new forms of supply are needed. The research program aims to verify the technical and economical feasibility to develop and improve alternative raw materials supply chains for wood pellet production verifying their qualitative output and environmental performances compared with traditional ones. The research will consider the forestry sector as main source of raw material, as a large amount of low quality timber is annually harvested and even bigger amounts of allowable annual cut (AAC) are not actually harvested both for technical or economic issues. The possibility to build a forest-wood-pellet chain is going to be studied and tested. The project is mainly focus on four pillars: 1) 	The study of the actual quality of commercial pellets in the market. Through a consistent sampling activity and the statistical elaboration of the acquired data via SIMCA modeling it is possible to build a model able to classify each sample and predict its certifiability. The model defines a critical metric distance below which a sample can be considered of <b>certifiable</b> <b>quality.</b> 2) 	The study of the achievable quality that can be technically obtained from forestry assortments. A experimental design is established for the sampling of different raw material retrievable form forest operation in the alpine region. The analysis of wood pellets, produced by the mean of a pilot pelletizing plant, give answers {{about the quality of the}} final product. 3) 	The study of the color of pellets and its relationship with quality parameters. The color of each sample from point 1) is measured through a spectrometer and image scanner and the results elaborated and statistically analyzed to find correlation between color and quality parameter of pellets. 4) 	The impact assessment of different supply and production pellet chains with the LCA methodology. Five supply and production scenarios are studied and discussed from their environmental performance point of view. Each of them is separated into elementary processes involved in the whole chain and their energetic input and emission output studied and analyzed to detect the best option possible compared with reference one. The results of this study show that there are still chances of improvement in the production potential of wood pellets by an optimal organization of the supply, not only of traditional raw materials, but also of innovative ones. Their exploitation, moreover, can find a proper position in the market of commercial pellets since the quality performance of such products is comparable with traditional ones. ...|$|E
40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to analyze the {{internalization}} of quality management (QM) on the basis of <b>quality</b> <b>certifiable</b> standards – also referred to as meta-standards – in service organizations. More specifically, the paper analyzes the case of the internalization of a quality standard in the Spanish hotel industry. Design/methodology/approach – The paper examines the relationships between the measures of internalization, benefit, QM tools and motivation, using partial least squares in the framework of the structural equation modeling technique. Findings – The results show that the hotels that have internalized the standard to a greater extent are more likely to be driven by internal motivation, develop more QM tools and achieve greater benefits than the hotels with a lower degree of internalization. Originality/value – As previous studies have examined these issues in relation to the internalization of ISO standards, the present study adds to this important stream of research and contributes by advancing the understanding of these issues through the case of a specific standard for the hotel industry. This paper is a result of a Research Group funded by the Basque Autonomous Government (Grupos de investigación del sistema universitario vasco; IT 763 - 13) ...|$|R
40|$|This report {{describes}} the SLE study concerning quality infrastructure in three value chains {{and its potential}} to contributing to economic growth in southern Kyrgyzstan. In the context of GIZ’s Sustainable Economic Development Programme in Kyrgyzstan, the German development agency tasked SLE to perform the study out its Jalal-Abad office, with the following subtasks: - Studied three value chains (apple, tomato and plum) partly; - Has interviewed companies producing and processing those commodities and - Has analyzed the national quality infrastructure (NQI) serving the three. Following a similar task in Ghana, SLE developed a qualitative research methodology with a five week stay in Kyrgyzstan. Through 60 interviews mainly with food processors, but also including farmers, quality infrastructure (QI) service providers and GIZ partners, the three staff SLE team prepared recommendations after verifying them in workshops. Three recommendation groups were developed: 1. 	Strengthen utilization of formal market demands as driver for improved Food Safety and QI 2. 	Widen scope of Kyrgyz QI services and increase clients’ satisfaction in order to boost QI utilization 3. 	Flank intervention in quality management through facilitating investment climate Background and Task This summary condensates the SLE study on how quality infrastructure in three value chains can contribute to economic growth in southern Kyrgyzstan. In the context of GIZ’s Sustainable Economic Development Programme in Kyrgyzstan, the German development agency operates {{an office in the}} rural South Fergana Valley. Based out of that office in Jalal-Abad, this research consultancy has: •	Studied three value chains (apple, tomato and plum) partly; •	Has interviewed companies producing and processing those commodities and •	Has analyzed the national quality infrastructure (NQI) serving the three. These steps were taken in order to come up with recommendations how to support economic growth in rural Kyrgyzstan through specific interventions. The Kyrgyz national economy is still much depending on Russia, 27 years after Soviet Union’s breakup. Yet, many young Kyrgyz people migrate to Russia instead of farming on their families’ properties with the consequence of them not being available in the Kyrgyz national labor market. Stemming from Soviet’s era, the Quality Infrastructure (QI) subsector serves companies and their customers alike through Metrology, Standardization, Testing, Certification and Accreditation. The -mostly governmental- NQI operates on the policy level out of the capital, the regional hubs such as Osh being relevant to Jalal Abad and on the county level (oblast). Besides supplying national Kyrgyz markets, exports play a particular role as they are relevant to apple and plum products. Since the accession of Kyrgyzstan to the Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU) with Russia, Belarus, Armenia and Kazakhstan, export regulations are expected for summer 2017. In light of this the client defined the main research questions as to how to improve food safety and how quality infrastructure services can contribute to creating job opportunities, especially for youth. Methodology Having completed a study of Ghana’s national quality infrastructure in 2015, the Seminar Ländliche Entwicklung (SLE) has been commissioned by GIZ to perform this task, replicating partially the methods and partly in personal union. Given the explorative character of the Kyrgyzstan study, and in coordination with the client during the inception phase, a qualitative approach was adopted. Given the results of the research in Ghana showing the best chances of QI utilization on the medium size company level, the Kyrgyzstan study focused on food processors. The three expatriate SLE consultants designed a five week field phase, flanked by two national Kyrgyz experts. Supported by GIZ’s logistics, the SLE team spent a week in each value chain. The interviews covered 20 food processing companies; three farmers and one retailer were interviewed. 18 interviews were conducted with service providers in the quality infrastructure sector. The total of sixty interviews included also six with development agencies, partly in GIZ partnership. During the final stages, recommendation workshops were hold in Jalal Abad and Bishkek with the purpose of verifying the results and recommendations. Findings and Observations Some out of many observations shall be reflected here: The interviews with producers revealed that EAEU markets, especially Russia are highly relevant to them and will become even more once compliance with customs regulations become obligatory, foreseen in 2017. Looking at the type of producer and processor, the research found a “dual-economy” existing with informal markets for fresh products and formal markets requiring <b>certifiable</b> <b>quality</b> management. Given the formal markets concluding contracts between producers, processors and their clients also concerning quality characteristics, it results in a higher chance of quality management and QI services playing a role. Pondering obligatory and voluntary use of QI, this research applied the assumption that formal markets impose quality regimes sparing the authorities from obligating farmers, processors and exporters as well as policing compliance. On paper, Kyrgyz NQI should function, but in reality this is barely in position to check compliance of products being exported to EAEU countries. While the EAEU is supposed to equip Kyrgyz QI providers even in regions, much is left to be done. Since soviet past, the line ministries for agriculture and health shared the task of maintaining QI services. However, given the nowadays’ involvement of the state inspectorate, exporters have to check compliance for each authority the same characteristics. This duplication withholds willing QI customers and frustrates them, instead of facilitating their work. With 28 ’ 000 out of the total 150 ’ 000 tones annual apple production, apple products are subject to export regulations. In so far, EAEU’s customs union is very relevant, which can even become restrictive, like it was observable with potatoes evading quality infrastructure. Apple juice, which is examined by health authorities additionally for sanitary reasons, requires quality infrastructure services, but does lack inspection. Given this situation, Kyrgyz apples or products more generally do not reach lucrative markets. Like apple, the pomicultures plum is growing in orchards typically planted back in Soviet times. The up to 20 ’ 000 tons of Plums produced annually, are dried in order to conserve them with the few micro-drying facilities. However, even more is sold to intermediaries who partly export them to more lucrative markets, through Uzbekistan and Tajikistan. Hardly any QI service utilization was observed. Tomatoes are produced on some 10 ’ 000 ha of fields in Southern Kyrgyzstan. 60 % of these tomatoes are processed to juices and paste, where hygiene and quality regimes apply. On the fields, fertilizer is applied leading to a necessity to analyze Nitrate concentrations, yet hardly any QI utilization has been observed. In all three value chains, it would be required using Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (HACCP) because it is the most effective and economic way to combat food safety problems. Nevertheless, HACCP is not mandatory in the EAEU quality management and training has been too theoretical. While organic products do not play any role on Kyrgyz national markets, there is an opportunity for European markets. Already now, Kyrgyz Walnuts, plums and other are exported to Turkey, and partly re-dispatched onwards to the EU. A few European processors even invest directly, such as in Kyrgyz nuts. However, in order to do so, they utilize their own company based quality management. Nevertheless, given the growing EU organic market, an opportunity arises for Kyrgyz plums, dried apples, herbal spices and more. This is even more relevant, given the national quality infrastructure contributing. Looking at job opportunities, income generation and youth’s migration, the youth’s multitude of motives for leaving the country presented itself. Youth also leaves rural South in order to be in reach of urban opportunities from mobile phone access to training opportunities. The research concludes that in order to influence migration, the necessary condition is an integrated program offering job opportunities Results and recommendations Summarizing all three value chains, quality infrastructure is utilized rarely by farmers and micro-scale processors, also because National QI is concentrated in Bishkek. In order to solve this, QI services need to be offered on the producer level in relevant villages. Extending services on village level also involves consultancy as to how translating the QI results in a proper HACCP management. Already now, Quality infrastructure is not utilized sufficiently to access profitable markets. The reason is partly the high cost, the unawareness by producers and partly the poor presence in relevant fields and area. Given the poor scope of tests and compliance checks, farmers and processors risk having to check twice quality properties. Consequently, and in order to comply with EAEU regulations already during 2017, the rejection risk of Kyrgyz products grows. In light of this, it is recommended to stimulate QI utilization, widen the scope of QI services and facilitate general economic conditions as follows: 1. 	In order to use formal market demand as driver for improved Food Safety and QI – service utilization in selected value chains (VC) it is necessary to: a. 	improve the linkage of local VC actors with formal markets b. 	facilitate compliance of local VC actors with market requirements 2. 	QI utilization should grow through fulfillment of two recommendations. a. 	In order to increase QI service utilization, the necessary condition is to increase its scope. b. 	The sufficient condition is customers satisfied with easy access, speed and precision of service. 3. 	Besides these two main recommendations, general conditions should augment room for change...|$|E
