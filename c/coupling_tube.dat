To accomplish this, the flux of photons {{that forms the}} final image must be divided into small geometrical subunits called pixels. The light intensity in each pixel will be stored as a single number. Changing the objective magnification, the zoom magnification on your confocal control panel, or choosing another <b>coupling</b> <b>tube</b> magnification for your charge-coupled device (CCD) camera changes {{the size of the}} area on the object that is represented by one pixel. If you can arrange matters so that the smallest feature recorded in your image data is at least 4 to 5 pixels wide in each direction, then all is well.

40|$|From {{the aspect}} of human {{circulation}} system structure, a complete hemodynamic model requires consideration {{of the influence of}} microcirculation load effect. This paper selected the seepage in porous media as the simulant of microcirculation load. On the basis of a bi-directional liquid-solid <b>coupling</b> <b>tube</b> model, we built a liquid-solid-porous media seepage coupling model. The simulation parameters accorded with the physiological reality. Inlet condition was set as transient single-pulse velocity, and outlet as free outlet. The pressure in the tube was kept at the state of dynamic stability in the range of 80 – 120 mmHg. The model was able to simulate the entire propagating process of pulse wave. The pulse wave velocity simulated was 6. 25 m/s, which accorded with the physiological reality. The complex pressure wave shape produced by reflections of pressure wave was also observed. After the model changed the cardiac cycle length, the pressure change according with actual human physiology was simulated successfully. The model in this paper is well-developed and reliable. It demonstrates the importance of microcirculation load in hemodynamic model. Moreover the properties of the model provide a possibility for the simulation of dynamic adjustment process of human circulation system, which indicates a promising prospect in clinical application...|$|E
40|$|The {{availability}} of commercial 325 MHz, 2. 5 MW klystrons initiated {{the development of}} linac resonators which fit to that power level source: this {{will lead to a}} significant overall linac cost reduction. This is achieved if individual cavity modules can be rf coupled efficiently. At IAP Frankfurt a coupling cell for CH – cavity modules was designed, which at the same time can house a transverse focusing lens as well as the rf power coupler for the whole unit. A half scale model of the coupled CH modules 3 and 4 of the FAIR proton injector is under construction at IAP. Design and fabrication of a full scale high power cavity is planned for in 2007. The Proposed Linac Design The beam dynamics calculations lead to a limited number of gaps per acceleration section which have to be followed by a transversely focusing quadrupole lens. Especially at the low energy end each acceleration section would need quite modest rf power levels only, when realized as an individual cavity. By rf coupling up to two of these sections and by integrating the quadrupole lens within the central coupling cell it is possible to match all cavities to the available amplifier power. Each 2. 5 MW amplifier will drive one cavity via one rf power coupler in this approach. The coupled CH-cavity concept The original design of the CH-cavity made use of large end half drift tubes to make the end cell resonant and, at the same time, to host the magnetic lens needed for beam focusing [1]. By putting together two CHcavities of that type and by replacing the inner end walls by a radial stem support for the big drift tube, one is approaching the coupled CH-cavity geometry as one can see from Fig. 1 [2]. Taking the coupling tank diameter as well as the drift tube outer diameter as variables one finally gets the resonant coupling of both CH-cavities. The field distributions in the coupling cell were investigated by MWS field simulations and are shown in Fig. 2. The large coupling drift tube is capable to house a magnetic quadrupole triplet and/or diagnostics instrumentation as well as a cooled beam collimator. A robust radial stem is well suited for tube adjustment. Moreover, it allows comfortable access to feed all installations within the <b>coupling</b> <b>tube...</b>|$|E
