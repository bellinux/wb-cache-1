The textured rollers produced by the method mentioned above have some disadvantage performances that include rapid roughness attenuation, limited use time and more concave. These disadvantages are not suitable {{for the formation of}} roughness on the <b>cold</b> <b>roller</b> surface. On account of high hardness and excellent wearable capability, the element chrome, which can be deposited on the <b>cold</b> <b>roller</b> surface, can increase the use life of textured <b>cold</b> <b>roller</b> enormously. In this paper, an experiment of DC superimposed pulse was performed to obtain certain roughness chrome textured and hemisphere-shaped chrome coatings. From the results, it was shown that the roughness and hardness of coating obtained by electroplating was 3. 79 µm at 850 mA/cm 2 and 1000 Hv respectively...|$|E

A three-dimensional asymmetric rolling model is constructed by using elastic-plastic finite tool, and the stress on the roller in different plating hardness, thickness and layers in cold rolling process is analyzed.

Laser texturing {{is a novel}} technique used to texture the <b>cold</b> <b>roller</b> surface to produce high quality steel sheets with good formability and image clarity. Principle of multi-head CO 2 laser surface texturing technique using polygon scanner for beam modulation is introduced. Texturing parameters and their influence are investigated.

40|$|An {{ultrasonic}} {{device was}} designed to fabricate relatively small (about 0. 7 kg) vacuum chill castings of FeAl-based alloys with improved microstructure. The influence of ultrasound on the solidification microstructure of the Fe- 40 at. % Al based castings was investigated. The subsequent hot-rolling of such an as-cast alloy was made using a special stainless steel bandage of the casting. This effectively prevents fraying and cracking caused by the thermal shock arising at {{the surface of the}} hot casting, when it comes in contact with a <b>cold</b> <b>roller.</b> The efficiency of ultrasonic vacuum casting, based on the influence of the acoustic cavitation on the solidification of the melt, is manifested by a refined microstructure of the prepared iron aluminides Fe- 40 at. % Al with addition of C or Zr and B. First results of improved mechanical properties of these alloys are presented and discussed...|$|E
40|$|<b>Cold</b> <b>roller</b> bending is {{commonly}} used for bending straight members with hot rolled wide-flange sections to create arches. This process induces plastic deformations along the member, {{so that it can}} acquire the desired curvature. The resulting residual stress distribution is different from the well-known residual stress pattern due to hot rolling. Extensive {{studies have shown that the}} influence of residual stresses due to hot rolling on the resistance of wide-flange steel sections is non negligible. On the contrary, the residual stress pattern due to roller bending has been only recently clearly identified and its effects on the elasto-plastic behavior of curved members have not been studied sufficiently. Thus, in this paper the influence of such residual stresses on the resistance of both wide-flange sections and corresponding arch members is investigated in detail. Taking into consideration the residual stress pattern due to cold bending, interaction diagrams are developed for combined axial load and bending moment, as well as buckling curves for cold bent steel arches. The results are quantified and compared with those for hot-rolled and stress free members. This will allow designers to appreciate the available margins of safety when using standard residual stress pattern for cold bent members. Furthermore, the results suggest the necessity for the development of buckling curves for curved members including initial imperfections...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Electrochemical {{polishing}} (ECP) is {{a promising}} approach to finishing surface to achieve {{high quality of}} surface. However, it cannot satisfy requirements of mirror finishing yet. In this paper, a mirror finishing method for <b>cold</b> rolling <b>rollers</b> is proposed. The whole process of the surface finishing {{can be divided into}} two phases: electrochemical polishing and mechanical grinding. An anodic film is formed exception for anodic dissolution during ECP. A small amount of the anodic film and metal material are removed by abrasive paper in mechanical grinding. Activated metal surface is exposed again and dissolved in electrochemical reaction after mechanical grinding. Residual of anodic film protects rollers. It is a cyclic process of mirror finishing. Experimental results showed that a mirror finishing surface of up to Ra 0. 02 - 0. 05 µm can be obtained by using this method and that it is effective and efficient...|$|R
40|$|Analysis and {{development}} of the existing method of calculation of the calibrated profile of the working strips mills CTRR <b>roller</b> <b>cold</b> rolling pipe to ensure the required distribution of energy-power parameters along the cone. In presented paper, which has for aim the development of existing method for calculating the profile of calibrated working plank in the <b>cold</b> tube <b>roller</b> rolling mills, the analysis had been made and it was proposed to use Besier-lines while building the the profile of the plank working surface. It was established that the use of Besier spline-curve for calculating the calibration of supporting planks creates the possibility to calculate the parameters proceeding from reduction over the external diameter. The proposed method for calculating deformation parameters in CTRR mills is the result of development of existing method and as such shows the scientific novelty. Comparison of the plots for distribution of the force parameters of the CTRR process along the cone of deformation presents as evidence the advantage of the method to be proposed. The decrease of reduction value at the end of deformation zone favors the manufacture of tubes with lesser wall thickness deviation (especially longitudinal one, caused with waviness induced by the cold pilgering process). Joined the further development of the method of calculating the deformation parameters CTRR. It is proposed for the calculation of the calibration work surface support bracket mills CTRR to use a spline Bezier. The practical significance of the proposed method consists in the fact that calculation of all zones of the plank by means of one dependence allows simplifying the process of manufacturing the latter in machines with programmed numerical control. In this case the change of reduction parameters over the thickness of the wall will not exert the considerable influence on the character of the force parameters (the character and not the value) distribution along the cone of deformation...|$|R

We focused on thermal grill illusion and synthetic heat, which are well-known phenomena that can generate pain or burning sensation without physical damage; we tried to achieve a similar effect via a harmless-range thermal stimulation. We developed a roller-type itch-relief device. When the device is rolled onto the user’s skin, the skin is alternately exposed to hot and <b>cold</b> stimuli. The <b>roller</b> is composed of an aluminum pipe cut into two parts along the longitudinal axis. One part is set to hot {{and the other is}} set to cold by embedded Peltier devices. When the device is rolled on the user’s skin, the skin is alternately exposed to hot and cold stimuli. In addition, vibration is applied so that a virtual scratching feeling is presented without damage to the skin. We evaluated the device by eliciting an itch using a lactic acid solution and then applying the device. The results showed that the device provides effective temporal relief from itch and that its effect continues for a few minutes. Categories and Subject Descriptor...|$|R
