It involved a Hunting Air Travel Vickers 639 Viking 1 (registration: G-AHPD) operating an international scheduled passenger flight from Bordeaux Mérignac to RAF Bovingdon. Following an uneventful takeoff from Mérignac, the no. 1 engine suddenly {{began to lose}} power when the aircraft climbed through [...] and the pilot in command throttled down to initial climbing speed. The pilot then shut down the malfunctioning engine, feathered the propeller and applied full power to the no. 2 engine {{to compensate for the}} loss of engine no. 1. However, this was insufficient to maintain altitude and led to the flightdeck crew's decision to execute a gear-up landing. When the aircraft touched the ground, it slid for about [...] before coming to a halt. There were no fatalities among the 32 occupants (five crew and 27 passengers). Accident investigators established the probable cause as the disconnecting of the articulated control rod of the propeller governor {{due to the lack of}} a split pin on the governor spindle, and due to the nut of the ball joint of the <b>control</b> <b>spindle</b> having been unscrewed by force.|$|E
40|$|SummaryThe {{mitotic spindle}} is a {{macromolecular}} structure utilized to properly align and segregate sister chromatids to two daughter cells. During mitosis, the spindle maintains a constant length, {{even though the}} spindle microtubules (MTs) are constantly undergoing polymerization and depolymerization [1]. Members of the kinesin- 8 family are important for the regulation of spindle length and for chromosome positioning [2 – 9]. Kinesin- 8 proteins are length-specific, plus-end-directed motors that are proposed to be either MT depolymerases [3, 4, 8, 10, 11] or MT capping proteins [12]. How Kif 18 A uses its destabilization activity to <b>control</b> <b>spindle</b> morphology is not known. We found that Kif 18 A controls spindle length independently of its role in chromosome positioning. The ability of Kif 18 A to <b>control</b> <b>spindle</b> length is mediated by an ATP-independent MT binding site at the C-terminal end of the Kif 18 A tail that has a strong affinity for MTs in vitro and in cells. We used computational modeling to ask how modulating the motility or binding properties of Kif 18 A would affect its activity. Our modeling predicts that both fast motility and a low off rate from the MT end are important for Kif 18 A function. In addition, our studies provide new insight into how depolymerizing and capping enzymes can lead to MT destabilization...|$|E

Second, we find that asymmetric plasma membrane elongation occurs in response to spindle mispositioning to alter the cellular boundaries relative to the spindle. Asymmetric membrane elongation is promoted by chromosome-derived Ran-GTP signals that locally reduce Anillin at the growing cell cortex.

To identify new mitotic spindle assembly regulators, we isolated 855 microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs) from Drosophila melanogaster mitotic or interphasic embryos.

We found that Ensconsin/MAP 7 mutant neuroblasts display shorter metaphase spindles, a defect caused by a reduced microtubule polymerization rate and enhanced by centrosome ablation. In agreement with a direct effect in regulating spindle length, Ensconsin overexpression triggered an increase in spindle length in S 2 cells, whereas purified Ensconsin stimulated microtubule polymerization in vitro. Interestingly, ensc-null mutant flies also display defective centrosome separation and positioning during interphase, a phenotype also detected in kinesin- 1 mutants.

40|$|SummaryFemale meiosis {{in higher}} organisms {{consists}} of highly asymmetric divisions, which retain most maternal {{stores in the}} oocyte for embryo development. Asymmetric partitioning of the cytoplasm results from the spindle's “off-center” positioning, which, in mouse oocytes, depends mainly on actin filaments [1, 2]. This is a unique situation compared to most systems, in which spindle positioning requires interactions between astral microtubules and cortical actin filaments [3].

Currently, we cannot explain how this dynamic structure generates and responds to forces while maintaining overall stability, as we have a poor understanding of its micromechanical properties.

We find that spindle viscosity depends on microtubule crosslinking and density. Spindle elasticity can be linked to kinetochore and nonkinetochore microtubule rigidity, and also to spindle pole organization by kinesin- 5 and dynein.

We also show that the lack of first polar body extrusion in fmn 2 −/− oocytes is not {{due to a lack of}} cortical differentiation or central spindle formation but to a defect in the late steps of cytokinesis.

40|$|SummarySpindle {{positioning}} is {{an essential}} feature of asymmetric cell division. The conserved PAR proteins together with heterotrimeric G proteins <b>control</b> <b>spindle</b> positioning in animal cells, but how these are linked is not known. In C. elegans, PAR protein activity leads to asymmetric spindle placement through cortical asymmetry of Gα regulators GPR- 1 / 2. Here, we establish that the casein kinase 1 gamma CSNK- 1 and a PIP 2 synthesis enzyme (PPK- 1) transduce PAR polarity to asymmetric Gα regulation. PPK- 1 is posteriorly enriched in the one-celled embryo through PAR and CSNK- 1 activities. Loss of CSNK- 1 causes uniformly high PPK- 1 levels, high symmetric cortical levels of GPR- 1 / 2 and LIN- 5, and increased spindle pulling forces. In contrast, knockdown of ppk- 1 leads to low GPR- 1 / 2 levels and decreased spindle forces. Furthermore, loss of CSNK- 1 leads to increased levels of PIP 2.

Proper spatiotemporal localization of the evolutionarily conserved Gαi-LGN-NuMA protein complex is critical for mitotic spindle orientation, but how this is achieved remains unclear.

We show that SAPCD 2 is essential to instruct planar mitotic spindle orientation in both epithelial cell cultures and mouse retinal progenitor cells in vivo. Loss of SAPCD 2 randomizes spindle orientation, which in turn disrupts cyst morphogenesis in three-dimensional cultures, and triples the number of terminal asymmetric cell divisions in the developing retina. Mechanistically, we show that SAPCD 2 negatively regulates the localization of LGN at the cell cortex, likely by competing with NuMA for its binding.

40|$|Accurate {{positioning}} of the mitotic spindle is critical to ensure proper distribution of chromosomes during cell division. The small GTPase Ran, which regulates a variety of processes throughout the cell cycle, including interphase nucleocytoplasmic transport and mitotic spindle assembly, was recently shown to also <b>control</b> <b>spindle</b> alignment. Ran {{is required for the}} correct cortical localization of LGN and nuclear-mitotic apparatus protein (NuMA), proteins that generate pulling forces on astral microtubules (MTs) through cytoplasmic dynein. Here we use importazole, a small-molecule inhibitor of RanGTP/importin-β function, to study the role of Ran in spindle positioning in human cells. We find that importazole treatment results in defects in astral MT dynamics, as well as in mislocalization of LGN and NuMA, leading to misoriented spindles. Of interest, importazole-induced spindle-centering defects can be rescued by nocodazole treatment, which depolymerizes astral MTs, or by overexpression of CLASP 1, which does not restore proper LGN and NuMA localization but stabilizes astral MT interactions with the cortex.

40|$|The {{mechanism}} of chromatin compaction in mitosis {{has been well}} studied, while {{little is known about}} what controls chromatin decompaction in early G 1 phase. We have localized the Condensin subunit Brn 1 to a compact spiral of rDNA in mitotic budding yeast cells.

We immunoprecipitated the GTP-exchange factor Lte 1, which helps activate the mitotic exit network (MEN) in anaphase, with mitotic Brn 1. In lteΔ cells Brn 1 release was delayed, even at temperatures that do not impair mitotic exit. Mutations in MEN pathway components that act downstream of Lte 1 similarly delayed rDNA decompaction. We found that Brn 1 release in wild-type cells coincided with the release of Cdc 14 phosphatase from the nucleolus and with mitotic CDK inactivation, yet it could be selectively delayed by perturbation of the MEN pathway.

40|$|Through a {{functional}} genomic screen for mitotic regulators, we identified hepatoma up-regulated protein (HURP) as a protein {{that is required}} for chromosome congression and alignment. In HURP-depleted cells, the persistence of unaligned chromosomes and the reduction of tension across sister kinetochores on aligned chromosomes resulted in the activation of the spindle checkpoint. Although these defects transiently delayed mitotic progression, HeLa cells initiated anaphase without resolution of these deficiencies. This bypass of the checkpoint arrest provides a tumor-specific mechanism for chromosome missegregation and genomic instability. Mechanistically, HURP colocalized with the mitotic spindle in a concentration gradient increasing toward the chromosomes. HURP binds directly to microtubules in vitro and enhances their polymerization. In vivo, HURP stabilizes mitotic microtubules, promotes microtubule polymerization and bipolar spindle formation, and decreases the turnover rate of the mitotic <b>spindle.</b> Thus, HURP <b>controls</b> <b>spindle</b> stability and dynamics to achieve efficient kinetochore capture at prometaphase, timely chromosome congression to the metaphase plate, and proper interkinetochore tension for anaphase initiation...|$|R

40|$|AbstractAnaphase, mitotic exit, and {{cytokinesis}} {{proceed in}} rapid succession, and while mitotic exit {{is a requirement}} for cytokinesis in yeast [1, 2], {{it may not be}} a direct requirement for furrow initiation in animal cells [3, 4]. In this report, we physically manipulated the proximity of the mitotic apparatus (MA) to the cell cortex in combination with microinjection of effectors of the spindle checkpoint and CDK 1 activity to determine how the initiation of cytokinesis is coupled to the onset of anaphase and mitotic exit. Whereas precocious contact between the MA and the cell surface advanced the onset of cytokinesis into early anaphase A, furrowing could not be advanced prior to the metaphase-anaphase transition. Additionally, while cells arrested in anaphase could be induced to initiate cleavage furrows, cells arrested in metaphase could not. Finally, activation of the mitotic checkpoint in one spindle of a binucleate cell failed to arrest cytokinesis induced by the <b>control</b> <b>spindle</b> but did inhibit the formation of furrows between the arrested MA and the control, nonarrested MA.

Under displacement control, neural responses during the HVLA-SM increased in a fashion graded with thrust amplitude.

40|$|Correct {{orientation}} of cell division {{is considered an}} important factor for the achievement of normal brain size, as mutations in genes that affect this process are among the leading causes of microcephaly. Abnormal spindle orientation is associated with reduction of the neuronal progenitor symmetric divisions, premature cell cycle exit, and reduced neurogenesis. This mechanism {{has been involved in}} microcephaly resulting from mutation of ASPM, the most frequently affected gene in autosomal recessive human primary microcephaly (MCPH), but it is presently unknown how ASPM regulates spindle orientation. In this report, we show that ASPM may <b>control</b> <b>spindle</b> positioning by interacting with citron kinase (CITK), a protein whose loss is also responsible for severe microcephaly in mammals. We show that the absence of CITK leads to abnormal spindle orientation in mammals and insects. In mouse cortical development, this phenotype correlates with increased production of basal progenitors. ASPM is required to recruit CITK at the spindle, and CITK overexpression rescues ASPM phenotype. ASPM and CITK affect the organization of astral microtubules (MT), and low doses of MT-stabilizing drug revert the spindle orientation phenotype produced by their knockdown. Finally, CITK regulates both astral-MT nucleation and stability. Our results provide a functional link between two established microcephaly proteins...|$|E
40|$|Because {{cohesion}} prevents sister-chromatid {{separation and}} spindle elongation, cohesion dissolution may trigger these two events simultaneously. However, the relatively normal spindle elongation kinetics in yeast cohesin mutants indicates an additional {{mechanism for the}} temporal <b>control</b> of <b>spindle</b> elongation. Here we show evidence indicating that S-phase CDK (cyclin dependent kinase) negatively regulates spindle elongation. In contrast, mitotic CDK promotes spindle elongation by activating Cdc 14 phosphatase, which reverses the protein phosphorylation imposed by S-phase CDK. Our data suggest that S-phase CDK negatively regulates spindle elongation partly through its phosphorylation of a spindle pole body (SPB) protein Spc 110. We also show that hyperactive S-phase CDK compromises the microtubule localization of Stu 2, a processive microtubule polymerase essential for spindle elongation. Strikingly, we found that hyperactive mitotic CDK induces uncoupled spindle elongation and sister-chromatid separation in securin mutants (pds 1 D), and we speculate that asynchronous chromosome segregation in pds 1 D cells contributes to this phenotype.

40|$|SummaryIn all {{eukaryotic}} cells, correct {{segregation of}} the genetic material during cell division requires proper positioning and alignment of the mitotic spindle {{with respect to the}} cell division plane. In the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, the spindle is aligned by interphase microtubules during early mitosis [1], and by astral microtubules and cell shape during late mitosis [2]. However, the mechanisms that <b>control</b> <b>spindle</b> alignment in mid-mitosis are not known. The lack of such a control could lead to extensive spindle rotation and misalignment, which, in turn, would result in chromosome mis-segregation if spindle elongation were impaired [1]. Here, we show that the association of mitochondria with the spindle poles reduces spindle rotation. In wild-type cells, spindles with associated mitochondria did not rotate as much as free spindles. In a mutant lacking the centrosomin-related protein Mto 1 p, the association between mitochondria and spindles was reduced and the spindles rotated more than those in wild-type cells. We propose that there is a symbiotic relationship between mitochondria and the mitotic spindle, in which close association between the two organelles facilitates the positioning of both: while the spindle helps to segregate mitochondria equally among the nascent daughter cells [3], mitochondria decrease spindle rotation and thus promote spindle alignment...|$|E
40|$|Muscle {{spindles}} {{are commonly}} considered as stretch receptors encoding movement, but the functional consequence of their efferent control has remained unclear. The "alpha-gamma coactivation" hypothesis states that activity in a muscle is {{positively related to}} the output of its spindle afferents. However, {{in addition to the}} above, possible reciprocal inhibition of spindle controllers entails a negative relationship between contractile activity in one muscle and spindle afferent output from its antagonist. By recording spindle afferent responses from alert humans using microneurography, I show that spindle output does reflect antagonistic muscle balance. Specifically, regardless of identical kinematic profiles across active finger movements, stretch of the loaded antagonist muscle (i. e., extensor) was accompanied by increased afferent firing rates from this muscle compared with the baseline case of no constant external load. In contrast, spindle firing rates from the stretching antagonist were lowest when the agonist muscle powering movement (i. e., flexor) acted against an additional resistive load. Stepwise regressions confirmed that instantaneous velocity, extensor, and flexor muscle activity had a significant effect on spindle afferent responses, with flexor activity having a negative effect. Therefore, the results indicate that, as consequence of their efferent <b>control,</b> <b>spindle</b> sensitivity (gain) to muscle stretch reflects the balance of activity between antagonistic muscles rather than only the activity of the spindle-bearing muscle...|$|E

40|$|Objective. Obstructive {{sleep apnea}} (OSA) {{decreases}} sleep spindle density and frequency. We evaluated {{the effects of}} continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) treatment on different features of sleep spindles. Methods. Twenty OSA patients underwent two night polysomnographies in a diagnostic phase and one night polysomnography after 6 months of CPAP treatment. The control group comprised 20 healthy <b>controls.</b> Sleep <b>spindles</b> were analyzed by a previously developed automated method. Unilateral and bilateral spindles were identified in central and frontopolar brain locations. Spindle density and frequency were determined {{for the first and}} last half of the NREM time. Results. The density of bilateral central spindles, which did not change in the untreated OSA patients, increased towards the morning hours during CPAP treatment and in the <b>controls.</b> Central <b>spindles</b> did not become faster with sleep in OSA patients and the central spindles remained slow in the left hemisphere even with CPAP. Conclusion. CPAP treatment normalized spindle features only partially. The changes may be associated with deficits in thalamocortical spindle generating loops. Significance. This study shows that some sleep spindle changes persist after CPAP treatment in OSA patients. The association of these changes to daytime symptoms in OSA patients needs to be further evaluated...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Correct {{assembly}} {{and function of}} the mitotic spindle during cell division {{is essential for the}} accurate partitioning of the duplicated genome to daughter cells. Protein phosphorylation has long been implicated in <b>controlling</b> <b>spindle</b> function and chromosome segregation, and genetic studies have identified several protein kinases and phosphatases that are likely to regulate these processes. In particular, mutations in the serine/ threonine-specific Drosophila kinase polo, and the structurally related kinase Cdc 5 p of Saccharomyces cerevisae, result in abnormal mitotic and meiotic divisions. Here, we describe a detailed analysis of the cell cycledependent activity and subcellular localization of Plkl, a recently identified human protein kinase with extensive sequence similarity to both Drosophila polo and S. cerevisiae Cdc 5 p. With the aid of recombinant baculoviruses, we have established a reliable in vitro assay for Plkl kinase activity. We show that the activity of hu-URING mitosis, replicated chromosomes (sister chromatids) segregate such that each daughter cell receives one complete copy of the genome. Chromosome segregation is a highly complex and dynamic process that relies on the {{assembly and}} function of a microtubulebased mitotic spindle apparatus (for reviews see Mclntos...|$|R
