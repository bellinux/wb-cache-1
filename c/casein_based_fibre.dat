The wheat flour (WF) was composite with cowpea flour (CF) at {{the levels of}} 10 %, 20 %, 30 % and 40 % and used for bread production. The samples of bread produced were later sliced, dried and milled systematically into bread flours. The resulting bread flours were individually formulated into test diets whereas the <b>casein</b> <b>based</b> diet was similarly formulated and used as control. After formulation, the protein quality of the test diets and the control were evaluated using the protein efficiency ratio index with thirty-five weanling albino rats. The rats which were six weeks old and weighing between 42. 3 and 44. 1 grammas were divided into five groups of seven rats each and housed in individual metabolic cages; fed diets and tap water adlibitum {{for a period of}} 21 days. From the results, the corrected protein efficiency ratio (PER) of <b>casein</b> <b>based</b> diet was 2. 5 and those of the test diets formulated from bread were 2. 18, 2. 23, 2. 30 and 2. 32 respectively.

These diets were fed to juvenile milkfish (mean initial weight 2. 60 Â± 0. 08 g) for a 22 -week experimental period. Final mean percent weight gain ranged from 1022 to 1379 % with P-free (1022 %) and Fe-free (1066 %) diets obtaining a significantly lower weight gain (p< 0. 01) than the control diet (1270 %). Survival was greater than 90 % and {{did not differ significantly}} among treatments. Upon termination of the growth experiment, milkfish flesh, bones, and combined samples of head, skin, and scales were dissected and analyzed for ash, P, Ca, Mg, Fe, Zn, and Mn content. The deletion of P or Fe from mineral mixture lowered P content in flesh and bone. Zn content in bone of fish was also lowered by exclusion of Zn, Mn, Mg or Fe.

30|$|The {{necessity}} of sustainable, non-hazardous and cost effective {{materials in the}} construction industry is inevitable. Concrete being popularly used all over the world is characterised by low strength-strain capacity in tension, and low fracture toughness. To overcome the shortcomings of plain concrete (PC), the use of reinforcing fibre has been found very effective (Thakur et al. 2014; Balaguru and Shah 1992; Barr et al. 1996; Meddaha and Bencheikh 2009; Rizkalla and Hassan 2002). The fibres can insure the post-cracking resistance, high-energy absorption features and increased fatigue resistance of cement based composites (Savastano et al. 2009). Among two different types of fibres i.e., natural fibres and artificial polymer <b>based</b> <b>fibres,</b> natural fibres are promising to use as reinforcement to overcome the inherent deficiencies in FRCC reinforced with polymer <b>based</b> <b>fibre</b> (Ramakrishna and Sundararajan 2005). The main deficiencies {{associated with the use of}} artificial fibres are: relatively high cost, health and environmental hazards.|$|R
40|$|Over {{the past}} years {{increased}} numbers of studies about {{the implementation of}} adhesive bonding in timber engineering were published. Current practice is to use two-component (2 K) epoxies and polyurethanes in conjunction with threaded steel bars, reinforced concrete bars, and rods made of fibre reinforces polymer. All these material might be considered questionable in terms of sustainable ecology. The current paper investigates the possible substitution of afore mentioned metallic bars by hardwood dowels, and the polymer based adhesives by glutine and <b>casein</b> <b>based</b> ones. It summarises experimental investigations carried out with different geometric parameters, in which beech (a hardwood) rods were glued into spruce (a softwood) blocks. Joint capacities achieved using glutine and <b>casein</b> <b>based</b> adhesives were compared with results using 2 K epoxies and 2 K polyurethane adhesives under dry conditions, and {{under the influence of}} moisture. Results indicate that current glutine and casein adhesives, if used under dry conditions, achieve similar strength; however, that the influence of moisture is still a limiting factor that severely restricts their usage under adverse conditions. The presentation of the results is completed by a numerical modelling of the considered joints, including a methodology to predict their capacity with a reasonable degree of accuracy...|$|R
40|$|Natural fibre {{composites}} are a {{fast growing}} research area, with many observable research branches. In this thesis, studies into natural fibre composites are undertaken. This includes work into the <b>base</b> <b>fibre</b> mechanical properties, pre-processing techniques {{and the influence}} of alkalisation and silanation, both common fibre processing methods used to improve interfacial properties. The effects of these pre-processing techniques were also evaluated using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR).

For the studies into the <b>base</b> <b>fibre</b> strengths, it was found that natural fibres are highly variable. with the testing complicated by difficulties in measuring cross sectional areas.

In this study, the nutritional quality of protein in Thaumatococcus danielli seed and pericarp was evaluated using 16 male waster rats (20 - 25 g). The animals {{were randomly assigned}} to 4 groups and were maintained on four isocaloric diets, namely: casein, seed, pericarp and nitrogen-free diets, for 10 days. Daily weight gain and feed intake over the last 7 days were measured. Feacal, carcass, and feed nitrogen contents were also determined {{at the end of the}} feeding trial. Protein Efficiency Ratio (PER), Net Protein Retention (NPR), Biological Value (BV), Net Protein Utilization (NPU) and True Digestibility (TD), were thereafter calculated. Mean weight gain was significantly lower (p> 0. 05) in the rats fed the T. danielli pericarp feed (- 2. 600. 80 g) than those placed on the seed (5. 460. 71 g).

The water and the ration had been offered ad libitum and had been registered the weight, the consumption of ration and protein to each two days for determination of PER (Protein Efficiency Ratio) and CEA (Coefficient of Alimentary Effectiveness).
