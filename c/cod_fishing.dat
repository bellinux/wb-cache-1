5|$|By the mid-16th century, Atlantic <b>cod</b> <b>fishing</b> {{developed}} on the Murman Coast in the north. The 1560s saw a {{rapid growth of}} international trade, with the Russian merchants from {{different regions of the}} country arriving to the peninsula to trade with the merchants from Western Europe. In 1585, however, the trade was moved to Archangel, although the settlement of Kola was still permitted to trade locally produced goods.|$|E
5|$|With {{the arrival}} of English {{soldiers}} by ship, and naval battles on the seas, areas used for salt water fishing became perilous, and lay dormant {{for much of the}} war. In addition, many of the fishing vessels were converted into warships. Before the war, there was often talk about the excess of lobsters and cod off the shores of New England. This seemed to change during and after the war, due to the vast numbers of ships and artillery entering the ocean waters. Once lobster harvesting and <b>cod</b> <b>fishing</b> was reestablished, most fishermen found that the lobster and cod had migrated away from the shores.|$|E

25|$|<b>Cod</b> <b>fishing</b> in Newfoundland {{was carried}} out at a {{subsistence}} level for centuries, but large-scale fishing began shortly after the European discovery of the North American continent in 1492, with the waters being found to be preternaturally plentiful, and ended after intense overfishing {{with the collapse of}} the fisheries in the 1990s.|$|E

40|$|Live Atlantic cod Gadus morhua were acclimated at 0 °C or 10 °C for {{at least}} three weeks and studied as well as <b>cod</b> <b>fish</b> held at ambient water {{temperature}} to determine, the effect of habitat temperature on the keeping qualities of fish during low temperature storage. Cod fillets were stored in ice (0 ± 0. 2 °C) or partially frozen (- 3 ± 0. 1 °C) for various time intervals {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} the two methods in preserving fish freshness. The criteria employed for the evaluation of biochemical deterioration were changes in (i) extractable protein, (ii) free amino acids, (iii) "extracellular area", (iv) levels of TMAO-N, TMA-N, and DMA-N, (v) free drip and (vi) cell fragility. [...] Freezing point and melting point measurements of the muscle fluids or blood plasma derived from <b>cod</b> <b>fish</b> acclimated to cold temperature (0 °C) or from <b>cod</b> <b>fish</b> caught in the winter months demonstrated thermal hysteresis, unlike similar samples derived from <b>cod</b> <b>fish</b> acclimated to warm temperature (10 °C) or <b>cod</b> <b>fish</b> maintained at ambient water temperature caught in the summer months. This finding implies that antifreeze proteins are present in the muscle fluid of <b>cod</b> <b>fish</b> when the habitat temperature is low, but absent when the habitat temperature is high. [...] Partial freezing proved to be a more effective method of minimizing biochemical damage than ice storage as judged by the capacity of the partially frozen samples (i) to retain relatively higher levels of extractable protein, (ii) to exhibit less depletion of free amino acids, (iii) to form relatively lower levels of TMA and DMA, (iv) less increase in extracellular area, and (v) to maintain better consumer acceptability during sensory evaluation studies...|$|R

The statute at issue punished false statements on an application for a subsidy for <b>cod</b> <b>fishing</b> vessels. The defendant had submitted multiple false statements. The issue was whether the first indictment—which referred only to statements required by the subsidy statute—reached all the statements named in the second indictment. The Court held that all the statements were required by the statute and thus prior jeopardy barred the second prosecution.|$|E

25|$|Another famous sealing ship {{of the era}} was the Terra Nova, {{originally}} {{built in}} 1884 for the Dundee whaling and sealing fleet. She was ideally suited to the polar regions and worked for 10 years in the annual seal fishery in the Labrador Sea. Large and expensive ships required major capital investments from British and Newfoundland firms, and shifted the industry from merchants in small outports to companies based in St. John's, Newfoundland. By the late 19th century, the sealing industry in Newfoundland was second in importance only to <b>cod</b> <b>fishing.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{earliest}} European {{trading for}} beaver pelts dated {{to the growing}} <b>cod</b> <b>fishing</b> industry that spread to the Grand Banks of the North Atlantic in the 16th century. The new preservation technique of drying fish allowed the mainly Basque fishermen to fish near the Newfoundland coast and transport fish back to Europe for sale. Drying fish enabled gathering greater yields, which justified the economic cost and time of long voyages across the Atlantic. The fisherman sought suitable harbors with ample lumber to dry large quantities of cod. This generated their earliest contact with local Aboriginal peoples, with whom the fisherman began simple trading.|$|E
25|$|The {{inhabitants}} {{have traditionally}} earned their livelihood by fishing and by servicing fishing fleets operating {{off the coast}} of Newfoundland. The climate and the small amount of available land hardly favour activity such as farming and livestock (weather conditions are severe, confining the growing season to a few weeks, and the soil contains significant peat and clay and is largely infertile). Since 1992 the economy has been in steep decline, following the depletion of fish stocks due to overfishing, the limitation of fishing areas and the ban imposed on all <b>cod</b> <b>fishing</b> by the Canadian Government.|$|E

25|$|In 2000, WWF placed cod on the {{endangered}} species list. The WWF issued a report stating the global cod catch had suffered a 70% drop over the last 30 years, and if this trend continued, the world’s cod stocks would disappear in 15 years. Åsmund Bjordal, director of the Norwegian Institute of Marine Research disputed the WWF's claim, noting the healthy Barents Sea cod population. Cod (known in Norway as skrei) is among Norway's most important fishery exports and the Barents Sea is Norway's most important cod fishery. In 2015, the Norwegian Seafood Council invited Crown Prince Haakon {{to take part in}} opening the year’s <b>cod</b> <b>fishing</b> season at Senja.|$|E
25|$|Cod {{has been}} an {{important}} economic commodity in international markets since the Viking period (around 800 AD). Norwegians traveled with dried cod and soon a dried cod market developed in southern Europe. This market has lasted for more than 1,000 years, enduring the Black Death, wars and other crises, and is still an important Norwegian fish trade. The Portuguese began fishing cod in the 15th century. Clipfish is widely enjoyed in Portugal. The Basques {{played an important role in}} the cod trade, and allegedly found the Canadian fishing banks before Columbus' discovery of America. The North American east coast developed in part due to the vast cod stocks. Many cities in the New England area are located near <b>cod</b> <b>fishing</b> grounds. The fish was so important to the history and development of Massachusetts, the state's House of Representatives hung a wood carving of a codfish, known as the Sacred Cod of Massachusetts, in its chambers.|$|E
25|$|In 2003, COSEWIC in {{an update}} {{designated}} the Newfoundland and Labrador population of Atlantic cod as endangered, and Fisheries Minister Robert Thibault announced an indefinite {{closure of the}} cod fishery in the Gulf of St. Lawrence and off the northeast coast of Newfoundland. In the Canadian system however under the 2002 Species at Risk Act the ultimate determination of conservation status (e.g. endangered) is a political, cabinet-level decision; Cabinet decided to not accept COSEWIC's 2003 recommendations. Bell has explained how both COSEWIC and public perceptions were manipulated, and the governing law broken, to favour that decision. In 2005 the WWF-Canada accused both foreign and Canadian fishing vessels of deliberate, large-scale violations of the restrictions on <b>cod</b> <b>fishing</b> on the Grand Banks, {{in the form of}} bycatch and of poor enforcement of the restrictions by NAFO, an intergovernmental organization with a mandate to provide scientific advice and management of fisheries in the northwestern part of the Atlantic Ocean.|$|E

25|$|In 1903, American Senator Henry Cabot Lodge {{advocated}} {{that the}} United States should purchase the islands from France. Lodge {{was concerned about}} the French influence on Saint Pierre and Miquelon, possible political or cultural effects on Canada and the United States, and the effect of French fishing fleets on New England fisheries. The economy of the islands had been in decline due to poor <b>cod</b> <b>fishing</b> seasons, and many residents were angry at France for insisting on approving all teachers on the islands. For these reasons, many residents of the islands were in favor of becoming part of the United States, reasoning that they could then sell their fish {{to the rest of the}} United States without import taxes, and that the United States would not interfere with their local educational system. In response, some Canadians asked Great Britain to purchase the islands from France instead. In an election for the islands' representative to the French Chamber of Deputies, one candidate was in favor of annexation while the incumbent candidate was not. The incumbent candidate, who was against annexation, won reelection by a small margin in December 1903. The islands were not purchased by either country, and they remained part of France.|$|E
500|$|The islanders also {{supported}} themselves through fishing, exploiting the high-quality catches {{that were to}} be made around the island's coasts. James Traill Calder wrote in his 1861 Sketch of the Civil and Traditional History of Caithness that [...] "The finest cod in the north is to be got in the Pentland Firth... Large and excellent lobsters are caught around the island [...]" [...] As well as trapping lobsters, the islanders practised hand line <b>cod</b> <b>fishing</b> {{in the waters of}} the Firth. This involved towing lengths of line with heavy weights and a metal rod or sprool at one end, from which hung a short length of hemp and hook baited with limpets. To encourage the fish to bite, the boats had to be held still by their rowers, which required great skill in the Firth's unpredictable currents. The island was noted for its native type of boat, the Stroma yole, which was a direct descendant of the old Norse longship.|$|E
