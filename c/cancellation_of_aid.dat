40|$|Financial Aid {{is awarded}} to {{students}} based on federal formulas {{for determining the}} need for taxpayerfunded student aid programs. Federal and state regulations require that all financial aid awards have taken into account any and all resources that students have available to meet {{the cost of their}} education. All colleges and universities are required to have a mandatory Coordination of Resources policy in place to ensure compliance with these regulations. PROCEDURES: STUDENTS are required to report all resources they receive during the school year (other than employment). Similarly, ALL UNIVERSITY CAMPUS DEPARTMENTS, OTHER ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICES AND ANY UNIVERSITY AUXILIARIES must notify the Financial <b>Aid</b> Office <b>of</b> any payments or benefits that they award to students (other than employment or short-term loans). Failure to do so, or late notification, puts the student at serious risk for overpayment <b>of</b> financial <b>aid</b> funds resulting in a reduction and or <b>cancellation</b> <b>of</b> Financial <b>Aid</b> already awarded and a billing by the University. Eligibility for all future financial aid may be affected. The entities making award decisions (rather than the disbursing agent) are required to report student resources to the Financial Aid Office.

2500|$|A Mauritanian lawmaker, Mohammed Al Mukhtar, {{claimed that}} many of the country's people {{supported}} the takeover of a government that had become [...] "an authoritarian regime" [...] under a president who had [...] "marginalized the majority in parliament." [...] The coup was also backed by Abdallahi's rival in the 2007 election, Ahmed Ould Daddah. However, Abdel Aziz's regime was isolated internationally, and became subject to diplomatic sanctions and the <b>cancellation</b> <b>of</b> some <b>aid</b> projects. It found few supporters (among them Morocco, Libya and Iran), while Algeria, the United States, France and other European countries criticized the coup, and continued to refer to Abdallahi as the legitimate president of Mauritania. Domestically, a group of parties coalesced around Abdallahi to continue protesting the coup, which caused the junta to ban demonstrations and crack down on opposition activists. International and internal pressure eventually forced the release of Abdallahi, who was instead placed under house arrest in his home village. The new government broke off relations with Israel. In March 2010, Mauritania's female foreign minister Mint Hamdi Ould Mouknass announced that Mauritania had cut ties with Israel in a [...] "complete and definitive way." ...|$|R

40|$|Disbursements <b>of</b> foreign <b>aid</b> are {{influenced}} by other agents than the donor and the recipient. When donors enforce conditionality upon recipients who do not implement the conditions, northern companies can suffer from <b>cancellation</b> <b>of</b> their contracts with the recipient when aid dry up. Anticipating this, such companies can influence the donors to disburse the aid even if the recipient has not implemented the conditions. Strategic recipients will use this interdependence to avoid implementing any conditions {{they are not in}} favor of. We propose a new model where each of the three agents takes account of each of the two other agent’s actions. In this structure, the recipient’s strategic behavior explains the failure <b>of</b> <b>aid</b> conditionality. 1...|$|R

As a result, the province of Central Java became the region with the largest <b>cancellation</b> <b>of</b> local regulation in Indonesia, which is as many 90 -local regulations cancelled.

The method of writing uses a normative approach with qualitative analysis to detect the level of synchronization and harmonization of the application of local regulations. The results indicate that the <b>cancellation</b> <b>of</b> local regulation by the Governor as the representative of the central government shows an erroneous logic of the implementation of local autonomy.
