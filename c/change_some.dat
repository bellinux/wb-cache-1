5|$|Although slight {{changes in}} water level affect many species, {{the system as}} a whole also cycles and pulses with each <b>change.</b> <b>Some</b> transformations to the {{diversity}} of plant and animal life are natural, caused by fire or storms, and some are induced by humans, such as urban encroachment, the introduction of exotic species, and rapid global warming. Environmental conditions in the Everglades favor no particular species. Some species, such as snail kites and apple snails, do well in wet conditions, but wood storks and Cape Sable seaside sparrows (Ammodramus maritimus mirabilis) do well in dryer circumstances.|$|E

During the passage, the vessel {{encountered}} heavy {{weather in the}} Bay of Biscay, and after reporting a leakage of oil, was instructed to head towards Brest, France, at reduced speed. However, {{the origin of the}} leak was discovered and stopped. The vessel proceeded on its original planned course, arriving in Bantry Bay on 4 January 1979.|$|E
5|$|While demonstrating {{excellent}} results, {{this campaign}} showed {{the need to}} <b>change</b> <b>some</b> of the aerodynamic features of the weapon. To compensate for delays in AASM deliveries in 2008 France ordered dual-mode (laser- and GPS/INS-guided) GBU-49 Enhanced Paveway II kits for integration with Mirage 2000D and Rafale fighter-bombers. The GPS/INS + IIR guided version completed its qualification tests on July 9, 2008 after three firings at the DGA's missile test range in Biscarosse. This 250kg IR version performed a night launch from a Rafale fighter-bomber at DGA's Biscarosse test range in December 2010.|$|E

5|$|As {{early as}} the late 1380s and early 1390s, Isabeau {{demonstrated}} that she possessed diplomatic influence when the Florentine delegation requested her political intervention in the Gian Galeazzo Visconti affair. Orléans and the Duke of Burgundy were in the pro-Visconti faction while the anti-Visconti faction included Isabeau, her brother, Louis VII, Duke of Bavaria, and John III, Count of Armagnac. At that time Isabeau lacked the political power to effect <b>change.</b> <b>Some</b> years later, however, at the 1396 wedding of her seven-year-old daughter, Isabella, to Richard II of England (an event at which Charles attacked a herald for wearing Galeazzo's livery), Isabeau successfully negotiated an alliance between France and Florence with Florentine ambassador Buonaccorso Pitti.|$|E
5|$|The unmarked {{bills from}} the robbery {{were easy to}} exchange, but the serial numbers of the 500-ruble notes were known to the authorities, making them {{impossible}} to exchange in Russian banks. By the end of 1907, Lenin decided to exchange the remaining 500-ruble notes abroad. Krasin had his forger try to <b>change</b> <b>some</b> of the serial numbers. Two hundred of these notes were transported abroad by Martyn Lyadov (they were sewn into his vest by the wives of Lenin and Bogdanov at Lenin's headquarters in Kuokkala). Lenin's plan was to have various individuals exchange the stolen 500-ruble notes simultaneously {{at a number of}} banks throughout Europe. Zhitomirsky heard of the plan and reported it to the Okhrana, who contacted police departments throughout Europe asking them to arrest anyone who tried to cash the notes.|$|E

25|$|The reburial was {{controversial}} {{and one of}} the largest ever to have occurred in the United States. Some researchers thought the remains should have been preserved for more study. However, so much skeletal evidence was gathered that many studies were still made through the mid-1990s, based on measurements, photographs, and radiographs of the remains taken during those three years. New (21st Century) analyses of the dates on the massacre and the occupational history of the site are also being made, which may <b>change</b> <b>some</b> interpretations.|$|E
25|$|An entirely {{different}} form of perfectionism has arisen {{in response to}} rapid technological <b>change.</b> <b>Some</b> techno-optimists, especially transhumanists, avow a form of perfectionism in which the capacity to determine good and trade off fundamental values, is expressed not by humans but by software, genetic engineering of humans, artificial intelligence. Skeptics assert that rather than perfect goodness, it would be only the appearance of perfect goodness, reinforced by persuasion technology and probably brute force of violent technological escalation, which would cause people to accept such rulers or rules authored by them.|$|E
25|$|Hungary's {{transition}} to a Western-style democracy {{was one of the}} smoothest among the former Soviet bloc. By late 1988, activists within the party and bureaucracy and Budapest-based intellectuals were increasing pressure for <b>change.</b> <b>Some</b> of these became reform socialists, while others began movements which were to develop into parties. Young liberals formed the Federation of Young Democrats (Fidesz); a core from the so-called Democratic Opposition formed the Alliance of Free Democrats (SZDSZ), and the national opposition established the Hungarian Democratic Forum (MDF). Civic activism intensified to a level not seen since the 1956 revolution.|$|E

25|$|In {{the early}} years of independence, {{existing}} Chinese, Tamil and mission schools accepted government funding and were allowed to retain their medium of instructions on the condition that they adopt the national curriculum.

25|$|As {{with all}} models, {{this is an}} {{idealized}} picture of population change in these countries.

Many countries such as China, Brazil and Thailand have passed through the Demographic Transition Model (DTM) very quickly due to fast social and economic <b>change.</b> <b>Some</b> countries, particularly African countries, appear to be stalled in the second stage due to stagnant development and the effect of AIDS.|$|E

25|$|The moral {{influence}} view can {{be combined}} {{with some of the}} other views of atonement. Indeed, Methodist theologian Vincent Taylor, while regarding the moral influence theory of atonement as inadequate by itself, described the moral influence theory as the 'truth' that is the 'presupposition of any worthy doctrine of the Atonement'. In the early centuries of the church, the moral influence view focused around the issue of how people can pass God's final judgment (namely through positive moral <b>change).</b> <b>Some</b> other atonement views, such as ransom from Satan, have nothing to say about final judgment and deal with other concerns. Such views can therefore be easily held in combination with the moral influence view.|$|E
25|$|When the manga began serialization, Arakawa was {{considering}} several major plot points, including the ending. She wanted the Elric brothers to recover their bodiesat least partly. As the plot continued, {{she thought that}} some characters were maturing and decided to <b>change</b> <b>some</b> scenes. Arakawa said the manga authors Suihō Tagawa and Hiroyuki Eto are her main inspirations for her character designs; she describes her artwork as a mix of both of them. She found that the easiest of the series's characters to draw were Alex Louis Armstrong, and the little animals. Arakawa likes dogs so she included several {{of them in the}} story. Arakawa made comedy central to the manga's story because she thinks it is intended for entertainment, and tried to minimize sad scenes.|$|E
