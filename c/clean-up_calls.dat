40|$|In our {{article we}} present {{the use of}} hybrid {{securities}} in the privatization process. We show that exchangeable bonds may be successfully applied during privatization of state companies throughout the world. It may be profitable for many reasons. Firstly, the exchangeables offer a much lower coupon {{in comparison with the}} ordinary government bonds which may be crucial for highly indebted countries. Secondly, throughout the entire maturity period the state remains the owner of the privatized firm which means that the government can be a beneficiary of high dividends paid by the public enterprises and can actively manage them. Thirdly, in the case of unfavorable market conditions the authorities get an opportunity to wait for the end of economic turmoil in order to avoid selling the equity participations under their true value. Finally, the issue of certain types of exchangeables (e. g. callable exchangeables or mandatory exchangeables) and adding several provisions (e. g. greenshoe option or <b>clean-up</b> <b>call)</b> makes the instrument more flexible for the issuer. We also present a few examples of the privatization processes by means of exchangeable bonds i. a. in Germany and in Austria. Most of such operations, e. g. German Deutsche Post, Austrian Telekom Austria or Portuguese Galp Energia SGPS S. A. were completed with success...|$|R

In high voltage tubes, the accelerated ions can penetrate into the electrode materials.

40|$|Health {{effects in}} {{connection}} with the Chernobyl explosion, which occurred 26 April 1986, are of widespread concern in Israel because about 100, 000 people immigrated into the country from possibly contaminated zones between 1990 and 1993. Nonmalignant health disorders associated with Chernobyl exposure have been reported in populations from many regions of Byelorus, Ukraine, and Russia. Health problems are especially prominent among people who were deliberately exposed due to their involvement in cleanup work after the disaster (1 - 3). These <b>clean-up</b> workers are <b>called</b> "liquidators" because they participated in liquidating the sequelae of the Chernobyl nuclear power station disaster. A major problem in the study of such environmental contamination is that valid and reliable measurements of exposure are not generally available (4).

50|$|The {{investigation}} of the murders was hampered from the beginning by several false leads. The theory of the crime {{at the time of}} the arrest was that Camm returned home from playing basketball, shot his family, attempted a clean-up, before abandoning the <b>clean-up</b> attempt and <b>calling</b> the Sellersburg State Police post for help. Rob Stites, a crime scene photographer who was believed by the police to be a blood spatter analyst, told police there was a clean up at the crime scene and high velocity impact spatter on the shirt Camm was wearing. Another piece of seemingly incriminating evidence was a phone bill seeming to indicate Camm had made a phone call from the residence at 7:19 pm on the evening of the murder. He claimed to be playing basketball at the church from 7pm to approximately 9:30pm that evening. Camm also had had a history of infidelity, which police believed was the motive for the murders.|$|R
40|$|International audienceProduction Planning(PP) aims {{at making}} {{production}} decisions optimizing the Manufactur-ing and Supply Chain performances. Given {{a limited amount}} of manufacturing resources, raw materials, and inventory space,PP minimizes the overall manufacturing and supply chain costs while meeting service levelrequirements and obeying operational constraints. In this research we focus on the sequence-dependent set-up costs which occur when we change a product production during manufac-turing. In real-world manufacturing, this cost typically depends on both the predecessor andcurrent production. The set-up costs are also <b>called</b> <b>clean-up</b> costs, changeover costs or start-upcosts (in the literature). These costs are one important part of the production costs for manyreal-world production systems. The set-up costs optimization may dramatically affect the qual-ity of the production plans in terms of machine operational efficiency, cycle time, service leveland inventory turns. Finally, different levels of details are typically taken into considerationwhich largely affect the complexity of the resulting models. In this work, we study a real-worldPP problem with sequence-dependent set-up costs and we propose different formulations withdifferent levels of details of the operational constraints...|$|R
40|$|Halogenated {{hydrophobic}} {{organic compounds}} (HHOCs) such as 1, 2, 4, 5 -tetrachlorobenzene (TeCB) present {{a threat to}} both {{human health and the}} environment. The common occurrence and recalcitrant nature of HHOCs as soil contaminants necessitate an effective soil remediation method. Wee and Cunningham (2008, 2011, 2013) proposed a <b>clean-up</b> technology <b>called</b> Remedial Extraction and Catalytic Hydrodehalogenation (REACH), which pairs solvent extraction of HHOC contaminants from soil with catalytic hydrodehalogenation to destroy contaminants. Wee and Cunningham (2008, 2011, 2013) utilized a palladium (Pd) catalyst to hydrodehalogenate TeCB to benzene. However, benzene is still a toxic contaminant. Prior research has demonstrated that Pd-catalyzed hydrodehalogenation (HDH) can be paired with Rh-catalyzed hydrogenation to transform TeCB to cyclohexane, which is a less toxic end product (Osborn 2011; Ticknor 2012). However, there remains a need to quantify the effects of different operating conditions on the catalytic reaction rates upon which the technology relies. It was hypothesized that (1) an increased ratio of water to ethanol in water/ethanol solvents would increase the reaction rates of both Pd-catalyzed HDH and Rh-catalyzed hydrogenation, and (2) catalytic reaction rates would be constant above a hydrogen pressure threshold, but would decrease with decreasing hydrogen pressure beneath the threshold. Thus, the objective of this thesis was to {{contribute to the development of}} optimal operating parameters for the REACH technology by quantifying the effects of solvent composition and hydrogen pressure on the catalytic conversion of TeCB to cyclohexane in water/ethanol solvents in a batch reactor. Complete conversion of TeCB to cyclohexane was achieved at all experimental conditions tested. The data were consistent with an apparent first-order kinetics model where Pd-catalyzed HDH and Rh-catalyzed hydrogenation occur in series. The effects of three water/ethanol solvent compositions (33 : 67, 50 : 50, 67 : 33) were investigated at 50 psi hydrogen pressure. HDH rate coefficients increased monotonically with an increasing fraction of water in the solvent. When the water fraction in the solvent was increased from 50 % to 67 %, a larger HDH rate coefficient increase was observed than when the water fraction was increased from 33 % to 50 %. In both cases, the observed increases were statistically significant at a 95 % confidence level. For hydrogenation, rate coefficients at 33 % and 50 % water were approximately equal. The hydrogenation rate coefficient at 67 % water was much greater than the rate coefficients at 50 % and 33 % water, but the increase was not statistically significant at a 95 % confidence level. The observed time for complete conversion of TeCB to cyclohexane decreased with an increasing fraction of water in the solvent, from 12 - 18 hours with a 33 % water solvent to 8 - 12 hours with a 50 % water solvent, and to 1 - 1. 5 hours with a 67 % water solvent. The effects of three hydrogen pressures (50 psi, 30 psi, 10 psi) were investigated with a 50 : 50 water/ethanol solvent. HDH rate coefficients increased monotonically with decreasing hydrogen pressure, though the trend was not statistically significant at a 95 % confidence level until the pressure was decreased from 30 psi to 10 psi. This trend can be attributed to the displacement of TeCB by hydrogen on the catalyst surface at higher hydrogen pressures. For hydrogenation, the data suggest that rate coefficients are independent of hydrogen pressure in the pressure range of 10 - 50 psi, since no statistically significant hydrogen pressure effect was observed. Complete conversion of TeCB to cyclohexane was achieved at hydrogen pressures as low as 5 psi. These findings suggest that a greater fraction of water in the solvent should be utilized in the REACH system when feasible to maximize catalytic reaction rates. These findings also suggest that the REACH system could be operated at hydrogen pressures as low as 5 psi, which would further improve the safety of the technology...|$|R
