Of course, we know that vessels have been several times taken by the Spaniards, while at anchor close to the towns; but they might risk that, if there were no danger from the Moors, themselves. But if the reports last sent by Mr. Logie are confirmed, the Moors would be openly at war with us; and would, themselves, seize and make prizes of vessels anchoring. The danger would, of course, be vastly greater than that of merely running the risk of capture, if a Spanish vessel of war happened to come into a port where they were at anchor. Of course, I am merely expressing the views of the governor." ...|$|E

50|$|Her {{left arm}} started giving her {{more and more}} burden and pain and the arm started to grow crooked. She had less and less {{movement}} in her left arm and noticed that, in relation to her right arm, the left arm seemed to be shorter. She {{had to return to}} the hospital and there they discovered that the epiphysis of the radius was so damaged during her fall, that one bone was no longer growing. Because the other bones in her arm are still growing, her left arm is growing crooked. This growth disorder is also known as Madelung's deformity. Only, in Kruger's case, the disorder is caused by a trauma and is not a hereditary or congenital defect. Because of these problems she had to undergo multiple surgeries, including an operation to extend the bone, where a pin was inserted to the non-growing bone, with a swivel mechanism on the outside. For three months she had to tighten the screws every day, in order to slightly lengthen the bone. This radical surgery did not do what the doctors hoped for and the doctor declared her inoperable in August 2014. As far as trying to extend the non-growing bone, the bone had been pushed over her carpal bones, which only caused her to have less movement in her wrist. So she has limited movement in her wrist, she can not turn her arm, <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>put</b> any pressure on her arm and can not hang on it. Her left arm is now about 7 centimetres shorter than the right arm and her left hand is a little bit smaller than her right hand. She has virtually no strength in her left hand and therefore 70% less strength in her left arm in comparison to her right arm. Until she stops growing she has to have, regular check-ups at the Erasmus hospital in Rotterdam, {{to see if there is}} a need for emergency surgery because of the imbalance. But it will never be all right again.|$|E

5000|$|Hackenschmidt {{was also}} given to {{depression}} and irascibility. When {{he came to}} Chicago to train for his first match with Gotch, promoter Jack Curley had arranged for Hackenschmidt to work out every day before a paying public, which Hack refused to do. Barred from the athletic club, he spent his time before the match either exercising in his room or taking morning and evening walks along Lake Michigan, but no serious workouts. The more depressed he got, the more difficult he was to work with, and this all worked against him because, {{for the first time}} in his professional career, Hackenschmidt faced a foe fully capable of defeating him. Finally, and worst of all, in both matches with Gotch, Hackenschmidt was accused of lack of heart. Referee Ed Smith, following the 1908 match, said that [...] "deep down in my own mind, I decided that George Hackenschmidt had quit - quit quite cold, as a matter of fact - because there was nothing about Gotch's treatment of him in that first encounter that could by a stretch of the imagination call for a disqualification. There was some face-mauling, just as there always is... but at no time did the vaunted Hackenschmidt ever make a serious move toward slapping down his opponent, never showed much in the wrestling line during the entire two hours... Again, I say, that as the referee of that match, I thought that the 'Russian Lion' quit". Following the 1911 rematch, one newspaper described Gotch's easy victory and then added that [...] "in the parlance of the sporting world, Hackenschmidt is yellow... He quit when his position became dangerous". Perhaps the most frustrated was Hackenschmidt's second, Dr. Benjamin Roller, who himself had lost several times to Gotch, but had displayed the utmost gameness and courage. [...] "Hack did not get started", Roller explained. [...] "That's largely a matter of gameness". Hackenschmidt's injuries had not been serious enough, Roller felt. [...] "I have tried my best to make a winner out of him and put him into the ring in the best possible condition, but... gameness is something you <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>put</b> into a man".|$|E

40|$|Objective: Attention {{deficit and}} {{hyperactivity}} disorder (ADHD) is a neuropsychiatric disorder which is commonly seen in childhood. Depending on {{the severity of}} the disease, ADHD effects negatively in terms of harmony in social life events and self esteem. The aim {{of this study is that}} to compare adaptation skills of children with ADHD and their mothers’ capacity of coping with stressful events or problem solving in the real life. Method: The Kovacs Depression Scale, the Spielberger State Trait Anxiety Inventory for Children and the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC-R) were applied to the children while the Problem Solving Inventory was applied to the mothers. The sample was consisted of 49 ADHD children, diagnosed according to the DSM-IV criteria, aged 6 to 9 years (8. 11 ± 1. 34) and their mothers. Results: There were no significant differences among ADHD subtypes in terms of WISC-R Verbal, Performance and Total Intelligence sections. In terms of subtypes, there were no significant differences in both children’ ability of judgement and their mothers’ problem solving skills. Besides that, a high relationship hasn’t been observed between problem-solving skills of the mothers and their children’s ability of judgement. The relationship between the judgement ability of the children and their mother’s perception about feeling insufficient, which was obtained from result of subparameters of the Problem Solving Inventory (confidence and personal) was meaningful. Discussion: Because of disruptive behaviors, difficulty in social relationship and lack of problem solving skills, children with ADHD get negative reactions from their environment and mostly they are punished. Children with ADHD often get criticized, because they actually know what to do but they <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>put</b> that into practice. Conclusion: In order to improve the self esteem of children with ADHD, there should be appropriate adult behavioral model, also these children should be included in problem solving and should not be criticized constantly. These will allow children with ADHD to adapt themselves to social life...|$|E
40|$|For every {{marketer}} {{that focuses}} on the internal data their computers generate, change is passing them by. “Managers have come to rely heavily on the computer’s information and you <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>put</b> into the computer data that you don’t have. Because of the plethora of inside information that the computer spits out, day in and day out, {{a very large number of}} executives spend all the time with these internal figures. The information you need the most and not just in business – is about the outside world. ” (Drucker, 1997). With this prevalent internal focus, no matter how many CRM, KM, BI systems an organisation implements and pays for, marketers are not going to dramatically improve the strategic effectiveness or competitiveness of organisations in their chosen markets. Don’t get me wrong. Customer learning is clearly important, but equally important is good marketing strategies, which come from making effective choices in light of your external environment. It is only through the careful collection, examination and evaluation of the facts, concerning your external environment, that appropriate strategic alternatives can be weighed in light of existing organizational resources and requirements. Every good manager recognises the need for systematic analysis of their marketplace, the competition and the external environment. Yet analysis is one of the more difficult roles a marketing specialist is called upon to perform. Surprisingly, most people do some form of analysis on a regular basis throughout their lives – when they buy a house, a car or go on a holiday. Every business also does some form of analysis whether it is looking at customers, product improvements, benchmarking, or cost savings. However, in light of constantly changing market dynamics, marketers need to do it better…. So what is analysis? Analysis involves a variety of scientific and non-scientific techniques to create insights or inferences from data or information. It is the multifaceted combination of processes by which collected information is systematically interpreted to create strategic findings and recommendations for actions. Analysis answers that critical “so what? ” question about the information gathered, and brings insight to bear directly on the marketer’s needs...|$|E
