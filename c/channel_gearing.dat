Thus the audiences of ethnic media still do not feel their cultures’ complexities are represented accurately or at all. The ethnic broadcasts that focused on cultural events did not serve their needs and the ethnic audiences wanted more “inclusive and representative storytelling”. The ethnic television stations lack of legitimacy in mainstream realm further affects the minorities’ view of them.

The study {{was based on a}} content analysis of a one week sample of programs televised on broadcast network channels (ABC, CBS, NBC, FOX, CW) and on the cable channel BET (Black Entertainment Television) in the fall of 2012 (late September/ early October). A textual analysis was used as a complementary method to understand how African Americans are depicted on BET and whether these messages reflect the cultural perspective. This group is of interest because African Americans have been found misrepresented and underrepresented in past television representations thus influencing perception about the group to adults, children and adolescents of color. Cultivation theory and social cognitive theory serve as the foundation for this study. The content analysis found more differences than similarities in the way that African Americans are portrayed in broadcast network programs as compared to BET. The qualitative (textual) analysis identified three themes in movies on BET which helped further distinguish differences between the portrayals of African Americans on BET as compared to broadcast network programs. With these results and cultivation theory and social cognitive theory in mind, viewers of color and others can develop empowering and non-empowering perceptions about African Americans.

This paper examines the issue of media brand management {{through the lens of}} brand personality. It argues that an effective brand management strategy needs to ensure coherence across the multiple brand personalities present within the brand architecture. The research on media branding has become increasingly prominent {{to the extent that it}} is now a distinct and quickly evolving discipline (Ots, 2008; Chan-Olmsted and Kim, 2010; Siegert et al 2015). Whilst this research adds to our understanding of brands that exist in a media context, we also believe that our findings could lay the foundations for generalizability on how to manage multiple brand personalities within a broader architecture. Our research draws on the seminal work of Aaker (1997) and her conceptualisation of brand personality as the human characteristics associated with a brand. We also argue that multiple personalities, within a brand architecture, need to be coherently managed in order to successfully engage audiences who tend to endorse brands that are consistent with their own notion of ‘self’ (Forster, 2015). Our paper will present the findings from a large scale survey of audience members who were asked to classify human characteristics associated with personalities within a branded house architecture (Aaker and Joachimsthaler, 2000) consisting of the BBC (network), BBC 2 (<b>channel),</b> Top <b>Gear</b> (programme) and Chris Evans (programme talent). Descriptive and inferential statistics will be used to examine our theoretical framework and we will conclude that the management of multiple brand personalities will be more effective when the personalities ‘fit’ with each other and that the ineffective management of these brand personalities will ultimately lead to multiple personality disorder...|$|R
40|$|University of Minnesota Ph. D. dissertation. December 2011. Major: Electrical Engineering. Advisor: Professor Jaekyun Moon. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); xi, 97 pages. Iterative decision-directed (DD) channel estimation (CE) and detection algorithms for multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems are investigated. A main {{strength of the}} MIMO-OFDM is a potential capability to support high data rates. However, interference between MIMO antennas has been a serious obstacle to high data rate communication. Accurate channel state information (CSI) is critical to reduce antenna interference and improve throughput performance of the MIMO-OFDM communication systems. First, we develop soft-decision-driven sequential CE algorithms specific to turbo equalization for the MIMO communication. Two kinds of channel estimators are proposed: an optimal Kalman-based <b>channel</b> estimator <b>geared</b> to the pipelined turbo equalizer and a low-complexity estimator design for practical implementation. An effective strategy is established for the channel estimators dealing with different qualities of feedback decisions from the turbo equalizer. The proposed CE algorithms employ puncturing on observation samples to effectively deal with the inherent correlated error input that cannot easily be removed by the traditional innovations approach. Performance of the optimal estimator is excellent at compensating loss due to imperfect CSI; however, computational complexity of the MIMO CE becomes a challenge {{as the number of}} MIMO antenna links increases in practical systems. The proposed lowcomplexity algorithm resolves the MIMO channel estimation problem into a single-input single-output CE form to avoid heavy computation load associated with matrix operations. Also, in order to reduce packet losses due to the inherent correlated error, a novel packet recovery scheme is introduced that reprocesses failed packets by innovating on the inaccurate CSI. The recovery scheme detects erroneous OFDM-symbol locations by comparing extrinsic (EXT) information from the turbo equalizer. For the error correction, it applies additional turbo iterations to the erroneous OFDM symbols with the innovated CSI. In demonstrating the viability of the proposed schemes, a MIMO-OFDM communication system is constructed to comply with the IEEE 802. 11 n WLAN standard...|$|R
30|$|For {{orthogonal}} {{frequency division}} multiplexing (OFDM) communications over mobile wireless channels, {{after an initial}} acquisition is completed for time and frequency synchronization [1, 2], residual or fine carrier frequency offset (CFO) and time variation of the channel impulse response (CIR) will continue to exist due to Doppler shift, multipath fading, and/or local oscillator instability [3]. Therefore, fine CFO and CIR variation must be frequently tracked [3]. A majority of the methods proposed in the literature for CFO and CIR estimation either singly addresses CFO or CIR estimation. That is, either perfect CFO synchronization is assumed in deriving CIR estimations [4 – 14] or perfect CIR estimation is assumed in deriving CFO synchronization algorithms [15 – 17]. A more practical implementation is to jointly track CFO and CIR simultaneously. The commonly adopted scheme for tracking CFO and/or CIR {{is to use a}} maximum likelihood (ML) estimation algorithm coupled with the aid of an alternate and adaptive iteration algorithm [3, 18 – 20]. But there exists a major difficulty, namely, the local extrema or multiple solution complication arising from the highly nonlinear nature of the log-likelihood function. A most direct and straightforward approach is the use of the steepest descent or the gradient method as given in [18]. Two hurdles in the gradient method are the starting point and the adaptive step size for the adaptive iteration process. For the algorithm to work well so that the adaptive process will converge to the global solutions, proper or careful choice must be made of the starting point as well as the value or range of the step size. Often when the environment or the channel is changed, these choices will become different and hence must be re-established by a new search. Usually, the search is by trial and error and can be a nuisance. Therefore, theoretically the gradient method may be perfectly workable, but practically it may not be so conveniently implementable. An alternative is to use mathematical approximations. For example, for what is called the joint maximum likelihood channel and frequency estimation (JML-CFE) algorithm given in [19], the authors used the frequency-domain expression of the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) output at the OFDM receiver where two terms containing CFO are approximated by truncating Taylor series expansions beyond the second order terms, one being the desired carrier term and the other the inter-carrier interference (ICI) term. The resultant approximate output expression was used to form an approximate log-likelihood function. They then took partial differentiations of this approximate log-likelihood function respectively with respect to CIR and CFO to obtain a set of gradients and set them to equal zeros thus establishing a system of simultaneous equations in terms of CIR and CFO (Note that, for frequency-selective channels, the CIR is actually a multi-dimensional vector whose dimension equals the channel length). Solving the simultaneous equations leads to approximate solutions for the CFO and the CIR estimators. The log-likelihood function is a second order polynomial in CFO after the Taylor series truncation. Therefore, partial differentiation with respect to CFO will result in a first order polynomial in CFO. So the approximation is eventually of the first order level. Based on the estimator solutions as obtained above, adaptive iterations can then be performed alternately to jointly estimate data, CFO, and CIR in a decision-directed fashion. However, their solutions are very lengthy and cumbersome making the whole algorithmic process extremely tedious and complex. Another example of joint CFO and CIR estimation technique for OFDM based on iterative approximation is the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm given in [20]. There, for what is called the expectation step, a minimum-mean-square error (MMSE) estimate of CIR conditioned on CFO was first derived from the log-likelihood function for the time-domain received signal. Then, for what is called the maximization step, conditioned on the MMSE channel estimate, an approximate expression was obtained for the log-likelihood function by truncating the Taylor series expansion of a term involving CFO beyond the second order term. Setting to zero the partial differentiation of this approximate log-likelihood function with respect to CFO yielded the CFO estimate. For the same reason as argued above, this approximation is also of the first order level. Adaptive iterations were then performed alternately between the expectation and maximization steps to produce the final CFO and CIR estimators. There are some shortcomings in the above EM-based approach. First, the MMSE channel estimate in the expectation step requires the knowledge of noise power and the channel covariance information. Second, the MMSE criterion for estimating the <b>channel</b> is not <b>geared</b> to maximizing the log-likelihood function. Thus, it is expected that the MMSE channel estimator will not perform as well as an ML channel estimator.|$|R
