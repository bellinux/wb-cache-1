30|$|S. nigrum {{has been}} {{commonly}} {{used as a}} traditional medicine for treating various diseases. It {{has been used to}} treat inflammation, oedema and other related disorders since time immemorial. It is commonly known as ‘Black nightshade’ and has been extensively used in traditional medicine in India and other parts of world to cure liver disorders, chronic skin ailments (psoriasis and ringworm), inflammatory conditions, painful periods, fevers, diarrhea, eye diseases, hydrophobia and as a folk medicine for treatment of peptic ulcer [5]. In traditional medicine, the plant has also been used as an anti-diarrhoeal, in eye diseases and hydrophobia [6]. Chinese medicine employs the juice of the leaves to alleviate pain in inflammation of the kidney and bladder and internally for <b>cardialgia</b> [5].|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis {{experiment}} {{was designed to}} determine the relative degree of cardiac functional recovery provided by various forms of resuscitative retrograde blood cardioplegia after global ischemic injuy. Twenty-four dogs were subjected to 20 minutes of normothermic global ischemia followed by 60 minutes of cardioplegic arrest by one of three methods: 1, standard cold blood <b>cardialgia</b> with a cold terminal dose (n = 8); 2, aspartate-glutamate–enhanced blood with warm induction and terminal enhancement (n = 8); and group 3, countinous warm blood cardioplegia (n = 8). Sonomichrometry was used to analyze left ventricular function for maximal elastance and preload recruitable stroke work area. Data were recorded at baseline and preload recruitable stroke work area, but not of maximal elastance, after reperfusion of ischemic differences were detectable among the groups after 60 minutes of unloaded reperfusion. Neither amino acid enchancement nor continuous warm cardioplegia offered a significant advantage in functional recovery over the standard method of cold cardioplegia reperfusion.

40|$|Coronary {{heart disease}} (CHD) and its {{complications}} occupy the leading {{place in the}} pattern of the causes of untimely death in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Objective: to study the incidence, pattern, and specific features of CHD in patients with RA. Patients and methods. An analytical cross-sectional study was conducted in 257 patients with RA (ARA, 1987). The patients’ mean age was 55. 4 ± 11. 6 years; RA duration was 14. 7 years (range 2 — 20 years). Results. The incidence of CHD in RA was as much as 45. 9 % (n = 118), including 52. 5 % (n = 62) for typical angina pectoris on exertion; 25. 4 % (n = 30) and 22. 1 % (n = 26) for silent ischemia and arrhythmias, respectively. A high proportion of vertebrogenic <b>cardialgias</b> (48. 8 %; n = 100) were noted in those who complained of heart pain. The authors identified traditional risk factors, such as hypertension (OR = 12. 1), smoking (OR = 10. 2), early menopause (OR = 3. 6), decreased glomerular filtration rate (OR = 3. 5), cardiovascular heredity (OR = 3. 1), overweight (OR = 2. 5), a heart rate of more than 70 beats/min (OR = 2. 3), atherogenic dyslipidemia (OR = 2. 3), hyperglycemia (OR = 2. 1), and age (OR = 1. 7). Along with those, the authors also ascertained CHD predictors associating with chronic inflammation consequences: use of glucocorticoids (OR = 5. 0), concomitant anemia as a common complication of RA (OR = 4. 7), high DAS 28 scores (OR = 3. 7), visual analog scale pain scores of > 50 mm (OR = 2. 6), and RA duration of > 10 years (OR = 2. 2). Conclusion. The specific features of CHD in RA include the frequent detection of arrhythmias and silent ischemia. The importance of the degree of inflammatory activity along with the traditional risk factors of CHD is apparent...|$|R
40|$|Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) {{are rare}} mesenchymal {{tumors of the}} {{gastrointestinal}} tract that originate from the intestinal cells of Cajal (ICC) (Fletcher et al., 2002). Only a few cases have been described with extragastrointestinal stromal tumors (Kim et al., 2012; Soufi et al., 2013; Meng et al., 2011). They are often diagnosed as a pancreatic head tumor as they {{are very difficult to}} relate to the duodenum with CT, MRI, or ultrasound. We present a case of a sixty-four-year-old woman who presented with abdominal pain and <b>cardialgia</b> for a follow-up examination after breast cancer surgery. On laparotomy there was a 3 [*]×[*] 5 [*]cm hypervascular mass arising from the pancreatic head with macroscopically no attachment to the duodenum. The patient underwent pancreatoduodenectomy (PD) modified after Traverso-Longmire, histopathology proved a duodenal GIST.

40|$|Purpose. To {{study the}} {{effectiveness}} of various schemes of correction of repolarization disorder syndrome, including {{with the use of}} beta-blockers, in young athletes of the initial training group. Materials and methods. At the first stage, 410 children involved in sports sections were examined. The average age of the examined was 12. 22 ± 3. 11 years. At the second stage, the athletes (boys) of the initial training group were selected from the surveyed contingent, engaged in martial arts. The groups were formed: A – people with violation of myocardial repolarization processes (72 patients, the average age 10, 50 ± 0, 35 years), the control group – people without changes in an electrocardiogram (33 people, the average age 10. 36 ± 0, 62 years old). All underwent an electrocardiographic study at rest and after physical activity on the Innomed HS 80 GL apparatus with analysis of the main indicators. The vegetative status and the state of adaptation were estimated by Kerdo index and adaptive potential by Baevsky. After the examination, the subgroup A 1 (40 people) was prescribed metabolic and antioxidant drugs. Additionally, in the subgroup A 2 (32 people), a non-selective beta-blocker was included in the treatment regimen. The course of treatment is 10 days. The analysis of indicators was carried out in 10 days and in a month after the initiation treatment. Statistical processing was carried out in the program Statistica. Results. An earlier disappearance of <b>cardialgia</b> was determined in the subgroup A 2 (p < 0. 05), whereas in the subgroup A 1, 5 % of patients had complaints not only {{at the end of the}} course, but also a month later after the initiation treatment. The more rapid positive dynamics of the electrocardiographic pattern with a more stable result was observed with the prescription of a beta-blocker. Conclusion. It was proved the advisability of prescribing of beta-blockers in the treatment of beginning athletes with violation of myocardial repolarization against sympathicotonia...|$|E
