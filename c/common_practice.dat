Machinima takes copyrighted property (such as characters in a game engine) and repurposes it to tell a story, but another <b>common</b> <b>practice</b> in machinima-making is to retell an existing story from a different medium in that engine.|$|E

40|$|<b>Common</b> <b>practices,</b> whether {{recognized}} or not as {{a source}} of law, represented an area of great importance in economic practice and judicial bodies, especially in maritime and river transport, but also rail and air transport. The Civil Code of 1864 made some references to local custom, while the new Civil Code provisions establish that practices are sources of law. In this way was settled a particularly sensitive area, namely, the existence and applicability of <b>common</b> <b>practices</b> in special matters such as those on business, commercial transactions, financial and otherwise, being directly related to maritime and river transport.

The Spanish government in the Canary Islands prevented a Ukrainian freighter from delivering 636tons of military equipment to Angola on 24 February 2001. The captain of the ship had inaccurately reported his cargo, falsely claiming the ship carried automobile parts. The Angolan government admitted Simportex had purchased arms from Rosvooruzhenie, the Russian state-owned arms company, and acknowledged the captain might have violated Spanish law by misreporting his cargo, a <b>common</b> <b>practice</b> in arms smuggling to Angola.|$|E
