The band also showcased the album in its entirety in a local talk-show, Fax, famous for being the first stereophonic TV transmission in Argentinian history. The album, eventually released {{near the end of}} 1992, is stylistically a shoegazing album, and was met with alienation and shock from many fans of the band, who found its radical shift in style from Canción Animal discomforting and challenging to cope with. Surrounding the band's rushed decision to <b>change</b> <b>record</b> companies from BMG to Sony immediately before the disc's release, Dynamo failed to sell as expected, and remains the lowest-selling album of Soda's career today.|$|E

5000|$|As an {{existing}} talent {{manager in the}} Los Angeles area, Goetz first heard the Red Hot Chili Peppers in 1983, playing at the Kit Kat Club, a burlesque bar owned by Eddie Nash. [...] Band members Anthony Kiedis and Flea thereafter visited Goetz' offices and proposed that he manage the group, which he agreed to do. Goetz thereafter negotiated a seven-album contract for the band with EMI Records. [...] Goetz was also instrumental in negotiations when the band wished to <b>change</b> <b>record</b> labels, ultimately moving to Warner Bros. Records in 1990. Goetz remained as manager of the band until 1998, when he chose to leave music management and retire to Ojai, California. [...] His consistent loyalty to the band is considered to have been instrumental to its success.|$|E

The polarization characteristics {{of these two}} four-level phase <b>change</b> <b>recording</b> media are analyzed systematically.

The results show that a high-contrast polarization readout can be obtained in an extensive wavelength range for the four-level phase <b>change</b> <b>recording</b> media using common phase change materials. This study will help in-depth understanding of the physical mechanisms and provide technical approaches to multilevel phase <b>change</b> <b>recording...</b>|$|R

50|$|The lineup was {{expanded}} in 1982 with keyboard player Steve Libby (brother of Dave) from Bristol band Stereo Models, moving the sound from post-punk to new wave. They {{returned to the}} studio in 1982 and recorded several tracks for the follow-up album. However, {{due to lack of}} promotion by Teldec the band decided to <b>change</b> <b>record</b> labels. Years of touring Europe had taken its toll on the band and they returned to the UK, but split up before finding another deal. The album Everybody's Gonna Be Happy was never released as a CD and Teldec has been taken over, so it seems unlikely that the album will ever be re-released. However, secondhand copies of the album and single are popular with collectors of new wave music. Richard Snow, Dave and Steve Libby went on to form the new wave electronic band Force Majeure.|$|E

5000|$|Hold Your Fire (1987) {{represents}} both {{a modest}} {{extension of the}} guitar stylings found on Power Windows, and the culmination of this era of Rush. Lifeson, like many guitarists in the late 1980s, began experimenting with processors that reduced his instrument to echoey chord colorings and razor-thin leads. Most Rush fans now agree that Lifeson's contributions on these two albums were secondary to Geddy Lee's bass playing and keyboard-sequencer arrangements. Whereas the previous five Rush albums sold platinum or better, Hold Your Fire only went gold in 1987. This would convince the group to <b>change</b> <b>record</b> labels from Mercury Records to Atlantic in 1989. A third live album and video, A Show of Hands (1989), was also released by Mercury following the Power Windows [...] and Hold Your Fire tours, demonstrating the aspects of Rush in the 1980s. This {{was followed by the}} release of a two volume compilation entitled Chronicles by Mercury in 1990 as a chronological repackaging of the band's material between 1974 and 1989.|$|E
