40|$|The {{emergence}} of Concurrent Engineering has caused growing demands on project management. The classic project management methods are often slow: problems may already exist when those methods are applied. The {{objective of the}} present study is to improve the opportunities of those responsible for a project's operational management to receive advance information about potential problems and final results through early warnings typical of the theory of weak signals by Igor Ansoff. The research examines the background of Ansoff's theory, the way in which project theories treat project problems, the causes of problems, and possible early warnings. Other aspects of the phenomenon investigated in this study include its relation to project risk management and its communicational character. A survey of the relevant literature shows that project literature contains some discussion of early warnings. However, only a few studies have the phenomenon as their main focus; similarly, research on the Ansoff theory is sparse. A number of studies concerning early warnings can be found in other fields, such as military science and general business economics. In addition, communications studies are familiar with the concept of weak signals, which is analogous to the concept of early warnings. An examination of project literature shows that certain factors in a project - early warnings detected in project work, project problems, and the causes of those problems - may form chains. The interpretation of these factors may vary depending on the perspective and the time of observation. In addition, they can to some extent be considered subsets of one set (as defined by set theory). The research was conducted using a qualitative research method. A total of seventeen project experts were interviewed using the semistructured (thematic) interview method, which was also used to identify and examine early warnings in four case projects. Almost 900 such statements were observed. These observations were grouped according to similar characteristics, after which the various factors were analyzed qualitatively as well as according to percent distributions, both individually and through multiple attribute examination. The empirical research shows that stimuli (signals, messages) that comply with communications theory {{can be found in the}} project environment. These signals and messages are always to some degree inaccurate, and making decisions based on them is difficult. To clarify the meaning of these messages, the present study examines the general character of the early warnings phenomenon and designs an explanatory model that illustrates the communicative character of the phenomenon as well as the stages of decision-making. Further, the study develops a hierarchical <b>classification</b> <b>of</b> <b>warning</b> signals, complete with signal type categorization and descriptive typology, and draws up categorizations to help in signal identification. The categorizations are formed using eight (8) different factors. In addition, the relationship between early warnings, project problems, and problem causes is investigated; the dependence network designed of these three factors plus the responses they require furnishes some of the most important data for further utilization. Furthermore, this study designs a fundamental model for the utilization of the early warnings phenomenon. This model, and the results of the present research in general, can be used to identify early warnings. For the present, the data provided by this research have to be handled manually, which may be somewhat laborious. To aid utilization in the future, the study proposes a way to incorporate early warnings to the Risk Management Knowledge-Based program created by Kiyoshi Niwa. The study provides project management and project risk management theories with additional information about the early warnings phenomenon, which has not been extensively studied, but which is widely known among project management specialists. The study defines the phenomenon and makes it easier to comprehend. A broader utilization of the phenomenon, however, requires further research. reviewe...|$|E

40|$|Static {{analysis}} tools for software defect detection are becoming {{widely used in}} practice. However, there is little public information regarding the experimental evaluation of the accuracy and value <b>of</b> the <b>warnings</b> these tools report. In this paper, we discuss the warnings found by FindBugs, a static analysis tool that finds defects in Java programs. We discuss the kinds <b>of</b> <b>warnings</b> generated and the <b>classification</b> <b>of</b> <b>warnings</b> into false positives, trivial bugs and serious bugs. We also provide some insight into why static {{analysis tools}} often detect true but trivial bugs, and some information about defect warnings across the development lifetime of software release. We report data on the defect warnings in Sun’s Java 6 JRE, in Sun’s Glassfish JEE server, and in portions of Google’s Java codebase.

30|$|While {{looking at}} the {{recognition}} rate for each individual class in Figs. 8, 9, and 10 (c), all danger prediction rates are stable from medium to high resolution, except for outdoor stairs at the highest resolution (Fig. 8 (c)). In outdoor stairs at high resolution, some dangers can still be classified as warnings when the stairs start {{to appear in the}} lower sub-image. All warning prediction rates decrease with increasing resolution. The quality of the depth map affects the <b>classification</b> <b>of</b> <b>warnings</b> that tend to be predicted as dangers or safe. However, the safe prediction rate in indoor scenes gets higher with increasing resolution while it tends to decrease in outdoor scenes (Figs. 8, 10 (c)). This behaviour indicates the influence of the illumination and the texture. The outdoor reflection glare has a negative impact on the depth map extraction. The texture of indoor scenes is improved with increasing resolution. In any of the three groups, the classification between critical scenes and harmless places presents a very low false positive rate despite a slight increase at the lowest resolution.|$|R
40|$|This paper investigates whether investors react rationally to the {{announcements}} <b>of</b> profit <b>warnings</b> in the Norwegian {{stock market}} by examining abnormal returns, information leakage and post-announcement drift. A <b>classification</b> <b>of</b> the <b>warnings</b> {{has been made}} to analyze whether the information content inherent in quantitative- and qualitative warnings has an effect on the market reaction. The sample includes 184 profit warnings from 2005 to 2012, where 144 of them are quantitative and 40 qualitative. The mean price reaction to the profit warnings on the announcement day was - 5. 25 % and we report a mean CAR of - 6. 36 % in the event window [- 1, + 1]. Contrary to many existing studies, this paper provides evidence of a greater market reaction to quantitative warnings than qualitative. This disparity decreases somewhat over time as qualitative warnings experience a significant one-day delayed market reaction of CAAR equal to - 2. 1 %. Distinguishing between positive and negative disclosures reveals that bad news result in a greater market reaction than good news...|$|R

Warning quality and container hazardousness were manipulated as within subjects variables, severity of injury as a between subjects variable. Two levels of each variable were used, high and low. Participants viewed the four possible combinations <b>of</b> <b>warning</b> quality and container hazardousness and then responded to various questions concerning their perceptions and retention <b>of</b> <b>warning</b> information. The results demonstrated the importance <b>of</b> <b>warning</b> quality. Enhanced features such as pictorials, signal words, safety icons, and color increase warning salience and recollection <b>of</b> <b>warning</b> information. The results also indicate that the hazardousness of containers influences whether people read warning labels and subsequent reports of cautious intent. However, its influence is modified by both severity <b>of</b> injury and <b>warning</b> quality...|$|R

40|$|Many {{animals are}} toxic or {{unpalatable}} and signal this to predators with warning signals (aposematism). Aposematic appearance {{has long been}} a classical system to study predator-prey interactions, communication and signalling, and animal behaviour and learning. The area has received considerable empirical and theoretical investigation. However, most research has centred on understanding the initial evolution of aposematism, despite the fact that these studies often tell us little about the form and diversity <b>of</b> real <b>warning</b> signals in nature. In contrast, less attention has been given to the mechanistic basis of aposematic markings; that is, 'what makes an effective warning signal?', and the efficacy <b>of</b> <b>warning</b> signals has been neglected. Furthermore, unlike other areas of adaptive coloration research (such as camouflage and mate choice), studies <b>of</b> <b>warning</b> coloration have often been slow to address predator vision and psychology. Here, we review the current understanding <b>of</b> <b>warning</b> signal form, with an aim to comprehend the diversity <b>of</b> <b>warning</b> signals in nature. We present hypotheses and suggestions for future work regarding our current understanding of several inter-related questions covering the form <b>of</b> <b>warning</b> signals and their relationship with predator vision, learning, and links to broader issues in evolutionary ecology such as mate choice and speciatio...|$|R
40|$|Code reviews {{have been}} {{conducted}} since decades in software projects, {{with the aim of}} improving code quality from many different points of view. During code reviews, developers are supported by checklists, coding standards and, possibly, by various kinds of static analysis tools. This paper investigates whether warnings highlighted by static analysis tools are taken care of during code reviews and, whether there are kinds <b>of</b> <b>warnings</b> that tend to be removed more than others. Results of a study conducted by mining the Gerrit repository of six Java open source projects indicate that the density <b>of</b> <b>warnings</b> only slightly vary after each review. The overall percentage <b>of</b> <b>warnings</b> removed during reviews is slightly higher than what previous studies found for the overall project evolution history. However, when looking (quantitatively and qualitatively) at specific categories <b>of</b> <b>warnings,</b> we found that during code reviews developers focus on certain kinds of problems. For such categories <b>of</b> <b>warnings</b> the removal percentage tend to be very high, often above 50 % and sometimes up to 100 %. Examples <b>of</b> those are <b>warnings</b> in the imports, regular expressions, and type resolution categories. In conclusion, while a broad warning detection might produce way too many false positives, enforcing the removal <b>of</b> certain <b>warnings</b> prior to the patch submission could reduce the amount of effort provided during the code review process...|$|R

40|$|Because of the {{importance}} of noticeability on subsequent comprehension and compliance to warnings, guidelines suggest increasing the salience or conspicuity <b>of</b> <b>warnings.</b> Surprisingly, little research has examined different methods of increasing the noticeability <b>of</b> <b>warnings.</b> The current research orthogonally manipulated four salience variables (pictorial, color, signal icon and border) to determine their effect on the salience <b>of</b> <b>warnings.</b> Subjects viewed 96 simulated alcohol labels on a computer, half with a warning and half without. Subjects indicated whether or not a warning was on the label and response latencies were recorded. The results showed that all four salience features produced significantly faster response times compared to their absence. More detailed analyses showed interactions between the four salience manipulations. These results demonstrate that salience features can enhance the noticeability <b>of</b> <b>warning</b> information. Moreover, it is clear that these salience manipulations interact with each other and that they should not be used indiscriminately...|$|R
