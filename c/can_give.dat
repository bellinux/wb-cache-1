5|$|A few teleosts are dangerous. Some, like eeltail catfish (Plotosidae), scorpionfish (Scorpaenidae) or {{stonefish}} (Synanceiidae) have venomous spines {{that can}} seriously injure or kill humans. Some, like the electric eel and the electric catfish, <b>can</b> <b>give</b> a severe electric shock. Others, {{such as the}} piranha and barracuda, have a powerful bite and have sometimes attacked human bathers. Reports indicate {{that some of the}} catfish family can be large enough to prey on human bathers.|$|E

5|$|After all, {{young people}} are always searching for the beauty in love. They want their love to be beautiful. If they give in to weakness, {{following}} the models of behavior that can rightly be considered a 'scandal in the contemporary world' (and these are, unfortunately, widely diffused models), {{in the depths of}} their hearts they still desire a beautiful and pure love. This is as true of boys as it is of girls. Ultimately, they know that only God <b>can</b> <b>give</b> them this love. As a result, they are willing to follow Christ, without caring about the sacrifices this may entail.|$|E
5|$|Another way of {{estimating}} {{the age of}} the cluster is by looking at the lowest-mass objects. In normal main-sequence stars, lithium is rapidly destroyed in nuclear fusion reactions. Brown dwarfs can retain their lithium, however. Due to lithium's very low ignition temperature of 2.5 × 106 K, the highest-mass brown dwarfs will burn it eventually, and so determining the highest mass of brown dwarfs still containing lithium in the cluster <b>can</b> <b>give</b> an idea of its age. Applying this technique to the Pleiades gives an age of about 115 million years.|$|E
5|$|Batman, District Attorney Harvey Dent and Lieutenant Jim Gordon form an {{alliance}} to rid Gotham of organized crime.

5|$|Bismuth is a {{chemical}} element with symbolBi and atomic number 83. Bismuth, a pentavalent post-transition metal {{and one of}} the pnictogens, chemically resembles its lighter homologs arsenic and antimony. Elemental bismuth may occur naturally, although its sulfide and oxide form important commercial ores. The free element is 86% as dense as lead. It is a brittle metal with a silvery white color when freshly produced, but surface oxidation <b>can</b> <b>give</b> it a pink tinge. Bismuth is the most naturally diamagnetic element, and has one of the lowest values of thermal conductivity among metals.|$|E

5|$|Filming {{took place}} during the first months of 2006. The main hurdle came up with the location. Barjatya wanted to shoot film in an {{authentic}} way. He asked the film's art director Sanjay Dhobade to create the entire town of Madhupur that <b>can</b> <b>give</b> a realistic look, particularly portions where water leaking takes place and portions where spit marks were visible {{on the walls of the}} buildings in the film. Later, the town was created in film city, Mumbai. Outdoor session of the film was done in Delhi, Lonavla, Ranikhet, Nainital and Almora.|$|E

Pregnant women deficient of iodine <b>can</b> <b>give</b> birth to infants with thyroid hormone deficiency.

5|$|It is {{possible}} that many transient phenomena might not {{be associated with the}} Moon itself but could be a result of unfavourable observing conditions or phenomena associated with the Earth. For instance, some reported transient phenomena are for objects near the resolution of the employed telescopes. The Earth's atmosphere <b>can</b> <b>give</b> rise to significant temporal distortions that could be confused with actual lunar phenomena (an effect known as astronomical seeing). Other non-lunar explanations include the viewing of Earth-orbiting satellites and meteors or observational error.|$|E
