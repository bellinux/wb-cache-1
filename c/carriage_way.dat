2500|$|The route, {{known as}} the Navan Road as it leaves Dublin, starts at its {{junction}} with the M50 motorway (Junction 6) and then bypasses Blanchardstown, Mulhuddart and Clonee with a dual carriageway. The dual carriageway changes into the M3 motorway near the Meath border by-passing Dunshaughlin and Navan. Near Kells the route continues as the N3 dual <b>carriage</b> <b>way</b> to the border with County Cavan. [...] It then passes through Virginia, past Cavan Town and continues past Butlersbridge and through Belturbet. The route then crosses the border with Northern Ireland, becoming the A509 to Enniskillen. The A46 connects Enniskillen and the Donegal border, becoming the N3 across the border at Belleek, and connecting to Ballyshannon. [...] In Ballyshannon certain road signs have destinations A46 Enniskillen with N3 Dublin with the requisite single arrow pointing in the same direction.|$|E

[...] On Wednesday 11 December 2002, several motorists telephoned to report that a car had veered off the A3. Dispatched officers found no sign of a newly crashed vehicle at the scene but did discover the wreckage of a Vauxhall Astra, containing the remains of a man, no more than [...] from the reported crash site. The car was buried in twisted undergrowth, nose-down in a ditch, invisible from the road. A police spokesman later said: [...] "We believe the car left the road and ended up in the ditch during July. It doesn't appear that any other vehicles were involved. The car was discovered {{as a result of a}} report from members of the public who thought they saw a car's headlights veering off the road." ...|$|E

Additionally, the road surface has a {{constant}} 1% gradient. The girder bridge was built with a single superstructure for both <b>carriage</b> <b>ways,</b> and is positioned approximately a kilometer to the north of Wasserbillig in Luxembourg.|$|R
25|$|The roads {{along the}} both banks are {{constructed}} for the easy movement of traffic along north-south direction. They are constructed with footpaths, parking bays, <b>carriage</b> <b>ways</b> and cycle tracks. The roads leading to river are strengthened for better movement and access. The West River Drive decongestants the Ashram Road and has 25m RoW. The East River Drive provides better north-south access to east {{part of the}} city and direct road to airport. It has 30m RoW.|$|R
60|$|The horses, kept always by Alfred in {{the very}} best condition, trotted forward at a rapid rate, leaving scores of omnibuses, cabs, and citadines behind, and keeping pace with the splendid chariots of the French and English {{aristocracy}} that thronged the avenue. Presently Rollo observed a peculiar movement among the carriages before them, {{as if they were}} making way for something that was coming; {{and at the same time}} he saw hundreds of people running forward from the groves and booths, across the side avenues, to the margin of the <b>carriage</b> <b>way.</b>|$|E
6000|$|Suddenly his quick ear {{detected}} {{the sound of}} wheels in the ruts of the <b>carriage</b> <b>way.</b> Usually his visitors to the casa came on horseback, and carts and wagons used only the lower road. As the sound approached nearer, an odd fancy filled his heart with unaccountable pleasure. Could it be Mrs. Peyton making an unexpected visit to the rancho? He held his breath. The vehicle was now rolling on into the patio. The clatter of hoofs and a halt were followed by the accents of women's voices. One seemed familiar. He rose quickly, as light footsteps ran along the corridor, and then the door opened impetuously to the laughing face of Susy! ...|$|E

[173] Andrew knows Latin, {{and might}} have coined the word in his conceit; but, writing to a kind friend in Glasgow, I find the brook was called 'Molyndona' even before the {{building}} of the Sub-dean Mill in 1446. See also account of the locality in Mr. George's admirable volume, Old Glasgow, pp. 129, 149, &c. The Protestantism of Glasgow, since throwing that powder of saints into her brook Kidron, has presented it with other pious offerings; and my friend {{goes on to say that}} the brook, once famed for the purity of its waters (much used for bleaching), 'has for nearly a hundred years been a crawling stream of loathsomeness. It is now bricked over, and a <b>carriage</b> <b>way</b> made on the top of it; underneath the foul mess still passes through the heart of the city, till it falls into the Clyde close to the harbour.' ...|$|E
50|$|Another {{replacement}} {{bridge was}} built and entered service in 1897, lasting until 1969, {{when it was}} demolished. In the meantime, ferries were used to transport people and goods. This second bridge was designed by Alfred Barton Brady. It was constructed of steel and had two <b>carriage</b> <b>ways</b> and two footpaths. As early as 1943 evidence of the bridge buckling from the weight of increased traffic was noticed. Tram numbers on the bridge had to be restricted and the footpath removed as a result.|$|R
60|$|The Australians did {{not seem}} to me to differ noticeably from Americans, either in dress, <b>carriage,</b> <b>ways,</b> pronunciation, inflections, or general appearance. There were {{fleeting}} and subtle suggestions of their English origin, but these were not pronounced enough, as a rule, to catch one's attention. The people have easy and cordial manners from the beginning --from the moment that the introduction is completed. This is American. To put it in another way, it is English friendliness with the English shyness and self-consciousness left out.|$|R
60|$|They {{passed out}} of Bonn {{by means of a}} most {{singular}} avenue. It was formed of a very broad space in the centre, which seemed, by its place, to have been intended for the road way; but instead of being a road way, it was covered with a rich growth of grass, like a mowing field. On each side of this green were two rows of trees, which bordered a sort of wide sidewalk, of which there were two, one {{on each side of the}} road. These side passages were the <b>carriage</b> <b>ways.</b>|$|R

50|$|By {{the start}} of the 20th century, Ferril Lake, the Denver Zoo, and the {{landmark}} boat pavilion, with a Spanish-style design by architects John Humphreys and William Fisher were all developed in the park. Reinhard Schuetze, a German immigrant who was the head landscaper for Denver, formalized the design of the park by planting of formal gardens, laying down graceful <b>carriage</b> <b>ways,</b> and creating the East High School Esplanade into the park. In 1903, construction was completed for the first wing of the Denver Museum of Nature and Science, which was built on {{the eastern edge of the}} park on the highest elevation in the park (now famous for its views of downtown and the mountains behind them). It opened to the public on July 1, 1908.|$|R

The Torrens Road to River Torrens project addresses the major intersections with Grange and Port Roads, the Outer Harbor railway line crossing, and several minor road intersections. Both of these upgrades involve land acquisition to widen the road corridor, surface grade <b>carriage</b> <b>ways</b> on the edges, and a lowered central roadway carrying the free-flow traffic below the crossing routes. The Torrens to Torrens project was started in 2015, and is expected to be completed by the end of 2018.|$|R
