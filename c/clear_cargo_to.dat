Customs plays {{a pivotal role}} in international trade transactions and in this paper, the use of an automated systems approach to the processes involved in cargo clearance is highlighted. The successful implementation of automation projects largely depends on an effective project team and the unequivocal commitment of senior management. Better results can be achieved by simplifying procedures in accordance with international best practices instead of simply automating manual systems. From traditional tasks to trade facilitation Customs formalities at border crossings are key elements in international trade insofar as they serve to monitor and control the movement of goods and passengers through customs barriers. The collection of revenue by way of duties and taxes {{is one of the main}} activities of any customs administration. The percentage of revenue collected by the customs administrations of developing countries can be up to 50 per cent of total government revenue.

The World Customs Organization (WCO), the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), the World Trade Organization (WTO) and other international organisations all promote trade facilitation.
