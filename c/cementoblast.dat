50|$|A <b>cementoblast</b> is a {{biological}} cell that forms from the follicular cells around {{the root of}} a tooth, and whose biological function is cementogenesis, which is the formation of cementum (hard tissue that covers the tooth root). The mechanism of differentiation of the cementoblasts is controversial but circumstantial evidence suggests that an epithelium or epithelial component may cause dental sac cells to differentiate into cementoblasts, characterised {{by an increase in}} length.

40|$|Objective: To {{develop a}} new <b>cementoblast</b> culture method and to detect bone sialoprotein (BSP) {{expression}} in response to high and low mechanical tensile stress in <b>cementoblast</b> in vitro. Materials and Methods: Cementoblasts were collected from the roots of newborn bovine teeth and were identified with cementum-derived attachment protein (CAP) antibody 3 G 9. Cell proliferation was evaluated by MTT [3 -(4, 5 -dimethylthazol- 2 -yl) - 2, 5 -diphenyl tetrazolium bromide] assay, and mineralization was confirmed by von Kossa staining. Mechanical tensile stress was applied in vitro to the <b>cementoblast</b> {{with the use of}} a uniaxial four-point bending system with 2000 or 4000 microstrains, at a frequency of 0. 5 Hz for 3, 6, 12, 24, or 36 hours. BSP mRNA level was quantified by real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Results: A large amount of <b>cementoblast</b> was observed to be expressing CAP. Cementoblasts had a proliferation tendency similar to that of osteoblasts but different from that of periodontal ligament (PDL) cells. Cementoblasts had the ability to become mineralized between osteoblasts and PDL cells. The mechanical tensile stress significantly up-regulated BSP mRNA expression, which reached a peak at 24 hours in both 2000 and 4000 microstrain groups (P <. 01) and was tenfold and sixfold higher than that of controls, respectively. BSP expression dropped toward baseline levels at 36 hours in both groups. Conclusions: Mechanical tensile stress up-regulated the expression of BSP. Low mechanical tensile stress induced earlier and more intensive up-regulation of BSP mRNA; this might represent the optimal stimuli for <b>cementoblast</b> activity...|$|E

However, the characteristics of Runx 2 and osterix during the differentiation process of <b>cementoblasts</b> remain unclear. In this study, we examined the immunolocalization patterns of Runx 2, osterix, and osteopontin during rat molar tooth formation. Periodontal ligament cells and osteoblasts located on the alveolar bone surface showed immunoreactivity for Runx 2.

40|$|It is {{generally}} accepted that <b>cementoblasts</b> {{originate in the}} process of differentiation of mesenchymal cells of the dental follicle. Recently, a different hypothesis for the origin of <b>cementoblasts</b> has been proposed. Hertwig's epithelial root sheath cells undergo the epithelial-mesenchymal transformation to differentiate into <b>cementoblasts.</b> To elucidate whether the epithelial-mesenchymal transformation occurs in the epithelial sheath, developing rat molars were examined by keratin-vimentin and Runx 2 (runt-related transcription factor 2) -keratin double immunostaining. In both acellular and cellular cementogenesis, epithelial sheath and epithelial cells derived from the epithelial sheath expressed keratin, but did not express vimentin or Runx 2. Dental follicle cells and <b>cementoblasts,</b> however, expressed vimentin and Runx 2, but did not express keratin. No cells showed coexisting keratin-vimentin or Runx 2 -keratin staining. These findings suggest that there is no intermediate phenotype transforming epithelial to mesenchymal cells, and that epithelial sheath cells do not generate mineralized tissue.

40|$|Intermediate {{progenitor}} populations play {{a crucial}} role in the regional specification and differentiation of the cranial neural crest. On the basis of global gene expression profiles, gene cohort expression levels, and epigenetic modifications, we have defined key factors involved in the differentiation of dental follicle (DF) intermediate progenitors into periodontal lineages, including alveolar bone (AB) osteoblasts, <b>cementoblasts,</b> and periodontal ligament (PDL) cells. When comparing differentially expressed genes, PDL cells most closely resembled DF progenitors, followed by AB osteoblasts and <b>cementoblasts</b> as the most distant population. According to gene ontology analyses, extracellular matrix-adhesion proteins were substantially increased in PDL cells, osteogenesis factors were elevated in AB osteoblasts, and gene expression levels were lower in <b>cementoblasts,</b> especially in the cytokine group. Unique signature proteins included interleukin 6, paired-like homeodomain transcription factor 2, thrombospondin 2, and glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor for DF progenitors; asporin and prostaglandin-H 2 D-isomerase for AB osteoblasts; and keratin 18, Netrin 4, Jagged 1, and Dickkopf 1 for <b>cementoblasts,</b> as verified by western blot analysis. Secreted frizzled-related protein 1 was preferentially expressed in PDL cells, whereas matrix Gla-protein, bone sialoprotein, and insulin-like growth factor binding protein 5 were higher in AB osteoblasts than in <b>cementoblasts.</b> On an epigenetic level, DF progenitors featured high levels of the euchromatin marker H 3 K 4 me 3, whereas PDL cells, AB osteoblasts, and <b>cementoblasts</b> contained high levels of the transcriptional repressor H 3 K 9 me 3.

40|$|The distributing of vimentin and cytokeratin {{intermediate}} filaments {{within the}} cells of the dental follicle and developing periodontal ligament is described during eruption of the rat 1 st molar tooth. Alcohol-fixed tissues from animals ranging from neonates to 12 wk old were cryosectioned, immunolabelled with monoclonal antibodies against vimentin and a range of cytokeratins and examined by indirect immunofluorescence. Vimentin was observed in follicular and periodontal ligament fibroblasts in all animals and at all stages of eruption. It was also observed in <b>cementoblasts</b> after disruption of the epithelial root sheath (of Hertwig) which is responsible for determining the shape of the developing root. Prior to eruption, cytokeratins were restricted to epithelial components of the developing tooth, including the root sheath.

40|$|BACKGROUND Although {{regenerative}} {{treatment options}} are available, periodontal regeneration is still regarded as insufficient and unpredictable. AIM This review article provides scientific background {{information on the}} animated 3 D film Cell-to-Cell Communication - Periodontal Regeneration. RESULTS Periodontal regeneration is understood as a recapitulation of embryonic mechanisms. Therefore, {{a thorough understanding of}} cellular and molecular mechanisms regulating normal tooth root development is imperative to improve existing and develop new periodontal regenerative therapies. However, compared to tooth crown and earlier stages of tooth development, much less is known about the development of the tooth root. The formation of root cementum is considered the critical element in periodontal regeneration. Therefore, much research in recent years has focused on the origin and differentiation of cementoblasts. Evidence is accumulating that the Hertwig's epithelial root sheath (HERS) has a pivotal role in root formation and cementogenesis. Traditionally, ectomesenchymal cells in the dental follicle were thought to differentiate into cementoblasts. According to an alternative theory, however, cementoblasts originate from the HERS. What happens when the periodontal attachment system is traumatically compromised? Minor mechanical insults to the periodontium may spontaneously heal, and the tissues can structurally and functionally be restored. But what happens to the periodontium in case of periodontitis, an infectious disease, after periodontal treatment? A non-regenerative treatment of periodontitis normally results in periodontal repair (i. e., the formation of a long junctional epithelium) rather than regeneration. Thus, a regenerative treatment is indicated to restore the original architecture and function of the periodontium. Guided tissue regeneration or enamel matrix proteins are such regenerative therapies, but further improvement is required. As remnants of HERS persist as epithelial cell rests of Malassez in the periodontal ligament, these epithelial cells are regarded as a stem cell niche that can give rise to new cementoblasts. Enamel matrix proteins and members of the transforming growth factor beta (TGF-ß) superfamily have been implicated in <b>cementoblast</b> differentiation. CONCLUSION A better knowledge of cell-to-cell communication leading to <b>cementoblast</b> differentiation may be used to develop improved regenerative therapies to reconstitute periodontal tissues that were lost due to periodontitis...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{investigate}} the periodontitis-associated changes in the number, proliferation and differentiation potential of human periodontal ligament stem cells (PDLSCs). Cultures of human periodontal ligament cells (PDLCs) were established from healthy donors and donors with periodontitis. The numbers of stem cell were character-ized using flow cytometry. PDLSCs were isolated from the PDLCs by immunomagnetic bead selection. Colony-forming abilities, osteogenic and adipogenic potential, gene expres-sion of <b>cementoblast</b> phenotype, alkaline phosphatase activity and in vivo differentiation capacities were then evaluated. Periodontitis caused an increase in the proliferation of PDLSCs and a decrease in the commitment to the osteoblast lineage. This is reflected by changes in the expression of osteoblast markers. When transplanted into immunocompromised mice, PDLSCs from the healthy donors exhibited the capacity to produce cementum PDL‑like structures, whereas, the inflam-matory PDLSCs transplants predominantly formed connective tissues. In conclusion, the data from the present study suggest that periodontitis affects the proliferation and differentiation potential of human PDLSCs in vitro and in vivo...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Cementum {{continues}} to be the least-known mineralized tissue. Although recent advances in the field of molecular biology have contributed {{to an understanding of the}} involvement of molecular factors in cementum formation during development and regeneration, cementogenesis on a cell biological basis is still poorly understood. Virtually nothing is known about <b>cementoblast</b> origin, differentiation, and the cell dynamics during normal development, repair, and regeneration. This review describes the recent findings of cementogenesis on roots of human premolars and opposes them to those of teeth from other mammals, particularly the rodent molar. METHODS: Using light and electron microscopy, light microscopic radioautography, and various measurements, a comprehensive insight into the development and repair of cementum during and after root formation and tooth eruption has been achieved for human premolars. RESULTS: Cementum is a highly responsive mineralized tissue. This biological activity is necessary for root integrity and for bringing and maintaining the tooth in its proper position. With regard to cementum formation and periodontal fiber attachment, considerable species-particularities exist that are mainly based on differences in growth rates and tooth sizes. Since root development and initial cementogenesis last on the average 5 - 7 years in human premolars, cementum formation in these teeth is characterized by along-lasting phase of prefunctional development, with occurs independent of principal periodontal fiber attachment to the root and which may take 5 years or more. The first molar of the rat, however, is in functional occlusion 3 1 / 2 weeks after the onset of root formation. Since initial cementum formation and periodontal fiber attachment to the root occur almost at the same time in this tooth, the distinction between cells associated with one or the other process is very difficult to achieve, and cementogenesis cannot be described independent of periodontal fiber attachment to the root. Therefore, the determination of <b>cementoblast</b> origin in the rodent molar may be intricate. CONCLUSIONS: Taking into account these species differences, the current description on the origin and differentiation of cementoblasts is inconsistent and the description of cementogenesis is still incomplete.

40|$|A common {{question}} about root resorption is raised in orthodontic practice: What is more important, {{the intensity of}} force or its distribution along the root, periodontal and alveolar structures? Diffuse distribution of forces applied to periodontal tissues during tooth movement tends not to promote neither extensive areas of cell matrix hyalinization nor significant death of <b>cementoblasts</b> that lead to root resorption. However, focal distribution or concentration of forces within a restricted area - as it occurs in tipping movements, even with forces of lower intensity - tend to induce extensive areas of hyalinization and focal death of <b>cementoblasts,</b> which is commonly associated with root resorption. In tipping movements, the apical regions tend to concentrate more forces in addition to wounding the <b>cementoblasts</b> due to the smaller dimension of their root structure {{as well as their}} cone shape. For this reason, there is an increase in root resorption. In the cervical region, on the other hand, the large area resulting from a large diameter and bone crown deflection tends to reduce the effects of forces, even when they are more concentrated, thus rarely inducing death of <b>cementoblasts</b> and root resorption...|$|R
40|$|Background: Cementum is a {{critical}} mineralized tissue; however, control of its formation remains undefined. One hypothesis is that enamel matrix proteins/peptides secreted by ameloblasts and/or epithelial rest cells contribute to the control of cementum formation via epithelial-mesenchymal interactions. Here, we focused on determining whether or not leucine-rich amelogenin peptide (LRAP), translated from an alternatively spliced amelogenin RNA, altered <b>cementoblast</b> behavior. Methods: Immortalized murine cementoblasts (OCCM- 30) were exposed to LRAP and evaluated for: 1) proliferative activity; 2) gene expression using Northern blot for Cbfa 1 (core binding factor alpha- 1); OCN (osteocalcin), OPN (osteopontin), and real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for OPG (osteoprotegerin); and RANKL (receptor activator of NF-kappaB ligand); 3) signaling pathway using inhibitors of PKA (THFA), PKC (GF 109203 X), and MAPK (UO 126); and 4) mineralization evaluated by von Kossa and Alizarin-red. Results: LRAP {{had no effect on}} cell proliferation up to 6 days, with a decrease in cell growth observed at the highest dose by 9 days versus untreated cells. LRAP down regulated OCN and up regulated OPN in a dose- and time-response fashion, and inhibited the capacity of mineral nodule formation. Transcripts for OPG were increased in LRAP-treated cells compared to control, but RANKL mRNA levels were not affected. Core binding factor alpha (Cbfa) mRNA, expressed constitutively, was not affected by LRAP. Signaling pathway assays suggested involvement of the MAPK pathway, since the addition of the MAPK inhibitor suppressed OPN expression in LRAP-treated cells. Conclusion: Leucine-rich amelogenin peptide appears to have a direct effect on <b>cementoblast</b> activity that may prove significant during development as well as in regeneration of periodontal tissues.

Real-time PCR and western blot were used to detect <b>cementoblast</b> differentiation and the underlying mechanisms through the expression of the osteogenic genes and the downstream effectors of the TGF-β/Smad signaling. The results showed that 5 µg/mL MWCNT-COOH had the most obvious effects on promoting differentiation without significant toxicity. Alp, Ocn, Bsp, Opn, Col 1 and Runx 2 gene expression was up-regulated. Smad 2 and Smad 3 mRNA was up-regulated, while Smad 7 was first down-regulated on Day 3 and later up-regulated on Day 7. The elevated level...|$|E
40|$|Background: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the effects of low-intensity pulsed ultrasound (LIPUS) stimulation on the proliferation and differentiation of <b>cementoblast</b> lineage cells. Methods: An immortalized human periodontal ligament cell line (HPL) showing immature cementoblastic differentiation was used. Cultured HPL cells were subjected to LIPUS exposure (frequency = 1 MHz; pulsed 1 : 4; intensity = 30 mW/cm 2) or sham exposure for 15 minutes per day. Expression levels of alkaline phosphatase (ALP), type I collagen (Col-I), runt-related gene 2 (Runx 2), bone sialoprotein (BSP), osteocalcin (OCN), and osteopontin (OPN) mRNA were analyzed with real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis. Furthermore, ALP activity, collagen synthesis, and protein level of Runx 2 were examined after 6 days of LIPUS exposure. Results: mRNA and protein levels of ALP, Col-I, and Runx 2 were significantly increased by LIPUS exposure compared to controls, whereas BSP, OCN, and OPN mRNA expression could not be detected in HPL cells, irrespective of LIPUS exposure. Conclusion: LIPUS enhanced ALP activity, collagen synthesis, and Runx 2 expression of HPL cells, which provides important insight into the promotion of early cementoblastic differentiation of immature cementoblasts...|$|E

40|$|Cementum Is An Important Mineralized Tissue Attached To Root Dentin Surface, Which Is Secreted By Highly Differentiated Cells Named <b>Cementoblasts.</b> It Is Commonly Suggested That Dfcs (Dental Follicle Cells) Are Precursor Cells Responsible For Various Kinds Of Periodontal Cells Including <b>Cementoblasts,</b> Fibroblasts And Osteoblasts. However, The Mechanisms Regulating Dfcs Differentiation Are Still Unclear. At The Onset Of Cementogenesis, Dfcs Have Access To Contacting With Root Dentin Surface After Penetrating Disintegrated Hers (Hertwig's Epithelial Root Sheath). Since Matrix Elasticity Can Direct Stem Cell Lineage Specification, We Hypothesize That Dentin Elasticity May Be An Effective Factor For Dfcs Differentiation Into <b>Cementoblasts.</b> This Hypothesis Supplements Another Possible Mechanism For Periodontal Development, And Further, We Can Utilize Dentin Or Other Materials With Similar Mechanical Properties To Fabricate Bioengineered Tooth Roots For Patients Suffering From Tooth Loss. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|Root {{resorption}} is {{an adverse}} consequence of orthodontic treatment, and currently no effective treatment method exists. Extracorporeal shock wave (ESW) {{has been applied}} to enhance angiogenesis, growth and healing of bone, but the effects of ESW on root resorption have not been studied. <b>Cementoblasts</b> are the cells responsible for forming and repairing cementum covering the dental root, and ESW may enhance this reparative process. The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate the effects of ESW on <b>cementoblasts</b> to determine if ESW could potentially be used to treat root resorption. OCCM. 30 <b>cementoblasts</b> were prepared in suspension at a density of 10 7 /ml and placed in Eppendorf tubes which were held in a specially designed apparatus to focus the shock waves at the cells. Using the focused shock wave stimulator (Storz Medical AG, Switzerland), the cell...|$|R
