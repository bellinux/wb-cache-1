The physical explanations which I have seen are easy, but miserably insufficient: the spiritualist hypothesis is sufficient, but ponderously difficult. Time and thought will decide, the second asking the first for more results of trial.|$|E
2500|$|The {{report of}} the {{convention}} in the New York Tribune for Europe inspired women in Sheffield, England, {{to draw up a}} petition for woman suffrage and present it to the House of Lords and Harriet Taylor to write The Enfranchisement of Women. Harriet Martineau wrote a letter to Davis in August 1851 to thank her for sending a copy of the proceedings: [...] "I hope you are aware of the interest excited in this country by that Convention, the strongest proof of which is the appearance of an article on the subject in the Westminster Review ...I am not without hope that this article will materially strengthen your hands, and I am sure it <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>but</b> cheer your hearts." ...|$|E

60|$|Since {{your last}} {{adjournment}} Lieutenant-General Scott has {{retired from the}} head of the Army.

I submit, therefore, for your consideration what further mark of recognition is due to him, and to ourselves as a grateful people.|$|E

60|$|The only thinker who, with a {{competent}} knowledge of scientific methods in general, {{has attempted to}} characterize the Method of Sociology, M. Comte, considers this inverse order as inseparably inherent {{in the nature of}} sociological speculation. He looks upon the social science as essentially consisting of generalizations from history, verified, not originally suggested, by deduction from the laws of human nature. Though there is a truth contained in this opinion, of which I shall presently endeavor to show the importance, I <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>but</b> think that this truth is enunciated in too unlimited a manner, and that there is considerable scope in sociological inquiry for the direct, {{as well as for the}} inverse, Deductive Method.|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Stockton {{considered}} {{his career as}} an editor of great advantage to him as an author. In an autobiographical paper he writes: [...] "Long-continued reading of manuscripts submitted for publication which are almost good enough to use, and yet not quite up to the standard of the magazine, <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>but</b> be of great service to any one who proposes a literary career. Bad work shows us {{what we ought to}} avoid, but most of us know, or think we know, what that is. Fine literary work we get outside the editorial room. But the great mass of literary material which is almost good enough to print is seen only by the editorial reader, and its lesson is lost upon him in a great degree unless he is, or intends to be, a literary worker." ...|$|E

[...] "I did not mean by that to turn you out, but perhaps it may be as well. I have no more to say; and as for you, you <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>but</b> wish that the penance should be over." [...] Then he pressed her hand, and with some muttered farewell, bade her adieu.

In this case, however, as in all others, the test [...] of what a name denotes is what it can be predicated of: and we can [...] certainly predicate of a sound, or a smell, that it is not white. [...] The affirmation and the negation of the same attribute <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>but</b> [...] divide the whole field of predication between them.|$|E

"My {{plan for}} {{gaining access to}} the Grecian territories is not, as before, to convey the troops by a fleet of galleys over the Ægean Sea, but to build a bridge across the Hellespont, and march the army to Greece by land. This course, which I am well {{convinced}} is practicable, will be more safe than the other, and the bridging of the Hellespont will be of itself a glorious deed. The Greeks will be utterly unable to resist the enormous force which we shall be able to pour upon them. We <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>but</b> conquer; and inasmuch as beyond the Greek territories there is, as I am informed, no other power at all {{able to cope with}} us, we shall easily extend our empire on every side to the sea, and thus the Persian dominion will cover the whole habitable world.|$|E
60|$|We <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>but</b> {{hope that}} Alfred was led, in some degree, by a generous {{principle}} of Christian forgiveness in proposing the terms {{which he did}} to his fallen enemy, and also that Guthrum, in accepting them, was influenced, in part at least, by emotions of gratitude and by admiration of the high example of Christian virtue which Alfred thus exhibited. At any rate, he did accept them. The army of the Danes were liberated from their confinement, and commenced their march to the eastward; Guthrum himself, attended by thirty of his chiefs and many other followers, became Alfred's guest for some weeks, until the most pressing measures for the organization of Alfred's government could be attended to, and the necessary preparations for the baptism could be made. At length, some weeks after the surrender, the parties all repaired together, now firm friends and allies, to a place near Ethelney, where the ceremony of baptism was to be performed.|$|E
