Bentonite surfaces were activated for removal of bromoxynil residues from water by simple ion exchange reaction using Hexadecyl tributyl phosphonium (HDTBP+) or N-cetylperidinium (NCP) salts. HPLC results showed that raw bentonite is a poor material for removing bromoxynil residues, whereas NCP+-/HDTBP +-bentonite are powerful materials for removing bromoxynil residues due to changing bentonite surfaces from hydrophilic to hydrophobic. Reducing the temperature or the pH of the solution further enhanced the removal process.

30|$|The use of {{biomarkers}} {{with the}} purpose of biomonitoring natural aquatic systems by the use of bioindicator species is necessary to efficiently measure the degree of exposure in aquatic organisms to chemical contaminants (Sureda et al. 2011).

In this context, biomarkers are increasingly worldwide-recognized tools for the assessment of pollution impacts, and some are already incorporated in environmental monitoring programs in other countries (Viarengo et al. 2007), although their systematic and large scale application is rare (Trapp et al. 2014). In this context, considering the increased <b>contamination</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> <b>resources</b> and the potential risk to biodiversity conservation and human health, as well as the importance of the use of biomarkers to complement the water physicochemical analysis, this study aims to review the use of biomarkers in the assessment of aquatic ecosystems health in the last 16  years in Brazil.|$|E

Short-chain PFASs enrich in edible parts of plants and the accumulation in food chains is unknown. Regarding these concerns and uncertainties, especially with respect to the precautionary principle, short-chain PFASs are of equivalent concern to PBT substances. Therefore, they should be identified as substances of very high concern (SVHC) under REACH. The SVHC identification should be followed by a restriction under REACH, which is the most efficient way to minimize the environmental and human exposure of short-chain PFASs in the European Union.|$|R

Using the result of a water quality survey at the entrance and the outlet of a small pond receiving agricultural drainage water, the Seneque/Riverstrahler biogeochemical model was shown to accurately simulate the observed 30 % reduction in nitrogen fluxes crossing this pond. The model was then used to simulate the effect of various scenarios of pond restoration (inspired by their 18 th century geographical distribution as revealed by the Cassini map) on surface water nitrate contamination at different spatial scales. In regions with an impermeable lithological substrate, the restoration of ponds at a density of 5 % of the agricultural area would reduce the riverine nitrogen export by up to 25 % on an annual basis.
