Wavelength conversion can also improve the blocking performance of an optical network by allowing a connection to use different wavelengths along its route.

This activity is inherently distributed as the resources involved are spread in the network. But, was not the transaction concept conceived by the database community really to mean coordination? So why not to exploit the results and experience achieved in the database domain and apply those ideas in connection management? Transactions in the database world are a means of allowing each concurrent client with the illusion that it has the sole access to any data it reads or writes and to guarantee that, in case of failure, the data will be restored to a consistent state. In connection management there is a shift of concern on where coordination is to be applied: from data to processing.

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} traffic control scheme for {{integrated}} services ATM networks. The control strategy comprises of two components: a shaping mechanism {{at the network}} entry point and a frame based service discipline at the switches. The shaper enforces short term peak rate and a mean rate over a longer interval. A dual rate shaper handles bursty traffic better than a shaper that enforces a single rate constraint. The multiplexing scheme guarantees a minimum bandwidth to all connections, negotiated {{at the time of}} <b>connection</b> <b>set</b> <b>up.</b> A connection may use more than the allocated minimum, up to a connection specific maximum, if slack bandwidth is available. By imposing an upper bound on the allocated bandwidth we secure a better handle on the delay jitter.

This added flexibility is particularly useful in supporting diverse throughput requirements of a wide mix of applications. We derive [...] ...|$|E

Wavelength conversion has been proposed for use in such networks to improve the efficiency. The crucial factors which determine the efficiency of using wavelength conversion as opposed to not using them, {{is the number of}} wavelengths required to satisfy the network traffic demand and the blocking of traffic demands by the network. In addition to considering wavelength conversion, this study investigates the effect of having multiple paths between each source-destination pair. We consider the cases where protection is necessary for each of the primary paths between every source-destination pair and hence a backup path also has to be established during <b>connection</b> <b>set</b> <b>up,</b> and the case when no protection is necessary. We study the effect of wavelength conversion with different protection schemes. By simulating and analyzing a large number of randomly generated networks we report results of our study of the above schemes under both incremental and dynamic traffic conditions.

40|$|In {{networks}} supporting distributed multimedia, maximizing bandwidth utilization {{and providing}} performance guarantees are two incompatible goals.

These include admission control at <b>connection</b> <b>set</b> <b>up,</b> traffic control at the source ends and efficient scheduling schemes at the switches. The emphasis in this paper is on traffic control at the source ends. Traffic control schemes have two functional roles. One is traffic enforcement {{as a supplement to}} the admission control policy. The other is shaping the input traffic so that it becomes amenable to the scheduling mechanism at the switches for providing the required QoS guarantees. Studies on bursty sources have shown that burstiness promotes statistical multiplexing at the cost of possible congestion. Smoothing the traffic helps in providing guarantees at the cost o f bandwidth utilization. The need for a flexible scheme which can provide a reasonable compromise between the utilization and guarantees is imminent. We present the design and performance study of a flexible traffic shaper which can adjust the burstiness of input traffic to obtain reasonable utilization while maintaining statistical service guarantees. The performance of the traffic shaper for bursty sources is studied using simulation. (Also cross-referenced as UMIACS-TR- 95 - 72...|$|E

40|$|All-optical {{networks}} employing Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM) technique will be {{the backbone}} of next generation Internet. In WDM optical networks, each fiber link is logically divided into multiple non-interfering, circuit-switched communication channels known as avelength channels and are identified by {{the length of the}} wave. Routing and Wavelength Assignment (RWA) problem is a classical problem in WDM networks. It is further divided into two subproblems: (i) Routing, and (ii) Wavelength Assignment. Routing subproblem finds a route fromsource to destination. Wavelength Assignment subproblem assigns a wavelength to the route established byrouting subproblem. The RWA problem is combinatorial by its nature and belongs to a class of dicult combinatorial optimization problems. The optimal solution to the RWA problem is found to be NP-complete and thus suited to heuristic approaches. RWAproblem is reported in the current literature as an integer linear programming problem (ILP) that typically optimizes a single objective, either minimizes the number amplifiers, the network load or maximizes the number of connections while satisfying power constraints. In this work, we formulated the RWA problem as a multi objective ILP problem. Our primary concern is to establish a loop free lightpath that is immune to signal distortion and crosstalk. An attempt is made to obtain a feasible solution using genetic algorithm (GA). The parameters considered for optimization are congestion among the individual lightpath requests, <b>connection</b> <b>set</b> <b>up</b> time, the number of intermediate hops traversed and the number of fibers used to honor the established connection requests.

Smoothing, on the other hand, helps in providing guarantees at the cost of utilization. Thus need for a flexible scheme which can provide a reasonable compromise between utilization and performance is imminent. Recent studies [10, 12] have also questioned the suitability of LB for policing real-time traffic due to the excessive delays. We argue for a policy which is less stringenton short term burstiness than the LB. We propose a new traffic shaper which can adjust the burstiness of the input traffic to obtain reasonable bandwidth utilization while maintaining statistical service guarantees. The performance study is conducted in two parts. In the first part, we study the effect of varying the shaper parameters on the input characteristics. In the second part, we dimension our scheme and a LB equivalently and compare the mean and peak rate policing behavior with delay and loss as the performance parameters. Adopting a less stringent attitude towards short term burstiness is shown to result in considerable advantage while policing real-time traffic.
