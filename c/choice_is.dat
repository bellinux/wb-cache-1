5|$|After a subarachnoid {{hemorrhage}} is confirmed, its origin {{needs to be}} determined. If the bleeding {{is likely to have}} originated from an aneurysm (as determined by the CT scan appearance), the <b>choice</b> <b>is</b> between cerebral angiography (injecting radiocontrast through a catheter to the brain arteries) and CT angiography (visualizing blood vessels with radiocontrast on a CT scan) to identify aneurysms. Catheter angiography also offers the possibility of coiling an aneurysm (see below).|$|E
5|$|If oral {{medications}} and mechanical treatments fail, the second <b>choice</b> <b>is</b> local injections: medications such as papaverine and prostaglandin that alter the blood flow and trigger erection are {{injected into the}} penis. This method is preferred for its effectiveness, but can cause pain and scarring.|$|E
5|$|Pinestar's <b>Choice</b> <b>is</b> the {{eleventh}} novella. It {{was released on}} April 11, 2017. The story takes place shortly after Mapleshade's Vengeance. The main plot is about Pinestar becoming leader and later leaving ThunderClan behind to become a kittypet.|$|E

5|$|Sexual {{selection}} as first articulated by Darwin (using {{the example of}} the peacock's tail) refers specifically to competition for mates, which can be intrasexual, between individuals of the same sex, that is male–male competition, or intersexual, where one gender chooses mates, most often with males displaying and females choosing. However, in some species, mate <b>choice</b> <b>is</b> primarily by males, as in some fishes of the family Syngnathidae.|$|E
5|$|Since 1980, each voter names three rookies: a first-place <b>choice</b> <b>is</b> given five points, a second-place choice three points, and a third-place choice one point. The award goes to {{the player}} who {{receives}} the most overall points. Edinson Vólquez received three second-place votes in 2008 balloting despite no longer being a rookie under the award's definition.|$|E
5|$|Some theory {{requires}} {{selecting a}} fixed {{point on the}} sphere, calling the pair (sphere, point) a pointed sphere. For some spaces the choice matters, but for a sphere all points are equivalent so the <b>choice</b> <b>is</b> a matter of convenience. The point (1, 0, 0, …, 0), {{which is on the}} equator of all the spheres, works well for geometric spheres; the (collapsed) rim of the disk is another obvious choice.|$|E

50|$|Several {{sites were}} {{considered}} for the new college. The first <b>choice</b> <b>was</b> a site in New Lebanon, N.Y., occupied by the Darrow School, which refused to sell. The final <b>choice</b> <b>was</b> the estate of Dan Hanna (son of Mark Hanna) in Stockbridge, Massachusetts.|$|R
50|$|Health <b>Choices</b> <b>was</b> {{established}} in 2009 at part of St John of God Health Care’s five-year expansion plan.

5|$|The {{four main}} {{characters}} of Children of Mana are Ferrik, Tamber, Poppen, and Wanderer. They all {{live together in}} the Mana Village, near the Mana Tree. Ferrik is a fifteen-year-old boy {{who is said to}} be brave, bright and cheerful. He lost his parents and sister in the great disaster. After his life was saved by a knight, he has been honing his skills with the sword. Tamber is a sixteen-year-old girl, with a sense of truth and justice, and an air of maturity about her. She lost her parents and little brother due to the great disaster. Tamber's weapon of <b>choice</b> <b>is</b> the bow. Poppen is a nine-year-old boy, who is stubborn and fearless. He lost his mother at birth and his father in the great disaster. Poppen's weapon of <b>choice</b> <b>is</b> the flail. Wanderer is a traveling merchant, a tradition kept throughout the series. He {{is a member of the}} Niccolo tribe of rabbit/cat people who lost his family due to the king of Lorimar during the great disaster. Wanderer's weapon of <b>choice</b> <b>is</b> the hammer.|$|E
5|$|The {{modality}} of <b>choice</b> <b>is</b> {{computed tomography}} (CT scan) without contrast, of the brain. This {{has a high}} sensitivity and will correctly identify over 95 percent of cases—especially {{on the first day}} after the onset of bleeding. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may be more sensitive than CT after several days. Within six hours of the onset of symptoms CT picks up 98.7% of cases.|$|E
5|$|There are six main plot {{lines that}} the player {{will have the}} chance to experience, five which are {{initially}} available. Throughout gameplay, the player is given multiple options to choose from, and text progression pauses at these points until a <b>choice</b> <b>is</b> made. To view all plot lines in their entirety, the player must replay the game multiple times and make different choices to change the plot progression.|$|E
5000|$|So {{moving to}} [...] {{would be a}} bad idea, so the {{previous}} <b>choice</b> <b>was</b> good. So we try other nonmedoids and found that our first <b>choice</b> <b>was</b> the best.

5|$|Two hot {{beverages}} that Palestinians consume is coffee—served in {{the morning}} and throughout the day—and tea which is often sipped in the evening. Tea is usually flavored with na'ana (mint) or maramiyyeh (sage). The coffee of <b>choice</b> <b>is</b> usually Turkish or Arabic coffee. Arabic coffee is similar to Turkish coffee, but the former is spiced with cardamom and is usually unsweetened.|$|E
5|$|A final {{showdown}} ensues with Lazarus, {{in which}} Jericho arises victorious, and a <b>choice</b> <b>is</b> given {{for him to}} side with either Cassidy or Tala. Either Jericho rids the West of the Curse of Lazarus, or he becomes the Curse; the player's choice determines how the game ends. If the character were to choose the good option, then the final fight will be against the vampiric Tala; if the player chooses to take Lazarus' curse for himself, then he must fight the ghost of Cassidy. The bad ending shows the now-monstrous Jericho killing Tala and riding into the night, while the good ending shows Cassidy's soul being released.|$|E
5|$|<b>Choice</b> <b>is</b> a {{significant}} {{aspect of the}} game, requiring a non-linear design to accommodate the customized characters. Level design began {{with a list of}} factors such as Disciplines, stealth and feats. Each area had to be viable for a shooting character (sufficient ammunition), a discipline-focused character (sufficient blood sources to keep the powers fueled) and a melee specialist (to reach enemies without being killed), with stealth options and option combinations. Level design began with a focus on stealth, taking into consideration the positioning of guards and the character's potential stealth capability at that point in the game. Then direct, combat-heavy and dialog paths were added. The amusement arcade area was to feature playable versions of Activision arcade games such as Pitfall!, though the idea was abandoned due to time constraints.|$|E

5|$|Five {{important}} Upanishad texts, {{according to}} Olivelle – the Jabala plus the Aruni, Laghu-Samnyasa, Kathashruti and Paramahamsa Upanishads – provide different {{answers to the}} question of when someone may renounce the worldly life to lead a monastic one. The Laghu-Samnyasa Upanishad, Kathashruti Upanishad and Paramahamsa Upanishad suggest that a man may renounce after sequentially completing the student, householder and retirement stages of life, and then getting the consent of his elders and direct family members. In contrast, the Jabala Upanishad and Aruni Upanishad assert that the <b>choice</b> <b>is</b> entirely up to the individual, without needing to have completed any stage of life nor requiring the consent of anyone else.|$|E
5|$|In Amenhotep I's ninth regnal year, a heliacal rise of Sothis was {{observed}} {{on the ninth}} day of the third month of summer. Modern astronomers have calculated that, if the observation was made from Memphis or Heliopolis, such an observation {{could only have been}} made on that day in 1537 BC. If the observation was made in Thebes, however, it could only have taken place in 1517 BC. The latter <b>choice</b> <b>is</b> usually accepted as correct since Thebes was the capital during the early 18th dynasty; hence, Amenhotep I is usually given an accession date in 1526 BC, although the possibility of 1546 BC is not entirely dismissed.|$|E
5|$|In the Middle Ages {{there was}} {{considerable}} variation in the nomination of the archbishop and other bishops. At various times the choice {{was made by the}} canons of Canterbury Cathedral, the king of England, or the Pope. Since the Reformation, the church is explicitly a state church and the <b>choice</b> <b>is</b> legally that of the British crown; today it is made {{in the name of the}} monarch by the Prime Minister, from a shortlist of two selected by an ad hoc committee called the Crown Nominations Commission.|$|E

5|$|In {{the rules}} of baseball, aside from the rare case of {{interference}} or obstruction, a batter who puts a ball into play and safely reaches first base is ruled to have reached {{in one of three}} possible ways: a hit, an error, or by fielder's choice. Fielder's <b>choice</b> <b>is</b> primarily discussed in rules 10.05 and 10.06, and it generally occurs when it is judged that a batter-runner would have been put out had the defense chosen to do so.|$|E
5|$|Northern mockingbirds are {{socially}} monogamous. The two sexes look alike except that males {{are a little}} larger in size than females. Mutual mate <b>choice</b> <b>is</b> exhibited in northern mockingbirds. Both males and females prefer mates that are more aggressive towards intruders, and so exhibit greater parental investment. However, males are more defensive of their nests than females. In a population where male breeding adults outnumber female breeding adults, females have more freedom in choosing their mates. In these cases, these female breeders {{have the option of}} changing mates within a breeding season if the first male does not provide a high level of parental care, which includes feeding and nest defense. High nesting success is associated with highly aggressive males attacking intruders in the territory, and so these males are preferred by females.|$|E
5|$|The Upanishad {{asserts that}} anyone can renounce – this <b>choice</b> <b>is</b> entirely up to the individual, {{regardless}} of which Ashrama (stage of life) he is in. The Jabala Upanishad seems to justify suicide as an individual choice in certain circumstances, a view opposed by earlier Vedic texts and Principal Upanishads. Those too sick may renounce the worldly life in their mind. The Jabala Upanishad presents the Vedanta philosophy view that one who truly renounces lives an ethical life, which includes not injuring anyone in thought, word or deed. Such a sannyasi (renunciate) abandons all rituals, is without attachments to anything or anyone, and is one who {{is devoted to the}} oneness of Atman and Brahman.|$|E
