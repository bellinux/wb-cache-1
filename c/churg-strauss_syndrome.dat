50|$|Eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA; {{also known}} as <b>Churg-Strauss</b> <b>syndrome</b> CSS or {{allergic}} granulomatosis) is an extremely rare autoimmune condition that causes inflammation of small and medium-sized blood vessels (vasculitis) in persons {{with a history of}} airway allergic hypersensitivity (atopy).|$|E
50|$|Eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA; {{formerly}} known as <b>Churg-Strauss</b> <b>syndrome).</b> Affects medium and small vessels with vascular and extravascular granulomatosis.

50|$|Leukotriene {{receptor}} antagonist-associated <b>Churg-Strauss</b> <b>syndrome</b> {{may occur}} in asthma patients being treated with leukotriene receptor antagonists, occurring 2 days to 10 {{months after the}} antagonist has been started, with features of the syndrome including peripheral eosinphilia, pulmonary infiltrates, and less commonly neuropathy, sinusitis, and cardiomyopathy.|$|E
50|$|Antibodies against MPO {{have been}} implicated in various types of vasculitis, most {{prominently}} three clinically and pathologically recognized forms: granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA, formerly Wegener's granulomatosis), microscopic polyangiitis (MPA); and {{eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis}} (EGPA, formerly <b>Churg-Strauss</b> <b>syndrome).</b> Antibodies are also known as anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCAs), though ANCAs have also been detected in staining of the perinuclear region.|$|E
50|$|Certain {{inflammatory}} {{diseases are}} characterised {{by a combination}} of granulomatous inflammation and vasculitis (inflammation of the blood vessels). Both the granulomas as well as the vasculitis tend to occur in association with necrosis.

50|$|The memoir Patient, by {{musician}} Ben Watt, {{deals with}} {{his experience with}} <b>Churg-Strauss</b> <b>syndrome</b> in 1992, and his recovery. Watt's case was unusual in that it mainly affected his gastrointestinal tract, leaving his lungs largely unaffected; this unusual presentation contributed to a delay in proper diagnosis. His treatment required the removal of 5 m (15 ft) of necrotized small intestine (about 75%), leaving him on a permanently restricted diet.|$|E
50|$|A triad of atopic eczema, {{allergic}} rhinitis and asthma is called atopy.

50|$|Anterior ischemic optic {{neuropathy}} (AION) includes diseases {{that affect the}} optic nerve head and cause swelling of the optic disc. These diseases often cause sudden rapid visual loss in one eye. Inflammatory diseases of the blood vessels, like giant cell arteritis, polyarteritis nodosa, <b>Churg-Strauss</b> <b>syndrome,</b> granulomatosis with polyangiitis, and rheumatoid arthritis can cause arteritic AIONs (AAION). The vast majority of AIONs are nonarteritic AIONs (NAION). The most common acute {{optic neuropathy}} in patients over 50 years of age, NAION has an annual incidence of 2.3-10.2/100,000. NAION presents as a painless loss of vision, often when awakening, that occurs over hours to days. Most patients lose {{the lower half of}} their visual field (an inferior altitudinal loss), though superior altitudinal loss is also common. The pathophysiology of NAION is unknown, but it is related to poor circulation in the optic nerve head. NAION is often associated with diabetes mellitus, elevated intraocular pressure (acute glaucoma, eye surgery), high cholesterol, hypercoagulable states, a drop in blood pressure (bleeding, cardiac arrest, peri-operative esp. cardiac and spine procedures), and sleep apnea. Rarely, amiodarone, interferon-alpha, and erectile dysfunction drugs have been associated with this disease.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: <b>Churg-Strauss</b> <b>syndrome</b> is an eosinophil-associated, {{small vessel}} granulomatous vasculitis, {{characterized}} by late onset asthma, upper airways disease, eosinophilia, and clinical manifestations of systemic vasculitis. Several cases of <b>Churg-Strauss</b> <b>syndrome</b> {{have been recognized}} in patients treated with cysteinyl leukotriene-receptor antagonists and weaned off systemic corticosteroids. These cases {{have led to a}} general warning on the possible development of <b>Churg-Strauss</b> <b>syndrome</b> after taking cysteinyl leukotriene-receptor antagonists. The authors report five cases of <b>Churg-Strauss</b> <b>syndrome</b> in severe steroid dependent asthmatics in whom inhaled corticosteroids allowed systemic corticosteroid withdrawal. It is concluded that physicians should monitor patients carefully when severe asthma is controlled with any substance allowing withdrawal from (or even avoidance) of systemic corticosteroids. Case-control studies should identify more precisely the risk factors of <b>Churg-Strauss</b> <b>syndrome...</b>|$|E

KEY WORDS: Thrombosis, Vasculitis, Eosinophil, <b>Churg-Strauss</b> <b>syndrome.</b> INFLAMMATION and necrosis of the vessel wall with eosinophilia and extravascular granulomas are cardinal features of <b>Churg-Strauss</b> <b>syndrome</b> (CSS) [1]. Thromboembolism is rarely reported in this setting [2], although immune complex deposition, anti-endothelial cell antibodies (AECA) and inflammatory mediators may promote the thrombogenicity of the endothelial lining, stimulate platelet activation and increase the synthesis of haemostatically active plasma proteins, favouring a hypercoagulable state [2]. We report three patients with CSS who experienced thrombosis. This occurred during a relapse of CSS in the first case and represented a later manifestation in the remaining two patients. A likely pathogenesis for thrombosis develop-ment in CSS is given...|$|E
