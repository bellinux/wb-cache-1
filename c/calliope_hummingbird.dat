5|$|Over 300 {{species of}} birds have been sighted in the park {{including}} the <b>calliope</b> <b>hummingbird,</b> the smallest bird species in North America, as well as trumpeter swans, which is North America's largest waterfowl. In addition to trumpeter swans, another 30 species of waterfowl have been recorded including blue-winged teal, common merganser, American wigeon and the colorful but reclusive harlequin duck which is occasionally spotted in Cascade Canyon. Both bald and golden eagles and other birds of prey such as the osprey, red-tailed hawk, American kestrel and occasional sightings of peregrine falcon have been reported. Of the 14 species of owls reported, the most common is the great horned owl, though the boreal owl and great grey owl are also seen occasionally. A dozen species of woodpeckers have been reported, as have a similar number of species of warblers, plovers and gulls. The vocal and gregarious black-billed magpie frequents campgrounds while Steller's jay and Clark's nutcracker {{are found in the}} backcountry. The sage covered plains of Jackson Hole are favored areas for sage grouse, Brewer's sparrow and sage thrashers, while the wetlands are frequented by great blue heron, American white pelican, sandhill crane and on rare occasions it's endangered relative, the whooping crane.|$|E

50|$|<b>Calliope</b> <b>hummingbirds</b> are a migratory bird, {{generally}} {{leaving their}} breeding grounds earlier than most birds (although not {{as early as}} the rufous hummingbird) {{to take advantage of the}} late-summer wildflowers in the mountains of western North America. They are believed to be the smallest-bodied long distance migrant in the world.|$|R
2500|$|The {{meadows and}} forest {{around the lake}} are home to American goldfinch, Cassin's finch, pine siskin, red crossbill, Brewers sparrow, house sparrow, song sparrow, yellow-rumped warbler, olive-sided flycatcher, Cordilleran flycatcher, Hammond's flycatcher, dusky flycatcher, {{mountain}} chickadee, black-capped chickadee, evening grosbeak, dark-eyed junco, western tanager, American robin, western bluebird, mountain bluebird, hermit thrush, Townsend's solitaire, sage thrasher, golden-crowned kinglet, ruby-crowned kinglet, warbling vireo, house wren, cedar waxwing, barn swallow, cliff swallow, and tree swallow.

40|$|The {{sixth in}} the {{backyard}} wildlife series, this NebGuide describes plants and nectar feeding for attracting hummingbirds to your backyard in Nebraska. Four species of hummingbirds are found in Nebraska, one {{in the east and}} three in the west. Ruby-throated hummingbirds migrate through eastern Nebraska in spring and fall, and some nest here, mostly along the Missouri river valley. Typically, ruby-throat migration in Nebraska peaks about May 5 - 17 and September 2 - 18, but northward migration may occur from April to June and southward flights from August to early October. Broad-tailed and rufous hummingbirds are seen in the Nebraska panhandle during fall migration from late July to early September with most sightings in early to mid-August. <b>Calliope</b> <b>hummingbirds</b> are seen rarely in the panhandle area. These four hummingbird species spend winter in Mexico and Central America...|$|R
50|$|Many {{species of}} pollinators, {{including}} the <b>calliope</b> <b>hummingbird,</b> have shown decreases in certain populations. Little {{information is available}} on the overall issues that are causing these declines but possible threats include habitat loss, increased use of pesticides, and replacement of native plants by non-native plants (although, on the other hand, many hummingbirds benefit from non-native plants in gardens that provide additional food). The restricted wintering range of calliope hummingbirds makes the species more susceptible to natural disasters, diseases, or land use changes that could wipe out significant portions of the population. The <b>calliope</b> <b>hummingbird</b> has not been well studied, leaving much of its life history unknown.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>calliope</b> <b>hummingbird</b> (Selasphorus calliope) is a {{very small}} hummingbird native to the United States and Canada and, during winter, Central America. It was {{previously}} considered {{the only member of the}} genus Stellula, but recent evidence suggests placement in the genus Selasphorus. This bird was named after the Greek muse Calliope. The former genus name means [...] "little star".|$|E
50|$|Many {{other species}} of {{hummingbirds}} also produce sounds with their wings or tails while flying, hovering or diving, including {{the wings of the}} <b>calliope</b> <b>hummingbird,</b> broad-tailed hummingbird, rufous hummingbird, Allen's hummingbird, and streamertail, as well as the tail of the Costa's hummingbird and the black-chinned hummingbird, and a number of related species. However, the harmonics of sounds during courtship dives vary across species of hummingbirds.|$|E
40|$|At high {{temperature}} (greater than 40 °C) endotherms experience reduced passive heat dissipation (radiation, conduction and convection) and increased reliance on evaporative heat loss. High temperatures challenge flying birds due to heat produced by wing muscles. Hummingbirds depend on flight for foraging, yet inhabit hot regions. We used infrared thermography {{to explore how}} lower passive heat dissipation during flight impacts body-heat management in broad-billed (Cynanthus latirostris, 3. 0 g), black-chinned (Archilochus alexandri, 3. 0 g), Rivoli’s (Eugenes fulgens, 7. 5 g) and blue-throated (Lampornis clemenciae, 8. 0 g) hummingbirds in southeastern Arizona and <b>calliope</b> <b>hummingbirds</b> (Selasphorus <b>calliope,</b> 2. 6 g) in Montana. Thermal gradients driving passive heat dissipation through eye, shoulder and feet dissipation areas are eliminated between 36 and 40 °C. Thermal gradients persisted at higher temperatures in smaller species, possibly allowing them to inhabit warmer sites. All species experienced extended daytime periods lacking thermal gradients. Broadbilled hummingbirds lacking thermal gradients regulated the mean total-body surface temperature at approximately 38 °C, suggesting behavioural thermoregulation. Blue-throated hummingbirds were inactive when lacking passive heat dissipation and hence might have the lowest temperature tolerance of the four species. Use of thermal refugia permitte...|$|R
50|$|Bird life varies {{depending}} on the season, but many species are seen year-round, including turkey vultures, California scrub and Steller's jays, California quail, acorn and hairy woodpeckers, northern flickers, hermit thrushes, wild turkeys (non-native), and California thrashers. In summer the bright colors of the western tanager, northern oriole, <b>calliope</b> and Anna's <b>hummingbirds</b> {{can be seen in}} the woods around the meadow.|$|R
40|$|Flying animals {{generate}} {{large amounts}} of heat, which must be dissipated to avoid overheating. In birds, heat dissipation is complicated by feathers, which cover most body surfaces and retard heat loss. To understand how birds manage heat budgets during flight, {{it is critical to}} know how heat moves from the skin to the external environment. Hummingbirds are instructive because they fly at speeds from 0 to more than 12 ms− 1, during which they transit from radiative to convective heat loss. We used infrared thermography and particle image velocimetry to test the effects of flight speed on heat loss from specific body regions in flying <b>calliope</b> <b>hummingbirds</b> (Selasphorus <b>calliope).</b> We measured heat flux in a carcass with and without plumage to test the effectiveness of the insulation layer. In flying hummingbirds, the highest thermal gradients occurred in key heat dissipation areas (HDAs) around the eyes, axial region and feet. Eye and axial surface temperatures were 8 ◦C or more above air temperature, and remained relatively constant across speeds suggesting physiological regulation of skin surface temperature. During hovering, birds dangled their feet, which enhanced radiative heat loss. In addition, during hovering, near-body induced airflows from the wings were low except around the feet (approx. 2. 5 ms− 1), which probably enhanced convective heat loss. Axial HDA and maximum surface temperature exhibited a shallow U-shaped pattern across speeds, revealing a localized relationship with power production in flight in the HDA closest to the primary flight muscles. We conclude that hummingbirds actively alter routes of heat dissipation as a function of flight speed...|$|R
50|$|During courtship, a male <b>calliope</b> <b>hummingbird</b> hovers at {{accelerated}} wingbeat frequency up to 95 flaps {{per second}} (42% {{higher than normal}} hovering), creating a loud buzzing sound, with throat feathers protruding and facing a female. The male then ascends temporarily to 20 meters and dives at high speed, with the rapid descent causing sonation of wing and tail feathers combined with vocalization, intending to attract attention of the female. Research in a wind tunnel demonstrated that the male courtship display includessounds produced by three independent feather or vocal components, each with different acoustic characteristics, thus potentially containing different messages appealing to the female.|$|E
50|$|The {{breeding}} {{habitat of}} <b>calliope</b> <b>hummingbird</b> is varied among open shrub habitats and altitudes. Nesting usually occurs at higher altitudes in the Rocky Mountains. Nests {{have been observed}} from as low as 300 m in Washington elevation to the tree line at over 3000 m. In Montana, the minimum elevation observed for breeding is 1200 m. Open montane forest, mountain meadows, and willow and alder thickets may variously serve as breeding grounds. During migration and winter, they also occur in chaparral, lowland brushy areas, deserts and semi-desert regions. They nest in western North America from southern British Columbia and Alberta south to Colorado and southern California. During spring and summer, they move, mainly through Arizona and New Mexico and northern Mexico, to winter in southwestern Mexico {{as well as in}} Guatemala and Belize.|$|E
50|$|This is the {{smallest}} breeding bird found in Canada and the United States. The only smaller species ever found in the U.S. is the bumblebee hummingbird, an accidental vagrant from Mexico. An adult <b>calliope</b> <b>hummingbird</b> can measure 7 - 10 cm in length, span 11 cm across the wings and weigh 2 to 3 g. These birds have glossy green {{on the back and}} crown with white underparts. Their bill and tail are relatively short. The adult male has wine-red streaks on the throat, green flanks and a dark tail. Females and immatures have a pinkish wash on the flanks, dark streaks on the throat and a dark tail with white tips. The only similar birds are the rufous hummingbird and the Allen's hummingbird, but these birds are larger with more distinct and contrasting rufous markings on tail and flanks, and longer central tail feathers.|$|E
5000|$|Of {{the larger}} mammals {{the most common}} are elk, which exist in the thousands. [...] Their {{migration}} route between the National Elk Refuge and Yellowstone National Park is through Grand Teton National Park, so while easily seen anytime of the year, they are most numerous {{in the spring and}} fall. Other ungulates include bison and pronghorn—the fastest land mammal in the western hemisphere—which are found throughout Jackson Hole as are moose, which tend to stay near waterways and wetlands. Between 100-125 bighorn sheep dwell in the alpine and rocky zones of the peaks.Over 300 species of birds have been sighted in the park including the <b>calliope</b> <b>hummingbird,</b> the smallest bird species in North America, as well as trumpeter swans, which is North America's largest waterfowl.

It is also the only subspecies of cutthroat trout that is exclusively native to large streams and rivers. Various researchers {{have not been able to}} identify any genetic differences between the Snake River fine-spotted cutthroat trout and the Yellowstone cutthroat trout, though in terms of appearances, the Snake River subspecies has much smaller spots which cover a greater portion of the body, and the two subspecies inhabit different ecological niches. The Snake River fine-spotted cutthroat trout was identified by some researchers as a separate subspecies by the mid-1990s, and is managed as a distinct subspecies by the state of Wyoming, but is not yet recognized as such by the neighboring states of Idaho and Montana. Snake River fine-spotted cutthroat trout is found only in the Snake River and tributaries below the Jackson Lake dam to the Palisades Reservoir in Idaho. Other non-native species of trout such as the rainbow trout and lake trout were introduced by the Wyoming Fish and Game Department or migrated out of Yellowstone. Today five trout species inhabit park waters. Native species of fish include the mountain whitefish, longnose dace, mountain sucker and non-native species include the Utah chub and Arctic grayling.Only four species of reptiles are documented in the park: three species of snakes which are the wandering garter snake, the less commonly seen valley garter snake and rubber boa, as well as one lizard species, the northern sagebrush lizard, that was first reported in 1992. None of the species are venomous. Six amphibian species have been documented including the Columbia spotted frog, boreal chorus frog, tiger salamander and the increasingly rare boreal toad and northern leopard frog. A sixth amphibian species, the bullfrog, was introduced. An estimated 10,000 insect species frequent the park; they pollinate plants, provide a food source for birds, fish, mammals and other animals, and help in the decomposition of wood. In one example of the importance of insects to the ecosystem, swarms of Army cutworm moths die in huge numbers after mating and provide a high fat and protein diet for bears and other predators. One study concluded that when this moth species is most available, bears consume 40,000 moths per day which is roughly 20,000 kcal/day.|$|E

40|$|Multi-component signals contain {{multiple}} signal parts {{expressed in}} the same physical modality. One way to identify individual components is if they are produced by different physical mechanisms. Here, I studied the mechanisms generating acoustic signals in the courtship displays of the <b>Calliope</b> <b>hummingbird</b> Stellula calliope. Display dives consisted of three synchronized sound elements, a high-frequency tone (hft), a low frequency tone (lft), and atonal sound pulses (asp), which were then followed by a frequency-modulated fall. Manipulating any of the rectrices (tail-feathers) of wild males impaired production of the lft and asp but not the hft or fall, which are apparently vocal. I tested the sound production capabilities of the rectrices in a wind tunnel. Single rectrices could generate the lft but not the asp, whereas multiple rectrices tested together produced sounds similar to the asp when they fluttered and collided with their neighbors percussively, representing a previously unknown mechanism of sound production. During the shuttle display, a trill is generated by the wings during pulses in which the wingbeat frequency is elevated to 95 Hz, 40 % higher than the typical hovering wingbeat frequency. The <b>Calliope</b> <b>hummingbird</b> courtship displays include sounds produced by three independent mechanisms, and thus include {{a minimum of three}} acoustic signal components. These acoustic mechanisms have different constraints and thus potentially contain different messages. Producing multiple acoustic signals via multiple mechanisms may be a way to escape the constraints present in any single mechanism [Current Zoology 57 (2) : 187 – 196, 2011]...|$|E

40|$|We {{present a}} {{computational}} study of flapping-wing aerodynamics of a <b>calliope</b> <b>hummingbird</b> (Selasphorus calliope) during fast forward flight. Three-dimensional wing kinematics {{were incorporated into}} the model by extracting time-dependent wing position from high-speed videos of the bird flying in a wind tunnel at 8. 3 [*]m[*]s− 1. The advance ratio, i. e. the ratio between flight speed and average wingtip speed, is around one. An immersed-boundary method was used to simulate flow around the wings and bird body. The result shows that both downstroke and upstroke in a wingbeat cycle produce significant thrust for the bird to overcome drag on the body, and such thrust production comes at price of negative lift induced during upstroke. This feature might be shared with bats, while being distinct from insects and other birds, including closely related swifts...|$|E
40|$|The {{fall season}} {{is a long}} one in terms of bird movements. The SUMMER FIELD REPORT {{detailed}} the post-breeding wanderings of herons {{and the beginning of}} shorebird migration. This report covers the end of these and the southward movements of insectivorous passerines, mainly in August and September, while seedeaters such as sparrows follow, mainly in September and October. Waterfowl generally bring up the rear, moving south just ahead of the freeze-up. The fall season is probably the most exciting time for rare bird enthusiasts, as young birds of many species wander, often aimlessly, {{at this time of year}} before they face reality and head south. A few exceptions linger into the winter season to be picked up on Christmas Bird Counts and at feeders. Highlights of this report include a few notably early or late dates of occurrence; no particular pattern emerges with these, however, although the fall was generally mild, allowing a few species to extend their stays in Nebraska. Several species were reported which had very few fall records previously; most unexpected was probably the 1 st fall panhandle record of Scarlet Tanager. Rarities include the 2 nd state record for Sharp-tailed Sandpiper, found by Larry Malone in Sheridan County, and the 4 th state record for <b>calliope</b> <b>Hummingbird,</b> caught by a dog on the Jim Hatch ranch in southern Sioux County and reported by Alice Kenitz, who recovered the specimen.
